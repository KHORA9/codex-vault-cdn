Two persons, scarcely larger than the fabled gentlemen of\r\nLilliput, (though one is twelve or thirteen and the other eighteen years\r\nof age), of just and even elegant proportions, and physiognomies\r\nstriking and peculiar, but not deficient in intellect or refinement,\r\nhave been visited by throngs of idlers in quest of amusement,\r\nwonder-seekers, and the profoundest inquirers into human history. Until\r\nvery recently, Mexico was properly described as _Terra Incognita_. The\r\nremains of nations are there shrouded in oblivion, and cities, in their\r\ntime surpassing Tadmor and Thebes, untrodden except by the jaguar and\r\nthe ocelot. A few persons, indeed, attracted by uncertain rumors of\r\nancient grandeur in Palenque, have visited her temples and tombs--\r\n\r\n                       There to track\r\n    Fallen states and empires o'er a land\r\n    Which was the mightiest in her high command,\r\n    And is the loveliest--\r\n\r\nbut no one has been found to read the hieroglyphics of Tolteca, to\r\ndisclose the history of the dwellers in Anahuac, to make known the\r\nannals of the rise and fall of Tlascala, Otumba, Copan, or Papantla. In\r\nthe great work of Lord Kingsborough are collected many important remains\r\nof Mexican and Aztec art and learning; Mr. Prescott has combined with a\r\nmasterly hand the traditions of the country; and Mr. Stevens and Mr.\r\nSquier have done much in the last few years to render us familiar with\r\nthe more accessible and probably most significant ruins which illustrate\r\nthe civilization of the race subdued by the Spaniards; but still Central\r\nAmerica is unexplored. In the second volume of the work of Mr. Stevens,\r\nhe mentions that a Roman Catholic priest of Santa Cruz del Quiche told\r\nhim marvellous stories of a \"large city, with turrets white and\r\nglittering in the sun,\" beyond the Cordilleras, where a people still\r\nexisted in the condition of the subjects of Montezuma. He proceeds:\r\n\r\n     \"The interest awakened in us, was the most thrilling I ever\r\n     experienced. One look at that city, was worth ten years of an\r\n     every-day life. If he is right, a place is left where Indians\r\n     and a city exist, as Cortez and Alvarado found them; there are\r\n     living men who can solve the mystery that hangs over the ruined\r\n     cities of America; who can, perhaps, go to Copan and read the\r\n     inscription on its monuments. No subject more exciting and\r\n     attractive presents itself to any mind, and the deep impression\r\n     in my mind will never be effaced. Can it be true? Being now in\r\n     my sober senses, I do verily believe there is much ground to\r\n     suppose that what the Padre told us is authentic. That the\r\n     region referred to does not acknowledge the government of\r\n     Gautamala, and has never been explored, and that no white man\r\n     has ever pretended to have entered it; I am satisfied. From\r\n     other sources we heard that a large _ruined_ city was visible;\r\n     and we were told of another person who had climbed to the top\r\n     of the sierra, but on account of the dense clouds rising upon\r\n     it, he had not been able to see any thing. At all events, the\r\n     belief at the village of Chajul is general, and a curiosity is\r\n     aroused that burns to be satisfied. We had a craving desire to\r\n     reach the mysterious city. No man if so willing to peril his\r\n     life, could undertake the enterprise, with any hope of success,\r\n     without hovering for one or two years on the borders of the\r\n     country, studying the language and character of the adjoining\r\n     Indians, and making acquaintance with some of the natives. Five\r\n     hundred men could probably march directly to the city, and the\r\n     invasion would be more justifiable than any made by Spaniards;\r\n     but the government is too much occupied with its own wars, and\r\n     the knowledge could not be procured except at the price of\r\n     blood. Two young men of good constitution, and who could afford\r\n     to spend five years, might succeed. If the object of search\r\n     prove a phantom, in the wild scenes of a new and unexplored\r\n     country, there are other objects of interest; but, if real,\r\n     besides the glorious excitement of such a novelty, they will\r\n     have something to look back upon through life. As to the\r\n     dangers, they are always magnified, and, in general, peril is\r\n     discovered soon enough for escape. But, in all probability, if\r\n     any discovery is made, it will be made by the Padres. As for\r\n     ourselves, to attempt it alone, ignorant of the language, and\r\n     with the mozos who were a constant annoyance to us, was out of\r\n     the question. The most we thought of, was to climb to the top\r\n     of the sierra, thence to look down upon the mysterious city;\r\n     but we had difficulties enough in the road before us; it would\r\n     add ten days to a journey already almost appalling in the\r\n     perspective; for days the sierra might be covered with clouds;\r\n     in attempting too much, we might lose all; Palenque was our\r\n     great point, and we determined not to be diverted from the\r\n     course we had marked out.\"--_Vol. ii., p. 193-196._\r\n\r\nMr. Stevens appears to have had some confidence in the Padre's\r\nstatement, and expresses a belief that the race of the aboriginal\r\ninhabitants of Central America is not extinct, but that, scattered\r\nperhaps and retired, like our own Indians, into wildernesses which have\r\nnever been penetrated by white men--erecting buildings of \"lime and\r\nstone,\" \"with ornaments of sculpture, and plastered,\" \"large courts,\"\r\nand \"lofty towers, with high ranges of steps,\" and carving on tablets of\r\nstone mysterious hieroglyphs, there are still in secluded cities\r\n\"unconquered, unvisited, and unsought aborigines.\" It is stated in a\r\npamphlet before us, that such a city was discovered in 1849 by three\r\nadventurous travellers, and that one of them succeeded in bringing to\r\nNew York two specimens of its diminutive and peculiar inhabitants--the\r\npersons now being exhibited in Broadway. Of the credibility of this\r\naccount we express no opinion, but the \"Aztec Children\" have the\r\nphrenological and general appearance of the ancient Mexican sculptures,\r\nand may well be regarded for their probable origin, their physical\r\nstructure, or their mere appearance, as among the \"most wonderful\r\nspecimens of humanity.\" We assent to the following paragraph by Mr.\r\nHorace Greeley, whose testimony agrees with the common impressions they\r\nhave produced:\r\n\r\n     \"I hate monstrosities, however remarkable, and am rather\r\n     repelled than attracted by the idea of their truthfulness.\r\n     Assuming that there is a propensity in human nature--an\r\n     'organ,' as the phrenologists would phrase it--that finds\r\n     gratification in the inspection and scrutiny of Joice Heths,\r\n     Woolly Horses, and six-legged Swine, I would rather have it\r\n     gratified by fabricated and factitious than by natural and\r\n     veritable productions, and would rather not share in the\r\n     process from which that gratification is extracted. There is a\r\n     superabundance of ugliness and deformity which one is obliged\r\n     to see, without running after and nosing any out. It was,\r\n     therefore, with some reluctance that I obeyed a polite\r\n     invitation to visit the Aztec children, and ratify or dispute\r\n     the commendations hitherto bestowed on them, in these columns\r\n     and elsewhere. I did not expect to find ogres nor any thing\r\n     hideous, but, among all similar exhibitions, remembering with\r\n     pleasure only Tom Thumb, I could not hope to find gratification\r\n     in the sight of two dwarf Indians. But I was disappointed.\r\n     These children are simply abridgements or pocket editions of\r\n     Humanity--bright-eyed, delicate-featured, olive-complexioned\r\n     little elves, with dark, straight, glossy hair,\r\n     well-proportioned heads, and animated, pleasing countenances.\r\n     That their ages are honestly given, and that the boy weighs\r\n     just about as many pounds as he is years old (twenty), while\r\n     the girl is about half his age and three pounds lighter, I see\r\n     no reason at all for doubting. That they are human beings,\r\n     though of a low grade morally and intellectually, as well as\r\n     diminutive physically, there can be no doubt; and they are not\r\n     freaks of Nature, but specimens of a dwindled, minnikin race,\r\n     who almost realize in bodily form our ideas of the 'brownies,'\r\n     'bogles,' and other fanciful creations of a more superstitious\r\n     age. Their heads, unlike those of dwarfs, are small and not\r\n     ill-looking, but with very low foreheads and a general\r\n     conformation strongly confirmatory of certain fundamental\r\n     assertions of Phrenology. Idiotic they are not; but their\r\n     intellect and language are those of children of three or four\r\n     years, to whom their gait also assimilates them; but they have\r\n     none of childhood's reserve or shyness, are inquisitive and\r\n     restless, and articulate with manifest efforts and difficulty.\r\n     To children of three to six or eight years, their incessant\r\n     pranks and gambols must be a source of intense and unfailing\r\n     delight. The story that they were procured from an unknown,\r\n     scarcely approachable Aboriginal City of Central America called\r\n     _Iximaya_, situated high among the mountains and rarely visited\r\n     by civilized man, may be true or false; but that they are\r\n     natives of that part of the world, I cannot doubt. To the\r\n     moralist, the student, the physiologist, they are subjects\r\n     deserving of careful scrutiny and thoughtful observation; while\r\n     to those whose highest motive is the gratification of\r\n     curiosity, but especially to children, they must be objects of\r\n     vivid interest.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA DAY AT CHATSWORTH.\r\n\r\nTHE PRISON OF MARY, QUEEN OF SCOTS, AND PALACE OF THE DUKES OF\r\nDEVONSHIRE.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ENTRANCE GATES.]\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the most magnificent of the palatial homes of England--indeed one\r\nof the most rich and splendid residences occupied in all the world by an\r\nuncrowned master--is Chatsworth, in Derbyshire, the most beautiful\r\ndistrict in the British islands. With some abridgment we transfer to the\r\n_International_ an account of a recent visit to Chatsworth, by Mrs. S.\r\nC. HALL, with the illustrations by Mr. FINHALT, from the January number\r\nof the London _Art-Journal_. Our agreeable authoress, after some general\r\nobservations respecting the attractions of the neighborhood, proceeds:\r\n\r\n     \"We are so little proud of the beauties of England, that the\r\n     foreigner only hears of Derbyshire as the casket which contains\r\n     the rich jewel of CHATSWORTH. The setting is worthy of the gem.\r\n     It ranks foremost among proudly beautiful English mansions; and\r\n     merits its familiar title of the Palace of the Peak. It was the\r\n     object of our pilgrimage; and we recalled the history of the\r\n     nobles of its House. The family of Cavendish is one of our\r\n     oldest descents; it may be traced lineally from Robert de\r\n     Gernon, who entered England with the Conqueror, and whose\r\n     descendant, Roger Gernon, of Grimston, in Suffolk, marrying the\r\n     daughter and sole heiress of Lord Cavendish in that county, in\r\n     the reign of Edward II., gave the name of that estate as a\r\n     surname to his children, which they ever after bore. The study\r\n     of the law seems to have been for a long period the means of\r\n     according position and celebrity to the family, Sir William\r\n     Cavendish, in whose person all the estates conjoined, was Privy\r\n     Councillor to Henry VIII., Edward VI., and Mary; he had been\r\n     Gentleman-Usher to Wolsey; and after the fall of the great\r\n     Cardinal, was retained in the service of Henry VIII. He\r\n     accumulated much wealth, but chiefly by his third marriage,\r\n     with Elizabeth, the wealthy widow of Robert Barley, at whose\r\n     instigation he sold his estates in other parts of England, to\r\n     purchase lands in Derbyshire, where her great property lay.\r\n     Hardwick Hall was her paternal residence, but Sir William began\r\n     to build another at Chatsworth, which he did not live to\r\n     finish. Ultimately, Elizabeth became the wife of George Talbot,\r\n     Earl of Shrewsbury; she was one of the most remarkable women of\r\n     her time, and the foundress of the two houses of Devonshire and\r\n     Newcastle. Her second son, William, by the death of his elder\r\n     brother in 1616, after being created Baron Cavendish, of\r\n     Hardwick, was in 1618 created Earl of Devonshire. It was\r\n     happily said of him, 'his learning operated on his conduct, but\r\n     was seldom shown in his discourse.' His son, the third Earl,\r\n     was a zealous loyalist; like his father, remarkable for his\r\n     cultivated taste and learning, perfected under the\r\n     superintendence of the famous Hobbes of Malmesbury. His eldest\r\n     son, William, was the first Duke of Devonshire; the friend of\r\n     Lord Russell, and one of the few who fearlessly testified to\r\n     his honor on his memorable trial. Wearied of courts, he retired\r\n     to Chatsworth, which at that time was a quadrangular building,\r\n     with turrets in the Elizabethan taste; and then, 'as if his\r\n     mind rose upon the depression of his fortune,' says Kennett,\r\n     'he first projected the now glorious pile of Chatsworth;' he\r\n     pulled down the south side of 'that good old seat,' and rebuilt\r\n     it on a plan 'so fair an august, that it looked like a model\r\n     only of what might be done in after ages.' After seven years,\r\n     he added the other sides, 'yet the building was his least\r\n     charge, if regard be had to his gardens, water-works, statues,\r\n     pictures, and other the finest pieces of Art and Nature that\r\n     could be obtained abroad or at home.' He was highly honored\r\n     with the favor and confidence of William III. and his successor\r\n     Anne. Dying in 1707, his son William, who was Lord Lieutenant\r\n     of Ireland, spent the latter part of his life at Chatsworth,\r\n     dying there in 1755. It is now the favorite country residence\r\n     of his great grandson, the sixth Duke and ninth Earl of\r\n     Devonshire.\r\n\r\n     \"The Duke's tastes, as evinced at Chatsworth, are of the purest\r\n     and happiest order;--and are to be found in the adornments of\r\n     his rooms, the shelves of his library, the riches of his\r\n     galleries of art, and the rare and beautiful exotic marvels of\r\n     his gardens and conservatories. Charles Cotton, in his poem,\r\n     the _Wonders of the Peak_, wrote, two centuries ago, of the\r\n     then Earl of Devonshire--and no language can apply with\r\n     greater truth to the Duke who is now master of Chatsworth:\r\n\r\n         \"But that which crowns all this, and does impart\r\n         A lustre far beyond the pow'r of Art,\r\n         Is the great Owner; He, whose noble mind\r\n         For such a Fortune only was design'd.\r\n         Whose bounties, as the Ocean's bosom wide,\r\n         Flow in a constant, unexhausted tide\r\n         Of Hospitality, and free access,\r\n         Liberal Condescension, cheerfulness,\r\n         Honor and Truth, as ev'ry of them strove\r\n         At once to captivate Respect and Love:\r\n         And with such order all perform'd, and grace,\r\n        As rivet wonder to the stately place.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE EMPEROR FOUNTAIN.]\r\n\r\n     \"Although carriages are permitted to drive from the railway\r\n     terminus at Rowsley, to the pretty and pleasant inn at Edenson,\r\n     by a road which passes directly under the house, the stranger\r\n     should receive his first impressions of Chatsworth from one of\r\n     the surrounding heights. It is impossible to convey a just idea\r\n     of its breadth and dignity; the platform upon which it stands\r\n     is a fitting base for such a structure; the trees, that at\r\n     intervals relieve and enliven the vast space, are of every rich\r\n     variety, the terraces nearly twelve hundred feet in\r\n     extent--'the emperor fountain' throwing its jet two hundred and\r\n     seventy feet into the air, far overtopping the avenue of\r\n     majestic trees, of which it forms the centre. The dancing\r\n     fountain, the great cascade, even the smaller fountains\r\n     (wonderful objects any where, except here, where there are so\r\n     many more wonderful) sparkle through the foliage; while all is\r\n     backed by magnificent hanging woods, and the high lands of\r\n     Derbyshire, extending from the hills of Matlock to Stony\r\n     Middleton. And the foreground of the picture is, in its way,\r\n     equally beautiful; the expansive view, the meadows now broken\r\n     into green hills and mimic valleys, the groups of fallow deer,\r\n     and herds of cattle, reposing beneath the shade of\r\n     wide-spreading chestnuts, or the stately beech--all is harmony\r\n     to perfection; nothing is wanting to complete the fascination\r\n     of the whole. The enlarged and cultivated minds which conceived\r\n     these vast yet minute arrangements, did not consider minor\r\n     details as unimportant; every tree, and brake, and bush; every\r\n     ornament, every path, is exactly in its right place, and seems\r\n     to have ever been there. Nothing, however great, or however\r\n     small, has escaped consideration; there are no bewildering\r\n     effects, such as are frequently seen in large domains, and\r\n     which render it difficult to recall what at the time may have\r\n     been much admired; all is arranged with the dignity of order;\r\n     all, however graceful, is substantial; the ornaments sometimes\r\n     elaborate, never descend into prettiness; the character of the\r\n     scenery has been borne in mind, and its beauty never outraged\r\n     by extravagance. All is in harmony with the character which\r\n     nature in her most generous mood gave to the hills and valleys;\r\n     God has been gracious to the land, and man has followed in the\r\n     pathway He has made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TEMPLE CASCADE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE WELLINGTON ROCK AND CASCADE.]\r\n\r\n     \"A month at Chatsworth would hardly suffice to count its\r\n     beauties; but much may be done in a day, when eyes and ears are\r\n     open, and the heart beats in sympathy with the beauties of\r\n     Nature and of Art. It is, perhaps, best to visit the gardens of\r\n     Chatsworth first; they are little more than half a mile to the\r\n     north of the park; and there Sir Joseph Paxton is building his\r\n     new dwelling, or rather adding considerably to the beauty and\r\n     convenience of the old. In the Kitchen-Gardens, containing\r\n     twelve acres, there are houses for every species of plant, but\r\n     the grand attraction is the house which contains the Royal Lily\r\n     (Victoria Regia), and other lilies and water-plants from\r\n     various countries. It will be readily believed that the\r\n     flower-gardens are among the most exquisitely beautiful in\r\n     Europe; they have been arranged by one of the master minds of\r\n     the age, and bear evidence of matured knowledge, skill, and\r\n     taste; the nicest judgment seems to have been exercised over\r\n     even the smallest matter of detail, while the whole is as\r\n     perfect a combination as can be conceived of grandeur and\r\n     loveliness. The walks, lawns, and parterres are lavishly, but\r\n     unobtrusively, decorated with vases and statues; terraces occur\r\n     here and there, from which are to be obtained the best views of\r\n     the adjacent country; 'Patrician trees' at intervals form\r\n     umbrageous alleys; water is made contributory from a hundred\r\n     mountain streams and rivulets, to form jets, cascades, and\r\n     fountains, which, infinitely varied in their 'play,' ramble\r\n     among lilies, or--it is scarcely an exaggeration to say--fling\r\n     their spray into the clouds, and descend to refresh the topmost\r\n     leaves of trees that were in their prime three centuries ago.\r\n     The most striking and original of the walks is that which leads\r\n     through mimic Alpine scenery to the great conservatory; here\r\n     Art has been most triumphant; the rocks, which, have been all\r\n     brought hither, are so skilfully combined, so richly clad in\r\n     mosses, so luxuriantly covered with heather, so judiciously\r\n     based with ferns and water-plants, that you move among or\r\n     beside them in rare delight at the sudden change which\r\n     transports you from trim parterres to the utmost wildness of\r\n     natural beauty. From these again you pass into a garden, in the\r\n     centre of which is the conservatory, always renowned, but now\r\n     more than ever, as the prototype of the famous Palace of Glass,\r\n     which, in this _Annus Mirabilis_, received under its roof six\r\n     millions of the people of all nations, tongues, and creeds. In\r\n     extent, the conservatory at Chatsworth is but a pigmy compared\r\n     with that which glorifies Hyde Park: but it is filled with the\r\n     rarest Exotics from all parts of the globe--from 'farthest\r\n     Ind,' from China, from the Himalayas, from Mexico; here you see\r\n     the rich banana, Eschol's grape hanging in ripe profusion\r\n     beneath the shadow of immense paper-like leaves; the feathery\r\n     cocoa-palm, with its head peering almost to the lofty arched\r\n     roof; the far-famed silk cotton-tree, supplying a sheet of\r\n     cream-colored blossoms, at a season when all outward vegetable\r\n     gayety is on the wane: the singular milk-tree of the\r\n     Caraccas--the fragrant cinnamon and cassia--with thousands of\r\n     other rare and little-known species of both flowers and fruits.\r\n     The Italian Garden--opposite the library windows, with its\r\n     richly colored parterres, and its clustered foliage wreathed\r\n     around the pillars which support the statues and busts\r\n     scattered among them, and hanging from one to the other with a\r\n     luxurious verdure which seems to belong to the south--is a\r\n     relief to the eye sated with the splendors of the palatial\r\n     edifice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ROCK-WORK.]\r\n\r\n     \"The water-works, which were constructed under the direction of\r\n     M. Grillet, a French artist, were begun in 1690, when a pipe\r\n     for what was then called 'the great fountain' was laid down;\r\n     the height of twenty feet to which it threw water being, at\r\n     that time, considered sufficiently wonderful to justify the\r\n     hyperbolical language of Cotton:\r\n\r\n         '--should it break or fall, I doubt we should\r\n         Begin to reckon from the second flood.'\r\n\r\n     It was afterward elevated to fifty feet, and then to\r\n     ninety-four feet; but it is now celebrated as the most\r\n     remarkable fountain in the world; it rises to the height of two\r\n     hundred and sixty-seven feet, and has been named the _Emperor\r\n     Fountain_, in honor of the visit of the Emperor of Russia to\r\n     Chatsworth in 1844. Such is the velocity with which the water\r\n     is ejected, that it is shown to escape at the rate of one\r\n     hundred miles per minute; for the purpose of supplying it, a\r\n     reservoir, or immense artificial lake, has been constructed on\r\n     the hills, above Chatsworth, which is fed by the streams around\r\n     and the springs on the moors drains being cut for this purpose,\r\n     commencing at Humberly Brook, on the Chesterfield Road, two\r\n     miles and a half from the reservoir, which covers eight acres;\r\n     a pipe winds down the hill side, through which the water\r\n     passes; and such is its waste, that a diminution of a foot may\r\n     be perceived when the water-works have been played for three\r\n     hours. Nothing can exceed the stupendous effect of this column,\r\n     which may be seen for many miles around, shooting upwards to\r\n     the sky in varied and graceful evolutions. From this upper lake\r\n     the waterfalls are also supplied, which are constructed with so\r\n     natural an effect on the hill side, behind the water-temple,\r\n     which reminds the spectator of the glories of St. Cloud. From\r\n     the dome of this temple bursts forth a gush of water that\r\n     covers its surface, pours through the urns at its sides, and\r\n     springs up in fountains underneath, thence descending in a long\r\n     series of step-like falls, until it sinks beneath the rocks at\r\n     the base, and--after rising again to play as 'the dancing\r\n     fountain' is conveyed by drains under the garden and\r\n     park,--being emptied into the Derwent.[1] But we may not forget\r\n     that our space is limited: to describe the gardens and\r\n     conservatories of Chatsworth would occupy more pages than we\r\n     can give to the whole theme; suffice it that the taste and\r\n     liberality of the Duke of Devonshire, and the skill and\r\n     judgment of Sir Joseph Paxton, have so combined Nature and Art\r\n     in this delicious region, as to supply all the enjoyment that\r\n     may be desired or is attainable, from trees, shrubs, and\r\n     flowers seen under the happiest arrangement of countries,\r\n     classes, and colors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GREAT CONSERVATORY.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ITALIAN GARDEN.]\r\n\r\n     \"The erection of the present house is narrated by Lysons, who\r\n     says, the south front was begun to be rebuilt on the 12th of\r\n     April, 1687, and the great hall and staircase covered in about\r\n     the middle of April, 1690; the east front was begun in 1693,\r\n     and finished in 1700; the south gallery was pulled down and\r\n     rebuilt in 1703; in 1704, the north front was pulled down; the\r\n     west front was finished in 1706; and the whole of the building\r\n     not long afterwards completed, being about twenty years from\r\n     the time of its commencement. The architect was Mr. William\r\n     Talman, but in May, 1692, the works were surveyed by Sir\r\n     Christopher Wren.\r\n\r\n     \"On entering--the Lower Hall or Western Lodge contains some\r\n     very fine antique statuary, and fragments which deserve the\r\n     especial attention of the connoisseur. Among them are several\r\n     which were the treasured relics of Canova and Sir Henry\r\n     Englefield, and others found in Herculaneum, and presented by\r\n     the King of Naples to 'the beautiful' Duchess of Devonshire. A\r\n     corridor leads thence to the Great Hall, which is decorated\r\n     with paintings by the hand of a famous artist in his\r\n     day--Verrio--celebrated by Pope for his proficiency in\r\n     ceiling-painting. The effect of the hall is singularly good,\r\n     with its grand stair and triple arches opening to the principal\r\n     rooms. The sub-hall, behind, is embellished by a graceful\r\n     fountain, with the story of Diana and Actæon, and the abundance\r\n     of water at Chatsworth is sufficient for it to be constantly\r\n     playing, producing an effect seldom attempted within doors. A\r\n     long gallery leads to the various rooms inhabited by the Duke,\r\n     the walls being decorated with a large number of fine pictures\r\n     by the older masters of the Flemish and Italian schools. In the\r\n     billiard-room are Landseer's famed picture of Bolton Abbey in\r\n     the Olden Time, with charming specimens of Collins, and other\r\n     British painters.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ENTRANCE HALL]\r\n\r\n     \"The chapel is richly decorated with foliage in carved\r\n     woodwork, which has been erroneously attributed to Grinling\r\n     Gibbons. It was executed by Thomas Young, who was engaged as\r\n     the principal carver in wood in 1689, and by a pupil of his,\r\n     Samuel Watson, a native of Heanor, in Derbyshire, whose claim\r\n     to the principal ornamental woodcarving at Chatsworth is set\r\n     forth in verses on his tomb in Heanor Church.\r\n\r\n     \"Over the Colonnade on the north side of the quadrangle, is a\r\n     gallery nearly one hundred feet long in which have been hung a\r\n     numerous and valuable collection of drawings by the old\r\n     masters, arranged according to the schools of art of which they\r\n     are examples. There is no school unrepresented, and as the eye\r\n     wanders over the thickly-covered wall, it is arrested by\r\n     sketches from the hands of Raffaelle, Da Vinci, Claude Poussin,\r\n     Paul Veronese, Salvator Rosa, and the other great men who have\r\n     made Art immortal. To describe these works would occupy a\r\n     volume; to study them a life; it is a glorious collection\r\n     fitly displayed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SCULPTURE GALLERY.]\r\n\r\n     \"The old state-rooms, which form the upper floors of the south\r\n     front, occupy the same position as those which were\r\n     appropriated to the unfortunate Mary Queen of Scots during her\r\n     long residence here. There is, however, but little to see of\r\n     her period; if we except some needlework at the back of a\r\n     canopy representing hunting scenes, worked by the hand of the\r\n     famous Countess of Shrewsbury, popularly known as 'Bess of\r\n     Hardwick.'\r\n\r\n     \"The gallery, ninety feet by twenty-two, originally constructed\r\n     for dancing, has been fitted up by the present Duke as a\r\n     library. Among the books which formed the original library at\r\n     Chatsworth, are several which belonged to the celebrated\r\n     Hobbes, who was many years a resident at the old hall. The\r\n     library of Henry Cavendish, and the extensive and valuable\r\n     collection at Devonshire House have aided to swell its stores.\r\n     Thin quartos of the rarest order, unique volumes of old poetry,\r\n     scarce and curious pamphlets by the early printers, first\r\n     editions of Shakspeare, early pageants, and the rarest dramatic\r\n     and other popular literature of the Elizabethan era, may be\r\n     found in this well-ordered room--not to speak of its great\r\n     treasure, the _Liber Veritalus_ of Claude.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: QUEEN MARY'S BOWER.]\r\n\r\n     \"The statue gallery, a noble room erected by the present Duke,\r\n     contains a judiciously-selected series of sculptures. The gem\r\n     of the collection is the famous seated statue of Madame\r\n     Bonaparte, mother of Napoleon, by Canova. The same style\r\n     characterizes that of Pauline Borghese, by Campbell. Other\r\n     works of Canova are here--his statue of Hebe, and Endymion\r\n     sleeping; a bust of Petrarch's Laura, and the famous Lions,\r\n     copied by Benaglia from the colossal originals on the monument\r\n     of Clement XIV., at Rome. Thorwaldsen is abundantly represented\r\n     by his Night and Morning, and his bas-reliefs of Priam\r\n     Petitioning for the Body of Hector, and Briseis, taken from\r\n     Achilles by the Heralds. Schadow's Filatrice, or Spinning Girl,\r\n     and his classic bas-reliefs are worthy of all admiration. The\r\n     English school of sculpture appears to advantage in Gibson's\r\n     fine group, Mars and Cupid, and his bas-relief of Hero and\r\n     Leander--Chantry's busts of George IV. and\r\n     Canning--Westmacott's Cymbal Plaery--Wyatt's Musidora, and many\r\n     others.\r\n\r\n     \"Our visit to the mansion may conclude with a brief notice of\r\n     one of its most interesting relics. Queen Mary's Bower is a sad\r\n     memorial of the unhappy Queen's fourteen years' imprisonment\r\n     here. It has been quaintly described as 'an island plat, on the\r\n     top of a square tower, built in a large pool.' It is reached by\r\n     a bridge, and in this lonely island-garden did Mary pass many\r\n     days of a captivity, rendered doubly painful by the jealous\r\n     bickerings of the Countess of Shrewsbury, who openly complained\r\n     to Elizabeth of the Queen's intimacy with her husband; an\r\n     unfounded aspersion, which Mary's urgent solicitations to\r\n     Elizabeth obliged the Countess to retract, but which led to\r\n     Mary's removal from the Earl's custody to that of Sir Amias\r\n     Pawlet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HUNTING TOWER.]\r\n\r\n     \"To the Hunting-Tower on the hill above the house, the ascent\r\n     is by a road winding gracefully among venerable trees, planted\r\n     'when Elizabeth was Queen,' and occasionally passing beside a\r\n     fall of water, which dashes among rocks from the moors above.\r\n     The tower stands on the edge of the steep and thickly-wooded\r\n     hill; it is built on a platform of stone, reached by a few\r\n     steps; it is one of the relics of old Chatsworth, and is a\r\n     characteristic and curious feature of the scene. Such towers\r\n     were frequently placed near lordly residences in the olden\r\n     time, for the purpose 'of giving the ladies of those days an\r\n     opportunity of enjoying the sport of hunting,' which, from the\r\n     heights above, they saw in the vales beneath. The view from the\r\n     tower is one of the finest in England. The house and grounds\r\n     below, embosomed in foliage, peep through the umbrage far\r\n     beneath your feet; the rapid Derwent courses along through the\r\n     level valley. The wood opposite crowns the rising ground, above\r\n     Edensor--the picturesque and beautiful village within whose\r\n     humble church many members of the noble family are buried. The\r\n     village itself may be considered as a model of taste; it\r\n     resembles a group of Italian and Gothic villas, the utmost\r\n     variety and the most picturesque styles of architecture being\r\n     adopted for their construction, while the little flower-gardens\r\n     before them are as carefully tended as those at Chatsworth\r\n     itself. Upon the hills above are traces of Roman encampments,\r\n     and from the summit you look down upon the beautiful village\r\n     of Bakewell, and far-famed Haddon Hall--the antique residence\r\n     of the dukes of Rutland, an unspoiled relic of the sixteenth\r\n     century. Looking toward the north, the eye traverses the\r\n     fertile and beautiful valley of the Derwent, with the quiet\r\n     little villages of Pilsley, Hassop, and Baslow, consisting of\r\n     groups of cottages and quiet homesteads, speaking of pastoral\r\n     life in its most favorable aspect. The eye, following the\r\n     direction of the stream, is carried over the village of Calver,\r\n     beyond which the rocks of Stony Middleton converge and shut in\r\n     the prospect, with their gates of stone; amid distant trees,\r\n     the village of Eyam, celebrated for its mournful story of the\r\n     plague, and the heroism of its pastor, is embosomed. The ridge\r\n     of rock stretches around the plain to the right, and upon the\r\n     moors are traces of the early Britons in circles of stones and\r\n     tumuli, with various other singular and deeply-interesting\r\n     relics of 'the far off past.' Turning to the south, the\r\n     prospect is bounded by the hills of Matlock; the villages of\r\n     Darley-le-Dale, and Rowsley, reposing in mid-distance; the\r\n     entire prospect comprising a series of picturesque mountains,\r\n     fertile plains, wood, water, and rock, which cannot be\r\n     surpassed in the world for variety and beauty. The noble domain\r\n     in the foreground forming the grand centre of the whole:\r\n\r\n    \"'This palace, with wild prospects girded round,\r\n    Where the scorn'd Peak rivals proud Italy.'\r\n\r\n     \"It was evening when we ascended this charming hill, and stood\r\n     beneath the shadow of its famous Hunting Tower. The sun had\r\n     just set, leaving a landscape of immense extent sleeping\r\n     beneath rose-colored clouds; the air was balmy and fragrant\r\n     with the peculiar odor of the pine-trees which topped the\r\n     summit of the promontory on which we stood. We were told of\r\n     Taddington Hill--of Beeley Edge--of Brampton Moor--of Robin\r\n     Hood's bar--of Froggat Edge--until our eyes ached from the\r\n     desire to distinguish the one from the other. There was Tor\r\n     this, and Dale that, and such a hall and such a hamlet; but the\r\n     stillness by which we were surrounded had become so delicious\r\n     that we longed to enjoy it in solitude.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BRIDGE ACROSS THE DERWENT.]\r\n\r\n     \"What pen can tell of the beams of light that played on the\r\n     highlands, when, after the fading of that gorgeous sunset, the\r\n     valley became steeped in a soft blue-gray color, so tender, and\r\n     clear and pure, that it conveyed the idea of 'atmosphere' to\r\n     perfection. Then, as the shadows, the soothing shadows of\r\n     evening, increased around us, the woods seemed to melt into the\r\n     mountains; the rivers veiled their course by their misty\r\n     incense to the heavens--wreath after wreath of vapor creeping\r\n     upwards; and as the distances faded into indistinctness, the\r\n     bold headlands seemed to grow and prop the clouds; the heavens\r\n     let down the pall of mystery and darkness with a tender, not\r\n     terrific, power; earth and sky blended together, softly and\r\n     gently; the coolness of the air refreshed us, and yet the\r\n     stillness on that high point was so intense as to become almost\r\n     painful. As we looked into the valley, lights sprung up in\r\n     cottage dwellings; and then, softly on a wandering breeze, came\r\n     at intervals the tolling of a deep bell from the venerable\r\n     church at Edensor, a token that some one had been summoned to\r\n     another home--perhaps in one of those pale stars that at first\r\n     singly, but then in troops, were beaming on us from the pale\r\n     blue sky.\r\n\r\n     \"While slowly descending from our eyrie, amid the varied\r\n     shadows of a most lustrous moonlight, our eyes fell upon the\r\n     distant wood which surrounded Haddon Hall; its massive walls,\r\n     its mouldering tapestries, its stately terrace, its quaint\r\n     rooms and closets, its protected though decayed records of the\r\n     olden time, its minstrel gallery--were again present to our\r\n     minds; and it was a natural and most pleasing contrast--that of\r\n     the deserted and half-ruined house, with the mansion happily\r\n     inhabited, filled with so many art-treasures, and presided\r\n     over by one of the best gentlemen a monarch ever ennobled and a\r\n     people ever loved.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MOORISH SUMMER HOUSE.]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] A quaint whim of the olden time is constructed near one of the\r\nwalks; it is the model of a willow-tree in copper, which has all the\r\nappearance of a living one, situated on a raised mound of earth. From\r\neach branch, however, water suddenly bursts, and also small jets from\r\nthe grassy borders around. It was considered a good jest some years ago\r\nto delude novices to examine this tree, and wet them thoroughly by\r\nsuddenly turning on the water above and around them. This tree was\r\noriginally made by a London plumber in 1693; but it has been recently\r\nrepaired by a plumber in the neighborhood of Chesterfield, under the\r\ndirection of Sir Joseph Paxton.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMEN AND WOMEN OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have _Louis Quinze_ chairs in our parlors, Louis Quinze carving and\r\ngilding about our mirrors, our ladies (in a double sense, of grace and\r\nutility), sweep past us in the streets or rustle in the ball-room in\r\nLouis Quinze brocades, with the boddice, if not the train, of pattern\r\nidentical with that of Madame de Pompadour, as depicted in the excellent\r\nportrait before us in Mr. Redfield's elegant volumes, and we are, if\r\nscandal does not lie more than usual, making very practical acquaintance\r\nwith Louis Quinze morals. It may be as well, therefore, to become more\r\nfamiliar with a period we find it so convenient to imitate. The great\r\nevents of French history since 1789, their rapid sequence and ever\r\nvarying character, have thrown into the shade the previous annals of the\r\nkingdom. Especially has this been the case with the period immediately\r\npreceding the days of terror. This period has been dispatched in a few\r\nsentences, in the opening chapters of works on the French Revolution--in\r\nsome vague generalities on its profligacy and chaotic infamy. We have\r\nhad glimpses, through the _Oeil de Boeuf_, at groups of exquisite\r\ngentlemen and gay ladies; abbés who wrote every thing but sermons, and\r\nwere free from the censure of not practising what they preached since\r\nthey did not preach at all; generals who fought a campaign as\r\ndeliberately and ceremoniously as they danced a minuet; statesmen whose\r\ndiplomacy was more of the seraglio than the council; painters who\r\nimproved on nature, applying the same tricks of art to the landscape as\r\nwith powders to their curls; and simpering lips of the Marquise, and\r\npoets whose highest flights were a sonnet to Pompadour, or a pastoral to\r\na sheep-tending Phillis. Our casual observations of all these people,\r\nhowever, have been vague and slight, for few have probably had patience\r\nto follow these worthies to their retirement, and look over their\r\nshoulders at the memoirs which every mother's son and daughter of the\r\nset, from the prime minister to the cook, found--it is impossible to\r\ntell how--time to scribble down for the edification of posterity. In the\r\nvolumes of Arsene Houssaye before us, these gay but unsubstantial\r\nshadows take flesh and blood, and become the _Men and Women_--the living\r\nrealities of the Eighteenth Century. We have here the most piquant\r\nadventures of the _Memoirs_ and the choicest _mots_ of the _Anas_,\r\nculled from the hundreds of volumes which weigh down the shelves of the\r\nFrench public libraries. Not only indeed have we the run of the _petites\r\nsoupers_ of Versailles, but we may wander at will in the coulisses of\r\nthe Grand Opera, picking up the latest gossip of Camargo or Sophie\r\nArnold, enter the foyer of the classic Theatre Française, or adjourn to\r\nthe Café Procope to hear the last joke of Piron, or the latest news from\r\nFernay. And better than all these, we may mount, _au cinquième, au\r\nsexième_, to the lofty yet humble garret of the author or the artist,\r\nand there find, in an age of sickening heartlessness, refreshing scenes\r\nof household sincerity, patient endurance of hardship, showing that even\r\nthat depraved age was not utterly devoid of the heroic and the pure. M.\r\nHoussaye is no rigid moralist, he employs no historic pillory, and often\r\ndisplays the painful flippancy of the modern French school on religious\r\npoints, but he does honor to these better traits of humanity when he\r\nmeets them. And we are not sure but that the morality of the work is the\r\nmore impressive for the absence of the didactic. Here is little danger\r\nof our falling in love with vice, seductive as she appears in the annals\r\nof Louis XV., for we see the rotten canvas as well as the brilliant\r\nscene. We remember with the gaudy blossoms of 1740-60, the ashen fruit\r\nof 1789-'95. It is as hard to select extracts from M. Houssaye's volumes\r\non account of the _embarras des richesses_, as it would be to choose a\r\ngem or two for our drawing-room from a gallery of Watteau and Greuze, or\r\na row of Laucret's _passets_. Much as the reader, we doubt not, will\r\nenjoy those we have picked for him, he will still find equal or greater\r\npleasure in those we have left untouched.\r\n\r\nHere are the first steps in the ascent of Madame de Pompadour to that\r\n\"bad eminence\" she attained of virtual though virtueless Queen of\r\nFrance. The entire sketch is the best life of this celebrated woman with\r\nwhich we are acquainted:\r\n\r\n     \"Madame de Pompadour was born in Paris, in 1720. She always\r\n     said it was 1722. It is affirmed, that Poisson, her father, at\r\n     least the husband of her mother, was a sutler in the army; some\r\n     historians state that he was the butcher of the Hospital of the\r\n     Invalides, and was condemned to be hung; according to Voltaire,\r\n     she was the daughter of a farmer of Ferté-sous-Jouarre. What\r\n     matters it, since he who was truly a father to her was the\r\n     farmer-general, Lenormant de Tourneheim. This gentleman,\r\n     thinking her worthy of his fortune, took her to his home, and\r\n     brought her up, as if she had been his own daughter. He gave\r\n     her the name of Jeanne-Antoinette. She bore till she was\r\n     sixteen years of age this sweet name of Jeanne. From her\r\n     infancy, she exhibited a passion for music and drawing. All the\r\n     first masters of the day were summoned to the hotel of\r\n     Lenormant de Tourneheim. Her masters did not disgust Jeanne\r\n     with the fine arts of which she was so fond. Her talent was\r\n     soon widely known. Fontenelle, Duclos, and Crébillon, who were\r\n     received at the hotel as men of wit, went about every where,\r\n     talking of her beauty, her grace, and talent.\r\n\r\n     \"Madame de Pompadour was an example of a woman that was both\r\n     handsome and pretty; the lines of her face possessed all the\r\n     harmony and elevation of a creation of Raphael's; but instead\r\n     of the elevated sentiment with which that great master animated\r\n     his faces, there was the smiling expression of a Parisian\r\n     woman. She possessed in the highest degree all that gives to\r\n     the face brilliancy, charm, and sportive gayety. No lady at\r\n     court had then so noble and coquettish a bearing, such delicate\r\n     and attractive features, so elegant and graceful a figure. Her\r\n     mother used always to say, 'A king alone is worthy of my\r\n     daughter.' Jeanne had an early presentiment of a throne! at\r\n     first, from the ambitious longings of her mother; afterward,\r\n     because she believed that she was in love with the king. 'She\r\n     confessed to me,' says Voltaire, in his memoirs, 'that she had\r\n     a secret presentiment that the king would fall in love with\r\n     her, and that she had a violent inclination for him.' There is\r\n     a time in life when destiny reveals itself. All those who have\r\n     succeeded in climbing the rugged mountain of human vanity\r\n     relate that, from their earliest youth, dazzling visions\r\n     revealed to them their future glory.\r\n\r\n     \"Well, how was the throne of France to be reached, the very\r\n     idea of which made her head turn? In the mean time, full of\r\n     genius, always admired, and always listened to, she\r\n     familiarized herself with the life of a beautiful queen; she\r\n     saw at her feet all the worshippers of the fortune of her\r\n     father; she gathered about her poets, artists, and\r\n     philosophers, over whom she already threw a royal protection.\r\n\r\n     \"The farmer-general had a nephew, Lenormant d'Etioles. He was\r\n     an amiable young man, and had the character and manners of a\r\n     gentleman; he was heir to the immense fortune of the\r\n     farmer-general, at least, according to law. Jeanne, on her\r\n     side, had some claim to a share of this fortune. It was a very\r\n     simple way of making all agreed, by marrying the young people.\r\n     Jeanne, as we have seen, was already in love with the king; she\r\n     married D'Etioles without shifting her point in view:\r\n     Versailles, Versailles, that was her only horizon. Her young\r\n     husband became desperately enamored of her; but this passion of\r\n     his, which amounted almost to madness, she never felt in the\r\n     least. She received it with resignation, as a misfortune that\r\n     could not last long.\r\n\r\n     \"The hotel of the newly-married couple,\r\n     _Rue-Croix-des-Petits-Champs_, was established on a lordly\r\n     footing; the best company in Paris left the fashionable\r\n     _salons_ for that of Madame D'Etioles until that time, there\r\n     had never been such a gorgeous display of luxury in France. The\r\n     young bride hoped by this means to make something of a noise at\r\n     court, and thus excite the curiosity of the king. Day after day\r\n     passed away in feasts and brilliant entertainments. Celebrated\r\n     actors, poets, artists, and foreigners, all made their\r\n     rendezvous at this hotel, the mistress of which was its life\r\n     and ornament; all the world went there, in one word, except the\r\n     king.\"\r\n\r\nThe painters are among the pleasantest personages of Mr. Houssaye's\r\nbook, as they generally are in whatever society or whatever time we find\r\nthem, all the world over. Watteau is familiar to us all, if not from his\r\nworks, at second-hand in engravings, or those dainty little china\r\nshepherdesses and shepherds which we have seen on our grandmothers'\r\nmantel-pieces, and which are again emerging from the glass corner\r\ncupboard to the rosewood and mirrored étagère. The following passages\r\ndescriptive of his early life, are full of animation:\r\n\r\n     \"He was born in 1684, at the time the king of France was\r\n     bombarding Luxembourg. His family was poor, as a matter of\r\n     course. He was put to school just long enough not to learn any\r\n     thing. He was never able to read and write without great\r\n     difficulty, but it was not in that his strength lay. He learned\r\n     early to discover genius in a picture, to copy with a happy\r\n     touch the gay face of Nature. There had been painters in his\r\n     family, among others, a great uncle, who had died at Antwerp,\r\n     without leaving any property. The father of Watteau had little\r\n     leaning toward painting; but he was one of those who let men\r\n     and things here below take their course. Watteau, therefore,\r\n     was permitted to take his. Now Watteau was born a painter. God\r\n     had given him the fire of genius, if not genius. His first\r\n     master was chance, the greatest of all masters after God. His\r\n     father lived in the upper story of a house with its gable-end\r\n     to the street. Watteau had his nose out of the window oftener\r\n     than over a book; he loved to amuse himself with the varied\r\n     spectacle of the street. Sometimes it was the fresh-looking\r\n     Flemish peasant-girl, driving her donkey through the\r\n     market-place, sometimes the little girls of the neighborhood,\r\n     playing at shuttlecock during the fine evenings. Peasant-maid\r\n     and little child were traced in original lines in the memory of\r\n     the scholar; he already admired the indolent _naïveté_ of the\r\n     one, the prattling grace of the other. He had his eye also on\r\n     some smiling female neighbor, such as are to be found every\r\n     where; but the most attractive spectacle to him was that of\r\n     some strolling troop of dancers or country-players. On\r\n     fête-days sellers of elixirs, fortune-tellers, keepers of bears\r\n     and rattlesnakes, halted under his window. They were sure of a\r\n     spectator. Watteau suddenly fell into a profound revery at the\r\n     sight of Gilles and Margot upon the stage; nothing could divert\r\n     his attention from this amusement, not even the smile of his\r\n     female neighbor: he smiled at the grotesque coquetries of\r\n     Margot; he laughed till out of breath at the quips of Gilles.\r\n     He was frequently seen seated in the window, his legs out, his\r\n     head bent, holding on with difficulty, but not losing a word or\r\n     a gesture. What would he not have given to have been the\r\n     companion of Margot, to kiss the rusty spangles of her robe, to\r\n     live with her the happy life of careless adventure? Alas! this\r\n     happiness was not for him. Margot descended from the boards,\r\n     Gilles became a man as before, the theatre was taken down,\r\n     Watteau still on the watch; but by degrees he became sad; his\r\n     friends were departing, departing without him, with their gauze\r\n     dresses, their scarfs fringed with gold, their silver lace,\r\n     their silk breeches, and their jokes.--\"Those people are truly\r\n     happy,\" said he, \"they are going to wander gayly about the\r\n     world, to play comedy wherever they may be, without cares and\r\n     without tears!\"--Watteau, with his twelve-year-old eyes, saw\r\n     only the fair side of life. He did not guess, be it understood,\r\n     that beneath every smile of Margot there was a stifled tear.\r\n     Watteau seems to have always seen with the same eyes; his\r\n     glance, diverted by the expression and the color, did not\r\n     descend as far down as the soul. It was somewhat the fault of\r\n     his times. What had he to do while painting queens of comedy,\r\n     or dryads of the opera, with the heart, tears, or divine\r\n     sentiment?\r\n\r\n     \"After the strollers had departed, he sketched on the margins\r\n     of the 'Lives of the Saints,' the profile of Gilles, a gaping\r\n     clown, or some grotesque scene from the booth. As he often shut\r\n     himself up in his room with this book, his father, having\r\n     frequently surprised him in a dreamy and melancholy mood,\r\n     imagined that he was becoming religious. He, however, soon\r\n     discovered that Watteau's attachment to the folio was on\r\n     account of the margin, and not of the text. He carried the book\r\n     to a painter in the city. This painter, bad as he was, was\r\n     struck with the original grace of certain of Watteau's figures,\r\n     and solicited the honor of being his master. In the studio of\r\n     this worthy man, Watteau did not unlearn all that he had\r\n     acquired, although he painted for pedlers, male and female\r\n     saints by the dozen. From this studio he passed to another,\r\n     which was more profane and more to his taste. Mythology was the\r\n     great book of the place. Instead of St. Peter, with his eternal\r\n     keys, or the Magdalen, with her infinite tears, he found a\r\n     dance of fauns and naiads, Venus, issuing from the waves, or\r\n     from the net of Vulcan. Watteau bowed amorously before the gods\r\n     and demigods of Olympus; he had found the gate to his Eden. He\r\n     progressed daily, thanks to the profane gods, in the religion\r\n     of art. He was already seen to grow pale under that love of\r\n     beauty and of glory which swallows up all other loves. On his\r\n     return from a journey to Antwerp, his friends were astonished\r\n     at the enthusiasm with which he spoke of the wonders of art. He\r\n     had beheld the masterpieces of Rubens and Vandyke, the\r\n     ineffable grace of Murillo's _Virgins_, the\r\n     ingenuously-grotesque pieces of Teniers and Van Ostade, the\r\n     beautiful landscapes of Ruysdael. He returned with head bent\r\n     and eyes fatigued, and his mind filled with lasting\r\n     recollections.\r\n\r\n     \"He was not twenty when he set out for Paris with his master.\r\n     The opera, in its best days, enlisted the aid of all painters\r\n     of gracefulness. At the opera, Watteau threw the lightning\r\n     flashes of his pencil right and left: mountains, lakes,\r\n     cascades, forests, nothing dismayed him, not even the Camargos,\r\n     whom he had for models. He ended by taming himself down to this\r\n     cage of gayly-singing and fluttering birds. A dancing-girl, who\r\n     had not much to do, deigned to grant the little Flemish dauber,\r\n     the favor of sitting for her portrait. Fleming as he was,\r\n     Watteau made the progress of the portrait last longer than the\r\n     scornfulness of Mademoiselle la Montagne. This was not all: the\r\n     portrait was considered so graceful in the dancing-world, that\r\n     sitters came to him every day, on the same terms.\r\n\r\n     \"He left the opera with his master, as soon as the new\r\n     decorations were finished. Besides Gillot, the great designer\r\n     of fauns and naiads had returned there more flourishing than\r\n     ever. The master returned to Valenciennes, Watteau remained at\r\n     Paris, desiring to depend upon his fortune, good or bad. He\r\n     passed from the opera into the studio of a painter of\r\n     devotional subjects, who manufactured St. Nicholases for Paris\r\n     and the provinces, to suit to the price. So Watteau\r\n     manufactured St. Nicholases, 'My pencil,' he said, 'did\r\n     penance.' The opera always attracted him; there he could give\r\n     free scope to all the extravagance of his fancy, to all the\r\n     charming caprices of his pencil; but at the opera, his master\r\n     and himself had given way to Gillot; and the latter was not\r\n     disposed to give way to any body.\"\r\n\r\nAn allegro morceau from the life of Grétry:\r\n\r\n     A MONK OF A BAD PATTERN.\r\n\r\n     \"Other adventures also occurred, to convince Remacle that his\r\n     fellow-travellers were worthy of him. Ever in dread of the\r\n     before-mentioned officers, the old smuggler forced them to make\r\n     a _detour_ of some leagues, to see, as he said with a\r\n     disinterested air, a superb monastery, where alms were bestowed\r\n     once a week on all the poor of the country. On entering the\r\n     great hall, in the midst of a noisy crowd, Grétry saw a fat\r\n     monk, mounted on a platform, who was angrily superintending\r\n     this Christian charity. He looked as if he would like rather to\r\n     exterminate his fellow-creatures than aid them to live; he was\r\n     just bullying a poor French vagabond who implored his aid. When\r\n     he suddenly saw the noble face of Grétry he approached the\r\n     young musician.--'It is curiosity which brings you here,' he\r\n     remarked with vexation.--'It is true,' said Grétry, bowing;\r\n     'the beauty of your monastery, the sublimity of the scenery,\r\n     and the desire of contemplating the asylum where the\r\n     unfortunate traveller is received with so much humanity, have\r\n     drawn us from our route. In beholding you, I have seen the\r\n     angel of mercy. All the victims of sorrow should bless your\r\n     edifying gentleness. Tell me, father, do you make as many happy\r\n     every day as I have just witnessed?'\r\n\r\n     \"The monk, irritated by this bantering, begged Grétry to return\r\n     whence he came.--'Father,' retorted Grétry, 'have the\r\n     evangelists taught you this mode of bestowing alms, giving with\r\n     one hand and striking with the other?'--A low murmur was heard\r\n     through the hall; the monk not knowing what to say, complained\r\n     of the toothache; the cunning student lost no time, but running\r\n     up to him with an air of touching compassion, 'I am a surgeon,'\r\n     he said, as he forced him down on the bench. The monk tried to\r\n     push him off, but he held on well. 'It is Heaven which has\r\n     directed me to you, father.' Willing or not, the monk had to\r\n     open his mouth. 'Courage, father, the great saints were all\r\n     martyrs! the Saviour was crucified; and you may at least let me\r\n     pull out a tooth.' The monk struggled: 'Never, never!' he\r\n     exclaimed. The student turned with great coolness toward the\r\n     bystanders, who were all laughing in their sleeves. 'My\r\n     friends,' (he addressed crippled travellers, mountain-brigands,\r\n     and poor people of every class,) 'my friends, for the love of\r\n     God, who suffered, come and hold this good father: I do not\r\n     want him to suffer any longer!'\r\n\r\n     \"The beggars understood the joke; four of them separated from\r\n     the group, and came to the surgeon's aid. The monk struggled\r\n     furiously, but it was no use to kick and scream; he had to\r\n     submit, Grétry was not the last to come to his friend's aid;\r\n     the malicious student seized the first tooth he got hold of,\r\n     and wrenched the head of the monk by a turn of his elbow, to\r\n     the great joy of the beggars, who saw themselves revenged in a\r\n     most opportune manner. 'Well, father, what do you think of it?'\r\n     asked Grétry, after the operation; 'I am sure you do not now\r\n     suffer at all!'--The monk shook with rage; the other monks\r\n     attracted by his cries, soon arrived, but it was too late.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is among the most touching of narratives. It is\r\nexquisitely delivered:\r\n\r\n     GRÉTRY'S THREE DAUGHTERS\r\n\r\n     \"Grétry was therefore happy. Happy in his wife and children, in\r\n     his old mother, who had come to sanctify his house, with her\r\n     sweet and venerable face. Happy in fortune, happy in\r\n     reputation. The years passed quickly away! He was one day very\r\n     much astonished to learn that his daughter Jenny was fifteen.\r\n     Alas! a year afterward the poor child was no longer in the\r\n     family, neither was happiness. But for this sad history we must\r\n     return to the past. Grétry, during his sojourn at Rome, in the\r\n     spring-time of his life, was fond of seeking religious\r\n     inspiration in the garden of an almost deserted convent. He\r\n     observed one day, in the summer-house, an old monk of venerable\r\n     form, who was separating seeds with a meditative air, and at\r\n     the same time observing them with a microscope. The\r\n     absent-minded musician approached him in silence. 'Do you like\r\n     flowers?' the monk asked him. 'Very much,' 'At your age,\r\n     however, we only cultivate the flowers of life; the culture of\r\n     the flowers of earth is pleasing only to the man who has\r\n     fulfilled his task. It is then almost like cultivating his\r\n     recollection. The flowers recall the birth, the natal land, the\r\n     garden of the family, and what more? You know better than I who\r\n     have thrown to forgetfulness all worldly enjoyments!' 'I do not\r\n     see, father,' replied Grétry, 'why you separate these seeds\r\n     which seem to me to be all alike. 'Look through this\r\n     microscope, and see this black speck on those which I place\r\n     aside; but I wish to carry the horticultural lesson still\r\n     further.' He took a flower-pot, made six holes in the earth,\r\n     and planted three of the good seeds, and three of the spotted\r\n     ones. 'Recollect that the bad ones are on the side of the\r\n     crack, and when you come and take a walk, do not forget to\r\n     watch the stalks as they grow.'\r\n\r\n     \"Grétry found a melancholy charm in returning frequently to the\r\n     garden of the convent. As he passed, he each time cast a glance\r\n     on the old flower-pot. The six stems at first shot up, each\r\n     equally verdant. The spotted seeds soon grew the longest, to\r\n     his great surprise. He was about to accuse the old monk of\r\n     having lost his wits; but what was afterwards his sorrow, when\r\n     he saw his three plants gradually fading away in their\r\n     spring-time! With each setting sun a leaf fell and dried up,\r\n     while the leaves of the other stems thrived more and more with\r\n     every breeze, every ray of the sun, every drop of dew. He went\r\n     to dream every day before his dear plants, with exceeding\r\n     sadness. He soon saw them wither away, even to the last leaf.\r\n     On the same day the others were in flower.\r\n\r\n     \"This accident of nature was a cruel horoscope. Thirty years\r\n     afterward poor Grétry saw three other flowers alike fated, fade\r\n     and fall under the wintry wind of death. He had forgotten the\r\n     name of the flowers of the Roman convent, but in dying he still\r\n     repeated the names of the others. They were his three\r\n     daughters, Jenny, Lucile, and Antoinette. 'Ah!' exclaimed the\r\n     poor musician, in relating the death of his three daughters,\r\n     'I have violated the laws of nature to obtain genius. I have\r\n     watered with my blood the most frivolous of my operas, I have\r\n     nourished my old mother, I have seized on reputation by\r\n     exhausting my heart and my soul; Nature has avenged herself on\r\n     my children! My poor children, I foredoomed them to death!'\r\n\r\n     \"Grétry's daughters all died at the age of sixteen. There is\r\n     something strange in their life and in their death, which\r\n     strikes the dreamer and the poet. This sport of destiny, this\r\n     freak of death, this vengeance of Nature, appears here invested\r\n     with all the charms of romance. You will see.\r\n\r\n     \"Jenny had the pale, sweet countenance of a virgin. On seeing\r\n     her, Greuze said one day, 'If I ever paint Purity, I shall\r\n     paint Jenny.' 'Make haste!' murmured Grétry, already a prey to\r\n     sad presentiments. 'Then she is going to be married?' said\r\n     Greuze. Grétry did not answer. Soon, however, seeking to blind\r\n     himself, he continued: 'She will be the staff of my old age;\r\n     like Antigone, she will lead her father into the sun at the\r\n     decline of life.'\r\n\r\n     \"The next day Grétry came unexpectedly upon Jenny, looking more\r\n     pale and depressed than ever. She was playing on the\r\n     harpischord, but sweetly and slowly. As she was playing an air\r\n     from _Richard Coeur-de-Lion_, in a melancholy strain, the\r\n     poor father fancied that he was listening to the music of\r\n     angels. One of her friends entered. 'Well, Jenny, you are going\r\n     to-night to the ball?' 'Yes, yes, to the ball,' answered poor\r\n     Jenny, looking toward heaven; and suddenly resuming, 'No, I\r\n     shall not go, my dance is ended.' Grétry pressed his daughter\r\n     to his heart, 'Jenny, are you suffering?' 'It is over!' said\r\n     she.\r\n\r\n     \"She bent her head and died instantly, without a struggle! Poor\r\n     Grétry asked if she was asleep. She slept with the angels.\r\n\r\n     \"Lucile was a contrast to Jenny; she was a beautiful girl, gay,\r\n     enthusiastic, and frolicksome, with all the caprices of such a\r\n     disposition. She was almost a portrait of her father, and\r\n     possessed, besides, the same heart and the same mind. 'Who\r\n     knows,' said poor Grétry, 'but that her gayety may save her.'\r\n     She was unfortunately one of those precocious geniuses who\r\n     devour their youth. At thirteen she had composed an opera which\r\n     was played every where, _Le Marriage d'Antonio_. A journalist,\r\n     a friend of Grétry, who one day found himself in Lucile's\r\n     apartment, without her being aware of it, so much was she\r\n     engrossed with her harp, has related the rage and madness which\r\n     transported her during her contests with inspiration, that was\r\n     often rebellious. 'She wept, she sang, she struck the harp with\r\n     incredible energy. She either did not see me, or took no notice\r\n     of me; for my own part, I wept with joy, in beholding this\r\n     little girl transported with so glorious a zeal, and so noble\r\n     an enthusiasm for music.'\r\n\r\n     \"Lucile had learned to read music before she knew her alphabet.\r\n     She had been so long lulled to sleep with Grétry's airs, that\r\n     at the age when so many other young girls think only of hoops\r\n     and dolls, she had found sufficient music in her soul for the\r\n     whole of a charming opera. She was a prodigy. Had it not been\r\n     for death, who came to seize her at sixteen like her sister,\r\n     the greatest musician of the eighteenth century would, perhaps,\r\n     have been a woman. But the twig, scarcely green, snapped at the\r\n     moment when the poor bird commenced her song. Grétry had Lucile\r\n     married at the solicitation of his friends. 'Marry her, marry\r\n     her,' they incessantly repeated; 'if Love has the start of\r\n     Death, Lucile is safe.' Lucile suffered herself to be married\r\n     with the resignation of an angel, foreseeing that the marriage\r\n     would not be of long duration. She suffered herself to be\r\n     married to one of those artists of the worst order, who have\r\n     neither the religion of art nor the fire of genius, and who\r\n     have still less heart, for the heart is the home of genius. The\r\n     poor Lucile saw at a glance the desert to which her family had\r\n     exiled her. She consoled herself with a harp and a harpsichord;\r\n     but her husband, who had been brought up like a slave, cruelly\r\n     took delight, with a coward's vengeance, in making her feel all\r\n     the chains of Hymen. She would have died, like Jenny, on her\r\n     father's bosom, amidst her loving family, after having sung her\r\n     farewell song; but thanks to this barbarous fellow, she died in\r\n     his presence, that is to say, alone. At the hour of her death,\r\n     'Bring me my harp!' said she, raising herself a little. 'The\r\n     doctor has forbidden it,' said this savage. She cast a bitter,\r\n     yet a suppliant look upon him. 'But as I am dying!' said she.\r\n     'You will die very well without that.' She fell back on her\r\n     pillow. 'My poor father,' murmured she, 'I wished to bid you\r\n     adieu on my harp; but here I am not free except to die!'\r\n     Lucile, it is the nurse who related the scene, suddenly\r\n     extended her arms, called Jenny with a broken voice, and fell\r\n     asleep like her for ever.\r\n\r\n     \"Antoinette was sixteen. She was fair and smiling like the\r\n     morn, but she was fated to die like the others. Grétry prayed\r\n     and wept, as he saw her growing pale; but death was not stopped\r\n     so easily. _Cruel that he is, he stops his ears, there is no\r\n     use to pray to him!_ Grétry, however, still hoped. 'God,' said\r\n     he, 'will be touched by my thrice bitter tears.' He almost\r\n     abandoned music, in order to have more time to consecrate to\r\n     his dear Antoinette. He anticipated all her fancies, dresses,\r\n     and ornaments, books and excursions,--in a word, she enjoyed to\r\n     her heart's desire every pleasure the world could afford. At\r\n     each new toy she smiled with that divine smile which seems\r\n     formed for heaven. Grétry succeeded in deceiving himself; but\r\n     she one day revealed to him all her ill-fortune in these words,\r\n     which accidentally escaped from her: 'My godmother died on the\r\n     scaffold: she was a godmother of bad augury, Jenny died at\r\n     sixteen, Lucile died at sixteen, and I am now sixteen myself.'\r\n     The godmother of Antoinette was the queen Maria Antoinette.\r\n\r\n     \"Another day, Antoinette was meditating over a pink at the\r\n     window. On seeing her with this flower in her hand, Grétry\r\n     imagined that the poor girl was suffering herself to be carried\r\n     away by a dream of love. It was the dream of death! He soon\r\n     heard Antoinette murmur; '_I shall die this spring, this\r\n     summer, this autumn, this winter!_' She was at the last leaf.\r\n     'So much the worse,' she said; 'I should like the autumn\r\n     better.' 'What do you say, my dear angel?' said Grétry,\r\n     pressing her to his heart. 'Nothing, nothing! I was playing\r\n     with death; why do you not let the children play?'\r\n\r\n     \"Grétry thought that a southern journey would be a beneficial\r\n     change; he took his daughter to Lyons, where she had friends.\r\n     For a short time she returned to her gay and careless manner.\r\n     Grétry went to work again, and finished _Guillaume Tell_. He\r\n     went every morning, in search of inspiration, to the chamber of\r\n     his daughter, who said to him one day, on awaking: 'Your music\r\n     has always the odor of a poem; this will have that of wild\r\n     thyme.'\r\n\r\n     \"Towards autumn, she again lost her natural gayety. Grétry took\r\n     his wife aside--'You see your daughter,' said he to her. At\r\n     this single word, an icy shudder seized both. They shed a\r\n     torrent of tears. The same day they thought of returning to\r\n     Paris. 'So we are to go back to Paris', said Antoinette; 'it is\r\n     well. I shall rejoin there those whom I love.' She spoke of her\r\n     sisters. After reaching Paris, the poor, fated girl concealed\r\n     all the ravages of death with care; her heart was sad, but her\r\n     lips were smiling. She wished to conceal the truth from her\r\n     father to the end. One day, while she was weeping and hiding\r\n     her tears, she said to him with an air of gayety: 'You know\r\n     that I am going to the ball to-morrow, and I want to appear\r\n     well-dressed there. I want a pearl necklace, and shall look for\r\n     it when I wake up to-morrow morning.'\r\n\r\n     \"She went to the ball. As she set out with her mother, Rouget\r\n     Delisle, a musician more celebrated at that time than Grétry,\r\n     said rapturously: 'Ah, Grétry, you are a happy man! What a\r\n     charming girl! what sweetness and grace!' 'Yes,' said Grétry,\r\n     in a whisper, 'she is beautiful and still more amiable; she is\r\n     going to the ball, but in a few weeks we shall follow her\r\n     together to the cemetery!' 'What a horrible idea! You are\r\n     losing your senses!' 'Would I were not losing my heart! I had\r\n     three daughters; she is the only left to me, but already I must\r\n     weep for her!'\r\n\r\n     \"A few days after this ball, she took to her bed, and fell into\r\n     a sad but beautiful delirium. She had found her sisters again\r\n     in this world; she walked with them hand in hand; she waltzed\r\n     in the same saloon; she danced in the same quadrille; she took\r\n     them to the play: all the while recounting to them her\r\n     imaginary loves. What a picture for Grétry! 'She had,' he says\r\n     in his _Memoirs_, some serene moments before death.--She took\r\n     my hand, and that of her mother, and with a sweet smile, 'I see\r\n     well,' she murmured, 'that we must bear our destiny; I do not\r\n     fear death; but what is to become of you two?' She was propped\r\n     up by her pillow while she spoke with us for the last time. She\r\n     was laid back, then closed her beautiful eyes, and went to join\r\n     her sisters!\r\n\r\n     \"Grétry is very eloquent in his grief. There Is in this part of\r\n     his Memoirs a cry which came from his heart, and wrings our\r\n     own. 'Oh, my friends,' he exclaims, throwing down the pen, 'a\r\n     tear, a tear upon the beloved tomb of my three lovely flowers,\r\n     predestined to die, like those of the good Italian monk.'\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA MODEL TRAVELLER.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the most readable of living travellers is certainly our own\r\nBAYARD TAYLOR, who is now somewhere in the interior of the African\r\ncontinent, and whose letters in the _Tribune_ are every where perused\r\nwith the greatest satisfaction. Worthy to be named along with him is the\r\nGerman, FREDERICK GERSTÄCKER, whose adventures form one of the most\r\ninteresting features in that cyclopediac journal, the Augsburg\r\n_Allgemeine Zeitung_. It is now some two years since Gerstäcker set out\r\nupon his present explorations. The backwoods of the United States\r\nfurnished a broad field for his love of a wild and changeful life, and\r\ngave full play to his passion for the study of human character in all\r\nits out of the way phases. His accounts of these regions were touched\r\nwith the most vivid colors; not Cooper nor Irving has more truly\r\nreproduced the grand and savage features of American scenery, or the\r\nreckless generous daring of the rude backwoodsman, than Gerstäcker,\r\nwriting, from some chance hut, his nocturnal landing place on the shore\r\nof some mighty river in Nebraska or Arkansas. Next we hear of him in\r\nSouth America, and then in California, passing a winter among the miners\r\nof the remotest districts, digging gold, hunting, trafficking, fighting\r\nin case of need like the rest, and every where sending home the most\r\nlively daguerreotypes of the country, the people, and his own adventures\r\namong them. Finally, having seen all that was in California, he takes\r\npassage for the Sandwich Islands, where he remains long enough to\r\nexhaust all the romance remaining, and to gather every sort of useful\r\ninformation. From there he set out upon an indefinite voyage on board of\r\na whaler going to the Southern seas in search of oil. Chance, however,\r\nbrings him up at Australia: and he at once sets about travelling through\r\nthe settled portions of the Continent, taking the luck of the day every\r\nwhere with exhaustless good humour, and never getting low spirited, no\r\nmatter how untoward the mishaps encountered. Less elegant and poetic\r\nthan Taylor, he dashes ahead with a more perfect indifference to\r\nconsequences, and a more utter reliance on coming out all right in the\r\nend. In his last letter, he gives an account of a voyage in a canoe from\r\nAlbury, on the upper waters of Hume River, down to Melbourne, at its\r\nmouth. He had got out of funds, and was thus obliged to set out on this\r\nroute contrary to the advice of the settlers at Albury, who represented\r\nto him that the danger of being killed and eaten by the natives along\r\nshore, who had never come in contact with whites, was inevitable, and\r\nthat they would be sure to destroy him before he reached his\r\ndestination. This was, however, only an additional inducement to the\r\ntrip. While making preparations for it, he fell in with a young\r\nfellow-countryman in the settlement, who desired to make the same\r\njourney, and who was willing to encounter the risks of the river rather\r\nthan pay the heavy expenses of the trip by land. They accordingly\r\nproceeded to dig a canoe out of a caoutchouc tree, furnished themselves\r\nwith paddles, a frying-pan, blankets, some crackers, sugar, salt, tea,\r\nand powder, and embarked. The river was shallow, and full of windings\r\nand sandbanks, sunken caoutchouc trees had planted the stream with\r\nfrequent snags, and often heavy masses of fallen timber, still adhering\r\nto the earth at its roots, and thus preserving its vitality, and\r\nflourishing with all the luxuriance of a primitive tropical forest,\r\ncovered the only part of the channel where the water was deep enough to\r\nadmit of the passage of their canoe. Thus they toiled on day by day,\r\noften getting out into the water to help their vessel over shallows, or\r\nto pick up the ducks that Gerstäcker shot, which furnished the only meat\r\nfor their daily meals. Cloudy or fair, cold or warm, rain or sunshine,\r\nfound Gerstäcker still in the same flow of spirits, and the notes of his\r\ndaily experiences show him bearing ill-luck almost as gaily as good.\r\nAfter they had gone some 400 miles, however, their journey by the river\r\ncame to a sudden end by the oversetting of their canoe, and the loss of\r\nalmost all their equipments. Gerstäcker saved his rifle and the\r\nammunition that was upon his person; but the remaining powder was\r\nspoiled, and the provisions and part of the blankets and clothing were\r\ncarried away by the current. The canoe sunk, but by holding upon the\r\nrope as they jumped out upon the overhanging trunks of trees, the\r\nvoyagers succeeded in dragging it up again, and freeing it from water.\r\nThen one of them dived to the bottom, and managed to bring up the\r\nfrying-pan and tea-canister. They also recovered part of their blankets,\r\nand then, with the frying-pan for their sole paddle, renewed their\r\nvoyage till they found a good camping-place, where they built a roaring\r\nfire to dry themselves, and finally discovered that in the operations of\r\nthe day each had utterly ruined his shoes, so that they were afterwards\r\nforced to go barefoot. In this way they continued for some days,\r\npaddling with their frying-pan, and going ashore to get a duck\r\noccasionally shot by Gerstäcker. This was often exceedingly painful,\r\nfrom the stubble of the grass along the banks, burnt over by fires\r\naccidentally set by the natives. Luckily, through the whole they did not\r\ncome in contact with the savages at all. At last they reached a\r\nsettlement, where they swapped their canoe for a couple pair of shoes,\r\nand started on foot for the rest of the way. Gerstäcker had for some\r\ntime desired to get rid of his companion, who was wilful, and by no\r\nmeans a helper in their difficulties. They now came to Woolshed, a place\r\n180 miles distant from Melbourne, whence there were two roads to their\r\ndestination; the one was perfectly free from the savages, the other was\r\ndangerous. Here Gerstäcker separated from his companion, giving him the\r\nsafe road, and, with his rifle on his arm and his knapsack slung upon\r\nhis shoulders, struck off alone into the forest-path light-hearted as a\r\nboy, and sure, whatever might happen, of enjoying a fresher and\r\nhealthier excitement in that journey through the woods of Australia than\r\nthe dwellers in crowded cities enjoy in all their lives.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA MYSTERIOUS HISTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\nParis, says the _Independence Belge_, the leading journal of Brussels,\r\nis now occupied not with politics so much as with ghost stories. At the\r\ntheatres, the _Vampyre_ and the _Imagier de Harlaem_, feed this appetite\r\nfor supernatural horrors. Among other incidents of that kind, says the\r\n_Independance_, the following narrative was told to the company in the\r\n_salon_ of an aristocratic Polish lady by the Comte de R----. He had\r\npromised to tell a recent adventure with an inhabitant of the other\r\nworld, and when the clock struck midnight he began, while his auditors\r\ngathered around him in breathless attention. His story we translate for\r\nthe _International_:--\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of last December, one of his friends, the Marquis de\r\nN., came to see him. \"You know, Count,\" said the Marquis, \"what an\r\ninvincible repugnance I feel against returning to my chateau in\r\nNormandy, where I had last summer the misfortune to lose my wife. But I\r\nleft there in a writing desk some important papers, which now happen to\r\nbe indispensable in a matter of family business. Here is the key; do me\r\nthe kindness to go and get the papers, for so delicate a mission I can\r\nonly intrust to you.\" M. de R. agreed to the request of his friend, and\r\nset out the following day. He stopped at a station on the Rouen\r\nrailroad, whence a drive of two hours brought him to his friend's house.\r\nHe stopped before it, and a gardener came out and spoke with him through\r\nthe latticed iron gate, which he did not open. The Count was surprised\r\nat this distrust, which even a card of admission from the proprietor of\r\nthe chateau did not overcome. Finally, after a brief absence, which\r\nseemed to have been employed in seeking the advice of some one within,\r\nthe gardener came back and opened the gate. When the Count entered the\r\ncourt-yard he saw that the blinds on the hundred windows of the chateau\r\nwere all closed, with one exception, where the blind had fallen off and\r\nlay upon the ground. As he afterwards discovered, this window was\r\nexactly in the middle of the chamber where his commission was to be\r\nexecuted.\r\n\r\nThe Count's attention had been excited by his singular reception, and he\r\ncarefully observed every thing. He noticed a small stove-pipe leading\r\ninto a chimney. \"Is the house inhabited?\" he inquired. \"No,\" replied the\r\ngardener, gruffly, as he opened a door upon a side stairway, which he\r\nmounted before the Count, opening at each story the little apertures for\r\nlight in the queer old fashioned front of the chateau.\r\n\r\nIn the third story, the gardener stopped, and pointing to a door, said,\r\n\"There.\" And without adding a word he turned about and went down stairs.\r\nThe Count opened the door and found himself in a dark ante-chamber. The\r\nlight from the stairway was sufficient, however, for him to distinguish\r\na second door, which he opened, and through which he went into the\r\napartment lighted from the window whence the blind had fallen. The\r\nappearance of the room was cold, bare, and deserted. On the floor stood\r\na vacant bird-cage. The writing-desk indicated to the Count by his\r\nfriend, stood directly opposite the window. Without further delay, the\r\nCount went directly up to the desk and opened it.\r\n\r\nAs he turned the key, the lock creaked very loudly, but at the same\r\nmoment he was aware of another and a different sound--that of a door\r\nopening. The Count turns, and in the centre of an obscure side-room,\r\nwhose door was open, he sees a white figure, with its arms stretched\r\ntoward him.\r\n\r\n\"Count!\" exclaims a low but most expressive voice, \"you come to rob me\r\nof Theodore's letters? Why?\"\r\n\r\n(Theodore is not the name of the proprietor of the chateau, at whose\r\nrequest the Count had come.)\r\n\r\n\"Madame!\" exclaims M. de R., \"who are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you not know me, much as I must be altered?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Marchioness!\" exclaims the Count, astounded and even terrified.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is me. We were friends once, and now you come to add terribly\r\nto my sufferings! Who sends you? My husband? What does he yet desire? In\r\nmercy leave me the letters!\"\r\n\r\nWhile she said this, the figure made signs to the Count to come nearer.\r\nHe obeyed, forcing from his mind every suggestion that the apparition\r\nwas supernatural, and finally convinced that the Marchioness stood\r\nbefore him living, under some strange mystery. He followed her into the\r\nsecond room.\r\n\r\nShe was dressed in a robe, or more properly, a shroud of a gray color.\r\nHer beautiful hair, which had for years been the envy of all other\r\nwomen, fell in disorder upon her shoulders. The vague light, which came\r\nin from the adjoining room, was just enough for the Count to remark the\r\nextraordinary thinness and deathly pallor of the Marchioness.\r\n\r\nHardly had he come near her, when she said to him, quickly, almost with\r\nvehemence:\r\n\r\n\"I suffer from incredible pains in my head. The cause is in my\r\nhair,--for eight months it has not been combed. Count, do me this\r\nservice--comb it!\"\r\n\r\nAfter she had sat down, she reached a comb to M. de R., who\r\ninvoluntarily obeyed her. She did not speak again, and he did not dare\r\nto. As he confesses, he was greatly agitated. Without doubt he performed\r\nhis office of waiting-maid badly, for from time to time the lady uttered\r\na slight murmur of complaint.\r\n\r\nSuddenly she rose, said \"Merci!\" and vanished in the gloom at the end of\r\nthe chamber. The Count waited a few moments, vainly stretching his\r\nsenses, but saw and heard nothing more. Then he resolved to return into\r\nthe first room. When his eyes fell upon the writing-desk, he perceived\r\nthat its contents were in the greatest confusion. However, he found the\r\nfamily papers that he had been sent for. After he had closed the desk\r\nagain he waited a few moments; he called, but there was no answer.\r\nFinally he went down stairs, and as he said himself, with steps that did\r\nnot linger.\r\n\r\nThere was no one in the court-yard. Before the iron gate was the\r\ncoachman ready to start. M. de R. saw no reason for tarrying longer. On\r\nthe returning way, as he was seeking to collect his thoughts upon the\r\nstrange event in the chateau, he perceived that his clothes were covered\r\nwith the Marchioness's hair.\r\n\r\nHe stopped at Rouen, and two days after returned to Paris. It was the\r\nthird of December. He sought for the Marquis, but could not find him. It\r\nis now thought he must have fallen in the firing on the Boulevard\r\nMontmartre, where his club is situated.\r\n\r\nSuch is the narrative which M. de R. had promised to tell in the _salon_\r\nof the old Polish lady, where he was waited for till midnight. He came\r\njust as the company were about separating, and showed the hairs of the\r\nMarchioness. One of them lies on the table before me.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEDWARD EVERETT AND DANIEL WEBSTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe some time expected new edition of _The Speeches, Forensic Arguments,\r\nand Diplomatic Papers_ of DANIEL WEBSTER, has just appeared, in six\r\nlarge and beautifully printed volumes, from the press of Little & Brown,\r\nof Boston. The editorial supervision of the work was undertaken by\r\nEDWARD EVERETT, who has prefixed to the first volume a brief memoir of\r\nthe illustrious statesman, orator, and author, from the beginning and\r\nthe end of which we copy a few important paragraphs. Respecting the past\r\nand present collections of these great compositions, Mr. Everett says:\r\n\r\n     \"The first collection of Mr. Webster's speeches in the Congress\r\n     of the United States and on various public occasions, was\r\n     published in Boston in one volume octavo, in 1830. This volume\r\n     was more than once reprinted, and in 1835 a second volume was\r\n     published, containing the speeches made up to that time, and\r\n     not included in the first collection. Several impressions of\r\n     these two volumes were called for by the public. In 1843 a\r\n     third volume was prepared, containing a selection from the\r\n     speeches of Mr. Webster from the year 1835 till his entrance\r\n     into the cabinet of General Harrison. In the year 1848 appeared\r\n     a fourth volume of diplomatic papers, containing a portion of\r\n     Mr. Webster's official correspondence as Secretary of State.\r\n     The great favor with which these volumes' have been received\r\n     throughout the country, and the importance of the subjects\r\n     discussed in the Senate of the United States after Mr.\r\n     Webster's return to that body in 1845, have led his friends to\r\n     think that a valuable service would be rendered to the\r\n     community by bringing together his speeches of a later date\r\n     than those contained in the third volume of the former\r\n     collection, and on political subjects arising since that time.\r\n     Few periods of our history will be entitled to be remembered by\r\n     events of greater moment, such as the admission of Texas to the\r\n     Union, the settlement of the Oregon controversy, the Mexican\r\n     war, the acquisition of California and other Mexican provinces,\r\n     and the exciting questions which have grown out of the sudden\r\n     extension of the territory of the United States. Rarely have\r\n     public discussions been carried on with greater earnestness,\r\n     with more important consequences visibly at stake, or with\r\n     greater ability. The speeches made by Mr. Webster in the\r\n     Senate, and on public occasions of various kinds, during the\r\n     progress of these controversies, are more than sufficient to\r\n     fill two new volumes. The opportunity of their collection has\r\n     been taken by the enterprising publishers, in compliance with\r\n     opinions often expressed by the most respectable individuals,\r\n     and with a manifest public demand, to bring out a new edition\r\n     of Mr. Webster's speeches in uniform style. Such is the object\r\n     of the present publication. The first two volumes contain the\r\n     speeches delivered by him on a great variety of public\r\n     occasions, commencing with his discourse at Plymouth in\r\n     December, 1820. Three succeeding volumes embrace the greater\r\n     part of the speeches delivered in the Massachusetts Convention\r\n     and in the two houses of Congress, beginning with the speech on\r\n     the Bank of the United States in 1816. The sixth and last\r\n     volume contains the legal arguments and addresses to the jury,\r\n     the diplomatic papers, and letters addressed to various persons\r\n     on important political questions.\r\n\r\n     \"The collection does not embrace the entire series of Mr.\r\n     Webster's writings. Such a series would have required a larger\r\n     number of volumes than was deemed advisable with reference to\r\n     the general circulation of the work. A few juvenile\r\n     performances have accordingly been omitted, as not of\r\n     sufficient importance or maturity to be included in the\r\n     collection. Of the earlier speeches in Congress, some were\r\n     either not reported at all, or in a manner too imperfect to be\r\n     preserved without doing injustice to the author. No attempt has\r\n     been made to collect from the cotemporaneous newspapers or\r\n     Congressional registers, the short conversational speeches and\r\n     remarks made by Mr. Webster, as by other members of Congress,\r\n     in the progress of debate, and sometimes exercising greater\r\n     influence on the result than the set speeches. Of the addresses\r\n     to public meetings it has been found impossible to embrace more\r\n     than a selection, without swelling the work to an unreasonable\r\n     size. It is believed, however, that the contents of these\r\n     volumes furnish a fair specimen of Mr. Webster's opinions and\r\n     sentiments on all the subjects treated, and of his manner of\r\n     discussing them. The responsibility of deciding what should be\r\n     omitted and what included, has been left by Mr. Webster to the\r\n     friends having the charge of the publication, and his own\r\n     opinion on details of this kind has rarely been taken.\"\r\n\r\nThis incompleteness, we think, will be regretted by all the parties most\r\ndeeply interested, as well as by the public generally. Mr. Webster does\r\nnot often repeat himself, and no man who has said or written so much has\r\nsaid or written so little that is undeserving a place in literature or\r\nin history. The next paragraph introduces us to Mr. Webster's\r\nbirthplace, and to his father:\r\n\r\n     \"The interval between the peace of 1763 and the breaking out of\r\n     the war of the Revolution, was one of excitement and anxiety\r\n     throughout the Colonies. The great political questions of the\r\n     day were not only discussed in the towns and cities, but in the\r\n     villages and hamlets. Captain Webster took a deep interest in\r\n     those discussions. Like so many of the officers and soldiers of\r\n     the former war, he obeyed the first call to arms in the new\r\n     struggle. He commanded a company chiefly composed of his own\r\n     townspeople, friends, and kindred, who followed him through the\r\n     greater portion of the war. He was at the battle of White\r\n     Plains, and was at West Point when the treason of Arnold was\r\n     discovered. He acted as a Major under Stark at Bennington, and\r\n     contributed his share to the success of that eventful day. In\r\n     the last year of the Revolutionary war on the 18th of January,\r\n     1782, Daniel Webster was born, in the home which his father had\r\n     established on the outskirts of civilization. If the character\r\n     and situation of the place, and the circumstances under which\r\n     he passed the first year of his life, might seem adverse to the\r\n     early cultivation of his extraordinary talent, it still cannot\r\n     be doubted that they possessed influences favorable to\r\n     elevation and strength of character. The hardships of an infant\r\n     settlement and border life, the traditions of a long series of\r\n     Indian wars, and of two mighty national contests, in which an\r\n     honored parent had borne his part, the anecdotes of Fort\r\n     William Henry, of Quebec, of Bennington, of West Point, of\r\n     Wolfe, and Stark, and Washington, the great Iliad and Odyssey\r\n     of American Independence,--this was the fireside entertainment\r\n     of the long winter evenings of the secluded village home.\r\n     Abroad, the uninviting landscape, the harsh and craggy outlines\r\n     of the hills broken and relieved only by the funereal hemlock\r\n     and the 'cloud-seeking' pine, the lowlands traversed in every\r\n     direction by unbridged streams, the tall, charred trunks in the\r\n     cornfields, that told how stern had been the struggle with the\r\n     boundless woods, and, at the close of the year, the dismal\r\n     scene which presents itself in high latitudes in a thinly\r\n     settled region, when\r\n\r\n         'The snows descend; and, foul and fierce,\r\n         All winter drives along the darkened air'--\r\n\r\n     these are circumstances to leave an abiding impression on the\r\n     mind of a thoughtful child, and induce an early maturity of\r\n     character.\"\r\n\r\nOf his early professional life, and of some of his contemporaries, Mr.\r\nEverett says:\r\n\r\n     \"Immediately on his admission to the bar, Mr. Webster went to\r\n     Amherst, in New Hampshire, where his father's court was in\r\n     session; from that place he went home with his father. He had\r\n     intended to establish himself at Portsmouth, which, as the\r\n     largest town and the seat of the foreign commerce of the State,\r\n     opened the widest field for practice. But filial duty kept him\r\n     nearer home. His father was now infirm from the advance of\r\n     years, and had no other son at home. Under these circumstances\r\n     Mr. Webster opened an office at Boscawen not far from his\r\n     father's residence, and commenced the practice of the law in\r\n     this retired spot. Judge Webster lived but a year after his\r\n     son's entrance upon the practice of his profession; long\r\n     enough, however, to hear his first argument in court, and to be\r\n     gratified with the confident predictions of his future success.\r\n\r\n     \"In May, 1807, Mr. Webster was admitted an attorney and\r\n     counsellor of the Superior Court in New Hampshire, and in\r\n     September of that year, relinquishing his office in Boscawen to\r\n     his Brother Ezekiel, he removed to Portsmouth, in conformity\r\n     with his original intention. Here he remained in the practice\r\n     of his profession for nine successive years. They were years of\r\n     assiduous labor, and of unremitted devotion to the study and\r\n     practice of the law. He was associated with several persons of\r\n     great eminence, citizens of New Hampshire or of Massachusetts,\r\n     occasionally practising at the Portsmouth bar. Among the latter\r\n     were Samuel Dexter and Joseph Storey; of the residents of New\r\n     Hampshire, Jeremiah Mason was the most distinguished.\r\n\r\n     \"During the greater part of Mr. Webster's practice of the law\r\n     in New Hampshire, Jeremiah Smith was Chief Justice of the\r\n     state, a learned and excellent judge, whose biography has been\r\n     written by the Rev. John H. Morrison, and will well repay\r\n     perusal. Judge Smith was an early and warm friend of Judge\r\n     Webster, and this friendship descended to the son, and glowed\r\n     in his breast with fervor till he went to his grave. Although\r\n     dividing with Mr. Mason the best of the business of Portsmouth,\r\n     and indeed of all the eastern portion of the State, Mr.\r\n     Webster's practice was mostly on the circuit. He followed the\r\n     Superior Court through the principal counties of the state, and\r\n     was retained in nearly every important cause. It is mentioned\r\n     by Mr. March, as a somewhat singular fact in his professional\r\n     life, that, with the exception of the occasions on which he has\r\n     been associated with the Attorney-General of the United States\r\n     for the time being, he has hardly appeared ten times as junior\r\n     counsel. Within the sphere in which he was placed, he may be\r\n     said to have risen at once to the head of his profession; not,\r\n     however, like Erskine and some other celebrated British\r\n     lawyers, by one and the same bound, at once to fame and\r\n     fortune. The American bar holds forth no such golden prizes,\r\n     certainly not in the smaller states. Mr. Webster's practice in\r\n     New Hampshire, though probably as good as that of any of his\r\n     contemporaries, was never lucrative. Clients were not very\r\n     rich, nor the concerns litigated such as would carry heavy\r\n     fees. Although exclusively devoted to his profession, it\r\n     afforded him no more than a bare livelihood. But the time for\r\n     which he practised at the New Hampshire bar was probably not\r\n     lost with reference to his future professional and political\r\n     eminence. His own standard of legal attainment was high. He was\r\n     associated with professional brethren fully competent to put\r\n     his powers to their best proof, and to prevent him from\r\n     settling down in early life into an easy routine of ordinary\r\n     professional practice. It was no disadvantage under these\r\n     circumstances (except in reference to immediate pecuniary\r\n     benefit), to enjoy some portion of that leisure for general\r\n     reading, which is almost wholly denied to the lawyer of\r\n     commanding talents, who steps immediately into full practice in\r\n     a large city.\"\r\n\r\nThe memoir, which extends through nine chapters, comprising a survey of\r\nthe intellectual and political life of Mr. Webster, down to the last\r\nyear, ends as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"Such, in a brief and imperfect narrative, is the public life\r\n     of Mr. Webster, extending over a period of forty years, marked\r\n     by the occurrence of events of great importance. It has been\r\n     the aim of the writer to prevent the pen of the biographer from\r\n     being too much influenced by the partiality of the friend.\r\n     Should he seem to the candid not wholly to have escaped that\r\n     error, (which, however, he trusts will not be the case,) he\r\n     ventures to hope that it will be forgiven to an intimacy which\r\n     commenced in the youth of one of the parties and the boyhood of\r\n     the other, and which has subsisted for nearly half a century.\r\n     It will be admitted, he thinks, by every one, that this career,\r\n     however inadequately delineated, has been one of singular\r\n     eminence and brilliancy. Entering upon public life at the close\r\n     of the first epoch in the political history of the United\r\n     States under the present Constitution, Mr. Webster has stood\r\n     below none of the distinguished men who have impressed their\r\n     character on the second.\r\n\r\n     \"There is a class of public questions in reference to which the\r\n     opinions of most men are greatly influenced by prejudices\r\n     founded in natural temperament, early associations, and real or\r\n     supposed local interest. As far as such questions are\r\n     concerned, it is too much to hope that, in times of high party\r\n     excitement, full justice will be done to prominent statesmen by\r\n     those of their contemporaries who differ from them. We greatly\r\n     err, however, if candid men of all parties, and in all parts of\r\n     the country, do not accord to Mr. Webster the praise of having\r\n     formed to himself a large and generous view of the character of\r\n     an American statesman, and of having adopted the loftiest\r\n     standard of public conduct. They will agree that he has\r\n     conceived, in all its importance, the position of the country\r\n     as a member of the great family of nations, and as the leading\r\n     republican government. In reference to domestic politics it\r\n     will be as generally conceded, that, reposing less than most\r\n     public men on a party basis, it has been the main object of his\r\n     life to confirm and perpetuate the great work of the\r\n     constitutional fathers of the last generation. By their wisdom\r\n     and patriotic forethought we are blessed with a system in which\r\n     the several states are brought into a union so admirably\r\n     composed and balanced,--both complicated and kept distinct with\r\n     such skill,--as to seem less a work of human prudence than of\r\n     Providential interposition. Mr. Webster has at all times been\r\n     fully aware of the evils of anarchy, discord, and civil war at\r\n     home, and of utter national insignificance abroad, from which\r\n     the formation of the Union saved us. He has been not less\r\n     sensible to the obstacles to be overcome, the perils to be\r\n     encountered, and the sufferings to be borne, before this\r\n     wonderful framework of government could be established. And he\r\n     has been persuaded that, if destroyed, it can never be\r\n     reconstructed. With these views, his life has been consecrated\r\n     to the maintenance in all their strength of the principles on\r\n     which the Constitution rests, and to the support of the system\r\n     created by it.\r\n\r\n     \"The key to his whole political course is the belief that, when\r\n     the Union is dissolved, the internal peace, the vigorous\r\n     growth, and the prosperity of the states, and the welfare of\r\n     their inhabitants, are blighted for ever, and that, while the\r\n     Union endures, all else of trial and calamity which can befall\r\n     a nation may be remedied or borne. So believing, he has pursued\r\n     a course which has earned for him an honored name among those\r\n     who have discharged the duty of good citizens with the most\r\n     distinguished ability, zeal, and benefit to the country. In the\r\n     relations of civilized life, there is no higher service which\r\n     man can render to man, than thus to preserve a wise\r\n     constitution of government in healthful action. Nor does the\r\n     most eloquent of the statesmen of antiquity content himself\r\n     with pronouncing this the highest human merit. In that\r\n     admirable treatise on the Republic, of which some precious\r\n     chapters have been restored to us after having been lost for\r\n     ages, he does not hesitate to affirm, that there is nothing in\r\n     which human virtue approaches nearer the divine, than in\r\n     establishing and preserving states.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nELIZABETH BARRETT BROWNING.\r\n\r\n\r\nMiss Mitford, in her pleasant _Reminiscences of a Literary Life_, gives\r\nthe following sketch of this charming poetess:\r\n\r\n     \"My first acquaintance with Elizabeth Barrett commenced about\r\n     fifteen years ago. She was certainly one of the most\r\n     interesting persons that I had ever seen. Every body who then\r\n     saw her said the same; so that it is not merely the impression\r\n     of my partiality or my enthusiasm. Of a slight, delicate\r\n     figure, with a shower of dark curls falling on either side of a\r\n     most expressive face, large, tender eyes, richly fringed by\r\n     dark eyelashes, a smile like a sunbeam, and such a look of\r\n     youthfulness that I had some difficulty in persuading a friend,\r\n     in whose carriage we went together to Chiswick, that the\r\n     translatress of the 'Prometheus' of Æschylus, the authoress of\r\n     the 'Essay on Mind,' was old enough to be introduced into\r\n     company, in technical language, 'was out.' Through the kindness\r\n     of another invaluable friend, to whom I owe many obligations,\r\n     but none so great as this, I saw much of her during my stay in\r\n     town. We met so constantly and so familiarly that, in spite of\r\n     the difference of age, intimacy ripened into friendship, and\r\n     after my return into the country, we corresponded freely and\r\n     frequently, her letters being just what letters ought to\r\n     be--her own talk put upon paper.\r\n\r\n     \"The next year was a painful one to herself and to all who\r\n     loved her. She broke a blood-vessel upon the lungs, which did\r\n     not heal. If there had been consumption in the family, that\r\n     disease would have intervened. There were no seeds of the fatal\r\n     English malady in her constitution, and she escaped. Still,\r\n     however, the vessel did not heal, and after attending her for\r\n     above a twelvemonth at her father's house in Wimpole street,\r\n     Dr. Chambers, on the approach of winter, ordered her to a\r\n     milder climate. Her eldest brother, a brother in heart and\r\n     talent worthy of such a sister, together with other devoted\r\n     relatives, accompanied her to Torquay, and there occurred the\r\n     fatal event which saddened her bloom of youth, and gave a\r\n     deeper hue of thought and feeling, especially of devotional\r\n     feeling, to her poetry. I have so often been asked what could\r\n     be the shadow that had passed over that young heart, that, now\r\n     that time has softened the first agony, it seems to me right\r\n     that the world should hear the story of an accident in which\r\n     there much sorrow, but no blame.\r\n\r\n     \"Nearly a twelvemonth had passed, and the invalid, still\r\n     attended by her affectionate companions, had derived much\r\n     benefit from the mild sea-breezes of Devonshire. One fine\r\n     summer morning, her favorite brother, together with two other\r\n     fine young men, his friends, embarked on board a small\r\n     sailing-vessel for a trip of a few hours. Excellent sailors\r\n     all, and familiar with the coast, they sent back the boatmen,\r\n     and undertook themselves the management of the little craft.\r\n     Danger was not dreamt of by any one; after the catastrophe, no\r\n     one could divine the cause, but, in a few minutes after their\r\n     embarkation, and in sight of their very windows, just as they\r\n     were crossing the bar, the boat went down, and all who were in\r\n     her perished. Even the bodies were never found. I was told by a\r\n     party who were travelling that year in Devonshire and Cornwall,\r\n     that it was most affecting to see on the corner houses of every\r\n     village street, on every church door, and almost on every cliff\r\n     for miles and miles along the coast, handbills, offering large\r\n     rewards for linen cast ashore, marked with the initials of the\r\n     beloved dead; for it so chanced that all the three were of the\r\n     dearest and the best; one, I believe, an only son, the other\r\n     the son of a widow.\r\n\r\n     \"This tragedy nearly killed Elizabeth Barrett. She was utterly\r\n     prostrated by the horror and the grief, and by a natural but a\r\n     most unjust feeling that she had been, in some sort, the cause\r\n     of this great misery. It was not until the following year that\r\n     she could be removed, in an invalid carriage, and by journeys\r\n     of twenty miles a day, to her afflicted family and her London\r\n     home. The house that she occupied at Torquay had been chosen as\r\n     one of the most sheltered in the place. It stood at the bottom\r\n     of the cliffs, almost close to the sea; and she told me herself\r\n     that during that whole winter the sound of the waves rang in\r\n     her ears like the moans of one dying. Still she clung to\r\n     literature and to Greek; in all probability she would have died\r\n     without that wholesome diversion of her thoughts. Her medical\r\n     attendant did not always understand this. To prevent the\r\n     remonstrances of her friendly physician, Dr. Barry, she caused\r\n     a small edition of Plato to be so bound as to resemble a novel.\r\n     He did not know, skilful and kind though he were, that to her,\r\n     such books were not an arduous and painful study, but a\r\n     consolation and a delight. Returned to London, she began the\r\n     life which she continued for so many years, confined to one\r\n     large and commodious but darkened chamber, admitting only her\r\n     own affectionate family and a few devoted friends (I, myself,\r\n     have often joyfully travelled five-and-forty miles to see her,\r\n     and returned the same evening without entering another house),\r\n     reading almost every book worth reading in almost every\r\n     language, and giving herself, heart and soul, to that poetry of\r\n     which she seemed born to be the priestess. Gradually her health\r\n     improved. About four years ago she married Mr. Browning, and\r\n     immediately accompanied him to Pisa. They then settled at\r\n     Florence; and this summer I have had the exquisite pleasure of\r\n     seeing her once more in London with a lovely boy at her knee,\r\n     almost as well as ever, and telling tales of Italian rambles,\r\n     of losing herself in chestnut forests, and scrambling on\r\n     mule-back up the sources of extinct volcanoes. May Heaven\r\n     continue to her such health and such happiness!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HAPPINESS OF OYSTERS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last _Westminster Review_ contains a pleasant scientific article\r\nunder the title of \"Shell Fish, their Ways and Works,\" in which the\r\nsubject so much debated lately, whether the lower orders of animals are\r\ncapable of reason, has some new and amusing illustrations. Generous and\r\nhonestly disposed lovers of good dinners will be gratified with the\r\nnotion that _oysters_ receive as well as communicate a degree of\r\nhappiness. The reviewer treats the subject in the following luminous\r\nmanner:\r\n\r\n     \"And then the oyster itself--the soul and body of the shell--is\r\n     there no philosophy in him or her? For now we know that oysters\r\n     are really he and she, and that Bishop Sprat, when he gravely\r\n     proposed the study of oyster-beds as a pursuit worthy of the\r\n     sages who, under the guidance of his co-Bishop, Wilkins, and\r\n     Sir Christopher Wren, were laying the foundation stones of the\r\n     Royal Society, was not so far wrong when he discriminated\r\n     between lady and gentleman oysters. The worthy suggester, it is\r\n     true, knew no better than to separate them according to the\r\n     color of their beards; as great a fallacy, as if, in these days\r\n     of Bloomerism, we should propose to distinguish between males\r\n     and females by the fashion of their waistcoats or color of\r\n     their pantaloons; or, before this last great innovation of\r\n     dress, to, diagnose between a dignitary episcopal and an\r\n     ancient dame by the comparative length of their respective\r\n     aprons. In that soft and gelatinous body lies a whole world of\r\n     vitality and quiet enjoyment. Somebody has styled fossiliferous\r\n     rocks 'monuments of the felicity of past ages.' An undisturbed\r\n     oyster-bed is a concentration of happiness in the present.\r\n     Dormant though the several creatures there congregated seem,\r\n     each individual is leading the beatified existence of an\r\n     epicurean god. The world without--its cares and joys, its\r\n     storms and calms, its passions, evil and good--all are\r\n     indifferent to the unheeding oyster. Unobservant even of what\r\n     passes in its immediate vicinity, its whole soul is\r\n     concentrated in itself; yet not sluggishly and apathetically,\r\n     for its body is throbbing with life and enjoyment. The mighty\r\n     ocean is subservient to its pleasures. The rolling waves waft\r\n     fresh and choice food within its reach, and the flow of the\r\n     current feeds it without requiring an effort. Each atom of\r\n     water that comes in contact with its delicate gills involves\r\n     its imprisoned air to freshen and invigorate the creature's\r\n     pellucid blood. Invisible to human eye, unless aided by the\r\n     wonderful inventions of human science, countless millions of\r\n     vibrating cilia are moving incessantly with synchronic beat on\r\n     every fibre of each fringing leaflet. Well might old\r\n     Leeuwenhoek exclaim, when he looked through his microscope at\r\n     the beard of a shell-fish, 'The motion I saw in the small\r\n     component parts of it was so incredibly great, that I could not\r\n     be satisfied with the spectacle; and it is not in the mind of\r\n     conceive all the motions which I beheld within the compass of a\r\n     grain of sand.' And yet the Dutch naturalist, unaided by the\r\n     finer instruments of our time, beheld but a dim and misty\r\n     indication of the exquisite cilliary apparatus by which these\r\n     motions are effected. How strange to reflect that all this\r\n     elaborate and inimitable contrivance has been devised for the\r\n     well-being of a despised shell-fish? Nor is it merely in the\r\n     working members of the creature that we find its wonders\r\n     comprised. There are portions of its frame which seem to serve\r\n     no essential purpose in its economy: which might be omitted\r\n     without disturbing the course of its daily duties, and yet so\r\n     constant in their presence and position, that we cannot doubt\r\n     their having had their places in the original plan according to\r\n     which the organization of the mollusk was first put together.\r\n     These are symbols of organs to be developed in creatures higher\r\n     in the scale of being; antitypes, it may be, of limbs, and\r\n     anticipations of undeveloped senses. These are the first\r\n     draughts of parts to be made out in their details elsewhere;\r\n     serving, however, an end by their presence, for they are badges\r\n     of relationship and affinity between one creature and another.\r\n     In them the oyster-eater and the oyster may find some common\r\n     bond of sympathy and distant cousinhood.\r\n\r\n     \"Had the disputatious and needle-witted schoolmen known of\r\n     these most curious mysteries of vitality, how vainly subtle\r\n     would have been their speculations concerning the solution of\r\n     such enigmas?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RECLAIMING OF THE ANGEL.\r\n\r\nWRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MONTHLY MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\nBY ALICE CAREY.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Oh smiling land of the sunset,\r\n      How my heart to thy beauty thrills--\r\n    Veiled dimly to-day with the shadow\r\n      Of the greenest of all thy hills!\r\n    Where daisies lean to the sunshine,\r\n      And the winds a plowing go,\r\n    And break into shining furrows\r\n      The mists in the vale below;\r\n    Where the willows hang out their tassels,\r\n      With the dews, all white and cold,\r\n    Strung over their wands so limber,\r\n      Like pearls upon chords of gold;\r\n    Where in milky hedges of hawthorn\r\n      The red-winged thrushes sing,\r\n    And the wild vine, bright and flaunting,\r\n      Twines many a scarlet ring;\r\n    Where, under the ripened billows\r\n      Of the silver-flowing rye,\r\n    We ran in and out with the zephyrs--\r\n      My sunny-haired brother and I.\r\n\r\n    Oh, when the green kirtle of May time,\r\n      Again o'er the hill-tops is blown,\r\n    I shall walk the wild paths of the forest,\r\n      And climb the steep headlands alone--\r\n    Pausing not where the slopes of the meadows\r\n      Are yellow with cowslip beds,\r\n    Nor where, by the wall of the garden,\r\n      The hollyhocks lift their bright heads.\r\n    In hollows that dimple the hill-sides,\r\n      Our feet till the sunset had been,\r\n    Where pinks with their spikes of red blossoms,\r\n      Hedged beds of blue violets in,\r\n    While to the warm lip of the sunbeam\r\n      The check of the blush rose inclined,\r\n    And the pansy's white bosom was flushed with\r\n      The murmurous love of the wind.\r\n\r\n    But when 'neath the heavy tresses\r\n      That swept o'er the dying day,\r\n    The star of the eve like a lover\r\n      Was hiding his blushes away,\r\n    As we came to a mournful river\r\n      That flowed to a lovely shore,\r\n    \"Oh, sister,\" he said, \"I am weary--\r\n      I cannot go back any more!\"\r\n    And seeing that round about him\r\n      The wings of the angels shone--\r\n    I parted the locks from his forehead\r\n      And kissed him and left him alone.\r\n    But a shadow comes over my spirit\r\n      Whenever I think of the hours\r\n    I trusted his feet to the pathway\r\n      That winds through eternity's flowers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ENEMY OF VIRGINIA.\r\n\r\nWRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MAGAZINE BY ASA SMITH, M. D.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe London _Examiner_, in reviewing Mr. McCulloch's new work on Wages,\r\netc., seems to be displeased that the author should have expressed\r\nhimself against the cultivation and use of tobacco, using the following\r\nlanguage in its defence: \"We quarrel,\" says the _Examiner_, \"with Mr.\r\nMcCulloch, for bestowing offensive epithets on tobacco, which he is\r\npleased to call 'this filthy and offensive stimulant.' Why it should be\r\nmore filthy to take a pinch of snuff or a whiff of tobacco smoke, than\r\nto swallow a quart of port wine, is not to us intelligible. Of all the\r\nstimulants that men have had recourse to, tea and coffee excepted,\r\ntobacco is the least pernicious. For the life of you, you cannot get\r\ndrunk on it, however well disposed, and no man or woman has ever been\r\ncharged with committing a crime under its influence--save only the\r\nfactitious crime created by an irrational and excessive duty. For the\r\nbest part of three centuries, all the nations of the earth have been\r\nusing tobacco--saint, savage, and sage, being among the consumers.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Examiner_ may quarrel with Mr. McCulloch for abusing the \"weed,\" if\r\nit pleases, but it is a weak argument, if argument it can be called, to\r\nsay that because taking a pinch of snuff, or a whiff of tobacco, is no\r\nworse than taking a quart of port wine, therefore the use of tobacco is\r\ngood; or because tobacco is the least pernicious of all the stimulants,\r\ntherefore it is not objectionable; or because one cannot get drunk on\r\nit, (which, by the way, is a great mistake,) or because for the best\r\npart of three centuries all the nations of the earth have been using\r\ntobacco--saint, savage and sage--therefore it is not a \"filthy and\r\noffensive stimulant.\" The real object of the _Examiner_, however, in\r\ndefending the cultivation and use of tobacco, will appear by reading a\r\nlittle further. \"Of all people,\" says the reviewer, \"we ourselves are\r\nthe most moderate consumers; yet the 'filthy and offensive stimulant'\r\n_puts four millions and a half a year into our exchequer_. An old\r\nfinancier, like Mr. McCulloch, ought, _on this account alone_, to have\r\ntreated the weed with more respect.\" Here then is the true reason why\r\nthe London _Examiner_ is disposed to quarrel with that author. Nor can\r\nit be a \"filthy and offensive stimulant,\" because, forsooth, it puts\r\nfour millions and a half a year into England's exchequer! Upon this mode\r\nof reasoning, what an inestimable blessing must opium be to the world,\r\nand especially to the Chinese! We have only to say, that if tobacco\r\nyields this immense revenue annually to England, any one who passes\r\nthrough Eastern Virginia and sees the poverty stricken appearance of the\r\nthousands of acres of exhausted useless land which present themselves in\r\nevery direction, will be able to determine at whose expense this has\r\nbeen, in a great measure. If England has been enriched by the traffic in\r\ntobacco, its cultivation has been the ruin of Eastern Virginia, by far\r\nthe larger portion of which now lies in open uncultivated sterile\r\ncommons, bleaching in the sun.\r\n\r\nVirginia, we are glad to know, is at last awaking to her true condition\r\nand interests; the rapid increase of population in the northern and\r\nwestern states, and the proportionate improvement in their arts,\r\nsciences and agricultural industry, have excited in the minds of our\r\npeople, no inconsiderable attention. While it is true of Western\r\nVirginia, that if not advancing with a rapidity equalling that of many\r\nof the states, she is nevertheless improving, and with her almost\r\ninexhaustible mineral wealth, and productiveness of soil, must continue\r\nto improve, if the inhabitants persist in declining to cultivate\r\ntobacco. It is painfully true of Eastern Virginia--if we except the\r\ncities--that if not just at this time retrograding, the change from a\r\nretrograde to a stationary condition has been but recent, and some time\r\nmust necessarily elapse before any marked evidence of an advance will be\r\nperceptible. There are even yet to be found, on the borders of James\r\nRiver and in other parts of Virginia, the wealthy, intelligent, and\r\nhospitable planter, living in style and entertaining with liberality\r\nscarcely unequal to that which distinguished Virginia in bygone days.\r\nSuch are still to be encountered, though not often. The Virginia\r\ngentleman has been elbowed out. Like the Knickerbockers of New\r\nYork--most of whom have shaken the ashes from their pipes, and gone\r\noff--the old Virginia gentleman has disappeared--but been displaced by a\r\ndifferent enemy from that which disturbed the cogitations of the honest\r\nDutchman. While _Mein Herr_, happy and contented, sat in the door of his\r\nsimple dwelling, enjoying the pleasure of his pipe, he little thought,\r\nor if he thought, he little cared perhaps, that the weed which afforded\r\nso much comfort to his constitutionally comfortable frame, was drawing\r\nforth the substance and exhausting the soil of one of the richest,\r\nfairest and most attractive portions of the earth, and would in time\r\ncover its surface with a stunted sickly growth of pine, through which\r\nthe wind might pour her low sad requiem for departed life. The honest\r\nHollander and his good vrow have gone on their journey, exiled by the\r\nenterprising Yankee, or by the needy foreigner. The old Virginia\r\ngentleman has gone, or is going--finding that his \"old fields\" are\r\nrapidly increasing, and his crop of tobacco year by year\r\ndiminishing--where no hopes to find a richer soil and a better market.\r\n\r\nFor some years past, most of the counties in Eastern Virginia have\r\nproduced very little tobacco--some of them none at all. When we recall\r\nto mind that this section of Virginia was once by far the richest part\r\nof the state, and not to be surpassed by any soil in the country--that\r\nit was celebrated for the large crops and excellent quality of its\r\ntobacco--we naturally look for the reasons of this change. Now, although\r\nour good friends down below, are very sensitive upon the subject, we\r\nhave no hesitation in saying that the cause generally assigned is the\r\ntrue one, viz., that the soil is exhausted, worn out, and therefore\r\ncannot produce tobacco, or any thing else of consequence. And here let\r\nme encroach upon established rules and digress for a few moments,\r\nleaving tobacco, to give my reader a little advice to aid him should he\r\never visit the \"Old Dominion.\" In the first place, if you stop at any\r\npoint along the shore, and especially should you reach Hampton, never\r\nspeak of \"crabs.\" If you are fond of them, get them the best way you\r\ncan; you will have no difficulty in finding them; have them cooked, and\r\neat them; but don't ask for them--don't speak of them. The people of\r\nVirginia, like those of most other places, are sensitive on some points;\r\nand it would be no less impolite to speak of crabs in Hampton, than it\r\nwould be to speak of \"persimmons\" in Fluvanna County.\r\n\r\nIn the second place, never speak of the ague and fever, especially if\r\nyou visit on the rivers, unless it be to say, that the place from which\r\nyou came is very subject to this complaint. If you take this position\r\nyou are safe, for should you be attacked (cases have been known even in\r\nVirginia), why you have only to say you were so unfortunate as not to\r\nleave home quite soon enough to avoid the disease. Mind what I, an M.D.\r\nof the calomel and quinine school--no Homoeopathist, but one of the\r\nregular troop--say upon this matter. No false charges, either direct or\r\nindirect, no inuendos by look, word, or deed, that you might possibly\r\nhave taken the ague and fever after your arrival! It would be absurd, at\r\nleast, in you to say so. Not that the people would lay violent hands\r\nupon you--and yet on sober second thoughts I am not so sure of this, if\r\nwe are to judge from the toast given by a young gentleman who attended\r\nthe Printers' anniversary celebration of the birth of Benjamin Franklin,\r\nat the City Hotel, Richmond, on the night of Saturday, 17th of January:\r\n\"A [symbol: hand] to our friends, and a [symbol: dagger] for our\r\nenemies.\" This, perhaps, might have been simply to vary the\r\nentertainment of the evening. We ought not be hasty in drawing\r\nconclusions, for another young citizen, on the same occasion, gave the\r\nfollowing: \"The first families of Virginia--like stars seen in the\r\nocean, they would not be there but for their bright originals in\r\nheaven.\" It is evident from this, although there is no roundabout\r\ntedious effort to prove the thing, that the \"first families\" of Virginia\r\nare not only as the stars of heaven in number--not only as thick as\r\nstars, but that like the stars they are absolutely in heaven, and,\r\nhaving carried their family dignity thither, are emitting their light to\r\nthe benighted angels--occasional sparks sometimes dropping down from\r\nthem to their numberless descendants, living here upon the shadows of\r\ntheir grandfathers. It may not be amiss, in order to save future\r\ndigression, to say that the Smith in my name is on the paternal side.\r\nShould you come to Virginia, you will hear of the Smiths. You have\r\nalready beard of Pocahontas. Well, the land on which her father lived\r\nwas famous for its tobacco: it would now be dear at three dollars per\r\nacre. A short time since, while on a visit to and in conversation with\r\none of the most distinguished men of Virginia, who owns and resides on a\r\nplantation on the James River, a few miles above Richmond--observing the\r\nneatness of every thing around, the superiority of his land and the\r\nlargeness of his wheat and corn crops, I inquired about his tobacco. \"I\r\nnever cultivate tobacco,\" said he, \"I detest it, for it has been the\r\nruin of the state.\" This is the testimony of one of Virginia's most\r\nprominent and most enlightened sons, a graduate of William and Mary\r\nCollege, and the friend of Bishop Madison, Thomas Jefferson, and most of\r\nVirginia's other distinguished men, living in his day--one who, in age,\r\nhas passed the threescore and ten allotted to mankind, and whose\r\ndignified yet gentle bearing tells that he is one of the survivors of a\r\nclass now nearly extinct, \"the Virginia gentleman of the old school.\"\r\n\r\nPass through almost any part of Eastern Virginia, and wherever you go\r\nwill be found immense tracts of land, barren and useless, which were\r\nonce rich and productive, but which have been exhausted in the\r\ncultivation of tobacco. And yet--notwithstanding this, and strange as it\r\nmay appear--there are still to be found among the people of lower\r\nVirginia men who deny that the raising of this crop impoverishes the\r\nsoil, and who on the contrary insist that the culture of tobacco\r\nenriches it. They are ready to acknowledge that the land has been\r\nexhausted, but contend that it is owing to the cultivation of corn, and\r\nnot of tobacco. This, it need hardly be said, is maintained only by\r\nthose who are engaged in raising tobacco. Facts however are stubborn\r\nthings, and it may be well to present, just at this time, one or two in\r\npoint.\r\n\r\nVirginia, when first settled, possessed a soil far superior to that of\r\nany of the Eastern or Middle States. Little or no tobacco has ever been\r\nraised in those states, while corn has been one of the chief products.\r\nIn Virginia, where tobacco has been the principal crop, the land has\r\ndeteriorated, the rich soil has been exhausted, and become more sterile\r\nthan were the bleak hills of New England when the Pilgrim reached her\r\nshores; while in New England, where corn has been produced in abundance,\r\nand but very little tobacco, the soil has been improved until it has\r\nbecome almost or quite as rich as that of Virginia was at any time\r\nsince its settlement. In this day the most unproductive of the New\r\nEngland states has soil superior to that of Eastern Virginia.\r\n\r\nAnother fact that cannot be denied is, that wherever tobacco has been\r\nraised for any length of time, the result has been invariably the\r\nsame--without a single exception, the land has been exhausted, and\r\nabandoned as useless. A particular portion of a plantation, it is true,\r\nhas been, and may be again for a time, kept very rich by concentrating\r\nupon it all the fertilizing substance produced; but this must of course\r\nbe at the expense of all other parts of the plantation, and operate\r\neventually to the disadvantage of the small part kept rich at the\r\nexpense of the whole; for unless there be considerable attention paid to\r\nother parts of the land, besides those appropriated to the raising of\r\ntobacco, the manure will no longer be found on the plantation, and\r\ngeneral exhaustion and sterility must follow.\r\n\r\nFrom what has been said about tobacco the reader will imagine, perhaps,\r\nthat I am an enemy to the noxious weed. Not altogether so; but the\r\nreason, if not precisely similar to that which calls forth the article\r\nin the London _Examiner_, springs from the same impulse: I love a good\r\ncigar, and have been in my day an inveterate smoker, but hope, and am\r\nnow endeavoring, to overcome the useless and enervating habit, more\r\nespecially since I have seen the poverty and desolation occasioned in\r\nVirginia from the cultivation of tobacco. Still I must confess, that\r\neven now, like an old war horse when he smells powder, am I, when I come\r\nin contact with the odoriferous exhalation of a good cigar. If he with\r\ndelight snuffs in his expanded nostrils the fumes of saltpetre and\r\ncharcoal, I, with no less pleasure, inhale the odor of a good Havana. If\r\nhe chafes and prances to rush into the battle, in me rises an elate\r\nspirit, when, in the midst of a band of smokers, I see through the fog,\r\nslowly curling and ascending, a miniature gallery of \"long nines\"\r\nissuing from their port-holes, and hear the puffs, and see the smoke. At\r\nsuch a time it is not safe to offer me a cigar, for then I feel like him\r\nof the _Examiner_, that it is not well to be too hard upon an enemy.\r\nSnuff I detest, and always have detested, notwithstanding the fact that\r\nI once bought a gold snuff-box, upon the lid of which I had my family\r\ncoat-of-arms engraved.\r\n\r\n\"Off again! Why don't you keep to the point?\" doubtless exclaims the\r\nreader. The truth is, my position as an assailant of tobacco is somewhat\r\npeculiar, such as may be appreciated by one who, having had a friend to\r\nwhom he is under obligation, has been led, upon meeting that friend, and\r\nfinding him in discredit, to give him the \"cold shoulder.\" It goes hard\r\nwith my feeling, if not with my conscience, to speak against tobacco.\r\nYet whatever virtue the weed itself may possess, it is now almost\r\nuniversally conceded, that the cultivation of tobacco will ruin a\r\ncountry. Let any one take a survey of lower Virginia, and he cannot help\r\ncoming to the conclusion, that it not only impoverishes the land, but if\r\nfollowed up for a number of years, will be very apt to impoverish the\r\nchildren of those who engage in its cultivation. Tobacco, say its\r\nadvocates, is a very profitable crop,--if by profit is meant a large\r\nreturn in money, without reference to any thing else--granted. Much\r\nmoney has been and will be made by cultivating it, and if the parent, as\r\nthe money is received, would safely invest it for the benefit of himself\r\nand children, so that provision would be made for the time when he grows\r\nold and they advance, and the land becomes exhausted and useless, they\r\nwill do very well. But few are sufficiently considerate to make this\r\nprovision, since it is naturally supposed that a plantation which for a\r\nnumber of years has yielded a superabundance will not be likely to fail\r\nin the future. They cannot see that year after year, slowly but surely,\r\nthe substance of their land is being taken away in the form of tobacco,\r\nand that in the end their plantations will be barren and useless.\r\nEstates comprising thousands of acres of good land yield annually large\r\nincomes, upon which their owners live, with their families, in great\r\naffluence. Surrounded by servants who stand ready to attend to every\r\nwant, the children are reared from their infancy with scarcely a wish\r\nungratified--thereby contracting most expensive habits, and becoming,\r\nthrough the mistaken kindness and indulgence of their parents,\r\naltogether unfitted for the hardships of life when adversity comes upon\r\nthem. It is not, in fact, often the case that parents so situated\r\nremember that a change may take place by which they or their children\r\nmay be thrown upon the world and compelled to rely upon their own\r\nexertions for a living. But experience shows that the cultivation of\r\ntobacco tends almost inevitably to this. As year after year passes on,\r\nsection after section of productive land is taken up, and that which has\r\nbecome already exhausted is left to put forth stunted pines, and await\r\nthe recuperative powers of nature. Thus men live on, with an increasing\r\nfamily and a large and rapidly increasing number of servants to support,\r\nuntil perhaps the head of the house is called away by death, and the\r\nestate, if free from incumbrance, is divided among the children. Another\r\ngeneration succeeds, and another division takes place--the soil all this\r\ntime becoming poor and poorer, and the quantity of land at each\r\nsubdivision becoming less for every member,--until a general exhaustion\r\nis perceived, the land is left a wilderness, and the family scattered\r\nover the country; the females, sensitive, well-educated, and spirited,\r\nunfitted for contact with the world, and the sons too often branded as\r\nspendthrifts because they cannot manage to live upon the land that\r\nsupported their fathers and their grandfathers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA WORD ABOUT THE ARMY-PRIVATE.\r\n\r\nWRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\n\r\nWe cannot make up our mind to look on this member of the universal\r\nYankee nation with quite as much distrust as is often evinced; with that\r\ndistrust which lies most where he is least known. Scarce one-sixth of\r\nthe lookers-on--as the liveried gentleman with a straight knee and stiff\r\nupper-lip keeps up the ninety to a minute down the sunny side of\r\nGreenwich-street--know aught of the animal, save that every day he\r\nstruts up and down at about the same hour. Mothers have nothing to say\r\nfor him, while fathers pass him with quite a look of contempt. Betty,\r\nperhaps, is the least timid, and is foolish enough to let spurs and\r\ncock-feathers tinge her dreams all night long, beside thinking of them a\r\ndozen times next day. If she is from the old country, she has seen them\r\nall her life, and has many friends \"as went a soldiering.\" The little\r\nboys are more of the Betty order, and always show him the greatest\r\nadmiration and respect: as may be seen, any day, in the miniature\r\nevolutions to the public squares, which always display enthusiasm, if\r\nnot the accuracy of strategical art. If there is but one private, you\r\nwill always be sure to find a captain and a drummer, and the army is\r\ncomplete.\r\n\r\nWhy the senior and more intellectual world and his wife are more wary of\r\nthe Greenwich dragoon, is a question not easy of solution. Perhaps they\r\nhave read in books that he is apt to commit sundry excesses, not\r\napproved of in the Scriptures, after the siege is over; or that, like\r\nCaptain Dalgetty, he will sometimes fight for plunder; or that his\r\nprofession tends to \"solitude and calling it peace.\" In a measure these\r\ncharges are certainly true; partly because poor human nature is frail,\r\nand partly that there are tricks in all trades; not, however, we think,\r\nto the extent that he should suffer excommunication without a hearing,\r\nand while his own or adopted flag waves tranquilly over the land. Give\r\nhim credit when he deserves it, for it is his especial lot, when down,\r\nto have no friends. In stirring times, however, when death is within the\r\nwalls and the enemy hard pressing at the gates, he has advocates and\r\nadmirers without number; then he has virtues worthy of notice; and while\r\nhis body receives the ball, his heart is praised for its devotion. Women\r\nhave embroidered silken banners for him, to strengthen his courage in\r\ntheir defence, and put fine words thereon to serve him as a rallying\r\ncry. In our revolutionary days, when the old continental spirit was\r\nabroad, he was respected to a degree unknown perhaps at the present\r\ntime. The mistress entertained him with a hearty will, and the\r\nrespectable dame, who, when there was no flannel for making cartridges,\r\ndropped something in the street that would make a dozen or more, enjoyed\r\nthe joke all her life, besides receiving a pension from Congress. That\r\nhe really receives now so much distrust, it is either because we know\r\nnothing about him, or because the lightning age is so far advanced as to\r\nleave his humble merits out of sight in the rear. He is rarely\r\nnoisy--never insults you--and passes well to the right in the street. He\r\nis often polite, too; and if he does not, like Jack, offer to carry a\r\nlady's muff, it is because his land-service has taught him the big thing\r\nis not as heavy as it looks. If a mob defies the law, he will stand the\r\nstones until one has knocked him out of the ranks. In short, he is a\r\ncomplete protector and servitor of laws, of mothers, daughters, wives,\r\nand property,--and, at the end of all, receiving his pittance with a\r\n\"Good luck to those who live better and get more.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not our intention, be it known, to attempt doing away with any\r\nprejudice good society may entertain for one of its \"sworn defenders;\"\r\nfor, as we have hinted, the soldier is not presumptuous, and never\r\ncurses his unlucky stars. Our only object is, to give a brief\r\npen-and-ink sketch of the man in his bonded condition; in fine, say so\r\nmuch, or so little, about him, that the uninitiated, sitting by the warm\r\nfire-side, and reading of the great cold in latitude 49°, or of the hot\r\npursuit in the Camanche country, may know something of poor Tobin, who\r\nis made to suit every climate and every emergency.\r\n\r\nIt has often been a wonder with the curious, why enlistments take place\r\nin times of profound peace; and the probable causes that lead to such\r\nsteps are, of course, much debated. We remember seeing, not long ago, in\r\nthe newspapers, a brief table of such causes, purporting to come from an\r\narmy surgeon who examined each recruit on the subject. It was funny, and\r\nso startling withal, that while some laughed or stood aghast, others\r\nhardly knew which to admire most, the doctor's eccentricity, or his\r\nfertile fancy. We know not if in the world's vast library there is any\r\nreliable exhibition of such causes. Sir Walter Scott's imaginary\r\nClutterbuck, after some prefatory doubts, leaves the following as\r\nperhaps his principal reason: \"This happy vacuity of all employment\r\nappeared to me so delicious, that it became the primary hint, which,\r\naccording to the system of Helvetius, as the minister says, determined\r\nmy infant talents towards the profession I was destined to illustrate.\"\r\nSuch may be the idea of some at the present day, though Clutterbuck's\r\ndeclaration is by no means sacred authority. He confesses he was\r\nunmilitary enough to damn _reveillé_, and also, to a significant rebuke\r\nfrom his old colonel. \"I am no friend to extravagance, Ensign\r\nClutterbuck,\" said he, \"but on the day when we are to pass before the\r\nsovereign of the kingdom, in the name of God, I would have at least\r\nshown him an inch of clean linen.\" The truth is, the causes are about as\r\nvarious as the trades they subscribe to, or, if one more than another be\r\npredominant, it is \"the love of the thing.\" In the old countries, the\r\ndrum and fife mingled their music with the first pleasant scenes he ever\r\nsaw; and, in the new world, the same enlivening sounds also awoke the\r\nspirit of childhood. Early associations had merely lain dormant for a\r\nseason, but those connected with the bright musket and sabre were\r\nstronger than those of the spade and figure-maker's mould.\r\n\r\nHaving before us the roll of a company now in service, we will take from\r\nit such information as may be pertinent, premising that the record is so\r\nnearly like that of every other, that the little difference, as\r\nmathematicians say, may be disregarded without affecting the general\r\nresult. Of the whole number (fifty), thirty-eight are between twenty and\r\nthirty years of age, ten between thirty and forty, and two between forty\r\nand forty-five. Five were born in England, three in Scotland, twenty-one\r\nin Ireland, five in Germany, thirteen in the United States, two in\r\nPrussia, and one in Italy. They subscribed, at the time of enlistment,\r\nthe following trades: five farmers, one spinner, twelve laborers, one\r\nweaver, one tinsmith, one painter, two gardeners, three bakers, two\r\nshoemakers, two tailors, one carpenter, one printer, one cigar-maker,\r\nnine soldiers, four clerks, one turner, and one figure-maker (the\r\nItalian); and one pretends to be a lawyer, though, as he may be an\r\nimposter, we will have due regard for the sensitive feelings of our\r\nlegal friends, and set him down as only a pettifogger. Sixteen cannot\r\nread or write, and of these, three are of the United States, and the\r\nremainder nearly all from Ireland. It is quite a treat in chirography to\r\nsee the signatures of the residue of the fifty, as they stand in the\r\ncolumn. They are not so imposing as John Hancock's on the Declaration,\r\nnor as small as a schoolmistress's copy; but assume all shapes and\r\nstyles, from the \"clerkly fist,\" to the genuine \"crow-track,\" or Chinese\r\ncharacters on a tea-chest.\r\n\r\nBe it as it may, after he swears to serve well and faithfully the United\r\nStates against all her enemies and opposers whatsoever, he is sent to\r\nNew-York harbor, if he is to do foot-work, or to Carlisle Barracks, if a\r\nhorse is to do it for him; and in one of these places the transformation\r\nfrom civil to military life begins. In two hours after his arrival you\r\nwould hardly know him. With hair cut close, and a complete revolution in\r\nhis dress, he looks nothing like the \"sovereign\" of this mighty Republic\r\nyou have just seen. He feels the change, too; and as he struts up and\r\ndown, peacock-like, admiring himself, he realizes that hitherto, for\r\nmany years perhaps, he has not had a new suit from tip to toe all for\r\nnothing. It has saved him weary days of toil, and the little personal\r\nliberty he has given in exchange is but dust in the balance. As soon as\r\n\"the vapors melt into morn,\" the drum sounds the _reveillé_, and up he\r\nrises to receive instructions, which are repeated and repeated until he\r\nhas them at his tongue's and fingers' ends. At all times, if\r\nwell-behaved, he receives the necessary recreations and indulgences. To\r\nfollow him closely throughout his tuition, would be to extend this\r\narticle more than is intended, besides outraging the military knowledge\r\nof many by a recital of elementary instruction. Suffice it to say, after\r\na certain period, he is sent to some post on the sea-board, or to active\r\nservice on the frontier.\r\n\r\nThe term of enlistment varies in different countries. In England,\r\nformerly, it extended to twenty-one years; but the law has lately\r\nreduced it to ten. In our service it is for five years only, with the\r\nprivilege of re-enlisting, if at the end of that time the applicant is\r\nstill sound in body and mind. He then becomes an \"old soldier;\" a term\r\nwhich, for some reason or other, is used in civil life with no\r\ncomplimentary import. It has a better meaning in service, however, which\r\nis well exemplified in the French proverb, \"_Il n'est chasse que de\r\nvieux chiens_\" (old dogs are staunch hunters). The pay also varies, and\r\nit is a feather in the cap of our Government that we may say she is in\r\nthis respect more liberal than any other. In France, Prussia, Germany,\r\nAustria, and Russia, a private, with all economy, cannot save more than\r\nsix cents a-day; yet when we consider the vast number each is obliged to\r\nkeep under arms, we cannot suppose them able to pay more. England, whose\r\n\"public debt is a public blessing,\" also looms up largely in the battle\r\narray, and pays better than her neighbors. With her artillery-private\r\n(or gunner as he is more properly called), we will compare a private of\r\nthe United States artillery, or infantry, since both are on a par in\r\nthis respect. The former receives one shilling fourpence farthing, or\r\nthirty-three and one-half cents, per day, from which, deducting his\r\nrations and clothing, there will be left thirteen and one-half cents, or\r\nabout four dollars per month. The latter receives seven dollars per\r\nmonth, beside his rations and clothing. In the British infantry\r\nregiments, the private has but one shilling per day, and the Queen\r\ngraciously allows him one penny of \"beer-money.\"\r\n\r\nThe artillery-company of England is perhaps the best organized and most\r\nefficient in the world; while ours is merely nominal, and a sore subject\r\nto the accomplished officers attached to it. It is called artillery, but\r\ninfantry is more appropriate. At nearly all the forts, the siege pieces\r\nand implements of the artillerist are packed away in storehouses,\r\nwithout a particle of benefit to those for whom they are intended. In\r\nMexico, on the march to Orizaba, it had the mortification to trudge\r\nalong on foot, while midshipmen commanded sections of a light battery,\r\nmarines were cannoneers, and sailors rode the horses, using, in their\r\namphibious state, the oddest medley of sea-terms and military jargon\r\nthat ever grated on professional ears. It would have been equally\r\nproper to put an artillery captain in command of the frigate Cumberland\r\nthen lying in the harbor of Vera Cruz, with no less a prospect of\r\nbrilliant manoeuvres in the hour of battle. The English company is\r\nreally what it purports to be, and is one hundred and twenty strong,\r\nincluding eight corporals and four bombardiers; besides, it has eight\r\nserjeants, three buglers, one second and one first lieutenant, one\r\nsecond captain (brevet-captain in our service), and one first captain.\r\nThe aggregate here is fifty-eight, not quite one-half of the British\r\ncompany.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, from what has been said, that the Greenwich dragoon, or\r\nfoot soldier, is, in five cases out of six, either a Dutchman, Irishman,\r\nor American; and an observer can easily perceive in each his national\r\ncharacteristic and temperament. Karl is dull and heavy, generally sober,\r\nalways ready to lend his pipe, or sing a song. Pat is merry, loves a\r\nglass at any time, is handy with the spade, and uses his mother-wit in\r\nrounding off a capital story. Jonathan is all these, and something more.\r\nHe astonishes his trans-atlantic comrades by the incomprehensible manner\r\nin which the knave will turn up when he deals the \"pictures;\" and the\r\nneat manner in which he mends the rent in his coat sleeve; is one short\r\nof funds, he will generously lend him a safe amount until \"next pay\r\nday,\" provided, at that time, fifty per cent. be added thereto; and, if\r\nsome doubt arises in the mean time, he disposes of his stock to some\r\nother speculator; so that Wall-street-like panics are not\r\nunfrequent--sometimes among the bulls, sometimes among the bears. If he\r\nchooses, he will do more work in less time, or less work in more time,\r\nthan Karl or Patrick, and he often manages to make a cats-paw of them to\r\nscratch out his delinquencies. He knows well how to make use of the\r\ntechnicalities of the limited monarchy under which he is governed, and\r\nbewilders dull Karl by his manifold risks and little punishment.\r\n\r\nIt matters not whether our man is cooped up at Eastport, or bivouacked\r\non the Rio-Grande--he is every where essentially the same. With scarce a\r\nthought beyond the morrow, he awaits it without impatience. In all\r\nplaces, and at all times, he has great respect for his officer; the\r\ngracefully touching his cap being no idle ceremony. At the close of a\r\nweary day's march, he will leave his own to put up his tent; build a\r\nfire near it, and do every favor he can, freely and willingly. Officers\r\nwill recognize this fact, and attribute the secret to the strict\r\nnon-familiarity between them.\r\n\r\nHe has three festivals during the year, when he sets a splendid table\r\nand enjoys himself--the two wintry holidays, and the anniversary of our\r\nnational independence. There are songs and speeches in abundance, and\r\nthe oratory is genuine. If he lingers long at the table--or under\r\nit--there is so much power in the \"star spangled banner,\" or \"Erin is my\r\nhome,\" that he must become a martyr to their glorious enthusiasm. On one\r\nof these occasions, a little lady friend christened an aldermanic German\r\nby a patriotic name which since has taken the place of his own. \"He was\r\na man of an unbounded stomach,\" seemingly, with the French maxim ever\r\nuppermost in his mind: _Quand la cornemuse est pleine on en chant mieux_\r\n(when the belly is full, the music goes better). An escopette ball at\r\nMolino-del-Rey struck him on the head, and the ponderous mass rolling\r\nover and over on the ground, he was left for dead, but his time had not\r\nyet come. It was a heavy blow, and though alive, yet his reason, at\r\ntimes, is gone: predicting something novel in the history of man to\r\nhappen on the 4th of April next. Another joyful day is the visit of the\r\npaymaster, which happens six times a year. His last supply is\r\ngone--hence his anxiety to replenish. He is very happy to see this\r\nfinancial individual--as much so as any body was with the arrival of the\r\nfirst California steamer with two millions in gold. His only drawback\r\nis, that his mortal enemy, the sutler, is then invariably ready to face\r\nhim with a small bill for sundry articles, such as cheese, whiting, and\r\n\"some drinks.\" He had no idea it was so large! Generally he pays to a\r\nfraction; sometimes, like broken banks, he compromises for a certain per\r\ncentum; sometimes he repudiates _in toto_. He is often economical,\r\nspending nothing, and transmitting his savings to destitute relations at\r\nhome or abroad. A thousand hearts were gladdened, and a thousand mouths\r\nfed, in the poor Emerald Isle during her starving days, by five pound\r\ndrafts from \"the bold soldier-boy\" over the water. These substantial\r\ntokens from the home of his adoption have a secret but visible effect.\r\nThe military roads he lays out are found and followed by the recipients\r\nof his bounty, and gardens flourish where but yesterday were seen the\r\npoles of his old camping ground; new states rise out the wilderness,\r\nwhere he planted the early seed, and watched the glittering things as\r\nthey grew to the strength and beauty of their starry sisters.\r\n\r\nHe has no enmity or prejudice against any person, sect, or\r\nsociety--loving Broadbrim even more than could reasonably be expected.\r\nThere is, however, a proverbial enmity between him and Jack the sailor,\r\nthough it is generally of that Pickwickian nature, that--like Micawber's\r\ngriefs--easily dissolves over a bowl of punch, and both become as jolly\r\nas Friar Tuck and Richard. He is not generally religious; but during\r\ndivine service is as orderly as a deacon. Sometimes he pleads conscience\r\nagainst Protestant worship, but those interested may be assured that, in\r\nfive cases out of six, it is only Pat's cunning: true piety can worship\r\nGod under any form. He is generally a bachelor, and rarely goes beyond\r\nthe walls for a wife: if Abigail comes inside, he snaps her up as you\r\nwould a hotcake on a frosty morning. If he dies prematurely, some\r\ncomrade is ready to console the widow in her affliction; the courtship\r\nbeing a fine exemplification of--\r\n\r\n    \"For you must know a widow's won\r\n    With brisk attempt and putting on:\r\n    With ent'ring manfully and urging--\r\n    Not slow approaches like a virgin.\"\r\n\r\nShould she fail, however, she trips off to another post, where, \"her\r\ncase being duly represented at the mess,\" she generally manages to get\r\nreinstated in the army. It is for the good of the service that marriage\r\nis in some degree restricted, and the reasons therefor, none will fail\r\nto perceive.\r\n\r\nThe soldier's history and accounts are posted up regularly every two\r\nmonths at Washington--that great ledger of the United States--so that if\r\nhe has been sentenced to a money stoppage, or broken a tumbler-screw, it\r\nis there accurately recorded. He is kept well supplied, where it is\r\npracticable, with the news of the day, contained in two dailies, one of\r\nwhich, generally, is from New-York, and the other from Washington. At\r\nnearly all the principal posts neat little chapels have been built, and\r\nchaplains provided, so that he can worship God, if he desires, morning\r\nand evening, and without expense.\r\n\r\nThe discipline governing him is severe; so much so that it is sometimes\r\nmade ground of complaint. This severity is necessary for the creation\r\nand preservation of prompt obedience and clock-like regularity. Severe\r\nlaws are necessary in every body--civil, religious, and military--and in\r\nno one, it is fair to say, are they more strictly enforced than in the\r\narmy of the United States. The sad penalty of death is rarely, if ever,\r\ndecreed, except in a regularly constituted war. A fearful instance of it\r\noccurred in the valley of Mexico during our late contest with that\r\ncrumbling republic. Fifty deserters were condemned, but their execution\r\ntemporarily delayed by the officer in charge, that they might see the\r\nstars and stripes run up over the falling castle of Chapultepec, and\r\ntheir last gaze on earth be fixed, as well on the faithful valor of\r\ntheir comrades, as on the flag they had shamelessly forsaken. As their\r\nbodies swung to and fro, well relieved against the sky, and the setting\r\nsun cast its lurid beams over countenances yet warm in death, many felt\r\nthe extreme severity yet justice of military law, particularly in an\r\nenemy's country. In time of peace the punishment varies from a\r\ndishonorable discharge to little temporary deprivations and\r\nconfinements, except for insubordination and desertion, when the law\r\nagain permits of considerable severity. The stories about long\r\nconfinements in dreary holes, starvation, &c., which we sometimes see in\r\nthe \"newspapers of little circulation,\" are about as true as the nursery\r\ntales in children's primers. Of the minor punishments, those which\r\ncombine an appeal to his pride are the most dreaded, and often have a\r\nsalutary effect. A mounted trooper would rather perform picket duty all\r\nnight, in any weather, than once take a stationary gallop on the wooden\r\n\"bob-tailed nag,\" facing the other way. The soldier's crimes--nearly\r\nall--are criminal only in that they offend against military laws; and if\r\nonce in a while he has a hearing before Justice M., \"you should not,\" as\r\nhe contends, \"expect all the cardinal virtues for seven dollars a\r\nmonth.\"\r\n\r\nWherever the pioneer has laid his axe, there you will find the soldier,\r\na ready watch-dog between the settler and the savage; and it is a great\r\nmisnomer for any one \"in Congress assembled,\" to call him one of a\r\n\"peace establishment,\" as three-fifths of his number are now on active\r\nservice. In Florida--encamped in hammocks, or on the banks of some\r\nunhealthy stream--he is parleying with the Seminole; while in New\r\nMexico, and over the vast frontier of Texas, he is engaged in deadly war\r\nwith other tribes: the war seeming to be without a beginning, as well as\r\nwithout an end. In the back grounds of California, he escorts the\r\ntreaty-making powers, while with his axe he lays out military roads, and\r\nmeasures them as he goes along. After a long march over the Rocky\r\nMountains, or a sea-voyage of twenty thousand miles round the \"stormy\r\ncape\"--we find him, again, constructing block-houses along the Columbia\r\nriver in Oregon; as much to protect him against the winter's cold, as to\r\nserve as means of future defence. The United States constitute a large\r\npatch of ground on the map of nations, with much work to do on her\r\nextensive frontier; and he is the pack-horse that tugs faithfully at the\r\nburden. Far away from the many comforts and conveniences that surround\r\nyou--in prairie or wilderness--often without clothes, oftener without\r\nfood--in sunshine and storm--winter and summer--in the midst of sickness\r\nand death--relentless foes on the hill-tops and in the valleys--he toils\r\non, with no help from Congress to do what ought to be, but what cannot\r\nbe done: certainly, cannot be done! for there are well known \"treaty\r\nstipulations,\" and the lawmakers expect him, generally on foot, to\r\npursue, overtake, and severely punish the well-mounted savage. Fatal\r\nerror! every southerly wind brings with it a wail of the dying border\r\nman, and Mexico will yet, ere the present \"long parliament\" closes,\r\npresent her wrongs before the proper source, the master--not the man.\r\nBut we have digressed once or twice into extraneous topics: they\r\ngerminated from the subject, and as they can do no harm, let them stand\r\nas written.\r\n\r\nDo not suppose, then, because the Greenwich recruit is well-clothed, and\r\nsomewhat proud withal, that his life is one of comparative ease. In\r\nvirtue of all he does for you and your children's children, while plenty\r\nis on your right and on your left hand, rank him far above the hireling\r\nin its corrupted sense. He does much for the mite given him in return,\r\nand never murmurs at the task. At early dawn he rises, slings his\r\nknapsack, fills his canteen from the brook, and, with a scant ration in\r\nhis haversack, marches a long Texan summer's day, recounting to his\r\ncomrade some adventure in the old country, or the last news from the\r\nwhite settlements. At night, he spreads his blanket on the ground, his\r\nknapsack serves as pillow, and with no covering but the stars, he awaits\r\nthe coming day to renew the fruitless scout. Perhaps, as he faces the\r\nsky, he pictures in the clouds heavily rolling o'er the moon, a mimic\r\nbattle, in which his company is in the thickest of the fight; perhaps he\r\nis dreaming of--what? It is hard to tell: it may be of Betty in return;\r\nit may be of a wee sister or dear old mother far away over the\r\nseas--whom, since many years he has not seen, and then, God help his sad\r\nand weary heart! the prospect is a dreary one indeed of ever beholding\r\n\"sacred home\" again. He has fought well for you in the days of the\r\nKnickerbockers and in the valley of Mexico, and the same brave spirit\r\nadorns the homely bosom still. If it is charge, he charges; stand, he\r\nstands; and should there at any time occur a suspicious retrograde\r\nmovement, he'll punch you with his bayonet if you call it by any other\r\nname than that of masterly retreat. Congress, during its last session,\r\nprovided a Military Asylum, so that when age or wounds have taken away\r\nhis once hardy strength, he will have a peaceful refuge, until--\r\n\r\n    \"Hark! the muffled drum sounds the last march of the brave,\r\n    The soldier retreats to his quarters--the grave--\r\n    Under Death, whom he owns his commander-in-chief--\r\n    And no more he'll turn out with the ready relief.\"\r\n\r\nAs we cannot charge Uncle Sam with any extravagant degree of nepotism,\r\nwe will commend Tobin to a bit more of the spare regard of the people of\r\nthe United States--the \"smartest nation in all creation\"--a fact which\r\nJohn Bull pretends to disregard, and, like a traveller lost in the\r\nwoods, whistles every now and then, to keep his courage up. In these\r\ndays, when his great captains glide into the affections of the people,\r\nand thence into the chair of state, it were well to remember the Italian\r\nproverb, _Il sangue del soldato fa grande il capitano_, which, being\r\ninterpreted, means, \"The blood of the soldier makes the glory of the\r\ngeneral!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTO SUNDRY CRITICS.\r\n\r\nWRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MAGAZINE.\r\n\r\nBY R.

The sound of the\r\nsquatter's axe had not then aroused the echoes of those remote\r\nsolitudes; nor the smoke of the frontiersman's cabin curled above the\r\ntall branching oaks and the solemn hemlocks of the primeval forest. The\r\nploughshare had not then turned the fertile glebe, nor the cattle\r\nbrowsed upon the tender herbage of that region, now so populous and\r\ncultivated. The red stag there shook his branching antlers, and bounded\r\nfearlessly through the open glades of the wood, or led the dappled doe\r\nor fawn, at rosy dawn, or mellow eventide, to drink at the ice-cold\r\nwater-course, or the pellucid surface of the lake. The shaggy bear\r\nprowled in the briery thicket, or fed on the acorns that autumn shook\r\ndown from the oak; and the tawny panther ranged unmolested in the rocky\r\nfastnesses of the hills, or lay in the leafy covert for its prey. The\r\nIndian hunter was then lord of the land. The Mohawk and the Oneida held\r\nthe region from the waters of the Hudson to the shores where Erie and\r\nOntario rolled upon the beach; and the smoke of the wigwam ascended by\r\nmany a quiet stream and wood. The hunter's rifle echoed among the hills,\r\nand his arrow whistled in the glade--the war-dance and battle-song\r\nresounded in every valley; and the sharp canoe, urged by the flashing\r\npaddle, skimmed every stream and lake.\r\n\r\nMany years since, a small band of marksmen of the Mohawk tribe, having\r\nwandered far from their hunting-ground, were ambushed by a war-party of\r\nthe Oneidas, and their chief, Owaka, was slain in the contest. Wauchee,\r\nor the Red-Feather, the only son of the old chief, and now the head of\r\nthe nation of the Mohawks, had been deeply distressed at his father's\r\nloss, and had sworn that he would take the scalp of an Oneida, before\r\nthe flowers of another spring should bloom over his father's grave.\r\n\r\nIn the leafy month of June, the young chief wandered afar from the\r\nlovely valley of his native river in pursuit of a small hunting-party of\r\nthe Oneidas who were said to be prowling in the neighborhood. He had\r\nfollowed for many days the trail of the fugitives, and had often come\r\nupon their deserted camp-fires, but had not yet overtaken them. They\r\nwere on their return to their village, which was situated on the shores\r\nof the Ontario, where the Niagara river, after its mighty plunge at the\r\nFalls, empties into its frothy abyss. On a pleasant evening of\r\nsummer-time, he paused to encamp for the night in a place where a\r\ntransparent streamlet poured its crystal tribute into the bosom of the\r\nGenessee. A dense and lofty grove of pines advanced their ranks to the\r\nvery edge of the stream, and afforded him a faithful shelter from the\r\ndews and breezes of night.\r\n\r\nThe hunter soon enkindled a roaring fire from the decayed and fallen\r\nbranches of trees, and while his supper of venison broiled upon its\r\nembers, he flung himself upon the turf, wearied with his march. The\r\nIndian was a noble specimen of his race. His shapely limbs indicated the\r\npresence of extraordinary strength and activity. He was clad in a\r\nbuckskin hunting-frock, handsomely ornamented with quills and feathers.\r\nHis deer-skin leggins were fringed with the red-stained hair of some\r\nwild animal, and his neat moccasons were adorned in the extreme of\r\nsavage fashion. On his head was placed a bunch of eagle-feathers, which\r\nfluttered gayly in the wind. A heavy rifle lay at his side, with its\r\nornamented pouch and horn. In his belt were thrust the fatal knife and\r\nhatchet. A huge wolf-hound, the only companion of his expedition,\r\nstretched its limbs before the blaze, watching with hungry eyes the\r\nprogress of the evening meal. But the night passed not away without\r\nadventure. A thick darkness had now fallen upon the woods, and the ruddy\r\nflames of the fire but partially illuminated the rough black shafts of\r\nthe pines, whose plumed branches sighed mournfully overhead. Suddenly\r\nthe hound sprang to his feet, with a fierce growl, at the same time\r\nglaring upward into the thick recesses of a towering pine-tree. For a\r\nmoment the sharp eye of the hunter could discern no object of alarm; but\r\nhe soon heard the branches creak, as with the movements of some wild\r\ncreature. He presently heard a growl among the tree-tops, and discerned\r\ntwo flaming globes of fire, which he knew to be the eyeballs of some\r\nanimal, illuminated by the flashes of his camp-fire. In an instant his\r\nrifle was poised at his shoulder, and its glittering sight brought in\r\nrange with the shining objects of its alarm. For an instant the heavy\r\ntube was held motionless at its aim, and then the sharp crack of the\r\nweapon sounded on the air. Before the smoke of the discharge had\r\ndissolved in the breeze, a dark object tumbled headlong among the\r\nboughs, and at length plunged headlong in the midst of the flames,\r\nscattering the flashing sparks in all directions. With a furious yell\r\nthe hound fastened upon the prey, and soon dragged forth from the flames\r\nthe lifeless body of an immense panther, from one of whose perforated\r\neyes the life-blood flowed in a copious stream. The Indian was greatly\r\nelated at his successful shot, and after removing with his knife one of\r\nits sharp claws as a trophy, and heaping fresh logs on the flames, he\r\nspread out his blanket and resigned himself to slumber.\r\n\r\nThe morning sun had not drank up the dew-drops that sparkled like gems\r\non herb and foliage before the young hunter had again resumed his march.\r\nHe followed with unerring precision the trail of the fugitives through\r\nthorny thicket and quaking morass, and ere the evening sun had dropped\r\nbehind the hills, he came upon the encampment of his foe. The party had\r\nflung themselves upon the soft turf, beneath the drooping branches of a\r\ngrove of cedars, and were enjoying their evening pipe, while a huge side\r\nof venison smoked upon the embers. The group consisted of tall and\r\nstalwart warriors, whose brawny limbs seemed well able to triumph in any\r\nact of savage barbarity they might be called upon to undertake. Some of\r\nthem wore frocks of buckskin, and leggins of bright-colored cloth,\r\nornamented with strings of wampum, tin trinkets and glass beads, that\r\njingled with every motion of the wearer. Some wore feathers from the\r\neagle's wing on their heads, as marks of rank. At the side of most of\r\nthem rested an ornamented gun, while pouches and horns were suspended\r\nfrom the branches around. Each warrior was encircled with a belt of\r\nhide, in which glittered the usual implements of the chase and war. Some\r\nof the inferior ones carried only a stout ash bow, a sheaf of feathered\r\narrows, and a weighty club of bone, adorned with quills and colored\r\nfeathers.\r\n\r\nThe cunning Wauchee crept cautiously within a short distance of the\r\ncamp, trusting that during the drowsy hours of the night he should be\r\nable to strike a blow; but to his chagrin he perceived that the party\r\nwas on the alert, and that two wakeful sentinels constantly kept watch,\r\nwhile the others slept. On the following morning the party resumed their\r\nmarch, still followed by their pursuer, who hoped to cut off some\r\nstraggler during the retreat; but no such victim fell in his way. In the\r\ncourse of a day or two the roar of waters, and the ascending mist of the\r\ncataract, warned them of their approach to the mighty falls of Niagara;\r\nand soon the Oneida party had encamped among the gloomy pines and\r\nhemlocks opposite the torrent.\r\n\r\nWauchee, though he had often heard among the dim traditions of his race,\r\nof the existence of an awful torrent of water, that poured for ever with\r\na voice of thunder, among the remote woods of the wilderness, had never\r\nyet gazed on this stupendous spectacle, and now, as he listened to its\r\nearthquake voice with wonder, some such thoughts as the following may\r\nhave agitated his mind:\r\n\r\n    'Tis pouring, 'tis pouring\r\n    With a wild eternal roar;\r\n    Like a sea, that's burst its barriers\r\n    Resounding evermore:\r\n    Like an ocean lash'd to fury,\r\n    And toiling to o'erwhelm\r\n    With its devastating billows\r\n    The earth's extended realm.\r\n\r\n    It falleth, still it falleth,\r\n    A deluge o'er the rocks;\r\n    It calleth, still it calleth,\r\n    With tones likes earthquake shocks:\r\n    For ever and for ever,\r\n    It sounds its mighty hymn;\r\n    Like a thousand anthems pealing\r\n    In some cathedral dim.\r\n\r\n    The dark pines shrink and tremble\r\n    As o'er the abyss they lean,\r\n    And falling are ingulf'd like reeds\r\n    With all their branches green;\r\n    And oaks from northern mountains,\r\n    O'erwhelm'd by some fierce blast,\r\n    Are rent like autumn flowerets,\r\n    In that vast caldron cast.\r\n\r\n    A thousand years ago the tribes\r\n    In wonder trod its side:\r\n    Those tribes have vanish'd, but the Fall\r\n    Still pours as full a tide;\r\n    A thousand more may pass away--\r\n    A future race of men\r\n    May view the awful cataract\r\n    Unchang'd dash down its glen.\r\n\r\n    How passing vain doth mortal pride\r\n    Beside this torrent seem!\r\n    An army doth not march to war\r\n    With half its sound and gleam;\r\n    While o'er it, like a banner,\r\n    The rainbow spreads its fold,\r\n    Colored with prismy glories\r\n    Of purple and of gold.\r\n\r\n    The wild deer of the forest\r\n    At the river stoop to drink,\r\n    But from the rush of waters\r\n    All panic-stricken shrink;\r\n    And the mountain eagles sailing\r\n    O'er the cataract's foaming brim\r\n    Alarmed, on soaring pinions,\r\n    Away, o'er Heaven's clouds skim.\r\n\r\n    O! who that views the wonders\r\n    Of Nature o'er the earth;\r\n    The high o'erhanging mountains\r\n    Where thunders have their birth:\r\n    And this eternal torrent,\r\n    Majestically grand--\r\n    Can doubt the Spirit's presence,\r\n    And a Creating Hand?\r\n\r\nOn the following day the Oneidas resumed their march, and at nightfall\r\nreached an American military post, then just established at the entrance\r\nof the Niagara river, on the shore of Lake Ontario, called the Fort\r\nNiagara. The Oneidas entered within the barriers of the little stockade\r\nfortress, and there established their camp, and were soon busily engaged\r\nin arranging a treaty with the commandant of the place. Wauchee followed\r\nclosely after, like a bloodhound on the trail, and selected his camp in\r\na little grove just without the gates of the fortress. He then boldly\r\nsauntered within the walls, and mingled with cool indifference among the\r\ngroups of soldiery, and the armed warriors of his foe. But under the\r\nsemblance of friendship, lurked the fire of a spirit burning with\r\nhatred; and he could scarce restrain himself from plunging among them,\r\nand immolating numbers on the spot. Still the wary prudence of the\r\nsavage restrained his hand, and he continued for a day or two to mingle\r\nin peace among them. The crafty Oneidas soon suspected the designs of\r\nthe stranger, and they conferred among themselves, as to the surest mode\r\nof guarding against the meditated blow of Wauchee. They well recognized\r\nby his paint and garb the Mohawk warrior, and they resolved to baffle\r\nhis assault, and for ever prevent his return to the people of his tribe.\r\n\r\nBut the designs of a bold and resolute man are not easily fathomed or\r\nthwarted, and the rude walls of the frontier fortress were unable to\r\nshut out so brave and active a warrior as the Mohawk chief. He was\r\ntrained to stratagem, and sworn to vengeance; and now that his wild\r\nblood boiled with fury, no ramparts of mere wood and stone could\r\neffectually interpose between the avenger and the destroyers of his\r\nsire.\r\n\r\nDuring the silence and gloom of night he succeeded in scaling the\r\npalings of the walls, and secretly and successfully made his way into\r\nthe very heart of the fortress. He was surrounded with numbers of armed\r\nmen slumbering upon their weapons; and many a pacing sentinel was\r\nstationed upon the breast-works, to guard against an open or a secret\r\nfoe: yet the soft step and the gliding figure of the Mohawk passed along\r\nin the darkness unheard and undetected. After moving about swiftly among\r\nthe sleepers for some time, he at length came upon the prostrate group\r\nof the Oneidas. Trusting to the vigilance of the garrison, the savages\r\nwere all buried in slumber, and were outspread along the grassy floor,\r\nenwrapped in their blankets. The wily Mohawk went in like a serpent\r\namong them, and having recognized their sleeping chief by the eagle\r\nplume upon his head, he drew his scalp-knife, and with one mortal blow\r\ndrove the weapon to the very heart of the dreamer. He then in an instant\r\nsevered the bleeding scalp from the head, and sprang away to make good\r\nhis escape, but was followed as instantly by a dozen dark forms, which\r\nbounded after him like so many leaping panthers. Still the daring young\r\nbrave would have successfully effected his escape but for an unfortunate\r\naccident. With one quick bound he overleaped the barriers of the fort,\r\nbut in alighting heavily on the sod he severely sprained his ankle,\r\nwhich so disabled him, that he fell an easy prey into the hands of his\r\npursuers. He was instantly firmly bound with cords, and dragged back,\r\namidst savage jeers and menaces, into the fortress.\r\n\r\nOn the following day the luckless captive was led away by his enemies to\r\ntheir neighboring village, which was situated at Messessaga Point, near\r\nthe fortress. The warriors sadly bore, on a litter of branches, the body\r\nof their slain chieftain, leading beside it their pinioned captive. As\r\nthey approached to the little rude hamlet where they dwelt, a motley\r\ncrowd of old men, women, and children, came forth to welcome their\r\nreturn; but when they beheld the ghastly body of their late chief, and\r\nthe drooping looks of the warriors, their joyful cries were exchanged\r\nfor wails of lamentation, and they tore their hair, and expressed the\r\nmost violent emotions of grief. They wept over the bleeding corpse of\r\nthe victim, while they derided and buffeted the helpless prisoner. But\r\nthe stout-hearted Wauchee moved onwards with a firm and erect gait,\r\ndisturbed neither by the blows nor the menaces that were directed\r\nagainst him. He only exclaimed, \"You have slain my chief and father, and\r\nlo! I have also struck down the head of your nation. It is well. Slay\r\nme--torture me, if you will. I can bear unmoved any torments you may\r\ninflict.\"\r\n\r\nThe captive, still bound securely with thongs of deer-hide, was thrust\r\ninto a cabin; and two stout warriors were appointed to watch over him by\r\nday and night, and were charged to use the utmost vigilance in\r\npreventing his escape. A few dried bunches of fern were spread for his\r\ncouch; and he was supplied with a wooden bowl of water and a handful of\r\npounded corn to satisfy his appetite; and it was ordered that Monega,\r\nthe most skilful mediciner of the tribe, should apply her most healing\r\nsalves and balsams to his hurts, that he might the sooner be ready to\r\nrun the gauntlet, and endure the torture of fire, which was the destiny\r\nawaiting him.\r\n\r\nMonega was the daughter of a chief, and as it chanced, was as\r\ndistinguished for the gentleness of her heart, as for her exceeding\r\nloveliness, and her great medical skill. No one could look upon her\r\nslight and well-rounded limbs, and upon her sweet countenance, without a\r\nfeeling of admiration, if not of love; and no sooner did our Mohawk gaze\r\nupon her features, and listen to the soft tones of her voice, than he\r\nwas completely fascinated with her charms. Nor did the Indian damsel\r\ngaze upon the noble captive with less favorable emotions. With a\r\nblushing cheek and trembling hand she produced from a number of gourds,\r\nthe most potent herbs that constituted her remedies, and tenderly\r\napplied them to the wounded limbs of the Mohawk.\r\n\r\n\"How is the sweet daughter of the Oneida named?\" inquired the young\r\nchief, as the damsel proceeded to bathe the bruised places with\r\nsweet-smelling medicines.\r\n\r\nA blush suffused the modest cheek of Monega as she replied, \"I am called\r\namong my people Monega, or the Wild-rose, and am the daughter of a\r\nchief.\"\r\n\r\n\"Monega,\" exclaimed he, \"is fairer than any honeyed wild-rose that is\r\nkissed by the red lip of the morning, or than the pearly lily that\r\ndroops by the brink of the running water. There is no maiden among the\r\nfair daughters of the Mohawk, so lovely in the eyes of Wauchee. Will not\r\nthe Wild-rose return again the fondness that blooms in the breast of the\r\nstrange warrior, though he lies like a wounded panther at the feet of\r\nhis mistress?\"\r\n\r\n\"The captive warrior,\" returned the maiden, \"has a bold heart, and is\r\nmore stately and noble than any of the young chiefs of her own people,\r\nyet Monega must not yield her heart to a chief of an enemy.\" And, so\r\nsaying, she hastily gathered her herbs and unguents together, and\r\nwithdrew beneath the suspended buffalo-hide that formed the door of the\r\nwigwam.\r\n\r\nAs the shades of evening began to settle on the deep woods that drooped\r\naround, the captive continued to listen intently for the returning step\r\nof the damsel; and presently the heavy drapery at the entrance was drawn\r\naside, and the yellow flood of the setting sun streamed upon the figure\r\nof Monega. \"The hours of the day,\" said the youth, \"have been dark and\r\nweary to the heart of the captive, since the Wild-rose withdrew from the\r\nside of Wauchee, but now that she has returned, the light again shines\r\nin his heart, and his soul is filled with brightness and joy.\"\r\n\r\nThe maiden in silence produced her herbs and bandages, and after\r\napplying them to his hurts, thus replied to his words: \"Wauchee is\r\nnoble, and brave, but his days are now few and numbered. Let us speak\r\nwith a low voice, for the two warriors are watchful at the door, and\r\ntheir jealous ears may catch the friendly word that may pass between us.\r\nWould the fettered chieftain desire to be freed from his bonds, and\r\nbreathe once more the free breath of the woods, and again return to his\r\ndistant people?\"\r\n\r\n\"Gentle Monega!\" cried he, \"I pray thee, free these limbs from the\r\nhateful thongs that eat into the flesh, and so cramp his benumbed\r\nmembers, and Wauchee will fly like a deer to his own people, and also\r\nbear away with him the sweet Wild-rose of the Oneidas, to bloom afresh\r\nin the gardens of the Mohawks. Will Monega free the bondsman? and will\r\nshe fly with him to be the bride of his heart, and the queen of the\r\nMohawk people?\r\n\r\n\"Monega cannot refuse,\" said the maiden, after a little hesitation;\r\n\"Monega cannot refuse to save the life of the brave and handsome young\r\nwarrior; and if he asks it, neither can she refuse to depart with him,\r\nand cast her lot with his people.\"\r\n\r\n\"Monega speaks well,\" cried the captive, \"and her words gladden my\r\ndarkened spirit. Quick then, sever these bonds from my wrists and limbs,\r\nthat I may stand forth once more a free man. I will then escape to the\r\nforest, and await you at the great fall of waters.\"\r\n\r\n\"I gladly free you from your thongs,\" said she, \"and will not fail to\r\njoin you where you appoint; but remember that two brave warriors guard\r\nwith their weapons at the door, and that they will spare him not if he\r\nbut offer to depart. Yet one of them, the young Thaygea, has vowed to me\r\nhis love, and him will I entice away from his post of guard, and the\r\ncaptive must fain deal with the other as he may. Is Wauchee content to\r\nmake the trial?\"\r\n\r\n\"Sever these thongs, and free these crippled limbs, bright maiden, and I\r\nwould not shrink from an armed host. Do you entice away one of my\r\nguards, and I will manage to escape from the other; and I shall then\r\nimpatiently await your coming at the Falls.\"\r\n\r\nThe bold girl with a trembling hand cut away the gyves that held the\r\nprisoner, and then, departing, exchanged a few words with one of the\r\nyoung men who guarded the hut, and who instantly forsook his post to\r\nfollow her footsteps. Wauchee hurriedly glanced around, to discover some\r\narticle that might serve as a weapon, and, snatching up a small billet\r\nof wood that lay on the hearth, sprang to the door, and with one furious\r\nblow felled the solitary sentinel to the earth, and then stretched\r\nswiftly away in flight. But numbers of warriors, aroused by the sound of\r\nthe blow, were instantly after him in hot pursuit. The flying Wauchee\r\nwas most remarkable for his fleetness of foot, and could easily have\r\ndistanced his pursuers, but for his wounded ankle, which greatly impeded\r\nhis motions; and in a short time, after a desperate struggle, he was\r\noverpowered, and roughly dragged back to the place of his captivity.\r\n\r\nAgain did the fair Monega, whose agency in his attempted flight had not\r\nbeen suspected, attend upon her wounded lover; but so vigilant were his\r\nguards, that an attempt at escape seemed now impossible.\r\n\r\nIn the lapse of a few days, the prisoner, under her skilful treatment,\r\nhad entirely recovered from his injuries, and a day was appointed for\r\nhis death. He was doomed to \"run the gauntlet\" of the tribe; that is, he\r\nwas required to run between two lines of warriors and of women and\r\nchildren, armed with thongs of hide and small rods, which each one was\r\nto use upon his person as the fugitive passed them in full career. On a\r\nbright and cheerful morning the luckless prisoner was loosened from his\r\nbonds, and led forth to run his race; after which he was doomed to\r\nperish at the stake. But the brave youth stepped forth with an undaunted\r\neye, and a firm tread, to the place of torment. He eyed with a fearless\r\nand contemptuous glance the fearful preparations made for punishment;\r\nthe long lines of his enemies ready with their rods to strike at him;\r\nand the blackened pole of sacrifice surrounded with its pile of faggots.\r\n\r\nHe took his post at the head of the arranged lines, ready to plunge\r\nthrough the thicket of rods that were menacing him. For a moment before\r\nthe start, he glanced his eye along the dark faces that scowled upon\r\nhim, to discern the fair form of Monega, but he observed her not. At\r\nlength the two men that held him loosened their grasp, and he was\r\ndirected to use his utmost speed. And well did the most famous runner of\r\nthe Mohawks maintain that day the fame that he had won in so many a\r\nhard-contested race. He sprang forth with the strength and activity of\r\nthe wild stag, and scarcely a blow from the multitude alighted upon his\r\nshoulders. When he had passed unharmed through the whole line, he would\r\nhave succeeded in making his escape altogether, had not several Oneidas,\r\nposted for that purpose, flung themselves upon him, and securely\r\npinioned his limbs. Thus firmly bound, the Mohawk was led to the fatal\r\nstake, and secured with thongs to the upright posts, while large bundles\r\nof dried saplings were heaped around him by his persecutors. The whole\r\nparty of the Oneidas then assembled around him in a circle, to enjoy his\r\ndying agonies. The brave youth now gave himself up for lost, and threw a\r\nhasty glance on the blue sky that bent its dome above him, and over the\r\ngreen woods that nestled with all their leaves in the summer breeze, as\r\non lovely objects which his eyes were never more destined to look upon\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThe torch was lighted, and a grim chief was advancing to apply it to the\r\npile, when the light step of Monega anticipated his approach. As she\r\nissued from the crowd, she implored the privilege of whispering a few\r\nwords to him who was about to die. So highly was she held in the\r\nestimation of the tribe, that leave was readily granted her, and,\r\nthrusting aside the dry heap of the sacrifice, she stood beside the\r\ncaptive. She spoke not a word, however, but hastily passed a sharp knife\r\nover the thongs that secured him, and instantly freed his limbs in\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\n\"Now, fly, fly, I beseech thee,\" she whispered; \"you are free--once more\r\nfree! Fly with the speed of the wind.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will do my best endeavor,\" said he, hurriedly; \"and if I escape,\r\nshall await you at the great Waterfall; and so, farewell.\" And, with one\r\nvigorous bound, he sprang through the ring of his foes, overthrowing\r\nsome three or four of them to the earth. And bravely did he stretch away\r\nhis sinewy limbs in the flight for life and liberty; and though fifty\r\nactive runners followed in pursuit, yet soon did he outstrip them all,\r\nand effected his escape.\r\n\r\nHe was shortly rejoined at the foot of the great falls by his faithful\r\nMonega, who accompanied her lover in his flight, and became his bride,\r\nand the chief woman of the Mohawk nation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHRENODIA.\r\n\r\nWRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MAGAZINE,\r\n\r\nBY MRS.

ASHBURNER IN NEW-YORK.\r\n\r\nBY FRANK MANHATTAN, JUN.\r\n\r\n\r\n     _To the Editor of the International._\r\n\r\n     The very graphic and interesting pictures of American society\r\n     with which my respected progenitor has recently favored the\r\n     English public having been received with unusual favor, and the\r\n     series having been suddenly terminated, to the great regret of\r\n     the literary public, it becomes, I conceive, my duty to carry\r\n     on the work so nobly begun, even though the superstructure be\r\n     far inferior in beauty and solidity to the foundation. In\r\n     pursuing these, my filial labors, I shall always keep in view\r\n     the two pole stars which ever guided the senior Mr.\r\n     Ashburner--first, that these letters are designed for English\r\n     and not American readers, and second, that I am portraying a\r\n     class, and not individuals. As I shall thus address myself to a\r\n     foreign audience, it will of course be my duty to describe the\r\n     frivolities of American manners--the faults of American ladies,\r\n     the imbecilities of American gentlemen, the scurrilities of the\r\n     American press, the weakness of American magazines, the\r\n     degeneracy of American literature, the roguery of the American\r\n     public, the want of taste of American engineers, the ignorance\r\n     of American professors, and to discuss any questions of\r\n     strictly local interest which may happen to present themselves.\r\n     I shall studiously avoid stating that education or intelligence\r\n     or usefulness are ever encountered here; and if occasionally\r\n     some little sketch of domestic happiness or private worth\r\n     should be given, you will attribute it to my own inadvertence,\r\n     or set it down as a result of English education. As I shall be\r\n     describing a class, and not individuals, it will of course be\r\n     perfectly proper for me to narrate any little incidents of\r\n     private life which I may have heard; and persons interested\r\n     will (or at least ought to) bear in mind, if my letters are\r\n     ever read by themselves or talked of by their acquaintances,\r\n     that I am not alluding to them in the slightest degree, but\r\n     merely to the class to which they belong. They therefore (it is\r\n     to be hoped) will not arrogate to themselves any little\r\n     passages of private histories they may happen to find in these\r\n     pages; for, if they do, I shall assuredly hold them up to\r\n     public ridicule, by saying, \"as the shoe fits them they are\r\n     welcome to wear it.\"\r\n\r\n     I doubt not that these humble efforts of mine will commend\r\n     themselves to your favorable notice. They are (as you will\r\n     perceive from this letter) an unpretending mite given to aid in\r\n     elevating us in the eyes of the foreign literary world.\r\n     \"_Pulchrum est bene facere reipublicae; etiam bene dicere haud\r\n     absurdum est._\" Deeming it to be the duty of every American\r\n     thus to give his aid to so patriotic a cause, I have the honor\r\n     to be your most obedient servant,\r\n\r\n                                            FRANK MANHATTAN, Jun.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. ASHBURNER IN NEW-YORK.\r\n\r\nThe philosophy of Mr. Harry Benson (on the occasion when Mr. Harry\r\nBenson was last before the public), like the philosophy of many other\r\neminent men, silenced his auditors if it did not convince them. Karl\r\nBenson growled out something about its being well enough to say so now,\r\nand seemed rather annoyed that Harry should have been more philosophical\r\nthan he was himself; while Ashburner laughed good-naturedly, and said\r\nthat _that_ was very good philosophy, and he liked to hear it. The\r\nreader will remember that the occasion and philosophy to which we allude\r\nwere, respectively, the dinner at Mr. Karl Benson's, and a conversation\r\nin which Mr. Harry Benson expressed it as his decided opinion that\r\nliving in a country where one could eat woodcock and drink claret\r\nwithout having to pay very high taxes or do any hard work, was much\r\nbetter than some other things which he then and there suggested. But in\r\nthe silence which often falls over a small dinner circle, and over a\r\ncircle where there are good talkers and gay fellows to be found, Karl\r\nBenson thought that woodcock and claret, though essential to his\r\ncomfortable existence, were not the only things he wanted; and Ashburner\r\nmade up his mind, and more rapidly than was his custom, that the\r\npleasures and comforts which Harry had so glowingly described were not\r\nsufficient to engross the mind of an intelligent man, even though\r\nparliamentary fame required the sacrifice of twelve hours per day amid\r\nred tape and blue books, and the management of a government carried with\r\nit responsibility and care. Some other things which Harry had dropped in\r\nhis rattling dissertation about living in one of the two great abodes of\r\nfreedom, had struck Ashburner's youthful mind, and, without well knowing\r\nwhy, he determined that neither of the brothers were right, and that he\r\nwould look a little deeper into matters and things for himself before\r\nutterly condemning either politics or politicians, or public men or\r\npublic measures, in the model republic.\r\n\r\nWhen the silence we have just alluded to had continued a few moments,\r\nKarl suddenly rose from the table, and said, \"Come, boys, since you are\r\nnot drinking your wine, and since Harry has talked himself out, I move\r\nthat we go over the river, as we agreed to before dinner.\" \"Pshaw,\" said\r\nHarry, slowly rising, and following his brother and Ashburner, who led\r\nthe way, \"what an uneasy mortal you are, Karl! just as Ashburner had\r\nbegun his wine, and we were about enjoying ourselves, you haul us off on\r\nyour confounded expedition.\" \"Never mind,\" rejoined Karl, quietly, \"it's\r\na pleasant evening, and I want to show Ashburner what a plain American\r\ncountry gentleman is: that's a thing you have not shown him yet; and\r\nthen, there's a pretty girl to be seen, too--you forget that Ashburner\r\nisn't married.\" \"What do you suppose Ashburner wants to see a country\r\nbelle for?\" said Harry; \"you know he's been in society these two or\r\nthree years.\" \"I don't care whether he has or not,\" Karl replied, \"we\r\nwill show him as pretty a lass as any he has seen; and besides, I saw\r\nold Edwards this morning, and told him I was coming over, and, as I am\r\nnot going alone, you fellows must go along. By the by, shall we have up\r\nthe waggon, or walk down?\" Both gentlemen voted in favor of walking, so\r\nthe three took their hats, lit fresh cigars, and slowly sauntered\r\ntowards the river. Karl turned back for a moment, to order the waggon to\r\nbe at the dock by ten o'clock; and, after sending forward two of his men\r\nwho were to act as boatmen, joined his friends.\r\n\r\nThe dinner hour of Karl Benson was the hour at which the leading members\r\nof New-York society, in the ordinary routine of life, sat down to their\r\nrespective tables--that is, three o'clock. It is singular how this\r\nimportant period recedes from the meridian as people grow more refined\r\nin their own opinions, or more fashionable in those of their neighbors.\r\nThe hard-working farmer or mechanic has his dinner at the matin hour of\r\ntwelve; the country doctor or village lawyer stands upon his dignity\r\nand dines at one; in country towns, of twenty or thirty thousand\r\ninhabitants, the \"good society\" feels obliged to dine at two; when you\r\nreach the great metropolis (\"which is American penny-a-liner for\"\r\nNew-York), you find the dinner postponed to three; and some gentlemen,\r\nwith English education and English habits, dine in New-York at five;\r\nwhile others, whose business keeps them at the bank, or court, or\r\ncounting-house till three, have the witching time adjourned to four.\r\nThese are, however, only exceptions to the rule, and as lawyers say,\r\n_exceptio probat regulam_; the legitimate, healthy, fashionable hour for\r\ndining--that in which the Knickerbockers, who know no banks or\r\ncounting-houses, or dusty courts, save through checks, friends, and\r\nlawyers, dine, is three. Modern degeneracy or refinement, or both, it is\r\nwhispered, have lately carried it to half-past, but on the day of which\r\nwe write it was precisely three.\r\n\r\nTo return from this digression to our history--which, as the reader has\r\ndoubtless observed, is not a vulgar description of fictitious persons\r\nand imaginary circumstances, but a veracious chronicle of facts, and\r\nmuch above the level of ordinary romances, inasmuch as truth is always\r\nstranger than fiction--the early dining hour of the aristocratic Benson\r\n(early in an English sense, of course we mean), enabled the three\r\ngentlemen to step out on the lawn just as the sun was sinking behind the\r\nKaatskills. After a good dinner, most intellectual men become, or are\r\napt to become, sentimental; and as Ashburner and the Bensons were to the\r\nbest of their belief eminently intellectual, they of course became so,\r\nas in duty bound; for every one is under obligations to conform to the\r\nsettled usages of good society. \"What a charming picture,\" said Harry\r\nBenson; \"I swear it is sublime!\" \"Yes,\" said Ashburner, poetically,\r\n\"such a scene as that disgusts one with the noise and bustle and\r\nconfounded nonsense of city life.\" \"True,\" said Karl, who suddenly\r\nimagined himself for some reason a very wise and exemplary individual, a\r\nsort of martyr for principle; \"you fellows have no idea of the happiness\r\nof a plain country gentleman, living without care or ceremony--having\r\nnone of the restraints of society, none of your artificial\r\nwants--everything simple and unsophisticated. Why, if you knew what it\r\nwas, you'd give up all thoughts of town, and be living in the country\r\nbefore another month is past.\"\r\n\r\nThis speech of Karl was all very fine, but unfortunately it was rather\r\nlong, and before Ashburner and Harry Benson could promise the simple,\r\nunsophisticated, contented, happy country gentleman before them, that\r\nthey would follow his wise example, they had time to remember, one, that\r\nabout three hours before he had heard the same gentleman complain of the\r\ndifficulty of getting servants, shops, &c., in the (American) country;\r\nand the other, that, \"to tell the truth, the country was all very well\r\nabout sundown, but was deuced dull and uncomfortable on rainy days.\"\r\nAshburner, however, felt that the remarks of his host should not be\r\nthrown away, at least before his face; so he looked around for a\r\nsubject, and politely began to talk of farming. On their right lay a\r\nnewly-ploughed field, over which a workman was passing with measured\r\nstride, sowing some kind of grain on the fresh-turned soil, and close\r\nbehind him, anxious to cover the seed before finishing his day's work,\r\ncame another laborer with the harrow. Ashburner noticed this, and it\r\nstruck him that it was just the topic he wanted; so, turning to Karl, he\r\nsaid, pointing to the workman, \"You do not follow the classical rule of\r\nagriculture, Mr. Benson; you remember Plautus: \"_Nam semper occant,\r\nprius, quam sarriunt, rustici._\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good,\" said Karl, \"but I did not remember it--where is it from?\"\r\n\r\n\"From the Captives,\" replied Ashburner; \"don't you remember the slave\r\nTyndavas uses it, when old Hegio tells him he is a sower and harvester\r\nof crime?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh yes, I believe you are right; but to tell the truth, I'm not much of\r\nan admirer of Plautus.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed,\" replied Ashburner; \"why I thought you would admire him\r\nextremely; for my part I like his bold unpolished comedies; if it was\r\nnot heresy for an Englishman to say so, I should say the _Maenuhm_ was\r\nequal to the Comedy of Errors; and Shakspeare certainly must have\r\nborrowed the idea of his play from Plautus--the resemblance between them\r\nis too close to be accidental.\"\r\n\r\nKarl said \"Yes,\" in that cool sort of tone by which people show they\r\nassent to admiration without participating in it, and added something of\r\nthere being no language but Greek; at which Harry Benson laughed and\r\nasked him if he was still reviewing his Homer.\r\n\r\nThough this was said in raillery, Ashburner remarked that Karl looked\r\nquite pleased, and seemed to take the allusion to Greek and Reviews as a\r\nspecial compliment. The fact was that Mr. Karl Benson had just been\r\nthrough a gentle controversy upon the question whether the Greek word\r\n[Greek: kadestêchnia] should be rendered _constitut_ING or\r\nconstitut_ed_,--which had redounded very much to the credit of himself\r\nor his antagonist--a point not yet decided, and which it is very much\r\nfeared never will be.\r\n\r\nThe particulars of this important contest were these: Karl had been\r\nclassical editor of one of the leading magazines of Gotham, known to the\r\nliterary public of that literary metropolis as the _Zuyderzee_. The\r\nZuyderzee when first organized, had not boasted a classical editor among\r\nits managers; and as it was devoted to what is vulgarly called \"light\r\nliterature,\" was supposed by the initiated portion of the public not to\r\nwant one. Suddenly, however, certain short pieces appeared in the\r\nEditor's table (which was printed in small type at the end of each\r\nnumber, and never read), containing severe criticisms on such classical\r\nscholars of the nineteenth century as ventured to publish works in the\r\ndead languages with notes attached, for the benefit of young England, or\r\nmore particularly, young America. Though these criticisms were always\r\nafter the Edinburgh Review model, and finished up in the severest style\r\nof the month, and though the Zuyderzee had a classical editor to do them\r\n(which we would here explain to be an editor devoted to the review of\r\nclassical works and subjects, and nothing else), they were to the\r\nZuyderzee a cheap and harmless luxury. Mr. Karl Benson being a gentleman\r\nof fortune, was not particular about compensation, but limited his\r\ndesires to the very worthy object of seeing himself in print. At that\r\ntime, too, Mr. Benson had not \"been up\" to works of _fiction_; or else\r\nhad restrained his powers and devoted them to the inferior task of\r\n\"portraying\" individuals, and abusing other men's works. The editor of\r\nthe Zuyderzee, though not particularly anxious for a classical sub (who,\r\nto tell the truth, was no more wanted than a Scandinavian critic for the\r\n_Blunder and Bluster_), had no objection to the gratuitous aid of Mr.\r\nBenson; and so it came that Karl was installed as classical editor of\r\nthe Zuyderzee, with full power to annihilate the classics, and with no\r\nrestraint set upon him except that he was to do it briefly.\r\n\r\nWhile acting in this useful capacity, Karl had once had occasion to\r\nexamine an edition of Agamemnon, published by an eminent Greek scholar.\r\nIn the course of his review, he had pointed out no less than ninety\r\nerrors, eighty of which had been of omission in not having the notes\r\nsufficiently full to be obscure; five in referring to editions with\r\nwhich Mr. Benson's private tutor had not been on reading terms, three of\r\npunctuation, and the remainder of a trivial nature. The classical editor\r\nhad, however, smiled upon the professor, by saying that the work, though\r\nfaulty, contained no very outrageous blunders, nothing for example like\r\nRelyat Siwel's \"constitut_ing_,\" in place of constitutED.\r\n\r\nHad the sentence been passed upon the ordinary publishers of classical\r\nworks (a humble race of men who are happy when they can publish books\r\nwhich will bring home neither pay nor abuse), it would probably have\r\nbeen thought extremely flattering to all the parties--a sort of beacon\r\nlight, to gladden the hearts of the watchmen of Æschylus. As it was,\r\nProfessor Weston bore his honors meekly, but Mr. or rather Professor\r\nRelyat Siwel, was unfortunately a fiery little man, who was thought by a\r\nlarge circle of admirers to be the first Greek scholar in the great\r\nRepublic; who had expended years of severe toil on his favorite work,\r\nwhich he thought tended strongly to sustain the character of\r\nChristianity, by showing that Plato was not opposed to it; and who,\r\nmoreover, had a cordial dislike to the Gotham school of classical\r\ncritics, and had resolved to have a crack at Mr. Benson the first\r\nfavorable opportunity.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, in the next number of the Zuyderzee, appeared an \"original\r\narticle,\" sandwiched between the first part of \"A Thrilling Romance of\r\nthe Second Century,\" and a \"Tale of the Flower Girl of the Fejee\r\nIslands,\" entitled \"An Essay on the Greek Language, by Professor Relyat\r\nSiwel, LL.D.\"\r\n\r\nIn this interesting essay, Professor Relyat Siwel had attacked Mr. Karl\r\nBenson on a variety of subjects: first he had exposed him by showing\r\nthat the initials \"K. B.,\" at the foot of the editorial, did not mean\r\n\"K. B.,\" but Karl Benson; and hence he ingeniously argued that Mr.\r\nBenson's signing himself \"K. B.,\" when he was not \"K. B.,\" was a fraud\r\non the community. Having thus exposed the malice prepense of the\r\nunfortunate Benson, he intimated that the English participle in \"_ing_\"\r\noften had the meaning of the perfect; and hence that translating a Greek\r\nverb in the perfect by the participle aforesaid, was not such a very\r\nheinous offence after all. This bomb-shell was not, however, thrown into\r\nMr. Benson's magazine without an immense amount of smoke and noise. He\r\nadopted the celebrated ironical Congressional style: \"This eminent Greek\r\nscholar,\" \"this pattern of classical criticism,\" \"this prodigy of the\r\nEnglish universities, who has had his own private tutor, must now be\r\ninformed that the English participle in 'ing,'\" &c., &c. Nor did the\r\nessay on the Greek language stop here. It savagely sneered at \"K. B.'s\"\r\nvanity at having been educated in an English university, and made the\r\nmost cutting remarks on his criticisms in general. Such flowers of\r\nrhetoric as \"literary scavenger,\" \"purse-proud fop,\" \"half-educated\r\nboy,\" &c., were thrown around as thickly as though the Flower Girl of\r\nthe Fejee Islands herself had crossed the path of clerical criticism.\r\n\r\nGreat interest was excited by these little love passages in the\r\ndifferent colleges in the country. The studious young citizens read the\r\n\"criticism\" and the \"essay\" with the most praiseworthy avidity. Karl had\r\nreplied to the essay in a few majestic sentences in the _Editor's\r\nTable_, the effect of which was somewhat impaired by the real editor's\r\nsaying in a note at the foot, that he wasn't going to have any more of\r\nthis sort of thing in his magazine; and that as both parties had had\r\ntheir hearing, it must stop now. In his reply, Karl had offered to do\r\nsomething or other to the Greek language against Professor Relyat Siwel\r\n(President Blank being the judge), for a thousand dollars a side. Great\r\nwas the enthusiasm produced by this offer. Several college periodicals\r\nannounced it as a renovation of the art of criticism, and an innumerable\r\nquantity of young orators hinted it as the beacon blaze mentioned in\r\nAgamemnon, shining on Clytemnestra's battlements, and bringing joy to\r\nArgos. Some discussion was also induced necessarily as to how the\r\nclassic contest was to \"come off.\" A great many young gentlemen insisted\r\nthat it was in the nature of a \"set-to,\" and, for that reason, that\r\nProfessor Relyat Siwel, being the smallest man, should be allowed to\r\n\"choose his corner.\" Many, however, thought that it was in the nature of\r\na steeple chase, and that as the Professor was the lightest weight, he\r\nought to go it \"leaded.\" This vexed question was at length put at rest\r\nby an inquisitive Sophomore's reading the foot-note referred to, in\r\nwhich it was discovered that the fun was over. This blow was followed by\r\nanother, viz., a rumor that Professor Relyat Siwel felt it his duty to\r\ndecline, for the reason that it was by no means certain that _Plato_ had\r\never put up a thousand dollars, or any other amount whatever.\r\n\r\nKarl hailed this decision of the Professor as a \"back out,\" and after\r\nreading his reply to the essay several times in manuscript, and\r\ninnumerable times in print, he came to a conclusion that the controversy\r\ncontained the two great desiderata of all controversies, those for which\r\nignorant men study, lazy men work, ministers quarrel, quiet old\r\ngentlemen write newspaper articles, ladies set their caps, and nations\r\ngo to war--namely triumph and defeat. As he had had the \"last word,\" of\r\ncourse his last arguments were unanswered--he was triumphant, and\r\nProfessor Relyat Siwel beaten.\r\n\r\nThis comforting reflection did not reach so far as the colleges and\r\nuniversities, and within their peaceful walls was heard a voice of anger\r\nand regret. The quiet portion of the undergraduates (who intended to be\r\nclergymen and physicians) mourned the loss of the anticipated contest as\r\na defeat of the cause of learning--one which it would probably survive,\r\nbut still one in which it had been floored. The unquiet portion (who\r\nintended to be lawyers or statesmen) heard the news with virtuous\r\nindignation; by them the senior editor, with even the _Zuyderzee_\r\nitself, was anathematized. In the literary societies, where embryo\r\nlawyers are always largely in the majority, for the reason that\r\nfifteen-sixteenths of the young men of the United States intend, in\r\nearly life, to be Cokes and Littletons, there were passed, by\r\nacclamation, most severe resolutions, expressive of deep regret, that in\r\nthe nineteenth century, in a free country, in the empire state, in a\r\ncity devoted to literature, an editor--one conducting a magazine\r\nprofessing to be favorable to the development of the nation's\r\nresources--should take upon himself, in defiance of public opinion, of\r\nthe wishes of his patrons, of the interests of humanity, to stifle free\r\ndiscussion and the fame of the Attic sages. These resolutions were\r\ngenerally prefaced by a preamble setting forth that whereas the editor\r\nof a magazine known, as _The Zuyderzee_, had done so and so, therefore\r\nit was resolved, &c. In some cases, the societies resolved that they\r\nwould not pay their subscriptions for _The Zuyderzee_ (resolutions which\r\nit is due to them to say they religiously stood by), and in others they\r\nsent copies of the resolutions to the senior editor, who, however,\r\nsurvived the several shocks.\r\n\r\nWe left Ashburner and his host talking about Plautus and agriculture.\r\nThe conversation lasted until they reached the river, and took their\r\nseats in a plainly painted and rather ordinary kind of skiff. Ashburner\r\nnoticed it, and also remarked that instead of the picturesque boat-house\r\nof an English gentleman, Karl used a small wharf at which sloops loaded\r\nand unloaded their cargoes. Ashburner said something of this to Karl,\r\nand Karl said something of ice in the spring, freshets in the fall, and\r\nlow water in the summer; but Harry Benson, as usual, put in his oar, and\r\nexplained the matter more fully, and no doubt more truly: \"You see,\r\nAshburner,\" said he, \"the fact is, we are not a sporting people; our\r\ngentlemen rarely ride, and our ladies never walk. In England, every one\r\nknows, or pretends to know, something of field sports, or riding, or\r\nyachting, or something or other of that sort; and then, too, your\r\nEnglish girl thinks nothing of walking three or four miles; but it is\r\nnot so here. The reason is, partly, that our rich men are business men,\r\nand our poor ones always engaged, and partly because our climate is so\r\ndifferent from yours. I think the climate is the most effective cause of\r\nthe two; you see the year begins (here at the north, I mean) with deep\r\nsnows; at the south they have rain and mud; then, when spring and mild\r\nweather come, they last but a very little while, and we have the melting\r\nred-hot sort of days that you've been through already. To be sure our\r\nIndian-summer is the finest weather for exercise in the world, but then\r\nit only lasts a little while, and after it come the fall rains. It can't\r\nbe denied, though,\" pursued Harry, after pausing a moment, \"that we\r\nmight all exercise a great deal more than we do, if we really wanted to.\r\nIn Virginia, they ride and shoot a great deal more than we do here. But\r\nour girls' heads are busy with polkas rather than walks, and then the\r\nweather makes a good excuse for them. It can't be denied, though,\r\nAshburner, that your countrymen, after being here a short time, exercise\r\nas little as we do ourselves; yet it's hard to say which has the most to\r\ndo with their degeneracy--example or weather.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said Ashburner, \"I should not think that hot or cold weather\r\ncould prevent a gentleman from having a light and handsome boat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it does,\" rejoined Harry, \"not directly, but indirectly. The\r\nweather, business, and amusements, turn attention into other channels,\r\nand consequently our country gentleman does not keep his light skiff\r\nand picturesque boat-house, because there's nobody to row the one or\r\nadmire the other. Now, here's Karl, who lives in the country, and\r\ncontinually talks about country air and country exercise, why, bless\r\nyou! if I hadn't taught him to ride, he wouldn't exercise at all: he\r\ndoes not walk a mile a day; hasn't rowed across the river since he's\r\nlived here; wouldn't join in a cricket-match to save himself from\r\napoplexy; in short, is as lazy a fellow as can possibly be found. Then\r\nour country girls are just the same. Once in a while they ride, but\r\nthere are hundreds of them living in the country who have never been on\r\nhorseback; and when they do know how, they ride rarely, because they've\r\nno one to ride with them,--a young lady's dashing off ten or twelve\r\nmiles with only a servant after her would be thought highly improper.\r\nThen, the way we dress is perfectly ridiculous: nothing\r\nsubstantial--nothing useful; a girl's walking shoes are as thin as\r\npaper; an English nobleman wears heavier boots than one of our laborers.\r\nThe truth is, we have a great deal too much of Paris refinement; we must\r\nget England to come over and _uncivilize_ us. If we do live in a new\r\ncountry, we want to learn a few of the barbarous arts of riding,\r\ndriving, walking, hunting, &c. It's a pity, too, that our young men,\r\ninstead of being hale, hearty fellows, such as you have at the English\r\nuniversities, are generally a thin, hollow-chested, dyspeptic,\r\nconsumptive-looking set--children at twenty, and old men at thirty.\"\r\n\r\nAshburner had noticed this before, and it had surprised him that in a\r\nland where, less than a century ago, the inhabitants were literally\r\ndenizens of the wilderness, he should find fewer field sports and less\r\nattention paid to that class of amusements than in the oldest counties\r\nof England. As Harry said, the weather and business were probably chief\r\ncauses of the evil, while the inundation of French fashions and ideas\r\nhad helped to sustain it.\r\n\r\nBy the time Harry had concluded his lecture, and Karl had got in a\r\ngeneral and particular remonstrance, the one on behalf of all country\r\ngentlemen, and the other on behalf of himself, they had nearly crossed\r\nthe broad river, and the boat was rapidly gliding into a small bay\r\nsurrounded by high wooded banks. The sun had gone down, and the\r\nstillness of a summer evening had settled upon the scene; the swallows\r\nskimmed along the smooth water, which the breeze no longer ruffled, and\r\nfrom the distant sloops that now seemed sleeping on the calm surface,\r\nAshburner could plainly hear the voices of their crews. In a few moments\r\nthe men stopped rowing, and in another moment the boat grated on the\r\ngravelly beach, and the party jumped out. Karl told the men when they\r\nwould return, and then they began clambering up a narrow path which\r\nwound up the hill. Ashburner noticed a light skiff lying in the bay,\r\npainted and fitted up with more than ordinary taste, and with light oars\r\nthat looked as though they were meant for a lady's hand. Soon the path\r\nbrought the little party to the top of the hill, which opened on clear\r\nmeadows, across which could be seen a plain white house, half hidden by\r\nthe old trees that were grouped around it. The Bensons seemed well\r\nacquainted with every thing, for they led the way without hesitation,\r\ntill they reached what seemed to be a carriage-way from the house to the\r\npublic road, that could be seen not a great way off. Ashburner saw at a\r\nglance, as they approached the house, that there was a mingling of old\r\nthings with new in a great deal that concerned it. While the edifice\r\nitself was old, and among old trees that told its age far better than\r\nthe modern verandah which ran around it, or the white paint which\r\ncovered it, the approach to it had been laid out with more modern taste.\r\nThere could be seen the remnants of an old fence that had recently\r\nbounded a road, innocent of windings, and regardful only of distance.\r\nThe trees along the carriage-way had not been set out long, and the\r\nclumps scattered here and there, with a good deal of taste, were but\r\nsaplings, and more closely around the house were tall elms that had been\r\ngrowing many a long year, and told plainly of ancient times and ideas.\r\n\r\nKarl Benson led the way to the front door, and, after answering Harry's\r\ninquiries as to dogs, by saying that no one else need be afraid, as they\r\n(the dogs) always bit him (Karl), he raised an antiquated brass knocker,\r\nand gave two or three taps, which seemed to echo through an immense\r\nnumber of empty rooms. \"Take care,\" said Harry, \"or you'll frighten Miss\r\nMary into something or other.\" \"There's no fear of that,\" replied Karl;\r\n\"she's not so nervous as you.\" Harry was proceeding to rap back; but he\r\nwas interrupted by hearing some one coming to the door, which was the\r\nnext moment thrown open, and Ashburner saw a fine-looking,\r\nplainly-dressed old man, or thought he saw such an one, for it was too\r\ndark to distinguish clearly. \"How are you, Judge?\" said Karl, stepping\r\nforward, and shaking the old gentleman's hand. \"Hullo, Benson! my fine\r\nfellow! is this you? Why, who have you got with you?\" \"This is my\r\nbrother Harry,\" said Karl, \"and this is my friend Mr. Ashburner. Mr.\r\nAshburner, allow me to introduce you to my friend Judge Edwards.\" \"How\r\ndo you do, sir?\" said the Judge, stepping forward, and shaking Ashburner\r\nby the hand; \"very happy to make your acquaintance, sir.\"\r\n\r\nAshburner bowed his acknowledgments and intimated, according to custom,\r\nthat he was very happy, and then, after slapping Harry on the back, and\r\nasking why he hadn't been over before, the Judge asked every body to\r\nwalk in. They did so--the Judge leading the way--and calling to several\r\nindividuals of the female gender, as Miss Squires would say, for light.\r\nThe call was a necessary one, for the day had been as hot and sultry as\r\nthough it were August; and on a summer evening, in both town and\r\ncountry, it is a frequent custom to sit in the dark by the open windows,\r\nand enjoy the cool air which these times always bring. The excellence of\r\nthe custom did not, however, prevent Ashburner from falling over a\r\nchair, or Harry from running against a centre table, with a crash that\r\nleft the party in some doubt whether he or the table was upset. \"Bless\r\nme,\" said the Judge, who noticed these mishaps, \"they ought to have had\r\nlights here,\" and then he added, in explanation, \"that in hot weather\r\n_they_ liked to sit in the dark, as it seemed cooler and kept the\r\nmusquitoes out; which excuse for a very proper, pleasant and sensible\r\ncustom, is invariably given in the United States, in all houses, rich or\r\npoor, high or low, whenever a stranger happens to find the parlor\r\nunlighted.\" In a few moments, however, a girl made her appearance with\r\nthe usual inquiry, \"Did you call, sir?\" \"Yes, yes, Susan, bring some\r\nlights here as soon as you can!\"\r\n\r\nA pause ensued, which was broken by the Judge's remarking that it had\r\nbeen a very hot day, and Harry Benson's assenting, \"Yes, very hot,\r\nreally wonderful weather for the time of year.\" Ashburner tried to say\r\nsomething, but it is hard talking in the dark, to a gentleman you have\r\nnever seen, especially when you are in his own house; so Ashburner gave\r\nit up after one or two attempts, and another pause ensued, fortunately\r\nbroken by Susan's return with a couple of lighted candles, in\r\nold-fashioned silver candlesticks.\r\n\r\nAshburner now looked at the Judge with some interest, which was rather\r\ncooled down by observing that he was looking with an equal curiosity at\r\nhimself. This scrutiny, though brief, seemed, however, satisfactory, for\r\nthe Judge told Susan to tell Miss Mary that Mr. Benson and one or two\r\nother gentlemen were there.\r\n\r\nAshburner's glance showed him that the Judge was a large and\r\nintelligent-looking man apparently about fifty, and though dressed\r\ncarelessly, bearing the marks of a gentleman. But Ashburner also saw\r\nthat though the Judge was a gentleman, he was by no means a fashionable\r\nor even a polished one. He was simply one of those well-bred men in whom\r\nsimplicity is more perceptible than refinement, while good sense and\r\ngood feelings prevent any gross breaches of etiquette.\r\n\r\nFrom looking at its owner, Ashburner turned to look at the room they\r\nwere seated in. It was a parlor of medium size, with a low ceiling and\r\nplainly papered walls. On the latter hung several old-fashioned\r\nportraits, one of which was evidently the Judge's, another his wife's,\r\nand two more his parents'. Besides, there were one or two drawings, and\r\ntheir pleasing gracefulness and ease formed an agreeable contrast to the\r\nprim and starched old relics they hung beside. In the middle of the room\r\nwas a centre table of the same old-fashioned cast as the pictures, but\r\ncovered with those little articles of taste that none but a lady can\r\nselect and arrange.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Ashburner is an Englishman, Judge,\" said Karl, after some other\r\nremarks, \"and I am showing him how simply we American farmers live.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it possible?\" said the Judge, looking intently at Ashburner; \"well,\r\nnow, I should never have thought so if you had not told me. He looks\r\nmore like an American than a foreigner: it's very singular, quite\r\nunusual. Do you know,\" pursued the Judge, talking to Karl, but keeping\r\nhis eyes intently fixed on Ashburner, \"do you know that I can almost\r\nalways tell a foreigner as soon I see him? Why it was only yesterday a\r\ncouple of fellows came into the field where I was, and wanted work, and\r\nbefore they said a word, just as soon as I saw them I knew they were\r\nEnglishmen, and told Mary so.\"\r\n\r\nAshburner colored a little at this implied comparison, and felt annoyed\r\non seeing that Harry Benson was enjoying the joke. To turn the\r\nconversation, he said something about the Judge's having a pretty place,\r\nand inquired whether his judicial duties allowed him to be there a good\r\ndeal of the time. At this inquiry all three gentlemen laughed, and his\r\nhonor explained that once upon a time he had been appointed judge by the\r\ngovernor, and had acted as such for four or five years, but that for the\r\nlast fifteen years he had merely enjoyed the title, and was but a plain\r\ncountry gentleman, as he had been all his life. Ashburner inquired if he\r\nhad not been educated for the bar. \"Oh, no,\" said the Judge, smiling,\r\n\"that was not at all necessary for a judge of the Common Pleas, though\r\nfor that matter, as Edmund Burke said in his speech on American affairs,\r\n'in America every man's something of a lawyer.' You see, Mr. Ashburner,\r\nthere used to be five of us. Some were farmers and some were lawyers,\r\nalways one or the other, for the pay was not very high, and nobody but\r\nfarmers and lawyers have time to work for nothing in this country. By\r\nthe bye,\" said the Judge, \"I never knew any one yet a judge of the\r\nCommon Pleas, unless he was either a lawyer or a farmer: did you,\r\nBenson?\" Karl answered in the negative, and the Judge continued: \"If\r\nthere were any cases before us that were of importance, the lawyers\r\nwould carry them up to the Supreme Court. But I never could discover\r\nthat it made much difference who were judges in the Common Pleas, for\r\nthe judges who were lawyers would have their opinions reversed just\r\nabout as often as we farmers. I suppose you English gentlemen would\r\nthink it a great piece of nonsense, taking three or four men for judges\r\nwho had never practised at the bar; but the truth is, that such men look\r\nclosely at the real justice of the matter, and pay very little\r\nattention to technicalities, while your second-rate lawyers if they are\r\nmade judges in an inferior court, study nothing but technicalities, and\r\nmisapply them half the time besides. Then you see we want cheap\r\nexpeditious courts for the trial of small cases--whether the court is\r\nwrong or right is not so much matter--law is a lottery anyhow, and the\r\nfact is, the sooner a case is decided and out of the way, the better for\r\nboth parties. I never knew myself of any man's making a fortune by going\r\nto law, though I have heard of such things. But I suppose, Mr.\r\nAshburner, that you much prefer the old-fashioned English courts, with\r\nthe judges in gowns and wigs, and every thing done in the most solemn\r\nmanner. Now, to tell the truth, Mr. Ashburner, don't you think it great\r\nnonsense for us to have one or two plain business men like me, hoisted\r\non to the bench to administer laws which Coke and Blackstone studied for\r\na lifetime, and which in your own country no one is thought fit to\r\nadminister them till he has spent years in practising, and has raised\r\nhimself up by his own labors?\"\r\n\r\nAshburner became interested in all this, and was struck with the\r\nintelligence of the speaker, who, notwithstanding his plainness and his\r\nremarks about foreigners, seemed still to have the tastes and delicate\r\nperceptions of the educated man. He asked several questions as to the\r\nAmerican judiciary, and informed the Judge that the works of some of the\r\nAmerican luminaries of the law occupied a high place in the estimation\r\nof English lawyers, were noticed in English reviews, and quoted in\r\nEnglish courts. The young Englishman could see, as he said this, that\r\nthe Judge's face lit up with an expression very different from that of\r\neither of the Bensons, and he felt pleased when he heard him say with\r\nsome exultation, \"Your countrymen are not such bad fellows after all,\r\nsir; I really believe they always do us justice, and there are no\r\nnational confessions to be made.\"\r\n\r\nAshburner was proceeding to state that in England the old feeling of\r\ncontempt had entirely disappeared, when the door opened, and a girl of\r\nabout eighteen entered. She threw a quick but calm glance around the\r\nroom, seemed a little confused at the number of gentlemen, and then,\r\nrecognizing Karl, went up to him, and shaking hands, asked after his\r\nwife. \"Mary,\" said the Judge, as soon as the inquiry was answered, \"this\r\nis your old friend, Mr. Harry Benson, and this is Mr. Ashburner, an\r\nEnglish gentleman; Mr. Ashburner, my daughter, sir.\"\r\n\r\nThe young lady shook hands with Harry, and bowed with more reserve to\r\nthe stranger, who contrived to hand her his chair, and place himself\r\nquietly in the next one.\r\n\r\nThe first thought of Ashburner as he looked at his companion was, \"How\r\nsweetly pretty she is!\" the next, \"She is certainly very different from\r\nany girl I have seen yet in this country;\" and a few moments'\r\nconversation confirmed each opinion. She was in truth a very pretty\r\ngirl, not strictly handsome, but of that bright and good-natured winning\r\nbeauty that always indicates a warm, kind heart, and always insures its\r\nowner friends as well as admirers. She was below the average height,\r\nwith a girlish, though pretty, rounded figure; her dark brown hair fell\r\nsmoothly over a white, clear brow, and came down so as partially to hide\r\na rosy cheek; her dress was simple, but the taste and neatness it\r\ndisplayed showed that its wearer was a person of refinement.\r\n\r\nAshburner opened the conversation by saying that he supposed Miss\r\nEdwards was a resident of the country, and inquiring how she liked it.\r\nShe answered that she far preferred it to the city, and a little\r\nargument ensued, in the course of which she assured Ashburner that the\r\ncountry was always the pleasantest--one always had so many little things\r\nto be interested in, and so much more time for reading. \"There was\r\nnothing,\" she said, \"of the formality and coldness of city life, nor of\r\nits frivolities.\" It amused Ashburner to hear this philosophy from a\r\ngirl of eighteen, one who was pretty enough to command more than her\r\nshare of attention, and who was evidently not of those young ladies who,\r\nsincerely desiring to pursue the strict path of duty, make the great\r\nmistake of deriding gayety or pleasure whereever they may happen to find\r\nit. In the meanwhile the other gentlemen became engrossed in the\r\nprobable profits of the railroad which was to adorn the other side of\r\nthe river, and occasional allusions to the tariff, and chances of the\r\nvarious candidates for the presidency, in all of which the Bensons\r\njoined as warmly, and laid down their positions as dogmatically (their\r\ncontempt for their country, its laws, and affairs, to the contrary\r\nnotwithstanding), as though they had not been expressing, an hour or two\r\nbefore, the most entire ignorance and thorough disdain of and for\r\nrailroads, politics, and politicians, and particularly the railroad just\r\nmentioned, and the politics and politicians of the United States. If\r\nAshburner had listened to this, he would have learned that it is very\r\noften the custom among American gentlemen to sneer at and contemn\r\npolitical measures, among strangers (no matter whether foreigners or\r\nnot), as though the elective franchise, and every thing connected with\r\nit, was an immoral sort of vulgarity that no gentleman was expected to\r\nknow any thing about; a thing to be abandoned to the _canaille_ and an\r\ninteresting set of patriots known as the Hemispherical Club, who varied\r\ntheir patriotic duties by breaking their opponents' heads and their\r\ncountry's ballot-boxes, and who, moreover, were so modest that they\r\nnever could be induced to exercise the glorious right of depositing\r\ntheir suffrages, until the candidates on their side had \"planked up\"\r\nfor the benefit of the Club; whilst among their friends and neighbors,\r\nthese same gentlemen talk politics in the most furious and excited\r\nmanner, each person insisting that he knows all about them, and that\r\nevery body else will see he's right before the year's out. But\r\nunfortunately Ashburner had got so deeply engrossed with the lessons in\r\nphilosophy he was receiving that he entirely forgot all about his\r\nfriends. He had discovered that Miss Edwards had been among the \"Upper\r\nTen\" of New-York, and knew many of the acquaintances he had made. She\r\nspoke of them with so much correctness that he was convinced of her\r\nexcellent judgment in character, while the artlessness with which she\r\nspoke, and the almost amusing simplicity of some of her remarks,\r\nindicated that she had not studied human nature, as too many of us do,\r\nby experience. Ashburner, like most young men, thought himself a shrewd\r\nobserver, particularly female character (which, by the bye, is what\r\nyoung men know least about), but the subject he was studying puzzled\r\nhim; Miss Edwards evinced such a mixture of penetration and simplicity\r\nthat he could not understand how both could exist together. This sort of\r\ncharacter has baffled many wiser persons than Mr. Ashburner, who have\r\ninvestigated it with the same interest. The study of young ladies is\r\ndangerous at all times to a young man, and most particularly when he\r\ndoes it from philosophical motives; and if any caste of character is\r\nmore dangerous than another, it is that which blends penetration and\r\nsimplicity; the one interests while the other charms. Not knowing these\r\ntruths, Mr. Ashburner had mentally resolved to enter upon this field of\r\nphilosophical research. The simplicity, the humor, the acuteness of\r\nobservation, the intelligence, and perhaps the pretty face of his\r\ncompanion, tended to interest him in an unusual manner. And she, too,\r\nseemed attracted by the young Englishman, whose education and\r\nintelligence rendered him an agreeable companion to any educated and\r\nintelligent person. It was pleasant for Ashburner to find a young lady\r\nwho could talk about something else than the polka or the last\r\nparty,--who, in short, had read his favorite authors, and could join in\r\nadmiring them without affectation; and he felt quite annoyed when Karl\r\nBenson interrupted the _tête-à-tête_. As they all rose, the Judge\r\napproached Ashburner and said, \"I shall be happy to see you again, Mr.\r\nAshburner; if you stay at Mr. Benson's, and have nothing better to do,\r\ncome over whenever you please; you must excuse my calling on you, for we\r\nold fellows are privileged, you know.\" Ashburner said he would be very\r\nhappy to do so, and was \"desirous of learning something more about\r\nAmerican jurisprudence, if Judge Edwards would allow the trouble it\r\nwould occasion him.\" The Judge of course said he would bestow all the\r\ninformation in his power, and added, that he had a high regard for\r\nEngland and Englishmen. \"I like a great many of your customs,\" said the\r\nJudge, \"much better than I do our own. Your girls have a physical\r\neducation which preserves their health and freshness, while ours sit\r\nstill and waste their time and ruin their health. Now here's Mary, who\r\nis a country girl, and yet hardly exercises from one week's end to\r\nanother.\" The Judge said this in a reproving sort of way, but he looked\r\ndown on his daughter with a smile as he said it; and she smiled back in\r\nthe same way as she said, \"Oh no, father, you forget that _now_ I ride\r\nto the post-office every day.\" It was plain that such reproofs as this\r\nwas all that Mary ever knew (and as Ashburner marked the affectionate\r\nlook that passed between father and daughter, he thought all that she\r\never needed). \"How pretty she looks (he thought to himself) standing\r\nthere by her rough old father, looking up to him with that pleased,\r\nconfiding look; how much prettier than a fashionable belle who is\r\nashamed of her father because he is plain, and shows it whenever there\r\nis some one by, I think\"--\r\n\r\n\"It is time we were over the river,\" said Karl, interrupting Mr.\r\nAshburner in his contemplations.\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" said Mr. Ashburner to himself, as they were crossing the\r\nwater on their way home, \"I think I will call to-morrow and see if she\r\nreally is as artless as she seems;\" and a moment after to his\r\ncompanions, \"I believe I will practice rowing a few hours a day for the\r\nnext few days; physicians say it's a capital exercise.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" said Karl, \"you had better not. Exercise on horseback.\"\r\n\r\nSaid Harry, \"Its precious little rowing you'll do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" Ashburner rejoined, \"I will, and to convince you, I mean to go\r\nalone.\"\r\n\r\nWe will say with one Virgil--\r\n\r\n     \"Felix qui protuit rerum cognoscere causas.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLEONORA TO TASSO.\r\n\r\nWRITTEN FOR THE INTERNATIONAL MAGAZINE\r\n\r\nBY MRS.

Kiss me, pretty darling! I have done my best for thee.\"\r\n\r\nFurthermore, that the adventurer might lack no possible advantage\r\ntowards a fair start in life, this excellent old dame gave him a token,\r\nby which he was to introduce himself to a certain magistrate, member of\r\nthe council, merchant, and elder of the church (the four capacities\r\nconstituting but one man), who stood at the head of society in the\r\nneighboring metropolis. The token was neither more nor less than a\r\nsingle word, which Mother Rigby whispered to the scarecrow, and which\r\nthe scarecrow was to whisper to the merchant.\r\n\r\n\"Gouty as the old fellow is, he'll run thy errands for thee, when once\r\nthou hast given him that word in his ear,\" said the old witch. \"Mother\r\nRigby knows the worshipful Justice Gookin, and the worshipful Justice\r\nknows Mother Rigby!\"\r\n\r\nHere the witch thrust her wrinkled face close to the puppet's, chuckling\r\nirrepressibly, and fidgeting all through her system, with delight at the\r\nidea which she meant to communicate.\r\n\r\n\"The worshipful Master Gookin,\" whispered she, \"hath a comely maiden to\r\nhis daughter! And hark ye, my pet! Thou hast a fair outside, and a\r\npretty wit enough of thine own. Yea; a pretty wit enough! Thou wilt\r\nthink better of it when thou hast seen more of other people's wits. Now,\r\nwith thy outside and thy inside, thou art the very man to win a young\r\ngirl's heart. Never doubt it! I tell thee it shall be so. Put but a bold\r\nface on the matter, sigh, smile, flourish thy hat, thrust forth thy leg\r\nlike a dancing-master, put thy right hand to the left side of thy\r\nwaistcoat, and pretty Polly Gookin is thine own!\"\r\n\r\nAll this while, the new creature had been sucking in and exhaling the\r\nvapory fragrance of his pipe, and seemed now to continue this occupation\r\nas much for the enjoyment it afforded, as because it was an essential\r\ncondition of his existence. It was wonderful to see how exceedingly like\r\na human being it behaved. Its eyes (for it appeared to possess a pair)\r\nwere bent on Mother Rigby, and at suitable junctures, it nodded or shook\r\nits head. Neither did it lack words proper for the occasion.--\"Really!\r\nIndeed! Pray tell me! Is it possible! Upon my word! By no means! Oh! Ah!\r\nHem!\"--and other such weighty utterances as imply attention, inquiry,\r\nacquiescence, or dissent, on the part of the auditor. Even had you stood\r\nby, and seen the scarecrow made, you could scarcely have resisted the\r\nconviction that it perfectly understood the cunning counsels which the\r\nold witch poured into its counterfeit of an ear. The more earnestly it\r\napplied its lips to the pipe, the more distinctly was its human likeness\r\nstamped among visible realities; the more sagacious grew its expression;\r\nthe more lifelike its gestures and movements; and the more intelligibly\r\naudible its voice. Its garments, too, glistened so much the brighter\r\nwith an illusory magnificence. The very pipe, in which burned the spell\r\nof all this wonderwork, ceased to appear as a smoke-blackened earthen\r\nstump, and became a meerschaum, with painted bowl and amber mouthpiece.\r\n\r\nIt might be apprehended, however, that as the life of the illusion\r\nseemed identical with the vapor of the pipe, it would terminate\r\nsimultaneously with the reduction of the tobacco to ashes. But the\r\nbeldam foresaw the difficulty.\r\n\r\n\"Hold thou the pipe, my precious one,\" said she, \"while I fill it for\r\nthee again.\"\r\n\r\nIt was sorrowful to behold how the fine gentleman began to fade back\r\ninto a scarecrow, while Mother Rigby shook the ashes out of the pipe,\r\nand proceeded to replenish it from her tobacco-box.\r\n\r\n\"Dickon,\" cried she, in her high, sharp tone, \"another coal for this\r\npipe.\"\r\n\r\nNo sooner said, than the intensely red speck of fire was glowing within\r\nthe pipe-bowl; and the scarecrow, without waiting for the witch's\r\nbidding, applied the tube to his lips, and drew in a few short,\r\nconvulsive whiffs, which soon, however, became regular and equable.\r\n\r\n\"Now, mine own heart's darling,\" quoth Mother Rigby, \"whatever may\r\nhappen to thee, thou must stick to thy pipe. Thy life is in it; and\r\nthat, at least, thou knowest well, if thou knowest naught besides. Stick\r\nto thy pipe, I say! Smoke, puff, blow thy cloud; and tell the people, if\r\nany question be made, that it is for thy health, and that so the\r\nphysician orders thee to do. And, sweet one, when thou shalt find thy\r\npipe getting low, go apart into some corner, and (first filling\r\nthyself with smoke) cry sharply,--'Dickon, a fresh pipe of\r\ntobacco!'--and--'Dickon, another coal for my pipe!'--and have it into\r\nthy pretty mouth as speedily as may be. Else, instead of a gallant\r\ngentleman, in a gold-laced coat, thou wilt be but a jumble of sticks and\r\ntattered clothes, and a bag of straw, and a withered pumpkin! Now\r\ndepart, my treasure, and good luck go with thee!\"\r\n\r\n\"Never fear, mother!\" said the figure, in a stout voice, and sending\r\nforth a courageous whiff of smoke. \"I will thrive if an honest man and a\r\ngentleman may!\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, thou wilt be the death of me!\" cried the old witch, convulsed with\r\nlaughter. \"That was well said. If an honest man and a gentleman may!\r\nThou playest thy part to perfection. Get along with thee for a smart\r\nfellow; and I will wager on thy head, as a man of pith and substance,\r\nwith a brain, and what they call a heart, and all else that a man should\r\nhave, against any other thing on two legs. I hold myself a better witch\r\nthan yesterday, for thy sake. Did not I make thee? And I defy any witch\r\nin New England to make such another! Here; take my staff along with\r\nthee!\"\r\n\r\nThe staff, though it was but a plain oaken stick, immediately took the\r\naspect of a gold-headed cane.\r\n\r\n\"That gold head has as much sense in it as thine own,\" said Mother\r\nRigby, \"and it will guide thee straight to worshipful Master Gookin's\r\ndoor. Get thee gone, my pretty pet, my darling, my precious one, my\r\ntreasure; and if any ask thy name, it is Feathertop. For thou hast a\r\nfeather in thy hat, and I have thrust a handful of feathers into the\r\nhollow of thy head, and thy wig, too, is of the fashion they call\r\nFeathertop,--so be Feathertop thy name!\"\r\n\r\nAnd, issuing from the cottage, Feathertop strode manfully towards town.\r\nMother Rigby stood at the threshold, well pleased to see how the\r\nsunbeams glistened on him, as if all his magnificence were real, and how\r\ndiligently and lovingly he smoked his pipe, and how handsomely he\r\nwalked, in spite of a little stiffness of his legs. She watched him,\r\nuntil out of sight, and threw a witch-benediction after her darling,\r\nwhen a turn of the road snatched him from her view.\r\n\r\nBetimes in the forenoon, when the principal street of the neighboring\r\ntown was just at its acme of life and bustle, a stranger of very\r\ndistinguished figure was seen on the side-walk. His port, as well as his\r\ngarments, betokened nothing short of nobility. He wore a\r\nrichly-embroidered plum-colored coat, a waistcoat of costly velvet,\r\nmagnificently adorned with golden foliage, a pair of splendid scarlet\r\nbreeches, and the finest and glossiest of white silk stockings. His head\r\nwas covered with a peruque, so daintily powdered and adjusted that it\r\nwould have been sacrilege to disorder it with a hat; which, therefore\r\n(and it was a gold-laced hat, set off with a snowy feather), he carried\r\nbeneath his arm. On the breast of his coat glistened a star. He managed\r\nhis gold-headed cane with an airy grace, peculiar to the fine gentleman\r\nof the period; and to give the highest possible finish to his equipment,\r\nhe had lace ruffles at his wrist, of a most ethereal delicacy,\r\nsufficiently avouching how idle and aristocratic must be the hands which\r\nthey half concealed.\r\n\r\nIt was a remarkable point in the accoutrement of this brilliant\r\npersonage, that he held in his left hand a fantastic kind of a pipe,\r\nwith an exquisitely painted bowl, and an amber mouthpiece. This he\r\napplied to his lips, as often as every five or six paces, and inhaled a\r\ndeep whiff of smoke, which, after being retained a moment in his lungs,\r\nmight be seen to eddy gracefully from his mouth and nostrils.\r\n\r\nAs may well be supposed, the street was all a-stir to find out the\r\nstranger's name.\r\n\r\n\"It is some great nobleman, beyond question,\" said one of the town's\r\npeople. \"Do you see the star at his breast?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay; it is too bright to be seen,\" said another. \"Yes; he must needs be\r\na nobleman, as you say. But, by what conveyance, think you, can his\r\nlordship have voyaged or travelled hither? There has been no vessel from\r\nthe old country for a month past; and if he have arrived overland from\r\nthe southward, pray where are his attendants and equipage?\"\r\n\r\n\"He needs no equipage to set off his rank,\" remarked a third. \"If he\r\ncame among us in rags, nobility would shine through a hole in his elbow.\r\nI never saw such dignity of aspect. He has the old Norman blood in his\r\nveins, I warrant him.\"\r\n\r\n\"I rather take him to be a Dutchman, or one of your high Germans,\" said\r\nanother citizen. \"The men of those countries have always the pipe at\r\ntheir mouths.\"\r\n\r\n\"And so has a Turk,\" answered his companion. \"But, in my judgment, this\r\nstranger hath been bred at the French court, and hath there learned\r\npoliteness and grace of manner, which none understand so well as the\r\nnobility of France. That gait, now! A vulgar spectator might deem it\r\nstiff--he might call it a hitch and jerk--but, to my eye, it hath an\r\nunspeakable majesty, and must have been acquired by constant observation\r\nof the department of the Grand Monarque. The stranger's character and\r\noffice are evident enough. He is a French Ambassador, come to treat with\r\nour rulers about the cession of Canada.\"\r\n\r\n\"More probably a Spaniard,\" said another, \"and hence his yellow\r\ncomplexion. Or, most likely, he is from the Havana, or from some port on\r\nthe Spanish Main, and comes to make investigation about the piracies\r\nwhich our Governor is thought to connive at. Those settlers in Peru and\r\nMexico have skins as yellow as the gold which they dig out of their\r\nmines.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yellow, or not,\" cried a lady, \"he is a beautiful man!--so tall, so\r\nslender!--such a fine, noble face, with so well-shaped a nose, and all\r\nthat delicacy of expression about the mouth! And, bless me, how bright\r\nhis star is! It positively shoots out flames!\"\r\n\r\n\"So do your eyes, fair lady,\" said the stranger with a bow, and a\r\nflourish of his pipe; for he was just passing at the instant. \"Upon my\r\nhonor, they have quite dazzled me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Was ever so original and exquisite a compliment?\" murmured the lady, in\r\nan ecstasy of delight.\r\n\r\nAmid the general admiration excited by the stranger's appearance, there\r\nwere only two dissenting voices. One was that of an impertinent cur,\r\nwhich, after snuffing at the heels of the glistening figure, put its\r\ntail between its legs, and skulked into its master's back-yard,\r\nvociferating an execrable howl. The other dissentient was a young child,\r\nwho squalled at the fullest stretch of his lungs, and babbled some\r\nunintelligible nonsense about a pumpkin.\r\n\r\nFeathertop, meanwhile, pursued his way along the street. Except for the\r\nfew complimentary words to the lady, and, now and then, a slight\r\ninclination of the head, in requital of the profound reverences of the\r\nbystanders, he seemed wholly absorbed in his pipe. There needed no other\r\nproof of his rank and consequence, than the perfect equanimity with\r\nwhich he comported himself, while the curiosity and admiration of the\r\ntown swelled almost into clamor around him. With a crowd gathering\r\nbehind his footsteps, he finally reached the mansion-house of the\r\nworshipful Justice Gookin, entered the gate, ascended the steps of the\r\nfront door, and knocked. In the interim, before his summons was\r\nanswered, the stranger was observed to shake the ashes out of his pipe.\r\n\r\n\"What did he say, in that sharp voice?\" inquired one of the spectators.\r\n\r\n\"Nay, I know not,\" answered his friend. \"But the sun dazzles my eyes\r\nstrangely. How dim and faded his lordship looks, all of a sudden! Bless\r\nmy wits, what is the matter with me?\"\r\n\r\n\"The wonder is,\" said the other, \"that his pipe, which was out only an\r\ninstant ago, should be all alight again, and with the reddest coal I\r\never saw. There is something mysterious about this stranger. What a\r\nwhiff of smoke was that! Dim and faded, did you call him? Why, as he\r\nturns about, the star on his breast is all a blaze.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is, indeed,\" said his companion; \"and it will go near to dazzle\r\npretty Polly Gookin, whom I see peeping at it, out of the chamber\r\nwindow.\"\r\n\r\nThe door being now opened, Feathertop turned to the crowd, made a\r\nstately bend of his body, like a great man acknowledging the reverence\r\nof the meaner sort, and vanished into the house. There was a mysterious\r\nkind of a smile, if it might not better be called a grin or grimace,\r\nupon his visage; but of all the throng that beheld him, not an\r\nindividual appears to have possessed insight enough to detect the\r\nillusive character of the stranger, except a little child and a cur-dog.\r\n\r\nOur legend here loses somewhat of its continuity, and, passing over the\r\npreliminary explanation between Feathertop and the merchant, goes in\r\nquest of the pretty Polly Gookin. She was a damsel of a soft, round\r\nfigure, with light hair and blue eyes, and a fair rosy face, which\r\nseemed neither very shrewd nor very simple. This young lady had caught a\r\nglimpse of the glistening stranger, while standing at the threshold, and\r\nhad forthwith put on a laced cap, a string of beads, her finest\r\nkerchief, and her stiffest damask petticoat, in preparation for the\r\ninterview. Hurrying from her chamber to the parlor, she had ever since\r\nbeen viewing herself in the large looking-glass, and practising pretty\r\nairs--now a smile, now a ceremonious dignity of aspect, and now a softer\r\nsmile than the former--kissing her hand, likewise, tossing her head, and\r\nmanaging her fan; while, within the mirror, an unsubstantial little maid\r\nrepeated every gesture, and did all the foolish things that Polly did,\r\nbut without making her ashamed of them. In short, it was the fault of\r\npretty Polly's ability, rather than her will, if she failed to be as\r\ncomplete an artifice as the illustrious Feathertop himself; and, when\r\nshe thus tampered with her own simplicity, the witch's phantom might\r\nwell hope to win her.\r\n\r\nNo sooner did Polly hear her father's gouty footsteps approaching the\r\nparlor door, accompanied with the stiff clatter of Feathertop's\r\nhigh-heeled shoes, than she seated herself bolt upright, and innocently\r\nbegan warbling a song.\r\n\r\n\"Polly! daughter Polly!\" cried the old merchant. \"Come hither, child.\"\r\n\r\nMaster Gookin's aspect, as he opened the door, was doubtful and\r\ntroubled.\r\n\r\n\"This gentleman,\" continued he, presenting the stranger, \"is the\r\nChevalier Feathertop--nay, I beg his pardon, my Lord Feathertop,--who\r\nhath brought me a token of remembrance from an ancient friend of mine.\r\nPay your duty to his lordship, child, and honor him as his quality\r\ndeserves.\"\r\n\r\nAfter these few words of introduction, the worshipful magistrate\r\nimmediately quitted the room. But, even in that brief moment, had the\r\nfair Polly glanced aside at her father, instead of devoting herself\r\nwholly to the brilliant guest, she might have taken warning of some\r\nmischief nigh at hand. The old man was nervous, fidgety, and very pale.\r\nPurposing a smile of courtesy, he had deformed his face with a sort of\r\ngalvanic grin, which, when Feathertop's back was turned, he exchanged\r\nfor a scowl; at the same time shaking his fist, and stamping his gouty\r\nfoot--an incivility which brought its retribution along with it. The\r\ntruth appears to have been, that Mother Rigby's word of introduction,\r\nwhatever it might be, had operated far more on the rich merchant's\r\nfears, than on his good-will. Moreover, being a man of wonderfully acute\r\nobservation, he had noticed that the painted figures on the bowl of\r\nFeathertop's pipe were in motion. Looking more closely, he became\r\nconvinced that these figures were a party of little demons, each duly\r\nprovided with horns and a tail, and dancing hand in hand, with gestures\r\nof diabolical merriment, round the circumference of the pipe-bowl. As if\r\nto confirm his suspicions, while Master Gookin ushered his guest along a\r\ndusky passage, from his private room to the parlor, the star on\r\nFeathertop's breast had scintillated actual flames, and threw a\r\nflickering gleam upon the wall, the ceiling, and the floor.\r\n\r\nWith such sinister prognostics manifesting themselves on all hands, it\r\nis not to be marvelled at that the merchant should have felt that he\r\nwas committing his daughter to a very questionable acquaintance. He\r\ncursed, in his secret soul, the insinuating elegance of Feathertop's\r\nmanners, as this brilliant personage bowed, smiled, put his hand on his\r\nheart, inhaled a long whiff from his pipe, and enriched the atmosphere\r\nwith the smoky vapor of a fragrant and visible sigh. Gladly would poor\r\nMaster Gookin have thrust his dangerous guest into the street. But there\r\nwas a constraint and terror within him. This respectable old gentleman,\r\nwe fear, at an earlier period of life, had given some pledge or other to\r\nthe Evil Principle, and perhaps was now to redeem it by the sacrifice of\r\nhis daughter.\r\n\r\nIt so happened that the parlor-door was partly of glass, shaded by a\r\nsilken curtain, the folds of which hung a little awry. So strong was the\r\nmerchant's interest in witnessing what was to ensue between the fair\r\nPolly and the gallant Feathertop, that after quitting the room, he could\r\nby no means refrain from peeping through the crevice of the curtain.\r\n\r\nBut there was nothing very miraculous to be seen; nothing--except the\r\ntrifles previously noticed--to confirm the idea of a supernatural peril,\r\nenvironing the pretty Polly. The stranger, it is true, was evidently a\r\nthorough and practised man of the world, systematic and self-possessed,\r\nand therefore the sort of person to whom a parent ought not to confide a\r\nsimple young girl, without due watchfulness for the result. The worthy\r\nmagistrate, who had been conversant with all degrees and qualities of\r\nmankind, could not but perceive every motion and gesture of the\r\ndistinguished Feathertop came in its proper place; nothing had been left\r\nrude or native in him; a well-digested conventionalism had incorporated\r\nitself thoroughly with his substance, and transformed him into a work of\r\nart. Perhaps it was this peculiarity that invested him with a species of\r\nghastliness and awe. It is the effect of any thing completely and\r\nconsummately artificial, in human shape, that the person impresses us as\r\nan unreality, and as having hardly pith enough to cast a shadow upon the\r\nfloor. As regarded Feathertop, all this resulted in a wild, extravagant,\r\nand fantastical impression, as if his life and being were akin to the\r\nsmoke that curled upward from his pipe.\r\n\r\nBut pretty Polly Gookin felt not thus. The pair were now promenading the\r\nroom; Feathertop with his dainty stride, and no less dainty grimace; the\r\ngirl with a native maidenly grace, just touched, not spoiled, by a\r\nslightly affected manner, which seemed caught from the perfect artifice\r\nof her companion. The longer the interview continued, the more charmed\r\nwas pretty Polly, until, within the first quarter of an hour (as the old\r\nmagistrate noted by his watch), she was evidently beginning to be in\r\nlove. Nor need it have been witchcraft that subdued her in such a hurry;\r\nthe poor child's heart, it may be, was so very fervent, that it melted\r\nher with its own warmth, as reflected from the hollow semblance of a\r\nlover. No matter what Feathertop said, his words found depth and\r\nreverberation in her ear; no matter what he did, his action was heroic\r\nto her eye. And, by this time, it is to be supposed, there was a blush\r\non Polly's cheek, a tender smile about her mouth, and a liquid softness\r\nin her glance; while the star kept coruscating on Feathertop's breast,\r\nand the little demons careered, with more frantic merriment than ever,\r\nabout the circumference of his pipe-bowl. Oh, pretty Polly Gookin, why\r\nshould these imps rejoice so madly that a silly maiden's heart was about\r\nto be given to a shadow! Is it so unusual a misfortune?--so rare a\r\ntriumph?\r\n\r\nBy and by, Feathertop paused, and throwing himself into an imposing\r\nattitude, seemed to summon the fair girl to survey his figure, and\r\nresist him longer, if she could. His star, his embroidery, his buckles,\r\nglowed, at that instant, with unutterable splendor; the picturesque hues\r\nof his attire took a richer depth of coloring; there was a gleam and\r\npolish over his whole presence, betokening the perfect witchery of\r\nwell-ordered manners. The maiden raised her eyes, and suffered them to\r\nlinger upon her companion with a bashful and admiring gaze. Then, as if\r\ndesirous of judging what value her own simple comeliness might have,\r\nside by side with so much brilliancy, she cast a glance towards the\r\nfull-length looking-glass, in front of which they happened to be\r\nstanding. It was one of the truest plates in the world, and incapable of\r\nflattery. No sooner did the images, therein reflected, meet Polly's eye,\r\nthan she shrieked, shrank from the stranger's side, gazed at him for a\r\nmoment, in the wildest dismay, and sank insensible upon the floor.\r\nFeathertop, likewise, had looked towards the mirror, and there beheld,\r\nnot the glittering mockery of his outside show, but a picture of the\r\nsordid patchwork of his real composition, stript of all witchcraft.\r\n\r\nThe wretched simulacrum! We almost pity him! He threw up his arms with\r\nan expression of despair, that went farther than any of his previous\r\nmanifestations, towards vindicating his claims to be reckoned human. For\r\nperchance the only time, since this so often empty and deceptive life of\r\nmortals began its course, an illusion had seen and fully recognized\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nMother Rigby was seated by her kitchen hearth, in the twilight of this\r\neventful day, and had just shaken the ashes out of a new pipe, when she\r\nheard a hurried tramp along the road. Yet it did not seem so much the\r\ntramp of human footsteps, as the clatter of sticks or the rattling of\r\ndry bones.\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" thought the old witch, \"what step is that? Whose skeleton is out\r\nof its grave now, I wonder!\"\r\n\r\nA figure burst headlong into the cottage-door. It was Feathertop! His\r\npipe was still alight; the star still flamed upon his breast; the\r\nembroidery still glowed upon his garments; nor had he lost, in any\r\ndegree or manner that could be estimated, the aspect that assimilated\r\nhim with our mortal brotherhood. But yet, in some indescribable way (as\r\nis the case with all that has deluded us, when once found out), the poor\r\nreality was felt beneath the cunning artifice.\r\n\r\n\"What has gone wrong?\" demanded the witch; \"did yonder sniffling\r\nhypocrite thrust my darling from his door? The villain! I'll set twenty\r\nfiends to torment him, till he offer thee his daughter on his bended\r\nknees!\"\r\n\r\n\"No, mother,\" said Feathertop, despondingly, \"it was not that!\"\r\n\r\n\"Did the girl scorn my precious one?\" asked Mother Rigby, her fierce\r\neyes glowing like two coals of Tophet; \"I'll cover her face with\r\npimples! Her nose shall be as red as the coal in thy pipe! Her front\r\nteeth shall drop out! In a week hence, she shall not be worth thy\r\nhaving!\"\r\n\r\n\"Let her alone, mother!\" answered poor Feathertop; \"the girl was half\r\nwon; and methinks a kiss from her sweet lips might have made me\r\naltogether human! But,\" he added, after a brief pause, and then a howl\r\nof self-contempt; \"I've seen myself, mother! I've seen myself for the\r\nwretched, ragged, empty thing I am! I'll exist no longer!\"\r\n\r\nSnatching the pipe from his mouth, he flung it with all his might\r\nagainst the chimney, and, at the same instant, sank upon the floor, a\r\nmedley of straw and tattered garments, with some sticks protruding from\r\nthe heap, and a shrivelled pumpkin in the midst. The eyeholes were now\r\nlustreless; but the rudely-carved gap, that just before had been a\r\nmouth, still seemed to twist itself into a despairing grin, and was so\r\nfar human.\r\n\r\n\"Poor fellow!\" quoth Mother Rigby, with a rueful glance at the relics of\r\nher ill-fated contrivance; \"my poor, dear, pretty Feathertop! There are\r\nthousands upon thousands of coxcombs and charlatans in the world, made\r\nup of just such a jumble of worn-out, forgotten, and good-for-nothing\r\ntrash, as he was! Yet they live in fair repute, and never see themselves\r\nfor what they are! And why should my poor puppet be the only one to know\r\nhimself, and perish for it?\"\r\n\r\nWhile thus muttering, the witch had filled a fresh pipe of tobacco, and\r\nheld the stem between her fingers, as doubtful whether to thrust it into\r\nher own mouth or Feathertop's.\r\n\r\n\"Poor Feathertop!\" she continued, \"I could easily give him another\r\nchance, and send him forth again to-morrow. But, no! his feelings are\r\ntoo tender; his sensibilities too deep. He seems to have too much heart\r\nto bustle for his own advantage, in such an empty and heartless world.\r\nWell, well! I'll make a scarecrow of him, after all. 'Tis an innocent\r\nand a useful vocation, and will suit my darling well; and if each of his\r\nhuman brethren had as fit a one, 'twould be the better for mankind; and\r\nas for this pipe of tobacco, I need it more than he!\"\r\n\r\nSo saying. Mother Rigby put the stem between her lips. \"Dickon!\" cried\r\nshe, in her high, sharp tone, \"another coal for my pipe!\"\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] Concluded from page 186.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Colburn's New Monthly Magazine\r\n\r\nA CHAPTER ON GAMBLING.\r\n\r\n\r\nVery little doubt can be entertained that gambling is rapidly falling\r\nfrom its pristine eminence in the fashionable world: we seldom or never\r\nhear of thousands being now lost at a sitting; and those of the present\r\ngeneration can scarcely credit all that is said or written of the doings\r\nof their forefathers, or that whole estates were set on the hazard of a\r\ngame of picquet, as a certain Irish writer voraciously informs us.\r\nRailway coupons have usurped the place of the cue and the dice-box, and\r\nthe greedy passion finds an outlet in Capel Court. We do not for a\r\nmoment mean to assert that gambling is dying away--the countless\r\nbetting-lists in town and country furnish a melancholy proof of the\r\nwidely-extended contagion--but still we do say that its very\r\nuniversality has brought it out of fashion, and that it is not regarded\r\nwith that indulgence it formerly claimed, but is rather looked upon as\r\nthe \"dernier resort\" of the hard-up man about town.\r\n\r\nSuch being the case, it may cause our readers some surprise, on\r\nreferring to the heading of this paper, to find it termed a chapter on\r\ngambling. Let them not expect any piquant details of English folly, or a\r\npeep behind the scenes of Club life. We have no wish to lay bare the\r\nsecrets of our own land; and, indeed, too much has already been written\r\non the subject; be it our task to give an account of the doings in\r\nforeign countries, and for this purpose we must ask them to accompany us\r\nacross the Channel.\r\n\r\nAfter the villanous dens in the Palais Royal were rooted out, the\r\nproprietors, who found the business much too profitable to be tamely\r\nresigned, turned their gaze beyond the Rhine, where a fair field for\r\ntheir exertions in the pursuit of a livelihood presented itself. After\r\nmany weary negotiations with the several governments, a company of\r\nbanquiers, with M. Chabert at their head, simultaneously opened their\r\nestablishments at Baden-Baden, Wisbaden, and Ems. It was a very hard\r\ncontest between the Regents and the Frenchmen before the terms were\r\nfinally settled, and they had to expend much money and many promises in\r\ngetting a footing. But they eventually succeeded, and a few years saw\r\ntheir efforts richly rewarded. As they had a monopoly, they could do\r\npretty much as they pleased, and made very stringent and profitable\r\nregulations relative to the \"aprés\" and other methods of gaining a pull.\r\nOn the retirement of M. Chabert with an immense fortune, the company\r\nwas dissolved, and M. Benazet became ostensibly sole proprietor of the\r\nrooms at Baden-Baden. The terms to which he had to subscribe were\r\nsufficient to frighten any one less enterprising than the general of an\r\narmy of croupiers: he was compelled to expend 150,000 florins in\r\ndecorating the rooms and embellishing the walks round the town; and an\r\nannual sum of 50,000 florins was furthermore demanded, for permission to\r\nkeep the establishment open for six months in the year. The company,\r\nwhich leased Wisbaden and Ems, was treated much in the same manner, but\r\nstill they progressed most successfully, till they were frightened from\r\ntheir propriety by Monsieur le Blanc. This gentleman, after struggling\r\nagainst immense opposition on the part of the Frankfort merchants, who\r\nwere naturally alarmed at the danger to which their \"commis\" and\r\ncash-boxes were exposed by the proximity of a gambling-table, obtained a\r\nconcession from the Elector of Hessen to establish a bank at\r\nHomburg-an-der-Höhe, which he speedily promulgated to the world, with\r\nthe additional attraction of being open all the year round, and only a\r\n\"trente et un aprés\" for the players to contend against. Some time\r\nafter, Wilhelmsbad was opened as a rival to Homburg, with no \"aprés\" at\r\nall, and the above mentioned, with the addition of Aix-la-Chapelle and\r\nCöthen, form the principal establishments where \"strangers are taken in\r\nand done for\" through Germany.\r\n\r\nThe games universally played are \"rouge et noir\" and \"roulette,\" the\r\nformer also denominated \"trente et quarante,\" though both titles\r\ninsufficiently explain the tendency of the game, especially as \"noir\"\r\nnever has any part or parcel in the affair, all being regulated by\r\n\"rouge\" winning or losing. The appointments are simple in the extreme: a\r\nlong table, covered with green cloth, divided into alternate squares\r\nmarked with red and black \"carreaux,\" and two divisions for betting on\r\nor against the \"couleur,\" three packs of cards, half a dozen croupiers\r\narmed with rakes, and a quantity of rouleaus and smaller coin\r\nconstituting the whole _matériel_. A croupier commences the pleasing\r\ngame by dealing a quantity of cards till he arrives at any number above\r\nthirty (court-cards counting as ten), when he begins a second row, the\r\nfirst representing \"noir,\" the other \"rouge.\" The \"couleur\" is\r\ndetermined by the first card turned up. The two great pulls in favor of\r\nthe bank are, first, the \"aprés\"--that is, when the two rows amount to\r\nthe same number, and the croupier calls out, \"Et trente trois,\" or any\r\nother number \"aprés,\"--the stakes are impounded, and can only be\r\nreleased by paying half the money down, or else by the same color\r\nwinning; and secondly--the chief thing--_the bank never loses its\r\ntemper_. As a martingale, or continual doubling of the stakes after\r\nlosing, would infallibly cause a player to win in the end, there is a\r\nlaw in force that no stake can exceed three hundred louis-d'or without\r\nthe permission of the banque: a permission it very rarely grants, except\r\nin extreme cases, as for instance, at Homburg, when the Belgians so\r\nnearly broke the bank; but then it was \"conquer or die.\" The lowest\r\namount allowed to be staked is a two florin piece. The expression, \"V'la\r\nbanque!\" which we so frequently hear quoted, has its origin from this\r\ngame. After a player has passed, that is, won, on the same color two or\r\nthree times consecutively, the croupier, to prevent any possible\r\ndispute, asks whether he wishes to risk the whole of the money down; if\r\nhe intends to do so he employs the above cabalistic formula.\r\n\r\nRoulette is a very much more complicated affair; for this, a table is\r\nrequired with a basin in the centre, containing a spiral tube with an\r\norifice at the top, through which the ball passes, and falls into one of\r\nthe thirty-eight holes in the basin, which are respectively marked with\r\nfigures, and alternately painted red and black. There are four\r\nprojecting pieces of iron, one of which the croupier twirls, crying,\r\n\"Faites votre jeu, messieurs;\" when he says, \"Le jeu est fait, rien n'va\r\nplus,\" no more money can be put down. In the middle of the table are the\r\nnumbers, from one to thirty-six, going regularly downwards, in three\r\nrows, while at the head of them are the two \"zeros\"--rouge single and\r\nnoir double. On either side of the numbers are three divisions; on one\r\nhand, marked \"rouge, impair et passe,\" on the other, \"noir, pair et\r\nmanque.\" Besides these, there are three compartments at the end of the\r\ncolumns, for the purpose of backing the numbers contained in the column;\r\nand three others on each side of the numbers, in which to bet on the\r\nfirst, second, or third series of twelve. The odds are regulated in the\r\nfollowing fashion. If a player back a single number, he receives\r\nthirty-five times the amount of his stake, in the event of its coming\r\nup; if he back three at once, he only gets eleven times; if six, only\r\nfive times the amount. For either of the other compartments he receives,\r\nif he gain, the simple amount of his stake, with the exception of the\r\ndivisions at the end of the columns, and the series of twelve, when he\r\nreceives double if he win, as the odds are two to one against him. The\r\nbanque has a most iniquitous advantage in the two zeros, which are\r\ncalculated to recur once in nineteen times; if the single rouge turn up,\r\nthey sack all the money, except that placed on the red; if double zero,\r\nthey take all.\r\n\r\nThe amount of the stakes at roulette is limited to two hundred louis\r\nd'or on a color, and six on a single number; the lowest stake allowed is\r\na florin. Though it may be supposed that a run at \"trente et quarante\"\r\nwould be a much more likely occurrence than at roulette--and, indeed, we\r\ncan remember at the former game the \"noir\" passing two-and-twenty times,\r\nthough no one had the courage to take advantage of such an\r\nextraordinary circumstance--yet it is a very frequent thing at roulette\r\nfor the ball to have a predilection for a certain series of\r\nnumbers--probably through the croupier twisting the machine with the\r\nsame force each time--and on such occasions a good deal of money may be\r\nwon by a careful observer. One young Englishman, who was perfectly\r\nignorant of the game, we saw at Wisbaden place a five-franc piece on the\r\nlast series of twelve, and he left his money down six times, winning\r\ndouble the amount of his stake every turn. He then discovered the money\r\nwas his, by the croupier asking him if he wished to stand on the whole\r\nsum; but he never gave the banque another chance, for he picked it up,\r\nand quickly went off with it.\r\n\r\nEvery player at roulette seems to have a different system: some powder\r\nthe numbers with florins or five-franc pieces, in the hope of one coming\r\nup out of them; others speculate merely on the rouge or noir. One\r\nSpaniard at Ems, we remember, made a very comfortable living at it by a\r\nmethod of playing he had invented. He placed three louis-d'or on the\r\nmanque, which contains all the numbers to eighteen, and two louis on the\r\nlast series of twelve; that is, from twenty-four to thirty-six. Thus he\r\nhad only six numbers and two zeros against him. If manque gained, he won\r\nthree louis and lost two; if a number in the last twelve came up, he won\r\nfour and lost three; but a continuation of zeros would have ruined his\r\ncalculation. Some, again, back the run, others play against it; a very\r\nfavorite scheme, and one generally successful, being to bet against a\r\ncolor after it has passed three times; but then, again, there is no law\r\non the subject, and a man may lose heavily in spite of the utmost\r\ncaution. In short, the best plan by far would be, if play one must, to\r\nstick to \"rouge et noir,\" which bears some semblance of fairness.\r\n\r\nThe _habitués_ of the rooms are well known to the croupiers. At\r\nBaden-Baden we had for many years the old ex-Elector of Hesse, who made\r\nhis money by selling his soldiers to England at so much a head, like\r\ncattle, during the American war, and who was easily to be recognized by\r\nthe gold-headed and coroneted rake he always had in his hand. He was,\r\nindeed, a most profitable customer to Monsieur Benazet. But, alas! the\r\nsuperior attractions of Homburg led him away, and we never saw him again\r\nin Baden; the revolution of 1848 frightened, or angered, him to death.\r\nWisbaden boasts of a banker from Amsterdam, who usually plays on\r\ncredit--that is to say, he pockets his winnings, but, if he loses,\r\nborrows money of the banquier, squaring his account, which is generally\r\na heavy one, at the end of the week: and an English baronet, who always\r\nbrings a lozenge box with him, which, when he has filled, he retires\r\nwith; and this he frequently contrives to accomplish, for he possesses\r\nhis own luck and that of some one else in the bargain. Ems is the\r\nprincipal resort of Russians, who play fearfully high, and a good deal\r\nof private gambling is done there on the quiet; while Aix-la-Chapelle\r\nappears only destined as a trap for incautious travellers, many of whom,\r\nin consequence, never see the Rhine, and return to England with very\r\nmisty ideas about Germany.\r\n\r\nAix-la-Chapelle will never be erased from our memory, on account of a\r\nmost ludicrous scene which happened on our first visit to Germany. Being\r\nunacquainted with German at the time, and our French being of the sort\r\nwhich Chaucer calls \"French of Bow,\" we had selected one of our party,\r\nwho boasted of his knowledge of most foreign tongues, and installed\r\nhimself as \"Dolmetscher.\" His first experiment was in ordering supper,\r\nwhich he proceeded to do in something he was pleased to call German.\r\n\r\n\"Plait-il, M'nsieu?\" said the waiter.\r\n\r\nThe order was repeated.\r\n\r\n\"Would you have the kindness to spik Angleesh?\" remarked the garçon.\r\n\r\nThough this raised some doubts in our minds as to our friend's capacity,\r\nyet one of our party, feeling indisposed, invoked his intercession for\r\nthe sake of procuring some Seidlitz powders. However, in his\r\nindignation, he refused to have any thing to do with it. In this\r\ndilemma, the sick man called in the English-conversing waiter to his\r\naid, who readily offered to help him, and soon returned with a bottle of\r\nSeidlitz _water_, which he persuaded our unwary friend to make trial of.\r\nNow this water happens to be the strongest of all the mineral springs in\r\nGermany, and the consequence was, the poor young man became very shortly\r\nalarmingly unwell. In his anxiety, he fancied himself poisoned, and\r\nsummoned the waiter once more. On his reappearance, he compelled him to\r\nfinish the whole of the bottle, which contained nearly a quart, to prove\r\nit was not of a dangerous nature; but, in point of fact, it proved to be\r\nso, by nearly killing the wretched garçon.\r\n\r\nThe company to be seen round the table consists usually of Russians and\r\nFrench, both male and female, with a sprinkling of Germans, who escape\r\nfrom their own police in order to satisfy their itching for play. Thus,\r\nfor instance, we have Nassau and Darmstadt people at Baden-Baden, while\r\nthe Badese and Suabese rush to Homburg and Wisbaden. There is a very\r\nsalutary law in every land where gambling is permitted, that no\r\ninhabitant of that land be allowed to play at the public table, and if\r\nany one is caught red-handed, he is usually imprisoned, and his\r\nwinnings, if any, confiscated. We can call to mind a laughable instance\r\nof this at Wisbaden. Two old peasants, who had probably come for a day's\r\npleasure and to see the sights, managed to find their way into the\r\nKursaal, and stood all entranced before the roulette-table. One of them,\r\nimagining it a right royal way of making money, and much better fun\r\nthan ploughing, lugged out his leathern purse, and began by staking a\r\nmodest florin on the rouge. In the course of about half an hour he had\r\ncontrived to win a very decent sum, and was walking away in great glee,\r\nwhen a gendarme, who had been watching him all the while, quietly\r\ncollared him and dragged him off to the Polizei, where, as we afterwards\r\nlearned, he was incarcerated for three weeks, and his \"addlings\"\r\nemployed for the good of the state.\r\n\r\nIt may naturally be supposed that the presence of so much circulating\r\nmedium in one place, and the _prestige_ attaching to the banquier's\r\ncoffers, which are currently supposed to contain a sum\r\n\r\n                           More precious far\r\n    Than that accumulated store of wealth\r\n    And orient gems, which, for a day of need,\r\n    The sultan hides in his ancestral tombs,\r\n\r\nwould induce many depredators to make an attempt on them, but we\r\ngenerally find that cunning is much more in favor than any open attack.\r\nThus, for instance, Monsieur le Blanc, who, we may add, has been more\r\nassailed than any other banquier, was nearly made the victim of a\r\nstratagem, which might have entailed serious results. A fellow contrived\r\nto get into the \"Conversation Haus\" by night, and blocked up all the low\r\nnumbers in the roulette machine in such a manner that the ball, on\r\nfalling in, must inevitably leap out again. On the next day he and his\r\naccomplices played, and netted a large sum by backing the high numbers.\r\nThey carried on the game for two or three days, but were fortunately\r\noverheard by a detective while quarrelling about the division of their\r\nplunder, in the gardens behind the establishment. They were arrested,\r\nand the money recovered. A very dangerous design was also formed against\r\nhim by one of his croupiers, who, being discontented with his lot,\r\ndetermined to make his fortune at one _coup_: and the plan he contrived\r\nwas this. He procured a pack of pre-arranged cards, which he concealed\r\nin his hat, and when it came to his turn to deal, he intended to drop\r\nthe bank cards into his _chapeau_ and cleverly substitute the others;\r\nbut this artfully-concocted scheme was disconcerted, by one of his\r\nconfederates considering he might make a better and safer thing of it by\r\ntelling Le Blanc beforehand. His most imminent peril, and the occasion\r\nwhen his very existence as a banquier was at stake, was the affair with\r\nthe Belgian company, of which Thackeray has given us a detailed account\r\nin his \"Kickleburys up the Rhine.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"propriétaires,\" besides, suffer considerable losses by the\r\ndishonesty of the croupiers; for, although there is a person expressly\r\nemployed to watch them, who sits in a high-backed chair behind the\r\ndealer, yet they are such practised escamoteurs, that they will secrete\r\na piece of gold without his seeing it. One fellow was detected at\r\nBaden-Baden, who had carried on a system of plunder for a long time with\r\nsecurity. He used to slip a louis-d'or into his snuff-box whenever it\r\ncame to his turn to preside over the money department; he was found out\r\nby another _employé_ asking him casually for a pinch of snuff, and\r\nseeing the money gleam in the gaslight. These croupiers are the most\r\nextraordinary race of men it is possible to conceive. They seem to unite\r\nthe stoicism of the American Indian to the politeness of the Frenchman\r\nof the _ancien régime_. They are never seen to smile, and wear the same\r\nimpassive countenance whether the banque is gaining or losing. In fact,\r\nwhat do they care as long as their salary is regularly paid? They seem\r\nto fear neither God nor man: for when a shock of the earthquake was felt\r\nat Wisbaden, in 1847, though all the company fled in terror, they\r\nremained grimly at their posts, preferring to go down to their patron\r\nsaints with their rouleaux, as an evidence of their fidelity to their\r\nemployer. Perhaps, though, they regarded the earthquake as a\r\npreconcerted scheme to rob the banque, the only danger they are\r\napprehensive of. You may beat them, and yet they smite not again; for\r\nwhen a young Englishman, bearing an honorable name, vented his rage at\r\nlosing by breaking a rake at Baden-Baden over the croupier's head, he\r\nmerely turned round and beckoned to the attendant gendarme to remove him\r\nand the pieces, and then went on with his parrot-like \"rouge\r\ngagne--couleur perd.\"\r\n\r\nThe most amusing thing to any philosophical frequenter of the rooms, is\r\nto see the sudden gyrations of fortune's wheel. One gentleman at\r\nBaden-Baden, a Russian, was so elated after an unparalleled run of good\r\nfortune, that he went out and ordered a glorious feed for himself and\r\nfriends at the restauration; but during the interval, while dinner was\r\npreparing, he thought he would go back and win a little more. His good\r\nfortune, however, had deserted him, and he lost not only all his\r\nwinnings, but every florin he was possessed of, so he was compelled to\r\ncountermand the dinner. On the arrival of his remittances, determined\r\nnot to be balked of his repast this time by want of funds, he paid for a\r\nspread for twelve beforehand; but his luck was very bad, and he actually\r\nwent back to the restaurateur, and, after some negotiation, sold him\r\nback the dinner at half-price. The money he received was, of course,\r\nvery speedily lost. Another, a student of Heidelberg, won at a sitting\r\n970 florins, but disdaining to retire without a round thousand, he\r\ntempted fortune too long, and lost it all back, as well as his own\r\nmoney. The most absurd thing was, that not having any friends in Baden,\r\nhe was driven to return \"per pedes\" to his university, a distance of\r\nmore than one hundred miles. It is a very rare occurrence for the bank\r\nto be broken, though the newspapers state that such a thing happened\r\nthree times at Baden-Baden during the present season,--a statement which\r\nwe are inclined to place in the same category with the wonderful\r\nshowers of frogs and gigantic cabbages which happen so opportunely to\r\nfill any vacant corner. When, however, it really takes place, the rooms\r\nare only closed for an hour or two, and the play soon commences again.\r\n\r\nThe most painful incident is, the frequency of suicides during the\r\nseason, any account of which Monsieur Benazet, for obvious reasons,\r\nprevents reaching the public. When any thing of the sort occurs, the\r\nplace most commonly selected for the tragedy is a summer-house a little\r\nway out of the town, on the road to the Alt Schloss, whence the poor\r\nvictim can take a last lingering look on the scene of his ruin. One\r\nyoung man, in our time, attempted to blow out his brains at the\r\nroulette-table, but was fortunately prevented, and a fortnight's\r\ndetention in the House of Correction very much cooled his ardor for\r\nmaking a \"dem'd disgusting body\" of himself. Indeed, it has ever been a\r\npassion with your Frenchmen to cause a scene when dying: they would not\r\ngive a \"thank you\" to cut their throats in private.\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of October, the day on which the rooms close for the season,\r\nan immense quantity of players throng to the Kursaal; for though they\r\nhave withstood temptation for so long a time, they cannot possibly\r\nsuffer the season to go past without making one trial. On the 1st of\r\nNovember, those birds of ill-omen, the croupiers, set out to hybernize\r\nin Paris, and the rooms are closed, not to be reopened till the 1st of\r\nMay.\r\n\r\nIt has long been a question most difficult of decision whether, leaving\r\nmorality entirely out of sight, the watering-places of Germany are\r\nbenefited or injured by the continuance of gambling. We are inclined to\r\nthe latter opinion; for, though it may be said that it brings a deal of\r\nmoney into circulation, yet your true gambler is a most unsocial and\r\ninhospitable fellow, and one of the worst visitors an hotel-keeper can\r\nhave. Besides encouraging, as they do, all the riffraff of Europe to pay\r\nperiodical visits to Germany, they thereby prevent many respectable\r\npersons from settling in that country; for any wife or mother who has\r\nthe interests of her family at heart, would fly from a place where\r\ngambling is allowed, as from a pest-house. At the same time, a very lax\r\ntone prevails in these towns, and every finer feeling is blunted--in\r\nmany cases irreparably--by constant association with hard-hearted,\r\ncallous, and unscrupulous gamblers. That this was a view taken by the\r\nmore enlightened of the Germans, is proved by the fact that the\r\nparliament of Frankfort decided on the abolition of all gambling-houses\r\nby a considerable majority, but unfortunately there was no time to carry\r\nsuch a salutary measure into effect. Had it been otherwise, the Regents\r\nin all probability would, through very shame, have hesitated in giving\r\ntheir assent to the re-establishment of such a crying evil.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Fraser's Magazine.\r\n\r\nAN ELECTION ROW IN NEW-YORK.\r\n\r\nBY C. ASTOR BRISTED.\r\n\r\n\r\nAn election in England is a very exciting affair; in America, from its\r\nfrequency, it becomes a mere matter of every-day business. Almost every\r\ncitizen has the opportunity of voting twice a year, and elections are\r\ncontinually going on in some part or other of the country, so that they\r\nform a standard topic of conversation, much as the weather does in\r\nEngland. No wonder, then, that they usually fail to awaken any great or\r\ngeneral interest.\r\n\r\nBut to this rule there are important exceptions. A presidential[3] or a\r\ncongressional campaign sometimes involves the fate of most important\r\nmeasures of policy, and creates a corresponding excitement. At such\r\nperiods, the country is flooded with \"extra\" newspapers and political\r\nlecturers, the walls groan with placards, bar-room politicians talk\r\nthemselves hoarse, and steamboat passengers amuse themselves with\r\nholding meetings and sham-balloting for the respective candidates. Still\r\nthe enthusiasm of the parties generally spends itself in words; they\r\nseldom come into actual personal collision. Even in the West, there are\r\nnot _more_ rows on election days than at other times. But here again we\r\nhave a notorious exception in the case of New-York. Many thousands of\r\nthe \"finest pisantry\" have located themselves in that city, and they\r\nhave not lost an iota of their belligerent propensities, affording a\r\nbeautiful illustration of _coelum non animum_, &c. Entirely under the\r\ninfluence of their priests, they are almost invariably to be found on\r\nthe agrarian side, and are ready at any time to attack a whig\r\n(conservative) meeting, storm the polls, or engage in any other act of\r\nviolence to which their wily leaders may prompt them.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1840, the Whigs of the State of New York (the _city_\r\nstill inclined the other way) had been in power nearly two years, with a\r\ndecided majority in both houses of the legislature, and a governor who\r\n\"went the entire animal\" with them. Washington Irving says that the best\r\nmen of a party propose to themselves three ends: first, to get their\r\nopponents out; secondly, to get themselves in; thirdly, to do some good\r\nto the country; but the majority are satisfied with attaining the first\r\ntwo objects. Now the Whigs had accomplished these as thoroughly as they\r\ncould have desired, and had made such use of their victory as to put it\r\nout of the power of any one to charge them with being worse than\r\ninfidels. They, therefore, like good patriots, set about the third\r\nproposed point, and their first step was to take some measures for\r\nimproving the election laws, so far as concerned the city of New-York.\r\nThat city had more than 300,000 inhabitants,[4] at least 26,000 voters,\r\nand no registry law whatever. The consequence may be easily imagined. If\r\na man chose to take the responsibility of perjuring himself, he could\r\nalways pass a false vote, and was frequently able to do it without that\r\nunpleasant necessity. To prove _residence_, it was only requisite to\r\nhave slept the previous night in the ward where he voted; this gave rise\r\nto an extensive system of colonization just before the election. In\r\nshort, it was evident that the ballot _alone_ would not secure a fair\r\nvote, while the experience of Philadelphia showed that _with a good\r\nsystem of registry_ it answered every required purpose. A registry law\r\nwas accordingly reported and read the first time.\r\n\r\nGreat was the wrath of the Loco-Focos[5] when they found this measure on\r\nthe _tapis_. The strength of the two parties in the city was very nearly\r\nbalanced, the mercantile influence of the Whigs, and the papist\r\ninfluence of the Locos, being about a match for each other. Indeed, the\r\nsame side seldom carried its candidates for mayor and aldermen more than\r\ntwo years successively. But the Locos had good reason to fear that a\r\nstrict registry law would knock on the head nearly a thousand of their\r\nvoters, without making corresponding havoc in the Whig ranks. They were\r\ntherefore naturally anxious to prevent, if possible, the passage of this\r\nlaw; every effort was put forth to make it appear unpopular, by calling\r\nmeetings, and getting up petitions against it.\r\n\r\nMost of the Whigs cared nothing for this; but some men, whose good\r\nfeeling outran their discretion, and who had the fatuity to suppose that\r\nLoco-Focos were capable of being influenced by reason, called a meeting\r\n(it was about a week previous to the charter election) \"of citizens,\r\nwithout distinction of party,\" to express their approval of the registry\r\nlaw. Such calls, emanating professedly from neutrals, but really from\r\npartisans, are not uncommon; and the result of them usually is, that the\r\nspeakers meet with no opposition, and the resolutions are carried\r\nunanimously; none of the other party, except perhaps, a reporter or two,\r\nattending. But on the present occasion, the opponents of the measure\r\nwere determined that its friends should _not_ have it all their own way;\r\nso some thirty or forty of the Locos attended, and did their best to\r\nimpede the proceedings. First, they objected to the gentleman proposed\r\nfor chairman; then they interrupted the speakers; and, finally, kicked\r\nup such a row as effectually to drown the voice of the secretary, who\r\nwas trying to read the first resolution offered.\r\n\r\nNow of all the offences against good manners that can be committed in\r\nAmerica, disturbing the harmony of a public meeting is about the most\r\nflagrant. It may be supposed, then, that the conduct of these intruders\r\nexcited no small indignation on the part of the majority. There were not\r\nenough constables present to eject them, so the \"citizens, without\r\ndistinction of party,\" took the law into their own hands; such Whigs as\r\nwere nearest incontinently laid hands on the rioters, and \"passed them\r\nout.\"\r\n\r\nReader, have you a clear idea of what this \"passing out\" is? I believe\r\nthe operation is occasionally practised in England, at theatres and\r\nother places of public resort, when young gentlemen have got elevated,\r\nand won't behave themselves. But, lest you should not be familiar with\r\nit, I will endeavor to give you as much as I remember of a description\r\nby one of our authors,[6] of the style in which the thing is managed.\r\nThe occasion represented is a public dinner, given to the Honorable Mr.\r\nSo-and-So, by his admirers; and the victim, a too daring-dun, who has\r\nspoiled a fine period of the orator's--\"If, fellow-citizens, I should be\r\ndoomed to retirement, I shall at least carry with me the proud\r\nconviction that I have always acted as becomes an honest man,\"--by\r\nimpertinently suggesting that \"his small account for groceries has been\r\nrunning four years.\"\r\n\r\n\"This was too much for the admirers of the honorable gentleman. 'Turn\r\nhim out!' 'Throw him over!' 'Hustle him out!'\r\n\r\n\"Pass him down!!\r\n\r\n\"Now when it is remembered that the unhappy man had established himself\r\nat the very upper end of the room, in which five hundred of his\r\nfellow-creatures were packed like damaged goods, it will be easily\r\nimagined what a pleasant prospect he had before him.\r\n\r\n\"An assemblage of human beings has often been compared to a sea.\r\nDreadful, indeed, poor Muzzy, was the ocean on which thou wert doomed to\r\nembark.\r\n\r\n\"PASS HIM DOWN!\r\n\r\n\"The call was answered by the elevation of Mr. Muzzy six feet in the\r\nair. From this altitude he was let down into a vortex of strong-handed\r\nfellows, who whirled him about horribly, and then transmitted him to a\r\nmore equable current, which pitched him forward at a steady rate towards\r\nthe door. Sometimes he landed among a party of quiet elderly gentlemen\r\nover their wine, and the torrent seemed to be lulled; then again it\r\nwould return upon him with renewed violence, and bear him helplessly\r\nalong. At last he was caught up by two mighty billows in the shape of a\r\nmaster butcher and baker, and impelled with fearful velocity through the\r\nnarrow straits of the door. On recovering his senses sufficiently to\r\ntake an observation, he found himself stranded keel uppermost, in the\r\ngutter, with his rigging considerably damaged, and his timbers somewhat\r\nshaken.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the discipline to which the obstreperous Locos were subjected,\r\nand neither their general disposition, nor their particular temper of\r\nmind at the time, was such as to induce them to bear the infliction with\r\nChristian resignation. Accordingly, they repaired in a body to the\r\nhead-quarters of their party (at Tammany Hall, about half a mile\r\ndistant), and there reported the indignity they had suffered. The thing\r\nwas not to be endured, and steps were instantly taken to exact a\r\nterrible retribution. The more belligerent of the Locos had formed\r\nthemselves into various associations for purposes of offence, rejoicing\r\nin the classic names of \"Spartans,\" \"Ring-tailed Roarers,\" \"Huge Paws,\"\r\nand \"Butt-enders.\" Some two hundred of this last body chanced to be in\r\nattendance, all armed with bludgeons, and they instantly started off to\r\nmake an assault upon the Masonic Hall, where the friends of the registry\r\nlaw were assembled. The surprise bid fair to be a complete one, and so\r\ndoubtless it would have been, but for a circumstance, to explain which\r\nit will be necessary for us to go back to the morning of this eventful\r\nday.\r\n\r\nBill Travis, as his friends familiarly called him--or W. Thompson\r\nTravis, Esq., as his tradesmen used to address him on the back of their\r\nfrequently-sent-in and occasionally-paid bills--was a senior at Columbia\r\nCollege; not precisely the first of his class in Latin and Greek, but\r\ndecidedly the best waltzer and billiard-player in it, and _the_\r\nexquisite, _par excellence_, of his juvenile contemporaries. He never\r\nwent down Broadway, even to go to College, without light French kids and\r\na gold-headed cane; and his stock of enamelled chains, opal studs,\r\ndiamond pins, and the like vanities, would nearly have fitted up a\r\nbride's _corbeille_. To see him fully got up--polished boots, palm-leaf\r\nwaistcoat, gorgeous cravat, and all--mincing over the gutter, you would\r\ntake him for a regular man-milliner, and say that the greatest exertion\r\nhe was capable of, would be holding a trotter, and that only with the\r\naid of a pair of pulleys. But scrutinize him more closely, and you would\r\nsee that, for all his slim waist and delicate extremities, he had a good\r\nfull natural chest of his own, and powerful limbs. Put him into action,\r\nand you would find that he could hit straight from the shoulder, and\r\n\"split himself well,\" as the French phrase it, when he gave point, or\r\nwent back in guard. He was, in fact, a crack boxer, fencer, and gymnast.\r\nPugilism was the fashion with the young bloods of Gotham at that time,\r\nespecially such of them as had any tendency to politics: and among these\r\nboys of nineteen, there were not a few who would have tackled a fancy\r\nman in his prime, and at no great odds either, their great agility\r\nmaking up for their want of downright strength. Travis's friend and\r\nsenior by one year, George Purcell (who afterwards served with credit as\r\na volunteer in the Mexican war, and ultimately became a judge in\r\nCalifornia), had on one occasion, when threatened with the vengeance of\r\na stalwart Bowery boy, sought out the democratic champion in the very\r\nmidst of his personal and political friends, and challenged him to\r\nsingle combat; which challenge being promptly accepted, he polished off\r\nthe young butcher in good style and short order--the other b'hoys, with\r\nthat love of fair play which honorably distinguishes the Anglo-Saxon\r\nrace all over the world, remaining impartial spectators of the fight.\r\nTravis had never equalled this feat, but he _had_ seen a good deal of\r\nlow life and hard knocks on the sly, proper and fashionable as he always\r\nappeared in public by daylight.\r\n\r\nNow, on the morning of this very day, as we were saying, Travis, while\r\nlounging up Broadway, suddenly encountered a youth of about his own age,\r\nbut a very different style and type. He was short and thickset,\r\nswaggering, and almost sailor-like in his gait, and wore the usual dress\r\nof the American snob playing gentleman--that is to say, a black\r\ndress-coat and trousers, and a black satin vest. His ungloved right hand\r\nsustained a walking-stick, which might, on a pinch, have done duty as a\r\nbed-post; his left was buried in his trousers' pocket.\r\n\r\nIt was Travis's cousin, Lefferts Lloyd. Half Knickerbocker, half Welsh\r\nin his extraction, he descended directly from some of the oldest\r\nsettlers of the island, and by rights, his should have been the\r\nfashionable, and the Travises (who were altogether _novi homines_) the\r\nunfashionable branch of the family. But fortune, or the taste of the\r\nLloyds themselves, had willed it otherwise; with equal means, they\r\nresided in a region east of the Bowery, well nigh _terra incognita_ to\r\nthe set in which the Travises moved. Lefferts himself was very much one\r\nof the people; he eschewed all vanities of patent leather and kid\r\ngloves, preferred ten-pins to billiards, and running after a fire-engine\r\nto waltzing. The cousins, who had been at school together, were on very\r\namicable terms with each other, but their tastes and pursuits not\r\nexactly coinciding, they seldom met except for a few minutes in the\r\nstreet, or a few days at a watering-place.\r\n\r\n\"By Jove! Lefferts, that's a delicate cane of yours,\" said Travis,\r\nglancing from the other's stupendous bludgeon to his own gold-headed\r\nMalacca, which, as he would have expressed it himself, had knocked a big\r\nhole in a fifty dollar bill. \"Preparing for the meeting to-night, you\r\nsee,\" answered Lloyd, with a significant waggle of the big stick, that\r\nwould have gladdened an Irishman's heart. Nothing more was said on the\r\nsubject, and they separated, after a few trivial remarks; but Travis\r\ntook good heed of the allusion, which he seemed not to notice at the\r\ntime. On the look-out for mischief, he set himself to reconnoitre that\r\nevening in the vicinity of Tammany Hall, fearless of detection, for no\r\none could have recognized the Broadway exquisite in his assumed garb.\r\nHis upper garment was an old great coat razeed into a frock; his feet\r\nwere cased in heavy fireman's boots, which, with their impermeable\r\nuppers and ponderous soles, were equally serviceable for keeping out\r\nsnow-water and kicking niggers' shins; his head was protected by a stout\r\nleather cap, and in his hand he carried a hickory, not so ponderous as\r\nLloyd's stick, but none the less capable of doing worthy execution in a\r\nrow. Seeing the Butt-enders proceed up Broadway in a body, he at once\r\nsuspected that the Masonic Hall was the object of their attack, and\r\naccordingly put on all his disposable quantity of steam, that their\r\ncoming might not be unannounced. There was no time for ceremonious\r\nentry, or oratorical delivery, but bursting impetuously into the room,\r\nhe informed his friends in straightforward terms that the enemy were at\r\nhand in great force. The Whigs were somewhat taken aback, most of them\r\nbeing unarmed; but it was not an occasion to stand upon trifles. _Furor\r\narma ministrat_; the meeting was broken up into a committee of the\r\nwhole, and the benches into their component timbers, the fragments of\r\nwhich were distributed among the company, while a long plank, under the\r\nparticular supervision of Travis himself, was suspended over the\r\nbanisters, so as to sweep the staircase.\r\n\r\nHardly were these preparations completed, when the hall below was\r\nflooded with the advancing Loco-Focos. Stealthily but swiftly they\r\nadvanced, little dreaming of the reception that awaited them. The\r\nstaircase was certainly a very defensible position; it was not wide, and\r\nmade a sharp bend near the top, so that the assailants could not see the\r\ndanger that threatened them. The foremost pressed eagerly up-stairs, and\r\njust as they arrived at this turn, their leader could no longer contain\r\nhimself. \"Now, boys,\" he exclaimed, with a flourish of his bludgeon,\r\n\"we'll give the Whigs their gruel!\"\r\n\r\n\"_No you don't!_\"\r\n\r\nAnd as Travis spoke, slam-bang came the big plank above mentioned, which\r\nshot out with startling suddenness, and worked with commendable\r\ndexterity, made a clean sweep of the whole first column. The leader and\r\nfive or six more were hurled bodily into the air, and tumbled upon the\r\nheads of their followers, while fifteen or twenty others were pitched\r\ndown the upper flight of ten steps. The mass on the main staircase below\r\nrecoiled with the shock, and as those in the hall still pressed onward,\r\na dense body was wedged together in woful confusion. \"Tippecanoe and\r\nTyler too!\" shouted Travis, and the Whigs poured forth from the room,\r\nand mustered thickly at the head of the staircase, exulting in the\r\ndisaster of their opponents, while the end of the plank, which had been\r\nreset for action, peered over the banisters, as if saying, \"Come on, if\r\nyou dare!\"\r\n\r\nThe foremost enemies were evidently unwilling to encounter this\r\nformidable engine of defence, but the pressure from behind drove them\r\nforward. Their first leader was _hors du combat_, and they were now\r\nheaded by a young man of tolerably respectable appearance, clearly not\r\none of the regular Butt-enders. \"Let go!\" cried Travis, and the\r\nprimitive ram was again shot forward, but not with equal success.\r\nSeveral of the Locos were knocked down, but others threw themselves\r\ndesperately on the plank, and their general, by a dexterous movement,\r\nplaced himself within it. Travis recognized his cousin Lloyd! It was a\r\nfine bit of romance, but there was no time to fabricate reflections\r\ncorresponding, for even as he made the discovery, the amateur Spartan\r\nwas springing up the stairs, and the man who had been most active in\r\nmanaging the plank went down before his hickory. The fallen Whig upset\r\nthe board with him, and it lay upon the stairs, useless as a weapon, but\r\nstill impeding the enemy's advance. At the same moment, a stalwart\r\nIrishman, who had climbed up the banisters, levelled his shillelah at\r\nTravis's head; but our friend anticipated the blow by giving Pat point\r\nin the breast with such strength and dexterity, that he tumbled\r\nhelplessly into the mass beneath, causing much inconvenience and more\r\npanic. This done, Travis darted at his relative, who was knocking down\r\nthe Whigs right and left, and had nearly gained a footing on the\r\nlanding-place. Both were adepts in single-stick practice, and the\r\ncontest bid fair to be of long duration; but they were not to have it\r\nall to themselves, for as other Loco-Focos gained the top of the stairs,\r\nthe _mêlée_ became general. It would require the pen of an Irving or a\r\nFielding to do full justice to the scene. Black eyes, bloody noses, and\r\nbroken heads were lavishly distributed in all directions; Irish yells\r\nand Tippecanoe war-cries swelled the uproar; while from the front\r\nwindows of the room within some elderly gentlemen kept insanely crying\r\n\"Watch!\"\r\n\r\nThe Whigs had greatly the advantage over their opponents in point of\r\nposition and numbers, but the assailants were more practised\r\nbelligerents, and provided with better weapons. Moreover, many friends\r\nof the registry law had as yet taken no part in the affray, vainly\r\nhoping that the city authorities (at that time Loco-Focos) would\r\ninterfere. Inch by inch the Butt-enders fought their way forward. The\r\nWhigs were visibly giving ground. A panic seized their ranks, and those\r\nwho were still in the room began to look about them for means of\r\nescape. There was a small back-window, with a shed five or six feet\r\nbelow it, whence the ground could be reached by a ladder. Out of this\r\nwindow dropped, and down this ladder rattled the president,\r\nvice-presidents, secretaries, and, in short, the most quiet and\r\nrespectable men of the meeting. Their exit was as undignified as their\r\nentry had been pompous. At length the shed, being rather ancient, gave\r\nway under the weight of a very fat man, who was snugly deposited in a\r\npigsty beneath, so that hope was cut off.\r\n\r\nThe Whigs now became desperate: they saw that they must fight in\r\nearnest, and advanced to a man. The Butt-enders were stopped in their\r\nadvance. Both parties wavered. Travis perceived that the decisive blow\r\nwas now to be struck. Closing up to Lloyd, he came down on him \"with an\r\nawk stroke,\" as the old romancers say, that fairly broke down his guard,\r\nand beat him back upon three or four of his followers, who all went over\r\ntogether. The Whigs raised a shout, made a rush forward, and by sheer\r\nweight hurled the Butt-enders down the staircase. After them poured the\r\nvictors, with Travis at their head. The Irish shillelahs were nothing\r\nbefore his hickory: he knocked down or disabled a man at every blow.\r\nStill the Locos made a vigorous attempt to rally in the lower entry, but\r\nat that moment a reinforcement arrived for the Whigs, which completed\r\ntheir defeat. A band of _Unionists_ (a Whig association formed in\r\nopposition to the Butt-enders) had been parading the streets with music\r\nand banners, and they now arrived in time to fall furiously on the rear\r\nof their antagonists. The Loco-Focos, thus hemmed in between two fires,\r\nwere gloriously pommelled for about five minutes. At length, with a\r\ndesperate charge, they broke through the Unionists, and fled\r\nprecipitately down Broadway, while the band accompanied their retreat\r\nwith the complimentary air of the \"Rogue's March.\"\r\n\r\nThe victors re-assembled in the big room, somewhat diminished in numbers\r\n(even after the accession of the Unionists) and dilapidated in attire.\r\nTravis, who had been foremost throughout the whole row, bore especial\r\nmarks of it on his person. His coat was slit down the back, and _minus_\r\nseveral buttons in front; his cravat utterly missing, and his shirt, so\r\nmuch of it as was visible, might possibly have made patches for a rifle,\r\nbut was of no particular value as an article of dress. But such little\r\nincidents only served to increase the general hilarity of triumph. The\r\nmeeting was reconstructed, the resolutions passed, and they wound off\r\nwith a Harrison song--in fact, with two or three. It was near midnight\r\nbefore the walls of the Masonic Hall ceased to echo to such strains as\r\nthese:--\r\n\r\n    To turn out the administration\r\n      Is the very best thing we can do;\r\n    'Twill be for the good of the nation\r\n      To put in old Tippecanoe.\r\n\r\n          _Chorus all._\r\n\r\n    Hurrah for old Tippecanoe--oo--oo!\r\n      Hurrah for old Tippecanoe!\r\n    'Twill be for the good of the nation\r\n      To put in old Tippecanoe!\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the very demonstrative character of the row, no lives\r\nwere lost or bones broken. Even Lloyd, though sadly trodden on by both\r\nparties after his fall, sustained no serious injury, nor did the combat\r\nof the cousins give rise to any permanent difficulty between them. The\r\nregistry law was passed some weeks after, to the great disgust of the\r\nLoco-Focos, eight or nine hundred of whose voters were thereby placed on\r\nthe list of unavailables.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[3] It is a mistake to suppose that the presidential election is\r\n_always_ attended with great excitement. Monroe literally walked over\r\nthe course for his second term. Martin Van Buren's election passed off\r\nvery quietly; and General Taylor's, being taken almost as a matter of\r\ncourse, was accompanied by no extraordinary demonstrations.\r\n\r\n[4] Now more than 600,000.\r\n\r\n[5] This _sobriquet_, at first applied to a small fraction of the\r\nNew-York democrats, which fraction afterwards absorbed the whole party,\r\nhad its origin in the following incident: A quarrel occurring at Tammany\r\nHall (the head-quarters of the democracy), the majority moved an\r\nadjournment, and, to make sure of it, put out the lights. The recusants,\r\nin anticipation of some such step, had provided themselves with _lucifer\r\nmatches_, and, by their aid, re-lit the lamps, and continued the\r\nmeeting. Lucifers were then called loco-focos--why, no one knows; the\r\nname was probably invented by some imaginative popular manufacturer of\r\nthe article; and the appellation of _Loco-Foco party_ was proposed in\r\nderision, for this small band of seceders; who, however, in time,\r\nbrought over the original majority to their views. Hence the Whigs\r\ncontinued to apply the contemptuous designation to the whole democratic\r\nor radical party.\r\n\r\n[6] Cornelius Matthews, to whom this quotation from memory may possibly\r\ndo injustice, but the work in which it occurs is now out of print.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Bentley's Miscellany.\r\n\r\nTHE JEWISH HEROINE: A STORY OF TANGIER.[7]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of the year 1834, there resided in Tangier a Jew,\r\nHaim Hachuel, who employed himself, as well as his wife, Simla, in\r\ncommercial pursuits. They had two children; the eldest, Ysajar, followed\r\nthe trade of his father; the second was a daughter, Sol, who had just\r\ncompleted her seventeenth year, and whose rare and surpassing beauty was\r\nthe admiration of all who saw her. Though Fortune lavished not her\r\nsmiles on Haim Hachuel, he lacked not the means of living in comfort\r\nwith his small family, by his own and Simla's unassisted efforts, the\r\nlatter taking charge not only of the education of her daughter, but of\r\nthe whole management of the domestic affairs, and even the common work\r\nof the house. The careful mother, however, provided that her daughter's\r\nemployments should be limited as much as possible to household cares, so\r\nthat the entire arrangement of them gradually devolved on the fair Sol\r\nas she grew up.\r\n\r\nIn the earlier years of the young Jewess's life, she submitted passively\r\nenough to the restraint imposed upon her by her mother, and was almost\r\nalways to be found busied in the toils suited to her sex; but as she\r\nadvanced towards womanhood, the tastes and passions natural to her age\r\nbegan to develope themselves, and the lovely Sol, becoming conscious of\r\nthe many charms with which Nature had endowed her, chafed at the rigor\r\nof her seclusion. Her mother, hitherto her chief and only friend, now\r\ndeemed it prudent to assume towards the young maiden a severity of\r\ndemeanor, which so exasperated her, that, not finding within her home\r\nthose innocent recreations suitable to her age, and which her heart so\r\ngreatly desired, she was tempted to seek abroad for sympathy and\r\nparticipation in her griefs.\r\n\r\nNear the dwelling of Hachuel lived a Moorish woman, by name Tâhra\r\nMesmudi. With this person the young Jewess formed an acquaintance,\r\nwhich soon grew into friendship. Her mother occasionally gave her\r\npermission to visit her; and on these occasions she would spend the time\r\nin relating domestic occurrences,--and at other times, eluding her\r\nmother's vigilant eye, she would slip out of the house to impart her\r\nsorrows to Tâhra, and receive her sympathy. Simla endeavored on more\r\nthan one occasion to check the growing intimacy of the young girl with\r\ntheir Mahometan neighbor; but, little able to foresee its deplorable\r\nresults, and secure in her daughter's confidence, she was unwilling to\r\ndeprive her altogether of this slight indulgence. In this state,\r\ntherefore, things remained for awhile, Sol taking a reluctant part in\r\nthe labors allotted to her by her mother, and but rarely appearing in\r\nthe streets, though when she did so, her surpassing charms gained her\r\nthe homage of crowds of admirers, who thought themselves happy in\r\nobtaining even a passing sight of this prodigy of Nature's work, usually\r\nsecluded from all eyes but those of the proud and happy authors of her\r\nexistence. But, however the high spirit of the enchanting Sol rebelled\r\nagainst her fate, deeply and violently as she resented her bondage, no\r\nmurmur ever escaped her lips, and her false neighbor was the only\r\nconfidant of her sorrow; and already (so various are the disguises of\r\nseeming friendship) even now did Tâhra meditate a project destined to be\r\nthe ruin of the fair Jewess.\r\n\r\nAmongst the Arabs, the conversion of an infidel (by which name they\r\ndesignate all those who do not conform to their creed), is esteemed an\r\naction in the highest degree meritorious. This conquest to their faith,\r\ntherefore, they make wherever an opportunity is open to them, by the\r\nmost indiscriminate and unscrupulous means, according to the teaching of\r\nthe Alcôran, which allows the lawfulness of all means, and the most\r\nunbounded license in their choice, for the attainment of a lawful\r\nobject. Tâhra, the Moor, failed not, accordingly, in her intercourse\r\nwith the youthful Sol, to extol, as it were incidentally, the excellence\r\nof her religion, the many advantages enjoined by its adherents, and the\r\nunbounded esteem awarded by the true believers to those who consented to\r\nembrace it. But the lovely and innocent-minded Jewess, quite unconscious\r\nof the malignant purpose of her neighbor, heeded none of her\r\nexhortations, but rather listened to them with a degree of compassion.\r\nBeing herself certain of her faith, and feeling an enthusiastic interest\r\nin the law under which she was born, she regarded merely as an excess of\r\nreligious sentiment, the zeal which prompted the Mahometan to persevere\r\nin these encomiums of her religious tenets.\r\n\r\nThe dawn gleamed forth one day amid a thousand clouds, which hung in\r\nthick masses below the sky, and covered it with an opaque and gloomy\r\nscreen; the mournful twittering of the warbling birds bespoke anxiety\r\nand alarm; the hoarse rushing of the wind threatened destruction to the\r\nwoods; the flowers of the fields began to droop; the sun withdrew his\r\nlight from the world beneath, and all seemed to presage a day of grief\r\nand bitterness--save in the home where the fair Sol arose, like another\r\nCirce, from her couch, and sallied forth, seeming to temper by her\r\nenchanting presence the angry frowns of the elements without. In the\r\nhouse of Hachuel was a chamber, set apart for devotional purposes.\r\nThither she directed her earliest steps, having previously (after the\r\nmanner of the Hebrews) cleansed her hands from all impurity. On quitting\r\nthis oratory, she occupied herself in the various works of the house;\r\nbut, as noon drew on, her mother, with her wonted asperity, reproved her\r\nfor not having already completed her household task. Sol replied with a\r\ndegree of warmth which aroused the anger of her mother, who angrily\r\nreproached and even threatened her with chastisement; when, in a fatal\r\nmoment, the young girl, fearing lest she should be scourged, ran with\r\nprecipitation to the house of the neighbor Tâhra for refuge. Throwing\r\nherself into the arms of her from whom she expected some alleviation of\r\nher sorrow, the beautiful Sol again and again lamented the hardness of\r\nher fate, and wished for deliverance from the state of oppression in\r\nwhich she felt herself overwhelmed, betraying by her tears and profound\r\nagitation the excitement of her feelings and the disorder of her\r\nimagination; while the crafty Mahometan, perceiving the confusion into\r\nwhich her mind was thrown by the mingled feelings of resentment and\r\ngrief to which she was giving way, listened with delight to her\r\ncomplaints, well knowing that the moment was now at hand when she might\r\nbest execute her project.\r\n\r\n\"My daughter,\" said she, \"thou art unhappy only because thou wilt be so.\r\nThy mother enslaves thee, and thy passiveness meets only with hardships\r\nand abuse. Thy neighbors and acquaintance compassionate thee; all are\r\nscandalized at thy mother's treatment, and blame thee for not seeking a\r\nremedy for thy sorrows, when it is in thy power to do so. No moment more\r\npropitious than the present could offer itself to thee; I will be thy\r\nprotector--I will be thy friend. To my care intrust thy salvation, and\r\nbe comforted. Sweet Sol, dost thou not understand me?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not understand you, Tâhra,\" the sorrowful girl replied. \"There can\r\nbe no sufficient reason why I should withdraw myself from the control of\r\nmy mother; yet, though it is true that she sometimes scolds me with\r\nreason, at other times her anger is kindled against me without any\r\ncause, or for the most trifling neglect. O! were she to treat me with\r\nmore kindness, I should not be so unhappy!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hope not, dear child,\" said the Mahometan, \"that thy mother will treat\r\nthee better at any future time than now. She will sacrifice thee, on the\r\ncontrary, to her caprice and fanatism. Dost thou wish to be freed from\r\nher power this very day? Listen, then! Often hast thou heard of the\r\nexcellence of our religion. Embrace the Moorish faith; cast off thy\r\ntrammels, and be free!\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! Tâhra,\" replied the young maiden, \"what a fearful, what a\r\nhorrible proposition you make me! Never could I learn to be a true\r\nMahometan. I listen to you, and hear you speak, as though I were in a\r\ndream. I long for repose; let me enjoy it for a while, I pray you.\"\r\n\r\nSuch was the conversation between the two friends. At its close, the\r\nyouthful Jewess departed to seek the rest she so greatly needed, in a\r\nsolitary apartment; and the Mahometan flew, with the speed of the wind,\r\nto execute her meditated project.\r\n\r\nThe Moorish Governor of Tangier, who exercises both civil and military\r\npower, was at this time Arbi Esid, a man of a stern and capricious\r\ncharacter. To him Tâhra, the Moor, repaired, soliciting an audience. She\r\ntold him that her home had afforded refuge to a young maiden of the\r\nHebrews, who was fairer than the spring, and whom she had led by her\r\narguments to the verge of Mahometanism; but that should she remain\r\nbeneath her roof, her resolutions would certainly be frustrated by her\r\nmother, since the contiguity of their abodes rendered communication so\r\neasy, that it would be impossible to carry out the work of conversion,\r\nor to annul the maternal influence. This audacious dissembler failed not\r\nto enlarge on the difficulty and importance of her conquest, and the\r\ngovernor, without further demur, commanded a soldier[8] to bring the\r\nunhappy Jewess into his presence. The thunderbolt that rends the airy\r\nregion, travels not with more fatal celerity than did the mandate of the\r\nMoorish governor.\r\n\r\nSol was yet listening to the announcement of Tâhra Mesmudi, when, at one\r\nand the same moment, entered Simla, demanding her lost daughter, and the\r\nsoldier bearing the order of Arbi Esid. Words are unequal to depict the\r\nscene that ensued. The innocent Sol, ignorant as she was of the whole\r\nplot, in vain endeavored to ascertain the cause of this abrupt and\r\nalarming summons. Her mother, Simla, equally amazed, embraced her\r\nrepeatedly, and sought by the most passionate efforts to detain her in\r\nher arms, from whence she was forced away by the soldier, impatient to\r\nfulfil his mission--and those hearts, never more destined to beat one\r\nagainst the other, were torn asunder and separated for ever. Tâhra\r\nalone, the fanatical and reckless Moor, understood this mystery, while\r\nshe assumed the most profound ignorance, lest her participation in the\r\nact should be suspected; and in this moment of anguish, as in all ages\r\nof the world, force triumphed over right and justice. The soldier\r\nroughly disengaged the arms of the two unhappy Hebrews, which were\r\nentwined in each other, and held them apart by main strength: and the\r\nfair Sol pressed her coral lips on the wet cheek of her mother, Simla,\r\nand bade her a last farewell.\r\n\r\n\"Mother,\" she said, \"calm your sorrow. I know not the views of the\r\ngovernor in thus summoning me before him, but conscience tells me I have\r\nno cause for fear. Trust, then, in my innocence, and think upon my love\r\ntill I return to your arms, innocent and uninjured as I now leave them.\"\r\n\r\nThe impatient threats of the soldier allowed no more time for these\r\nfilial protestations. The victim was carried off, and her mother,\r\nfollowing with her eyes the retreating steps of her trembling daughter,\r\nwept unconsoled at the prospect of the bitter future.\r\n\r\nWhen Arbi Esid was apprised of the arrival of the lovely prisoner, he\r\nordered that she should be at once brought into his private hall of\r\naudience.[9] He was, on her entrance, so captivated by the sight of her,\r\nthat feelings arose in his heart greatly at variance with the outward\r\ngravity of his demeanor.\r\n\r\n\"Enter,\" said he, \"and divest yourself of all fear. I am he who, in the\r\nname of the Prophet, will protect your resolution, and promote your\r\nhappiness. The great Allah has sent forth a ray from his transcendent\r\nlight to win you to his religion, and to turn you from the errors of\r\nyour own. This hour gives birth to your happiness.\"\r\n\r\nThe Hebrew maiden heard with amazement the words of the governor; and\r\nwithout removing her eyes from the ground, where they had remained fixed\r\never since her first entrance, she preserved the deepest silence.\r\n\r\n\"Answerest thou not, bewitching Sol?\" continued Arbi Esid; \"fair as the\r\nHouris of the Prophet's Paradise, canst thou refuse to embrace his\r\nfaith? What then have I heard from thy friend and neighbor Tâhra.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have been deceived, sir,\" replied the Jewess; \"never did I express\r\nsuch a wish; never did I yield to the entreaties and proposals of Tâhra\r\nMesmundi. I was born a Hebrew, and a Hebrew I desire to die.\"\r\n\r\nThese words, uttered with inimitable sweetness and modesty, so far from\r\nraising the anger of the governor, rendered him only the more anxious to\r\nconvert her. He commanded that Tâhra, the Moor, should be brought into\r\nhis presence, that she might ratify her deposition; and, before long,\r\nshe arrived, perfidy and deceit depicted in her countenance. \"Enter,\"\r\nsaid Arbi Esid, \"and recapitulate, in the presence of the prisoner, the\r\nimportant deposition you urged upon me this morning.\"[10]\r\n\r\n\"Sir,\" replied the false witness, \"this young Jewess, who took refuge in\r\nmy house to escape the rigorous treatment of her mother, declared to me\r\nthis morning her desire of embracing our religion; and it was by her\r\nconsent I gave your excellency notice of this resolution, that you might\r\nextend your protection to her. This is what I affirmed, and this I now\r\nrepeat. Does any one deny it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my Tâhra!\" exclaimed the lovely Sol, with vehemence. \"I cannot\r\naccuse you of any treachery; yet the very words you bring against me\r\nshow that you have misunderstood my meaning, and hence the mistake which\r\nhas caused the imprudent step you have taken.\"\r\n\r\nThe affectionate words of Sol were contradicted by Tâhra, with a degree\r\nof asperity and roughness, that cruelly wounded the gentle heart of the\r\nenchanting Jewess.\r\n\r\n\"Hearest thou all this, stubborn girl?\" said the governor to her. \"By\r\nthe deposition of this Moor, you are convicted of a crime that death\r\nitself could scarce atone for, were you even on the instant to retract,\r\nand embrace the truth.\"\r\n\r\nThe conference here closed. Tâhra departed, and the governor himself\r\nconducted the fair Sol to the apartments of his wife and\r\ndaughter-in-law, on whom he urged his wish that she should be treated\r\nwith the utmost kindness, and that no pains might be spared to win over\r\nher heart.\r\n\r\nHere we must for a while leave the afflicted Sol, to contemplate the\r\nstate in which her parents remained during her absence. Her hapless\r\nmother, as we have related, watched her with anxious eyes till she had\r\nentered the governor's palace with the Moorish soldier; and, utterly\r\nunable to form a conjecture as to the cause of her sudden abduction, she\r\nhastened full of grief and consternation to find her husband Haim, to\r\nwhom she gave a scarcely coherent relation of all that had occurred.\r\n\r\nThe astonished Hebrew broke forth into vehement exclamations; in this\r\nconfusion of doubt and suspicion, Simla became the first object of his\r\nanger, and the frenzied disorder of his gestures threatened her with the\r\nmost fatal consequences; a deadly fear seized upon his faculties, and\r\nagitated him well-nigh to insanity, and he sought a clue to the terrible\r\nmystery in vain. Accompanied by Simla, he hastened to the dwelling of\r\nthe artful Tâhra, and put to her a thousand questions, to some of which\r\nshe evasively replied, while in answering others she assumed a\r\nthreatening and reckless tone, which disclosed to Haim some portion of\r\nthe truth. For an instant he remained silent, then, burning with the\r\nmost violent rage, he grasped the hand of his wife, and rushed back to\r\ntheir desolate home in a state akin to that of the wounded prey of the\r\nhunter, seeking its forest lair. \"You,\" exclaimed he, frantically, \"you\r\nonly are the cause of this misfortune! my daughter Sol, the daughter\r\nwhose sight lightened my cares, and gave joy to my existence, God knows\r\nif ever again she will return to my arms; this Moor, this Tâhra Mesmudi,\r\nthis treacherous and perverse infidel, has turned aside her heart, and\r\nshe has thrown herself into the trammels of impiety; to gain a refuge\r\nfrom your rigor she has sought compassion in the tiger's breast.\"\r\n\r\n\"My daughter, my daughter!\" cried the affrighted Simla, \"let not mine\r\neyes behold a ruin so great!\" and she fell senseless into the arms of\r\nHaim Hachuel. Thus did these unhappy parents lament their loss, losing\r\nsight of their sorrow only in the vain hope of devising some plan for\r\nthe salvation of their daughter.\r\n\r\nThe prisoner remained in the residence of the governor, surrounded by\r\nits female inhabitants, and the women of the highest rank residing in\r\nthe place,--all vying with one another to dazzle the fair Jewess by\r\nshowing her the riches and splendor of the edifice.\r\n\r\n\"Far more,\" they said to her, \"far more than this array of wealth and\r\ngrandeur shall one day be the portion of thy loveliness and virtue. A\r\ngallant Moor, rich, powerful, and ardent for thy love, shall join his\r\nhand with thine, and a thousand slaves shall bow down at thy behest. All\r\nthe precious things of Asia and Arabia shall be brought to delight thine\r\neyes, the rarest birds of distant regions shall warble in unison with\r\nthe lays of thy fancy.\"\r\n\r\nThese and other persuasions clothed in the glowing language of their\r\nnation, did the Moorish women lavish on her for three days, during which\r\ntime she remained in the palace. But the beautiful Jewess wept on, and\r\nthought only of her parents and brother.\r\n\r\n\"Never,\" said she, \"will I exchange the humble _toca_ of my brethren for\r\nthe rich turban you offer: never will I abandon my God.\"\r\n\r\nThis decision Sol pronounced with such fervor and animation before the\r\nwhole of the Moorish ladies, that, stung by her perseverance, they ran\r\nin anger to the Hall of Audience, and apprised the governor of her\r\nrefusal.\r\n\r\nArbi Esid immediately ordered her to be led into his presence, and\r\nreproving her for her haughtiness and obstinacy, he pointed out the\r\nperil in which she was involving herself, and repeated his determination\r\nof subduing her resolution. But the young Hebrew rejected his\r\nallurements, depreciated his gifts, and defied his power, even to death.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"I will load thee with chains,\" said the governor; \"thou shalt be torn\r\nby wild beasts, and see no more the light of day; thou shalt lie,\r\nperishing with hunger, and lamenting the rigor of my anger and\r\nindignation, for thou hast provoked the wrath of the Prophet and\r\nslighted his laws.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will submit tranquilly,\" replied Sol, \"to the weight of your chains;\r\nI will allow my limbs to be torn asunder by wild beasts; I will renounce\r\nfor ever the light of day; I will die of hunger; and when every torture\r\nyou can command has been endured, I will scorn your anger and the wrath\r\nof the Prophet, since they are unable to conquer even a weak woman, and\r\ndo but show your impotence in the sight of Heaven, whose strength you\r\nboast, to gain one proselyte to your creed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Atrocious blasphemy!\" exclaimed the enraged governor; \"thus dost thou\r\nprofane the most sacred names, thus dost thou reject all consideration?\r\nI will bury thee in dark dungeons, where thou shalt drink the cup of\r\nbitterness. Take this Hebrew,\" continued the governor, \"to prison; let\r\nher suffer in the most loathsome dungeon--let her there feel the effect\r\nof my displeasure.\" Then turning his back upon her, his eyes flashing\r\nwith ire, he abandoned the victim, who was immediately conducted to the\r\nprison.\r\n\r\nThe Alcazaba is a castle situate on a little eminence at the extremity\r\nof the town, where prisoners are confined. Thither was the beautiful\r\nJewess conducted, in the first instance, though the soldiers\r\nsubsequently removed her to a place destined for the female prisoners\r\nonly, where was a small cell, dirty and fetid, with one narrow window\r\nlooking into the street. In this dungeon, where she was unable to stand\r\nerect, was the young Hebrew confined. During the three days that she had\r\nremained in the governor's palace, her parents had not failed to inform\r\nthemselves of every thing that befell her--even to her removal to the\r\nAlcazaba, and subsequent confinement in this dungeon. It was night\r\nbefore Haim Hachuel and Simla his wife directed their anxious steps\r\ntowards the prison. Haim's searching eye ran over the whole edifice at a\r\nglance, and soon discovered the beloved object of their attachment.\r\nThere was the beautiful Sol, in truth, holding the iron bars that\r\nsecured the small window, her snow-white hands shining amid the gloom,\r\nwhiter than the pure linen on the dusky skin of the African. All around\r\nreigned the silence of the grave, save when at intervals it was\r\ninterrupted by the sound of oppressed sighs, as of one who could scarce\r\nbreathe.\r\n\r\n\"It is she!\" said Simla, in great emotion: \"let us draw near, and press\r\nher hands to our heart.\"\r\n\r\nThese last words reached the ears of the unhappy prisoner, and forgetful\r\nof the many watchful eyes and ears around her, she exclaimed in a sad\r\nand piercing voice: \"Mother, O mother! come, and witness my repentance!\"\r\n\r\nHaim Hachuel and his wife flew instantly to the dismal grating of the\r\ndungeon. They grasped the hands of their unhappy daughter, and she also\r\nseizing those of her parents, bathed them with her tears, so that for a\r\nmoment neither could utter a word.\r\n\r\n\"Dear daughter,\" said they at length to her, \"what do you propose to do?\r\nAre you resolved to embrace the law of Mahomet?\"\r\n\r\n\"Never, my parents!\" she answered, \"I regard these sufferings as\r\nchastenings from Heaven for my sins; when I meditate upon them, methinks\r\nI hear a voice within me, saying, 'Thou didst fail in the duty of an\r\nobedient child; behold now, and suffer the consequence of thy\r\ntransgression.'\"\r\n\r\nScarcely had Sol concluded, when the clashing of iron bolts apprised her\r\nparents that some one was approaching this abode of bitterness. Quickly,\r\ntherefore, did they disengage their hands, and promising to return the\r\nfollowing evening, plunged in the deepest grief they reluctantly quitted\r\nthe place, lest they should be discovered, and deprived of what was now\r\ntheir only consolation. They were not mistaken; the person that opened\r\nthe door of the cell proved to be the woman in charge of the prison, who\r\ncame to acquaint the beautiful Sol of the governor's order, that she\r\nshould be cut off from all intercourse with her friends, and treated\r\nwith yet greater severity and harshness.\r\n\r\nUnmoved, she listened to this cruel mandate of the tyrannical governor,\r\nand, raising her eyes to heaven, only uttered these words, \"I revere, O\r\nLord, thy heavenly decrees!\" The Mahometan departed in some emotion, and\r\nthe young Jewess, kneeling, addressed herself to loftier contemplations.\r\n\r\nHaim Hachuel and his wife spent a night of most torturing suspense. On\r\ntheir return from the Mazmorra, they told every thing to their son,\r\nYsajar; who, going immediately to the prison, with some difficulty\r\ngained over the jailer, a Moorish woman, by offering her gifts,--and at\r\nlength succeeded in obtaining her good offices for his unfortunate\r\nsister, and permission to communicate with her through the narrow\r\ngrating of her cell, under cover of the night. Having obtained this by a\r\nheavy golden bribe, he hastened to report what he had done to his\r\nparents. Scarcely less than the pain that agitated the prostrate Sol, in\r\nher loathsome dungeon, was the heart-rending emotion endured by her\r\nunhappy parents; all were anxious for the morning, and longed for dawn\r\nto dispel the gloom of this terrible night. Never did the glorious sun\r\ndescribe his orbit so slowly as on that weary day--never did human\r\nhearts so long for its termination--hours seemed like years--the day\r\nlike an endless century; at length, for all things below must end, the\r\nday closed and the night set in, when the afflicted parents and brother\r\na second time repaired to receive the consolation of gazing on the\r\npallid countenance of the imprisoned Sol.\r\n\r\nWho shall describe these afflicting interviews? tears, sighs, broken\r\nwords, every emotion of love and pity succeeded each other in quick\r\nsuccession; but the night vanished as rapidly as the day had wearily\r\nwithdrawn, and the moment of separation arrived--the Mahometan\r\nprison-keeper admonishing them to depart. They did so, torn with\r\nemotions that none but those who have loved, none but those who have\r\nsuffered, none but those who are parents, can comprehend, and this\r\nnight, and the day that followed, were spent in grief and agony. Haim\r\nHachuel sought by various means to discover the intentions of the\r\ngovernor, but learnt only that the mere recollection of the Hebrew\r\ncaptive sufficed to excite him to fury, and to call forth resolutions of\r\nthe most barbarous character. The agonized father, well nigh\r\nheart-broken at such information, harassed his imagination to find a way\r\nto save his child.\r\n\r\nThe governor, Arbi Esid, forgot not for a moment the Jewish captive; for\r\neach day information was brought to him respecting the state of apparent\r\ndejection in which she was; and, at the expiration of the third day of\r\nher imprisonment, he sent to inquire whether she would now consent to\r\nembrace the Law of the Prophet? The bearer of this message was one of\r\nhis secretaries, who, on entering the dungeon, was astonished at the\r\nbeauty of the maiden he beheld. He put to her several inquiries\r\nrespecting her condition, which were answered with amiability and\r\nmodesty: but upon his telling her that he was secretary to the governor,\r\nArbi Esid, and that he had come, in his name, to know whether she had\r\nyet decided to become a Mahometan, the prisoner's countenance and\r\nattitude suddenly changed, and assumed an expression of imposing\r\ndignity, as she addressed him in these terms: \"Tell the governor, on my\r\npart, that if he be not already content with all I have suffered, let\r\nhim invent new torments, which the Hebrew Sol will accept as Heaven's\r\nchastening for her sins; but become a Mahomedan--never!\" So, turning\r\naway from him, she knelt, and addressed herself to prayer.\r\n\r\nPale as death, fearing the anger of the governor, and his self-love\r\nwounded at the failure of his embassy, the secretary left the dungeon,\r\nand returned with all speed to the palace. The governor, on becoming\r\nacquainted with the determination of the youthful Jewess, raved with the\r\nferocity of a tiger, and commanded that she should be loaded with\r\nchains. And so greatly did the satellites of his despotism delight in\r\nthe works of cruelty, that not much time elapsed ere the savage mandate\r\nwas put into execution. The beautiful Sol was taken from her dungeon,\r\nand placed in a cold, humid, subterranean cell--without air, and darker\r\nthan the night; on her white and chiselled throat was clasped a ring of\r\niron, to which were linked four chains that bound her hands and feet;\r\nthe weight of the heavy metal prevented her standing erect; the damp\r\nground was her only couch, and the only rest for her tortured limbs.\r\nSad, and full of anguish, was the solitude that now awaited this angel\r\nof virtue; but nothing could discourage, nothing could daunt her.\r\n\r\nThe young Hebrew occupied herself in thoughts full of courage, and\r\nreflections full of moral fortitude; whilst her parents, who had been\r\nduly apprised of her removal to the subterranean cell, spent their time\r\nin lamenting the sad change, and in seeking out persons whose influence\r\nmight soften the obdurate heart of the governor. In this search did Haim\r\nHachuel renew his diligence, every day that the unfortunate maiden\r\ncontinued to groan beneath her chains, till at length his paternal\r\nlamentations reached the compassionate ears of Don Jose Rico,\r\nvice-consul of Spain, at that time, in Tangier. The voice of complaining\r\nhumanity never failed to touch the feeling heart of this good man; nor\r\ncould he rest till his benevolent work was begun. He respectfully,\r\ntherefore, petitioned the governor to mitigate the sufferings of the\r\nyoung Jewess, or even, if possible, to liberate her altogether; public\r\nsympathy being, as he represented, already excited in her behalf to a\r\npowerful degree. These representations he urged with so much force and\r\neffect, that, had the matter rested in the hands of Arbi Esid alone, he\r\nwould have set her at liberty at once. However, he replied with\r\nconsiderable courtesy, that the whole circumstances of the affair had\r\nbeen referred to the emperor, of whose imperial commands he was in\r\nmomentary expectation. This answer placed the matter in a less favorable\r\nlight, in the eyes of Don Jose--obstructing, as it did, any means of\r\nbringing comfort to the helpless Sol, while she, still immured in the\r\ndungeon, looked forward to death as the only escape from her\r\naccumulating woes. Many days did not elapse, however, before the\r\nexpected dispatches arrived from the emperor, bearing his orders that\r\nthe captive Jewess should be conducted immediately to Fez.\r\n\r\nThis unexpected and unlooked-for result caused the utmost consternation\r\namong all acquainted with the circumstances. Both Moors and Hebrews\r\nevinced an almost equal desire to preserve the life of the beautiful\r\nSol; but the fatal order admitted no delay, and there was no choice but\r\nto comply with it with the utmost promptitude. The governor, therefore,\r\nsummoned Haim Hachuel, and after communicating to him the commands of\r\nthe emperor, he informed him that his daughter must begin her journey to\r\nFez on the following day, and required of him the necessary sum\r\n(amounting to forty dollars)[11] to defray the expenses of the transit.\r\nThis he demanded within two hours' time.\r\n\r\nThe Jew returned with several friends to his own home, and secretly\r\narranged that one of them should follow his daughter at a distance, so\r\nas not to lose sight of her altogether. It was no easy matter to find\r\none able and willing to undertake a mission of so much difficulty and\r\ndanger, in defiance of the express commands of the governor; but at\r\nlength a Jew, but little known in the town, was found to accept the\r\ncharge, and having provided himself with money, he was sent on the way.\r\n\r\nWhilst Haim and his son were busied in these preparations, the unhappy\r\nSimla lay on her bed in a state of utter prostration. When the tidings\r\nof her beloved Sol's intended departure reached her, she prepared to see\r\nher pass from a secure hiding-place, and thence to bid her farewell, as\r\nthough she were to see her no more for ever. Not only, indeed, to the\r\nparents and brother of Sol were the hours of the night laden with\r\ntribulation and anguish, all their friends and neighbors shared their\r\ngriefs. The unhappy victim alone, to whom the dreadful tidings were\r\ncommunicated at midnight, heard them with an unaltered countenance,\r\nthough a deep sigh sufficiently proved her feelings in the terrible\r\nsituation in which she was placed.\r\n\r\nAn hour before dawn was the time appointed for Sol's departure. At the\r\nmoment fixed, a Moor, of a countenance most savage and repulsive,\r\npresented himself at the dungeon-gate, leading by their bridles two\r\nactive mules. He was shortly followed by five soldiers, who were to form\r\nthe escort, and when all were assembled, the muleteer, who was charged\r\nwith the conduct of the affair, knocked at the door of the prison, and\r\non its being opened, entered to bring the captive forth.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, her parents, her brother, and many of her friends, had\r\nconcealed themselves at a certain distance, where they could remain\r\nundiscovered, to witness this sad scene, and compelled themselves to\r\nsilence the groans and sighs by which their hearts were torn, so as to\r\nescape detection. The eyes of all were riveted on that spot where the\r\nvictim was to emerge from the prison. Every thing was distinctly visible\r\nin the clear morning air; and in a little time the object of their hopes\r\ncame forth, and at sight of her, Simla fell fainting into the arms of\r\nher husband and son. Sol came forth with a slow and tremulous step,\r\nsupported by the horrible muleteer, the pallor of her countenance\r\ncontrasting with the ebony blackness of her bright and speaking eyes,\r\nwhose glances fell searchingly around. Her hair was gathered up beneath\r\nthe humble white \"toco,\" which formed the graceful covering of her head,\r\nand her dark blue dress accorded well with the interesting cast of her\r\nfair features, giving a grave and imposing character to her whole\r\nfigure. Her delicate feet were bound with heavy fetters, which scarce\r\npermitted her to move; and her whole appearance was so pathetic and\r\ninteresting, that it is scarcely possible for the pen to describe the\r\nscene. All passed in silence; and the echo of sighs was the only\r\nlanguage of this fearful drama.\r\n\r\nThe muleteer threw some cords over his beast's trappings, the better to\r\nsecure his victim. Meanwhile, the beautiful Jewess, turning--as though\r\ninstinctively--towards the spot where her mourning parents stood, asked\r\none of the soldiers who guarded her, to assist her to kneel. This being\r\npermitted, she folded her hands upon her breast, and looking up to\r\nheaven, exclaimed, in broken accents: \"God of Abraham! Thou who knowest\r\nthe innocence of my heart, receive the sacrifice which I have made in\r\nabandoning the spot where I was born. Console my parents and brother for\r\nmy loss. Strengthen my spirit, and abandon not this, Thy unhappy\r\ncreature, who always trusted in Thee--make her one day happy in the\r\nmansions of the just, with those blessed souls whom Thou electest for\r\nThy greater glory and adoration.\"\r\n\r\nAfter she had remained a few moments longer in silent devotion, the\r\nmuleteer, being apprised that it was time to start, rudely tore her from\r\nher knees, and with a brutal and reckless violence, capable of revolting\r\nthe hardest hearts, placed her on the saddle. Lashing her already\r\nfettered feet with a thick cord, he bound it also around her wrists,\r\nbruising her delicate flesh; and tying a rope in numerous coils round\r\nher body, he lashed it to the harness of the mule. The savage Moor\r\nhaving made all secure, tightened the lashings, and seemed to delight\r\nabove measure in the excruciating torture he thus inflicted upon his\r\npatient victim. Not a word, not a complaint escaped her; nor did her\r\ngrave and composed demeanor forsake her for an instant, though she\r\nregarded her tormentor with a look of suffering patience, unspeakably\r\naffecting. The soldiers, who had looked on in silence during this scene,\r\nnow shouldered their arms; the muleteer mounting the baggage mule, and\r\nleading, by his right hand, that which carried the youthful prisoner,\r\nfrom which the soldiers never for an instant withdrew their eyes, soon\r\nset the animals in motion by the well-known touch of the spur, and the\r\njourney commenced--when, for the first time, a piercing cry escaped the\r\nlips of the fair Sol:--\"Adieu! adieu!\" exclaimed she; \"adieu for ever,\r\nmy native land!\" And soon they entered on the road to Fez.\r\n\r\nIf the unconcerned spectators were moved even to tears on witnessing\r\nthis scene, what were the feelings of the parents who were eye-witnesses\r\nof all that passed! Love, tenderness, and sorrow, every emotion that\r\ncould agitate them, struggled for utterance within their breasts. Haim\r\nand Simla and the young Ysajar, fell on their knees, and sent up to\r\nHeaven their hearts' supplications; they followed with their eyes the\r\ndeparting cavalcade, their gaze riveted like those of a spectre; no need\r\nwas there now to enjoin them to keep silence, for their utterance was\r\nstifled on their lips; a red-hot iron seemed to weigh upon their\r\nbreasts; they raised their eyes to the heavens, to that beautiful\r\nAfrican sky, pure and transparent as an arch of azure crystal, and it\r\nseemed to them like a roof of lead, in which the bright sun appeared a\r\nrolling ball of blood-red hue; their hands, with a convulsive grasp,\r\ntore the hair from their heads, and rending their garments in despair,\r\nthey fell senseless to the earth. Their relatives and friends conveyed\r\nthem, still insensible, to their homes, and applied restoratives to\r\nrecall animation. But, alas! to what a consciousness were they restored!\r\nto the keener and keener sense of that grief which must follow them to\r\nthe latest hour of their existence!\r\n\r\nThe beautiful Sol, meanwhile, travelled on, in the manner already\r\ndescribed, silently enduring the separation from her native soil. About\r\nthree miles of the journey were completed, when there encountered them,\r\nas though by accident, a man, who joined himself to the travellers. This\r\nwas the Jew already mentioned, who being almost a stranger to the Moors,\r\nhad engaged himself to the friends of Sol not to lose sight of her\r\nduring her journey. He entered into conversation with the soldiers, and\r\nfeigning ignorance of the circumstances of the case, soon obtained from\r\nthem an account both of their destination, and of the recent occurrences\r\nat Tangier.\r\n\r\nThe sagacious Hebrew, having thus gained the confidence of the escort,\r\naddressed a few words to the prisoner, giving her to understand that she\r\nought to embrace the law of the Prophet, and become a Mahometan, as he\r\nhimself had done. The beautiful Sol heard him with much tranquillity,\r\nbut without giving any answer; but at a moment when the escort were off\r\ntheir guard, he succeeded in attracting her attention by signs, and in\r\nmaking known to her that he was there for her protection. The poor\r\nvictim comprehended his meaning, and they were thus more than once\r\nenabled to communicate by stealth.\r\n\r\nThe journey to Fez occupied six days, the nights being spent at the\r\ndifferent halting-places. All who saw the prisoner on the road, and were\r\nmade acquainted with the particulars of her situation, earnestly\r\nexhorted, and even implored her to become a proselyte to their faith;\r\nshe heard them with quiet diffidence, and replied modestly to all the\r\narguments directed to her, that she would rather sacrifice her life than\r\nchange her religion. So much courageous perseverance was the admiration\r\nof all who conversed with her, and her situation excited the greatest\r\ninterest and sympathy wherever she passed.\r\n\r\nThe friendly Jew, who still associated himself with the escort, and\r\nprotested that he was on his road to Fez for the purposes of commerce,\r\nobtained permission to speak with and exhort the prisoner, when, in the\r\nHebrew tongue, of which the Moors were ignorant, he took occasion to\r\ntell the young Jewess the object of his commission; he communicated to\r\nher the prohibition of the Governor of Tangier to her parents to leave\r\nthe city, and the trust reposed in him; for the better fulfilment of\r\nwhich he had assumed the language and disguise under which he appeared.\r\nSol replied in the same manner, by requesting him to be the bearer of a\r\nmessage to her parents, assuring them that she had not for a single\r\ninstant forgotten them, and that the thoughts of their sufferings were\r\nmore cruel to her than any that she herself experienced.\r\n\r\nI would not unnecessarily dwell upon this melancholy history by a minute\r\ndescription of the various trials and sufferings endured by the youthful\r\nSol upon the road; they can but too readily be inferred from the\r\nprevious recital. At length, however, the day arrived on which the\r\ntravellers reached Fez, the residence of the Emperor of Morocco. One of\r\nthe soldiers of the escort was sent forward to give notice of their\r\napproach to the Emperor, who issued immediate orders that his son should\r\ngo out upon the road, attended by a splendid retinue, to meet the young\r\ncaptive. Accordingly about evening, the Imperial Prince, escorted by\r\nmore than three hundred of his court, went out on horseback, displaying,\r\nas they went, their skill in the feats of horsemanship by which the\r\nMoors do honor to the person they are escorting, and meeting the young\r\nprisoner on the road, he conducted her to his palace.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[7] The following well-authenticated story, it is believed, has never\r\nyet appeared in English. It is almost a literal translation of a work\r\npublished in Spanish a few years since, and now rarely to be met\r\nwith.--_El Martirio de la Joven Hachuel, or la Heroina Hebrea. Por D. E.\r\nM. Romero, 1837._\r\n\r\n[8] The entire administration of justice in Tangier is intrusted to the\r\nmilitary.\r\n\r\n[9] In the usual mode of administering justice in Tangier, the governor\r\nsits, with his secretaries, in the portico of his house, surrounded by\r\nthe soldiers (who act as police, and are charged with the execution of\r\nthe governor's mandate), armed with swords, and carrying staves in their\r\nhands; while those who are to be tried kneel in the street in front of\r\nthe place occupied by the governor, to await judgment. In the present\r\ncase, however, an exception was made to the general form, the governor\r\nreceiving the young Jewess in his inner hall of audience.\r\n\r\n[10] In the barbarous legislation of the Moors, the evidence of one\r\nwitness alone affords ground sufficient for passing sentence of death;\r\nand in cases relating to the Mahometan religion this is most frequently\r\ncarried out.\r\n\r\n[11] It is the Moorish custom, that all those who are convicted as\r\nguilty, or their families, should pay all costs of the lawsuit, and\r\nevery other contingent expense. Thus, one condemned to suffer the\r\npenalty of one hundred bastinadoes, after he has received them, is\r\ncompelled to pay the executioner the whole sum required for the work of\r\ninflicting them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Fraser's Magazine\r\n\r\nLAMAS AND LAMAISM.\r\n\r\nFRENCH MISSIONARIES IN TARTARY AND THIBET.[12]\r\n\r\n\r\nFew persons in England are aware of the amount of information which has\r\nbeen obtained through the medium of priestly literature in France; not\r\nto speak of the early Jesuit travellers, whose wonderful adventures\r\nfirst familiarized their readers with China and South America, and more\r\nthan one of whom has been cleared, Herodotus-like, of the charge of\r\nexaggeration by the testimony of subsequent writers; not to speak even\r\nof those _Lettres édifiantes et curieuses_, which the Parisian wits and\r\nphilosophers of the eighteenth century did not disdain to read, and\r\nwhich were merely extracts from missionary correspondence; a patient\r\nreader might even in the present day gather from publications of the\r\nsame kind--_Les Annales de la Propagation de la Foi_ for example--many\r\ncurious details respecting savage tribes and distant lands rarely\r\nvisited by learned or worldly travellers. Unfortunately, such books\r\nare, for the most part, written in a style at once so wearisome and so\r\nfull of religious affectation, that only a particular class of readers\r\ncan digest them. The volumes before us--though recalling by their\r\norigin, and certain peculiar views of the writer, the class of works we\r\nhave described--are very superior both in form and matter. We doubt if\r\nany publications, at once so diverting and so instructive, has appeared\r\nin France for a very long while. There is a vein of good humored\r\nraillery and natural fun running throughout them, which, joined to a\r\ntotal absence of book-making, carries one pleasantly on: to these are\r\nadded good faith and earnestness of purpose, that command respect. It is\r\nalways a pleasant surprise, as Pascal truly said, to find a man where\r\none expected to meet with an author; and M. Huc not only appears a very\r\ngood man, but shows himself a very clever one. The countries he has\r\nvisited are comparatively unknown, but are daily becoming more important\r\nto us. Recent events have brought China within the sphere of our\r\ninterests, political and commercial; and her policy towards her Tartar\r\ndependencies, and the nominally independent state of Thibet, are\r\nbeginning to excite attention in this part of the world. Those who have\r\nstudied the subject, will be deeply interested by M. Huc's narrative;\r\nand the general reader must be amused by his graphic account of one of\r\nthe most arduous journeys ever effected. A few words will explain under\r\nwhat circumstances it was undertaken.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the present century, the French missionary\r\nestablishment at Pekin, which had been at one time so flourishing, was\r\nalmost destroyed by successive persecutions, and the scattered members\r\nof the little church, which had been founded at the cost of so many\r\nperils, had taken refuge beyond the Great Wall, in the deserts of\r\nMongolia. There they contrived to live on the patches of land which the\r\nTartars allowed them to cultivate; and a few priests of the Lazarist\r\norder were appointed to keep up the faith of the dispersed flock. MM.\r\nHuc and Gabet were, in 1842, employed in visiting these Chinese\r\nChristians, settled in Mongolia; and the acquaintance formed during\r\nthese visits with the wandering Tartar tribes inspired them with a great\r\ndesire to convert them to Christianity. Indeed, throughout these volumes\r\nwe trace an evident partiality to the Tartars as compared with the\r\nChinese; and they furnish a fresh instance of the invariable absence of\r\ncongeniality between Europeans of all nations and the natives of the\r\nCelestial Empire.\r\n\r\nThe missionaries were hard at work, studying the dialects of Tartary,\r\nwhen a circumstance occurred which gave their plans of proselytism a\r\nmore definite shape. The Papal See, with that magnificent contempt for\r\nthe realities of dominion which has ever distinguished it, and in\r\nvirtue, we suppose, of that undefined tenth point of the law which is\r\nnot involved in the word possession, appointed a Vicar Apostolic of\r\nMongolia. The pope might, with equal impunity, have divided it into\r\nbishoprics--no meetings would have been hold to protest against the\r\nusurpation; and the mandarins of Pekin would certainly have proposed no\r\nlaw to prevent the Lamas of the western world from assuming what titles\r\nthey pleased. But even in that case, the interests of the church would\r\nnot have been much forwarded. The very extent and limits of the\r\nvicariate were, as yet, unknown; and MM. Huc and Gabet were, to their\r\ngreat satisfaction, appointed, in the year 1844, to ascertain these\r\nfirst essential points.\r\n\r\nThe undertaking was one of no common difficulty: the country they had to\r\ntraverse was untrodden even by the feet of former missionaries,\r\ninhabited by wild, roving tribes, beggared by Chinese extortions,\r\nrendered barren by long misgovernment, and lastly, infested in many\r\nparts by bands of armed robbers. These latter are, it is true, far\r\ndifferent, in manner at least, from what their name would lead most of\r\nour readers to expect, and exercise their uncourteous trade with the\r\nutmost urbanity:\r\n\r\n     They do not rudely clap a pistol to your head, and uncivilly\r\n     demand your money, or your life; they present themselves\r\n     humbly, and say: \"Good elder brother, I am weary of walking;\r\n     please to lend me thy horse?... I am without money; be so good\r\n     as to lend me thy purse?... It is very cold to-day; wilt thou\r\n     give me thy coat?\" If the old elder brother is charitable\r\n     enough to lend all this, he receives in return a \"thank you,\r\n     brother;\" if not, the humble request is immediately supported\r\n     by a few blows; if that does not suffice, the sabre is brought\r\n     into play.\r\n\r\nThe preparations for the journey were admirably simple--a single\r\nattendant and a dog formed the escort; a tent, an iron kettle, a few\r\ncups, and sheep-skins, completed the baggage. There were, however, other\r\nprecautions taken prior to departure, highly characteristic of the\r\nchurch to which our travellers belonged, and which may serve to explain\r\nthe comparative success that, in the East, has generally attended the\r\nefforts of its missionaries.\r\n\r\nSir James Emerson Tennent, in his work on Ceylon, has given a curious\r\naccount of the compliance of the Jesuit missionaries with the customs\r\nand external rites of the people they sought to convert, as opposed to\r\nthe rigid discipline and unbending orthodoxy of their Dutch successors,\r\nwho would not stoop, and who, perhaps, on that account, did not conquer.\r\nOur Lazarists, though not practising, in all its latitude, the Jesuit\r\ndoctrine, were nevertheless determined that nothing in the outward man\r\nshould repel the sympathy of those whom they sought to persuade. On the\r\nfrontiers of Mongolia, the Chinese dress, which they had hitherto worn,\r\nwas laid aside; the long tress of hair, that had been cherished since\r\nthey left France, was pitilessly sacrificed, to the infinite despair of\r\ntheir Chinese congregation; and they assumed the habit generally worn by\r\nthe Lamas, or priests of Thibet. In the opinion of the Tartars, Lamas\r\nare alone privileged to speak on religious matters; and a layman, or\r\n\"black man\"[13] (to use their own expression), who should presume to\r\nconverse on things spiritual, would excite laughter and contempt. It\r\nwas, therefore, good policy to adopt a dress which insured the respect\r\nand attention of their hearers. The costume was one which would have\r\nbeen rather startling to a priest who, without transition should have\r\nexchanged for it the black _soutaine_ of the Romish church. It consisted\r\nin a yellow robe, fastened on one side with five gilt buttons and\r\nconfined at the waist by a long red sash, a red jacket with a violet\r\ncollar, and a yellow cap with red tuft. Nor was this all. The same\r\nconciliatory spirit which had dictated the change of costume, presided\r\nover the whole conduct of the travellers; and we find them heroically\r\ndeclining the hot wine offered by their Chinese host of the frontier\r\ninn, saying, good humoredly, that good Lamas must abstain from wine and\r\ntobacco.\r\n\r\nWe dwell purposely on these details, because they show the spirit in\r\nwhich the journey was undertaken, and explain the confidence with which\r\nthe travellers were received beneath the Mogul tents, and initiated into\r\nall the details of life in the wilderness. We find them associating\r\nwithout repugnance with the Tsao-Ta-Dze, or stinking Tartars (so called\r\nby the Chinese, who are themselves far from irreproachable on the score\r\nof cleanliness), purchasing second-hand clothes well besmeared with\r\nmutton fat, and enjoying their Tartar tea as though it had been the\r\n_café au lait_ of their native land. This tea, by the bye, deserves a\r\nfew words of notice. It differs materially from the tea of the Chinese;\r\nfor whereas the latter use only the young and tender leaves of the\r\nplant, the Tartar tea is composed of the coarse leaves, and even some of\r\nthe branches, which are pressed into moulds of about the size and\r\nthickness of a brick. When it is to be used, a piece of the brick is\r\nbroken off, pulverized, and boiled, a handful of salt is then thrown in,\r\nand the liquid continues to boil until it is almost black; the mixture\r\nis then poured into a large vessel, and invariably offered to every\r\nguest on his arrival. The Russians also consume a large quantity of this\r\narticle, and in the north of Tartary it serves as the only medium of\r\nexchange. A house, a camel, or a horse, is sold for so many teas--five\r\nteas being worth an ounce of silver.\r\n\r\nLife in the desert is monotonous enough; and yet, though half of the\r\nfirst volume is devoted to the pilgrimage through the plains of\r\nMongolia, the interest never flags. The little incidents of travel are\r\ntold good-humoredly, and sometimes are most amusing. Let us take, for\r\ninstance, the following account given by a Tartar hero of the war\r\nagainst the English. The narrator was a native of the Tchakar country,\r\nand had with his countrymen been called out to march against the \"rebels\r\nof the south\"--as the Tartars usually call us. The Tchakar (literally\r\nborder-country) is, in fact, an immense camp, of which all the\r\ninhabitants are bound to military service, and are divided into\r\ndifferent tribes, or \"banners.\" The pastures of the Tchakar serve to\r\nfeed the innumerable flocks of the Emperor of China, and the natives are\r\nalmost exclusively employed in tending them. They are not allowed to\r\ncultivate the soil, or to sell any portion of it to their Chinese\r\nneighbors. As may be imagined, these shepherd-soldiers are only called\r\nupon on great occasions, but they are then supposed to be irresistible.\r\n\r\n     \"So you were engaged in that famous war of the south! How could\r\n     you shepherds have the courage of soldiers? Accustomed to a\r\n     peaceful life, you are strangers to that rude trade, which\r\n     consists in killing, or being killed.\" \"Yes, we are shepherds,\r\n     it is true; but we do not forget that we are soldiers also, and\r\n     that the eight banners compose the body of reserve of the\r\n     \"Great Master\" (the Emperor). You know the rules of the Empire.\r\n     When the enemy appears, the militia of the Kitat (Chinese) is\r\n     first sent; then the banners of the Solon district are brought\r\n     forward; if the war is not ended, then a signal is made to the\r\n     banners of Tchakar; and the very sound of their steps is always\r\n     sufficient to reduce the rebels to order.\"... \"Did you\r\n     fight?--did you see the enemy?\" inquired Samdadchiemba. \"No,\r\n     they dared not make their appearance. The Kitat kept on saying\r\n     that we were marching to certain and needless death. What can\r\n     you do, they said, against sea-monsters? They live in the\r\n     water, like fishes; and when one least expects it, they rise to\r\n     the surface, and throw their inflamed Si-Koua.[14] As soon as\r\n     one makes ready to shoot one's arrows at them, they plunge back\r\n     into the water like frogs! Thus, they sought to frighten us;\r\n     but we, the soldiers of the eight banners, were not afraid.\r\n     Before we set out, the chief Lamas had opened the book of\r\n     celestial secrets, and had assured us that the affair would\r\n     have a happy issue. The Emperor had given to each Tchouanda, a\r\n     Lama learned in medicine, and initiated into the holy\r\n     mysteries, who was to cure us of all the diseases of the\r\n     climate, and protect us against the magic of the sea-monsters.\r\n     What had we then to fear? The rebels having heard that the\r\n     invincible militia of the Tchakar was approaching, trembled,\r\n     and sued for peace. The \"Holy Master,\" in his infinite mercy\r\n     granted their prayer; and we were permitted to return to our\r\n     pastures and the care of our flocks.\"\r\n\r\nBut such meetings were rare, and in general, a passing salutation in the\r\nmetaphorical style of the East, was all that was exchanged with\r\nfellow-travellers. It would seem, however, that a desert life has charms\r\nwhich we, poor slaves of civilization, can scarcely appreciate, but\r\nwhich never fail to captivate after a short experience. Would any of our\r\nreaders have fancied, for instance, that a search after _argols_ could\r\nbe an exciting employment? _Argol_, let it be understood, is a rather\r\npretty Tartar word for a very ugly thing, which can scarcely be\r\ngracefully described. It means, in fact, the dung of the innumerable\r\nanimals that feed in the plains of Tartary, and which, in a dry state,\r\nis carefully collected by the natives, and is their only fuel. No\r\nargols, no breakfast; and in consequence, M. Huc tells us that the first\r\ncare of M. Gabet and himself, in the morning, after devoting a short\r\ntime to prayer, was to seek after argols--with what zest our readers\r\nshall see:\r\n\r\n     The occupation that followed these meditations, was certainly\r\n     not of a mystical character; it was, however, a most necessary\r\n     one, and not without its attractions. Each of us threw a bag\r\n     over his shoulder, and set out in different directions in quest\r\n     of argols. Those who have never led a roving life will scarcely\r\n     believe that such an occupation can be productive of enjoyment;\r\n     and yet, when one of us had the good fortune to discover,\r\n     hidden among the grass, an argol remarkable for its size and\r\n     siccity, he felt at his heart a thrill of pleasure, a sudden\r\n     emotion, that gave a moment's happiness. The delight caused by\r\n     the discovery of a fine argol may be compared to that of a\r\n     sportsman finding the trace of his game--of a child\r\n     contemplating the long sought for bird's nest--of an angler,\r\n     who sees a fish quivering at the end of his line; or, if we may\r\n     be allowed to liken great things to small, we would compare it\r\n     to the enthusiasm of a Leverrier finding a planet at the tip of\r\n     his pen.\r\n\r\nWe are not at liberty, unfortunately, to dwell as we would on these\r\ndetails of Tartar life, however humorously related, for we must reserve\r\nspace for those descriptions of Buddhistic customs in which the chief\r\ninterest of these volumes consists. It suffices to say that, during the\r\neighteen months of incredible fatigue and privations, which elapsed\r\nbefore the travellers reached Lha-Ssa, their courage never flagged, nor\r\ndid their good-humored and hopeful resignation ever forsake them. Every\r\nmorning the tent was struck, and the encampment of the previous night,\r\nhowever well situated, abandoned without regret. Indeed, as long as the\r\nmissionaries remained in the plains of Mongolia, surrounded by friendly\r\ntribes, they seem, to a certain degree, to have enjoyed this roving\r\nlife. On one occasion, after an unusually protracted stay of two days,\r\nM. Huc writes:\r\n\r\n     We quitted this encampment without regret, as we had left the\r\n     others, with this difference, that in the spot where we had\r\n     spread our tent, there was a greater quantity of ashes than\r\n     usual, and that the surrounding grass was more trodden down.\r\n\r\nThis is the true spirit for Tartar travelling, which it is not given to\r\nevery one to possess in the same degree. In the choice of their\r\nattendant, too, the missionaries appear to have been fortunate. \"On the\r\ncountenance of Samdadchiemba,\" says M. Huc, \"one could not trace the sly\r\ncunning of the Chinese, nor the good-natured frankness of the Tartar,\r\nnor the courageous energy of the native of Thibet, but there was a\r\nmixture of all three. He was a Dchiahour.\" His countenance appears to\r\nhave been a faithful index to his character. Such as he was,\r\nSamdadchiemba is what would be termed, in a work of fiction, an\r\nexcellent character. In this truthful narrative, he forms an admirable\r\nportrait. He was a convert of M. Gabet, and had imbibed a sort of hazy\r\nnotion of Christianity, which was often curiously mingled with\r\nreminiscences of his early creed. Strange scruples would sometimes\r\nassail him; as on one occasion, when his \"spiritual fathers\" had, to\r\ntheir great satisfaction, succeeded in getting some fish:\r\n\r\n     We took the fishes, and went to the edge of the little lake\r\n     that lay close to our tent. We were no sooner there, than we\r\n     saw Samdadchiemba running towards us in great haste. He quickly\r\n     untied the handkerchief that held the fish. \"What are you going\r\n     to do?\" he inquired, anxiously. \"We are going to scale and\r\n     clean the fish.\" \"Oh! take care, my spiritual fathers; wait a\r\n     little--we must not commit sin.\" \"Who is committing sin?\" \"Look\r\n     at the fish--see, many are still moving; you must let them die\r\n     quietly. Is it not a sin to kill any living thing?\" \"Go and\r\n     bake your bread,\" we replied, \"and leave us alone. Have you not\r\n     got rid of your ideas of metempsychosis yet, eh? Do you still\r\n     believe that men are turned into beasts, and beasts into men?\"\r\n     The features of our Dchiahour relaxed into a broad grin.\r\n     \"_Ho-le! Ho-le!_\" said he, slapping his forehead; \"what a\r\n     blockhead I am--what was I thinking about? I had forgotten the\r\n     doctrine,\"... and he turned off quite abashed at having given\r\n     his ridiculous warning. The fish was fried in mutton fat, and\r\n     proved excellent.\r\n\r\nWe hope we shall not be accused of Buddhistic tendencies if we say that\r\nthere appears to us something more amiable in the Dchiahour's misgivings\r\nthan in the unpitying orthodoxy of his spiritual fathers. Be that as it\r\nmay, the anecdote shows that the practices of a religion will often\r\ncling to a man long after its tenets appear to have been totally\r\neradicated from his mind. We must add, however, that when the day of\r\ntrial came, Samdadchiemba boldly confessed his faith as a Christian, and\r\neven stood a very fair chance of becoming a martyr, in spite of his\r\nbackslidings, on the subject of metempsychosis. Well might the\r\nmissionaries value their neophyte, for (with one doubtful exception) no\r\nnew convert was added to their church during their long and perilous\r\njourney. Although hospitably, and even courteously received every\r\nwhere--under the humblest Mogul tent and in the wealthiest\r\nLama-houses--though listened to with deference as men of prayer and\r\npiety by every class of Tartars, (perhaps of all nations the most\r\ninclined to religious feelings,) they made no proselytes. After reading\r\ntheir own account of their efforts, one remains convinced of the\r\ndifficulties which must stand in the way of conversions from Buddhism.\r\nIdolatry, as it is represented in story books for children, under its\r\ngrossest form of fetichism, may be easily conquered, but the vast spirit\r\nof Pantheism is more difficult to grapple with. That Buddhism, as\r\nunderstood by the more enlightened Lamas, is Pantheism, there can be no\r\ndoubt. All created beings emanate from, and return to, Buddha--the one\r\neternal and universal soul--the principle and end of all things, and of\r\nwhom all things are the partial and temporary manifestations. All\r\nanimated beings are divided into classes, that have each of them in\r\ntheir power the means of sanctification, so as to obtain, after death,\r\ntransmigration into a higher class, until, at last, they enjoy plenitude\r\nof being by absorption into the eternal soul of Buddha. This doctrine,\r\nsimple enough when explained by the superior class of Buddhists, is\r\noverlaid with superstitions for the vulgar; and it is this double\r\ncharacter of Buddhism, varying according to the mind of the believer,\r\nthat, in our opinion, constitutes the great difficulty in the path of\r\nproselytism. Every Buddhist is provided for the defence of his faith\r\nwith the very armor best fitted to protect him in his particular social\r\nand intellectual sphere. The enlightened Lamas of Thibet take refuge in\r\nthe vastness and antiquity of their system, which we ought, perhaps,\r\nrather to term a philosophy than a religion. Their comprehensive creed\r\ncan tolerate all others which appear but as subdivisions of\r\nitself--partial and limited views of the great universal law, of which\r\nit has been given to them alone to embrace the whole. They boast with\r\nreason that no precepts, not even those of the Gospel, are more noble;\r\nno practices more tolerant than those of Buddhism. Even the doctrine of\r\nequality among men, which has rendered Christianity so attractive to the\r\noppressed of all other creeds, was preached by Buddhists centuries\r\nbefore our era. The belief in the progressive enlightenment of mankind,\r\nand the perfectibility of our nature, which are the very essence of\r\nBuddhism, has seduced many philosophical minds in all ages and in all\r\ncountries, and will not easily be abandoned by the Lamas--the dispensers\r\nof knowledge, whose mission is that of teachers--for the levelling\r\ndoctrine of original sin. On the other hand, in Mongolia and Tartary,\r\namong a more ignorant race, MM. Huc and Gabet had to cope with another\r\nsort of opposition. The lower orders of Buddhists know nothing of the\r\nabstract doctrine, but are hedged in by petty customs and daily\r\nobservances, which are the most powerful defence for narrow minds. In\r\nvain did the missionaries endeavor to gain an insight into the creed of\r\nthese simple tribes, who believed firmly they knew not exactly what.\r\nWhen questioned on this subject, they would refer the inquirer to the\r\nLamas, who in their turn would avow their ignorance as compared to the\r\n\"saints.\" All agreed in one point, that the doctrine came from the West,\r\nand that there alone it would be found pure and undefiled.\r\n\r\n     When we had expounded to them the truths of Christianity, they\r\n     never argued with us, but merely answered with great coolness,\r\n     \"We have not all the prayers here. The Lamas of the West will\r\n     explain all--will account for every thing; we believe in the\r\n     traditions from the West.\" These expressions only served to\r\n     corroborate a remark we had had occasion to make during our\r\n     journey through Tartary; namely, that there is not a single\r\n     Lama-house of any importance, of which the chief Lama does not\r\n     come from Thibet. A Lama who has travelled to Lha-Ssa is sure\r\n     on his return to obtain the confidence of every Tartar. He is\r\n     considered as a superior being--a seer, before whose eyes the\r\n     mysteries of lives past and to come have been unveiled in the\r\n     very heart of the \"eternal sanctuary\" in the \"land of\r\n     spirits.\"[15]\r\n\r\nIt appears just possible to us, that this obscurity in speaking of\r\nthings spiritual, which, after all, can at best be seen but as through a\r\nglass darkly, is not so peculiar to Buddhism as M. Huc and his companion\r\nsuppose; and that the dogmas of any religion are more difficult of\r\ncomprehension to minds who have not been prepared from infancy for their\r\nreception than is generally imagined. When we are told, for instance, by\r\nour author, that in a \"few plain words\" he exposed the doctrines of his\r\nchurch, we confess that we have our doubts as to any lucidity of\r\nexpression being sufficient to convey to untrained hearers a clear idea\r\nof the doctrine of transubstantiation among others.\r\n\r\nBe that as it may, westward our travellers determined to bend their\r\nsteps, in search of knowledge at the fountain-head; resolved to visit\r\nThibet, and to attack Buddhism in its very stronghold, Lha-Ssa. To this\r\nchange in their original plan, we owe the most interesting portion of\r\nthese travels. Although they made no secret of their intentions of\r\nproselytism, they were received in all the Lama-houses as\r\nfellow-laborers in the field of religious instruction, and as such\r\nbecame initiated into all the habits of Lamanist life. One cannot help\r\nreflecting how different would be the reception of Lamas, who should\r\nvisit Rome, with the avowed purpose of converting the subjects of His\r\nHoliness to Buddhism. The details given by M. Huc on Lamanism in general\r\nare more complete than any we remember to have read, and are given with\r\na natural piquancy rarely to be met with in writers on such grave\r\nsubjects.\r\n\r\nTartary is, perhaps, of all the countries in the world, the most\r\npriest-ridden; the Lamas forming, it is said, one-third of the entire\r\npopulation. In most families, with the exception of the eldest son, who\r\nremains \"a black man,\" all the sons are Lamas. Their future destiny is\r\ndecided from the very cradle, by the fact of their parents causing their\r\nheads to be shaved. As they are vowed to celibacy, it is probable that\r\nChinese policy has favored the natural bias of the people towards a\r\nreligious life, in order to arrest the progress of population. Certain\r\nit is, that while the government of Pekin suffers its own bonzes and\r\npriests to remain in the most abject condition, it has always honored\r\nand encouraged Lamaism in Tartary and Thibet. The remembrance of the\r\nexploits of their ancestors is not yet extinct beneath the tents of the\r\nMoguls, and legends of conquest and traditions of empire still serve to\r\nwile away the long leisure hours of their roving life. Notwithstanding\r\ntwo centuries of peace, and the enervating influence of Chinese\r\nmisgovernment, if an appeal were made to Tartar fanaticism, hordes might\r\nyet pour down from the vast country, extending from the frontiers of\r\nSiberia to the farthest limits of Thibet, which would make the Celestial\r\nEmperor tremble on his throne in Pekin. The spread of Lamaism is the\r\nbest safeguard against such a contingency, and the empty honors paid by\r\nthe sceptic and worldly Chinese to the different Grand Lamas, have no\r\nother motive than a desire to appease the susceptibility of the Tartar\r\ntribes. The Lamas are divided into three classes: those that remain\r\nunder the tent, and whose mode of life differs little from that of the\r\nother members of their family; the travelling Lamas--a migratory kind of\r\nanimals--who, with staff in hand, and wallet at their backs, wander from\r\nplace to place, trusting to Tartar hospitality for their maintenance;\r\nand lastly, the Lamas who live in communities, or convents, and devote\r\nthemselves more especially to study and prayer. Most of the Lama-houses\r\nenjoy large revenues, the result of imperial foundations, or the\r\nliberality of native princes. These are distributed at certain periods\r\namong the Lamas, according to their rank in the hierarchy. Some\r\nreligious communities, or aggregations of Lama-houses, such as that of\r\nGrand Kouren, number 30,000 Lamas, and its head, the Guison-Tomba, is\r\npowerful enough to give umbrage to the Chinese Emperor himself. But the\r\nchief of the humblest Lama-house may be an important personage, if he\r\nhappen to be a Chaberon, that is to say, an incarnation of Buddha--one\r\nwhose death is but a transformation. The Buddhists firmly believe in\r\nthese transmigrations of their living Buddhas, and the ceremonies which\r\nattend the election--we ought to say the recognition--of these undying\r\nsovereigns, are curiously related by M. Huc.\r\n\r\n     When a Grand Lama takes his departure, that is to say when he\r\n     dies, the event is no subject for mourning to the community.\r\n     There is no giving way to tears or regrets, for every one is\r\n     convinced that the Chaberon will soon reappear. His apparent\r\n     death is only the beginning of a new existence--a link added to\r\n     an endless and uninterrupted chain of successive lives--a mere\r\n     palingenesia. So long as the saint remains in the chrysalis\r\n     state, his disciples are in the greatest anxiety, for their\r\n     great affair is to find out in what spot their master is to\r\n     resume his life. If a rainbow appears in the clouds, it is\r\n     considered as a token sent them by their former Grand Lama, to\r\n     aid them in their researches. Every one then falls to praying,\r\n     and while the community, thus bereaved of its Lama, redoubles\r\n     its feasts and orisons, a chosen band sets out to consult the\r\n     _Tchurtchun_, or soothsayer, versed in the knowledge of all\r\n     things hidden from ordinary men. He is informed that on such a\r\n     day of such a month, the rainbow of the Chaberon was seen in\r\n     the heavens; that it appeared in a certain direction; was more\r\n     or less luminous; was visible during a certain lapse of time,\r\n     and then disappeared under such and such circumstances. When\r\n     the _Tchurtchun_ has obtained all the necessary information, he\r\n     recites a few prayers, opens his book of divination, and\r\n     finally pronounces his oracle, while the Tartars, who have come\r\n     to consult him, listen to his words, kneeling, and rapt in\r\n     profound devotion. Your Grand Lama, he says, is come to life\r\n     again, in Thibet, at such a distance from your house; you will\r\n     find him in such a family. When the poor creatures have heard\r\n     the oracle, they return rejoicing, to announce the good tidings\r\n     at the Lama-house.\r\n\r\n     It frequently occurs that the disciples of the defunct Lama\r\n     have no need to take all this trouble to discover his new\r\n     birthplace. He often condescends so far as to reveal, in\r\n     person, the secret of his transformation. As soon as he has\r\n     performed his metamorphosis in Thibet, he declares himself at\r\n     his birthplace, at an age at which ordinary children cannot\r\n     articulate a word. \"I,\" he says, with a tone of authority, \"am\r\n     the Grand Lama, the living Buddha of such a temple; let me be\r\n     conducted to the Lama-house, of which I am the immortal\r\n     superior.\"...\r\n\r\n     The Tartars are always delighted at the discovery of their\r\n     Grand Lama, by whatever means it may be effected. Preparations\r\n     are joyfully made for the journey; the ministers and some\r\n     members of the royal family join the caravan, which is to bring\r\n     back the saint in triumph. High and low contribute to the\r\n     expense, and are eager to share the dangers of the journey.\r\n     These are not in general trifling; for the Lama is frequently\r\n     inconsiderate enough towards his followers to transmigrate in a\r\n     part of the country at once distant and difficult of access. If\r\n     one expedition fails, or falls into the hands of robbers,\r\n     another is sent, and there is no instance of these devotees\r\n     faltering in their faith. When at last the Chaberon is\r\n     discovered, it must not be supposed that he is accepted and\r\n     proclaimed at once, without proper precautions being taken to\r\n     ascertain his identity. A solemn sitting is held, at which the\r\n     living Buddha is examined in public, with the most scrupulous\r\n     attention. He is questioned as to the name of the Lama-house of\r\n     which he pretends to be the chief, its distance and situation,\r\n     and the number of its resident Lamas. He is moreover\r\n     interrogated concerning the habits of the defunct Grand Lama,\r\n     and the principal particulars of his death. After all these\r\n     questions, prayer-books, tea-pots, cups, utensils, and things\r\n     of all kinds, are placed before him, and he is expected to\r\n     designate those which belonged to him during his preceding\r\n     life.\r\n\r\n     In general, the child, who is rarely more than five or six\r\n     years old, comes out triumphant from all these trials; replies\r\n     correctly to all the questions that are put to him; and makes,\r\n     without hesitation, the inventory of his former furniture.\r\n     \"This,\" he says, \"is the prayer-book I was in the habit of\r\n     using; here is the painted cup in which I used to drink tea,\"\r\n     and so on through the whole list.\r\n\r\n     The Tartars are, undoubtedly, often the dupes of those who are\r\n     interested in making a Grand Lama of the brat. We think,\r\n     however, that often the affair is conducted on both sides with\r\n     perfect simplicity and good faith. From all we gathered from\r\n     persons most worthy of belief, it appears certain that the\r\n     wonders related of the Chaberons cannot be attributed to\r\n     juggling or delusion. A purely human philosophy would,\r\n     doubtless, reject such facts, or unhesitatingly lay them to the\r\n     charge of Lamaist imposture. We--catholic missionaries--think\r\n     that the great liar who deceived our first parents in Paradise,\r\n     prosecutes on earth his system of falsehood. He who was potent\r\n     enough to sustain Simon Magus in the air, may well speak in the\r\n     present day by the mouth of a child, in order to confirm the\r\n     belief of his worshippers.\r\n\r\nAs our duties are those of the critic, and not those of the inquisitor,\r\nwe will not stop to inquire how far the slightly Manichean doctrine\r\nimplied in the concluding remark of M. Huc is received as orthodox by\r\nthe Gallican Church; but, as a general observation, we may say, that\r\nthere seems no reason why, with such a method of accounting for\r\nmiracles, any should be disbelieved; nor do we understand how, under\r\nthis system, any miracles can be adduced as a proof of the truth of any\r\nreligion. Surely, since the days of the Scribes and Pharisees, no enemy\r\nof Christianity ever attacked it more radically than by attributing the\r\npower of miracles to Beelzebub, the prince of the devils! M. Huc reminds\r\nus of a preacher whom we once heard, in an enlightened capital,\r\nexplaining the miracle of speech in Balaam's ass, by reminding his\r\ncongregation that parrots--nay, even bull-finches, have been made to\r\nspeak, and therefore why not an ass? It never occurred to him, that in\r\nthe impossibility of the thing the miracle consisted. There is a little\r\nof the same kind of oversight in the explanations of our missionaries.\r\nThey are, however, too earnest and single-hearted in their credulity to\r\nbe laughed at; and, on other occasions, when their powers of belief were\r\nstill further tested, they displayed a courageous resolution which\r\ndisarms ridicule, and is not the less admirable because shown on an\r\nabsurd occasion. Among the inferior class of Lamas there are many who\r\npretend to possess preternatural gifts, which are exorcised publicly on\r\nsolemn occasions, and greatly increase the fame of the saint who\r\nexhibits them, and the revenues of the community of which he is a\r\nmember. M. Huc and his companion being in the neighborhood of a large\r\nLama-house, heard that one of these festivals was to be held, at which a\r\nLama was to perform the unpleasant but wonderful feat of disembowelling\r\nhimself for the gratification of the public, and after remaining in that\r\nstate for a certain time, during which he would answer any questions\r\nrespecting futurity, he would replace things in _statu quo_ by means of\r\na short prayer. According to their views of such matters, this could, of\r\ncourse, be easily effected by the agency of the Evil One, and they were\r\nconfirmed in the idea by the wording of an invocation used on similar\r\noccasions, and which certainly appears to indicate some infernal\r\nbargain. Instead, therefore, of suspecting trickery, they only\r\nconsidered how they could best prove the superiority of prayer over\r\nincantations, and neutralize the power of the devil. They determined to\r\nbe present at the ceremony, and, in the midst of the diabolical\r\ninvocation, to stand forward, and in the name of the true God to arrest\r\nthe charm. An unforeseen accident fortunately prevented their reaching\r\nthe scene of action in time, or it is very possible that their journey\r\nmight have terminated then and there in martyrdom, in spite of\r\nBuddhistic toleration. Faith and courage are, however, no subjects for\r\nsarcasm, wherever they may be exhibited, and it seems to us that there\r\nwas a good deal of both in the above plan.\r\n\r\nOur readers will see that these volumes are interesting, not only by the\r\nfacts they contain, but also from the peculiar manner in which the\r\nwriter judges them. Not the least amusing feature in the case is, that\r\nwe find him continually noting as absurd Buddhistic abuses many customs\r\nwhich are common to his own Church. On the very outset of their journey,\r\nthe missionaries took advantage of their stay at Tolon-Noor, a town\r\nfamous for its foundries, to have a large crucifix cast. M. Huc mentions\r\nthat the large statues of Buddha almost all come from thence, but these\r\nhe calls idols, whereas the crucifix was an image. The pilgrimages,\r\ngenuflexions, and vows of the Buddhist devotees surprise him, as though\r\nthere were no steps at Rome worn bare by thousands of knees--no shrines\r\nin France visited by bare-footed pilgrims--no children dressed in white\r\nfrom their birth to please the Virgin Mary! In one description of a Lama\r\nseminary, he remarks that the canonical books of Buddhism being all\r\nwritten in the language of Thibet, the Lamas of Mongolia pass their\r\nlives in studying their religion in a foreign idiom, while they scarcely\r\nknow their own language. Let us see what improvement the introduction of\r\nCatholicism would effect, in this state of things. We open a recent\r\nwork[16] on French missions in Cochin-China and Corea; and in a\r\ndescription of the Catholic seminary of Pulo-Ticoux, near Pinang, we\r\nread: \"Both teachers and pupils speak only Latin in their class--not the\r\nbarbarous Latin of our schools, but a pure, harmonious tongue, such as I\r\nnever heard spoken before. With the exception of a few elementary\r\nnotions of geography, modern history, and arithmetic, the children\r\nreceive an exclusively religious education.\" There is one invention,\r\nhowever, in which Buddhism has no rival, and which throws the Roman\r\nCatholic idea of praying by proxy quite into shade. We never heard of a\r\nprayer-mill before. A piece of pasteboard, of a cylindrical form, is\r\ncovered with prayers of the most approved sort; once set in motion, this\r\nmachine will turn for a long while, and so long as it does turn, the\r\nprayers inscribed on it are placed to the credit of the person who first\r\nset it going. Sometimes these mills are set up in a stream, and pray\r\neverlastingly for their founders.\r\n\r\nWe must now hurry on to Lha-Ssa, foregoing many tempting pictures of\r\nChinese life which occur by the way, for our travellers were obliged to\r\npass on Chinese territory before reaching their destination. A Chinese\r\nlandlord is a curious character, as curious often as the sign of his own\r\ninn; and whether he lodged at the \"Hotel of Justice and Mercy,\" or at\r\nthat of the \"Three Perfections,\" or the \"Five Felicities,\" or put up at\r\nthe \"Temperate Climate\" inn, M. Huc finds matter for amusing\r\ndescription. On these occasions the great fear of the missionaries was,\r\nthat they should be taken for English, seeing that these latter were not\r\nin favor just then:\r\n\r\n     At Tchoang-Long we lodged at the hotel of the \"Three Social\r\n     Relations,\" where we had the pleasantest landlord imaginable to\r\n     deal with. He was a true Chinese: and, to give us a proof of\r\n     his perspicacity, asked us point blank if we were not\r\n     English--adding, to make the question clearer, that he meant by\r\n     Ing-kie-li, the sea-devils (Yang-koueï-Dze,) who were making\r\n     war at Canton. \"No, we are not English, and we are neither sea\r\n     nor land-devils, nor devils of any sort.\" A lounger who stood\r\n     by luckily counteracted the bad effect of the interpellation.\r\n     \"Why,\" said he to the innkeeper, \"don't you know how to look at\r\n     men's faces? How can you fancy that these men can be\r\n     Yang-koueï-Dze? Don't you know that their eyes are always blue,\r\n     and their hair quite red?\" \"True,\" said the innkeeper, \"I had\r\n     not thought of that.\" \"No, indeed,\" we added; \"you cannot have\r\n     reflected. Do you think that sea-monsters could live on land,\r\n     and ride on horseback, as we do?\" \"True, true, the Ing-kie-li,\r\n     it is said, never dare to leave the sea: as soon as they come\r\n     ashore, they tremble, and die, like fish out of water.\" A great\r\n     deal more was said of the manners and customs of the\r\n     sea-monsters--the result of which was, that we could not\r\n     possibly be of the same race.\r\n\r\nIn the beginning of 1846, after incredible trials and fatigues, M. Huc\r\nand his companion reached Lha-Ssa, the capital of Thibet--the Rome of\r\nBuddhism. The perils of the road were at an end; but dangers of another\r\nsort were to be expected. It was not to be supposed that the ostensible\r\nobject of their journey--the propagation of a new religion--could fail\r\nto give umbrage to a purely ecclesiastical government, such as that of\r\nthe Talé-Lama. For persecutions they were, therefore, prepared; but\r\ncertainly did not expect it from the quarter in which it was destined to\r\noriginate. Strange to say, the opposition they met with, and which\r\nfinally achieved their expulsion from Thibet, was political, and not\r\nreligious--the result of Chinese susceptibility, rather than of any\r\nreligious hostility. At the period of their arrival at Lha-Ssa, the\r\nChinese resident at the Court of Pekin was no less a personage than the\r\nfamous Ki-Chan (or Keshen, as he is often called by the English)--the\r\nsame who played so conspicuous a part as Imperial Commissary during the\r\nnegotiations with England, in 1839. On that occasion, Ki-Chan showed, in\r\none respect at least, greater discrimination than most of his\r\ncountrymen, for he perceived at once the impossibility of holding out\r\nagainst European forces, and made the best terms he could. The necessity\r\nfor concessions was not, however, so well understood at the court of\r\nPekin. The unfortunate Commissary was accused of having allowed himself\r\nto be corrupted by English gold, and to have sold a portion of the\r\nCelestial territory to the sea-devils. He was, in consequence, declared\r\n\"worthy of death,\" deprived of his titles, goods, and honors, and sent\r\ninto exile in Tartary: his houses were razed to the ground, and his\r\nwives put up to auction! But Fortune and the emperors of China are\r\ncapricious; and events in Thibet having, towards the year 1844, assumed\r\nan aspect which appeared to offer a favorable opportunity of extending\r\nChinese influence in that quarter, the \"Holy Master\" bethought him of\r\nthe talents of his discarded servant, Ki-Chan, and sent him to Lha-Ssa,\r\nwith extraordinary powers. The events we allude to are narrated by M.\r\nHuc with clearness, and, we have reason to believe, with great accuracy;\r\nbut we cannot make room for any account of them, and must content\r\nourselves with a rapid sketch of the ruling powers at Lha-Ssa in 1846,\r\nso as to render the situation of our travellers intelligible.\r\n\r\nThe government of Thibet is a complete theocracy, and the authority of\r\nthe Talé-Lama is unbounded, as that of a divinity deigning to reign on\r\nearth must naturally be over his worshippers. But as he often\r\ntransmigrates into the body of a mere child, and that, moreover, his\r\nvery divinity makes it derogatory in him to meddle with worldly affairs,\r\nhe is supplied with a grosser colleague, who, under the name of\r\nNomekhan, or spiritual emperor, transacts all the business of the state.\r\nHe is nominated for life by the Talé-Lama, and in his turn chooses four\r\nkalons, or ministers, whose power, like that of ministers elsewhere, is\r\nof uncertain duration. At the time we speak of, thanks to Chinese\r\nintrigue, both the Talé-Lama and the Nomekhan were minors; and the\r\nregency was intrusted to the first kalon, or minister, whose\r\none-absorbing object was to endeavor to resist the daily interference\r\nand encroachments of Ki-Chan, and to emancipate Thibet from the\r\noppressive friendship of the court of Pekin. No pope, protected by an\r\narmy of occupation, was ever more hampered. But the Celestial Emperor\r\nhad declared himself the \"protector\" of the Talé-Lama; and as such was\r\nhe not bound to interfere on every occasion where his dignity or\r\ninterests were concerned? The arrival of two Europeans at Lha-Ssa, was a\r\ncircumstance well calculated to excite the suspicions of Ki-Chan, who,\r\nin the true spirit of Chinese policy, considered the total exclusion of\r\nEuropeans as the only safeguard against foreign invasion. In\r\nconsequence, the missionaries had to undergo more than one minute\r\ninterrogatory, and a most searching domiciliary visit. The object of\r\nthis latter seems especially to have been, to ascertain whether they\r\npossessed any maps. Although convicted of having in their possession\r\nseveral of these prohibited articles, they managed, by their guarded\r\nreplies, and a little adroit flattery, to lull the suspicions of the\r\nChinese envoy, and even to obtain the favor of the Regent. This latter,\r\nindeed, repeatedly assured them, with that self-deceit by which the\r\noppressed often seek to delude themselves into a belief of their own\r\nindependence, that they had nothing to fear as long as _he_ supported\r\nthem, for that it was he \"who governed the country.\" For a little while\r\nthings went on smoothly enough: the missionaries followed their religion\r\nopenly, and even worked hard at making converts--not very successfully,\r\nit seems to us; but still, so long as they were allowed to sow, they\r\nmight hope one day to reap. The Regent himself would frequently\r\ndiscourse with them on religious topics:\r\n\r\n     The Regent was fond of talking on religious matters, and they\r\n     formed the principal subject of our conversations with him. In\r\n     the beginning of our intercourse, he said to us the following\r\n     remarkable words: \"All your long journeys have been undertaken\r\n     solely with a religious object.... You are right, for religion\r\n     is the great business of life. I see that the French and the\r\n     people of Thibet think alike in that respect. We are not like\r\n     the Chinese, who take no account of the care of their souls.\r\n     Nevertheless, your religion is not the same as ours.... It is\r\n     of importance to know which is the true one. Let us examine\r\n     both sincerely and attentively; if yours is the best, we will\r\n     adopt it; how could we refuse to do so? If, on the other hand,\r\n     ours is the best, I suppose that you will be rational enough to\r\n     follow it.\"\r\n\r\nOf course, the tolerant Regent thought that he was not promising much;\r\nand, as usual on such occasions, each party made sure of converting the\r\nother. Still, one sees so many people who defend what they are convinced\r\nis the truth with as little temper and good faith as though they were\r\nmaintaining what they know to be a falsehood, that we must allow that he\r\nhad some merit. The controversy then began; the Regent, with great\r\ncourtesy, allowing the Christians, as his guests, to expound their\r\ndoctrine first. But our controversialists soon found out what so many\r\nother disputants would do well to remember--viz., that in order to give\r\nor receive a clear definition, it is essential that both antagonists\r\nshould be agreed as to the value of its terms. The argument was carried\r\non in Chinese, and neither M. Huc nor M. Gabet were sufficiently\r\nconversant with the language to be able to convey metaphysical ideas by\r\nits means. The truth-seeking Regent, therefore, proposed that the\r\ntheological conversations should be suspended until his adversaries\r\nshould have learned the language of Thibet; and he himself furnished\r\nthem with a master.\r\n\r\nKi-Chan, on his part, was equally curious, but on other matters:\r\n\r\n     During the short period of our prosperity at Lha-Ssa, we had\r\n     some familiar intercourse with the Chinese ambassador, Ki-Chan.\r\n     He sent for us two or three times, to talk politics, or to use\r\n     the Chinese expression, to speak \"idle words.\" He talked much\r\n     of the English, and of Queen Victoria. \"It seems,\" said he,\r\n     \"that she is a woman of great understanding; but her husband,\r\n     in my opinion, plays a very foolish part. She does not let him\r\n     meddle with any thing. She has had magnificent gardens laid out\r\n     for him, with fruit-trees and all kinds of flowers; and there\r\n     he is always shut up, and spends his life in walking about....\r\n     They say there are other countries in Europe where women\r\n     govern--is it true? Are their husbands also shut up in gardens?\r\n     Is that, too, the custom in France?\" \"No; in France the women\r\n     are in the gardens, and the men direct public affairs.\" \"That's\r\n     right--any other plan produces disorder.\"...\r\n\r\n     Ki-Chan then inquired after Palmerston, and asked if he was\r\n     still intrusted with foreign affairs?... \"And Ilu,[17] what has\r\n     become of him--do you know?\" \"He has been recalled; your fall\r\n     caused his.\" \"I am sorry for it. He had an excellent heart, but\r\n     he knew not how to take a resolution. Has he been put to death,\r\n     or exiled?\" \"Neither; in Europe we do not make such short work\r\n     of these things as at Pekin.\" \"True, true; your Mandarins are\r\n     much better off than we are. Your government is much better\r\n     than ours: our Emperor cannot know every thing, and yet he\r\n     judges every thing, and no one may find fault with his acts.\r\n     Our Emperor says to us, This is white.... We fall down and\r\n     answer, Yes, this is white. He then shows us the same object,\r\n     and says, This is black.... We fall down and answer, Yes, this\r\n     is black.\" \"But, after all, suppose you were to say that the\r\n     same thing could not be black and white?\" \"The Emperor would,\r\n     perhaps, say to any one courageous enough to do it, Thou art\r\n     right; but at the same time he would have him strangled or\r\n     beheaded.\"... He then added, that for his own part he was\r\n     convinced that the Chinese could never cope with Europeans,\r\n     unless they altered their arms, and changed their old habits;\r\n     but that he would take good care never to say so, seeing that\r\n     the counsel, besides being useless, would probably cost him his\r\n     life.\r\n\r\nAt other times, the whole court would assist at some exhibition of\r\nEuropean wonders:\r\n\r\n     One day when we were speaking of observatories and astronomical\r\n     instruments, the Regent asked us if we would allow him to\r\n     examine the curious, strange-looking machine that we kept in a\r\n     box. He meant the microscope.... One of us ran home, and\r\n     returned with the wonderful instrument. While we were putting\r\n     it together, we attempted to give, as well as we could, some\r\n     notion of optics to our auditory; but as we perceived that the\r\n     theory excited but little interest, we proceeded at once to\r\n     experiments. We asked if any person in the company would favor\r\n     us with a louse. The thing was far easier to obtain than a\r\n     butterfly. A noble Lama, who was secretary to his Excellency\r\n     the first Kalon, had only to slip his hand beneath his silk\r\n     robe to produce a fully developed specimen. We seized it\r\n     immediately with our tweezers; seeing which, the Lama objected\r\n     to the experiment, alleging that we were going to cause the\r\n     death of a living being. \"Never fear,\" we said, \"we have only\r\n     got hold of him by his skin; and besides, he seems sufficiently\r\n     sturdy to get over the trial.\" The Regent, whose creed, as we\r\n     before said, was more spiritualized than that of the vulgar,\r\n     told the Lama to hold his tongue, and let us alone. We\r\n     therefore proceeded with the experiment, and fixed into the\r\n     object-glass the little animal, who was struggling in our\r\n     tweezers. We then requested the Regent to apply his eye to the\r\n     glass at the top of the machine. \"Tsong-Kaba!\" said he; \"the\r\n     louse is as big as a rat.\"... Having viewed it for an instant,\r\n     he hid his face in his hands, saying, that it was a horrible\r\n     sight. He tried to prevent the others from looking, but his\r\n     expostulations were unavailing. Every body in turn bent over\r\n     the microscope, and started back with cries of horror. The\r\n     Secretary-Lama perceiving that his little animal scarcely\r\n     moved, put in a word in its behalf. We raised the tweezers and\r\n     restored the louse to its owner. Alas! the unfortunate victim\r\n     was lifeless. The Regent said, laughingly to his secretary, \"I\r\n     fear your louse is unwell; go and see if you can physic him, or\r\n     he'll never recover.\"\r\n\r\nAll this pleasantness and good fellowship was not to last long, and\r\nlittle more than a month elapsed before the blow came. The suspicions of\r\nKi-Chan had been lulled--not dispelled. It was contrary to the\r\ninvariable policy of the Chinese to brook the presence of strangers, and\r\nespecially of preachers of Christianity, at Lha-Ssa; and the very favor\r\nshown them by the native government was an additional motive for\r\ndesiring their expulsion. One day, the two Frenchmen were summoned to\r\nthe presence of Ki-Chan, who, with the usual forms of Chinese\r\npoliteness, informed them that Thibet was too poor and miserable a\r\ncountry to suit them, and that they had best think of returning to\r\nFrance. In vain did they, after thanking him for his friendly interest,\r\nassure him with firmness, that, notwithstanding his advice, they\r\nintended to remain; in vain did the poor Regent promise his support, and\r\naffirm that he it was \"who governed the country;\" there was no combating\r\nthe all-powerful influence of the Chinese ambassador. At last, finding\r\nall opposition fruitless, they determined to quit Lha-Ssa, but not\r\nbefore the good-natured Regent had fought hard in the cause of\r\ntolerance. We cannot refrain from quoting some of the arguments of this\r\npoor, benighted Buddhist, and commending them to the attention of some\r\nof the Lamas of the Western world:\r\n\r\n     The Regent could not be made to share the apprehensions which\r\n     Ki-Chan sought to instil into his mind. He maintained that our\r\n     presence at Lha-Ssa could in no manner endanger the safety of\r\n     the state. \"If,\" said he, \"the doctrine that these men teach be\r\n     false, the people of Thibet will not embrace it; if, on the\r\n     contrary, it be true, what have we to fear? How can truth be\r\n     hurtful to mankind? These two Lamas from the kingdom of\r\n     France,\" he added, \"have done no harm; their intentions towards\r\n     us are most friendly. Can we, without reason, deprive them of\r\n     that liberty and protection which we grant here to all men, and\r\n     especially to men of prayer? Are we justified in rendering\r\n     ourselves guilty of present and positive injustice, from the\r\n     imaginary dread of evils to come?\"\r\n\r\nThe two missionaries had made up their minds to leave Thibet; but they\r\nhad fancied that the manner of doing so would be left to their option,\r\nand that they would be allowed to take the route towards British India.\r\nGreat, therefore, was their surprise when they discovered that they were\r\nto be conducted, under escort, to the frontiers of China--a journey of\r\nnearly eight months' duration. Expostulation was useless; and with a\r\nheavy heart they were obliged to leave Lha-Ssa, in company of fifteen\r\nChinese soldiers, under the command of the Mandarin Ly-Kouo-Ngan--alias,\r\nLy, the Pacifier of kingdoms! His Excellency Ly was an admirable\r\nspecimen of a Chinese skeptic, scoffing alike at Bonzes and Lamas; but\r\nhaving, like many other _esprits forts_, a pet superstition for his\r\nprivate use, and professing an ardent devotion to--the Great Bear! For\r\nthe details of this homeward journey, we must, however, refer our\r\nreaders to the book itself; we will merely say, that its dangers and\r\nfatigues were so great that the travellers must, more than once, have\r\nsuspected the treacherous Ki-Chan of having plotted their destruction.\r\n\r\nM. Huc, in the first moment of indignation, seems to have hoped that his\r\ngovernment would have remonstrated, but we have not heard that such has\r\nbeen the case, and Thibet is likely to remain, for some time to come,\r\nforbidden ground to European settlers. We have already given our opinion\r\nrespecting the probability of missionaries of any Christian sect\r\nsucceeding in the main object of the undertaking in which our heroes\r\n(they deserve the name) failed; and M. Huc himself seems to insinuate,\r\ntowards the close of his work, that those who in future may seek to\r\nChristianize Thibet, would do well to try the potency of physical\r\nbenefits. We have always thought, and experience has proved beyond\r\ndispute, that a certain degree of material civilization should precede,\r\nor at least accompany, the introduction of Christianity. The starving\r\nSinghalese of low caste, keenly alive to the comforts of rice and social\r\nequality, proclaims himself of the religion of the East India Company;\r\nthe knowledge-loving Buddhist of Thibet may one day adopt the religion\r\nof railways, microscopes, and electric telegraphs; and it is just\r\npossible, as M. Huc observes, that the missionary who should introduce\r\nvaccination at Lha-Ssa, would at one stroke extirpate small-pox and\r\nBuddhism.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[12] _Souvenirs d'un Voyage dans la Tartarie, le Thibet, et la Chine\r\npendant les années 1844, 1845, et 1846._ Par M.

Only the other day we read in the newspapers that a\r\nFrenchman who had been guilty of embezzlement, and was afraid of being\r\nfound out, went into a theatre in Lyons, and stabbed a young woman whom\r\nhe had never seen before in his life, in order that he might die by the\r\nhands of the executioner, and so escape the inconvenience of rushing\r\ninto the other world without having time to make his peace with Heaven.\r\nHe desired death as a refuge from the anguish of mind he was suffering;\r\nbut instead of killing himself be killed somebody else, because the law\r\nwould allow him leisure for repentance before it inflicted the penalty\r\nof his crime.\r\n\r\nIt will be said the man was mad--I suppose he was; and so is every body\r\nwhilst under the influence of an absorbing passion, whether the mania be\r\nlove, jealousy, fanaticism, or revenge. The following tale will\r\nillustrate one phase of such a madness.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1789, there resided in Italy, not far from Aquila in the\r\nAbruzzo, a man called Gaspar Mendez. He appears to have been a Spaniard,\r\nif not actually by birth, at least by descent, and to have possessed a\r\nsmall estate, which he rendered valuable by pasturing cattle. Not far\r\nfrom where he resided there lived with her parents a remarkably handsome\r\ngirl, of the name of Bianca Venoni, and on this fair damsel Mendez fixed\r\nhis affections. As he was by many degrees the best match about the\r\nneighborhood, he never doubted that his addresses would be received with\r\na warm welcome, and intoxicated with this security, he seems to have\r\nmade his advances so abruptly, that the girl felt herself entitled to\r\ngive him an equally abrupt refusal. To aggravate his mortification, he\r\ndiscovered that a young man, called Giuseppe Ripa, had been a secret\r\nwitness to the rejection, which took place in an orchard; and as he\r\nwalked away with rage in his heart, he heard echoing behind him the\r\nmerry laugh of the two thoughtless young people. Proud and revengeful by\r\nnature, this affront seems to have rankled dreadfully in the mind of\r\nGaspar; although, in accordance with that pride, he endeavored to\r\nconceal his feelings under a show of indifference. Those who knew the\r\nparties well, however, were not deceived; and when, after an interval,\r\nit was discovered that Giuseppe himself was the favored lover of Bianca,\r\nthe enmity, though not more open, became more intense than ever.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, Old Venoni, Bianca's father, had become aware of the\r\nfine match his daughter had missed, and was extremely angry about it;\r\nmore particularly as he was poor, and would have been very much pleased\r\nto have a rich son-in-law. Nor was he disposed to relinquish the chance\r\nso easily. After first trying his influence on Bianca, upon whom he\r\nexpended a great deal of persuasion and cajolery in vain, he went so far\r\nas to call upon Gaspar, apologizing for his daughter's ignorance and\r\nfolly in refusing so desirable a proposal, and expressing a hope that\r\nMendez would not relinquish the pursuit, but try his fortune again; when\r\nhe hoped to have brought her to a better state of mind.\r\n\r\nGaspar received the old man with civility, but answered coldly, that any\r\nfurther advances on his own part were out of the question, unless he had\r\nreason to believe the young lady was inclined to retract her refusal; in\r\nwhich case he should be happy to wait upon her. With this response\r\nVenoni returned to make another attack upon his daughter, whom, however,\r\nfortified by her strong attachment to Ripa, he found quite immovable;\r\nand there for several months the affair seems to have rested, till the\r\nold man, urged by the embarrassment of his circumstances, renewed the\r\npersecution, coupling it with certain calumnies against Giuseppe,\r\nfounded on the accidental loss of a sum of money which had been\r\nintrusted to him by a friend, who wanted it conveyed to a neighboring\r\nvillage, whither the young man had occasion to go. This loss, which\r\nseems to have arisen out of some youthful imprudence, appears to have\r\noccasioned Ripa a great deal of distress; and he not only did his utmost\r\nto repair it by giving up every thing he had, which was indeed very\r\nlittle, but he also engaged to pay regularly a portion of his weekly\r\nearnings, till the whole sum was replaced.\r\n\r\nHis behavior, in short, was so satisfactory, that the person to whom the\r\nmoney had belonged does not seem to have borne him any ill-will on the\r\nsubject; but Venoni took advantage of the circumstance to fling\r\naspersions on the young man's character, whilst it strengthened his\r\nargument against the connection with his daughter; for how was Giuseppe\r\nto maintain a wife and family with this millstone of debt round his\r\nneck? Bianca, however, continued faithful to her lover, and for some\r\ntime nothing happened to advance the suit of either party. In that\r\ninterval a sister of Gasper's had married a man called Alessandro Malfi,\r\nwho, being a friend of Giuseppe's, endeavored to bring about a\r\nreconciliation betwixt the rivals, or, rather, to produce a more cordial\r\nfeeling, for there had never been a quarrel; and as far as Ripa was\r\nconcerned, as he had no cause for jealousy, there was no reason why he\r\nshould bear ill-will to the unsuccessful candidate. With Gaspar it was\r\ndifferent: he hated Ripa; but as it hurt his pride that this enmity to\r\none whom he considered so far beneath him should be known, he made no\r\nopen demonstration of dislike, and when Malfi expressed a wish to invite\r\nhis friend to supper, hoping that Mendez would not refuse to meet him,\r\nthe Spaniard made no objection whatever. \"Why not?\" he said: \"he knew of\r\nno reason why he should not meet Giuseppe Ripa, or any other person his\r\nbrother-in-law chose to invite.\"\r\n\r\nAccordingly the party was made; and on the night appointed Giuseppe,\r\nafter a private interview in the orchard with his mistress, started for\r\nMalfi's house, which was situated about three miles off, in the same\r\ndirection as Gaspar's, which, indeed, he had to pass; on which account\r\nhe deterred his departure to a later hour than he otherwise would have\r\ndone, wishing not to come in contact with his rival till they met under\r\nMalfi's roof. Mendez had a servant called Antonio Guerra, who worked on\r\nhis farm, and who appears to have been much in his confidence, and just\r\nas Ripa passed the Spaniard's door, he met Guerra coming in an opposite\r\ndirection, and asked him if Mendez had gone to the supper yet; to which\r\nGuerra answered that he supposed he had, but he did not know. Guerra\r\nthen took a key out of his pocket, and unlocking the door, entered the\r\nhouse, whilst Ripa walked on.\r\n\r\nIn the mean while the little party had assembled in Malfi's parlor, all\r\nbut the two principal personages, Gaspar and Giuseppe; and as time\r\nadvanced without their appearing, some jests were passed amongst the men\r\npresent, who wished they might not have fallen foul of each other on the\r\nway. At length, however, Ripa arrived, and the first question that was\r\nput to him was: \"What had he done with his rival?\" which he answered by\r\ninquiring if the Spaniard was not come. But although he endeavored to\r\nappear unconcerned, there was a tremor in his voice and a confusion of\r\nmanner that excited general observation. He made violent efforts,\r\nhowever, to appear at his ease, but these efforts were too manifest to\r\nbe successful; whilst the continued absence of Mendez became so\r\nunaccountable, that a cloud seems to have settled on the spirits of the\r\ncompany, which made the expected festivity pass very heavily off.\r\n\r\n\"Where could Mendez be? What could have detained him? It was to be hoped\r\nno harm had happened to him!\" Such was the burden of the conversation\r\ntill--when at about an hour before midnight the party broke\r\nup--Alessandro Malfi said, that to allay the anxiety of his wife, who\r\nwas getting extremely alarmed about her brother, he would walk as far as\r\nForni--which was the name of Gaspar's farm--to inquire what had become\r\nof him.\r\n\r\nAs Ripa's way lay in the same direction, they naturally started\r\ntogether; and after what appears to have been a very silent walk--for\r\nthe spirits of Giuseppe were so depressed that the other found it\r\nimpossible to draw him into conversation--they reached Forni, when,\r\nhaving rung the bell, they were presently answered by Antonio Guerra,\r\nwho put his head out of an upper window to inquire who they were, and\r\nwhat they wanted.\r\n\r\n\"It is I, Alessandro Malfi. I want to know where your master is, and why\r\nhe has not been to my house this evening as he promised?\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought he was there,\" said Antonio; \"he set off from here to go soon\r\nafter seven o'clock.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is most extraordinary!\" returned Malfi; \"what in the world can\r\nhave become of him?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is very strange, certainly,\" answered the servant; \"he has never\r\ncome home; and when you rang I thought it was he returned from the\r\nparty.\"\r\n\r\nAs there was no more to be learned, the two friends now parted; Malfi\r\nexpressing considerable surprise and some uneasiness at the\r\nnon-appearance of his brother-in-law: whilst of Giuseppe we hear nothing\r\nmore till the following afternoon, when, whilst at work in his vineyard,\r\nhe was accosted by two officers of justice from Aquila, and he found\r\nhimself arrested, under an accusation of having waylaid Mendez in a\r\nmountain-pass on the preceding evening, and wounded him, with the design\r\nof taking his life.\r\n\r\nThe first words Ripa uttered on hearing this impeachment--words that,\r\nlike all the rest of his behavior, told dreadfully against him--were:\r\n\"Isn't he dead, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"No thanks to you that he's not,\" replied the officer; \"but he's alive,\r\nand likely to recover to give evidence against his assassin.\"\r\n\r\n\"_Dio!_\" cried Giuseppe, \"I wish I'd known he wasn't dead!\"\r\n\r\n\"You confess, then, that you wounded him with the intent to kill?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered Ripa; \"I confess no such thing. As I was going through\r\nthe pass last night I observed a man's hat lying a little off the road,\r\nand on lifting it, I saw it belonged to Señor Mendez. Whilst I was\r\nwondering how it came there without the owner, and was looking about for\r\nhim, I spied him lying behind a boulder. At first I thought he was\r\nasleep, but on looking again, I saw he didn't lie like a sleeping man,\r\nand I concluded he was dead. Had it been any one but he, I should have\r\nlifted him up; but it being very well known that we were no friends, I\r\nown I was afraid to do so. I thought it better not to meddle with him at\r\nall. However, if he is alive, as you say, perhaps he can tell himself\r\nwho wounded him.\"\r\n\r\n\"To be sure he can,\" returned the officer; \"he says it's you!\"\r\n\r\n\"_Perduto son' io!_--Then I am lost!\" exclaimed Ripa; who, on being\r\nbrought before the authorities, persisted in the same story; adding,\r\nthat so far from seeking Mendez, he had particularly wished to avoid\r\nhim, and that that was the reason he had started so late; for he had\r\nbeen warned that the Spaniard was his enemy, and he apprehended that if\r\nthey met alone some collision might ensue.\r\n\r\nIt appeared, however, that he had consumed much more time on the road\r\nthan could be fairly accounted for; for two or three people had met him\r\non the way before he reached Forni; and then Antonio Guerra could speak\r\nas to the exact hour of his passing. This discrepancy he attempted to\r\nexplain by saying, that after seeing Mendez on the ground, dead--as he\r\nbelieved--he had been so agitated and alarmed that he did not like to\r\npresent himself at Malfi's house, lest he should excite observation. He\r\nhad also spent some time in deliberating whether or not he should\r\nmention what he had seen; and he had made up his mind to do so on his\r\narrival, but was deterred by every body's asking him, when he entered\r\nthe room, what he had done with Mendez--a question that seemed to imply\r\na suspicion against himself.\r\n\r\nThis tale, of course, was not believed: indeed his whole demeanor on the\r\nnight in question tended strongly to his condemnation; added to which,\r\nMalfi, who had been his friend, testified that not only had Ripa\r\nbetrayed all the confusion of guilt during the walk from his house to\r\nForni, but that having hold of his arm, he had distinctly felt him\r\ntremble as they passed the spot where Mendez was subsequently\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nWith regard to Mendez himself, it appeared that when found he was in a\r\nstate of insensibility, and he was still too weak to give evidence or\r\nenter into any particulars; but when, under proper remedies, he had\r\nrecovered his senses, Faustina Malfi, his sister--to whose house he had\r\nbeen carried--asked him if Giuseppe Ripa was not the assassin; and he\r\nanswered in the affirmative.\r\n\r\nGiuseppe was thrown into prison to await his trial; and having public\r\nopinion, as well as that of the authorities against him, he was\r\nuniversally considered a dead man. The only person that adhered to him\r\nwas Bianca, who visited him in the jail, and refused to believe him\r\nguilty. But if he was innocent, who was the criminal? It appeared\r\nafterwards that Ripa himself had his own suspicions on that subject, but\r\nas they were founded only on two slight indications, he felt it was\r\nuseless to advance them.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Gaspar Mendez was slowly recovering the injuries he had\r\nreceived, and was of course expected to give a more explanatory account\r\nof what had happened to him after he left Forni on his way to Alessandro\r\nMalfi's. That he had been robbed as well as wounded was already\r\nknown--his brother and sister having found his pockets empty and his\r\nwatch gone. The explanation he could give, however, proved to be very\r\nscanty. Indeed, he seemed to know very little about the matter, but he\r\nstill adhered to his first assertion, that Ripa was the assassin. With\r\nregard to the money he had lost, there was necessarily less mystery,\r\nsince it consisted of a sum that he was carrying to his sister, and was\r\nindeed her property, being the half share of some rents which he had\r\nreceived on that morning, the produce of two houses in the town of\r\nAquila which had been bequeathed to them conjointly by their mother. The\r\nmoney was in a canvas bag, and the other half which belonged to himself\r\nhe had left locked in his strong box at home, where, on searching for\r\nit, it was found. As Ripa was known to be poor, and very much straitened\r\nby his endeavors to make good the sum he had lost, that he should add\r\nrobbery to assassination was not to be wondered at. On the contrary, it\r\nstrengthened the conviction of his guilt, by supplying an additional\r\nmotive for the crime.\r\n\r\nThe injuries having been severe, it was some time before Mendez\r\nrecovered sufficiently to return home; and when he was well enough to\r\nmove, instead of going to Forni, he discharged his servant Antonio\r\nGuerra, and went himself to Florence, where he remained several months.\r\n\r\nAll this time Giuseppe Ripa was in prison, condemned to die, but not\r\nexecuted; because after his trial and sentence, a letter had been\r\nreceived by the chief person in authority, warning him against shedding\r\nthe blood of the innocent. \"Señor Mendez is mistaken,\" the letter said;\r\n\"he did not see the assassin, who attacked him from behind, and Giuseppe\r\nRipa is not guilty.\"\r\n\r\nThis judge, whose name was Marino, appears to have been a just man, and\r\nto have felt some dissatisfaction with the evidence against Ripa;\r\ninasmuch as Mendez, who, when first questioned, had spoken confidently\r\nas to his identity, had since faltered when he came to give his evidence\r\nin public, and seemed unable to afford any positive testimony on the\r\nsubject. The presumption against the prisoner, without the evidence of\r\nthe Spaniard, was considered by the other judges strong enough to\r\nconvict him; but Marino had objected that since the attack was made by\r\ndaylight--for it was in the summer, and the evenings were quite\r\nlight--it seemed extraordinary that Mendez could give no more certain\r\nindications of his assailant. Added to this, although every means had\r\nbeen used to obtain a confession--such means as are permitted on the\r\ncontinent, but illegal in this country--Giuseppe persisted in his\r\ninnocence. Moreover, as no money had been found about him, and Faustina\r\nMalfi was exceedingly desirous of recovering what had been lost, she\r\nexerted herself to obtain mercy to at least the extent, that hopes of a\r\ncommutation of his sentence should be held out to the prisoner, provided\r\nhe would reveal where he had concealed the bagful of silver he had taken\r\nfrom her brother. But in vain. Ripa was either guiltless or obstinate,\r\nfor nothing could be extracted from him but repeated declarations of his\r\ninnocence.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time Bianca had been undergoing a terrible persecution from\r\nher father on the subject of Mendez, who had returned from Florence, and\r\ntaken up his abode as formerly at Forni. Her former lover was a\r\ncondemned man, and altogether _hors de combat_; she might regret him as\r\nshe would, and lament his fate to her heart's content, but he could\r\nnever be her husband; and there was the Spaniard, rich and ready; whilst\r\nthe increasing age and poverty of her parent rendered a good match of\r\nthe greatest importance. In short, under the circumstances of the case,\r\nit was urged upon her on all hands, that she was bound both by her duty\r\nto her father and to evince her abhorrence of Ripa's crime--which\r\notherwise it might be supposed she had instigated--to marry Mendez\r\nwithout delay.\r\n\r\nPersuaded of Giuseppe's innocence, and half believing that the\r\naccusation was prompted by jealousy, it may be imagined how unwelcome\r\nthese importunities were, and for a considerable time she resisted them;\r\nindeed she seems only to have been overcome at last by a ruse. A rumor\r\nbeing set afloat that the day was about to be appointed for Ripa's\r\nexecution, a hint was thrown out that it lay in her power to save his\r\nlife: she had only to become the wife of Mendez, and her lover's\r\nsentence should be commuted from death to banishment. This last argument\r\nprevailed, and poor Bianca, with a heavy heart, consented to become the\r\nmistress of Forni. The Malfis, however, do not seem to have been amongst\r\nthose who desired the match; and it would appear that they even made\r\nsome attempts to prevent its taking place, by circulating a report that\r\nshe had been privy to the assault and robbery. Perhaps they hoped, if\r\nGaspar remained unmarried, to inherit his property themselves; but\r\nhowever that may be, their opposition was of no avail, and an early\r\nperiod was fixed for the wedding.\r\n\r\nThe year had now come round to the summer season again, and it happened,\r\nby mere accident, that the day appointed for the marriage was the\r\nanniversary of that on which Mendez had been robbed and wounded. Nobody,\r\nhowever, appears to have thought of this coincidence, till Mendez\r\nhimself, observing the day of the month, requested that the ceremony\r\nmight be postponed till the day after: \"Because,\" said he, \"I have\r\nbusiness which will take me to Aquila on the 7th, so the marriage had\r\nbetter take place on the 8th.\" And thus it was arranged.\r\n\r\nThis alteration was made about ten days before the appointed period, and\r\nnothing seems to have occurred in the interval worth recording, except\r\nthat as the hour of sacrifice drew near, the unwillingness of the victim\r\nbecame more evident. We must conclude, however, that Mendez, whose\r\nobject in marrying her appears to have been fully as much the soothing\r\nof his pride as the gratification of his love, was not influenced by her\r\ndisinclination, for when he started for Aquila on the 7th, every\r\npreparation had been made for the wedding on the following day.\r\n\r\nThe object of his journey was to receive the rents before named, which\r\nbecame due at this period, and also to purchase a wedding-present for\r\nhis bride. On this occasion Alessandro Malfi was to have accompanied\r\nhim; but when Mendez stopped at his door to inquire if he was ready,\r\nMalfi came down stairs half dressed, saying that he had been up all\r\nnight with his wife, who was ill, and that as she had now fallen asleep,\r\nhe was going to lie down himself, and try to get a little rest. This\r\noccurred early in the morning; and Mendez rode on, saying that he should\r\ncall as he came back in the evening, to inquire how his sister was. Upon\r\nthis Malfi went to bed, where he remained some hours--indeed, till he\r\nreceived a message from his wife, begging him to go to her. When he\r\nentered the room, the first question she asked was whether Gaspar was\r\ngone to Aquila; and on being told that he was, she said she was very\r\nsorry for it, for that she had dreamed she saw a man with a mask lying\r\nin wait to rob him.\r\n\r\n\"I saw the man as distinctly as possible,\" she said, \"but I could not\r\nsee his face for the mask; and I saw the place, so that I'm sure if I\r\nwere taken there I should recognize it.\"\r\n\r\nHer husband told her not to mind her dreams, and that this one was\r\ndoubtless suggested by the circumstance that had occurred the year\r\nbefore. \"But,\" said he, \"Ripa is safely locked up in jail now, and\r\nthere's no danger.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the dream appears to have made so deep an impression on\r\nthe sick woman's fancy, that she never let her husband rest till he\r\npromised to go with his own farm-servant to meet her brother--a\r\ncompliance which was at length won from him by her saying that she had\r\nseen the man crouching behind a low wall that surrounded a half-built\r\nchurch; \"and close by,\" she added, \"there was a direction-post with\r\nsomething written on it, but I could not read what it was.\"\r\n\r\nNow it happened that on the horse-road to Aquila, which Faustina herself\r\nhad never travelled, there was exactly such a spot as that she\r\ndescribed. Malfi knew it well. Struck by the circumstance, he desired to\r\nhave his dinner immediately, and then, accompanied by his hind, he set\r\noff to meet Gaspar.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile the Spaniard had got his money and made his purchases\r\nin good time, not wishing to be late on the road, so that they had\r\nscarcely got a mile beyond the church when they met him; and in answer\r\nto his inquiries what had brought them there, Malfi related his wife's\r\ndream, adding that he might have spared himself the ride, for he had\r\nlooked over the wall, and saw nobody there. \"I told her it was\r\nnonsense,\" he said, \"whilst we know your enemy's under such good keeping\r\nat Aquila; but she wouldn't be satisfied till I came.\"\r\n\r\nMendez, however, appeared exceedingly struck with the dream, inquired\r\nthe particulars more in detail, and asked if they were sure there was\r\nnobody concealed in the place Faustina indicated. Malfi answered that he\r\ndid not alight, but he looked over the wall and saw nobody. During the\r\ncourse of this conversation they had turned their horses' heads, and\r\nwere riding back towards the church, Malfi talking about Ripa's affair,\r\nremarking on the impropriety of deferring his execution so long; Mendez\r\nmore than usually silent and serious, and the servant riding beside\r\nthem, when, as they approached the spot, they saw coming towards them on\r\nfoot a man, whom they all three recognized as Antonio Guerra, the\r\nSpaniard's late servant. As this person was supposed to have gone to\r\nanother part of the country after quitting Gaspar's service, Malfi\r\nexpressed some surprise at seeing him; whilst Mendez turned very pale,\r\nmaking at the same time some exclamation that attracted the attention of\r\nhis brother-in-law, who, however, drew up his horse to ask Guerra what\r\nhad brought him back, and if he was out of a situation, adding that a\r\nneighbor of his, whom he named, was in want of a servant. Guerra, who\r\nlooked poorly dressed, and by no means in such good case as formerly,\r\nanswered that he should be very glad if Malfi would recommend him.\r\n\r\n\"You had better turn about, then, and come on with us,\" said Malfi, as\r\nhe rode forward. During this conversation Mendez had sat by saying\r\nnothing; and if he was grave and silent before, he was still more so\r\nnow, insomuch that his behavior drew the attention of his\r\nbrother-in-law, who asked him if there was any thing wrong with him.\r\n\r\n\"Surely it's not Faustina's dream you are thinking of?\" he said; adding,\r\n\"that the meeting with Guerra had put it out of his head, or he would\r\nhave examined the place more narrowly.\"\r\n\r\nMendez entered into no explanation; and as the servant, who was\r\nacquainted with Guerra, took him up behind him, they all arrived at\r\ntheir journey's end nearly together; Mendez, instead of proceeding\r\nhomewards, turning off with the others to Malfi's house, where the first\r\nthing he did after his arrival was to visit his sister, whom he found\r\nbetter; whilst she, on the contrary, was struck with the pallor of his\r\nfeatures and the agitation of his manner--a disorder which, like her\r\nhusband, she attributed to the shock of her dream, acting upon a mind\r\nprepared by the affair of the preceding year to take alarm. In order to\r\nremove the impression, she laughed at the fright she had been in; but it\r\nwas evident he could not share her merriment, and he quickly left her,\r\nsaying he had a message to send to Rocca, which was the village where\r\nBianca and her father resided, and that he must go below and write a\r\nnote, which he did, giving it to Malfi's servant to take.\r\n\r\nIt appeared afterwards that this man, having other work in hand, gave\r\nthe note to Guerra, who willingly undertook the commission, and who, to\r\nsatisfy his own curiosity, broke the seal on the way, and possessed\r\nhimself of its contents before he delivered it. These were, however,\r\nonly a request that Bianca and her father would come over to Malfi's\r\nhouse that evening and bring the notary of the village with them, he\r\n(Mendez) being too tired to go to Rocca to sign the contract, as had\r\nbeen arranged.\r\n\r\nIt being between six and seven o'clock when this dispatch arrived,\r\nBianca, who was very little inclined to sign the contract at all,\r\nobjected to going; but her father insisting on her compliance, they set\r\noff in company with Guerra and the notary, who, according to\r\nappointment, was already in waiting. They had nearly three miles to go,\r\nand as Venoni had no horse, the notary gave Bianca a seat on his, and\r\nthe old man rode double with Guerra.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived Mendez was standing at the door waiting for them,\r\naccompanied by Malfi, his servant, a priest, and two or three other\r\npersons of the neighborhood; some of whom advanced to assist Bianca and\r\nher father to alight, whilst the others surrounded Guerra as he set his\r\nfoot on the ground, pinioning his arms and plunging their hands into his\r\npockets, from whence they drew two small pistols and a black mask, such\r\nas was worn at the carnivals; besides these weapons, he carried a\r\nstiletto in his bosom.\r\n\r\nWhilst the last comers were gaping with amazement at this unexpected\r\nscene, the new-made prisoner was led away to a place of security, and\r\nthe company proceeded into the house, where the notary produced the\r\ncontract and laid it on the table, inquiring at the same time what\r\nGuerra had done to be so treated.\r\n\r\nThen Mendez rose, and taking hold of the contract, he tore it in two,\r\nand flung it on the ground; at which sight Venoni started up with a cry,\r\nor rather a howl--an expression of rage and disappointment truly\r\nItalian, and of which no Englishman who has not heard it can have an\r\nidea.\r\n\r\n\"_Peccato!_ I have sinned!\" said the Spaniard, haughtily; \"but I have\r\nmade my confession to the padre; and why I have torn that paper my\r\nbrother-in-law, Alessandro, will presently tell you!\" He then offered\r\nhis hand to Bianca, who, no less pleased than astonished to see the\r\ncontract destroyed, willingly responded to this token of good-will by\r\ngiving him hers, which he kissed, asking her pardon for any pain he had\r\noccasioned her; after which, bowing to the company, he quitted the room,\r\nmounted his horse, and rode off to Forni.\r\n\r\nWhen the sound of the animal's feet had died away, and the parties\r\nconcerned were sufficiently composed to listen to him, Malfi proceeded\r\nto make the communication he had been charged with; whereby it appeared\r\nthat Ripa had been unjustly accused, and that Antonio Guerra was the\r\nreal criminal. Mendez knew this very well, and would not have thought of\r\naccusing his rival had not his brother and sister, and indeed everybody\r\nelse, assumed Ripa's guilt as an unquestionable fact. The temptation was\r\ntoo strong for him, and after he had once admitted it, pride would not\r\nallow him to retract. At the same time he declared that he would never\r\nhave permitted the execution to take place, and that after the marriage\r\nwith Bianca he intended to procure the innocent man's liberation, on the\r\ncondition of his quitting that part of the country. Of course it was he\r\nwho wrote the letter to Marino, and he had used the precaution of\r\nplacing a sealed packet, containing a confession of the truth, in the\r\nhands of a notary at Aquila, with strict directions to deliver it to\r\nRipa if the authorities should appear disposed to carry his sentence\r\ninto execution.\r\n\r\nHe had nevertheless suffered considerable qualms of conscience about the\r\nwhole affair; and the moment he saw Guerra on the road that night, he\r\nfelt certain that he had come with the intention of waylaying him as\r\nbefore--the man being well aware that it was on that day he usually\r\nreceived his rents. He perceived that he should never be safe as long as\r\nthis villain was free, and that he must either henceforth live in\r\ncontinual terror of assassination, or confront the mortification of a\r\nconfession whilst the fellow was in his power.\r\n\r\nWith respect to Guerra himself, he made but feeble resistance when he\r\nwas seized. He had, in the first instance, left Mendez for dead; and he\r\nwould have immediately fled when he heard he was alive, had not the news\r\nbeen accompanied with the further information that the Spaniard had\r\npointed out Ripa as his assailant. He was exceedingly surprised, for he\r\ncould scarcely believe that he had not been recognized. Nevertheless, it\r\nwas possible; and whether it were so or not, he did not doubt that what\r\nMendez had once asserted he would adhere to. On receiving his dismissal,\r\nhe had gone to some distance from the scene of his crime; but having,\r\nwhilst the money lasted, acquired habits of idleness and dissipation\r\nthat could not be maintained without a further supply, these necessities\r\nhad provoked this last enterprise.\r\n\r\nHe had really been concealed behind the wall when Malfi and his servant\r\npassed; but concluding that they were going to meet Mendez, and that his\r\nscheme was defeated, he had thought it both useless and dangerous to\r\nremain, and was intending to make off in another direction, when their\r\nsudden return surprised him.\r\n\r\nA few hours more saw Antonio Guerra in Guiseppe Ripa's cell; and whilst\r\nthe first paid the penalty of his crimes, the latter was rewarded for\r\nhis sufferings by the hand of Bianca, to whom the Spaniard gave a small\r\nmarriage-portion before finally quitting the country, which he did\r\nimmediately after Antonio's trial.\r\n\r\nRipa said he had always had a strong persuasion that Guerra was the real\r\ncriminal from two circumstances: the first was the hurried manner in\r\nwhich he was walking on the evening he met him at the gate of Forni, and\r\nsome strange expression of countenance which he had afterwards recalled.\r\nThe second was his answering them from the window when he and Malfi went\r\nto inquire for Mendez. If he thought it was his master, as he said, why\r\nhad he not come down at once to admit him?\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable that the enmity of the Spaniard was not directed\r\nagainst the man that had aimed at his life, but against him who had\r\nwounded his pride.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the Eclectic Review\r\n\r\nJOHN ROBINSON, THE PASTOR OF THE PILGRIMS.[18]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was in John Robinson a rare union of many admirable and noble\r\nqualities; and the meekness of his wisdom was rewarded by his becoming,\r\nin no figurative or trivial sense, the father, intellectually, morally,\r\nspiritually, of a great nation. Like Moses, he was not permitted to\r\nenter the land of promise; yet, like Moses, his memory was sacred to\r\nthousands who had derived through him those principles, institutions,\r\nand manners, which fitted them in so large a measure for their novel\r\nposition in a strange land. To this day the name of Robinson is a\r\nhousehold word in New England; and, instead of dying out, is rising in\r\nreputation throughout the United States generally, wherever pure and\r\nundefiled religion prevails, and wherever the enterprising citizens of\r\nthe greatest republic the world ever saw, have leisure to trace the\r\nfirst beginnings of their nation's glory. The fact mentioned in the\r\npreface of this first collected edition of his works, that \"a large body\r\nof subscribers\" have been obtained \"in Great Britain and in the United\r\nStates,\" while it is no measure of the reverence with which the memory\r\nof Robinson is regarded, affords nevertheless good augury for the\r\nfuture. Another hopeful circumstance is the announcement of a new Life\r\nof Robinson, from the pen of the Editor of the \"American Biographical\r\nDictionary,\" Dr. Allen, of Northampton, Massachusetts. This rivalry, or\r\nrather co-operation of the two countries, in reviving the memory of the\r\ndead, is gratifying evidence that the seed which Robinson sowed so\r\ndiligently was living seed, and reproductive in both hemispheres; and\r\nis, possibly, an indication at the same time--for the providence of God\r\nprepares the way for great events by raising up the means auxiliary to\r\ntheir accomplishment--that the time is drawing near, when, in the\r\nconflict of opinion, such principles as those which the pastor of the\r\npilgrim fathers so nobly vindicated, both by his life and his writings,\r\nwill be greatly in request.\r\n\r\nWe have no space to enter at length into the various incidents in the\r\nlife of this truly great and good man--a life, which, notwithstanding\r\nthe carefully compiled memoir prefixed to these volumes, and many\r\nbriefer or larger notices in other publications, still remains to be\r\nwritten. A few particulars, however, will assist the reader in forming a\r\nproper opinion of the man and his times.\r\n\r\nJohn Robinson was born, probably, in Lincolnshire, in 1575. At the early\r\nage of seventeen he entered upon his studies at Cambridge, matriculating\r\nand taking his degree as master of arts at _Corpus Christi_ College, of\r\nwhich he became a fellow in 1598. He resigned his fellowship in 1604, on\r\naccount of the new views he had embraced in relation to ecclesiastical\r\nmatters. In one of his works he has given some details respecting his\r\nconversion to Separatism. It is regretted that such incidental\r\nreferences are so rare. At the same time, we are convinced that the\r\nfuture biographer may gather more from this source than has hitherto\r\nbeen done. But this by the way. In his reply to Bernard, in\r\njustification of his separation from the church of England, he informs\r\nus, that \"a long time\" before he left the church, he had read several of\r\nthe treatises of the Brownists and Barrowists, and was convinced by them\r\nthat the constitution and working of the church were unscriptural. He\r\nalso mentions, as he says, to his \"own shame,\" that the reverence he had\r\nfor many of the pious clergy, was the only reason why he did not sooner\r\nfollow out his own conviction of duty. Every one who knows how difficult\r\na thing it is even now, when dissent presents so different an aspect\r\nfrom what it had in the days of Elizabeth and James, for a clergyman to\r\nrelinquish his position in connection with an establishment in which he\r\nhas been brought up, will readily appreciate the difficulties under\r\nwhich Robinson labored. It is true the Independents, both baptist and\r\npædobaptist, are still in a minority; but how different the minority of\r\nthis day from that of the early part of the seventeenth century! To _be_\r\nin a minority then was to _feel_ it--at every turn--and in one's nearest\r\nand most cherished interests. It involved more than the loss of\r\n_caste_--reputation--respectability. It was to become an outcast and an\r\noutlaw, and to put one's self at the mercy of the bishop and his agents,\r\nin a day when even the \"tender mercies\" of bishops were cruelty itself.\r\nRobinson had the courage to join the minority of that day. He left\r\nNorwich, where he had officiated for a short period, resigned his\r\nfellowship at Cambridge, as we have already stated, and became an avowed\r\nseparatist.\r\n\r\nAfter stating that Robinson proceeded to Lincolnshire, where he found a\r\nconsiderable number of separatists, with Smyth and Clifton at their\r\nhead, who had constituted themselves into a church, by solemn covenant\r\nwith the Lord, \"to walk in all his ways made known, or to be made known\r\nunto them, according to their best endeavors, WHATEVER IT SHOULD COST\r\nTHEM,\"--the Memoir proceeds:\r\n\r\n     \"The location of this first [?] separatist church has long been\r\n     an object of investigation and doubt. The difficulty appears to\r\n     be solved by Joseph Hunter, Esq., in his valuable \"Collections\"\r\n     concerning the first colonists of New England. The following is\r\n     a summary of Mr. Hunter's proofs, identifying Scrooby, Notts,\r\n     as the village, and Mr. Brewster's house as the manor, in\r\n     which, when practicable, they worshipped. Governor Bradford,\r\n     who was originally one of the church, and whose birthplace and\r\n     residence were at Austerfield, in the vicinity, states\r\n     distinctly, that Mr. Brewster's house was a \"manor of the\r\n     bishop's.\" This description of the house furnished the key to\r\n     the difficulty. Scrooby is about one mile and a half south of\r\n     Bawtry, in Yorkshire, and from which Austerfield is about the\r\n     same distance northeast, and both not far distant from the\r\n     adjacent county of Lincoln. Mr. Hunter says, \"I can speak with\r\n     confidence to the fact, that there is no other episcopal manor\r\n     but this, which at all satisfies the condition of being near\r\n     the borders of the three counties.\" The Brewsters were\r\n     residents of Scrooby: the manor place which they occupied\r\n     originally belonged to the Archbishops of York, and had been\r\n     leased to Sir Samuel Sandys, son of Dr. Sandys, the archbishop,\r\n     in 1586. The Brewster family were now tenants of Sir Samuel,\r\n     and were occupants of the mansion of the Sandys. This fact\r\n     serves both as an identification of the place, and as an\r\n     explanation of the circumstance that the Sandys took great\r\n     interest, at a subsequent period, in promoting the settlement\r\n     of the pilgrims, under the direction of Mr. Brewster, on the\r\n     shores of the Atlantic. Scrooby must henceforth be regarded as\r\n     the cradle of Massachusetts. Here the choice and noble spirits,\r\n     at the head of whom were Brewster and Bradford, first learnt\r\n     the lessons of truth and freedom. Here, under the faithful\r\n     ministration of the pastors, they were nourished and\r\n     strengthened to that vigorous and manly fortitude which braved\r\n     all dangers; and here, too, they acquired that moral and\r\n     spiritual courage which enabled them to sacrifice their homes,\r\n     property, and friends, and expatriate themselves to distant\r\n     lands, rather than abandon their principles and yield to\r\n     attempted usurpations on the liberty of their consciences.\"\r\n\r\nThis information is interesting, and supplies a great _hiatus_ in the\r\nhistory, not of Robinson merely, but of the exiles and pilgrims\r\ngenerally. Perhaps further research may lead to the discovery of papers\r\nrelating to this obscure portion of English history, similar to those\r\nthat have thrown so much light on the times of Cromwell, and William and\r\nMary. The letters recently published by Lord Mahon and Mr. Manners\r\nSutton, are probably specimens only of the literary treasures stored in\r\nthe old manorial and other houses of England. We would have learned from\r\nthe editor of these volumes whether any inquiries have been made at\r\nScrooby and its neighborhood for confirming Mr. Hunter's conjectures. Be\r\nthis as it may, it is pleasant to believe, and on such good evidence,\r\nthat Robinson found a retreat in the home of his college-fellow and\r\nafter-associate Brewster, there to mature his views, and lay the\r\nfoundation of that religious life the fruits of which have have been so\r\nenduring.\r\n\r\nBut neither Scrooby, nor any other place, was secure from the\r\ninquisitorial interference of the high church functionaries. The spy and\r\nthe informer were abroad. No place of meeting could long remain a\r\nsecret--whether manorial halls, shopkeepers' storerooms, barns,\r\nhay-lofts, or the broad shadows of copse and forest. Go where they\r\nwould, the conscientious worshippers were sooner or later detected, and\r\ndragged as culprits before bishop or magistrate. But the chief objects\r\nof vengeance at this period were the Separatists. The Nonconformists\r\n(for, contrary to the opinion sometimes expressed on this subject, there\r\nwere Nonconformists, known by that name, long before there were\r\nSeparatists and Independents) were at first dealt with in a\r\ncomparatively gentle manner. They were censured, suspended, and, in some\r\ncases, imprisoned. Afterwards, as they multiplied and became more bold,\r\ngreater severity was exercised towards them. But never were they\r\nregarded in the same light, or treated in the same spirit, as the\r\nSeparatists. To object to the vestments and the ceremonies of the\r\nchurch, as the livery of Antichrist, was held to be extremely censurable\r\nand worthy of punishment; but to separate from the church altogether,\r\nand renounce all ecclesiastical allegiance, was an unpardonable offence.\r\nThe Nonconformists generally agreed in this latter judgment, and\r\nfrequently compounded for their own sins of omission by speaking and\r\nwriting against their brethren of the separation. There are many proofs\r\nof this, as may be seen in Stillingfleet's elaborate treatise on _The\r\nUnreasonableness of Separation_ published in 1681. The first part of\r\nthat work is devoted to an \"Historical Account of the Rise and Progress\r\nof the Controversie about Separation,\" and contains many references to\r\npersons, events, and writings that have been too much overlooked. As\r\nmight be expected, there is much in Stillingfleet's account that\r\nrequires correction. His prejudices against the Separatists were strong,\r\nand led him into several errors. But it is no very difficult task to\r\nwinnow the chaff from the wheat, and the result will amply repay the\r\nlabor. So far from having the sympathy of the Nonconformists or\r\nPuritans, the Separatists were pursued by them with greater virulence,\r\nin tracts, pamphlets, and larger publications, than by the bishops\r\nthemselves. The circumstance is not inexplicable. It has had its\r\nparallel in every succeeding period, to the present day. The\r\nNonconformists of modern times--the evangelical clergy of the church of\r\nEngland (for the _old_ word described those who remained _in_ the\r\nchurch, but did not conform in all respects to its prescribed\r\nceremonies)--the men who put their own construction on the Prayer Book,\r\nand explain away the plain meaning of the baptismal and other\r\noffices,--have always been found the most bitter opponents of a\r\nconscientious and consistent dissent. There are tendencies in human\r\nnature, not of a very recondite order, on which the fact may easily be\r\naccounted for.\r\n\r\nThis fact, in relation to the actual position of the exiles and\r\npilgrims, is too important to be overlooked. It is an additional\r\njustification of their conduct. If the Nonconformists had sympathized\r\nwith them to any extent, on the ground of their agreement respecting\r\nevangelical doctrine, they might have been induced to remain at home,\r\nenduring the violence of the storm which beat upon their devoted heads,\r\nin the hope that it might abate in time through their influence. But\r\nwhen they found their bitterest foes were these very men, it seemed time\r\nfor them to seek a home elsewhere.\r\n\r\nThe remainder of the story of Robinson's life must be briefly told. He\r\npassed to Amsterdam, with the third and last portion of the Scrooby\r\nSeparatists, in 1608; Smyth and Clyfton having preceded him with the two\r\nother companies about two years before. Mr. Ashton narrated the event in\r\nthe following words:--\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Robinson was now left with the remnant of the flock. Month\r\n     after month rolled away, and no abatement of the fury of the\r\n     dominant party was visible. His church, with himself, resolved\r\n     on following their companions to the United Provinces, where\r\n     toleration, if not perfect freedom, was allowed to all natives\r\n     and foreigners. Thrice was the attempt made at expatriation\r\n     before they could succeed. They first resolved to sail from\r\n     Boston. They formed a common fund and hired a vessel. To avoid\r\n     suspicion they embarked at night, and at the moment when they\r\n     expected the vessel to be loosed from her moorings, they were\r\n     betrayed by the captain and seized by the officers of the town.\r\n     They were plundered of their goods and money, arraigned before\r\n     the magistrates, and committed to prison till the pleasure of\r\n     the lords in council should be known. They were dismissed at\r\n     the expiration of a month, seven of the leading persons being\r\n     bound over to appear at the assizes. The following spring a\r\n     second attempt was made. They hired a small Dutch vessel, and\r\n     agreed to meet the captain at a given point on the banks of the\r\n     Humber, near Grimsby, Lincolnshire. After a delay of some\r\n     hours, a part of the company, chiefly men, were conveyed to the\r\n     vessel in a boat. When the sailors were about to return for\r\n     another portion of the passengers, the captain saw a great\r\n     company of horse and foot, with bills and guns, in full pursuit\r\n     of the fugitives on shore. He immediately hoisted sail, and\r\n     departed with the men he had on board, leaving their wives and\r\n     children, and the remainder of the pilgrim company, with Mr.\r\n     Robinson, to the tender mercies of their pursuers. A few of the\r\n     party escaped, the others were seized and hurried from one\r\n     magistrate to another, till the officers, not knowing what to\r\n     do with so large a company, and ashamed of their occupation in\r\n     seizing helpless, homeless, and innocent persons, they suffered\r\n     them to depart and go whither they pleased. Other attempts at\r\n     expatriation were subsequently and successfully made. The\r\n     persecuted Separatists at length reached the hospitable shores\r\n     of Holland, and rejoined their families and friends in the land\r\n     of strangers, thankful to their Almighty Father that they had\r\n     escaped in safety, from the 'fury of the oppressor,' and the\r\n     perils of the deep.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1609, Robinson with his people removed to Leyden, where he spent the\r\nremainder of his days, building up the church in the truth, laying broad\r\nand deep in the minds of the Pilgrim fathers the principles which fitted\r\nthem to become the founders of America's future greatness, and writing\r\nthose works which constitute his noblest memorial, and have yet a\r\nmission to fulfil in our own and succeeding ages.\r\n\r\nThe fame of Robinson rests principally on three things: first, his\r\nrelation to the pilgrims; secondly, his personal and public character;\r\nand lastly, the force--we had almost said genius--displayed in his\r\nvarious publications. The peculiarity of Robinson's character may be\r\ndescribed by one word, completeness--_totus atque teres rotundus_. The\r\nunited testimony of admirers and opponents witnesses his integrity,\r\npurity, courtesy, prudence, and charity. But he possessed other\r\nqualities. He was chiefly distinguished by what we venture to call a\r\nvery rare characteristic, in the sense in which we understand it,--an\r\nintense love of truth, which ever stimulated him to search after it as\r\nthe chief part of his being's aim and end, and which never permitted him\r\nto swerve a hair's breath from it in practice. This made him a\r\nnonconformist, a separatist, an exile, an independent; a growing\r\nChristian, a profound theologian, an able controversialist; a student at\r\nLeyden University, although he had previously graduated and held a\r\nfellowship at Cambridge; a diligent attendant on the lectures of both\r\nPolyander and Episcopus, at the time when all Leyden was agitated by the\r\nrival theories of the two professors on the subject of Arminianism; and\r\nan avowed advocate of the principle, that though Christian men were\r\nconfirmed in their own doctrinal and ecclesiastical principles, it was\r\ntheir duty to hear what their opponents had to say, even if it should\r\nlead them to the parish church.\r\n\r\nThis love of truth was both a principle and a passion. It grew with his\r\ngrowth, strengthened with his strength, and was the chief source of all\r\nhis excellence. It made him learned in a learned age, and wise in the\r\nknowledge of human nature and the experience of the world, at a period\r\nwhen such wisdom was rare. It fitted him to be the counsellor of his\r\nfellow-exiles in the emergencies of their strange position, and the\r\nstatesman-like adviser of the pilgrims when they went forth to clear the\r\nwilderness, and lay the foundations of civil life afresh in a new world.\r\nIn a word, he may be said to have lived in the spirit of his own\r\naphorism;--\"He that knows not in his measure, what he ought to know,\r\nespecially in the matters of God, is but a beast amongst men; he that\r\nknows what is simply needful and no more, is a man amongst men; _but he\r\nwho knows according to the help vouchsafed him of God, what may well be\r\nknown, and so far as to direct himself and others aright, is as a God\r\namongst men_.\"\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to do justice to the writings of Robinson in a brief\r\nnotice like the present: yet it is on these writings that we are\r\ndisposed chiefly to rest his claims to future regard. They are not like\r\nthose of Milton, \"one perfect field of cloth of gold;\" nor like those of\r\nTaylor, enlivened by figures and images that captivate the fancy and\r\nimpress the heart; but they have what to some possesses an equal charm,\r\nin the full orbed light they cast on some of the most abstruse\r\ndoctrines, and on some of the most controverted questions of revealed\r\nand practical religion. Excepting a few obsolete expressions here and\r\nthere, the language is perfectly clear and comprehensible after more\r\nthan two centuries; indeed, more clear and comprehensible to ordinary\r\nreaders than that which pervades a large portion of the so-called\r\nelegant literature of the past and present age. It is the language of\r\nShakspeare and Bacon, without the measure of the one, or the involution\r\nof the other--that language which has ever been the vernacular of the\r\npeople of this country, and to which our best writers are coming\r\nback--clear, terse, good old English.\r\n\r\nSome may take exception to the _form_ of these writings, because they\r\nare chiefly controversial; but no objection can be more futile. England\r\nis glorious through controversy, and nowhere has her mind put on more of\r\nmight than on the battle-field of truth. Her greatest works are in this\r\nvery form. What were left to us of the Hookers and Barrows, Taylors and\r\nMiltons, if their controversial writings were excepted? and, indeed,\r\nwhat would become of our Nonconformist literature itself, if this\r\nobjection were allowed a practical weight. Whosoever would have\r\nknowledge respecting doctrines and principles still unsettled, in\r\nreligion or in science, must seek it in such debate or be altogether\r\ndisappointed. Nowhere will the nonconformists and dissenters find more\r\nof truth--and in some particulars of _new_ truth--in relation to their\r\nown principles and duties, than in these volumes. Even the independents\r\nhave still much to learn from this master in Israel. While on some\r\npoints we hold Robinson to have been altogether wrong; on others--and\r\nthese not trivial, but important points--we hold that he is nearly as\r\nmuch in advance of the present age as he was of his own, because he\r\nadheres more closely than even religious men are ordinarily wont to do,\r\nto the spirit and genius of those older Scriptures which have yet to\r\nliberate a world from all but invulnerable superstitions.\r\n\r\nBesides the Memoir, the first of the volumes before us contains an\r\naccount of the descendants of Robinson, from the pen of Dr. Allen, of\r\nNorthampton, Massachusetts, from which it appears that they are \"very\r\nnumerous, scattered over New England and other States of the Union, and\r\noccupying respectable and useful stations in life.\" Then come \"New\r\nEssays; or Observations, Divine and Moral, collected out of the Holy\r\nScriptures, ancient and modern writers, both divine and human; as also\r\nout of the great volume of men's manners; tending to the furtherance of\r\nknowledge and virtue.\" We give the title in full, because it is the best\r\nand briefest description we can give of the work itself. The most\r\ncursory perusal is sufficient to show the erudition of the author, and a\r\ncomparatively slight examination raises our estimation of his sagacity\r\nand wisdom. These essays, the last productions of his pen, are not\r\nunworthy of circulation with those of Lord Bacon, of which they\r\nfrequently remind us by apt allusions, sententious definitions,\r\nclear-headed distinctions, and sharp antitheses, no less than by\r\nprofound insight into the workings of human nature. We had marked\r\npassages for quotation, which our limits will not permit. One, however,\r\nwe must cite, for the incidental light it throws on the character of\r\nRobinson as a speaker and preacher. We are not aware that any of his\r\ncontemporaries have remarked upon the peculiarity thus disclosed; but it\r\naccords with the judgment otherwise formed of the man. In an essay\r\nentitled, \"Of Speech and Silence,\" containing the pith and marrow of all\r\nCarlyle has written on the subject, without any of his exaggeration, we\r\nhave:\r\n\r\n     \"Both length and shortness of speech may be used commendably in\r\n     their time; as mariners sometimes sail with larger spread, and\r\n     sometimes with narrower-gathered sails. But as some are large\r\n     in speech out of abundance of matter, and upon due\r\n     consideration; so the most multiply words, either from weakness\r\n     or vanity. Wise men suspect and examine their words ere they\r\n     suffer them to pass from them, and to speak the more sparingly;\r\n     but fools pour out theirs by talents, without fear or wit.\r\n     Besides, wise men speak to purpose, and so have but something\r\n     to say: the others speak every thing of every thing, and,\r\n     therefore, take liberty to use long wanderings. Lastly, they\r\n     think to make up that in number, or repetition of words, which\r\n     is wanting in weight. But above all other motives, some better,\r\n     some worse, too many love to hear themselves speak; and\r\n     imagining vainly that they please others, because they please\r\n     themselves, make long orations when a little were too much.\r\n     Some excuse their tediousness, saying, that they cannot speak\r\n     shorter; wherein they both say untruly, and shame themselves\r\n     also; for it is all one as if they said that they have\r\n     unbridled tongues, and inordinate passions setting them a-work.\r\n     _I have been many times drawn so dry, that I could not well\r\n     speak any longer for want of matter: but I ever could speak as\r\n     short as I would._\"\r\n\r\nThe remainder of this volume is occupied by \"A Defence of the Doctrine\r\npropounded by the Synod at Dort\", able, full of close reasoning and\r\nScripture exposition, and worthy of careful perusal, whether the\r\nconclusions be admitted or not.\r\n\r\nThe second volume is occupied with Robinson's greatest controversial\r\nwork, \"A Justification of Separation from the Church of England,\" &c. It\r\nis elaborate and complete; and, besides vindicating the separatists of\r\nthat day, pronounces on many questions on which dissenters have yet to\r\nmake up their minds. In this work he classes himself with the Brownists;\r\nfrom which it may be inferred, that his advice to the pilgrims, to\r\n\"shake off the name of Brownist,\" is not to be interpreted very largely,\r\nas has sometimes been the case. It is the _name_ that he chiefly\r\nabjures. The following passage from the introduction to this performance\r\nwill illustrate the manner in which Robinson vindicated his\r\nco-religionists from the misrepresentations of that age:\r\n\r\n     \"The difference you lay down touching the proper subject of the\r\n     power of Christ, is true in itself, and only yours wherein it\r\n     is corruptly related, and especially in the particular\r\n     concerning us, as, that where 'the Papists plant the ruling\r\n     power of Christ in the Pope; the Protestants in the Bishops;\r\n     the Puritans,' as you term the reformed churches and those of\r\n     their mind 'in the Presbytery;' we whom you name 'Brownists,'\r\n     put it in the 'body of the congregation, the multitude called\r\n     the church:' odiously insinuating against us that we do exclude\r\n     the elders in the case of government, where, on the contrary,\r\n     we profess the bishops or elders to be the only ordinary\r\n     governors in the church, as in all other actions of the\r\n     church's communion, so also in the censures. Only we may not\r\n     acknowledge them for lords over God's heritage, (1 Pet. v. 3,)\r\n     as you would make them, controlling all, but to be controlled\r\n     by none; much less essential unto the church, as though it\r\n     could not be without them; least of all the church itself, as\r\n     you and others expound. (Matt. xviii.)\"\r\n\r\nThe third volume contains four treatises and some shorter pieces,\r\nchiefly letters. The first treatise is the celebrated \"Apology,\"\r\noriginally published in Latin, in 1619, and afterwards translated into\r\nEnglish by Robinson himself, although not published in the last form\r\nuntil 1625. It is to the use of the word \"independently,\" in the first\r\nchapter, that some have attributed the origin of the name Independent,\r\nas the designation of the party of which Robinson was so eminent a\r\nmember. It appears, however, that Jacob had used the same term, for the\r\nsame purpose, as early as 1612; and the denominational title had become\r\nfixed before 1622, since Bishop Hall speaks of the \"anarchical fashion\r\nof independent congregations\" in one of his publications of that year.\r\nThe principle of congregationalism, as opposed to nationalism and\r\ncatholicism, is nowhere more fully established than in this admirable\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe remaining treatises are on Religious Communion, Exercise of\r\nProphecy, and the Lawfulness of Hearing Ministers of the Church of\r\nEngland. The first discriminates between personal and public fellowship,\r\nand lays down the position that the former is allowable between all\r\nChristians, recognizing one another as such, whatever their differences\r\nrespecting minor points and church polity. The second is a scriptural\r\nexposition of the subject of lay-preaching, as it is now termed. The\r\nthird is a defence of those who occasionally, and merely for the sake of\r\nhearing, attend upon the ministrations of the established clergy. An\r\nappendix to this volume contains an interesting account of the\r\ncongregational church in Southwark, of which Henry Jacob was the first\r\npastor; by the present pastor, the Rev. John Waddington; a sketch of the\r\nexiles and their churches in Holland, by the editor; and an index of\r\nsubjects and authors.\r\n\r\nWe cannot conclude this notice without congratulating the editor and his\r\nnumerous coadjutors, on the satisfactory manner in which these volumes\r\nhave been prepared for publication, and on the success that has attended\r\nthe undertaking.\r\n\r\n[The life of John Robinson of Leyden is more strictly a portion of\r\nAmerican than of English history, and its suitable exhibition demands\r\nthe best abilities that can be summoned to such service in this country,\r\nwhere, hitherto, the popular declamation of Puritan celebrations, it\r\nmust be confessed, has evinced but a superficial acquaintance with\r\nPuritan intelligence, doctrine, or character.]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[18] The works of John Robinson, Pastor of the Pilgrim Fathers; with a\r\nMemoir and Annotations. By Robert Ashton, Secretary of the\r\nCongregational Board, London. Three volumes. London; 1851.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Chambers's Edinburgh Journal.\r\n\r\nA CHAPTER ON CATS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe newspapers have recently been chronicling, as a fact provocative of\r\nespecial wonder, the enterprise of some speculative merchant of\r\nNew-York, who has just been dispatching a cargo of one hundred cats to\r\nthe republic of New Granada, in which it would appear the race, owing,\r\nas we may believe, to the frequently disturbed state of the country, has\r\nbecome almost extinct.\r\n\r\nYour cat is a domestic animal, and naturally conservative in its\r\ntastes--averse, therefore, to uproar, and to all those given to change.\r\nIts propensities are to meditation and contemplative tranquillity, for\r\nwhich reason it has been held in reverence by nations of a similar staid\r\nand composed disposition, and has been the favorite companion and\r\nconstant friend of grave philosophers and thoughtful students. By the\r\nancient Egyptians cats were held in the highest esteem; and we learn\r\nfrom Diodorus Siculus, their \"lives and safeties\" were tendered more\r\ndearly than those of any other animal, whether biped or quadruped. \"He\r\nwho has voluntarily killed a consecrated animal,\" says this writer, \"is\r\npunished with death; but if any one has even involuntarily killed a cat\r\nor an ibis, it is impossible for him to escape death: the mob drags him\r\nto it, treating him with every cruelty, and sometimes without waiting\r\nfor judgment to be passed. This treatment inspires such terror, that, if\r\nany person happen to find one of these animals dead, he goes to a\r\ndistance from it, and by his cries and groans indicates that he has\r\nfound the animal dead. This superstition is so deeply rooted in the\r\nminds of the Egyptians, and the respect they bear these animals is so\r\nprofound, that at the time when their king, Ptolemy, was not yet\r\ndeclared the friend of the Roman people--when they were paying all\r\npossible court to travellers from Italy, and their fears made them avoid\r\nevery ground of accusation and every pretext for making war upon\r\nthem--yet a Roman having killed a cat, the people rushed to his house,\r\nand neither the entreaties of the grandees, whom the king sent for the\r\npurpose, nor the terror of the Roman name, could protect this man from\r\npunishment, although the act was involuntary. I do not relate this\r\nanecdote,\" adds the historian, \"on the authority of another, for I was\r\nan eye-witness of it during my stay in Egypt.\"[19]\r\n\r\nDuring their lives, the consecrated cats were fed upon fish, kept for\r\nthe purpose in tanks; and \"when one of them happened to die,\" says the\r\nveracious writer just cited, \"it was wrapped in linen, and after the\r\nbystanders had beaten themselves on the breast, it was carried to the\r\nTarichoea, where it was embalmed with coedria and other substances\r\nwhich have the virtue of embalming bodies, after which it was interred\r\nin the sacred monument.\" It has puzzled not a little the learned\r\narchæologists, who have endeavored to discover a profound philosophy\r\nfigured and symbolized in the singular mythology of the Egyptians, to\r\nexplain how it is that in Thebes, where the sacred character of the cat\r\nwas held in the highest reverence, and cherished with the greatest\r\ndevotion, not only embalmed cats have been found, but also the bodies of\r\nrats and mice, which had been subjected to the same anti-putrescent\r\nprocess. If, however, Herodotus is to be credited, the Egyptians owed a\r\ndeep debt of gratitude to the mice; for the venerable historian assures\r\nus, and on the unquestionable authority of the Egyptian priests, that\r\nwhen Sennacherib and his army lay at Pelusium, a mighty corps of\r\nfield-mice entered the camp by night, and eating up the quivers,\r\nbowstrings, and buckler-leathers of the Assyrian troops, in this summary\r\nfashion liberated Egypt from the terror of the threatened invasion.\r\nProbably the existence of mice-mummies may be accounted for in this way,\r\nand if--resorting to no violent supposition--we presume in the good work\r\nwhich the tiny patriots so sagaciously accomplished that their\r\ncousins-german the rats were assistant, the whole matter receives a\r\nsatisfactory explanation. The hypothesis, it is submitted, is not\r\nwithout plausible recommendations on its behalf. There is extant a\r\nfragment of a comedy, entitled \"The Cities,\" written by the Rhodian poet\r\nAnaxandrides, in which the Egyptian worship of animals is amusingly\r\nenough quizzed. A translation will be found in Dr. Prichard's _Analysis\r\nof Egyptian Mythology_. The lines referring to cat-worship are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    \"You cry and wail whene'er ye spy a cat,\r\n    Starving or sick; I count it not a sin\r\n    To hang it up, and flay it for its skin;\"\r\n\r\nfrom which it appears this gay free-thinker was not only somewhat\r\nskeptical in his religious notions, but, moreover, a hard-hearted,\r\ngood-for-nothing fellow--one who, had he lived in our time, would\r\nunquestionably have brought himself within the sweep of the Society for\r\nthe Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, and the Duke of Beaufort's\r\nHumanity Act.\r\n\r\nWe learn from Herodotus that in his days it was customary, whenever a\r\ncat died, for the whole household at once to go into mourning, and this\r\nalthough the lamented decease might have been the result of old age, or\r\nother causes purely natural. In the case of a cat's death, however, the\r\neyebrows only were required to be shaved off; but when a dog, a beast of\r\nmore distinguished reputation, departed this life, every inmate of the\r\nhouse was expected to shave his head and whole body all over. Both cats\r\nand dogs are watched and attended to with the greatest solicitude during\r\nillness. Indeed by the ancient Egyptians the cat was treated much in the\r\nsame way as are dogs amongst us: we find them even accompanying their\r\nmasters on their aquatic shooting-excursions; and, if the testimony of\r\nancient monuments is to be relied on, often catching the game for them,\r\nalthough it may be permitted to doubt whether they ever actually took to\r\nthe water for this purpose.\r\n\r\nIn modern Egypt the cat, although more docile and companionable than its\r\nEuropean sister, has much degenerated; but still, on account of its\r\nusefulness in destroying scorpions and other reptiles, it is treated\r\nwith some consideration--suffered to eat out of the same dish with the\r\nchildren, to join with them in their sports, and to be their constant\r\ncompanion and daily friend. A modern Egyptian would esteem it a heinous\r\nsin, indeed, to destroy or even maltreat a cat; and we are told by Sir\r\nGardner Wilkinson, that benevolent individuals have bequeathed funds by\r\nwhich a certain number of these animals are daily fed at Cairo at the\r\nCadi's court, and the bazaar of Khan Khaleel.\r\n\r\nBut a tender regard for the inferior animals is a prevailing\r\ncharacteristic of the Oriental races, and is inculcated as a duty by\r\ntheir various religions. At Fez there was, and perhaps is at this day, a\r\nwealthily-endowed hospital, the greater part of the funds of which was\r\ndevoted to the support and medical treatment of invalid cranes and\r\nstorks, and procuring them a decent sepulture whenever they chanced to\r\ndie. The founders are said to have entertained the poetical notion that\r\nthese birds are, in truth, human beings, natives of distant islands, who\r\nat certain periods assume a foreign shape, and after they have satisfied\r\ntheir curiosity with visiting other lands, return to their own, and\r\nresume their original form.\r\n\r\nTo return, however, not to our sheep, but our cats, we must remark that,\r\nin modern times, in spite of the kindness the cat habitually receives in\r\nEgypt, his _morale_ is not in that country rated very high--the\r\nuniversal impression being that, although, like Snug the joiner's lion,\r\nhe is by nature \"a very gentle beast,\" still he is by no means \"of a\r\ngood conscience;\" that he is, in short, a most ungrateful beast; and\r\nthat when, in a future state, it is asked of him how he has been treated\r\nby man in this, he will obstinately deny all the benefits he has\r\nreceived at his hand, and give him such a character for cruelty and\r\nhardness of heart as is shocking to think of. The dog, however, it is\r\nunderstood, will conduct himself more discreetly, and readily\r\nacknowledge the good offices for which he is indebted to the family of\r\nmankind.\r\n\r\nSingular anecdotes have been related of the intense repugnance persons\r\nhave been found to entertain to these, at worst, harmless animals. One\r\nshall be given in the very words of the Rev. Nicholas Wanley, who, in\r\nhis authentic _Wonders of the Little World_, has recorded a number of\r\nother facts quite as marvellous, and sustained by testimony not one whit\r\nmore exceptionable: \"Mathiolus tells of a German, who coming in\r\nwintertime into an inn to sup with him and some other of his friends,\r\nthe woman of the house being acquainted with his temper (lest he should\r\ndepart at the sight of a young cat which she kept to breed up), had\r\nbeforehand hid her kitling in a chest in the same room where we sat at\r\nsupper. But though he had neither seen nor heard it, yet after some time\r\nthat he had sucked in the air infected by the cat's breath, that quality\r\nof his temperament that had antipathy to that creature being provoked,\r\nhe sweat, and, of a sudden, paleness came over his face, and to the\r\nwonder of us all that were present, he cried out that in some corner of\r\nthe room there was a cat that lay hid.\" Not long after the battle of\r\nWagram and the second occupation of Vienna by the French, an\r\naide-de-camp of Napoleon, who at the time occupied, together with his\r\nsuite, the Palace of Schönbrunn, was proceeding to bed at an unusually\r\nlate hour, when, on passing the door of Napoleon's bedroom, he was\r\nsurprised by a most singular noise, and repeated calls from the Emperor\r\nfor assistance. Opening the door hastily, and rushing into the room, a\r\nsingular spectacle presented itself--the great soldier of the age, half\r\nundressed, his countenance agitated, the beaded drops of perspiration\r\nstanding on his brow, in his hand his victorious sword, with which he\r\nwas making frequent and convulsive lunges at some invisible enemy\r\nthrough the tapestry that lined the walls. It was a cat that had\r\nsecreted herself in this place; and Napoleon held cats not so much in\r\nabhorrence as in terror. \"A feather,\" says the poet, \"daunts the brave;\"\r\nand a greater poet, through the mouth of his Shylock, remarks that\r\n\"there are some that are mad if they behold a cat--a harmless, necessary\r\ncat.\" Count Bertram would seem to have shared in this unaccountable\r\naversion. When \"Monsieur Parolles, the gallant militarist, that had the\r\nwhole theory of war in the knot of his scarf, and the practice in the\r\nshape of his dagger,\" was convicted of mendacity and cowardice, Bertram\r\nexclaimed, \"I could endure any thing before this but a cat, and now he's\r\na cat to me.\" The fores of censure could no further go.\r\n\r\nIf Napoleon, however, held cats, as has been averred, in positive fear,\r\nthere have been others, and some of them illustrious captains, that have\r\nregarded them with other feelings. Marshall Turenne could amuse himself\r\nfor hours in playing with his kittens; and the great general, Lord\r\nHeathfield, would often appear on the walls of Gibraltar, at the time of\r\nthe famous siege, attended by his favorite cat. Cardinal Richelieu was\r\nalso fond of cats; and when we have enumerated the names of Cowper and\r\nDr. Johnson, of Thomas Gray and Isaac Newton, and, above all, of the\r\ntender-hearted and meditative Montaigne, the list is far from complete\r\nof those who have bestowed on the feline race some portion of their\r\naffections.\r\n\r\nButler, in his _Hudibras_, observes in an oft-quoted passage, that\r\n\r\n    \"Montaigne, playing with his cat,\r\n    Complains she thought him but an ass.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the annotator on this passage, in explanation, adds, that \"Montaigne\r\nin his Essays supposes his cat thought him a fool for losing his time in\r\nplaying with her;\" but, under favor, this is a misinterpretation of the\r\nessayist's sentiments, and something like a libel on the capacity of\r\nboth himself and cat. Montaigne's words are: \"When I play with my cat,\r\nwho knows whether I do not make her more sport than she makes me? We\r\nmutually divert each other with our play. If I have my hour to begin or\r\nrefuse, so also has she hers.\" Nobody who has read the striking essay in\r\nwhich these words appear could a moment misconceive their author's\r\nmeaning. He is vindicating natural theology from the objections of some\r\nof its opponents, and in the course of his argument he takes occasion to\r\ndwell on the wonderful instincts, and almost rational sagacity of the\r\ninferior animals. We must, however, lament that, although he does full\r\njustice to the \"half-reasoning elephant,\" to the aptitude and fidelity\r\nof the dog, to the marvellous economical arrangements of the bees, and\r\neven to the imitative capacity of the magpie, he pays no higher tribute\r\nto the merits of the cat than that she is as capable of being amused as\r\nhimself, and like himself, too, has her periods of gravity when\r\nrecreative sports are distasteful. Her social qualities he does not\r\nallude to, though he, so eminently social himself, could scarcely have\r\nfailed to appreciate them.\r\n\r\nIn this country, at this time, cats have superseded parlor favorites\r\ndecidedly less agreeable in their appearance, and infinitely more\r\nmischievous in their habits. Writing in the seventeenth century, Burton\r\nin his _Anatomy of Melancholy_, remarks that \"Turkey gentlewomen, that\r\nare perpetual prisoners, still mewed up according to the custom of the\r\nplace, have little else, beside their household business or to play with\r\ntheir children, to drive away time but to dally with their cats, which\r\nthey have _in delitiis_, as many of our ladies and gentlewomen use\r\nmonkeys and little dogs.\" It is not the least merit of the cat that it\r\nhas banished from our sitting-rooms those frightful mimicries of\r\nhumanity--the monkey tribe; and as to the little dogs Tray, Blanch, and\r\nSweetheart, although we are not insensible to their many virtues and\r\nutilities, we care not to see them sleeping on our hearth-rugs, or\r\nreposing beside our work-tables.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[19] In the matter of fanaticism, the modern Egyptians, or rather the\r\ninhabitants of Alexandria, seem hardly to have degenerated from their\r\nethnic \"forbears\" as we read in Mr. J. A. St. John's travels the account\r\nof a serious insurrection which broke out some years ago in that city,\r\nin consequence of certain Jews having taken up the butchers' trade, and\r\nhaving slain the meat with a knife having _three_ instead of _five\r\nnails_ in the handle!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the Dublin University Magazine.\r\n\r\nTHE HEIRS OF RANDOLPH ABBEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nI. THE MEETING IN THE STORM.\r\n\r\nThere was a wild storm out at sea--a storm by night--the winds and the\r\nwaves had begun to lift up their voices just when the tumult of the\r\nworld was hushed in the silent darkness, so that on the earth all was\r\ntranquillity, while the ocean raged in fury: it was as though that\r\nspirit of unrest which haunts the hearts of men, having been driven out\r\nof them by the charm of sleep, had taken refuge here among the boiling\r\nwaters, and prepared to hold a frantic revel. The mad sea was a fitting\r\nfield for such a guest, and the fierce sport they made together seemed\r\ndesigned for a mocking imitation of the stormy human passions, which\r\nconvulsed the land by day.\r\n\r\nThere was a mimic war in heaven--the thunder, for artillery, and the\r\nshock of the electric clouds, like the meeting armies when\r\nfellow-mortals do battle for destruction; then the beautiful lightning\r\nwas as the flashing hopes that gleam in at times on the darkness of the\r\nsoul, and often blast it in the passing of their fatal brightness. The\r\nwaves leapt, and rose, and sunk to rise no more, like men wrestling for\r\nhappiness and finding a grave, and over as the tempest swept by the rain\r\nwent with it, wildly weeping, as though its big, bursting drops were the\r\nfrantic tears of an earthly despair.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all this senseless strife, a ship went struggling\r\nhelplessly. It was a piteous thing to see it, for it was so like a human\r\nbeing, straining every nerve to keep above whelming waves; strong as\r\nfate the billows bore it up towards the very heaven, then dashed it\r\ndown, and trampled on it like a fallen enemy; but the stout old oak\r\nstood the shock, and as yet the good planks held together, though the\r\ndanger was imminent, and not one on board expected to see the light of\r\nanother day.\r\n\r\nThe scene on deck was very striking, for human nature was there stripped\r\nof all disguise and all self-deceit before the presence of death. Pride\r\nand ambition, ostentation and avarice--the fallacies of the world, the\r\ncomplacent lies of society, the hopes and griefs that were of earth\r\nalone--all unrealities, in short, had passed for these shivering,\r\nhelpless beings, with the life that seemed receding from them--that hour\r\nof horror revealed them to themselves and to others: there would be no\r\nmore smiling lips over blackest hearts; no more bold looks over craven\r\nspirits; those murderous waters, as they dashed them to and fro, wrung\r\nfrom them the very secrets of their souls.\r\n\r\nThere were some there who carried a fair name through the world, and won\r\nhonor and praise for their virtuous living, that now shrieked out to the\r\npitiless winds, the detail of crimes which had deformed their soul\r\nunseen. There were others who had seemed full of love to the beings who\r\ncherished them, and now stole the rope or the spar from their straining\r\nhands, that they might save themselves therewith whilst they left these\r\nto perish; but still, whatever shape the frenzy of that perishing crew\r\nmight take, whether their cries were of remorse, or prayer, or impotent\r\nrage, but one desire and instinct seemed to animate them all--the desire\r\ninto which every energy of their soul was gathered up and\r\nconcentrated--for the mortal life that was being rent from their\r\npassionate grasp.\r\n\r\nLife! life! it had been to many of them a torturer, full of anguish and\r\ndisappointments--a hard taskmaster, driving them on from day to day with\r\nweary feet and heavy heart, as over arid deserts where no sweet waters\r\nwere springing from the wells of human love, or friendship, to slake\r\ntheir thirst for sympathy; they had prayed for death, they had writhed\r\nin the power of this life, and sought to be rid of it, as a prisoner of\r\nhis bonds,--and now, when the bubbling waves came sweeping over the deck\r\nto their very throat, there uprose in each heart such an intensity of\r\nlove for it, that all other thoughts were swallowed up in this one\r\nburning wish. They cared not who perished round them, the dearest and\r\nthe best; they cared not what torments it might bring them in the\r\nfuture, only let them not feel its warm breath departing from their\r\nlips, its throbbing from their heart.\r\n\r\nNow, in the midst of all these beings hanging between life and\r\ndeath--maddened by their terror for the one, and their passion for the\r\nother--there were two who maintained a perfect serenity, and looked with\r\nquiet eye and smiling face, upon the boiling surge which threatened to\r\ningulf them. The first of these was a young girl, who had been lashed to\r\na mast, against which she leant quite motionless; she was one of those\r\nsweet spring flowers, whose bright and joyous aspect shows, that they\r\nhave known only the sunshine of life's early day; no sorrow as yet had\r\nchecked those bounding feet, that loved to spring so lightly over\r\nwoodland paths, nor hushed the carol of that gladsome voice, which\r\nrivalled the summer bird in melody; cloudless and pure were her eyes as\r\nthe sky at dawn--fresh the soul within her as the morning dew; the\r\nbeauty of guilelessness, and of a heart at rest, shed a light around her\r\nwhich had an indescribable charm. It was a strange thing to see her\r\nthere, looking out so serenely on the war of the elements; whilst others\r\nwept and raved, no sound was heard from her, and though strong men lay\r\nwrithing at her feet in a paroxysm of terror, no thrill of fear shook\r\nher tender frame; calmly she stood, her white garments shining in the\r\nnight, like the pure robes of some angel of peace; her sweet face shaded\r\nby the golden glory of her long flowing hair, her fair hands folded over\r\nher tranquil bosom, and a faint smile lingering on her parted lips,\r\nlike the soft light of a reflected moonbeam, on the still waters of a\r\nlucid lake.\r\n\r\nThere was one there who, even in that hour of tumult and distress, could\r\nnot choose but look on her in her marvellous tranquillity; he, like\r\nherself, was calm--the only other in all that trembling crew who faced\r\ndeath with indifference. But it was sufficient to look upon his\r\ncountenance to read the secret of his silent courage; strange it was,\r\nindeed, that she--so young, so fair, so like a snow-white lily--should\r\nbe ready to fall without a sigh into the embrace of the deadly\r\ncorruption; but it was no marvel that this man should be well content to\r\nfeel on his strong, passionate heart, the iron grasp which alone would\r\nstill its beating. A noble face was his, bearing the marked evidence of\r\na powerful mind, a resolute spirit, and a generous heart; but it was so\r\nsorrowfully stern, so deeply shadowed with the gloom of some great\r\ndarkness which lay upon his soul, that it was plain the bitterness of\r\nlife alone had engendered this recklessness of death.\r\n\r\nThey had never met before, these two. She was so young, and he already\r\nwell-nigh past his prime, for he had numbered some forty years; yet now\r\nthe attraction of a common sentiment drew them towards one another as\r\nthough they had been kindred spirits. He was gazing intently upon her,\r\nwhen she turned her bright, candid eyes towards him, and smiled. She\r\nseemed willing to answer the question his looks were asking, concerning\r\nthe reason of her fearlessness in this great peril. There was a\r\nmomentary lull in the storm, and he suddenly walked towards her. It was\r\nno time for the courtesies of the world, and he did not hesitate to\r\naddress her. \"How is it that you alone can meet this appalling danger in\r\nsuch perfect calm?\" She answered him at once, as frankly as he spoke,\r\nwith a confiding, childlike smile upon her lips. \"Because life, so far\r\nas I have known it, has been so happy and so beautiful, that I believe\r\ndeath must be more beautiful and happy still.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a marvellous doctrine; where can you have learned such untenable\r\nphilosophy?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know what philosophy means. I have but said what I have been\r\ntaught by one who was my master. Life, which is a mystery, came to me\r\nunasked, and I found it a most joyful thing; if death, a deeper mystery,\r\ncome alike unsought, why should I doubt it will be a yet more precious\r\ngift? But look!\" she continued eagerly, \"is it not true that the storm\r\nis abating?--the sailors are working cheerfully. Surely there is hope.\r\nOh! say that it is so; for, though I do not dread death, because I\r\nbelieve that its gloom conceals some glorious joy, I do fear such\r\npassage to it as this--the actual pain, the horror of drowning, the\r\nsinking, choked and struggling, into that dark sea. Tell me, shall we\r\nlive?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he answered slowly, as he looked around the scene, where all gave\r\ntoken that the tempest's wrath was spent. \"I think, indeed, that the\r\ndanger is over; I think that we are saved. You may hear it in the\r\nexulting of these trembling wretches who, but a few minutes since, were\r\ncrawling on the deck in abject supplication. Well, they have what they\r\nasked, and soon they will curse the hour when their request was\r\ngranted.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked at him with an innocent surprise in her large, clear eyes.\r\nShe seemed to think him a being of a different nature from herself. At\r\nlast she spoke. \"And now, since we two alone seemed well content to die,\r\nwhen all others raved and shrieked for life, will you tell me why it was\r\nthat you were thus willing to be done of earth; for I can see it was not\r\nbecause you believe, as I do, beauty, and goodness, and love in all\r\nthings, however dark and strange they seem as yet?\"\r\n\r\n\"And did your master teach you,\" he said, with a bitter smile, \"that\r\nthere is beauty in suffering?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes! in suffering, in pain, and death; for he said that beneath their\r\nstern aspect there lay hidden treasures that were immortal, blessings\r\ncrowning us with stingless joy; but if you fear suffering, why do you\r\nnot fear to die: they say there is a pang in dying?\"\r\n\r\n\"You answered my question, and I must answer yours; but it were better\r\nfor you not to know that such things can be in this world. I did not\r\nfear, or rather I courted, the last struggle, because I have found the\r\nagony of life sharper than the agony of death can be.\" He turned away\r\nabruptly, as he spoke, and seemed desirous to close the interview; and\r\ntruly it was a strange conversation which had taken place between those\r\ntwo, in the midst of that fierce, stormy night, with the waters gaping\r\nopen-mouthed for both their lives. It could not have occurred at all\r\nunder other circumstances. Two strangers could not thus have told out\r\ntheir secret thoughts, had they not been driven by uncontrollable\r\nimpulse to a close companionship, because of the communion of feeling\r\nwhich seemed to inspire both in that tremendous hour; but now that it\r\nwas past, that they must re-enter on the ordinary routine of life, the\r\nwords they had not scrupled to say to one another appeared to them both\r\nas some strange, wild dream. When they met again, it was as though they\r\nnever had departed from the ordinary customs of society. Yet this brief\r\nconversation was destined to have a weighty influence on the lives of\r\nboth of them.\r\n\r\nTheir next meeting was in the morning, when all traces of the midnight\r\nstorm had passed away--when, brighter and more beautiful than ever\r\nbefore, the earth, and the sky, and the daylight seemed to the eyes that\r\nhad looked on death so near. The passengers were all collected on deck\r\nonce more, as they had been when the tempest was raging; but now it was\r\nthat they might weep fears of delight as they felt the glow of the\r\nsunshine--that they might revel in the very throbbing of their pulses,\r\nwhich told how the warm life-blood was careering, unchecked, through\r\ntheir hearts.\r\n\r\nSoon, however, the memory of their danger passed away, like a hateful\r\ndream, and they began, according to the nature of men, to occupy\r\nthemselves, with a sort of unconscious interest, in the actual\r\ncircumstances passing before them.\r\n\r\nThe ship in which they were embarked was bound, from the coast of\r\nIreland to that of England. Her ultimate destination was a seaport town\r\nin Devon; but at present she had suddenly swerved from her course, and\r\nwas making for the land just where a tract of richly-wooded country\r\nattracted the eye by the luxuriance of its vegetation, and the evident\r\ntraces of that care and cultivation which are usually bestowed on the\r\nestate of a wealthy proprietor. The vessel hove-to within a short\r\ndistance of the shore, and a boat was lowered. The captain informed any\r\ncurious inquirers that it was for the accommodation of some of the\r\npassengers who were to disembark at the little fishing village now\r\nvisible on the coast. He was still speaking, when the noble-looking man\r\nalready mentioned came to take leave of him, and to thank him for his\r\nefforts in the storm of the previous night. He then passed with a quiet,\r\nstately step through the crowd of passengers, and went down into the\r\nboat which was to convey him to the shore. He did not fail, however, to\r\nlook round anxiously for her, with whom he had become so strangely\r\nacquainted; and it was with evident regret that he quitted the ship\r\nwithout having seen her again. He had observed, during their short\r\nvoyage, that she was under the protection of an elderly lady, who\r\nseemed, from a certain stiffness in her manners and appearance, to have\r\noccupied, at some time, the post of governess; but during the storm she\r\nhad been so utterly prostrated by fear and bodily ailment, that she had\r\nabandoned all care of her charge. Even in the morning, when all danger\r\nwas over, she appeared still too much stupefied to be of much service to\r\nthe young girl; and both ladies were evidently fortunate in having a\r\nmost efficient attendant in the old gray-haired man, whose primitive\r\nappearance and manner seemed to indicate that he was a country servant.\r\nThe stranger was scarcely placed in the boat when, somewhat to his\r\nsurprise and pleasure, he saw this old man carefully depositing the\r\nduenna of his young friend in a seat near him; and in another moment\r\nthere was a light footfall on the ladder, a waving of white garments,\r\nand she was herself placed beside him, whilst the sailors, pushing off\r\nfrom the side of the vessel, made all speed towards the shore. Both\r\nturned round hastily, and their eyes met in a glance of recognition. \"It\r\nwould seem our destination is the same,\" said he, with a smile; \"at\r\nleast so far as the fishing village. After that, I cannot, indeed, hope\r\nit, for the path which leads to my abode is not one that many would seek\r\nto travel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is your home near this?\" she said eagerly. \"I am so glad to hear it;\r\nfor perhaps you can tell me something of this country, which is quite\r\nnew to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Most certainly I can,\" he answered. \"I think I know every tree in the\r\nwood, and every flower in the valleys; my whole life, so to speak, has\r\nbeen passed in these localities.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then tell me, do you know Randolph Abbey?\"\r\n\r\nHe started with a movement of the most uncontrollable agitation, and\r\nlooked at her almost fiercely, as though he suspected the intention of\r\nher words; but her candid gaze disarmed him; he compressed his lips\r\nfirmly, which had grown deadly white, and answered composedly: \"I do\r\nknow it well, most intimately; not only the Abbey, but its inhabitants;\r\nthey have been my friends these many years.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you must be mine also,\" she said gayly; \"for I am myself a\r\nRandolph.\"\r\n\r\n\"I might have guessed it;\" and he looked thoughtfully upon her.\r\n\r\n\"And you know them all--all the party I am going to meet?--for I was\r\ntold I should find so many relations there.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think I am acquainted with every one who ever crossed the threshold\r\nof Randolph Abbey,\" he said with a faint smile; \"from old Sir Michael\r\nhimself down to the great wolfdog Philax, who guards the outer gate; and\r\nyou are his niece, no doubt--the only child of his brother Edward.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am Lilias Randolph; did you know, then, that I was expected?\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not been at the Abbey for some time,\" he answered, while an\r\nexpression of deep pain passed across his face; \"but I know that Sir\r\nMichael is collecting round him all his nearest heirs, that he may\r\nchoose amongst them one to whom he shall leave the Abbey and estate,\r\nwhich he has the power of willing away to whom he pleases. I knew that\r\nhe sent for you to complete the number.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very true, and that alone damps my pleasure in going to see my new\r\nrelations, that this visit to my uncle is for such a purpose; however,\"\r\nshe continued, laughing merrily, \"with so many charming cousins as I\r\nbelieve I have to dispute the prize with me, I think I need not fear\r\nthat it will fall to my share.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, it were a fair possession,\" he said, turning round, and\r\npointing to the beautiful shore they were rapidly approaching. \"All\r\nthose magnificent woods and green luxuriant fields, as far as your eye\r\ncan reach, belong to Randolph Abbey.\"\r\n\r\nShe looked with some interest on the lands which had been the heritage\r\nof her ancestors; but soon withdrawing her eyes to gaze fixedly at him,\r\nshe said with some earnestness: \"You seem to know so much more of my\r\nfamily than I do myself, I should be thankful if you would give me some\r\ninformation respecting those I am about to meet. I do not even know how\r\nmany cousins I have there. I have heard that I had several uncles, all\r\nof whom died, except Sir Michael, but I have never seen any of their\r\nchildren.\"\r\n\r\n\"Sir Michael had four brothers, of whom your father was the youngest,\r\nand his favorite. They all died, each leaving a child. The heirs of the\r\nthree eldest have already been summoned to the Abbey, and now you will\r\ncomplete the party.\"\r\n\r\n\"But will you not describe them to me, and my uncle and aunt?--they are\r\nquite strangers to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Describe them! I! impossible;\" and his features, which had relaxed from\r\ntheir habitual sternness while he spoke to her, suddenly assumed an\r\nexpression of severity which almost terrified her; the color mounted to\r\nher fair face, as she felt that, perhaps, her request had been\r\nunwarrantable to a perfect stranger. He saw her embarrassment, and\r\ninstantly the smile of singular sweetness, which at times rendered his\r\ncountenance almost beautiful, dispersed the passing shadow.\r\n\r\n\"You must excuse my abruptness,\" he said; \"I have been so little\r\naccustomed of late to the society of such as you are; but, indeed, it\r\nwere better you should go unbiased to receive your first impression of\r\nyour relations. Did you say you had never seen any of them?\"\r\n\r\n\"None. I have lived all my life with my old dear grandfather in Ireland,\r\nfar from any town in the old house, among the wild green hills, which\r\nwas my poor mother's home. I never saw either of my parents, but I have\r\nheard so much of her I seem quite to know her; my heart and spirit know\r\nher; whereas of my father, and his family, I know literally nothing.\"\r\n\r\n\"The time is at hand, then,\" he said, pointing to the beach; \"there\r\nstands Sir Michael's carriage to convey you to the Abbey.\" She turned\r\nher sweet countenance with a timid, anxious look to the shore, and he\r\ngazed at her evidently with deep interest; suddenly he addressed her:\r\n\"You wished me to describe your cousins to you, and I could not; but\r\nnow, when I think that you are going quite alone amongst them all, I\r\nfeel strangely tempted to give you one caution: think what you will of\r\nthe others, and be as friendly with them as your heart prompts you, but\r\nbeware of----.\" A name seemed trembling on his lips; he plainly\r\nstruggled to utter it, and then some thought checked him. \"No,\" he said,\r\nspeaking more to himself than to her, \"it were an act of blind, human\r\npolicy to seek to shield her by any earthly scheming from the approach\r\nof evil; let her go, powerful in her own innocence and purity of heart;\r\nwhat better safeguard can she have than that deep guilelessness?\" He saw\r\nthat she gazed at him in astonishment as he spoke--\"You will scarce\r\nregret,\" he continued, smiling, \"that our acquaintance is drawing to a\r\nclose; I must seem to have dealt very strangely by you; and I have yet a\r\nrequest to make before we part, which will, I fear, yet astonish you\r\nstill more. Will you promise me not to mention to any individual\r\nwhatever at Randolph Abbey that you have met me? you do not know my\r\nname, but they would recognize me by your description, and I earnestly\r\ndesire I should not be spoken of amongst them.\" The fair, candid eyes\r\nassumed an expression of gravity.\r\n\r\n\"Pray do not ask me this, for I cannot endure concealments.\"\r\n\r\n\"That I can well believe,\" he answered. \"I would fancy your young mind\r\nclear and limpid as the purest waters; but trust me, that I do not make\r\nthe request without a reason you would yourself approve of; you would\r\nnot wish to give pain to any one I know.\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed I would not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you will not speak of me at Randolph Abbey, for by so doing you\r\nwould cause acute suffering--not to me, but to another.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is quite enough; I will promise you to be silent, unless some\r\nunforeseen circumstance should compel me to speak of what has passed\r\nbetween us.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thank you much,\" he said; \"and now here we part. You will excuse my\r\nnot accompanying you to the carriage, as you have your servants, and I\r\ndo not wish to be seen by Sir Michael's people.\" The boat had reached\r\nthe shore; he leaped out and assisted her to disembark; then, still\r\nholding her hand for a moment, he looked at her with the strange, sweet\r\nsmile which so beautified his face, and said--\"I need scarcely say, all\r\ngood be with you, for I feel it must be so. There are many stern natures\r\nin this world, but none cruel enough, I am sure, to betray so trusting a\r\nheart, or cause such cloudless eyes to grow dim in tears; you never will\r\ndeceive or injure any, and, therefore, will deceits and wrong fall\r\nharmless round you. Your own frank and unsuspecting goodness will be as\r\ninvincible armor upon you, and fear not, therefore, when you find\r\nyourself in the midst of the toils which crafty human nature spreads\r\nover life; walk on in truth and guilelessness, according as your own\r\ngenerous impulse dictates, and I do not doubt that the pure and gentle\r\nspirit of the woman will come forth unscathed, where many a stronger has\r\nbeen scorched and withered; for you will soon learn that the dangerous\r\npaths of this world are over hidden fires and by treacherous pitfalls.\"\r\n\r\nWith these strange words he left her before she had time to answer him;\r\nit seemed to her that what he had said was not intended as a mere\r\ngeneral remark, but that it applied directly to herself, from some\r\nsecret knowledge he possessed of her future prospects. She remained\r\nlooking after him in astonishment, not unmixed with interest in one who\r\nseemed so strangely to have assumed the position of friend and\r\ncounsellor towards her; the echo of his voice still ringing in her ears,\r\nso full of mournful sweetness, and the haunting melancholy of the eyes\r\nwhich had read her inmost soul, oppressed her with a feeling of sadness\r\nvery new to her light heart. She saw him mount a horse which his servant\r\nheld in readiness for him, and, in another instant, he had disappeared\r\nin the woods. With him, however, passed the cloud he had raised; a\r\nthousand new objects of interest were before her, and her eyes seemed to\r\ncatch the very sunbeams as they passed, while her light feet bounded\r\neagerly to the spot where Sir Michael's servants awaited her.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE OLD MAN'S REVENGE ON THE DEAD.\r\n\r\nIn a small room, darkened by the deepening shadows of the twilight, sat\r\na withered old man--looking infinitely more like a necromancer of some\r\ncenturies back than an English baronet of the present day. The species\r\nof cell in which he sat was placed in the loftiest turret of Randolph\r\nAbbey, as far separated as possible from the apartments inhabited by the\r\nfamily. It was entirely filled with a variety of scientific instruments,\r\nwhich seemed to be in constant requisition; the quaint, old latticed\r\nwindow was thrown wide open, and a telescope fixed at it, in the proper\r\nposition for a contemplation of the heavenly bodies by night. At the\r\nother end of the room was fixed an apparatus for chemical experiments,\r\nand here Sir Michael was seated, poring over some liquid which he was\r\nsubjecting to the influence of a spirit-lamp. He wore a black velvet\r\ncap, which contrasted forcibly with the fixed livid color of his face,\r\nand his person was enveloped in an ample dressing-gown of the same\r\nmaterial, in which the shrivelled, meagre form seemed almost lost. It\r\nseemed incredible that a living frame should be so wasted and shrunken\r\nas his was--the skin had literally dried on his hands, till they were\r\nlike those of a skeleton. There was nothing lifelike in his whole\r\nappearance, except the small, piercing eyes, which glittered with a\r\nstartling brightness.\r\n\r\nWho could have imagined, to look upon him, that within this withered\r\nbody there glowed the most intense and ardent passions it can be given\r\nto a human being to feel on earth!\r\n\r\nNo young man, in the strength and energy of his prime, ever loved with\r\nso fierce a love, or hated with so bitter a hate, as did this worn,\r\nattenuated being; in truth, it was the fire, undiminished still, of the\r\nstrong, passionate heart that throbbed in so frail a tenement, which had\r\nsapped the very springs of life within him, and dried up the blood in\r\nhis veins.\r\n\r\nEven now, the ceaseless activity with which he busied himself in his\r\nchemical experiments, the convulsive twitching of his mouth from\r\nexcessive eagerness, was but the result of the one burning thought that\r\nconsumed him, and from which he sought relief in physical action. He\r\ncared nothing at all for these things about which he occupied himself,\r\nbut long practice, systematically undertaken, and his own great ability,\r\nhad rendered him a wonderful adept in science; he had resolutely become\r\nso, because he knew that these subtle experiments, and the singular\r\ncombinations they produced, must, to a certain degree, prove an aliment\r\nto the intolerable restlessness produced by the one strong passion that\r\nlay feeding at his heart, like a serpent coiled around it.\r\n\r\nIt was a glorious summer day, and outside the thick walls of the turret\r\nthe sunlight was glancing, and the green trees waving in the wind; but\r\nhe dared not go out to the free air and the smiling nature, for, if\r\nreleased from the occupation he had created for himself, because it\r\ndemanded such incessant attention, the current of thought, undiverted\r\nfrom its natural course, would too surely ebb back upon his soul with\r\nits waters of exceeding bitterness; and therefore had many years of this\r\nold man's wretched life been spent as he was spending this present\r\nhour--bending over the glowing crucible, that he might avert the shock\r\nof the antagonistic properties which he had purposely combined, in order\r\nthat his mind might be engaged in preventing the collision. None knew\r\nbetter than himself how profitless and miserable was this existence he\r\nhad made, but except he fed, even with this food of ashes, the serpent\r\nthought that haunted him, it would have preyed on him to madness. Truly\r\nthat dark fluid, beneath which his withered fingers were even now so\r\nbusily turning the powerful flame, was an apt symbol of his own\r\nlife--wasting away before the hidden fire which himself was goaded on to\r\nfoster hour by hour.\r\n\r\nAbsorbed as he seemed to be in his strange employment, he nevertheless\r\nheard with great acuteness the approach of some person, who knocked\r\nsoftly at the door and then opened it. Sir Michael turned round eagerly;\r\nthe new comer was a servant, who said quickly, \"My lady wishes to speak\r\nto you, Sir,\" and disappeared at once, as though the locality was one in\r\nwhich he by no means desired to find himself.\r\n\r\nBut the old man had heard the message, and through all the red glow cast\r\nby the flaming lamp, his livid face grew ghastlier still with strong\r\nemotion. He leant back in his chair, breathing quick and hard, and with\r\nhis hand pressed to his side; then rising hastily, he gathered the long\r\nblack garment round him, and left the room, heedless of the boiling\r\nliquid, whose ingredients it had required days to combine, and which\r\nnow, overflowing in the crucible, was lost entirely. Through the\r\nvaulted passages of the noble old building the Lord of Randolph Abbey\r\ntook his way, stealing along within the shadow of the wall, the\r\nshrivelled hands still clasped over his bosom, and trembling with\r\nagitation. One might have fancied him the spectre of some old miser,\r\ncreeping back to visit the beloved gold which had turned, as it were, to\r\nmolten lead, crushing him within his grave; but it was, indeed, hard to\r\nbelieve that this was the possessor of as noble an estate as ever came\r\nto a man from the dead hands of a long line of ancestors, and that\r\nwealth well nigh untold was at his command. He crossed the great hall, a\r\nmagnificent room, lighted by an immense Gothic window at the one end,\r\nwhilst the other was occupied by a large organ, whence he went through\r\nvarious passages, covered with the softest carpets and lined with silken\r\nhangings. It was plain that he was on the outskirts of a region where\r\nluxury was systematically studied. At length he reached a door, which\r\nwas closed only by heavy curtains, and there paused for a moment.\r\n\r\nA voice was heard within, a clear, full-toned voice, talking, as it\r\nwould seem, in terms of endearment to some animal; and as it came\r\nmurmuring on his ear, there stole a light into that old man's eyes, a\r\nlight reflected from the bright, spring-time of life, when first he had\r\nheard those tones, and vowed to follow their sweet sound the wide world\r\nover, little dreaming they would lure him through a labyrinth of such\r\nvaried agonies; his whole countenance was softened by the gleaming of\r\nthat pure affection from his eyes, for it was the memory of the young\r\nfresh love that still held unalterable dominion over him. This was his\r\nmisery, that it was as young as ever in his aged heart, strong and lusty\r\nbeyond what the withered frame could bear; but no longer fresh and true,\r\nno longer guiltless, for it will be seen how this deep love had\r\nengendered a deeper hate.\r\n\r\nWith the beauty of that tenderness still lingering on his face, he drew\r\nback the curtain and passed into the room; and straight-way was he met\r\nby the glance of stinging, cold disdain that all these many years had,\r\nhour by hour, and day by day, tortured his love to madness, and lashed\r\nhis very soul to fiercest irritability. A most beautiful woman was Lady\r\nRandolph, though now in the ripe autumn of her days; stately and\r\nmagnificent in dress and appearance, with pride in every gesture and\r\nmovement, and a haughty self-love filling that swelling breast, and\r\ncurling the finely chiselled lips. She was surrounded by the utmost\r\nrefinement of luxury, and lay extended on a chaise lounge, with a\r\ndelicate little Italian greyhound nestling beside her, to whom she\r\ncontinued to talk in fondling accents, even when her husband stood\r\nbefore her. Yet there was no symptom of an indolent disposition in her\r\nappearance; there was, on the contrary, a flashing gleam in the proud\r\neyes, which seemed to tell of fiery energy.\r\n\r\nThese met him, as we have said, with a glance of withering contempt,\r\nwhich caused the shrivelled frame to shake and quiver. Yet memory had\r\nbeen busy at his heart, when he heard her voice come softly through the\r\ncurtain, as once through the green shade of the whispering woods, in his\r\nsummer time of love and hope. There was a tremulous softness in his\r\ntone, a sad deprecating of her disdain, when he spoke to her. \"You\r\nwished to see me, Catherine.\"\r\n\r\n\"Only that I might give you a piece of intelligence, no doubt most\r\ngratifying to you; another of your heirs has obeyed your summons; I am\r\ntold that Lilias Randolph is arrived.\"\r\n\r\nShe spoke as if she could have wished that every word should cut to his\r\nvery heart; it was plain that the fact thus announced had somehow\r\ntouched a wound of rankling bitterness in her own. She went on, gazing\r\nfixedly at him with the most frigid coldness, \"This Lilias is the\r\ndaughter of your favorite brother, is she not? I presume she will be the\r\nfortunate individual on whom your choice will probably fall.\r\nHenceforward, then, it may be a pleasant subject of speculation for me,\r\nwhether this girl, whom you have never so much as seen, will vouchsafe a\r\ncrust of bread to your widow, and a garret to shelter her in the home\r\nshe shared with you.\"\r\n\r\nHe writhed under these bitter words, and wrung his withered hands. He\r\nspoke with moaning voice, like that of a child in pain--\"Catherine,\r\nCatherine, it is yourself who have forced me to it. You know how,\r\nliving, all that I have is yours,--my whole wealth utterly at your\r\ncommand; dying, as soon I must, how thankful would I leave all I possess\r\nto you; yes, thankful should I be to think that from the very grave my\r\nlove had still the power to benefit and bless you--if you would but give\r\nme the pledge I ask. You know how from this overwhelming affection which\r\nI have given you these long, interminable years, there has been born a\r\nhate deeper, deeper even than its parent love, for it constrains me\r\nrather to endure the bitterness of your reproaches, the agony of leaving\r\nyou destitute on earth, than consent that even one inch of my property,\r\none penny of my wealth, should pass from your hands to the offspring of\r\nthe man I have abhorred.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes! and to have so abhorred him, the best and noblest of his kind--and\r\nnow to hate his helpless child--I tell you, you can have no heart of man\r\nwithin you, but the very nature of a tiger, cruel and crafty. A deadly\r\nhate it must be, truly, which can pursue a man into his very rest of\r\ndeath, and wound the poor corpse in the person of his son. Oh! how could\r\nyou abhor him--you who have seen him in his living grace and goodness?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because he loved you,\" almost shrieked the old man; \"and oh,\r\nCatherine, my wife, so long and vainly dear, because you loved him\r\nalso.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did, and do,\" she exclaimed, weeping passionate tears; \"oh! how I\r\nlove him still, my first, my only choice, the husband of my youth, the\r\nfather of my child. You thought I should forget him, did you, in the\r\nmidst of all this luxury? I tell you I love his green and narrow grave,\r\nwith the dead ashes it contains, ten thousandfold better than this\r\npalace home and the living husband within it.\" The withering scorn with\r\nwhich she uttered these last words seemed to madden him.\r\n\r\n\"What, you doat on his very grave,\" he said, stamping his foot, \"and by\r\nthe side of it you would have starved, a penniless widow, had I not\r\ntaken you.\"\r\n\r\nHer breast heaved with anger--\"And should I not have been well content\r\nto starve, rather than eat that bitter bread which I bought with the\r\ntitle of your wife: but the child, his child and mine, would have\r\nperished, or lived in misery; and for his sake, for my lost husband's\r\nsake, I married you, that I might the better cherish the poor son he\r\nleft me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! why will you torture me? It is true, that, from the days of our\r\nfirst meeting, you have fostered within me the unconquerable hate which,\r\nfor my agony and yours, has grown mightier than the mighty love I bear\r\nyou. It is by this wanton lavishing upon him, and now upon his son, of\r\nthe tenderness I sought with a life's idolatry to gain, which has\r\ncurdled the very blood within my heart, and makes me feel that I would\r\nrather leave you to languish in the worst of poverty than furnish you\r\nthe means of blessing him with all life's treasures, and dwelling with\r\nhim in delight, when I can no longer claim your presence, by the wife's\r\nobedience, if not alas! alas! by the woman's love. No, though my\r\nresolution has made our life a miserable struggle, yet am I immovable in\r\nthis--I never will go down into the dungeon of the grave, and know that\r\nover my impotent dust the son of my rival is revelling in all my wealth,\r\ndwelling in my home, making you happy, as you never were when at my\r\nside, because he has the likeness of his father in his face. Already is\r\nit torture to me to know he is within these walls; and often I have\r\nthought that, madly as I love you, it was a dear-bought pleasure to have\r\nyou as my wife, when the condition on which you came to me was the\r\npresence of this hateful boy. Oh, Catherine, be advised, give him\r\nup--strange object of affection, truly!\"--and he laughed bitterly--\"not\r\nto starve--he is your son--I do not ask it; but to go and live upon a\r\npittance somewhere out of my sight and thoughts. Then give me this easy\r\npledge, that he never shall inherit Randolph Abbey, and I will have no\r\nother heir but you. With your own hands, if you will, you then may drive\r\nout all these children of my brothers; I care not what becomes of them;\r\nand here you shall be a very queen, possessor of the whole fair lands\r\nfor ever.\"\r\n\r\nHe had given her time to quell her emotion in this earnest speech, and\r\nhe shuddered as he met the look of impassible and contemptuous\r\ndetermination with which she answered him--\"Why will you weary me with\r\nproposals which I have a hundred times rejected, and will reject again,\r\nas often as it shall please you to amuse yourself by making them. I\r\nrequire no more of these detailed assurances that you design to be, as\r\nyou have ever been, my bitter enemy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Catherine, is it to be an enemy to worship you as I have done?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes! a remorseless enemy, and this selfish worship my sorest\r\npersecution. What other name were fitting for you, who, in your jealous\r\nhate, have struck blow after blow upon my miserable heart, in the\r\npersons of those most dear to me? Did you not, by your machinations,\r\ndeprive my noble husband of the employment by which he lived, and then,\r\nrolling in riches as you were, did you ever stretch one finger to save\r\nhim from the wasting poverty which brought him to the grave? Are you not\r\nhis murderer?\" and she grew fearfully excited. \"Did you not hide all\r\nfrom me, till I discovered it long after I was your wretched wife, when,\r\nhad I known it, you never should have so much as touched this hand of\r\nmine?\"\r\n\r\n\"But, remember, remember; he had done me a deadly wrong--he stole you\r\nfrom me. What injury I ever did him was like to this?\"\r\n\r\n\"It might have been an injury,\" she said, with a bitter smile, \"had he\r\nstolen my love from you; but this you never had, Sir Michael\r\nRandolph--not even before I knew him. I loved luxury and greatness, as I\r\ndo now, and I had agreed to marry the Lord of Randolph Abbey, as such,\r\nand nothing more. Then I met your gentle cousin Lyle, and the sweet\r\npower of affection overcame ambition. My first love was, if you will,\r\nyour fair estate; but he was my second, and my last, for ever!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you not fear to speak such words to me?\" he said, his face growing\r\nwhite with anger, \"and to irritate me thus bitterly, when you know I\r\nhave no power to control the fierceness of my passions? Do you not dread\r\nmy vengeance?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; for whilst you live you can never injure me; your own heart would\r\nresist your efforts so to do; and besides, the bonds that unite us would\r\nprevent it. You never can take from me the right to share your home, and\r\nfind my chief pleasure in its luxury; nor can you, by the oath which I\r\nmade you take as the condition of our marriage, in any way deprive my\r\nchild of the shelter of this roof.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true, I cannot; though I would give my right hand to do it!\"\r\n\r\n\"That may be,\" said the scornful voice, \"but you cannot escape your vow\r\nany more than I can the marriage oath. And now, we have had enough of\r\nthese odious scenes of mutual reproach. You have fully instructed me in\r\nyour resolve, to punish a dead man for the love I bear his ashes, by\r\ndepriving myself and my son, after your death, of the estate I have\r\nshared with you. I am fully aware of your intentions, and I congratulate\r\nyou on the pleasant task you have prepared for yourself, of choosing an\r\nheir amongst half-a-dozen needy relations; and, now, if you have any\r\ndoubt as to my plans, I will tell you them, once for all, and let there\r\nbe an end to this childish struggling between us. I married you in order\r\nto procure a home for my son, and for myself the luxury in which my\r\nnature delights; both of these you are bound to give us in your\r\nlifetime, and you are decided to dispossess us of them hereafter. If,\r\nthen, your belief that you have an incurable malady be true, we have not\r\nlong to enjoy these benefits, for which I sacrificed that which is\r\ndearest to a woman's heart--the faithfulness of her worship to one\r\nalone; and, therefore, since the price I paid for them has proved so\r\ntremendous, I will, at least, make the most of them while they are left\r\nto me. My son shall not stir one hour from this house; I will not\r\ndescend one step from my place, as mistress of the Abbey and all your\r\nwealth; and, if we survive you, as you predict, I will promise you not\r\nto curse your memory, because I should lose my self-respect in so doing,\r\nsince, be you what you may, I have given you the title of my husband.\"\r\nAnd the haughty woman turned from him as she spoke, sweeping her\r\ngorgeous robes after her with so dignified a movement, so stately a\r\ncurve of the proud neck, that his anger was almost quelled in admiration\r\nof her queen-like beauty. Lady Randolph had reached the door, when she\r\npaused and looked back, \"We have forgotten Lilias Randolph: is it your\r\npleasure to receive her here in my presence?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, send for her at once,\" he answered, eagerly seizing a pretext to\r\nkeep her in his sight; for, despite her bitter words--despite the age\r\nwhich sent the blood so sluggishly through his veins--he ever felt, when\r\nshe left the room, that going forth of strength from the soul with the\r\ndeparting of one beloved, which is the penalty of a deep affection. She\r\nrung a little silver hand-bell, and desired that the new-comer should be\r\nconducted to this room; and then she sat down immovably to await her,\r\nwithout glancing at her husband. She was, to all appearance, calm; but\r\nthe heaving chest showed how the proud heart was still beating fast,\r\nwhilst he shook in every limb, like an aged tree, over which a storm had\r\npassed. He gazed intently upon her, as in her presence he ever did, and\r\nat last, seeming irritated at her silence, he said, in a voice tremulous\r\nwith passion--\"Remember, Lady Randolph, that however bitterly you hate\r\nme, I will have none of it reflected back upon my niece. Lilias Randolph\r\nmust find here a home, and a happy one. I will have it so: and no unkind\r\ntreatment of yours must render it otherwise.\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not wonder you should fear that I may have learned in _this_ house\r\nthe exercise of petty tyranny, and the punishing of the innocent for the\r\ncrimes of others; but we do not easily learn that which is against our\r\nnature, and I think experience may tell you that your lessons have\r\nfailed. Is there one of the Randolphs now located in this house who can\r\ncomplain of me, in any way whatsoever?\"\r\n\r\nHe was glad that the sound of approaching footsteps prevented the\r\nnecessity of an answer. Both turned to the door to greet Lilias\r\nRandolph.\r\n\r\nShe came in like a very sunbeam, all light and peace, dispersing, as it\r\nwere, by her presence, the storm of angry passions that had been raging\r\nthere. Both of them were disposed to meet her with preconceived\r\nanimosity, but they were at once disarmed by the serene purity of her\r\naspect. The large candid eyes, with their timid glance, half shy, half\r\nfree, so like a young fawn; the sweet face, glowing beneath the soft\r\nhair, with a faint blush of diffidence; the whole atmosphere of\r\ninnocence, and hope, and loving kindness towards all men, which seemed\r\nto be around her, had power to stir long silent depths in both those\r\nseared and angry hearts; the bitter strife, whose cause and results had\r\nbecome magnified to their distorted vision, to an importance which\r\nnothing on this fleeting earth could really merit, almost melted away\r\nbefore _her_ presence, who seemed prepared to walk through life in such\r\njoyousness and singleness of heart, with eyes that could see nothing but\r\nbeauty, and a mind that could perceive only goodness. Lady Randolph came\r\nforward, and took her hand with a degree of politeness which Sir Michael\r\nknew to be a most unwonted act of condescension, but which to the\r\nsunny-hearted Lilias seemed to be a very cold, repulsive welcome. She\r\nlooked up with her clear eyes to the proud, handsome face that bent over\r\nher and wondered if it was of this stately lady that she was to beware,\r\nfor the half-uttered words of the stranger had impressed her strangely,\r\nand the one thought, that there was to be for her a hidden enemy within\r\nthese walls, had appeared to haunt her very footsteps ever since she\r\nentered Randolph Abbey. Sir Michael approached, and Lady Randolph at\r\nonce let fall the little hand that fluttered in her own. Lilias timidly\r\nadvanced towards her uncle; involuntarily he put his arm round her, and\r\nstroked down the soft brown hair: \"Poor Edward,\" he murmured, \"how\r\nwonderfully you resemble him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you will love me for his sake, will you not?\" and she looked\r\ncoaxingly up to him.\r\n\r\n\"Dear child, would that you could be like what he was, to me, the only\r\ncreature who ever loved me.\"\r\n\r\n\"And now I will be another; only let me try to take his place.\" She put\r\nher arms round his neck and nestled close to him, till the old man felt,\r\nas it were, the warmth of a new life creep into his breast from the\r\nbeating of the pure young heart beside him. He pressed her fondly to\r\nhim; it was so long since any one had seemed to consider him as a being\r\nfor whom it was possible to feel the least affection, that her gentle\r\nwords were strangely soothing to him. Suddenly she started in his arms,\r\nfor the door was closed with great violence; it was Lady Randolph, who\r\nhad left the room, and she wondered at the strange gleam of pleasure\r\nwhich lit up the livid face of her uncle. Unconsciously she shrunk from\r\nhim as from something evil; but little indeed could that innocent mind\r\nconceive of the feeling which made him exalt in having thus drawn forth\r\nan indication of jealous anger from the wife who so long had crushed him\r\nwith her cold contempt. Lilias remained with her uncle, and told him the\r\nbrief history of her untroubled life; all things connected with her\r\nseemed gentle, pure, and happy, even where images of death forced their\r\nway amongst them. He listened as to some melodious poem, whilst she told\r\nhim of her mother, the sweet Irish girl, who had lured his brother\r\nEdward, in early youth, from all the grandeur of Randolph Abbey, to come\r\nand dwell with her among the Connaught hills; and how, as Lilias had\r\nheard from her old nurse, they had been the fairest couple ever seen,\r\nliving for one another only, and thinking earth a paradise, because they\r\nwalked upon it hand in hand.\r\n\r\n\"And then, dear uncle,\" continued Lilias, \"it seemed as though they\r\nfeared that time or change should make them less beloved one to another;\r\nor since that could never be, that any evil should rise up to separate\r\nthem even for one day; and so they went and lay down side by side in the\r\ngreen churchyard, where none could seek them out, to trouble the silent\r\nlove they knew would live beyond the grave. My father died the first,\r\nand my mother laid her head upon his heart, when it ceased to beat, and\r\nnever lifted it again; and so they buried them just as they were, and\r\nshe lies there still, most sweetly sleeping. She said, just before she\r\nexpired, that his heart had been her resting-place in life, and should\r\nbe so in death; and so it was, and is even yet, a blessed rest.--Is it\r\nnot, dear uncle?\"\r\n\r\nHe almost crushed her hand in his, and said, \"Tell me no more of them,\r\nLilias, I cannot bear it;\" he was thinking how the proud feet of his\r\ndisdainful wife would spurn the turf from his unhappy grave.\r\n\r\nLilias thought it pained him to hear of the brother's death whom he had\r\nso loved, and therefore gently changing the subject, she began to tell\r\nhim of her own happy childhood and youth--how she had lived with her\r\ngood old grandfather, the pastor of a country village, roaming the hills\r\nall day a free and joyous child, and in the evening sitting by his side,\r\ngaining from him all needful learning, and many tender counsels to\r\nsmooth her path in life: and how the one bright lesson he had ever\r\ntaught her was to have deep faith in the love and goodness pervading all\r\nthings inwardly, even as beauty clothes the world outwardly; to believe\r\nthat however dark, and bitter, and mysterious might seem the destinies\r\nof man, yet all has a merciful purpose, and shall have a joyous ending,\r\nif only we will have patience, and hope, and loving-kindness one towards\r\nanother; and how she was to fear nothing on this earth, not pain, nor\r\nsorrow, nor death, for that all these were tender messengers working\r\ntheir work of mercy; and how she never was to suspect evil or to look\r\nfor it in others, but ever to seek only that which was good and pure in\r\nthem, for that there is not in the world a soul, however stained, but\r\nhas some fair spot lingering from the brightness with which it was\r\nclothed when it came forth--a new-created spirit, bright as a star. So\r\nshe spoke, telling her gentle, happy ideas in a sweet murmuring voice,\r\nand Sir Michael felt, with every word she uttered, that from this wise\r\nand beautiful teaching she had come out the sweetest, purest, most\r\nloving of human beings, ever ready to cast back all thought or shadow of\r\nevil, and seek only that which is lovely and of good report--the germ of\r\nwhich is every where to be found, even in the blackest heart that ever\r\nweighed down the breast of man; and so, bending over her, Sir Michael\r\nkissed the spotless forehead, and internally resolved that she, and none\r\nother, should be his heiress, the possessor of Randolph Abbey: but he\r\nsaid nothing, for when he had summoned the children of his four brothers\r\nto come and reside with him, that he might make choice of an heir, he\r\nhad announced to them that they were to have a probation of six months,\r\nduring which time he designed to judge of their merits, without making\r\nany announcement of his decision, till the period had expired.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.-THE ASSEMBLING OF THE HEIRS IN PRESENCE OF THE JUDGE.\r\n\r\nThrough the dark old hall, from which the lingering twilight was\r\nexcluded, came Lilias Randolph towards the room where she was to meet\r\nthe assembled family, and make acquaintance with her competitors. It was\r\na fairer sight than these grim walls had witnessed for many a day, to\r\nsee her wandering down, with her sunny hair and snowy garments, among\r\nthe suits of armor and warlike relics of ancient times which lay around\r\non all sides: there was a grace in all her movements, a softness and\r\npurity in her aspect, which made her ever seem like a moving light, and\r\nnow, in that shadowy expanse, her glancing form was almost the flitting\r\nof moon-beams along the wall. She paused one moment at the door, and\r\nthough her thoughts were busy with the recollection that amongst those\r\nshe was about to meet there was to be found, she knew not where, a\r\ndangerous foe, yet did not her heart beat one stroke the faster beneath\r\nthe gentle hands so calmly crossed upon her breast. She felt that she\r\nhad injured none, she knew that never would she desire aught but the\r\nwell-being of all around her, and therefore she feared nothing that man\r\ncould do, for she was well convinced that there are limits set to the\r\nunprovoked wrong.\r\n\r\nIn another moment she stood within the room--a lofty saloon,\r\nmagnificently furnished, and of great size; there were two fireplaces,\r\nbut the whole group were collected round one, for although the summer\r\nwas just bursting over the earth, the evenings were still chilly.\r\n\r\nShe distinguished at first only Sir Michael and Lady Randolph--the\r\nformer crouching down in a huge arm-chair, the latter standing so as to\r\ndisplay her majestic height, with an arm laden with jewels leaning on\r\nthe mantelpiece. She saw the young girl come in; but the other persons\r\npresent were turned from the door, and none heard the light footfall on\r\nthe thick carpet till the childlike form, all fair and white, stood\r\nclose to her aunt, contrasting strangely with the haughty lady in her\r\ndark velvet robes.\r\n\r\nLilias looked up; so strange is the power of a few brief human words,\r\nthat, as she gazed from face to face, it was with the question in her\r\nheart, \"Which of you is to be my enemy?\" Before her stood two young men,\r\nboth strikingly handsome, but most unlike: one, who appeared to be the\r\neldest, was a noble specimen of joyous, hardy youth--a fine open\r\ncountenance, from which the dark had been dashed away as with a free\r\nhand, a gay smile, a bold, clear eye, a mellow voice--these were all\r\nindications of what he truly was--a frank, generous-hearted man, with\r\ngreat nobility of sentiment and a rare sincerity. The other were less\r\neasily described, and seemed of a very different stamp; slighter of\r\nmake, and with a fairer face, he seemed the very embodiment of meekness\r\nand gentleness, and his large, almond-shaped blue eyes were seldom\r\nraised when he spoke; and yet there was a refined intelligence beaming\r\nin every line of his countenance: the soft silken hair and delicate\r\nhands might have graced a woman, and Lilias inwardly decided, as she\r\nlooked on him, that he must be a gentle spirit, easily broken; little\r\nfitted to battle with the rough world. He, at least, could never be one\r\nof whom any should beware, nor yet could the beaming countenance of that\r\nbolder man hide aught but a noble heart; where then was her future\r\nenemy? it must be the third of her unknown cousins. Lady Randolph now\r\nnamed these to her: Walter was the elder, son to Sir Michael's soldier\r\nbrother, who died heroically on the field of battle; Gabriel, the child\r\nof one who had disgraced his family by a concealed marriage with a woman\r\nof low rank. She stated these circumstances as calmly as though the\r\noffspring of this person had not been standing before her: he listened\r\nto the contemptuous allusion to his mother without a word or movement;\r\nbut Lilias saw the slight hands tremble violently and the chest heave.\r\nWas it with anger or shame?\r\n\r\n\"This is not all,\" said Sir Michael, who had watched the scene; he\r\nturned to Lady Randolph--\"Will she come?\"\r\n\r\nHis wife made no answer, but walked towards a small door which seemed to\r\nopen into some inner apartment: she opened it, pronounced the name of\r\n\"Aletheia,\" and returned to her place. There was a pause. Lilias had\r\nheard no sound of steps, but suddenly Walter and Gabriel moved aside,\r\nshe looked up, and Sir Michael himself placing a hand within hers,\r\nsaid--\"This is your cousin Aletheia; her father, my third brother, died\r\nonly last year.\" The hand she held sent a chill through Lilias's whole\r\nframe, for it was cold as marble, and when she fixed her eyes on the\r\nface that bent over her, a feeling of awe and distress, for which she\r\ncould not account, seemed to take possession of her.\r\n\r\nIt was not a beautiful countenance, far from it, yet most remarkable;\r\nthe features were fixed and still as a statue, rigid, with a calm so\r\npassionless, that one might have thought the very soul had fled from\r\nthat form, the more so as the whole of the marble face was overspread\r\nwith the most extraordinary paleness. There was not a tinge of color in\r\nthe cheek, scarce even on the lips, and the dead white of the forehead\r\ncontrasted quite unnaturally with the line of hair, which was of a soft\r\nbrown, and gathered simply round the head; it was as though some intense\r\nand awful thought lay so heavy at her heart that it had curdled the very\r\nblood within it, and drawn it away from the veins that it might be\r\ntraced distinctly under the pure skin. It was singular that the\r\nimmovable stillness of that face whispered no thought of soothing rest,\r\nfor it was a stillness as of death--a death to natural joys and\r\nfeelings; and mournfully from under their heavy lids, the eyes looked\r\nout with a deep, earnest gaze, which seemed to ignore all existing\r\nsights and things, and to be fixed on vacancy alone. Aletheia wore a\r\ndress of some dark material, clasped round the throat, and falling in\r\nheavy folds from the braid which confined it at the waist; she stood\r\nmotionless, holding the little warm hand Sir Michael had placed in hers,\r\nwithout seeming almost to perceive the girlish form that stood before\r\nher. There could not have been a greater contrast than between that pale\r\nstatue and the bright, glowing Lilias, the play of whose features, ever\r\nsmiling or blushing, was fitful as waters sparkling beneath the\r\nsunbeam.\r\n\r\n\"Do you not welcome your cousin, Aletheia,\" said Sir Michael, with a\r\nfrown. She started fearfully, as if she had been roused by a blow, from\r\nthe state in which she was absorbed. She looked down at Lilias, who felt\r\nas if the deeply mournful eyes sent a chill to her very soul. Then the\r\nmouth relaxed to an expression of indescribable sweetness, which gave,\r\nfor one second, a touching beauty to the rigid face; a few words,\r\ngentle, but without the slightest warmth, passed from her pale lips.\r\nThen they closed as if in deep weariness. She let fall the hand of\r\nLilias, and glided back to a seat within the shadow of the wall, where\r\nshe remained, leaning her head on the cushions, as though in a\r\ndeath-like swoon. Lilias looked inquiringly at her aunt, almost fearing\r\nher new-found cousin might be ill. But Lady Randolph merely answered,\r\n\"It is always so;\" and no further notice was taken of her.\r\n\r\nThey went to dinner shortly after, and Lilias thought there could not be\r\na more complete picture of comfort and happiness than the luxurious\r\nroom, with its blazing fire, and warm crimson hangings, and the large\r\nfamily party met round the table, where every imaginable luxury was\r\ncollected. Little did her guilelessness conceive of the deep drama\r\nworking beneath that fair outward show. Her very ignorance of the world\r\nand its ways, prevented her feeling any embarrassment amongst those who,\r\nshe concluded, must be her friends, because they were her relations, and\r\nshe talked gayly and happily with Walter, who was seated next to her,\r\nand who seemed to think he had found in her a more congenial spirit than\r\nany other within the walls of Randolph Abbey. All the rest of the party,\r\nexcepting one, joined in the conversation: Lady Randolph, with a few\r\ncoldly sarcastic remarks, stripped every subject she touched upon of all\r\npoetry or softness of coloring; she seemed to be one whom life had\r\nhandled so roughly that it could no longer wear any disguise for her,\r\nand at once, in all things, she ever grasped the bitterness of truth,\r\nand wished to hold its unpalatable draught to the shrinking lips of\r\nothers. Sir Michael listened with interest to every word which Lilias\r\nuttered, and encouraged her to talk of her Irish life; whilst Gabriel,\r\nwith the sweetest of voices, displayed so much talent and brilliancy in\r\nevery word he said, that he might well have excited the envy of his\r\ncompetitors, but for the extraordinary humility which he manifested in\r\nevery look and gesture. There was one only who did not speak, and to\r\nthat one Lilias's attention was irresistibly drawn. She could not\r\nrefrain from gazing, almost in awe, on Aletheia, with her deadly pale\r\nface and her fixed, mournful eyes, who had not uttered a word, nor\r\nappeared conscious of any thing that was passing around her; and her\r\nappearance, as she sat amongst them, was as though she was for ever\r\nhearing a voice they could not hear, and seeing a face they could not\r\nsee. Lilias had yet to learn that \"things are not what they seem\" in\r\nthis strange world, and that mostly we may expect to find the hidden\r\nmatter below the surface directly opposite to that which appears above.\r\nShe therefore simply concluded that this deep insensibility resulted\r\nfrom coldness of heart and deadness of feeling, and gradually the\r\nconviction deepened in her mind, that Aletheia Randolph was the name\r\nwhich had trembled on the lips of her unknown friend, when he warned her\r\nto beware of some one of her new relatives. It seemed to her most likely\r\nthat one so dead and cold should be wholly indifferent to the feelings\r\nof others, and disposed only to work out her own ends as best she might;\r\nand thus, by a few unfortunate words, the seeds of mistrust were sown in\r\nthat innocent heart against one most unoffending, and a deep gulf was\r\nfixed between those two, who might have found in each other's friendship\r\na staff and support whereon to lean, when for either of them the winds\r\nblew too roughly from the storms of life.\r\n\r\nOnce only that evening did Lilias hear the sound of Aletheia's voice,\r\nand then the words she uttered seemed so unnatural, so incomprehensible,\r\nto that light heart in its passionless ignorance, that they did but tend\r\nto increase the germ of dislike, and even fear, that was, as we have\r\nsaid, already planted there against this singular person. It was after\r\nthey had returned to the drawing-room that some mention was made of the\r\nstorm of the preceding evening, to which Lilias had been exposed. Walter\r\nwas questioning her as to its details, with all the ardor of a bold\r\nnature, to whom danger is intoxicating. \"But, I suppose,\" he continued,\r\nsmiling, \"you were like all women, too much terrified to think of any\r\nthing but your own safety?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Lilias, lifting up her large eyes to his with a peculiar look\r\nof brightness, which reminded him of the dawning of morning, \"the\r\nappearance of the tempest was so glorious that its beauty filled the\r\nmind, and left no room for fear. I wish you could have seen it. It was\r\nas though some fierce spirit were imprisoned behind the deep black veil\r\nthat hung over the western heavens, to whom freedom and power were\r\ngranted for a little season; for suddenly one vivid, tremendous flash of\r\nlightning seemed to cleave asunder that dark wall, and then the wild,\r\nliberated storm came thundering forth, shrieking and raging through the\r\nsky, and tearing up the breast of the sea with its cruel footsteps. It\r\nwas the grandest sight I ever saw.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think there must have been another yet more interesting displayed on\r\nboard the vessel itself,\" said the sweet, low voice of Gabriel. \"I\r\nshould have loved rather to watch the storms and struggles of the human\r\nsoul in such an hour of peril as you describe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! that was very fearful,\" said Lilias, shuddering. \"I cannot bear to\r\nthink of it. That danger showed me such things in the nature of man as I\r\nnever dreamt of. I think if the whirlwind had utterly laid bare the\r\ndepths of the sea, as it seemed striving to do, it could not have\r\ndisplayed more monstrous and hideous sights than when its powers\r\nstripped those souls around me of all disguise.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray give us some details,\" said Gabriel, earnestly. He seemed to long\r\nfor an anatomy of human nature in agony, as an epicure would for a\r\nfeast.\r\n\r\nLilias was of too complying a disposition to refuse, though she\r\nevidently disliked the task. \"One instance may be a sufficient example\r\nof what I mean,\" she said. \"There was a man and his wife, whom, previous\r\nto the storm, I had observed as seeming so entirely devoted to one\r\nanother; he guarded her so carefully from the cold winds of evening, and\r\nappeared to live only in her answering affection. Now, when the moment\r\nof greatest peril came--when the ship was reeling over, till the great\r\nmountains of waves threatened to sweep every living soul from the deck,\r\nand the only safety was in being bound with ropes to the masts--I saw\r\nthis man, who had fixed himself to one with a cord that was not very\r\nstrong, and who held his wife clasped in his arms, that the waters might\r\nnot carry her away. At last there came one gigantic billow, whose power\r\nit seemed impossible to withstand; then I saw this man withdraw the\r\nsupport of his arm from the poor creature, who seemed anxious only to\r\ndie with him, and use both his hands to clasp the pole which sustained\r\nhim. She gave a piteous cry, more for his cruelty, I feel sure, than her\r\nown great peril; but with the impulse of self-preservation, she suddenly\r\ngrasped the frail cord which bound him. Then he, uttering an impious\r\ncurse, lifted up his hand--I can scarcely bear to tell it.\" And Lilias\r\nshivered, and grew pale.\r\n\r\n\"Go on,\" said Walter, breathlessly.\r\n\r\n\"He lifted up his hand, and struck her with a hard, fierce blow, which\r\nsent her reeling away to death in the boiling sea; for death it would\r\nhave been, had not a sailor caught her dress and upheld her till the\r\nwave was passed.\"\r\n\r\n\"How horrible!\" exclaimed Walter.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, miserable to be thus rescued! Happy--thrice happy had she died,\"\r\nsaid a deep-toned, mournful voice behind her.\r\n\r\nLilias started uncontrollably, and looked round. The words had been\r\nspoken very low, and as if unconsciously, like a soul holding converse\r\nwith some other soul, rather than a human being communicating with those\r\nof her own kind; yet she felt that they came from Aletheia, who had been\r\nsitting for the last hour like an immovable statue, in a high-backed\r\noaken chair, where the shadow of the heavy curtain fell upon her. She\r\nhad remained there pale and still as marble, her head laid back in the\r\nattitude that seemed habitual to her; the white cheek seeming yet whiter\r\ncontrasted with the crimson velvet against which it lay; and the hand\r\nfolded as in dumb, passive resignation on her breast. But now, as she\r\nuttered these strange words, a sudden glow passed over her face, like\r\nthe setting sun beaming out upon snow; the eyes, so seldom raised,\r\nfilled with a liquid light, the chest heaved, the lips grew tremulous.\r\n\r\n\"What! Aletheia,\" exclaimed Walter, \"happy, did you say--happy to die by\r\nthat cruel blow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Most happy--oh! most blessed to die by a blow so sweet from the hand\r\nshe loved.\"\r\n\r\nHer voice died into a broken whisper; a few large tears trembled in her\r\nmournful eyes, but they did not fall; the unwonted color faded from her\r\nface, and in another moment she was as statue-like as ever, and with the\r\nsame impenetrable look, which made Lilias feel as if she never should\r\nhave either the wish or the courage to address her. Her astonishment and\r\nutter horror at Aletheia's strange remark were, however, speedily\r\nforgotten in the stronger emotion caused her by an incident which\r\noccurred immediately after. Sir Michael had not been in the room since\r\ndinner-time, and now he suddenly entered. He came forward with a rapid\r\nstep towards Lady Randolph, and even she seemed to quail beneath the\r\nsteady gaze of his angry eye. He stood before her for a moment, as if\r\nthe rage that swelled his bosom were too great for utterance; and his\r\nface became of the color of iron white with heat.\r\n\r\n\"Lady Randolph, he has again presumed to cross my path; I have met him,\r\nI have seen him, I stumbled against him, as he came with his noiseless\r\nstep, like a viper; I should have fallen if _his_ arm had not upheld me.\r\nHow has he dared--how have you dared to molest me thus?\"\r\n\r\n\"It was not intentional, I am sure,\" said Lady Randolph, evidently\r\nannoyed; \"certainly he did not expect to meet you there; you know how\r\ncareful he is.\"\r\n\r\n\"But am I to be exposed to the possibility of such a meeting? Was it not\r\na distinct stipulation that he should avoid even the risk of\r\nencountering me? Lady Randolph, is it or is it not a part of the\r\nagreement by which I permit him to dwell in this house, that I am never\r\nto be tormented with the sight of him?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is, it is,\" she answered impatiently; \"and for that reason I am\r\nvexed this should have occurred. I admit that you are justified in your\r\ncomplaint, since such was our contract, however cruel this condition;\r\nbut I will take care that it does not happen again; and at all events,\r\nSir Michael, it seems to me that this is a most unfit discussion to be\r\nheard by your nephews and nieces.\"\r\n\r\n\"There I differ from you,\" he said, with a bitter smile, for he loved to\r\nhumble the proud woman who had trampled on his heart these many years;\r\n\"as they have various motives for seeking to please me, it is as well\r\nthey should know my peculiar tastes; let me tell you then,\" he said,\r\nturning towards them, \"that there is one man in the world whom I hate as\r\nI would hate the vilest reptile, and that man is under this roof;\r\nwhoever wishes my favor, therefore, will avoid him as they would a\r\npestilence.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let us go,\" said Lady Randolph, hastily rising, \"it is quite late; come\r\nLilias, you look pale with fatigue; I will show you the way to your\r\nroom, in case you lose yourself in the long passages.\"\r\n\r\nThis produced an immediate dispersion of the party; Aletheia glided away\r\nwhilst her aunt was speaking, and Gabriel followed her with his eyes\r\ntill the door closed on the dark figure; then he came with many\r\nexpressions of kindly interest to hope that Lilias would rest well,\r\nwhilst Walter warmly shook hands with her, and seemed, in his simple\r\n\"good-night,\" very fervently spoken, to express far more than his cousin\r\nhad done. But it was not fatigue that had chased for a moment the color\r\nfrom the sweet face of Lilias: it the blighting breath of that deadly\r\nthing, the hate of a human heart. Never before had this innocent child\r\ncome in contact with such a passion. Of love, she knew enough; its\r\nfragrant atmosphere had been around her from her cradle, it had come to\r\nher night by night in the fond kiss of her grandfather, and well nigh\r\nhour by hour in the endearing words and caressing arms of her kind old\r\nnurse, who cherished her as such sweet blossoms of life's early spring\r\nare ever cherished by those who have attained its winter: but of hate\r\nshe knew nothing; it was the first time that this accursed thing had\r\ncrept into her presence, which steals about this world, poisoning the\r\nwell-springs of friendship and affection, that rise to refresh us out of\r\nthe desert sands, of this our pilgrimage, and turning their sweet waters\r\ninto blood.\r\n\r\nThe first touch of this vile passion sickened the young heart of Lilias,\r\nand filled it with the most intense compassion for him, unknown as he\r\nwas, who had become the victim of such a fierce aversion. How she\r\nwondered who he was, and what he had done, to be so detested; and it\r\nseemed to her gentle nature that no man, not the worst criminal, could,\r\nwith justice, be so dealt with by a fellow-creature; but a kind of\r\ninstinct told her that the hate was causeless, and therefore did it seem\r\nto wound her, as if herself had been injured. She followed Lady Randolph\r\nthrough the long galleries, and she whose step had been so fearless on\r\nthe dangerous mountains, now shrank from the shadows on the wall; for it\r\nseemed to her as if this house, and every heart within it, were full of\r\ndark, strange, spectres; bad thoughts haunting these souls like ghosts;\r\nevil passions lurking beneath fair outward appearances; and words full\r\nof meaning which she could not fathom floating on her ear.\r\n\r\nBut for the deep peace of her own innocence, the clear cool waters of\r\nperfect truth in which her own soul lay steeped, so fresh and pure,\r\nLilias would have trembled to remain an inhabitant of this place, where\r\nshe felt instinctively there was so much that was mysterious and dark.\r\nBut she resolved to hold firm her own sweet faith and practice, that\r\nthere was mercy in all events and good in every heart, and that she had\r\nnought to do but to love all mankind with an active, charitable love;\r\nand so she trusted to be as safe and happy here as in her Irish home,\r\nwhere simplicity of life was the natural result of simplicity of heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Dickens's Household Words.\r\n\r\nNEW DISCOVERIES IN GHOSTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nEclipses have been ascribed sometimes to the hunger of a great dragon,\r\nwho eats the sun, and leaves us in the dark until the blazing orb has\r\nbeen mended. Numerous instances are ready to the memory of any one of\r\nus, in illustration of the tendency existing among men to ascribe to\r\nsupernatural, fantastic causes, events wonderful only by their rarity.\r\nAll that we daily see differs from these things no more than inasmuch as\r\nit is at the same time marvellous and common. We know very well that the\r\nmoon, seen once by all, would be regarded as an awful spectre: open only\r\nto the occasional vision of a few men, no doubt she would be scouted by\r\na large party as a creation of their fancy altogether.\r\n\r\nThe list of facts that have been scouted in this way, corresponds pretty\r\nexactly to the list of human discoveries, down to the recent\r\nimprovements in street lighting and steam locomotion. The knowledge of\r\nthe best of us is but a little light which shines in a great deal of\r\ndarkness. We are all of us more ignorant than wise. The proportion of\r\nknowledge yet lying beyond the confines of our explorations, is as a\r\ncontinent against a cabbage garden. Yet many thousands are contented to\r\nbelieve, that in this little bit of garden lies our all, and to laugh at\r\nevery report made to the world by people who have ventured just to peep\r\nover the paling. It is urged against inquiries into matters yet\r\nmysterious--mysterious as all things look under the light of the first\r\ndawn of knowledge--why should we pry into them, until we know that we\r\nshall be benefited by the information we desire? All information is a\r\nbenefit. All knowledge is good. Is it for man to say, \"What is the use\r\nof seeing?\"\r\n\r\nWe are in the present day upon the trace of a great many important facts\r\nrelating to the imponderable agencies employed in nature. Light, heat,\r\nand electricity are no longer the simple matters, or effects of matter,\r\nthat they have aforetime seemed to be. New wonders point to more beyond.\r\nIn magnetism, the researches of Faraday, and others, are beginning to\r\nopen, in our own day, the Book of Nature, at a page of the very first\r\nimportance to the naturalist; but the contents of which until this time\r\nhave been wholly unsuspected. Behind a cloudy mass of fraud and folly,\r\nwhile the clouds shift, we perceive a few dim stars, to guide us towards\r\nthe discovery of wondrous truths. There are such truths which will\r\nhereafter illustrate the connection, in many ways still mysteries,\r\nbetween the body of man and the surrounding world. Wonderful things have\r\nyet to be revealed, on subjects of a delicate and subtle texture. It\r\nbehooves us in the present day, therefore, to learn how we may keep our\r\ntempers free from prejudice, and not discredit statements simply because\r\nthey are new and strange, nor, on the other hand, accept them hastily\r\nwithout sufficient proof.\r\n\r\nOn questionable points, which are decided by research and weight of\r\nevidence, it would be well if it were widely understood that it is by no\r\nmeans requisite for every man to form an Aye or Nay opinion. Let those\r\nwho have no leisure for a fair inquiry play a neutral part. There are\r\nhundreds of subjects which we have never examined, nor ever could or can\r\nexamine, upon which we are all, nevertheless, expressing every day\r\nstubborn opinions. We all have to acquire some measure of the\r\nphilosophic mind, and be content to retain a large army of thoughts,\r\nequipped each thought with its crooked bayonet, a note of interrogation.\r\nIn reasoning, also, when we do reason, we have to remember fairly that\r\n\"not proven\" does not always mean untrue. And in accepting matters of\r\ntestimony, we must rigidly preserve in view the fact, that, except upon\r\ngross subjects of sense, very few of us are qualified by training as\r\nobservers. In drawing delicate conclusions from the complex and most\r\ndimly comprehended operations of the human frame observed in men and\r\nwomen, the sources of fallacy are very numerous. To detect and\r\nacknowledge these, to get rid of them experimentally, is very difficult,\r\neven to the most candid and enlightened mind.\r\n\r\nI have no faith in ghosts, according to the old sense of the word, and I\r\ncould grope with comfort through any amount of dark old rooms, or\r\nmidnight aisles, or over churchyards, between sunset and cock-crow. I\r\ncan face a spectre. Being at one time troubled with illusions, I have\r\nmyself crushed a hobgoblin by sitting on its lap. Nevertheless, I do\r\nbelieve that the great mass of \"ghost stories,\" of which the world is\r\nfull, has not been built entirely upon the inventions of the ignorant\r\nand superstitious. In plain words, while I, of course, throw aside a\r\nmillion of idle fictions, or exaggerated facts, I do believe in\r\nghosts--or, rather, spectres--only I do not believe them to be\r\nsupernatural.\r\n\r\nThat, in certain states of the body, many of us in our waking hours\r\npicture as vividly as we habitually do in dreams, and seem to see or\r\nhear in fair reality that which is in our minds, is an old fact, and\r\nrequires no confirmation. An ignorant or superstitious man fallen into\r\nthis state, may find good reason to tell ghost stories to his neighbors.\r\nDisease, and the debility preceding death, make people on their\r\ndeath-beds very liable to plays of this kind on their failing faculties;\r\nand one solemnity or cause of dread, thus being added to another, seems\r\nto give the strength of reason to a superstitious feeling.\r\n\r\nConcerning my own experience, which comes under the class of natural\r\nghost-seeing above mentioned, I may mention in good faith, that, if such\r\nphantoms were worth recalling, I could fill up an hour with the\r\nnarration of those spectral sights and sounds which were most prominent\r\namong the illusions of my childhood. Sights and sounds were equally\r\ndistinct and lifelike. I have run up-stairs obedient to a spectral call.\r\nEvery successive night for a fortnight, my childish breath was stilled\r\nby the proceedings of a spectral rat, audible, never visible. It\r\nnightly, at the same hour, burst open a cupboard door, scampered across\r\nthe floor, and shook the chair by my bedside. Wide awake and alone in\r\nthe broad daylight, I have heard the voices of two nobodies gravely\r\nconversing, after the absurd dream fashion, in my room. Then as for\r\nspectral sights:--During the cholera of 1832, I, then a boy, walking in\r\nHolborn, saw in the sky the veritable flaming sword which I had learnt\r\nby heart out of a picture in an old folio of \"Paradise Lost.\" And round\r\nthe fiery sword there was a regular oval of blue sky to be seen through\r\nparted clouds. It was a fact not unimportant, that this phantom sword\r\ndid not move with my eye, but remained for some time, apparently, only\r\nin one part of the heavens. I looked aside and lost it. When I looked\r\nback, there was the image still. These are hallucinations which arise\r\nfrom a disordered condition of the nervous system; they are the seeing\r\nor the hearing of what is not, and they are not by any means uncommon.\r\nOut of these there must, undoubtedly, arise a large number of\r\nwell-attested stories of ghosts, seen by one person only. Such ghosts\r\nought to excite no more terror than a twinge of rheumatism, or a nervous\r\nheadache.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt, however, that, in our minds or bodies, there are\r\npowers latent, or nearly latent, in the ordinary healthy man, which, in\r\nsome peculiar constitutions, or under the influence of certain agents,\r\nor certain classes of disease, become active, and develope themselves in\r\nan extraordinary way. It is not very uncommon to find people who have\r\nacquired intuitive perception of each others' current thoughts, beyond\r\nwhat can be ascribed to community of interests, or comprehension of\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nZschokke, the German writer and teacher, is a peculiarly honorable and\r\nunimpeachable witness. What he affirms, as of his own knowledge, we\r\nhave no right to disbelieve. Many of us have read the marvellous account\r\ngiven by him, of his sudden discovery that he possessed the power in\r\nregard to a few people--by no means in regard to all--of knowing, when\r\nhe came near to them, not only their present thoughts, but much of what\r\nwas in their memories. The details will be found in his Autobiography,\r\nwhich, being translated, has become a common book among us. When, for\r\nthe first time, while conversing with some person, he acquired a sense\r\nof power over the secrets of that person's past life, he gave, of\r\ncourse, but little heed to his sensation. Afterwards, as from time to\r\ntime the sense recurred, he tested the accuracy of his impressions, and\r\nwas alarmed to find that, at certain times, and in regard to certain\r\npersons, the mysterious knowledge was undoubtedly acquired. Once when a\r\nyoung man at the table with him was dismissing very flippantly all\r\nmanner of unexplained phenomena as the gross food of ignorance and\r\ncredulity, Zschokke requested to know what he would say if he, a\r\nstranger, by aid of an unexplained power, should be able to tell him\r\nsecrets out of his past life. Zschokke was defied to do that; but he did\r\nit. Among other things he described a certain upper room, in which there\r\nwas a certain strong box, and from which certain moneys, the property of\r\nhis master, had been abstracted by that young man; who, overwhelmed with\r\nastonishment, confessed the theft.\r\n\r\nMany glimmerings of intuition, which at certain times occur in the\r\nexperience of all of us, and seem to be something more than shrewd or\r\nlucky guesses, may be referred to the same power which we find, in the\r\ncase just quoted, more perfectly developed. Nothing supernatural, but a\r\nnatural gift, imperceptible to us in its familiar, moderate, and healthy\r\nexercise, brought first under our notice when some deranged adjustment\r\nof the mind has suffered it to grow into excess--to be, if we may call\r\nit so, a mental tumor.\r\n\r\nWe may now come to a new class of mysteries--which are receiving for the\r\nfirst time, in our own day, a rational solution.\r\n\r\nThe blind poet, Pfeffel, had engaged, as amanuensis, a young Protestant\r\nclergyman, named Billing. When the blind poet walked abroad, Billing\r\nalso acted as his guide. One day, as they were walking in the garden,\r\nwhich was situated at a distance from the town, Pfeffel observed a\r\ntrembling of his guide's arm whenever they passed over a certain spot.\r\nHe asked the cause of this, and extracted from his companion the\r\nunwilling confession, that over that spot he was attacked by certain\r\nuncontrollable sensations, which he always felt where human bodies had\r\nbeen buried. At night, he added, over such spots he saw uncanny things.\r\n\"This is great folly,\" Pfeffel thought, \"and I will cure him of it.\" The\r\npoet went, therefore, that very night, into the garden. When they\r\napproached the place of dread, Billing perceived a feeble light, which\r\nhovered over it. When they came nearer, he saw the delicate appearance\r\nof a fiery, ghost-like form. He described it as the figure of a female,\r\nwith one arm across her body, and the other hanging down, hovering\r\nupright and motionless over the spot, her feet being a few hand-breadths\r\nabove the soil. The young man would not approach the vision, but the\r\npoet beat about it with his stick, walked through it, and seemed to the\r\neyes of Billing like a man who beats about a light flame, which always\r\nreturns to its old shape. For months, experiments were continued,\r\ncompany was brought to the spot, the spectre remained visible always in\r\nthe dark, but to the young man only, who adhered firmly to his\r\nstatement, and to his conviction that a body lay beneath. Pfeffel at\r\nlast had the place dug up, and, at a considerable depth, covered with\r\nlime, there was a skeleton discovered. The bones and the lime were\r\ndispersed, the hole was filled up, Billing was again brought to the spot\r\nby night, but never again saw the spectre.\r\n\r\nThis ghost story, being well attested, created a great sensation. In the\r\ncurious book by Baron Reichenbach, translated by Dr. Gregory, it is\r\nquoted as an example of a large class of ghost stories which admit of\r\nexplanation upon principles developed by his own experiments.\r\n\r\nThe experiments of Baron Reichenbach do not, indeed, establish a new\r\nscience, though it is quite certain that they go far to point out a new\r\nline of investigation, which promises to yield valuable results. So much\r\nof them as concerns our subject, may be very briefly stated. It would\r\nappear that certain persons with disordered nervous systems, liable to\r\ncatalepsy, or to such affections, and also some healthy persons who are\r\nof a peculiar nervous temperament, are more sensitive to magnetism than\r\ntheir neighbors. They are peculiarly acted upon by the magnet, and are,\r\nmoreover, very much under the influence of the great magnetic currents\r\nof the earth. Such people sleep tranquilly when they are reposing with\r\ntheir bodies in the earth's magnetic line, and are restless, in some\r\ncases seriously affected, if they lie across that line, on beds with the\r\nhead and foot turned east and west, matters of complete indifference to\r\nthe healthy animal. These \"sensitives\" are not only affected by the\r\nmagnet, but they are able to detect, by their sharpened sense, what we\r\nmay reasonably suppose to exist, a faint magnetic light: they see it\r\nstreaming from the poles of a magnet shown to them in a room absolutely\r\ndark; and if the sensibility be great, and the darkness perfect, they\r\nsee it streaming also from the points of fingers, and bathing in a faint\r\nhalo the whole magnet or the whole hand. Furthermore, it would appear\r\nthat the affection by the magnet of these sensitives does not depend\r\nupon that quality by which iron filings are attracted; that, perfectly\r\nindependent of the attractive force, there streams from magnets, from\r\nthe poles of crystals, from the sun and moon, another influence, to\r\nwhich the discoverer assigns the name of Odyle. The manifestation of\r\nOdyle is accompanied by a light too faint for healthy vision, but\r\nperceptible at night by \"sensitives.\" Odyle is generated, among other\r\nthings, by heat and by chemical action. It is generated, therefore, in\r\nthe decomposition of the human body. I may now quote from Reichenbach,\r\nwho, having given a scientific explanation, upon his own principles, of\r\nthe phenomena perceived by Billing, thus continues:--\r\n\r\n\"The desire to inflict a mortal wound on the monster, Superstition,\r\nwhich, from a similar origin, a few centuries ago, inflicted on European\r\nsociety so vast an amount of misery, and by whose influence, not\r\nhundreds, but thousands of innocent persons died in tortures, on the\r\nrack and at the stake;--this desire made me wish to make the experiment,\r\nif possible, of bringing a highly sensitive person, by night, to a\r\nchurchyard. I thought it possible that they might see, over graves where\r\nmouldering bodies lay, something like that which Billing had seen.\r\nMademoiselle Reichel had the courage, unusual in her sex, to agree to my\r\nrequest. She allowed me, on two very dark nights, to take her from the\r\nCastle of Reisenberg, where she was residing with my family, to the\r\ncemetery of the neighboring village of Grünzing.\r\n\r\n\"The result justified my expectation in the fullest measure. She saw,\r\nvery soon, a light, and perceived, on one of the grave mounds, along its\r\nwhole extent, a delicate, fiery, as it were a breathing flame. The same\r\nthing was seen on another grave, in a less degree. But she met neither\r\nwitches nor ghosts. She described the flame as playing over the graves\r\nin the form of a luminous vapor, from one to two spans in height.\r\n\r\n\"Some time afterwards I took her to two great cemeteries, near Vienna,\r\nwhere several interments occur daily, and the grave mounds lie all about\r\nin thousands. Here she saw numerous graves, which exhibited the lights\r\nabove described. Wherever she looked, she saw masses of fire lying\r\nabout; but it was chiefly seen over all new graves, while there was no\r\nappearance of it over very old ones. She described it less as a clear\r\nflame than as a dense, vaporous mass of fire, holding a middle place\r\nbetween mist and flame. On many graves this light was about four feet\r\nhigh, so that when she stood on the grave it reached to her neck. When\r\nshe thrust her hand into it, it was as if putting it into a dense, fiery\r\ncloud. She betrayed not the slightest uneasiness, as she was, from her\r\nchildhood, accustomed to such emanations, and had seen, in my\r\nexperiments, similar lights produced by natural means, and made to\r\nassume endless varieties of form. I am convinced that all who are, to a\r\ncertain degree, sensitive, will see the same phenomena in cemeteries,\r\nand very abundantly in the crowded cemeteries of large cities; and that\r\nmy observations may be easily repeated and confirmed.\" These experiments\r\nwere tried in 1844. A postscript was added in 1847. Reichenbach had\r\ntaken five other sensitive persons, in the dark, to cemeteries. Of\r\nthese, two were sickly, three quite healthy. All of them confirmed the\r\nstatements of Mademoiselle Reichel, and saw the lights over all new\r\ngraves, more or less distinctly; \"so that,\" says the philosopher, \"the\r\nfact can no longer admit of the slightest doubt, and may be every where\r\ncontrolled.\r\n\r\n\"Thousands of ghost stories,\" he continues, \"will now receive a natural\r\nexplanation, and will thus cease to be marvellous. We shall even see\r\nthat it was not so erroneous or absurd as has been supposed, when our\r\nold women asserted, as every one knows they did, that not every one was\r\nprivileged to see the spirits of the departed wandering over their\r\ngraves. In fact, it was at all times only the sensitive who could see\r\nthe imponderable emanations from the chemical change going on in\r\ncorpses, luminous in the dark. And thus I have, I trust, succeeded in\r\ntearing down one of the densest veils of darkened ignorance and human\r\nerror.\"\r\n\r\nSo far speaks Reichenbach; and for myself, reverting to the few comments\r\nwith which we set out, I would suggest, that Reichenbach's book, though\r\nit is very likely to push things too far--to fancy the tree by looking\r\nat the seed--is yet not such a book as men of sense are justified in\r\nscouting. The repetition of his experiments is very easy if they be\r\ncorrect. There are plenty of \"sensitives\" to be found in our London\r\nhospitals and streets and lanes. Unluckily, however, though we live in\r\nan age which produces, every day, new marvels, the old spirit of\r\nbigotry, which used to make inquiry dangerous in science and religion,\r\nstill prevails in the minds of too many scientific men. To be\r\nincredulous of what is new and strange, until it has been rigidly\r\nexamined and proved true, is one essential element of a mind seeking\r\nenlightenment. But, to test and try new things is equally essential.\r\nBecause of doubting, to refuse inquiry, is because of hunger to refuse\r\nour food. For my own part, I put these matters into the livery of that\r\nlarge body of thoughts already mentioned, which walk about the human\r\nmind, armed each with a note of interrogation. This only I see, that, in\r\naddition to the well-known explanations of phenomena, which produce some\r\namong the many stories of ghosts and of mysterious forebodings, new\r\nexplanations are at hand, which will reduce into a natural and credible\r\nposition many other tales by which we have till recently been puzzled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom Chambers's Edinburgh Journal.\r\n\r\nTHE WOLF-GATHERING.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne winter evening, some years ago, I sat with a small circle of friends\r\nround the fire, in the house of a Polish gentleman, whom his\r\nacquaintance agreed in calling Mr. Charles, as the most pronounceable of\r\nhis names. He had fought in all his country's battles of the\r\nunsuccessful revolution of 1831; and being one of the many who sought\r\nlife and liberty in the British dominions, on the failure of that last\r\nnational effort, he had, with the spirit worthy of an exiled patriot,\r\nmade the best of his unchosen fortunes, and worked his way up, through a\r\nthousand difficulties and privations, to a respectable standing in the\r\nmercantile profession. At the period mentioned, Mr. Charles had become\r\nalmost naturalized in one of our great commercial towns, was a member of\r\na British church, and the head of a British household; but when the\r\nconversation happened to turn on sporting matters round his own\r\nfireside, he related in perfect seriousness the following wild and\r\nlegend-like story of his early life in Poland:--\r\n\r\nThe year before the rising, I went from my native place in Samogitia\r\n(Szamaït), to spend Christmas at the house of my uncle, situated in the\r\nwooded country of Upper Lithuania. He was a nobleman who boasted his\r\ndescent from one of the oldest houses in Poland, and still held the\r\nestate which his ancestors had defended for themselves through many a\r\nTartar invasion--as much land as a hunting-train could course over in a\r\nsummer's day. But ample as his domain appeared, my uncle was by no means\r\nrich upon it. The greater portion had been forest-land for ages;\r\nelsewhere it was occupied by poor peasants and their fields; and in the\r\ncentre he lived, after the fashion of his forefathers, in a huge timber\r\nhouse with antiquated fortifications, where he exercised liberal\r\nhospitality, especially at Christmas times. My uncle was a widower, but\r\nhe had three sons--Armand, Henrique, and Constantine--brave, handsome\r\nyoung men, who kept close intimacy and right merry companionship with\r\ntheir nearest neighbors, a family named Lorenski. Their property\r\nbordered on my uncle's land, and there was not a family of their station\r\nwithin leagues; but independently of that circumstance, the household\r\nmust have had attractions for my cousins, for it consisted of the young\r\nCount Emerich, his sister Constanza, and two orphan cousins, Marcella\r\nand Eustachia, who had been brought up with them from childhood.\r\n\r\nThe count's parents had died in his early youth, leaving him not only\r\nhis own guardian, but that of his sister and cousins; and the young\r\npeople had grown up safely and happily together in that forest-land. The\r\ncousins were like most of our Polish girls in the provinces, dark-eyed\r\nand comely, gay and fearless, and ready alike for the dance or the\r\nchase; but Count Emerich and his sister had the praise of the whole\r\nprovince for their noble carriage, their wise and virtuous lives, and\r\nthe great affection that was between them. Both had strange courage, and\r\nwere said to fear neither ghost nor goblin--which, I must remark, was\r\nnot a common case in Lithuania. Constanza was the oldest by two years,\r\nand by far the most discreet and calm of temper, by which it was\r\nbelieved she rather ruled the household, though her brother had a high\r\nand fiery spirit. But they were never known to disagree, and, though\r\nstill young, neither seemed to think of marrying. Fortunately, it was\r\nnot so with all their neighbors. My stay at my uncle's house had not\r\nbeen long when I found out that Armand was as good as engaged to\r\nMarcella, and Henrique to Eustachia, while Constantine, the youngest and\r\nhandsomest of the three brothers, paid vain though deferential court to\r\nConstanza.\r\n\r\nThe rising was not then publicly talked of, though known to be in full\r\npreparation throughout the country. All the young and brave hearts among\r\nus were pledged to it, and my cousins did not hesitate to tell me in\r\nconfidence that Count Emerich and his sister were its chief promoters in\r\nthat district. They had a devoted assistant in Father Cassimer. He had\r\nbeen their mother's confessor, and lived in the house for\r\nfive-and-thirty years, saying mass regularly in the parish church, a\r\npine-built edifice on the edge of the forest. Father Cassimer's hair was\r\nlike snow, but he was still erect, strong, and active. He said the\r\nchurch could not spare him, and he would live to a hundred. In some\r\nrespects, the man did deserve a century, being a good Pole and a worthy\r\npriest, notwithstanding one weakness which beset him, for Father\r\nCassimer took special delight in hunting. It was said that once, when\r\nrobed for mass, a wild boar chanced to stray past; whereon the good\r\npriest mounted his horse, which was usually fastened to the church-door,\r\nand started after the game in full canonicals. That was in his youth;\r\nbut Father Cassimer never denied the tale, and the peasants who\r\nremembered it had no less confidence in his prayers, for they knew he\r\nloved his country, and looked after the sick and poor. The priest was my\r\ncousin's instructor in wood-craft, and the boon-companion of my uncle;\r\nbut scarcely had I got well acquainted with him and the Lorenskis, when\r\ntwo Christmas visitors arrived at their house.\r\n\r\nThey were a brother and sister, Russian nobles, known as Count Theodore\r\nand Countess Juana. Their native place was St. Petersburg, but they had\r\nspent years in travelling over Europe; and though nobody knew the extent\r\nof their estates, it was supposed to be great, for they spared no\r\nexpense, and always kept the best society. Latterly they had been\r\nsomehow attracted to Poland, and became so popular among our country\r\nnobles, that they were invited from house to house, making new friends\r\nwherever they went, for Russians though they were, they wished well to\r\nour country, and, among their intimates, spoke of liberty and justice\r\nwith singular eloquence. Considering this, their popularity was no\r\nwonder. A handsomer or more accomplished pair I never saw. Both were\r\ntall, fair, and graceful, with hair of a light golden shade--the\r\nsister's descending almost to her feet when unbraided, and the brother's\r\nclustering in rich curls about the brow. They knew the dances of all\r\nnations, could play any thing that was ever invented, whether game or\r\ninstrument, and talked in every tongue of Europe, from Romaic to\r\nSwedish. Both could ride like Arabs. Count Theodore was a splendid shot,\r\nhis sister was matchless in singing, and neither was ever tired of fun\r\nor frolic. They seemed of the Lorenskis' years, but had seen more of the\r\nworld; and though scarcely so dignified, most people preferred the frank\r\nfamiliarity and lively converse of the travelled Russians.\r\n\r\nThe Lorenskis themselves could not but applaud that general preference.\r\nThey and the travellers had become fast friends almost on their first\r\nacquaintance, which took place in the previous winter; and Count\r\nTheodore and his sister had performed a long wintry journey from St.\r\nPetersburg to celebrate the Christmas time with them. Peasants and\r\nservants rejoiced at their coming, for they were known to be liberal.\r\nThe old priest said it had never been his luck to see any thing decent\r\nout of Russia before, and my uncle's entire household were delighted,\r\nwith the exception of Constantine. By and by, I guessed the cause of his\r\nhalf-concealed displeasure. The brother of each pair took wonderfully to\r\nthe sister of the other. Count Theodore talked of buying an estate in\r\nLithuania; and the young cousins predicted, that though Emerich and\r\nConstanza might be near neighbors, they would not live all their days\r\nfree and single. After the Russians' arrival, there was nothing but\r\nsport among us. We had dances and concerts, plays, and all manner of\r\ngames; but the deep snow of our Polish winter had not hardened to the\r\nusual strong ice, over marsh, river, and forest land. It continued\r\nfalling day after day, shutting all our amusements within doors, and\r\npreventing, to our general regret, the wonted wolf-hunt, always kept up\r\nin Lithuania from the middle of December till Christmas-eve.\r\n\r\nIt was a custom, time immemorial, in the province, and followed as much\r\nfor the amusement it afforded the young people, as for the destruction\r\nof the deadly prowler. The mode of conducting it was this: Every two or\r\nthree families who chanced to be intimate, when the ice was sufficiently\r\nstrong and smooth for sledge-travelling, sent forth a party of young\r\nhunters, with their sisters and sweethearts, in a sledge covered at the\r\none end, which was also well cushioned and gayly painted; the ladies in\r\ntheir best winter dresses took possession of it, while the hunters\r\noccupied the exposed part, with guns, shot-pouches, and hunting-knives,\r\nin complete readiness. Beside the driver, who was generally an old\r\nexperienced hand, there was placed a young hog, or a leg of pork,\r\noccasionally roasted to make the odor more inviting, and packed up with\r\ncords and straw in a pretty tight parcel, which was fastened to the\r\nsledge by a long rope twisted to almost iron hardness. Away they drove\r\nat full speed, and when fairly in the forest, the pork was thrown down,\r\nand allowed to drag after the sledge, the smell of it bringing wolves\r\nfrom every quarter, while the hunters fired at them as they advanced. I\r\nhave seen a score of skins collected in this manner, not to speak of the\r\nfun, the excitement, and the opportunities for exhibiting one's\r\nmarkmanship and courage where one would most wish to have seen them.\r\n\r\nThe peasants said it was never lucky when Christmas came without a\r\nwolf-hunt; but that year it was like to be so; for, as I have said, the\r\nsnow kept falling at intervals, with days of fog and thaw between, till\r\nthe night before the vigil. In my youth, the Lithuanians kept Christmas,\r\nafter the fashion of old northern times. It began with great devotion,\r\nand ended in greater feasting. The eve was considered particularly\r\nsacred: many traditional ceremonies and strange beliefs hung about it,\r\nand the more pious held that no one should engage in any profane\r\noccupation, or think of going to sleep after sunset. When it came, our\r\ndisappointment concerning the wolf-hunt lay heavy on many a mind as well\r\nas mine; but a strong frost had set in before daybreak, and at the early\r\nnightfall a finer prospect for sledging could not be desired--over the\r\nbroad plain, and far between the forest pines, the ice stretched away as\r\nsmooth and bright as a mirror. The moon was full, and the stars were out\r\nby thousands: you could have read large print by the cold, clear light,\r\nas my cousins and I stood at my uncle's door, fervently wishing it had\r\nbeen any other evening. Suddenly, our ears caught the sound of bells and\r\nlaughing voices, and in a few minutes up drove the Lorenski sledge in\r\nits gayest trappings, with Constanza, the Russian countess, and the\r\nyoung cousins, all looking blithe and rosy in the frosty air, while\r\nEmerich and Theodore sat in true hunter's trim, and Father Cassimer\r\nhimself in charge of the reins, with the well-covered pork beside him.\r\nThey had two noble horses of the best Tartar blood, unequalled in the\r\nprovince, as we knew, for speed and strength; and Emerich's cheerful\r\nvoice first saluted us with: \"Ho! friends, it is seven hours yet till\r\nmidnight: won't you come with us?--it is a shame to let Christmas in\r\nwithout a wolf-skin!\"\r\n\r\nThat was enough for us: we flew in for our equipments. My uncle was not\r\nat first willing that we should go; but the merry company now at his\r\ndoor, the unequivocal countenance which Father Cassimer gave to the\r\nproceeding, and the high spirits of the young Russians, who were, as\r\nusual, wild for the sport, made him think that, after all, there was no\r\nharm in the young people taking an hour or two in the woods before mass,\r\nwhich on Christmas-eve begins always at midnight. Our hunting-gear was\r\ndonned in a trice; and with my uncle's most trusty man, Metski, to\r\nassist in driving, away we went at full speed to the forest.\r\n\r\nFather Cassimer was an experienced general in expeditions of the kind;\r\nhe knew the turns of the woods where the wolves scented best; and when\r\nwe had got fairly among the tall oaks, down went his pork. For some time\r\nit dragged on without a single wolf appearing, though the odor came\r\nstrong and savory through cords and straw.\r\n\r\n\"If I were a wolf myself, I would come for that,\" said old Metski. The\r\npriest quickened his speed, vowing he would not say mass without a skin\r\nthat night; and we got deeper into the wilderness of oak and pine. Like\r\nmost of our Lithuanian forests, it had no underwood. There was ample\r\nspace for our sledge among the great trees, and the moonlight fell in a\r\nflood of brightness upon their huge white trunks, and through the\r\nfrost-covered branches. We could see the long icicles gleaming like\r\npendants of diamond for miles through the wide woods, but never a wolf.\r\nThe priest began to look disappointed; Metski sympathized with him, for\r\nhe relished a hunt almost as well as his reverence; but all the rest,\r\nwith the help of the Russians, amused themselves with _making_ game. I\r\nhave said they were in great spirits, particularly Count Theodore;\r\nindeed he was generally the gayer of the pair--his sister being\r\nevidently the more prudent--and in this respect they resembled the\r\nLorenskis. Many a jest, however, on the non-appearance of the wolves\r\nwent round our sledge, of which I remember nothing now, except that we\r\nall laughed till the old wood rang.\r\n\r\n\"Be quiet, good children,\" said the priest, turning in his seat of\r\ncommand: \"you make noise enough to frighten all the wolves in creation.\"\r\n\r\n\"They won't come to-night, father; they are preparing for mass,\" cried\r\nCount Theodore. \"Juana, if the old Finn were here now, wouldn't he be\r\nuseful?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps he might,\" said the countess, with a forced laugh; but she cast\r\na look of strange warning and reproof on her brother.\r\n\r\n\"What Finn?\" said the priest, catching the count's words.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he is talking of an old nursery-tale we had in St. Petersburg,\"\r\nhastily interposed the lady, though I thought her face had no memory of\r\nthe nursery in it.\r\n\r\n\"About the Finns I'll warrant,\" said Father Cassimer. \"They are a\r\nstrange people. My brother the merchant told me that he knew one of them\r\nat Abo who said he had a charm for the wolves; but somebody informed\r\nagainst him for smuggling, and the Russian government sent him to the\r\nlead mines in Siberia. By Saint Sigismund, there's the first of them!\"\r\n\r\nAs the priest spoke, a large wolf appeared, and half the guns in the\r\nsledge were raised. \"Not yet, not yet,\" said our experienced commander,\r\nartfully turning away as another and another came in sight. \"There are\r\nmore coming,\" and he gradually slackened our pace; but far off through\r\nthe moonlit woods and the frozen night we could hear a strange murmur,\r\nwhich grew and swelled on all sides to a chorus of mingled howlings, and\r\nthe wolves came on by troops.\r\n\r\n\"Fire now, friends!\" cried Father Cassimer. \"We are like to have skins\r\nenough for Christmas;\" and bang went all our barrels. I saw five fall:\r\nbut, contrary to expectation, the wolves did not retire--they stood for\r\nan instant snarling at us. The distant howlings continued and came\r\nnearer; and then from every glade and alley, down the frozen stream, and\r\nthrough the wide openings of the forest, came by scores and hundreds\r\nsuch a multitude of wolves as we could not have believed to exist in all\r\nLithuania.\r\n\r\n\"Hand me my gun, and take the reins, Metski,\" cried Father Cassimer.\r\n\"Drive for your life!\" he added in an under tone; but every one in the\r\nsledge heard him. Heaven knows how many we killed; but it seemed of no\r\nuse. Our pork was swallowed, straw and all. The creatures were pressing\r\nupon us on every side, as if trying to surround the sledge; and it was\r\nfearful to see the leaps that some gray old fellows among them would\r\ntake at Metski and the horses. Our driver did his part like a man,\r\nmaking a thousand winds and turns through the woods; but still the\r\nwolves pursued us. Fortunately, the firing kept them off, and, thanks to\r\nour noble horses, they were never able to get ahead of us; but as far as\r\nwe could see behind us in the moonlight, came the howling packs, as if\r\nrising from the ground of the forest. We had seen nothing like it, and\r\nall did their best in firing, especially Count Theodore; but his shots\r\nhad little effect, for his hand shook, and I know not if any but myself\r\nsaw the looks of terrified intelligence which he exchanged with his\r\nsister. Still, she and the Lady Constanza kept up their courage, though\r\nthe young cousins were as white as snow, and our ammunition was fast\r\ndecreasing.\r\n\r\n\"Yonder is a light,\" said Constanza at last, as the poor horses became\r\nunmanageable, from fright and weariness. \"It is from the cottage of old\r\nWenzel, the woodman.\"\r\n\r\n\"If we could reach that,\" said Father Cassimer, \"and leave the horses to\r\ntheir fate: it is our only chance.\"\r\n\r\nNo one contradicted the priest's arrangement, for his last words were\r\nfelt to be true--though a pang passed over Constanza's face at the\r\nthought of leaving our brave and faithful horses to the wolves; but\r\nlouder rose the howls behind us, as Metski urged on with all his might,\r\nand far above all went the shout of Father Cassimer (he had the best\r\nlungs in that province): \"Ho Wenzel! open the door to us for God's\r\nsake!\"\r\n\r\nWe heard the old man reply, sent one well-aimed volley among the wolves,\r\nand as they recoiled, man and woman leaped from the sledge--for our\r\nPolish girls are active--and rushed into the cottage, when old Wenzel\r\ninstantly double-barred the door. It was woful to hear the cry of pain\r\nand terror from our poor horses as we deserted them; the next instant\r\nthe wolves were upon them. We saw them from the window, as thick as ever\r\nflies stuck on sugar. How we fired upon them, and with what good-will\r\nold Wenzel helped us, praying all the time to every saint in the\r\ncalendar, you may imagine! But still their numbers were increasing; and\r\nas a pause came in the fearful din, we plainly heard through the still\r\nair the boom of our own great bell, ringing for the midnight mass. At\r\nthat sound, Father Cassimer's countenance fell for the first time. He\r\nknew the bellman was a poor half-witted fellow, who would not be\r\nsensible of his absence; and then he turned to have another shot at the\r\nwolves.\r\n\r\nShots were by this time getting scarce among us. There was not a man\r\nthat had a charge left but old Wenzel, who had supplied us as long as he\r\ncould; but at length, loading his own gun with his last charge, he laid\r\nit quietly in the corner, saying one didn't know what use might be for\r\nit, and he never liked an empty gun.\r\n\r\nWenzel was the son of a small innkeeper at Grodno, but after his\r\nfather's decease, which occurred when he was a child, his mother had\r\nmarried a Russian trader, who, when she died, carried the boy to Moscow.\r\nThere Wenzel bade fair to be brought up a Russian; but when a stepmother\r\ncame home, which took place while he was still a youth, he had returned\r\nto his native country, built himself a hut in the woods of Lithuania,\r\nand lived a lonely hunter till the time of my story, when he was still a\r\nrobust, though gray-haired man. Some said his Muscovite parents had not\r\nbeen to his liking; some that he had found cause to shoot a master to\r\nwhom they apprenticed him at Moscow; but be that as it might, Wenzel\r\nhated the Russians with all his heart, and never scrupled to say that\r\nthe gun which had served him so long would serve the country too if it\r\never came to a rising. So much for Wenzel's story, by way of explaining\r\nwhat followed; but as I stood beside him that night at the hut's single\r\ncrevice of a window, I could have given Poland itself for ammunition\r\nenough to do service on the wolves. They had now left nothing but the\r\nbones of our horses, which they dragged round and round the cottage,\r\nwith a din of howlings that almost drowned our voices within. Then they\r\nseized on the bodies of their own slain companions, which were devoured\r\nto the very skins; and still the gathering was going on. We could see\r\nthem coming in troops through the open glades of the forest, as if aware\r\nthat some human prey was in reserve. The hut was strongly built of great\r\npine-logs, but it was fearful to bear them tearing at the door and\r\nscratching up the foundations. The bravest among us got terrified at\r\nthese sounds. Metski loudly avowed his belief that the wolves were sent\r\nupon us as a punishment for hunting on Christmas-eve, and fell instantly\r\nto his prayers. Wenzel flung a blazing brand among them from the window,\r\nbut they did not seem to care for fire; and three of them were so near\r\nleaping in, that he drove to the log-shutter and gave up that method of\r\ndefence. None of the party appeared so far overcome with terror as Count\r\nTheodore: his spirit and prudence both seemed to forsake him. When the\r\nwolves began to scratch, he threw himself almost on his face in the\r\ncorner, and kept moaning and praying in Russian, of which none of us\r\nunderstood a syllable but old Wenzel. Emerich and I would have spoken to\r\nhim, but the woodman stopped us with a strange sign. Count Theodore had\r\ntaken the relic of some saint from a pocket-book which he carried in his\r\nbreast, and was, in Russian fashion as I think, confessing his sins over\r\nit; while his sister sat silent and motionless by the fire, with livid\r\nface and clasped hands. It was burning low, but I saw the woodman's face\r\ndarken. He stepped to the corner and took down his gun, as I believed,\r\nto take the last shot at the wolves; but Count Theodore was in his way.\r\nHe levelled it for an instant at the prostrate man, and before I could\r\nspeak or interpose, the report, followed by a faint shrill shriek from\r\nthe Russian, rang through the hut. We rushed to him, but the Count was\r\ndead. A bullet had gone right through the heart.\r\n\r\n\"My gun has shot the count, and the wolves will leave us now,\" said\r\nWenzel coolly. \"I heard him say in his prayers that a Finn, now in the\r\nSiberian mines, had vowed to send them on him and his company wherever\r\nhe went.\"\r\n\r\nAs the woodman spoke, he handed to Count Emerich, with a hoarse whisper,\r\na bloody pocket-book, taken from the dead body, and turning to Juana,\r\nsaid something loud and threatening to her in the Russian tongue; at\r\nwhich the lady only bowed her head, seeming of all in the hut to be the\r\nleast surprised or concerned at the death of her brother. As for us, the\r\ncomplicated horrors of the night had left us stunned and stupefied till\r\nthe rapid diminution of the wolfish din, the sounds of shots and voices,\r\nand the glare of flambeaux lighting up the forest, brought most of us\r\nto the window. The wolves were scouring away in all directions, there\r\nwas a grayness in the eastern sky, for Christmas-day was breaking; and\r\nfrom all sides the count and my uncle's tenantry, with skates and\r\nsledges, guns and torches, were pouring to the rescue as we shouted to\r\nthem from the cottage.\r\n\r\nThey had searched for us almost since midnight, tearing that something\r\nterrible had detained Father Cassimer and his company from mass. There\r\nwere wonderfully few wolves shot in the retreat, and we all went home to\r\nCount Emerich's house, but not in triumph, for with us went the body of\r\nthe Russian, of which old Wenzel was one of the bearers. The unanimous\r\ndetermination we expressed to bring him to justice as a murderer, was\r\nsilenced when Emerich showed us in confidence a letter from the Russian\r\nminister, and a paper with all our names in a list of the disaffected in\r\nUpper Lithuania, which he had found in Theodore's pocket-book. After\r\nthat, we all affirmed that Wenzel's gun had gone off by accident; and on\r\nthe same good Christmas-day, Count Emerich, with a body of his\r\nretainers, escorted the Lady Juana to a convent at the other end of the\r\nprovince, the superior of which was his aunt. There she became a true\r\nCatholic, professed, and, as I was told, turned to a great saint. There\r\nis a wooden cross with his name, and a Latin inscription on it, marking\r\nCount Theodore's grave, by our old church on the edge of the forest.\r\n\r\nNo one ever inquired after him, and the company of that terrible night\r\nare far scattered. My uncle and his sons all died for the poor country.\r\nThe young cousins are married to German doctors in Berlin. Constanza and\r\nher brother are still single, for aught I know, but they have been\r\nexiles in America these fifteen years. Father Cassimer went with them,\r\nafter being colonel of a regiment which saw hard service on the banks of\r\nthe Vistula; and it may be that he is still saying mass or hunting\r\noccasionally in the Far West.\r\n\r\nThe last time I saw Wenzel and Metski was in the trenches at Minsk,\r\nwhere they had a tough debate regarding our adventure in the forest: the\r\nwoodman insisting it was the Finn's spell that brought the wolves in\r\nsuch unheard-of numbers, and the peasant maintaining that it was a\r\njudgment on our desecration of Christmas-eve. For my own part, I think\r\nthe long storm, and a great scarcity of food had something to do with\r\nit, for tales of the kind were never wanting in our province. The\r\nwolf-gathering, however, saved us a journey to Siberia: thanks to old\r\nWenzel. And sometimes yet, when any strange noise breaks in upon my\r\nsleep even here in England, I dream of being in his wild hut in the\r\nforest and listening to the wolfish voices at the door.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMY NOVEL:\r\n\r\nOR, VARIETIES IN ENGLISH LIFE.[20]\r\n\r\nBY PISISTRATUS CAXTON.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IX. CONTINUED--CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nWith a slow step and an abstracted air, Harley L'Estrange bent his way\r\ntowards Egerton's house, after his eventful interview with Helen. He had\r\njust entered one of the streets leading into Grosvenor Square, when a\r\nyoung man, walking quickly from the opposite direction, came full\r\nagainst him, and drawing back with a brief apology, recognized him, and\r\nexclaimed, \"What! you in England, Lord L'Estrange! Accept my\r\ncongratulations on your return. But you seem scarcely to remember me.\"\r\n\r\n\"I beg your pardon, Mr. Leslie. I remember you now, by your smile; but\r\nyou are of an age in which it is permitted me to say that you look older\r\nthan when I saw you last.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet, Lord L'Estrange, it seems to me that you look younger.\"\r\n\r\nIndeed this reply was so far true that there appeared less difference of\r\nyears than before between Leslie and L'Estrange; for the wrinkles in the\r\nschemer's mind were visible in his visage, while Harley's dreamy worship\r\nof Truth and Beauty seemed to have preserved to the votary the enduring\r\nyouth of the divinities.\r\n\r\nHarley received the compliment with a supreme indifference, which might\r\nhave been suitable to a Stoic, but which seemed scarcely natural to a\r\ngentleman who had just proposed to a lady many years younger than\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nLeslie renewed--\"Perhaps you are on your way to Mr. Egerton's. If so,\r\nyou will not find him at home; he is at his office.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you. Then to his office I must re-direct my steps.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am going to him myself,\" said Randal hesitatingly.\r\n\r\nL'Estrange had no prepossessions in favor of Leslie, from the little he\r\nhad seen of that young gentleman; but Randal's remark was an appeal to\r\nhis habitual urbanity, and he replied with well-bred readiness, \"Let us\r\nbe companions so far.\"\r\n\r\nRandal accepted the arm proffered to him; and Lord L'Estrange, as is\r\nusual with one long absent from his native land, bore part as a\r\nquestioner in the dialogue that ensued.\r\n\r\n\"Egerton is always the same man, I suppose--too busy for illness, and\r\ntoo firm for sorrow?\"\r\n\r\n\"If he ever feel either he will never stoop to complain. But indeed, my\r\ndear lord, I should like much to know what you think of his health.\"\r\n\r\n\"How? You alarm me!\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, I did not mean to do that; and pray, do not let him know that I\r\nwent so far. But I have fancied that he looks a little worn, and\r\nsuffering.\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor Audley!\" said L'Estrange, in a tone of deep affection. \"I will\r\nsound him, and, be assured, without naming you; for I know well how\r\nlittle he likes to be supposed capable of human infirmity. I am obliged\r\nto you for your hint--obliged to you for your interest in one so dear to\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nAnd Harley's voice was more cordial to Randal than it had ever been\r\nbefore. He then begged to inquire what Randal thought of the rumors that\r\nhad reached himself as to the probable defeat of the government, and how\r\nfar Audley's spirits were affected by such risks. But Randal here,\r\nseeing that Harley could communicate nothing, was reserved and guarded.\r\n\r\n\"Loss of office could not, I think, affect a man like Audley,\" observed\r\nLord L'Estrange. \"He would be as great in opposition, perhaps greater;\r\nand as to emoluments\"----\r\n\r\n\"The emoluments are good,\" interposed Randal, with a half sigh.\r\n\r\n\"Good enough, I suppose, to pay him back about a tenth of what his place\r\ncosts our magnificent friend. No, I will say one thing for English\r\nstatesmen, no man amongst them ever yet was the richer for place.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Mr. Egerton's private fortune must be large, I take for granted,\"\r\nsaid Randal carelessly.\r\n\r\n\"It ought to be, if he has time to look to it.\"\r\n\r\nHere they passed by the hotel in which lodged the Count di Peschiera.\r\n\r\nRandal stopped. \"Will you excuse me for an instant? As we are passing\r\nthis hotel, I will just leave my card here.\" So saying, he gave his card\r\nto a waiter lounging by the door. \"For the Count di Peschiera,\" said he\r\naloud.\r\n\r\nL'Estrange started; and as Randal again took his arm, said--\r\n\r\n\"So that Italian lodges here? and you know him?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know him but slightly, as one knows any foreigner who makes a\r\nsensation.\"\r\n\r\n\"He makes a sensation?\"\r\n\r\n\"Naturally; for he is handsome, witty, and said to be very rich--that\r\nis, as long as he receives the revenues of his exiled kinsman.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see you are well informed, Mr. Leslie. And what is supposed to bring\r\nhither the Count di Peschiera?\"\r\n\r\n\"I did hear something, which I did not quite understand, about a bet of\r\nhis that he would marry his kinsman's daughter; and so, I conclude,\r\nsecure to himself all the inheritance; and that he is therefore here to\r\ndiscover the kinsman and win the heiress. But probably you know the\r\nrights of the story, and can tell me what credit to give to such\r\ngossip.\"\r\n\r\n\"I know this at least, that if he did lay such a wager, I would advise\r\nyou to take any odds against him that his backers may give,\" said\r\nL'Estrange, dryly; and while his lip quivered with anger, his eye\r\ngleamed with arch ironical humor.\r\n\r\n\"You think, then, that this poor kinsman will not need such an alliance\r\nin order to regain his estates?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; for I never yet knew a rogue whom I would not bet against, when he\r\nbacked his own luck as a rogue against Justice and Providence.\"\r\n\r\nRandal winced, and felt as if an arrow had grazed his heart; but he soon\r\nrecovered.\r\n\r\n\"And indeed there is another vague rumor that the young lady in question\r\nis married already--to some Englishman.\"\r\n\r\nThis time it was Harley who winced. \"Good Heavens! that cannot be\r\ntrue--that would undo all! An Englishman just at this moment! But some\r\nEnglishman of correspondent rank, I trust, or at least one known for\r\nopinions opposed to what an Austrian would call revolutionary\r\ndoctrines?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know nothing. But it was supposed, merely a private gentleman of good\r\nfamily. Would not that suffice? Can the Austrian Count dictate a\r\nmarriage to the daughter as a condition of grace to the father?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, not that!\" said Harley, greatly disturbed. \"But put yourself in the\r\nposition of any minister to one of the greatest European monarchies.\r\nSuppose a political insurgent, formidable for station and wealth, had\r\nbeen proscribed, much interest made on his behalf, a powerful party\r\nstriving against it, and just when the minister is disposed to relent,\r\nhe hears that the heiress to this wealth and this station is married to\r\nthe native of a country in which sentiments friendly to the very\r\nopinions for which the insurgent was proscribed are popularly\r\nentertained, and thus that the fortune to be restored may be so employed\r\nas to disturb the national security--the existing order of things; this,\r\ntoo, at the very time when a popular revolution has just occurred in\r\nFrance,[21] and its effects are felt most in the very land of the\r\nexile;--suppose all this, and then say if any thing could be more\r\nuntoward for the hopes of the banished man, or furnish his adversaries\r\nwith stronger arguments against the restoration of his fortune? But\r\npshaw! this must be a chimera! If true, I should have known of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I quite agree with your lordship--there can be no truth in such a\r\nrumor. Some Englishman hearing, perhaps, of the probable pardon of the\r\nexile, may have counted on an heiress, and spread the report in order to\r\nkeep off other candidates. By your account, if successful in his suit,\r\nhe might fail to find an heiress in the bride?\"\r\n\r\n\"No doubt of that. Whatever might be arranged, I can't conceive that he\r\nwould be allowed to get at the fortune, though it might be held in\r\nsuspense for his children. But indeed it so rarely happens that an\r\nItalian girl of high name marries a foreigner, that we must dismiss\r\nthis notion with a smile at the long face of the hypothetical\r\nfortune-hunter. Heaven help him, if he exist!\"\r\n\r\n\"Amen,\" echoed Randal, devoutly.\r\n\r\n\"I hear that Peschiara's sister is returned to England. Do you know her\r\ntoo?\"\r\n\r\n\"A little.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear Mr. Leslie, pardon me if I take a liberty not warranted by our\r\nacquaintance. Against the lady I say nothing. Indeed, I have heard some\r\nthings which appear to entitle her to compassion and respect. But as to\r\nPeschiera, all who prize honor suspect him to be a knave--I know him to\r\nbe one. Now, I think that the longer we preserve that abhorrence for\r\nknavery which is the generous instinct of youth, why, the fairer will be\r\nour manhood, and the more reverend our age. You agree with me?\" And\r\nHarley suddenly turning, his eyes fell like a flood of light upon\r\nRandal's pale and secret countenance.\r\n\r\n\"To be sure,\" murmured the schemer.\r\n\r\nHarley surveying him, mechanically recoiled, and withdrew his arm.\r\n\r\nFortunately for Randal, who somehow or other felt himself slipped into a\r\nfalse position, he scarce knew how or why, he was here seized by the\r\narm; and a clear, open, manly voice cried, \"My dear fellow, how are you?\r\nI see you are engaged now; but look into my rooms when you can, in the\r\ncourse of the day.\"\r\n\r\nAnd, with a bow of excuse for his interruption, to Lord L'Estrange, the\r\nspeaker was then turning away, when Harley said:\r\n\r\n\"No, don't let me take you from your friend, Mr. Leslie. And you need\r\nnot be in a hurry to see Egerton; for I shall claim the privilege of\r\nolder friendship for the first interview.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is Mr. Egerton's nephew, Frank Hazeldean.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pray, call him back, and present me to him. He has a face that would\r\nhave gone far to reconcile Timon to Athens.\"\r\n\r\nRandal obeyed; and after a few kindly words to Frank, Harley insisted on\r\nleaving the two young men together, and walked on to Downing-street with\r\na brisker step.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\"That Lord L'Estrange seems a very good fellow.\"\r\n\r\n\"So-so; an effeminate humorist; says the most absurd things, and fancies\r\nthem wise. Never mind him. You wanted to speak to me, Frank?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; I am so obliged to you for introducing me to Levy. I must tell you\r\nhow handsomely he has behaved.\"\r\n\r\n\"Stop; allow me to remind you that I did not introduce you to Levy; you\r\nhad met him before at Borrowell's, if I recollect right, and he dined\r\nwith us at the Clarendon--that is all I had to do with bringing you\r\ntogether. Indeed, I rather cautioned you against him than not. Pray,\r\ndon't think I introduced you to a man who, however pleasant, and perhaps\r\nhonest, is still a money-lender. Your father would be justly angry with\r\nme if I had done so.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, pooh! you are prejudiced against poor Levy. But just hear: I was\r\nsitting very ruefully, thinking over those cursed bills, and how the\r\ndeuce I should renew them, when Levy walked into my rooms; and after\r\ntelling me of his long friendship for my uncle Egerton, and his\r\nadmiration for yourself, and (give me your hand, Randal) saying how\r\ntouched he felt by your kind sympathy in my troubles, he opened his\r\npocket-book, and showed me the bills safe and sound in his own\r\npossession.\"\r\n\r\n\"How?\"\r\n\r\n\"He had bought them up. 'It must be so disagreeable to me,' he said, 'to\r\nhave them flying about the London money-market, and these Jews would be\r\nsure sooner or later to apply to my father. And now,' added Levy, 'I am\r\nin no immediate hurry for the money, and we must put the interest upon\r\nfairer terms.' In short, nothing could be more liberal than his tone.\r\nAnd he says, 'he is thinking on a way to relieve me altogether, and will\r\ncall about it in a few days, when his plan is matured.' After all, I\r\nmust owe this to you, Randal. I dare swear you put it into his head.\"\r\n\r\n\"O no, indeed! On the contrary, I still say, 'Be cautious in all your\r\ndealings with Levy.' I don't know, I am sure, what he means to propose.\r\nHave you heard from the Hall lately?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--to-day. Only think--the Riccaboccas have disappeared. My mother\r\nwrites me word of it--a very odd letter. She seems to suspect that I\r\nknow where they are, and reproaches me for 'mystery'--quite enigmatical.\r\nBut there is one sentence in her letter--see, here it is in the\r\npostscript--which seems to refer to Beatrice: 'I don't ask you to tell\r\nme your secrets, Frank, but Randal will no doubt have assured you that\r\nmy first consideration will be for your own happiness, in any matter in\r\nwhich your heart is really engaged.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Randal, slowly; \"no doubt, this refers to Beatrice; but, as\r\nI told you, your mother will not interfere one way or the other,--such\r\ninterference would weaken her influence with the Squire. Besides, as she\r\nsaid, she can't _wish_ you to marry a foreigner; though once married,\r\nshe would----But how do you stand now with the Marchesa? Has she\r\nconsented to accept you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not quite: indeed, I have not actually proposed. Her manner, though\r\nmuch softened, has not so far emboldened me; and, besides, before a\r\npositive declaration, I certainly must go down to the Hall, and speak at\r\nleast to my mother.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must judge for yourself, but don't do any thing rash: talk first\r\nto me. Here we are at my office. Good bye; and--and pray believe that,\r\nin whatever you do with Levy, I have no hand in it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nTowards the evening, Randal was riding fast on the road to Norwood. The\r\narrival of Harley, and the conversation that had passed between that\r\nnobleman and Randal, made the latter anxious to ascertain how far\r\nRiccabocca was likely to learn L'Estrange's return to England, and to\r\nmeet with him. For he felt that, should the latter come to know that\r\nRiccabocca, in his movements, had gone by Randal's advice, Harley would\r\nfind that Randal had spoken to him disingenuously; and, on the other\r\nhand, Riccabocca, placed under the friendly protection of Lord\r\nL'Estrange, would no longer need Randal Leslie to defend him from the\r\nmachinations of Peschiera. To a reader happily unaccustomed to dive into\r\nthe deep and mazy recesses of a schemer's mind, it might seem that\r\nRandal's interest, in retaining a hold over the exile's confidence,\r\nwould terminate with the assurances that had reached him, from more than\r\none quarter, that Violante might cease to be an heiress if she married\r\nhimself. \"But, perhaps,\" suggests some candid and youthful\r\nconjecturer--\"perhaps Randal Leslie is in love with this fair creature?\"\r\nRandal in love!--no! He was too absorbed by harder passions for that\r\nblissful folly. Nor, if he could have fallen in love, was Violante the\r\none to attract that sullen, secret heart; her instinctive nobleness, the\r\nvery stateliness of her beauty, womanlike though it was, awed him. Men\r\nof that kind may love some soft slave--they cannot lift their eyes to a\r\nqueen. They may look down--they cannot look up. But, on the one hand,\r\nRandal, could not resign altogether the _chance_ of securing a fortune\r\nthat would realize his most dazzling dreams, upon the mere assurance,\r\nhowever probable, which had so dismayed him; and, on the other hand,\r\nshould he be compelled to relinquish all idea of such alliance, though\r\nhe did not contemplate the base perfidy of actually assisting\r\nPeschiera's avowed designs, still, if Frank's marriage with Beatrice\r\nshould absolutely depend upon her brother's obtaining the knowledge of\r\nViolante's retreat, and that marriage should be as conducive to his\r\ninterests as he thought he could make it, why,--he did not then push his\r\ndeductions farther, even to himself--they seemed too black; but he\r\nsighed heavily, and that sigh foreboded how weak would be honor and\r\nvirtue against avarice and ambition. Therefore, on all accounts,\r\nRiccabocca was one of those cards in a sequence, which so calculating a\r\nplayer would not throw out of his hand: it _might_ serve for repique at\r\nthe worst--it might score well in the game. Intimacy with the Italian\r\nwas still part and parcel in that knowledge which was the synonym of\r\npower.\r\n\r\nWhile the young man was thus meditating, on his road to Norwood,\r\nRiccabocca and his Jemima were close conferring in their drawing-room.\r\nAnd if you could have there seen them, reader, you would have been\r\nseized with equal surprise and curiosity; for some extraordinary\r\ncommunication had certainly passed between them. Riccabocca was\r\nevidently much agitated, and with emotions not familiar to him. The\r\ntears stood in his eyes at the same time that a smile, the reverse of\r\ncynical or sardonic, curved his lips; while his wife was leaning her\r\nhead on his shoulder, her hand clasped in his, and, by the expression of\r\nher face, you might guess that he had paid her some very gratifying\r\ncompliments, of a nature more genuine and sincere than those which\r\ncharacterized his habitual hollow and dissimulating gallantry. But just\r\nat this moment Giacomo entered, and Jemima, with her native English\r\nmodesty, withdrew in haste from Riccabocca's sheltering side.\r\n\r\n\"Padrone,\" said Giacomo, who, whatever his astonishment at the connubial\r\nposition he had disturbed, was much too discreet to betray it--\"Padrone,\r\nI see the young Englishman riding towards the house, and I hope, when he\r\narrives, you will not forget the alarming information I gave you this\r\nmorning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah--ah!\" said Riccabocca, his face falling.\r\n\r\n\"If the Signorina were but married!\"\r\n\r\n\"My very thought--my constant thought!\" exclaimed Riccabocca. \"And you\r\nreally believe the young Englishman loves her?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why else should he come, Excellency?\" asked Giacomo, with great\r\n_naiveté_.\r\n\r\n\"Very true; why, indeed?\" said Riccabocca. \"Jemima, I cannot endure the\r\nterrors I suffer on that poor child's account. I will open myself\r\nfrankly to Randal Leslie. And now, too, that which might have been a\r\nserious consideration, in case I return to Italy, will no longer stand\r\nin our way, Jemima.\"\r\n\r\nJemima smiled faintly, and whispered something to Riccabocca, to which\r\nhe replied--\r\n\r\n\"Nonsense, _anima mia_. I know it _will_ be--have not a doubt of it. I\r\ntell you it is as nine to four, according to the nicest calculations. I\r\nwill speak at once to Randal. He is too young--too timid to speak\r\nhimself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" interposed Giacomo; \"how could he dare to speak, let him\r\nlove ever so well?\"\r\n\r\nJemima shook her head.\r\n\r\n\"O, never fear,\" said Riccabocca, observing this gesture; \"I will give\r\nhim the trial. If he entertain but mercenary views, I shall soon detect\r\nthem. I know human nature pretty well, I think, my love; and,\r\nGiacomo--just give me my Machiavel;--that's right. Now, leave me, my\r\ndear; I must reflect and prepare myself.\"\r\n\r\nWhen Randal entered the house, Giacomo, with a smile of peculiar\r\nsuavity, ushered him into the drawing-room. He found Riccabocca alone,\r\nand seated before the fireplace, leaning his face on his hand, with the\r\ngreat folio of Machiavel lying open upon the table.\r\n\r\nThe Italian received him as courteously as usual; but there was in his\r\nmanner a certain serious and thoughtful dignity, which was perhaps the\r\nmore imposing, because but rarely assumed. After a few preliminary\r\nobservations, Randal remarked that Frank Hazeldean had informed him of\r\nthe curiosity which the disappearance of the Riccaboccas had excited at\r\nthe Hall, and inquired carelessly if the Doctor had left instructions as\r\nto the forwarding of any letters that might be directed to him at the\r\nCasino.\r\n\r\n\"Letters,\" said Riccabocca, simply--\"I never receive any; or, at least,\r\nso rarely, that it was not worth while to take an event so little to be\r\nexpected into consideration. No; if any letters do reach the Casina,\r\nthere they will wait.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I can see no possibility of indiscretion; no chance of a clue to\r\nyour address.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nor I either.\"\r\n\r\nSatisfied so far, and knowing that it was not in Riccabocca's habits to\r\nread the newspapers, by which he might otherwise have learnt of\r\nL'Estrange's arrival in London, Randal then proceeded to inquire, with\r\nmuch seeming interest, into the health of Violante--hoped it did not\r\nsuffer by confinement, &c. Riccabocca eyed him gravely while he spoke,\r\nand then suddenly rising, that air of dignity to which I have before\r\nreferred, became yet more striking.\r\n\r\n\"My young friend,\" said he, \"hear me attentively, and answer me frankly.\r\nI know human nature\"--Here a slight smile of proud complacency passed\r\nthe sage's lips, and his eye glanced towards his Machiavel.\r\n\r\n\"I know human nature, at least I have studied it,\" he renewed more\r\nearnestly, and with less evident self-conceit, \"and I believe that when\r\na perfect stranger to me exhibits an interest in my affairs, which\r\noccasions him no small trouble--an interest (continued the wise man,\r\nlaying his hand upon Randal's shoulder) which scarcely a son could\r\nexceed, he must be under the influence of some strong personal motive.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, sir!\" cried Randal, turning a shade more pale, and with a faltering\r\ntone. Riccabocca surveyed him with the tenderness of a superior being,\r\nand pursued his deductive theories.\r\n\r\n\"In your case, what is that motive? Not political; for I conclude you\r\nshare the opinions of your government, and those opinions have not\r\nfavored mine. Not that of pecuniary or ambitious calculations; for how\r\ncan such calculations enlist you on behalf of a ruined exile? What\r\nremains? Why, the motive which at your age is ever the most natural, and\r\nthe strongest. I don't blame you. Machiavel himself allows that such a\r\nmotive has swayed the wisest minds, and overturned the most solid\r\nstates. In a word, young man, you are in love, and with my daughter\r\nViolante.\"\r\n\r\nRandal was so startled by this direct and unexpected charge upon his own\r\nmasked batteries, that he did not even attempt his defence. His head\r\ndrooped on his breast, and he remained speechless.\r\n\r\n\"I do not doubt,\" resumed the penetrating judge of human nature, \"that\r\nyou would have been withheld by the laudable and generous scruples which\r\ncharacterize your happy age, from voluntarily disclosing to me the state\r\nof your heart. You might suppose that, proud of the position I once\r\nheld, or sanguine in the hope of regaining my inheritance, I might be\r\nover-ambitious in my matrimonial views for Violante; or that you,\r\nanticipating my restoration to honors and fortune, might seem actuated\r\nby the last motives which influence love and youth; and, therefore, my\r\ndear young friend, I have departed from the ordinary custom in England,\r\nand adopted a very common one in my own country. With us, a suitor\r\nseldom presents himself till he is assured of the consent of a father. I\r\nhave only to say this--If I am right, and you love my daughter, my first\r\nobject in life is to see her safe and secure; and, in a word--you\r\nunderstand me.\"\r\n\r\nNow, mightily may it comfort and console us ordinary mortals, who\r\nadvance no pretence to superior wisdom and ability, to see the huge\r\nmistakes made by both these very sagacious personages--Dr. Riccabocca,\r\nvaluing himself on his profound acquaintance with character, and Randal\r\nLeslie, accustomed to grope into every hole and corner of thought and\r\naction, wherefrom to extract that knowledge which is power! For whereas\r\nthe sage, judging not only by his own heart in youth, but by the general\r\ninfluence of the master passion on the young, had ascribed to Randal\r\nsentiments wholly foreign to that able diplomatist's nature, so no\r\nsooner had Riccabocca brought his speech to a close, than Randal,\r\njudging also by his own heart, and by the general laws which influence\r\nmen of the mature age and boasted worldly wisdom of the pupil of\r\nMachiavel, instantly decided that Riccabocca presumed upon his youth and\r\ninexperience, and meant most nefariously to take him in.\r\n\r\n\"The poor youth!\" thought Riccabocca, \"how unprepared he is for the\r\nhappiness I give him!\"\r\n\r\n\"The cunning old Jesuit!\" thought Randal; \"he has certainly learned,\r\nsince we met last, that he has no chance of regaining his patrimony, and\r\nso he wants to impose on me the hand of a girl without a shilling. What\r\nother motive can he possibly have? Had his daughter the remotest\r\nprobability of becoming the greatest heiress in Italy, would he dream of\r\nbestowing her on me in this off-hand way? The thing stands to reason.\"\r\n\r\nActuated by his resentment at the trap thus laid for him, Randal was\r\nabout to disclaim altogether the disinterested and absurd affection laid\r\nto his charge, when it occurred to him that, by so doing, he might\r\nmortally offend the Italian--since the cunning never forgive those who\r\nrefuse to be duped by them--and it might still be conducive to his\r\ninterest to preserve intimate and familiar terms with Riccabocca;\r\ntherefore, subduing his first impulse, he exclaimed,\r\n\r\n\"O too generous man! pardon me if I have so long been unable to express\r\nmy amaze, my gratitude; but I cannot--no, I cannot, while your prospects\r\nremain thus uncertain, avail myself of your--of your inconsiderate\r\nmagnanimity. Your rare conduct can only redouble my own scruples, if\r\nyou, as I firmly hope and believe, are restored to your great\r\npossessions,--you would naturally look so much higher than me. Should\r\nthose hopes fail, then, indeed, it may be different; yet even then, what\r\nposition, what fortune, have I to offer to your daughter worthy of her?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are well born: all gentlemen are equals,\" said Riccabocca, with a\r\nsort of easy nobleness. \"You have youth, information, talent--sources of\r\ncertain wealth in this happy country--powerful connections; and, in\r\nfine, if you are satisfied with marrying for love, I shall be\r\ncontented;--if not, speak openly. As to the restoration to my\r\npossessions, I can scarcely think that probable while my enemy\r\nlives. And even in that case, since I saw you last, something has\r\noccurred (added Riccabocca with a strange smile, which seemed\r\nto Randal singularly sinister and malignant) that may remove all\r\ndifficulties.--Meanwhile, do not think me so extravagantly\r\nmagnanimous--do not underrate the satisfaction I must feel at knowing\r\nViolante safe from the designs of Peschiera--safe, and for ever, under a\r\nhusband's roof. I will tell you an Italian proverb--it contains a truth\r\nfull of wisdom and terror:--\r\n\r\n    \"'Hai cinquanta Amici?--non basta.--Hai un Nemico?--è troppo.'\"[22]\r\n\r\n\"Something has occurred!\" echoed Randal, not heeding the conclusion of\r\nthis speech, and scarcely hearing the proverb which the sage delivered\r\nin his most emphatic and tragic tone. \"Something has occurred! My dear\r\nfriend, be plainer. What has occurred?\" Riccabocca remained silent.\r\n\"Something that induces you to bestow your daughter on me?\"\r\n\r\nRiccabocca nodded, and emitted a low chuckle.\r\n\r\n\"The very laugh of a fiend,\" muttered Randal. \"Something that makes her\r\nnot worth bestowing. He betrays himself. Cunning people always do.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me,\" said the Italian at last, \"if I don't answer your question;\r\nyou will know later; but, at present, this is a family secret. And now I\r\nmust turn to another and more alarming cause for my frankness to you.\"\r\nHere Riccabocca's face changed, and assumed an expression of mingled\r\nrage and fear. \"You must know,\" he added, sinking his voice, \"that\r\nGiacomo has seen a strange person loitering about the house, and looking\r\nup at the windows; and he has no doubt--nor have I--that this is some\r\nspy or emissary of Peschiera's.\"\r\n\r\n\"Impossible; how could he discover you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I know not; but no one else has any interest in doing so. The man kept\r\nat a distance, and Giacomo could not see his face.\"\r\n\r\n\"It may be but a mere idler. Is this all?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; the old woman who serves us said that she was asked at a shop 'if\r\nwe were not Italians?'\"\r\n\r\n\"And she answered?\"\r\n\r\n\"'No;' but owned that 'we had a foreign servant, Giacomo.'\"\r\n\r\n\"I will see to this. Rely on it that if Peschiera has discovered you, I\r\nwill learn it. Nay, I will hasten from you in order to commence\r\ninquiry.\"\r\n\r\n\"I cannot detain you. May I think that we have now an interest in\r\ncommon?\"\r\n\r\n\"O, indeed yes; but--but--your daughter! how can I dream that one so\r\nbeautiful, so peerless, will confirm the hope you have extended to me?\"\r\n\r\n\"The daughter of an Italian is brought up to consider that it is a\r\nfather's right to dispose of her hand.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the heart?\"\r\n\r\n\"_Cospetto!_\" said the Italian, true to his infamous notions as to the\r\nsex, \"the heart of a girl is like a convent--the holier the cloister,\r\nthe more charitable the door.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRandal had scarcely left the house, before Mrs. Riccabocca, who was\r\naffectionately anxious in all that concerned Violante, rejoined her\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\n\"I like the young man very well,\" said the sage--\"very well indeed. I\r\nfind him just what I expected from my general knowledge of human nature;\r\nfor as love ordinarily goes with youth, so modesty usually accompanies\r\ntalent. He is young, _ergo_ he is in love; he has talent, _ergo_ he is\r\nmodest--modest and ingenuous.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you think not in any way swayed by interest in his affections?\"\r\n\r\n\"Quite the contrary; and to prove him the more, I have not said a word\r\nas to the worldly advantages which, in any case, would accrue to him\r\nfrom an alliance with my daughter. In any case; for if I regain my\r\ncountry, her fortune is assured; and if not, I trust (said the poor\r\nexile, lifting his brow with stately and becoming pride) that I am too\r\nwell aware of my child's dignity as well as my own, to ask any one to\r\nmarry her to his own worldly injury.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eh! I don't quite understand you, Alphonso. To be sure, your dear life\r\nis insured for her marriage portion; but--\"\r\n\r\n\"_Pazzie_--stuff!\" said Riccabocca petulantly; \"her marriage portion\r\nwould be as nothing to a young man of Randal's birth and prospects. I\r\nthink not of that. But listen; I have never consented to profit by\r\nHarley L'Estrange's friendship for me; my scruples would not extend to\r\nmy son-in-law. This noble friend has not only high rank, but\r\nconsiderable influence--influence with the government--influence with\r\nRandal's patron--who, between ourselves, does not seem to push the young\r\nman as he might do; I judge by what Randal says. I should write,\r\ntherefore, before any thing was settled, to L'Estrange, and I should say\r\nto him simply, 'I never asked you to save me from penury, but I do ask\r\nyou to save a daughter of my house from humiliation. I can give to her\r\nno dowry; can her husband owe to my friend that advance in an honorable\r\ncareer--that opening to energy and talent--which is more than a dowry to\r\ngenerous ambition?'\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it is in vain you would disguise your rank,\" cried Jemima with\r\nenthusiasm, \"it speaks in all you utter, when your passions are moved.\"\r\n\r\nThe Italian did not seem flattered by this eulogy. \"Pish,\" said he,\r\n\"there you are! rank again!\"\r\n\r\nBut Jemima was right. There was something about her husband that was\r\ngrandiose and princely, whenever he escaped from his accursed Machiavel,\r\nand gave fair play to his heart.\r\n\r\nAnd he spent the next hour or so in thinking over all that he could do\r\nfor Randal, and devising for his intended son-in-law the agreeable\r\nsurprises, which Randal was at that very time racking his yet cleverer\r\nbrains to disappoint.\r\n\r\nThese plans conned sufficiently, Riccabocca shut up his Machiavel, and\r\nhunted out of his scanty collection of books Buffon on Man, and various\r\nother psychological volumes, in which he soon became deeply absorbed.\r\nWhy were these works the object of the sage's study? Perhaps he will let\r\nus know soon, for it is clearly a secret known to his wife; and though\r\nshe has hitherto kept one secret, that is precisely the reason why\r\nRiccabocca would not wish long to overburthen her discretion with\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nRandal reached home in time to dress for a late dinner at Baron Levy's.\r\n\r\nThe Baron's style of living was of that character especially affected\r\nboth by the most acknowledged exquisites of that day, and, it must be\r\nowned, also, by the most egregious _parvenus_. For it is noticeable that\r\nit is your _parvenu_ who always comes nearest in fashion (so far as\r\nexternals are concerned) to your genuine exquisite. It is your _parvenu_\r\nwho is most particular as to the cut of his coat, and the precision of\r\nhis equipage, and the minutiæ of his _ménage_. Those between the\r\n_parvenu_ and the exquisite, who know their own consequence, and have\r\nsomething solid to rest upon, are slow in following all the caprices of\r\nfashion, and obtuse in observation as to those niceties which neither\r\ngive them another ancestor, nor add another thousand to the account at\r\ntheir banker's;--as to the last, rather indeed the contrary! There was a\r\ndecided elegance about the Baron's house and his dinner. If he had been\r\none of the lawful kings of the dandies, you would have cried, \"What\r\nperfect taste!\"--but such is human nature, that the dandies who dined\r\nwith him said to each other, \"He pretend to imitate D----! vulgar dog!\"\r\nThere was little affectation of your more showy opulence. The furniture\r\nin the rooms was apparently simple, but, in truth, costly, from its\r\nluxurious comfort--the ornaments and china scattered about the commodes\r\nwere of curious rarity and great value; and the pictures on the walls\r\nwere gems. At dinner, no plate was admitted on the table. The Russian\r\nfashion, then uncommon, now more prevalent, was adopted--fruits and\r\nflowers in old Sevre dishes of priceless _vertu_, and in sparkling\r\nglass, of Bohemian fabric. No livery servant was permitted to wait;\r\nbehind each guest stood a gentleman dressed so like the guest himself,\r\nin fine linen and simple black, that guest and lacquey seemed\r\nstereotypes from one plate.\r\n\r\nThe viands were exquisite; the wine came from the cellars of deceased\r\narchbishops and ambassadors. The company was select; the party did not\r\nexceed eight. Four were the eldest sons of peers (from a baron to a\r\nduke); one was a professed wit, never to be got without a month's\r\nnotice, and, where a _parvenu_ was host, a certainty of green pease and\r\npeaches--out of season; the sixth, to Randal's astonishment, was Mr.\r\nRichard Avenel; himself and the Baron made up the complement.\r\n\r\nThe eldest sons recognized each other with a meaning smile; the most\r\njuvenile of them, indeed, (it was his first year in London,) had the\r\ngrace to blush and look sheepish. The others were more hardened; but\r\nthey all united in regarding with surprise both Randal and Dick Avenel.\r\nThe former was known most of them personally; and to all, by repute, as\r\na grave, clever, promising young man, rather prudent than lavish, and\r\nnever suspected to have got into a scrape. What the deuce did he do\r\nthere? Mr. Avenel puzzled them yet more. A middle-aged man, said to be\r\nin business, whom they had observed \"about town\" (for he had a\r\nnoticeable face and figure)--that is, seen riding in the park, or\r\nlounging in the pit at the opera, but never set eyes on at a recognized\r\nclub, or in the coteries of their 'set';--a man whose wife gave horrid\r\nthird-rate parties, that took up half a column in the _Morning Post_\r\nwith a list of \"The Company Present,\"--in which a sprinkling of dowagers\r\nout of fashion, and a foreign title or two, made the darkness of the\r\nobscurer names doubly dark. Why this man should be asked to meet\r\n_them_, by Baron Levy, too--a decided tuft-hunter and would-be\r\nexclusive--called all their faculties into exercise. The wit, who, being\r\nthe son of a small tradesman, but in the very best society, gave himself\r\nfar greater airs than the young lords, impertinently solved the mystery.\r\n\"Depend on it,\" whispered he to Spendquick--\"depend on it the man is the\r\nX. Y. of the _Times_, who offers to lend any sums of money from £10 to\r\nhalf-a-million. He's the man who has all your bills; Levy is only his\r\njackall.\"\r\n\r\n\"'Pon my soul,\" said Spendquick, rather alarmed, \"if that's the case,\r\none may as well be civil to him.\"\r\n\r\n\"_You_, certainly,\" said the wit. \"But I never yet found an X. Y. who\r\nwould advance me the L. s.; and, therefore, I shall not be more\r\nrespectful to X. Y. than to any other unknown quantity.\"\r\n\r\nBy degrees, as the wine circulated, the party grew gay and sociable.\r\nLevy was really an entertaining fellow; had all the gossip of the town\r\nat his fingers' ends; and possessed, moreover, that pleasant art of\r\nsaying ill-natured things of the absent, which those present always\r\nenjoy. By degrees, too, Mr. Richard Avenel came out; and as the whisper\r\nhad circulated round the table that he was X. Y., he was listened to\r\nwith a profound respect, which greatly elevated his spirits. Nay, when\r\nthe wit tried once to show him up or mystify him, Dick answered with a\r\nbluff spirit, that, though very coarse, was found so humorous by Lord\r\nSpendquick and other gentlemen similarly situated in the money-market,\r\nthat they turned the laugh against the wit, and silenced him for the\r\nrest of the night--a circumstance which made the party go off much more\r\npleasantly. After dinner, the conversation, quite that of single men,\r\neasy and _débonnair_, glanced from the turf, and the ballet, and the\r\nlast scandal, towards politics; for the times were such that politics\r\nwere discussed everywhere, and three of the young lords were county\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\nRandal said little, but, as was his wont, listened attentively; and he\r\nwas aghast to find how general was the belief that the government was\r\ndoomed. Out of regard to him, and with that delicacy of breeding which\r\nbelongs to a certain society, nothing personal to Egerton was said,\r\nexcept by Avenel, who, however, on blurting out some rude expressions\r\nrespecting that minister, was instantly checked by the Baron.\r\n\r\n\"Spare my friend, and Mr. Leslie's near connection,\" said he, with a\r\npolite but grave smile.\r\n\r\n\"Oh,\" said Avenel, \"public men, whom we pay, are public property--aren't\r\nthey, my lord?\" appealing to Spendquick.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said Spendquick, with great spirit--\"public property, or\r\nwhy should we pay them? There must be a very strong motive to induce us\r\nto do that! I hate paying people. In fact,\" he subjoined in an aside, \"I\r\nnever do!\"\r\n\r\n\"However,\" resumed Mr. Avenel, graciously, \"I don't want to hurt your\r\nfeelings, Mr. Leslie. As to the feelings of our host, the Baron, I\r\ncalculate that they have got tolerably tough by the exercise they have\r\ngone through.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless,\" said the Baron, joining in the laugh which any lively\r\nsaying by the supposed X. Y. was sure to excite--\"nevertheless, 'love\r\nme, love my dog,' love me, love my Egerton.\"\r\n\r\nRandal started, for his quick ear and subtle intelligence caught\r\nsomething sinister and hostile in the tone with which Levy uttered this\r\nequivocal comparison, and his eye darted towards the Baron. But the\r\nBaron had bent down his face, and was regaling himself upon an olive.\r\n\r\nBy and by the party rose from table. The four young noblemen had their\r\nengagements elsewhere, and proposed to separate without re-entering the\r\ndrawing-room. As, in Goethe's theory, monads which have affinities with\r\neach other are irresistibly drawn together, so these gay children of\r\npleasure had, by a common impulse, on rising from table, moved each to\r\neach, and formed a group round the fireplace. Randal stood a little\r\napart, musing; the wit examined the pictures through his eye-glass; and\r\nMr. Avenel drew the Baron towards the sideboard, and there held him in\r\nwhispered conference. This colloquy did not escape the young gentlemen\r\nround the fireplace: they glanced towards each other.\r\n\r\n\"Settling the percentage on renewal,\" said one, _sotto voce_.\r\n\r\n\"X. Y. does not seem such a very bad fellow,\" said another.\r\n\r\n\"He looks rich, and talks rich,\" said a third.\r\n\r\n\"A decided, independent way of expressing his sentiments; those moneyed\r\nmen generally have.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good heavens!\" ejaculated Spendquick, who had been keeping his eye\r\nanxiously fixed on the pair, \"do look; X. Y. is actually taking out his\r\npocket-book; he is coming this way. Depend on it, he has got our\r\nbills--mine is due to-morrow.\"\r\n\r\n\"And mine too,\" said another, edging off. \"Why, it is a perfect\r\n_guetapens_.\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, breaking away from the Baron, who appeared anxious to detain\r\nhim, and, failing in that attempt, turned aside, as if not to see Dick's\r\nmovements--a circumstance which did not escape the notice of the group,\r\nand confirmed all their suspicions, Mr. Avenel, with a serious,\r\nthoughtful air, and a slow step, approached the group. Nor did the great\r\nRoman general more nervously \"flutter the dove-cotes in Corioli,\" than\r\ndid the advance of the supposed X. Y. agitate the bosoms of Lord\r\nSpendquick and his sympathizing friends. Pocket-book in hand, and\r\napparently feeling for something formidable within its mystic recesses,\r\nstep by step came Dick Avenel towards the fireplace. The group stood\r\nstill, fascinated by horror.\r\n\r\n\"Hum,\" said Mr. Avenel, clearing his throat.\r\n\r\n\"I don't like that hum, at all,\" muttered Spendquick.\r\n\r\n\"Proud to have made your acquaintance, gentlemen,\" said Dick, bowing.\r\n\r\nThe gentlemen, thus addressed, bowed low in return.\r\n\r\n\"My friend the Baron thought this not exactly the time to\"--Dick stopped\r\na moment; you might have knocked down those four young gentlemen, though\r\nfour finer specimens of humanity no aristocracy in Europe could\r\nproduce--you might have knocked them down with a feather! \"But,\" renewed\r\nAvenel, not finishing his sentence, \"I have made it a rule in life never\r\nto lose securing a good opportunity; in short, to make the most of the\r\npresent moment. And,\" added he with a smile which froze the blood in\r\nLord Spendquick's veins, \"the rule has made me a very warm man!\r\nTherefore, gentlemen, allow me to present you each with one of\r\nthese\"--every hand retreated behind the back of its well-born\r\nowner--when, to the inexpressible relief of all, Dick concluded with--\"a\r\nlittle _soirée dansante_,\" and extended four cards of invitation.\r\n\r\n\"Most happy!\" exclaimed Spendquick. \"I don't dance in general; but to\r\noblige X---- I mean to have a better acquaintance, sir, with _you_--I\r\nwould dance on the tight-rope.\"\r\n\r\nThere was a good-humored, pleasant laugh at Lord Spendquick's\r\nenthusiasm, and a general shaking of hands and pocketing of the\r\ninvitation cards.\r\n\r\n\"You don't look like a dancing man,\" said Avenel, turning to the wit,\r\nwho was plump and somewhat gouty--as wits who dine out five days in the\r\nweek generally are; \"but we shall have supper at one o'clock.\"\r\n\r\nInfinitely offended and disgusted, the wit replied dryly, \"that every\r\nhour of his time was engaged for the rest of the season,\" and, with a\r\nstiff salutation to the Baron, took his departure. The rest, in good\r\nspirits, hurried away to their respective cabriolets, and Leslie was\r\nfollowing them into the hall, when the Baron, catching bold of him,\r\nsaid, \"Stay, I want to talk to you.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nThe Baron turned into his drawing-room, and Leslie followed.\r\n\r\n\"Pleasant young men, those,\" said Levy, with a slight sneer, as he threw\r\nhimself into an easy-chair and stirred the fire. \"And not at all proud;\r\nbut, to be sure, they are--under great obligations to me. Yes; they owe\r\nme a great deal. _Apropos_, I have had a long talk with Frank\r\nHazeldean--fine young man--remarkable capacities for business. I can\r\narrange his affairs for him. I find, on reference to the Will Office,\r\nthat you were quite right, the Casino property is entailed on Frank. He\r\nwill have the fee simple. He can dispose of the reversion entirely. So\r\nthat there will be no difficulty in our arrangements.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I told you also that Frank had scruples about borrowing on the\r\nevent of his father's death.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay--you did so. Filial affection! I never take that into account in\r\nmatters of business. Such little scruples, though they are highly\r\nhonorable to human nature, soon vanish before the prospect of the King's\r\nBench. And, too, as you so judiciously remarked, our clever young friend\r\nis in love with Madame di Negra.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he tell you that?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; but Madame di Negra did!\"\r\n\r\n\"I know most people in good society, who now and then require a friend\r\nin the management of their affairs. And having made sure of the fact you\r\nstated, as to Hazeldean's contingent property (excuse my prudence). I\r\nhave accommodated Madame di Negra, and bought up her debts.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have--you surprise me!\"\r\n\r\n\"The surprise will vanish on reflection. But you are very new to the\r\nworld yet, my dear Leslie. By the way, I have had an interview with\r\nPeschiera--\"\r\n\r\n\"About his sister's debts?\"\r\n\r\n\"Partly. A man of the nicest honor is Peschiera.\"\r\n\r\nAware of Levy's habit of praising people for the qualities in which,\r\naccording to the judgment of less penetrating mortals, they were most\r\ndeficient, Randal only smiled at this eulogy, and waited for Levy to\r\nresume. But the Baron sate silent and thoughtful for a minute or two,\r\nand then wholly changed the subject.\r\n\r\n\"I think your father has some property in ----shire, and you probably\r\ncan give me a little information as to certain estates of a Mr.\r\nThornhill--estates which, on examination of the title-deeds, I find\r\nonce, indeed, belonged to your family.\" The Baron glanced at a very\r\nelegant memorandum-book--\"The manors of Rood and Dulmonsberry, with\r\nsundry farms thereon. Mr. Thornhill wants to sell them as soon as his\r\nson is of age--an old client of mine, Thornhill. He has applied to me on\r\nthe matter. Do you think it an improvable property?\"\r\n\r\nRandal listened with a livid cheek and a throbbing heart. We have seen\r\nthat, if there was one ambitious scheme in his calculation which, though\r\nnot absolutely generous and heroic, still might win its way to a certain\r\nsympathy in the undebased human mind, it was the hope to restore the\r\nfallen fortunes of his ancient house, and repossess himself of the long\r\nalienated lands that surrounded the dismal wastes of the mouldering\r\nhall. And now to hear that those lands were getting into the inexorable\r\ngripe of Levy--tears of bitterness stood in his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"Thornhill,\" continued Levy, who watched the young man's\r\ncountenance--\"Thornhill tells me that that part of his property--the\r\nold Leslie lands--produces £2000 a-year, and that the rental could be\r\nraised. He would take £50,000 for it--£20,000 down, and suffer the\r\nremaining £30,000 to lie on mortgage at four per cent. It seems a very\r\ngood purchase. What do you say?\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't ask me,\" said Randal, stung into rare honesty; \"for I had hoped I\r\nmight live to repossess myself of that property.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! indeed. It would be a very great addition to your consequence in\r\nthe world--not from the mere size of the estate, but from its hereditary\r\nassociations. And if you have any idea of the purchase--believe me, I'll\r\nnot stand in your way.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can I have any idea of it?\"\r\n\r\n\"But I thought you said you had.\"\r\n\r\n\"I understood that these lands could not be sold till Mr. Thornhill's\r\nson came of age, and joined in getting rid of the entail.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, so Thornhill himself supposed, till, on examining the title-deeds,\r\nI found he was under a mistake. These lands are not comprised in the\r\nsettlement made by old Jasper Thornhill, which ties up the rest of the\r\nproperty. The title will be perfect. Thornhill wants to settle the\r\nmatter at once--losses on the turf, you understand; an immediate\r\npurchaser would get still better terms. A Sir John Spratt would give the\r\nmoney; but the addition of these lands would make the Spratt property of\r\nmore consequence in the county than the Thornhill. So my client would\r\nrather take a few thousands less from a man who don't set up to be his\r\nrival. Balance of power in counties as well as nations.\"\r\n\r\nRandal was silent.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Levy, with great kindness of manner, \"I see I pain you; and\r\nthough I am what my very pleasant guests will call a _parvenu_, I\r\ncomprehend your natural feelings as a gentleman of ancient birth.\r\n_Parvenu!_ Ah! is it not strange, Leslie, that no wealth, no fashion, no\r\nfame can wipe out that blot? They call me a _parvenu_, and borrow my\r\nmoney. They call our friend, the wit, a _parvenu_, and submit to all his\r\ninsolence--if they condescend to regard his birth at all--provided they\r\ncan but get him to dinner. They call the best debater in the Parliament\r\nof England a parvenu, and will entreat him, some day or other, to be\r\nprime minister, and ask him for stars and garters. A droll world, and no\r\nwonder the _parvenus_ want to upset it!\"\r\n\r\nRandal had hitherto supposed that this notorious tuft-hunter--this dandy\r\ncapitalist--this money-lender, whose whole fortune had been wrung from\r\nthe wants and follies of an aristocracy, was naturally a firm supporter\r\nof things as they are--how could things be better for men like Baron\r\nLevy? But the usurer's burst of democratic spleen did not surprise his\r\nprecocious and acute faculty of observation. He had before remarked,\r\nthat it is the persons who fawn most upon an aristocracy, and profit the\r\nmost by the fawning, who are ever at heart its bitterest disparagers.\r\nWhy is this? Because one full half of democratic opinion is made up of\r\nenvy; and we can only envy what is brought before our eyes, and what,\r\nwhile very near to us, is still unattainable. No man envies an\r\narchangel.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said Levy, throwing himself back in his chair, \"a new order of\r\nthings is commencing; we shall see. Leslie, it is lucky for you that you\r\ndid not enter Parliament under the government; it would be your\r\npolitical ruin for life.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think, then, that the ministry really cannot last?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, I do; and what is more, I think that a ministry of the same\r\nprinciples cannot be restored. You are a young man of talent and spirit;\r\nyour birth is nothing compared to the rank of the reigning party; it\r\nwould tell, to a certain degree, in a democratic one. I say, you should\r\nbe more civil to Avenel; he could return you to Parliament at the next\r\nelection.\"\r\n\r\n\"The next election! In six years! We have just had a general election.\"\r\n\r\n\"There will be another before this year, or half of it, or perhaps a\r\nquarter of it, is out.\"\r\n\r\n\"What makes you think so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Leslie, let there be confidence between us; we can help each other.\r\nShall we be friends?\"\r\n\r\n\"With all my heart. But, though you may help me, how can I help you?\"\r\n\r\n\"You have helped me already to Frank Hazeldean and the Casino estate.\r\nAll clever men can help me. Come, then, we are friends; and what I say\r\nis secret. You ask me why I think there will be a general election so\r\nsoon? I will answer you frankly. Of all the public men I ever met with,\r\nthere is no one who has so clear a vision of things immediately before\r\nhim as Audley Egerton.\"\r\n\r\n\"He has that character. Not _far_-seeing, but _clear_-sighted to a\r\ncertain limit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Exactly so. No one better, therefore, knows public opinion, and its\r\nimmediate ebb and flow.\"\r\n\r\n\"Granted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Egerton, then, counts on a general election within three months; and I\r\nhave lent him the money for it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lent him the money! Egerton borrow money of you--the rich Audley\r\nEgerton!\"\r\n\r\n\"Rich!\" repeated Levy in a tone impossible to describe, and accompanying\r\nthe word with that movement of the middle finger and thumb, commonly\r\ncalled a \"snap,\" which indicates profound contempt.\r\n\r\nHe said no more. Randal sat stupified. At length the latter muttered,\r\n\"But if Egerton is really not rich--if he lose office, and without the\r\nhope of return to it----\"\r\n\r\n\"If so, he is ruined!\" said Levy coldly; \"and, therefore, from regard to\r\nyou, and feeling interest in your future fate, I say--Rest no hopes of\r\nfortune or career upon Audley Egerton. Keep your place for the present,\r\nbut be prepared at the next election to stand upon popular principles.\r\nAvenel shall return you to parliament; and the rest is with luck and\r\nenergy. And now, I'll not detain you longer,\" said Levy, rising and\r\nringing the bell. The servant entered.\r\n\r\n\"Is my carriage here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Baron.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can I set you down any where?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, thank you; I prefer walking.\"\r\n\r\n\"Adieu, then. And mind you remember the _soirée dansante_ at Mrs.\r\nAvenel's.\" Randal mechanically shook the hand extended to him, and went\r\ndown the stairs.\r\n\r\nThe fresh frosty air roused his intellectual faculties, which Levy's\r\nominous words had almost paralyzed.\r\n\r\nAnd the first thing the clever schemer said to himself was this:--\r\n\r\n\"But what can be the man's motive in what he said to me?\"\r\n\r\nThe next was:--\r\n\r\n\"Egerton ruined? What am I, then?\"\r\n\r\nAnd the third was:--\r\n\r\n\"And that fair remnant of the old Leslie property! £20,000 down--how to\r\nget the sum? Why should Levy have spoken, to me of this?\"\r\n\r\nAnd lastly, the soliloquy rounded back:--\r\n\r\n\"The man's motives! His motives?\"\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the baron, threw himself into his chariot--the most\r\ncomfortable, easy chariot, you can possibly conceive--single man's\r\nchariot--perfect taste--no married man ever has such a chariot; and in a\r\nfew minutes he was at ----'s hotel, and in the presence of Giulio\r\nFranzini, Count di Peschiera.\r\n\r\n\"_Mon cher_,\" said the baron in very good French, and in a tone of the\r\nmost familiar equality with the descendant of the princes and heroes of\r\ngrand mediæval Italy--\"_Mon cher_, give me one of your excellent cigars.\r\nI think I have put all matters in train.\"\r\n\r\n\"You have found out--\"\r\n\r\n\"No; not so fast yet,\" said the baron, lighting the cigar extended to\r\nhim. \"But you said that you should be perfectly contented if it only\r\ncost you £20,000 to marry off your sister (to whom that sum is legally\r\ndue), and to marry yourself to the heiress.\"\r\n\r\n\"I did indeed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then I have no doubt I shall manage both objects for that sum, if\r\nRandal Leslie really knows where the young lady is, and can assist you.\r\nMost promising, able man is Randal Leslie, but innocent as a babe just\r\nborn.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha, ha! Innocent? _Que diable!_\"\r\n\r\n\"Innocent as this cigar, _mon cher_--strong, certainly, but smoked very\r\neasily. _Soyez tranquille!_\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nWho has not seen--who not admired, that noble picture by Daniel Maclise,\r\nwhich refreshes the immortal name of my ancestor Caxton! For myself,\r\nwhile with national pride I heard the admiring murmurs of the foreigners\r\nwho grouped around it (nothing, indeed, of which our nation may be more\r\nproud had they seen in the Crystal Palace)--heard, with no less a pride\r\nin the generous nature of fellow artists, the warm applause of living\r\nand deathless masters, sanctioning the enthusiasm of the popular\r\ncrowd;--what struck me more than the precision of drawing, for which the\r\nartist has been always renowned, and the just though gorgeous affluence\r\nof color which he has more recently acquired, was the profound depth of\r\nconception, out of which this great work had so elaborately arisen. That\r\nmonk, with his scowl towards the printer and his back on the Bible, over\r\nwhich _his form casts a shadow_--the whole transition between the\r\nmediæval Christianity of cell and cloister, and the modern Christianity\r\nthat rejoices in the daylight, is depicted there, in the shadow\r\nthat obscures the Book--in the scowl that is fixed upon the\r\nBook-diffuser;--that sombre musing face of Richard, Duke of Gloucester,\r\nwith the beauty of Napoleon, darkened to the expression of a Fiend,\r\nlooking far and anxiously into futurity, as if foreseeing there what\r\nantagonism was about to be created to the schemes of secret crime and\r\nunrelenting force;--the chivalrous head of the accomplished Rivers, seen\r\nbut in profile, under his helmet, as if the age when Chivalry must\r\ndefend its noble attributes, in steel, was already half passed away:\r\nand, not least grand of all, the rude thews and sinews of the artisan\r\nforced into service on the type, and the ray of intellect, fierce, and\r\nmenacing revolutions yet to be, struggling through his rugged features,\r\nand across his low knitted brow;--all this, which showed how deeply the\r\nidea of the discovery in its good and its evil its saving light and its\r\nperilous storms, had sunk into the artist's soul, charmed me as\r\neffecting the exact union between sentiment and execution, which is the\r\ntrue and rare consummation of the Ideal in Art. But observe, while in\r\nthese personages of the group are depicted the deeper and graver\r\nagencies implicated in the bright but terrible invention--observe how\r\nlittle the light epicures of the hour heed the scowl of the monk, or the\r\nrestless gesture of Richard, or the troubled gleam in the eyes of the\r\nartisan--King Edward, handsome _Poco curante_, delighted, in the\r\nsurprise of a child, with a new toy; and Clarence, with his curious yet\r\ncareless glance--all the while Caxton himself, calm, serene, untroubled,\r\nintent solely upon the manifestation of his discovery, and no doubt\r\nsupremely indifferent whether the first proofs of it shall be dedicated\r\nto a Rivers or an Edward, a Richard or a Henry, Plantagenet or\r\nTudor--'tis all the same to that comely, gentle-looking man. So is it\r\never with your Abstract Science!--not a jot cares its passionless logic\r\nfor the woe or weal of a generation or two. The stream, once emerged\r\nfrom its source, passes on into the Great Intellectual Sea, smiling over\r\nthe wretch that it drowns, or under the keel of this ship which it\r\nserves as a slave.\r\n\r\nNow, when about to commence the present chapter on the Varieties of\r\nLife, this masterpiece of thoughtful art forced itself on my\r\nrecollection, and illustrated what I designed to say. In the surface of\r\nevery age, it is often that which but amuses, for the moment, the\r\nordinary children of pleasant existence, the Edwards and the Clarences\r\n(be they kings and dukes, or simplest of simple subjects), which\r\nafterwards towers out as the great serious epoch of the time. When we\r\nlook back upon human records, how the eye settles upon Writers as the\r\nmain landmarks of the past! We talk of the age of Augustus, of\r\nElizabeth, of Louis XIV., of Anne, as the notable eras of the world.\r\nWhy? Because it is their writers who have made them so. Intervals\r\nbetween one age of authors and another lie unnoticed, as the flats and\r\ncommon lands of uncultured history. And yet, strange to say, when these\r\nauthors are living amongst us, they occupy a very small portion of our\r\nthoughts, and fill up but desultory interstices in the bitumen and tufo\r\nwherefrom we build up the Babylon of our lives! So it is, and perhaps so\r\nit should be, whether it pleases the conceit of penmen or not. Life is\r\nmeant to be active; and books, though they give the action to future\r\ngenerations, administer but to the holiday of the present.\r\n\r\nAnd so, with this long preface, I turn suddenly from the Randals and the\r\nEgertons, and the Levys, Avenels, and Peschieras--from the plots and\r\npassions of practical life, and drop the reader suddenly into one of\r\nthose obscure retreats wherein Thought weaves, from unnoticed moments, a\r\nnew link to the chain that unites the ages.\r\n\r\nWithin a small room, the single window of which opened on a fanciful and\r\nfairy-like garden, that has been before described, sat a young man\r\nalone. He had been writing: the ink was not dry on his manuscript, but\r\nhis thoughts had been suddenly interrupted from his work, and his eyes\r\nnow lifted from the letter which had occasioned that interruption,\r\nsparkled with delight. \"He will come,\" exclaimed the young man; \"come\r\nhere--to the home which I owe to him. I have not been unworthy of his\r\nfriendship. And she\"--his breast heaved, but the joy faded from his\r\nface. \"Oh strange, strange, that I feel sad at the thought to see her\r\nagain. See _her_--ah, no!--my own comforting Helen--my own Child-angel!\r\n_Her_ I can never see again! The grown woman--that is not my Helen. And\r\nyet--and yet (he resumed, after a pause), if ever she read the pages, in\r\nwhich thought flowed and trembled under her distant starry light--if\r\never she see how her image has rested with me, and feel that, while\r\nothers believe that I invent, I have but remembered--will she not, for a\r\nmoment, be my own Helen again! Again, in heart and in fancy, stand by my\r\nside on the desolate bridge--hand in hand--orphans both, as we stood in\r\nthe days so sorrowful, yet, as I recall them, so sweet--Helen in\r\nEngland, it is a dream!\"\r\n\r\nHe rose, half consciously, and went to the window. The fountain played\r\nmerrily before his eyes, and the birds in the aviary carolled loud to\r\nhis ear. \"And in this house,\" he murmured, \"I saw her last! And there,\r\nwhere the fountain now throws its stream on high--there her benefactor\r\nand mine told me that I was to lose _her_, and that I might win--fame.\r\nAlas!\"\r\n\r\nAt this time a woman, whose dress was somewhat above her mien and air,\r\nwhich, though not without a certain air of respectability, were very\r\nhomely, entered the room; and, seeing the young man standing thus\r\nthoughtful by the window, paused. She was used to his habits; and since\r\nhis success in life, had learned to respect them. So she did not disturb\r\nhis reverie, but began softly to arrange the room--dusting, with the\r\ncorner of her apron, the various articles of furniture, putting a stray\r\nchair or two in its right place, but not touching a single paper.\r\nVirtuous woman, and rare as virtuous!\r\n\r\nThe young man turned at last, with a deep, yet not altogether painful\r\nsigh--\r\n\r\n\"My dear mother, good day to you. Ah, you do well to make the room look\r\nits best. Happy news! I expect a visitor!\"\r\n\r\n\"Dear me, Leonard, will he want? lunch--or what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nay, I think not, mother. It is he to whom we owe all--'_Hoec otia\r\nfecit_.' Pardon my Latin; it is Lord L'Estrange.\"\r\n\r\nThe face of Mrs. Fairfield (the reader has long since divined the name)\r\nchanged instantly, and betrayed a nervous twitch of all the muscles,\r\nwhich gave her a family likeness to old Mrs. Avenel.\r\n\r\n\"Do not be alarmed, mother. He is the kindest--\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't talk so; I can't bear it!\" cried Mrs. Fairfield.\r\n\r\n\"No wonder you are affected by the recollection of all his benefits. But\r\nwhen once you have seen him, you will find yourself ever after at your\r\nease. And so, pray, smile and look as good as you are; for I am proud of\r\nyour open honest look when you are pleased, mother. And he must see your\r\nheart in your face as I do.\"\r\n\r\nWith this, Leonard put his arm round the widow's neck and kissed her.\r\nShe clung to him fondly for a moment, and he felt her tremble from head\r\nto foot. Then she broke from his embrace, and hurried out of the room.\r\nLeonard thought perhaps she had gone to improve her dress, or to carry\r\nher housewife energies to the decoration of the other rooms; for \"the\r\nhouse\" was Mrs. Fairfield's hobby and passion; and now that she worked\r\nno more, save for her amusement, it was her main occupation. The hours\r\nshe contrived to spend daily in bustling about those little rooms, and\r\nleaving every thing therein to all appearance precisely the same, were\r\namong the marvels in life which the genius of Leonard had never\r\ncomprehended. But she was always so delighted when Mr. Norreys or some\r\nrare visitor came, and said (Mr. Norreys never failed to do so,) \"How\r\nneatly all is kept here. What could Leonard do without you, Mrs.\r\nFairfield?\"\r\n\r\nAnd to Norrey's infinite amusement, Mrs. Fairfield always returned the\r\nsame answer. \"'Deed, sir, and thank you kindly, but 'tis my belief that\r\nthe drawin'-room would be awful dusty.\"\r\n\r\nOnce more left alone, Leonard's mind returned to the state of reverie,\r\nand his face assumed the expression that had now become to it habitual.\r\nThus seen, he was changed much since we last beheld him. His cheek was\r\nmore pale and thin, his lips more firmly compressed, his eye more fixed\r\nand abstract. You could detect, if I may borrow a touching French\r\nexpression, that \"sorrow had passed by there.\" But the melancholy on his\r\ncountenance was ineffably sweet and serene, and on his ample forehead\r\nthere was that power, so rarely seen in early youth--the power that has\r\nconquered, and betrays its conquests but in calm. The period of doubt,\r\nof struggle, of defiance, was gone for ever; genius and soul were\r\nreconciled to human life. It was a face most loveable; so gentle and\r\npeaceful in its character. No want of fire; on the contrary, the fire\r\nwas so clear and so steadfast, that it conveyed but the impression of\r\nlight. The candor of boyhood, the simplicity of the villager were still\r\nthere--refined by intelligence, but intelligence that seemed to have\r\ntraversed through knowledge--not with the footstep, but the\r\nwing--unsullied by the mire--tending towards the star--seeking through\r\nthe various grades of being but the lovelier forms of truth and\r\ngoodness; at home as should be the Art that consummates the Beautiful--\r\n\r\n    \"In den heitern Regionen\r\n    Wo die reinen Formen wohnen.\"[23]\r\n\r\nFrom this reverie Leonard did not seek to rouse himself, till the bell\r\nat the garden gate rang loud and shrill; and then starting up and\r\nhurrying into the hall, his hand was grasped in Harley's.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nA full and happy hour passed away in Harley's questions and Leonard's\r\nanswers; the dialogue that naturally ensued between the two, on the\r\nfirst interview after an absence of years so eventful to the younger\r\nman.\r\n\r\nThe history of Leonard during this interval was almost solely internal,\r\nthe struggle of intellect with its own difficulties, the wanderings of\r\nimagination through its own adventurous worlds.\r\n\r\nThe first aim of Norreys, in preparing the mind of his pupil for its\r\nvocation, had been to establish the equilibrium of its powers, to calm\r\ninto harmony the elements rudely shaken by the trials and passions of\r\nthe old hard outer life.\r\n\r\nThe theory of Norreys was briefly this: The education of a superior\r\nhuman being is but the development of ideas in one for the benefit of\r\nothers. To this end, attention should be directed--1st, To the value of\r\nthe ideas collected; 2dly, To their discipline; 3dly, To their\r\nexpression. For the first, acquirement is necessary; for the second,\r\ndiscipline; for the third, art. The first comprehends knowledge, purely\r\nintellectual, whether derived from observation, memory, reflection,\r\nbooks or men, Aristotle or Fleet Street. The second demands _training_,\r\nnot only intellectual, but moral; the purifying and exaltation of\r\nmotives; the formation of habits; in which method is but a part of a\r\ndivine and harmonious symmetry--a union of intellect and conscience.\r\nIdeas of value, stored by the first process; marshalled into force, and\r\nplaced under guidance, by the second; it is the result of the third, to\r\nplace them before the world in the most attractive or commanding form.\r\nThis may be done by actions no less than words; but the adaptation of\r\nmeans to end, the passage of ideas from the brain of one man into the\r\nlives and souls of all, no less in action than in books, requires study.\r\nAction has its art as well as literature. Here Norreys had but to deal\r\nwith the calling of the scholar, the formation of the writer, and so to\r\nguide the perceptions towards those varieties in the sublime and\r\nbeautiful, the just combination of which is at once CREATION. Man\r\nhimself is but a combination of elements. He who combines in nature,\r\ncreates in art.\r\n\r\nSuch, very succinctly and inadequately expressed, was the system upon\r\nwhich Norreys proceeded to regulate and perfect the great native powers\r\nof his pupil; and though the reader may perhaps say that no system laid\r\ndown by another can either form genius or dictate to its results, yet\r\nprobably nine-tenths at least of those in whom we recognize the\r\nluminaries of our race, have passed unconsciously to themselves (for\r\nself-education is rarely conscious of its phases), through each of these\r\nprocesses. And no one who pauses to reflect will deny, that according to\r\nthis theory, illustrated by a man of vast experience, profound\r\nknowledge, and exquisite taste, the struggles of genius would be\r\ninfinitely lessened; its vision cleared and strengthened, and the\r\ndistance between effort and success notably abridged.\r\n\r\nNorreys, however, was far too deep a reasoner to fall into the error of\r\nmodern teachers, who suppose that education can dispense with labor. No\r\nmind becomes muscular without rude and early exercise. Labor should be\r\nstrenuous, but in right directions. All that we can do for it is to\r\nsave the waste of time in blundering into needless toils.\r\n\r\nThe master had thus first employed his neophyte in arranging and\r\ncompiling materials for a great critical work in which Norreys himself\r\nwas engaged. In this stage of scholastic preparation, Leonard was\r\nnecessarily led to the acquisition of languages, for which he had great\r\naptitude--the foundations of a large and comprehensive erudition were\r\nsolidly constructed. He traced by the ploughshare the walls of the\r\ndestined city. Habits of accuracy and of generalization became formed\r\ninsensibly; and that precious faculty which seizes, amidst accumulated\r\nmaterials, those that serve the object for which they are\r\nexplored,--(that faculty which quadruples all force, by concentrating it\r\non one point)--once roused into action, gave purpose to every toil and\r\nquickness to each perception. But Norreys did not confine his pupil\r\nsolely to the mute world of a library; he introduced him to some of the\r\nfirst minds in arts, science, and letters--and active life. \"These,\"\r\nsaid he, \"are the living ideas of the present, out of which books for\r\nthe future will be written: study them; and here, as in the volumes of\r\nthe past, diligently amass and deliberately compile.\"\r\n\r\nBy degrees Norreys led on that young ardent mind from the selection of\r\nideas to their æsthetic analysis--from compilation to criticism; but\r\ncriticism severe, close, and logical--a reason for each word of praise\r\nor of blame. Led in this stage of his career to examine into the laws of\r\nbeauty, a new light broke upon his mind; from amidst the masses of\r\nmarble he had piled around him, rose the vision of the statue.\r\n\r\nAnd so, suddenly one day Norreys said to him, \"I need a compiler no\r\nlonger--maintain yourself, by your own creations.\" And Leonard wrote,\r\nand a work flowered up from the seed deep buried, and the soil well\r\ncleared to the rays of the sun and the healthful influence of expanded\r\nair.\r\n\r\nThat first work did not penetrate to a very wide circle of readers, not\r\nfrom any perceptible fault of its own--there is luck in these things;\r\nthe first anonymous work of an original genius is rarely at once\r\neminently successful. But the more experienced recognized the promise of\r\nthe book. Publishers who have an instinct in the discovery of available\r\ntalent, which often forestalls the appreciation of the public,\r\nvolunteered liberal offers. \"Be fully successful this time,\" said\r\nNorreys; \"think not of models nor of style. Strike at once at the common\r\nhuman heart--throw away the corks--swim out boldly. One word more--never\r\nwrite a page till you have walked from your room to Temple Bar, and,\r\nmingling with men, and reading the human face, learn why great poets\r\nhave mostly passed their lives in cities.\"\r\n\r\nThus Leonard wrote again, and woke one morning to find himself famous.\r\nSo far as the chances of all professions dependent on health will\r\npermit, present independence, and, with foresight and economy, the\r\nprospects of future confidence were secured.\r\n\r\n\"And, indeed,\" said Leonard, concluding a longer but a simpler narrative\r\nthan is here told--\"indeed, there is some chance that I may obtain at\r\nonce a sum that will leave me free for the rest of my life to select my\r\nown subjects and write without care for remuneration. This is what I\r\ncall the true (and, perhaps, alas! the rare) independence of him who\r\ndevotes himself to letters. Norreys, having seen my boyish plan for the\r\nimprovement of certain machinery in the steam-engine, insisted on my\r\ngiving much time to mechanics. The study that once pleased me so\r\ngreatly, now seemed dull; but I went into it with a good heart; and the\r\nresult is, that I have improved so far on my original idea, that my\r\nscheme has met the approbation of one of our most scientific engineers;\r\nand I am assured that the patent for it will be purchased of me upon\r\nterms which I am ashamed to name to you, so disproportioned do they seem\r\nto the value of so simple a discovery. Meanwhile, I am already rich\r\nenough to have realized the two dreams of my heart--to make a home in\r\nthe cottage where I had last seen you and Helen--I mean Miss Digby; and\r\nto invite to that home her who had sheltered my infancy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Your mother, where is she? Let me see her.\"\r\n\r\nLeonard ran out to call the widow, but to his surprise and vexation,\r\nlearned that she had quitted the house before L'Estrange arrived.\r\n\r\nHe came back perplexed how to explain what seemed ungracious and\r\nungrateful, and spoke with hesitating lip and flushed cheek of the\r\nwidow's natural timidity and sense of her own homely station. \"And so\r\noverpowered is she,\" added Leonard, \"by the recollection of all that we\r\nowe to you, that she never hears your name without agitation or tears,\r\nand trembled like a leaf at the thought of seeing you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ha!\" said Harley, with visible emotion, \"Is it so?\" and he bent down,\r\nshading his face with his hand. \"And,\" he renewed, after a pause, but\r\nnot looking up--\"and you ascribe this fear of seeing me, this agitation\r\nat my name, solely to an exaggerated sense of--of the circumstances\r\nattending my acquaintance with yourself?\"\r\n\r\n\"And, perhaps, to a sort of shame that the mother of one you have made\r\nher proud of is a peasant.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is all,\" said Harley, earnestly, now looking up and fixing eyes in\r\nwhich stood tears, upon Leonard's ingenuous brow.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, my dear lord, what else can it be? Do not judge her harshly.\"\r\n\r\nL'Estrange rose abruptly, pressed Leonard's hand, muttered something not\r\naudible, and then drawing his young friend's arm in his, led him into\r\nthe garden, and turned the conversation back to its former topics.\r\n\r\nLeonard's heart yearned to ask after Helen, and yet something withheld\r\nhim from doing so, till, seeing Harley did not volunteer to speak of\r\nher, he could not resist his impulse. \"And Helen--Miss Digby--is she\r\nmuch changed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Changed, no--yes; very much.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very much!\" Leonard sighed.\r\n\r\n\"I shall see her again?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly,\" said Harley, in a tone of surprise. \"How can you doubt it?\r\nAnd I reserve to you the pleasure of saying that you are renowned. You\r\nblush; well, I will say that for you. But you shall give her your\r\nbooks.\"\r\n\r\n\"She has not yet read them, then?--not the last? The first was not\r\nworthy of her attention,\" said Leonard, disappointed.\r\n\r\n\"She has only just arrived in England; and, though your books reached me\r\nin Germany, she was not then with me. When I have settled some business\r\nthat will take me from town, I shall present you to her and my mother.\"\r\nThere was a certain embarrassment in Harley's voice as he spoke; and,\r\nturning round abruptly, he exclaimed, \"But you have shown poetry even\r\nhere. I could not have conceived that so much beauty could be drawn from\r\nwhat appeared to me the most commonplace of all suburban gardens. Why,\r\nsurely where that charming fountain now plays stood the rude bench in\r\nwhich I read your verses.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is true; I wished to unite all together my happiest associations. I\r\nthink I told you, my lord, in one of my letters, that I had owed a very\r\nhappy, yet very struggling time in my boyhood to the singular kindness\r\nand generous instructions of a foreigner whom I served. This fountain is\r\ncopied from one that I made in his garden, and by the margin of which\r\nmany a summer day I have sat and dreamt of fame and knowledge.\"\r\n\r\n\"True, you told me of that; and your foreigner will be pleased to hear\r\nof your success, and no less so of your graceful recollections. By the\r\nway, you did not mention his name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Riccabocca.\"\r\n\r\n\"Riccabocca! My own dear and noble friend!--is it possible? One of my\r\nreasons for returning to England is connected with him. You shall go\r\ndown with me and see him. I meant to start this evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"My dear lord,\" said Leonard, \"I think that you may spare yourself so\r\nlong a journey. I have reason to suspect that Signor Riccabocca is my\r\nnearest neighbor. Two days ago I was in the garden, when suddenly\r\nlifting my eyes to yon hillock I perceived the form of a man seated\r\namongst the bushwood; and, though I could not see his features, there\r\nwas something in the very outline of his figure and his peculiar\r\nposition, that irresistibly reminded me of Riccabocca. I hastened out of\r\nthe garden and ascended the hill, but he was gone. My suspicions were so\r\nstrong that I caused inquiry to be made at the different shops scattered\r\nabout, and learned that a family, consisting of a gentleman, his wife,\r\nand daughter, had lately come to live in a house that you must have\r\npassed in your way hither, standing a little back from the road,\r\nsurrounded by high walls; and though they were said to be English, yet\r\nfrom the description given to me of the gentleman's person by one who\r\nhad noticed it, by the fact of a foreign servant in their employ, and by\r\nthe very name 'Richmouth,' assigned to the new comers, I can scarcely\r\ndoubt that it is the family you seek.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you have not called to ascertain?\"\r\n\r\n\"Pardon me, but the family so evidently shunning observation (no one but\r\nthe master himself ever seen without the walls), the adoption of another\r\nname, too--lead me to infer that Signor Riccabocca has some strong\r\nmotive for concealment; and now, with my improved knowledge of life, I\r\ncannot, recalling all the past, but suppose that Riccabocca was not what\r\nhe appeared. Hence, I have hesitated on formally obtruding myself upon\r\nhis secrets, whatever they may be, and have rather watched for some\r\nchance occasion to meet him in his walks.\"\r\n\r\n\"You did right, my dear Leonard; but my reasons for seeing my old friend\r\nforbid all scruples of delicacy, and I will go at once to his house.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will tell me, my lord, if I am right.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope to be allowed to do so. Pray, stay at home till I return. And\r\nnow, ere I go, one question more: You indulge conjectures as to\r\nRiccabocca, because he has changed his name--why have you dropped your\r\nown?\"\r\n\r\n\"I wished to have no name,\" said Leonard, coloring, deeply, \"but that\r\nwhich I could make myself.\"\r\n\r\n\"Proud poet, this I can comprehend. But from what reason did you assume\r\nthe strange and fantastic name of Oran?\"\r\n\r\nThe flush on Leonard's face became deeper.\r\n\r\n\"My lord,\" said he, in a low voice, \"it is a childish fancy of mine; it\r\nis an anagram.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\"\r\n\r\n\"At a time when my cravings after knowledge were likely much to mislead,\r\nand perhaps undo me, I chanced on some poems that suddenly affected my\r\nwhole mind, and led me up into purer air; and I was told that these\r\npoems were written in youth, by one who had beauty and genius--one who\r\nwas in her grave--a relation of my own, and her familiar name was\r\nNora--\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" again ejaculated Lord L'Estrange, and his arm pressed heavily upon\r\nLeonard's.\r\n\r\n\"So, somehow or other,\" continued the young author, falteringly, \"I\r\nwished that if ever I won to a poet's fame, it might be, to my own\r\nheart, at least, associated with this name of Nora--with her whom death\r\nhad robbed of the fame that she might otherwise have won--with her\r\nwho--\"\r\n\r\nHe paused, greatly agitated.\r\n\r\nHarley was no less so. But as if by a sudden impulse, the soldier bent\r\ndown his manly head, and kissed the poet's brow; then he hastened to the\r\ngate, flung himself on his horse, and rode away.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nLord L'Estrange did not proceed at once to Riccabocca's house. He was\r\nunder the influence of a remembrance too deep and too strong to yield\r\neasily to the lukewarm claim of friendship. He rode fast and far; and\r\nimpossible it would be to define the feelings that passed through a mind\r\nso acutely sensitive, and so rootedly tenacious of all affections. When\r\nhe once more, recalling his duty to the Italian, retraced his road to\r\nNorwood, the slow pace of his horse was significant of his own exhausted\r\nspirits; a deep dejection had succeeded to feverish excitement. \"Vain\r\ntask,\" he murmured, \"to wean myself from the dead! Yet I am now\r\nbetrothed to another; and she, with all her virtues, is not the one\r\nto--\" He stopped short in generous self-rebuke. \"Too late to think of\r\nthat! Now, all that should remain to me is to insure the happiness of\r\nthe life to which I have pledged my own. But--\" He sighed as he so\r\nmurmured. On reaching the vicinity of Riccabocca's house, he put up his\r\nhorse at a little inn, and proceeded on foot across the heath-land\r\ntowards the dull square building, which Leonard's description had\r\nsufficed to indicate as the exile's new home. It was long before any one\r\nanswered his summons at the gate. Not till he had thrice rung did he\r\nhear a heavy step on the gravel walk within; then the wicket within the\r\ngate was partially drawn aside, a dark eye gleamed out, and a voice in\r\nimperfect English asked who was there.\r\n\r\n\"Lord L'Estrange; and if I am right as to the person I seek, that name\r\nwill at once admit me.\"\r\n\r\nThe door flew open as did that of the mystic cavern at the sound of\r\n\"Open Sesame;\" and Giacomo, almost weeping with joyous emotion,\r\nexclaimed in Italian, \"The good Lord! Holy San Giacomo! thou hast heard\r\nme at last! We are safe now.\" And dropping the blunderbuss with which he\r\nhad taken the precaution to arm himself, he lifted Harley's hand to his\r\nlips, in the affectionate greeting familiar to his countrymen.\r\n\r\n\"And the Padrone?\" asked Harley, as he entered the jealous precincts.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, he is just gone out; but he will not be long. You will wait for\r\nhim?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly. What lady is that I see at the far end of the garden?\"\r\n\r\n\"Bless her, it is our Signorina. I will run and tell her that you are\r\ncome.\"\r\n\r\n\"That I am come; but she cannot know me even by name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Excellency, can you think so? Many and many a time has she talked\r\nto me of you, and I have heard her pray to the holy Madonna to bless\r\nyou, and in a voice so sweet--\"\r\n\r\n\"Stay, I will present myself to her. Go into the house, and we will wait\r\nwithout for the Padrone. Nay, I need the air, my friend.\" Harley, as he\r\nsaid this, broke from Giacomo, and approached Violante.\r\n\r\nThe poor child, in her solitary walk in the obscurer parts of the dull\r\ngarden, had escaped the eye of Giacomo when he had gone forth to answer\r\nthe bell; and she, unconscious of the fears of which she was the object,\r\nhad felt something of youthful curiosity at the summons at the gate, and\r\nthe sight of a stranger in close and friendly conference with the\r\nunsocial Giacomo.\r\n\r\nAs Harley now neared her with that singular grace of movement which\r\nbelonged to him, a thrill shot through her heart--she knew not why. She\r\ndid not recognize his likeness to the sketch taken by her father, from\r\nhis recollections of Harley's early youth. She did not guess who he was;\r\nand yet she felt herself color, and, naturally fearless though she was,\r\nturned away with a vague alarm.\r\n\r\n\"Pardon my want of ceremony, Signorina,\" said Harley, in Italian; \"but I\r\nam so old a friend of your father's that I cannot feel as a stranger to\r\nyourself.\"\r\n\r\nThen Violante lifted to him her dark eyes, so intelligent and so\r\ninnocent--eyes full of surprise, but not displeased surprise. And Harley\r\nhimself stood amazed, and almost abashed, by the rich and marvellous\r\nbeauty that beamed upon him. \"My father's friend,\" she said\r\nhesitatingly, \"and I never to have seen you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Signorina,\" said Harley (and something of his native humor, half\r\narch, half sad, played round his lip,) \"you are mistaken there; you have\r\nseen me before, and you received me much more kindly then--\"\r\n\r\n\"Signor!\" said Violante, more and more surprised, and with a yet richer\r\ncolor on her cheeks.\r\n\r\nHarley, who had now recovered from the first effect of her beauty, and\r\nwho regarded her as men of his years and character are apt to regard\r\nladies in their teens, as more child than woman, suffered himself to be\r\namused by her perplexity; for it was in his nature, that the graver and\r\nmore mournful he felt at heart, the more he sought to give play and whim\r\nto his spirits.\r\n\r\n\"Indeed Signorina,\" said he demurely, \"you insisted then on placing one\r\nof those fair hands in mine; the other (forgive me the fidelity of my\r\nrecollections) was affectionately thrown around my neck.\"\r\n\r\n\"Signor!\" again exclaimed Violante; but this time there was anger in her\r\nvoice as well as surprise, and nothing could be more charming than her\r\nlook of pride and resentment.\r\n\r\nHarley smiled again, but with so much kindly sweetness, that the anger\r\nvanished at once, or rather Violante felt angry with herself that she\r\nwas no longer angry with him. But she had looked so beautiful in her\r\nanger, that Harley wished, perhaps, to see her angry again. So,\r\ncomposing his lips from their propitiatory smile he resumed, gravely--\r\n\r\n\"Your flatterers will tell you, Signorina, that you are much improved\r\nsince then, but I liked you better as you were; not but what I hope to\r\nreturn some day what you then so generously pressed upon me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pressed upon you!--I? Signor, you are under some strange mistake.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alas! no; but the female heart is so capricious and fickle! You pressed\r\nit upon me, I assure you. I own that I was not loth to accept it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pressed it? Pressed what?\"\r\n\r\n\"Your kiss, my child,\" said Harley; and then added with a serious\r\ntenderness, \"And I again say that I hope to return it some day--when I\r\nsee you, by the side of father and of husband, in your native land--the\r\nfairest bride on whom the skies of Italy ever smiled! And now, pardon a\r\nhermit and a soldier for his rude jests, and give your hand, in token of\r\nthat pardon, to--Harley L'Estrange.\"\r\n\r\nViolante, who at the first words of this address had recoiled, with a\r\nvague belief that the stranger was out of his mind, sprang forward as it\r\nclosed, and in all the vivid enthusiasm of her nature, pressed the hand\r\nheld out to her, with both her own. \"Harley L'Estrange--the preserver of\r\nmy father's life!\" she cried, and her eyes were fixed on his with such\r\nevident gratitude and reverence, that Harley felt at once confused and\r\ndelighted. She did not think at that instant of the hero of her\r\ndreams--she thought but of him who had saved her father. But, as his\r\neyes sank before her own, and his head, uncovered, bowed over the hand\r\nhe held, she recognized the likeness to the features on which she had so\r\noften gazed. The first bloom of youth was gone, but enough of youth\r\nstill remained to soften the lapse of years, and to leave to manhood the\r\nattractions which charm the eye. Instinctively she withdrew her hands\r\nfrom his clasp, and, in her turn looked down.\r\n\r\nIn this pause of embarrassment to both, Riccabocca let himself into the\r\ngarden by his own latch-key, and, startled to see a man by the side of\r\nViolante, sprang forward with an abrupt and angry cry. Harley heard and\r\nturned.\r\n\r\nAs if restored to courage and self-possession by the sense of her\r\nfather's presence, Violante again took the hand of the visitor.\r\n\"Father,\" she said simply, \"it is he--_he_ is come at last.\" And then,\r\nretiring a few steps, she contemplated them both; and her face was\r\nradiant with happiness--as if something, long silently missed and looked\r\nfor, was as silently found, and life had no more a want, nor the heart a\r\nvoid.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[20] Continued from page 253.\r\n\r\n[21] As there have been so many revolutions in France, it may be\r\nconvenient to suggest that, according to the dates of this story,\r\nHarley, no doubt, alludes to that revolution which exiled Charles X. and\r\nplaced Louis Philippe on the throne.\r\n\r\n[22] Have you fifty friends?--it is not enough. Have you one enemy?--it\r\nis too much.\r\n\r\n[23]    At home--\"In the serene regions\r\n        Where dwell the pure forms.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WHITE LAMB.\r\n\r\nA STORY FOR THE YOUNG FOLKS.\r\n\r\nBY R. H. STODDARD.\r\n\r\n\r\nOnce in a far country, for which you might search all the geographies of\r\nthe world in vain, there lived a poor woman who had a little daughter\r\nnamed Agnes. That she was poor, and had a child, was by no means\r\nwonderful; for poor people are common in all parts of the earth; and so\r\nfor the matter of that, are children too; for which the good God cannot\r\nbe enough thanked.\r\n\r\nBut this poor woman and child were not altogether like the thousands who\r\nsurrounded them, as I shall show you in the course of my little story.\r\nFor the mother was exceeding goodly, and the child was exceeding fair;\r\nand goodly too, so far as a child could be. Not that children cannot be\r\nas good, aye, and better than most grown people; but in that country\r\nthey were very bad and ignorant.\r\n\r\nIt is true that there were schools and academies there, and great\r\ncolleges time-honored and world-renowned; but somehow or other the\r\npeople were no better, but on the contrary rather worse for all these\r\nblessings. Whether they neglected good, or good neglected them, is not\r\nfor us to inquire now; but certain it is that the greater part of them\r\ngrew up in ignorance and vice. Now they need not have grown up in vice\r\nunless they had preferred it to virtue; though they could hardly have\r\nescaped a life of ignorance. There were many priests there to teach them\r\nthe folly of sin in this world, and its eternal punishment in the next.\r\nThey were very energetic in picturing the misery of sinners; but in\r\nspite of all they could say, and do, they preached to thin and careless\r\ncongregations: in consequence of which many of their salaries were\r\nunpaid from one year's end to another.\r\n\r\nMost of the men spent their Sabbaths in bull-baiting and dog-fighting;\r\nmost of the women in gadding from house to house with budgets of\r\nscandal; while the children ran off to the woods to snare birds and\r\ngather berries, and oftentimes to fight out a match made up the day\r\nbefore. Black eyes were by no means uncommon, with plenty more in\r\nperspective when those were healed.\r\n\r\nThis was the life of the mass of people, though I am happy to say there\r\nwere many exceptions, in men, women, and children, who went to the\r\nchapel, as all good Christians should; and lived up to the precepts of\r\nthe Good Book, as all good Christians do; among whom was the mother and\r\nchild that I began to tell you about.\r\n\r\nAnd not only did the good woman go to church on the Sabbath, and on all\r\nthe appointed holidays and feasts, but she endeavored to make her life a\r\nperpetual sabbath unto the Lord. But the child, because she was of a\r\ntender age, could not always accompany her, nor understand why she must\r\nalways clasp her hands, and kneel down in the pew, when the vicar did\r\nthe same in his little pulpit. But she was a good child for all that, as\r\nthe story will show, and loved her mother with an exceeding love.\r\n\r\nWhen she was about three years of age, her mother died. Her death,\r\nhowever, was by no means unexpected. The only wonder was that she had\r\nlived so long, she was so thin and sickly. Her husband had been dead a\r\nlittle over a year. He left her nothing but his child and poverty; a\r\ncommon legacy among the poorer sort of people in that country. After his\r\ndeath she toiled late and early to maintain herself and babe. Many a\r\ndawn she rose before the sun, and the sun rose there very early. Many a\r\nnight she saw the moon set, and it sets very late at certain seasons of\r\nthe year; but her labors were never done. The labors of the poor never\r\nare until death comes. When death came to her, she rested from her work,\r\nand her work followed her.\r\n\r\nIt was a fine day in spring when they buried her. The fresh green earth\r\nwas full of dew, the soft blue sky without a cloud. It was a day to make\r\none certain of immortality. Few and unconcerned were those who bore her\r\nto the grave; they would rather have gone to a merry-making; mere\r\nneighbors and nothing more: the dead woman left no friends, or\r\nrelatives; only her child.\r\n\r\nWhen they reached the churchyard, they found the old sexton beside the\r\ngrave, leaning on his spade, ready to fill it again at the shortest\r\nnotice. The vicar put on his bands, and read the funeral service. \"Dust\r\nto dust, ashes to ashes, but the spirit to God who gave it.\" The coffin\r\nwas lowered into its narrow house and the earth thrown upon it, while\r\nthe minister of Christ exhorted the people around.\r\n\r\nLittle Agnes being left to herself by those who had charge of her,\r\nstrayed down the winding paths, and was soon hidden among the\r\ngrave-stones, which were very thick; for the dead of ages were buried in\r\nthat little churchyard. At first she wondered why she had been brought\r\nthere; but the sky was so blue above her, and the earth so beautiful\r\naround, that she soon forgot it. The shadow of Death, which falls\r\nheavily on the hearts of men, passes like a light mist over the soul of\r\na child.\r\n\r\nLarge butterflies with crimson and golden wings were flying to and fro\r\nin the air, and the wild bee pursued its honey-making in the buttercups.\r\nShe sat down in the long grass, and began to weave the blue violets, as\r\nshe had seen the basket-maker weave his rushes. Not a month before, a\r\nlittle girl of her own age was laid with many tears in the mound at her\r\nfeet; but the dew hung there as brightly as in the deep meadows, and the\r\nsunshine filled the place, like the smile of God. Nature mourns not like\r\nman for the dead whom she has gathered to her bosom in peace.\r\n\r\nBy and by little Agnes began to grow drowsy, and in spite of all she\r\ncould do to keep awake, she found her eyes closing and her head nodding\r\non her breast; so she repeated the prayer that her good mother had\r\ntaught her to say before going to bed, and committed herself to the care\r\nof her Heavenly Father, and in a moment was fast asleep, and walking in\r\na dream with the Angels.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time the good vicar, having finished his exhortation, and\r\nthe people having departed, began to wonder at her absence, and searched\r\nfor her down the path which he remembered to have seen her take. Looking\r\nright and left among the grave-stones, and calling \"Agnes,\" with a\r\nsweet, low voice, he came to the spot where she had fallen asleep. She\r\nwas sleeping still, and beside her stood a little lamb, innocent and\r\nbeautiful. Its fleece was whiter than the driven snow, and glistened in\r\nthe sunlight like gold. There was a golden collar around its neck, with\r\nan inscription in an unknown tongue; and its eyes were exceeding tender\r\nand beautiful. There were no folds in that country, and how it could\r\nhave come there was a mystery which the vicar could not explain; nor\r\ncould the child when she awoke. She only remembered to have seen it in\r\nher dream, following a Shepherd in the pastures of Paradise.\r\n\r\nAs the vicar stood lost in amazement, it drew near him, and looked up in\r\nhis face with its tender and beautiful eyes, and then at the child, and\r\nthen in his face again, as much as to say--Here is a poor motherless\r\none; she has no friends in the wide world; who will take care of her, if\r\nyou do not? Indeed, he fancied that it did say so; and that a voice\r\nsofter than silence whispered to him, \"Feed my Lambs.\" His heart was\r\ntouched with pity, and he lifted her up in his arms and bore her to the\r\nvicarage.\r\n\r\nIt was not long before the news spread through the neighboring towns,\r\nand many of their dwellers came to see the White Lamb and the young\r\nchild, who grew daily more beautiful and good. The pious seemed to grow\r\nbetter the moment they beheld the loving pair; and the wicked, who had\r\nsat for years under the droppings of the sanctuary, or mocked at the\r\ngoodness of Heaven afar off, grew thoughtful and penitent, and were soon\r\nnumbered among the people of God.\r\n\r\nThe lamb and child were seldom separated. Little Agnes was very unhappy\r\nwhen parted from it, and it seemed equally unhappy in its turn when\r\nparted from her. Sometimes they used to sit for hours together; she\r\nporing over the vicar's antique missal, which by this time she had\r\nlearned to read, and the lamb at her feet, looking up in her face with\r\nits tender and beautiful eyes. Sometimes in the warm summer days they\r\nwent off together to the woods and lanes; sometimes, to the meadows\r\nwhere the daises grew in tufted grass; and little Agnes was wont to\r\nbraid them in a wreath around her brow. She said one day on returning\r\nthat she would soon wear a wreath of stars. As regularly as the Sabbath\r\ncame, they went to the chapel together, side by side. The sexton made a\r\npath for them, as they walked up the broad aisle which was now crowded\r\nwith earnest and devout listeners. Their accustomed place was on the\r\ncushioned seat that ran around the altar. When the choir sang their\r\nanthems, the voice of the child was heard above the deep bass singers,\r\nand the full-toned organ; yet it was softer and sweeter than the voice\r\nof a dove. When the vicar read the morning and evening service, her\r\nresponses fell on the hearts of all like dew; and a halo seemed to\r\nencircle her as she listened to the words of life.\r\n\r\nThe people began to consider it a miracle. Cock-fighting and\r\nbull-baiting fell into disrepute; drinking and gaming, to which the\r\ngreater part of them had been bred from childhood, lost _caste_ as\r\namusements, and other vices declined in proportion. It was evident that\r\na great change was going on in the hearts and habits of all. Profane\r\noaths and light jests, which even the gentry condescended to indulge in\r\n(as they did in other things better left to their inferiors), were\r\nbanished from all society, even that of travelling tinkers, time out of\r\nmind a coarse set of fellows. Feuds handed down from father to son were\r\ndropped at once, and old enemies met with kind greetings, and parted\r\nfriends. Every body seemed to prosper, and nobody was the worse for it.\r\nBeggars began to lay aside their tatters, and wear good substantial\r\ngarments. There was no longer any need to beg, for work was plentiful.\r\nCottage windows, once stuffed with old hats, rejoiced in the possession\r\nof new panes of glass; and new cottages were being builded every where,\r\nand every body declared it was the work of the White Lamb.\r\n\r\nSpring melted into summer, and summer was now on the verge of autumn.\r\nThe fields were full of harvesters, reaping and binding up yellow\r\nsheaves, and barns were open all day, and boys might be seen within,\r\nstoring up fruit for the winter. Every day added some new grace to the\r\nchild; but those who were experienced in such matters, mostly mothers\r\nwho had lost children, said she was dying. Her bloom was too unearthly,\r\nher eye too spiritual to last. She was no longer able to run to the\r\nwoods and fields: a walk to the little summer house at the end of the\r\nvicar's garden, only a stone's throw from the door, was sufficient to\r\nmake her very weary. Nor could she visit the chapel unless carried\r\nthither, which was a source of great grief to all the villagers.\r\n\r\nDay by day she grew more lovely and feeble; and the lamb grew more fond\r\nof her: they could not for a moment separate them. It clung to her days\r\nas she sat in her little chair leaning on pillows; and nights it crept\r\nto her feet as she lay upon her couch dreaming of the angels. Its white\r\nfleece seemed to grow more white, and its eyes more tender and\r\nbeautiful. And it often looked at the fading child, and at the far blue\r\nsky, shining through the lattice, and its glance seemed to say--Heaven\r\nis waiting for this little slip of earth, and it must soon go.\r\n\r\nAutumn came at last, and the child was dying. It was morning, and she\r\nlay on her couch, with half the village around her. Her eyes were fixed\r\nupon the sky, and her arms were entwined about the lamb, who lay with\r\nits head in her bosom. The vicar knelt down, and prayed. He could not\r\nbear to lose the light of his household, though he knew that the angels\r\nwere waiting for her on the threshold of heaven. When he arose she\r\nslept. Ages have passed since then, and she still sleeps; and will sleep\r\ntill the heavens and the earth shall have passed away. The next day was\r\nthe Sabbath, and they bore her to the little churchyard where her mother\r\nwas buried. Their graves were dug side by side. All the children and\r\nmaidens, dressed in white, followed her bier; and half the mothers in\r\nthe village wept as if she had been their own child; and the Lamb,\r\nlooking whiter than ever, walked in their midst. But when the services\r\nwere over and the coffin lowered into the grave, it looked once at the\r\nfar blue sky, and then turned away, and walked down the path which\r\nlittle Agnes had taken at her mother's funeral. No one dared to stop it;\r\nbut all watched it with breathless attention until it disappeared among\r\nthe grave-stones. Some of the boldest, and the vicar among the rest,\r\nfollowed to where it seemed to disappear, but could find no further\r\ntraces. Nobody was ever able to account for it, but every body believed\r\nit to have been a miracle, manifested for their salvation,\r\nnotwithstanding a wise philosopher who wrote a large folio to prove that\r\nit never existed at all. Its memory is still preserved with veneration\r\nin that country, and from that day to this, the people have continued\r\ngodly and pious.\r\n\r\n--And so ends the story of the White Lamb.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nM. Romieu, an ultramontane writer, quoted with much parade by the\r\n_Tablet_, says of France:--\"The most exact picture of our epoch is drawn\r\nin the phrase, 'that not a woman is brought to bed in France who does\r\nnot give birth to a Socialist.'\" On this the _Nation_ remarks:--\"In what\r\na dissolute condition _la jeune France_, with all its bibs and tuckers,\r\nmust certainly be! Only imagine Madame de Montalembert brought to bed of\r\ntwin Phalansteriens! The lady of M. Jules Gondou, _redacteur de\r\nl'Univers_, of a horrid little Fourierist! The nursery of M. de Falloux\r\nin red pinafores, squalling out _Soc.-de-moc._ canticles! Never before\r\nsuch danger in swaddling clothes!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAuthors and Books.\r\n\r\n\r\nA curious work, which will not be devoid of interest to the historian or\r\n_belles-lettres_ antiquary, has recently been published at Leipzig,\r\nunder the title of _Die Alexandersage bei den Orientalern_ (or the\r\nLegend of Alexander as it exists in the East), by Dr. FREDERICK SPIEGEL.\r\nWith the exception of King Arthur, no personage plays a more extended\r\nrôle in the romantic European legends of the middle ages, than\r\nAlexander; but our readers may not be generally aware that the feats of\r\nthis great conqueror are still perpetuated under a thousand strange\r\nforms even on the remote East, generally under the name of Iskander. \"No\r\nhistoric material has ever been more widely extended than this history\r\nof Alexander, and there are even yet races in the interior of Central\r\nAsia who declare themselves directly descended from him;\"--precisely, no\r\ndoubt, as certain very respectable families extant at the present day in\r\nHungary and Italy prove themselves lineal descendants of Julius Cæsar,\r\nÆneas, and even Noah. \"In the earliest times, even in the very scene of\r\nhis exploits, Alexander became a hero of legend-like and\r\nexaggerated histories, a collection of which, bearing the name of\r\n_Pseudo-Callisthenes_, as editor, is yet preserved; and from this came\r\nthe innumerable Alexanderine romances of the middle ages, which at\r\nlength totally obscured the true accounts of the conqueror. In the East,\r\nalso, and particularly in Persia, he has been made the subject of many\r\ngreat epic poems. The relation existing between all these legends, which\r\nhave sprung up at such different times, and under such extremely varied\r\ncircumstances, is an interesting problem for the literary historian, and\r\nthe book we have mentioned is valuable, since in it every thing relating\r\nto the Persian portion thereof, is given in full.\" From the index, an\r\nadmirable analysis of its contents, and a somewhat extended abridgment,\r\nwhich we have perused, we may assert that few works more curiously\r\ninteresting have for a long time been published.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf great interest to antiquaries and positive utility to artists, is the\r\n_Trachten des Christlichen Mittelalters_ (or Dresses of the Christian\r\nMiddle Age), by J. VON HOFNER. As they are all taken from _contemporary_\r\nworks of art, they may be relied on for correctness. The part last\r\npublished consists of the second division, embracing guises of the\r\nfourteenth and fifteenth centuries. Among others, the reader may find\r\nArmour of the sixteenth century, the Dress of a lady of rank in the\r\nmiddle of the same century, a French dress of the fifteenth century, and\r\na tournament helmet of the same period. Such books serve better than any\r\nreading to impress on the minds of the young correct ideas of past\r\nmanners and times.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe observe a German version of _The Popular Nomenclature of American\r\nPlants_, under the title of _Die Volksnamen der Amerikan. Pflanzen_, by\r\nBERTHOLD SEEMANN, published at Hanover, by Rümpler. Of this book a\r\nGerman reviewer remarks, that \"the knowledge of the popular local names\r\nin systematic botany has hitherto been neglected in such an\r\nunaccountable manner, that the appearance of the above-cited work has\r\nawakened a joyful surprise among all who are capable of appreciating its\r\nvalue. This well-deserving traveller, whose name at present is in every\r\nmouth, has in a great measure by his own exertions, and partly from the\r\nworks and indications of Aublet, Bridges, Cruickshanks, De Candolle,\r\nGardner, Gilles, Hooker, Humboldt and Bonpland, Lindley, la Llave and\r\nLergarga, Martius, Miers, Pursch, Ruaz and Pavon, Torrey and Gray,\r\nCervantes and Bustamente, carefully and scientifically collected above\r\ntwo thousand of the names with which the different races of the American\r\nContinent designate the most important of their plants. Moreover, he has\r\nfully succeeded in conforming these names, almost without exception, to\r\nthe systematic scientific terminology by which they are known, or at\r\nleast has given their family. With this work a path has been opened\r\nwhich will prove servicable not only to the botanist but also to the\r\nphilologist, and which we trust will in future be trodden frequently by\r\nthe author and other travellers.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf the interesting historical compositions lately published, we may cite\r\nby FR. GERLACH _Die Geschichte der Römer_ (or History of the Romans),\r\nand _Die Geschichtschreiber der Deutschen Vorzeit_ (or The Historians of\r\nthe early German Times), the fifth volume of which has just appeared,\r\ncontaining the Chronicle of Herimann, according to the edition of the\r\n_Monumenta Germaniæ_. We have also, with a colossal title which we in\r\npart omit, three volumes of the _Fontes Rerum Austriacarum_ (or Austrian\r\nSources of History), published by the historical commission of the Royal\r\nAcademy of Sciences in Vienna. This is spoken of as a really wonderful\r\ncollection of curious documents. The sources of Austrian history have\r\nbeen at all times sadly neglected, and this work may in a great measure\r\nsupply the deficiency. In the same department we have also the second\r\nvolume of MIGNET'S _History of Mary Stuart_, from an English version of\r\nwhich we have already quoted somewhat largely in this magazine.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo the historian and geographer COUNT KARL FREDERIC VON HUGEL'S account\r\nof _Karbul-Becken and the Mountains between the Hindu Kosch and the\r\nSutlej_, will be found fresh and interesting.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe third continuation of the third year of the _Historisches\r\nTaschenbuch_ (or Historical Pocket-book), of FREDERICK VON RAUMER\r\npublished by Brochkaus of Leipzig, has just made its appearance. The\r\nmost interesting article which it contains is entitled, \"The Sikhs and\r\ntheir Kingdom,\" by Karl Friederich Neumann. \"Such an account by so\r\nwell-informed a writer,\" says a German review, \"is of no little\r\ninterest.\" As every eminent European scholar, who has distinguished\r\nhimself by manifesting an interest in American affairs, deserves to be\r\nparticularly known in this country, we translate for the _International_\r\na short account of Professor Neumann, which we partially extract from a\r\nMS. sketch written by himself in the summer of 1847. Carl Friederich\r\nNeumann, Professor of Oriental Languages and History at the University\r\nof Munich, and one of the most learned sinologists of modern times, was\r\nresident in China during the years 1829 and 1830. In Canton, he became\r\npossessor of a large library of Chinese books, from which he has since\r\ndrawn the materials for works distinguished by their originality,\r\nerudition, and untiring industry. Previous to this visit to China, and\r\nto better qualify himself for it, he had, after finishing his studies at\r\nthe Universities of Heidelberg and Göttingen, remained for a long time\r\nat Venice, Paris, and London, occupied exclusively in the studies of\r\nOriental languages and history. After his return from China, he was\r\nappointed in 1838 Professor of the Chinese and Armenian tongues at the\r\nUniversity of Munich. Professor Neumann has ever been remarkably\r\nunprejudiced with regard to America, and we were first induced to seek\r\nhis acquaintance on hearing his frequent praises of our country, while\r\nattending these lectures. He is the author of a number of works in the\r\nLatin, French, German, and English languages, all of which he writes\r\nwith facility. He also ranks high as a mathematician and student of\r\nnatural philosophy. His most curious work is contained in a small\r\npamphlet, entitled _The Chinese in California and Mexico in the Fifth\r\nCentury_, proving from ancient Chinese chronicles, whose accounts are\r\nsubstantiated by our subsequent knowledge of natural phenomena therein\r\ndescribed, that those countries were, in the fifth century, visited by\r\nBuddhist priests at the time mentioned.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA late number of the _Europa_ contains a notice of the _London Art\r\nJournal_. We have not time to read the article, but suggest that the\r\nleast which a Leipzig reviewer _should_ say of this periodical, is, that\r\nit contains infinitely more news relative to the present condition of\r\nart in Germany, than the _Kunst Blatt_, or Munich _Art Journal_ itself.\r\nThere is hardly any magazine of which we make more use in the\r\n_International_, than the London _Art Journal_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne of the most practical handbooks of a higher order for the use of the\r\nlearned, in _Roman Antiquities_, is that by W. BEEKER, ex-Professor at\r\nLeipzig--the third part of which has just made its appearance. The parts\r\nalready published contain the first part of the State Government of\r\nancient Italy; the Provinces ('of which we have here for the first time\r\na complete statistical account'); and the State Constitution. The\r\npublisher promises that in the coming volumes there will be given the\r\ndepartments of Finance and War, Jurisprudence, Religion and Private\r\nAntiquities. In connection with this we may cite the _Legis Rubriæ pars\r\nsuperstes_, a beautifully lithographed _fac-simile_ of this classic\r\ncuriosity, and also by Dr. ADAM ZINZOW _De Pelasgicis Romanorum Sacris_,\r\nwhich is a treatise on those oldest of the Roman local legends which the\r\nauthor considers as Pelasgic.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIn our forgetfulness of such \"opium reading\" we are oft apt to imagine\r\nthe days of mysticism and the supernaturalism gone by. Germany, however,\r\noccasionally reminds us that the world is ever prone to return to the\r\nspectre-haunted paths trodden by its forefathers. One of the latest\r\n_recallers_ of this description, is a second and very considerably\r\nenlarged edition of Dr. JOSEPH ENNEMOSER'S _Historio-Physiological\r\nInquiries into the Origin and Existence of the Human Soul_. Of a\r\nsomewhat similar school, we have the second volume of the collected\r\nworks of FRANZ VON BAADER, and separate from these, by Dr. FRANZ\r\nHOFFMANN, _Franz Baader in his relations to Spinoza, Leibnitz, Kant,\r\nJacobi, Fichte, Schelling, Hegel and Herbart_. Six groschens worth of\r\nstout and vivid abuse of the atheist FEUERBACH has also been published\r\nby Bläsing of Erlangen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have already called attention to the tenth edition of BROCKHAUS'S\r\n_Conversations-Lexikon_, now publishing serially at Leipzig. The\r\ntwenty-first part is before us, and we again take occasion to commend\r\nthe work to our readers. We know no other encyclopædia which compares\r\nwith it in universal excellence and utility, and this edition is a great\r\nimprovement upon its predecessors. In the biography of living personages\r\nof distinction it is especially rich; in this respect alone it deserves\r\nto be found in the libraries even of those who own the earlier editions.\r\nThe biographies of American statesmen and scholars are given with detail\r\nand correctness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA work which may be of some interest to the belles-lettres antiquarian,\r\nhas just been published by Schmidt, of Halle: _The Sources of Popular\r\nSongs in German Literature_. Such a performance is more necessary for\r\nthe songs of Germany than for those of any other nation, since no where\r\nelse is there so much which really requires explanation to the moderns.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA most agreeable book is _Schiller and his Paternal House_, lately\r\npublished at Stuttgart, by Herr SAUPE. The great poet is here depicted\r\nin the midst of his father's family, all of whom loved him dearly, and\r\nrespected as much as they loved.\r\n\r\nA Hamburg journal says a good and sharp word about the mania of the\r\nGermans for hunting up the literary remains of Goethe and Schiller. The\r\nvolumes of memoirs, correspondence, diaries, and other relics of these\r\ngreat men, would make a library far exceeding in quantity all the\r\nvolumes they published themselves. Nothing so much proves the absence of\r\ngreat and significant persons in the literature of the present day as\r\nthis almost convulsive clinging to the immortal deceased, and the\r\nendless endeavor to talk and write about them, and publish every thing\r\nthat can be twisted into a connection with their history or writings.\r\nPresently we shall hear of the republication of the school-books they\r\nstudied, with all the thumb-marks and pot-hooks then scribbled by the\r\nfuture great men. This is said on occasion of DÖRING'S _Schiller and\r\nGoethe_, which the writer thinks might as well have been unwritten.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe number of books on military subjects published in Germany, must\r\nastonish the American not accustomed to see at every corner a\r\n_gendarme_, or behold his bayonet protruding occasionally from behind\r\nthe scene-paintings of a theatre, where he is posted to preserve order.\r\nIn two numbers of a weekly review, we find notices of no less than\r\nfourteen books on strictly military matters. For readers who take an\r\ninterest in such subjects, we translate the titles of few: _The Battles\r\nof Frederic the Great; The Armies of the Present Day and their Future\r\nDestiny; Military Fireworks in the Royal Prussian Army; The Organization\r\nand Formation of the Bavarian Army and the Military Budget;_ and _A\r\nShort Abridgment of Naval Artillery_. With these works we may also cite\r\nDe GUSTAV SIMON'S new essay On _Gunshot Wounds_, which is said to\r\ncontain valuable contributions to this branch of surgery.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe thirtieth volume of _The Library of Collected German Literature_,\r\ncontains _Der Wälsche Gast_ (or the Italian Guest), by THOMASIN VON\r\nZIRELARIA: an old German poem of the Middle Ages, now published the\r\nfirst time, with philologic and historical remarks by Dr. HEINRICH\r\nRUCKERT; and by K. A.

Mr. Montalembert, who is universally known as an ultra\r\nCatholic, holds that the noblest era in history was that part of the\r\nmiddle ages, when the Catholic faith was at the climax of its influence\r\nand splendor. What distinguishes modern times is paganism, and the\r\nessence of paganism is modern education and science. Classical education\r\nis especially a bad thing. One great hope of this age lies in the\r\nreëstablishment of the jesuits and the religious education they will\r\nconfer.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSeveral eminent scholars are in the list of candidates for the Greek\r\nProfessorship of Edinburgh, but the struggle is considered to be between\r\nDr. William Smith, whose classical dictionaries have gained him a high\r\nreputation, Mr. Price, for many years a successful teacher at Rugby,\r\nProfessor M'Dowell, of Queen's College, Belfast, and Professor Blackie,\r\nof Aberdeen.

His _My Novel, or Varieties of English Life_, is\r\nnearly finished, and he will give to the world a new three volume novel\r\nin the course of the spring. He is also bringing out, with final\r\nrevisions, notes, &c., all his prose writings, in a neat and cheap\r\nedition. In the new preface to _Alice, or the Mysteries_, he says: \"So\r\nfar as an author may presume to judge of his own writings, no narrative\r\nfiction by the same hand (with the exception of the poem of _King\r\nArthur_) deserves to be classed before this work in such merit as may be\r\nthought to belong to harmony between a premeditated conception, and the\r\nvarious incidents and agencies employed in the development of plot.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLADY BULWER LYTTON has written two extraordinary letters to the _Morning\r\nPost_, of a review in that paper, of her _School for Husbands_, hinting\r\nat what _might_ have been said about some of the minor faults, had the\r\nbook been written by any body else, and going out of her way, to remind\r\nus that her husband is a plagiarist. Repeating one of Mr. Joseph\r\nMiller's anecdotes of a larceny of brooms, ready made, she says. \"And so\r\nit is with the great _Bombastes_ of the Press--Sir E. Bulwer Lytton.\r\nTruly, therefore, may he exclaim:--\r\n\r\n    \"----Non ulla laborum:\r\n    O Virgo nova ni facies inopinaque surgit,\r\n    Omnia percipi atque animo mecum ante peregi.\"\r\n\r\nAnd well may a _sapient, moral_, and _impartial_ press uphold so great\r\nan empiric.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLORD COCKBURN, one of the Scottish judges, is preparing a _Memoir of\r\nLord Jeffrey_, with selections from his correspondence. \"The ability,\r\njudgment, and taste of Henry Cockburn, as well as political sympathy and\r\npersonal friendship,\" the _Athenæum_ says, \"give him every fitness for\r\nbeing the biographer of Francis Jeffrey.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe last number of the London _Quarterly Review_ presents a new\r\ncandidate for the honor of the authorship of JUNIUS, in the person of\r\nthe second Lord LYTTLETON--best known in his lifetime for profligacy,\r\nand since, for the curious circumstances attending his death, which are\r\nwell related in Sir Walter Scott's _Demonology and Witchcraft_. The\r\nreviewer proves Lord Lyttleton capable of writing the letters; that he\r\nhad motives to write them; that his conduct on other occasions is\r\nconsistent with Junius's anxiety to preserve his incognito; and that\r\nthere are curious coincidences between his character and conduct, and\r\nmany characteristic passages in the letters. This directs research to a\r\nnew quarter; but though a good _prima facie_ case of suspicion is made\r\nout, that is all. Positive evidence is wanted. A writer in the London\r\n_Athenæum_, who long ago demolished the claims of Sir Philip Francis to\r\nbe considered Junius (Lord Mahon's judgment to the contrary\r\nnotwithstanding), and who has since pretty satisfactorily disposed of\r\nthe dozen or more other prominent claimants, has, we think, conclusively\r\nanswered the _Quarterly's_ claim in behalf of Lord Lyttleton. We should\r\nlike to know who the critic of the _Athenæum_ supposes to be the Great\r\nUnknown. In one of the volumes of the _Grenville Papers_, just published\r\nin London, the author says:\r\n\r\n     \"With respect to the letters addressed to Mr. Grenville by the\r\n     author of 'Junius,' which will be printed in the concluding\r\n     volumes of this correspondence, it will be sufficient to say\r\n     for the present, that there is not a particle of truth in all\r\n     the absurd tales that have been invented, as to their\r\n     preservation or discovery. In the proper place I shall have an\r\n     opportunity of explaining that there was no mystery attaching\r\n     to them, beyond the anonymous nature of the author's\r\n     communication.\"\r\n\r\nThis is rather unfavorable, as far as it goes, to the hypothesis of\r\nLyttelton's having been the author. It throws us back upon Sir David\r\nBrewster's claim in behalf of Mr. Maclean. Upon that theory, probably,\r\nthe archives of London House could throw some light. It may be\r\nmentioned, with reference to this subject that the _Grenville Papers_ go\r\nfar to substantiate Lord Shelburne's title to the designation of\r\n_Malagrida_.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe find in the _Athenæum_ an account of a curious case, having\r\nconsiderable interest for the lovers of old Italian literature, which\r\nhas just been decided by the Sacred Council in Rome.\r\n\r\n     \"About seventeen years ago the Count Alberti, then a\r\n     sub-lieutenant in the Roman army, announced to the world, that\r\n     he had in his possession, many of the unpublished papers of\r\n     TORQUATO TASSO, written with the poet's own hand; and also a\r\n     large collection of documents, throwing new light on certain\r\n     passages of his career,--particularly on those, which up to\r\n     that time, had been considered the most mysterious and\r\n     disputable--his first connection with Alphonse d'Este, the\r\n     proud Duke of Ferrara, and the real causes of his imprisonment\r\n     and liberation. Of course, the world was somewhat skeptical as\r\n     to the truth of this announcement; and Alberti either could not\r\n     or would not satisfy the doubts of the unbelieving by a plain\r\n     statement of how, when, and by what means these precious papers\r\n     came into his possession. Four years later, however, Candido\r\n     Mazzaroni, a bookseller of Ancona, purchased a portion of them\r\n     for publication,--and they were given to the world under the\r\n     title of _Interesting Documents on the Entrance of Torquato\r\n     Tasso into the service of Alphonse d'Este, Duke of Ferrara, and\r\n     on the Presents he received at that memorable Period_. In the\r\n     following year--that is, in 1839--Count Alberti sold the\r\n     remainder of his manuscripts to Signor Giusta, a bookseller of\r\n     Lucca, who published them under the title of _The real Causes\r\n     of the Imprisonment and Liberation of Torquato Tasso proved by\r\n     History and authentic Documents_. Now came the unpleasant part\r\n     of the affair to the noble owner of the mysterious manuscripts.\r\n     No sooner was this second book announced in the papers, than\r\n     Signor Mazzaroni brought an action against the count for having\r\n     sold him forged documents and autographs. On this charge\r\n     Alberti was arrested, and in due time a commission was named by\r\n     the tribunal to examine the documents in question. In\r\n     consequence of the slowness which characterizes all judicial\r\n     proceedings beyond the Alps, it was not until September, 1844,\r\n     that this commission gave its opinion, declaring the said\r\n     documents to be forgeries. Alberti was accordingly condemned to\r\n     seven years' imprisonment. He appealed against the sentence,\r\n     and demanded that the whole case might be re-examined from the\r\n     beginning. Thereupon, a second commission was named, with\r\n     larger powers; and before this body the count laid the proofs\r\n     of authenticity which he possessed. He proved to their\r\n     satisfaction that the manuscripts in question had been left by\r\n     the Abbé Maranetonio to Prince Ottavio Falconieri, from whose\r\n     library they had come to him. The Court admitted his evidence,\r\n     quashed the former sentence, and ordered the prisoner to be set\r\n     at liberty. The cream, however, of the affair is, that the\r\n     second Commission took nearly seven years to arrive at this\r\n     conclusion,--so that the Count's imprisonment had about expired\r\n     by efflux of time when the Sacra Consulta declared it to be\r\n     unmerited.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMR.

We understand, from those who have been favored\r\nwith a sight of the manuscript, that the _Howwadji in Syria_ will be\r\nsomewhat graver in its tone than its predecessor, as befits a book which\r\nrecords the impressions of Palestine and the Arabian desert, but, that\r\nit will breathe the same Oriental atmosphere, and abound in the same\r\ngraceful humor and flowing imagination which lent so great a charm to\r\nthat work. No traveller so truly reproduces the soul and sentiment of\r\nthese ancient and mysterious countries of the Orient as Mr. Curtis, and\r\nthis makes him as much preferable, for our reading, to the collectors of\r\ndry statistics and the jotters down of petty daily adventures, as the\r\nartist who paints a lovely person in the full glow of beauty is to a\r\ntedious gossip who describes the color of her gloves or the material of\r\nher bonnet.

That Mr. STODDARD is the\r\nvery Laureate of Titania, to sing her summer revels, the rare delicacy\r\nof perception and graceful music of the volume of poems published by him\r\nin the autumn, is the certificate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRev. H. N. HUDSON continues his admirable edition of Shakspeare. Early\r\ndrawn to the study of the poet, and pursuing that study against every\r\ndisadvantage, until he had embodied, in a series of lectures, his views\r\nof Shakspeare and impressions of his plays, we well remember the\r\nexcitement which greeted his public reading of them in Boston, before\r\nthe literary aristocracy of the Athens of Massachusetts. A shimmering\r\nbrilliancy played along his analysis, rather of fancy than of\r\nimagination,--almost rather of conceit than thought; but they approved\r\nhim a most competent critic, and this edition shows his admirable\r\neditorial qualities.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _History of Classical Literature_, by R. W. BROWNE, which has lately\r\nbeen much praised by London critics, has been republished by Blanchard &\r\nLea, of Philadelphia. The volume commences with Homer and closes with\r\nAristotle; and the plan pursued is to give a biography of each author,\r\nan account of the period in which he flourished, and then a criticism on\r\nthe character of his works. All the chapters are written with a careful\r\nremembrance that the general, and not the strictly scholarly, reader, is\r\nbeing addressed; and hence a comprehensive historical air most desirable\r\nin a book assuming to be a history rather than an analysis of a\r\nliterature. The _Iliad_ is examined as a poem, but also as affording\r\nevidences of the manners, customs, and civilization of the east at the\r\ntime at which the poem was composed. The philosophers are enumerated;\r\nbut their philosophy is examined more with reference to its indications\r\nas to society than for its bearings on the schools. Demosthenes is dealt\r\nwith as the orator than as the politician. The story of Socrates is\r\ntold, not for the individual, but for the universal model. In every\r\nrespect, the work is ably executed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA survey of the literature of the Southern States is in preparation by\r\nJOHN R. THOMPSON, editor of the _Southern Literary Messenger_. It will\r\nmake an ample volume in octavo, comprising biographical and critical\r\nnotices of the chief writers of that part of the Union, with liberal\r\nextracts from their characteristic productions. Mr. Thompson is a fine\r\nscholar, and has taste, and a thorough acquaintance with the\r\nintellectual resources of the South, and his work will be interesting\r\nand valuable, in many ways, though we suspect that it will fail of the\r\naccomplished editor's intent to show a general unfairness toward\r\nsouthern writing by northern cities. We have nothing to offer here as to\r\nthe causes, but we hold it to be a maintainable fact that the south has\r\nnot contributed her part to the intellectual riches of the country. We\r\nmay, perhaps, discuss the subject fully on the appearance of Mr.\r\nThompson's volume, with which, we are sure, the south will have abundant\r\nreason to be satisfied.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHistorical Review of the Month.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmerican diplomacy is pushing on into the Orient. A treaty has been\r\nnegotiated with Persia, by Mr. Marsh, our ambassador at Constantinople,\r\nwhich guarantees to our commerce all the advantages enjoyed by the most\r\nfavored nations. The overtures for this treaty came from the Shah\r\nhimself, through his envoy at Constantinople, and were promptly met by\r\nMr. Marsh, acting under the instructions of Secretary Clayton. It now\r\nremains to be seen whether our trade with the Persian kingdom will grow\r\nto much under the favorable influence of the new compact. Up to the\r\npresent day Persia does not figure very largely in the annual returns of\r\nthe treasury department.\r\n\r\nThe idea of renewing the search for Sir John Franklin, by American\r\nvessels, has been set on foot again by a letter of Commodore WILKES, who\r\nadvises the dispatching of ships to Wellington Channel, and explorations\r\nfrom there by sledges, especially in a westerly direction. Mr. HENRY\r\nGRINNELL has also addressed a memorial to Congress, supported by the\r\npetition of a large number of citizens of New-York, asking that the\r\nGovernment will again fit out and man his two vessels, the Advance and\r\nRescue, which he offers for the purpose, and send them out, accompanied\r\nby a store ship and a propeller. The Maryland Institute, and a large\r\nnumber of the citizens of Baltimore, have also addressed a similar\r\npetition to Congress. It is certain that, what with the efforts of our\r\nown countrymen and those of the British government, the subject will not\r\nbe abandoned till something positive has been ascertained with regard to\r\nthe fate of Franklin and his companions.\r\n\r\nCongress has continued in session, but has accomplished little or no\r\nuseful legislation within the month. The time has been mainly occupied\r\nwith debates on foreign intervention, on giving the job of printing the\r\ncensus to the publishers of the _Union_ newspaper, and on the abolition\r\nof the law giving the delegate from Oregon only $2500 mileage. The\r\ncensus printing question occasioned a rencontre between Senator Borland,\r\nof Arkansas, and Mr. Kennedy, the Superintendent of the Census, in which\r\nSenator Borland got into a passion and knocked Mr. Kennedy down,\r\nbreaking his nose, at the same time that he vehemently expressed a\r\ndesire, to the bystanders who interfered to prevent further violence, to\r\nget at Mr. Kennedy in order that he might \"cut the d----d rascal's\r\nthroat.\" Mr. Stanly, of North Carolina, and Mr. Giddings, of Ohio, have\r\nhad a passage of personalities in the House, which has been quite\r\nuniversally condemned by the press and public.\r\n\r\nKossuth has continued his career of triumph in the west, and besides the\r\novations of the people, has received a large amount of the material aid,\r\nwhich he especially seeks. Wherever he goes, he receives contributions\r\nof money and offerings of arms. A good deal of attention has been\r\nexcited by a letter from Mr. Bartholomew Szemere, one of Kossuth's\r\nformer friends, and even a minister in the Hungarian revolutionary\r\ncabinet, charging him with cowardice, weakness, and a fatally irresolute\r\nand vacillating policy in the administration of affairs. Szemere also\r\ndenies that Kossuth has any just right to call himself the Governor of\r\nHungary, or even the leader of the Hungarian people. On the other hand,\r\nMr. Vukovitch, who was also a minister in the same cabinet, who is now\r\nin Paris, has published a letter on Kossuth's side. To Szemere's letter\r\nMr. Pulszky has replied from Cincinnati, repelling the charge of\r\ncowardice against Kossuth, and showing that Szemere himself had fled\r\nfrom Hungary some months before the termination of the war, and when\r\nthere was still reason to hope that it might be brought to a favorable\r\nissue; and Count Bethlen, another of Kossuth's suite, also states that\r\nSzemere is a man of exceeding vanity, an intriguer against every body\r\nthat is above him, and that no man is more unpopular in Hungary than he.\r\nTherefore, it is argued, his opinion is valueless, and he is utterly in\r\nthe wrong when he says that Kossuth is no longer beloved and accepted by\r\nthe Hungarians as their chosen leader.\r\n\r\nThe revolutionary disturbances in Northern Mexico have been renewed, the\r\ngovernment having unwisely returned to the old tariff of import duties,\r\nwhich was the pretext for the first outbreak. Accordingly, Caravajal has\r\ngot his men together again and has resumed operations, of course with\r\nconsiderable assistance from the Texan side of the line. Mexico is\r\ngenerally in great trouble, not only from insurrections in this and\r\nother parts of the republic, but from the fact that the entire political\r\norganization is in a state of decay approaching dissolution. The revenue\r\nis insufficient for the ordinary wants of the government, which is\r\nunable to pay its civil officers or the army with the exception of the\r\ntroops in the field, to whom something has had to be paid, though not\r\nall they have been entitled to. The deficit for the last year, exceeds a\r\nmillion of dollars, exclusive of the interest on the debt. Congress met\r\non the first of January, when President Arista addressed the two Houses\r\nin a speech, exposing the dangers of their situation, and calling on\r\nthem to come up to the sublime task of saving the country from the\r\ndestruction which menaces it.\r\n\r\nFrom South America we have the details of the progress of the revolution\r\nwhich begun in Chili in the last autumn, and is not yet finished. It\r\ncommenced with a revolt of the provinces of Coquimbo and Concepcion,\r\nagainst Gen. Montt, the President, elected by a large majority in the\r\nother ten provinces of the republic. The election took place in June\r\nlast, and the insurrection broke out on the 6th and 8th of September,\r\nunder the leading of Gen. Cruz. The government forces were commanded by\r\nGen. Bulnes, the retiring President, who put his antagonists to route in\r\na battle at Longomilla. The contest was a most furious and bloody one;\r\nthe armies on the two sides were nearly equal, eight thousand men being\r\nengaged in all. Two thousand, or one quarter of the whole, were left\r\ndead upon the field. After his defeat, Cruz signed an agreement\r\nrecognizing Montt as the legitimate President, and promising to disband\r\nall his forces, and make no farther attempt to disturb the peace of the\r\ncountry, on condition that his offence and that of his associates should\r\nbe pardoned. It was thought that this event would insure the\r\ntranquillity of the country for many years; and Bulnes was received at\r\nValparaiso with great rejoicing on his return from the campaign. But\r\nthe agreement of the insurgents was not kept. On the 30th of December\r\nthey rose again, and got possession of the city of Copiapo, and prepared\r\nfrom there to resume their march against the capital. Should Bulnes\r\nagain defeat them, as is probable, he will be sure to show them no\r\nmercy.\r\n\r\nFrom the Rio de la Plata we have intelligence which seems to leave no\r\ndoubt that Rosas, the tyrant of Buenos Ayres, is on the verge of\r\ndestruction. Urquiza, the general who has just freed the republic of\r\nUruguay from the presence of Rosas's satraps, and restored to the\r\nimportant city of Montevideo the enjoyment of its liberty and the\r\nadvantages belonging to its commercial position, has now completed his\r\npreparations, and is about to march against the dictator himself.\r\nBesides the troops of Entre Rios, his own State, he has under his\r\ncommand the forces of Corrientes, and is aided by the Brazilian fleet\r\nand army, and some 2,000 men from Uruguay. The entire force about to\r\nmove against Rosas cannot be less than 30,000 troops, including some of\r\nthe best soldiers in South America, and a full complement of artillery.\r\nRosas, on his part, by extraordinary efforts, has got together some\r\n20,000 men, many of whom are raw recruits, and none of whom retain that\r\nfaith in the invincibility of their leader which has been an important\r\nelement in his previous successes. The supple legislature of Buenos\r\nAyres has, in these circumstances, outdone itself, and has not only made\r\nhim absolute and irresponsible dictator during the war, but for three\r\nyears after the victory. That victory, however, we opine he will never\r\nsee. As Urquiza approaches, the army of the dictator will diminish.\r\nLarge bodies of his soldiers will go over to the enemy; and he will\r\neither be shot or allowed to escape to England, to live there upon the\r\nrevenues of his enormous and ill-got fortune.\r\n\r\nIn England all the world has been agog for the approaching opening of\r\nParliament, which was to take place on the 3d of February. The highest\r\nexpectations of entertainment were cherished from the set-to then\r\nexpected to take place between Lord John Russell and Lord Palmerston,\r\nthe dismissed Foreign Secretary. It will be piquant to see these former\r\nallies converted into antagonists, and cutting and slashing at each\r\nother with all the greater effect from the intimate knowledge of each as\r\nto the concerns of the other. As a ready and efficient public debater\r\nLord Palmerston is the superior of the two.\r\n\r\nAll possibility of trouble between the United States and England on\r\naccount of the brig Express firing into the steamer Prometheus at San\r\nJuan de Niacaragua, has been prevented by a manly apology made by the\r\nnew British Minister for Foreign Affairs, Lord Granville. The act is as\r\ncreditable to his lordship, as it is grateful to all who would not have\r\nthe friendly relations between the two countries disturbed.\r\n\r\nIt is authoritatively stated that the new reform bill, which will be\r\nbrought forward shortly after the opening of Parliament, will not so\r\nmuch extend the suffrage as vary the present apportionment of\r\nrepresentatives. The boroughs, which are notoriously small, are to be\r\nenlarged by copious annexations, but there will be no new boroughs, nor\r\nwill the large towns, such as Manchester and Liverpool, get any more\r\nrepresentatives than they have now. If this be the nature of the bill,\r\nit cannot give satisfaction to either the Radicals or the Tories, nor\r\nextricate the Cabinet from its present difficulties. The cabinet has\r\nbeen further weakened by the resignation of Lord de Broughton--better\r\nknown as Sir John Cam Hobhouse--as President of the Board of Control for\r\nthe affairs of India, and of Lord Normanby as Minister at Paris. It is\r\nsurmised that Lord Normanby retires to take his chance for coming into\r\npower again as a member of a new cabinet, with his friend, Lord\r\nPalmerston, at its head--not an improbable thing, by the way. He is\r\nsucceeded at Paris by Lord Cowley. The troubles at the Cape of Good Hope\r\nstill continue, with no advantage gained on the British side. The\r\nCaffres seem even harder to beat than was our own Florida Indians. The\r\nGovernment is loudly blamed for not acting more promptly in despatching\r\nforces to that colony; and the opinion is expressed that the Duke of\r\nWellington, the Commander-in-Chief of the Army, has, by great age, lost\r\nthe energy of his powers and character. In his younger days, it is said,\r\nhe would either have had the required reinforcements at once sent\r\nforward, or would have resigned his office. The Government and its\r\nagents have also been blamed for not more promptly despatching vessels\r\nto search for the passengers who got off in boats from the steamer\r\nAmazon, destroyed by fire off Scilly. It is possible that by timely\r\naction many lives might have been saved.\r\n\r\nThe danger of a French invasion is much dwelt upon by the British press,\r\nand there have been rumors of a great increase in the army with a view\r\nto such a contingency. These rumors do not seem to be well founded, nor\r\ncan we believe the danger very imminent. Certain parties regard the\r\nwhole as rather a fetch of the Ministry, to strengthen them at the\r\nopening of Parliament, by removing attention from home matters, and by\r\nuniting the nation in a common burst of patriotism. If this be so, the\r\ntrick is a poor one, for if there was real danger of a war, the present\r\nministry would not be likely to be trusted with carrying it on.\r\n\r\nIs France, the march of despotism continues, with rapidity, and apparent\r\nsafety. On the 15th of January Louis Napoleon published his new\r\n\"constitution,\" of which the chief provisions are, that the President\r\nreserves to himself to designate, by a sealed will, the citizen to be\r\nrecommended to the nation as his successor in the event of his death. He\r\ncommands the land and sea forces; he alone can propose new laws; he can\r\nat any time declare the state of siege. His Ministers responsible to\r\nnone but him, and each for his respective duties only; they may be \"the\r\nhonored auxiliaries of his thought,\" but they are not allowed to be \"a\r\ndaily obstacle to the special influence of the chief.\" The Council of\r\nState, whose members the President is to nominate and dismiss at his\r\npleasure, is to put into shape the laws he intends to propose to the\r\nmock Legislature. The Senate, nominated for life by the President, and\r\nto any of whose members he may grant a salary of 30,000 francs, \"may\r\npropose modifications of the Constitution:\" its deliberations are\r\nsecret. The Legislature is to consist of a deputy for every 35,000\r\nelectors, elected by universal suffrage, for six years. The President\r\nconvokes, adjourns, prorogues, and dissolves this body at his pleasure;\r\nhe nominates its President and Vice-President; the official minute of\r\nits proceedings, drawn up by the Bureau, is all that is allowed to be\r\npublished; it cannot initiate any law; amendments on laws submitted to\r\nit by the President cannot even be discussed until they have received\r\nthe sanction of the Council of State. All these bodies are mere\r\ninstruments of the despotic will and selfish egotism of M. Bonaparte.\r\n\r\nThe same week witnessed other measures of very important character also.\r\nThe principal of these are, the suppression and reorganization of the\r\nNational Guard, and the banishment of those public men who were either\r\nconsidered likely to thwart the success of the President's schemes, or\r\non account of their Socialist and extreme democratic doctrines, were\r\nregarded as dangerous to the well-being of the State. Of the expelled\r\nrepresentatives, M. Thiers has gone to England: General Changarnier and\r\nLamoricière, it is thought, will fix their abode in Belgium; and Emile\r\nde Girardin, in the United States.\r\n\r\nThe most important movement in administration, yet taken by the\r\nPresident, is in a decree that the members of the Orleans family, their\r\nhusbands and consorts, and descendants, cannot possess any property\r\n(movable or immovable), in France. They are bound to sell them within\r\nthe year, and in default they will be sold by the domain. Another decree\r\ncancels the donation of his private property, made by Louis Philippe on\r\nthe 7th August to his children, and enacts that their properties, of\r\nabout two hundred millions of francs, shall be employed as follows: Ten\r\nmillions to societies of _secours mutuels_. Ten millions to the\r\nimprovement of the lodgings for the working classes. Ten millions to the\r\nestablishment of a fund for granting loans on mortgage in the\r\ndepartments. Five millions to a benefit fund for the poorer clergy. All\r\nthe officers, sub-officers, and soldiers on active service will receive,\r\naccording to their rank in the Legion of Honor, as follows: The\r\nLegionary, 250 francs; the Officers, 500 francs; Commanders, 1000\r\nfrancs; Grand Officers, 2000 francs; Grand Crosses, 3000 francs. De\r\nMorny, Fould, and others of the Ministers, having refused to concur in\r\nthis confiscation of the Orleans property, resigned, and the Ministry,\r\nwhich had been re-modelled and re-organized (a new \"Ministry of State\"\r\nand a \"Ministry of Police\" having been created), now consists of the\r\nfollowing members, viz.: MM. Abbatucci, Justice; de Persigny, Interior,\r\nAgriculture, and Commerce; Bineau, Finances; de Saint Arnaud, War;\r\nDucos, Marine; Turgot, Foreign Affairs; Fortoul, Public Instruction and\r\nWorship; De Maupas, Police; Casabianca, State; Lefebre Duruflé, Public\r\nWorks. The confiscation decree called forth spirited protests from\r\nMontalembert and Dupin, the eminent lawyer and President of the late\r\nLegislative Assembly. The former, together with Merode, Mortemart,\r\nMoustier, Giraud, André Mathieu, Baudet, Desrobert, and Hallez Chapared,\r\nrefused to countenance a Government which could be guilty of such a\r\nmeasure, and accordingly tendered their resignations as members of the\r\nConsultative Commission. Dupin, also, resigned his post of\r\nProcureur-General of the Court of Cassation, which high office he has\r\nfilled for twenty-two years.\r\n\r\nThe enormous property of the House of Orleans was divided into two main\r\nportions: the hereditary domains, consisting of the estates settled in\r\n1692 by Louis XIV., upon his brother, the revenues arising from which\r\namounted latterly to nearly $500,000 a year; and what may be called the\r\nacquired property, consisting of possessions gradually purchased in a\r\nlong course of years out of the accumulated savings of a wealthy, and,\r\non the whole, prudent, succession of princes. It is this last species of\r\nproperty alone which has been made the subject of absolute confiscation.\r\nThe decree reduces the Orleans princes to absolute poverty. The Comte de\r\nParis and the Duke de Chartres are at the present moment utterly\r\ndestitute of resources. The only property now remaining to the family,\r\nis that derived from Madame Adelaide, the only sister of Louis Philippe.\r\nThis, not having belonged to Louis Philippe in 1830, does not fall\r\nwithin the operation of the decree of confiscation which affects the\r\nrest, and it is now all that remains to the family in France.\r\n\r\nLouis Napoleon, it is intimated, will shortly make another step towards\r\nmonarchy, by forming a matrimonial alliance with a Swedish princess, and\r\nby restoring titles in France. At present, there seems to be no check to\r\nhis advancement--a large majority of the people are evidently on his\r\nside--the army is with him--Russia, Austria, Prussia, Spain, and nearly\r\nall the other monarchies have resolved to support him--and it is\r\nprobable that he will shortly assume the title and state of Emperor, as\r\nwell as the Imperial authority.\r\n\r\nIn Austria, the constitution of 1848 has at last been formally and\r\nfinally rescinded by an Imperial rescript. The reign of secret tribunals\r\nis restored; the proceedings of the law courts are no longer to be\r\npublic. Along with the constitution of the revolutionary epoch, some few\r\nprivileges and securities previously enjoyed by the subjects of the\r\nhouse of Hapsburg have also been swept away. The powers of the\r\nmunicipalities have, wherever they existed, been curtailed, and in some\r\ninstances abolished entirely. It is not the _status quo ante_ that has\r\nbeen restored in the Austrian dominions; the condition of the people has\r\nbeen rendered _more_ servile.\r\n\r\nA very important movement has been going on in Germany. We refer to the\r\nattempt of Austria to combine her dominions with the Prussian\r\nZollverein, by means of a treaty of commercial reciprocity for five\r\nyears, with complete union afterward. A conference of delegates from all\r\nthe important states, except Prussia, was sitting at Vienna during the\r\nmonth of January, but the results have not definitely transpired. Such a\r\nunion would be beneficial to the people of the states involved, by\r\nfavoring industry and giving new activity to trade, as well as by\r\ndispensing with a large proportion of the armies they are now obliged to\r\nsupport.\r\n\r\nThe railway between St. Petersburg and Moscow is now in regular use. The\r\nfirst train, on the 13th of last month, took from Moscow to the capital\r\n792 passengers. The line was eight years in constructing. The line from\r\nSt. Petersburgh to Warsaw has been commenced, under the direction of\r\nGeneral Gersfeldt, who assisted General Klenmichel in the former line.\r\n\r\nThrough the representations of Lord Palmerston to the Turkish\r\nGovernment, all difficulties have been removed with regard to the\r\nEgyptian railway, the works of which are to proceed without delay. Mr.\r\nStephenson has surveyed the line. The two branches of the Nile are to be\r\ncrossed by a pontoon bridge. The Pasha has given orders for 18,000\r\nlaborers to be put upon the works.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Fine Arts\r\n\r\n\r\nKAULBACH has just finished the cartoon of his Homer. This is the second\r\nin the series of great frescoes with which he is to adorn the new Museum\r\nat Berlin. The first, the Dispersion, at Babel, and the third, the\r\nDestruction of Jerusalem, are completed upon the walls, and have already\r\nbeen described in these pages. The Homer possesses the same richness of\r\nartistic combinations, and the same daring sweep of thought and\r\nimagination, which undeniably place Kaulbach at the head of the artists\r\nof this age. He represents in Homer the culture and the religion of\r\nGreece; the idea he depicts is, that Homer gave Greece her gods, and the\r\npeculiar tendency of her intellectual development. The poet is, of\r\ncourse, the central figure in the picture. The Ionic bard sits upon the\r\nprow of a ship that is just approaching the Grecian shore. His right arm\r\nis raised in the excitement of poetic inspiration; a lyre rests upon his\r\nleft. Behind him, partly veiled, lost in profound revery, sits a female\r\nform, in whose lofty, intellectual features we recognise the\r\nimpersonation of the traditional source of all early poetry; it is the\r\nimpersonation of the Saga or Myth. She recalls those sybils who came\r\nfrom Asia to Greece to proclaim the oracles of the gods. In her hand the\r\nhelm is still resting, in token that her guidance has brought Homer to\r\nGreece. A group of unclad nymphs, mingled with swans, swim around the\r\nvessel; one of them rises wholly from the water to listen to the strains\r\nof the singer. This is Thetis; she knows that he is chanting the praise\r\nof her son Achilles, and has left her crystal abode with the Nereids to\r\nfollow him. At the left of the picture, on the land, stand groups of\r\ngrave, manly forms, the representatives of Greece, assembled to receive\r\nthe poet and his teachings. There are three of these groups, connected\r\nby subordinate figures. In front is a lofty figure, crowned with laurel,\r\na beaker in his hand, and a charming cup-bearer at his side; this is the\r\npoet Alcaeus. Behind him stands Mnesicles, the architect of the Propylæ,\r\nwith a plan of that work in his hand; next him is Solon, the lawgiver.\r\nOn the other side stand Herodotus, Pindar, Sophocles, Æschylus, and\r\nPythagoras, their features all marked with attention and interest; while\r\na priest of a more ancient faith looks on in gloomy displeasure at the\r\nnew singer and the impression he produces; and Bakis, the old\r\nsoothsayer, hides his Golden Proverbs beneath the rocks. A second group,\r\nmore toward the centre of the picture, is composed of country people,\r\nshepherds, huntsmen, and cultivators, with here and there a warrior,\r\nhearkening eagerly to the bard; among them a faun, with pointed ears and\r\nmocking mein, listens to the unaccustomed tones. On an elevation at the\r\nleft, this division of the picture is completed by a group which\r\nrepresents the atelier of a sculptor--the master, with two youths and a\r\nmaiden about him, is at work on a statue of Achilles--but the songs of\r\nHomer call his attention to other and grander subjects of his art. These\r\nare the Olympian gods themselves, who sit, some of them aloft in the\r\nclouds, over a sacrificial altar, around which warriors are dancing a\r\nmartial dance, while others are moving along a rainbow to enter temples\r\njust dedicated to them--Eros leading with the Graces, and Apollo, with\r\nthe Muses, following. A temple, in process of erection, and distant\r\nmountains, occupy the background. It will be noticed that the artist has\r\nomitted many very important elements of Greek history and culture from\r\nthis composition. It contains no hint of Thermopylæ or Marathon, nor any\r\nallusion to Plato or Pericles. No doubt the learned artist has\r\ndesignedly avoided making his work too exact and didactic, but it\r\ncertainly would seem that these were too prominent in themselves not to\r\nbe wholly overlooked. It will also be observed that there is no action\r\nand no dramatic effect in the whole; but those who have seen the cartoon\r\nlack words to describe the noble beauty of the figures. Nearly all are\r\nmen, but such majesty and harmony of form and feature, of outline and\r\nmovement, well befit an age and people that produced the very ideal of\r\nmanly beauty. The nymphs in the foreground are also said to be\r\nunspeakably lovely, and endowed with the most intimate charm of maidenly\r\ninnocence. Of course it is impossible to appreciate the full effect of\r\nthe picture, until it is executed in colors; but in that respect\r\nKaulbach is certain of a perfection in nowise behind the other\r\ndepartments of his work.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA picture by the Belgian artist, Gallait, has produced a great\r\nexcitement at Vienna, where it formed the most prominent feature in the\r\nJanuary exhibition of the Art Union. The subject is the Last Moments of\r\nEgmont.

The\r\nmonument is to be executed by Lucciardi, a young German.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Bulletin of the New-England Art Union_ contains an etching of\r\nAllston's _Witch of Endor_, in anticipation of the large engraving of\r\nit, which is to be distributed among the subscribers. This is expected\r\nto be of a much higher order than any thing that has yet appeared from\r\nany Art Union in the world.\r\n\r\nThe American Art Union is to have its drawing at the end of the present\r\nmonth, having received a sufficient number of subscriptions, at length,\r\nto make this step seem advisable in the opinion of its directors.\r\n\r\nThe Philadelphia Art Union is taking vigorous steps to retrieve its\r\nrecent losses by fire.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nScientific Discoveries and Proceedings of Learned Societies.\r\n\r\n\r\nOur countryman, Mr. E. E. SQUIER, is now in London, where he has just\r\nbrought out an edition of his work on Nicaragua, and he recently\r\naddressed the _Royal Society of Literature_ on the Mexican\r\nHieroglyphics, as exhibited in the publication of Lord Kingsborough. The\r\nMSS. engraved in this splendid work are chiefly rituals--a few only\r\nbeing historical. Of the events referred to, some occurred 600 years B.\r\nC., and one reference appears to be to an eclipse that happened 900\r\nyears B. C. The dualistic principle runs through the Mexican Pantheon;\r\nit consists, _i. e._, of male and female divinities, representing the\r\nactive and passive principles in nature. We find also in this mythology\r\na trinity, corresponding to Brahma, Vishnu, and Siva--the productive,\r\npreserving, and destroying powers--in the Indian. Inferior deities\r\nrepresent attributes; each name denoting an attribute; hence, the gods\r\nof the Mexicans were far from being so numerous as they appear to be.\r\nThe supreme divinity had about fifty names: several of which agree in\r\nsignification with those applied in the Old Testament to Jehovah. He is\r\nrepresented wearing a mask, to intimate that he cannot be looked upon.\r\nFor each character or attribute there was a different mask, frequently\r\nrepresenting animals; particular animals being dedicated to particular\r\ndeities. The different deities were likewise symbolized by different\r\ncolors--the water-god by blue--the god of fire by red--the inferior\r\ndivinities by a dark tint, &c. Peculiar symbols likewise appear as\r\ncrests, or head ornaments. The lecturer stated that the Mexican records\r\nunquestionably refer to an Eastern origin of the nation.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nRespecting experiments in _Photography_, the London _Literary Gazette_\r\nsays \"the preparation of albumenized glass plates promised much, and in\r\nsome hands, as in those of Ross and Thomson of Edinburgh, and\r\nLanghenheim of Philadelphia,--the best results have been obtained.\r\nEssentially, their processes consist respectively of separating the\r\nfluid portion of the white of egg, and adding thereto a weak solution of\r\nthe iodide of potassium. This is floated over a clean glass plate, so as\r\nto cover it with a very thin film, and carefully dried. When this is\r\ncompleted, the prepared surface is dipped into a solution of nitrate of\r\nsilver, and thus an iodide of silver is formed on the surface. This\r\niodide of silver being washed, as in the calotype process, with\r\ngallo-nitrate of silver, is very sensitive to the solar radiations, and\r\nbeing placed in the camera-obscura, is speedily impressed with a dormant\r\nimage, which is developed by the deoxidizing action of gallic acid.\" A\r\ngood steam gauge has long been a desideratum. All kinds of portable\r\ngauges are, either not to be depended upon, or subject to frequent\r\nrepairs; so much so, that by law every steam-engine used in France is\r\nprovided with a gauge on the barometer principle, that is 10 feet, 15\r\nfeet, 20 feet high for a steam pressure of 60 pounds, 90 pounds or 120\r\npounds to the square inch. Mr. Bourdon, chief engineer at the Creusot\r\nworks, where the engines of the frigate Mogador, were built, has devised\r\na gauge, which has obtained for him a medal at the London Fair, and is\r\nhighly spoken of. It is based upon the fact, that a thin metal tube,\r\ncoiled up and subjected to internal pressure, will tend to uncoil itself\r\nin proportion to the amount of the pressure. The tube used is first\r\nflattened preparatory to the coiling up, so as to render this operation\r\nmore easy. One of the extremities communicates with the boiler, the\r\nother is pointed and turned up so as to serve as an index on a circular\r\nscale. The apparatus is fixed in a case, in the shape of a hair\r\nmedallion, and closed with a glass. Experiment must show if the effects\r\nof temperature be insignificant compared with those of pressure, and if\r\nthe internal working of metallic atoms will not in time make this gauge\r\ngive wrong indications.--If the instrument can bear the test of\r\npractical use, it will soon supersede every other already known. The\r\ninventor has already been rewarded by a council medal at the London\r\nExhibition, and the cross of the Legion of Honor in France. In the last\r\nnamed country, the Government has made provision to try it on all the\r\nrailways.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nExperiments have been made on the Paris and Lyons Railway for the\r\napplication of electromagnetism to locomotives. The report goes on to\r\nsay that the apparatus prepared for the purpose was applied to an\r\nexceedingly large locomotive, and succeeded perfectly, first on a level,\r\nand then on an ascent of thirteen millièmes, the steepest in fact of the\r\nline. It was feared that difficulties would arise from the smoothness of\r\nthe wheels on the rails,--but no inconvenience was perceptible from that\r\ncircumstance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLORD BROUGHAM has been passing a few weeks in Paris, and the papers\r\ndwell upon the marvellous preservation of his powers, which seem to\r\nbaffle the attacks of time. _Galignani_ says he \"read at the _Academy of\r\nSciences_, before a most crowded auditory, a paper on the optical and\r\nmathematical inquiries which have occupied his time during his late\r\nresidence at Cannes. His lordship accompanied the reading of this memoir\r\nwith numerous demonstrations on the board, and for upwards of an hour\r\ncaptivated the attention of his hearers. MM. Arago, Biot, Ténard, and\r\nother eminent scientific men were present, and appeared deeply\r\ninterested in the explanations of their learned _confrére_. His lordship\r\nspoke the whole time with great animation, and his numerous friends\r\npresent were delighted to perceive that he was in such excellent\r\nhealth.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. ISAAC LEA, of Philadelphia, since his retirement from the house of\r\nLea & Blanchard, is devoting himself more assiduously than before, to\r\nthose scientific pursuits in which he has attained to such well-deserved\r\neminence. The London _Athenæum_ has the following notice of his most\r\nrecent publication:--\r\n\r\n     \"_Observations on the Genus Unio, &c._ Vol. IV: by ISAAC LEA.\r\n     It is pleasant, amidst all the material activity of the United\r\n     States, to find ourselves ever and anon called on to bear\r\n     testimony to the love of nature, truth, and beauty which there\r\n     developes itself. In Mr. Lea's book we have descriptions and\r\n     drawings of shells, originally published in the 'Transactions\r\n     of the American Philosophical Society,' which would have done\r\n     honor to any of the scientific societies of Europe. Such works\r\n     can be of interest only to the professed conchologist; but in\r\n     his hands they become treasuries of facts by which he works out\r\n     the great laws of morphology regulating the animal forms that\r\n     he more particularly studies. The shells described in this\r\n     volume are for the most part American, and from fresh water;\r\n     and indicate how large a field for natural history inquiry the\r\n     vast continent of America still presents.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. GEORGE CATLIN, the well-known American traveller, has brought\r\nforward in London a plan for a _Museum of Mankind_, \"to contain and\r\nperpetuate the familiar looks, the manufactures, history, and records of\r\nall the vanishing races of man.\" A report on the subject was read by him\r\nat one of the scientific societies; and on the 9th of January he\r\ndelivered an address on the subject at his American-Indian Collection.\r\nHe opened by a general review of his past labors in the study of the\r\nnative tribes of America, illustrated by a reference to some of the\r\nnumerous records he has collected, and by the appearance of various\r\nnatives themselves in full costume. He then proceeded to enforce the\r\ncomprehensive scheme which now occupies him. After pointing out the\r\nurgent necessity of at once engaging in the formation of a museum of the\r\nkind proposed by him, if it is to be gathered together at all--for the\r\nin-roads of civilization are rapidly extirpating the native races of the\r\nworld--he went on to develope his plan in its practical details. He\r\nproposes, as the first step, the purchase and fitting-up of a steamer\r\n\"as a floating museum,\" in which the seaport towns of all countries\r\nshould be visited; considering that this mode of exhibition would\r\npossess great advantages through \"the facility of its visiting the chief\r\ncities of the world, stopping no longer in any than a lucrative\r\nexcitement could be kept up;\" and in the great immediate saving of time,\r\nas well as in other respects. Mr. Catlin's present collection would form\r\nthe basis of such a museum. Mr. Catlin defines the word \"mankind,\" for\r\nhis purpose, as meaning no more than the expiring members of the great\r\nhuman family--the Red Indian, the native Australian, the Greenlander,\r\nthe Peruvian,--and so forth. Measures, no doubt, might be taken for\r\nobtaining and preserving such memorials as exist of these and similar\r\nraces; and it is a reflection on the governments of England and of the\r\nUnited States that they have hitherto remained so indifferent in the\r\nmatter,--that being severally custodians of certain interesting and\r\nrapidly obliterating pages of the book of human history, they should\r\nsuffer the final extinction of the record to take place before their\r\neyes without any attempt to preserve its lessons for futurity.\r\n\r\nMAJENDIE, LOUIS and LONDE--appointed by the _French Academy of Medicine_\r\nto examine a work by Dr. James Gillkrest, entitled, _Is Yellow Fever\r\ncontagious or not?_ have made a report in which they speak highly of the\r\nindustry and skill displayed by Dr. Gillkrest, and adopt the conclusion\r\nat which he arrives with regard to the non-contagiousness of this\r\ndisease. \"The author,\" say they, establishes by numerous well-selected\r\nand incontrovertible proofs that yellow fever is not contagious under\r\nany circumstances,--not even in the case of crowding in this disease,\r\nwhether of the dead or of the living; that the removal of the\r\nindividuals from the influence of the local causes which produce this\r\naffection is the fittest means of preventing its extension; and, lastly,\r\nthat the cordons called \"sanitary and quarantine measures, far from\r\narresting yellow fever, on the contrary favor its extension by combining\r\nthe population within the influence of the local causes which give it\r\nbirth.\" It may be hoped that with valuable testimony like this before\r\nthem, governments will lose no time in abandoning oppressive quarantine\r\nregulations, at least as far as yellow fever is concerned.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom Holland, we hear that the dissolution of the _Royal Institute of\r\nthe Netherlands_, which was ordered by royal decree to take place on the\r\n1st of this month, has caused great dissatisfaction in the literary and\r\nscientific circles, and has called forth a rather indignant remonstrance\r\nfrom the Dutch Literary Association. The Institute held its last meeting\r\non the 15th December; and it drew up a series of resolutions,\r\nexpressing, in dignified terms, its sense of the injustice done it, and\r\ndeclaring that its dissolution will be \"a heavy blow and a great\r\ndiscouragement\" to Dutch science. The want of funds is the pretext put\r\nforth by the government for breaking up the learned body.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe _Society of Antiquaries_ of Copenhagen is about to publish an\r\n_Archæological Atlas of the North_, accompanied by explanatory matter in\r\nFrench and Danish. It will be a valuable addition to the memoirs,\r\npapers, and documents, already published by the Society. This scientific\r\nassociation is one of the most important in Northern Europe, and its\r\nmembers include many of the most distinguished _savans_ of Germany,\r\nSweden, Norway, and Denmark. It possesses an excellent library, which\r\ncontains, amongst other things of great value, about 2000 Icelandic\r\nmanuscripts, very ancient, and written in the old Scandinavian tongue.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRecent Deaths.\r\n\r\n\r\nAUGUSTUS SIDNEY DOANE was born, of a highly respectable family, in\r\nBoston, on the second day of April, 1808. He was educated at Harvard\r\nCollege, from which he received the degrees of Master of Arts and Doctor\r\nof Medicine, in 1828, a few months before attaining his majority. He\r\nsoon after went to Europe, where he passed two years in travel, and in\r\nattendance upon medical and surgical lectures, in Paris; and returning,\r\nin 1830, was married to Miss Gordon, the daughter of an eminent merchant\r\nof Boston, and settled in the city of New-York, where he continued to\r\nreside until his death, at Staten Island, on the morning of the 27th of\r\nJanuary. Although at all times an earnest student and successful\r\npractitioner in his profession, Dr. Doane, for several years after his\r\nsettlement in New-York, devoted considerable attention to political,\r\nhistorical and general, literature, and from the first, he was an\r\nindustrious writer on medicine and surgery. When the cholera first broke\r\nout in this country, in 1832, he was the earliest to address the\r\nprofession in a scientific and practical discussion of its character,\r\nand the ability, untiring industry, bravery and benevolence which he\r\nexhibited during that melancholy season, established his popularity with\r\nthe people, and secured for him a degree of respect from his class which\r\nthey have seldom bestowed on one so young. Among his earliest\r\ncontributions to medical literature, was his edition of Dr. GOOD'S\r\n_Study of Medicine_, in which he embodied, not only very important\r\ndiscussions and notes of fact by himself, but the best views of the\r\nmedical writers of the United States on the various subjects treated in\r\nthat celebrated performance. He inscribed his edition of the _Study of\r\nMedicine_ to the common friend of the author and himself, the learned\r\nand excellent Dr. JOHN W. FRANCIS. He also translated MAYGRIER'S great\r\nwork on _Midwifery_, and several standard authorities on Anatomy and\r\nSurgery; among which are DUPUYTREN'S _Surgery_, LUGOL'S _Researches on\r\nScrofulous Diseases_, BAYLE'S _Descriptive Anatomy_, BLANDIN'S\r\n_Topographical Anatomy_, MECKEL'S _Anatomy_, SCOUTETTEN on _Cholera_,\r\nRICORD on _Syphilis_, and CHAUSSIER _on the Arteries_. His editorial\r\ncontributions to _Surgery Illustrated_, and many occasional papers in\r\nthe medical journals also increased his fame and usefulness. It was,\r\nperhaps, his chief distinction as an author, that, being familiar with\r\nthe languages of France, Germany and Italy, and personally acquainted\r\nwith the living lights of medical science in those countries, and with\r\nthe practice which obtained in the chief foreign hospitals, he was among\r\nthe first, as he was the most diligent and successful, in translating\r\nthe chief works of the European physicians into our language, and\r\nadapting them to our habits and necessities. In 1839, he was appointed\r\nProfessor of Physiology in the University of New-York, but he soon\r\nresigned, with his colleagues. In 1840, he received from Governor\r\nSeward, the place of Health Officer and Physician in Chief to the Marine\r\nHospital, and, with Dr. TURNER, Health Commissioner, and Dr. MCNEVIN,\r\nResident Physician, constituted the Board of Commissioners of Health,\r\nwhich then exercised all the functions of the present Commissioners of\r\nEmigration. Fearless and energetic in the discharge of his official\r\nduties, (which he always attended to in person, and not, as the custom\r\nof some is, by deputies), he protected the city from unnecessary fear,\r\nas well as from disease, and presented bills of mortality scarcely\r\nparalleled in the hospitals of the country--averaging but seven per\r\ncent. The Commissioners in general superintendence of the Quarantine, in\r\nreports to the Legislature, awarded to him the highest praise for his\r\nadministration, and when, in consequence of a change in the political\r\ncharacter of the government, he was superseded, in 1843, both the Irish\r\nand German Emigrant Societies tendered him expressions of gratitude for\r\nhis unwearying zeal and humanity in behalf of the class most dependent\r\nupon his services. In 1848, he was appointed one of the consulting\r\nphysicians of the Bellevue Hospital, but declined the office, in\r\nconsequence of holding the agreeable and profitable post of physician to\r\nthe Astor House. During the prevalence of the cholera in New-York in\r\n1849, he was one of the ward cholera physicians, and devoted himself\r\nwith his customary earnestness, to practise among the poor of his\r\ndistrict. In 1850, he was again appointed Health Officer by Governor\r\nFish, and he discharged his duties until he followed Drs. Treat,\r\nLedyard, Baily, De Witt, and others, in the sacrifice of his life to\r\nthem. He was seized with the ship-fever on the 14th of January, while\r\ninspecting the packet Great Western, which arrived from Liverpool early\r\non the morning of that day, with nearly seven hundred immigrants, of\r\nwhom a large proportion were sick. He spent several hours in examination\r\nand the supervision of removals to the hospital, during which several\r\ndeaths occurred, and was soon after, with Mr. Lewis B. Butler, the\r\nhumane and efficient steward, who had been honorably associated with him\r\nin both terms of his administration as Health Officer, attacked with the\r\nfever in its most malignant form. Dr. Doane died on the 27th of January,\r\nand Mr. Butler on the 6th of February. These deaths were public as well\r\nas private calamities. Dr. Doane must be ranked among the most generous,\r\nwise, and active citizens--the most warm-hearted and respectable men--as\r\nwell as among the most eminent physicians, of our time, in New-York. On\r\nthe 15th of February, an eloquent discourse upon his life and character\r\nwas delivered by his friend, the Rev. E. H. Chapin, in his church in\r\nMurray-street, of which Dr. Doane was a member.\r\n\r\nSince the above notice of Dr. Doane was written, we have received from\r\none of the most eminent physicians of the United States the following\r\nestimate of his character and abilities:\r\n\r\n     \"The character of Dr. Doane commends itself to our\r\n     consideration for many striking traits. His whole life, from\r\n     his boyhood, was marked by a devotion to the acquisition of\r\n     knowledge. His attainments enabled him to enter Harvard\r\n     University at an early age, and he was recognized in that\r\n     admirable school as a young man of splendid abilities and\r\n     thorough scholarship. His medical theses there were exhibitions\r\n     of knowledge such as is but rarely possessed by the students,\r\n     whose aim is chiefly for the doctorate. He received the\r\n     highest medical honors of his Alma Mater, with the warmest\r\n     approbation of the professors. By that rigid economy of time\r\n     which through life distinguished him in all his pursuits, he\r\n     found leisure, amidst multiplied cares and responsibilities, to\r\n     become an excellent satirist and Grecian, and to this he added\r\n     a knowledge of the French, German, and Italian languages. From\r\n     his literary labors we might infer that his chief excellence\r\n     was in the promptitude and ability which he evinced in the\r\n     preparation of so many works of writers abroad, in translations\r\n     for the American public. But this view of the case would hardly\r\n     do justice to the stature of his mind, and his talents for\r\n     original observation. Struggling with many difficulties and\r\n     urged by the necessities of a family, it became his imperative\r\n     duty to give his best efforts to those occasions which might\r\n     prove most available for his wants; and hence we find him more\r\n     busily employed in the promulgation of the doctrines and\r\n     opinions of others, than in recording the results of his\r\n     immediate practical wisdom. His most labored effort is\r\n     unquestionably his translation from the German of the large\r\n     work by Professor Meckel, on _Human Anatomy_. In his admirable\r\n     edition of Good's _Study of Medicine_, we notice more of the\r\n     immediate observer, and the man of extensive medical and\r\n     physiological reading. This great treatise by the learned Good\r\n     found in Dr. Doane a worthy editor. His edition is enlarged by\r\n     numerous notes by the cis-atlantic scholar, and as they embrace\r\n     the theoretical and practical views of the physicians and\r\n     writers of the United States, it has always held a conspicuous\r\n     place among books referred to for the doctrines, in theory and\r\n     in practice, of a large number of the best original observers\r\n     our country has occasion to boast of. This contribution to the\r\n     science of healing has met with an extensive sale with the\r\n     profession, and like other efforts of Dr. Doane in the\r\n     departments of physical science, been productive of great\r\n     benefit to the noble calling of which he was so conspicuous a\r\n     member.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nR. A. DAVENPORT, an English writer, whose histories of America and\r\nIndia, and some of whose poems, were formerly well known, died in\r\nCamberwell, on the 21st of January, at the age of seventy-five. The\r\nattention of a police officer was attracted by moans issuing from\r\nBrunswick-cottage, Park-street, the residence of the deceased. He broke\r\ninto the front parlor, and found Mr. Davenport lying in the passage,\r\nnearly dead, with a bottle that had contained laudanum in his hand. A\r\nsurgeon was sent for, but a few minutes after his arrival, he expired.\r\nSeveral bottles containing laudanum were found in his bedroom, of which\r\nhe was in the habit of taking large quantities while writing. The house\r\npresented an extraordinary appearance; the rooms were literally crammed\r\nwith books, manuscripts, pictures, ancient coins, and antiques of\r\nvarious descriptions. Mr. Davenport has resided in it more than eleven\r\nyears, during which time it had never been cleansed, and the books,\r\nbeds, and furniture were rapidly decaying, every thing being covered\r\nwith dust. The windows were all broken, the whole place presenting a\r\nmost dilapidated appearance. Verdict was \"That the deceased died from\r\ninadvertently taking an overdose of opium.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe eminent Italian poet, GIOVANNI BERCHET, died near the first of\r\nJanuary. Born, says the _Athenæum_, at Milan, in 1788, he imbibed at an\r\nearly age that hatred of the rule of Austria which a few years\r\nafterwards inspired his muse. It was when the well-known political\r\nevents of 1821 forced him to leave his country, that his active mind,\r\nfervently devoted to the principles of rational liberty, burst forth in\r\nthose powerful and touching strains which are to this day deeply graven\r\non the heart of every Italian patriot, and which, during the sanguinary\r\ncontest of 1848, beguiled the weary march of the troops, and animated\r\nthe combatants in the conflict. He was the first who had the courage to\r\nforsake the old beaten track of insipid sonnet-making. His poems stand\r\nalone, unrivalled in the novelty of their language and conception, and\r\nin the noble spirit which pervades every line. Few Italians can repeat\r\nhis _Clarina_, his _Matilde_, or the _Hermit of Mont Cenis_, without\r\nfeeling strong emotion. But by far the best of his productions, which\r\nunfortunately are not numerous, are the _Fantasie_. The language and\r\nversification are beautiful and varied, and we strongly recommend all\r\nItalian students to leave, with all due respect, Tasso and Petrarch for\r\na while, and read a page of Giovanni Berchet. This distinguished\r\npatriot-poet was for some time member of the Sardinian parliament, and\r\nhis loss is deeply mourned in all Italy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe death of the younger of the celebrated Misses BERRY, is mentioned in\r\nthe London _Times_. She died, after a short illness, at the advanced age\r\nof nearly eighty-eight, in the unimpaired vigor of all her faculties.\r\nHer varied talents and incomparable amiability threw light and life\r\naround the graver and loftier powers of her sister, and their union,\r\nunbroken for an hour through the greatest portion of a century, made\r\nthem the charm of the most brilliant circles in Europe. Her sister, in\r\nher eighty-ninth year, equally unfaded in her great intellectual gifts,\r\nstill lingers for a while on the scene.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Paris papers report the death, in that city, in his eighty-fifth\r\nyear, of M.

As early as the days of the First Consulship he was\r\ndistinguished by Napoleon; and his works on ivory executed by sovereign\r\norder during the Empire found their way as Imperial gifts into the\r\ncollections of various princes of Europe.

We had known Mr. Williams a great many years,\r\nand shared in the general regard inspired by his amiability, and the\r\nquiet bravery of his life, of which many illustrations are known to his\r\nmore intimate acquaintances. He was an Englishman, of good family, born\r\nin London in 1790, and educated we believe at one of the great\r\nuniversities. We have heard him say, that in early life he was as thin\r\nalmost as Calvin Edson, but for the last fifteen or twenty years he was\r\nthe most obese and plethoric-looking person in New-York--a sort of\r\nLewis, or Lambert, of astonishing breadth and rotundity. We must not\r\nenter into details respecting his domestic life, but it may be mentioned\r\nthat he was a party to a clandestine marriage, that his wife was an\r\ninvalid for very many years, and that he toiled with his pen incessantly\r\nto promote her happiness. He was best known as a translator, and gave to\r\nthe press a vast number of the novels of Dumas and other Frenchmen. He\r\nslept little, and it was his habit to sit by his table, in his chamber,\r\nfrom eight o'clock in the evening until nearly morning, plying his pen\r\nwith neatness and rapidity, and with an unusual command of good English,\r\nthough his style was sometimes defective in finish, and he never\r\nacquired much skill in punctuation. His original compositions, chiefly\r\nin magazines and newspapers, were very numerous, and on a vast variety\r\nof subjects, indicating a rarely equalled mastery of curious\r\nintelligence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nCOLONEL WOLFGANG BARON KEMÉNYI belonged to the ancient family of Johan\r\nof Keményi, in former times sovereign of Transylvania. He was born in\r\n1789, in Torda (Transylvania), and received his first education at the\r\nUniversity of Nagy-Enyor. At seventeen he entered the Austrian army. He\r\ncommenced his military career in the times of Napoleon, and took an\r\nactive part in the French campaign from 1813 to 1815. After the\r\ntermination of the war, he still continued, during a few years, in the\r\nsame regiment, when, tired of the idle life in garrison, he left the\r\narmy in 1824 as captain. From that moment he retired to his estates at\r\nTorda, where soon after he married the daughter of an Austrian general,\r\nand led, in this retirement until 1834, the quiet life of an\r\nagriculturist. The complexion of the times did not permit him to spend\r\nhis whole time in solitude, and being a patriot, he soon entered the\r\npolitical field, became a zealous visitor of congress and the diets, and\r\none of the most decided adversaries of Austria. He next became a member\r\nof the Transylvanian Diet, and through his participation in the\r\ndiscussions and struggles of that time, the storms of 1848 did not find\r\nhim unprepared to brave them. He was one of those, who the first\r\ndeclared openly in favor of the unions question; at Torda, surrounded by\r\nWallachian fanatics, he unfolded the banner of union. When it became\r\nKeményi's conviction that the crisis could not be removed in a peaceable\r\nway, he drew again his sword, and his heroic exploits during the\r\nmemorable winter campaign under Bem, in Transylvania, contributed highly\r\nto the glory of the Hungarian arms. Having been appointed, by the\r\nArchduke Stephen, of Austria, Major of the Transylvanian National Guard,\r\nhe distinguished himself eminently in the victorious battles at\r\nSzibo, Besstritz, and others; and afterwards he was nominated\r\nLieutenant-Colonel in the Active Army, and at the same time charged by\r\nBem with the command of a portion of his division. His most heroic deed\r\nwas the battle of Ploki. Bem, at the head of a very small but audacious\r\nband, arrived victorious before Herrmannstadt, capital of the province;\r\nbut there, surrounded and pressed by an overpowering number of enemies,\r\nhe commissioned Keményi to march to the frontier, and take up a\r\nreinforcement. He immediately undertook that march, pierced the lines of\r\nthe enemy, drew on the reinforcements, and a few days after, delivered\r\nthat memorable battle in which, with 2,000 men and seven guns, he beat\r\nthe whole Austrian force, consisting of 15,000 men and thirty cannons,\r\nout of the field. By this victory he not only averted the destruction of\r\nTransylvania, which a day before still appeared inevitable, but he also\r\ngave to Bem opportunity to establish that grand line of offensive\r\noperations which, in less than a month, swept Transylvania clear of the\r\nenemy. For the valor displayed in this decisive action, he was made\r\nColonel, and received the order of valor, second class, having been\r\ndecorated some time before with the same order of the third class. He\r\ntook also a glorious part in all the important battles of the summer\r\ncampaign. He was one of those superior officers of the Transylvanian\r\narmy to whom Bem was mostly attached, and, possessing his entire\r\nconfidence, were steadfast till the last moment. On the termination of\r\nthe war, although proscribed, he lived for some time at his native\r\nplace; but, searched for every where, he at last was obliged to fly to\r\nEngland. After Kossuth's arrival in London he became president of the\r\nadministration of the Hungarian emigration. When he took the management,\r\nit was already in bad circumstances, but on the departure of Kossuth he\r\nhad to overcome greater difficulties, because his solicitude extended\r\nitself not only to the emigrants residing in England, but to those who\r\nlanguished in France and Belgium. Notwithstanding the loss of his\r\nestates by sequestration, he still possessed some pecuniary means, and\r\nassisted, as far as he could, his distressed countrymen; and during the\r\nshort time of his administration, he was always acting, with paternal\r\ncare, for the good of his unhappy companions. Baron Keményi died\r\nsuddenly in London, on Monday, the 5th of January, while listening to\r\nthe reading of a letter respecting the management of his committee,\r\naddressed to the _Daily News_, by Mr. Toulmin Smith. He was sixty-three\r\nyears of age.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHEBERT RODWELL, for many years known in musical and literary circles as\r\na composer and author died in London early in January. He possessed\r\nconsiderable taste and feeling, and produced ballads and concerted\r\npieces of much sweetness. As a dramatic author, his efforts were\r\nprincipally confined to performances of a light and humorous cast,\r\nincluding burlesques and the openings of pantomimes. He produced two\r\nserial works of fiction, each of which had a fair success--_Old London\r\nBridge_ and _The Memoirs of an Umbrella_, Some scenes from the latter\r\nwere dramatized, and had a run at the Adelphi.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGENERAL SIR FREDERICK PHILIPSE ROBINSON, G.C.B., Colonel of the\r\nthirty-ninth Regiment, died at Brighton on the 1st instant, in his\r\neighty-eighth year. He was the oldest soldier in the British army,\r\nhaving been within a month of seventy-five years in the service. He was\r\na native of New-York, and a son of the well known royalist, Colonel\r\nBeverly Robinson, whose name is associated with that of Andre in the\r\ntreason of Benedict Arnold, by a daughter of Frederick Philipse. He\r\nentered the British army as an ensign, in February, 1777, and for five\r\nyears he was in the first American war, and was present in the principal\r\nbattles fought during that period. Subsequently, in 1794, he went to the\r\nWest Indies, and shared in the capture of Martinique, St. Lucia, and\r\nGuadaloupe; he was also at the storming of Fleur d'Epée and the Heights\r\nof Palmiste. In 1812 Philipse Robinson joined the army in the Peninsula.\r\nAt the battle of Vittoria he commanded the brigade which carried the\r\nvillage of Gamazza Mayo, without firing one shot. He also was present at\r\nthe first and second assaults on San Sebastian, and was severely wounded\r\nat the second attack. He took part in the passage of the Bidassoa, the\r\ngrand reconnaissance before Bayonne, the battle of the Nive (being there\r\nagain severely wounded), in the blockade of Bayonne, and in the repulse\r\nof the sortie from that place, when he succeeded to the command of the\r\nfifth division of the army. In June, 1814, Major-General Robinson went\r\nto North America in command of a brigade, and he led the forces intended\r\nfor the attack on Plattsburg, but received orders to retire, after\r\nhaving forced the passage of the Saranac. After the end of hostilities,\r\nhe came from Canada to this city to embark for England, and on his way\r\nstopped at the old family mansion where he was born--two or three miles\r\nabove West Point--and as he walked through the house (now owned by Mr.\r\nRichard D. Arden), he is said to have \"wept like a child.\" Soon after\r\nthe conclusion of the war he was appointed commander-in-chief and\r\nprovisional governor of the Upper Provinces, which appointment he held\r\nuntil June, 1816. He had received the gold medal with two clasps for\r\nVittoria, San Sebastian, and the Nive.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Rev. JOHN TAYLOR JONES, D.D., of the Baptist Mission in Siam, died\r\nin Bangkok, on the 13th of September, 1851, after an illness of about\r\none week. He was one of the best scholars and most uniformly successful\r\ntranslators in the missionary service of the American churches. He had\r\nbeen in Siam nearly twenty years, and, with the exception of the book of\r\nGenesis, had rendered the entire Bible into the Siamese language. He was\r\nwell known and much respected by the best classes of the people of that\r\ncountry, and the king of Siam (who fluently speaks and writes English)\r\nmarked his sense of the public bereavement by a letter of condolence to\r\nhis widow.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe English West Indian steam-ship _Amazon_, left Southampton for a\r\nfirst voyage on Friday the 2d of January, and at a quarter before one\r\no'clock on Sunday morning was discovered to be on fire; the flames had\r\nsoon complete mastery of the vessel, and so swift was its destruction\r\nthat many perished in their berths by suffocation, and many of those\r\nwho, half naked, made their way to the deck, were burnt in ascending the\r\nladders, and several passengers are described as having rushed up with\r\ntheir clothes in flames. In twenty minutes all was over but the last\r\ncruel agony. So rapid was the ravage, that it seems to have been more\r\nlike an explosion than the ordinary progress of fire. The alarm and\r\ndespair were almost simultaneous. The number of persons destroyed in\r\nthis most pitiable and frightful catastrophe was 115, and among them was\r\nthe accomplished author, Mr. ELIOT WARBURTON. His career in literature\r\nhad been unusually brief. It is only a few years since _The Crescent and\r\nthe Cross_ attracted general applause; _Hochelaga, or, The Conquest of\r\nCanada_, followed soon after; and last year gave us his _Memoirs of\r\nHorace Walpole_, and the story of _Darien, or, The Merchant Prince_. Mr.\r\nWarburton had been deputed by the Atlantic and Pacific Junction Company,\r\nto come to a friendly understanding with the tribes of Indians who\r\ninhabit the Isthmus of Darien. It was also the intention of Mr.\r\nWarburton to make himself perfectly acquainted with every part of these\r\ndistricts, and with whatever referred to their topography, climate, and\r\nresources, and he undoubtedly would have given the results of his visit\r\nin an interesting and valuable work on the subject, if he had lived.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFREDERIC RICCI, the composer, lately died in the prime of life and\r\ntalent. He was stricken by apoplexy in the post-carriage between Warsaw\r\nand St. Petersburg. Ricci was the author of many operas, more successful\r\nin Italy than elsewhere, but whose names are well known to the musical\r\npublic every where. The _Prigioni d'Edimburgo_ is the most famous of his\r\noperas, among which _Rolla_, _Estella_, and _Griselda_ are not unknown.\r\nHis _Corrado d'Altamura_ failed in Paris in 1844. He had recently\r\nproduced at Venice _I due Ritratti_, an opera of which he composed both\r\nwords and music, and last May was summoned to Russia, under the especial\r\npatronage of Field Marshal Paskewitch, and saw before him the promise of\r\nthat brilliant career which the great wealth and cultivation of the\r\nRussian aristocracy secure to a few fortunate artists of every kind. On\r\nthe 2d December he wrote to the distinguished tenor, Moriani, that, for\r\nthe first time, fortune smiled upon him. He quotes from his own opera of\r\n_Rolla_, of which the tenor part was written for Moriani--\"_A nameless\r\nstone shall cover my grave_\"--smiles at the thought; says that it will\r\nbe his own fault if it is so, and within a few weeks reaches the scene\r\nof his anticipated triumphs, a corpse.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBARON D'OHSON, a distinguished oriental scholar of Sweden, died at\r\nStockholm early in January, at the age of seventy-two. He was of\r\nArmenian origin, and was born at Constantinople, November 26, 1779. His\r\nfather, Ignace Muradgi, the author of a work on Turkish history, was\r\nfirst dragoman of the Swedish embassy in that city. He was educated at\r\nParis, and among the manuscripts of the National Library, gathered the\r\nmaterial for two works published in French, which gained him an enviable\r\nreputation. One was _The Peoples of the Caucasus_, by Abdul-Cassim, the\r\ntraveller; the other _The History of Mongolia, from Dschingis Khan to\r\nTimour_; the second appeared at the Hague in 1835. M. D'Ohson served his\r\ncountry as ambassador for considerable periods at Vienna, Berlin, Paris,\r\nand London.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMRS. HARLOWE, at the advanced age of eighty-seven, expired at her\r\nlodgings at Gravesend, near London, on New-Year's-day. She was a very\r\npopular actress in her time, principally attached to Drury-Lane Theatre.\r\nMany years since she retired from the stage, and had since received a\r\npension from the Drury-Lane Fund, to which she was one of the original\r\nsubscribers. Her annuity for the first ten years amounted to £140 per\r\nannum, but since was reduced to £112, the claimants on the fund having\r\nconsiderably increased. Mrs. Harlowe was the last of the old school of\r\nactresses.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMr. ACHESON MAXWELL died in London, near the beginning of January, at\r\nthe advanced age of ninety-one. He was a very early friend of the late\r\nEarl of Macartney, under whom he held various confidential employments\r\nat Madras, in the memorable embassy to China, and at the Cape of Good\r\nHope. He also accompanied him in 1795, on a confidential mission to\r\nLouis XVIII., then residing at Verona. He afterward held for several\r\nyears a place in the office of the auditor of public accounts, but in\r\nhis last days he was in the enjoyment of a pension.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nLadies' Fashions for March.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere are apt to be few novelties in this part of the season. The modes\r\nfor the winter, with no important variations, generally prevail until\r\nthe beginning of the spring. Whatever changes occur are likely to be\r\nfound in details, or in articles of comparatively slight importance. In\r\nour next we shall probably be able to present the designs adopted by the\r\nfashionable worlds of Paris and London for the approaching warmer\r\nmonths.\r\n\r\nIn the above group we have a white double-breasted waistcoat, high\r\n_chemisette_ of lace, and collar of English embroidery; cap of silk\r\nstuff, forming a _calotte_, trimmed with lace of Alençon point; and\r\nribbon for the wrist. At the top of the first trimming is fastened a\r\nslight silk fringe under several bunches of silk or velvet ribbon. For\r\nindoors, and for dress parties, the lace lappets are replaced by ribbon\r\nlike the bunches. A little ribbon ornament is used round the gloves,\r\nfastened by a gold chain; and the ribbon is confined to the wrist by a\r\nsmall elastic cord.\r\n\r\nIn _head-dresses_, feathers form the most elegant and fashionable\r\ncoiffure for full evening dress. They should be mounted on a spring or\r\nwire, which passes over the upper part of the head, leaving the feathers\r\nto droop on each side. White ostrich feathers mounted in this style are\r\nfrequently tipped with gold or silver. An elegant fancy head-dress, is\r\ncomposed of feathers, blonde, and gold. On one side, a small tuft of\r\nwhite marabouts, intermingled with bunches of grapes in gold; on the\r\nother, instead of feathers, puffs of gold blonde, intermingled with\r\ngrapes--the back part of the coiffure of a small point or half\r\nhandkerchief of gold blonde, edged with gold fringe or passementerie.\r\nTime was, when a milliner would have made three separate head-dresses of\r\nmaterials composing the one here described; the feathers, the grapes,\r\nand the gold blonde would each have been separately employed, and it\r\nwould have been deemed impossible to venture on their combination. But\r\nsuch is the change in taste, that this head-dress is admitted to be one\r\nof the most becoming productions of the season. A wreath, in the style\r\ncalled the _guirlande pompadour_, is composed of roses of several shades\r\nof pink, fastened on one side by a bow of azure-blue ribbon, lamé with\r\nsilver--a bouquet of the same ribbon to fasten up the jupe of the dress,\r\nof white moire antique, trimmed with blonde. A head-dress, in the style\r\ncalled the coiffure Italleone, is of bows of cerulean blue velvet\r\nmingled with strings of pearls: on each side, ends of blue velvet edged\r\nwith aiguillettes of pearls. Pearls and beads of other kinds, especially\r\nthose of gold, silver, or coral, are very generally employed in\r\nornamenting head-dresses. They are twisted with bows of ribbon or\r\nvelvet, and are arranged in loops at each side. Loops of coral beads or\r\nof artificial Christmas berries, combined with bouquets of scarlet\r\ngeranium, have a pretty effect. Flowers are, as they always have been,\r\nand are likely to continue to be, the favorite coiffures for ball\r\ncostume. For young ladies, no other ornaments are admissible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn the first of the above figures we have an _Opera Dress_ of white\r\norgandi; the skirt extremely long and full, and with five flounces, each\r\nedged with two rows of narrow lace set on a little full; _Sortie de Bal_\r\nof white cashmere wadded throughout, and lined with satin, couleur de\r\nrose, the form loose, with extremely wide sleeves, and trimmed with\r\nvelvet the same color as the lining. When the hood is not drawn over the\r\nhead, the tasselled ends hang over it very gracefully, as in the costume\r\ngiven, tying, and preserving the throat from cold in passing to or from\r\nthe carriage. In the other figure is presented a walking dress of silver\r\ngray silk with a darker large plaid--skirt very full, and five flounces.\r\nAmong _Ball Dresses_ the Paris _Modes_ describes a robe of white tulle,\r\nwith three flounces, over a slip of white glacé--the flounces each edged\r\nwith a row of blonde of about a nail in width, and attached to the skirt\r\non one side by white roses, forming a sort of wreath at the upper part,\r\none end of which is attached to the waist, and descends to the first or\r\nuppermost flounce, the roses being of graduated sizes, enlarging from\r\nthe waist downward. A bouquet of white roses is attached to the second\r\nflounce. The corsage has a shawl berthe opening in a point in front of\r\nthe bosom. The berthe is formed of three falls of tulle, each edged with\r\na row of narrow blonde. The opening formed by the berthe in front of the\r\ncorsage is filled up by horizontal rows of blonde. The sleeves, which\r\nare extremely short, are covered by falls of tulle, edged with rows of\r\nblonde. The wreath on the head corresponds with the bouquets. It is very\r\nlight, with a bouquet on one side, where it is fixed, and is then\r\ntwisted round the plait, so as almost entirely to cover the back part of\r\nthe head-dress. On the arms, bracelets of gold and hair. Hand-bouquet of\r\nwhite and red roses.\r\n\r\n_Jewelry_ appears to be more in vogue than in recent years. Pins are\r\nextremely fashionable, and are made in the Italian style, with large\r\nheads, and pendent ornaments attached by small gold chains. Jewels,\r\nmounted for bandeaux or necklaces, are made to detach into separate\r\nportions, which may be worn as bracelets, pins for the hair, &c. In\r\nParis a book has appeared on the laws of taste applicable in the wearing\r\nof jewelry--a sort of Ethics of Taste in Stones, or Institutes of\r\nOrnament. It should by all means be translated.",
