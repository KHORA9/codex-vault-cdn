Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Handbook of Medical Entomology is the outgrowth of a course of\r\nlectures along the lines of insect transmission and dissemination of\r\ndiseases of man given by the senior author in the Department of\r\nEntomology of Cornell University during the past six years. More\r\nspecifically it is an illustrated revision and elaboration of his \"Notes\r\non the Relation of Insects to Disease\" published January, 1912.\r\n\r\nIts object is to afford a general survey of the field, and primarily to\r\nput the student of medicine and entomology in touch with the discoveries\r\nand theories which underlie some of the most important modern work in\r\npreventive medicine. At the same time the older phases of the\r\nsubject--the consideration of poisonous and parasitic forms--have not\r\nbeen ignored.\r\n\r\nConsidering the rapid shifts in viewpoint, and the development of the\r\nsubject within recent years, the authors do not indulge in any hopes\r\nthat the present text will exactly meet the needs of every one\r\nspecializing in the field,--still less do they regard it as complete or\r\nfinal. The fact that the enormous literature of isolated articles is to\r\nbe found principally in foreign periodicals and is therefore difficult\r\nof access to many American workers, has led the authors to hope that a\r\nsummary of the important advances, in the form of a reference book may\r\nnot prove unwelcome to physicians, sanitarians and working\r\nentomologists, and to teachers as a text supplementing lecture work in\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nLengthy as is the bibliography, it covers but a very small fraction of\r\nthe important contributions to the subject. It will serve only to put\r\nthose interested in touch with original sources and to open up the\r\nfield. Of the more general works, special acknowledgment should be made\r\nto those of Banks, Brumpt, Castellani and Chalmers, Comstock, Hewitt,\r\nHoward, Manson, Mense, Neveau-Lemaire, Nuttall, and Stiles.\r\n\r\nTo the many who have aided the authors in the years past, by suggestions\r\nand by sending specimens and other materials, sincerest thanks is\r\ntendered. This is especially due to their colleagues in the Department\r\nof Entomology of Cornell University, and to Professor Charles W. Howard,\r\nDr. John Uri Lloyd, Mr. A. H. Ritchie, Dr. I. M. Unger, and Dr. Luzerne\r\nCoville.\r\n\r\nThey wish to express indebtedness to the authors and publishers who have\r\nso willingly given permission to use certain illustrations. Especially\r\nis this acknowledgment due to Professor John Henry Comstock, Dr. L. O.\r\nHoward, Dr. Graham-Smith, and Professor G. H. T. Nuttall. Professor\r\nComstock not only authorized the use of departmental negatives by the\r\nlate Professor M. V. Slingerland (credited as M. V. S.), but generously\r\nput at their disposal the illustrations from the MANUAL FOR THE STUDY OF\r\nINSECTS and from the SPIDER BOOK. Figures 5 and 111 are from Peter's\r\n\"Der Arzt und die Heilkunst in der deutschen Vergangenheit.\" It should\r\nbe noted that on examining the original, it is found that Gottfried's\r\nfigure relates to an event antedating the typical epidemic of dancing\r\nmania.\r\n\r\n                                                  WM.

It is only within the past fifteen years that there has sprung\r\ninto prominence the knowledge that in another and much more insiduous\r\nmanner, they may be the enemy of mankind, that they may be among the\r\nmost important of the disseminators of disease. In this brief period,\r\nsuch knowledge has completely revolutionized our methods of control of\r\ncertain diseases, and has become an important weapon in the fight for\r\nthe conservation of health.\r\n\r\nIt is nowhere truer than in the case under consideration that however\r\nabrupt may be their coming into prominence, great movements and great\r\ndiscoveries do not arise suddenly. Centuries ago there was suggested the\r\npossibility that insects were concerned with the spread of disease, and\r\nfrom time to time there have appeared keen suggestions and logical\r\nhypotheses along this line, that lead us to marvel that the\r\nestablishment of the truths should have been so long delayed.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest of these references is by the Italian physician,\r\nMercurialis, who lived from 1530 to 1607, during a period when Europe\r\nwas being ravaged by the dread \"black death\", or plague. Concerning its\r\ntransmission he wrote: \"There can be no doubt that flies feed on the\r\ninternal secretions of the diseased and dying, then, flying away, they\r\ndeposit their excretions on the food in neighboring dwellings, and\r\npersons who eat of it are thus infected.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to formulate more clearly this aspect of the facts\r\nas we know them to-day, though it must always be borne in mind that we\r\nare prone to interpret such statements in the light of present-day\r\nknowledge. Mercurialis had no conception of the animate nature of\r\ncontagion, and his statement was little more than a lucky guess.\r\n\r\nMuch more worthy of consideration is the approval which was given to his\r\nview by the German Jesuit, Athanasius Kircher in 1658. One cannot read\r\ncarefully his works without believing that long before Leeuwenhook's\r\ndiscovery, Kircher had seen the larger species of bacteria. Moreover, he\r\nattributed the production of disease to these organisms and formulated,\r\nvaguely, to be sure, a theory of the animate nature of contagion. It has\r\ntaken two and a half centuries to accumulate the facts to prove his\r\nhypothesis.\r\n\r\nThe theory of Mercurialis was not wholly lost sight of, for in the\r\nmedical literature of the eighteenth century there are scattered\r\nreferences to flies as carriers of disease. Such a view seems even to\r\nhave been more or less popularly accepted, in some cases. Gudger (1910),\r\nhas pointed out that, as far back as 1769, Edward Bancroft, in \"An Essay\r\non the Natural History of Guiana in South America,\" wrote concerning the\r\ncontagious skin-disease known as \"Yaws\": \"It is usually believed that\r\nthis disorder is communicated by the flies who have been feasting on a\r\ndiseased object, to those persons who have sores, or scratches, which\r\nare uncovered; and from many observations, I think this is not\r\nimprobable, as none ever receive this disorder whose skins are whole.\"\r\n\r\nApproaching more closely the present epoch, we find that in 1848, Dr.\r\nJosiah Nott, of Mobile, Alabama, published a remarkable article on the\r\ncause of yellow fever, in which he presented \"reasons for supposing its\r\nspecific cause to exist in some form of insect life.\" As a matter of\r\nfact, the bearing of Nott's work on present day ideas of the insect\r\ntransmission of disease has been very curiously overrated. The common\r\ninterpretation of his theory has been deduced from a few isolated\r\nsentences, but his argument appears quite differently when the entire\r\narticle is studied. It must be remembered that he wrote at a period\r\nbefore the epoch-making discoveries of Pasteur and before the\r\nrecognition of micro-organisms as factors in the cause of disease. His\r\narticle is a masterly refutation of the theory of \"malarial\" origin of\r\n\"all the fevers of hot climates,\" but he uses the term \"insect\" as\r\napplicable to the lower forms of life, and specific references to\r\n\"mosquitoes,\" \"aphids,\" \"cotton-worms,\" and others, are merely in the\r\nway of similes.\r\n\r\nBut, while Nott's ideas regarding the relation of insects to yellow\r\nfever were vague and indefinite, it was almost contemporaneously that\r\nthe French physician, Louis Daniel Beauperthuy argued in the most\r\nexplicit possible manner, that yellow fever and various others are\r\ntransmitted by mosquitoes. In the light of the data which were available\r\nwhen he wrote, in 1853, it is not surprising that he erred by thinking\r\nthat the source of the virus was decomposing matter which the mosquito\r\ntook up and accidentally inoculated into man. Beauperthuy not only\r\ndiscussed the role of mosquitoes in the transmission of disease, but he\r\ntaught, less clearly, that house-flies scatter pathogenic organisms. It\r\nseems that Boyce (1909) who quotes extensively from this pioneer work,\r\ndoes not go too far when he says \"It is Dr. Beauperthuy whom we must\r\nregard as the father of the doctrine of insect-borne disease.\"\r\n\r\nIn this connection, mention must be made of the scholarly article by the\r\nAmerican physician, A. F. A. King who, in 1883, brought together an all\r\nbut conclusive mass of argument in support of his belief that malaria\r\nwas caused by mosquitoes. At about the same time, Finley, of Havana, was\r\nforcefully presenting his view that the mosquito played the chief role\r\nin the spread of yellow fever.\r\n\r\nTo enter more fully into the general historical discussion is beyond the\r\nscope of this book. We shall have occasion to make more explicit\r\nreferences in considering various insect-borne diseases. Enough has been\r\nsaid here to emphasize that the recognition of insects as factors in the\r\nspread of disease was long presaged, and that there were not wanting\r\nkeen thinkers who, with a background of present-day conceptions of the\r\nnature of disease, might have been in the front rank of investigators\r\nalong these lines.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WAYS IN WHICH ARTHROPODS MAY AFFECT THE HEALTH OF MAN\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the ways in which insects and their allies may affect\r\nthe health of man, we find that we may treat them under three main\r\ngroups:\r\n\r\nA. They may be directly poisonous. Such, for example, are the scorpions,\r\ncertain spiders and mites, some of the predaceous bugs, and stinging\r\ninsects. Even such forms as the mosquito deserve some consideration from\r\nthis viewpoint.\r\n\r\nB. They may be parasitic, living more or less permanently on or in the\r\nbody and deriving their sustenance from it.\r\n\r\nOf the parasitic arthropods we may distinguish, first, the _true\r\nparasites_, those which have adopted and become confirmed in the\r\nparasitic habit. Such are the itch mites, the lice, fleas, and the\r\nmajority of the forms to be considered as parasitic.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these, we may distinguish a group of _accidental_, or\r\n_facultative parasites_, species which are normally free-living, feeding\r\non decaying substances, but which when accidentally introduced into the\r\nalimentary canal or other cavities of man, may exist there for a greater\r\nor less period. For example, certain fly larvae, or maggots, normally\r\nfeeding in putrifying meat, have been known to occur as accidental or\r\nfacultative parasites in the stomach of man.\r\n\r\nC. Finally, and most important, arthropods may be transmitters and\r\ndisseminators of disease. In this capacity they may function in one of\r\nthree ways; as _simple carriers_, as _direct inoculators_, or as\r\n_essential hosts_ of disease germs.\r\n\r\nAs simple carriers, they may, in a wholly incidental manner, transport\r\nfrom the diseased to the healthy, or from filth to food, pathogenic\r\ngerms which cling to their bodies or appendages. Such, for instance, is\r\nthe relation of the house-fly to the dissemination of typhoid.\r\n\r\nAs direct inoculators, biting or piercing species may take up from a\r\ndiseased man or animal, germs which, clinging to the mouth parts, are\r\ninoculated directly into the blood of the insect's next victim. It it\r\nthus that horse-flies may occasionally transmit anthrax. Similarly,\r\nspecies of spiders and other forms which are ordinarily perfectly\r\nharmless, may accidentally convey and inoculate pyogenic bacteria.\r\n\r\nIt is as essential hosts of disease germs that arthropods play their\r\nmost important role. In such cases an essential part of the life cycle\r\nof the pathogenic organism is undergone in the insect. In other words,\r\nwithout the arthropod host the disease-producing organism cannot\r\ncomplete its development. As illustrations may be cited the relation of\r\nthe Anopheles mosquito to the malarial parasite, and the relation of the\r\ncattle tick to Texas fever.\r\n\r\nA little consideration will show that this is the most important of the\r\ngroup. Typhoid fever is carried by water or by contaminated milk, and in\r\nvarious other ways, as well as by the house-fly. Kill all the\r\nhouse-flies and typhoid would still exist. On the other hand, malaria is\r\ncarried only by the mosquito, because an essential part of the\r\ndevelopment of the malarial parasite is undergone in this insect.\r\nExterminate all of the mosquitoes of certain species and the\r\ndissemination of human malaria is absolutely prevented.\r\n\r\nOnce an arthropod becomes an essential host for a given parasite it may\r\ndisseminate infection in three different ways:\r\n\r\n1. By infecting man or animals who ingest it. It is thus, for example,\r\nthat man, dog, or cat, becomes infected with the double-pored dog\r\ntapeworm, _Dipylidium caninum_. The cysticercoid stage occurs in the\r\ndog louse, or in the dog or cat fleas, and by accidentally ingesting the\r\ninfested insect the vertebrate becomes infested. Similarly, _Hymenolepis\r\ndiminuta_, a common tapeworm of rats and mice, and occasional in man,\r\nundergoes part of its life cycle in various meal-infesting insects, and\r\nis accidentally taken up by its definitive host. It is very probable\r\nthat man becomes infested with _Dracunculus (Filaria) medinensis_\r\nthrough swallowing in drinking water, the crustacean, _Cyclops_,\r\ncontaining the larvae of this worm.\r\n\r\n2. By infecting man or animals on whose skin or mucous membranes the\r\ninsect host may be crushed or may deposit its excrement. The pathogenic\r\norganism may then actively penetrate, or may be inoculated by\r\nscratching. The causative organism of typhus fever is thus transmitted\r\nby the body louse.\r\n\r\n3. By direct inoculation by its bite, the insect host may transfer the\r\nparasite which has undergone development within it. The malarial\r\nparasite is thus transferred by mosquitoes; the Texas fever parasite by\r\ncattle ticks.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nARTHROPODS WHICH ARE DIRECTLY POISONOUS\r\n\r\n\r\nOf all the myriads of insects and related forms, a very few are of\r\ndirect use to man, some few others have forced his approbation on\r\naccount of their wonderful beauty, but the great hordes of them are\r\nloathed or regarded as directly dangerous. As a matter of fact, only a\r\nvery small number are in the slightest degree poisonous to man or to the\r\nhigher animals. The result is that entomologists and lovers of nature,\r\nintent upon dissipating the foolish dread of insects, are sometimes\r\ninclined to go to the extreme of discrediting all statements of serious\r\ninjury from the bites or stings of any species.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it must not be overlooked that poisonous forms do exist,\r\nand they must receive attention in a consideration of the ways in which\r\narthropods may affect the health of man. Moreover, it must be recognized\r\nthat \"what is one man's meat, is another man's poison,\" and that in\r\nconsidering the possibilities of injury we must not ignore individual\r\nidiosyncrasies. Just as certain individuals may be poisoned by what, for\r\nothers, are common articles of food, so some persons may be abnormally\r\nsusceptible to insect poison. Thus, the poison of a bee sting may be of\r\nvarying severity, but there are individuals who are made seriously sick\r\nby a single sting, regardless of the point of entry. Some individuals\r\nscarcely notice a mosquito bite, others find it very painful, and so\r\nillustrations of this difference in individuals might be multiplied.\r\n\r\nIn considering the poisonous arthropods, we shall take them up by\r\ngroups. The reader who is unacquainted with the systematic relationship\r\nof insects and their allies is referred to Chapter XII. No attempt will\r\nbe made to make the lists under the various headings exhaustive, but\r\ntypical forms will be discussed.\r\n\r\n\r\nARANEIDA OR SPIDERS\r\n\r\nOf all the arthropods there are none which are more universally feared\r\nthan are the spiders. It is commonly supposed that the majority, if not\r\nall the species are poisonous and that they are aggressive enemies of\r\nman and the higher animals, as well as of lower forms.\r\n\r\nThat they really secrete a poison may be readily inferred from the\r\neffect of their bite upon insects and other small forms. Moreover, the\r\npresence of definite and well-developed poison glands can easily be\r\nshown. They occur as a pair of pouches (fig. 1) lying within the\r\ncephalothorax and connected by a delicate duct with a pore on the claw\r\nof the chelicera, or so-called \"mandible\" on the convex surface of the\r\nclaw in such a position that it is not plugged and closed by the flesh\r\nof the victim.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 1. Head of a spider showing poison gland (_c_) and its\r\nrelation to the chelicera (_a_).]\r\n\r\nThe glands may be demonstrated by slowly and carefully twisting off a\r\nchelicera and pushing aside the stumps of muscles at its base. By\r\nexercising care, the chitinous wall of the chelicera and its claw may be\r\nbroken away and the duct traced from the gland to its outlet. The inner\r\nlining of the sac is constituted by a highly developed glandular\r\nepithelium, supported by a basement membrane of connective tissue and\r\ncovered by a muscular layer, (fig. 2). The muscles, which are striated,\r\nare spirally arranged (fig. 1), and are doubtless under control of the\r\nspider, so that the amount of poison to be injected into a wound may be\r\nvaried.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 2. Section through a venom gland of Latrodectus\r\n13-guttatus showing the peritoneal, muscular and epithelial layers.\r\nAfter Bordas.]\r\n\r\nThe poison itself, according to Kobert (1901), is a clear, colorless\r\nfluid, of oily consistency, acid reaction, and very bitter taste. After\r\nthe spider has bitten two or three times, its supply is exhausted and\r\ntherefore, as in the case of snakes, the poison of the bite decreases\r\nquickly with use, until it is null. To what extent the content of the\r\npoison sacs may contain blood serum or, at least, active principles of\r\nserum, in addition to a specific poison formed by the poison glands\r\nthemselves, Kobert regards as an open question. He believes that the\r\nacid part of the poison, if really present, is formed by the glands and\r\nthat, in the case of some spiders, the ferment-like, or better, active\r\ntoxine, comes from the blood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 3. Chelicera of a spider.]\r\n\r\nBut there is a wide difference between a poison which may kill an insect\r\nand one which is harmful to men. Certain it is that there is no lack of\r\npopular belief and newspaper records of fatal cases, but the evidence\r\nregarding the possibility of fatal or even very serious results for man\r\nis most contradictory. For some years, we have attempted to trace the\r\nmore circumstantial newspaper accounts, which have come to our notice,\r\nof injury by North American species. The results have served, mainly, to\r\nemphasize the straits to which reporters are sometimes driven when there\r\nis a dearth of news. The accounts are usually vague and lacking in any\r\ndefinite clue for locating the supposed victim. In the comparatively few\r\ncases where the patient, or his physician, could be located, there was\r\neither no claim that the injury was due to spider venom, or there was no\r\nevidence to support the belief. Rarely, there was evidence that a\r\nsecondary blood poisoning, such as might be brought about by the prick\r\nof a pin, or by any mechanical injury, had followed the bite of a\r\nspider. Such instances have no bearing on the question of the venomous\r\nnature of these forms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 4. The Italian tarantula (Lycosa tarantula). After\r\nKobert.]\r\n\r\nThe extreme to which unreasonable fear of the bites of spiders\r\ninfluenced the popular mind was evidenced by the accepted explanation of\r\nthe remarkable dancing mania, or tarantism, of Italy during the Middle\r\nAges. This was a nervous disorder, supposed to be due to the bite of a\r\nspider, the European tarantula (fig. 4), though it was also, at times,\r\nattributed to the bite of the scorpion. In its typical form, it was\r\ncharacterized by so great a sensibility to music that under its\r\ninfluence the victims indulged in the wildest and most frenzied dancing,\r\nuntil they sank to the ground utterly exhausted and almost lifeless. The\r\nprofuse perspiring resulting from these exertions was supposed to be the\r\nonly efficacious remedy for the disease. Certain forms of music were\r\nregarded as of especial value in treating this tarantism, and hence the\r\nname of \"tarantella\" was applied to them. Our frontispiece, taken from\r\nAthanasius Kircher's _Magnes sive de Arte Magnetica_, 1643 ed.,\r\nrepresents the most commonly implicated spider and illustrates some of\r\nwhat Fabre has aptly designated as \"medical choreography.\"\r\n\r\nThe disease was, in reality, a form of hysteria, spreading by sympathy\r\nuntil whole communities were involved, and was paralleled by the\r\noutbreaks of the so-called St. Vitus's or St. John's dance, which swept\r\nGermany at about the same time (fig. 5). The evidence that the spider\r\nwas the cause of the first is about as conclusive as is that of the\r\ndemoniacal origin of the latter. The true explanation of the outbreaks\r\nis doubtless to be found in the depleted physical and mental condition\r\nof the people, resulting from the wars and the frightful plagues which\r\ndevastated all Europe previous to, and during these times. An\r\ninteresting discussion of these aspects of the question is to be found\r\nin Hecker.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 5. Dancing mania. Illustration from Johann Ludwig\r\nGottfried's Chronik. 1632.]\r\n\r\nSo gross has been the exaggeration and so baseless the popular fear\r\nregarding spiders that entomologists have been inclined to discredit all\r\naccounts of serious injury from their bites. Not only have the most\r\ncircumstantial of newspaper accounts proved to be without foundation but\r\nthere are on record a number of cases where the bite of many of the\r\ncommoner species have been intentionally provoked and where the effect\r\nhas been insignificant. Some years ago the senior author personally\r\nexperimented with a number of the largest of our northern species, and\r\nwith unexpected results. The first surprise was that the spiders were\r\nvery unwilling to bite and that it required a considerable effort to get\r\nthem to attempt to do so. In the second place, most of those\r\nexperimented with were unable to pierce the skin of the palm or the back\r\nof the hand, but had to be applied to the thin skin between the fingers\r\nbefore they were able to draw blood. Unfortunately, no special attempt\r\nwas made to determine, at the time, the species experimented with, but\r\namong them were _Theridion tepidariorum_, _Miranda aurantia_\r\n(_Argiopa_), _Metargiope trifasciata_, _Marxia stellata_, _Aranea\r\ntrifolium_, _Misumena vatia_, and _Agelena naevia_. In no case was the\r\nbite more severe than a pin prick and though in some cases the sensation\r\nseemed to last longer, it was probably due to the fact that the mind was\r\nintent upon the experiment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 6. An American tarantula (Eurypelma hentzii). Natural\r\nsize. After Comstock.]\r\n\r\nSimilar experiments were carried out by Blackwell (1855), who believed\r\nthat in the case of insects bitten, death did not result any more\r\npromptly than it would have from a purely mechanical injury of equal\r\nextent. He was inclined to regard all accounts of serious injury to man\r\nas baseless. The question cannot be so summarily dismissed, and we shall\r\nnow consider some of the groups which have been more explicitly\r\nimplicated.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TARANTULAS.--In popular usage, the term \"tarantula\" is loosely\r\napplied to any one of a number of large spiders. The famous tarantulas\r\nof southern Europe, whose bites were supposed to cause the dancing\r\nmania, were Lycosidae, or wolf-spiders. Though various species of this\r\ngroup were doubtless so designated, the one which seems to have been\r\nmost implicated was _Lycosa tarantula_ (L.), (fig. 4). On the other\r\nhand, in this country, though there are many Lycosidae, the term\r\n\"tarantula\" has been applied to members of the superfamily Avicularoidea\r\n(fig. 6), including the bird-spiders.\r\n\r\nOf the Old World Lycosidae there is no doubt that several species were\r\nimplicated as the supposed cause of the tarantism. In fact, as we have\r\nalready noted, the blame was sometimes attached to a scorpion. However,\r\nthere seems to be no doubt that most of the accounts refer to the spider\r\nknown as _Lycosa tarantula_.\r\n\r\nThere is no need to enter into further details here regarding the\r\nsupposed virulence of these forms, popular and the older medical\r\nliterature abound in circumstantial accounts of the terrible effects of\r\nthe bite. Fortunately, there is direct experimental evidence which bears\r\non the question.\r\n\r\nFabre induced a common south European wolf-spider, _Lycosa narbonensis_,\r\nto bite the leg of a young sparrow, ready to leave the nest. The leg\r\nseemed paralyzed as a result of the bite, and though the bird seemed\r\nlively and clamored for food the next day, on the third day it died. A\r\nmole, bitten on the nose, succumbed after thirty-six hours. From these\r\nexperiments Fabre seemed justified in his conclusion that the bite of\r\nthis spider is not an accident which man can afford to treat lightly.\r\nUnfortunately, there is nothing in the experiments, or in the symptoms\r\ndetailed, to exclude the probability that the death of the animals was\r\nthe result of secondary infection.\r\n\r\nAs far back as 1693, as we learn from the valuable account of Kobert,\r\n(1901), the Italian physician, Sanguinetti allowed himself to be bitten\r\non the arm by two tarantulas, in the presence of witnesses. The\r\nsensation was equivalent to that from an ant or a mosquito bite and\r\nthere were no other phenomena the first day. On the second day the wound\r\nwas inflamed and there was slight ulceration. It is clear that these\r\nlater symptoms were due to a secondary infection. These experiments have\r\nbeen repeated by various observers, among whom may be mentioned Leon\r\nDufour, Josef Erker and Heinzel, and with the similar conclusion that\r\nthe bite of the Italian tarantula ordinarily causes no severe symptoms.\r\nIn this conclusion, Kobert, though firmly convinced of the poisonous\r\nnature of some spiders, coincides. He also believes that striking\r\nsymptoms may be simulated or artificially induced by patients in order\r\nto attract interest, or because they have been assured that the bite,\r\nunder all circumstances, caused tarantism.\r\n\r\nThe so-called Russian tarantula, _Trochosa singoriensis_ (fig. 7), is\r\nmuch larger than the Italian species, and is much feared. Kobert carried\r\nout a series of careful experiments with this species and his results\r\nhave such an important bearing on the question of the venomous nature of\r\nthe tarantula that we quote his summary. Experimenting first on nearly a\r\nhundred living specimens of _Trochosa singoriensis_ from Crimea he says\r\nthat:\r\n\r\n\"The tarantulas, no matter how often they were placed on the skin,\r\nhandled, and irritated, could not be induced to bite either myself, the\r\njanitor, or the ordinary experimental animals. The objection that the\r\ntarantulas were weak and indifferent cannot stand, for as soon as I\r\nplaced two of them on the shaved skin of a rabbit, instead of an attack\r\non the animal, there began a furious battle between the two spiders,\r\nwhich did not cease until one of the two was killed.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 7. Trochosa singoriensis. After Kobert.]\r\n\r\n\"Since the spiders would not bite, I carefully ground up the fresh\r\nanimals in physiological salt solution, preparing an extract which must\r\nhave contained, in solution, all of the poisonous substance of their\r\nbodies. While in the case of _Latrodectus_, as we shall see, less than\r\none specimen sufficed to yield an active extract, I have injected the\r\nfiltered extract of six fresh Russian tarantulas, of which each one was\r\nmuch heavier than an average _Latrodectus_, subcutaneously and into the\r\njugular vein of various cats without the animals dying or showing any\r\nspecial symptoms. On the basis of my experiments I can therefore only\r\nsay that the quantity of the poison soluble in physiological salt\r\nsolution, even when the spiders are perfectly fresh and well nourished,\r\nis very insignificant. That the poison of the Russian tarantula is not\r\nsoluble in physiological salt solution, is exceedingly improbable.\r\nMoreover, I have prepared alcoholic extracts and was unable to find them\r\nactive. Since the Russian spider exceeds the Italian in size and in\r\nintensity of the bite, it seems very improbable to me that the\r\npharmacological test of the Italian tarantula would yield essentially\r\nother results than those from the Russian species.\"\r\n\r\nTo the AVICULAROIDEA belong the largest and most formidable appearing of\r\nthe spiders and it is not strange that in the New World they have fallen\r\nheir to the bad reputation, as well as to the name of the tarantula of\r\nEurope. In this country they occur only in the South or in the far West,\r\nbut occasionally living specimens are brought to our northern ports in\r\nshipments of bananas and other tropical produce, and are the source of\r\nmuch alarm. It should be mentioned, however, that the large spider most\r\nfrequently found under such circumstances is not a tarantula at all, but\r\none of the Heteropodidae, or giant crab-spiders, (fig. 8).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 8. The giant crab-spider or banana spider (Heteropoda\r\nvenatoria). Natural size. After Comstock.]\r\n\r\nIn spite of their prominence and the fear which they arouse there are\r\nfew accurate data regarding these American tarantulas. It has often been\r\nshown experimentally that they can kill small birds and mammals, though\r\nit is doubtful if these form the normal prey of any of the species, as\r\nhas been claimed. There is no question but that the mere mechanical\r\ninjury which they may inflict, and the consequent chances of secondary\r\ninfection, justify, in part, their bad reputation. In addition to the\r\ninjury from their bite, it is claimed that the body hairs of several of\r\nthe South American species are readily detached and are urticating.\r\n\r\nRecently, Phisalix (1912) has made a study of the physiological effects\r\nof the venom of two Avicularoidea, _Phormictopus carcerides_ Pocock,\r\nfrom Haiti and _Cteniza sauvagei_ Rossi, from Corsica. The glands were\r\nremoved aseptically and ground up with fine, sterilized sand in\r\ndistilled water. The resultant liquid was somewhat viscid, colorless,\r\nand feebly alkaline. Injected into sparrows and mice the extract of\r\n_Phormictopus_ proved very actively poisonous, that from a single spider\r\nbeing sufficient to kill ten sparrows or twenty mice. It manifested\r\nitself first and, above all, as a narcotic, slightly lowering the\r\ntemperature and paralyzing the respiration. Muscular and cardiac\r\nweakening, loss of general sensibility, and the disappearance of\r\nreflexes did not occur until near the end. The extract from _Cteniza_\r\nwas less active and, curiously enough, the comparative effect on\r\nsparrows and on mice was just reversed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPIDERS OF THE GENUS LATRODECTUS.--While most of the popular accounts of\r\nevil effects from the bites of spiders will not stand investigation, it\r\nis a significant fact that, the world over, the best authenticated\r\nrecords refer to a group of small and comparatively insignificant\r\nspiders belonging to the genus _Latrodectus_, of the family Theridiidae.\r\nThe dread \"Malmigniatte\" of Corsica and South Europe, the \"Karakurte\" of\r\nsoutheastern Russia, the \"Katipo\" of New Zealand, the \"Mena-vodi\" and\r\n\"Vancoho\" of Madagascar, and our own _Latrodectus mactans_, all belong\r\nto this genus, and concerning all of these the most circumstantial\r\naccounts of their venomous nature are given. These accounts are not mere\r\nfantastic stories by uneducated natives but in many cases are reports\r\nfrom thoroughly trained medical men.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms produced are general, rather than local. As summarized by\r\nKobert (1901) from a study of twenty-two cases treated in 1888, in the\r\nKherson (Russia) Government Hospital and Berislaw (Kherson) District\r\nHospital the typical case, aside from complications, exhibits the\r\nfollowing symptoms. The victim suddenly feels the bite, like the sting\r\nof a bee. Swelling of the barely reddened spot seldom follows. The\r\nshooting pains, which quickly set in, are not manifested at the point of\r\ninjury but localized at the joints of the lower limb and in the region\r\nof the hip. The severity of the pain forces the victim to the hospital,\r\nin spite of the fact that they otherwise have a great abhorrence of it.\r\nThe patient is unable to reach the hospital afoot, or, at least, not\r\nwithout help, for there is usually inability to walk. The patient, even\r\nif he has ridden, reaches the hospital covered with cold sweat and\r\ncontinues to perspire for a considerable period. His expression\r\nindicates great suffering. The respiration may be somewhat dyspnoeic,\r\nand a feeling of oppression in the region of the heart is common. There\r\nis great aversion to solid food, but increasing thirst for milk and tea.\r\nRetention of urine, and constipation occur. Cathartics and, at night,\r\nstrong narcotics are desired. Warm baths give great relief. After three\r\ndays, there is marked improvement and usually the patient is dismissed\r\nafter the fifth. This summary of symptoms agrees well with other\r\ntrustworthy records.\r\n\r\nIt would seem, then, that Riley and Howard (1889), who discussed a\r\nnumber of accounts in the entomological literature, were fully justified\r\nin their statement that \"It must be admitted that certain spiders of the\r\ngenus _Latrodectus_ have the power to inflict poisonous bites, which may\r\n(probably exceptionally and depending upon exceptional conditions) bring\r\nabout the death of a human being.\"\r\n\r\nAnd yet, until recently the evidence bearing on the question has been\r\nmost conflicting. The eminent arachnologist, Lucas, (1843) states that\r\nhe himself, had been repeatedly bitten by the Malmigniatte without any\r\nbad effects. Dr. Marx, in 1890, gave before the Entomological Society of\r\nWashington, an account of a series of experiments to determine whether\r\nthe bite of _Latrodectus mactans_ is poisonous or not. He described the\r\npoison glands as remarkably small[A] and stated that he had introduced\r\nthe poison in various ways into guinea-pigs and rabbits without\r\nobtaining any satisfactory results. Obviously, carefully conducted\r\nexperiments with the supposed venom were needed and fortunately they\r\nhave been carried out in the greatest detail by Kobert (1901).\r\n\r\nThis investigator pointed out that there were two factors which might\r\naccount for the discrepancies in the earlier experiments. In the first\r\nplace, the poison of spiders, as of snakes, might be so exhausted after\r\ntwo or three bites that further bites, following directly, might be\r\nwithout visible effect. Secondly, the application of the poison by means\r\nof the bite, is exceedingly inexact, since even after the most careful\r\nselection of the point of application, the poison might in one instance\r\nenter a little vein or lymph vessel, and in another case fail to do so.\r\nBesides, there would always remain an incalculable and very large amount\r\nexternally, in the nonabsorptive epithelium. While all of these factors\r\nenter into the question of the effect of the bite in specific instances,\r\nthey must be as nearly as possible obviated in considering the question\r\nof whether the spiders really secrete a venom harmful to man.\r\n\r\nKobert therefore sought to prepare extracts which would contain the\r\nactive principles of the poison and which could be injected in definite\r\nquantities directly into the blood of the experimental animal. For this\r\npurpose various parts of the spiders were rubbed up in a mortar with\r\ndistilled water, or physiological salt solution, allowed to stand for an\r\nhour, filtered, and then carefully washed, by adding water drop by drop\r\nfor twenty-four hours. The filtrate and the wash-water were then united,\r\nwell mixed and, if necessary, cleared by centrifuging or by exposure to\r\ncold. The mixture was again filtered, measured, and used, in part, for\r\ninjection and, in part, for the determination of the organic materials.\r\n\r\nSuch an extract was prepared from the cephalothoraces of eight dried\r\nspecimens of the Russian _Latrodectus_ and three cubic centimeters of\r\nthis, containing 4.29 mg. of organic material, were injected into the\r\njugular vein of a cat weighing 2450 grams. The previously very active\r\nanimal was paralyzed and lay in whatever position it was placed. The\r\nsensibility of the skin of the extremities and the rump was so reduced\r\nthat there was no reaction from cutting or sticking. There quickly\r\nfollowed dyspnoea, convulsions, paralysis of the respiratory muscles\r\nand of the heart. In twenty-eight minutes the cat was dead, after having\r\nexhibited exactly the symptoms observed in severe cases of poisoning of\r\nman from the bite of this spider.\r\n\r\nThese experiments were continued on cats, dogs, guinea pigs and various\r\nother animals. Not only extracts from the cephalothorax, but from other\r\nparts of the body, from newly hatched spiders, and from the eggs were\r\nused and all showed a similar virulence. Every effort was made to avoid\r\nsources of error and the experiments, conducted by such a recognized\r\nauthority in the field of toxicology, must be accepted as conclusively\r\nshowing that this spider and, presumably, other species of the genus\r\n_Latrodectus_ against which the clinical evidence is quite parallel,\r\npossess a poison which paralyzes the heart and central nervous system,\r\nwith or without preliminary stimulus of the motor center. If the\r\nquantity of the poison which comes into direct contact with the blood is\r\nlarge, there may occur haemolysis and thrombosis of the vessels.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, check experiments were carried out, using similar\r\nextracts of many common European spiders of the genera _Tegenaria_,\r\n_Drassus_, _Agelena_, _Eucharia_ and _Argyroneta_, as well as the\r\nRussian tarantula, _Lycosa singoriensis_. In no other case was the\r\neffect on experimental animals comparable to the _Latrodectus_ extract.\r\n\r\nKobert concludes that in its chemical nature the poison is neither an\r\nalkaloid, nor a glycoside, nor an acid, but a toxalbumen, or poisonous\r\nenzyme which is very similar to certain other animal poisons, notably\r\nthat of the scorpion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 9. Latrodectus mactans; (_a_) female, x3; (_b_) venter\r\nof female; (_c_) dorsum of male. After Comstock.]\r\n\r\nThe genus _Latrodectus_ is represented in the United States by at least\r\ntwo species, _L. mactans_ and _L. geometricus_. Concerning _L. mactans_\r\nthere are very circumstantial accounts of serious injury and even death\r\nin man[B]. _Latrodectus mactans_ is coal black, marked with red or\r\nyellow or both. It has eight eyes, which are dissimilar in color and\r\nare distinctly in front of the middle of the thorax, the lateral eyes of\r\neach side widely separate. The tarsus of the fourth pair of legs has a\r\nnumber of curved setae in a single series. It has on the ventral side of\r\nits abdomen an hour-glass shaped spot. The full-grown female is about\r\nhalf an inch in length. Its globose abdomen is usually marked with one\r\nor more red spots dorsally along the middle line. The male is about half\r\nas long but has in addition to the dorsal spots, four pairs of stripes\r\nalong the sides. Immature females resemble the male in coloring (fig.\r\n9).\r\n\r\nRegarding the distribution of _Latrodectus mactans_, Comstock states\r\nthat: \"Although it is essentially a Southern species, it occurs in\r\nIndiana, Ohio, Pennsylvania, New Hampshire, and doubtless other of the\r\nNorthern States.\" _L. geometricus_ has been reported from California.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER VENOMOUS SPIDERS--While conclusive evidence regarding the venomous\r\nnature of spiders is meager and relates almost wholly to that of the\r\ngenus _Latrodectus_, the group is a large one and we are not justified\r\nin dismissing arbitrarily, all accounts of injury from their bites.\r\nSeveral species stand out as especially needing more detailed\r\ninvestigation.\r\n\r\n_Chiracanthium nutrix_ is a common European species of the family\r\nClubionidae, concerning which there is much conflicting testimony. Among\r\nthe reports are two by distinguished scientists whose accounts of\r\npersonal experiences cannot be ignored. A. Forel allowed a spider of\r\nthis species to bite him and not only was the pain extreme, but the\r\ngeneral symptoms were so severe that he had to be helped to his house.\r\nThe distinguished arachnologist, Bertkau reports that he, himself, was\r\nbitten and that an extreme, burning pain spread almost instantaneously\r\nover the arm and into the breast. There were slight chills the same day\r\nand throbbing pain at the wound lasted for days. While this particular\r\nspecies is not found in the United States, there are two other\r\nrepresentatives of the genus and it is possible that they possess the\r\nsame properties. We are unaware of any direct experimental work on the\r\npoison.\r\n\r\n_Epeira diadema_, of Europe, belongs to a wholly different group, that\r\nof the orb-weavers, but has long been reputed venomous. Kobert was able\r\nto prepare from it an extract whose effects were very similar to that\r\nprepared from _Latrodectus_, though feebler in its action. Under\r\nordinary circumstances this spider is unable to pierce the skin of man\r\nand though Kobert's results seem conclusive, the spider is little to be\r\nfeared.\r\n\r\n_Phidippus audax_ (_P. tripunctatus_) is one of our largest Attids, or\r\njumping spiders. The late Dr. O. Lugger describes a case of severe\r\npoisoning from the bite of this spider and though details are lacking,\r\nit is quite possible that this and other large species of the same\r\ngroup, which stalk their prey, may possess a more active poison than\r\nthat of web-building species.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY--It is clearly established that our common spiders are not to be\r\nfeared and that the stories regarding their virulence are almost wholly\r\nwithout foundation. On the other hand, the chances of secondary\r\ninfection from the bites of some of the more powerful species are not to\r\nbe ignored.\r\n\r\nProbably all species possess a toxin secreted by the poison gland,\r\nvirulent for insects and other normal prey of the spiders, but with\r\nlittle or no effect on man.\r\n\r\nThere are a very few species, notably of the genus _Latrodectus_, and\r\npossibly including the European _Chiracanthium nutrix_ and _Epeira\r\ndiadema_, which possess, in addition, a toxalbumen derived from the\r\ngeneral body tissue, which is of great virulence and may even cause\r\ndeath in man and the higher animals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 10. A whip-scorpion (Mastigoproctus giganteus). Half\r\nnatural size. After Comstock.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PEDIPALPIDA OR WHIP-SCORPIONS\r\n\r\nThe tailed whip-scorpions, belonging to the family Thelyphonidae, are\r\nrepresented in the United States by the giant whip-scorpion\r\n_Mastigoproctus giganteus_ (fig. 10), which is common in Florida, Texas\r\nand some other parts of the South. In Florida, it is locally known as\r\nthe \"grampus\" or \"mule-killer\" and is very greatly feared. There is no\r\nevidence that these fears have any foundation, and Dr. Marx states that\r\nthere is neither a poison gland nor a pore in the claw of the\r\nchelicera.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SCORPIONIDA, OR TRUE SCORPIONS\r\n\r\nThe true scorpions are widely distributed throughout warm countries and\r\neverywhere bear an evil reputation. According to Comstock (1912), about\r\na score of species occur in the Southern United States. These are\r\ncomparatively small forms but in the tropics members of this group may\r\nreach a length of seven or eight inches. They are pre-eminently\r\npredaceous forms, which lie hidden during the day and seek their prey by\r\nnight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 11. A true scorpion. After Comstock.]\r\n\r\nThe scorpions (fig. 11) possess large pedipalpi, terminated by strongly\r\ndeveloped claws, or chelae. They may be distinguished from all other\r\nArachnids by the fact that the distinctly segmented abdomen is divided\r\ninto a broad basal region of seven segments and a terminal, slender,\r\ntail-like division of five distinct segments.\r\n\r\nThe last segment of the abdomen, or telson, terminates in a\r\nventrally-directed, sharp spine, and contains a pair of highly developed\r\npoison glands. These glands open by two small pores near the tip of the\r\nspine. Most of the species when running carry the tip of the abdomen\r\nbent upward over the back, and the prey, caught and held by the\r\npedipalpi, is stung by inserting the spine of the telson and allowing it\r\nto remain for a time in the wound.\r\n\r\nThe glands themselves have been studied in _Prionurus citrinus_ by\r\nWilson (1904). He found that each gland is covered by a sheet of muscle\r\non its mesal and dorsal aspects, which may be described as the\r\n_compressor muscle_. The muscle of each side is inserted by its edge\r\nalong the ventral inner surface of the chitinous wall of the telson,\r\nclose to the middle line, and by a broader insertion laterally. A layer\r\nof fine connective tissue completely envelops each gland and forms the\r\nbasis upon which the secreting cells rest. The secreting epithelium is\r\ncolumnar; and apparently of three different types of cells.\r\n\r\n1. The most numerous have the appearance of mucous cells, resembling the\r\ngoblet cells of columnar mucous membranes. The nucleus, surrounded by a\r\nsmall quantity of protoplasm staining with haematoxylin, lies close to\r\nthe base of the cell.\r\n\r\n2. Cells present in considerable numbers, the peripheral portions of\r\nwhich are filled with very numerous fine granules, staining with acid\r\ndyes such as methyl orange.\r\n\r\n3. Cells few in number, filled with very large granules, or irregular\r\nmasses of a substance staining with haematoxylin.\r\n\r\nThe poison, according to Kobert (1893), is a limpid, acid-reacting\r\nfluid, soluble in water but insoluble in absolute alcohol and ether.\r\nThere are few data relative to its chemical nature. Wilson (1901) states\r\nthat a common Egyptian species, _Buthus quinquestriatus_, has a specific\r\ngravity of 1.092, and contains 20.3% of solids and 8.4% ash.\r\n\r\nThe venom of different species appears to differ not only quantitatively\r\nbut qualitatively. The effects of the bite of the smaller species of the\r\nSouthern United States may be painful but there is no satisfactory\r\nevidence that it is ever fatal. On the other hand, certain tropical\r\nspecies are exceedingly virulent and cases of death of man from the bite\r\nare common.\r\n\r\nIn the case of _Buthus quinquestriatus_, Wilson (1904) found the\r\nsymptoms in animals to be hypersecretion, salivation and lachrymation,\r\nespecially marked, convulsions followed by prolonged muscular spasm;\r\ndeath from asphyxia. The temperature shows a slight, rarely\r\nconsiderable, rise. Rapid and considerable increase of blood-pressure\r\n(observed in dogs) is followed by a gradual fall with slowing of the\r\nheart-beat. The coagulability of the blood is not affected.\r\n\r\nAn interesting phase of Wilson's work was the experiments on desert\r\nmammals. The condition under which these animals exist must frequently\r\nbring them in contact with scorpions, and he found that they possess a\r\ndegree of immunity to the venom sufficient at least to protect them from\r\nthe fatal effects of the sting.\r\n\r\nAs far as concerns its effect on man, Wilson found that much depended\r\nupon the age. As high as 60 per cent of the cases of children under\r\nfive, resulted fatally. Caroroz (1865), states that in a Mexican state\r\nof 15,000 inhabitants, the scorpions were so abundant and so much feared\r\nthat the authorities offered a bounty for their destruction. A result\r\nwas a large number of fatalities, over two hundred per year. Most of the\r\nvictims were children who had attempted to collect the scorpions.\r\n\r\nThe treatment usually employed in the case of bites by the more\r\npoisonous forms is similar to that for the bite of venomous snakes.\r\nFirst, a tight ligature is applied above the wound so as to stop the\r\nflow of blood and lymph from that region. The wound is then freely\r\nexcised and treated with a strong solution of permanganate of potash, or\r\nwith lead and opium lotion.\r\n\r\nIn recent years there have been many attempts to prepare an antivenom,\r\nor antiserum comparable to what has been used so effectively in the case\r\nof snake bites. The most promising of these is that of Todd (1909),\r\nproduced by the immunization of suitable animals. This antivenom proved\r\ncapable of neutralizing the venom when mixed _in vitro_ and also acts\r\nboth prophylactically and curatively in animals. Employed curatively in\r\nman, it appears to have a very marked effect on the intense pain\r\nfollowing the sting, and the evidence so far indicates that its prompt\r\nuse greatly reduces the chance of fatal results.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOLPUGIDA, OR SOLPUGIDS\r\n\r\nThe SOLPUGIDA are peculiar spider-like forms which are distinguished\r\nfrom nearly all other arachnids by the fact that they possess no true\r\ncephalothorax, the last two leg-bearing segments being distinct,\r\nresembling those of the abdomen in this respect. The first pair of legs\r\nis not used in locomotion but seemingly functions as a second pair of\r\npedipalpi. Figure 12 illustrates the striking peculiarities of the\r\ngroup. They are primarily desert forms and occur in the warm zones of\r\nall countries. Of the two hundred or more species, Comstock lists twelve\r\nas occurring in our fauna. These occur primarily in the southwest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 12. A solpugid (Eremobates cinerea). After Comstock.]\r\n\r\nThe Solpugida have long borne a bad reputation and, regarding virulence,\r\nhave been classed with the scorpions. Among the effects of their bites\r\nhave been described painful swelling, gangrene, loss of speech, cramps,\r\ndelirium, unconsciousness and even death. Opposed to the numerous loose\r\naccounts of poisoning, there are a number of careful records by\r\nphysicians and zoologists which indicate clearly that the effects are\r\nlocal and though they may be severe, they show not the slightest symptom\r\nof direct poisoning.\r\n\r\nMore important in the consideration of the question is the fact that\r\nthere are neither poison glands nor pores in the fangs for the exit of\r\nany poisonous secretion. This is the testimony of a number of prominent\r\nzoologists, among whom is Dr. A. Walter, who wrote to Kobert at length\r\non the subject and whose conclusions are presented by him.\r\n\r\nHowever, it should be noted that the fangs are very powerful and are\r\nused in such a manner that they may inflict especially severe wounds.\r\nThus, there may be more opportunity for secondary infection than is\r\nusual in the case of insect wounds.\r\n\r\nThe treatment of the bite of the Solpugida is, therefore, a matter of\r\npreventing infection. The wound should be allowed to bleed freely and\r\nthen washed out with a 1:3000 solution of corrosive sublimate, and, if\r\nsevere, a wet dressing of this should be applied. If infection takes\r\nplace, it should be treated in the usual manner, regardless of its\r\norigin.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ACARINA, OR MITES AND TICKS\r\n\r\nA number of the parasitic Acarina evidently secrete a specific poison,\r\npresumably carried by the saliva, but in most cases its effect on man is\r\ninsignificant. There is an abundant literature dealing with the\r\npoisonous effect of the bite of these forms, especially the ticks, but\r\nuntil recently it has been confused by failure to recognize that various\r\nspecies may transmit diseases of man, rather than produce injury through\r\ndirect poisoning. We shall therefore discuss the Acarina more especially\r\nin subsequent chapters, dealing with parasitism and with disease\r\ntransmission.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, after the evidence is sifted, there can be no doubt that\r\nthe bites of certain ticks may occasionally be followed by a direct\r\npoisoning, which may be either local or general in its effects. Nuttall\r\n(1908) was unable to determine the cause of the toxic effect, for, in\r\n_Argas persicus_, the species most often implicated, he failed to get\r\nthe slightest local or general effect on experimental animals, from the\r\ninjection of an emulsion prepared by crushing three of the ticks.\r\n\r\nIt seems clearly established that the bite of certain ticks may cause a\r\ntemporary paralysis, or even complete paralysis, involving the organs of\r\nrespiration or the heart, and causing death. In 1912, Dr. I. U. Temple,\r\nof Pendleton, Oregon, reported several cases of what he called \"acute\r\nascending paralysis\" associated with the occurrence of ticks on the head\r\nor the back of the neck. A typical severe case was that of a six year\r\nold child, who had retired in her usual normal health. The following\r\nmorning upon arising she was unable to stand on her feet. She exhibited\r\nparalysis extending to the knees, slight temperature, no pain, sensory\r\nnerves normal, motor nerves completely paralyzed, reflexes absent. The\r\nfollowing day the paralysis had extended to the upper limbs, and before\r\nnight of the third day the nerves of the throat (hypoglossal) were\r\naffected. The thorax and larynx were involved, breathing was labored,\r\nshe was unable to swallow liquids, phonation was impossible and she\r\ncould only make low, guttural sounds. At this stage, two ticks, fully\r\ndistended with blood, were found over the junction of the spinal column\r\nwith the occipital bones in the hollow depression. They were removed by\r\nthe application of undiluted creoline. Though the child's life was\r\ndespaired of, by the following morning she was very much improved. By\r\nevening she was able to speak. The paralysis gradually receded,\r\nremaining longest in the feet, and at the end of one week the patient\r\nwas able to go home.\r\n\r\nThere was some doubt as to the exact species of tick implicated in the\r\ncases which Dr. Temple reported, although the evidence pointed strongly\r\nto _Dermacentor venustus_.[C] Somewhat later, Hadwen (1913) reported\r\nthat \"tick paralysis\" occurs in British Columbia, where it affects not\r\nonly man, but sheep and probably other animals. It is caused by the\r\nbites of _Dermacentor venustus_ and was experimentally produced in lambs\r\nand a dog (Hadwen and Nuttall, 1913). It is only when the tick begins to\r\nengorge or feed rapidly, some days after it has become attached, that\r\nits saliva produces pathogenic effects.\r\n\r\nUlceration following tick bite is not uncommon. In many of the instances\r\nit is due to the file-like hypostome, with its recurved teeth, being\r\nleft in the wound when the tick is forcibly pulled off.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MYRIAPODA, OR CENTIPEDES AND MILLIPEDES\r\n\r\nThe old class, Myriapoda includes the DIPLOPODA, or millipedes, and the\r\nCHILOPODA, or centipedes. The present tendency is to raise these groups\r\nto the rank of classes.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Diplopoda\r\n\r\nThe DIPLOPODA, or millipedes (fig. 13), are characterized by the\r\npresence of two pairs of legs to a segment. The largest of our local\r\nmyriapods belong to this group. They live in moist places, feeding\r\nprimarily on decaying vegetable matter, though a few species\r\noccasionally attack growing plants.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 13. A millipede. After Comstock.]\r\n\r\nThe millipedes are inoffensive and harmless. _Julus terrestris_, and\r\nrelated species, when irritated pour out over the entire body a\r\nyellowish secretion which escapes from cutaneous glands. It is volatile,\r\nwith a pungent odor, and Phisalix (1900) has shown that it is an active\r\npoison when injected into the blood of experimental animals. This,\r\nhowever, does not entitle them to be considered as poisonous arthropods,\r\nin the sense of this chapter, any more than the toad can be considered\r\npoisonous to man because it secretes a venom from its cutaneous glands.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Chilopoda\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 14. Two common centipedes.\r\n\r\n(_a_) Lithobius forficatus. After Comstock.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Scutigera forceps. Natural size; after Howard.]\r\n\r\nThe CHILOPODA, or centipedes (fig. 14), unlike the millipedes, are\r\npredaceous forms, and possess well developed poison glands for killing\r\ntheir prey. These glands are at the base of the first pair of legs\r\n(fig. 15), which are bent forward so as to be used in holding their\r\nprey. The legs terminate in a powerful claw, at the tip of which is the\r\noutlet of the poison glands.\r\n\r\nThe poison is a limpid, homogeneous, slightly acid fluid, which\r\nprecipitates in distilled water. Briot (1904) extracted it from the\r\nglands of _Scolopendra morsitans_, a species common in central France,\r\nand found that it was actively venomous for the ordinary experimental\r\nanimals. A rabbit of two kilograms weight received an injection of three\r\ncubic centimeters in the vein of the ear and died in a minute. A white\r\nrat, weighing forty-eight grams, received one and a half cubic\r\ncentimeters in the hind leg. There was an almost immediate paralysis of\r\nthe leg and marked necrosis of the tissues.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 15. Mandible of Scolopendra cingulata showing venom\r\ngland. After Dubosq.]\r\n\r\nAs for the effect on man, there is little foundation for the fear with\r\nwhich centipedes are regarded. Our native species produce, at most,\r\nlocal symptoms,--sometimes severe local pain and swelling,--but there is\r\nno authentic record of fatal results. In the tropics, some of the\r\nspecies attain a large size, _Scolopendra gigantea_ reaching a length of\r\nnearly a foot. These forms are justly feared, and there is good evidence\r\nthat death sometimes, though rarely, results from their bite.\r\n\r\nOne of the most careful accounts of death from the sting of the scorpion\r\nis that of Linnell, (1914), which relates to a comparatively small\r\nMalayan species, unfortunately undetermined. The patient, a coolie, aged\r\ntwenty, was admitted to a hospital after having been stung two days\r\npreviously on the left heel. For cure, the other coolies had made him\r\neat the head of the scorpion. On admission, the patient complained of\r\n\"things creeping all over the body\". Temp. 102.8^o. On the fourth day he\r\nhad paralysis of the legs, and on the fifth day motor paralysis to the\r\numbilicus, sensation being unaltered. On the sixth day there was\r\nretention of the urine and on the ninth day (first test after third day)\r\nsugar was present. On the thirteenth day the patient became comatose,\r\nbut could be roused to eat and drink. The temperature on the following\r\nday fell below 95^o and the patient was still comatose. Death fifteenth\r\nday.\r\n\r\nExamination of the spinal (lumbar) cord showed acute disseminated\r\nmyelitis. In one part there was an acute destruction of the anterior\r\nhorn and an infiltration of round cells. In another portion Clarke's\r\ncolumn had been destroyed. The perivascular sheaths were crowded with\r\nsmall round cells and the meninges were congested. Some of the cells of\r\nthe anterior horn were swollen and the nuclei eccentric; chromatolysis\r\nhad occurred in many of them.\r\n\r\nAs for treatment, Castellani and Chalmers (1910), recommend bathing the\r\npart well with a solution of ammonia (one in five, or one in ten). After\r\nbathing, apply a dressing of the same alkali or, if there is much\r\nswelling and redness, an ice-bag. If necessary, hypodermic injections of\r\nmorphine may be given to relieve the pain. At a later period\r\nfomentations may be required to reduce the local inflammation.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HEXAPODA OR TRUE INSECTS\r\n\r\nThere are a number of HEXAPODA, or true insects, which are, in one way\r\nor another, poisonous to man. These belong primarily to the orders\r\nHemiptera, or true bugs; Lepidoptera, or butterflies and moths (larval\r\nforms); Diptera, or flies; Coleoptera, or beetles; and Hymenoptera, or\r\nants, bees, and wasps. There are various ways in which they may be\r\npoisonous.\r\n\r\n1. _Piercing_ or _biting_ forms may inject an irritating or poisonous\r\nsaliva into the wound caused by their mouth-parts.\r\n\r\n2. _Stinging forms_ may inject a poison, from glands at the caudal end\r\nof the abdomen, into wounds produced by a specially modified ovipositer,\r\nthe _sting_.\r\n\r\n3. _Nettling_ properties may be possessed by the hairs of the insect.\r\n\r\n4. _Vescicating_, or _poisonous blood plasma_, or _body fluids_ are\r\nknown to exist in a large number of species and may, under exceptional\r\ncircumstances, affect man.\r\n\r\nFor convenience of discussion, we shall consider poisonous insects under\r\nthese various headings. In this, as in the preceding discussion, no\r\nattempt will be made to give an exhaustive list of the poisonous forms.\r\nTypical instances will be selected and these will be chosen largely from\r\nNorth American species.\r\n\r\n\r\nPIERCING OR BITING INSECTS POISONOUS TO MAN\r\n\r\n\r\nHEMIPTERA\r\n\r\nSeveral families of the true bugs include forms which, while normally\r\ninoffensive, are capable of inflicting painful wounds on man. In these,\r\nas in all of the Hemiptera, the mouth-parts are modified to form an\r\norgan for piercing and sucking. This is well shown by the accompanying\r\nillustration (fig. 16).\r\n\r\nThe upper lip, or _labrum_, is much reduced and immovable, the lower\r\nlip, or _labium_, is elongated to form a jointed sheath, within which\r\nthe lance-like mandibles and maxillae are enclosed. The mandibles are\r\nmore or less deeply serrate, depending on the species concerned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 16. Beak of hemipteron.]\r\n\r\nThe poison is elaborated by the salivary glands, excepting, possibly, in\r\n_Belostoma_ where Locy is inclined to believe that it is secreted by the\r\nmaxillary glands. The salivary glands of the Hemiptera have been the\r\nsubject of much study but the most recent, comprehensive work has been\r\ndone by Bugnion and Popoff, (1908 and 1910) to whose text the reader is\r\nreferred for details.\r\n\r\nThe Hemiptera have two pairs of salivary glands: the _primary gland_, of\r\nwhich the efferent duct leads to the salivary syringe, and the\r\n_accessory gland_, of which the very long and flexuous duct empties into\r\nthe primary duct at its point of insertion. Thus, when one observes the\r\nisolated primary gland it appears as though it had efferent ducts\r\ninserted at the same point. In _Nepa_ and the _Fulgoridae_ there are two\r\naccessory glands and therefore apparently three ducts at the same point\r\non the primary gland. The _ensemble_ differs greatly in appearance in\r\ndifferent species but we shall show here Bugnion and Popoff's figure of\r\nthe apparatus of _Notonecta maculata_, a species capable of inflicting a\r\npainful bite on man (fig. 17).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 17. Salivary glands of Notonecta maculata. After Bugnion\r\nand Popoff.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 18. Pharyngeal syringe or salivary pump of Fulgora\r\nmaculata. After Bugnion and Popoff.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 19. Heteroptera, (_a_) Melanolestes picipes; (_b_)\r\nNotonecta undulata; (_c_, _d_) Aradus robustus (_c_) adult, (_d_) nymph,\r\nmuch enlarged; (_e_) Arilus cristatus; (_f_) Belostoma americana; (_g_)\r\nNabis (Coriscus) subcoleoptratus, enlarged; (_h_) Cimex lectularius,\r\n(_i_) Oeciacus vicarius, much enlarged; (_j_) Lyctocoris fitchii, much\r\nenlarged. After Lugger.]\r\n\r\nAccessory to the salivary apparatus there is on the ventral side of the\r\nhead, underneath the pharynx, a peculiar organ which the Germans have\r\ncalled the \"Wanzenspritze,\" or syringe. The accompanying figure of the\r\nstructure in _Fulgora maculata_ (fig. 18) shows its relation to the\r\nducts of the salivary glands and to the beak. It is made up of a\r\ndilatation forming the body of the pump, in which there is a chitinous\r\npiston. Attached to the piston is a strong retractor muscle. The\r\nfunction of the salivary pump is to suck up the saliva from the salivary\r\nducts and to force it out through the beak.\r\n\r\nOf the Hemiptera reported as attacking man, we shall consider briefly\r\nthe forms most frequently noted.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe NOTONECTIDAE, or _back swimmers_, (fig. 19_b_) are small, aquatic\r\nbugs that differ from all others in that they always swim on their\r\nbacks. They are predaceous; feeding on insects and other small forms.\r\nWhen handled carelessly they are able to inflict a painful bite, which\r\nis sometimes as severe as the sting of a bee. In fact, they are known in\r\nGermany as \"Wasserbienen.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThe BELOSTOMATIDAE, or _giant water bugs_, (fig. 19_f_) include the\r\nlargest living Hemiptera. They are attracted to lights and on account of\r\nthe large numbers which swarm about the electric street lamps in some\r\nlocalities they have received the popular name \"electric light bugs.\"\r\nOur largest representatives in the northern United States belong to the\r\ntwo genera _Belostoma_ and _Banacus_, distinguished from each other by\r\nthe fact that _Belostoma_ has a groove on the under side of the femur of\r\nthe front leg, for the reception of the tibia.\r\n\r\nThe salivary glands of Belostoma were figured by Leidy (1847) and later\r\nwere studied in more detail by Locy (1884). There are two pairs of the\r\nglands, those of one pair being long and extending back as far as the\r\nbeginning of the abdomen, while the others are about one-fourth as long.\r\nThey lie on either side of the oesophagus. On each side of the\r\noesophagus there is a slender tube with a sigmoid swelling which may\r\nserve as a poison reservoir. In addition to this salivary system, there\r\nis a pair of very prominent glands on the ventral side of the head,\r\nopening just above the base of the beak. These Locy has called the\r\n\"cephalic glands\" and he suggests that they are the source of the\r\npoison. They are the homologues of the maxillary glands described for\r\nother Hemiptera, and it is by no means clear that they are concerned\r\nwith the production of venom. It seems more probable that in\r\n_Belostoma_, as in other Hemiptera, it is produced by the salivary\r\nglands, though the question is an open one.\r\n\r\nThe Belostomatidae feed not only on insects, but on small frogs, fish,\r\nsalamanders and the like. Matheson (1907) has recorded the killing of a\r\ngood-sized bird by _Belostoma americana_. A woodpecker, or flicker, was\r\nheard to utter cries of distress, and fluttered and fell from a tree. On\r\nexamination it was found that a bug of this species had inserted its\r\nbeak into the back part of the skull and was apparently busily engaged\r\nin sucking the blood or brains of the bird. Various species of\r\n_Belostoma_ have been cited as causing painful bites in man. We can\r\ntestify from personal experience that the bite of _Belostoma americana_\r\nmay almost immediately cause severe, shooting pains that may extend\r\nthroughout the arm and that they may be felt for several days.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 20. Reduvius (Opsicoetus) personatus. (x2).]\r\n\r\nRelief from the pain may be obtained by the use of dilute ammonia, or a\r\nmenthol ointment. In the not uncommon case of secondary infection the\r\nusual treatment for that should be adopted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 21. (_a_) Reduvius personatus, nymph. Photograph by M. V.\r\nS.]\r\n\r\nThe REDUVIIDAE, or _assassin-bugs_ are capable of inflicting very painful\r\nwounds, as most collectors of Hemiptera know to their sorrow. Some\r\nspecies are frequently to be found in houses and outhouses and Dr.\r\nHoward suggests that many of the stories of painful spider bites relate\r\nto the attack of these forms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 21. (_b_) Reduvius personatus, adult (x2) Photograph by\r\nM. V. S.]\r\n\r\nAn interesting psychological study was afforded in the summer of 1899,\r\nby the \"kissing-bug\" scare which swept over the country. It was reported\r\nin the daily papers that a new and deadly bug had made its appearance,\r\nwhich had the unpleasant habit of choosing the lips or cheeks for its\r\npoint of attack on man. So widespread were the stories regarding this\r\nsupposedly new insect that station entomologists all over the country\r\nbegan to receive suspected specimens for identification. At Cornell\r\nthere were received, among others, specimens of stone-flies, may-flies\r\nand even small moths, with inquiries as to whether they were\r\n\"kissing-bugs.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 22. Rasahus biguttatus. (x2). After Howard.]\r\n\r\nDr. L. O. Howard has shown that the scare had its origin in newspaper\r\nreports of some instances of bites by either _Melanolestes picipes_\r\n(fig. 19a) or _Opsicoetes personatus_ (fig. 20), in the vicinity of\r\nWashington, D. C. He then discusses in considerable detail the more\r\nprominent of the Reduviidae which, with greater or less frequency pierce\r\nthe skin of human beings. These are _Opsicoetes personatus_,\r\n_Melanolestes picipes_, _Coriscus subcoleoptratus_ (fig. 19_g_),\r\n_Rasahus thoracicus_, _Rasahus biguttatus_ (fig. 22), _Conorhinus\r\nsanguisugus_ (fig. 71), and _Melanolestes abdominalis_ (fig. 23).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 23. Melanolestes abdominalis (x2). After Marlatt.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting of these species is _Reduvius personatus_,\r\n(= _Opsicoetus personatus_), which is popularly known as the \"masked\r\nbed-bug hunter.\" It owes this name to the fact that the immature nymphs\r\n(fig. 21) have their bodies and legs completely covered by dust and\r\nlint, and that they are supposed to prey upon bed-bugs. LeConte is\r\nquoted by Howard as stating that \"This species is remarkable for the\r\nintense pain caused by its bite. I do not know whether it ever willingly\r\nplunges its rostrum into any person, but when caught, or unskilfully\r\nhandled it always stings. In this case the pain is almost equal to the\r\nbite of a snake, and the swelling and irritation which result from it\r\nwill sometimes last for a week.\"\r\n\r\nA species which very commonly attacks man is _Conorhinus sanguisugus_,\r\nthe so-called \"big bed-bug\" of the south and southern United States. It\r\nis frequently found in houses and is known to inflict an exceedingly\r\npainful bite. As in the case of a number of other predaceous Hemiptera,\r\nthe salivary glands of these forms are highly developed. The effect of\r\nthe bite on their prey and, as Marlatt has pointed out, the constant and\r\nuniform character of the symptoms in nearly all cases of bites in man,\r\nclearly indicate that their saliva contains a specific substance. No\r\nsatisfactory studies of the secretions have been made. On the other\r\nhand, Dr. Howard is doubtless right in maintaining that the very serious\r\nresults which sometimes follow the bite are due to the introduction of\r\nextraneous poison germs. This is borne out by the symptoms of most of\r\nthe cases cited in literature and also by the fact that treatment with\r\ncorrosive sublimate, locally applied to the wound, has yielded favorable\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER HEMIPTERA REPORTED AS POISONOUS TO MAN--A large number of other\r\nHemiptera have been reported as attacking man. Of these, there are\r\nseveral species of Lygaeidae, Coreidae, and Capsidae. Of the\r\nlatter, _Lygus pratensis_, the tarnished plant-bug, is reported by\r\nProfessor Crosby as sucking blood. _Orthotylus flavosparsus_ is another\r\nCapsid which has been implicated. _Empoasca mali_ and _Platymetopius\r\nacutus_ of the Jassidae have also been reported as having similar\r\nhabits.\r\n\r\nWhenever the periodical cicada or \"seventeen-year locust\" becomes\r\nabundant, the newspapers contain accounts of serious results from its\r\nbites. The senior author has made scores of attempts to induce this\r\nspecies to bite and only once successfully. At that time the bite was in\r\nno wise more severe than a pin-prick. A student in our department\r\nreports a similar experience. There is no case on record which bears\r\nevidence of being worthy of any credence, whatsoever.\r\n\r\nUnder the heading of poisonous Hemiptera we might consider the bed-bugs\r\nand the lice. These will be discussed later, as parasites and as\r\ncarriers of disease, and therefore need only be mentioned here.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIPTERA\r\n\r\nSeveral species of blood-sucking Diptera undoubtedly secrete a saliva\r\npossessing poisonous properties. Chief among these are the Culicidae, or\r\nmosquitoes, and the Simuliidae, or black-flies. As we shall consider\r\nthese forms in detail under the heading of parasitic species and\r\ninsects transmitting disease, we shall discuss here only the poison of\r\nthe mosquitoes.\r\n\r\nIt is well known that mosquitoes, when they bite, inject into the wound\r\na minute quantity of poison. The effect of this varies according to the\r\nspecies of mosquito and also depends very much on the susceptibility of\r\nthe individual. Soon after the bite a sensation of itching is noticed\r\nand often a wheal, or eminence, is produced on the skin, which may\r\nincrease to a considerable swelling. The scratching which is induced may\r\ncause a secondary infection and thus lead to serious results. Some\r\npeople seem to acquire an immunity against the poison.\r\n\r\nThe purpose of this irritating fluid may be, as Reaumur suggested, to\r\nprevent the coagulation of the blood and thus not only to cause it to\r\nflow freely when the insect bites but to prevent its rapid coagulation\r\nin the stomach. Obviously, it is not developed as a protective fluid,\r\nand its presence subjects the group to the additional handicap of the\r\nvengeance of man.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 24. Diagram of a longitudinal section of a mosquito.]\r\n\r\nAs to the origin of the poison, there has been little question, until\r\nrecent years, that it was a secretion from the salivary glands.\r\nMacloskie (1888) showed that each gland is subdivided into three lobes,\r\nthe middle of which differs from the others in having evenly granulated\r\ncontents and staining more deeply than the others (fig. 24). This middle\r\nlobe he regarded as the source of the poison. Bruck, (1911), by the use\r\nof water, glycerine, chloroform, and other fluids, extracted from the\r\nbodies of a large number of mosquitoes a toxine which he calls\r\n_culicin_. This he assumes comes from the salivary glands. Animal\r\nexperimentation showed that this extract possessed hemolytic powers.\r\nInoculated into the experimenter's own skin it produced lesions which\r\nbehaved exactly as do those of mosquito bites.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, most writers on the subject have concurred with the view that\r\nthe salivary glands are the source of the poison. However, recent work,\r\nespecially that of Nuttall and Shipley (1903), and Schaudinn (1904), has\r\nshown that the evidence is by no means conclusive. Nuttall dissected out\r\nsix sets (thirty-six acini) of glands from freshly killed _Culex\r\npipiens_ and placed them in a drop of salt solution. The drop was\r\nallowed to dry, it being thought that the salt crystals would facilitate\r\nthe grinding up of the glands with the end of a small glass rod, this\r\nbeing done under microscopic control. After grinding up, a small drop of\r\nwater was added of the size of the original drop of saline, and an equal\r\nvolume of human blood taken from the clean finger-tip was quickly mixed\r\ntherewith, and the whole drawn up into a capillary tube. Clotting was\r\nnot prevented and no hemolysis occurred. Salivary gland emulsion added\r\nto a dilute suspension of corpuscles did not lead to hemolysis. This\r\nexperiment was repeated a number of times, with slight modification, but\r\nwith similar results. The data obtained from the series \"do not support\r\nthe hypothesis that the salivary glands, at any rate in _Culex pipiens_,\r\ncontain a substance which prevents coagulation.\"\r\n\r\nMuch more detailed, and the more important experiments made along this\r\nline, are those of Schaudinn (1904). The results of these experiments\r\nwere published in connection with a technical paper on the alternation\r\nof generations and of hosts in _Trypanosoma_ and _Spirochaeta_, and for\r\nthis reason seem to have largely escaped the notice of entomologists.\r\nThey are so suggestive that we shall refer to them in some detail.\r\n\r\nSchaudinn observed that the three oesophageal diverticula (commonly,\r\nbut incorrectly, known as the \"sucking stomach\") (fig. 24) usually\r\ncontain large bubbles of gas and in addition, he always found yeast\r\ncells. On the ground of numerous observations, Schaudinn was convinced\r\nthat these yeast plants are normal and constant commensals of the\r\ninsect. He regarded them as the cause of the gas bubbles to be found in\r\ndiverticula. It was found that as the insect fed, from time to time the\r\nabdomen underwent convulsive contractions which resulted in the emptying\r\nof the oesophageal diverticula and the salivary glands through blood\r\npressure.\r\n\r\nIn order to test the supposed toxic action of the salivary glands,\r\nSchaudinn repeatedly introduced them under his skin and that of his\r\nassistant, in a drop of salt solution, and never obtained a suggestion\r\nof the irritation following a bite of the insect, even though the glands\r\nwere carefully rubbed to fragments after their implantation. Like\r\nNuttall, he failed to get satisfactory evidence that the secretion of\r\nthe salivary glands retarded coagulation of the blood.\r\n\r\nHe then carefully removed the oesophageal diverticula with their\r\ncontent of yeast and introduced them into an opening in the skin of the\r\nhand. Within a few seconds there was noticeable the characteristic\r\nitching irritation of the mosquito bite; and in a short time there\r\nappeared reddening and typical swelling. This was usually much more\r\nsevere than after the usual mosquito bite, and the swelling persisted\r\nand itched longer. This was because by the ordinary bite of the mosquito\r\nmost of the yeast cells are again sucked up, while in these experiments\r\nthey remained in the wound. These experiments were repeated a number of\r\ntimes on himself, his assistant and others, and always with the same\r\nresult. From them Schaudinn decided that the poisonous action of the\r\nmosquito bite is caused by an enzyme from a commensal fungus. These\r\nconclusions have not, as yet, been satisfactorily tested.\r\n\r\nRelief from the effect of the mosquito bite may be obtained by bathing\r\nthe swellings with weak ammonia or, according to Howard, by using moist\r\nsoap. The latter is to be rubbed gently on the puncture and is said to\r\nspeedily allay the irritation. Howard also quotes from the _Journal of\r\nTropical Medicine and Hygiene_ to the effect that a few drops of a\r\nsolution of thirty to forty grains of iodine to an ounce of saponated\r\npetroleum rubbed into the mosquito bite, or wasp sting, allay the pain\r\ninstantaneously.\r\n\r\nMethods of mosquito control will be discussed later, in considering\r\nthese insects as parasites and as carriers of disease.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTINGING INSECTS\r\n\r\nThe stinging insects all belong to the order HYMENOPTERA. In a number of\r\nfamilies of this group the ovipositor is modified to form a sting and is\r\nconnected with poison-secreting glands. We shall consider the apparatus\r\nof the honey-bee and then make briefer reference to that of other forms.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPIS MELLIFICA, THE HONEY BEE--The sting of the worker honey-bee is\r\nsituated within a so-called sting chamber at the end of the abdomen.\r\nThis chamber is produced by the infolding of the greatly reduced and\r\nmodified eighth, ninth and tenth abdominal segments into the seventh.[D]\r\nFrom it the dart-like sting can be quickly exserted.\r\n\r\nThe sting (fig. 25) is made up of a central shaft, ventro-laterad of\r\nwhich are the paired _lancets_, or darts, which are provided with sharp,\r\nrecurved teeth. Still further laterad lie the paired whitish,\r\nfinger-like _sting palpi_. Comparative morphological as well as\r\nembryological studies have clearly established that these three parts\r\ncorrespond to the three pairs of gonopophyses of the ovipositor of more\r\ngeneralized insects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 25. Sting of a honey bee. _Psn Sc_, base of acid poison\r\ngland; _B Gl_, alkaline poison gland; _Stn Plp_, sting palpi; _Sh B_,\r\nbulb of sting; _Sh A_, basal arm; _Lct_, lancets or darts; _Sh s_, shaft\r\nof sting. Modified from Snodgrass.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 26. Poison apparatus of a honey bee. Modified from\r\nSnodgrass.]\r\n\r\nAn examination of the internal structures (fig. 26) reveals two distinct\r\ntypes of poison glands, the acid-secreting and the alkaline-secreting\r\nglands, and a prominent poison reservoir. In addition, there is a small\r\npair of accessory structures which have been called lubricating glands,\r\non account of the supposed function of their product. The acid-secreting\r\ngland empties into the distal end of the poison reservoir which in turn\r\npours the secretion into the muscular bulb-like enlargement at the base\r\nof the shaft. The alkaline secreting gland empties into the bulb ventrad\r\nof the narrow neck of the reservoir.\r\n\r\nThe poison is usually referred to as formic acid. That it is not so\r\neasily explained has been repeatedly shown and is evidenced by the\r\npresence of the two types of glands. Carlet maintains that the product\r\nof either gland is in itself innocent,--it is only when they are\r\ncombined that the toxic properties appear.\r\n\r\nThe most detailed study of the poison of the honey-bee is that of Josef\r\nLanger (1897), who in the course of his work used some 25,000 bees.\r\nVarious methods of obtaining the active poison for experimental purposes\r\nwere used. For obtaining the pure secretion, bees were held in the\r\nfingers and compressed until the sting was exserted, when a clear drop\r\nof the poison was visible at its tip. This was then taken up in a\r\ncapillary tube or dilute solutions obtained by dipping the tip of the\r\nsting into a definite amount of distilled water.\r\n\r\nAn aqueous solution of the poison was more readily obtained by pulling\r\nout the sting and poison sacs by means of forceps, and grinding them up\r\nin water. The somewhat clouded fluid was then filtered one or more\r\ntimes. For obtaining still greater quantities, advantage was taken of\r\nthe fact that while alcohol coagulates the poison, the active principle\r\nremains soluble in water. Hence the stings with the annexed glands where\r\ncollected in 96 per cent alcohol, after filtering off of the alcohol\r\nwere dried at 40^o C., then rubbed to a fine powder and this was\r\nrepeatedly extracted with water. Through filtering of this aqueous\r\nextract there was obtained a yellowish-brown fluid which produced the\r\ntypical reactions, according to concentration of the poison.\r\n\r\nThe freshly expelled drop of poison is limpid, of distinct acid\r\nreaction, tastes bitter and has a delicate aromatic odor. On\r\nevaporation, it leaves a sticky residue, which at 100 degrees becomes\r\nfissured, and suggests dried gum arabic. The poison is readily soluble\r\nin water and possesses a specific gravity of 1.1313. On drying at room\r\ntemperature, it leaves a residue of 30 per cent, which has not lost in\r\npoisonous action or in solubility. In spite of extended experiments,\r\nLanger was unable to determine the nature of the active principle. He\r\nshowed that it was not, as had been supposed, an albuminous body, but\r\nrather an organic base.\r\n\r\nThe pure poison, or the two per cent aqueous solution, placed on the\r\nuninjured skin showed absolutely no irritating effect, though it\r\nproduced a marked reaction on the mucus membrane of the nose or eye. A\r\nsingle drop of one-tenth per cent aqueous solution of the poison brought\r\nabout a typical irritation in the conjunctiva of the rabbit's eye. On\r\nthe other hand, the application of a drop of the poison, or its\r\nsolution, to the slightest break in the skin, or by means of a needle\r\npiercing the skin, produced typical effects. There is produced a local\r\nnecrosis, in the neighborhood of which there is infiltration of\r\nlymphocytes, oedema, and hyperaemia.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the sting on man (fig. 27) is usually transitory but there\r\nare some individuals who are made sick for hours, by a single sting.\r\nMuch depends, too, on the place struck. It is a common experience that\r\nan angry bee will attempt to reach the eye of its victim and a sting on\r\nthe lid may result in severe and prolonged swelling. In the case of a\r\nman stung on the cheek, Legiehn observed complete aphonia and a breaking\r\nout of red blotches all over the body. A sting on the tongue has been\r\nknown to cause such collateral oedema as to endanger life through\r\nsuffocation. Cases of death of man from the attacks of bees are rare but\r\nare not unknown. Such results are usually from a number of stings but,\r\nrarely, death has been known to follow a single sting, entering a blood\r\nvessel of a particularly susceptible individual.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Effect of bee stings. After Root.]\r\n\r\nIt is clearly established that partial immunity from the effects of the\r\npoison may be acquired. By repeated injections of the venom, mice have\r\nbeen rendered capable of bearing doses that certainly would have killed\r\nthem at first. It is a well-known fact that most bee-keepers become\r\ngradually hardened to the stings, so that the irritation and the\r\nswelling become less and less. Some individuals have found this immunity\r\na temporary one, to be reacquired each season. A striking case of\r\nacquired immunity is related by the Roots in their \"A B C and X Y Z of\r\nBee Culture.\" The evidence in the case is so clear that it should be\r\nmade more widely available and hence we quote it here.\r\n\r\nA young man who was determined to become a bee-keeper, was so\r\nsusceptible to the poison that he was most seriously affected by a\r\nsingle sting, his body breaking out with red blotches, breathing growing\r\ndifficult, and his heart action being painfully accelerated. \"We finally\r\nsuggested taking a live bee and pressing it on the back of his hand\r\nuntil it merely pierced his skin with the sting, then immediately\r\nbrushing off both bee and sting. This was done and since no serious\r\neffect followed, it was repeated inside of four or five days. This was\r\ncontinued for some three or four weeks, when the patient began to have a\r\nsort of itching sensation all over his body. The hypodermic injections\r\nof bee-sting poison were then discontinued. At the end of a month they\r\nwere repeated at intervals of four or five days. Again, after two or\r\nthree weeks the itching sensation came on, but it was less pronounced.\r\nThe patient was given a rest of about a month, when the doses were\r\nrepeated as before.\" By this course of treatment the young man became so\r\nthoroughly immunized that neither unpleasant results nor swelling\r\nfollowed the attacks of the insects and he is able to handle bees with\r\nthe same freedom that any experienced bee-keeper does.\r\n\r\nIn an interesting article in the _Entomological News_ for November,\r\n1914, J. H. Lovell calls attention to the fact that \"There has been a\r\nwidespread belief among apiarists that a beekeeper will receive more\r\nstings when dressed in black than when wearing white clothing. A large\r\namount of evidence has been published in the various bee journals\r\nshowing beyond question that honey-bees under certain conditions\r\ndiscriminate against black. A few instances may be cited in\r\nillustration. Of a flock of twelve chickens running in a bee-yard seven\r\nblack ones were stung to death, while five light colored ones escaped\r\nuninjured. A white dog ran among the bee-hives without attracting much\r\nattention, while at the same time a black dog was furiously assailed by\r\nthe bees. Mr. J. D. Byer, a prominent Canadian beekeeper, relates that a\r\nblack and white cow, tethered about forty feet from an apiary, was one\r\nafternoon attacked and badly stung by bees. On examination it was found\r\nthat the black spots had five or six stings to one on the white. All\r\nnoticed this fact, although no one was able to offer any explanation. A\r\nwhite horse is in much less danger of being stung, when driven near an\r\napiary, than a black one. It has, indeed, been observed repeatedly that\r\ndomestic animals of all kinds, if wholly or partially black, are much\r\nmore liable to be attacked by bees, if they wander among the hives, than\r\nthose which are entirely white.\"\r\n\r\nIn order to test the matter experimentally, the following series of\r\nexperiments was performed. In the language of the investigator:\r\n\r\n\"On a clear, warm day in August I dressed wholly in white with the\r\nexception of a black veil. Midway on the sleeve of my right arm there\r\nwas sewed a band of black cloth ten inches wide. I then entered the\r\nbee-yard and, removing the cover from one of the hives, lifted a piece\r\nof comb with both hands and gently shook it. Instantly many of the bees\r\nflew to the black band, which they continued to attack as long as they\r\nwere disturbed. Not a single bee attempted to sting the left sleeve,\r\nwhich was of course entirely white, and very few even alighted upon it.\"\r\n\r\n\"This experiment was repeated a second, third and fourth time; in each\r\ninstance with similar results. I estimated the number of bees on the\r\nband of black cloth at various moments was from thirty to forty; it was\r\nevident from their behavior that they were extremely irritable. To the\r\nleft white sleeve and other portions of my clothing they paid very\r\nlittle attention; but the black veil was very frequently attacked.\"\r\n\r\n\"A few days later the experiments were repeated, but the band of black\r\ncloth, ten inches wide, was sewed around my left arm instead of around\r\nthe right arm as before. When the bees were disturbed, after the hive\r\ncover had been removed, they fiercely attacked the band of black cloth\r\nas in the previous experiences; but the right white sleeve and the white\r\nsuit were scarcely noticed. At one time a part of the black cloth was\r\nalmost literally covered with furiously stinging bees, and the black\r\nveil was assailed by hundreds. The bees behaved in a similar manner when\r\na second hive on the opposite side of the apiary was opened.\"\r\n\r\n\"A white veil which had been procured for this purpose, was next\r\nsubstituted for the black veil. The result was most surprising, for,\r\nwhereas in the previous experiments hundreds of bees had attacked the\r\nblack veil, so few flew against the white veil as to cause me no\r\ninconvenience. Undoubtedly beekeepers will find it greatly to their\r\nadvantage to wear white clothing when working among their colonies of\r\nbees and manipulating the frames of the hives.\"\r\n\r\nWhen a honey-bee stings, the tip of the abdomen, with the entire sting\r\napparatus, is torn off and remains in the wound. Here the muscles\r\ncontinue to contract, for some minutes, forcing the barbs deeper and\r\ndeeper into the skin, and forcing out additional poison from the\r\nreservoir.\r\n\r\nTreatment, therefore, first consists in removing the sting without\r\nsqueezing out additional poison. This is accomplished by lifting and\r\nscraping it out with a knife-blade or the fingernail instead of grasping\r\nand pulling it out. Local application of alkalines, such as weak\r\nammonia, are often recommended on the assumption that the poison is an\r\nacid to be neutralized on this manner, but these are of little or no\r\navail. They should certainly not be rubbed in, as that would only\r\naccelerate the absorption of the poison. The use of cloths wrung out in\r\nhot water and applied as hot as can be borne, affords much relief in the\r\ncase of severe stings. The application of wet clay, or of the end of a\r\nfreshly cut potato is sometimes helpful.\r\n\r\nIn extreme cases, where there is great susceptibility, or where there\r\nmay have been many stings, a physician should be called. He may find\r\nstrychnine injections or other treatment necessary, if general symptoms\r\ndevelop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 28. The poison apparatus of Formica. Wheeler, after\r\nForel.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER STINGING FORMS--Of the five thousand, or more, species of bees,\r\nmost possess a sting and poison apparatus and some of the larger forms\r\nare capable of inflicting a much more painful sting than that of the\r\ncommon honey-bee. In fact, some, like the bumble bees, possess the\r\nadvantage that they do not lose the sting from once using it, but are\r\ncapable of driving it in repeatedly. In the tropics there are found many\r\nspecies of stingless bees but these are noted for their united efforts\r\nto drive away intruders by biting. Certain species possess a very\r\nirritating saliva which they inject into the wounds.\r\n\r\nThe ants are not ordinarily regarded as worthy of consideration under\r\nthe heading of \"stinging insects\" but as a matter of fact, most of them\r\npossess well developed stings and some of them, especially in the\r\ntropics, are very justly feared. Even those which lack the sting possess\r\nwell-developed poison glands and the parts of the entire stinging\r\napparatus, in so far as it is developed in the various species, may\r\nreadily be homologized with those of the honey-bee.\r\n\r\nThe ants lacking a sting are those of the subfamily CAMPONOTINAE, which\r\nincludes the largest of our local species. It is an interesting fact\r\nthat some of these species possess the largest poison glands and\r\nreservoir (fig. 28) and it is found that when they attack an enemy they\r\nbring the tip of the abdomen forward and spray the poison in such a way\r\nthat it is introduced into the wound made by the powerful mandibles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 29. A harmless, but much feared larva, the \"tomato worm.\"\r\nNatural size. Photograph by M. V. S.]\r\n\r\nMore feared than any of the other Hymenoptera are the hornets and wasps.\r\nOf these there are many species, some of which attain a large size and\r\nare truly formidable. Phisalix (1897), has made a study of the venom of\r\nthe common hornet and finds that, like the poison of the honey-bee, it\r\nis neither an albuminoid nor an alkaloid. Its toxic properties are\r\ndestroyed at 120^o C. Phisalix also says that the venom is soluble in\r\nalcohol. If this be true, it differs in this respect from that of the\r\nbee. An interesting phase of the work of Phisalix is that several of her\r\nexperiments go to show that the venom of hornets acts as a vaccine\r\nagainst that of vipers.\r\n\r\n\r\nNETTLING INSECTS\r\n\r\nSo far, we have considered insects which possess poison glands connected\r\nwith the mouth-parts or a special sting and which actively inject their\r\npoison into man. There remain to be considered those insects which\r\npossess poisonous hairs or body fluids which, under favorable\r\ncircumstances, may act as poisons. To the first of these belong\r\nprimarily the larvae of certain Lepidoptera.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEPIDOPTERA\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 30. Another innocent but much maligned caterpillar, the\r\nlarva of the Regal moth. Photograph by M. V. S.]\r\n\r\nWhen we consider the reputedly poisonous larvae of moths and butterflies,\r\none of the first things to impress us is that we cannot judge by mere\r\nappearance. Various species of Sphingid, or hawk-moth larvae, bear at the\r\nend of the body a chitinous horn, which is often referred to as a\r\n\"sting\" and regarded as capable of inflicting dangerous wounds. It would\r\nseem unnecessary to refer to this absurd belief if it were not that each\r\nsummer the newspapers contain supposed accounts of injury from the\r\n\"tomato worm\" (fig. 29) and others of this group. The grotesque, spiny\r\nlarva (fig. 30) of one of our largest moths, _Citheronia regalis_ is\r\nmuch feared though perfectly harmless, and similar instances could be\r\nmultiplied.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 31. The flannel moth (Lagoa crispata). (_a_) Poisonous\r\nlarva.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 31. (_b_) Adult. Enlarged. Photographs by M. V. S.]\r\n\r\nBut if the larvae are often misjudged on account of their ferocious\r\nappearance, the reverse may be true. A group of most innocent looking\r\nand attractive caterpillars is that of the flannel-moth larvae, of which\r\n_Lagoa crispata_ may be taken as an example. Its larva (fig. 31) has a\r\nvery short and thick body, which is fleshy and completely covered and\r\nhidden by long silken hairs of a tawny or brown color, giving a convex\r\nform to the upper side. Interspersed among these long hairs are\r\nnumerous short spines connected with underlying hypodermal poison\r\nglands. These hairs are capable of producing a marked nettling effect\r\nwhen they come in contact with the skin. This species is found in our\r\nAtlantic and Southern States. Satisfactory studies of its poisonous\r\nhairs and their glands have not yet been made.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 32 The poisonous saddle back caterpillar. Empretia\r\n(Sibine) stimulea. Photograph by M. V. S.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 33_a_. Io moth larvae on willow. Photograph by M. V. S.]\r\n\r\n_Sibine stimulea (Empretia stimulea)_, or the saddle-back caterpillar\r\n(fig. 32), is another which possesses nettling hairs. This species\r\nbelongs to the group of Eucleidae, or slug caterpillars. It can be\r\nreadily recognized by its flattened form, lateral, bristling spines and\r\nby the large green patch on the back resembling a saddle-cloth, while\r\nthe saddle is represented by an oval, purplish-brown spot. The small\r\nspines are venomous and affect some persons very painfully. The larva\r\nfeeds on the leaves of a large variety of forest trees and also on\r\ncherry, plum, and even corn leaves. It is to be found throughout the\r\nEastern and Southern United States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 33_b_. Io moth. Full grown larva. Photograph by M. V. S.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 34. Io moth. Adult. Photograph by M. V. S.]\r\n\r\n_Automeris io_ is the best known of the nettling caterpillars. It is the\r\nlarva of the Io moth, one of the Saturniidae. The mature caterpillar,\r\n(fig. 33), which reaches a length of two and one-half inches, is of a\r\nbeautiful pale green with sublateral stripes of cream and red color and\r\na few black spines among the green ones. The green radiating spines give\r\nthe body a mossy appearance. They are tipped with a slender chitinous\r\nhair whose tip is readily broken off in the skin and whose poisonous\r\ncontent causes great irritation. Some individuals are very susceptible\r\nto the poison, while others are able to handle the larvae freely without\r\nany discomfort. The larvae feed on a wide range of food plants. They are\r\nmost commonly encountered on corn and on willow, because of the\r\nopportunities for coming in contact with them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 35. Larva of brown-tail moth. (Natural size). Photograph\r\nby M. V. S.]\r\n\r\nThe larvae of the brown-tail moth (_Euproctis chrysorrhoea_) (fig. 35\r\nand 36), where they occur in this country, are, on account of their\r\ngreat numbers, the most serious of all poisonous caterpillars. It is not\r\nnecessary here, to go into details regarding the introduction of this\r\nspecies from Europe into the New England States. This is all available\r\nin the literature from the United States Bureau of Entomology and from\r\nthat of the various states which are fighting the species. Suffice to\r\nsay, there is every prospect that the pest will continue to spread\r\nthroughout the Eastern United States and Canada and that wherever it\r\ngoes it will prove a direct pest to man as well as to his plants.\r\n\r\nVery soon after the introduction of the species there occurred in the\r\nregion where it had gained a foothold, a mysterious dermatitis of man.\r\nThe breaking out which usually occurred on the neck or other exposed\r\npart of the body was always accompanied by an intense itching. It was\r\nsoon found that this dermatitis was caused by certain short, barbed\r\nhairs of the brown-tail caterpillars and that not only the caterpillars\r\nbut their cocoons and even the adult female moths might harbor these\r\nnettling hairs and thus give rise to the irritation. In many cases the\r\nhairs were wafted to clothing on the line and when this was worn it\r\nmight cause the same trouble. Still worse, it was found that very\r\nserious internal injury was often caused by breathing or swallowing the\r\npoisonous hairs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 36. Browntail moths. One male and two females. Photograph\r\nby M. V. S.]\r\n\r\nThe earlier studies seemed to indicate that the irritation was purely\r\nmechanical in origin, the result of the minute barbed hairs working into\r\nthe skin in large numbers. Subsequently, however, Dr. Tyzzer (1907)\r\ndemonstrated beyond question that the trouble was due to a poison\r\ncontained in the hairs. In the first place, it is only the peculiar\r\nshort barbed hairs which will produce the dermatitis when rubbed on the\r\nskin, although most of the other hairs are sharply barbed. Moreover, it\r\nwas found that in various ways the nettling properties could be\r\ndestroyed without modifying the structure of the hairs. This was\r\naccomplished by baking for one hour at 110^o C, by warming to 60^o C in\r\ndistilled water, or by soaking in one per cent. or in one-tenth per\r\ncent. of potassium hydrate or sodium hydrate. The most significant part\r\nof his work was the demonstration of the fact that if the nettling\r\nhairs are mingled with blood, they immediately produce a change in the\r\nred corpuscles. These at once become coarsely crenated, and the roleaux\r\nare broken up in the vicinity of the hair (fig. 37_b_). The corpuscles\r\ndecrease in size, the coarse crenations are transformed into slender\r\nspines which rapidly disappear, leaving the corpuscles in the form of\r\nspheres, the light refraction of which contrasts them sharply with the\r\nnormal corpuscles. The reaction always begins at the basal sharp point\r\nof the hair. It could not be produced by purely mechanical means, such\r\nas the mingling of minute particles of glass wool, the barbed hairs of a\r\ntussock moth, or the other coarser hairs of the brown-tail, with the\r\nblood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 37. (_a_) Ordinary hairs and three poison hairs of\r\nsubdorsal and lateral tubercles of the larva of the browntail moth.\r\nDrawing by Miss Kephart.]\r\n\r\nThe question of the source of the poison has been studied in our\r\nlaboratory by Miss Cornelia Kephart. She first confirmed Dr. Tyzzer's\r\ngeneral results and then studied carefully fixed specimens of the larvae\r\nto determine the distribution of the hairs and their relation to the\r\nunderlying tissues.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 37. (_b_) Effect of the poison on the blood corpuscles of\r\nman. After Tyzzer.]\r\n\r\nThe poison hairs (fig. 37), are found on the subdorsal and lateral\r\ntubercles (fig. 38), in bunches of from three to twelve on the minute\r\npapillae with which the tubercles are thickly covered. The underlying\r\nhypodermis is very greatly thickened, the cells being three or four\r\ntimes the length of the ordinary hypodermal cells and being closely\r\ncrowded together. Instead of a pore canal through the cuticula for each\r\nindividual hair, there is a single pore for each papillae on a tubercle,\r\nall the hairs of the papilla being connected with the underlying cells\r\nthrough the same pore canal, (figs. 39 and 40).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 38. Cross section of the larva of the browntail moth\r\nshowing the tubercles bearing the poison hairs. Drawing by Miss\r\nKephart.]\r\n\r\nThe hypodermis of this region is of two distinct types of cells. First,\r\nthere is a group of slender fusiform cells, one for each poison hair on\r\nthe papilla, which are the trichogen, or hair-formative cells. They are\r\ncrowded to one side and towards the basement membrane by a series of\r\nmuch larger, and more prominent cells (fig. 40), of which there is a\r\nsingle one for each papilla. These larger cells have a granular\r\nprotoplasm with large nuclei and are obviously actively secreting. They\r\nare so characteristic in appearance as to leave no question but that\r\nthey are the true poison glands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 39. Epithelium underlying poison hairs of the larva of\r\nthe browntail moth. Drawing by Miss Kephart.]\r\n\r\nPoisonous larvae of many other species have been reported from Europe and\r\nespecially from the tropics but the above-mentioned species are the more\r\nimportant of those occurring in the United States and will serve as\r\ntypes. It should be noted in this connection that through some curious\r\nmisunderstanding Goeldi (1913) has featured the larva of _Orgyia\r\nleucostigma_, the white-marked tussock moth, as the most important of\r\nthe poisonous caterpillars of this country. Though there are occasional\r\nreports of irritation from its hairs such cases are rare and there is no\r\nevidence that there is any poison present. Indeed, subcutaneous\r\nimplantation of the hairs leads to no poisoning, but merely to temporary\r\nirritation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 40. Same as figure 39, on larger scale.]\r\n\r\nOccasionally, the hairs of certain species of caterpillars find\r\nlodgement in the conjunctiva, cornea, or iris of the eye of man and give\r\nrise to the condition known as _opthalmia nodosa_. The essential feature\r\nof this trouble is a nodular conjunctivitis which simulates tuberculosis\r\nof the conjunctiva and hence has been called _pseudo-tubercular_. It may\r\nbe distinguished microscopically by the presence of the hairs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 41. (_a_) Nodular conjunctivitis in the eye of a child.\r\nDe Schweinitz and Shumway.]\r\n\r\nNumerous cases of opthalmia nodosa are on record. Of those from this\r\ncountry, one of the most interesting is reported by de Schweinitz and\r\nShumway (1904). It is that of a child of fifteen years whose eye had\r\nbecome inflamed owing to the presence of some foreign body. Downward and\r\ninward on the bulbar conjunctiva were a number of flattened,\r\ngrayish-yellow nodules, between which was a marked congestion of the\r\nconjunctival and episcleral vessels (fig. 41_a_). Twenty-seven nodules\r\ncould be differentiated, those directly in the center of the collection\r\nbeing somewhat confluent and assuming a crescentic and circular\r\nappearance. The nodules were excised and, on sectioning, were found to\r\nbe composed of a layer of spindle cells and round cells, outside of\r\nwhich the tissue was condensed into a capsule. The interior consisted of\r\nepithelioid cells, between which was a considerable intercellular\r\nsubstance. Directly in the center of a certain number of nodules was\r\nfound the section of a hair (fig. 41_b_). The evidence indicated that\r\nthe injury had resulted from playing with caterpillars of one of the\r\nArctiid moths, _Spilosoma virginica_. Other reported cases have been\r\ncaused by the hairs of larvae of _Lasiocampa rubi_, _L. pini_,\r\n_Porthetria dispar_, _Psilura monacha_ and _Cnethocampa processionea_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 41_b_. Section through one of the nodules showing the\r\ncaterpillar hair. De Schweinitz and Shumway.]\r\n\r\n\r\nRELIEF FROM POISONING BY NETTLING LARVAE--The irritation from nettling\r\nlarvae is often severe and, especially in regions where the brown-tail\r\nabounds, inquiries as to treatment arise. In general, it may be said\r\nthat cooling lotions afford relief, and that scratching, with the\r\npossibilities of secondary infection, should be avoided, in so far as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nAmong the remedies usually at hand, weak solutions of ammonia, or a\r\npaste of ordinary baking soda are helpful. Castellani and Chalmers\r\nrecommend cleaning away the hairs by bathing the region with an alkaline\r\nlotion, such as two per cent solution of bicarbonate of soda, and then\r\napplying an ointment of ichthyol (10%).\r\n\r\nIn the brown-tail district, there are many proprietary remedies of which\r\nthe best ones are essentially the following, as recommended by Kirkland\r\n(1907):\r\n\r\n    Carbolic acid  1/2 drachm.\r\n    Zinc oxide     1/2 oz.\r\n    Lime water       8 oz.\r\n\r\nShake thoroughly and rub well into the affected parts.\r\n\r\nIn some cases, and especially where there is danger of secondary\r\ninfection, the use of a weak solution of creoline (one teaspoonful to a\r\nquart of water), is to be advised.\r\n\r\n\r\nVESCICATING INSECTS AND THOSE POSSESSING OTHER POISONS IN THEIR BLOOD\r\nPLASMA\r\n\r\nWe have seen that certain forms, for example, the poisonous spiders, not\r\nonly secrete a toxine in their poison glands, but that such a substance\r\nmay be extracted from other parts of their body, or even their eggs.\r\nThere are many insects which likewise possess a poisonous blood plasma.\r\nSuch forms have been well designated by Taschenberg as _cryptotoxic_\r\n([Greek: kryptos] = hidden). We shall consider a few representative\r\nforms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 42_a_. Blister beetle.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 42_b_. An American blister beetle. Meloe angusticollis.\r\nPhotograph by M. V. S.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BLISTER BEETLES--Foremost among the cryptotoxic insects are the\r\n_Meloidae_ or \"blister beetles,\" to which the well-known \"Spanish fly\"\r\n(fig. 42_a_), formerly very generally used in medical practice, belongs.\r\nThe vescicating property is due to the presence in the blood plasma of a\r\npeculiar, volatile, crystalline substance known as _cantharidin_, which\r\nis especially abundant in the reproductive organs of the beetle.\r\nAccording to Kobert, the amount of this varies in different species from\r\n.4 or .5% to 2.57% of the dry weight of the beetle.\r\n\r\nWhile blister beetles have been especially used for external\r\napplication, they are also at times used internally as a stimulant and a\r\ndiuretic. The powder or extract was formerly much in vogue as an\r\naphrodisiac, and formed the essential constituent of various philters,\r\nor \"love powders\". It is now known that its effects on the reproductive\r\norgans appear primarily after the kidneys have been affected to such an\r\nextent as to endanger life, and that many cases of fatal poison have\r\nbeen due to its ignorant use.\r\n\r\nThere are many cases on record of poisoning and death due to internal\r\nuse, and in some instances from merely external application. There are\r\nnot rarely cases of poisoning of cattle from feeding on herbage bearing\r\na large number of the beetles and authentic cases are known of human\r\nbeings who have been poisoned by eating the flesh of such cattle. Kobert\r\nstates that the beetles are not poisonous to birds but that the flesh of\r\nbirds which have fed on them is poisonous to man, and that if the flesh\r\nof chickens or frogs which have fed on the cantharidin be fed to cats it\r\ncauses in them the same symptoms as does the cantharidin.\r\n\r\nTreatment of cases of cantharidin poison is a matter for a skilled\r\nphysician. Until he can be obtained, emetics should be administered and\r\nthese should be followed by white of egg in water. Oils should be\r\navoided, as they hasten the absorption of the poison.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER CRYPTOTOXIC INSECTS--Though the blister beetles are the best known\r\nof the insects with poisonous blood plasma, various others have been\r\nreported and we shall refer to a few of the best authenticated.\r\n\r\nOne of the most famous is the Chrysomelid beetle, _Diamphidia simplex_,\r\nthe body fluids of whose larvae are used by certain South African bushmen\r\nas an arrow poison. Its action is due to the presence of a toxalbumin\r\nwhich exerts a haemolytic action on the blood, and produces inflammation\r\nof the subcutaneous connective tissue and mucous membranes. Death\r\nresults from general paralysis. Krause (1907) has surmised that the\r\nactive principle may be a bacterial toxin arising from decomposition of\r\nthe tissues of the larva, but he presents no support of this view and it\r\nis opposed by all the available evidence.\r\n\r\nIn China, a bug, _Heuchis sanguinea_, belonging to the family Cicadidae,\r\nis used like the Meloidae, to produce blistering, and often causes\r\npoisoning. It has been assumed that its vescicating properties are due\r\nto cantharidin, but the presence of this substance has not been\r\ndemonstrated.\r\n\r\nCertain Aphididae contain a strongly irritating substance which produces,\r\nnot merely on mucous membranes but on outer skin, a characteristic\r\ninflammation.\r\n\r\nIt has been frequently reported that the larvae of the European cabbage\r\nbutterfly, _Pieris brassicae_, accidentally eaten by cows, horses, ducks,\r\nand other domestic animals, cause severe colic, attempts to vomit,\r\nparalysis of the hind legs, salivation, and stomatitis. On _postmortem_\r\nthere are to be found haemorrhagic gastro-enteritis, splenitis, and\r\nnephritis. Kobert has recently investigated the subject and has found a\r\npoisonous substance in the blood of not only the larvae but also the\r\npupae.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[A] This is diametrically opposed to the findings of Bordas (1905) in\r\nthe case of the European _Latrodectus 13-guttatus_, whose glands are\r\n\"much larger than those of other spiders.\" From a considerable\r\ncomparative study, we should also unhesitatingly make this statement\r\nregarding the glands of our American species, _L. mactans_.\r\n\r\n[B] Dr. E. H. Coleman (Kellogg, 1915) has demonstrated its virulence by\r\na series of experiments comparable with those of Kobert.\r\n\r\n[C] According to Stiles, the species occurring in the Northwest which is\r\ncommonly identified as _D. venustus_ should be called _D. andersoni_\r\n(see footnote, chapter 12).\r\n\r\n[D] It should be remembered that in all the higher Hymenoptera the first\r\nabdominal segment is fused with the thorax and that what is apparently\r\nthe sixth segment is, in reality, the seventh.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nPARASITIC ARTHROPODA AFFECTING MAN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe relation of insects to man as simple parasites has long been\r\nstudied, and until very recent years the bulk of the literature of\r\nmedical entomology referred to this phase of the subject. This is now\r\ncompletely overshadowed by the fact that so many of these parasitic\r\nforms are more than simple parasites, they are transmitters of other\r\nmicroscopic parasites which are pathogenic to man. Yet the importance of\r\ninsects as parasites still remains and must be considered in a\r\ndiscussion of the relation of insects to the health of man. In taking up\r\nthe subject we shall first consider some general features of the\r\nphenomenon of animal parasitism.\r\n\r\nParasitism is an adaptation which has originated very often among living\r\norganisms and in widely separated groups. It would seem simple to define\r\nwhat is meant by a \"parasite\" but, in reality, the term is not easily\r\nlimited. It is often stated that a parasite is \"An organism which lives\r\nat the expense of another,\" but this definition is applicable to a\r\npredatory species or, in its broadest sense, to all organisms. For our\r\npurpose we may say with Braun: \"A parasite is an organism which, for the\r\npurpose of obtaining food, takes up its abode, temporarily or\r\npermanently, on or within another living organism\".\r\n\r\nThus, parasitism is a phase of the broad biological phenomenon of\r\n_symbiosis_, or living together of organisms. It is distinguished from\r\n_mutualism_, or symbiosis in the narrow sense, by the fact that only one\r\nparty to the arrangement obtains any advantage, while the other is to a\r\ngreater or less extent injured.\r\n\r\nOf parasites we may distinguish on the basis of their location on or in\r\nthe host, _ecto-parasites_, which live outside of the body; and\r\n_endo-parasites_, which live within the body. On account of their method\r\nof breathing the parasitic arthropods belong almost exclusively to the\r\nfirst of these groups.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of relation to their host, we find _temporary parasites_,\r\nthose which seek the host only occasionally, to obtain food; and the\r\n_stationary_ or _permanent_ parasites which, at least during certain\r\nstages, do not leave their host.\r\n\r\n_Facultative parasites_ are forms which are not normally parasitic, but\r\nwhich, when accidentally ingested, or otherwise brought into the body,\r\nare able to exist for a greater or less period of time in their unusual\r\nenvironment. These are generally called in the medical literature\r\n\"pseudoparasites\" but the term is an unfortunate one.\r\n\r\nWe shall now take up the different groups of arthropods, discussing the\r\nmore important of the parasitic forms attacking man. The systematic\r\nrelationship of these forms, and key for determining important species\r\nwill be found in Chapter XII.\r\n\r\n\r\nACARINA OR MITES\r\n\r\nThe ACARINA, or _mites_, form a fairly natural group of arachnids,\r\ncharacterized, in general, by a sac-like, unsegmented body which is\r\ngenerally fused with the cephalothorax. The mouth-parts have been united\r\nto form a beak or rostrum.\r\n\r\nThe representatives of this group undergo a marked metamorphosis.\r\nCommonly, the larvae on hatching from the egg, possess but three pairs of\r\nlegs, and hence are called _hexapod larvae_. After a molt, they transform\r\ninto nymphs which, like the adult, have four pairs of legs and are\r\ncalled _octopod nymphs_. These after a period of growth, molt one or\r\nmore times and, acquiring external sexual organs, become adult.\r\n\r\nMost of the mites are free-living, but there are many parasitic species\r\nand as these have originated in widely separated families, the Acarina\r\nform an especially favorable group for study of the origin of\r\nparasitism. Such a study has been made by Ewing (1911), who has reached\r\nthe following conclusions:\r\n\r\n\"We have strong evidence indicating that the parasitic habit has\r\noriginated independently at least eleven times in the phylogeny of the\r\nArarina. Among the zoophagous parasites, the parasitic habit has been\r\ndeveloped from three different types of free-living Acarina: (a)\r\npredaceous forms, (b) scavengers, (c) forms living upon the juices of\r\nplants.\"\r\n\r\nEwing also showed that among the living forms of Acarina we can trace\r\nout all the stages of advancing parasitism, semiparasitism, facultative\r\nparasitism, even to the fixed and permanent type, and finally to\r\nendoparasitism.\r\n\r\nOf the many parasitic forms, there are several species which are serious\r\nparasites of man and we shall consider the more important of these.\r\nInfestation by mites is technically known as _acariasis_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 43. Effect of the harvest mites on the skin of man.\r\nPhotograph by J. C. Bradley.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Trombidiidae, or Harvest Mites\r\n\r\nIn many parts of this country it is impossible for a visitor to go into\r\nthe fields and, particularly, into berry patches and among tall weeds\r\nand grass in the summer or early fall without being affected by an\r\nintolerable itching, which is followed, later, by a breaking out of\r\nwheals, or papules, surrounded by a bright red or violaceous aureola,\r\n(fig. 43). It is often regarded as a urticaria or eczema, produced by\r\nchange of climate, an error in diet, or some condition of general\r\nhealth.\r\n\r\nSooner or later, the victim finds that it is due to none of these, but\r\nto the attacks of an almost microscopic red mite, usually called\r\n\"jigger\" or \"chigger\" in this country. As the term \"chigger\" is applied\r\nto one of the true fleas, _Dermatophilus penetrans_, of the tropics,\r\nthese forms are more correctly known as \"harvest mites.\" Natives of an\r\ninfested region may be so immune or accustomed to its attacks as to be\r\nunaware of its presence, though such immunity is by no means possessed\r\nby all who have been long exposed to the annoyance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 44. Harvest mites. (Larvae of Trombidium). After C. V.\r\nRiley.]\r\n\r\nThe harvest mites, or chiggers, attacking man are larval forms,\r\npossessing three pairs of legs (fig. 44). Their systematic position was\r\nat first unknown and they were classed under a special genus _Leptus_, a\r\nname which is very commonly still retained in the medical literature. It\r\nis now known that they are the larval forms of various species of the\r\ngenus _Trombidium_, a group of predaceous forms, the adults of which\r\nfeed primarily on insects and their eggs. In this country the species\r\nbest known are those to be found late in summer, as larvae at the base of\r\nthe wings of houseflies or grasshoppers.\r\n\r\nThere is much uncertainty as to the species of the larvae attacking man\r\nbut it is clear that several are implicated. Bruyant has shown that in\r\nFrance the larvae _Trombidium inapinatum_ and _Trombidium holosericeum_\r\nare those most frequently found. The habit of attacking man is abnormal\r\nand the larvae die after entering the skin. Normally they are parasitic\r\non various insects.\r\n\r\nMost recent writers agree that, on man, they do not bore into the skin,\r\nas is generally supposed, but enter a hair follicle or sebaceous gland\r\nand from the bottom of this, pierce the cutis with their elongate\r\nhypopharynx. According to Braun, there arises about the inserted\r\nhypopharynx a fibrous secretion--the so-called \"beak\" which is, in\r\nreality, a product of the host. Dr. J. C. Bradley, however, has made\r\ncareful observations on their method of attack, and he assures us that\r\nthe mite ordinarily remains for a long time feeding on the surface of\r\nthe skin, where it produces the erythema above described. During this\r\ntime it is not buried in the skin but is able to retreat rapidly into it\r\nthrough a hair follicle or sweat gland. The irritation from the mites\r\nceases after a few days, but not infrequently the intolerable itching\r\nleads to so much scratching that secondary infection follows.\r\n\r\nRelief from the irritation may be afforded by taking a warm salt bath as\r\nsoon as possible after exposure or by killing the mites by application\r\nof benzine, sulphur ointment or carbolized vaseline. When they are few\r\nin number, they can be picked out with a sterile needle.\r\n\r\nMuch may be done in the way of warding off their attacks by wearing\r\ngaiters or close-woven stockings extending from ankle to the knee. Still\r\nmore efficacious is the sprinkling of flowers of sulphur in the\r\nstockings and the underclothes from a little above the knee, down. The\r\nwriters have known this to make it possible for persons who were\r\nespecially susceptible to work with perfect comfort in badly infested\r\nregions. Powdered naphthalene is successfully used in the same way and\r\nas Chittenden (1906) points out, is a safeguard against various forms of\r\nman-infesting tropical insect pests.\r\n\r\nThe question of the destruction of the mites in the field is sometimes\r\nan important one, and under some conditions, is feasible. Chittenden\r\nstates that much can be accomplished by keeping the grass, weeds, and\r\nuseless herbage mowed closely, so as to expose the mites to the sun. He\r\nbelieves that in some cases good may be done by dusting the grass and\r\nother plants, after cutting, with flowers of sulphur or by spraying with\r\ndilute kerosene emulsion in which sulphur has been mixed. More recently\r\n(1914) he calls attention to the value of cattle, and more especially\r\nsheep, in destroying the pests by tramping on them and by keeping the\r\ngrass and herbage closely cropped.\r\n\r\n\r\nIXODOIDEA OR TICKS\r\n\r\nUntil recently, the ticks attracted comparatively little attention from\r\nentomologists. Since their importance as carriers of disease has been\r\nestablished, interest in the group has been enormously stimulated and\r\nnow they rank second only to the mosquitoes in the amount of detailed\r\nstudy that has been devoted to them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 45_a_. Argus persicus. Capitulum of male. After Nuttall\r\nand Warburton.]\r\n\r\nThe ticks are the largest of the Acarina. They are characterized by the\r\nfact that the hypostome, or \"tongue\" (fig. 45) is large and file-like,\r\nroughened by sharp teeth. They possess a breathing pore on each side of\r\nthe body, above the third or fourth coxae (fig. 45_b_).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 45_b_. Left spiracle of nymph of _Argas persicus_. After\r\nNuttall and Warburton.]\r\n\r\nThere are two distinct families of the IXODOIDEA, differing greatly in\r\nstructure, life-history and habits. These are the ARGASIDAE and the\r\nIXODIDAE. We shall follow Nuttall (1908) in characterizing these two\r\nfamilies and in pointing out their biological differences, and shall\r\ndiscuss briefly the more important species which attack man. The\r\nconsideration of the ticks as carriers of disease will be reserved for a\r\nlater chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nArgasidae\r\n\r\nIn the ticks belonging to the family ARGASIDAE, there is comparatively\r\nlittle sexual dimorphism, while this is very marked in the Ixodidae. The\r\ncapitulum, or so-called \"head\" is ventral, instead of terminal; the\r\npalpi are leg-like, with the segments subequal; the scutum, or dorsal\r\nshield, is absent; eyes, when present, are lateral, on supracoxal folds.\r\nThe spiracles are very small; coxae unarmed; tarsi without ventral\r\nspurs, and the pulvilli are absent or rudimentary.\r\n\r\nIn habits and life history the Argasidae present striking\r\ncharacteristics. In the first place, they are long-lived, a factor which\r\ncounts for much in the maintenance of the species. They are intermittent\r\nfeeders, being comparable with the bed-bug in this respect. There are\r\ntwo or more nymphal stages, and they may molt after attaining maturity.\r\nThe female lays comparatively few eggs in several small batches.\r\n\r\nNuttall (1911) concludes that \"The Argasidae represent the relatively\r\nprimitive type of ticks because they are less constantly parasitic than\r\nare the Ixodidae. Their nymphs and adults are rapid feeders and chiefly\r\ninfest the habitat of their hosts. * * * Owing to the Argasidae infesting\r\nthe habitats of their hosts, their resistance to prolonged starvation\r\nand their rapid feeding habits, they do not need to bring forth a large\r\nprogeny, because there is less loss of life in the various stages, as\r\ncompared with the Ixodidae, prior to their attaining maturity.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 46. Argus persicus. Dorsal and ventral aspects. (x4).\r\nAfter Hassell.]\r\n\r\nOf the Argasidae, we have in the United States, several species which\r\nhave been reported as attacking man.\r\n\r\n_Argas persicus_, the famous \"Miana bug\" (fig. 46), is a very widely\r\ndistributed species, being reported from Europe, Asia, Africa, and\r\nAustralia. It is everywhere preeminently a parasite of fowls. According\r\nto Nuttall it is specifically identical with _Argas americanus_ Packard\r\nor _Argas miniatus_ Koch, which is commonly found on fowls in the United\r\nStates, in the South and Southwest. Its habits are comparable to those\r\nof the bed-bug. It feeds intermittently, primarily at night, and instead\r\nof remaining on its host, it then retreats to cracks and crevices.\r\nHunter and Hooker (1908) record that they have found the larva to remain\r\nattached for five or eight days before dropping. Unlike the Ixodidae, the\r\nadults oviposit frequently.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 47. Otiobius (Ornithodoros) megnini, head of nymph. After\r\nStiles.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 48. Otiobius (Ornithodoros) megnini, male. (_a_) dorsal,\r\n(_b_) ventral aspect. After Nuttall and Warburton.]\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable feature of the biology of this species is the great\r\nlongevity, especially of the adult. Hunter and Hooker report keeping\r\nlarvae confined in summer in pill boxes immediately after hatching for\r\nabout two months while under similar conditions those of the Ixodid,\r\n_Boophilus annulatus_ lived for but two or three days. Many writers have\r\nrecorded keeping adults for long periods without food. We have kept\r\nspecimens in a tin box for over a year and a half and at the end of that\r\ntime a number were still alive. Laboulliene kept unfed adults for over\r\nthree years. In view of the effectiveness of sulphur in warding off the\r\nattacks of Trombidiidae, it is astonishing to find that Lounsbury has\r\nkept adults of _Argas persicus_ for three months in a box nearly filled\r\nwith flowers of sulphur, with no apparent effect on them.\r\n\r\nWe have already called attention to the occasional serious effects of\r\nthe bites of this species. While such reports have been frequently\r\ndiscredited there can be no doubt that they have foundation in fact. The\r\nreadiness with which this tick attacks man, and the extent to which old\r\nhuts may be infested makes it especially troublesome.\r\n\r\n_Otiobius (Ornithodoros) megnini_, the \"spinose ear-tick\" (figs. 47,\r\n48), first described from Mexico, as occurring in the ears of horses, is\r\na common species in our Southwestern States and is recorded by Banks as\r\noccurring as far north as Iowa.\r\n\r\nThe species is remarkable for the great difference between the spiny\r\nnymph stage and the adult. The life history has been worked out by\r\nHooker (1908). Seed ticks, having gained entrance to the ear, attach\r\ndeeply down in the folds, engorge, and in about five days, molt; as\r\nnymphs with their spinose body they appear entirely unlike the larvae. As\r\nnymphs they continue feeding sometimes for months. Finally the nymph\r\nleaves the host, molts to form the unspined adult, and without further\r\nfeeding is fertilized and commences oviposition.\r\n\r\nThe common name is due to the fact that in the young stage the ticks\r\noccur in the ear of their hosts, usually horses or cattle. Not\r\nuncommonly it has been reported as occurring in the ear of man and\r\ncausing very severe pain. Stiles recommends that it be removed by\r\npouring some bland oil into the ear.\r\n\r\nBanks (1908) reports three species of _Ornithodoros_--_O. turicata_,\r\n_coriaceus_ and _talaje_--as occurring in the United States. All of these\r\nattack man and are capable of inflicting very painful bites.\r\n\r\n\r\nIxodidae\r\n\r\nThe ticks belonging to the family IXODIDAE (figs. 49 and 50) exhibit a\r\nmarked sexual dimorphism. The capitulum is anterior, terminal, instead\r\nof ventral as in the Argasidae; the palpi are relatively rigid (except in\r\nthe subfamily Ixodinae), with rudimentary fourth segment; scutum present;\r\neyes, when present, dorsal, on side of scutum. The spiracles are\r\ngenerally large, situated well behind the fourth coxae; coxae generally\r\nwith spurs; pulvilli always present.\r\n\r\nIn habits and life history the typical Ixodidae differ greatly from\r\nthe Argasidae. They are relatively short-lived, though some recent\r\nwork indicates that their longevity has been considerably\r\nunder-estimated. Typically, they are permanent feeders, remaining on the\r\nhost, or hosts, during the greater part of their life. They molt twice\r\nonly, on leaving the larval and the nymphal stages. The adult female\r\ndeposits a single, large batch of eggs. Contrasting the habits of the\r\nIxodidae to those of the Argasidae, Nuttall (1911) emphasizes that\r\nthe Ixodidae are more highly specialized parasites. \"The majority are\r\nparasitic on hosts having no fixed habitat and consequently all stages,\r\nas a rule, occur upon the host.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 49. Ixodes ricinus; male, ventral aspect. After Braun and\r\nLuehe.]\r\n\r\nAs mere parasites of man, apart from their power to transmit disease,\r\nthe Ixodidae are much less important than the Argasidae. Many are\r\nreported as occasionally attacking man and of these the following native\r\nspecies may be mentioned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 50. Ixodes ricinus, var. scapularis, female. Capitulum\r\nand scutum; ventral aspect of capitulum; coxae; tarsus 4; spiracle;\r\ngenital and anal grooves. After Nuttall and Warburton.]\r\n\r\n_Ixodes ricinus_, the European castor bean tick (figs. 49, 50), is a\r\nspecies which has been often reported from this country but Banks (1908)\r\nhas shown that, though it does occur, practically all of the records\r\napply to _Ixodes scapularis_ or _Ixodes cookei_. In Europe, _Ixodes\r\nricinus_ is very abundant and very commonly attacks man. At the point\r\nof penetration of the hypostome there is more or less inflammation but\r\nserious injury does not occur unless there have been introduced\r\npathogenic bacteria or, unless the tick has been abruptly removed,\r\nleaving the capitulum in the wound. Under the latter circumstances,\r\nthere may be an abscess formed about the foreign body and occasionally,\r\nserious results have followed. Under certain conditions the tick, in\r\nvarious stages, may penetrate under the skin and produce a tumor, within\r\nwhich it may survive for a considerable period of time.\r\n\r\n_Ixodes cookei_ is given by Banks as \"common on mammals in the Eastern\r\nStates as far west as the Rockies.\" It is said to affect man severely.\r\n\r\n_Amblyomma americanum_, (fig. 158c), the \"lone star tick,\" is widely\r\ndistributed in the United States. Its common name is derived from the\r\nsingle silvery spot on the scutum of the female. Hunter and Hooker\r\nregard this species as, next to _Boophilus annulatus_, the most\r\nimportant tick in the United States. Though more common on cattle, it\r\nappears to attack mammals generally, and \"in portions of Louisiana and\r\nTexas it becomes a pest of considerable importance to moss gatherers and\r\nother persons who spend much time in the forests.\"\r\n\r\n_Amblyomma cajennense_, noted as a pest of man in central and tropical\r\nAmerica, is reported from various places in the south and southwestern\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n_Dermacentor variabilis_ is a common dog tick of the eastern United\r\nStates. It frequently attacks man, but the direct effects of its bite\r\nare negligible.\r\n\r\nThe \"Rocky Mountain spotted fever tick\" (_Dermacentor andersoni_\r\naccording to Stiles, _D. venustus_ according to Banks) is, from the\r\nviewpoint of its effects on man, the most important of the ticks of the\r\nUnited States. This is because, as has been clearly established, it\r\ntransmits the so-called \"spotted fever\" of man in our northwestern\r\nstates. This phase of the subject will be discussed later and it need\r\nmerely be mentioned here, that this species has been reported as causing\r\npainful injuries by its bites. Dr. Stiles states that he has seen cases\r\nof rather severe lymphangitis and various sores and swellings developing\r\nfrom this cause. In one case, of an individual bitten near the elbow,\r\nthe arm became very much swollen and the patient was confined in bed for\r\nseveral days. The so-called tick paralysis produced by this species is\r\ndiscussed in a preceding chapter.\r\n\r\nThere are many other records of various species of ticks attacking man,\r\nbut the above-mentioned will serve as typical and it is not necessary to\r\nenter into greater detail.\r\n\r\n\r\nTREATMENT OF TICK BITES--When a tick attaches to man the first thing to\r\nbe done is to remove it without leaving the hypostome in the wound to\r\nfester and bring about secondary effects. This is best accomplished by\r\napplying to the tick's body some substance which will cause it to more\r\nreadily loosen its hold. Gasoline or petroleum, oil or vaseline will\r\nserve. For removing the spinose ear-tick, Stiles recommends pouring some\r\nbland oil into the ear. Others have used effectively a pledget of cotton\r\nsoaked in chloroform.\r\n\r\nIn general, the treatment recommended by Wellman for the bites of\r\n_Ornithodoros moubata_ will prove helpful. It consists of prolonged\r\nbathing in very hot water, followed by the application of a strong\r\nsolution of bicarbonate of soda, which is allowed to dry upon the skin.\r\nHe states that this treatment is comforting. For severe itching he\r\nadvises smearing the bites with vaseline, which is slightly impregnated\r\nwith camphor or menthol. Medical aid should be sought when complications\r\narise.\r\n\r\nThe DERMANYSSIDAE are Gamasid mites which differ from others of the group\r\nin that they are parasitic on vertebrates. None of the species normally\r\nattack man, but certain of them, especially the poultry mite, may be\r\naccidental annoyances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 51. Dermanyssus gallinae, female. After Delafond.]\r\n\r\n_Dermanyssus gallinae_ (fig. 51), the red mite of poultry, is an\r\nexceedingly common and widespread parasite of fowls. During the day it\r\nlives in cracks and crevices of poultry houses, under supports of\r\nroosts, and in litter of the food and nests, coming out at night to\r\nfeed. They often attack people working in poultry houses or handling\r\nand plucking infested fowls. They may cause an intense pruritis, but\r\nthey do not produce a true dermatosis, for they do not find conditions\r\nfavorable for multiplication on the skin of man.\r\n\r\n\r\nTarsonemidae\r\n\r\nThe representatives of the family TARSONEMIDAE are minute mites, with the\r\nbody divided into cephalothorax and abdomen. There is marked sexual\r\ndimorphism. The females possess stigmata at the anterior part of the\r\nbody, at the base of the rostrum, and differ from all other mites in\r\nhaving on each side, a prominent clavate organ between the first and\r\nsecond legs. The larva, when it exists, is hexapodous and resembles the\r\nadult. A number of the species are true parasites on insects, while\r\nothers attack plants. Several of them may be accidental parasites of\r\nman.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 52. Pediculoides ventricosus, female. After Webster.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 53. Pediculoides ventricosus, gravid female. (x80).\r\nAfter Webster.]\r\n\r\n_Pediculoides ventricosus_ (fig. 52 and 53) is, of all the\r\nTarsonemidae reported, the one which has proved most troublesome to\r\nman. It is a predaceous species which attacks a large number of insects\r\nbut which has most commonly been met with by man through its fondness\r\nfor certain grain-infesting insects, notably the Angoumois grain moth,\r\n_Sitotroga cerealella_, and the wheat straw-worm, _Isosoma grande_. In\r\nrecent years it has attracted much attention in the United States and\r\nits distribution and habits have been the object of detailed study by\r\nWebster (1901).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 54. Pediculoides ventricosus, male. After Braun.]\r\n\r\nThere is a very striking sexual dimorphism in this species. The\r\nnon-gravid female is elongate, about 200u by 70u (fig. 52), with the\r\nabdomen slightly striated longitudinally. The gravid female (fig. 53)\r\nhas the abdomen enormously swollen, so that it is from twenty to a\r\nhundred times greater than the rest of the body. The species is\r\nviviparous and the larvae undergo their entire growth in the body of the\r\nmother. They emerge as sexually mature males and females which soon\r\npair. The male (fig. 54) is much smaller, reaching a length of only 320u\r\nbut is relatively broad, 80u, and angular. Its abdomen is very greatly\r\nreduced.\r\n\r\nAs far back as 1850 it was noted as causing serious outbreaks of\r\npeculiar dermatitis among men handling infested grain. For some time the\r\ntrue source of the difficulty was unknown and it was even believed that\r\nthe grain had been poisoned. Webster has shown that in this country (and\r\nprobably in Europe as well) its attacks have been mistaken for those of\r\nthe red bugs or \"chiggers\" (larval Trombiidae). More recently a number of\r\noutbreaks of a mysterious \"skin disease\" were traced to the use of straw\r\nmattresses, which were found to be swarming with these almost\r\nmicroscopic forms which had turned their attentions to the occupants of\r\nthe beds. Other cases cited were those of farmers running wheat through\r\na fanning mill, and of thrashers engaged in feeding unthrashed grain\r\ninto the cylinder of the machine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 55. Lesions produced by the attacks of Pediculoides\r\nventricosus. After Webster.]\r\n\r\nThe medical aspects of the question have been studied especially by\r\nSchamberg and Goldberger and from the latter's summary (1910) we derive\r\nthe following data. Within twelve to sixteen hours after exposure,\r\nitching appears and in severe cases, especially where exposure is\r\ncontinued night after night by sleeping on an infested bed, the itching\r\nmay become almost intolerable. Simultaneously, there appears an eruption\r\nwhich characteristically consists of wheals surrounded by a vesicle\r\n(fig. 55). The vesicle as a rule does not exceed a pin head in size but\r\nmay become as large as a pea. Its contents rapidly become turbid and in\r\na few hours it is converted into a pustule. The eruption is most\r\nabundant on the trunk, slight on the face and extremities and almost\r\nabsent on the feet and hands. In severe cases there may be\r\nconstitutional disturbances marked, at the outset, by chilliness,\r\nnausea, and vomiting, followed for a few days by a slight elevation of\r\ntemperature, with the appearance of albumin in the urine. In some cases\r\nthe eruption may simulate that of chicken-pox or small-pox.\r\n\r\nTreatment for the purpose of killing the mites is hardly necessary as\r\nthey attach feebly to the surface and are readily brushed off by\r\nfriction of the clothes. \"Antipruritic treatment is always called for;\r\nwarm, mildly alkaline baths or some soothing ointment, such as zinc\r\noxide will be found to fulfil this indication.\" Of course, reinfestation\r\nmust be guarded against, by discarding, or thoroughly fumigating\r\ninfested mattresses, or by avoiding other sources. Goldberger suggests\r\nthat farm laborers who must work with infested wheat or straw might\r\nprotect themselves by anointing the body freely with some bland oil or\r\ngrease, followed by a change of clothes and bath as soon as their work\r\nis done. We are not aware of any experiments to determine the effect of\r\nflowers of sulphur, but their efficiency in the case of \"red bugs\"\r\nsuggests that they are worth a trial against _Pediculoides_.\r\n\r\nVarious species of TYROGLYPHIDAE (fig. 150_f_) may abound on dried fruits\r\nand other products and attacking persons handling them, may cause a\r\nsevere dermatitis, comparable to that described above for _Pediculoides\r\nventricosus_. Many instances of their occurrence as such temporary\r\nectoparasites are on record. Thus, workers who handle vanilla pods are\r\nsubject to a severe dermatitis, known as vanillism, which is due to the\r\nattacks of _Tyroglyphus siro_, or a closely related species. The\r\nso-called \"grocer's itch\" is similarly caused by mites infesting various\r\nproducts. Castellani has shown that in Ceylon, workers employed in the\r\ncopra mills, where dried cocoanut is ground up for export, are much\r\nannoyed by mites, which produce the so-called \"copra itch.\" The skin of\r\nthe hands, arms and legs, and sometimes of the whole body, except the\r\nface, is covered by fairly numerous, very pruriginous papules, often\r\ncovered by small, bloody crusts due to scratching. The condition is\r\nreadily mistaken for scabies. It is due to the attacks of _Tyroglyphus\r\nlongior castellanii_ which occur in enormous numbers in some samples of\r\nthe copra.\r\n\r\n\r\nSarcoptidae\r\n\r\nThe SARCOPTIDAE are minute whitish mites, semi-globular in shape, with a\r\ndelicate transversely striated cuticula. They lack eyes and tracheae. The\r\nmouth-parts are fused at the base to form a cone which is usually\r\ndesignated as the head. The legs are short and stout, and composed of\r\nfive segments. The tarsi may or may not possess a claw and may terminate\r\nin a pedunculated sucker, or simple long bristle, or both. The presence\r\nor absence of these structures and their distribution are much used in\r\nclassification. The mites live on or under the skin of mammals and\r\nbirds, where they produce the disease known as scabies, mange, or itch.\r\nSeveral species of the Sarcoptidae attack man but the most important of\r\nthese, and the one pre-eminent as the \"itch mite\" is _Sarcoptes\r\nscabiei_.\r\n\r\nThe female of _Sarcoptes scabiei_, of man, is oval and yellowish white;\r\nthe male more rounded and of a somewhat reddish tinge, and much smaller.\r\nThe body is marked by transverse striae which are partly interrupted on\r\nthe back. There are transverse rows of scales, or pointed spines, and\r\nscattered bristles on the dorsum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 56_a_. Sarcoptes scabiei, male. (x100). After\r\nFurstenberg.]\r\n\r\nThe male (fig. 56) which is from 200-240u in length, and 150-200u in\r\nbreadth, possesses pedunculated suckers on each pair of legs except the\r\nthird, which bears, instead, a long bristle. The female (fig. 56)\r\n300-450u in length and 250-350u in breadth, has the pedunculated suckers\r\non the first and second pairs of legs, only, the third and fourth\r\nterminating in bristles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 56_b_. Sarcoptes scabiei, female. (x100.) After\r\nFurstenberg.]\r\n\r\nThe mite lives in irregular galleries from a few millimeters to several\r\ncentimeters in length, which it excavates in the epidermis (fig. 57). It\r\nworks especially where the skin is thin, such as between the fingers, in\r\nthe bend of the elbows and knees, and in the groin, but it is by no\r\nmeans restricted to these localities. The female, alone, tunnels into\r\nthe skin; the males remain under the superficial epidermal scales, and\r\nseldom are found, as they die soon after mating.\r\n\r\nAs she burrows into the skin the female deposits her eggs, which measure\r\nabout 150 x 100u. Furstenberg says that each deposits an average of\r\ntwenty-two to twenty-four eggs, though Gudden reports a single burrow as\r\ncontaining fifty-one. From these there develop after about seven days,\r\nthe hexapod larvae. These molt on the sixteenth day to form an octopod\r\nnymph, which molts again the twenty-first day. At the end of the fourth\r\nweek the nymphs molt to form the sexually mature males and the so-called\r\npubescent females. These pair, the males die, and the females again cast\r\ntheir skin, and become the oviparous females. Thus the life cycle is\r\ncompleted in about twenty-eight days.\r\n\r\nThe external temperature exercises a great influence on the development\r\nof the mites and thus, during the winter, the areas of infestation not\r\nonly do not spread, but they become restricted. As soon as the\r\ntemperature rises, the mites increase and the infestation becomes much\r\nmore extensive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 57. Sarcoptes scabiei. Diagrammatic representation of the\r\ncourse in the skin of man.]\r\n\r\nIn considering the possible sources of infestation, and the chances of\r\nreinfestation after treatment, the question of the ability of the mite\r\nto live apart from its host is a very important one. Unfortunately there\r\nare few reliable data on this subject. Gerlach found that, exposed in\r\nthe dry, warm air of a room they became very inactive within twenty-four\r\nhours, that after two days they showed only slight movement, and that\r\nafter three or four days they could not be revived by moisture and\r\nwarming. The important fact was brought out that in moist air, in folded\r\nsoiled underwear, they survived as long as ten days. Bourguignon found\r\nthat under the most favorable conditions the mites of _Sarcoptes scabiei\r\nequi_ would live for sixteen days.\r\n\r\nThe disease designated the \"itch\" or \"scabies,\" in man has been known\r\nfrom time immemorial, but until within less than a hundred years it was\r\nalmost universally attributed to malnutrition, errors of diet, or \"bad\r\nblood.\" This was in spite of the fact that the mite was known to Mouffet\r\nand that Bonomo had figured both the adult and the egg and had declared\r\nthe mite the sole cause of the disease. In 1834 the Corsican medical\r\nstudent, Francis Renucci, demonstrated the mite before a clinic in Saint\r\nLouis Hospital in Paris and soon thereafter there followed detailed\r\nstudies of the life history of the various itch mites of man and\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 58. Scabies on the hand. From portfolio of Dermochromes\r\nby permission of Rebman & Co., of New York. Publishers.]\r\n\r\nThe disease is a cosmopolitan one, being exceedingly abundant in some\r\nlocalities. Its spread is much favored where large numbers of people are\r\ncrowded together under insanitary conditions and hence it increases\r\ngreatly during wars and is widely disseminated and abundant immediately\r\nafterwards. Though more commonly to be met with among the lower classes,\r\nit not infrequently appears among those of the most cleanly, careful\r\nhabits, and it is such cases that are most liable to wrong diagnosis by\r\nthe physician.\r\n\r\nInfection occurs solely through the passage, direct or indirect, of the\r\nyoung fertilized females to the skin of a healthy individual. The adult,\r\noviparous females do not quit their galleries and hence do not serve to\r\nspread the disease. The young females move about more or less at night\r\nand thus the principal source of infestation is through sleeping in the\r\nsame bed with an infested person, or indirectly through bedclothes, or\r\neven towels or clothing. Diurnal infestation through contact or clothing\r\nis exceptional. Many cases are known of the disease being contracted\r\nfrom animals suffering from scabies, or mange.\r\n\r\nWhen a person is exposed to infestation, the trouble manifests itself\r\nafter eight or ten days, though there usually elapses a period of twenty\r\nto thirty days before there is a suspicion of anything serious. The\r\nfirst symptom is an intense itching which increases when the patient is\r\nin bed. When the point of irritation is examined the galleries may\r\nusually be seen as characteristic sinuous lines, at first whitish in\r\ncolor but soon becoming blackish because of the contained eggs and\r\nexcrement. The galleries, which may not be very distinct in some cases,\r\nmay measure as much as four centimeters in length. Little vesicles, of\r\nthe size of a pin head are produced by the secretions of the feeding\r\nmite; they are firm, and projecting, and contain a limpid fluid. Figures\r\n58 and 59 show the typical appearance of scabies on the hands, while\r\nfigure 60 shows a severe general infestation. The intolerable itching\r\ninduces scratching and through this various complications may arise. The\r\nlesions are not normally found on the face and scalp, and are rare on\r\nthe back.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 59. Scabies on the hand. After Duhring.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 60. Generalized infection of Scabies. After Morrow.]\r\n\r\nFormerly, scabies was considered a very serious disease, for its cause\r\nand method of treatment were unknown, and potentially it may continue\r\nindefinitely. Generation after generation of the mites may develop and\r\nfinally their number become so great that the general health of the\r\nindividual is seriously affected. Now that the true cause of the disease\r\nis known, it is easily controlled.\r\n\r\nTreatment usually consists in softening the skin by friction with soap\r\nand warm water, followed by a warm bath, and then applying some\r\nsubstance to kill the mites. Stiles gives the following directions,\r\nmodified from Bourguignon's, as \"a rather radical guide, to be modified\r\naccording to facilities and according to the delicacy of the skin or\r\ncondition of the patient\":\r\n\r\n1. The patient, stripped naked, is energetically rubbed all over (except\r\nthe head) for twenty minutes, with green soap and warm water. 2. He is\r\nthen placed in a warm bath for thirty minutes, during which time the\r\nrubbing is continued. 3. The parasiticide is next rubbed in for twenty\r\nminutes and is allowed to remain on the body for four or five hours; in\r\nthe meantime the patient's clothes are sterilized, to kill the eggs or\r\nmites attached to them. 4. A final bath is taken to remove the\r\nparasiticide.\r\n\r\nThe parasiticide usually relied on is the officinal sulphur ointment of\r\nthe United States pharmacopoeia. When infestation is severe it is\r\nnecessary to repeat treatment after three or four days in order to kill\r\nmites which have hatched from the eggs.\r\n\r\nThe above treatment is too severe for some individuals and may, of\r\nitself, produce a troublesome dermatitis. We have seen cases where the\r\ntreatment was persisted in and aggravated the condition because it was\r\nsupposed to be due to the parasite. For delicate-skinned patients the\r\nuse of balsam of Peru is very satisfactory, and usually causes no\r\nirritation whatever. Of course, sources of reinfection should be\r\ncarefully guarded against.\r\n\r\n_Sarcoptes scabiei crustosae_, which is a distinct variety, if not\r\nspecies, of the human itch mite, is the cause of so-called Norwegian\r\nitch. This disease is very contagious, and is much more resistant than\r\nthe ordinary scabies. Unlike the latter, it may occur on the face and\r\nscalp.\r\n\r\n_Sarcoptes scabiei_ not only attacks man but also occurs on a large\r\nnumber of mammals. Many species, based on choice of host, and minute\r\ndifferences in size and secondary characters, have been established, but\r\nmost students of the subject relegate these to varietal rank. Many of\r\nthem readily attack man, but they have become sufficiently adapted to\r\ntheir normal host so that they are usually less persistent on man.\r\n\r\n_Notoedres cati_ (usually known as _Sarcoptes minor_) is a species of\r\nitch mites which produce an often fatal disease of cats. The body is\r\nrounded and it is considerably smaller than _Sarcoptes scabiei_, the\r\nfemale (fig. 61) measuring 215-230u long and 165-175u wide; the males\r\n145-150u by 120-125u. The most important character separating\r\n_Notoedres_ from _Sarcoptes_ is the position of the anus, which is\r\ndorsal instead of terminal. The mite readily transfers to man but does\r\nnot persist, the infestation usually disappearing spontaneously in about\r\ntwo weeks. Infested cats are very difficult to cure, unless treatment is\r\nbegun at the very inception of the outbreak, and under ordinary\r\ncircumstances it is better to kill them promptly, to avoid spread of the\r\ndisease to children and others who may be exposed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 61. Notoedres cati, male and female. After Railliet.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDemodecidae\r\n\r\nThe DEMODECIDAE are small, elongate, vermiform mites which live in the\r\nhair follicles of mammals. The family characteristics will be brought\r\nout in the discussion of the species infesting man, _Demodex\r\nfolliculorum_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 62. Demodex folliculorum. (x200) After Blanchard.]\r\n\r\n_Demodex folliculorum_ (fig. 62) is to be found very commonly in the\r\nhair follicles and sebaceous glands of man. It is vermiform in\r\nappearance, and with the elongate abdomen transversely striated so as to\r\ngive it the appearance of segmentation. The female is 380-400u long by\r\n45u; the male 300u by 40u. The three-jointed legs, eight in number, are\r\nreduced to mere stubs in the adult. The larval form is hexopod. These\r\nmites thus show in their form a striking adaptation to their\r\nenvironment. In the sebaceous glands and hair follicles they lie with\r\ntheir heads down (fig. 63). Usually there are only a few in a gland, but\r\nGruby has counted as many as two hundred.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 63. Demodex folliculorum. Section through skin showing\r\nthe mites in situ. Magnification of Nos. 1, 2, 6 and 7, x150; Nos, 3,\r\n4, 5, x450. After Megnin.]\r\n\r\nThe frequency with which they occur in man is surprising. According to\r\nEuropean statistics they are found in 50 per cent to 60 per cent or even\r\nmore. Gruby found them in forty out of sixty persons examined. These\r\nfigures are very commonly quoted, but reliable data for the United\r\nStates seem to be lacking. Our studies indicate that it is very much\r\nless common in this country than is generally assumed.\r\n\r\nThe Demodex in man does not, as a rule, cause the slightest\r\ninconvenience to its host. It is often stated that they give rise to\r\ncomedons or \"black-heads\" but there is no clear evidence that they are\r\never implicated. Certain it is that they are not the usual cause. A\r\nvariety of the same, or a very closely related species of _Demodex_, on\r\nthe dog gives rise to the very resistant and often fatal follicular\r\nmange.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEXAPODA OR TRUE INSECTS\r\n\r\nThe HEXAPODA, or true insects, are characterized by the fact that the\r\nadult possesses three pairs of legs. The body is distinctly segmented\r\nand is divided into head, thorax, and abdomen.\r\n\r\nThe mouth-parts in a generalized form, consist of an upper lip, or\r\n_labrum_, which is a part of the head capsule, and a central unpaired\r\n_hypopharynx_, two _mandibles_, two _maxillae_ and a lower lip, or\r\n_labium_, made up of the fused pair of second maxillae. These parts may\r\nbe greatly modified, dependent upon whether they are used for biting,\r\nsucking, piercing and sucking, or a combination of biting and sucking.\r\n\r\nRoughly speaking, insects may be grouped into those which undergo\r\n_complete metamorphosis_ and those which have _incomplete\r\nmetamorphosis_. They are said to undergo complete metamorphosis when the\r\nyoung form, as it leaves the egg, bears no resemblance to the adult. For\r\nexample, the maggot changes to a quiescent pupa and from this emerges\r\nthe winged active fly. They undergo incomplete metamorphosis, when the\r\nyoung insect, as it leaves the egg, resembles the adult to a greater or\r\nless extent, and after undergoing a certain number of molts becomes\r\nsexually mature.\r\n\r\nRepresentatives of several orders have been reported as accidental or\r\nfaculative parasites of man, but the true parasites are restricted to\r\nfour orders. These are the Siphunculata; the Hemiptera, the Diptera and\r\nthe Siphonaptera.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIPHUNCULATA\r\n\r\nThe order SIPHUNCULATA was established by Meinert to include the true\r\nsucking lice. These are small wingless insects, with reduced\r\nmouth-parts, adapted for sucking; thorax apparently a single piece due\r\nto indistinct separation of its three segments: the compound eyes\r\nreduced to a single ommatidium on each side. The short, powerful legs\r\nare terminated by a single long claw. Metamorphosis incomplete.\r\n\r\nThere has been a great deal of discussion regarding the structure of the\r\nmouth-parts, and the relationships of the sucking lice, and the\r\nquestions cannot yet be regarded as settled. The conflicting views are\r\nwell represented by Cholodkovsky (1904 and 1905) and by Enderlein\r\n(1904).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 64. Pediculus showing the blind sac (_b_) containing the\r\nmouth parts (_a_) beneath the alimentary canal (_p_). After Pawlowsky.]\r\n\r\nFollowing Graber, it is generally stated that the mouth-parts consist of\r\na short tube furnished with hooks in front, which constitutes the lower\r\nlip, and that within this is a delicate sucking tube derived from the\r\nfusion of the labrum and the mandibles. Opposed to this, Cholodkovsky\r\nand, more recently, Pawlowsky, (1906), have shown that the piercing\r\napparatus lies in a blind sac under the pharynx and opening into the\r\nmouth cavity (fig. 64). It does not form a true tube but a furrow with\r\nits open surface uppermost. Eysell has shown that, in addition, there is\r\na pair of chitinous rods which he regards as the homologues of the\r\nmaxillae.\r\n\r\nWhen the louse feeds, it everts the anterior part of the mouth cavity,\r\nwith its circle of hooks. The latter serve for anchoring the bug, and\r\nthe piercing apparatus is then pushed out.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 65. Pediculus humanus, ventral aspect of male. (x10)]\r\n\r\nMost writers have classed the sucking lice as a sub-order of the\r\nHemiptera, but the more recent anatomical and developmental studies\r\nrender this grouping untenable. An important fact, bearing on the\r\nquestion, is that, as shown by Gross, (1905), the structure of the\r\novaries is radically different from that of the Hemiptera.\r\n\r\nLice infestation and its effects are known medically as _pediculosis_.\r\nThough their continued presence is the result of the grossest neglect\r\nand filthiness, the original infestation may be innocently obtained and\r\nby people of the most careful habits.\r\n\r\nThree species commonly attack man. Strangely enough, there are very few\r\naccurate data regarding their life history.\r\n\r\n_Pediculus humanus_ (fig. 65), the head louse, is the most widely\r\ndistributed. It is usually referred to in medical literature as\r\n_Pediculus capitis_, but the Linnean specific name has priority. In\r\ncolor it is of a pale gray, blackish on the margins. It is claimed by\r\nsome authors that the color varies according to the color of the skin of\r\nthe host. The abdomen is composed of seven distinct segments, bearing\r\nspiracles laterally. There is considerable variation in size. The males\r\naverage 1.8 mm. and the females 2.7 mm. in length.\r\n\r\nThe eggs, fifty to sixty in number, stick firmly to the hairs of the\r\nhost and are known as nits. They are large and conspicuous, especially\r\non dark hair and are provided with an operculum, or cap, at the free\r\nend, where the nymphs emerge. They hatch in about six days and about the\r\neighteenth day the young lice are sexually mature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 66. Pediculosis of the head. The illustration shows the\r\ncharacteristic indications of the presence of lice, viz: the occipital\r\neczema gluing the hairs together, the swollen cervical glands, and the\r\nporrigo, or eruption of contagious pustules upon the neck. After Fox.]\r\n\r\nThe head lice live by preference on the scalp of their host but\r\noccasionally they are found on the eyelashes and beard, or in the pubic\r\nregion. They may also occur elsewhere on the body. The penetration of\r\nthe rostrum into the skin and the discharge of an irritating saliva\r\nproduce a severe itching, accompanied by the formation of an eczema-like\r\neruption (fig. 66). When the infestation is severe, the discharge from\r\nthe pustules mats down the hair, and scabs are formed, under which the\r\ninsects swarm. \"If allowed to run, a regular carapace may form, called\r\n_trichoma_, and the head exudes a foetid odor. Various low plants may\r\ngrow in the trichoma, the whole being known as _plica\r\npalonica_.\"--Stiles.\r\n\r\nSources of infestation are various. School children may obtain the lice\r\nfrom seatmates, by wearing the hats or caps of infested mates, or by the\r\nuse, in common, of brushes and combs. They may be obtained from infested\r\nbeds or sleeper berths. Stiles reports an instance in which a large\r\nnumber of girls in a fashionable boarding school developed lousiness a\r\nshort time after traveling in a sleeping car.\r\n\r\nTreatment is simple, for the parasites may readily be controlled by\r\ncleanliness and washing the head with a two per cent solution of\r\ncarbolic acid or even kerosene. The latter is better used mixed with\r\nequal parts of olive oil, to avoid irritation. The treatment should be\r\napplied at night and followed the next morning by a shampoo with soap\r\nand warm water. It is necessary to repeat the operation in a few days.\r\nXylol, used pure, or with the addition of five per cent of vaseline, is\r\nalso very efficacious. Of course, the patient must be cautioned to stay\r\naway from a lighted lamp or fire while using either the kerosene or\r\nxylol. While these treatments will kill the eggs or nits, they will not\r\nremove them from the hairs. Pusey recommends repeated washings with\r\nvinegar or 25 per cent of acetic acid in water, for the purpose of\r\nloosening and removing the nits.\r\n\r\nTreatment of severe infestations in females is often troublesome on\r\naccount of long hair. For such cases the following method recommended by\r\nWhitfield (1912) is especially applicable:\r\n\r\nThe patient is laid on her back on the bed with her head over the edge,\r\nand beneath the head is placed a basin on a chair so that the hair lies\r\nin the basin. A solution of 1 in 40 carbolic acid is then poured over\r\nthe hair into the basin and sluiced backwards and forwards until the\r\nwhole of the hair is thoroughly soaked with it. It is especially\r\nnecessary that care should be taken to secure thorough saturation of the\r\nhair over the ears and at the nape of the neck, since these parts are\r\nnot only the sites of predilection of the parasites but they are apt to\r\nescape the solution. This sluicing is carried out for ten minutes by the\r\nclock. At the end of ten minutes the hair is lifted from the basin and\r\nallowed to drain, but is not dried or even thoroughly wrung out. The\r\nwhole head is then swathed with a thick towel or better, a large piece\r\nof common house flannel, which is fastened up to form a sort of turban,\r\nand is allowed to remain thus for an hour. It can then be washed or\r\nsimply allowed to dry, as the carbolic quickly disperses. At the end of\r\nthis period every pediculus and what is better, every ovum is dead and\r\nno relapse will occur unless there is exposure to fresh contagion.\r\nWhitfield states that there seem to be no disadvantages in this method,\r\nwhich he has used for years. He has never seen carboluria result from\r\nit, but would advise first cutting the hair of children under five years\r\nof age.\r\n\r\n_Pediculus corporis_ (= _P. vestimenti_) the body louse, is larger than\r\nthe preceding species, the female measuring 3.3 mm., and the male 3 mm.\r\nin length. The color is a dirty white, or grayish. _P. corporis_ has\r\nbeen regarded by some authorities as merely a variety of _P. humanus_\r\nbut Piaget maintains there are good characters separating the two\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nThe body louse lives in the folds and seams of the clothing of its host,\r\npassing to the skin only when it wishes to feed. Brumpt states that he\r\nhas found enormous numbers of them in the collars of glass-ware or\r\ngrains worn by certain naked tribes in Africa.\r\n\r\nExact data regarding the life-history of this species have been\r\nsupplied, in part, by the work of Warburton (1910), cited by Nuttall. He\r\nfound that _Pediculus corporis_ lives longer than _P. humanus_ under\r\nadverse conditions. This is doubtless due to its living habitually on\r\nthe clothing, whereas _humanus_ lives upon the head, where it has more\r\nfrequent opportunities of feeding. He reared a single female upon his\r\nown person, keeping the louse enclosed in a cotton-plugged tube with a\r\nparticle of cloth to which it could cling. The tube was kept next to his\r\nbody, thus simulating the natural conditions of warmth and moisture\r\nunder which the lice thrive. The specimen was fed twice daily, while it\r\nclung to the cloth upon which it rested. Under these conditions she\r\nlived for one month. Copulation commenced five days after the female had\r\nhatched and was repeated a number of times, sexual union lasting for\r\nhours. The female laid one hundred and twenty-four eggs within\r\ntwenty-five days.\r\n\r\nThe eggs hatched after eight days, under favorable conditions, such as\r\nthose under which the female was kept. They did not hatch in the cold.\r\nEggs kept near the person during the day and hung in clothing by the\r\nbedside at night, during the winter, in a cold room, did not hatch until\r\nthe thirty-fifth day. When the nymphs emerge from the eggs, they feed at\r\nonce, if given a chance to do so. They are prone to scatter about the\r\nperson and abandon the fragment of cloth to which the adult clings.\r\n\r\nThe adult stage is reached on the eleventh day, after three molts, about\r\nfour days apart. Adults enter into copulation about the fifth day and as\r\nthe eggs require eight days for development, the total cycle, under\r\nfavorable conditions, is about twenty-four days. Warburton's data differ\r\nconsiderably from those commonly quoted and serve to emphasize the\r\nnecessity for detailed studies of some of the commonest of parasitic\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\nBody lice are voracious feeders, producing by their bites and the\r\nirritating saliva which they inject, rosy elevations and papules which\r\nbecome covered with a brownish crust. The intense itching provokes\r\nscratching, and characteristic white scars (fig. 67) surrounded by\r\nbrownish pigment (fig. 68) are formed. The skin may become thickened and\r\ntake on a bronze tinge. This melanoderma is especially marked in the\r\nregion between the shoulders but it may become generalized, a prominent\r\ncharacteristic of \"vagabond's disease.\" According to Dubre and Beille,\r\nthis melanoderma is due to a toxic substance secreted by the lice, which\r\nindirectly provokes the formation of pigment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 67. Pediculosis in man caused by the body louse. After\r\nMorrow.]\r\n\r\nControl measures, in the case of the body louse, consist in boiling or\r\nsteaming the clothes or in some cases, sterilizing by dry heat. The\r\ndermatitis may be relieved by the use of zinc-oxide ointment, to which\r\nPusey recommends that there be added, on account of their parasiticidal\r\nproperties, sulphur and balsam of Peru, equal parts, 15 to 30 grains to\r\nthe ounce.\r\n\r\n_Phthirius pubis_ (= _P. inguinalis_), the pubic louse, or so-called\r\n\"crab louse,\" differs greatly from the preceding in appearance. It is\r\ncharacterized by its relatively short head which fits into a broad\r\ndepression in the thorax. The latter is broad and flat and merges into\r\nthe abdomen. The first pair of legs is slender and terminated by a\r\nstraight claw. The second and third pairs of legs are thicker and are\r\nprovided with powerful claws fitted for clinging to hairs. The females\r\n(fig. 69) measure 1.5 to 2 mm. in length by 1.5 mm. in breadth. The male\r\naverages a little over half as large. The eggs, or nits, are fixed at\r\nthe base of the hairs. Only a few, ten to fifteen are deposited by a\r\nsingle female, and they hatch in about a week's time. The young lice\r\nmature in two weeks.\r\n\r\nThe pubic louse usually infests the hairs of the pubis and the perineal\r\nregion. It may pass to the arm pits or even to the beard or moustache.\r\nRarely, it occurs on the eyelids, and it has even been found, in a very\r\nfew instances, occurring in all stages, on the scalp. Infestation may be\r\ncontracted from beds or even from badly infested persons in a crowd. We\r\nhave seen several cases which undoubtedly were due to the use of public\r\nwater closets. It produces papular eruption and an intense pruritis.\r\nWhen abundant, there occurs a grayish discoloration of the skin which\r\nDuguet has shown is due to a poisonous saliva injected by the louse, as\r\nis the melanoderma caused by the body louse.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 68. Melanoderma caused by the body louse. From Portfolio\r\nof Dermochromes, by permission of Rebman & Co., New York, Publishers.]\r\n\r\nThe pubic louse may be exterminated by the measures recommended for the\r\nhead louse, or by the use of officinal mercurial ointment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 69. Phthirius pubis. Ventral aspect of female. (x12).]\r\n\r\n\r\nHEMIPTERA\r\n\r\nSeveral species of HEMIPTERA-HETEROPTERA are habitual parasites of man,\r\nand others occur as occasional or accidental parasites. Of all these,\r\nthe most important and widespread are the bed-bugs, belonging to the\r\ngenus _Cimex_ (= _Acanthia_).\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BED-BUGS--The bed-bugs are characterized by a much flattened oval\r\nbody, with the short, broad head unconstricted behind, and fitting into\r\nthe strongly excavated anterior margin of the thorax. The compound eyes\r\nare prominent, simple eyes lacking. Antennae four-jointed, the first\r\nsegment short, the second long and thick, and the third and fourth\r\nslender. The tarsi are short and three segmented.\r\n\r\nIt is often assumed in the literature of the subject that there is but a\r\nsingle species of _Cimex_ attacking man, but several such species are to\r\nbe recognized. These are distinguishable by the characters given in\r\nChapter XII. We shall consider especially _Cimex lectularius_, the most\r\ncommon and widespread species.\r\n\r\n_Cimex lectularius_ (= _Acanthia lectularia_, _Clinocoris\r\nlectularius_), is one of the most cosmopolitan of human parasites but,\r\nlike the lice, it has been comparatively little studied until recent\r\nyears, when the possibility that it may be concerned with the\r\ntransmission of various diseases has awakened interest in the details of\r\nits life-history and habits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 70. Cimex lectularius adult and eggs. Photograph by M. V.\r\nS.]\r\n\r\nThe adult insect (fig. 70) is 4-5 mm. long by 3 mm. broad, reddish brown\r\nin color, with the beak and body appendages lighter in color. The short,\r\nbroad and somewhat rectangular head has no neck-like constriction but\r\nfits into the broadly semilunar prothorax. The four segmented labium or\r\nproboscis encloses the lancet-like maxillae and mandibles. The distal\r\nof the four antennal segments is slightly club-shaped. The prothorax is\r\ncharacteristic of the species, being deeply incised anteriorly and with\r\nits thin lateral margins somewhat turned up. The mesothorax is\r\ntriangular, with the apex posteriorly, and bears the greatly atrophied\r\nfirst pair of wings. There is no trace of the metathoracic pair. The\r\ngreatly flattened abdomen has eight visible segments, though in reality\r\nthe first is greatly reduced and has been disregarded by most writers.\r\nThe body is densely covered with short bristles and hairs, the former\r\nbeing peculiarly saber-shaped structures sharply toothed at the apex and\r\nalong the convex side (fig. 159_b_).\r\n\r\nThe peculiar disagreeable odor of the adult bed-bug is due to the\r\nsecretion of the stink glands which lie on the inner surface of the\r\nmesosternum and open by a pair of orifices in front of the metacoxae,\r\nnear the middle line. In the nymphs, the thoracic glands are not\r\ndeveloped but in the abdomen there are to be found three unpaired dorsal\r\nstink glands, which persist until the fifth molt, when they become\r\natrophied and replaced by the thoracic glands. The nymphal glands occupy\r\nthe median dorsal portion of the abdomen, opening by paired pores at the\r\nanterior margin of the fourth, fifth and sixth segments. The secretion\r\nis a clear, oily, volatile fluid, strongly acid in reaction. Similar\r\nglands are to be found in most of the Hemiptera-Heteroptera and their\r\nsecretion is doubtless protective, through being disagreeable to the\r\nbirds. In the bed-bug, as Marlatt points out, \"it is probably an\r\nillustration of a very common phenomenon among animals, i.e., the\r\npersistence of a characteristic which is no longer of any special value\r\nto the possessor.\" In fact, its possession is a distinct disadvantage to\r\nthe bed-bug, as the odor frequently reveals the presence of the bugs,\r\nbefore they are seen.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of the bed-bug (fig. 70) are pearly white, oval in outline,\r\nabout a millimeter long, and possess a small operculum or cap at one\r\nend, which is pushed off when the young hatches. They are laid\r\nintermittently, for a long period, in cracks and crevices of beds and\r\nfurniture, under seams of mattresses, under loose wall paper, and\r\nsimilar places of concealment of the adult bugs. Girault (1905) observed\r\na well-fed female deposit one hundred and eleven eggs during the\r\nsixty-one days that she was kept in captivity. She had apparently\r\ndeposited some of her eggs before being captured.\r\n\r\nThe eggs hatch in six to ten days, the newly emerged nymphs being about\r\n1.5 mm. in length and of a pale yellowish white color. They grow slowly,\r\nmolting five times. At the last molt the mesathoracic wing pads appear,\r\ncharacteristic of the adult. The total length of the nymphal stage\r\nvaries greatly, depending upon conditions of food supply, temperature\r\nand possibly other factors. Marlatt (1907) found under most favorable\r\nconditions a period averaging eight days between molting which, added to\r\nan equal egg period, gave a total of about seven weeks from egg to adult\r\ninsect. Girault (1912) found the postembryonic period as low as\r\ntwenty-nine days and as high as seventy days under apparently similar\r\nand normal conditions of food supply. Under optimum and normal\r\nconditions of food supply, beginning August 27, the average nymphal life\r\nwas 69.9 days; average number of meals 8.75 and the molts 5. Under\r\nconditions allowing about half the normal food supply the average\r\nnymphal life was from 116.9 to 139 days. Nymphs starved from birth lived\r\nup to 42 days. We have kept unfed nymphs, of the first stage, alive in a\r\nbottle for 75 days. The interesting fact was brought out that under\r\nthese conditions of minimum food supply there were sometimes six molts\r\ninstead of the normal number.\r\n\r\nThe adults are remarkable for their longevity, a factor which is of\r\nimportance in considering the spread of the insect and methods of\r\ncontrol. Dufour (1833) (not De Geer, as often stated) kept specimens for\r\na year, in a closed vial, without food. This ability, coupled with their\r\nwillingness to feed upon mice, bats, and other small mammals, and even\r\nupon birds, accounts for the long periods that deserted houses and camps\r\nmay remain infested. There is no evidence that under such conditions\r\nthey are able to subsist on the starch of the wall paper, juices of\r\nmoistened wood, or the moisture in the accumulations of dust, as is\r\noften stated.\r\n\r\nThere are three or four generations a year, as Girault's breeding\r\nexperiments have conclusively shown. He found that the bed-bug does not\r\nhibernate where the conditions are such as to allow it to breed and that\r\nbreeding is continuous unless interrupted by the lack of food or, during\r\nthe winter, by low temperature.\r\n\r\nBed-bugs ordinarily crawl from their hiding places and attack the face\r\nand neck or uncovered parts of the legs and arms of their victims. If\r\nundisturbed, they will feed to repletion. We have found that the young\r\nnymph would glut itself in about six minutes, though some individuals\r\nfed continuously for nine minutes, while the adult required ten to\r\nfifteen minutes for a full meal. When gorged, it quickly retreats to a\r\ncrack or crevice to digest its meal, a process which requires two or\r\nthree days. The effect of the bite depends very greatly on the\r\nsusceptibility of the individual attacked. Some persons are so little\r\naffected that they may be wholly ignorant of the presence of a large\r\nnumber of bugs. Usually the bite produces a small hard swelling, or\r\nwheal, whitish in color. It may even be accompanied by an edema and a\r\ndisagreeable inflammation, and in such susceptible individuals the\r\nrestlessness and loss of sleep due to the presence of the insects may be\r\na matter of considerable importance. Stiles (1907) records the case of a\r\nyoung man who underwent treatment for neurasthenia, the diagnosis being\r\nagreed upon by several prominent physicians; all symptoms promptly\r\ndisappeared, however, immediately following a thorough fumigation of\r\nhis rooms, where nearly a pint of bed-bugs were collected.\r\n\r\nIt is natural to suppose that an insect which throughout its whole life\r\nis in such intimate relationship with man should play an important role\r\nin the transmission of disease. Yet comparatively little is definitely\r\nknown regarding the importance of the bed-bug in this respect. It has\r\nbeen shown that it is capable of transmitting the bubonic plague, and\r\nSouth American trypanosomiasis. Nuttall succeeded in transmitting\r\nEuropean relapsing fever from mouse to mouse by its bite. It has been\r\nclaimed that Oriental sore, tuberculosis, and even syphilis may be so\r\ncarried. These phases of the subject will be considered later.\r\n\r\nThe sources of infestation are many, and the invasion of a house is not\r\nnecessarily due to neglect, though the continued presence of the pests\r\nis quite another matter. In apartments and closely placed houses they\r\nare known to invade new quarters by migration. They are frequently to be\r\nmet with in boat and sleeper berths, and even the plush seats of day\r\ncoaches, whence a nucleus may be carried in baggage to residences. They\r\nmay be brought in the laundry or in clothes of servants.\r\n\r\nUsually they are a great scourge in frontier settlements and it is\r\ngenerally believed that they live in nature under the bark of trees, in\r\nlumber, and under similar conditions. This belief is founded upon the\r\ncommon occurrence of bugs resembling the bed-bug, in such places. As a\r\nmatter of fact, they are no relation to bed-bugs but belong to\r\nplant-feeding forms alone (fig. 19 _c_, _d_).\r\n\r\nIt is also often stated that bed-bugs live in poultry houses, in\r\nswallows nests, and on bats, and that it is from these sources that they\r\ngain access to dwellings. These bugs are specifically distinct from the\r\ntrue bed-bug, but any of them may, rarely, invade houses. Moreover,\r\nchicken houses are sometimes thoroughly infested with the true _Cimex\r\nlectularius_.\r\n\r\nControl measures consist in the use of iron bedsteads and the reduction\r\nof hiding places for the bugs. If the infestation is slight they may be\r\nexterminated by a vigilant and systematic hunt, and by squirting\r\ngasoline or alcohol into cracks and crevices of the beds, and furniture.\r\nFumigation must be resorted to in more general infestations.\r\n\r\nThe simplest and safest method of fumigation is by the use of flowers of\r\nsulphur at the rate of two pounds to each one thousand cubic feet of\r\nroom space. The sulphur should be placed in a pan, a well made in the\r\ntop of the pile and a little alcohol poured in, to facilitate burning.\r\nThe whole should be placed in a larger pan and surrounded by water so as\r\nto avoid all danger of fire. Windows should be tightly closed, beds,\r\nclosets and drawers opened, and bedding spread out over chairs in order\r\nto expose them fully to the fumes. As metal is tarnished by the sulphur\r\nfumes, ornaments, clocks, instruments, and the like should be removed.\r\nWhen all is ready the sulphur should be fired, the room tightly closed\r\nand left for twelve to twenty-four hours. Still more efficient in large\r\nhouses, or where many hiding places favor the bugs, is fumigation with\r\nhydrocyanic acid gas. This is a deadly poison and must be used under\r\nrigid precautions. Through the courtesy of Professor Herrick, who has\r\nhad much experience with this method, we give in the Appendix, the clear\r\nand detailed directions taken from his bulletin on \"Household Insects.\"\r\n\r\nFumigation with formaldehyde gas, either from the liquid or \"solid\"\r\nformalin, so efficient in the case of contagious diseases, is useless\r\nagainst bed-bugs and most other insects.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER BED-BUGS--_Cimex hemipterus_ (= _C. rotundatus_) is a tropical and\r\nsubtropical species, occurring in both the old and new world. Patton and\r\nCragg state that it is distributed throughout India, Burma, Assam, the\r\nMalay Peninsula, Aden, the Island of Mauritius, Reunion, St. Vincent and\r\nPorto Rico. \"It is widely distributed in Africa, and is probably the\r\ncommon species associated there with man.\" Brumpt also records it for\r\nCuba, the Antilles, Brazil, and Venezuela.\r\n\r\nThis species, which is sometimes called the Indian bed-bug, differs from\r\n_C. lectularius_ in being darker and in having a more elongate abdomen.\r\nThe head also is shorter and narrower, and the prothorax has rounded\r\nborders.\r\n\r\nIt has the same habits and practically the same life cycle as _Cimex\r\nlectularius_. Mackie, in India, has found that it is capable of\r\ntransmitting the Asiatic type of recurrent fever. Roger suggested that\r\nit was also capable of transmitting Kala-azar and Patton has described\r\nin detail the developmental stages of _Leishmania_, the causative\r\norganism of Kala-azar, in the stomach of this bug, but Brumpt declares\r\nthat the forms described are those of a common, non-pathogenic\r\nflagellate to be found in the bug, and have nothing to do with the\r\nhuman disease. Brumpt has shown experimentally that _Cimex hemipterus_\r\nmay transmit _Trypanosoma cruzi_ in its excrement.\r\n\r\n_Cimex boueti_, occurring in French Guinea, is another species attacking\r\nman. Its habits and general life history are the same as for the above\r\nspecies. It is 3 to 4.5 mm. in length, has vestigial elytra, and much\r\nelongated antennae and legs. The extended hind legs are about as long as\r\nthe body.\r\n\r\n_Cimex columbarius_, a widely distributed species normally living in\r\npoultry houses and dove cotes, _C. inodorus_, infesting poultry in\r\nMexico, _C. hirundinis_, occurring in the nests of swallows in Europe\r\nand _Oeciacus vicarius_ (fig. 19i) occurring in swallows' nests in this\r\ncountry, are species which occasionally infest houses and attack man.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 71. Conorhinus sanguisugus.]\r\n\r\n_Conorhinus sanguisugus_, the cone-nosed bed-bug. We have seen in our\r\nconsideration of poisonous insects, that various species of Reduviid\r\nbugs readily attack man. Certain of these are nocturnal and are so\r\ncommonly found in houses that they have gained the name, of \"big\r\nbed-bugs.\" The most noted of these, in the United States, is _Conorhinus\r\nsanguisugus_ (fig. 71), which is widely distributed in our Southern\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nLike its near relatives, _Conorhinus sanguisugus_ is carnivorous in\r\nhabit and feeds upon insects as well as upon mammalian and human blood.\r\nIt is reported as often occurring in poultry houses and as attacking\r\nhorses in barns. The life history has been worked out in considerable\r\ndetail by Marlatt, (1902), from whose account we extract the following.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 72. Beak of Conorhinus sanguisugus. After Marlatt.]\r\n\r\nThe eggs are white, changing to yellow and pink before hatching. The\r\nyoung hatch within twenty days and there are four nymphal stages. In all\r\nthese stages the insect is active and predaceous, the mouth-parts (fig.\r\n72) being powerfully developed. The eggs are normally deposited, and the\r\nearly stages are undoubtedly passed, out of doors, the food of the\r\nimmature forms being other insects. Immature specimens are rarely found\r\nindoors. It winters both in the partly grown and adult stage, often\r\nunder the bark of trees or in any similar protection, and only in its\r\nnocturnal spring and early summer flights does it attack men. Marlatt\r\nstates that this insect seems to be decidedly on the increase in the\r\nregion which it particularly infests,--the plains region from Texas\r\nnorthward and westward. In California a closely related species of\r\nsimilar habits is known locally as the \"monitor bug.\"\r\n\r\nThe effect of the bite of the giant bed-bug on man is often very severe,\r\na poisonous saliva apparently being injected into the wound. We have\r\ndiscussed this phase of the subject more fully under the head of\r\npoisonous insects.\r\n\r\n_Conorhinus megistus_ is a Brazilian species very commonly attacking\r\nman, and of special interest since Chagas has shown that it is the\r\ncarrier of a trypanosomiasis of man. Its habits and life history have\r\nbeen studied in detail by Neiva, (1910).\r\n\r\nThis species is now pre-eminently a household insect, depositing its\r\neggs in cracks and crevices in houses, though this is a relatively\r\nrecent adaptation. The nymphs emerge in from twenty to forty days,\r\ndepending upon the temperature. There are five nymphal stages, and as in\r\nthe case of true bed-bugs, the duration of these is very greatly\r\ninfluenced by the availability of food and by temperature. Neiva reckons\r\nthe entire life cycle, from egg to egg, as requiring a minimum of three\r\nhundred and twenty-four days.\r\n\r\nThe nymphs begin to suck blood in three to five days after hatching.\r\nThey usually feed at night and in the dark, attacking especially the\r\nface of sleeping individuals. The bite occasions but little pain. The\r\nimmature insects live in cracks and crevices in houses and invade the\r\nbeds which are in contact with walls, but the adults are active flyers\r\nand attack people sleeping in hammocks. The males as well as the females\r\nare blood suckers.\r\n\r\nLike many blood-sucking forms, _Conorhinus megistus_ can endure for long\r\nperiods without food. Neiva received a female specimen which had been\r\nfor fifty-seven days alive in a tightly closed box. They rarely feed on\r\ntwo consecutive days, even on small quantities of blood, and were never\r\nseen to feed on three consecutive days.\r\n\r\nMethods of control consist in screening against the adult bugs, and the\r\nelimination of crevices and such hiding places of the nymphs. Where the\r\ninfestation is considerable, fumigation with sulphur is advisable.\r\n\r\n\r\nPARASITIC DIPTERA OR FLIES\r\n\r\nOf the DIPTERA or two-winged flies, many species occasionally attack\r\nman. Of these, a few are outstanding pests, many of them may also serve\r\nto disseminate disease, a phase of our subject which will be considered\r\nlater. We shall now consider the most important of the group from the\r\nviewpoint of their direct attacks on man.\r\n\r\n\r\nPsychodidae or Moth-Flies\r\n\r\nThe PSYCHODIDAE or Moth-flies, include a few species which attack man,\r\nand at least one species, _Phlebotomus papatasii_, is known to transmit\r\nthe so-called \"three-day fever\" of man. Another species is supposed to\r\nbe the vector of Peruvian verruga.\r\n\r\nThe family is made up of small, sometimes very small, nematocerous\r\nDiptera, which are densely covered with hairs, giving them a moth-like\r\nappearance. The wings are relatively large, oval or lanceolate in shape,\r\nand when at rest are held in a sloping manner over the abdomen, or are\r\nheld horizontally in such a way as to give the insect a triangular\r\noutline. Not only is the moth-like appearance characteristic, but the\r\nvenation of the wings (fig. 163, d) is very peculiar and, according to\r\nComstock, presents an extremely generalized form. All of the\r\nlongitudinal veins separate near the base of the wing except veins R_2\r\nand R_3 and veins M_1 and M_2. Cross veins are wanting in most cases.\r\n\r\nComparatively little is known regarding the life-history and habits of\r\nthe Psychodidae, but one genus, _Phlebotomus_, contains minute,\r\nblood-sucking species, commonly known as sand-flies. The family is\r\ndivided into two subfamilies, the PSYCHODINAE and the PHLEBOTOMINAE.\r\nThe second of these, the PHLEBOTOMINAE, is of interest to us.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PHLEBOTOMINAE--The Phlebotominae differ from the Psychodinae\r\nin that the radical sector branches well out into the wing rather than\r\nat the base of the wing. They are usually less hairy than the\r\nPsychodinae. The ovipositor is hidden and less strongly chitinized.\r\nThe species attacking man belong to the genus _Phlebotomus_, small forms\r\nwith relatively large, hairy wings which are held upright, and with\r\nelongate proboscis. The mandibles and maxillae are serrated and fitted\r\nfor biting.\r\n\r\nAccording to Miss Summers (1913) there are twenty-nine known species of\r\nthe genus _Phlebotomus_, five European, eleven Asiatic, seven African\r\nand six American. One species only, _Phlebotomus vexator_, has been\r\nreported for the United States. This was described by Coquillett,\r\n(1907), from species taken on Plummer's Island, Maryland. It measures\r\nonly 1.5 mm. in length. As it is very probable that this species is much\r\nmore widely distributed, and that other species of these minute flies\r\nwill be found to occur in our fauna, we quote Coquillett's description.\r\n\r\n_Phlebotomus vexator_, Coq.: Yellow, the mesonotum brown, hairs chiefly\r\nbrown; legs in certain lights appear brown, but are covered with a white\r\ntomentum; wings hyaline, unmarked; the first vein (R_1) terminates\r\nopposite one-fifth of the length of the first submarginal cell (cell\r\nR_2); this cell is slightly over twice as long as its petiole; terminal,\r\nhorny portion of male claspers slender, bearing many long hairs; the\r\napex terminated by two curved spines which are more than one-half as\r\nlong as the preceding part, and just in front of these are two similar\r\nspines, while near the middle of the length of this portion is a fifth\r\nspine similar to the others. Length 1.5 mm.\r\n\r\nThe life-history of the Phlebotomus flies has been best worked out for\r\nthe European _Phlebotomus papatasii_ and we shall briefly summarize the\r\naccount of Doerr and Russ (1913) based primarily on work on this\r\nspecies. The European Phlebotomus flies appear at the beginning of the\r\nwarm season, a few weeks after the cessation of the heavy rains and\r\nstorms of springtime. They gradually become more abundant until they\r\nreach their first maximum, which in Italy is near the end of July\r\n(Grassi). They then become scarcer but reach a second maximum in\r\nSeptember. At the beginning of winter they vanish completely,\r\nhibernating individuals not being found.\r\n\r\nAfter fertilization there is a period of eight to ten days before\r\noviposition. The eggs are then deposited, the majority in a single mass\r\ncovered by a slimy secretion from the sebaceous glands. The larvae emerge\r\nin fourteen to twenty days. There is uncertainty as to the length of\r\nlarval life, specimens kept in captivity remaining fifty or more days\r\nwithout transforming. Growth may be much more rapid in nature. The larvae\r\ndo not live in fluid media but in moist detritus in dark places. Marett\r\nbelieves that they live chiefly on the excrement of pill-bugs (Oniscidae)\r\nand lizards. Pupation always occurs during the night. The remnants of\r\nthe larval skin remain attached to the last two segments of the\r\nquiescent pupa and serve to attach it to the stone on which it lives.\r\nThe pupal stage lasts eleven to sixteen days, the adult escaping at\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nOnly the females suck blood. They attack not only man but all\r\nwarm-blooded animals and, according to recent workers, also cold-blooded\r\nforms, such as frogs, lizards, and larvae. Indeed, Townsend (1914)\r\nbelieves that there is an intimate relation between _Phlebotomus_ and\r\nlizards, or other reptiles the world over. The Phlebotomus passes the\r\ndaylight hours within the darkened recesses of the loose stone walls and\r\npiles of rock in order to escape wind and strong light. Lizards inhabit\r\nthe same places, and the flies, always ready to suck blood in the\r\nabsence of light and wind, have been found more prone to suck reptilian\r\nthan mammalian blood.\r\n\r\nOn hot summer nights, when the wind is not stirring, the Phlebotomus\r\nflies, or sand-flies, as they are popularly called, invade houses and\r\nsleeping rooms in swarms and attack the inmates. As soon as light begins\r\nto break the flies either escape to the breeding places, or cool, dark\r\nplaces protected from the wind, or a part of them remain in the rooms,\r\nhiding behind pictures, under garments, and in similar places. Wherever\r\nthe Phlebotomus flies occur they are an intolerable nuisance. On account\r\nof their small size they can easily pass through the meshes of ordinary\r\nscreens and mosquito curtains. They attack silently and inflict a very\r\npainful, stinging bite, followed by itching. The ankles, dorsum of the\r\nfeet, wrists, inner elbow, knee joint and similar places are favorite\r\nplaces of attack, possibly on account of their more delicate skin.\r\n\r\nSpecial interest has been attracted to these little pests in recent\r\nyears, since it has been shown that they transmit the European\r\n\"pappatici fever\" or \"three day fever.\" More recently yet, it appears\r\nthat they are the carriers of the virus of the Peruvian \"verruga.\" This\r\nphase of the subject will be discussed later.\r\n\r\nControl measures have not been worked out. As Newstead says, \"In\r\nconsideration of the facts which have so far been brought to light\r\nregarding the economy of Phlebotomus, it is clearly evident that the\r\ntask of suppressing these insects is an almost insurmountable one. Had\r\nwe to deal with insects as large and as accessible as mosquitoes, the\r\nadoption of prophylactic measures would be comparatively easy, but owing\r\nto the extremely minute size and almost flea-like habits of the adult\r\ninsects, and the enormous area over which the breeding-places may occur,\r\nwe are faced with a problem which is most difficult of solution.\" For\r\nthese reasons, Newstead considers that the only really prophylactic\r\nmeasures which can at present be taken, are those which are considered\r\nas precautionary against the bites of the insects.\r\n\r\nOf repellents, he cites as one of the best a salve composed of the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n  Ol. Anisi                                                    3 grs.\r\n  Ol. Eucalypti                                                3 grs.\r\n  Ol. Terebenth                                                3 grs.\r\n  Unq. Acid Borac.\r\n\r\nOf sprays he recommends as the least objectionable and at the same time\r\none of the most effective, formalin. \"The dark portions and angles of\r\nsleeping apartments should be sprayed with a one per cent. solution of\r\nthis substance every day during the season in which the flies are\r\nprevalent. A fine spraying apparatus is necessary for its application\r\nand an excessive amount must not be applied. It is considered an\r\nexcellent plan also to spray the mosquito curtains regularly every day\r\ntowards sunset; nets thus treated are claimed to repel the attacks of\r\nthese insects.\" This effectiveness of formalin is very surprising for,\r\nas we have seen, it is almost wholly ineffective against bed-bugs,\r\nmosquitoes, house flies and other insects, where it has been tried.\r\n\r\nA measure which promises to be very effective, where it can be adopted,\r\nis the use of electric fans so placed as to produce a current of air in\r\nthe direction of the windows of sleeping apartments. On account of the\r\ninability of the Phlebotomus flies to withstand even slight breezes, it\r\nseems very probable that they would be unable to enter a room so\r\nprotected.\r\n\r\n\r\nCulicidae or Mosquitoes\r\n\r\nFrom the medical viewpoint, probably the most interesting and important\r\nof the blood-sucking insects are the mosquitoes. Certainly this is true\r\nof temperate zones, such as those of the United States. The result is\r\nthat no other group of insects has aroused such widespread interest, or\r\nhas been subjected to more detailed study than have the mosquitoes,\r\nsince their role as carriers of disease was made known. There is an\r\nenormous literature dealing with the group, but fortunately for the\r\ngeneral student, this has been well summarized by a number of workers.\r\nThe most important and helpful of the general works are those of Howard\r\n(1901), Smith (1904), Blanchard (1905), Mitchell (1907), and especially\r\nof Howard, Dyar, and Knab, whose magnificent monograph is still in\r\ncourse of publication.\r\n\r\nAside from their importance as carriers of disease, mosquitoes are\r\nnotorious as pests of man, and the earlier literature on the group is\r\nlargely devoted to references to their enormous numbers and their\r\nblood-thirstiness in certain regions. They are to be found in all parts\r\nof the world, from the equator to the Arctic and Antarctic regions.\r\nLinnaeus, in the \"Flora Lapponica,\" according to Howard, Dyar and Knab,\r\n\"dwells at some length upon the great abundance of mosquitoes in Lapland\r\nand the torments they inflicted upon man and beast. He states that he\r\nbelieves that nowhere else on earth are they found in such abundance and\r\nhe compares their numbers to the dust of the earth. Even in the open,\r\nyou cannot draw your breath without having your mouth and nostrils\r\nfilled with them; and ointments of tar and cream or of fish grease are\r\nscarcely sufficient to protect even the case-hardened cuticle of the\r\nLaplander from their bite. Even in their cabins, the natives cannot take\r\na mouthful of food or lie down to sleep unless they are fumigated almost\r\nto suffocation.\" In some parts of the Northwestern and Southwestern\r\nUnited States it is necessary to protect horses working in the fields by\r\nthe use of sheets or burlaps, against the ferocious attacks of these\r\ninsects. It is a surprising fact that even in the dry deserts of the\r\nwestern United States they sometimes occur in enormous numbers.\r\n\r\nUntil comparatively recent years, but few species of mosquitoes were\r\nknown and most of the statements regarding their life-history were based\r\nupon the classic work of Reaumur (1738) on the biology of the rain\r\nbarrel mosquito, _Culex pipiens_. In 1896, Dr. Howard refers to\r\ntwenty-one species in the United States, now over fifty are known;\r\nGiles, in 1900, gives a total of two hundred and forty-two for the world\r\nfauna, now over seven hundred species are known. We have found eighteen\r\nspecies at Ithaca, N. Y.\r\n\r\nAll of the known species of mosquitoes are aquatic in the larval stage,\r\nbut in their life-histories and habits such great differences occur that\r\nwe now know that it is not possible to select any one species as typical\r\nof the group. For our present purpose we shall first discuss the general\r\ncharacteristics and structure of mosquitoes, and shall then give the\r\nlife-history of a common species, following this by a brief\r\nconsideration of some of the more striking departures from what have\r\nbeen supposed to be the typical condition.\r\n\r\nThe CULICIDAE are slender, nematocerous Diptera with narrow wings,\r\nantennae plumose in the males, and usually with the proboscis much longer\r\nthan the head, slender, firm and adapted for piercing in the female.\r\nThe most characteristic feature is that the margins of the wings and, in\r\nmost cases, the wing veins possess a fringe of scale-like hairs. These\r\nmay also cover in part, or entirely, the head, thorax, abdomen and legs.\r\nThe females, only, suck blood.\r\n\r\nOn account of the importance of the group in this country and the\r\ndesirability of the student being able to determine material in various\r\nstages, we show in the accompanying figures the characters most used in\r\nclassification.\r\n\r\nThe larvae (fig. 73) are elongate, with the head and thorax sharply\r\ndistinct. The larval antennae are prominent, consisting of a single\r\ncylindrical and sometimes curved segment. The outer third is often\r\nnarrower and bears at its base a fan-shaped tuft of hairs, the\r\narrangement and abundance of which is of systematic importance. About\r\nthe mouth are the so-called rotary mouth brushes, dense masses of long\r\nhairs borne by the labrum and having the function of sweeping food into\r\nthe mouth. The form and arrangement of thoracic, abdominal, and anal\r\ntufts of hair vary in different species and present characteristics of\r\nvalue. On either side of the eighth abdominal segment is a patch of\r\nscales varying greatly in arrangement and number and of much value in\r\nseparating species. Respiration is by means of tracheae which open at the\r\napex of the so-called anal siphon, when it is present. In addition,\r\nthere are also one or two pairs of tracheal gills which vary much in\r\nappearance in different species. On the ventral side of the anal siphon\r\nis a double row of flattened, toothed spines whose number and shape are\r\nlikewise of some value in separating species. They constitute the comb\r\nor pecten.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 73. Culex larva showing details of external structure.]\r\n\r\nThe pupa (fig. 139, b) unlike that of most insects, is active, though it\r\ntakes no food. The head and thorax are not distinctly separated, but the\r\nslender flexible abdomen in sharply marked off. The antennae,\r\nmouth-parts, legs, and wings of the future adult are now external, but\r\nenclosed in chitinous cases. On the upper surface, near the base of the\r\nwings are two trumpets, or breathing tubes, for the pupal spiracles are\r\ntowards the anterior end instead of at the caudal end, as in the larva.\r\nAt the tip of the abdomen is a pair of large chitinous swimming paddles.\r\n\r\nAs illustrative of the life cycle of a mosquito we shall discuss the\r\ndevelopment of a common house mosquito, _Culex pipiens_, often referred\r\nto in the Northern United States as the rain barrel mosquito. Its life\r\ncycle is often given as typical for the entire group, but, as we have\r\nalready emphasized, no one species can serve this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe adults of _Culex pipiens_ hibernate throughout the winter in\r\ncellars, buildings, hollow trees, or similar dark shelters. Early in the\r\nspring they emerge and deposit their eggs in a raft-like mass. The\r\nnumber of eggs in a single mass is in the neighborhood of two hundred,\r\nrecorded counts varying considerably. A single female may deposit\r\nseveral masses during her life time. The duration of the egg stage is\r\ndependent upon temperature. In the warm summer time the larvae may emerge\r\nwithin a day. The larvae undergo four molts and under optimum conditions\r\nmay transform into pupae in about a week's time. Under the same favorable\r\nconditions, the pupal stage may be completed in a day's time. The total\r\nlife cycle of _Culex pipiens_, under optimum conditions, may thus be\r\ncompleted in a week to ten days. This period may be considerably\r\nextended under less favorable conditions of temperature and food supply.\r\n\r\n_Culex pipiens_ breeds continuously throughout the summer, developing in\r\nrain barrels, horse troughs, tin cans, or indeed in any standing water\r\nabout houses, which lasts for a week or more. The catch basins of sewers\r\nfurnish an abundant supply of the pests under some conditions. Such\r\nplaces, the tin gutters on residences, and all possible breeding places\r\nmust be considered in attempts to exterminate this species.\r\n\r\nOther species of mosquitoes may exhibit radical departures from _Culex\r\npipiens_ in life-history and habits. To control them it is essential\r\nthat the biological details be thoroughly worked out for, as Howard,\r\nDyar, and Knab have emphasized, \"much useless labor and expense can be\r\navoided by an accurate knowledge of the habits of the species.\" For a\r\ncritical discussion of the known facts the reader is referred to their\r\nmonograph. We shall confine ourselves to a few illustrations.\r\n\r\nThe majority of mosquitoes in temperate climates hibernate in the egg\r\nstage, hatching in the spring or even mild winter days in water from\r\nmelting snow. It is such single-brooded species which appear in\r\nastounding numbers in the far North. Similarly, in dry regions the eggs\r\nmay stand thorough dessication, and yet hatch out with great promptness\r\nwhen submerged by the rains. \"Another provision to insure the species\r\nagainst destruction in such a case, exists in the fact * * * that not\r\nall the eggs hatch, a part of them lying over until again submerged by\r\nsubsequent rains.\" In temperate North America, a few species pass the\r\nwinter in the larval state. An interesting illustration of this is\r\nafforded by _Wyeomia smithii_, whose larvae live in pitcher plants and\r\nare to be found on the coldest winter days imbedded in the solid ice.\r\nLate in the spring, the adults emerge and produce several broods during\r\nthe summer.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, one of the most important facts which has been\r\nbrought out by the intensive studies of recent years is that certain\r\nspecies are migratory and that they can travel long distances and become\r\nan intolerable pest many miles from their breeding places. This was\r\nforcibly emphasized in Dr. Smith's work in New Jersey, when he found\r\nthat migratory mosquitoes, developing in the salt marshes along the\r\ncoast, are the dominant species largely responsible for the fame of the\r\nNew Jersey mosquito. The species concerned are _Aedes sollicitans_, _A.\r\ncantator_ and _A. taeniorhynchus_. Dr. Smith decided that the first of\r\nthese might migrate at least forty miles inland. It is obvious that\r\nwhere such species are the dominant pest, local control measures are a\r\nuseless waste of time and money. Such migratory habits are rare,\r\nhowever, and it is probable that the majority of mosquitoes do not fly\r\nany great distance from their breeding places.\r\n\r\nWhile mosquitoes are thought of primarily as a pest of man, there are\r\nmany species which have never been known to feed upon human or mammalian\r\nblood, no matter how favorable the opportunity. According to Howard,\r\nDyar, and Knab, this is true of _Culex territans_, one of the common\r\nmosquitoes in the summer months in the Northern United States. There are\r\nsome species, probably many, in which the females, like the males, are\r\nplant feeders. In experimental work, both sexes are often kept alive for\r\nlong periods by feeding them upon ripe banana, dried fig, raisins, and\r\nthe like, and in spite of sweeping assertions that mosquitoes must have\r\na meal of blood in order to stimulate the ovaries to development, some\r\nof the common blood-sucking species, notably _Culex pipiens_, have been\r\nbred repeatedly without opportunity to feed upon blood.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the bite varies greatly with different species and depends\r\nupon the susceptibility of the individual bitten. Some persons are\r\ndriven almost frantic by the attacks of the pests when their companions\r\nseem almost unconscious of any inconvenience. Usually, irritation and\r\nsome degree of inflammation appear shortly following the bite. Not\r\ninfrequently a hardened wheal or even a nodule forms, and sometimes\r\nscratching leads to secondary infection and serious results.\r\n\r\nThe source of the poison is usually supposed to be the salivary glands\r\nof the insect. As we have already pointed out, (p. 34), Macloskie\r\nbelieved that one lobe of the gland, on each side, was specialized for\r\nforming the poison, while a radically different view is that of\r\nSchaudinn, who believed that the irritation is due to the expelled\r\ncontents of the oesophageal diverticula, which contain a gas and a\r\npeculiar type of fungi or bacteria. In numerous attempts, Schaudinn was\r\nunable to produce any irritation by applying the triturated salivary\r\nglands to a wound, but obtained the typical result when he used the\r\nisolated diverticula.\r\n\r\nThe irritation of the bite may be relieved to some extent by using\r\nammonia water, a one per cent. alcoholic solution of menthol, or\r\npreparations of cresol, or carbolic acid. Dr. Howard recommends rubbing\r\nthe bite gently with a piece of moist toilet soap. Castellani and\r\nChalmers recommend cleansing inflamed bites with one in forty carbolic\r\nlotion, followed by dressing with boracic ointment. Of course,\r\nscratching should be avoided as much as possible.\r\n\r\nRepellents of various kinds are used, for warding off the attacks of the\r\ninsects. We have often used a mixture of equal parts of oil of\r\npennyroyal and kerosene, applied to the hands and face. Oil of\r\ncitronella is much used and is less objectionable to some persons. A\r\nrecommended formula is, oil of citronella one ounce, spirits of camphor\r\none ounce, oil of cedar one-half ounce. A last resort would seem to be\r\nthe following mixture recommended by Howard, Dyar, and Knab for use by\r\nhunters and fishermen in badly infested regions, against mosquitoes and\r\nblackflies.\r\n\r\nTake 2-1/4 lbs. of mutton tallow and strain it. While still hot add 1/2\r\nlb. black tar (Canadian tar). Stir thoroughly and pour into the\r\nreceptacle in which it is to be contained. When nearly cool stir in\r\nthree ounces of oil of citronella and 1-1/4 oz. of pennyroyal.\r\n\r\nAt night the surest protection is a good bed net. There are many types\r\nof these in use, but in order to be serviceable and at the same time\r\ncomfortable it should be roomy and hung in such a way as to be stretched\r\ntightly in every direction. We prefer one suspended from a broad, square\r\nframe, supported by a right-angled standard which is fastened to the\r\nhead of the bed. It must be absolutely free from rents or holes and\r\ntucked in securely under the mattress or it will serve merely as a\r\nconvenient cage to retain mosquitoes which gain an entrance. While such\r\nnets are a convenience in any mosquito ridden community, they are\r\nessential in regions where disease-carrying species abound. Screening of\r\ndoors, windows and porches, against the pests is so commonly practiced\r\nin this country that its importance and convenience need hardly be\r\nurged.\r\n\r\nDestruction of mosquitoes and prevention of breeding are of fundamental\r\nimportance. Such measures demand first, as we have seen, the correct\r\ndetermination of the species which is to be dealt with, and a knowledge\r\nof its life-history and habits. If it prove to be one of the migratory\r\nforms, it is beyond mere local effort and becomes a problem demanding\r\ncareful organization and state control. An excellent illustration of the\r\nimportance and effectiveness of work along these lines is afforded by\r\nthat in New Jersey, begun by the late Dr. John B. Smith and being pushed\r\nwith vigor by his successor, Dr. Headlee.\r\n\r\nIn any case, there is necessity for community action. Even near the\r\ncoast, where the migratory species are dominant, there are the local\r\nspecies which demand attention and which cannot be reached by any\r\nmeasures directed against the species of the salt marshes. The most\r\nimportant of local measures consist in the destruction of breeding\r\nplaces by filling or draining ponds and pools, clearing up of more\r\ntemporary breeding places, such as cans, pails, water barrels and the\r\nlike. Under conditions where complete drainage of swamps is\r\nimpracticable or undesirable, judicious dredging may result in a pool or\r\nseries of steep-sided pools deep enough to maintain a supply of fish,\r\nwhich will keep down the mosquito larvae. Where water receptacles are\r\nneeded for storage of rain water, they should be protected by careful\r\nscreening or a film of kerosene over the top of the water, renewed every\r\ntwo weeks or so, so as to prevent mosquitoes from depositing their eggs.\r\nWhen kerosene is used, Water drawn from the bottom of the receptacle\r\nwill not be contaminated by it to any injurious extent. Where ponds\r\ncannot be drained much good will be accomplished by spraying kerosene\r\noil on the surface of the water, or by the introduction of fish which\r\nwill feed on the larvae.\r\n\r\nDetailed consideration of the most efficient measures for controlling\r\nmosquitoes is to be found in Dr. Howard's Bulletin No. 88 of the Bureau\r\nof Entomology, \"Preventive and remedial work against mosquitoes\" or, in\r\nmore summarized form, in Farmers' Bulletin No. 444. One of these should\r\nbe obtained by any person interested in the problems of mosquito control\r\nand public health.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 74. Mouth parts of Simulium. After Grunberg.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Simuliidae, or Black Flies\r\n\r\nThe SIMULIIDAE, or black flies, are small, dark, or black flies, with a\r\nstout body and a hump-back appearance. The antennae are short but\r\neleven-segmented, the wings broad, without scales or hairs, and with the\r\nanterior veins stout but the others very weak. The mouth-parts (fig. 74)\r\nare fitted for biting.\r\n\r\nThe larvae of the Simuliidae (fig. 75) are aquatic and, unlike those of\r\nmosquitoes, require a well aerated, or swiftly running water. Here they\r\nattach to stones, logs, or vegetation and feed upon various\r\nmicro-organisms. They pupate in silken cocoons open at the top. Detailed\r\nlife-histories have not been worked out for most of the species. We\r\nshall consider as typical that of _Simulium pictipes_, an inoffensive\r\nspecies widely distributed in the Eastern United States, which has been\r\nstudied especially at Ithaca, N.Y. (Johannsen, 1903).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 75. Larva of Simulium, (x8). After Garman.]\r\n\r\nThe eggs are deposited in a compact yellowish layer on the surface of\r\nrock, on the brinks of falls and rapids where the water is flowing\r\nswiftly. They are elongate ellipsoidal in shape, about .4 by .18 mm. As\r\nmyriads of females deposit in the same place the egg patches may be\r\nconspicuous coatings of a foot or much more in diameter. When first laid\r\nthey are enveloped in a yellowish white slime, which becomes darker,\r\nuntil finally it becomes black just before the emerging of the larvae.\r\nThe egg stage lasts a week.\r\n\r\nThe larvae (fig. 75) are black, soft skinned, somewhat cylindrical in\r\nshape, enlarged at both ends and attenuated in the middle. The posterior\r\nhalf is much stouter than the anterior part and almost club-shaped. The\r\nhead bears two large fan-shaped organs which aid in procuring food.\r\nRespiration is accomplished by means of three so-called blood gills\r\nwhich are pushed out from the dorsal part of the rectum. The larvae occur\r\nin enormous numbers, in moss-like patches. If removed from their natural\r\nhabitat and placed in quiet water they die within three or four hours.\r\nFastened to the rock by means of a disk-like sucker at the caudal end of\r\nthe body, they ordinarily assume an erect position. They move about on\r\nthe surface of the rocks, to a limited extent, with a looping gait\r\nsimilar to that of a measuring worm, and a web is secreted which\r\nprevents their being washed away by the swiftly flowing water. They feed\r\nchiefly upon algae and diatoms.\r\n\r\nThe complete larval stage during the summer months occupies about four\r\nweeks, varying somewhat with the temperature and velocity of the water.\r\nAt the end of this period they spin from cephalic glands, boot-shaped\r\nsilken cocoons within which they pupate. The cocoon when spun is firmly\r\nattached to the rock and also to adjacent cocoons. Clustered\r\ncontinuously over a large area and sometimes one above another, they\r\nform a compact, carpet-like covering on the rocks, the reddish-brown\r\ncolor of which is easily distinguishable from the jet-black appearance\r\nof the larvae. The pupal stage lasts about three weeks. The adult fly,\r\nsurrounded by a bubble of air, quickly rises to the surface of the water\r\nand escapes. The adults (fig. 76) are apparently short lived and thus\r\nthe entire life cycle, from egg to egg is completed in approximately\r\neight weeks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 76. Simulium venustum, (x8). After Garman.]\r\n\r\nIn the case of _Simulium pictipes_ at Ithaca, N. Y., the first brood of\r\nadults emerges early in May and successive generations are produced\r\nthroughout the summer and early autumn. This species winters in the\r\nlarval condition. Most of the other species of _Simulium_ which have\r\nbeen studied seem to be single brooded.\r\n\r\nWhile _Simulium pictipes_ does not attack man, there are a number of the\r\nspecies which are blood-sucking and in some regions they are a veritable\r\nscourge. In recent years the greatest interest in the group has been\r\naroused by Sambon's hypothesis that they transmit pellagra from man to\r\nman. This has not been established, and, indeed, seems very doubtful,\r\nbut the importance of these insects as pests and the possibility that\r\nthey may carry disease make it urgent that detailed life-histories of\r\nthe hominoxious species be worked out.\r\n\r\nAs pests a vivid account of their attacks is in Agassiz's \"Lake\r\nSuperior\" (p. 61), quoted by Forbes (1912).\r\n\r\n\"Neither the love of the picturesque, however, nor the interests of\r\nscience, could tempt us into the woods, so terrible were the black\r\nflies. This pest of flies which all the way hither had confined our\r\nramblings on shore pretty closely to the rocks and the beach, and had\r\nbeen growing constantly worse, here reached its climax. Although\r\ndetained nearly two days, * * * we could only sit with folded hands, or\r\nemploy ourselves in arranging specimens, and such other operations as\r\ncould be pursued in camp, and under the protection of a 'smudge.' One,\r\nwhom scientific ardor tempted a little way up the river in a canoe,\r\nafter water plants, came back a frightful spectacle, with blood-red\r\nrings round his eyes, his face bloody, and covered with punctures. The\r\nnext morning his head and neck were swollen as if from an attack of\r\nerysipelas.\"\r\n\r\nThere are even well authenticated accounts on record of death of humans\r\nfrom the attacks of large swarms of these gnats. In some regions, and\r\nespecially in the Mississippi Valley in this country, certain species of\r\nblack flies have been the cause of enormous losses to farmers and\r\nstockmen, through their attacks on poultry and domestic animals. C. V.\r\nRiley states that in 1874 the loss occasioned in one county in Tennessee\r\nwas estimated at $500,000.\r\n\r\nThe measures of prevention and protection against these insects have\r\nbeen well summarized by Forbes (1912). They are of two kinds: \"the use\r\nof repellents intended to drive away the winged flies, and measures for\r\nthe local destruction of the aquatic larvae. The repellents used are\r\neither smudges, or surface applications made to keep the flies from\r\nbiting. The black-fly will not endure a dense smoke, and the well-known\r\nmosquito smudge seems to be ordinarily sufficient for the protection of\r\nman. In the South, leather, cloth, and other materials which will make\r\nthe densest and most stifling smoke, are often preserved for this use in\r\nthe spring. Smudges are built in pastures for the protection of stock,\r\nand are kept burning before the doors of barns and stables. As the\r\nblack-flies do not readily enter a dark room, light is excluded from\r\nstables as much as possible during the gnat season. If teams must be\r\nused in the open field while gnats are abroad, they may be protected\r\nagainst the attacks of the gnats by applying cotton-seed oil or axle\r\ngrease to the surface, especially to the less hairy parts of the\r\nanimals, at least twice a day. A mixture of oil and tar and, indeed,\r\nseveral other preventives, are of practical use in badly infested\r\nregions; but no definite test or exact comparison has been made with any\r\nthem in a way to give a record of the precise results.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is easy to drive the flies from houses or tents by burning pyrethrum\r\npowder inside; this either kills the flies or stupifies them so that\r\nthey do not bite for some time thereafter.\" * * * \"Oil of tar is\r\ncommonly applied to the exposed parts of the body for the purpose of\r\nrepelling the insects, and this preparation is supplied by the Hudson\r\nBay Company to its employees. Minnesota fishermen frequently grease\r\ntheir faces and hands with a mixture of kerosene and mutton tallow for\r\nthe same purpose.\" We have found a mixture of equal parts of kerosene\r\nand oil of pennyroyal efficient.\r\n\r\nUnder most circumstances very little can be done to destroy this insect\r\nin its early stage, but occasionally conditions are such that a\r\nlarvicide can be used effectively. Weed (1904), and Sanderson (1910)\r\nboth report excellent results from the use of phinotas oil, a\r\nproprietary compound. The first-mentioned also found that in some places\r\nthe larvae could be removed by sweeping them loose in masses with stiff\r\nstable brooms and then catching them downstream on wire netting\r\nstretched in the water.\r\n\r\n\r\nChironomidae or Midges\r\n\r\nThe flies of this family, commonly known as midges, resemble mosquitoes\r\nin form and size but are usually more delicate, and the wing-veins,\r\nthough sometimes hairy, are not fringed with scales. The venation is\r\nsimpler than in the mosquitoes and the veins are usually less distinct.\r\n\r\nThese midges, especially in spring or autumn, are often seen in immense\r\nswarms arising like smoke over swamps and producing a humming noise\r\nwhich can be heard for a considerable distance. At these seasons they\r\nare frequently to be found upon the windows of dwellings, where they are\r\noften mistaken for mosquitoes.\r\n\r\nThe larvae are worm-like, but vary somewhat in form in the different\r\ngenera. Most of them are aquatic, but a few live in the earth, in\r\nmanure, decaying wood, under bark, or in the sap of trees, especially in\r\nthe sap which collects in wounds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 77. Culicoides guttipennis; (_a_) adult, (x15); (_b_)\r\nhead of same; (_c_) larva; (_d_) head; (_e_) pupa. After Pratt.]\r\n\r\nOf the many species of CHIRONOMIDAE, (over eight hundred known), the vast\r\nmajority are inoffensive. The sub-family Ceratopogoninae, however, forms\r\nan exception, for some of the members of this group, known as sandflies,\r\nor punkies, suck blood and are particularly troublesome in the\r\nmountains, along streams, and at the seashore. Most of these have been\r\nclassed under the genus _Ceratopogon_, but the group has been broken up\r\ninto a number of genera and _Ceratopogon_, in the strict sense, is not\r\nknown to contain any species which sucks the blood of vertebrates.\r\n\r\nTHE CERATOPOGONINAE--The Ceratopogoninae are among the smallest of the\r\nDiptera, many of them being hardly a millimeter long and some not even\r\nso large. They are Chironomidae in which the thorax is not prolonged over\r\nthe head. The antennae are filiform with fourteen (rarely thirteen)\r\nsegments in both sexes, those of the male being brush-like. The basal\r\nsegment is enlarged, the last segment never longer than the two\r\npreceding combined, while the last five are sub-equal to, or longer than\r\nthe preceding segment. The legs are relatively stouter than in the other\r\nChironomidae. The following three genera of this subfamily are best known\r\nas blood suckers in this country.\r\n\r\nOf the genus _Culicoides_ there are many species occurring in various\r\nparts of the world. A number are known to bite man and animals and it is\r\nprobable that all are capable of inflicting injury. In some localities\r\nthey are called punkies, in others, sand-flies, a name sometimes also\r\napplied to the species of _Simulium_ and _Phlebotomus_. Owing to their\r\nvery small size they are known by some tribes of Indians as No-see-ums.\r\nThe larvae are found in ponds, pools, water standing in hollow tree\r\nstumps, and the like. Though probably living chiefly in fresh water, we\r\nhave found a species occurring in salt water. The larvae are small,\r\nslender, legless, worm-like creatures (fig. 77_c_) with small brown head\r\nand twelve body segments. The pupae (fig. 77_e_) are slender, more\r\nswollen at the anterior end and terminating in a forked process. They\r\nfloat nearly motionless in a vertical position, the respiratory tubes in\r\ncontact with the surface film. The adults are all small, rarely\r\nexceeding 2-1/4 mm. in length. The wings are more or less covered with\r\nerect setulae or hairs and in many species variously spotted and marked\r\nwith iridescent blotches. The antennae have fourteen segments, the palpi\r\nusually five. The wing venation and mouth-parts are shown in figures 77\r\nand 78. Of the twenty or more species of this genus occurring in the\r\nUnited States the following are known to bite: _C. cinctus_, _C.\r\nguttipennis_, _C. sanguisuga_, _C. stellifer_, _C. variipennis_, _C.\r\nunicolor_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 78. Culicoides guttipennis; mouth parts of adult. After\r\nPratt.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most widely distributed and commonest species in the Eastern\r\nStates is _C. guttipennis_ (fig. 77a). It is black with brown legs, a\r\nwhitish ring before the apex of each femur and both ends of each tibia;\r\ntarsi yellow, knobs of halteres yellow. Mesonotum opaque, brown, two\r\nvittae in the middle, enlarging into a large spot on the posterior half,\r\nalso a curved row of three spots in front of each wing, and the narrow\r\nlateral margins, light gray pruinose. Wings nearly wholly covered with\r\nbrown hairs, gray, with markings as shown in the figure. Length one mm.\r\n\r\n_Johannseniella_ Will. is a wide-spread genus related to the foregoing.\r\nIts mouth-parts are well adapted for piercing and it is said to be a\r\npersistent blood sucker, particularly in Greenland. This genus is\r\ndistinguished from _Culicoides_ by its bare wings, the venation (fig.\r\n163, c), and the longer tarsal claws. There are over twenty North\r\nAmerican species.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 79. Chrysops univittatus, (x4). After Osborn.]\r\n\r\nIn the Southwestern United States, _Tersesthes torrens_ Towns. occurs, a\r\nlittle gnat which annoys horses, and perhaps man also, by its bite. It\r\nis related to _Culicoides_ but differs in the number of antennal\r\nsegments and in its wing venation (fig. 163, e). The fly measures but\r\ntwo mm. in length and is blackish in color. The antennae of the female\r\nhave thirteen segments, the palpi but three, of which the second is\r\nenlarged and swollen.\r\n\r\n\r\nTabanidae or Horse-Flies\r\n\r\nThe TABANIDAE,--horse-flies, ear-flies, and deer-flies,--are well-known\r\npests of cattle and horses and are often extremely annoying to man. The\r\ncharacteristics of the family and of the principal North American genera\r\nare given in the keys of Chapter XII. There are over 2500 recorded\r\nspecies. As in the mosquitoes, the females alone are blood suckers. The\r\nmales are flower feeders or live on plant juices. This is apparently\r\ntrue also of the females of some of the genera.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are deposited in masses on water plants or grasses and sedges\r\ngrowing in marshy or wet ground. Those of a common species of _Tabanus_\r\nare illustrated in figure 80, _a_. They are placed in masses of several\r\nhundred, light colored when first deposited but turning black. In a week\r\nor so the cylindrical larvae, tapering at both ends (fig. 80, _b_),\r\nescape to the water, or damp earth, and lead an active, carnivorous\r\nlife, feeding mainly on insect larvae, and worms. In the forms which have\r\nbeen best studied the larval life is a long one, lasting for months or\r\neven for more than a year. Until recently, little was known concerning\r\nthe life-histories of this group, but the studies of Hart (1895), and\r\nHine (1903 +) have added greatly to the knowledge concerning North\r\nAmerican forms.\r\n\r\nMany of the species attack man with avidity and are able to inflict\r\npainful bites, which may smart for hours. In some instances the wound is\r\nso considerable that blood will continue to flow after the fly has left.\r\nWe have seen several cases of secondary infection following such bites.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 80. (_a_) Eggs of Tabanus. Photograph by J. T. Lloyd.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 80. (_b_) Larva of Tabanus. Photograph by M. V. S.]\r\n\r\nThe horse-flies have been definitely convicted of transferring the\r\ntrypanosome of surra from diseased to healthy animals and there is good\r\nevidence that they transfer anthrax. The possibility of their being\r\nimportant agents in the conveyal of human diseases should not be\r\noverlooked. Indeed, Leiper has recently determined that a species of\r\n_Chrysops_ transfers the blood parasite _Filaria diurna_.\r\n\r\n\r\nLeptidae or Snipe-Flies\r\n\r\nThe family LEPTIDAE is made up of moderate or large sized flies,\r\npredaceous in habit. They are sufficiently characterized in the keys of\r\nChapter XII. Four blood-sucking species belonging to three genera have\r\nbeen reported. Of these _Symphoromyia pachyceras_ is a western species.\r\nDr. J. C. Bradley, from personal experience, reports it as a vicious\r\nbiter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 80. (_c_) Mouth parts of Tabanus. After Grunberg.]\r\n\r\n\r\nOestridae or Bot-flies\r\n\r\nTo the family OESTRIDAE belong the bot and warble-flies so frequently\r\ninjurious to animals. The adults are large, or of medium size, heavy\r\nbodied, rather hairy, and usually resemble bees in appearance.\r\n\r\nThe larvae live parasitically in various parts of the body of mammals,\r\nsuch as the stomach (horse bot-fly), the subcutaneous connective tissue\r\n(warble-fly of cattle), or the nasal passage (sheep bot-fly or head\r\nmaggot).\r\n\r\nThere are on record many cases of the occurrence of the larvae of\r\nOestridae as occasional parasites of man. A number of these have been\r\ncollected and reviewed in a thesis by Mme. Petrovskaia (1910). The\r\nmajority of them relate to the following species.\r\n\r\n_Gastrophilus haemorrhoidalis_, the red tailed bot-fly, is one of the\r\nspecies whose larvae are most commonly found in the stomach of the horse.\r\nSchoch (1877) cites the case of a woman who suffered from a severe case\r\nof chronic catarrh of the stomach, and who vomited, and also passed from\r\nthe anus, larvae which apparently belonged to this species. Such cases\r\nare exceedingly rare but instances of subcutaneous infestation are\r\nfairly numerous. In the latter type these larvae are sometimes the cause\r\nof the peculiar \"creeping myasis.\" This is characterized at its\r\nbeginning by a very painful swelling which gradually migrates, producing\r\na narrow raised line four to twenty-five millimeters broad. When the\r\nlarva is mature, sometimes after several months, it becomes stationary\r\nand a tumor is formed which opens and discharges the larva along with\r\npus and serum.\r\n\r\n_Gastrophilus equi_ is the most widespread and common of the horse\r\nbot-flies. Portschinsky reports it as commonly causing subcutaneous\r\nmyasis of man in Russia.\r\n\r\n_Hypoderma bovis_ (= _Oestrus bovis_), and _Hypoderma lineata_ are the\r\nso-called warble-flies of cattle. The latter species is the more common\r\nin North America but Dr. C. G. Hewitt has recently shown that _H. bovis_\r\nalso occurs. Though warbles are very common in cattle in this country,\r\nthe adult flies are very rarely seen. They are about half an inch in\r\nlength, very hairy, dark, and closely resemble common honey-bees.\r\n\r\nThey deposit their eggs on the hairs of cattle and the animals in\r\nlicking themselves take in the young larvae. These pass out through the\r\nwalls of the oesophagus and migrate through the tissues of the animal,\r\nto finally settle down in the subcutaneous tissue of the back. The\r\npossibility of their entering directly through the skin, especially in\r\ncase of infestation of man, is not absolutely precluded, although it is\r\ndoubtful.\r\n\r\nFor both species of _Hypoderma_ there are numerous cases on record of\r\ntheir occurrence in man. Hamilton (1893) saw a boy, six years of age,\r\nwho had been suffering for some months from the glands on one side of\r\nhis neck being swollen and from a fetid ulceration around the back teeth\r\nof the lower jaw of the same side. Three months' treatment was of no\r\navail and the end seemed near; one day a white object, which was seen to\r\nmove, was observed in the ulcer at the root of the tongue, and on being\r\nextracted was recognized as a full grown larva of _Hypoderma_. It was of\r\nusual tawny color, about half an inch long when contracted, about one\r\nthird that thickness, and quite lively. The case resulted fatally. The\r\nboy had been on a dairy farm the previous fall, where probably the egg\r\n(or larva) was in some way taken into his mouth, and the larva found\r\nbetween the base of the tongue and the jaw suitable tissue in which to\r\ndevelop.\r\n\r\nTopsent (1901) reports a case of \"creeping myasis\" caused by _H.\r\nlineata_ in the skin of the neck and shoulders of a girl eight years of\r\nage. The larva travelled a distance of nearly six and a half inches. The\r\nlittle patient suffered excruciating pain in the place occupied by the\r\nlarva.\r\n\r\n_Hypoderma diana_ infests deer, and has been known to occur in man.\r\n\r\n_Oestris ovis_, the sheep bot-fly, or head maggot, is widely distributed\r\nin all parts of the world. In mid-summer the flies deposit living\r\nmaggots in the nostrils of sheep. These larvae promptly pass up the nasal\r\npassages into the frontal and maxillary sinuses, where they feed on the\r\nmucous to be found there. In their migrations they cause great\r\nirritation to their host, and when present in numbers may cause vertigo,\r\nparoxysms, and even death. Portschinsky in an important monograph on\r\nthis species, has discussed in detail its relation to man. He shows that\r\nit is not uncommon for the fly to attack man and that the minute living\r\nlarvae are deposited in the eyes, nostrils, lips, or mouth. A typical\r\ncase in which the larvae were deposited in the eye was described by a\r\nGerman oculist Kayser, in 1905. A woman brought her six year old\r\ndaughter to him and said that the day before, about noontime, a flying\r\ninsect struck the eye of the child and that since then she had felt a\r\npain which increased towards evening. In the morning the pain ceased but\r\nthe eye was very red. She was examined at about noon, at which time she\r\nwas quiet and felt no pain. She was not sensitive to light, and the only\r\nthing noticed was a slight congestion and accumulation of secretion in\r\nthe corner of the right eye. A careful examination of the eye disclosed\r\nsmall, active, white larvae that crawled out from the folds of the\r\nconjunctiva and then back and disappeared. Five of these larvae were\r\nremoved and although an uncomfortable feeling persisted for a while, the\r\neye became normal in about three weeks.\r\n\r\nSome of the other recorded cases have not resulted so favorably, for the\r\neyesight has been seriously affected or even lost.\r\n\r\nAccording to Edmund and Etienne Sergent (1907), myasis caused by the\r\nlarvae of _Oestris ovis_ is very common among the shepherds in Algeria.\r\nThe natives say that the fly deposits its larvae quickly, while on the\r\nwing, without pause. The greatest pain is caused when these larvae\r\nestablish themselves in the nasal cavities. They then produce severe\r\nfrontal headaches, making sleep impossible. This is accompanied by\r\ncontinuous secretion from the nasal cavities and itching pains in the\r\nsinuses. If the larvae happen to get into the mouth, the throat becomes\r\ninflamed, swallowing is painful, and sometimes vomiting results. The\r\ndiseased condition may last for from three to ten days or in the case of\r\nnasal infection, longer, but recovery always follows. The natives remove\r\nthe larvae from the eye mechanically by means of a small rag. When the\r\nnose is infested, tobacco fumigations are applied, and in case of throat\r\ninfestation gargles of pepper, onion, or garlic extracts are used.\r\n\r\n_Rhinoestrus nasalis_, the Russian gad-fly, parasitizes the\r\nnasopharyngeal region of the horse. According to Portschinsky, it not\r\ninfrequently attacks man and then, in all the known cases deposits its\r\nlarvae in the eye, only. This is generally done while the person is\r\nquiet, but not during sleep. The fly strikes without stopping and\r\ndeposits its larva instantaneously. Immediately after, the victim\r\nexperiences lancinating pains which without intermission increase in\r\nviolence. There is an intense conjunctivitis and if the larvae are not\r\nremoved promptly the envelopes of the eye are gradually destroyed and\r\nthe organ lost.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 81. Larvae of Dermatobia cyaniventris. After Blanchard.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 82. Young larva of Dermatobia cyaniventris. After\r\nSurcouf.]\r\n\r\n_Dermatobia cyaniventris_--This fly (fig. 83) is widely distributed\r\nthroughout tropical America, and in its larval stage is well known as a\r\nparasite of man. The larvae (figs. 81 and 82) which are known as the \"ver\r\nmacaque,\" \"torcel,\" \"ver moyocuil\" or by several other local names,\r\nenter the skin and give rise to a boil-like swelling, open at the top,\r\nand comparable with the swelling produced by the warble fly larvae, in\r\ncattle. They cause itching and occasional excruciating pain. When\r\nmature, nearly an inch in length, they voluntarily leave their host,\r\ndrop to the ground and complete their development. The adult female is\r\nabout 12 mm. in length. The face is yellow, the frons black with a\r\ngrayish bloom; antennae yellow, the third segment four times as long as\r\nthe second, the arista pectinate. The thorax is bluish black with\r\ngrayish bloom; the abdomen depressed, brilliant metallescent blue with\r\nviolet tinge. The legs are yellowish, the squamae and wings brownish.\r\n\r\nThe different types of larvae represented in figure 81 were formerly\r\nsupposed to belong to different species but Blanchard regards them as\r\nmerely various stages of the same species. It is only very recently that\r\nthe early stage and the method by which man becomes infested were made\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 83. Dermatobia cyaniventris (x1-3/4). After Manson.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 84. Mosquito carrying eggs of Dermatobia cyaniventris.\r\nAfter Surcouf.]\r\n\r\nAbout 1900, Blanchard observed the presence of packets of large-sized\r\neggs under the abdomen of certain mosquitoes from Central America; and\r\nin 1910, Dr. Morales, of Costa Rica, declared that the Dermatobia\r\ndeposited its eggs directly under the abdomen of the mosquito and that\r\nthey were thus carried to vertebrates. Dr. Nunez Tovar observed the\r\nmosquito carriers of the eggs and placing larvae from this source on\r\nanimals, produced typical tumors and reared the adult flies. It remained\r\nfor Surcouf (1913) to work out the full details. He found that the\r\nDermatobia deposits its eggs in packets covered by a very viscid\r\nsubstance, on leaves. These become attached to mosquitoes of the species\r\n_Janthinosoma lutzi_ (fig. 84) which walk over the leaves. The eggs\r\nwhich adhere to the abdomen, remain attached and are thus transported.\r\nThe embryo develops, but the young larva (fig. 82) remains in the egg\r\nuntil it has opportunity to drop upon a vertebrate fed upon by the\r\nmosquito.\r\n\r\n\r\nMuscidae\r\n\r\nThe following MUSCIDAE, characterized elsewhere, deserve special mention\r\nunder our present grouping of parasitic species. Other important species\r\nwill be considered as facultative parasites.\r\n\r\n_Stomoxys calcitrans_, the stable-fly, or the biting house-fly, is often\r\nconfused with _Musca domestica_ and therefore is discussed especially in\r\nour consideration of the latter species as an accidental carrier of\r\ndisease. Its possible relation to the spread of infantile paralysis is\r\nalso considered later.\r\n\r\nThe _tsetse flies_, belonging to the genus _Glossina_, are African\r\nspecies of blood-sucking Muscidae which have attracted much attention\r\nbecause of their role in transmitting various trypanosome diseases of\r\nman and animals. They are characterized in Chapter XII and are also\r\ndiscussed in connection with the diseases which they convey.\r\n\r\n_Chrysomyia macellaria_, (= _Compsomyia_), the \"screw worm\"-fly is one\r\nof the most important species of flies directly affecting man, in North\r\nAmerica. It is not normally parasitic, however, and hence will be\r\nconsidered with other facultative parasites in Chapter IV.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 85. Larva of Auchmeromyia luteola. After Graham-Smith.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 86. Auchmeromyia luteola (x4). After Graham-Smith.]\r\n\r\n_Auchmeromyia luteola_, the Congo floor maggot. This is a muscid of\r\ngrewsome habits, which has a wide distribution throughout Africa. The\r\nfly (fig. 86) deposits its eggs on the ground of the huts of the\r\nnatives. The whitish larvae (fig. 85) on hatching are slightly flattened\r\nventrally, and each segment bears posteriorly three foot-pads\r\ntransversely arranged. At night the larvae find their way into the low\r\nbeds or couches of the natives and suck their blood. The adult flies do\r\nnot bite man and, as far as known, the larvae do not play any role in the\r\ntransmission of sleeping sickness or other diseases.\r\n\r\nThis habit of blood-sucking by muscid larvae is usually referred to as\r\npeculiar to _Auchmeromyia luteola_ but it should be noted that the larvae\r\nof _Protocalliphora_ frequent the nests of birds and feed upon the\r\nyoung. Mr. A. F. Coutant has studied especially the life-history and\r\nhabits of _P. azurea_, whose larvae he found attacking young crows at\r\nIthaca, N.Y. He was unable to induce the larvae to feed on man.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 87. Cordylobia anthropophaga (x3). After Fulleborn.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 88. Larva of Cordylobia anthropophaga. After Blanchard.]\r\n\r\n_Cordylobia anthropophaga_, (_Ochromyia anthropophaga_), or Tumbu-fly\r\n(fig. 87) is an African species whose larvae affect man much as do those\r\nof _Dermatobia cyniventris_, of Central and South America. The larva\r\n(fig. 88), which is known as \"ver du Cayor\" because it was first\r\nobserved in Cayor, in Senegambia, develops in the skin of man and of\r\nvarious animals, such as dogs, cats, and monkeys. It is about 12 mm. in\r\nlength, and of the form of the larvae of other muscids. Upon the\r\nintermediate segments are minute, brownish recurved spines which give to\r\nthe larva its characteristic appearance. The life-history is not\r\nsatisfactorily worked out, but Fuller (1914), after reviewing the\r\nevidence believes that, as a rule, it deposits its young in the sleeping\r\nplaces of man and animals, whether such be a bed, a board, the floor, or\r\nthe bare ground. In the case of babies, the maggots may be deposited on\r\nthe scalp. The minute maggots bore their way painlessly into the skin.\r\nAs many as forty parasites have been found in one individual and one\r\nauthor has reported finding more than three hundred in a spaniel puppy.\r\nThough their attacks are at times extremely painful, it is seldom that\r\nany serious results follow.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SIPHONAPTERA OR FLEAS\r\n\r\nThe SIPHONAPTERA, or fleas (fig. 89) are wingless insects, with highly\r\nchitinized and laterally compressed bodies. The mouth-parts are formed\r\nfor piercing and sucking. Compound eyes are lacking but some species\r\npossess ocelli. The metamorphosis is complete.\r\n\r\nThis group of parasites, concerning which little was known until\r\nrecently, has assumed a very great importance since it was learned that\r\nfleas are the carriers of bubonic plague. Now over four hundred species\r\nare known. Of these, several species commonly attack man. The most\r\ncommon hominoxious species are _Pulex irritans_, _Xenopsylla cheopis_,\r\n_Ctenocephalus canis_, _Ctenocephalus felis_, _Ceratophyllus fasciatus_\r\nand _Dermatophilus penetrans_, but many others will feed readily on\r\nhuman blood if occasion arises.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 89. Xenopsylla cheopis, male (x25). After Jordan and\r\nRothschild.]\r\n\r\nWe shall treat in this place of the general biology and habits of the\r\nhominoxious forms and reserve for the systematic section the discussion\r\nof the characteristics of the different genera.\r\n\r\nThe most common fleas infesting houses in the Eastern United States are\r\nthe cosmopolitan dog and cat fleas, _Ctenocephalus canis_ (fig. 90) and\r\n_C. felis_. Their life cycles will serve as typical. These two species\r\nhave until recently been considered as one, under the name _Pulex\r\nserraticeps_. See figure 92.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 90. Dog flea (x15). After Howard.]\r\n\r\nThe eggs are oval, slightly translucent or pearly white, and measure\r\nabout .5 mm. in their long diameter. They are deposited loosely in the\r\nhairs of the host and readily drop off as the animal moves around.\r\nHoward found that these eggs hatch in one to two days. The larvae are\r\nelongate, legless, white, worm-like creatures. They are exceedingly\r\nactive, and avoid the light in every way possible. They cast their first\r\nskin in from three to seven days and their second in from three to four\r\ndays. They commenced spinning in from seven to fourteen days after\r\nhatching and the imago appeared five days later. Thus in summer, at\r\nWashington, the entire life cycle may be completed in about two weeks.\r\n(cf. fig. 91, 92).\r\n\r\nStrickland's (1914) studies on the biology of the rat flea,\r\n_Ceratophyllus fasciatus_, have so important a general bearing that we\r\nshall cite them in considerable detail.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 91. Larva of Xenopsylla cheopis. After Bacot and\r\nRidewood.]\r\n\r\nHe found, to begin with, that there is a marked inherent range in the\r\nrate of development. Thus, of a batch of seventy-three eggs, all laid in\r\nthe same day and kept together under the same conditions, one hatched in\r\nten days; four in eleven days; twenty-five in twelve days; thirty-one in\r\nthirteen days; ten in fourteen days; one in fifteen days; and one in\r\nsixteen days. Within these limits the duration of the egg period seems\r\nto depend mainly on the degree of humidity. The incubation period is\r\nnever abnormally prolonged as in the case of lice, (Warburton) and\r\nvarying conditions of temperature and humidity have practically no\r\neffect on the percentage of eggs which ultimately hatch.\r\n\r\nThe same investigator found that the most favorable condition for the\r\nlarva is a low temperature, combined with a high degree of humidity; and\r\nthat the presence of rubbish in which the larva may bury itself is\r\nessential to its successful development. When larvae are placed in a\r\nbottle containing either wood-wool soiled by excrement, or with feathers\r\nor filter paper covered with dried blood they will thrive readily and\r\npupate. They seem to have no choice between dried blood and powdered rat\r\nfeces for food, and also feed readily on flea excrement. They possess\r\nthe curious habit of always devouring their molted skins.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 92. Head and pronotum of (_a_) dog flea; (_b_) of cat\r\nflea; (_c_) of hen flea. After Rothschild. (_d_) Nycteridiphilus\r\n(Ischnopsyllus) hexactenus. After Oudemans.]\r\n\r\nAn important part of Strickland's experiments dealt with the question of\r\nduration of the pupal stage under the influence of temperature and with\r\nthe longevity and habits of the adult. In October, he placed a batch of\r\nfreshly formed cocoons in a small dish that was kept near a white rat in\r\na deep glass jar in the laboratory. Two months later one small and\r\nfeeble flea had emerged, but no more until February, four months after\r\nthe beginning of the experiment. Eight cocoons were then dissected and\r\nseven more found to contain the imago fully formed but in a resting\r\nstate. The remainder of the batch was then placed at 70^o F. for one\r\nnight, near a white rat. The next day all the cocoons were empty and the\r\nfleas were found on the white rat.\r\n\r\nThus, temperature greatly influences the duration of the pupal period,\r\nwhich in _Ceratophyllus fasciatus_ averages seventeen days. Moreover,\r\nwhen metamorphosis is complete a low temperature will cause the imago to\r\nremain within the cocoon.\r\n\r\nSexually mature and ovipositing fleas, he fed at intervals and kept\r\nalive for two months, when the experiment was discontinued. In the\r\npresence of rubbish in which they could bury themselves, unfed rat fleas\r\nwere kept alive for many months, whereas in the absence of any such\r\nsubstratum they rarely lived a month. In the former case, it was found\r\nthat the length of life is influenced to some degree by the temperature\r\nand humidity. In an experiment carried out at 70^o F. and 45 per cent\r\nhumidity, the fleas did not live for more than four months, while in an\r\nexperiment at 60^o F. and 70 per cent humidity they lived for at least\r\nseventeen months. There was no indication that fleas kept under these\r\nconditions sucked moisture from surrounding objects, and those kept in\r\nbell jars, with an extract of flea-rubbish on filter paper, did not live\r\nany longer than those which were not so supplied.\r\n\r\nCuriously enough, although the rat is the normal host of _Ceratophyllus\r\nfasciatus_, it was found that when given the choice these fleas would\r\nfeed upon man in preference to rats. However, none of the fleas laid\r\neggs unless they fed on rat blood.\r\n\r\nThe experiments of Strickland on copulation and oviposition in the rat\r\nflea showed that fleas do not copulate until they are sexually mature\r\nand that, at least in the case of _Ceratophyllus fasciatus_, the\r\nreproductive organs are imperfectly developed for some time (more than a\r\nweek) after emerging from the pupa. When mature, copulation takes place\r\nsoon after the fleas have fed on their true host--the rat--but not if\r\nthey have fed on a facultative host only, such as man. Copulation is\r\nalways followed by oviposition within a very short time.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the rat's blood on the female with regard to egg-laying,\r\nStrickland concludes, is stimulating rather than nutritive, as fleas\r\nthat were without food for many months were observed to lay eggs\r\nimmediately after one feed. Similarly, the male requires the stimulus of\r\na meal of rat's blood before it displays any copulatory activity.\r\n\r\nMitzmain (1910) has described in detail the act of biting on man, as\r\nobserved in the squirrel flea, _Ceratophyllus acutus_. \"The flea when\r\npermitted to walk freely on the arm selects a suitable hairy space where\r\nit ceases abruptly in its locomotion, takes a firm hold with the tarsi,\r\nprojects its proboscis, and prepares to puncture the skin. A puncture is\r\ndrilled by the pricking epipharynx, the saw-tooth mandibles\r\nsupplementing the movement by lacerating the cavity formed. The two\r\norgans of the rostrum work alternately, the middle piece boring, while\r\nthe two lateral elements execute a sawing movement. The mandibles, owing\r\nto their basal attachments, are, as is expressed by the advisory\r\ncommittee on plague investigations in India (_Journal of Hygiene_, vol.\r\n6, No. 4, p. 499), 'capable of independent action, sliding up and down\r\nbut maintaining their relative positions and preserving the lumen of the\r\naspiratory channel.' The labium doubles back, the V-shaped groove of\r\nthis organ guiding the mandibles on either side.\"\r\n\r\n\"The action of the proboscis is executed with a forward movement of the\r\nhead and a lateral and downward thrust of the entire body. As the\r\nmouth-parts are sharply inserted, the abdomen rises simultaneously. The\r\nhind and middle legs are elevated, resembling oars. The forelegs are\r\ndoubled under the thorax, the tibia and tarsi resting firmly on the\r\nepidermis serve as a support for the body during the feeding. The\r\nmaxillary palpi are retracted beneath the head and thorax. The labium\r\ncontinues to bend, at first acting as a sheath for the sawing mandibles,\r\nand as these are more deeply inserted, it bends beneath the head with\r\nthe elasticity of a bow, forcing the mandibles into the wound until the\r\nmaxillae are embedded in the skin of the victim. When the proboscis is\r\nfully inserted, the abdomen ceases for a time its lateral swinging.\"\r\n\r\n\"The acute pain of biting is first felt when the mandibles have not\r\nquite penetrated and subsequently during each distinct movement of the\r\nabdomen. The swinging of the abdomen gradually ceases as it becomes\r\nfilled with blood. The sting of the biting gradually becomes duller and\r\nless sensitive as feeding progresses. The movements of the elevated\r\nabdomen grow noticeably feebler as the downward thrusts of the springy\r\nbow-like labium becomes less frequent.\"\r\n\r\n\"As the feeding process advances one can discern through the translucent\r\nwalls of the abdomen a constant flow of blood, caudally from the\r\npharynx, accompanied by a peristaltic movement. The end of the meal is\r\nsignified in an abrupt manner. The flea shakes its entire body, and\r\ngradually withdraws its proboscis by lowering the abdomen and legs and\r\nviolently twisting the head.\"\r\n\r\n\"When starved for several days the feeding of the rat fleas is conducted\r\nin a rather vigorous manner. As soon as the proboscis is buried to the\r\nfull length the abdomen is raised and there ensues a gradual lateral\r\nswaying motion, increasing the altitude of the raised end of the abdomen\r\nuntil it assumes the perpendicular. The flea is observed at this point\r\nto gain a better foothold by advancing the fore tarsi, and then,\r\ngradually doubling back the abdomen, it turns with extreme agility,\r\nnearly touching with its dorsal side the skin of the hand upon which it\r\nis feeding. Meanwhile, the hungry parasite feeds ravenously.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is interesting to note the peculiar nervous action which the rodent\r\nfleas exhibit immediately when the feeding process is completed or when\r\ndisturbed during the biting. Even while the rostrum is inserted to the\r\nfullest the parasite shakes its head spasmodically; in a twinkling the\r\nmouth is withdrawn and then the flea hops away.\"\r\n\r\nA habit of fleas which we shall see is of significance in considering\r\ntheir agency in the spread of bubonic plague, is that of ejecting blood\r\nfrom the anus as they feed.\r\n\r\nFleas are famous for their jumping powers, and in control measures it is\r\nof importance to determine their ability along this line. It is often\r\nstated that they can jump about four inches, or, according to the Indian\r\nPlague Commission _Xenopsylla cheopis_ cannot hop farther than five\r\ninches. Mitzmain (1910) conducted some careful experiments in which he\r\nfound that the human flea, _Pulex irritans_, was able to jump as far as\r\nthirteen inches on a horizontal plane. The mean average of five\r\nspecimens permitted to jump at will was seven and three-tenths inches.\r\nThe same species was observed to jump perpendicularly to a height of at\r\nleast seven and three-fourths inches. Other species were not able to\r\nequal this record.\r\n\r\nThe effect of the bite of fleas on man varies considerably according to\r\nthe individual susceptibility. According to Patton and Cragg, this was\r\nborne out in a curious manner by the experiments of Chick and Martin.\r\n\"In these, eight human hosts were tried; in seven, little or no\r\nirritation was produced, while in one quite severe inflammation was set\r\nup around each bite.\" Of two individuals, equally accustomed to the\r\ninsects, going into an infested room, one may be literally tormented by\r\nthem while the other will not notice them. Indeed it is not altogether\r\na question of susceptibility, for fleas seem to have a special\r\npredilection for certain individuals. The typical itching wheals\r\nproduced by the bites are sometimes followed, especially after\r\nscratching, by inflammatory papules.\r\n\r\nThe itching can be relieved by the use of lotions of carbolic acid (2-3\r\nper cent), camphor, menthol lotion, or carbolated vaseline. If forced to\r\nsleep in an infested room, protection from attacks can be in a large\r\nmeasure gained by sprinkling pyrethrum, bubach, or California insect\r\npowder between the sheets. The use of camphor, menthol, or oil of\r\neucalyptus, or oil of pennyroyal is also said to afford protection to a\r\ncertain extent.\r\n\r\nIn the Eastern United States the occurrence of fleas as household pests\r\nis usually due to infested cats and dogs which have the run of the\r\nhouse. We have seen that the eggs are not attached to the host but drop\r\nto the floor when they are laid. Verrill, cited by Osborn, states that\r\non one occasion he was able to collect fully a teaspoonful of eggs from\r\nthe dress of a lady in whose lap a half-grown kitten had been held for a\r\nshort time. Patton and Cragg record seeing the inside of a hat in which\r\na kitten had spent the night, so covered with flea eggs that it looked\r\n\"as if it had been sprinkled with sugar from a sifter.\" It is no wonder\r\nthat houses in which pets live become overrun with the fleas.\r\n\r\nOne of the first control measures, then, consists in keeping such\r\nanimals out of the house or in rigorously keeping them free from fleas.\r\nThe latter can best be accomplished by the use of strong tar soap or\r\nArmour's \"Flesope,\" which may be obtained from most druggists. The use\r\nof a three per cent solution of creolin, approximately four teaspoonfuls\r\nto a quart of warm water, has also been recommended. While this is\r\nsatisfactory in the case of dogs, it is liable to sicken cats, who will\r\nlick their fur in an effort to dry themselves. Howard recommends\r\nthoroughly rubbing into the fur a quantity of pyrethrum powder. This\r\npartially stupifies the fleas which should be promptly swept up and\r\nburned.\r\n\r\nHe also recommends providing a rug for the dog or cat to sleep on and\r\ngiving this rug a frequent shaking and brushing, afterwards sweeping up\r\nand burning the dust thus removed.\r\n\r\nSince the larvae of fleas are very susceptible to exposure, the use of\r\nbare floors, with few rugs, instead of carpets or matting, is to be\r\nrecommended. Thorough sweeping, so as to allow no accumulation of dust\r\nin cracks and crevices will prove efficient. If a house is once\r\ninfested it may be necessary to thoroughly scrub the floors with hot\r\nsoapsuds, or to spray them with gasoline. If the latter method is\r\nadopted, care must be taken to avoid the possibility of fire.\r\n\r\nTo clear a house of fleas Skinner recommends the use of flake\r\nnaphthalene. In a badly infested house he took one room at a time,\r\nscattering on the floor five pounds of flake naphthalene, and closed it\r\nfor twenty-four hours. It proved to be a perfect and effectual remedy\r\nand very inexpensive, as the naphthalene could be swept up and\r\ntransferred to other rooms. Dr. Skinner adds, \"so far as I am concerned,\r\nthe flea question is solved and if I have further trouble I know the\r\nremedy. I intend to keep the dog and cat.\"\r\n\r\nThe late Professor Slingerland very effectively used hydrocyanic acid\r\ngas fumigation in exterminating fleas in houses. In one case, where\r\nfailure was reported, he found on investigation that the house had\r\nbecome thoroughly reinfested from pet cats, which had been left\r\nuntreated. Fumigation with sulphur is likewise efficient.\r\n\r\nThe fact that adult fleas are usually to be found on the floor, when not\r\non their hosts, was ingeniously taken advantage of by Professor S. H.\r\nGage in ridding an animal room at Cornell University of the pests. He\r\nswathed the legs of a janitor with sticky fly-paper and had him walk\r\nback and forth in the room. Large numbers of the fleas were collected in\r\nthis manner.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the southern United States hogs are commonly infested\r\nand in turn infest sheds, barns and even houses. Mr. H. E. Vick informs\r\nus that it is a common practice to turn sheep into barn-lots and sheds\r\nin the spring of the year to collect in their wool, the fleas which\r\nabound in these places after the hogs have been turned out.\r\n\r\nIt is a common belief that adult fleas are attracted to fresh meat and\r\nthat advantage of this can be taken in trapping them. Various workers,\r\nnotably Mitzman (1910), have shown that there is no basis for such a\r\nbelief.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRUE CHIGGERS--The chigoes, or true chiggers, are the most\r\ncompletely parasitic of any of the fleas. Of the dozen or more known\r\nspecies, one commonly attacks man. This is _Dermatophilus penetrans_,\r\nmore commonly known as _Sarcopsylla penetrans_ or _Pulex penetrans_.\r\n\r\nThis species occurs in Mexico, the West Indies, Central and South\r\nAmerica. There are no authentic records of its occurrence in the United\r\nStates although, as Baker has pointed out, there is no reason why it\r\nshould not become established in Florida and Texas. It is usually\r\nbelieved that Brazil was its original home. Sometime about the middle of\r\nthe nineteenth century it was introduced into West Africa and has spread\r\nacross that continent.\r\n\r\nThe males and the immature females of _Dermatophilus penetrans_ (fig.\r\n93) closely resemble those of other fleas. They are very active little\r\nbrown insects about 1-1.2 mm. in size, which live in the dust of native\r\nhuts and stables, and in dry, sandy soil. In such places they often\r\noccur in enormous numbers and become a veritable plague.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 93. Dermatophilus penetrans. Much enlarged. After\r\nKarsten.]\r\n\r\nThey attack not only man but various animals. According to Castellani\r\nand Chalmers, \"Perhaps the most noted feature is the way in which it\r\nattacks pigs. On the Gold Coast it appeared to be largely kept in\r\nexistence by these animals. It is very easily captured in the free state\r\nby taking a little pig with a pale abdomen, and placing it on its back\r\non the ground on which infected pigs are living. After watching a few\r\nmoments, a black speck will appear on the pig's abdomen, and quickly\r\nanother and another. These black specks are jiggers which can easily be\r\ntransferred to a test tube. On examination they will be found to be\r\nmales and females in about equal numbers.\"\r\n\r\nBoth the males and females suck blood. That which characterizes this\r\nspecies as distinguished from other fleas attacking man is that when the\r\nimpregnated female attacks she burrows into the skin and there swells\r\nuntil in a few days she has the size and appearance of a small pea (fig.\r\n94). Where they are abundant, hundreds of the pests may attack a single\r\nindividual (fig. 95). Here they lie with the apex of the abdomen\r\nblocking the opening. According to Fulleborn (1908) they do not\r\npenetrate beneath the epidermis. The eggs are not laid in the flesh of\r\nthe victim, as is sometimes stated, but are expelled through this\r\nopening. The female then dies, withers and falls away or is expelled by\r\nulceration. According to Brumpt, she first quits the skin and then,\r\nfalling to the ground, deposits her eggs. The subsequent development in\r\nso far as known, is like that of other fleas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 94. Dermatophilus penetrans, gravid female. After\r\nMoniez.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 95. Chiggers in the sole of foot of man. Manson's\r\nTropical Diseases. Permission of Cassell and Co.]\r\n\r\nThe chigoe usually enters between the toes, the skin about the roots of\r\nthe nails, or the soles of the feet, although it may attack other parts\r\nof the body. Mense records the occurrence in folds of the epidermis, as\r\nin the neighborhood of the anus. They give rise to irritation and unless\r\npromptly and aseptically removed there often occurs pus formation and\r\nthe development of a more or less serious abscess. Gangrene and even\r\ntetanus may ensue.\r\n\r\nTreatment consists in the careful removal of the insect, an operation\r\nmore easily accomplished a day or two after its entrance, than at first,\r\nwhen it is unswollen. The ulcerated point should then be treated with\r\nweak carbolic acid, or tincture of iodine, or dusted thoroughly with an\r\nantiseptic powder.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 96. Echidnophaga gallinacea.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 97. Echidnophaga gallinacea infesting head of chicken.\r\nAfter Enderlein.]\r\n\r\nCastellani and Chalmers recommend as prophylactic measures, keeping the\r\nhouse clean and keeping pigs, poultry, and cattle away therefrom. \"High\r\nboots should be used, and especial care should be taken not to go to a\r\nground floor bathroom with bare feet. The feet, especially the toes, and\r\nunder the nails, should be carefully examined every morning to see if\r\nany black dots can be discovered, when the jigger should be at once\r\nremoved, and in this way suppuration will be prevented. It is\r\nadvisable, also, to sprinkle the floors with carbolic lotion, Jeyes'\r\nfluid, or with pyrethrum powder, or with a strong infusion of native\r\ntobacco, as recommended by Law and Castellani.\"\r\n\r\n_Echidnophaga gallinacea_ (fig. 96) is a widely distributed Hectopsyllid\r\nattacking poultry (fig. 97). It occurs in the Southern and Southwestern\r\nUnited States and has been occasionally reported as attacking man,\r\nespecially children. It is less highly specialized than _Dermatophilus\r\npenetrans_, and does not ordinarily cause serious trouble in man.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nACCIDENTAL OR FACULTATIVE PARASITES\r\n\r\n\r\nIn addition to the many species of Arthropods which are normally\r\nparasitic on man and animals, there is a considerable number of those\r\nwhich may be classed as _accidental_ or _facultative_ parasites.\r\n\r\nAccidental or facultative parasites are species which are normally\r\nfree-living, but which are able to exist as parasites when accidentally\r\nintroduced into the body of man or other animal. A wide range of forms\r\nis included under this grouping.\r\n\r\n\r\nACARINA\r\n\r\nA considerable number of mites have been reported as accidental or even\r\nnormal, endoparasites of man, but the authentic cases are comparatively\r\nfew.\r\n\r\nIn considering such reports it is well to keep in mind von Siebold's\r\nwarning that in view of the universal distribution of mites one should\r\nbe on his guard. In vessels in which animal and other organic fluids and\r\nmoist substances gradually dry out, mites are very abundantly found. If\r\nsuch vessels are used without very careful preliminary cleaning, for the\r\nreception of evacuations of the sick, or for the reception of parts\r\nremoved from the body, such things may be readily contaminated by mites,\r\nwhich have no other relation whatever to them.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, there is no doubt but that certain mites, normally\r\nfree-living, have occurred as accidental parasites of man. Of these the\r\nmost commonly met with is _Tyroglyphus siro_, the cheese-mite.\r\n\r\n_Tyroglyphus siro_ is a small mite of a whitish color. The male measures\r\nabout 500u long by 250u wide, the female slightly larger. They live in\r\ncheese of almost any kind, especially such as is a little decayed. \"The\r\nindividuals gather together in winter in groups or heaps in the hollows\r\nand chinks of the cheese and there remain motionless. As soon as the\r\ntemperature rises a little, they gnaw away at the cheese and reduce it\r\nto a powder. The powder is composed of excrement having the appearance\r\nof little grayish microscopic balls; eggs, old and new, cracked and\r\nempty; larvae, nymphs, and perfect mites, cast skins and fragments of\r\ncheese, to which must be added numerous spores of microscopic\r\nfungi.\"--Murray.\r\n\r\n_Tyroglyphus siro_, and related species, have been found many times in\r\nhuman feces, under conditions which preclude the explanation that the\r\ncontamination occurred outside of the body. They have been supposed to\r\nbe the cause of dysentery, or diarrhoea, and it is probable that the\r\n_Acarus dysenteriae_ of Linnaeus, and Latreille, was this species.\r\nHowever, there is little evidence that the mites cause any noteworthy\r\nsymptoms, even when taken into the body in large numbers.\r\n\r\n_Histiogaster spermaticus_ (fig. 152) is a Tyroglyphid mite which was\r\nreported by Trouessart (1902) as having been found in a cyst in the\r\ngroin, adherent to the testis. When the cyst was punctured, it yielded\r\nabout two ounces of opalescent fluid containing spermatozoa and numerous\r\nmites in all stages of development. The evidence indicated that a\r\nfecundated female mite had been introduced into the urethra by means of\r\nan unclean catheter. Though Trouessart reported the case as that of a\r\nSarcoptid, Banks places the genus _Histiogaster_ with the Tyroglyphidae.\r\nHe states that our species feeds on the oyster-shell bark louse,\r\npossibly only after the latter is dead, and that in England a species\r\nfeeds within decaying reeds.\r\n\r\n_Nephrophages sanguinarius_ is a peculiarly-shaped, angular mite which\r\nwas found by Miyake and Scriba (1893) for eight successive days in the\r\nurine of a Japanese suffering from fibrinuria. Males, .117 mm. long by\r\n.079 mm. wide, females .36 mm. by. 12 mm., and eggs were found both in\r\nthe spontaneously emitted urine and in that drawn by means of a\r\ncatheter. All the mites found were dead. The describers regarded this\r\nmite as a true endoparasite, but it is more probable that it should be\r\nclassed as an accidental parasite.\r\n\r\n\r\nMYRIAPODA\r\n\r\nThere are on record a number of cases of myriapods occurring as\r\naccidental parasites of man. The subject has been treated in detail by\r\nBlanchard (1898 and 1902), who discussed forty cases. Since then at\r\nleast eight additions have been made to the list.\r\n\r\nNeveau-Lamaire (1908) lists thirteen species implicated, representing\r\neight different genera. Of the _Chilognatha_ there are three, _Julus\r\nterrestris_, _J. londinensis_ and _Polydesmus complanatus_. The\r\nremainder are _Chilopoda_, namely, _Lithobius forficatus_, _L.\r\nmalenops_, _Geophilus carpophagus_, _G. electricus_, _G. similis_, _G.\r\ncephalicus_, _Scutigera coleoptrata_, _Himantarium gervaisi_,\r\n_Chaetechelyne vesuviana_ and _Stigmatogaster subterraneus_.\r\n\r\nThe majority of the cases relate to infestation of the nasal fossae, or\r\nthe frontal sinus, but intestinal infestation also occurs and there is\r\none recorded case of the presence of a species in _Julus_ (fig. 13) in\r\nthe auditory canal of a child.\r\n\r\nIn the nose, the myriapods have been known to live for months and\r\naccording to some records, even for years. The symptoms caused by their\r\npresence are inflammation, with or without increased flow of mucus,\r\nitching, more or less intense headache, and at times general symptoms\r\nsuch as vertigo, delirium, convulsions, and the like. These symptoms\r\ndisappear suddenly when the parasites are expelled.\r\n\r\nIn the intestine of man, myriapods give rise to obscure symptoms\r\nsuggestive of infestation by parasitic worms. In a case reported by\r\nVerdun and Bruyant (1912), a child twenty months of age had been\r\naffected for fifteen days by digestive disturbances characterized by\r\nloss of appetite, nausea and vomiting. The latter had been particularly\r\npronounced for three days, when there was discovered in the midst of the\r\nmaterial expelled a living myriapod of the species _Chaetechelyne\r\nvesuviana_. Anthelminthics had been administered without result. In some\r\nof the other cases, the administration of such drugs had resulted in the\r\nexpulsion of the parasite through the anus.\r\n\r\nOne of the extreme cases on record is that reported by Shipley (1914).\r\nSpecimens of _Geophilus gorizensis_ (= _G. subterraneus_) \"were vomited\r\nand passed by a woman of 68 years of age. Some of the centipedes emerged\r\nthrough the patient's nose, and it must be mentioned that she was also\r\nsuffering from a round worm. One of her doctors was of the opinion that\r\nthe centipedes were certainly breeding inside the lady's intestines, and\r\nas many as seven or eight, sometimes more, were daily leaving the\r\nalimentary canal.\"\r\n\r\n\"According to her attendant's statements those centipedes had left the\r\nbody in some hundreds during a period of twelve or eighteen months.\r\nTheir presence produced vomiting and some haematemesis, and treatment\r\nwith thymol, male-fern and turpentine had no effect in removing the\r\ncreatures.\"\r\n\r\nThe clinical details, as supplied by Dr. Theodore Thompson were as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"Examined by me July, 1912, her tongue was dry and glazed. There was\r\nbleeding taking place from the nose and I saw a living centipede she had\r\njust extracted from her nostril. Her heart, lungs and abdomen appeared\r\nnormal. She was not very wasted, and did not think she had lost much\r\nflesh, nor was there any marked degree of anemia.\"\r\n\r\nShipley gives the following reasons for believing it impossible that\r\nthese centipedes could have multiplied in the patient's intestine. \"The\r\nbreeding habits of the genus _Geophilus_ are peculiar, and ill adapted\r\nfor reproducing in such a habitat. The male builds a small web or nest,\r\nin which he places his sperm, and the female fertilizes herself from\r\nthis nest or web, and when the eggs are fertilized they are again laid\r\nin a nest or web in which they incubate and in two or three weeks hatch\r\nout. The young _Geophilus_ differ but very little from the adult, except\r\nin size. It is just possible, but improbable, that a clutch of eggs had\r\nbeen swallowed by the host when eating some vegetables or fruit, but\r\nagainst this is the fact that the _Geophilus_ does not lay its eggs upon\r\nvegetables or fruit, but upon dry wood or earth. The egg-shell is very\r\ntough and if the eggs had been swallowed the egg-shells could certainly\r\nhave been detected if the dejecta were examined. The specimens of the\r\ncentipede showed very little signs of being digested, and it is almost\r\nimpossible to reconcile the story of the patient with what one knows of\r\nthe habits of the centipedes.\"\r\n\r\nIn none of the observed cases have there been any clear indications as\r\nto the manner of infestation. It is possible that the myriapods have\r\nbeen taken up in uncooked fruit or vegetables.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEPIDOPTEROUS LARVAE\r\n\r\nSCHOLECIASIS--Hope (1837) brought together six records of infestation of\r\nman by lepidopterous larvae and proposed to apply the name scholeciasis\r\nto this type of parasitism. The clearest case was that of a young boy\r\nwho had repeatedly eaten raw cabbage and who vomited larvae of the\r\ncabbage butterfly, _Pieris brassicae_. Such cases are extremely rare, and\r\nthere are few reliable data relative to the subject. In this connection\r\nit may be noted that Spuler (1906) has described a moth whose larvae live\r\nas ectoparasites of the sloth.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLEOPTERA\r\n\r\nCANTHARIASIS--By this term Hope designated instances of accidental\r\nparasitism by the larvae or adults of beetles. Reports of such cases\r\nare usually scouted by parasitologists but there seems no good basis for\r\nwholly rejecting them. Cobbold refers to a half dozen cases of\r\naccidental parasitism by the larvae of _Blaps mortisaga_. In one of\r\nthese cases upwards of 1200 larvae and several perfect insects were\r\nsaid to have been passed _per annum_. French (1905) reports the case of\r\na man who for a considerable period voided adult living beetles of the\r\nspecies _Nitidula bipustulata_. Most of the other cases on record relate\r\nto the larvae of _Dermestidae_ (larder beetles _et al._) or\r\n_Tenebrionidae_ (meal infesting species). Infestation probably occurs\r\nthrough eating raw or imperfectly cooked foods containing eggs or minute\r\nlarvae of these insects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 98. Larva of Piophila casei. Caudal aspect of larva.\r\nPosterior stigmata.]\r\n\r\nBrumpt cites a curious case of accidental parasitism by a coleopterous\r\nlarva belonging to the genus _Necrobia_. This larva was extracted from a\r\nsmall tumor, several millimeters long, on the surface of the conjunctiva\r\nof the eye. The larvae of this genus ordinarily live in decomposing flesh\r\nand cadavers.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIPTEROUS LARVAE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 99. Piophila casei. After Graham-Smith.]\r\n\r\nMYASIS--By this term (spelled also myiasis, and myiosis), is meant\r\nparasitism by dipterous larvae. Such parasitism may be normal, as in the\r\ncases already described under the heading parasitic Diptera, or it may\r\nbe facultative, due to free-living larvae being accidentally introduced\r\ninto wounds or the body-cavities of man. Of this latter type, there is a\r\nmultitude of cases on record, relating to comparatively few species. The\r\nliterature of the subject, like that relating to facultative parasitism\r\nin general, is unsatisfactory, for most of the determinations of species\r\nhave been very loose. Indeed, so little has been known regarding the\r\ncharacteristics of the larvae concerned that in many instances they could\r\nnot be exactly determined. Fortunately, several workers have undertaken\r\ncomparative studies along this line. The most comprehensive publication\r\nis that of Banks (1912), entitled \"The structure of certain dipterous\r\nlarvae, with particular reference to those in human food.\"\r\n\r\nWithout attempting an exhaustive list, we shall discuss here the more\r\nimportant species of Diptera whose larvae are known to cause myasis,\r\neither external or internal. The following key will serve to determine\r\nthose most likely to be encountered. The writers would be glad to\r\nexamine specimens not readily identifiable, if accompanied by exact data\r\nrelative to occurrence.\r\n\r\n_a._ Body more or less flattened, depressed; broadest in the middle,\r\n    each segment with dorsal, lateral, and ventral fleshy processes, of\r\n    which the laterals, at least, are more or less spiniferous (fig.\r\n    101). _Fannia_ (= _Homalomyia_).\r\n\r\n  In _F. canicularis_ the dorsal processes are nearly as long as the\r\n      laterals; in _F. scalaris_ the dorsal processes are short spinose\r\n      tubercles.\r\n\r\n_aa._ Body cylindrical, or slender conical tapering toward the head;\r\n    without fleshy lateral processes (fig. 105).\r\n\r\n_b._ With the posterior stigmata at the end of shorter or longer\r\n    tubercles, or if not placed upon tubercles, then not in pit; usually\r\n    without a \"marginal button\" and without a chitinous ring surrounding\r\n    the three slits; the slits narrowly or broadly oval, not bent (fig.\r\n    171 i). _Acalyptrate muscidae_ and some species of\r\n    _Anthomyiidae_. To this group belong the cheese skipper (_Piophila\r\n    casei_, figs. 98, 99), the pomace-fly (_Drosophila ampelophila_),\r\n    the apple maggot (_Rhagoletis pomonella_), the cherry fruit fly\r\n    (_Rhagoletis cingulata_), the small dung fly (_Sepsis violacea_,\r\n    fig. 170), the beet leaf-miner (_Pegomyia vicina_, fig. 171 i), the\r\n    cabbage, bean and onion maggots (_Phorbia_ spp.) et. al.\r\n\r\n_bb._ Posterior stigmata of various forms, if the slits are narrowly\r\n    oval (fig. 171) then they are surrounded by a chitin ring which may\r\n    be open ventro-mesally.\r\n\r\n_c._ Integument leathery and usually strongly spinulose; larvae\r\n    hypodermatic or endoparasitic. Bot flies (fig. 171, f, g,\r\n    k).--_Oestridae_\r\n\r\n_cc._ Integument not leathery and (except in _Protocalliphora_) spinulae\r\n    restricted to transverse patches near the incisures of the segments.\r\n\r\n_d._ The stigmal plates in a pit; the lip-like margin of the pit with a\r\n    number of fleshy tubercles; chitin ring of the stigma not complete;\r\n    open ventro-mesally, button absent (fig. 171 e). Flesh\r\n    flies.--_Sarcophaga_\r\n\r\n_dd._ Stigmata not in a pit.\r\n\r\n_e._ The chitin ring open ventra-mesally; button absent (fig. 171 c).\r\n    Screw-worm fly. _Chrysomyia_\r\n\r\n_ee._ The chitin ring closed.\r\n\r\n_f._ Slits of the posterior stigmata straight; marginal \"button\" present\r\n    (fig. 171 b); two distinct mouth hooks, fleshy tubercles around the\r\n    anal area. _Phormia_ (fig. 171 f), _Lucilia_ and _Calliphora_ (fig.\r\n    172, a, b), _Protocalliphora_ (fig. 171, j), _Cynomyia_ (fig. 171,\r\n    a). Blow flies, bluebottle flies. _Calliphorinae_\r\n\r\n_ff._ Slits of the posterior stigmata sinuous or bent. Subfamily\r\n    Muscinae.\r\n\r\n_g._ Slits of the posterior stigmata bent; usually two mouth hooks.\r\n    _Muscina stabulans_ (fig. 171, l), _Muscina similis_, _Myiospila\r\n    meditabunda_ (fig. 172, i), and some of the higher _Anthomyiidae_.\r\n\r\n_gg._ Slits of the posterior stigmata sinuous; mouth hooks usually\r\n    consolidated into one. The house-fly (_Musca domestica_ fig. 171,\r\n    d), the stable fly (_Stomoxys calcitrans_), the horn fly (_Lyperosia\r\n    irritans_), _Pyrellia_, _Pseudopyrellia_, _Morellia_, _Mesembrina_.\r\n    _Polietes_, et. al. (fig. 172 in part).\r\n\r\n_Eristalis_--The larvae of _Eristalis_ are the so-called rat-tailed\r\nmaggots, which develop in foul water. In a few instances these larvae\r\nhave been known to pass through the human alimentary canal uninjured.\r\nHall and Muir (1913) report the case of a boy five years of age, who had\r\nbeen ailing for ten weeks and who was under treatment for indigestion\r\nand chronic constipation. For some time he had vomited everything he\r\nate. On administration of a vermifuge he voided one of the rat-tailed\r\nmaggots of _Eristalis_. He admitted having drunk water from a ditch full\r\nof all manner of rotting matter. It was doubtless through this that he\r\nbecame infested. It is worth noting that the above described symptoms\r\nmay have been due to other organisms or substances in the filthy water.\r\n\r\n_Piophila casei_, the cheese-fly (fig. 99), deposits its eggs not only\r\nin old cheeses, but on ham, bacon, and other fats. The larvae (fig. 98)\r\nare the well-known cheese skippers, which sometimes occur in great\r\nabundance on certain kinds of cheese. Indeed, some people have a\r\ncomfortable theory that such infested cheese is especially good. Such\r\nbeing the case, it is small wonder that this species has been repeatedly\r\nreported as causing intestinal myasis. Thebault (1901) describes the\r\ncase of a girl who, shortly after consuming a large piece of badly\r\ninfested cheese, became ill and experienced severe pains in the region\r\nof the navel. Later these extended through the entire alimentary canal,\r\nthe excrement was mixed with blood and she suffered from vertigo and\r\nsevere headaches. During the four following days the girl felt no\r\nchange, although the excretion of the blood gradually diminished and\r\nstopped. On the fourth day she voided two half-digested larvae and,\r\nlater, seven or eight, of which two were alive and moving.\r\n\r\nThat these symptoms may be directly attributed to the larvae, or\r\n\"skippers,\" has been abundantly shown by experimental evidence.\r\nPortschinsky cites the case of a dog fed on cheese containing the larvae.\r\nThe animal suffered much pain and its excrement contained blood. On\r\n_post mortem_ it was found that the small intestine throughout almost\r\nits entire length was marked by bloody bruises. The papillae on these\r\nplaces were destroyed, although the walls were not entirely perforated.\r\nIn the appendix were found two or three dead larvae. Alessandri (1910)\r\nhas likewise shown that the larvae cause intestinal lesions.\r\n\r\nAccording to Graham-Smith, Austen (1912) has recorded a case of myasis\r\nof the nose, attended with a profuse watery discharge of several weeks\r\nduration and pain, due to the larvae of _Piophila casei_.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTHYOMYIIDAE--The characteristic larvae of two species of _Fannia_ (=\r\n_Homalomyia_ or _Anthomyia_, in part) (fig. 101) are the most commonly\r\nreported of dipterous larvae causing intestinal myasis. Hewitt (1912) has\r\npresented a valuable study of the bionomics and of the larvae of these\r\nflies, a type of what is needed for all the species concerned in myasis.\r\nWe have seen two cases of their having been passed in stools, without\r\nhaving caused any special symptoms. In other instances their presence in\r\nthe alimentary canal has given rise to symptoms vaguely described as\r\nthose of tapeworm infestation, or helminthiasis. More specifically, they\r\nhave been described as causing vertigo, severe headache, nausea and\r\nvomiting, severe abdominal pains, and in some instances, bloody\r\ndiarrhoea.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 100. Fannia canicularis (x4). After Graham-Smith.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking cases is that reported by Blankmeyer (1914), of\r\na woman whose illness began fourteen years previously with nausea and\r\nvomiting. After several months of illness she began passing larvae and\r\nwas compelled to resort to enemas. Three years previous to the report,\r\nshe noticed frequent shooting pains in the rectal region and at times\r\nabdominal tenderness was marked. There was much mucus in the stools and\r\nshe \"experienced the sensation of larvae crawling in the intestine.\"\r\nOccipital headaches were marked, with remissions, and constipation\r\nbecame chronic. The appetite was variable, there was a bad taste in the\r\nmouth, tongue furred and ridged, and red at the edges. Her complexion\r\nwas sallow, and general nervousness was marked. As treatment, there were\r\ngiven doses of magnesium sulphate before breakfast and at 4 P. M., with\r\nfive grain doses of salol four times a day. The customary parasiticides\r\nyielded no marked benefit. At the time of the report the patient passed\r\nfrom four to fifty larvae per day, and was showing some signs of\r\nimprovement. The nausea had disappeared, her nervousness was less\r\nevident, and there was a slight gain in weight.\r\n\r\nThe case was complicated by various other disorders, but the symptoms\r\ngiven above seem to be in large part attributable to the myasis. There\r\nis nothing in the case to justify the assumption that larvae were\r\ncontinuously present, for years. It seems more reasonable to suppose\r\nthat something in the habits of the patient favored repeated\r\ninfestation. Nevertheless, a study of the various cases of intestinal\r\nmyasis caused by these and other species of dipterous larvae seems to\r\nindicate that the normal life cycle may be considerably prolonged under\r\nthe unusual conditions.\r\n\r\nThe best authenticated cases of myasis of the urinary passage have been\r\ndue to larvae of _Fannia_. Chevril (1909) collected and described twenty\r\ncases, of which seven seemed beyond doubt. One of these was that of a\r\nwoman of fifty-five who suffered from albuminuria, and urinated with\r\nmuch difficulty, and finally passed thirty to forty larvae of _Fannia\r\ncanicularis_.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that infestation usually occurs through eating partially\r\ndecayed fruit or vegetables on which the flies have deposited their\r\neggs. Wellman points out that the flies may deposit their eggs in or\r\nabout the anus of persons using outside privies and Hewitt believes that\r\nthis latter method of infection is probably the common one in the case\r\nof infants belonging to careless mothers. \"Such infants are sometimes\r\nleft about in an exposed and not very clean condition, in consequence of\r\nwhich flies are readily attracted to them and deposit their eggs.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 101. Larva of Fannia scalaris.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSCINAE--The larvae of the common house-fly, _Musca domestica_, are\r\noccasionally recorded as having been passed with the feces or vomit of\r\nman. While such cases may occur, it is probable that in most instances\r\nsimilar appearing larvae of other insects have been mistakenly\r\nidentified.\r\n\r\n_Muscina stabulans_ is regarded by Portschinsky (1913) as responsible\r\nfor many of the cases of intestinal myasis attributed to other species.\r\nHe records the case of a peasant who suffered from pains in the lower\r\npart of the breast and intestines, and whose stools were mixed with\r\nblood. From November until March he had felt particularly ill, being\r\ntroubled with nausea and vomiting in addition to the pain in his\r\nintestines. In March, his physician prescribed injections of a\r\nconcentrated solution of tannin, which resulted in the expulsion of\r\nfifty living larvae of _Muscina stabulans_. Thereafter the patient felt\r\nmuch better, although he suffered from intestinal catarrh in a less\r\nsevere form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 102 Muscina stabulans (x4). After Graham-Smith.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCALLIPHORINAE--Closely related to the Sarcophagidae are the\r\n_Calliphorinae_, to which group belong many of the so-called \"blue\r\nbottle\" flies. Their larvae feed upon dead animals, and upon fresh and\r\ncooked meat. Those of _Protocalliphora_, already mentioned, are\r\nectoparasitic on living nestling birds. Larva of _Lucilia_, we have\r\ntaken from tumors on living turtles. To this sub-family belongs also\r\n_Auchmeromyia luteola_, the Congo floor maggot. Some of these, and at\r\nleast the last mentioned, are confirmed, rather than faculative\r\nparasites. Various species of Calliphorinae are occasionally met with as\r\nfacultative parasites of man.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 103. Lucilia caesar, (x3). After Howard.]\r\n\r\n_Chrysomyia macellaria_, the screw worm fly (fig. 107), is the fly which\r\nis responsible for the most serious cases of human myasis in the United\r\nStates. It is widely distributed in the United States but is especially\r\nabundant in the south. While the larvae breed in decaying matter in\r\ngeneral, they so commonly breed in the living flesh of animals that they\r\nmerit rank as true parasites. The females are attracted to open wounds\r\nof all kinds on cattle and other animals and quickly deposit large\r\nnumbers of eggs. Animals which have been recently castrated, dehorned,\r\nor branded, injured by barbed wire, or even by the attacks of ticks are\r\npromptly attacked in the regions where the fly abounds. Even the navel\r\nof young calves or discharges from the vulva of cows may attract the\r\ninsect.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 104. Calliphora erythrocephala, (x6). After\r\nGraham-Smith.]\r\n\r\nNot infrequently the fly attacks man, being attracted by an offensive\r\nbreath, a chronic catarrh, or a purulent discharge from the ears. Most\r\ncommon are the cases where the eggs are deposited in the nostrils. The\r\nlarvae, which are hatched in a day or two, are provided with strong\r\nspines and proceed to bore into the tissues of the nose, even down into\r\nor through the bone, into the frontal sinus, the pharynx, larynx, and\r\nneighboring parts.\r\n\r\nOsborn (1896) quotes a number of detailed accounts of the attacks of the\r\n_Chrysomyia_ on man. A vivid picture of the symptomology of rhinal\r\nmyasis caused by the larvae of this fly is given by Castellani and\r\nChalmers: \"Some couple of days after a person suffering from a chronic\r\ncatarrh, foul breath, or ozaena, has slept in the open or has been\r\nattacked by a fly when riding or driving,--_i.e._, when the hands are\r\nengaged--signs of severe catarrh appear, accompanied with inordinate\r\nsneezing and severe pain over the root of the nose or the frontal bone.\r\nQuickly the nose becomes swollen, and later the face also may swell,\r\nwhile examination of the nose may show the presence of the larvae. Left\r\nuntreated, the patient rapidly becomes worse, and pus and blood are\r\ndischarged from the nose, from which an offensive odor issues. Cough\r\nappears as well as fever, and often some delirium. If the patient lives\r\nlong enough, the septum of the nose may fall in, the soft and hard\r\npalates may be pierced, the wall of the pharynx may be destroyed. By\r\nthis time, however, the course of the disease will have become quite\r\nevident by the larvae dropping out of the nose, and if the patient\r\ncontinues to live all the larvae may come away naturally.\"\r\n\r\nFor treatment of rhinal myasis these writers recommend douching the nose\r\nwith chloroform water or a solution of chloroform in sweet milk (10-20\r\nper cent), followed by douches of mild antiseptics. Surgical treatment\r\nmay be necessary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 105. Larva of a flesh fly (Sarcophaga). Caudal aspect.\r\nAnterior stigmata. Pharyngeal skeleton.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSARCOPHAGIDAE--The larvae (fig. 105) of flies of this family usually\r\nfeed upon meats, but have been found in cheese, oleomargerine, pickled\r\nherring, dead and living insects, cow dung and human feces. Certain\r\nspecies are parasitic in insects. Higgins (1890) reported an instance of\r\n\"hundreds\" of larvae of _Sarcophaga_ being vomited by a child eighteen\r\nmonths of age. There was no doubt as to their origin for they were\r\nvoided while the physician was in the room. There are many other reports\r\nof their occurrence in the alimentary canal. We have recorded elsewhere\r\n(Riley, 1906) a case in which some ten or twelve larvae of\r\n_Sarcophaga_ were found feeding on the diseased tissues of a malignant\r\ntumor. The tumor, a melanotic sarcoma, was about the size of a small\r\nwalnut, and located in the small of the back of an elderly lady.\r\nAlthough they had irritated and caused a slight haemorrhage, neither the\r\npatient nor others of the family knew of their presence. Any discomfort\r\nwhich they had caused had been attributed to the sarcomatous growth. The\r\ninfestation occurred in mid-summer. It is probable that the adult was\r\nattracted by the odor of the discharges and deposited the living maggots\r\nupon the diseased tissues.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 106. A flesh fly (Sarcophaga), (x4). After Graham-Smith.]\r\n\r\nAccording to Kuchenmeister, _Sarcophaga carnaria_ (fig. 106), attracted\r\nby the odor, deposits its eggs and larvae in the vagina of girls and\r\nwomen when they lie naked in hot summer days upon dirty clothes, or when\r\nthey have a discharge from the vagina. In malignant inflammations of the\r\neyes the larvae even nestle under the eyelids and in Egypt, for example,\r\nproduce a very serious addition to the effects of small-pox upon the\r\ncornea, as according to Pruner, in such cases perforation of the cornea\r\nusually takes place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 107. Chrysomyia macellaria, (x3).]\r\n\r\n_Wohlfartia magnifica_ is another Sarcophagid which commonly infests man\r\nin the regions where it is abundant. It is found in all Europe but is\r\nespecially common in Russia, where Portschinsky has devoted much\r\nattention to its ravages. It deposits living larvae in wounds, the nasal\r\nfossae, the ears and the eyes, causing injuries even more revolting than\r\nthose described for _Chrysomyia_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nARTHROPODS AS SIMPLE CARRIERS OF DISEASE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe fact that certain arthropods are poisonous, or may affect the health\r\nof man as direct parasites has always received attention in the medical\r\nliterature. We come now to the more modern aspect of our subject,--the\r\nconsideration of insects and other arthropods as transmitters and\r\ndisseminators of disease.\r\n\r\nThe simplest way in which arthropods may function in this capacity is as\r\n_simple carriers_ of pathogenic organisms. It is conceivable that any\r\ninsect which has access to, and comes in contact with such organisms and\r\nthen passes to the food, or drink, or to the body of man, may in a\r\nwholly accidental and incidental manner convey infection. That this\r\noccurs is abundantly proved by the work of recent years. We shall\r\nconsider as typical the case against the house-fly, which has attracted\r\nso much attention, both popular and scientific. The excellent general\r\ntreatises of Hewitt (1910), Howard (1911), and Graham-Smith (1913), and\r\nthe flood of bulletins and popular literature render it unnecessary to\r\nconsider the topic in any great detail.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE HOUSE-FLY AS A CARRIER OF DISEASE\r\n\r\nUp to the past decade the house-fly has usually been regarded as a mere\r\npest. Repeatedly, however, it had been suggested that it might\r\ndisseminate disease. We have seen that as far back as the sixteenth\r\ncentury, Mercurialis suggested that it was the agent in the spread of\r\nbubonic plague, and in 1658, Kircher reiterated this view. In 1871,\r\nLeidy expressed the opinion that flies were probably a means of\r\ncommunicating contagious diseases to a greater degree than was generally\r\nsuspected. From what he had observed regarding gangrene in hospitals, he\r\nthought flies should be carefully excluded from wounds. In the same\r\nyear, the editor of the _London Lancet_, referring to the belief that\r\nthey play a useful role in purifying the air said, \"Far from looking\r\nupon them as dipterous angels dancing attendance on Hygeia, regard them\r\nrather in the light of winged sponges spreading hither and thither to\r\ncarry out the foul behests of Contagion.\"\r\n\r\nThese suggestions attracted little attention from medical men, for it is\r\nonly within very recent years that the charges have been supported by\r\ndirect evidence. Before considering this evidence, it is necessary that\r\nwe define what is meant by \"house-fly\" and that we then consider the\r\nlife-history of the insect.\r\n\r\nThere are many flies which are occasionally to be found in houses, but\r\naccording to various counts, from 95 per cent to 99 per cent of these in\r\nwarm weather in the Eastern United States belong to the one species\r\n_Musca domestica_ (fig. 108). This is the dominant house-fly the world\r\nover and is the one which merits the name. It has been well\r\ncharacterized by Schiner (1864), whose description has been freely\r\ntranslated by Hewitt, as follows:\r\n\r\n\"Frons of male occupying a fourth part of the breadth of the head.\r\nFrontal stripe of female narrow in front, so broad behind that it\r\nentirely fills up the width of the frons. The dorsal region of the\r\nthorax dusty grey in color with four equally broad longitudinal stripes.\r\nScutellum gray with black sides. The light regions of the abdomen\r\nyellowish, transparent, the darkest parts at least at the base of the\r\nventral side yellow. The last segment and a dorsal line blackish brown.\r\nSeen from behind and against the light, the whole abdomen shimmering\r\nyellow, and only on each side of the dorsal line on each segment a dull\r\ntransverse band. The lower part of the face silky yellow, shot with\r\nblackish brown. Median stripe velvety black. Antennae brown. Palpi black.\r\nLegs blackish brown. Wings tinged with pale gray with yellowish base.\r\nThe female has a broad velvety back, often reddishly shimmering frontal\r\nstripe, which is not broader at the anterior end than at the bases of\r\nthe antennae, but become so very much broader above that the light\r\ndustiness of the sides is entirely obliterated. The abdomen gradually\r\nbecoming darker. The shimmering areas on the separate segments generally\r\nbrownish. All the other parts are the same as in the male.\"\r\n\r\nThe other species of flies found in houses in the Eastern United States\r\nwhich are frequently mistaken for the house or typhoid fly may readily\r\nbe distinguished by the characters of the following key:\r\n\r\n_a._ Apical cell (R_5) of the wide wing open, i.e., the bounding veins\r\n    parallel or divergent (fig. 100). Their larvae are flattened, the\r\n    intermediate body segments each fringed with fleshy, more or less\r\n    spinose, processes. _Fannia_\r\n\r\n  b. Male with the sides of the second and third abdominal segments\r\n      translucent yellowish. The larva with three pairs of nearly equal\r\n      spiniferous appendages on each segment, arranged in a\r\n      longitudinal series and in addition two pairs of series of smaller\r\n      processes (fig. 100) _F. canicularis_\r\n\r\n  bb. Male with blackish abdomen, middle tibia with a tubercle beyond\r\n      the middle. The larva with spiniferous appendages of which the\r\n      dorsal and ventral series are short, the lateral series long and\r\n      feathered (fig. 101) _F. scalaris_\r\n\r\naa. Apical cell (R) of the wing more or less narrowed in the margin; i.\r\n    e., the bounding veins more or less converging (fig. 108).\r\n\r\n  b. The mouth-parts produced and pointed, fitted for piercing.\r\n\r\n    c. Palpi much shorter than the proboscis; a brownish gray fly, its\r\n        thorax with three rather broad whitish stripes; on each border\r\n        of the middle stripe and on the mesal borders of the lateral\r\n        stripes is a blackish brown line. Abdomen yellowish brown; on\r\n        the second, third and fourth segments are three brown spots\r\n        which may be faint or even absent. The larvae live in dung. The\r\n        stable-fly (fig. 110) _Stomoxys calcitrans_\r\n\r\n    cc. Palpi nearly as long as the proboscis. Smaller species than the\r\n        house-fly. The horn-fly (fig. 167) _Haematobia irritans_\r\n\r\n  bb. Mouth-parts blunt, fitted for lapping.\r\n\r\n    c. Thorax, particularly on the sides and near the base of the wings\r\n        with soft golden yellow hairs among the bristles. This fly is\r\n        often found in the house in very early spring or even in the\r\n        winter. The cluster-fly, _Pollenia rudis_\r\n\r\n    cc. Thorax without golden yellow hairs among the bristles.\r\n\r\n      d. The last segment of the vein M with an abrupt angle. (fig.\r\n          108). The larvae live in manure, etc. House-fly, _Musca\r\n          domestica_\r\n\r\n      dd. The last segment of vein M with a broad, gentle curve (fig.\r\n          102).\r\n\r\n        e. Eyes microscopically hairy; each abdominal segment with two\r\n            spots. Larvae in dung. _Myiospila meditabunda_\r\n\r\n        ee. Eyes bare; abdomen gray and brown marbled. _Muscina_\r\n\r\n          f. With black legs and palpi. _M. assimilis_\r\n\r\n          ff. With legs more or less yellowish; palpi yellow. Larvae in\r\n              decaying vegetable substances, dung, etc. _M. stabulans_\r\n\r\nIt is almost universally believed that the adults of _Musca domestica_\r\nhibernate, remaining dormant throughout the winter in attics, around\r\nchimneys, and in sheltered but cold situations. This belief has been\r\nchallenged by Skinner (1913), who maintains that all the adult flies die\r\noff during the fall and early winter and that the species is carried\r\nover in the pupal stage, and in no other way. The cluster-fly, _Pollenia\r\nrudis_, undoubtedly does hibernate in attics and similar situations and\r\nis often mistaken for the house-fly. In so far as concerns _Musca\r\ndomestica_, the important question as to hibernation in the adult stage\r\nis an open one. Many observations by one of the writers (Johannsen) tend\r\nto confirm Dr. Skinner's conclusion, in so far as it applies to\r\nconditions in the latitude of New York State. Opposed, is the fact that\r\nvarious experimenters, notably Hewitt (1910) and Jepson (1909) wholly\r\nfailed to carry pupae through the winter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 108. The house or typhoid fly (Musca domestica (x4)).\r\nAfter Howard.]\r\n\r\nThe house-fly breeds by preference in horse manure. Indeed, Dr. Howard,\r\nwhose extensive studies of the species especially qualify him for\r\nexpressing an opinion on the subject, has estimated that under ordinary\r\ncity and town conditions, more than ninety per cent of the flies present\r\nin houses have come from horse stables or their vicinity. They are not\r\nlimited to such localities, by any means, for it has been found that\r\nthey would develop in almost any fermenting organic substance. Thus,\r\nthey have been bred from pig, chicken, and cow manure, dirty waste\r\npaper, decaying vegetation, decaying meat, slaughter-house refuse,\r\nsawdust-sweepings, and many other sources. A fact which makes them\r\nespecially dangerous as disease-carriers is that they breed readily in\r\nhuman excrement.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are pure white, elongate ovoid, somewhat broader at the\r\nanterior end. They measure about one millimeter (1-25 inch) in length.\r\nThey are deposited in small, irregular clusters, one hundred and twenty\r\nto one hundred and fifty from a single fly. A female may deposit as many\r\nas four batches in her life time. The eggs hatch in from eight to\r\ntwenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nThe newly hatched larva, or maggot (fig. 108), measures about two\r\nmillimeters (1-12 inch) in length. It is pointed at the head end and\r\nblunt at the opposite end, where the spiracular openings are borne. It\r\ngrows rapidly, molts three times and reaches maturity in from six to\r\nseven days, under favorable conditions.\r\n\r\nThe pupal stage, like that of related flies, is passed in the old larval\r\nskin which, instead of being molted, becomes contracted and heavily\r\nchitinized, forming the so-called _puparium_ (fig. 108). The pupal stage\r\nmay be completed in from three to six days.\r\n\r\nThus during the warm summer months a generation of flies may be produced\r\nin ten to twelve days. Hewitt at Manchester, England, found the minimum\r\nto be eight days but states that larvae bred in the open air in horse\r\nmanure which had an average daily temperature of 22.5^o C., occupied\r\nfourteen to twenty days in their development, according to the air\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nAfter emergence, a period of time must elapse before the fly is capable\r\nof depositing eggs. This period has been tuned the _preoviposition_\r\nperiod. Unfortunately we have few exact data regarding this period.\r\nHewitt found that the flies became sexually mature in ten to fourteen\r\ndays after their emergence from the pupal state and four days after\r\ncopulation they began to deposit their eggs; in other words the\r\npreoviposition stage was fourteen days or longer. Griffith (1908) found\r\nthis period to be ten days. Dr. Howard believes that the time \"must\r\nsurely be shorter, and perhaps much shorter, under midsummer conditions,\r\nand in the freedom of the open air.\" He emphasizes that the point is of\r\ngreat practical importance, since it is during this period that the\r\ntrapping and other methods of destroying the adult flies, will prove\r\nmost useful.\r\n\r\nHoward estimates that there may be nine generations of flies a year\r\nunder outdoor conditions in places comparable in climate to Washington.\r\nThe number may be considerably increased in warmer climates.\r\n\r\nThe rate at which flies may increase under favorable conditions is\r\nastounding. Various writers have given estimates of the numbers of flies\r\nwhich may develop as the progeny of a single individual, providing all\r\nthe eggs and all the individual flies survived. Thus, Howard estimates\r\nthat from a single female, depositing one hundred and twenty eggs on\r\nApril 15th, there may be by September 10th, 5,598,720,000,000 adults.\r\nFortunately, living forms do not produce in any such mathematical manner\r\nand the chief value of the figures is to illustrate the enormous\r\nstruggle for existence which is constantly taking place in nature.\r\n\r\nFlies may travel for a considerable distance to reach food and shelter,\r\nthough normally they pass to dwellings and other sources of food supply\r\nin the immediate neighborhood of their breeding places. Copeman, Howlett\r\nand Merriman (1911) marked flies by shaking them in a bag containing\r\ncolored chalk. Such flies were repeatedly recovered at distances of\r\neight to one thousand yards and even at a distance of seventeen hundred\r\nyards, nearly a mile.\r\n\r\nHindle and Merriman (1914) continued these experiments on a large scale\r\nat Cambridge, England. They \"do not think it likely that, as a rule,\r\nflies travel more than a quarter of a mile in thickly-housed areas.\" In\r\none case a single fly was recovered at a distance of 770 yards but a\r\npart of this distance was across open fen-land. The surprising fact was\r\nbrought out that flies tend to travel either _against_ or across the\r\nwind. The actual direction followed may be determined either directly by\r\nthe action of the wind (positive anemotropism), or indirectly owing to\r\nthe flies being attracted by any odor that it may convey from a source\r\nof food. They conclude that it is likely that the chief conditions\r\nfavoring the disposal of flies are fine weather and a warm temperature.\r\nThe nature of the locality is another considerable factor. Hodge (1913)\r\nhas shown that when aided by the wind they may fly to much greater\r\ndistances over the water. He reports that at Cleveland, Ohio, the cribs\r\nof the water works, situated a mile and a quarter, five miles, and six\r\nmiles out in Lake Erie are invaded by a regular plague of flies when the\r\nwind blows from the city. Investigation showed that there was absolutely\r\nnothing of any kind in which flies could breed on the crib.\r\n\r\nThe omnivorous habits of the house-fly are matters of everyday\r\nobservation. From our view point, it is sufficient to emphasize that\r\nfrom feeding on excrement, on sputum, on open sores, or on putrifying\r\nmatter, the flies may pass to the food or milk upon the table or to\r\nhealthy mucous membranes, or uncontaminated wounds. There is nothing in\r\nits appearance to tell whether the fly that comes blithely to sup with\r\nyou is merely unclean, or whether it has just finished feeding upon\r\ndejecta teeming with typhoid bacilli.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 100. Pulvillus of foot of house-fly, showing glandular\r\nhairs.]\r\n\r\nThe method of feeding of the house-fly has an important bearing on the\r\nquestion of its ability to transmit pathogenic organisms. Graham-Smith\r\n(1910) has shown that when feeding, flies frequently moisten soluble\r\nsubstances with \"vomit\" which is regurgitated from the crop. This is, of\r\ncourse, loaded with bacteria from previous food. When not sucked up\r\nagain these drops of liquid dry, and produce round marks with an opaque\r\ncenter and rim and an intervening less opaque area. Fly-specks, then,\r\nconsist of both vomit spots and feces. Graham-Smith shows a photograph\r\nof a cupboard window where, on an area six inches square, there were\r\ncounted eleven hundred and two vomit marks and nine fecal deposits.\r\n\r\nFrom a bacteriologist's viewpoint a discussion of the possibility of a\r\nfly's carrying bacteria would seem superfluous. Any exposed object,\r\nanimate or inanimate, is contaminated by bacteria and will transfer them\r\nif brought into contact with suitable culture media, whether such\r\nsubstance be food, or drink, open wounds, or the sterile culture media\r\nof the laboratory. A needle point may convey enough germs to produce\r\ndisease. Much more readily may the house-fly with its covering of hairs\r\nand its sponge-like pulvilli (fig. 109) pick up and transfer bits of\r\nfilth and other contaminated material.\r\n\r\nFor popular instruction this inevitable transfer of germs by the\r\nhouse-fly is strikingly demonstrated by the oft copied illustration of\r\nthe tracks of a fly on a sterile culture plate. Two plates of gelatine\r\nor, better, agar medium are prepared. Over one of these a fly (with\r\nwings clipped) is allowed to walk, the other is kept as a check. Both\r\nare put aside at room temperature, to be examined after twenty-four to\r\nforty-eight hours. At the end of that time, the check plate is as clear\r\nas ever, the one which the fly has walked is dotted with colonies of\r\nbacteria and fungi. The value in the experiment consists in emphasizing\r\nthat by this method we merely render visible what is constantly\r\noccurring in nature.\r\n\r\nA comparable experiment which we use in our elementary laboratory work\r\nis to take three samples of _clean_ (preferably, sterile) fresh milk in\r\nsterile bottles. One of them is plugged with a pledget of cotton, into\r\nthe second is dropped a fly from the laboratory and into the third is\r\ndropped a fly which has been caught feeding upon garbage or other filth.\r\nAfter a minute or two the flies are removed and the vials plugged as was\r\nnumber one. The three are then set aside at room temperature. When\r\nexamined after twenty-four hours the milk in the first vial is either\r\nstill sweet or has a \"clean\" sour odor; that of the remaining two is\r\nvery different, for it has a putrid odor, which is usually more\r\npronounced in the case of sample number three.\r\n\r\nSeveral workers have carried out experiments to determine the number of\r\nbacteria carried by flies under natural conditions. One of the most\r\nextended and best known of these is the series by Esten and Mason\r\n(1908). These workers caught flies from various sources in a sterilized\r\nnet, placed them in a sterile bottle and poured over them a known\r\nquantity of sterilized water, in which they were shaken so as to wash\r\nthe bacteria from their bodies. They found the number of bacteria on a\r\nsingle fly to range from 550 to 6,600,000. Early in the fly season the\r\nnumbers of bacteria on flies are comparatively small, while later the\r\nnumbers are comparatively very large. The place where flies live also\r\ndetermines largely the numbers that they carry. The lowest number, 550,\r\nwas from a fly caught in the bacteriological laboratory, the highest\r\nnumber, 6,600,000 was the average from eighteen swill-barrel flies.\r\nTorrey (1912) made examination of \"wild\" flies from a tenement house\r\ndistrict of New York City. He found \"that the surface contamination of\r\nthese 'wild' flies may vary from 570 to 4,400,000 bacteria per insect,\r\nand the intestinal bacterial content from 16,000 to 28,000,000.\"\r\n\r\nLess well known in this country is the work of Cox, Lewis, and Glynn\r\n(1912). They examined over four hundred and fifty naturally infected\r\nhouse-flies in Liverpool during September and early October. Instead of\r\nwashing the flies they were allowed to swim on the surface of sterile\r\nwater for five, fifteen, or thirty minutes, thus giving natural\r\nconditions, where infection occurs from vomit and dejecta of the flies,\r\nas well as from their bodies. They found, as might be expected, that\r\nflies from either insanitary or congested areas of the city contain far\r\nmore bacteria than those from the more sanitary, less congested, or\r\nsuburban areas. The number of aerobic bacteria from the former varied\r\nfrom 800,000 to 500,000,000 per fly and from the latter from 21,000 to\r\n100,000. The number of intestinal forms conveyed by flies from\r\ninsanitary or congested areas was from 10,000 to 333,000,000 as compared\r\nwith from 100 to 10,000 carried by flies from the more sanitary areas.\r\n\r\nPathogenic bacteria and those allied to the food poisoning group were\r\nonly obtained from the congested or moderately congested areas and not\r\nfrom the suburban areas, where the chances of infestation were less.\r\n\r\nThe interesting fact was brought out that flies caught in milk shops\r\napparently carry and obtain more bacteria than those from other shops\r\nwith exposed food in a similar neighborhood. The writers explained this\r\nas probably due to the fact that milk when accessible, especially during\r\nthe summer months, is suitable culture medium for bacteria, and the\r\nflies first inoculate the milk and later reinoculate themselves, and\r\nthen more of the milk, so establishing a vicious circle.\r\n\r\nThey conclude that in cities where food is plentiful flies rarely\r\nmigrate from the locality in which they are bred, and consequently the\r\nnumber of bacteria which they carry depends upon the general standard\r\nof cleanliness in that locality. Flies caught in a street of modern,\r\nfairly high class, workmen's dwellings forming a sanitary oasis in the\r\nmidst of a slum area, carried far less bacteria than those caught in the\r\nadjacent neighborhood.\r\n\r\nThus, as the amount of dirt carried by flies in any particular locality,\r\nmeasured in the terms of bacteria, bears a definite relation to the\r\nhabits of the people and to the state of the streets, it demonstrates\r\nthe necessity of efficient municipal and domestic cleanliness, if the\r\nfood of the inhabitants is to escape pollution, not only with harmless\r\nbut also with occasional pathogenic bacteria.\r\n\r\nThe above cited work is of a general nature, but, especially in recent\r\nyears, many attempts have been made to determine more specifically the\r\nability of flies to transmit pathogenic organisms. The critical reviews\r\nof Nuttall and Jepson (1909), Howard (1911), and Graham-Smith (1913)\r\nshould be consulted by the student of the subject. We can only cite here\r\na few of the more striking experiments.\r\n\r\nCelli (1888) fed flies on pure cultures of _Bacillus typhosus_ and\r\ndeclared that he was able to recover these organisms from the intestinal\r\ncontents and excrement.\r\n\r\nFirth and Horrocks (1902), cited by Nuttall and Jepson, \"kept _Musca\r\ndomestica_ (also bluebottles) in a large box measuring 4 x 3 x 3 feet,\r\nwith one side made of glass. They were fed on material contaminated with\r\ncultures of _B. typhosus_. Agar plates, litmus, glucose broth and a\r\nsheet of clean paper were at the same time exposed in the box. After a\r\nfew days the plates and broth were removed and incubated with a positive\r\nresult.\" Graham-Smith (1910) \"carried out experiments with large numbers\r\nof flies kept in gauze cages and fed for eight hours on emulsions of _B.\r\ntyphosus_ in syrup. After that time the infested syrup was removed and\r\nthe flies were fed on plain syrup. _B. typhosus_ was isolated up to 48\r\nhours (but not later) from emulsions of their feces and from plates over\r\nwhich they walked.\"\r\n\r\nSeveral other workers, notably Hamilton (1903), Ficker (1903),\r\nBertarelli (1910) Faichnie (1909), and Cochrane (1912), have isolated\r\n_B. typhosus_ from \"wild\" flies, naturally infected. The papers of\r\nFaichnie and of Cochrane we have not seen, but they are quoted in\r\n_extenso_ by Graham-Smith (1913).\r\n\r\nOn the whole, the evidence is conclusive that typhoid germs not only may\r\nbe accidentally carried on the bodies of house-flies but may pass\r\nthrough their bodies and be scattered in a viable condition in the feces\r\nof the fly for at least two days after feeding. Similar, results have\r\nbeen reached in experiments with cholera, tuberculosis and yaws, the\r\nlast-mentioned being a spirochaete disease. Darling (1913) has shown that\r\nmurrina, a trypanosome disease of horses and mules in the Canal zone is\r\ntransmitted by house-flies which feed upon excoriated patches of\r\ndiseased animals and then pass to cuts and galls of healthy animals.\r\n\r\nSince it is clear that flies are abundantly able to disseminate viable\r\npathogenic bacteria, it is important to consider whether they have\r\naccess to such organisms in nature. A consideration of the method of\r\nspread of typhoid will serve to illustrate the way in which flies may\r\nplay an important role.\r\n\r\nTyphoid fever is a specific disease caused by _Bacillus typhosus_, and\r\nby it alone. The causative organism is to be found in the excrement and\r\nurine of patients suffering from the disease. More than that, it is\r\noften present in the dejecta for days, weeks, or even months and years,\r\nafter the individual has recovered from the disease. Individuals so\r\ninfested are known as \"typhoid carriers\" and they, together with those\r\nsuffering from mild cases, or \"walking typhoid,\" are a constant menace\r\nto the health of the community in which they are found.\r\n\r\nHuman excrement is greedily visited by flies, both for feeding and for\r\novipositing. The discharges of typhoid patients, or of chronic\r\n\"carriers,\" when passed in the open, in box privies, or camp latrines,\r\nor the like, serve to contaminate myriads of the insects which may then\r\nspread the germ to human food and drink. Other intestinal diseases may\r\nbe similarly spread. There is abundant epidaemiological evidence that\r\ninfantile diarrhoea, dysentery, and cholera may be so spread.\r\n\r\nStiles and Keister (1913) have shown that spores of _Lamblia\r\nintestinalis_, a flagellate protozoan living in the human intestine, may\r\nbe carried by house-flies. Though this species is not normally\r\npathogenic, one or more species of _Entamoeba_ are the cause of a type\r\nof a highly fatal tropical dysentery. Concerning it, and another\r\nprotozoan parasite of man, they say, \"If flies can carry _Lamblia_\r\nspores measuring 10 to 7u, and bacteria that are much smaller, and\r\nparticles of lime that are much larger, there is no ground to assume\r\nthat flies may not carry _Entamoeba_ and _Trichomonas_ spores.\"\r\n\r\nTuberculosis is one of the diseases which it is quite conceivable may be\r\ncarried occasionally. The sputum of tubercular patients is very\r\nattractive to flies, and various workers, notably Graham-Smith, have\r\nfound that _Musca domestica_ may distribute the bacillus for several\r\ndays after feeding on infected material.\r\n\r\nA type of purulent opthalmia which is very prevalent in Egypt is often\r\nsaid to be carried by flies. Nuttall and Jepson (1909) consider that the\r\nevidence regarding the spread of this disease by flies is conclusive and\r\nthat the possibility of gonorrhoeal secretions being likewise conveyed\r\ncannot be denied.\r\n\r\nMany studies have been published, showing a marked agreement between the\r\noccurrence of typhoid and other intestinal diseases and the prevalence\r\nof house-flies. The most clear-cut of these are the studies of the Army\r\nCommission appointed to investigate the cause of epidemics of enteric\r\nfever in the volunteer camps in the Southern United States during the\r\nSpanish-American War. Though their findings as presented by Vaughan\r\n(1909), have been quoted very many times, they are so germane to our\r\ndiscussion that they will bear repetition:\r\n\r\n\"Flies swarmed over infected fecal matter in the pits and fed upon the\r\nfood prepared for the soldiers in the mess tents. In some instances\r\nwhere lime had recently been sprinkled over the contents of the pits,\r\nflies with their feet whitened with lime were seen walking over the\r\nfood.\" Under such conditions it is no wonder that \"These pests had\r\ninflicted greater loss upon American soldiers than the arms of Spain.\"\r\n\r\nSimilar conditions prevailed in South Africa during the Boer War. Seamon\r\nbelieves that very much of the success of the Japanese in their fight\r\nagainst Russia was due to the rigid precautions taken to prevent the\r\nspread of disease by these insects and other means.\r\n\r\nVeeder has pointed out that the characteristics of a typical fly-borne\r\nepidemic of typhoid are that it occurs in little neighborhood epidemics,\r\nextending by short leaps from house to house, without regard to water\r\nsupply or anything else in common. It tends to follow the direction of\r\nprevailing winds (cf. the conclusions of Hindle and Merriman). It occurs\r\nduring warm weather. Of course, when the epidemic is once well under\r\nway, other factors enter into its spread.\r\n\r\nIn general, flies may be said to be the chief agency in the spread of\r\ntyphoid in villages and camps. In cities with modern sewer systems they\r\nare less important, though even under the best of such conditions, they\r\nare important factors. Howard has emphasized that in such cities there\r\nare still many uncared-for box privies and that, in addition, the\r\ndeposition of feces overnight in uncared-for waste lots and alleys is\r\ncommon.\r\n\r\nNot only unicellular organisms, such as bacteria and protozoa, but also\r\nthe eggs, embryos and larvae of parasitic worms have been found to be\r\ntransported by house-flies. Ransom (1911) has found that _Habronema\r\nmuscae_, a nematode worm often found in adult flies, is the immature\r\nstage of a parasite occurring in the stomach of the horse. The eggs or\r\nembryos passing out with the feces of the horse, are taken up by fly\r\nlarvae and carried over to the imago stage.\r\n\r\nGrassi (1883), Stiles (1889), Calandruccio (1906), and especially Nicoll\r\n(1911), have been the chief investigators of the ability of house-flies\r\nto carry the ova and embryos of human intestinal parasites. Graham-Smith\r\n(1913) summarizes the work along this line as follows:\r\n\r\n\"It is evident from the investigations that have been quoted that\r\nhouse-flies and other species are greatly attracted to the ova of\r\nparasitic worms contained in feces and other materials, and make great\r\nefforts to ingest them. Unless the ova are too large they often succeed,\r\nand the eggs are deposited uninjured in their feces, in some cases up to\r\nthe third day at least. The eggs may also be carried on their legs or\r\nbodies. Under suitable conditions, food and fluids may be contaminated\r\nwith the eggs of various parasitic worms by flies, and in one case\r\ninfection of the human subject has been observed. Feces containing\r\ntape-worm segments may continue to be a source of infection for as long\r\nas a fortnight. Up to the present, however, there is no evidence to show\r\nwhat part flies play in the dissemination of parasitic worms under\r\nnatural conditions.\"\r\n\r\nEnough has been said to show that the house-fly must be dealt with as a\r\ndirect menace to public health. Control measures are not merely matters\r\nof convenience but are of vital importance.\r\n\r\nUnder present conditions the speedy elimination of the house-fly is\r\nimpossible and the first thing to be considered is methods of protecting\r\nfood and drink from contamination. The first of these methods is the\r\nthorough screening of doors and windows to prevent the entrance of\r\nflies. In the case of kitchen doors, the flies, attracted by odors, are\r\nlikely to swarm onto the screen and improve the first opportunity for\r\ngaining an entrance. This difficulty can be largely avoided by\r\nscreening-in the back porch and placing the screen door at one end\r\nrather than directly before the door.\r\n\r\nThe use of sticky fly paper to catch the pests that gain entrance to the\r\nhouse is preferable to the various poisons often used. Of the latter,\r\nformalin (40 per cent formaldehyde) in the proportion of two\r\ntablespoonfuls to a pint of water is very efficient, if all other\r\nliquids are removed or covered, so that the flies must depend on the\r\nformalin for drink. The mixture is said to be made more attractive by\r\nthe addition of sugar or milk, though we have found the plain solution\r\nwholly satisfactory, under proper conditions. It should be emphasized\r\nthat this formalin mixture is not perfectly harmless, as so often\r\nstated. There are on record cases of severe and even fatal poisoning\r\nfrom the accidental drinking of solutions.\r\n\r\nWhen flies are very abundant in a room they can be most readily gotten\r\nrid of by fumigation with sulphur, or by the use of pure pyrethrum\r\npowder either burned or puffed into the air. Herrick (1913) recommends\r\nthe following method: \"At night all the doors and windows of the kitchen\r\nshould be closed; fresh powder should be sprinkled over the stove, on\r\nthe window ledges, tables, and in the air. In the morning flies will be\r\nfound lying around dead or stupified. They may then be swept up and\r\nburned.\" This method has proved very efficaceous in some of the large\r\ndining halls in Ithaca.\r\n\r\nThe writers have had little success in fumigating with the vapors of\r\ncarbolic acid, or carbolic acid and gum camphor, although these methods\r\nwill aid in driving flies from a darkened room.\r\n\r\nAll of these methods are but makeshifts. As Howard has so well put it,\r\n\"the truest and simplest way of attacking the fly problem is to prevent\r\nthem from breeding, by the treatment or abolition of all places in which\r\nthey can breed. To permit them to breed undisturbed and in countless\r\nnumbers, and to devote all our energy to the problem of keeping them out\r\nof our dwellings, or to destroy them after they have once entered in\r\nspite of all obstacles, seems the wrong way to go about it.\"\r\n\r\nWe have already seen that _Musca domestica_ breeds in almost any\r\nfermenting organic material. While it prefers horse manure, it breeds\r\nalso in human feces, cow dung and that of other animals, and in refuse\r\nof many kinds. To efficiently combat the insect, these breeding places\r\nmust be removed or must be treated in some such way as to render them\r\nunsuitable for the development of the larvae. Under some conditions\r\nindividual work may prove effective, but to be truly efficient there\r\nmust be extensive and thorough cooperative efforts.\r\n\r\nManure, garbage, and the like should be stored in tight receptacles and\r\ncarted away at least once a week. The manure may be carted to the fields\r\nand spread. Even in spread manure the larvae may continue their\r\ndevelopment. Howard points out that \"it often happens that after a lawn\r\nhas been heavily manured in early summer the occupants of the house will\r\nbe pestered with flies for a time, but finding no available breeding\r\nplace these disappear sooner or later. Another generation will not breed\r\nin the spread manure.\"\r\n\r\nHutchinson (1914) has emphasized that the larvae of houseflies have\r\ndeeply engrained the habit of migrating in the prepupal stage and has\r\nshown that this offers an important point of attack in attempts to\r\ncontrol the pest. He has suggested that maggot traps might be developed\r\ninto an efficient weapon in the warfare against the house-fly. Certain\r\nit is that the habit greatly simplifies the problem of treating the\r\nmanure for the purpose of killing the larvae.\r\n\r\nThere have been many attempts to find some cheap chemical which would\r\ndestroy fly larvae in horse manure without injuring the bacteria or\r\nreducing the fertilizing values of the manure. The literature abounds in\r\nrecommendations of kerosene, lime, chloride of lime, iron sulphate, and\r\nother substances, but none of them has met the situation. The whole\r\nquestion has been gone into thoroughly by Cook, Hutchinson and Scales\r\n(1914), who tested practically all of the substances which have been\r\nrecommended. They find that by far the most effective, economical, and\r\npractical of the substances is borax in the commercial form in which it\r\nis available throughout the country.\r\n\r\n\"Borax increases the water-soluble nitrogen, ammonia and alkalinity of\r\nmanure and apparently does not permanently injure the bacterial flora.\r\nThe application of manure treated with borax at the rate of 0.62 pound\r\nper eight bushels (10 cubic feet) to soil does not injure the plants\r\nthus far tested, although its cumulative effect, if any, has not been\r\ndetermined.\"\r\n\r\nAs their results clearly show that the substances so often recommended\r\nare inferior to borax, we shall quote in detail their directions for\r\ntreating manure so as to kill fly eggs and maggots.\r\n\r\n\"Apply 0.62 pound borax or 0.75 pound calcined colemanite to every 10\r\ncubic feet (8 bushels) of manure immediately on its removal from the\r\nbarn. Apply the borax particularly around the outer edges of the pile\r\nwith a flour sifter or any fine sieve, and sprinkle two or three gallons\r\nof water over the borax-treated manure.\r\n\r\n\"The reason for applying the borax to the fresh manure immediately after\r\nits removal from the stable is that the flies lay their eggs on the\r\nfresh manure, and borax, when it comes in contact with the eggs,\r\nprevents their hatching. As the maggots congregate at the outer edge of\r\nthe pile, most of the borax should be applied there. The treatment\r\nshould be repeated with each addition of fresh manure, but when the\r\nmanure is kept in closed boxes, less frequent applications will be\r\nsufficient. When the calcined colemanite is available, it may be used at\r\nthe rate of 0.75 pound per 10 cubic feet of manure, and is a cheaper\r\nmeans of killing the maggots. In addition to the application of borax to\r\nhorse manure to kill fly larvae, it may be applied in the same proportion\r\nto other manures, as well as to refuse and garbage. Borax may also be\r\napplied to the floors and crevices in barns, stables, markets, etc., as\r\nwell as to street sweepings, and water should be added as in the\r\ntreatment of horse manure. After estimating the amount of material to be\r\ntreated and weighing the necessary amount of borax, a measure may be\r\nused which will hold the proper amount, thus avoiding the subsequent\r\nweighings.\r\n\r\n\"While it can be safely stated that no injurious action will follow the\r\napplication of manure treated with borax at the rate of 0.62 pound for\r\neight bushels, or even larger amounts in the case of some plants,\r\nnevertheless the borax-treated manure has not been studied in connection\r\nwith the growth of all crops, nor has its cumulative effect been\r\ndetermined. It is therefore recommended that not more than 15 tons per\r\nacre of the borax-treated manure should be applied to the field. As\r\ntruckmen use considerably more than this amount, it is suggested that\r\nall cars containing borax-treated manure be so marked, and that\r\npublic-health officials stipulate in their directions for this treatment\r\nthat not over 0.62 pound for eight bushels of manure be used, as it has\r\nbeen shown that larger amounts of borax will injure most plants. It is\r\nalso recommended that all public-health officials and others, in\r\nrecommending the borax treatment for killing fly eggs and maggots in\r\nmanure, warn the public against the injurious effects of large amounts\r\nof borax on the growth of plants.\"\r\n\r\n\"The amount of manure from a horse varies with the straw or other\r\nbedding used, but 12 or 15 bushels per week represent the approximate\r\namount obtained. As borax costs from five to six cents per pound in\r\n100-pound lots in Washington, it will make the cost of the borax\r\npractically one cent per horse, per day. And if calcined colemanite is\r\npurchased in large shipments the cost should be considerably less.\"\r\n\r\nHodge (1910) has approached the problem of fly extermination from\r\nanother viewpoint. He believes that it is practical to trap flies out of\r\ndoors during the preoviposition period, when they are sexually immature,\r\nand to destroy such numbers of them that the comparatively few which\r\nsurvive will not be able to lay eggs in sufficient numbers to make the\r\nnext generation a nuisance. To the end of capturing them in enormous\r\nnumbers he has devised traps to be fitted over garbage cans, into stable\r\nwindows, and connected with the kitchen window screens. Under some\r\nconditions this method of attack has proved very satisfactory.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important measures for preventing the spread of disease\r\nby flies is the abolition of the common box privy. In villages and rural\r\ndistricts this is today almost the only type to be found. It is the\r\nchief factor in the spread of typhoid and other intestinal diseases, as\r\nwell as intestinal parasites. Open and exposed to myriads of flies which\r\nnot only breed there but which feed upon the excrement, they furnish\r\nideal conditions for spreading contamination. Even where efforts are\r\nmade to cover the contents with dust, or ashes, or lime, flies may\r\ncontinue to breed unchecked. Stiles and Gardner have shown that\r\nhouse-flies buried in a screened stand-pipe forty-eight inches under\r\nsterile sand came to the surface. Other flies of undetermined species\r\nstruggled up through seventy-two inches of sand.\r\n\r\nSo great is the menace of the ordinary box privy that a number of\r\ninexpensive and simple sanitary privies have been designed for use where\r\nthere are not modern sewer systems. Stiles and Lumsden (1911) have given\r\nminute directions for the construction of one of the best types, and\r\ntheir bulletin should be obtained by those interested.\r\n\r\nAnother precaution which is of fundamental importance in preventing the\r\nspread of typhoid, is that of disinfecting all discharges from patients\r\nsuffering with the disease. For this purpose, quick-lime is the cheapest\r\nand is wholly satisfactory. In chamber vessels it should be used in a\r\nquantity equal to that of the discharge to be treated. It should be\r\nallowed to act for two hours. Air-slaked lime is of no value whatever.\r\nChloride of lime, carbolic acid, or formalin may be used, but are more\r\nexpensive. Other intestinal diseases demand similar precautions.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTOMOXYS CALCITRANS, THE STABLE-FLY--It is a popular belief that\r\nhouse-flies bite more viciously just before a rain. As a matter of\r\nfact, the true house-flies never bite, for their mouth-parts are not\r\nfitted for piercing. The basis of the misconception is the fact that a\r\ntrue biting fly, _Stomoxys calcitrans_ (fig. 110), closely resembling\r\nthe house-fly, is frequently found in houses and may be driven in in\r\ngreater numbers by muggy weather. From its usual habitat this fly is\r\nknown as the \"stable-fly\" or, sometimes as the \"biting house-fly.\"\r\n\r\n_Stomoxys calcitrans_ may be separated from the house-fly by the use of\r\nthe key on p. 145. It may be more fully characterized as follows:\r\n\r\nThe eyes of the male are separated by a distance equal to one-fourth of\r\nthe diameter of the head, in the female by one-third. The frontal stripe\r\nis black, the cheeks and margins of the orbits silvery-white. The\r\nantennae are black, the arista feathered on the upper side only. The\r\nproboscis is black, slender, fitted for piercing and projects forward in\r\nfront of the head. The thorax is grayish, marked by four conspicuous,\r\nmore or less complete black longitudinal stripes; the scutellum is\r\npaler; the macrochaetae are black. The abdomen is gray, dorsally with\r\nthree brown spots on the second and third segments and a median spot on\r\nthe fourth. These spots are more pronounced in the female. The legs are\r\nblack, the pulvilli distinct. The wings are hyaline, the vein M_{1+2}\r\nless sharply curved than in the house-fly, the apical cell being thus\r\nmore widely open (cf. fig. 110). Length 7 mm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 110. Stomoxys calcitrans; adult, larva, puparium and\r\ndetails, (x5). After Howard.]\r\n\r\nThis fly is widely distributed, being found the world over. It was\r\nprobably introduced into the United States, but has spread to all parts\r\nof the country. Bishopp (1913) regards it as of much more importance as\r\na pest of domestic animals in the grain belt than elsewhere in the\r\nUnited States. The life-history and habits of this species have assumed\r\na new significance since it has been suggested that it may transmit the\r\nhuman diseases, infantile paralysis and pellagra. In this country, the\r\nmost detailed study of the fly is that of Bishopp (1913) whose data\r\nregarding the life cycle are as follows:\r\n\r\nThe eggs like those of the house-fly, are about one mm. in length. Under\r\na magnifying glass they show a distinct furrow along one side. When\r\nplaced on any moist substance they hatch in from one to three days after\r\nbeing deposited.\r\n\r\nThe larva or maggots (fig. 110) have the typical shape and actions of\r\nmost maggots of the Muscid group. They can be distinguished from those\r\nof the house-fly as the stigma-plates are smaller, much further apart,\r\nwith the slits less sinuous. Development takes place fairly rapidly when\r\nthe proper food conditions are available and the growth is completed\r\nwithin eleven to thirty or more days.\r\n\r\nThe pupa (fig. 110), like that of related flies, undergoes its\r\ndevelopment within the contracted and hardened last larval skin, or\r\npuparium. This is elongate oval, slightly thicker towards the head end,\r\nand one-sixth to one-fourth of an inch in length. The pupal stage\r\nrequires six to twenty days, or in cool weather considerably longer.\r\n\r\nThe life-cycle of the stable-fly is therefore considerably longer than\r\nthat of _Musca domestica_. Bishopp found that complete development might\r\nbe undergone in nineteen days, but that the average period was somewhat\r\nlonger, ranging from twenty-one to twenty-five days, where conditions\r\nare very favorable. The longest period which he observed was forty-three\r\ndays, though his finding of full grown larvae and pupae in straw during\r\nthe latter part of March, in Northern Texas, showed that development may\r\nrequire about three months, as he considered that these stages almost\r\ncertainly developed from eggs deposited the previous December.\r\n\r\nThe favorite breeding place, where available, seems to be straw or\r\nmanure mixed with straw. It also breeds in great numbers in\r\nhorse-manure, in company with _Musca domestica_.\r\n\r\nNewstead considers that in England the stable-fly hibernates in the\r\npupal stage. Bishopp finds that in the southern part of the United\r\nStates there is no true hibernation, as the adults have been found to\r\nemerge at various times during the winter. He believes that in the\r\nnorthern United States the winter is normally passed in the larval and\r\npupal stages, and that the adults which have been observed in heated\r\nstables in the dead of winter were bred out in refuse within the warm\r\nbarns and were not hibernating adults.\r\n\r\nGraham-Smith (1913) states that although the stable-fly frequents stable\r\nmanure, it is probably not an important agent in distributing the\r\norganisms of intestinal diseases. Bishopp makes the important\r\nobservation that \"it has never been found breeding in human excrement\r\nand does not frequent malodorous places, which are so attractive to the\r\nhouse-fly. Hence it is much less likely to carry typhoid and other germs\r\nwhich may be found in such places.\"\r\n\r\nQuestions of the possible agency of _Stomoxys calcitrans_ in the\r\ntransmission of infantile paralysis and of pellagra, we shall consider\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER ARTHROPODS WHICH MAY SERVE AS SIMPLE CARRIERS OF PATHOGENIC\r\nORGANISMS--It should be again emphasized that any insect which has\r\naccess to, and comes in contact with, pathogenic organisms and then\r\npasses to the food, or drink, or the body of man, may serve as a simple\r\ncarrier of disease. In addition to the more obvious illustrations, an\r\ninteresting one is the previously cited case of the transfer of\r\n_Dermatobia cyaniventris_ by a mosquito (fig. 81-84). Darling (1913) has\r\nshown that in the tropics, the omnipresent ants may be important factors\r\nin the spread of disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nARTHROPODS AS DIRECT INOCULATORS OF DISEASE GERMS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen that any insect which, like the house-fly, has access to\r\ndisease germs and then comes into contact with the food or drink of man,\r\nmay serve to disseminate disease. Moreover, it has been clearly\r\nestablished that a contaminated insect, alighting upon wounded or\r\nabraded surfaces, may infect them. These are instances of mere\r\naccidental, mechanical transfer of pathogenic organisms.\r\n\r\nClosely related are the instances of direct inoculation of disease germs\r\nby insects and other arthropods. In this type, a blood-sucking species\r\nnot only takes up the germs but, passing to a healthy individual, it\r\ninserts its contaminated mouth-parts and thus directly inoculates its\r\nvictim. In other words, the disease is transferred just as blood\r\npoisoning may be induced by the prick of a contaminated needle, or as\r\nthe laboratory worker may inoculate an experimental animal.\r\n\r\nFormerly, it was supposed that this method of the transfer of disease by\r\narthropods was a very common one and many instances are cited in the\r\nearlier literature of the subject. It is, however, difficult to draw a\r\nsharp line between such cases and those in which, on the one hand, the\r\narthropod serves as a mere passive carrier or, on the other hand, serves\r\nas an essential host of the pathogenic organism. More critical study of\r\nthe subject has led to the belief that the importance of the role of\r\narthropods as direct inoculators has been much overestimated.\r\n\r\nThe principal reason for regarding this phase of the subject as\r\nrelatively unimportant, is derived from a study of the habits of the\r\nblood-sucking species. It is found that, in general, they are\r\nintermittent feeders, visiting their hosts at intervals and then\r\nabstaining from feeding for a more or less extended period, while\r\ndigesting their meal. In the meantime, most species of bacteria or of\r\nprotozoan parasites with which they might have contaminated their\r\nmouth-parts, would have perished, through inability to withstand drying.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this, it must be recognized that this method of transfer\r\ndoes occur and must be reckoned with in any consideration of the\r\nrelations of insects to disease. We shall first cite some general\r\nillustrations and shall then discuss the role of fleas in the spreading\r\nof bubonic plague, an illustration which cannot be regarded as typical,\r\nsince it involves more than mere passive carriage.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOME ILLUSTRATIONS OF DIRECT INOCULATION OF DISEASE GERMS BY ARTHROPODS\r\n\r\nIn discussing poisonous arthropods, we have already emphasized that\r\nspecies which are of themselves innocuous to man, may occasionally\r\nintroduce bacteria by their bite or sting and thus cause more or less\r\nsevere secondary symptoms. That such cases should occur, is no more than\r\nis to be expected. The mouth-parts or the sting of the insect are not\r\nsterile and the chances of their carrying pyogenic organisms are always\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nMore strictly falling in the category of transmission of disease germs\r\nby direct inoculation are the instances where the insect, or related\r\nform, feeds upon a diseased animal and passes promptly to a healthy\r\nindividual which it infects. Of such a nature are the following:\r\n\r\nVarious species of biting flies are factors in the dissemination of\r\nanthrax, an infectious and usually fatal disease of animals and,\r\noccasionally, of man. That the bacteria with which the blood of diseased\r\nanimals teem shortly before death might be transmitted by such insects\r\nhas long been contended, but the evidence in support of the view has\r\nbeen unsatisfactory. Recently, Mitzmain (1914) has reported a series of\r\nexperiments which show conclusively that the disease may be so conveyed\r\nby a horse-fly, _Tabanus striatus_, and by the stable-fly, _Stomoxys\r\ncalcitrans_.\r\n\r\nMitzmain's experiments were tried with an artificially infected guinea\r\npig, which died of the disease upon the third day. The flies were\r\napplied two and one-half hours, to a few minutes, before the death of\r\nthe animal. With both species the infection was successfully transferred\r\nto healthy guinea pigs by the direct method, in which the flies were\r\ninterrupted while feeding on the sick animal. The evidence at hand does\r\nnot warrant the conclusion that insect transmission is the rule in the\r\ncase of this disease.\r\n\r\nThe nagana, or tsetse-fly disease of cattle is the most virulent disease\r\nof domestic animals in certain parts of Africa. It is caused by a\r\nprotozoan blood parasite, _Trypanosoma brucei_, which is conveyed to\r\nhealthy animals by the bite of _Glossina morsitans_ and possibly other\r\nspecies of tsetse-flies. The flies remain infective for forty-eight\r\nhours after feeding on a diseased animal. The insect also serves as an\r\nessential host of the parasite.\r\n\r\nSurra, a similar trypanosomiasis affecting especially horses and mules,\r\noccurs in southern Asia, Malaysia, and the Philippines where the\r\ntsetse-flies are not to be found. It is thought to be spread by various\r\nspecies of blood-sucking flies belonging to the genera _Stomoxys_,\r\n_Haematobia_, and _Tabanus_. Mitzmain (1913) demonstrated that in the\r\nPhilippines it is conveyed mechanically by _Tabanus striatus_.\r\n\r\nThe sleeping sickness of man, in Africa, has also been supposed to be\r\ndirectly inoculated by one, or several, species of tsetse-flies. It is\r\nnow known that the fly may convey the disease for a short time after\r\nfeeding, but that there is then a latent period of from fourteen to\r\ntwenty-one days, after which it again becomes infectious. This indicates\r\nthat in the meantime the parasite has been undergoing some phase of its\r\nlife-cycle and that the fly serves as an intermediate host. We shall\r\ntherefore consider it more fully under that grouping.\r\n\r\nThese are a few of the cases of direct inoculation which may be cited as\r\nof the simpler type. We shall next consider the role of the flea in the\r\ndissemination of the bubonic plague, an illustration complicated by the\r\nfact that the bacillus multiples within the insect and may be indirectly\r\ninoculated.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ROLE OF FLEAS IN THE TRANSMISSION OF THE PLAGUE\r\n\r\nThe plague is a specific infectious disease caused by _Bacillus pestis_.\r\nIt occurs in several forms, of which the bubonic and the pneumonic are\r\nthe most common. According to Wyman, 80 per cent of the human cases are\r\nof the bubonic type. It is a disease which, under the name of oriental\r\nplague, the pest, or the black death, has ravaged almost from time\r\nimmemorial the countries of Africa, Asia, and Europe. The record of its\r\nravages are almost beyond belief. In 542 A. D. it caused in one day ten\r\nthousand deaths in Constantinople. In the 14th century it was introduced\r\nfrom the East and prevailed throughout Armenia, Asia Minor, Egypt and\r\nNorthern Africa and Europe. Hecker estimates that one-fourth of the\r\npopulation of Europe, or twenty-five million persons, died in the\r\nepidemic of that century. From then until the 17th century it was almost\r\nconstantly present in Europe, the great plague of London, in 1665\r\nkilling 68,596 out of a population of 460,000. Such an epidemic would\r\nmean for New York City a proportionate loss of over 600,000 in a single\r\nyear. It is little wonder that in the face of such an appalling disaster\r\nsuspicion and credulity were rife and the wildest demoralization ensued.\r\n\r\nDuring the 14th century the Jews were regarded as responsible for the\r\ndisease, through poisoning wells, and were subjected to the most\r\nincredible persecution and torture. In Milan the visitation of 1630 was\r\ncredited to the so-called anointers,--men who were supposed to spread\r\nthe plague by anointing the walls with magic ointment--and the most\r\nhorrible tortures that human ingenuity could devise were imposed on\r\nscores of victims, regardless of rank or of public service (fig. 112,\r\na). Manzoni's great historical novel, \"The Betrothed\" has well pictured\r\nconditions in Italy during this period.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 111. A contemporaneous engraving of the pest hospital in\r\nVienna in 1679. After Peters.]\r\n\r\nIn modern times the plague is confined primarily to warm climates, a\r\ncondition which has been brought about largely through general\r\nimprovement in sanitary conditions.\r\n\r\nAt present, the hotbed of the disease is India, where there were\r\n1,040,429 deaths in 1904 and where in a period of fifteen years, ending\r\nwith January 1912, there were over 15,000,000 deaths. The reported\r\ndeaths in that country for 1913 totaled 198,875.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter of 1910-11 there occurred in Manchuria and North China\r\na virulent epidemic of the pneumonic plague which caused the death of\r\nnearly 50,000 people. The question as to its origin and means of spread\r\nwill be especially referred to later.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 112 a. A medieval method of combating the plague. The\r\npersecution of the anointers in Milan in 1630. From a copy of \"Il\r\nprocessi originale degli untori\" in the library of Cornell University.]\r\n\r\nUntil recent years, the plague had not been known to occur in the New\r\nWorld but there were outbreaks in Brazil and Hawaii in 1899, and in 1900\r\nthere occurred the first cases in San Francisco. In California there\r\nwere 125 cases in the period 1900-04; three cases in the next three\r\nyears and then from May 1907 to March 1908, during the height of the\r\noutbreak, 170 cases. Since that time there have been only sporadic\r\ncases, the last case reported being in May 1914. Still more recent were\r\nthe outbreaks in the Philippine Islands, Porto Rico, and Cuba.\r\n\r\nOn June 24, 1914, there was recognized a case of human plague in New\r\nOrleans. The Federal Health Service immediately took charge, and\r\nmeasures for the eradication of the disease were vigorously enforced. Up\r\nto October 10, 1914 there had been reported 30 cases of the disease in\r\nman, and 181 cases of plague in rats.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 112 b. The modern method of combating the plague. A day's\r\ncatch of rats in the fight against plague in San Francisco. Courtesy of\r\nReview of Reviews.]\r\n\r\nThe present-day methods of combating bubonic plague are well illustrated\r\nby the fight in San Francisco. Had it not been for the strenuous and\r\nradical anti-plague campaign directed by the United States Marine\r\nHospital Service we might have had in our own country an illustration of\r\nwhat the disease can accomplish. On what newly acquired knowledge was\r\nthis fight based?\r\n\r\nThe basis was laid in 1894, when the plague bacillus was first\r\ndiscovered. All through the centuries, before and during the Christian\r\nera, down to 1894, the subject was enveloped in darkness and there had\r\nbeen a helpless, almost hopeless struggle in ignorance on the part of\r\nphysicians, sanitarians, and public health officials against the ravages\r\nof this dread disease. Now its cause, method of propagation and means to\r\nprevent its spread are matters of scientific certainty.\r\n\r\nAfter the discovery of the causative organism, one of the first advances\r\nwas the establishment of the identity of human plague and that of\r\nrodents. It had often been noted that epidemics of the human disease\r\nwere preceded by great epizootics among rats and mice. So well\r\nestablished was this fact that with the Chinese, unusual mortality among\r\nthese rodents was regarded as foretelling a visitation of the human\r\ndisease. That there was more than an accidental connection between the\r\ntwo was obvious when Yersin, the discoverer of _Bacillus pestis_,\r\nannounced that during an epidemic the rats found dead in the houses and\r\nin the streets almost always contain the bacillus in great abundance in\r\ntheir organs, and that many of them exhibit veritable buboes.\r\n\r\nOnce it was established that the diseases were identical, the attention\r\nof the investigators was directed to a study of the relations between\r\nthat of rats and of humans, and evidence accumulated to show that the\r\nbubonic plague was primarily a disease of rodents and that in some\r\nmanner it was conveyed from them to man.\r\n\r\nThere yet remained unexplained the method of transfer from rat to man.\r\nAs long ago as the 16th century, Mercuralis suggested that house-flies\r\nwere guilty of disseminating the plague but modern investigation, while\r\nblaming the fly for much in the way of spreading disease, show that it\r\nis an insignificant factor in this case.\r\n\r\nSearch for blood-sucking insects which would feed on both rodents and\r\nman, and which might therefore be implicated, indicated that the fleas\r\nmost nearly met the conditions. At first it was urged that rat fleas\r\nwould not feed upon man and that the fleas ordinarily attacking man\r\nwould not feed upon rats. More critical study of the habits of fleas\r\nsoon showed that these objections were not well-founded. Especially\r\nimportant was the evidence that soon after the death of their host, rat\r\nfleas deserted its body and might then become a pest in houses where\r\nthey had not been noticed before.\r\n\r\nAttention was directed to the fact that while feeding, fleas are in the\r\nhabit of squirting blood from the anus and that in the case of those\r\nwhich had fed upon rats and mice dying of the plague, virulent plague\r\nbacilli were to be found in such blood. Liston (1905) even found, and\r\nsubsequent investigations confirmed, that the plague bacilli multiply in\r\nthe stomach of the insect and that thus the blood ejected was richer in\r\nthe organisms than was that of the diseased animal. It was found that a\r\nfilm of this infected blood spread out under the body of the flea and\r\nthat thus the bacilli might be inoculated by the bite of the insect and\r\nby scratching.\r\n\r\nVery recently, Bacot and Martin (1914) have paid especial attention to\r\nthe question of the mechanism of the transmission of the plague bacilli\r\nby fleas. They believe that plague infested fleas regurgitate blood\r\nthrough the mouth, and that under conditions precluding the possibility\r\nof infection by dejecta, the disease may be thus transmitted. The\r\nevidence does not seem sufficient to establish that this is the chief\r\nmethod of transmission.\r\n\r\nConclusive experimental proof that fleas transmit the disease is further\r\navailable from a number of sources. The most extensive series of\r\nexperiments is that of the English Plague Commission in India, which\r\nreported in 1906 that:\r\n\r\nOn thirty occasions a healthy rat contracted plague in sequence of\r\nliving in the neighborhood of a plague infected rat under circumstances\r\nwhich prevented the healthy rat coming in contact with either the body\r\nor excreta of the diseased animal.\r\n\r\nIn twenty-one experiments out of thirty-eight, healthy rats living in\r\nflea-proof cages contracted plague when exposed to rat fleas\r\n(_Xenopsylla cheopis_), collected from rats dead or dying of septicaemic\r\nplague.\r\n\r\nClose contact of plague-infected with healthy animals, if fleas are\r\nexcluded, does not give rise to an epizootic among the latter. As the\r\nhuts were never cleaned out, close contact included contact with feces\r\nand urine of infected animals, and contact with, and eating of food\r\ncontaminated with feces and urine of infected animals, as well as pus\r\nfrom open plague ulcers. Close contact of young, even when suckled by\r\nplague-infected mothers, did not give the disease to the former.\r\n\r\nIf fleas are present, then the epizootic, once started, spreads from\r\nanimal to animal, the rate of progress being in direct proportion to the\r\nnumber of fleas.\r\n\r\nAerial infection was excluded. Thus guinea-pigs suspended in a cage two\r\nfeet above the ground did not contract the disease, while in the same\r\nhut those animals allowed to run about and those placed two inches above\r\nthe floor became infected. It had previously been found that a rat flea\r\ncould not hop farther than about five inches.\r\n\r\nGuinea pigs and monkeys were placed in plague houses in pairs, both\r\nprotected from soil contact infection and both equally exposed to aerial\r\ninfection, but one surrounded with a layer of tangle-foot paper and the\r\nother surrounded with a layer of sand. The following observations were\r\nmade:\r\n\r\n(_a_) Many fleas were caught in the tangle-foot, a certain proportion of\r\nwhich were found on dissection to contain in their stomachs abundant\r\nbacilli microscopically identical with plague bacilli. Out of\r\neighty-five human fleas dissected only one contained these bacilli,\r\nwhile out of seventy-seven rat fleas twenty-three were found thus\r\ninfected.\r\n\r\n(_b_) The animals surrounded with tangle-foot in no instance developed\r\nplague, while several (24 per cent) of the non-protected animals died of\r\nthe disease.\r\n\r\nThus, the experimental evidence that fleas transmit the plague from rat\r\nto rat, from rats to guinea pigs, and from rats to monkeys is\r\nindisputable. There is lacking direct experimental proof of its transfer\r\nfrom rodents to man but the whole chain of indirect evidence is so\r\ncomplete that there can be no doubt that such a transfer does occur so\r\ncommonly that in the case of bubonic plague it must be regarded as the\r\nnormal method.\r\n\r\nRats are not the only animals naturally attacked by the plague but as\r\nalready suggested, it occurs in various other rodents. In California the\r\ndisease has spread from rats to ground squirrels (_Otospermophilus\r\nbeecheyi_), a condition readily arising from the frequency of\r\nassociation of rats with the squirrels in the neighborhood of towns, and\r\nfrom the fact that the two species of fleas found on them are also found\r\non rats. While the danger of the disease being conveyed from squirrels\r\nto man is comparatively slight, the menace in the situation is that the\r\nsquirrels may become a more or less permanent reservoir of the disease\r\nand infect rats, which may come into more frequent contact with man.\r\n\r\nThe tarbagan (_Arctomys bobac_), is a rodent found in North Manchuria,\r\nwhich is much prized for its fur. It is claimed that this animal is\r\nextremely susceptible to the plague and there is evidence to indicate\r\nthat it was the primary source of the great outbreak of pneumonic plague\r\nwhich occurred in Manchuria and North China during the winter of\r\n1910-11.\r\n\r\nOf fleas, any species which attacks both rodents and man may be an agent\r\nin the transmission of the plague. We have seen that in India the\r\nspecies most commonly implicated is the rat flea, _Xenopsylla cheopis_,\r\n(= _Loemopsylla_ or _Pulex cheopis_) (fig. 89). This species has also\r\nbeen found commonly on rats in San Francisco. The cat flea,\r\n_Ctenocephalus felis_, the dog flea, _Ctenocephalus canis_, the human\r\nflea, _Pulex irritans_, the rat fleas, _Ceratophyllus fasciatus_ and\r\n_Ctenopsyllus musculi_ have all been shown to meet the conditions.\r\n\r\nBut, however clear the evidence that fleas are the most important agent\r\nin the transfer of plague, it is a mistake fraught with danger to assume\r\nthat they are the only factor in the spread of the disease. The\r\ncausative organism is a bacillus and is not dependent upon any insect\r\nfor the completion of its development.\r\n\r\nTherefore, any blood-sucking insect which feeds upon a plague infected\r\nman or animal and then passes to a healthy individual, conceivably might\r\ntransfer the bacilli. Verjbitski (1908) has shown experimentally that\r\nbed-bugs may thus convey the disease. Hertzog found the bacilli in a\r\nhead-louse, _Pediculus humanus_, taken from a child which had died from\r\nthe plague, and McCoy found them in a louse taken from a plague-infected\r\nsquirrel. On account of their stationary habits, the latter insects\r\ncould be of little significance in spreading the disease.\r\n\r\nContaminated food may also be a source of danger. While this source,\r\nformerly supposed to be the principal one, is now regarded as\r\nunimportant, there is abundant experimental evidence to show that it\r\ncannot be disregarded. It is believed that infection in this way can\r\noccur only when there is some lesion in the alimentary canal.\r\n\r\nStill more important is the proof that in pneumonic plague the patient\r\nis directly infective and that the disease is spread from man to man\r\nwithout any intermediary. Especially conclusive is the evidence obtained\r\nby Drs. Strong and Teague during the Manchurian epidemic of 1910-11.\r\nThey found that during coughing, in pneumonic plague cases, even when\r\nsputum visible to the naked eye is not expelled, plague bacilli in large\r\nnumbers may become widely disseminated into the surrounding air. By\r\nexposing sterile plates before patients who coughed a single time, very\r\nnumerous colonies of the bacillus were obtained.\r\n\r\nBut the great advance which has been made rests on the discovery that\r\nbubonic plague is in the vast majority of cases transmitted by the flea.\r\nThe pneumonic type forms a very small percentage of the human cases and\r\neven with it, the evidence indicates that the original infection is\r\nderived from a rodent through the intermediary of the insect.\r\n\r\nSo modern prophylactic measures are directed primarily against the rat\r\nand fleas. Ships coming from infected ports are no longer disinfected\r\nfor the purpose of killing the plague germs, but are fumigated to\r\ndestroy the rats and the fleas which they might harbor. When anchored at\r\ninfected ports, ships must observe strenuous precautions to prevent the\r\ningress of rats. Cargo must be inspected just before being brought on\r\nboard, in order to insure its freedom from rats. Even lines and hawsers\r\nmust be protected by large metal discs or funnels, for rats readily run\r\nalong a rope to reach the ship. Once infested, the ship must be\r\nthoroughly fumigated, not only to avoid carrying the disease to other\r\nports but to obviate an outbreak on board.\r\n\r\nWhen an epidemic begins, rats must be destroyed by trapping and\r\npoisoning. Various so-called biological poisons have not proved\r\npracticable. Sources of food supply should be cut off by thorough\r\ncleaning up, by use of rat-proof garbage cans and similar measures. Hand\r\nin hand with these, must go the destruction of breeding places, and the\r\nrat-proofing of dwellings, stables, markets, warehouses, docks and\r\nsewers. All these measures are expensive, and a few years ago would have\r\nbeen thought wholly impossible to put into practice but now they are\r\nbeing enforced on a large scale in every fight against the disease.\r\n\r\nRats and other rodents are regularly caught in the danger zone and\r\nexamined for evidence of infection, for the sequence of the epizootic\r\nand of the human disease is now understood. In London, rats are\r\nregularly trapped and poisoned in the vicinity of the principal docks,\r\nto guard against the introduction of infected animals in shipping.\r\nDuring the past six years infected rats have been found yearly, thirteen\r\nhaving been found in 1912. In Seattle, Washington, seven infected rats\r\nwere found along the water front in October, 1913, and infected ground\r\nsquirrels are still being found in connection with the anti-plague\r\nmeasures in California.\r\n\r\nThe procedure during an outbreak of the human plague was well\r\nillustrated by the fight in San Francisco. The city was districted, and\r\ncaptured rats, after being dipped in some fluid to destroy the fleas,\r\nwere carefully tagged to indicate their source, and were sent to the\r\nlaboratory for examination. If an infected rat was found, the officers\r\nin charge of the work in the district involved were immediately notified\r\nby telephone, and the infected building was subjected to a thorough\r\nfumigation. In addition, special attention was given to all the\r\nterritory in the four contiguous blocks.\r\n\r\nBy measures such as these, this dread scourge of the human race is being\r\nbrought under control. Incidentally, the enormous losses due to the\r\ndirect ravages of rats are being obviated and this alone would justify\r\nthe expenditure many times over of the money and labor involved in the\r\nanti-rat measures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nARTHROPODS AS ESSENTIAL HOSTS OF PATHOGENIC ORGANISMS\r\n\r\n\r\nWe now have to consider the cases in which the arthropod acts as the\r\nessential host of a pathogenic organism. In other words, cases in which\r\nthe organism, instead of being passively carried or merely accidentally\r\ninoculated by the bite of its carrier, or vector, is taken up and\r\nundergoes an essential part of its development within the arthropod.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 113. Dipylidium caninum. The double pored tapeworm of the\r\ndog.]\r\n\r\nIn some cases, the sexual cycle of the parasite is undergone in the\r\narthropod, which then serves as the _definitive_ or _primary host_. In\r\nother cases, it is the asexual stage of the parasite which is undergone,\r\nand the arthropod then acts as the _intermediate host_. This distinction\r\nis often overlooked and all the cases incorrectly referred to as those\r\nin which the insect or other arthropod acts as intermediate host.\r\n\r\nWe have already emphasized that this is the most important way in which\r\ninsects may transmit disease, for without them the particular organisms\r\nconcerned could never complete their development. Exterminate the\r\narthropod host and the life cycle of the parasite is broken, the disease\r\nis exterminated.\r\n\r\nAs the phenomenon of alternation of generations, as exhibited by many of\r\nthe parasitic protozoa, is a complicated one and usually new to the\r\nstudent, we shall first take up some of the grosser cases illustrated by\r\ncertain parasitic worms. There is the additional reason that these were\r\nthe first cases known of arthropod transmission of pathogenic organisms.\r\n\r\n\r\nINSECTS AS INTERMEDIATE HOSTS OF TAPEWORMS\r\n\r\nA number of tapeworms are known to undergo their sexual stage in an\r\ninsect or other arthropod. Of these at least two are occasional\r\nparasites of man.\r\n\r\n_Dipylidium caninum_ (figs. 113 and 114), more generally known as\r\n_Taenia cucumerina_ or _T. elliptica_, is the commonest intestinal\r\nparasite of pet dogs and cats. It is occasionally found as a human\r\nparasite, 70 per cent of the cases reported being in young children.\r\n\r\nIn 1869, Melnikoff found in a dog louse, _Trichodectes canis_, some\r\npeculiar bodies which Leuckart identified as the larval form of this\r\ntapeworm. The worm is, however, much more common in dogs and cats than\r\nis the skin parasite, and hence it appears that the _Trichodectes_ could\r\nnot be the only intermediate host. In 1888, Grassi found that it could\r\nalso develop in the cat and dog fleas, _Ctenocephalus felis_ and _C.\r\ncanis_, and in the human flea, _Pulex irritans_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 114. Dipylidium caninum. Rostrum evaginated and\r\ninvaginated. After Blanchard.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 115. Dipylidium caninum. Immature cysticercoid. After\r\nGrassi and Rovelli.]\r\n\r\nThe eggs, scattered among the hairs of the dog or cat, are ingested by\r\nthe insect host and in its body cavity they develop into pyriform\r\nbodies, about 300u in length, almost entirely destitute of a bladder,\r\nbut in the immature stage provided with a caudal appendage (fig. 115).\r\nWithin the pear-shaped body (fig. 116) are the invaginated head and\r\nsuckers of the future tapeworm. This larval form is known as a\r\ncysticercoid, in contradistinction to the bladder-like cysticercus of\r\nmany other cestodes. It is often referred to in literature as\r\n_Cryptocystis trichodectis_ Villot.\r\n\r\nAs many as fifty of the cysticercoids have been found in the body cavity\r\nof a single flea. When the dog takes up an infested flea or louse, by\r\nbiting itself, or when the cat licks them up, the larvae quickly develop\r\ninto tapeworms, reaching sexual maturity in about twenty days in the\r\nintestine of their host. Puppies and kittens are quickly infested when\r\nsuckling a flea-infested mother, the developing worms having been found\r\nin the intestines of puppies not more than five or six days old.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 116. Dipylidium caninum. Cysticercoid. After Villet.]\r\n\r\nInfestation of human beings occurs only through accidental ingestion of\r\nan infested flea. It is natural that such cases should occur largely in\r\nchildren, where they may come about in some such way as illustrated in\r\nthe accompanying figures 117 and 118.\r\n\r\n_Hymenolepis diminuta_, very commonly living in the intestine of mice\r\nand rats, is also known to occur in man. Its cysticercoid develops in\r\nthe body cavity of a surprising range of meal-infesting insects. Grassi\r\nand Rovelli (abstract in Ransom, 1904) found it in the larvae and adult\r\nof a moth, _Asopia farinalis_, in the earwig, _Anisolabis annulipes_,\r\nthe Tenebrionid beetles _Akis spinosa_ and _Scaurus striatus_. Grassi\r\nconsiders that the lepidopter is the normal intermediate host. The\r\ninsect takes up the eggs scattered by rats and mice. It has been\r\nexperimentally demonstrated that man may develop the tapeworm by\r\nswallowing infested insects. Natural infection probably occurs by\r\ningesting such insects with cereals, or imperfectly cooked foods.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 117. One way in which Dipylidium infection in children\r\nmay occur. After Blanchard.]\r\n\r\n_Hymenolepis lanceolata_, a parasite of geese and ducks, has been\r\nreported once for man. The supposed cysticercoid occurs in various small\r\ncrustaceans of the family Cyclopidae.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 118. The probable method by which Dipylidium infection\r\nusually occurs.]\r\n\r\nSeveral other cestode parasites of domestic animals are believed to\r\ndevelop their intermediate stage in certain arthropods. Among these may\r\nbe mentioned:\r\n\r\n_Choanotaenia infundibulformis_, of chickens, developing in the house-fly\r\n(Grassi and Rovelli);\r\n\r\n_Davainea cesticillus_, of chickens, in some lepidopter or coleopter\r\n(Grassi and Rovelli);\r\n\r\n_Hymenolepis anatina_, _H. gracilis_, _H. sinuosa_, _H. coronula_ and\r\n_Fimbriaria fasciolaris_, all occurring in ducks, have been reported as\r\ndeveloping in small aquatic crustaceans. In these cases, cysticercoids\r\nhave been found which, on account of superficial characters, have been\r\nregarded as belonging to the several species, but direct experimental\r\nevidence is scant.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTHROPODS AS INTERMEDIATE HOSTS OF NEMATODE WORMS\r\n\r\n\r\nFILARIASIS AND MOSQUITOES--A number of species of Nematode worms\r\nbelonging to the genus _Filaria_, infest man and other vertebrates and\r\nin the larval condition are to be found in the blood. Such infestation\r\nis known as _filariasis_. The sexually mature worms are to be found in\r\nthe blood, the lymphatics, the mesentery and subcutaneous connective\r\ntissue. In the cases best studied it has been found that the larval\r\nforms are taken up by mosquitoes and undergo a transformation before\r\nthey can attain maturity in man.\r\n\r\nThe larvae circulating in the blood are conveniently designated as\r\nmicrofilariae. In this stage they are harmless and only one species,\r\n_Filaria bancrofti_, appears to be of any great pathological\r\nsignificance at any stage.\r\n\r\n_Filaria bancrofti_ in its adult state, lives in the lymphatics of man.\r\nThough often causing no injury it has been clearly established that they\r\nand their eggs may cause various disorders due to stoppage of the\r\nlymphatic trunks (fig. 119). Manson lists among other effects, abscess,\r\nvaricose groin glands, lymph scrotum, chyluria, and elephantiasis.\r\n\r\nThe geographical distribution of this parasite is usually given as\r\ncoextensive with that of elephantiasis, but it is by no means certain\r\nthat it is the only cause of this disease and so actual findings of the\r\nparasites are necessary. Manson reports that it is \"an indigenous\r\nparasite in almost every country throughout the tropical and subtropical\r\nworld, as far north as Spain in Europe and Charlestown in the United\r\nStates, and as far south as Brisbane in Australia.\" In some sections,\r\nfully 50 per cent of the natives are infested. Labredo (1910) found\r\n17.82 per cent infestation in Havana.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 119. Elephantiasis in Man. From \"New Sydenham Society's\r\nAtlas.\"]\r\n\r\nThe larval forms of _Filaria bancrofti_ were first discovered in 1863,\r\nby Demarquay, in a case of chylous dropsy. They were subsequently noted\r\nunder similar conditions, by several workers, and by Wucherer in the\r\nurine of twenty-eight cases of tropical chyluria, but in 1872 Lewis\r\nfound that the blood of man was the normal habitat, and gave them the\r\nname _Filaria sanguinis hominis_. The adult worm was found in 1876 by\r\nBancroft, and in 1877, Cobbold gave it the name _Filaria bancrofti_. It\r\nhas since been found repeatedly in various parts of the lymphatic\r\nsystem, and its life-history has been the subject of detailed studies by\r\nManson (1884), Bancroft (1899), Low (1900), Grassi and Noe (1900), Noe\r\n(1901) and Fulleborn (1910).\r\n\r\nThe larvae as they exist in the circulating blood, exhibit a very active\r\nwriggling movement, without material progression. They may exist in\r\nenormous numbers, as many as five or six hundred swarming in a single\r\ndrop of blood. This is the more surprising when we consider that they\r\nmeasure about 300u x 8u, that is, their width is equal to the diameter\r\nof the red blood corpuscle of their host and their length over\r\nthirty-seven times as great.\r\n\r\nTheir organs are very immature and the structure obscure. When they have\r\nquieted down somewhat in a preparation it may be seen that at the head\r\nend there is a six-lipped and very delicate prepuce, enclosing a short\r\n\"fang\" which may be suddenly exserted and retracted. Completely\r\nenclosing the larva is a delicate sheath, which is considerably longer\r\nthan the worm itself. To enter into further details of anatomy is beyond\r\nthe scope of this discussion and readers interested are referred to the\r\nwork of Manson and of Fulleborn.\r\n\r\nOne of the most surprising features of the habits of these larvae is the\r\nperiodicity which they exhibit in their occurrence in the peripheral\r\nblood. If a preparation be made during the day time there may be no\r\nevidence whatever of filarial infestation, whereas a preparation from\r\nthe same patient taken late in the evening or during the night may be\r\nliterally swarming with the parasites. Manson quotes Mackenzie as having\r\nbrought out the further interesting fact that should a \"filarial subject\r\nbe made to sleep during the day and remain awake at night, the\r\nperiodicity is reversed; that is to say, the parasites come into the\r\nblood during the day and disappear from it during the night.\" There have\r\nbeen numerous attempts to explain this peculiar phenomenon of\r\nperiodicity but in spite of objections which have been raised, the most\r\nplausible remains that of Manson, who believes that it is an adaptation\r\ncorrelated with the life-habits of the liberating agent of the parasite,\r\nthe mosquito.\r\n\r\nThe next stages in the development of _Filaria nocturna_ occur in\r\nmosquitoes, a fact suggested almost simultaneously by Bancroft and\r\nManson in 1877, and first demonstrated by the latter very soon\r\nthereafter. The experiments were first carried out with _Culex\r\nquinquefasciatus_ (= _fatigans_) as a host, but it is now known that a\r\nnumber of species of mosquitoes, both anopheline and culicine, may serve\r\nequally well.\r\n\r\nWhen the blood of an infested individual is sucked up and reaches the\r\nstomach of such a mosquito, the larvae, by very active movements, escape\r\nfrom their sheaths and within a very few hours actively migrate to the\r\nbody cavity of their new host and settle down primarily in the thoracic\r\nmuscles. There in the course of sixteen to twenty days they undergo a\r\nmetamorphosis of which the more conspicuous features are the formation\r\nof a mouth, an alimentary canal and a trilobed tail. At the same time\r\nthere is an enormous increase in size, the larvae which measured .3 mm.\r\nin the blood becoming 1.5 mm. in length. This developmental period may\r\nbe somewhat shortened in some cases and on the other hand may be\r\nconsiderably extended. The controlling factor seems to be the one of\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nThe transformed larvae then reenter the body cavity and finally the\r\nmajority of them reach the interior of the labium (fig. 120). A few\r\nenter the legs and antennae, and the abdomen, but these are wanderers\r\nwhich, it is possible, may likewise ultimately reach the labium, where\r\nthey await the opportunity to enter their human host.\r\n\r\nIt was formerly supposed that when the infested mosquito punctured the\r\nskin of man, the mature larvae were injected into the circulation. The\r\nmanner in which this occurred was not obvious, for when the insect feeds\r\nit inserts only the stylets, the labium itself remaining on the surface\r\nof the skin. Fulleborn has cleared up the question by showing that at\r\nthis time the filariae escape and, like the hookworm, actively bore into\r\nthe skin of their new host.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 120. Filaria in the muscles and labium of Culex. After\r\nBlanchard.]\r\n\r\nOnce entered, they migrate to the lymphatics and there quickly become\r\nsexually mature. The full grown females measure 85-90 mm. in length by\r\n.24-.28 mm. in diameter, while the males are less than half this size,\r\nbeing about 40 mm. by .1 mm. Fecundation occurs and the females will be\r\nfound filled with eggs in various stages of development, for they are\r\nnormally viviparous.\r\n\r\n_Filaria philippinensis_ is reported by Ashburn and Craig (1907) as a\r\ncommon blood filaria in the Philippine Islands. As they describe it, it\r\ndiffers from _Filaria bancrofti_ primarily in that it does not exhibit\r\nperiodicity. Its development has been found to occur in _Culex\r\nquinquefasciatus_, where it undergoes metamorphosis in about fourteen or\r\nfifteen days. There is doubt as to the species being distinct from\r\n_bancrofti_.\r\n\r\nSeveral other species occur in man and are thought to be transferred by\r\nvarious insects, among which have been mentioned Tabanidae and\r\ntsetse-flies, but there is no experimental proof in support of such\r\nconjectures.\r\n\r\n_Filaria immitis_ is a dangerous parasite of the dog, the adult worm\r\nliving in the heart and veins of this animal. It is one of the species\r\nwhich has been clearly shown to undergo its development in the mosquito,\r\nparticularly in _Anopheles maculipennis_ and _Aedes calopus_ (=\r\nStegomyia). The larval form occurs in the peripheral blood, especially\r\nat night. When taken up by mosquitoes they differ from _Filaria\r\nbancrofti_ in that they undergo their development in the Malpighian\r\ntubules rather than in the thoracic muscles. In about twelve days they\r\nhave completed their growth in the tubules, pierce the distal end, and\r\npass to the labium. This species occurs primarily in China and Japan,\r\nbut is also found in Europe and in the United States. It is an\r\nespecially favorable species for studying the transformations in the\r\nmosquito.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 121. Dracunculus medinensis; female; mouth; embryo. After\r\nBastian and Leuckart.]\r\n\r\n_Filariae_ are also commonly found in birds, and in this country this is\r\nthe most available source of laboratory material. We have found them\r\nlocally (Ithaca, N. Y.) in the blood of over sixty per cent of all the\r\ncrows examined, at any season of the year, and have also found them in\r\nEnglish sparrows.\r\n\r\nIn the crows, they often occur in enormous numbers, as many as two\r\nthousand having been found in a single drop of the blood of the most\r\nheavily infested specimen examined. For study, a small drop of blood\r\nshould be mounted on a clean slide and the coverglass rung with vaseline\r\nor oil to prevent evaporation. In this way they can be kept for hours.\r\n\r\nPermanent preparations may be made by spreading out the blood in a film\r\non a perfectly clean slide and staining. This is easiest done by\r\ntouching the fresh drop of blood with the end of a second slide which is\r\nthen held at an angle of about 45^o to the first slide and drawn over it\r\nwithout pressure. Allow the smear to dry in the air and stain in the\r\nusual way with haematoxylin.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER NEMATODE PARASITES OF MAN AND ANIMALS DEVELOPING IN ARTHROPODS\r\n\r\n_Dracunculus medinensis_ (fig. 121), the so-called guinea-worm, is a\r\nnematode parasite of man which is widely distributed in tropical Africa,\r\nAsia, certain parts of Brazil and is occasionally imported into North\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThe female worm is excessively long and slender, measuring nearly three\r\nfeet in length and not more than one-fifteenth of an inch in diameter.\r\nIt is found in the subcutaneous connective tissue and when mature\r\nusually migrates to some part of the leg. Here it pierces the skin and\r\nthere is formed a small superficial ulcer through which the larvae reach\r\nthe exterior after bursting the body of the mother.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 122. Cyclops, the intermediate host of Dracunculus.]\r\n\r\nFedtschenko (1879) found that when these larvae reach the water they\r\npenetrate the carapace of the little crustacean, _Cyclops_ (fig. 122).\r\nHere they molt several times and undergo a metamorphosis. Fedtschenko,\r\nin Turkestan, found that these stages required about five weeks, while\r\nManson who confirmed these general results, found that eight or nine\r\nweeks were required in the cooler climate of England.\r\n\r\nInfection of the vertebrate host probably occurs through swallowing\r\ninfested cyclops in drinking water. Fedtschenko was unable to\r\ndemonstrate this experimentally and objection has been raised against\r\nthe theory, but Leiper (1907), and Strassen (1907) succeeded in\r\ninfesting monkeys by feeding them on cyclops containing the larvae.\r\n\r\n_Habronema muscae_ is a worm which has long been known in its larval\r\nstage, as a parasite of the house-fly. Carter found them in 33 per cent\r\nof the house-flies examined in Bombay during July, 1860, and since that\r\ntime they have been shown to be very widely distributed. Italian workers\r\nreported them in 12 per cent to 30 per cent of the flies examined.\r\nHewitt reported finding it rarely in England. In this country it was\r\nfirst reported by Leidy who found it in about 20 per cent of the flies\r\nexamined at Philadelphia, Pa. Since then it has been reported by several\r\nAmerican workers. We have found it at Ithaca, N. Y., but have not made\r\nsufficient examinations to justify stating percentage. Ransom (1913)\r\nreports it in thirty-nine out of one hundred and thirty-seven flies, or\r\n28 per cent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 123. An Echinorhynchid, showing the spinose retractile\r\nproboscis.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 124. June beetle (Lachnosterna).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Larva]\r\n\r\nUntil very recently the life-history of this parasite was unknown but\r\nthe thorough work of Ransom (1911, 1913) has shown clearly that the\r\nadult stage occurs in the stomach of horses. The embryos, produced by\r\nthe parent worms in the stomach of the horse, pass out with the feces\r\nand enter the bodies of fly larvae which are developing in the manure. In\r\nthese they reach their final stage of larval development at about the\r\ntime the adult flies emerge from the pupal stage. In the adult fly they\r\nare commonly found in the head, frequently in the proboscis, but they\r\noccur also in the thorax and abdomen. Infested flies are accidentally\r\nswallowed by horses and the parasite completes its development to\r\nmaturity in the stomach of its definitive host.\r\n\r\n_Gigantorhynchus hirudinaceus_ (= _Echinorhynchus gigas_) is a common\r\nparasite of the pig and has been reported as occurring in man. The adult\r\nfemale is 20-35 cm. long and 4-9 mm. in diameter. It lacks an alimentary\r\ncanal and is provided with a strongly spined protractile rostrum, by\r\nmeans of which it attaches to the intestinal mucosa of its host.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are scattered with the feces of the host and are taken up by\r\ncertain beetle larvae. In Europe the usual intermediate hosts are the\r\nlarvae of the cockchafer, _Melolontha vulgaris_, or of the flower beetle,\r\n_Cetonia aurata_. Stiles has shown that in the United States the\r\nintermediate host is the larva of the June bug, _Lachnosterna_ (fig.\r\n124). It is probable that several of the native species serve in this\r\ncapacity.\r\n\r\nA number of other nematode parasites of birds and mammals have been\r\nreported as developing in arthropods but here, as in the case of the\r\ncestodes, experimental proof is scant. The cases above cited are the\r\nbetter established and will serve as illustrations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nARTHROPODS AS ESSENTIAL HOSTS OF PATHOGENIC PROTOZOA\r\n\r\n\r\nMOSQUITOES AND MALARIA\r\n\r\nUnder the name of malaria is included a group of morbid symptoms\r\nformerly supposed to be due to a miasm or bad air, but now known to be\r\ncaused by protozoan parasites of the genus _Plasmodium_, which attack\r\nthe red blood corpuscles. It occurs in paroxysms, each marked by a\r\nchill, followed by high fever and sweating. The fever is either\r\nintermittent or remittent.\r\n\r\nThere are three principal types of the disease, due to different species\r\nof the parasite. They are:\r\n\r\n1. The benign-tertian, caused by _Plasmodium vivax_, which undergoes its\r\nschizogony or asexual cycle in the blood in forty-eight hours or even\r\nless. This type of the disease,--characterized by fever every two days,\r\nis the most wide-spread and common.\r\n\r\n2. The quartan fever is due to the presence of _Plasmodium malariae_,\r\nwhich has an asexual cycle of seventy-two hours, and therefore the fever\r\nrecurs every three days. This type is more prevalent in temperate and\r\nsub-tropical regions, but appears to be rare everywhere.\r\n\r\n3. The sub-tertian \"aestivo-autumnal,\" or \"pernicious\" fever is caused by\r\n_Plasmodium falciparum_. Schizogony usually occurs in the internal\r\norgans, particularly in the spleen, instead of in the peripheral\r\ncirculation, as is the case of the tertian and quartan forms. The fever\r\nproduced is of an irregular type and the period of schizogony has not\r\nbeen definitely determined. It is claimed by some that the variations\r\nare due to different species of malignant parasites.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the most wide-spread of human diseases, occurring in almost\r\nall parts of the world, except in the polar regions and in waterless\r\ndeserts. It is most prevalent in marshy regions.\r\n\r\nSo commonplace is malaria that it causes little of the dread inspired by\r\nmost of the epidemic diseases, and yet, as Ross says, it is perhaps the\r\nmost important of human diseases. Figures regarding its ravages are\r\nastounding. Celli estimated that in Italy it caused an average annual\r\nmortality of fifteen thousand, representing about two million cases. In\r\nIndia alone, according to Ross (1910) \"it has been officially estimated\r\nto cause a mean annual death-rate of five per thousand; that is, to kill\r\nevery year, on the average, one million one hundred and thirty\r\nthousand.\" In the United States it is widespread and though being\r\nrestricted as the country develops, it still causes enormous losses.\r\nDuring the year 1911, \"in Alabama alone there were seventy thousand\r\ncases and seven hundred and seventy deaths.\" The weakening effects of\r\nthe disease, the invasion of other diseases due to the attacks of\r\nmalaria, are among the very serious results, but they cannot be\r\nestimated.\r\n\r\nNot only is there direct effect on man, but the disease has been one of\r\nthe greatest factors in retarding the development of certain regions.\r\nEverywhere pioneers have had to face it, and the most fertile regions\r\nhave, in many instances been those most fully dominated by it. Herrick\r\n(1903) has presented an interesting study of its effects on the\r\ndevelopment of the southern United States and has shown that some parts,\r\nwhich are among the most fertile in the world, are rendered practically\r\nuninhabitable by the ravages of malaria. Howard (1909) estimates that\r\nthe annual money loss from the disease in the United States is not less\r\nthan $100,000,000.\r\n\r\nIt was formerly supposed that the disease was due to a miasm, to a\r\nnoxious effluvia, or infectious matter rising in the air from swamps. In\r\nother words its cause was, as the name indicated \"mal aria,\" and the\r\ndeep seated fear of night air is based largely on the belief that this\r\nmiasm was given off at night. Its production was thought to be favored\r\nby stirring of the soil, dredging operations and the like.\r\n\r\nThe idea of some intimate connection between malaria and mosquitoes is\r\nnot a new one. According to Manson, Lancisi noted that in some parts of\r\nItaly the peasants for centuries have believed that malaria is produced\r\nby the bite of mosquitoes. Celli states that one not rarely hears from\r\nsuch peasants the statement that \"In such a place, there is much fever,\r\nbecause it is full of mosquitoes.\" Koch points out that in German East\r\nAfrica the natives call malaria and the mosquito by the same name,\r\n_Mbu_. The opinion was not lacking support from medical men. Celli\r\nquotes passages from the writings of the Italian physician, Lancisi,\r\nwhich indicate that he favored the view in 1717.\r\n\r\nDr. Josiah Nott is almost universally credited with having supported the\r\ntheory, in 1848, but as we have already pointed out his work has been\r\nmisinterpreted. The statements of Beauperthuy, (1853) were more\r\nexplicit.\r\n\r\nThe clearest early presentation of the circumstantial evidence in favor\r\nof the theory of mosquito transmission was that of A. F. A. King, an\r\nAmerican physician, in 1883. He presented a series of epidemiological\r\ndata and showed \"how they may be explicable by the supposition that the\r\nmosquito is the real source of the disease, rather than the inhalation\r\nor cutaneous absorption of a marsh vapor.\" We may well give the space to\r\nsummarizing his argument here for it has been so remarkably\r\nsubstantiated by subsequent work:\r\n\r\n1. Malaria, like mosquitoes, affects by preference low and moist\r\nlocalities, such as swamps, fens, jungles, marshes, etc.\r\n\r\n2. Malaria is hardly ever developed at a lower temperature than 60^o\r\nFahr., and such a temperature is necessary for the development of the\r\nmosquito.\r\n\r\n3. Mosquitoes, like malaria, may both accumulate in and be obstructed by\r\nforests lying in the course of winds blowing from malarious localities.\r\n\r\n4. By atmospheric currents malaria and mosquitoes are alike capable of\r\nbeing transported for considerable distances.\r\n\r\n5. Malaria may be developed in previously healthy places by turning up\r\nthe soil, as in making excavations for the foundation of houses, tracks\r\nfor railroads, and beds for canals, because these operations afford\r\nbreeding places for mosquitoes.\r\n\r\n6. In proportion as countries, previously malarious, are cleared up and\r\nthickly settled, periodical fevers disappear, because swamps and pools\r\nare drained so that the mosquito cannot readily find a place suitable to\r\ndeposit her eggs.\r\n\r\n7. Malaria is most dangerous when the sun is down and the danger of\r\nexposure after sunset is greatly increased by the person exposed\r\nsleeping in the night air. Both facts are readily explicable by the\r\nmosquito malaria theory.\r\n\r\n8. In malarial districts the use of fire, both indoors and to those who\r\nsleep out, affords a comparative security against malaria, because of\r\nthe destruction of mosquitoes.\r\n\r\n9. It is claimed that the air of cities in some way renders the poison\r\ninnocuous, for, though a malarial disease may be raging outside, it does\r\nnot penetrate far into the interior. We may easily conceive that\r\nmosquitoes, while invading cities during their nocturnal pilgrimages\r\nwill be so far arrested by walls and houses, as well as attracted by\r\nlights in the suburbs, that many of them will in this way be prevented\r\nfrom penetrating \"far into the interior.\"\r\n\r\n10. Malarial diseases and likewise mosquitoes are most prevalent toward\r\nthe latter part of summer and in the autumn.\r\n\r\n11. Various writers have maintained that malaria is arrested by canvas\r\ncurtains, gauze veils and mosquito nets and have recommended the rise of\r\nmosquito curtains, \"through which malaria can seldom or never pass.\" It\r\ncan hardly be conceived that these intercept marsh-air but they\r\ncertainly do protect from mosquitoes.\r\n\r\n12. Malaria spares no age, but it affects infants much less frequently\r\nthan adults, because young infants are usually carefully housed and\r\nprotected from mosquito inoculation.\r\n\r\nCorrelated with the miasmatic theory was the belief that some animal or\r\nvegetable organism which lived in marshes, produced malaria, and\r\nfrequent searches were made for it. Salisbury (1862) thought this\r\ncausative organism to be an alga, of the genus _Palmella_; others\r\nattributed it to certain fungi or bacteria.\r\n\r\nIn 1880, the French physician, Laveran, working in Algeria, discovered\r\nan amoeboid organism in the blood of malarial patients and definitely\r\nestablished the parasitic nature of this disease. Pigmented granules had\r\nbeen noted by Meckel as long ago as 1847, in the spleen and blood of a\r\npatient who had died of malaria, and his observations had been\r\nrepeatedly verified, but the granules had been regarded as degeneration\r\nproducts, and the fact that they occurred in the body of a foreign\r\norganism had been overlooked.\r\n\r\nSoon after the discovery of the parasites in the blood, Gerhardt (1884)\r\nsucceeded in transferring the disease to healthy individuals by\r\ninoculation of malarious blood, and thus proved that it is a true\r\ninfection. This was verified by numerous experimenters and it was found\r\nthat inoculation with a very minute quantity of the diseased blood would\r\nnot only produce malaria but the particular type of disease.\r\n\r\nLaveran traced out the life cycle of the malarial parasite as it occurs\r\nin man. The details as we now know them and as they are illustrated by\r\nthe accompanying figure 125, are as follows:\r\n\r\nThe infecting organism or _sporozoite_, is introduced into the\r\ncirculation, penetrates a red blood corpuscle, and forms the amoeboid\r\n_schizont_. This lives at the expense of the corpuscle and as it\r\ndevelops there are deposited in its body scattered black or reddish\r\nblack particles. These are generally called melanin granules, but are\r\nmuch better referred to as haemozoin, as they are not related to\r\nmelanin. The haemozoin is the most conspicuous part of the parasite, a\r\nfeature of advantage in diagnosing from unstained preparations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 125. Life cycle of the malaria parasite. Adapted from\r\nLeuckart's chart, by Miss Anna Stryke.]\r\n\r\nAs the schizont matures, its nucleus breaks up into a number of daughter\r\nnuclei, each with a rounded mass of protoplasm about it, and finally the\r\ncorpuscles are broken down and these rounded bodies are liberated in the\r\nplasma as _merozoites_. These merozoites infect new corpuscles and thus\r\nthe asexual cycle is continued. The malarial paroxysm is coincident with\r\nsporulation.\r\n\r\nAs early as Laveran's time it was known that under conditions not yet\r\ndetermined there are to be found in the blood of malarious patients\r\nanother phase of the parasite, differing in form according to the type\r\nof the disease. In the pernicious type these appear as large,\r\ncrescent-shaped organisms which have commonly been called \"crescents.\"\r\nWe now know that these are sexual forms.\r\n\r\nWhen the parasite became known there immediately arose speculations as\r\nto the way in which it was transferred from man to man. It was thought\r\nby some that in nature it occurred as a free-living amoeba, and that\r\nit gained access to man through being taken up with impure water.\r\nHowever, numerous attempts to infect healthy persons by having them\r\ndrink or inhale marsh water, or by injecting it into their circulation\r\nresulted in failure, and influenced by Leuckart's and Melnikoff's work\r\non _Dipylidium_, that of Fedtschenko on _Dracunculus_, and more\r\nespecially by that of Manson on _Filaria_, search was made for some\r\ninsect which might transfer the parasite.\r\n\r\nLaveran had early suggested that the role of carrier might be played by\r\nthe mosquito, but Manson first clearly formulated the hypothesis, and it\r\nwas largely due to his suggestions that Ross in India, undertook to\r\nsolve the problem. With no knowledge of the form or of the appearance in\r\nthis stage, or of the species of mosquito concerned, Ross spent almost\r\ntwo and a half years of the most arduous work in the search and finally\r\nin August, 1897, seventeen years after the discovery of the parasite in\r\nman, he obtained his first definite clue. In dissecting a\r\n\"dappled-winged mosquito,\" \"every cell was searched and to my intense\r\ndisappointment nothing whatever was found, until I came to the insect's\r\nstomach. Here, however, just as I was about to abandon the examination,\r\nI saw a very delicate circular cell, apparently lying amongst the\r\nordinary cells of the organ and scarcely distinguishable from them. On\r\nlooking further, another and another similar object presented itself. I\r\nnow focused the lens carefully on one of these, and found that it\r\ncontained a few minute granules of some black substance, exactly like\r\nthe pigment of the parasite of malaria. I counted altogether twelve of\r\nthese cells in the insect.\"\r\n\r\nFurther search showed that \"the contents of the mature pigment cells did\r\nnot consist of clear fluid but of a multitude of delicate, thread-like\r\nbodies which on the rupture of the parent cell, were poured into the\r\nbody cavity of the insect. They were evidently spores.\"\r\n\r\nWith these facts established, confirmation and extension of Ross's\r\nresults quickly followed, from many different sources. We cannot trace\r\nthis work in detail but will only point out that much of the credit is\r\ndue to the Italian workers, Grassi, Bignami, and Bastianelli, and to\r\nKoch and Daniels.\r\n\r\nIt had already been found that when fresh blood was mounted and properly\r\nprotected against evaporation, a peculiar change occurred in these\r\ncrescents after about half an hour's time. From certain of them there\r\nwere pushed out long whip-like processes which moved with a very active,\r\nlashing movement. The parasite at this stage is known as the\r\n\"flagellated body.\" Others, differing somewhat in details of structure,\r\nbecome rounded but do not give off \"flagella.\"\r\n\r\nThe American worker, MacCallum (1897), in studying bird malaria as found\r\nin crows, first recognized the true nature of these bodies. He regarded\r\nthem as sexual forms and believed that the so-called flagella played the\r\npart of spermatozoa. Thus, the \"flagellated body\" is in reality a\r\n_microgametoblast_, producing _microgametes_, or the male sexual\r\nelement, while the others constitute the _macrogametes_, or female\r\nelements.\r\n\r\nIt was found that when blood containing these sexual forms was sucked up\r\nby an Anopheline mosquito and taken into its stomach, a microgamete\r\npenetrated and fertilized a macrogamete in a way analogous to what takes\r\nplace in the fertilization of the egg in higher forms. The resultant,\r\nmobile organism is known as the _migratory ookinete_. In this stage the\r\nparasite bores through the epithelial lining of the \"stomach\"\r\n(mid-intestine) of the mosquito and becomes encysted under the muscle\r\nlayers. Here the _oocyst_, as it is now known, matures and breaks up\r\ninto the body cavity and finally its products come to lie in the\r\nsalivary glands of the mosquito. Ten to twelve days are required for\r\nthese changes, after which the mosquito is infective, capable of\r\nintroducing the parasite with its saliva, when feeding upon a healthy\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nThus the malarial parasite is known to have a double cycle, an\r\nalternation of generations, of which the asexual stage is undergone in\r\nman, the sexual in certain species of mosquitoes. The mosquito is\r\ntherefore the definitive host rather than the _intermediate_, as usually\r\nstated.\r\n\r\nThe complicated cycle may be made clearer by the diagram of Miss Stryke\r\n(1912) which, by means of a double-headed mosquito (fig. 126) endeavors\r\nto show how infection takes place through the biting of the human\r\nvictim, (at A), in whom asexual multiplication then takes place, and how\r\nthe sexual stages, taken up at B in the diagram, are passed in the body\r\nof the mosquito.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 126. Life cycle of the malarial parasite. After Miss Anna\r\nStryke.]\r\n\r\nThe experimental proof that mosquitoes of the Anopheline group are\r\nnecessary agents in the transmission of malaria was afforded in 1900\r\nwhen two English physicians, Drs. Sambon and Low lived for the three\r\nmost malarial months in the midst of the Roman Campagna, a region\r\nfamous for centuries as a hot-bed of malaria. The two experimenters\r\nmoved about freely throughout the day, exposed themselves to rains and\r\nall kinds of weather, drank marsh water, slept exposed to the marsh air,\r\nand, in short, did everything which was supposed to cause malaria,\r\nexcept that they protected themselves thoroughly from mosquito bites,\r\nretiring at sunset to a mosquito-proof hut. Though they took no quinine\r\nand all of their neighbors suffered from malaria, they were absolutely\r\nfree from the disease.\r\n\r\nTo complete the proof, mosquitoes which had fed in Rome on malarious\r\npatients were sent to England and allowed to bite two volunteers, one of\r\nthem Dr. Manson's own son, who had not been otherwise exposed to the\r\ndisease. Both of these gentlemen contracted typical cases of malaria and\r\nthe parasites were to be found in abundance in their blood.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 127. Eggs of Anopheles. After Howard.]\r\n\r\nSince that time there have been many practical demonstrations of the\r\nfact that malaria is transmitted exclusively by the bite of mosquitoes\r\nand that the destruction of the mosquitoes means the elimination of the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nWe have said that the malarial parasite is able to undergo its\r\ndevelopment only in certain species of mosquitoes belonging to the\r\nAnopheline group. It is by no means certain that all of this group even,\r\nare capable of acting as the definitive host of the parasites, and much\r\ncareful experiment work is still needed along this line. In the United\r\nStates, several species have been found to be implicated, _Anopheles\r\nquadrimaculatus_ and _Anopheles crucians_ being the most common. The\r\ncharacteristics of these species and the distinctions between them and\r\nother mosquitoes will be discussed in Chapter XII.\r\n\r\nIn antimalarial work it is desirable to distinguish the anopheline\r\nmosquitoes from the culicine species in all stages. The following\r\ntabulation presents the more striking distinctions between the groups as\r\nrepresented in the United States.\r\n\r\n_Anopheles_                             _Culex, Aedes, etc_.\r\n\r\n_Eggs_: Laid singly in small            Deposited in clumps in the\r\nnumbers upon the surface of the         form of a raft (Culex group) or\r\nwater. Eggs lie upon their sides        deposited singly in the water or\r\nand float by means of lateral           on the ground in places which\r\nexpansions (fig. 127).                  may later be submerged.\r\n\r\n_Larva_: When at rest floats in         When at rest (with few exceptions)\r\na horizontal position beneath the       floats suspended in an\r\nsurface film. No respiratory            oblique or vertical position, or\r\ntube but instead a flattened            more rarely nearly horizontal,\r\narea on the eighth abdominal            with the respiratory tube in\r\nsegment into which the two              contact with the surface film\r\nspiracles open (fig. 128).              (fig. 128).\r\n\r\n_Adults_: Palpi in both sexes           Palpi short in the female, in\r\nnearly or quite as long as the          the male usually elongate.\r\nproboscis. Proboscis projecting         Proboscis projects forward at an\r\nforward nearly on line with the         angle with the axis of the body.\r\naxis of the body. When at rest          When at rest on a vertical wall\r\non a vertical wall the body is          the body is usually held parallel\r\nusually held at an angle with the       or the tip of the abdomen inclined\r\nvertical (fig. 128). Wings frequently   towards the wall (fig. 128).\r\nspotted (fig. 130).                     Wings usually not spotted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 128. (_a_) Normal position of the larvae of Culex and\r\nAnopheles in the water. Culex, left; Anopheles, middle; Culex pupa,\r\nright hand figure.]\r\n\r\nThese malarial-bearing species are essentially domesticated mosquitoes.\r\nThey develop in any accumulation of water which stands for a week or\r\nmore. Ponds, puddles, rain barrels, horse troughs, cess-pools, cans,\r\neven the foot-prints of animals in marshy ground may afford them\r\nbreeding places.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 128. (_b_) Normal position of Culex and Anopheles on the\r\nwall.]\r\n\r\nIt is clear from what has been said regarding the life cycle of the\r\nmalarial parasite that the mosquito is harmless if not itself diseased.\r\nHence malarial-bearing species may abound in the neighborhood where\r\nthere is no malaria, the disease being absent simply because the\r\nmosquitoes are uninfected. Such a locality is potentially malarious and\r\nneeds only the introduction of a malarial patient who is exposed to the\r\nmosquitoes. It is found that such patients may harbor the parasites in\r\ntheir blood long after they are apparently well and thus may serve as a\r\nmenace, just as do the so-called typhoid carriers. In some malarious\r\nregions as high as 80-90 per cent of the natives are such\r\nmalaria-carriers and must be reckoned with in antimalaria measures.\r\n\r\nBased upon our present day knowledge of the life cycle of the malarial\r\nparasite the fight against the disease becomes primarily a problem in\r\neconomic entomology,--it is a question of insect control, in its\r\nbroadest interpretation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 129. Larva of Anopheles. After Howard.]\r\n\r\nThe lines of defence and offence against the disease as outlined by\r\nBoyce (1909) are:\r\n\r\n  1. Measures to avoid the reservoir (man):\r\n\r\n    Segregation.\r\n\r\n    Screening of patients.\r\n\r\n  2. Measures to avoid Anopheles:\r\n\r\n    Choice of suitable locality, when possible.\r\n\r\n    Screening of houses and porches.\r\n\r\n    Sleeping under mosquito nets.\r\n\r\n  3. Measures to exterminate the Anopheles:\r\n\r\n    Use of natural enemies.\r\n\r\n    Use of culicides, oiling ponds, etc.\r\n\r\n    Drainage and scavenging to destroy breeding places.\r\n\r\n    Enforcement of penalties for harboring larvae or keeping stagnant\r\n      water.\r\n\r\n    Educational methods.\r\n\r\n  4. Systematic treatment with quinine to exterminate the parasites.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOSQUITOES AND YELLOW FEVER\r\n\r\nYellow fever was until recently one of the most dreaded of epidemic\r\ndiseases. It is an acute, specific and infectious disease,\r\nnon-contagious in character but occurring in epidemics, or endemics,\r\nwithin a peculiarly limited geographical area. It is highly fatal, but\r\nthose who recover are generally immune from subsequent attacks.\r\n\r\nIt is generally regarded as an American disease, having been found by\r\nCortez, in Mexico, and being confined principally to the American\r\ncontinents and islands. It also occurs in Africa and attempts have been\r\nmade to show that it was originally an African disease but there is not\r\nsufficient evidence to establish this view.\r\n\r\nThere have been many noted outbreaks in the United States. Boston\r\nsuffered from it in 1691 and again in 1693; New York in 1668 and as late\r\nas 1856; Baltimore in 1819. In 1793 occurred the great epidemic in\r\nPhiladelphia, with a death rate of one in ten of the population. In the\r\npast century it was present almost every year in some locality of our\r\nSouthern States, New Orleans being the greatest sufferer. In the latter\r\ncity there were 7848 deaths from the disease in 1853, 4854 in 1858, and\r\n4046 in 1878. The last notable outbreak was in 1905. Reed and Carroll\r\n(1901) estimated that during the period from 1793 to 1900 there had not\r\nbeen less than 500,000 cases in the United States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 130. Anopheles quadrimaculatus, male and female,\r\n(x3-1/2). After Howard.]\r\n\r\nAs in the case of the plague, the most stringent methods of control\r\nproved ineffective and helplessness, almost hopelessness marked the\r\ngreat epidemics. A vivid picture of conditions is that given by Mathew\r\nCary, 1793 (quoted by Kelly, 1906) in \"A Short Account of the Malignant\r\nFever Lately Prevalent in Philadelphia.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 131. Anopheles punctipennis. Female, (x4). After Howard.]\r\n\r\n\"The consternation of the people of Philadelphia at this period was\r\ncarried beyond all bounds. Dismay and affright were visible in the\r\ncountenance of almost every person. Of those who remained, many shut\r\nthemselves in their houses and were afraid to walk the streets. * * *\r\nThe corpses of the most respectable citizens, even those who did not die\r\nof the epidemic, were carried to the grave on the shafts of a chair\r\n(chaise), the horse driven by a negro, unattended by friends or\r\nrelative, and without any sort of ceremony. People hastily shifted their\r\ncourse at the sight of a hearse coming toward them. Many never walked on\r\nthe footpath, but went into the middle of the streets to avoid being\r\ninfected by passing by houses wherein people had died. Acquaintances and\r\nfriends avoided each other in the streets and only signified their\r\nregard by a cold nod. The old custom of shaking hands fell into such\r\ndisuse that many shrunk back with affright at even the offer of the\r\nhand. A person with a crape, or any appearance of mourning was shunned\r\nlike a viper. And many valued themselves highly on the skill and address\r\nwith which they got to the windward of every person they met. Indeed, it\r\nis not probable that London, at the last stage of the plague, exhibited\r\nstronger marks of terror than were to be seen in Philadelphia from the\r\n24th or 25th of August until pretty late in September.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 132. Anopheles crucians. Female (x4). After Howard.]\r\n\r\nSuch was the condition in Philadelphia in 1793 and, as far as methods of\r\ncontrol of the disease were concerned, there was practically no advance\r\nduring the last century. The dominant theory was that yellow fever was\r\nspread by _fomites_, that is, exposed bedding, clothing, baggage, and\r\nthe like. As late as 1898 a bulletin of the United States Marine\r\nHospital Service stated:\r\n\r\n\"While yellow fever is a communicable disease, it is not contagious in\r\nthe ordinary acceptance of the term, but is spread by the infection of\r\nplaces and articles of bedding, clothing, and furniture.\"\r\n\r\nBased upon this theory, houses, baggage, freight, even mail, were\r\ndisinfected, and the most rigid quarantine regulations were enforced.\r\nThe hardships to which people of the stricken regions were subjected and\r\nthe financial losses are incalculable. And withal, the only efficient\r\ncheck upon the disease seemed to be the heavy frosts. It was found that\r\nfor some reason, the epidemic abated with cold weather,--a measure\r\nbeyond human control.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 133. Culex sollicitans. Female (x4). After Howard.]\r\n\r\nIt is not strange that among the multitude of theories advanced to\r\nexplain the cause and method of dissemination of the disease there\r\nshould be suggestions that yellow fever was transmitted by the mosquito.\r\nWe have seen that Beauperthuy (1855) clearly urged this theory.\r\n\r\nMore detailed, and of the greatest influence in the final solution of\r\nthe problem were the arguments of Dr. Carlos Finlay, of Havana. In 1881,\r\nin a paper presented before the \"Real Academia de Ciencias Medicas,\r\nFisicas y Naturales de la Habana,\" he said:\r\n\r\n\"I feel convinced that any theory which attributes the origin and the\r\npropagation of yellow fever to atmospheric influences, to miasmatic or\r\nmeteorological conditions, to filth, or to the neglect of general\r\nhygienic precautions, must be considered as utterly indefensible.\"\r\n\r\nHe postulated the existence of a material transportable substance\r\ncausing yellow fever,--\"something tangible which requires to be conveyed\r\nfrom the sick to the healthy before the disease can be propagated\" and\r\nafter discussing the peculiarities of the spread of the disease and the\r\ninfluence of meteorological conditions, he decides that the carriers of\r\nthe disease must be sought among insects. He continues:\r\n\r\n\"On the other hand, the fact of yellow fever being characterized both\r\nclinically and (according to recent findings) histologically, by lesions\r\nof the blood vessels and by alterations of the physical and chemical\r\nconditions of the blood, suggested that the insect which should convey\r\nthe infectious particles from the patient to the healthy should be\r\nlooked for among those which drive their sting into blood vessels in\r\norder to suck human blood. Finally, by reason of other considerations\r\nwhich need not be stated here, I came to think that the mosquito might\r\nbe the transmitter of yellow fever.\"\r\n\r\n\"Assimilating the disease to small-pox and to vaccination, it occurred\r\nto me that in order to inoculate yellow fever it would be necessary to\r\npick out the inoculable material from within the blood vessels of a\r\nyellow fever patient and to carry it likewise into the interior of a\r\nblood vessel of a person who was to be inoculated. All of which\r\nconditions the mosquito satisfies most admirably through its bite.\"\r\n\r\nIn the course of his study of the problem, Finlay made detailed studies\r\nof the life history and habits of the common mosquitoes at Havana, and\r\narrived at the conclusion that the carrier of the yellow fever was the\r\n_Culex mosquito_ or _Aedes calopus_, as it is now known. With this\r\nspecies he undertook direct experimental tests, and believed that he\r\nsucceeded in transmitting the disease by the bite of infected mosquitoes\r\nin three cases. Unfortunately, possibility of other exposure was not\r\nabsolutely excluded, and the experiments attracted little attention.\r\n\r\nThroughout the next twenty years Finlay continued his work on yellow\r\nfever, modifying his original theory somewhat as time went on. Among his\r\nlater suggestions was that in the light of Smith's work on Texas fever,\r\nhis theory must be \"somewhat modified so as to include the important\r\ncircumstance that the faculty of transmitting the yellow fever germ need\r\nnot be limited to the parent insect, directly contaminated by stinging a\r\nyellow fever patient (or perhaps by contact with or feeding from his\r\ndischarges), but may be likewise inherited by the next generation of\r\nmosquitoes issued from the contaminated parent.\" He believed that the\r\nbite of a single mosquito produced a light attack of the disease and was\r\nthus effective in immunizing the patient. Throughout the period, many\r\napparently successful attempts to transmit the disease by mosquitoes\r\nwere made. In the light of present day knowledge we must regard these as\r\ndefective not only because possibility of other infection was not\r\nabsolutely excluded but because no account was taken of the incubation\r\nperiod within the body of the mosquito.\r\n\r\nIn 1900, while the American army was stationed in Cuba there occurred an\r\nepidemic of yellow fever and an army medical board was appointed for\r\n\"the purpose of pursuing scientific investigations with reference to the\r\nacute infectious diseases prevalent on the island.\" This was headed by\r\nWalter Reed and associated with him were James Carroll, Jesse W. Lazear\r\nand Aristides Agramonte, the latter a Cuban immune. For a detailed\r\nsummary of this work the lay reader cannot do better than read Dr.\r\nKelly's fascinating biography \"Walter Reed and Yellow Fever.\"\r\n\r\nArriving at the army barracks near Havana the Commission first took up\r\nthe study of _Bacillus icteroides_, the organism which Sanarelli, an\r\nItalian physician, had declared the causative agent in yellow fever.\r\nThey were unable to isolate this bacillus either from the blood during\r\nlife or from the blood and organs of cadavers and therefore turned their\r\nattention to Finlay's theory of the propagation of yellow fever by means\r\nof the mosquito. In this work they had the unselfish and enthusiastic\r\nsupport of Dr. Finlay himself, who not only consulted with them and\r\nplaced his publications at their disposal, but furnished eggs from which\r\ntheir experimental mosquitoes were obtained. Inoculations of eleven\r\nnon-immunes through the bite of infected mosquitoes were made, and of\r\nthese, two gave positive results. The first of the two was Dr. Carroll\r\nwho allowed himself to be bitten by a mosquito which had been caused to\r\nfeed upon four cases of yellow fever, two of them severe and two mild.\r\nThe first patient had been bitten twelve days before.\r\n\r\nThree days after being bitten, Dr. Carroll came down with a typical case\r\nof yellow fever. So severe was the attack that for three days his life\r\nhung in the balance. During his convalescence an incident occurred which\r\nshowed how the theory of mosquito transmission of the disease was\r\ngenerally regarded. We quote from Dr. Kelly: \"One of his nurses who came\r\nfrom Tennessee had had considerable experience with yellow fever, having\r\nindeed, lost her husband and several children from it. One day early in\r\nhis illness Dr. Carroll mentioned to her that he had contracted the\r\ndisease through the bite of a mosquito, and noticed that she looked\r\nsurprised. Some time later, when well enough to look over the daily\r\nrecords of his condition, he found this entry: 'Says he got his illness\r\nthrough the bite of a mosquito,--delirious'.\"\r\n\r\nThe second case was that of an American who was bitten by four\r\nmosquitoes, two of which had bitten severe (fatal) cases of yellow fever\r\ntwelve days previously, one of which had bitten a severe case (second\r\nday) sixteen days before and one which had bitten a severe case eight\r\ndays before. Five days later, the subject developed a well pronounced\r\nbut mild case of the disease.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, another member of the Commission, Dr. Lazear, was\r\naccidentally bitten by a mosquito while collecting blood from yellow\r\nfever patients. Five days later he contracted a typical case which\r\nresulted fatally.\r\n\r\nSo clear was the evidence from these preliminary experiments that the\r\ncommission felt warranted in announcing, October 27, 1900, that, \"The\r\nmosquito serves as the intermediate host for the parasite of yellow\r\nfever, and it is highly probable that the disease is only propagated\r\nthrough the bite of this insect.\"\r\n\r\nIn order to extend the experimental evidence under conditions which\r\ncould leave no possibility of infection from other sources, a special\r\nexperimental sanitary station, named in honor of the deceased member of\r\nthe Commission, was established in an open field near the town of\r\nQuemados, Cuba. Here there were constructed two small buildings known\r\nrespectively as the \"infected clothing building\" and the \"infected\r\nmosquito building.\"\r\n\r\nThe infected clothing building, 14 x 20 feet in size, was purposely so\r\nconstructed as to exclude anything like efficient ventilation, but was\r\nthoroughly screened to prevent the entrance of mosquitoes. Into this\r\nbuilding were brought sheets, pillow-slips, blankets, etc., contaminated\r\nby contact with cases of yellow fever and their discharges,--many of\r\nthem purposely soiled with a liberal quantity of black vomit, urine, and\r\nfecal matter from patients sick with yellow fever. Nothing could better\r\nserve as the fomites which were supposed to convey the dread disease.\r\n\r\nThree non-immunes unpacked these articles, giving each a thorough\r\nhandling and shaking in order to disseminate through the air of the room\r\nthe specific agent of the disease. They were then used in making up the\r\nbeds which the volunteers occupied each night for a period of twenty\r\ndays. The experiment was repeated three times, volunteers even sleeping\r\nin the soiled garments of yellow fever victims but in not a single case\r\nwas there the slightest symptom of disease. The theory of the spread of\r\nyellow fever by fomites was completely demolished.\r\n\r\nThe infected mosquito building, equal in size to its companion, was the\r\nantithesis as far as other features were concerned. It was so\r\nconstructed as to give the best possible ventilation, and bedding which\r\nwas brought into it was thoroughly sterilized. Like the infected\r\nclothing building it was carefully screened, but in this case it was in\r\norder to keep mosquitoes in it as well as to prevent entrance of others.\r\nThrough the middle of the room ran a mosquito-proof screen.\r\n\r\nOn December 5, 1900, a non-immune volunteer who had been in the\r\nquarantine camp for fifteen days and had had no other possible exposure,\r\nallowed himself to be bitten by five mosquitoes which had fed on yellow\r\nfever patients fifteen or more days previously. The results were fully\r\nconfirmatory of the earlier experiments of the Commission--at the end of\r\nthree days, nine and a half hours, the subject came down with a well\r\nmarked case of yellow fever.\r\n\r\nIn all, ten cases of experimental yellow fever, caused by the bite of\r\ninfected mosquitoes were developed in Camp Lazear. Throughout the period\r\nof the disease, other non-immunes slept in the little building,\r\nseparated from the patient only by the mosquito-proof screen, but in no\r\ncircumstances did they suffer any ill effects.\r\n\r\nIt was found that a yellow fever patient was capable of infecting\r\nmosquitoes only during the first three or four days after coming down\r\nwith the disease. Moreover, after the mosquito has bitten such a\r\npatient, a period of at least twelve days must elapse before the insect\r\nis capable of transmitting the disease.\r\n\r\nOnce the organism has undergone its twelve day development, the mosquito\r\nmay remain infective for weeks. In experiments of the Commission, two of\r\nthe mosquitoes transmitted the disease to a volunteer fifty-seven days\r\nafter their contamination. No other volunteers presenting themselves,\r\none of these mosquitoes died the sixty-ninth and one the seventy-first\r\nday after their original contamination, without it being determined\r\nwhether they were still capable of transmitting the disease.\r\n\r\nSo carefully carried out was this work and so conclusive were the\r\nresults that Dr. Reed was justified in writing:\r\n\r\n\"Six months ago, when we landed on this island, absolutely nothing was\r\nknown concerning the propagation and spread of yellow fever--it was all\r\nan unfathomable mystery--but today the curtain has been drawn--its mode\r\nof propagation is established and we know that a case minus mosquitoes\r\nis no more dangerous than one of chills and fever.\"\r\n\r\nThe conclusions of the Commission were fully substantiated by numerous\r\nworkers, notably Dr. Guiteras of the Havana Board of Health, who had\r\ntaken a lively interest in the work and whose results were made known in\r\n1901, and by the Brazilian and French Commission at Sao Paulo, Brazil,\r\nin 1903.\r\n\r\nThroughout the work of the Army Commission and down to the present time\r\nmany fruitless efforts have been made to discover the specific organism\r\nof yellow fever. It was clearly established that the claims of Sanarelli\r\nfor _Bacillus icteroides_ were without foundation. It was found, too,\r\nthat whatever the infective agent might be it was capable of passing\r\nthrough a Berkefeld filter and thus belongs to the puzzling group of\r\n\"filterable viruses.\" It was further found that the virus was destroyed\r\nby heating up to 55^o C for ten minutes. It is generally believed that\r\nthe organism is a Protozoan.\r\n\r\nThe question of the hereditary transmission of the yellow fever organism\r\nwithin the mosquito was left unsettled by the Army Commission, though,\r\nas we have seen, it was raised by Finlay. Marchoux and Simond, of the\r\nFrench Commission devoted much attention to this phase of the problem\r\nand basing their conclusions on one apparently positive case, they\r\ndecided that the disease could be transmitted through the egg of an\r\ninfected _Aedes calopus_ to the second generation and thence to man. The\r\nconclusion, which is of very great importance in the control of yellow\r\nfever, has not been verified by other workers.\r\n\r\nOnce clearly established that yellow fever was transmitted solely by\r\nmosquitoes, the question of the characteristics, habits, and\r\ngeographical distribution of the insect carrier became of vital\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n_Aedes calopus_, more commonly known as _Stegomyia fasciata_ or\r\n_Stegomyia calopus_ (fig. 134) is a moderate sized, rather strikingly\r\nmarked mosquito. The general color is dark-brown or reddish-brown, but\r\nthe thorax has a conspicuous broad, silvery-white curved line on each\r\nside, with two parallel median silvery lines. Between the latter there\r\nis a slender, broken line. The whole gives a lyre-shaped pattern to the\r\nthorax. The abdomen is dark with silvery-white basal bands and silvery\r\nwhite spots on each side of the abdominal segments. Legs black with\r\nrings of pure white at the base of the segments.\r\n\r\nSize of the female 3.3 to 5 mm.; male 3 to 4.5 mm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 134. The yellow fever mosquito (Aedes calopus). (x7).\r\nAfter Howard.]\r\n\r\nIt is preeminently a domesticated species, being found almost\r\nexclusively about the habitation of man. \"Its long association with man\r\nis shown by many of its habits. It approaches stealthily from behind. It\r\nretreats upon the slightest alarm. The ankles and, when one is sitting\r\nat a table or desk, the underside of the hands and wrists are favorable\r\npoints of attack. It attacks silently, whereas other mosquitoes have a\r\npiping or humming note. The warning sound has doubtless been suppressed\r\nin the evolutionary process of its adaptation to man. It is extremely\r\nwary. It hides whenever it can, concealing itself in garments, working\r\ninto the pockets, and under the lapels of coats, and crawling up under\r\nthe clothes to bite the legs. In houses, it will hide in dark corners,\r\nunder picture moldings and behind the heads of old-fashioned bedsteads.\r\nIt will enter closets and hide in the folds of garments.\"--Howard.\r\n\r\nIt was claimed by the French Commission, and subsequently often stated\r\nin discussions of the relation of the mosquito to yellow fever that the\r\nmature _Aedes calopus_ will bite only at night. If this were true it\r\nwould be of the greatest importance in measures to avoid the disease.\r\nUnfortunately, the claim was illy founded and numerous workers have\r\nclearly established that the exact converse is more nearly true, this\r\nmosquito being pre-eminently a day species, feeding most actively in\r\nearly morning, about sunrise, and late in the afternoon. On cloudy days\r\nit attacks at any time during the day. Thus there is peril in the\r\ndoctrine that infected regions may be visited with perfect safety during\r\nthe daytime and that measures to avoid the mosquito attack need be taken\r\nonly at night.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 135_a_. Aedes calopus. Pupa. After Howard.]\r\n\r\nDr. Finlay maintained that the adult, even when starved, would not bite\r\nwhen the temperature was below 23^o C, but subsequent studies have shown\r\nthat this statement needs modification. The French Commission, working\r\nat Rio de Janeiro, found that _Aedes calopus_ would bite regularly at\r\ntemperatures between 22^o and 25^o and that the optimum temperature was\r\nbetween 27^o and 30^o C, but their experiments led them to believe that it\r\nwould bite in nature at a temperature as low as 17^o C.\r\n\r\nThe yellow fever mosquito breeds in cisterns, water barrels, pitchers\r\nand in the various water receptacles about the house. In our own\r\nSouthern States it very commonly breeds in the above-ground cisterns\r\nwhich are in general use. Often the larvae (fig. 135b) are found in\r\nflower vases, or even in the little cups of water which are placed under\r\nthe legs of tables to prevent their being overrun by ants. They have\r\nbeen repeatedly found breeding in the holy water font in churches. In\r\nshort, they breed in any collection of water in close proximity to the\r\ndwellings or gathering places of man.\r\n\r\nThe life cycle under favorable conditions is completed in from twelve to\r\nfifteen days. These figures are of course very dependent upon the\r\ntemperature. The Army Commission in Cuba found that the cycle might be\r\ncompleted in as brief a period as nine and a half days. Under less\r\nfavorable conditions it may be greatly lengthened.\r\n\r\nThe adults are long lived. We have seen that during the experimental\r\nwork in Cuba specimens were kept in captivity for sixty-nine and\r\nseventy-one days, respectively, and that they were proved to retain\r\ntheir infectivity for at least fifty-seven days. Dr. Guiteras\r\nsubsequently kept an infected adult for one hundred and fifty-four days.\r\n\r\nLow temperatures have a very great effect not only on development, but\r\non the activity and even life of the adults. Long before the method of\r\ntransmission of yellow fever was discovered it was well known that the\r\nepidemics were brought to a close by heavy frosts, and it is now known\r\nthat this is due to the killing of the mosquitoes which alone could\r\nspread the disease.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 135_b_. Aedes calopus; larva. (x7). After Howard.]\r\n\r\n_Aedes calopus_ has a very wide distribution since, as Howard says,\r\nbeing a domestic mosquito, having a fairly long life in the adult stage,\r\nand having the custom of hiding itself in the most ingenious ways, it is\r\nparticularly subject to carriage for long distances on board vessels, in\r\nrailway trains, even packed in baggage. In general, its permanent\r\ndistribution is from 40 degrees north latitude to 40 degrees south\r\nlatitude (Brumpt), in a belt extending around the world. In the United\r\nStates it breeds in most of our Southern States.\r\n\r\nThus, as in the case of malaria, there are many places where the insect\r\ncarrier is abundant but where yellow fever does not occur. Such, for\r\ninstance, are Hawaii, Australia and Asia. An outbreak may occur at any\r\ntime that a patient suffering from the disease is allowed to enter and\r\nbecome a source of infection for the mosquitoes. In this connection\r\nvarious writers have called attention to the menace from the Panama\r\nCanal. When it is completed, it will allow of direct passage from\r\nregions where yellow fever is endemic and this will greatly increase the\r\npossibility of its introduction into these places where it is now\r\nunknown. The result, with a wholly non-immune population, would be\r\nappalling.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there are places wholly outside of the normal range\r\nof _Aedes calopus_ where the disease has raged. Such are New York,\r\nBoston, and even Philadelphia, which have suffered notable epidemics.\r\nThese outbreaks have been due to the introduction of infected mosquitoes\r\nduring the heat of summer, when they have not only conveyed the disease\r\nbut have found conditions favorable for their multiplication. Or,\r\nuninfected mosquitoes have been thus accidentally brought in and\r\ndeveloped in large numbers, needing then only the accidental\r\nintroduction of cases of the disease to start an epidemic.\r\n\r\nMethods of control of various diseases have been revolutionized by the\r\ndiscovery that they were insect-borne, but in no other case has the\r\nchange been as radical or the results as spectacular as in the case of\r\nyellow fever. The \"shot-gun quarantine,\" the sufferings and horrors, the\r\nhopelessness of fighting absolutely blindly have given way to an\r\nefficient, clear-cut method of control, based upon the knowledge that\r\nthe disease is carried from man to man solely by the mosquito, _Aedes\r\ncalopus_. The lines of defense and offense are essentially as follows:\r\n\r\nIn the first place, when a case of yellow fever occurs, stringent\r\nprecautions must be adopted to prevent the infection of mosquitoes and\r\nthe escape of any already infected. This means that the patient must be\r\nremoved to a mosquito-proof room, or ward beyond reach of the insects,\r\nand that the infected room must be thoroughly fumigated at once, to kill\r\nthe mosquitoes hiding within it. All cracks and openings should be\r\nclosed with strips of paper and fumigation with burning sulphur or\r\npyrethrum carefully carried out.\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered that if the first case noted is that of a\r\nresident rather than imported, it means that the mosquito carriers\r\nbecame infected more than two weeks before the case was diagnosed, for\r\nas we have seen, the germ must undergo a twelve-day period of\r\ndevelopment within its insect host. Therefore a careful search must be\r\nmade for mild cases which, though unrecognized, may serve as foci for\r\nthe spread of the disease.\r\n\r\nIn face of a threatened epidemic one of the most essential measures is\r\nto educate the citizens and to gain their complete cooperation in the\r\nfight along modern lines. This may be done through the schools, the\r\npulpit, places of amusement, newspapers and even bulletin boards.\r\n\r\nEmphasis should be placed on the necessity of both non-immunes and\r\nimmunes using mosquito curtains, and in all possible ways avoiding\r\nexposure to the mosquitoes.\r\n\r\nThen the backbone of the fight must be the anti-mosquito measures. In\r\ngeneral, these involve screening and fumigating against adults, and\r\ncontrol of water supply, oiling, and drainage against the larvae. The\r\nregion involved must be districted and a thorough survey undertaken to\r\nlocate breeding places, which must, if possible, be eradicated. If they\r\nare necessary for water supplies, such as casks, or cisterns, they\r\nshould be carefully screened to prevent access of egg-laying adults.\r\n\r\nThe practical results of anti-mosquito measures in the fight against\r\nyellow fever are well illustrated by the classic examples of the work in\r\nHavana, immediately following the discoveries of the Army Commission and\r\nby the stamping out of the New Orleans epidemic in 1905.\r\n\r\nThe opportunities for an immediate practical application of the theories\r\nof the Army Commission in Havana were ideal. The city had always been a\r\nhotbed of yellow fever and was the principal source from which the\r\ndisease was introduced year after year into our Southern States. It was\r\nunder martial law and with a military governor who was himself a\r\nphysician and thoroughly in sympathy with the views of the Commission,\r\nthe rigid enforcement of the necessary regulations was possible. The\r\nstory of the first campaign has been often told, but nowhere more\r\nclearly than in Dr. Reed's own account, published in the _Journal of\r\nHygiene_ for 1902.\r\n\r\nCloser home was the demonstration of the efficacy of these measures in\r\ncontrolling the yellow fever outbreak in New Orleans in 1905. During the\r\nspring and early summer of the year the disease had, unperceived, gained\r\na firm foothold in that city and when, in early July the local Board of\r\nHealth took cognizance of its existence, it was estimated that there had\r\nbeen in the neighborhood of one hundred cases.\r\n\r\nConditions were not as favorable as they had been under martial law in\r\nHavana for carrying on a rigid fight along anti-mosquito lines. The\r\ndensely populated city was unprepared, the public had to be educated,\r\nand an efficient organization built up. The local authorities actively\r\nbegan a general fight against the mosquito but in spite of their best\r\nefforts the disease continued to spread. It was recognized that more\r\nrigid organization was needed and on August 12th the United States\r\nPublic Health and Marine Hospital Service was put in absolute charge of\r\nthe fight. Up to this time there had been one hundred and forty-two\r\ndeaths from a total of nine hundred and thirteen cases and all of the\r\nconditions seemed to threaten an outbreak to exceed the memorable one of\r\n1878 when, as we have seen there were four thousand and forty-six\r\ndeaths.\r\n\r\nWith the hearty cooperation of the citizens,--physicians and laymen\r\nalike,--the fight was waged and long before frost or any near approach\r\nthereto the disease was stamped out,--a thing unheard of in previous\r\nepidemics. The total loss of life was four hundred and sixty--about 11\r\nper cent as great as that from the comparable epidemic of 1878. If the\r\ndisease had been promptly recognized and combated with the energy which\r\nmarked the fight later in the summer, the outbreak would have made\r\nlittle headway and the great proportion of these lives would have been\r\nsaved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nARTHROPODS AS ESSENTIAL HOSTS OF PATHOGENIC PROTOZOA (Continued)\r\n\r\n\r\nINSECTS AND TRYPANOSOMIASES\r\n\r\nBy trypanosomiasis is meant a condition of animal parasitism, common to\r\nman and the lower animals, in which trypanosomes, peculiar flagellate\r\nprotozoa, infest the blood. Depending upon the species, they may be\r\nharmless, producing no appreciable ill-effect, or pathogenic, giving\r\nrise to conditions of disease. A number of these are known to be\r\ntransferred by insects.\r\n\r\nIn order that we may consider more fully the developmental stage of\r\nthese parasites within their insect host, it is necessary that we\r\ndescribe briefly the structure of the blood-inhabiting stage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 136. Trypanosoma brucei. After Bruce.]\r\n\r\nThe trypanosomes are elongated, usually pointed, flagellated protozoa\r\n(fig. 136) in which the single flagellum, bent under the body, forms the\r\nouter limit of a delicate undulating membrane. It arises near one end of\r\nthe organism from a minute centrosome-like body which is known as the\r\nblepheroplast, and at the opposite end extends for a greater or less\r\ndistance as a free flagellum. Enclosing, or close beside the\r\nblepheroplast is the small kinetonucleus. The principal nucleus, round\r\nor oval in form, is situated near the center of the body. Asexual\r\nreproductions occurs in this stage, by longitudinal fission, the nucleus\r\nand the blepheroplast dividing independently of one another. From the\r\nblepheroplast of one of the daughter cells a new flagellum is formed.\r\n\r\nAmong the pathogenic species are to be found the causative organisms of\r\nsome of the most serious diseases of domestic animals and even of man.\r\nIt is probable that these pathogenic species secrete a specific poison.\r\nThe majority of them are tropical in distribution.\r\n\r\nThough we are concerned especially with the species which infest man, we\r\nshall first consider two of the trypanosomes of lower animals, known\r\nlong before any of those of man had been found.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLEAS AND LICE AS CARRIERS OF TRYPANOSOMA LEWISI.--_Trypanosoma lewisi_,\r\nthe first mammalian trypanosome known, is to be found in the blood of\r\nwild rats. Like its host, it appears to be cosmopolitan in distribution,\r\nhaving been reported from several localities in the United States,\r\nBrazil, Argentine, England, Germany, France, Italy, Russia, Asia and\r\nAfrica.\r\n\r\nThis species is usually regarded as non-pathogenic, but in experimental\r\nwork, especially with white rats, heavy infestations often result\r\nfatally, and naturally infested specimens sometimes show evidence of\r\ninjury. Rats which have been infested exhibit at least temporary\r\nimmunity against new infection.\r\n\r\n_Trypanosoma lewisi_ is transmitted from rat to rat by fleas and by\r\nlice. Rabinowitsch and Kempner (1899) first found that healthy rats\r\nwhich were kept with infested rats, showed trypanosomes in their blood\r\nafter about two weeks. They found the trypanosomes in the alimentary\r\ncanal of fleas which had fed on the diseased rats. On teasing such fleas\r\nin physiological salt solution and inoculating them into fresh rats they\r\nwere able to produce the infection. Finally, they showed that the fleas\r\nwhich had fed upon infested rats were able to carry the parasites to\r\nhealthy rats. Corresponding experiments with lice were not successful.\r\nProwazek (1905) found in the rat louse (_Haematopinus spinulosus_)\r\norganisms which he regarded as developmental stages of the _Trypanosoma\r\nlewisi_. He believed that the sexual cycle was undergone in this insect.\r\n\r\nNuttall (1908) readily transmitted the trypanosomes through the agency\r\nof fleas, (_Ceratophyllus fasciatus_ and _Ctenopthalmus agyrtes_). He\r\nbelieves that these insects are probably the chief transmitters of the\r\nparasite. He was also able to transmit it from diseased to healthy rats\r\nthrough the agency of the rat louse. He was unable to trace any\r\ndevelopmental stages in the louse and inclined to the opinion that\r\nProwazek was deceived by the presence of extraneous flagellates such as\r\nare known to exist in a number of blood-sucking arthropods.\r\n\r\nNuttall concludes that since three distinct kinds of blood-sucking\r\ninsects are capable of transmitting _Trypanosoma lewisi_ it appears\r\ndoubtful that this flagellate is a parasite of the invertebrate \"host\"\r\nin the sense claimed by Prowazek and other investigators.\r\n\r\n\r\nTSETSE-FLIES AND NAGANA--One of the greatest factors in retarding the\r\ndevelopment of certain regions of Africa has been the presence of a\r\nsmall fly, little larger than the common house-fly. This is the\r\ntsetse-fly, _Glossina morsitans_ (fig. 165) renowned on account of the\r\nsupposed virulence of its bite for cattle, horses and other domestic\r\nmammals.\r\n\r\nThe technical characteristics of the tsetse-flies, or Glossinas, and\r\ntheir several species, will be found in a later chapter. We need\r\nemphasize only that they are blood-sucking Muscidae and that, unlike the\r\nmosquitoes, the sexes resemble each other closely in structure of the\r\nmouth-parts, and in feeding habits.\r\n\r\nIn 1894, Colonel David Bruce discovered that the fly was not in itself\r\npoisonous but that the deadly effect of its bite was due to the fact\r\nthat it transmitted a highly pathogenic blood parasite, _Trypanosoma\r\nbrucei_. This trypanosome Bruce had discovered in the blood of South\r\nAfrican cattle suffering from a highly fatal disease known as \"nagana\".\r\nOn inoculating the blood of infected cattle into horses and dogs he\r\nproduced the disease and found the blood teeming with the causative\r\norganism. In the course of his work he established beyond question that\r\nthe \"nagana\" and the tsetse-fly disease were identical.\r\n\r\nTsetse-flies of the species _Glossina morsitans_, which fed upon\r\ndiseased animals, were found capable of giving rise to the disease in\r\nhealthy animals up to forty-eight hours after feeding. Wild tsetse-flies\r\ntaken from an infected region to a region where they did not normally\r\noccur were able to transmit the disease to healthy animals. It was found\r\nthat many of the wild animals in the tsetse-fly regions harbored\r\n_Trypanosoma brucei_ in their blood, though they showed no evidence of\r\ndisease. As in the case of natives of malarial districts, these animals\r\nacted as reservoirs of the parasite. Non-immune animals subjected to the\r\nattacks of the insect carrier, quickly succumbed to the disease.\r\n\r\nA question of prime importance is as to whether the insect serves as an\r\nessential host of the pathogenic protozoan or whether it is a mere\r\nmechanical carrier. Bruce inclined to the latter view. He was unable to\r\nfind living trypanosomes in the intestines or excrements of the fly or\r\nto produce the disease on the many occasions when he injected the\r\nexcrement into healthy animals. Moreover, he had found that the\r\nexperimental flies were infective only during the first forty-eight\r\nhours and that if wild flies were taken from the infected region, \"kept\r\nwithout food for three days and then fed on a healthy dog, they never\r\ngave rise to the disease.\"\r\n\r\nKoch had early described what he regarded as sexual forms from the\r\nintestine of the fly but it remained for Kleine (1909) to experimentally\r\ndemonstrate that a part of the life cycle of the parasite was undergone\r\nin the fly. Working with _Glossina palpalis_, he found that for a period\r\nof ten days or longer after feeding on an animal suffering from nagana\r\nit was non-infective, but that then it became infective and was able to\r\ntransmit the disease for weeks thereafter. He discovered and described\r\ndevelopmental stages of the parasite within the intestine of the insect.\r\nIn other words, the tsetse-fly (in nature, _Glossina morsitans_), serves\r\nas an essential host, within which an important part of the life cycle\r\nof the parasite is undergone. These conclusions were quickly verified by\r\nBruce and numerous other workers and are no longer open to question.\r\nKlein and Taute are even inclined to think that mechanical transmission\r\nplays practically no role in nature, unless the fly is interrupted while\r\nfeeding and passes immediately to a new animal.\r\n\r\n\r\nTSETSE-FLIES AND SLEEPING SICKNESS OF MAN--About the beginning of the\r\npresent century a hitherto little known disease of man began to attract\r\ngreat attention on account of its ravages in Uganda and the region of\r\nVictoria Nyanza in South Africa. It was slow, insiduous and absolutely\r\nfatal, characterized in its later stages by dullness, apathy, and\r\nfinally absolute lethargy all day long, symptoms which gave it the name\r\nof \"sleeping sickness.\"\r\n\r\nIt was soon found that the disease was not a new one but that it had\r\nbeen known for over a hundred years on the west coast of Africa. Its\r\nintroduction into Central and East Africa and its rapid spread have been\r\nattributed primarily to the development of the country, the formation of\r\nnew trade routes and the free mingling of native tribes formerly\r\nisolated. It is estimated that in the first ten years of the present\r\ncentury there were approximately two hundred thousand deaths from the\r\ndisease in the Uganda protectorate. In the British province Bugosa, on\r\nthe Victoria Nyanza there were thirty thousand deaths in the period from\r\n1902-1905.\r\n\r\nWhile the disease is peculiarly African there are a number of instances\r\nof its accidental introduction into temperate regions. Slaves suffering\r\nfrom it were occasionally brought to America in the early part of the\r\nlast century and cases have sometimes been imported into England. In\r\nnone of the cases did the disease gain a foothold or spread at all to\r\nother individuals.\r\n\r\nIn 1902 Dutton described a trypanosome, _T. gambiense_, which he and\r\nForde had found the year before in the blood of a patient suffering from\r\na peculiar type of fever in Gambia. In 1902-1903 Castellani found the\r\nsame parasite in the cerebro-spinal fluid of sleeping-sickness patients\r\nand definitely reported it as the causative organism of the disease. His\r\nwork soon found abundant confirmation, and it was discovered that the\r\nsleeping sickness was but the ultimate phase of the fever discovered by\r\nDutton and Forde.\r\n\r\nWhen Castellani made known his discovery of the trypanosome of sleeping\r\nsickness, Brumpt, in France, and Sambon, in England, independently\r\nadvanced the theory that the disease was transmitted by the tsetse-fly,\r\n_Glossina palpalis_. This theory was based upon the geographical\r\ndistribution and epidemiology of the disease. Since then it has been\r\nabundantly verified by experimental evidence.\r\n\r\nFortunately for the elucidation of problems relating to the methods of\r\ntransfer of sleeping sickness, _Trypanosoma gambiense_ is pathogenic for\r\nmany species of animals. In monkeys it produces symptoms very similar to\r\nthose caused in man. Bruce early showed that _Glossina palpalis_ \"fed on\r\nhealthy monkeys eight, twelve, twenty-four and forty-eight hours after\r\nhaving fed on a native suffering from trypanosomiasis, invariably\r\ntransmitted the disease. After three days the flies failed to transmit\r\nit.\" In his summary in Osler's Modern Medicine, he continues \"But this\r\nis not the only proof that these flies can carry the infective agent. On\r\nthe lake shore there was a large native population among whom we had\r\nfound about one-third to be harboring trypanosomes in their blood. The\r\ntsetse-flies caught on this lake shore, brought to the laboratory in\r\ncages, and placed straightway on healthy monkeys, gave them the disease\r\nin every instance, and furnished a startling proof of the danger of\r\nloitering along the lake shore among those infected flies.\"\r\n\r\nAs in the case of nagana, Bruce and most of the earlier investigators\r\nsupposed the transmission of the sleeping sickness trypanosome by\r\n_Glossina palpalis_ to be purely mechanical. The work of Kleine (1909)\r\nclearly showed that for _Trypanosoma gambiense_ as well as for\r\n_Trypanosoma brucei_ the fly served as an essential host. Indeed, Kleine\r\nand many subsequent investigators are inclined to think that there is\r\npractically no mechanical transmission of trypanosomes from animal to\r\nanimal by _Glossina_ in nature, and that the many successful experiments\r\nof the earlier investigators were due to the fact that they used wild\r\nflies which already harbored the transformed parasite rather than\r\ndirectly inoculated it from the blood of the diseased experimental\r\nanimals. While the criticism is applicable to some of the work, this\r\nextreme view is not fully justified by the evidence at hand.\r\n\r\nKleine states (1912) that _Glossina palpalis_ can no longer be regarded\r\nas the sole transmitter of sleeping sickness. Taute (1911) had shown\r\nthat under experimental conditions _Glossina morsitans_ was capable of\r\ntransferring the disease and Kleine calls attention to the fact that in\r\nGerman East Africa, in the district of the Rovuma River, at least a\r\ndozen cases of the disease have occurred recently, though only _Glossina\r\nmorsitans_ exists in the district. It appears, however, that these cases\r\nare due to a different parasite, _Trypanosoma rhodesiense_. This\r\nspecies, found especially in north-east Rhodesia and in Nyassaland, is\r\ntransferred by _Glossina morsitans_.\r\n\r\nOther workers maintain that the disease may be transmitted by various\r\nblood-sucking flies, or even bugs and lice which attack man. Fulleborn\r\nand Mayer (1907) have shown by conclusive experiments that _Aedes\r\n(Stegomyia) calopus_ may transmit it from one animal to another if the\r\ntwo bites immediately succeed each other.\r\n\r\nIt is not possible that insects other than the tsetse-flies (and only\r\ncertain species of these), play an important role in the transmission of\r\nthe disease, else it would be much more wide-spread. Sambon (1908)\r\npointed out that the hypothesis that is spread by _Aedes calopus_ is\r\nopposed by the fact that the disease never spread in the Antilles,\r\nthough frequently imported there by West African slaves. The same\r\nobservation would apply also to conditions in our own Southern States in\r\nthe early part of the past century.\r\n\r\nSince _Glossina palpalis_ acts as an essential host of the parasite and\r\nthe chief, if not the only, transmitter, the fight against sleeping\r\nsickness, like that against malaria and yellow fever, becomes primarily\r\na problem in economic entomology. The minutest detail of the\r\nlife-history, biology, and habits of the fly, and of its parasites and\r\nother natural enemies becomes of importance in attempts to eradicate the\r\ndisease. Here we can consider only the general features of the subject.\r\n\r\n_Glossina palpalis_ lives in limited areas, where the forest and\r\nundergrowth is dense, along the lake shore or river banks. According to\r\nHodges, the natural range from shore is under thirty yards, though the\r\ndistance to which the flies may follow man greatly exceed this.\r\n\r\nIt is a day feeder, a fact which may be taken advantage of in avoiding\r\nexposure to its attacks. The young are brought forth alive and\r\nfull-grown, one every nine or ten days. Without feeding, they enter the\r\nground and under favorable conditions, complete their development in a\r\nmonth or more.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 137. Sleeping sickness concentration camp in German East\r\nAfrica. Report of German Commission.]\r\n\r\nMethods of control of the disease must look to the prevention of\r\ninfection of the flies, and to their avoidance and destruction. Along\r\nthe first line, much was hoped from temporary segregation of the sick in\r\nregions where the fly was not found. On the assumption that the flies\r\nacted as carriers only during the first two or three days, it was\r\nsupposed that even the \"fly belts\" would become safe within a few days\r\nafter the sick were removed. The problem was found to be a much more\r\ndifficult one when it was learned that after a given brief period the\r\nfly again became infective and remained so for an indeterminate period.\r\nNevertheless, isolation of the sick is one of the most important\r\nmeasures in preventing the spread of the disease into new districts.\r\nMuch, too, is being accomplished by moving native villages from the fly\r\nbelts. (c.f. fig. 137.)\r\n\r\nAll measures to avoid the flies should be adopted. This means locating\r\nand avoiding the fly belts as far as possible, careful screening of\r\nhouses, and protection of the body against bites.\r\n\r\nClearing the jungle along the water courses for some yards beyond the\r\nnatural range of the fly has proved a very important measure. Castellani\r\nrecommends that the area be one hundred yards and around a village three\r\nhundred yards at least.\r\n\r\nDetailed studies of the parasites and the natural enemies of the\r\ntsetse-fly are being undertaken and may ultimately yield valuable\r\nresults.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTH AMERICAN TRYPANOSOMIASIS--The tsetse-flies are distinctively\r\nAfrican in distribution and until recently there were no trypanosomes\r\nknown to infest man in America. In 1909 Dr. Chagas, of Rio de Janeiro\r\ndescribed a new species, _Trypanosoma cruzi_, pathogenic to man.\r\n\r\n_Trypanosoma cruzi_ is the causative organism of a disease common in\r\nsome regions of Brazil, where it is known as \"opilacao.\" It is\r\nespecially to be met with in children and is characterized by extreme\r\nanemia, wasting, and stunted development associated with fever, and\r\nenlargement of the thyroid glands. The disease is transmitted by the\r\nbites of several species of assassin-bugs, or Reduviidae, notably by\r\n_Conorhinus megistus_. The evolution of the parasite within the bug has\r\nbeen studied especially by Chagas and by Brumpt. From the latter's text\r\nwe take the following summary.\r\n\r\nThe adult trypanosomes, ingested by a _Conorhinus megistus_, of any\r\nstage, first change into Crithidia-like forms and then those which\r\nremain in the stomach become ovoid and non-motile. Brumpt found these\r\nforms in immense numbers, in a _Conorhinus_ which had been infested\r\nfourteen months before. The forms which pass into the intestine quickly\r\nassume the _Crithidia_ form and continue to develop rapidly under this\r\nform. Some weeks later they evolve into the trypanosome forms,\r\npathogenic for man. They then pass out with the excrement of the bug and\r\ninfect the vertebrate host as soon as they come in contact with any\r\nmucous layer (buccal, ocular or rectal). More rarely they enter through\r\nthe epidermis.\r\n\r\nBrumpt showed that the development could take place in three species;\r\nbed-bugs (_Cimex lectularius_, _C. hemipterus_) and in the tick\r\n_Ornithodoros moubata_. The evolution proceeds in the first two species\r\nof bed-bugs as rapidly as in Conorhinus, or even more rapidly, but they\r\nremain infective for a much shorter time and hence Brumpt considers that\r\nthey play a much less important role in the spread of the disease.\r\n\r\n_Conorhinus megistus_, like related forms in our Southern States, very\r\ncommonly frequents houses and attacks man with avidity. Chagas states\r\nthat the bites are painless and do not leave any traces. They are\r\nusually inflicted on the lips, or the cheeks and thus the buccal mucosa\r\nof a sleeper may be soiled by the dejections of the insect and the bite\r\nserving as a port of entry of the virus, remain unnoticed.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of some of our North American Reduviidae playing a\r\nsimilar role in the transmission of disease should not be overlooked.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEISHMANIOSES AND INSECTS--Closely related to the trypanosomes is a\r\ngroup of intracellular parasites which have recently been grouped by\r\nRoss under the genus _Leishmania_. Five species are known to affect man.\r\nThree of these produce local skin infestations, but two of them,\r\n_Leishmania donovani_ and _L. infantum_, produce serious and often fatal\r\nsystemic diseases.\r\n\r\nThe first of these, that produced by _L. donovani_, is an exceedingly\r\nvirulent disease common in certain regions of India and China. It is\r\ncommonly known as \"Kala-azar,\" or \"dum-dum\" fever, and more technically\r\nas tropical leishmaniasis. Patton (1907) believes that the parasite is\r\ntransmitted by the bed-bug _Cimex hemipterus_, and has described a\r\ndevelopmental cycle similar to that which can be found in artificial\r\ncultures. On the other hand, Donovan was unable to confirm Patton's work\r\nand believes that the true intermediate host is a Reduviid bug,\r\n_Conorhinus rubrofasciatus_.\r\n\r\n_Leishmania infantum_ is the cause of the so-called infantile splenic\r\nleishmaniasis, occurring in northern Africa, Spain, Portugal, Italy, and\r\npossibly other parts of Europe. The parasite occurs habitually in the\r\ndog and is only accidentally transferred to children. Alvares and da\r\nSilva, in Portugal (according to Brumpt, 1913) have found that the\r\nexcrement of a flea from a diseased dog contains flagellates, and they\r\nsuggest that the infection may be transmitted by the accidental\r\ninoculation of this excrement by means of the proboscis of the flea, as\r\nhas been thought to occur in the case of the plague. To this Brumpt\r\nobjects that they and other workers who thought to trace the development\r\nof _Leishmania infantum_ were apparently misled by the presence of a\r\nharmless _Herpetomonas_ which infests dog fleas in all countries, even\r\nwhere the leishmaniasis is unknown.\r\n\r\nBasile (1910 and 1911) however, carried on numerous experiments\r\nindicating that the disease was transferred from children to dogs and\r\nfrom dog to dog by the dog flea, and was able to find in the tissues of\r\nthe insects forms perfectly identical with those found in children and\r\nin dogs suffering from leishmaniasis. He also found that _Pulex\r\nirritans_ was capable of acting as the carrier.\r\n\r\nOf the cutaneous type of leishmaniasis, the best known is the so-called\r\n\"Oriental sore,\" an ulcerative disease of the skin which is epidemic in\r\nmany tropical and subtropical regions. The causative organism is\r\n_Leishmania tropica_, which occurs in the diseased tissues as bodies\r\nvery similar to those found in the spleen in cases of Kala-azar. The\r\ndisease is readily inoculable and there is no doubt that it may be\r\ntransferred from the open sores to abraded surfaces of a healthy\r\nindividual by house-flies. It is also believed by a number of\r\ninvestigators that it may be transferred and directly inoculated by\r\nvarious blood-sucking insects.\r\n\r\n\r\nTICKS AND DISEASES OF MAN AND ANIMALS\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the way to the discoveries of the relations of\r\narthropods to disease was pointed out by the work of Leuckart and\r\nMelnikoff on the life cycle of _Dipylidium_, and of Fedtschenko and\r\nManson on that of _Filaria_. They dealt with grosser forms, belonging to\r\nwell-recognized parasitic groups.\r\n\r\nThis was long before the role of any insect as a carrier of pathogenic\r\nmicro-organisms had been established, and before the Protozoa were\r\ngenerally regarded as of importance in the causation of disease. The\r\nnext important step was taken in 1889 when Smith and Kilbourne\r\nconclusively showed that the so-called Texas fever of cattle, in the\r\nUnited States, is due to an intracorpuscular blood parasite transmitted\r\nexclusively by a tick. This discovery, antedating by eight years the\r\nwork on the relation of the mosquito to malaria, had a very great\r\ninfluence on subsequent studies along these lines.\r\n\r\nWhile much of the recent work has dealt with the true insects, or\r\nhexapods, it is now known that several of the most serious diseases of\r\nanimals, and at least two important diseases of man are tick borne.\r\nThese belong to the types known collectively as _babesioses_ (or\r\n\"_piroplasmoses_\"), and _spirochaetoses_.\r\n\r\nThe term _babesiosis_ is applied to a disease of man or animals which is\r\ncaused by minute protozoan parasites of the genus _Babesia_, living in\r\nthe red blood corpuscles. These parasites have usually been given the\r\ngeneric name _Piroplasma_ and hence the type of disease which they cause\r\nis often referred to as \"_piroplasmosis_.\" The best known illustration\r\nis the disease known in this country as Texas fever of cattle.\r\n\r\n\r\nCATTLE TICKS AND TEXAS FEVER--The cattle disease, which in the United\r\nStates is known as Texas fever, is a widely distributed, exceedingly\r\nacute disease. In Australia it is known as _redwater fever_ and in\r\nEurope as haemoglobinuria, due to the fact that the urine of the diseased\r\nanimals is discolored by the breaking down of the red blood corpuscles\r\ninfested by the parasite.\r\n\r\nIn their historical discussion, Smith and Kilbourne, point out that as\r\nfar back as 1796 it was noted that Southern cattle, in a state of\r\napparent health, might spread a fatal disease among Northern herds. As\r\nobservations accumulated, it was learned that this infection was carried\r\nonly during the warm season of the year and in the depth of winter\r\nSouthern cattle were harmless. Moreover, Southern cattle after remaining\r\nfor a short time in the North lost their power to transmit the disease,\r\nand the same was true of cattle which had been driven for a considerable\r\ndistance.\r\n\r\nVery significant was the fact that the infection was not communicated\r\ndirectly from the Southern to Northern cattle but that the ground over\r\nwhich the former passed was infected by them, and that the infection was\r\ntransmitted thence to susceptible cattle _after a period of not less\r\nthan thirty days had elapsed_.\r\n\r\nOf course a disease as striking as this, and which caused such enormous\r\nlosses of cattle in the region invaded was fruitful in theories\r\nconcerning its causation. The most widespread was the belief that\r\npastures were infected by the saliva, urine, or manure of Southern\r\ncattle. There were not wanting keen observers who suggested that the\r\ndisease was caused by ticks, but little weight was given to their view.\r\n\r\nVarious workers had described bacteria which they had isolated from the\r\norgans of the diseased animals, but their findings could not be\r\nverified. In 1889, Smith and Kilbourne discovered a minute, pear-shaped\r\norganism (fig. 138) in the red blood corpuscles of a cow which had\r\nsuccumbed to Texas fever. On account of their shape they were given the\r\ngeneric name _Pyrososma_ and because they were usually found two in a\r\ncorpuscle, the specific name, _bigeminum_. It is now generally accepted\r\nthat the parasite is the same which Babes had observed the year before\r\nin Roumanian cattle suffering from haemoglobinuria, and should be known\r\nas _Babesia bovis_ (Babes).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 138. Babesia bovis in blood corpuscles. After Calli.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 139. The cattle tick (Boophilus annulatus). (_a_) Female;\r\n(_b_) male. After Comstock.]\r\n\r\nBy a series of perfectly conclusive experiments carried on near\r\nWashington, D.C., Smith and Kilbourne showed that this organism was\r\ncarried from Southern cattle to non-immune animals by the so-called\r\nSouthern cattle tick, _Boophilus annulatus_ (= _Margaropus annulatus_)\r\n(fig. 139).\r\n\r\nOf fourteen head of native cattle placed in a field with tick-infested\r\nNorthern cattle all but two contracted the disease. This experiment was\r\nrepeated with similar results. Four head of native cattle kept in a plot\r\nwith three North Carolina cattle which had been carefully freed from\r\nticks remained healthy. A second experiment the same year gave similar\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nStill more conclusive was the experiment showing that fields which had\r\nnot been entered by Southern cattle but which had been infected by\r\nmature ticks taken from such animals would produce Texas fever in native\r\ncattle. On September 13, 1889, several thousand ticks collected from\r\ncattle in North Carolina three and four days before, were scattered in a\r\nsmall field near Washington. Three out of four native animals placed in\r\nthis field contracted the disease. The fourth animal was not examined as\r\nto its blood but it showed no external symptoms of the disease.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 140. Hyalomma aegypticum. After Nuttall and Warburton.]\r\n\r\nIn these earlier experiments it was believed that the cattle tick acted\r\nas a carrier of the disease between the Southern cattle and the _soil_\r\nof the Northern pastures. \"It was believed that the tick obtained the\r\nparasite from the blood of its host and in its dissolution on the\r\npasture a certain resistant spore form was set free which produced the\r\ndisease when taken in with the food.\" The feeding of one animal for some\r\ntime with grass from the most abundantly infected field, without any\r\nappearance of the disease, made this hypothesis untenable.\r\n\r\nIn the experimental work in 1890 the astonishing fact was brought out\r\nthat the disease was conveyed neither by infected ticks disintegrating\r\nnor by their directly transferring the parasite, but that it was\r\nconveyed by the young hatched from eggs of infected ticks. In other\r\nwords, the disease was hereditarily transferred to ticks of the second\r\ngeneration and they alone were capable of conveying it.\r\n\r\nThus was explained the fact that Texas fever did not appear immediately\r\nalong the route of Southern cattle being driven to Northern markets but\r\nthat after a certain definite period it manifested itself. It was\r\nconveyed by the progeny of ticks which had dropped from the Southern\r\ncattle and deposited their eggs on the ground.\r\n\r\nThese results have been fully confirmed by workers in different parts of\r\nthe world,--notably by Koch, in Africa, and by Pound, in Australia.\r\n\r\nThe disease is apparently transmitted by _Boophilus annulatus_ alone, in\r\nthe United States, but it, or an almost identical disease, is conveyed\r\nby _Ixodes hexagonus_ in Norway, _Ixodes ricinus_ in Finland and France\r\nand by the three species, _Boophilus decoloratus_, _Hyalomma aegypticum_\r\n(fig. 140 and 141), and _Haemaphysalis punctata_ in Africa.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 141. Hyalomma aegypticum. Capitulum of female; (_a_)\r\ndorsal, (_b_) ventral aspect.]\r\n\r\nIn spite of the detailed study which it has received, the life cycle of\r\n_Babesia bovis_ has not been satisfactorily worked out. The asexual\r\nreproduction in the blood of the vertebrate host has been described but\r\nthe cycle in the tick is practically unknown.\r\n\r\nMore successful attempts have been made to work out the life cycle of a\r\nrelated species, _Babesia canis_, which causes malignant jaundice in\r\ndogs in Africa and parts of Southern Europe. In this instance, also, the\r\ndisease is transmitted by heredity to the ticks of the second\r\ngeneration. Yet the larval, or \"seed ticks,\" from an infected female are\r\nnot capable of conveying the disease, but only the nymphs and adults.\r\nStill more complicated is the condition in the case of _Babesia ovis_ of\r\nsheep, which Motas has shown can be conveyed solely by the adult,\r\nsexually mature ticks of the second generation.\r\n\r\nIn _Babesia canis_, Christopher (1907) observed developmental stages in\r\nthe tick. He found in the stomach of adult ticks, large motile\r\nclub-shaped bodies which he considered as ookinetes. These bodies pass\r\nto the ovaries of the tick and enter the eggs where they become globular\r\nin form and probably represent an oocyst. This breaks up into a number\r\nof sporoblasts which enter the tissues of the developing tick and give\r\nrise to numerous sporozoites, which collect in the salivary glands and\r\nthence are transferred to the vertebrate host. A number of other species\r\nof _Babesia_ are known to infest vertebrates and in all the cases where\r\nthe method has been worked out it has been found that the conveyal was\r\nby ticks. We shall not consider the cases more fully here, as we are\r\nconcerned especially with the method of transfer of human diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\nTICKS AND ROCKY MOUNTAIN SPOTTED FEVER OF MAN--Ever since 1873 there has\r\nbeen known in Montana and Idaho a peculiar febrile disease of man, which\r\nhas gained the name of \"Rocky Mountain spotted fever.\" Its onset is\r\nmarked by chills and fever which rapidly become acute. In about four to\r\nseven days there appears a characteristic eruption on the wrists, ankles\r\nor back, which quickly covers the body.\r\n\r\nMcClintic (1912) states that the disease has now been reported from\r\npractically all of the Rocky Mountain States, including Arizona,\r\nCalifornia, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, Oregon, Utah, Washington,\r\nand Wyoming. \"Although the disease is far more prevalent in Montana and\r\nIdaho than in any of the other States, its spread has assumed such\r\nproportions in the last decade as to call for the gravest consideration\r\non the part of both the state and national health authorities. In fact,\r\nthe disease has so spread from state to state that it has undoubtedly\r\nbecome a very serious interstate problem demanding the institution of\r\nmeasures for its control and suppression.\"\r\n\r\nA peculiar feature of the Rocky Mountain spotted fever is a marked\r\nvariation in its severity in different localities. In Montana, and\r\nespecially in the famous Bitter Root Valley, from 33 per cent to 75 per\r\ncent of the cases result fatally. On the other hand, the fatality does\r\nnot exceed four per cent in Idaho.\r\n\r\nIn 1902, Wilson and Chowning reported the causative organism of spotted\r\nfever to be a blood parasite akin to the _Babesia_ of Texas fever, and\r\nmade the suggestion that the disease was tick-borne. The careful studies\r\nof Stiles (1905) failed to confirm the supposed discovery of the\r\norganism, and the disease is now generally classed as due to an\r\ninvisible virus. On the other hand, the accumulated evidence has fully\r\nsubstantiated the hypothesis that it is tick-borne.\r\n\r\nAccording to Ricketts (1907) the experimental evidence in support of\r\nthis hypothesis was first afforded by Dr. L. P. McCalla and Dr. H. A.\r\nBrereton, in 1905. These investigators transmitted the disease from man\r\nto man in two experiments. \"The tick was obtained 'from the chest of a\r\nman very ill with spotted fever' and 'applied to the arm of a man who\r\nhad been in the hospital for two months and a half, and had lost both\r\nfeet from gangrene due to freezing.' On the eighth day the patient\r\nbecame very ill and passed through a mild course of spotted fever,\r\nleaving a characteristic eruption. The experiment was repeated by\r\nplacing the tick on a woman's leg and she likewise was infected with\r\nspotted fever.\"\r\n\r\nThe most detailed studies were those of the late Dr. H. T. Ricketts, and\r\nit was he who clearly established the tick hypothesis. In the summer of\r\n1906 he found that guinea pigs and monkeys are very susceptible to\r\nspotted fever and can readily be infected by inoculation of blood from\r\npatients suffering from the disease. This opened the way to experimental\r\nwork on tick transmission. A female tick was fed upon an infected guinea\r\npig for two days, removed and isolated for two days and then placed upon\r\na healthy guinea pig. After an incubation period of three and a half\r\ndays the experimental animal contracted a well-marked case of the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nA similar result was obtained at the same time by King, and later in the\r\nseason Ricketts proved that the male tick was also capable of\r\ntransmitting the disease. He found that there was a very intimate\r\nrelation of the virus to the tick and that the transmission must be\r\nregarded as biological throughout. Ticks remained infective as long as\r\nthey lived and would feed for a period of several months. If they\r\nacquired the disease in the larval or nymphal stage they retained it\r\nduring molting and were infective in the subsequent stages. In a few\r\ncases the larvae from an infected female were infective.\r\n\r\nThe evidence indicated that the tick suffers from a relatively harmless,\r\ngeneralized infection and the virus proliferates in its body. The\r\ndisease probably is transferred through the salivary secretion of the\r\ntick since inoculation experiments show that the salivary glands of the\r\ninfected adult contain the virus.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that in nature the reservoir of the virus of spotted\r\nfever is some one or more of the native small animals. Infected ticks\r\nhave been found in nature, and as various wild animals are susceptible\r\nto the disease, it is obvious that it may exist among them unnoticed.\r\nWilson and Chowning suggested that the ground squirrel plays the\r\nprincipal role.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, much confusion exists regarding the correct name of the\r\ntick which normally conveys the disease. In the medical literature it is\r\nusually referred to as _Dermacentor occidentalis_, but students of the\r\ngroup now agree that it is specifically distinct. Banks has designated\r\nit as _Dermacentor venustus_ and this name is used in the publications\r\nof the Bureau of Entomology. On the other hand, Stiles maintains that\r\nthe common tick of the Bitter Root Valley, and the form which has been\r\ncollected by the authors who have worked on Rocky Mountain spotted fever\r\nin that region, is separable from _D. venustus_, and he has described it\r\nunder the name of _Dermacentor andersoni_.\r\n\r\nMayer (1911) has shown experimentally that spotted fever may be\r\ntransmitted by several different species of ticks, notably _Dermacentor\r\nmarginatus_, _Dermacentor variabilis_ and _Amblyomma americanum_. This\r\nbeing the case, the question of the exact systematic status of the\r\nspecies experimented upon in the Bitter Root Valley becomes less\r\nimportant, for since _Dermacentor occidentalis_, _Dermacentor venustus_\r\nand _Dermacentor andersoni_ all readily attack man, it is probable that\r\neither species would readily disseminate the disease if it should spread\r\ninto their range.\r\n\r\nHunter and Bishop (1911) have emphasized the fact that in the eastern\r\nand southern United States there occur several species which attack man,\r\nand any one of which might transmit the disease from animal to animal\r\nand from animal to man. The following species, they state, would\r\nprobably be of principal importance in the Southern and Eastern States:\r\nthe lone star tick (_Amblyomma americanum_); the American dog tick\r\n(_Dermacentor variabilis_); and the gulf-coast tick (_Amblyomma\r\nmaculatum_). In the extreme southern portions of Texas, _Amblyomma\r\ncajennense_, is a common pest of man.\r\n\r\nSince the evidence all indicates that Rocky Mountain spotted fever is\r\ntransmitted solely by the tick, and that some of the wild animals serve\r\nas reservoirs of the virus, it is obvious that personal prophylaxis\r\nconsists in avoiding the ticks as fully as possible, and in quickly\r\nremoving those which do attack. General measures along the line of tick\r\neradication must be carried out if the disease is to be controlled. That\r\nsuch measures are feasible has been shown by the work which has been\r\ndone in controlling the tick-borne Texas fever of cattle, and by such\r\nwork as has already been done against the spotted fever tick, which\r\noccurs on both wild and domestic animals. Detailed consideration of\r\nthese measures is to be found in the publications of the Public Health\r\nand Marine Hospital Service, and the Bureau of Entomology. Hunter and\r\nBishopp give the following summarized recommendations for control or\r\neradication measures in the Bitter Root Valley.\r\n\r\n(1) A campaign of education, whereby all the residents of the valley\r\nwill be made thoroughly familiar with the feasibility of the plan of\r\neradication, and with what it will mean in the development of the\r\nvalley.\r\n\r\n(2) The obtaining of legislation to make it possible to dip or oil all\r\nlive stock in the Bitter Root Valley.\r\n\r\n(3) The obtaining of an accurate census of the horses, cattle, sheep,\r\nmules, and dogs in the valley.\r\n\r\n(4) The construction of ten or more dipping vats.\r\n\r\n(5) The providing of materials to be used in the dipping mixture.\r\n\r\n(6) The organization of a corps of workers to carry on the operations.\r\n\r\n(7) The systematic dipping of the horses, cattle, sheep, and dogs of the\r\nvalley on a definite weekly schedule from approximately March 10 to June\r\n9.\r\n\r\n(8) The treatment by hand of the animals in localities remote from vats,\r\non the same schedule.\r\n\r\nThey estimate that after three seasons' operations a very small annual\r\nexpenditure would provide against reinfestation of the valley by the\r\nincoming of cattle from other places.\r\n\r\nSupplementary measures consist in the killing of wild mammals which may\r\nharbor the tick; systematic burning of the brush and debris on the\r\nmountain side; and in clearing, since the tick is seldom found on land\r\nunder cultivation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nARTHROPODS AS ESSENTIAL HOSTS OF PATHOGENIC PROTOZOA [_Continued_]\r\n\r\n\r\nARTHROPODS AND SPIROCHAETOSES OF MAN AND ANIMALS\r\n\r\nThe term spirochaetoses is applied to diseases of man or animals which\r\nare due to protistan parasites belonging to the group of slender, spiral\r\norganisms known as spirochaetes.\r\n\r\nThere has been much discussion concerning the relationship Of the\r\nspirochaetes. Formerly, they were regarded as bacteria closely related to\r\nthe forms grouped in the genus _Spirillum_. The results of the detailed\r\nstudy which the spirochaetes have received in recent years, have led most\r\nof the workers to consider them as belonging to the protozoa. The merits\r\nof the discussion we are not concerned with here, but rather with the\r\nfact that a number of diseases caused by spirochaetes are\r\narthropod-borne. The better known of these we shall discuss.\r\n\r\n\r\nAFRICAN RELAPSING FEVER OF MAN--It has long been known to the natives of\r\nAfrica and to travelers in that country, that the bite of a certain\r\ntick, _Ornithodoros moubata_, may be followed by severe or even fatal\r\nfever of the relapsing type. Until recent years, it was supposed that\r\nthe effect was due to some special virulence of the tick, just as nagana\r\nof cattle was attributed to the direct effect of the bite of the\r\ntsetse-fly. The disease is commonly known as \"tick-fever\" or by the\r\nvarious native names of the tick.\r\n\r\nIn 1904, Ross and Milne, in Uganda, and Dutton and Todd on the Congo,\r\ndiscovered that the cause of the disease is a spirochaete which is\r\ntransmitted by the tick. This organism has been designated by Novy and\r\nKnapp as _Spirochaeta duttoni_.\r\n\r\n_Ornithodoros moubata_ (fig. 142), the carrier of African relapsing\r\nfever, or \"tick-fever,\" is widely distributed in tropical Africa, and\r\noccurs in great numbers in the huts of natives, in the dust, cracks and\r\ncrevices of the dirt floors, or the walls. It feeds voraciously on man\r\nas well as upon birds and mammals. Like others of the _Argasidae_, it\r\nresembles the bed-bug in its habit of feeding primarily at night. Dutton\r\nand Todd observed that the larval stage is undergone in the egg and that\r\nthe first free stage is that of the octopod nymph.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 142. Ornithodoros moubata. (_a_) Anterior part of venter;\r\n(_b_) second stage nymph; (_c_) capitulum; (_d_) dorsal and (_e_)\r\nventral aspect of female; (_f_) ventral aspect of nymph; (_g_) capitulum\r\nof nymph. After Nuttall and Warburton.]\r\n\r\nThe evidence that the fever is transmitted by this tick is conclusive.\r\nKoch found that from five per cent to fifteen per cent, and in some\r\nplaces, fifty per cent of the ticks captured, harbored the spirochaete.\r\nThe disease is readily transmitted to monkeys, rats, mice and other\r\nanimals and the earlier experiments along these lines have been\r\nconfirmed by many workers.\r\n\r\nNot only are the ticks which have fed on infected individuals capable of\r\nconveying the disease to healthy animals but they transmit the causative\r\norganism to their progeny. Thus Mollers (1907), working in Berlin,\r\nrepeatedly infected monkeys through the bites of nymphs which had been\r\nbred in the laboratory from infected ticks. Still more astonishing was\r\nhis discovery that ticks of the third generation were infective. In\r\nother words, if the progeny of infected ticks were fed throughout life\r\non healthy animals, and on maturity deposited eggs, the nymphs which\r\nhatched from these eggs would still be capable of carrying the\r\ninfection.\r\n\r\nThe developmental cycle of the spirochaete within the tick has not been\r\nfully worked out, though the general conclusions of Leishman (1910) have\r\nbeen supported by the recent works of Balfour (1911 and 1912), and\r\nHindle (1912), on the life cycle of spirochaetes affecting fowls.\r\n\r\n_Spirochaeta duttoni_ ingested by _Ornithodoros moubata_ apparently\r\ndisappear within a few days, but Leishman believed that in reality they\r\nbreak up into minute granules which are to be found in the alimentary\r\ncanal, the salivary glands and the Malpighian tubes of the tick. These\r\ngranules, or \"coccoid bodies,\" as Hindle calls them, are supposed to be\r\nthe form in which the spirochaetes infect the new host. We shall see\r\nlater that Marchoux and Couvy (1913) dissent wholly from this\r\ninterpretation.\r\n\r\nAccording to Leishman, and Hindle, the coccoid bodies are not injected\r\ninto the vertebrate host with the saliva of the tick, as are the\r\nsporozoites of malaria with that of the mosquito. Instead, they pass out\r\nwith the excrement and secondarily gain access to the wound inflicted by\r\nthe tick.\r\n\r\nNuttall (1912) calls attention to the fact that the geographical\r\ndistribution of _Ornithodoros moubata_ is far wider than our present\r\nrecords show for the distribution of the relapsing fever in man and that\r\nthere is every reason to fear the extension of the disease. Huts where\r\nthe ticks occur should be avoided and it should be remembered that in\r\ninfected localities there is special danger in sleeping on the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\nEUROPEAN RELAPSING FEVER--There is widely distributed in Europe a type\r\nof relapsing fever which is caused by _Spirochaeta recurrentis_. It has\r\nlong been supposed that this disease is spread by the bed-bug and there\r\nis some experimental evidence to show that it may be conveyed by these\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\nIn 1897, Tictin found that he could infect monkeys by inoculating the\r\ncontents of bed-bugs which had fed upon a patient within forty-eight\r\nhours. Nuttall, in 1907, in one experiment succeeded in transmitting\r\n_Spirochaeta recurrentis_ from mouse to mouse by bites of bed-bugs. The\r\nbugs, thirty-five in number, were transferred at short intervals from\r\none mouse to another, not being allowed to take a full meal on the\r\nfirst, or infected mouse.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, there is much clinical evidence to show that the\r\nEuropean relapsing fever like various other types of the disease is\r\ntransmitted from man to man by head and body lice (_Pediculus humanus_\r\nand _Pediculus corporis_).\r\n\r\nInteresting supplementary evidence is that of Bayon's observations\r\n(1912), in Moscow. \"Having visited the big municipal night hospitals at\r\nMoscow I soon noticed that they were kept with such scrupulous\r\ncleanliness, disinfected so lavishly, the beds of iron, the floor\r\ncemented, that it was not possible for bed-bugs to thrive to any extent\r\non the premises. The people sleeping there were allowed, however, to\r\nsleep in their own clothes. The introduction of these model homes had\r\nnot had any effect on the incidence of relapsing fever, for the places\r\nwere still hot-beds of the fever during winter. On the other hand,\r\nthough I changed my rooms several times, I found bugs in every\r\nsuccessive lodging, and I was told in Moscow, this can hardly be\r\navoided. Yet no foreigner, or Russian of the better class, ever catches\r\nrelapsing fever. To this may be added the fact that when I asked for\r\nclothes-lice and promised to pay a kopec for two, the attendants from\r\nthe night hostel brought me next morning a small ounce bottle crammed\r\nwith _Pediculus capitis_ (= _P. humanus_), and _Pediculus vestimentorum_\r\n(= _P. corporis_) collected off the sleepers. If relapsing fever were\r\ntransmitted by bed-bugs, it would be much more disseminated than it is\r\nat present in Moscow.\"\r\n\r\nDirect experimental evidence of the agency of lice in transmitting\r\nrelapsing fever is especially clear in the case of a type of the disease\r\nprevalent in parts of North Africa. We shall consider this evidence\r\nlater.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER TYPES OF RELAPSING FEVER OF MAN--In addition to the three types of\r\nhuman relapsing fever already referred to, several others have been\r\ndistinguished and have been attributed to distinct species of\r\nspirochaetes. The various spirochaetoses of man are:\r\n\r\nAfrican, caused by _S. duttoni_; European, caused by _S. recurrentis_;\r\nNorth African, caused by _S. berbera_; East African, caused by _S.\r\nrossi_; East Indian, caused by _S. carteri_; North American, caused by\r\n_S. novyi_; South American, caused by _S. duttoni_ (?).\r\n\r\nNuttall (1912) in his valuable resume of the subject, has emphasized\r\nthat \"in view of the morphological similarity of the supposedly\r\ndifferent species of spirochaetes and their individual variations in\r\nvirulence, we may well doubt if any of the 'species' are valid. As I\r\npointed out four years ago, the various specific names given to the\r\nspirochaetes causing relapsing fever in man may be used merely for\r\nconvenience _to distinguish strains or races_ of different origin. They\r\ncannot be regarded as valid names, in the sense of scientific\r\nnomenclature, for virulence and immunity reactions are not adequate\r\ntests of specificity.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTH AFRICAN RELAPSING FEVER OF MAN--The type of human relapsing fever\r\nto be met with in Algeria, Tunis, and Tripoli, is due to a _Spirochaeta_\r\nto which does not differ morphologically from _Spirochaeta duttoni_, but\r\nwhich has been separated on biological grounds as _Spirochaeta berberi_.\r\n\r\nExperimenting with this type of disease in Algeria, Sergent and Foly\r\n(1910), twice succeeded in transmitting it from man to monkeys by\r\ninoculation of crushed body lice and in two cases obtained infection of\r\nhuman subjects who had received infected lice under their clothing and\r\nwho slept under coverings harboring many of the lice which had fed upon\r\na patient. Their results were negative with _Argas persicus_, _Cimex\r\nlectularius_, _Musca domestica_, _Haematopinus spinulosus_ and\r\n_Ceratophyllus fasciatus_. They found body lice associated with every\r\ncase of relapsing fever which they found in Algeria.\r\n\r\nNicolle, Blaizot, and Conseil (1912) showed that the louse did not\r\ntransmit the parasite by its bite. Two or three hours after it has fed\r\non a patient, the spirochaetes begin to break up and finally they\r\ndisappear, so that after a day, repeated examinations fail to reveal\r\nthem. They persist, nevertheless, in some unknown form, for if the\r\nobservations are continued they reappear in eight to twelve days. These\r\nnew forms are virulent, for a monkey was infected by inoculating a\r\nsingle crushed louse which had fed on infected blood fifteen days\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nNatural infection is indirect. Those attacked by the insect scratch, and\r\nin this act they excoriate the skin, crush the lice and contaminate\r\ntheir fingers. The least abrasion of the skin serves for the entrance of\r\nthe spirochaetes. Even the contact of the soiled fingers on the various\r\nmucosa, such as the conjunctive of the eye, is sufficient.\r\n\r\nAs in the case of _Spirochaeta duttoni_, the organism is transmitted\r\nhereditarily in the arthropod vector. The progeny of lice which have fed\r\non infected blood may themselves be infective.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPIROCHAETOSIS OF FOWLS--One of the best known of the spirochaetes\r\ntransmitted by arthropods is _Spirochaeta gallinarum_, the cause of a\r\nvery fatal disease of domestic fowls in widely separated regions of the\r\nworld. According to Nuttall, it occurs in Southeastern Europe, Asia,\r\nAfrica, South America and Australia.\r\n\r\nIn 1903, Marchoux and Salimbeni, working in Brazil, made the first\r\ndetailed study of the disease, and showed that the causative organism is\r\ntransmitted from fowl to fowl by the tick _Argas persicus_. They found\r\nthat the ticks remained infective for at least five months. Specimens\r\nwhich had fed upon diseased birds in Brazil were sent to Nuttall and he\r\npromptly confirmed the experiments. Since that date many investigators,\r\nnotably Balfour and Hindle, have contributed to the elucidating of the\r\nlife-cycle of the parasite. Since it has been worked out more fully than\r\nhas that of any of the human spirochaetes, we present Hindle's diagram\r\n(fig. 143) and quote the brief summary from his preliminary paper\r\n(1911_b_).\r\n\r\n\"Commencing with the ordinary parasite in the blood of the fowl, the\r\nspirochaete grows until it reaches a certain length (16-19u) and then\r\ndivides by transverse division. This process is repeated, and is\r\nprobably the only method of multiplication of the parasite within the\r\nblood. When the spirochaetes disappear from the circulation, some of them\r\nbreak up into the coccoid bodies which, however, do not usually develop\r\nin the fowl. When the spirochaetes are ingested by _Argas persicus_, some\r\nof them pass through the gut wall into the coelomic fluid. From this\r\nmedium they bore their way into the cells of the various organs of the\r\ntick and there break up into a number of coccoid bodies. These\r\nintracellular forms multiply by ordinary fission in the cells of the\r\nMalpighian tubules and gonads. Some of the coccoid bodies are formed in\r\nthe lumen of the gut and Malpighian tubules. The result is that some of\r\nthe coccoid bodies may be present in the Malpighian secretion and\r\nexcrement of an infected tick and when mixed with the coxal fluid may\r\ngain entry into another fowl by the open wound caused by the tick's\r\nbite. They then elongate and redevelop into ordinary spirochaetes in the\r\nblood of the fowl, and the cycle may be repeated.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 143. Spirochaeta gallinarum. After Hindle.]\r\n\r\nHindle's account is clear cut and circumstantial, and is quite in line\r\nwith the work of Balfour, and of Leishman. Radically different is the\r\ninterpretation of Marchoux and Couvy (1913). These investigators\r\nmaintain that the granules localized in the Malpighian tubules in the\r\nlarvae and, in the adult, also in the ovules and the genital ducts of the\r\nmale and female, are not derived from spirochaetes but that they exist\r\nnormally in many acariens. They interpret the supposed disassociation\r\nof the spirochaete into granules as simply the first phase, not of a\r\nprocess of multiplication, but of a degeneration ending in the death of\r\nthe parasite. The fragmented chromatin has lost its affinity for stains,\r\nremaining always paler than that of the normal spirochaetes. On the other\r\nhand, the granules of Leishman stain energetically with all the basic\r\nstains.\r\n\r\nFurther, according to Marchoux and Couvy, infection takes place without\r\nthe emission of the coxal fluid and indeed, soiling of the host by the\r\ncoxal fluid diluting the excrement is exceptional. All of the organs of\r\nthe Argasid are invaded by the parasites, but they pass from the\r\ncoelom into the acini of the salivary glands and collect in its\r\nefferent canal. The saliva serves as the vehicle of infection.\r\n\r\nThus, the question of the life cycle of _Spirochaeta gallinarum_, and of\r\nspirochaetes in general, is an open one.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that _Argas persicus_, the carrier of _Spirochaeta\r\ngallinarum_, is a common pest of poultry in the southwestern United\r\nStates. Though the disease has not been reported from this country,\r\nconditions are such that if accidentally introduced, it might do great\r\ndamage.\r\n\r\n\r\nOTHER SPIROCHAETE DISEASES OF ANIMALS--About a score of other blood\r\ninhabiting spirochaetes have been reported as occurring in mammals, but\r\nlittle is known concerning their life-histories. One of the most\r\nimportant is _Spirochaeta theileri_ which produces a spirochaetosis of\r\ncattle in the Transvaal. Theiler has determined that it is transmitted\r\nby an Ixodid tick, _Margaropus decoloratus_.\r\n\r\n\r\nTYPHUS FEVER AND PEDICULIDAE\r\n\r\nTyphus is an acute, and continued fever, formerly epidemically prevalent\r\nin camps, hospitals, jails, and similar places where persons were\r\ncrowded together under insanitary conditions. It is accompanied by a\r\ncharacteristic rash, which gives the disease the common name of\r\n\"spotted\" or \"lenticular\" fever. The causative organism is unknown.\r\n\r\nTyphus fever has not generally been supposed to occur in the United\r\nStates, but there have been a few outbreaks and sporadic cases\r\nrecognized. According to Anderson and Goldberger (1912_a_), it has been\r\na subject of speculation among health authorities why, in spite of the\r\narrival of occasional cases in this country and of many persons from\r\nendemic foci of the disease, typhus fever apparently does not gain a\r\nfoothold in the United States. These same workers showed that the\r\nso-called Brill's disease, studied especially in New York City, is\r\nidentical with the typhus fever of Mexico and of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe conditions under which the disease occurs and under which it spreads\r\nmost rapidly are such as to suggest that it is carried by some parasitic\r\ninsect. On epidemiological grounds the insects most open to suspicion\r\nare the lice, bed-bugs and fleas.\r\n\r\nIn 1909, Nicolle, Comte and Conseil, succeeded in transmitting typhus\r\nfever from infected to healthy monkeys by means of the body louse\r\n(_Pediculus corporis_). Independently of this work, Anderson and\r\nGoldberger had undertaken work along this line in Mexico, and in 1910\r\nreported two attempts to transmit the disease to monkeys by means of\r\nbody lice. The first experiment resulted negatively, but the second\r\nresulted in a slight rise in temperature, and in view of later results\r\nit seems that this was due to infection with typhus.\r\n\r\nShortly after, Ricketts and Wilder (1910) succeeded in transmitting the\r\ndisease to the monkey by the bite of body lice in two experiments, the\r\nlice in one instance deriving their infection from a man and in another\r\nfrom the monkey. Another monkey was infected by typhus through the\r\nintroduction of the feces and abdominal contents of infested lice into\r\nsmall incisions. Experiments with fleas and bed-bugs resulted\r\nnegatively.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, Goldberger and Anderson (1912_b_) indicated that the head\r\nlouse (_Pediculus humanus_) as well, may become infected with typhus. In\r\nan attempt to transmit typhus fever (Mexican virus) from man to monkey\r\nby subcutaneous injection of a saline suspension of crushed head lice,\r\nthe monkeys developed a typical febrile reaction with subsequent\r\nresistance to an inoculation of virulent typhus (Mexican) blood. In one\r\nof the three experiments to transmit the disease from man to monkey by\r\nmeans of the bite of the head louse, the animal bitten by the presumably\r\ninfected head lice proved resistant to two successive immunity tests\r\nwith virulent typhus blood.\r\n\r\nIn 1910, Ricketts and Wilder reported an experiment undertaken with a\r\nview to determining whether the young of infected lice were themselves\r\ninfected. Young lice were reared to maturity on the bodies of typhus\r\npatients, so that if the eggs were susceptible to infection at any stage\r\nof their development, they would have every opportunity of being\r\ninfected within the ovary. The eggs of these infected lice were\r\nobtained, they were incubated, and the young lice of the second\r\ngeneration were placed on a normal rhesus monkey. The experimenters were\r\nunable to keep the monkey under very close observation during the\r\nfollowing three or four weeks, but from the fact that he proved\r\nresistant to a subsequent immunity test they concluded that he probably\r\nowed this immunity to infection by these lice of the second generation.\r\n\r\nAnderson and Goldberger (1912_b_) object that due consideration was not\r\ngiven to the possibility of a variable susceptibility of the monkey to\r\ntyphus. Their similar experiment was \"frankly negative.\"\r\n\r\nProphylaxis against typhus fever is, therefore, primarily a question of\r\nvermin extermination. A brief article by Dr. Goldberger (1914) so\r\nclearly shows the practical application of his work and that of the\r\nother investigators of the subject, that we abstract from it the\r\nfollowing account:\r\n\r\n\"In general terms it may be stated that association with a case of\r\ntyphus fever in the absence of the transmitting insect is no more\r\ndangerous than is association with a case of yellow fever in the absence\r\nof the yellow fever mosquito. Danger threatens only when the insect\r\nappears on the scene.\"\r\n\r\n\"We may say, therefore, that to prevent infection of the individual it\r\nis necessary for him only to avoid being bitten by the louse. In theory\r\nthis may readily be done, for we know that the body louse infests and\r\nattaches itself almost entirely to the body linen, and that boiling\r\nkills this insect and its eggs. Individual prophylaxis is based\r\nessentially, therefore, on the avoidance of contact with individuals\r\nlikely to harbor lice. Practically, however, this is not always as easy\r\nas it may seem, especially under the conditions of such intimate\r\nassociation as is imposed by urban life. Particularly is this the case\r\nin places such as some of the large Mexican cities, where a large\r\nproportion of the population harbors this vermin. Under such\r\ncircumstances it is well to avoid crowds or crowded places, such as\r\npublic markets, crowded streets, or public assemblies at which the\r\n'peon' gathers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Community prophylaxis efficiently and intelligently carried out is,\r\nfrom a certain point of view, probably easier and more effective in\r\nprotecting the individual than is the individual's own effort to guard\r\nhimself. Typhus emphasizes, perhaps better than any other disease, the\r\nfact that fundamentally, sanitation and health are economic problems. In\r\nproportion as the economic condition of the masses has improved--that\r\nis, in proportion as they could afford to keep clean--the notorious\r\nfilth disease has decreased or disappeared. In localities where it still\r\nprevails, its further reduction or complete eradication waits on a\r\nfurther improvement in, or extension of, the improved economic status of\r\nthose afflicted. Economic evolution is very slow process, and, while\r\ndoing what we can to hasten it, we must take such precautions as\r\nexisting conditions permit, looking to a reduction in or complete\r\neradication of the disease.\"\r\n\r\n\"When possible, public bath houses and public wash houses, where the\r\npoor may bathe and do their washings at a minimum or without cost,\r\nshould be provided. Similar provision should be made in military and\r\nconstruction camps. Troops in the field should be given the opportunity\r\nas frequently as possible to wash and _scald_ or _boil_ their body\r\nlinen.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lodging houses, cheap boarding houses, night shelters, hospitals, jails\r\nand prisons, are important factors in the spread and frequently\r\nconstitute foci of the disease. They should receive rigid sanitary\r\nsupervision, including the enforcement of measures to free all inmates\r\nof such institutions of lice on admission.\"\r\n\r\n\"So far as individual foci of the disease are concerned these should be\r\ndealt with by segregating and keeping under observation all exposed\r\nindividuals for 14 days--the period of incubation--from the last\r\nexposure, by disinfecting (boiling or steaming) the suspected bedding,\r\nbody linen, and clothes, for the destruction of any possible vermin that\r\nthey may harbor, and by fumigating (with sulphur) the quarters that they\r\nmay have occupied.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will be noted that nothing has been said as to the disposition of\r\nthe patient. So far as the patient is concerned, he should be removed to\r\n'clean' surroundings, making sure that he does not take with him any\r\nvermin. This may be done by bathing, treating the hair with an\r\ninsecticide (coal oil, tincture of larkspur), and a complete change of\r\nbody linen. Aside from this, the patient may be treated or cared for in\r\na general hospital ward or in a private house, provided the sanitary\r\nofficer is satisfied that the new surroundings to which the patient has\r\nbeen removed are 'clean,' that is, free from vermin. Indeed, it is\r\nreasonably safe to permit a 'clean' patient to remain in his own home if\r\nthis is 'clean,' for, as has already been emphasized, there can be no\r\nspread in the absence of lice. This is a common experience in native\r\nfamilies of the better class and of Europeans in Mexico City.\"\r\n\r\n\"Similarly the sulphur fumigation above prescribed may be dispensed with\r\nas unnecessary in this class of cases.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nSOME POSSIBLE, BUT IMPERFECTLY ESTABLISHED CASES OF ARTHROPOD\r\nTRANSMISSION OF DISEASE\r\n\r\n\r\nINFANTILE PARALYSIS OR ACUTE ANTERIOR POLIOMYELITIS\r\n\r\nThe disease usually known in this country as infantile paralysis or,\r\nmore technically, as acute anterior poliomyelitis, is one which has\r\naroused much attention in recent years.\r\n\r\nThe causative organism of infantile paralysis is unknown, but it has\r\nbeen demonstrated that it belongs to the group of filterable viruses. It\r\ngives rise to a general infection, producing characteristic lesions in\r\nthe central nervous system. The result of the injury to the motor nerves\r\nis a more or less complete paralysis of the corresponding muscle. This\r\nusually manifests itself in the legs and arms. The fatal cases are\r\nusually the result of paralysis of the muscles of respiration. Of the\r\nnon-fatal cases about 60 per cent remain permanently crippled in varying\r\ndegrees.\r\n\r\nThough long known, it was not until about 1890 that it was emphasized\r\nthat the disease occurs in epidemic form. At this time Medin reported\r\nhis observations on an epidemic of forty-three cases which occurred in\r\nand around Stockholm in 1887. Since then, according to Frost (1911),\r\nepidemics have been observed with increasing frequency in various parts\r\nof the world. The largest recorded epidemics have been those in Vermont,\r\n1894, 126 cases; Norway and Sweden, 1905, about 1,500 cases; New York\r\nCity, 1907, about 2,500 cases. Since 1907 many epidemics have been\r\nreported in the United States, and especially in the Northern States\r\neast of the Dakotas. In 1912 there were over 300 cases of the disease in\r\nBuffalo, N. Y., with a mortality of somewhat over 11 per cent.\r\n\r\nIn view of the sudden prominence and the alarming spread of infantile\r\nparalysis, there have been many attempts to determine the cause, and the\r\nmanner in which the disease spreads and develops in epidemic form. In\r\nthe course of these studies, the question of possible transmission by\r\ninsects was naturally suggested.\r\n\r\nC. W. Howard and Clark (1912) presented the results of studies in this\r\nphase of the subject. They dealt especially with the house-fly, bedbug,\r\nhead, and body lice, and mosquitoes. It was found that the house-fly\r\n(_Musca domestica_) can carry the virus of poliomyelitis in an active\r\nstate for several days upon the surface of the body and for several\r\nhours within the gastro-intestinal tract. Mosquitoes and lice were found\r\nnot to take up or maintain the virus. On the other hand, the bedbug\r\n(_Cimex lectularius_) was found to take the virus from the infected\r\nmonkeys and to maintain it in a living state within the body for a\r\nperiod of seven days. This was demonstrated by grinding up in salt\r\nsolution, insects which had fed on poliomyelitic animals and injecting\r\nthe filtrate into a healthy monkey. The experimenters doubted that the\r\nbedbug is a carrier of the virus in nature.\r\n\r\nEarlier in the same year, Brues and Sheppard published the results of an\r\nintensive epidemiological study of the outbreak of 1911, in\r\nMassachusetts. Special attention had been paid to the possibility of\r\ninsect transfer and the following conclusion was reached:\r\n\r\n\"Field work during the past summer together with a consideration of the\r\nepidemiology of the disease so far as known, points strongly toward\r\nbiting flies as possible carriers of the virus. It seems probable that\r\nthe common stable-fly (_Stomoxys calcitrans_ L.) may be responsible to a\r\ncertain extent for the spread of acute epidemic poliomyelitis, possibly\r\naided by other biting flies, such as _Tabanus lineola_. No facts which\r\ndisprove such a hypothesis have as yet been adduced, and experiments\r\nbased upon it are now in progress.\"\r\n\r\nAs stated by Brues (1913), especial suspicion fell upon the stable-fly\r\nbecause:\r\n\r\n1. The blood-sucking habits of the adult fly suit it for the transfer of\r\nvirus present in the blood.\r\n\r\n2. The seasonal abundance of the fly is very closely correlated with the\r\nincidence of the disease, rising rapidly during the summer and reaching\r\na maximum in July and August, then slowly declining in September and\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\n3. The geographical distribution of the fly is, so far as can be\r\nascertained, wider, or at least co-extensive with that of poliomyelitis.\r\n\r\n4. _Stomoxys_ is distinctly more abundant under rural conditions, than\r\nin cities and thickly populated areas.\r\n\r\n5. While the disease spreads over districts quickly and in a rather\r\nerratic way, it often appears to follow along lines of travel, and it is\r\nknown that _Stomoxys_ flies will often follow horses for long distances\r\nalong highways.\r\n\r\n6. In a surprisingly large number of cases, it appeared probable that\r\nthe children affected had been in the habit of frequenting places where\r\n_Stomoxys_ is particularly abundant, i.e., about stables, barnyards,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nThe experiments referred to were carried on during the summer of 1912\r\nand in September Dr. Rosenau announced that the disease was transferred\r\nby the bite of the stable-fly.\r\n\r\nA monkey infected by inoculation was exposed to the bites of upwards of\r\na thousand of the _Stomoxys_ flies daily, by stretching it at full\r\nlength and rolling it in a piece of chicken wire, and then placing it on\r\nthe floor of the cage in which the flies were confined. The flies fed\r\nfreely from the first, as well as later, after paralysis had set in.\r\nAlternating with the inoculated monkey, healthy monkeys were similarly\r\nintroduced into the cage at intervals. New monkeys were inoculated to\r\nkeep a supply of such infected animals and additional healthy ones were\r\nexposed to the flies, which fed willingly and in considerable numbers on\r\neach occasion. \"Thus the flies were given every opportunity to obtain\r\ninfection from the monkeys, since the animals were bitten during\r\npractically every stage of the disease from the time of the inoculation\r\nof the virus till their death following the appearance of paralysis. By\r\nthe same arrangement the healthy monkeys were likely to be bitten by\r\nflies that had previously fed during the various stages of the disease\r\non the infected monkeys. The flies had meanwhile enjoyed the opportunity\r\nof incubating the virus for periods varying from the day or two which\r\nusually elapses between consecutive feedings, to the two or three-week\r\nperiod for which at least some (although a very small percentage) of the\r\nflies lived in the cage.\"\r\n\r\n\"In all, twelve apparently healthy monkeys of a small Japan species were\r\nexposed to the flies in the manner described for the infected monkeys.\r\nSome were placed in the cage only once or twice and others a number of\r\ntimes after varying intervals. These exposures usually lasted for about\r\nhalf an hour, but were sometimes more protracted. No results were\r\napparent until two or three weeks after the experiment was well under\r\nway, and then in rather rapid succession six of the animals developed\r\nsymptoms of poliomyelitis. In three, the disease appeared in a virulent\r\nform, resulting in death, while the other three experienced transient\r\ntremblings, diarrhoea, partial paralysis and recovery.\"--Brues, 1913.\r\n\r\nVery soon after the announcement of the results of experiments by\r\nRosenau and Brues, they were apparently conclusively confirmed by\r\nAnderson and Frost (1912), who repeated the experiments, at Washington.\r\nThey announced that through the bites of the _Stomoxys_ flies that had\r\npreviously fed on infected monkeys, they had succeeded in experimentally\r\ninfecting three healthy monkeys.\r\n\r\nThe results of these experiments gained much publicity and in spite of\r\nthe conservative manner in which they had been announced, it was widely\r\nproclaimed that infantile paralysis was conveyed in nature by the\r\nstable-fly and by it alone.\r\n\r\nSerious doubt was cast on this theory by the results of further\r\nexperiments by Anderson and Frost, reported in May of 1913. Contrary to\r\nthe expectations justified by their first experience, the results of all\r\nthe later, and more extended, experiments were wholly negative. Not once\r\nwere these investigators again able to transmit the infection of\r\npoliomyelitis through _Stomoxys_. They concluded that it was extremely\r\ndoubtful that the insect was an important factor in the natural\r\ntransmission of the disease, not only because of their series of\r\nnegative results, \"but also because recent experiments have afforded\r\nadditional evidence of the direct transmissibility or contagiousness of\r\npoliomyelitis, and because epidemiological studies appear to us to\r\nindicate that the disease is more likely transmitted largely through\r\npassive human virus carriers.\"\r\n\r\nSoon after this, Kling and Levaditi (1913) published their detailed\r\nstudies on acute anterior poliomyelitis. They considered that the\r\nexperiments of Flexner and Clark (and Howard and Clark), who fed\r\nhouse-flies on emulsion of infected spinal cord, were under conditions\r\nso different from what could occur in nature that one could not draw\r\nprecise conclusions from them regarding the epidemiology of the disease.\r\nThey cited the experiments of Josefson (1912), as being under more\r\nreasonable conditions. He sought to determine whether the inoculation of\r\nmonkeys with flies caught in the wards of the Hospital for Contagious\r\nDiseases at Stockholm, where they had been in contact with cases of\r\npoliomyelitis, would produce the disease. The results were completely\r\nnegative.\r\n\r\nKling and Lavaditi made four attempts of this kind. The flies were\r\ncollected in places where poliomyelitics had dwelt, three, four and\r\ntwenty-four after the beginning of the disease in the family and one,\r\nthree, and fifteen days after the patient had left the house. These\r\ninsects were for the greater part living and had certainly been in\r\ncontact with the infected person. In addition, flies were used which had\r\nbeen caught in the wards of the Hospital for Contagious Diseases at\r\nSoderkoping, when numbers of poliomyelitics were confined there.\r\nFinally, to make the conditions as favorable as possible, the emulsions\r\nprepared from these flies were injected without previous filtering,\r\nsince filtration often causes a weakening of the virus. In spite of\r\nthese precautions, all their results were negative, none of the\r\ninoculated animals having contracted poliomyelitis. They also\r\nexperimented with bedbugs which had fed upon infected patients at\r\nvarious stages of the disease, but the results in these cases also were\r\nwholly negative.\r\n\r\nKling and Levaditi considered at length the possibility of transmission\r\nof the disease by _Stomoxys_. As a result of their epidemiological\r\nstudies, they found that infantile paralysis continued to spread in\r\nepidemic form in the dead of winter, when these flies were very rare and\r\ntorpid, or were even completely absent. Numerous cases developed in the\r\nnorthern part of Sweden late in October and November, long after snow\r\nhad fallen. On account of the rarity of the Stomoxys flies during the\r\nperiod of their investigations they were unable to conduct satisfactory\r\nexperiments. In one instance, during a severe epidemic, they found a\r\nnumber of the flies in a stable near a house inhabited by an infected\r\nfamily, though none was found in the house itself. These flies were used\r\nin preparing an emulsion which, after filtering, was injected into the\r\nperitoneal cavity of a monkey. The result was wholly negative.\r\n\r\nAs for the earlier experiments, Kling and Levaditi believe if the flies\r\nwere responsible for the transmission of the disease in the cases\r\nreported by Rosenau and Brues, and the first experiments of Anderson and\r\nFrost, it was because the virus of infantile paralysis is eliminated\r\nwith the nasal secretions of paralyzed monkeys and the flies, becoming\r\ncontaminated, had merely acted as accidental carriers.\r\n\r\nStill further evidence against the hypothesis of the transmission of\r\nacute anterior poliomyelitis by _Stomoxys calcitrans_ was brought\r\nforward by Sawyer and Herms (1913). Special precautions were used to\r\nprevent the transference of saliva or other possibly infectious material\r\nfrom the surface of one monkey to that of another, and to avoid the\r\npossibility of complicating the experiments by introducing other\r\npathogenic organisms from wild flies, only laboratory-bred flies were\r\nused. In a series of seven carefully performed experiments, in which the\r\nconditions were varied, Sawyer and Herms were unable to transmit\r\npoliomyelitis from monkey to monkey through the agency of _Stomoxys_, or\r\nto obtain any indication that the fly is the usual agent for spreading\r\nthe disease in nature.\r\n\r\nThe evidence at hand to date indicates that acute anterior\r\npoliomyelitis, or infantile paralysis, is transmitted by contact with\r\ninfected persons. Under certain conditions insects may be agents in\r\nspreading the disease, but their role is a subordinate one.\r\n\r\n\r\nPellagra\r\n\r\nPELLAGRA is an endemic and epidemic disease characterized by a peculiar\r\neruption or erythema of the skin (figs 144 and 145), digestive\r\ndisturbances and nervous trouble. Insanity is a common result, rather\r\nthan a precursor of the disease. The manifestations of pellagra are\r\nperiodic and its duration indeterminate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 144. Pellagrous eruption on the face. After Watson.]\r\n\r\nThe disease is one the very name of which was almost unknown in the\r\nUnited States until within the past decade. It has usually been regarded\r\nas tropical, though it occurs commonly in Italy and in various parts of\r\nEurope. Now it is known that it not only occurs quite generally in the\r\nUnited States but that it is spreading. Lavinder (1911) says that \"There\r\nare certainly many thousand cases of the disease in this country, and\r\nthe present situation must be looked upon with grave concern.\"\r\n\r\nIt is not within the scope of this book to undertake a general\r\ndiscussion of pellagra. The subject is of such importance to every\r\nmedical man that we cannot do better than refer to Lavinder's valuable\r\nprecis. We can only touch briefly upon the entomological phases of the\r\nproblems presented.\r\n\r\nThe most commonly accepted theories regarding the etiology of the\r\ndisease have attributed it to the use of Indian corn as an article of\r\ndiet. This supposed relationship was explained either on the basis of,\r\n(a) insufficiency of nutriment and inappropriateness of corn as a prime\r\narticle of food; (b) toxicity of corn or, (c) parasitism of certain\r\norganisms--fungi or bacteria--ingested with either sound or deteriorated\r\ncorn.\r\n\r\nIn 1905, Sambon proposed the theory of the protozoal origin of pellagra\r\nand in 1910 he marshalled an imposing array of objections to the theory\r\nthat there existed any relationship between corn and the disease. He\r\npresented clear evidence that pellagra existed in Europe before the\r\nintroduction of Indian corn from America, as an article of diet, and\r\nthat its spread was not _pari passu_ with that of the use of corn. Cases\r\nwere found in which the patients had apparently never used corn, though\r\nthat is obviously difficult to establish. He showed that preventive\r\nmeasures based on the theory had been a failure. Finally, he believed\r\nthat the recurrence of symptoms of the disease for successive springs,\r\nin patients who abstained absolutely from the use of corn, militated\r\nagainst the theory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 145. Pellagrous eruption on the hand. After Watson.]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, Sambon believed that the periodicity of the symptoms,\r\npeculiarities of distribution and seasonal incidence, and analogies of\r\nthe symptoms to those of other parasitic diseases indicated that\r\npellagra was of protozoal origin, and that it was insect-borne.\r\n\r\nThe insect carriers, he believed to be one or more species of Simuliidae,\r\nor black-flies. In support of this he stated that _Simulium_ appears to\r\neffect the same topographical conditions as pellagra, that in its imago\r\nstage it seems to present the same seasonal incidence, that it has a\r\nwide geographical distribution which seems to cover that of pellagra,\r\nand that species of the genus are known to cause severe epizootics.\r\nConcluding from his studies in Italy, that pellagra was limited almost\r\nwholly to agricultural laborers, he pointed out that the Simulium flies\r\nare found only in rural districts, and as a rule do not enter towns,\r\nvillages, or houses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 146. A favorite breeding place of Simulium. Ithaca, N.\r\nY.]\r\n\r\nWhen Sambon's detailed report was published in 1910, his theory was\r\nseized upon everywhere by workers who were anxious to test it and who,\r\nin most cases, were favorably disposed towards it because of the\r\nwonderful progress which had been made in the understanding of other\r\ninsect-borne diseases. In this country, the entomological aspects of the\r\nsubject have been dealt with especially by Forbes (1912), and by King\r\nand Jennings, under the direction of W. D. Hunter, of the Bureau of\r\nEntomology, and in cooperation with the Thompson-McFadden Pellagra\r\nCommission of the Department of Tropical Medicine of the New York\r\nPost-Graduate Medical School. An important series of experiments with\r\nmonkeys has been undertaken by S. J. Hunter, of Kansas, but\r\nunfortunately we have as yet no satisfactory evidence that these animals\r\nare susceptible to the disease--a fact which renders the whole problem\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\nThe accumulated evidence is increasingly opposed to Sambon's hypothesis\r\nof the transmission of pellagra by _Simulium_. This has been so clearly\r\nmanifested in the work of the Thompson-McFadden Commission that we quote\r\nhere from the report by Jennings (1914):\r\n\r\n\"Our studies in 1912 convinced us that there was little evidence to\r\nsupport the incrimination of any species of _Simulium_ in South Carolina\r\nin the transmission of pellagra. Reviewing the group as a whole, we find\r\nthat its species are essentially \"wild\" and lack those habits of\r\nintimate association with man which would be expected in the vector of\r\nsuch a disease as pellagra. Although these flies are excessively\r\nabundant in some parts of their range and are moderately so in\r\nSpartanburg County, man is merely an incidental host, and no disposition\r\nwhatever to seek him out or to invade his domicile seems to be\r\nmanifested. Critically considered, it is nearer the fact that usually\r\nman is attacked only when he invades their habitat.\"\r\n\r\n\"As our knowledge of pellagra accumulates, it is more and more evident\r\nthat its origin is in some way closely associated with the domicile. The\r\npossibility that an insect whose association with man and his immediate\r\nenvironment is, at the best, casual and desultory, can be active in the\r\ncausation of the disease becomes increasingly remote.\"\r\n\r\n\"Our knowledge of the biting habits of _Simulium_ is not complete, but\r\nit is evident, as regards American species at least, that these are\r\nsometimes not constant for the same species in different localities.\r\nCertain species will bite man freely when opportunity offers, while\r\nothers have never been known to attack him. To assume that the proximity\r\nof a _Simulium_-breeding stream necessarily implies that persons in its\r\nvicinity must be attacked and bitten is highly fallacious. In\r\nSpartanburg County attacks by _Simulium_ seems to be confined to the\r\nimmediate vicinity of the breeding-places. Our records and observations,\r\nexceedingly few in number, refer almost exclusively to such locations.\r\nStatements regarding such attacks, secured with much care and\r\ndiscrimination from a large number of persons, including many\r\npellagrins, indicate conclusively that these insects are seldom a pest\r\nof man in this county. A certain number of the persons questioned were\r\nfamiliar with the gnats in other localities, but the majority were\r\nseemingly ignorant of the existence of such flies with biting habits.\r\nThis is especially striking, in view of the fact that the average\r\ndistance of streams from the homes of the pellagra cases studied was\r\nabout 200 yards, many being at a distance of less than 200 yards, and\r\nthat 78 per cent of these streams were found to be infested by larval\r\n_Simulium_. Such ignorance in a large number of persons cannot be\r\noverlooked and indicates strongly that our belief in the negligible\r\ncharacter of local attacks by _Simulium_ is well founded.\"\r\n\r\n\"In localities infested by 'sand-flies,' mosquitoes, etc., these pests\r\nare always well known and the ignorance described above is very\r\nsignificant.\"\r\n\r\n\"Such positive reports as we received nearly always referred to bites\r\nreceived in the open, along streams, etc., and observations made of\r\ntheir attack were of those on field laborers in similar situations.\r\nMales engaged in agricultural pursuits are almost exempt from pellagra\r\nin Spartanburg County. During the season of 1913, in some two or three\r\ninstances, observations were made of the biting of _Simulium_ and some\r\nadditional and entirely creditable reports were received. These\r\nobservations and reports were under conditions identical with those\r\nreferred to in the reports of 1912 and confirm the conclusions based on\r\nthe observations of that year. I would repeat with emphasis that it is\r\ninconceivable that a fly of the appearance and habits of the prevalent\r\nspecies of _Simulium_ could be present in such a region, especially\r\nabout the haunts of man and attack him with sufficient frequency and\r\nregularity to satisfactorily account for so active and prevalent a\r\ndisease as pellagra without being a well-known and recognized pest.\"\r\n\r\n\"In connection with the conditions in the Piedmont region of South\r\nCarolina, it may be well to cite the results of a study of those in the\r\narid region of western Texas.\"\r\n\r\n\"In May, 1913, in company with Capt. J. F. Siler of the\r\nThompson-McFadden Pellagra Commission, I visited the region of which\r\nMidland in Midland County is the center. This region is very dry and\r\ntotally devoid of running water for a long distance in every direction.\r\nThe only natural source of water-supply, a few water holes and ponds,\r\nwere visited and found to be of such a nature that the survival of\r\n_Simulium_, far less its propagation in them, is absolutely impossible.\r\nThe nearest stream affording possibilities as a source of _Simulium_ is\r\n60 miles away, while the average distance of such possibility is not\r\nless than 100 miles.\"\r\n\r\n\"Artificial sources of water-supply were also investigated carefully and\r\nwere found to offer no opportunity for the breeding of _Simulium_.\"\r\n\r\n\"At Midland the histories of five cases of pellagra were obtained, which\r\ngave clear evidence that this place or its immediate vicinity was the\r\npoint of origin. Persons of long residence in the country were\r\nquestioned as to the occurrence of such flies as _Simulium_ and returned\r\nnegative answers. These included a retired cattle owner, who is a man of\r\neducation and a keen observer, an expert veterinarian stationed in the\r\ncountry who has the cattle of the country under constant observation,\r\nand a practical cattle man, manager of a ranch and of wide experience.\r\nThe latter had had experience with 'Buffalo gnats' in other localities\r\n(in the East) and is well acquainted with them. His close personal\r\nsupervision of the cattle under his charge, makes it practically certain\r\nthat he would have discovered these gnats had they been present in the\r\ncountry.\"\r\n\r\n\"At the time the study was made, _Simulium_ was breeding and active in\r\nthe adult state in the vicinity of Dallas, Texas, in the eastern part of\r\nthe state. We have here a region in which cases of pellagra have\r\noriginated, yet in which _Simulium_ does not and cannot breed.\"\r\n\r\nOther possible insect vectors of pellagra have been studied in great\r\ndetail and the available evidence indicates that if _any_ insect plays a\r\nrole in the spread of the disease, _Stomoxys calcitrans_ most nearly\r\nfills the conditions. This conclusion was announced by Jennings and King\r\nin 1912, and has been supported by their subsequent work.\r\n\r\nYet, after all the studies of the past decade, the old belief that\r\npellagra is essentially of dietary origin is gaining ground. Goldberger,\r\nWaring and Willets (1914) of the United States Public Health Service\r\nsummarize their conclusions in the statement, (1) that it is dependent\r\non some yet undetermined fault in a diet in which the animal or\r\nleguminous protein component is disproportionately large and (2) that no\r\npellagra develops in those who _consume_ a mixed, well-balanced, and\r\nvaried diet, such, for example, as that furnished by the Government to\r\nthe enlisted men of the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps.\r\n\r\n\r\nLeprosy\r\n\r\nLEPROSY is a specific, infectious disease due to _Bacillus leprae_, and\r\ncharacterized by the formation of tubercular nodules, ulcerations, and\r\ndisturbances of sensation. In spite of the long time that the disease\r\nhas been known and the dread with which it is regarded, little is known\r\nconcerning the method of transfer of the causative organism or the means\r\nby which it gains access to the human body.\r\n\r\nIt is known that the bacilli are to be found in the tubercles, the scurf\r\nof the skin, nasal secretions, the sputum and, in fact in practically\r\nall the discharges of the leper. Under such conditions it is quite\r\nconceivable that they may be transferred in some instances from diseased\r\nto healthy individuals through the agency of insects and other\r\narthropods. Many attempts have been made to demonstrate this method of\r\nspread of the disease, but with little success.\r\n\r\nOf the suggested insect carriers none seem to meet the conditions better\r\nthan mosquitoes, and there are many suggestions in literature that these\r\ninsects play an important role in the transmission of leprosy. The\r\nliterature has been reviewed and important experimental evidence\r\npresented by Currie (1910). He found that mosquitoes feeding, under\r\nnatural conditions, upon cases of nodular leprosy so rarely, if ever,\r\nimbibe the lepra bacillus that they cannot be regarded as one of the\r\nordinary means of transference of this bacillus from lepers to the skin\r\nof healthy persons. He believes that the reason that mosquitoes that\r\nhave fed on lepers do not contain the lepra bacillus is that when these\r\ninsects feed they insert their proboscis directly into a blood vessel\r\nand thus obtain bacilli-free blood, unmixed with lymph.\r\n\r\nThe same worker undertook to determine whether flies are able to\r\ntransmit leprosy. He experimented with five species found in\r\nHonolulu,--_Musca domestica_, _Sarcophaga pallinervis_, _Sarcophaga\r\nbarbata_, _Volucella obesa_ and an undetermined species of _Lucilia_.\r\nThe experiments with _Musca domestica_ were the most detailed. From\r\nthese experiments he concluded, first, that all of the above-named\r\nflies, when given an opportunity to feed upon leprous fluids, will\r\ncontain the bacilli in their intestinal tracts and feces for several\r\ndays after such feeding. Second, that considering the habits of these\r\nflies, and especially those of _Musca domestica_, it is certain that,\r\ngiven an exposed leprous ulcer, these insects will frequently convey\r\nimmense numbers of lepra bacilli, directly or indirectly, to the skins,\r\nnasal mucosa, and digestive tracts of healthy persons. Additional\r\nevidence along this line has recently been brought forward by Honeij and\r\nParker (1914), who incriminate both _Musca domestica_ and _Stomoxys\r\ncalcitrans_. Whether or not such insect-borne bacilli are capable of\r\ninfecting persons whose skin and mucosa are thus contaminated, Currie\r\nwas unwilling to maintain, but he concludes that until we have more\r\naccurate knowledge on this point, we are justified in regarding these\r\ninsects with grave suspicion of being one of the means of disseminating\r\nleprous infection.\r\n\r\nVarious students of the subject have suggested that bed-bugs may be the\r\ncarriers of leprosy and have determined the presence of acid-fast\r\nbacilli in the intestines of bed-bugs which had fed on leprous patients.\r\nOpposed to this, the careful experiments of Thompson (1913) and of\r\nSkelton and Parkham (1913) have been wholly negative.\r\n\r\nBorrel has recently suggested that _Demodex_, may play a role in\r\nspreading the infection in families. Many other insects and acariens\r\nhave been suggested as possible vectors, but the experimental data are\r\nfew and in no wise conclusive. The most that can be said is that it is\r\nquite possible that under favorable conditions the infection might be\r\nspread by any of the several blood-sucking forms or by house-flies.\r\n\r\n\r\nVerruga peruviana\r\n\r\nVERRUGA PERUVIANA is defined by Castellani and Chalmers as \"a chronic,\r\nendemic, specific, general disorder of unknown origin, not contagious,\r\nbut apparently inoculable, and characterized by an irregular fever\r\nassociated with rheumatoid pains, anemia, followed by granulomatous\r\nswellings in the skin, mucous membranes, and organs of the body.\" It has\r\nbeen generally believed by medical men interested that the comparatively\r\nbenign eruptive verruga is identical with the so-called Oroya, or\r\nCarrion's fever, a malignant type. This view is not supported by the\r\nwork of Strong, Tyzzer and Brues, (1913).\r\n\r\nThe disease is confined to South America and to definitely limited areas\r\nof those countries in which it does occur. It is especially prevalent in\r\nsome parts of Peru.\r\n\r\nThe causative organism and the method of transfer of verruga are\r\nunknown. Castellani and Chalmers pointed out in 1910 that the study of\r\nthe distribution of the disease in Peru would impress one with the\r\nsimilarity to the distribution of the Rocky Mountain fever and would\r\nlead to the conclusion that the aetiological cause must in some way be\r\nassociated with some blood-sucking animal, perhaps an arachnid, and that\r\nthis is supported by the fact that the persons most prone to the\r\ninfection are those who work in the fields.\r\n\r\nMore recently, Townsend (1913), in a series of papers, has maintained\r\nthat verruga and Carrion's disease are identical, and that they are\r\ntransmitted to man by the bites of the Psychodid fly, _Phlebotomus\r\nverrucarum_. He succeeded in producing the eruptive type of the disease\r\nin experimental animals by injecting a physiological salt trituration of\r\nwild Phlebotomus flies. A cebus monkey was exposed from October so to\r\nNovember 6, by chaining him to a tree in the verruga zone, next to a\r\nstone wall from which the flies emerged in large numbers every night.\r\nMiliar eruption began to appear on the orbits November 13 and by\r\nNovember 21, there were a number of typical eruptions, with exudation on\r\nvarious parts of the body exactly like miliar eruptive sores commonly\r\nseen on legs of human cases.\r\n\r\nAn assistant in the verruga work, George E. Nicholson, contracted the\r\neruptive type of the disease, apparently as a result of being bitten by\r\nthe Phlebotomus flies. He had slept in a verruga zone, under a tight\r\nnet. During the night he evidently put his hands in contact with the\r\nnet, for in the morning there were fifty-five unmistakable Phlebotomus\r\nbites on the backs of his hands and wrists.\r\n\r\nTownsend believes that in nature, lizards constitute the reservoir of\r\nthe disease and that it is from them that the Phlebotomus flies receive\r\nthe infection.\r\n\r\n\r\nCancer\r\n\r\nThere are not wanting suggestions that this dread disease is carried, or\r\neven caused, by arthropods. Borrel (1909) stated that he had found mites\r\nof the genus _Demodex_ in carcinoma of the face and of the mammae. He\r\nbelieved that they acted as carriers of the virus.\r\n\r\nSaul (1910) and Dahl (1910) go much further, since they attribute the\r\nproduction of the malignant growth to the presence of mites which Saul\r\nhad found in cancers. These Dahl described as belonging to a new\r\nspecies, which he designated _Tarsonemus hominis_. These findings have\r\nsince been confirmed by several workers. Nevertheless, the presence of\r\nthe mite is so rare that it cannot be regarded as an important factor in\r\nthe causation of the disease. The theory that cancer is caused by an\r\nexternal parasite is given little credence by investigators in this\r\nfield.\r\n\r\n\r\nIN CONCLUSION, it should be noted that the medical and entomological\r\nliterature of the past few years abounds in suggestions, and in\r\nunsupported direct statements that various other diseases are\r\ninsect-borne. Knab (1912) has well said \"Since the discovery that\r\ncertain blood-sucking insects are the secondary hosts of pathogenic\r\nparasites, nearly every insect that sucks blood, whether habitually or\r\noccasionally, has been suspected or considered a possible transmitter of\r\ndisease. No thought seems to have been given to the conditions and the\r\ncharacteristics of the individual species of blood-sucking insects,\r\nwhich make disease transmission possible.\"\r\n\r\nHe points out that \"in order to be a potential transmitter of human\r\nblood-parasites, an insect must be closely associated with man and\r\nnormally have opportunity to suck his blood repeatedly. It is not\r\nsufficient that occasional specimens bite man, as, for example, is the\r\ncase with forest mosquitoes. Although a person may be bitten by a large\r\nnumber of such mosquitoes, the chances that any of these mosquitoes\r\nsurvive to develop the parasites in question, (assuming such development\r\nto be possible), and then find opportunity to bite and infect another\r\nperson, are altogether too remote. Applying this criterion, not only the\r\nmajority of mosquitoes but many other blood-sucking insects, such as\r\nTabanidae and Simuliidae, may be confidently eliminated. Moreover,\r\nthese insects are mostly in evidence only during a brief season, so that\r\nwe have an additional difficulty of a very long interval during which\r\nthere could be no propagation of the disease in question.\" He makes an\r\nexception of tick-borne diseases, where the parasites are directly\r\ntransmitted from the tick host to its offspring and where, for this\r\nreason, the insect remains a potential transmitter for a very long\r\nperiod. He also cites the trypanosome diseases as possible exceptions,\r\nsince the causative organisms apparently thrive in a number of different\r\nvertebrate hosts and may be transmitted from cattle, or wild animals, to\r\nman.\r\n\r\nKnab's article should serve a valuable end in checking irresponsible\r\ntheorizing on the subject of insect transmission of disease.\r\nNevertheless, the principles which he laid down cannot be applied to the\r\ncases of accidental carriage of bacterial diseases, or to those of\r\ndirect inoculation of pyogenic organisms, or of blood parasites such as\r\nthe bacillus of anthrax, or of bubonic plague. Accumulated evidence has\r\njustified the conclusion that certain trypanosomes pathogenic to man are\r\nharbored by wild mammals, and so form an exception. Townsend believes\r\nthat lizards constitute the natural reservoir of verruga; and it seems\r\nprobable that field mice harbor the organism of tsutsugamushi disease.\r\nSuch instances are likely to accumulate as our knowledge of the relation\r\nof arthropods to disease broadens.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nHOMINOXIOUS ARTHROPODS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following synoptic tables are presented in the hope that they may be\r\nof service in giving the reader a perspective of the relationships of\r\nthe Arthropoda in general and enabling him to identify the more\r\nimportant species which have been found noxious to man. Though\r\napplicable chiefly to the arthropods found in the United States, exotic\r\ngenera and species which are concerned in the transmission of disease\r\nare also included. For this reason the keys to the genera of the Muscids\r\nof the world are given. As will be seen, the tables embrace a number of\r\ngroups of species which are not injurious. This was found necessary in\r\norder that the student might not be lead to an erroneous determination\r\nwhich would result were he to attempt to identify a species which\r\nheretofore had not been considered noxious, by means of a key containing\r\nonly the noxious forms. The names printed in BOLD FACED TYPE indicate\r\nthe hominoxious arthropods which have been most commonly mentioned in\r\nliterature.\r\n\r\n\r\nCRUSTACEA\r\n\r\nArthropods having two pairs of antennae which are sometimes modified for\r\ngrasping, and usually with more than five pairs of legs. With but few\r\nexceptions they are aquatic creatures. Representatives are: Crabs,\r\nlobsters, shrimps, crayfish, water-fleas, and woodlice. To this class\r\nbelongs the CYCLOPS (fig. 122) a genus of minute aquatic crustaceans of\r\nwhich at least one species harbors _Dracunculus medinensis_, the Guinea\r\nworm (fig. 121).\r\n\r\n\r\nMYRIAPODA\r\n\r\nElongate, usually vermiform, wingless, terrestrial creatures having one\r\npair of antennae, legs attached to each of the many intermediate body\r\nsegments. This group is divided into two sections, now usually given\r\nclass rank: the DIPLOPODA or millipedes (fig. 13), commonly known as\r\nthousand legs, characterized by having two pairs of legs attached to\r\neach intermediate body segment, and the CHILOPODA or centipedes (fig.\r\n14) having only one pair of legs to each body segment.\r\n\r\n\r\nARACHNIDA\r\n\r\nIn this class the antennae are apparently wanting, wings are never\r\npresent, and the adults are usually provided with four pairs of legs.\r\nScorpions, harvest-men, spiders, mites, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEXAPODA (Insects)\r\n\r\nTrue insects have a single pair of antennae, which is rarely vestigial,\r\nand usually one or two pairs of wings in the adult stage. Familiar\r\nexamples are cockroaches, crickets, grasshoppers, bugs, dragon-flies,\r\nbutterflies, moths, mosquitoes, flies, beetles, ants, bees and wasps.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDERS OF THE ARACHNIDA\r\n\r\na.

The mature mite is not parasitic but\r\n                          the larvae which are very numerous in certain\r\n                          localities will cause intense itching,\r\n                          soreness, and even more serious complications.\r\n                          They burrow beneath the skin and produce\r\n                          inflamed spots. They have received the popular\r\n                          name of \"RED BUG.\" The names LEPTUS AMERICANUS\r\n                          and L. IRRITANS have been applied to them,\r\n                          although they are now known to be immature\r\n                          stages. (Fig. 44.)\r\n\r\n\r\nHEXAPODA (Insecta)\r\n\r\nThe Thysanura (springtails and bristletails), the Neuropteroids\r\n(may-flies, stone-flies, dragon-flies, caddis-flies, etc.), Mallophaga\r\n(bird lice), Physopoda (thrips), Orthoptera (grasshoppers, crickets,\r\nroaches), are of no special interest from our viewpoint. The remaining\r\norders are briefly characterized below.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIPHUNCULATA (page 275)\r\n\r\nMouth parts suctorial; beak fleshy, not jointed; insect wingless;\r\nparasitic upon mammals. Metamorphosis incomplete. Lice.\r\n\r\n\r\nHEMIPTERA (page 275)\r\n\r\nMouth parts suctorial; beak or the sheath of the beak jointed; in the\r\nmature state usually with four wings. In external appearance the\r\nimmature insect resembles the adult except that the immature form (i.e.\r\nnymph) never has wings, the successive instars during the process of\r\ngrowth, therefore, are quite similar; and the metamorphosis is thus\r\nincomplete. To this order belong the true bugs, the plant lice, leaf\r\nhoppers, frog hoppers, cicadas, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEPIDOPTERA\r\n\r\nThe adult insect has the body covered with scales and (with the rare\r\nexception of the females of a few species) with four wings also covered\r\nwith scales. Proboscis, when present, coiled, not segmented, adapted for\r\nsucking. Metamorphosis complete, i.e. the young which hatches from the\r\negg is quite unlike the adult, and after undergoing several molts\r\ntransforms into a quiescent pupa which is frequently enclosed in a\r\ncocoon from which the adult later emerges. The larvae are known as\r\ncaterpillars. Butterflies and moths.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIPTERA (page 285)\r\n\r\nThe adult insect is provided with two, usually transparent, wings, the\r\nsecond pair of wings of other insects being replaced by a pair of\r\nhalteres or balancers. In a few rare species the wings, or halteres, or\r\nboth, are wanting. The mouth parts, which are not segmented, are adapted\r\nfor sucking. The tarsi are five-segmented. Metamorphosis complete. The\r\nlarvae, which are never provided with jointed legs, are variously known\r\nas maggots, or grubs, or wrigglers. Flies, midges, mosquitoes.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIPHONAPTERA (page 316)\r\n\r\nMouth parts adapted for sucking; body naked or with bristles and spines;\r\nprothorax well developed; body compressed; tarsi with five segments;\r\nwings absent.

Crosby who has been working upon certain capsids\r\nstates that he and his assistant have been bitten by LYGUS PRATENSIS,\r\nthe tarnished plant bug, by CHLAMYDATUS ASSOCIATUS and by ORTHOTYLUS\r\nFLAVOSPARSUS, though without serious results.\r\n\r\n[H] Species marked with an * are known to transmit malaria. Species\r\nfound only in tropical North America and not known to carry malaria have\r\nbeen omitted from this table, but all found in the United States are\r\nincluded.\r\n\r\n[I] This table to the North American genera of the Tabanidae is adapted\r\nfrom one given by Miss Ricardo.\r\n\r\n[J] The classification of the Muscoidea as set forth by Schiner and\r\nother earlier writers has long been followed, although it is not\r\nsatisfactory, being admittedly more or less artificial. Within the last\r\ntwo or three decades several schemes have been advanced, that of Brauer\r\nand Bergenstamm and of Girschner, with the modifications of Schnabl and\r\nDziedzicki having obtained most favor in Europe. Townsend, in 1908,\r\nproposed a system which differs from Girschner's in some respects, but\r\nunfortunately it has not yet been published in sufficient detail to\r\npermit us to adopt it. From considerations of expediency we use here the\r\narrangement given in Aldrich's Catalogue of North American Diptera,\r\nthough we have drawn very freely upon Girschner's most excellent paper\r\nfor taxonomic characters to separate the various groups.\r\n\r\nIt may sometimes be found that a species does not agree in all the\r\ncharacters with the synopsis; in this case it must be placed in the\r\ngroup with which it has the most characters in common.\r\n\r\n[K] There are several genera of flies of the family _Cordyluridae_; (i.e.\r\n_Acalyptratae_) which might be placed with the _Anthomyiidae_ (i.e.\r\n_Calyptratae_), owing to the relatively large size of their squamae. As\r\nthere is no single character which will satisfactorily separate all\r\ndoubtful genera of these two groups we must arbitrarily fix the limits.\r\nIn general those forms on the border line having a costal spine, or\r\nlower squama larger than the upper, or the lower surface of the\r\nscutellum more or less pubescent, or the eyes of the male nearly or\r\nquite contiguous, or the eyes hairy, or the frontal setae decussate in\r\nthe female; or any combination of these characters may at once be placed\r\nwith the _Anthomyiidae_. Those forms which lack these characteristics and\r\nhave at least six abdominal segments (the first and second segments\r\nusually being more or less coalescent) are placed with the Acalyptrates.\r\nThere are other acalyptrates with squamae of moderate size which have\r\neither no vibrissae, or have the subcosta either wholly lacking or\r\ncoalescent in large part with R_1 or have spotted wings; they, therefore\r\nwill not be confused with the calyptrates.\r\n\r\n[L] _Pachymyia_ Macq. is closely related to _Stomoxys_. It differs in\r\nhaving the arista rayed both above and below. _P. vexans_, Brazil.\r\n\r\n[M] The genus _Eudasyphora_ Town. has recently been erected to contain\r\n_D. lasiophthalma_.\r\n\r\n[N] _Nitellia_, usually included in this genus has the apical cell\r\npetiolate. _Apollenia_ Bezzi, has recently been separated from\r\n_Pollenia_ to contain the species _P. nudiuscula_. Both genera belong to\r\nthe Eastern hemisphere.\r\n\r\n[O] The following three genera are not sufficiently well defined to\r\nplace in this synopsis. In color and structural characters they are\r\nclosely related to _Cynomyia_ from which they may be distinguished as\r\nfollows. _Catapicephala_ Macq., represented by the species _C.\r\nsplendens_ from Java, has the setae on the facial ridges rising to the\r\nbase of the antennae and has median marginal macrochaetae on the\r\nabdominal segments two to four: _Blepharicnema_ Macq., represented by\r\n_B. splendens_ from Venezuela has bare genae, oral setae not\r\nascending; tibiae villose; claws short in both sexes; _Sarconesia_\r\nBigot with the species _S. chlorogaster_ from Chile, setose genae;\r\nlegs slender, not villose; claws of the male elongate.\r\n\r\n[P] _Plinthomyia_ Rdi. and _Hemigymnochaeta_ Corti are related to\r\n_Ochromyia_, though too briefly described to place in the key.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nHYDROCYANIC ACID GAS AGAINST HOUSEHOLD INSECTS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following directions for fumigating with hydrocyanic acid\r\ngas are taken from Professor Herrick's circular published by the\r\nCornell Reading Course:\r\n\r\nHydrocyanic acid gas has been used successfully against household\r\ninsects and will probably be used more and more in the future.\r\nIt is particularly effective against bed-bugs, and cockroaches, but\r\nbecause _it is such a deadly poison it must be used very carefully_.\r\n\r\nThe gas is generated from the salt potassium cyanid, by treating\r\nit with sulfuric acid diluted with water. Potassium cyanid is a\r\nmost poisonous substance and the gas emanating from it is also\r\ndeadly to most, if not all, forms of animal life. The greatest care\r\nmust always be exercised in fumigating houses or rooms in buildings\r\nthat are occupied. Before fumigation a house should be vacated.\r\nIt is not necessary to move furniture or belongings except brass or\r\nnickel objects, which may be somewhat tarnished, and butter, milk,\r\nand other larder supplies that are likely to absorb gas. If the nickel\r\nand brass fixtures or objects are carefully covered with blankets\r\nthey will usually be sufficiently protected.\r\n\r\nThere may be danger in fumigating one house in a solid row of\r\nhouses if there is a crack in the walls through which the gas may find\r\nits way. It also follows that the fumigation of one room in a house\r\nmay endanger the occupants of an adjoining room if the walls between\r\nthe two rooms are not perfectly tight. It is necessary to keep\r\nall these points in mind and to do the work deliberately and thoughtfully.\r\nThe writer has fumigated a large college dormitory of 253\r\nrooms, once a year for several years, without the slightest accident\r\nof any kind. In order to fumigate this building about 340 pounds\r\nof cyanid and the same amount of sulfuric acid were used each time.\r\nIn addition to this, the writer has fumigated single rooms and smaller\r\nhouses with the gas. In one instance the generating jars were too\r\nsmall; the liquid boiled over and injured the floors and the rugs.\r\nSuch an accident should be avoided by the use of large jars and by\r\nplacing old rugs or a quantity of newspapers beneath the jars.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROPORTIONS OF INGREDIENTS\r\n\r\nExperiments and experience have shown that the potassium\r\ncyanid should be ninety-eight per cent pure in order to give satisfactory\r\nresults. The purchaser should insist on the cyanid being of\r\nat least that purity, and it should be procurable at not more than\r\nforty cents per pound. The crude form of sulfuric acid may be used.\r\nIt is a thickish, brown liquid and should not cost more than four or\r\nfive cents a pound. If a room is made tight, one ounce of cyanid for\r\nevery one hundred cubic feet of space has been shown to be sufficient.\r\nIt is combined with the acid and water in the following proportions:\r\n\r\n  Potassium cyanid                       1 ounce\r\n  Commercial sulfuric acid               1 fluid ounce\r\n  Water                                  3 fluid ounces\r\n\r\n\r\nA SINGLE ROOM AS AN EXAMPLE\r\n\r\nSuppose a room to be 12 by 15 by 8 feet. It will contain 12 x 15 x 8, or\r\n1440 cubic feet. For convenience the writer always works on the basis of\r\ncomplete hundreds; in this case he would work on the basis of 1500 cubic\r\nfeet, and thus be sure to have enough. The foregoing room, then, would\r\nrequire 15 ounces of cyanid, 15 ounces of sulfuric acid, and 45 ounces\r\nof water. The room should be made as tight as possible by stopping all\r\nthe larger openings, such as fireplaces and chimney flues, with old rags\r\nor blankets. Cracks about windows or in other places should be sealed\r\nwith narrow strips of newspaper well soaked in water. Strips of\r\nnewspaper two or three inches wide that have been thoroughly soaked in\r\nwater may be applied quickly and effectively over the cracks around the\r\nwindow sash and elsewhere. Such strips will stick closely for several\r\nhours and may be easily removed at the conclusion of the work.\r\n\r\nWhile the room is being made tight, the ingredients should be measured\r\naccording to the formula already given. The water should be measured and\r\n_poured first_ into a stone jar for holding at least two gallons. The\r\njar should be placed in the middle of the room, with an old rug or\r\nseveral newspapers under it in order to protect the floor.\r\n\r\nThe required amount of sulfuric acid should then be poured rather slowly\r\ninto the water. _This process must never be reversed; that is, the acid\r\nmust never be poured into the jar first._ The cyanid should be weighed\r\nand put into a paper bag beside the jar. All hats, coats, or other\r\narticles that will be needed before the work is over should be removed\r\nfrom the room. When everything is ready the operator should drop the bag\r\nof cyanid gently into the jar, holding his breath, and should walk\r\nquickly out of the room. The steam-like gas does not rise immediately\r\nunder these conditions, and ample time is given for the operator to walk\r\nout and shut the door. If preferred, however, the paper bag may be\r\nsuspended by a string passing through a screw eye in the ceiling and\r\nthen through the keyhole of the door. In this case the bag may be\r\nlowered from the outside after the operator has left the room and closed\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\nThe writer has most often started the fumigation toward evening and left\r\nit going all night, opening the doors in the morning. The work can be\r\ndone, however, at any time during the day and should extend over a\r\nperiod of five or six hours at least. It is said that better results\r\nwill be obtained in a temperature of 70^o F., or above, than at a lower\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the operation the windows and doors may be opened from\r\nthe outside. In the course of two or three hours the gas should be\r\ndissipated enough to allow a person to enter the room without danger.\r\nThe odor of the gas is like that of peach kernels and is easily\r\nrecognized. The room should not be occupied until the odor has\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\n\r\nFUMIGATING A LARGE HOUSE\r\n\r\nThe fumigation of a large house is merely a repetition, in each room and\r\nhall, of the operations already described for a single room. All the\r\nrooms should be made tight, and the proper quantities of water and\r\nsulfuric acid should be measured and poured into jars placed in each\r\nroom with the cyanid in bags besides the jars. When all is ready, the\r\noperator should _go to the top floor and work downward_ because the gas\r\nis lighter than air and tends to rise.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRECAUTIONS\r\n\r\nThe cyanid should be broken up into small pieces not larger than small\r\neggs. This can best be done on a cement or brick pavement. It would be\r\nadvantageous to wear gloves in order to protect the hands, although the\r\nwriter has broken many pounds of cyanid without any protection on the\r\nhands. Wash the hands thoroughly at frequent intervals in order to\r\nremove the cyanid.\r\n\r\nThe operations of the work must be carried out according to directions.\r\n\r\nThe work should be done by a calm, thoughtful and careful person--best\r\nby one who has had some experience.\r\n\r\nConspicuous notices of what has been done should be placed on the doors,\r\nand the doors should be locked so that no one can stray into the rooms.\r\n\r\nThe gas is lighter than air, therefore one should always begin in the\r\nrooms at the top of the house and work down.\r\n\r\nAfter fumigation is over the contents of the jar should be emptied into\r\nthe sewer or some other safe place. The jars should be washed thoroughly\r\nbefore they are used again.\r\n\r\n_It must be remembered that cyanid is a deadly poison_; but it is very\r\nefficient against household insects, if carefully used, and is not\r\nparticularly dangerous when properly handled.\r\n\r\n\r\nLESIONS PRODUCED BY THE BITE OF THE BLACK-FLY\r\n\r\nWhile this text was in press there came to hand an important paper\r\npresenting a phase of the subject of black fly injury so different from\r\nothers heretofore given that we deem it expedient to reproduce here the\r\nauthor's summary. The paper was published in _The Journal of Cutaneous\r\nDiseases_, for November and December, 1914, under the title of \"A\r\nClinical, Pathological and Experimental Study of the Lesions Produced by\r\nthe Bite of the Black Fly (_Simulium venustum_),\" by Dr. John Hinchman\r\nStokes, of the University of Michigan.\r\n\r\n\r\nRESUME AND DISCUSSION OF EXPERIMENTAL FINDINGS\r\n\r\nThe principal positive result of the work has been the experimental\r\nreproduction of the lesion produced by the black-fly in characteristic\r\nhistological detail by the use of preserved flies. The experimental\r\nlesions not only reproduced the pathological pictures, but followed a\r\nclinical course, which in local symptomatology especially, tallied\r\nclosely with that of the bite. This the writer interprets as\r\nsatisfactory evidence that the lesion is not produced by any living\r\ninfective agent. The experiments performed do not identify the nature of\r\nthe toxic agent. Tentatively they seem to bring out, however, the\r\nfollowing characteristics.\r\n\r\n1. The product of alcoholic extraction of flies do not contain the toxic\r\nagent.\r\n\r\n2. The toxic agent is not inactivated by alcohol.\r\n\r\n3. The toxic agent is not destroyed by drying fixed flies.\r\n\r\n4. The toxic agent is not affected by glycerin, but is, if anything,\r\nmore active in pastes made from the ground fly and glycerin, than in the\r\nground flies as such.\r\n\r\n5. The toxic agent is rendered inactive or destroyed by hydrochloric\r\nacid in a concentration of 0.25%.\r\n\r\n6. The toxic agent is most abundant in the region of the anatomical\r\nstructures connected with the biting and salivary apparatus (head and\r\nthorax).\r\n\r\n7. The toxic agent is not affected by a 0.5% solution of sodium\r\nbicarbonate.\r\n\r\n8. The toxic agent is not affected by exposure to dry heat at 100^o C.\r\nfor two hours.\r\n\r\n9. The toxic agent is destroyed or rendered inactive in alkaline\r\nsolution by a typical hydrolytic ferment, pancreatin.\r\n\r\n10. Incomplete experimental evidence suggests that the activity of the\r\ntoxic agent may be heightened by a possible lytic action of the blood\r\nserum of a sensitive individual, and that the sensitive serum itself may\r\ncontain the toxic agent in solution.\r\n\r\nThese results, as far as they go (omitting No. 10), accord with Langer's\r\nexcept on the point of alcoholic solubility and the effect of acids. The\r\nactual nature of the toxic agent in the black-fly is left a matter of\r\nspeculation.\r\n\r\nThe following working theories have suggested themselves to the writer.\r\nFirst, the toxin may be, as Langer believes in the case of the bee, an\r\nalkaloidal base, toxic as such, and neutralized after injection by\r\nantibodies produced for the occasion by the body. In such a case the\r\nview that a partial local fixation of the toxin occurs, which prevents\r\nits immediate diffusion, is acceptable. Through chemotactic action,\r\nspecial cells capable of breaking up the toxin into harmless elements\r\nare attracted to the scene. Their function may be, on the other hand, to\r\nneutralize directly, not by lysis. This would explain the role of the\r\neosinophiles in the black-fly lesion. If their activities be essential\r\nto the destruction or neutralization of the toxin, one would expect them\r\nto be most numerous where there was least reaction. This would be at the\r\nsite of a bite in an immune individual. A point of special interest for\r\nfurther investigation, would be the study of such a lesion.\r\n\r\nSecond, it is conceivable that the injected saliva of the fly does not\r\ncontain an agent toxic as such. It is possible, that like many foreign\r\nproteins, it only becomes toxic when broken down. The completeness and\r\nrapidity of the breaking down depends on the number of eosinophiles\r\npresent. In such a case immunity should again be marked by intense\r\neosinophilia.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 173. Fifth day mature lesion. Lower power drawing showing\r\npapillary oedema and infiltrate in the region of the puncture. After Dr.\r\nJ. H. Stokes]\r\n\r\nThird, lytic agents in the blood serum may play the chief role in the\r\nliberation of the toxic agent from its non-toxic combination. An immune\r\nindividual would then be one whose immunity was not the positive one of\r\nantibody formation, but the negative immunity of failure to metabolize.\r\nAn immune lesion in such a case might be conceived as presenting no\r\neosinophilia, since no toxin is liberated. If the liberation of the\r\ntoxin is dependent upon lytic agents present in the serum rather than in\r\nany cellular elements, a rational explanation would be available for the\r\napparent results (subject to confirmation) of the experiment with\r\nsensitive and immune sera. In this experiment it will be recalled that\r\nthe sensitive serum seemed to bring out the toxicity of the ground\r\nflies, and the serum itself seemed even to contain some of the dissolved\r\nor liberated toxin. The slowness with which a lesion develops in the\r\ncase of the black-fly bite supports the view of the initial lack of\r\ntoxicity of the injected material. The entire absence of early\r\nsubjective symptoms, such as pain, burning, etc., is further evidence\r\nfor this view. It would appear as if no reaction occurred until lysis of\r\nan originally non-toxic substance had begun. Regarding the toxin itself\r\nas the chemotactic agent which attracts eosinophiles, its liberation in\r\nthe lytic process and diffusion through the blood stream attracts the\r\ncells in question to the point at which it is being liberated. Arriving\r\nupon the scene, these cells assist in its neutralization.\r\n\r\nThe last view presented is the one to which the author inclines as the\r\none which most adequately explains the phenomena.\r\n\r\nA fourth view is that the initial injection of a foreign protein by the\r\nfly (i.e., with the first bite) sensitizes the body to that protein. Its\r\nsubsequent injection at any point in the skin gives rise to a local\r\nexpression of systematic sensitization. Such local sensitization\r\nreactions have been described by Arthus and Breton, by Hamburger and\r\nPollack and by Cowie. The description of such a lesion given by the\r\nfirst named authors, in the rabbit, however, does not suggest,\r\nhistopathologically at least, a strong resemblance to that of the\r\nblack-fly. Such an explanation of many insect urticariae deserves further\r\ninvestigation, however, and may align them under cutaneous expressions\r\nof anaphylaxis to a foreign protein injected by the insect. Depending on\r\nthe chemical nature of the protein injected, a specific chemotactic\r\nreaction like eosinophilia may or may not occur. Viewed in this light\r\nthe development of immunity to insect bites assumes a place in the\r\nlarger problem of anaphylaxis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 174. Experimental lesion produced from alcohol-fixed\r\nflies, dried and ground into a paste with glycerin. After Dr. J. H.\r\nStokes]\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMARY\r\n\r\nIn order to bring the results of the foregoing studies together, the\r\nauthor appends the following resume of the clinical data presented in\r\nthe first paper.\r\n\r\nThe black-fly, _Simulium venustum_, inflicts a painless bite, with\r\necchymosis and haemorrhage at the site of puncture. A papulo-vesicular\r\nlesion upon an urticarial base slowly develops, the full course of the\r\nlesion occupying several days to several weeks. Marked differences in\r\nindividual reaction occur, but the typical course involves four stages.\r\nThese are, in chronological order, the papular stage, the vesicular or\r\npseudovesicular, the mature vesico-papular or weeping papular stage and\r\nthe stage of involution terminating in a scar. The papule develops in\r\nfrom 3 to 24 hours. The early pseudovesicle develops in 24 to 48 hours.\r\nThe mature vesico-papular lesion develops by the third to fifth day and\r\nmay last from a few days to three weeks. Involution is marked by\r\ncessation of oozing, subsidence of the papule and scar-like changes at\r\nthe site of the lesion. The symptoms accompanying this cycle consist of\r\nsevere localized or diffused pruritus, with some heat and burning in the\r\nearlier stages if the oedema is marked. The pruritus appears with the\r\npseudovesicular stage and exhibits extraordinary persistence and a\r\nmarked tendency to periodic spontaneous exacerbation. The flies tend to\r\ngroup their bites and confluence of the developing lesions in such cases\r\nmay result in extensive oedema with the formation of oozing and\r\ncrusted plaques. A special tendency on the part of the flies to attack\r\nthe skin about the cheeks, eyes and the neck along the hair line and\r\nbehind the ears, is noted. In these sites inflammation and oedema may\r\nbe extreme.\r\n\r\nA distinctive satellite adenopathy of the cervical glands develops in\r\nthe majority of susceptible persons within 48 hours after being bitten\r\nin the typical sites. This adenopathy is marked, discrete and painful,\r\nthe glands often exquisitely tender on pressure. It subsides without\r\nsuppuration.\r\n\r\nImmunity may be developed to all except the earliest manifestations, by\r\nrepeated exposures. Such an immunity in natives of an infested locality\r\nis usually highly developed. There are also apparently seasonal\r\nvariations in the virulence of the fly and variations in the reaction of\r\nthe same individual to different bites.\r\n\r\nConstitutional effects were not observed but have been reported.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\n\r\nALDRICH, J.
