H. M.\r\n\r\n  CHESTNUT HILL, MASS., 1907.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe lack of definiteness which is at present so general in color\r\nnomenclature, is due in large measure to the failure to appreciate the\r\nfundamental characteristics on which color differences depend. For the\r\nphysicist, the expression of the wave length of any particular light is\r\nin most cases sufficient, but in the great majority of instances where\r\ncolors are referred to, something more than this and something easier of\r\nrealization is essential.\r\n\r\nThe attempt to express color relations by using merely two dimensions,\r\nor two definite characteristics, can never lead to a successful system.\r\nFor this reason alone the system proposed by Mr. Munsell, with its three\r\ndimensions of hue, value, and chroma, is a decided step in advance over\r\nany previous proposition. By means of these three dimensions it is\r\npossible to completely express any particular color, and to\r\ndifferentiate it from colors ordinarily classed as of the same\r\ngeneral character.\r\n\r\nThe expression of the essential characteristics of a color is, however,\r\nnot all that is necessary. There must be some accurate and not too\r\ncomplicated system for duplicating these characteristics, one which\r\nshall not alter with time or place, and which shall be susceptible of\r\neasy and accurate redetermination. From the teaching standpoint also a\r\nlogical and sequential development is absolutely essential. This Mr.\r\nMunsell seems to have most successfully accomplished.\r\n\r\nIn the determination of his relationships he has made use of distinctly\r\nscientific methods, and there seems no reason why his suggestions should\r\nnot lead to an exact and definite system of color essentials. The\r\nMunsell photometer, which is briefly referred to, is an instrument of\r\nwide range, high precision, and great sensitiveness, and permits the\r\nvaluations which are necessary in his system to be accurately made. We\r\nall appreciate the necessity for some improvement in our ideas of color,\r\nand the natural inference is that the training should be begun in early\r\nyouth. The present system in its modified form possesses elements of\r\nsimplicity and attractiveness which should appeal to children, and give\r\nthem almost unconsciously a power of discrimination which would prove of\r\nimmense value in later life. The possibilities in this system are very\r\ngreat, and it has been a privilege to be allowed during the past few\r\nyears to keep in touch with its development. I cannot but feel that we\r\nhave here not only a rational color nomenclature, but also a system of\r\nscientific importance and of practical value.\r\n\r\n    H. E.

It should be borne in mind\r\nthat our climate can be extremely dark, too. Our sitting-room is to be\r\nin varnished wood. The room I have particularly in mind is a sort of bed\r\nand sitting room, pretty large, lit on three sides, and the colour in\r\nfavour of its proprietor at present is a topazy yellow. But then with\r\nwhat colour to relieve it? For a little work-room of my own at the back\r\nI should rather like to see some patterns of unglossy--well, I'll be\r\nhanged if I can describe this red. It's not Turkish, and it's not Roman,\r\nand it's not Indian; but it seems to partake of the last two, and yet it\r\ncan't be either of them, because it ought to be able to go with\r\nvermilion. Ah, what a tangled web we weave! Anyway, with what brains you\r\nhave left choose me and send me some--many--patterns of the exact\r\nshade.\"\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 1: Vailima Letters, Oct. 8, 1902.]\r\n\r\n(1) Where could be found a more delightful cry for some rational way to\r\ndescribe color? He wants \"a topazy yellow\" and a red that is not Turkish\r\nnor Roman nor Indian, but that \"seems to partake of the last two, and\r\nyet it can't be either of them.\" As a cap to the climax comes his demand\r\nfor \"patterns of the exact shade.\" Thus one of the clearest and most\r\nforceful writers of English finds himself unable to describe the color\r\nhe wants. And why? Simply because popular language does not clearly\r\nstate a single one of the three qualities united in every color, and\r\nwhich must be known before one may even hope to convey his color\r\nconceptions to another.\r\n\r\n(2) The incongruous and bizarre nature of our present color names must\r\nappear to any thoughtful person. Baby blue, peacock blue, Nile green,\r\napple green, lemon yellow, straw yellow, rose pink, heliotrope, royal\r\npurple, Magenta, Solferino, plum, and automobile are popular terms,\r\nconveying different ideas to different persons and utterly failing to\r\ndefine colors. The terms used for a single hue, such as pea green, sea\r\ngreen, olive green, grass green, sage green, evergreen, invisible green,\r\nare not to be trusted in ordering a piece of cloth. They invite mistakes\r\nand disappointment. Not only are they inaccurate: they are\r\ninappropriate. Can we imagine musical tones called lark, canary,\r\ncockatoo, crow, cat, dog, or mouse, because they bear some distant\r\nresemblance to the cries of those animals? See paragraph 131.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Color needs a system.+\r\n\r\n(3) Music is equipped with a system by which it defines each sound in\r\nterms of its pitch, intensify, and duration, without dragging in loose\r\nallusions to the endlessly varying sounds of nature. So should color be\r\nsupplied with an appropriate system, based on the hue, value, and\r\nchroma[2] of our sensations, and not attempting to describe them by the\r\nindefinite and varying colors of natural objects. The system now to be\r\nconsidered portrays the three dimensions of color, and measures each by\r\nan appropriate scale. It does not rest upon the whim of an individual,\r\nbut upon physical measurements made possible by special color apparatus.\r\nThe results may be tested by any one who comes to the problem with \"a\r\nclear mind, a good eye, and a fair supply of patience.\"\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 2: See color variables in Glossary.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Clear mental images make clear speech. Vague thoughts find vague\r\nutterance.+\r\n\r\n(4) The child gathers flowers, hoards colored beads, chases butterflies,\r\nand begs for the gaudiest painted toys. At first his strong color\r\nsensations are sufficiently described by the simple terms of red,\r\nyellow, green, blue, and purple. But he soon sees that some are light,\r\nwhile others are dark, and later comes to perceive that each hue has\r\nmany grayer degrees. Now, if he wants to describe a particular\r\nred,--such as that of his faded cap,--he is not content to merely call\r\nit red, since he is aware of other red objects which are very unlike it.\r\nSo he gropes for means to define this particular red; and, having no\r\nstandard of comparison,--no scale by which to estimate,--he hesitatingly\r\nsays it is a \"sort of dull red.\"\r\n\r\n(5) Thus early is he cramped by the poverty of color language. He has\r\nnever been given an appropriate word for this color quality, and has to\r\nborrow one signifying the opposite of sharp, which belongs to edge tools\r\nrather than to colors.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Most color terms are borrowed from other senses.+\r\n\r\n(6) When his older sister refers to the \"tone\" of her green dress, or\r\nspeaks of the \"key of color\" in a picture, he is naturally confused,\r\nbecause tone and key are terms associated in his mind with music. It may\r\nnot be long before he will hear that \"a color note has been pitched too\r\nhigh,\" or that a certain artist \"paints in a minor key.\" All these terms\r\nlead to mixed and indefinite ideas, and leave him unequipped for the\r\nclear expression of color qualities.\r\n\r\n(7) Musical art is not so handicapped. It has an established scale with\r\nmeasured intervals and definite terms. Likewise, coloristic art must\r\nestablish a scale, measure its intervals, and name its qualities in\r\nunmistakable fashion.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Color has three dimensions.+\r\n\r\n(8) It may sound strange to say that color has three dimensions, but it\r\nis easily proved by the fact that each of them can be measured. Thus in\r\nthe case of the boy's faded cap its redness or HUE[3] is determined by\r\none instrument; the amount of light in the red, which is its VALUE,[3]\r\nis found by another instrument; while still a third instrument\r\ndetermines the purity or CHROMA[3] of the red.\r\n\r\nThe omission of any one of these three qualities leaves us in doubt as\r\nto the character of a color, just as truly as the character of this\r\nstudio would remain undefined if the length were omitted and we\r\ndescribed it as 22 feet wide by 14 feet high. The imagination would be\r\nfree to ascribe any length it chose, from 25 to 100 feet. This length\r\nmight be differently conceived by every individual who tried to supply\r\nthe missing factor.\r\n\r\n(9) To illustrate the tri-dimensional nature of colors. Suppose we peel\r\nan orange and divide it in five parts, leaving the sections slightly\r\nconnected below (Fig. 4). Then let us say that all the reds we have ever\r\nseen are gathered in one of the sections, all yellows in another, all\r\ngreens in the third, blues in the fourth, and purples in the fifth. Next\r\nwe will assort these HUES in each section so that the lightest are near\r\nthe top, and grade regularly to the darkest near the bottom. A white\r\nwafer connects all the sections at the top, and a black wafer may be\r\nadded beneath. See Plate I.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 4.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 3: For definitions of Hue, Value, and Chroma, see\r\n    paragraphs 20-23.]\r\n\r\n(10) The fruit is then filled with assorted colors, graded from white to\r\nblack, according to their VALUES, and disposed by their HUES in the five\r\nsections. A slice near the top will uncover light values in all hues,\r\nand a slice near the bottom will find dark values in the same hues.\r\nA slice across the middle discloses a circuit of hues all of MIDDLE\r\nVALUE; that is, midway between the extremes of white and black.\r\n\r\n(11) Two color dimensions are thus shown in the orange, and it remains\r\nto exhibit the third, which is called CHROMA, or strength of color. To\r\ndo this, we have only to take each section in turn, and, without\r\ndisturbing the values already assorted, shove the grayest in toward the\r\nnarrow edge, and grade outward to the purest on the surface. Each slice\r\nacross the fruit still shows the circuit of hues in one uniform value;\r\nbut the strong chromas are at the outside, while grayer and grayer\r\nchromas make a gradation inward to neutral gray at the centre, where all\r\ntrace of color disappears. The thin edges of all sections unite in a\r\nscale of gray from black to white, no matter what hue each contains.\r\n\r\nThe curved outside of each section shows its particular hue graded from\r\nblack to white; and, should the section be cut at right angles to the\r\nthin edge, it would show the third dimension,--chroma,--for the color is\r\ngraded evenly from the surface to neutral gray. A pin stuck in at any\r\npoint traces the third dimension.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 5.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+A color sphere can be used to unite the three dimensions of hue,\r\nvalue, and chroma.+\r\n\r\n(12) Having used the familiar structure of the orange as a help in\r\nclassifying colors, let us substitute a geometric solid, like a\r\nsphere,[4] and make use of geographical terms. The north pole is white.\r\nThe south pole is black. The equator is a circuit of middle reds,\r\nyellows, greens, blues, and purples. Parallels above the equator\r\ndescribe this circuit in lighter values, and parallels below trace it in\r\ndarker values. The vertical axis joining black and white is a neutral\r\nscale of gray values, while perpendiculars to it (like a pin thrust into\r\nthe orange) are scales of chroma. Thus our color notions may be brought\r\ninto an orderly relation by the color sphere. Any color describes its\r\nlight and strength by its location in the solid or on the surface, and\r\nis named by its place in the combined scales of hue, value, and chroma.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 4: See frontispiece.]\r\n\r\n+Two dimensions fail to describe a color.+\r\n\r\n(13) Much of the popular misunderstanding of color is caused by\r\nignorance of these three dimensions or by an attempt to make two\r\ndimensions do the work of three.\r\n\r\n(14) Flat diagrams showing hues and values, but omitting to define\r\nchromas, are as incomplete as would be a map of Switzerland with the\r\nmountains left out, or a harbor chart without indications of the depth\r\nof water. We find by aid of the measuring instruments that pigments are\r\nvery unequal in this third dimension,--chroma,--producing mountains and\r\nvalleys on the color sphere, so that, when the color system is worked\r\nout in pigments and charted, some colors must be traced well out beyond\r\nthe spherical surface (paragraphs 125-127). Indeed, a COLOR TREE[5] is\r\nneeded to display by the unequal levels and lengths of its branches the\r\nindividuality of pigment colors. But, whatever solid or figure is used\r\nto illustrate color relations, it must combine the three scales of hue,\r\nvalue, and chroma, and these definite scales furnish a name for every\r\ncolor based upon its intrinsic qualities, and free from terms purloined\r\nin other sensations, or caught from the fluctuating colors of natural\r\nobjects.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 5: For description of the Color Tree see paragraphs 33\r\n    and 34.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+How this system describes the spectrum.+\r\n\r\n(15) The solar spectrum and rainbow are the most stimulating color\r\nexperiences with which we are acquainted. Can they be described by this\r\nsolid system?\r\n\r\n(16) The lightest part of the spectrum is a narrow field of greenish\r\nyellow, grading into darker red on one side and into darker green upon\r\nthe other, followed by still darker blue and purple. Upon the sphere the\r\nvalues of these spectral colors trace a path high up on the yellow\r\nsection, near white, and slanting downward across the red and green\r\nsections, which are traversed near the level of the equator, it goes on\r\nto cross the blue and purple well down toward black.\r\n\r\n(17) This forms an inclined circuit, crossing the equator at opposite\r\npoints, and suggests the ecliptic or the rings of Saturn (see outside\r\ncover). A pale rainbow would describe a slanting circuit nearer white,\r\nand a dimmer one would fall within the sphere, while an intensely\r\nbrilliant spectrum projects far beyond the surface of the sphere, so\r\ngreatly is the chroma of its hues in excess of the common pigments with\r\nwhich we work out our problems.\r\n\r\n(18) At the outset it is well to recognize the place of the spectrum in\r\nthis system, not only because it is the established basis of scientific\r\nstudy, but especially because the invariable order assumed by its hues\r\nis the only stable hint which Nature affords us in her infinite color\r\nplay.\r\n\r\n(19) All our color sensations are included in the color solid. None are\r\nleft out by its scales of hue, value, and chroma. Indeed, the\r\nimagination is led to conceive and locate still purer colors than any we\r\nnow possess. Such increased degrees of color sensation can be named, and\r\nclearly conveyed by symbols to another person as soon as the system is\r\ncomprehended.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX TO CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Misnomers for Color.+\r\n\r\nThe Century Dictionary helps an intelligent study of color by its clear\r\ndefinitions and cross-references to HUE, VALUE, and CHROMA,--leaving no\r\nexcuse for those who would confuse these three qualities or treat a\r\ndegree of any quality as the quality itself.\r\n\r\nObscure statements were frequent in text-books before these new\r\ndefinitions appeared. Thus the term \"shade\" should be applied only to\r\ndarkened values, and not to hues or chromas. Yet one writer says, \"This\r\nyellow shades into green,\" which is certainly a change of hue, and then\r\nspeaks of \"a brighter shade\" in spite of his evident intention to\r\nsuggest a stronger chroma, which is neither a shade nor brighter\r\nluminosity.\r\n\r\nChildren gain wrong notions of \"tint and shade\" from the so-called\r\nstandard colors shown to them, which present \"tints\" of red and blue\r\nmuch darker than the \"shades\" of yellow. This is bewildering, and, like\r\ntheir elders, they soon drop into the loose habit of calling any degree\r\nof color-strength or color-light a \"shade.\" _Value_ is a better term to\r\ndescribe the light which color reflects to the eye, and all color\r\nvalues, light or dark, are measured by the _value-scale_.\r\n\r\n\"Tone\" is used in a confusing way to mean different things. Thus in the\r\nsame sentence we see it refers to a single touch of the brush,--which is\r\nnot a tone, but a paint spot,--and then we read that the \"tone of the\r\ncanvas is golden.\" This cannot mean that each paint spot is the color of\r\ngold, but is intended to suggest that the various objects depicted seem\r\nenveloped in a yellow atmosphere. Tone is, in fact, a musical term\r\nappropriate to sound, but out of place in color. It seems better to call\r\nthe brush touch a _color-spot_: then the result of an harmonious\r\nrelation between all the spots is _color-envelope_, or, as in Rood, \"the\r\nchromatic composition.\"\r\n\r\n\"Intensity\" is a misleading term, if chroma be intended, for it depends\r\non the relative light of spectral hues. It is a degree rather than a\r\nquality, as appears in the expressions, intense heat, light,\r\nsound,--intensity of stimulus and reaction. Being a degree of many\r\nqualities, it should not be used to describe the quality itself. The\r\nword becomes especially unfit when used to describe two very different\r\nphases of a color,--as its intense illumination, where the chroma is\r\ngreatly weakened, and the strongest chroma which is found in a much\r\nlower value. \"Purity\" is also to be avoided in speaking of pigments, for\r\nnot one of our pigments represents a single pure ray of the spectrum.\r\n\r\nExamples are constantly found of the mental blur caused by such\r\nunfortunate terms, and, since misunderstanding becomes impossible with\r\nmeasured degrees of hue, value, and chroma, it seems only a question of\r\ntime when they will take the place of tint, tone, shade, purity and\r\nintensity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nCOLOR QUALITIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n(20) The three color qualities are hue, value, and chroma.\r\n\r\n\r\n+HUE is the name of a color.+\r\n\r\n(21) Hue is the quality by which we distinguish one color from another,\r\nas a red from a yellow, a green, a blue, or a purple. This names the\r\nhue, but does not tell whether it is light or dark, weak or\r\nstrong,--leaving us in doubt as to its value and its chroma.\r\n\r\nScience attributes this quality to difference in the LENGTH of ether\r\nwaves impinging on the retina, which causes the sensation of color. The\r\nwave length M. 5269 gives a sensation of green, while M. 6867 gives a\r\nsensation of red.[6]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 6: See Glossary for definitions of Micron, Photometer,\r\n    Retina, and Red, also for Hue, Tint, Shade, Value, Color\r\n    Variables, Luminosity, and Chroma.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+VALUE is the light of a color.+\r\n\r\n(22) Value is the quality by which we distinguish a light color from a\r\ndark one. Color values are loosely called tints and shades, but the\r\nterms are frequently misapplied. A tint should be a light value, and a\r\nshade should be darker; but the word \"shade\" has become a general term\r\nfor any sort of color, so that a shade of yellow may prove to be lighter\r\nthan a tint of blue. A photometric[7] scale of value places all colors\r\nin relation to the extremes of white and black, but cannot describe\r\ntheir hue or their chroma.\r\n\r\nScience describes this quality as due to difference in the HEIGHT or\r\namplitude of ether waves impinging on the retina. Small amplitudes of\r\nthe wave lengths given in paragraph 21 produce the sensation of dark\r\ngreen and dark red: larger amplitudes give the sensation of lighter\r\ngreen and lighter red.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 7: See Photometer in paragraph 65.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+CHROMA is the strength of a color.+\r\n\r\n(23) Chroma is the quality by which we distinguish a strong color from a\r\nweak one. To say that a rug is strong in color gives no hint of its hues\r\nor values, only its chromas. Loss of chroma is loosely called fading,\r\nbut this word is frequently used to include changes of value and hue.\r\nTake two autumn leaves, identical in color, and expose one to the\r\nweather, while the other is waxed and pressed in a book. Soon the\r\nexposed leaf fades into a neutral gray, while the protected one\r\npreserves its strong chroma almost intact. If, in fading, the leaf does\r\nnot change its hue or its value, there is only a loss of chroma, but the\r\nfading process is more likely to induce some change of the other two\r\nqualities. Fading, however, cannot define these changes.\r\n\r\nScience describes chroma as the purity of one wave length separated from\r\nall others. Other wave lengths, INTERMINGLING, make its chroma less\r\npure. A beam of daylight can combine all wave lengths in such balance as\r\nto give the sensation of whiteness, because no single wave is in\r\nexcess.[8]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 8: See definition of White in Glossary.]\r\n\r\n(24) The color sphere (see Fig. 1) is a convenient model to illustrate\r\nthese three qualities,--hue, value, and chroma,--and unite them by\r\nmeasured scales.\r\n\r\n(25) The north pole of the color sphere is white, and the south pole\r\nblack. Value or luminosity of colors ranges between these two extremes.\r\nThis is the vertical scale, to be memorized as _V_, the initial for both\r\nvalue and vertical. Vertical movement through color may thus be thought\r\nof as a change of value, but not as a change of hue or of chroma. Hues\r\nof color are spread around the equator of the sphere. This is a\r\nhorizontal scale, memorized as _H_, the initial for both hue and\r\nhorizontal. Horizontal movement around the color solid is thus thought\r\nof as a change of hue, but not of value or of chroma. A line inward from\r\nthe strong surface hues to the neutral gray axis, traces the graying of\r\neach color, which is loss of chroma, and conversely a line beginning\r\nwith neutral gray at the vertical axis, and becoming more and more\r\ncolored until it passes outside the sphere, is a scale of chroma, which\r\nis memorized as _C_, the initial both for chroma and centre. Thus the\r\nsphere lends its three dimensions to color description, and a color\r\napplied anywhere within, without, or on its surface is located and named\r\nby its degree of hue, of value, and of chroma.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+HUES first appeal to the child, VALUES next, and CHROMAS last.+\r\n\r\n(26) Color education begins with ability to recognize and name certain\r\nhues, such as red, yellow, green, blue, and purple (see paragraphs 182\r\nand 183). Nature presents these hues in union with such varieties of\r\nvalue and chroma that, unless there be some standard of comparison, it\r\nis impossible for one person to describe them intelligently to another.\r\n\r\n(27) The solar spectrum forms a basis for scientific color analysis,\r\ntaught in technical schools; but it is quite beyond the comprehension of\r\na child. He needs something more tangible and constantly in view to\r\ntrain his color notions. He needs to handle colors, place them side by\r\nside for comparison, imitate them with crayons, paints, and colored\r\nstuffs, so as to test the growth of perception, and learn by simple yet\r\naccurate terms to describe each by its hue, its value, and its chroma.\r\n\r\n(28) Pigments, rather than the solar spectrum, are the practical agents\r\nof color work. Certain of them, selected and measured by this system\r\n(see Chapter V.), will be known as MIDDLE COLORS, because they stand\r\nmidway in the scales of value and chroma. These middle colors are\r\npreserved in imperishable enamels,[9] so that the child may handle and\r\nfix them in his memory, and thus gain a permanent basis for comparing\r\nall degrees of color. He learns to grade each middle color to its\r\nextremes of value and chroma.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 9: When recognized for the first time, a middle green,\r\n    blue, or purple, is accepted by most persons as well within\r\n    their color habit, but middle red and middle yellow cause\r\n    somewhat of a shock. \"That isn't red,\" they say, \"it's terra\r\n    cotta.\" \"Yellow?\" \"Oh, no, that's--well, it's a very peculiar\r\n    shade.\"\r\n    Yet these are as surely the middle degrees of red and yellow as\r\n    are the more familiar degrees of green, blue, and purple. This\r\n    becomes evident as soon as one accepts physical tests of color\r\n    in place of personal whim. It also opens the mind to a generally\r\n    ignored fact, that middle reds and yellows, instead of the\r\n    screaming red and yellow first given a child, are constantly\r\n    found in examples of rich and beautiful color, such as Persian\r\n    rugs, Japanese prints, and the masterpieces of painting.]\r\n\r\n(29) Experiments with crayons and paints, and efforts to match middle\r\ncolors, train his color sense to finer perceptions. Having learned to\r\nname colors, he compares them with the enamels of middle value, and can\r\ndescribe how light or dark they are. Later he perceives their\r\ndifferences of strength, and, comparing them with the enamels of middle\r\nchroma, can describe how weak or strong they are. Thus the full\r\nsignificance of these middle colors as a practical basis for all color\r\nestimates becomes apparent; and, when at a more advanced stage he\r\nstudies the best examples of decorative color, he will again encounter\r\nthem in the most beautiful products of Oriental art.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Is it possible to define the endless varieties of color?+\r\n\r\n(30) At first glance it would seem almost hopeless to attempt the naming\r\nof every kind and degree of color. But, if all these varieties possess\r\nthe same three qualities, only in different degrees, and if each quality\r\ncan be measured by a scale, then there is a clue to this labyrinth.\r\n\r\n\r\n+A COLOR SPHERE and COLOR TREE to unite hue, value, and chroma.+\r\n\r\n(31) This clue is found in the union of these three qualities by\r\nmeasured scales in a _color sphere and color tree_.[10] The equator of\r\nthe sphere[11] may be divided into ten parts, and serve as the scale of\r\nhue, marked R, YR, Y, GY, G, BG, B, PB, P, and RP. Its vertical axis may\r\nbe divided into ten parts to serve as the scale of value, numbered from\r\nblack (0) to white (10). Any perpendicular to the neutral axis is a\r\nscale of chroma. On the plane of the equator this scale is numbered 1,\r\n2, 3, 4, 5, from the centre to the surface.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 3.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 10: See Color Tree in paragraph 14.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 11: Unaware that the spherical arrangement had been\r\n    used years before, I devised a double tetrahedron to classify\r\n    colors, while a student of painting in 1879. It now appears that\r\n    the sphere was common property with psychologists, having been\r\n    described by Runge in 1810. Earlier still, Lambert had suggested\r\n    a pyramidal form. Both are based on the erroneous assumption\r\n    that red, yellow, and blue are primary sensations, and also fail\r\n    to place these hues in a just scale of luminosity. My twirling\r\n    color solid and its completer development in the present model\r\n    have always made prominent the artistic feeling for color value.\r\n    It differs in this and in other ways from previous systems, and\r\n    is fortunate in possessing new apparatus to measure the degree\r\n    of hue, value, and chroma.]\r\n\r\n(32) This chroma scale may be raised or lowered to any level of value,\r\nalways remaining perpendicular to the axis, and serving to measure the\r\nchroma of every hue at every level of value. The fact that some colors\r\nexceed others to such an extent as to carry them out beyond the sphere\r\nis proved by measuring instruments, but the fact is a new one to many\r\npersons. (Figs. 2 and 3.)\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 2. (See Fig. 20) The Color Tree]\r\n\r\n(33) For this reason the COLOR TREE is a completer model than the\r\nsphere, although the simplicity of the latter makes it best for a\r\nchild's comprehension.\r\n\r\n(34) The color tree is made by taking the vertical axis of the sphere,\r\nwhich carries a scale of value, for the trunk. The branches are at right\r\nangles to the trunk; and, as in the sphere, they carry the scale of\r\nchroma. Colored balls on the branches tell their Hue. In order to show\r\nthe MAXIMA of color, each branch is attached to the trunk (or neutral\r\naxis) at a level demanded by its value,--the yellow nearest white at the\r\ntop, then the green, red, blue, and purple branches, approaching black\r\nin the order of their lower values. It will be remembered that the\r\nchroma of the sphere ceased with 5 at the equator. The color tree\r\nprolongs this through 6, 7, 8, and 9. The branch ends carry colored\r\nballs, representing the most powerful red, yellow, green, blue, and\r\npurple pigments which we now possess, and could be lengthened, should\r\nstronger chromas be discovered.[12]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 12: See Plate I.]\r\n\r\n(35) Such models set up a permanent image of color relations. Every\r\npoint is self-described by its place in the united scales of hue, value,\r\nand chroma. These scales fix each new perception of color in the child's\r\nmind by its situation in the color solid. The importance of such a\r\ndefinite image can hardly be overestimated, for without it one color\r\nsensation tends to efface another. When the child looks at a color, and\r\nhas no basis of comparison, it soon leaves a vague memory that cannot be\r\ndescribed. These models, on the contrary, lead to an intelligent\r\nestimate of each color in terms of its hue, its value, and its chroma;\r\nwhile the permanent enamels correct any personal bias by a definite\r\nstandard.\r\n\r\n(36) Thus defined, a color falls into logical relation with all other\r\ncolors in the system, and is easily memorized, so that its image may be\r\nrecalled at any distance of time or place by the notation.\r\n\r\n(37) These solid models help to memorize and assemble colors and the\r\nmemory is further strengthened by a simple NOTATION, which records each\r\ncolor so that it cannot be mistaken for any other. By these written\r\nscales a child gains an instinctive estimate of relations, so that, when\r\nhe is delighted with a new color combination, its proportions are noted\r\nand understood.\r\n\r\n(38) Musical art has long enjoyed the advantages of a definite scale and\r\nnotation. Should not the art of coloring gain by similar definition? The\r\nmusical scale is not left to personal whim, nor does it change from day\r\nto day; and something as clear and stable would be an advantage in\r\ntraining the color sense.\r\n\r\n(39) Perception of color is crude at first. The child sees only the most\r\nobvious distinctions, and prefers the strongest stimulation. But\r\nperception soon becomes refined by exercise, and, when a child tries to\r\nimitate the subtle colors of nature with paints, he begins to realize\r\nthat the strongest colors are not the most beautiful,--rather the\r\ntempered ones, which may be compared to the moderate sounds in music. To\r\ndescribe these tempered colors, he must estimate their hue, value, and\r\nchroma, and be able to describe in what degree his copy departs from the\r\nnatural color. And, with this gain in perception and imitation of\r\nnatural color, he finds a strong desire to invent combinations to please\r\nhis fancy. Thus the study divides into three related attitudes, which\r\nmay be called recognition, imitation, and invention. Recognition of\r\ncolor is fundamental, but it would be tedious to spend a year or two in\r\nformal and dry exercises to train recognition of color alone; for each\r\nstep in recognition of color is best tested by exercise in its imitation\r\nand arrangement. When perception becomes keener, emphasis can be placed\r\non imitation of the colors found in art and in nature, resting finally\r\non the selection and grouping of colors for design.[13]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 13: See Course of Study, Part II.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+Every color can be recognized, named, matched, imitated, and written\r\nby its HUE, VALUE, and CHROMA.+\r\n\r\n(40) The notation used in this system places Hue (expressed by an\r\ninitial) at the left; Value (expressed by a number) at the right and\r\nabove a line; and Chroma (also expressed by a number) at the right,\r\nbelow the line. Thus R 5/9 means HUE (red), VALUE (5)/CHROMA (9), and\r\nwill be found to represent the qualities of the pigment vermilion.[14]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 14: See Chapter VI.]\r\n\r\nHue, value, and chroma unite in every color sensation, but the child\r\ncannot grasp them all at once. _Hue-difference appeals to him first_,\r\nand he gains a permanent idea of five principal hues from the enamels of\r\nMIDDLE COLORS, learning to name, match, imitate, and finally write them\r\nby their initials: R (red), Y (yellow), G (green), B (blue), and P\r\n(purple). Intermediates formed by uniting successive pairs are also\r\nwritten by the joined initials, YR (yellow-red), GY (green-yellow), BG\r\n(blue-green), PB (purple-blue), and RP (red-purple).\r\n\r\n(41) Ten differences of hue are as many as a child can render at the\r\noutset, yet in matching and imitating them he becomes aware of their\r\nlight and dark quality, and learns to separate it from hue as\r\n_value-difference_. Middle colors, as implied by that name, stand midway\r\nbetween white and black,--that is, on the equator of the sphere,--so\r\nthat a middle red will be written R 5/, suggesting the steps 6, 7, 8,\r\nand 9 which are above the equator, while steps 4, 3, 2, and 1 are below.\r\nIt is well to show only three values of a color at first; for instance,\r\nthe middle value contrasted with a light and a dark one. These are\r\nwritten R 3/, R 5/, R 7/. Soon he perceives and can imitate finer\r\ndifferences, and the red scale may be written entire, as R 1/, R 2/,\r\nR 3/, R 4/, R 5/, R 6/, R 7/, R 8/, R 9/, with black as 0 and white\r\nas 10.\r\n\r\n(42) _Chroma-difference is the third_ and most subtle color quality. The\r\nchild is already unconsciously familiar with the middle chroma of red,\r\nhaving had the enamels of MIDDLE COLOR always in view, and the red\r\nenamel is to be contrasted with the strongest and weakest red chromas\r\nobtainable. These he writes R /1, R /5, R /9, seeing that this describes\r\nthe chromas of red, but leaves out its values. R 5/1, R 5/5, R 5/9, is\r\nthe complete statement, showing that, while both hue and value are\r\nunchanged, the chroma passes from grayish red to middle red (enamel\r\nfirst learned) and out to the strongest red in the chroma scale obtained\r\nby vermilion.\r\n\r\n(43) It may be long before he can imitate the intervening steps of\r\nchroma, many children finding it difficult to express more than five\r\nsteps of the chroma scale, although easily making ten steps of value and\r\nfrom twenty to thirty-five steps of hue. This interesting feature is of\r\npsychologic value, and has been followed in the color tree and color\r\nsphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Does such a scientific scheme leave any outlet for feeling\r\nand personal expression of beauty?+\r\n\r\n(44) Lest this exact attitude in color study should seem inartistic,\r\ncompared with the free and almost chaotic methods in use, let it be said\r\nthat the stage thus far outlined is frankly disciplinary. It is somewhat\r\ndry and unattractive, just as the early musical training is fatiguing\r\nwithout inventive exercises. The child should be encouraged at each step\r\nto exercise his fancy.\r\n\r\n(45) Instead of cramping his outlook upon nature, it widens his grasp of\r\ncolor, and stores the memory with finer differences, supplying more\r\nmaterial by which to express his sense of coloristic beauty.\r\n\r\n(46) Color harmony, as now treated, is a purely personal affair,\r\ndifficult to refer to any clear principles or definite laws. The very\r\nterms by which it seeks expression are borrowed from music, and suggest\r\nvague analogies that fail when put to the test. Color needs a new set of\r\nexpressive terms, appropriate to its qualities, before we can make an\r\nanalysis as to the harmony or discord of our color sensations.\r\n\r\n(47) This need is supplied in the present system by measured CHARTS, and\r\na NOTATION. Their very construction preserves the _balance of colors_,\r\nas will be shown in the next chapter, while the chapter on harmony\r\n(Chapter VII.) shows how harmonious pairs and triads of color may be\r\nfound by MASKS with measured intervals. In fact, practice in the use of\r\nthe charts supplies the imagination with scales and sequences of color\r\nquite as definite and quite as easily written as those sound intervals\r\nby which the musician conveys to others his sense of harmony. And,\r\nalthough in neither art can training alone make the artist, yet a\r\ntechnical grasp of these formal scales gives acquaintance with the full\r\nrange of the instrument, and is indispensable to artistic expression.\r\nFrom these color scales each individual is free to choose combinations\r\nin accord with his feeling for color harmony.\r\n\r\nLet us make an outline of the course of color study traced in the\r\npreceding pages.[15]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 15: _See_ Part II., A Color System and Course of\r\n    Study.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+PERCEPTION of color.+\r\n\r\n(48) _Hue-difference._\r\n\r\n    Middle hues (5 principals).\r\n    Middle hues (5 intermediates).\r\n    Middle hues (10 placed in sequence as SCALE of HUE).\r\n\r\n  _Value-difference._\r\n\r\n    Light, middle, and dark values (without change of hue).\r\n    Light, middle, and dark values (traced with 5 principal hues).\r\n    10 values traced with each hue.

But to range at\r\nrandom in the immense field of color sensations, without plan or\r\ndefinite aim in view, only courts fatigue of the retina and a chaotic\r\nstate of mind.\r\n\r\n(52) The same broad principles which govern the presentation of other\r\nideas apply with equal force in this study. A little, well apprehended,\r\nis better than a mass of undigested facts. If the child is led to\r\ndiscover, or at least to think he is discovering, new things about\r\ncolor, the mind will be kept alert and seek out novel illustrations at\r\nevery step. Now and then a pupil will be found who leads both teacher\r\nand class by _intuitive_ appreciation of color, and it is a subtle\r\nquestion how far such a nature can be helped or hurt by formal\r\nexercises. But such an exception is rare, and goes to prove that\r\nsystematic discipline of the color sense is necessary for most children.\r\n\r\n(53) Outdoor nature and indoor surroundings offer endless color\r\nillustrations. Birds, flowers, minerals, and the objects in daily use\r\ntake on a new interest when their varied colors are brought into a\r\nconscious relation, and clearly named. A tri-dimensional perception,\r\nlike this sense of color, requires skilful training, and each lesson\r\nmust be simplified to the last point practicable. It must not be too\r\nlong, and should lead to some definite result which a child can grasp\r\nand express with tolerable accuracy, while its difficulties should be\r\napproached by easy stages, so as to avoid failure or discouragement. The\r\nsuccess of the present effort is the best incentive to further\r\nachievement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX TO CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nPLATE I.\r\n\r\nTHE COLOR SPHERE, WITH MEASURED SCALES OF HUE, VALUE, AND CHROMA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe teacher of elementary grades introduces these scales of tempered\r\ncolor as fast as the child's interest is awakened to their need by the\r\nexercises shown in Plates II. and III. Thus the Hue scale is learned\r\nbefore the end of the second year, the Value scale during the next two\r\nyears, and the Chroma scale in the fifth year. By the time a child is\r\nten years old these definite color scales have become part of his mental\r\nfurnishing, so that he can name, write, and memorize any color group.\r\n\r\n1. _The Color Sphere in Skeleton._ This diagram shows the middle colors\r\non the equator, with strong red, yellow, green, blue, and purple, each\r\nat its proper level in the value scale, and projecting in accordance\r\nwith its scale of chroma. See the complete description of these scales\r\nin Chapter II.\r\n\r\n2. _The Color Score._ Fifteen typical steps taken from the color sphere\r\nare here spread out in a flat field. The FIVE MIDDLE COLORS form the\r\ncentre level, with the same hues in a lighter value above and in a\r\ndarker value below. Chapter VI. describes the making of this Score, and\r\nits use in analyzing colors and preserving a written record of their\r\ngroups.\r\n\r\n3. _The Value Scale and Chroma Scale._ Each of the five color maxima is\r\nthus shown at its proper level in the scale of light, and graded by\r\nuniform steps from its strongest chroma inward to neutrality at the axis\r\nof the sphere. Pigment inequalities here become very apparent.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PLATE I.\r\n  Copyright 1907 by A. H. Munsell.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  FOR PLATES II. & III.,\r\n\r\n  SEE APPENDIX TO CHAPTER IV.,\r\n  CHILDREN'S COLOR STUDIES.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nCOLOR MIXTURE AND BALANCE.\r\n\r\n\r\n+All colors grasped in the hand.+\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 6.]\r\n\r\n(54) Let us recall the names and order of colors given in the last\r\nchapter, with their assemblage in a sphere by the three qualities of\r\nHUE, VALUE, and CHROMA. It will aid the memory to call the thumb of the\r\nleft hand RED, the forefinger YELLOW, the middle finger GREEN, the ring\r\nfinger BLUE, and the little finger PURPLE (Fig. 6). When the finger tips\r\nare in a circle, they represent a circuit of hues, which has neither\r\nbeginning nor end, for we can start with any finger and trace a sequence\r\nforward or backward. Now close the tips together for white, and imagine\r\nthat the five strong hues have slipped down to the knuckles, where they\r\nstand for the equator of the color Sphere. Still lower down at the wrist\r\nis black.\r\n\r\n(55) The hand thus becomes a color holder, with white at the finger\r\ntips, black at the wrist, strong colors around the outside, and weaker\r\ncolors within the hollow. Each finger is a scale of its own color, with\r\nwhite above and black below, while the graying of all the hues is traced\r\nby imaginary lines which meet in the middle of the hand. Thus a child's\r\nhand may be his substitute for the color sphere, and also make him\r\nrealize that it is filled with grayer degrees of the outside colors, all\r\nof which melt into gray in the centre.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Neighborly and opposite hues; and their mixture.+\r\n\r\n(56) Let this circle (Fig. 7) stand for the equator of the color sphere\r\nwith the five principal hues (written by their initials R, Y, G, B,\r\nand P) spaced evenly about it. Some colors are neighbors, as red and\r\nyellow, while others are opposites. As soon as a child experiments with\r\npaints, he will notice the different results obtained by mixing them.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 7.]\r\n\r\nFirst, the neighbors, that is, any pair which lie next one another, as\r\nred and yellow, will unite to make a hue which retains a suggestion of\r\nboth. It is _intermediate_ between red and yellow, and we call it\r\nYELLOW-RED.[17]\r\n\r\n(57) Green and yellow unite to form GREEN-YELLOW, blue and green make\r\nBLUE-GREEN, and so on with each succeeding pair. These intermediates are\r\nto be written by their initials, and inserted in their proper place\r\nbetween the principal hues. It is as if an orange (paragraph 9) were\r\nsplit into ten sectors instead of five, with red, yellow, green, blue,\r\nand purple as alternate sectors, while half of each adjoining color pair\r\nwere united to form the sector between them. The original order of five\r\nhues is in no wise disturbed, but linked together by five intermediate\r\nsteps.\r\n\r\n(58) Here is a table of the intermediates made by mixing each pair:--\r\n\r\n  Red and yellow unite to form yellow-red (YR), popularly called\r\n    orange.[17]\r\n  Yellow and green unite to form green-yellow (GY), popularly called\r\n    grass green.\r\n  Green and blue unite to form blue-green (BG), popularly called\r\n    peacock blue.\r\n  Blue and purple unite to form purple-blue (PB), popularly called\r\n    violet.\r\n  Purple and red unite to form red-purple (RP), popularly called plum.\r\n\r\nUsing the left hand again to hold colors, the principal hues remain\r\nunchanged on the knuckles, but in the hollows between them are placed\r\nintermediate hues, so that the circle now reads: red, yellow-red,\r\nyellow, green-yellow, green, blue-green, blue, purple-blue, purple, and\r\nred-purple, back to the red with which we started. This circuit is\r\neasily _memorized_, so that the child may begin with any color point,\r\nand repeat the series clock wise (that is, from left to right) or in\r\nreverse order.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 17: Orange is a variable union of yellow and red. See\r\n    Appendix.]\r\n\r\n(59) Each principal hue has thus made two close neighbors by mixing with\r\nthe nearest principal hue on either hand. The neighbors of red are a\r\nyellow-red on one side and a purple-red on the other. The neighbors of\r\ngreen are a green-yellow on one hand and a blue-green on the other. It\r\nis evident that a still closer neighbor could be made by again mixing\r\neach consecutive pair in this circle of ten hues; and, if the process\r\nwere continued long enough, the color steps would become so fine that\r\nthe eye could see only a circuit of hues melting imperceptibly one into\r\nanother.\r\n\r\n(60) But it is better for the child to gain a fixed idea of red, yellow,\r\ngreen, blue, and purple, with their intermediates, before attempting to\r\nmix pigments, and these ten steps are sufficient for primary education.\r\n\r\n(61) Next comes the question of opposites in this circle. A line drawn\r\nfrom red, through the centre, finds its opposite, blue-green.[18] If\r\nthese colors are mixed, they unite to form gray. Indeed, the centre of\r\nthe circle stands for a middle gray, not only because it is the centre\r\nof the neutral axis between black and white, but also because any pair\r\nof opposites will unite to form gray.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 18: Green is often wrongly assigned as the opposite of\r\n    red. See Appendix, on False Color Balance.]\r\n\r\n(62) This is a table of five mixtures which make neutral gray:\r\n\r\n            { Red &    Blue-green   }\r\n            { Yellow   Purple-blue  }\r\n  Opposites { Green    Red-purple   } Each pair of which unites\r\n            { Blue     Yellow-red   }   in neutral gray.\r\n            { Purple   Green-yellow }\r\n\r\n(63) But if, instead of mixing these opposite hues, we place them side\r\nby side, the eye is so stimulated by their difference that each seems to\r\ngain in strength; _i.e._, each _enhances_ the other when separate, but\r\n_destroys_ the other when mixed. This is a very interesting point to be\r\nmore fully illustrated by the help of a color wheel in Chapter V.,\r\nparagraph 106. What we need to remember is that the mixture of\r\nneighborly hues makes them less stimulating to the eye, because they\r\nresemble each other, while a mixture of opposite hues extinguishes both\r\nin a neutral gray.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Hues once removed, and their mixture.+\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 8.]\r\n\r\n(64) There remains the question, What will happen if we mix, not two\r\nneighbors, nor two opposites, but _a pair of hues once removed in the\r\ncircle_, such as red and green? A line joining this pair does not pass\r\nthrough the neutral centre, but to one side nearer yellow, which shows\r\nthat this mixture falls between neutral gray and yellow, partaking\r\nsomewhat of each. In the same way a line joining yellow and blue shows\r\nthat their mixture contains both green and gray. Indeed, a line joining\r\nany two colors in the circuit may be said to describe their union.\r\nA radius crossing this line passes to some hue on the circumference, and\r\ndescribes by its intersection with the first line the chroma of the\r\ncolor made by a mixture of the two original colors.\r\n\r\n  Red  &  Green make Yellow-gray }\r\n  Yellow  Blue       Green-gray  } Each pair unites in a _colored_\r\n  Green   Purple     Blue-gray   } gray, which is an intermediate hue\r\n  Blue    Red        Purple-gray } of weak chroma.\r\n  Purple  Yellow     Red-gray    }\r\n\r\n\r\n+Mixture of white and black: a scale of grays.+\r\n\r\n(65) So far we have thought only of the plane of the equator, with its\r\ncircle of middle hues in ten steps, and studied their mixture by drawing\r\nlines to join them. Now let us start at the neutral centre, and think\r\nupward to white and downward to black (Fig. 9.)\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 9.]\r\n\r\nThis vertical line is the _neutral axis_ joining the poles of white and\r\nblack, which represent the opposites of light and darkness. Middle gray\r\nis half-way between. If black is called 0, and white is 10, then the\r\nmiddle point is 5, with 6, 7, 8, and 9 above, while 4, 3, 2, and 1 are\r\nbelow, thus making a vertical scale of grays from black to white\r\n(Chapter II., paragraph 25).\r\n\r\nIf left to personal preference, an estimate of middle value will vary\r\nwith each individual who attempts to make it. This appears in the\r\nneutral scales already published for schools, and students who depend\r\nupon them, discover a variation of over 10 per cent. in the selection of\r\nmiddle gray. Since this VALUE SCALE underlies all color work, it needs\r\naccurate adjustment by scientific means, as in scales of sound, of\r\nlength, of weight, or of temperature.\r\n\r\nA PHOTOMETER (_photo_, light, and _meter_, a measure)[19] is shown on\r\nthe next page. It measures the relative amount of light which the eye\r\nreceives from any source, and so enables us to make a scale with any\r\nnumber of regular steps. The principle on which it acts is very simple.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 19: Adopted in Course on Optical Measurements at the\r\n    Massachusetts Institute of Technology. Instruments have also\r\n    been made for the Harvard Medical School, the Treasury\r\n    Department in Washington, and various private laboratories.]\r\n\r\nA rectangular box, divided by a central partition into halves, has\r\nsymmetrical openings in the front walls, which permit the light to reach\r\ntwo white fields placed upon the back walls. If one looks in through the\r\nobservation tube, both halves are seen to be exactly alike, and the\r\nwhite fields equally illuminated. A valve is then fitted to one of the\r\nfront openings, so that the light in that half of the photometer may be\r\ngradually diminished. Its white field is thus darkened by measured\r\ndegrees, and becomes black when all light is excluded by the closed\r\nvalve. While this darkening process goes on in one-half of the\r\ninstrument, the white field in the other half does not change, and,\r\nlooking into the eyepiece, the observer sees each step contrasted with\r\nthe original white. One-half is thus said to be _variable_ because of\r\nits valve, and the other side is said to be _fixed_. A dial connected\r\nwith the valve has a hand moving over it to show how much light is\r\nadmitted to the field in the variable half.\r\n\r\nLet us now test one of these personal decisions about middle value.\r\nA sample replaces the white field in the fixed half, and by means of the\r\nvalve, the white field in the variable half is alternately darkened and\r\nlightened, until it matches the sample and the eye sees no difference in\r\nthe two. The dial then discloses the fact that this supposedly MIDDLE\r\nVALUE reflects only 42 per cent. of the light; that is to say, it is\r\nnearly a whole step too low in a decimal scale. Other samples err nearly\r\nas far on the light side of middle value, and further tests prove not\r\nonly the varying color sensitiveness of individuals, but detect a\r\ndifference between the left and right eye of the same person.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PHOTOMETER.\r\n  Back View. Front View.]\r\n\r\nThe vagaries of color estimate thus disclosed, lead some to seek shelter\r\nin \"feeling and inspiration\"; but feeling and inspiration are\r\ntemperamental, and have nothing to do with the simple facts of vision.\r\nA measured and unchanging scale is as necessary and valuable in the\r\ntraining of the eye as the musical scale in the discipline of the ear.\r\n\r\nIt will soon be necessary to talk of the values in each color. We may\r\ndistinguish the values on the neutral axis from color values by writing\r\nthem N1, N2, N3, N4, N5, N6, N7, N8, N9, N10. Such a scale makes it easy\r\nto foresee the result of mixing light values with dark ones. Any two\r\ngray values unite to form a gray midway between them. Thus N4 and N6\r\nbeing equally above and below the centre, unite to form N5, as will also\r\nN7 and N3, N8 and N2, or N9 and N1. But N9 and N3 will unite to form N6,\r\nwhich is midway between 6 and 9.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Vertical Section through light openings.\r\n\r\n  PARTS.\r\n\r\n  _C_, CABINET, with sample-holder (H) and mirror (M), which may be\r\n  removed and stored to left of dial (D) when instrument is closed\r\n  for transportation.\r\n  _D_, DIAL: records color values in terms of standard white (100),\r\n  the opposite end of the scale being absolute blackness (0).\r\n  _E_, EYE-PIECE: to shield eye and sample from extraneous light while\r\n  color determinations are being made.

Thus R7 (popularly called a tint of red) is\r\nneither lighter nor darker than the gray of N7. A numeral written above\r\nto the right always indicates _value_, whether of a gray or a color, so\r\nthat R1, R2, R3, R4, R5, R6, R7, R8, R9, describes a regular scale of\r\nred values from black to white, while G1, G2, G3, etc., is a scale of\r\ngreen values.\r\n\r\n(67) This matter of a notation for colors will be more fully worked out\r\nin Chapter VI., but the letters and numerals already described greatly\r\nsimplify what we are about to consider in the mixture and balance of\r\ncolors.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Mixture of light hues with dark hues.+\r\n\r\n(68) Now that we are supplied with a decimal scale of grays, represented\r\nby divisions of the neutral axis (N1, N2, etc.), and a corresponding\r\ndecimal scale of value for each of the ten hues ranged about the equator\r\n(R1, R2,-- YR1, YR2,-- Y1, Y2,-- GY1, GY2,-- and so on), traced by ten\r\nequidistant meridians from black to white, it is not difficult to\r\nforesee what the mixture of any two colors will produce, whether they\r\nare of the same level of value, as in the colors of the equator already\r\nconsidered, or whether they are of different levels.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 10.]\r\n\r\n(69) For instance, let us mix a light yellow (Y7) with a dark red (R3).\r\nThey are neighbors in hue, but well removed in value. A line joining\r\nthem centres at YR5. This describes the result of their mixture,--a\r\nvalue intermediate between 7 and 3, with a hue intermediate between R\r\nand Y. It is a yellow-red of middle value, popularly called \"dark\r\norange.\" But, while this term \"dark orange\" rarely means the same color\r\nto three different people, these measured scales give to YR5 an\r\nunmistakable meaning, just as the musical scale gives an unmistakable\r\nsignificance to the notes of its score.\r\n\r\n(70) Evidently, this way of writing colors by their degrees of value and\r\nhue gives clearness to what would otherwise be hard to express by the\r\ncolor terms in common use.\r\n\r\n(71) If Y9 and R5 be chosen for mixture, we know at once that they unite\r\nin YR7, which is two steps of the value scale above the middle; while Y6\r\nand R2 make YR4, which is one step below the middle. Charts prepared\r\nwith this system show each of these colors and their mixture with\r\nexactness.\r\n\r\n(72) The foregoing mixtures of dark reds and light yellows are typical\r\nof the union of light and dark values of any neighboring hues, such as\r\nyellow and green, green and blue, blue and purple, or purple and red.\r\nNext let us think of the result of mixing different values in opposite\r\nhues; as, for instance, YR7 and B3 (Fig. 11). To this combination the\r\ncolor sphere gives a ready answer; for the middle of a straight line\r\nthrough the sphere, and joining them, coincides with the neutral centre,\r\nshowing that they _balance in neutral gray_. This is also true of any\r\nopposite pair of surface hues where the values are equally removed from\r\nthe equator.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 11.]\r\n\r\n(73) Suppose we substitute familiar flowers for the notation, then YR7\r\nbecomes the buttercup, and B3 is the wild violet. But, in comparing the\r\ntwo, the eye is more stimulated by the buttercup than by the violet, not\r\nalone because it is lighter, but because it is stronger in chroma; that\r\nis, farther away from the neutral axis of the sphere, and in fact out\r\nbeyond its surface, as shown in Fig. 11.\r\n\r\nThe head of a pin stuck in toward the axis on the 7th level of YR may\r\nrepresent the 9th step in the scale of chroma, such as the buttercup,\r\nwhile the \"modest\" violet with a chroma of only 4, is shown by its\r\nposition to be nearer the neutral axis than the brilliant buttercup by\r\nfive steps of chroma. This is the third dimension of color, and must be\r\nincluded in our notation. So we write the buttercup YR 7/9 and the\r\nviolet B 3/4,--chroma always being written below to the right of hue,\r\nand value always above. (This is the invariable order: HUE\r\n{VALUE/CHROMA}.)\r\n\r\n(74) A line joining the head of the pin mentioned above with B 3/4 does\r\nnot pass through the centre of the sphere, and its middle point is\r\nnearer the buttercup than the neutral axis, showing that the hues of the\r\nbuttercup and violet _do not balance in gray_.\r\n\r\n\r\n+The neutral centre is a balancing point for colors.+\r\n\r\n(75) This raises the question, What is balance of color? Artists\r\ncriticise the color schemes of paintings as being \"too light or too\r\ndark\" (unbalanced in value), \"too weak or too strong\" (unbalanced in\r\nchroma), and \"too hot or too cold\" (unbalanced in hue), showing that\r\nthis is a fundamental idea underlying all color arrangements.\r\n\r\n(76) Let us assume that the centre of the sphere is the natural\r\nbalancing point for all colors (which will be best shown by Maxwell\r\ndiscs in Chapter V., paragraphs 106-112), then color points equally\r\nremoved from the centre must balance one another. Thus white balances\r\nblack. Lighter red balances darker blue-green. Middle red balances\r\nmiddle blue-green. In short, every straight line through this centre\r\nindicates opposite qualities that balance one another. The color points\r\nso found are said to be \"_complementary_,\" for each supplies what is\r\nneeded to complement or balance the other in hue, value, and chroma.\r\n\r\n(77) The true complement of the buttercup, then, is not the violet,\r\nwhich is too weak in chroma to balance its strong opposite. We have no\r\nblue flower that can equal the chroma of the buttercup. Some other means\r\nmust be found to produce a balance. One way is to use more of the weaker\r\ncolor. Thus we can make a bunch of buttercups and violets, using twice\r\nas many of the latter, so that the eye sees an _area_ of blue twice as\r\ngreat as the _area_ of yellow-red. Area as a compensation for\r\ninequalities of hue, value, and chroma will be further described under\r\nthe harmony of color in Chapter VII.\r\n\r\n(78) But, before leaving this illustration of the buttercup and violet,\r\nit is well to consider another color path connecting them which does not\r\npass through the sphere, _but around it_ (Fig. 12). Such a path swinging\r\naround from yellow-red to blue slants downward in value, and passes\r\nthrough yellow, green-yellow, green, and blue-green, tracing a _sequence\r\nof hue_, of which each step is less chromatic than its predecessor.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 12.]\r\n\r\nThis diminishing sequence is easily written thus,--YR 8/9, Y 7/8,\r\nGY 6/7, G 5/6, BG 4/5, B 3/4,--and is shown graphically in Fig. 12. Its\r\nhue sequence is described by the initials YR, Y, GY, G, BG, and B. Its\r\nvalue-sequence appears in the upper numerals, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, and 3,\r\nwhile the chroma-sequence is included in the lower numerals, 9, 8, 7, 6,\r\n5, and 4. This gives a complete statement of the sequence, defining its\r\npeculiarity, that at each change of hue there is a regular decrease of\r\nvalue and chroma. Nature seems to be partial to this sequence,\r\nconstantly reiterating it in yellow flowers with their darker green\r\nleaves and underlying shadows. In spring time she may contract its\r\nrange, making the blue more green and the yellow less red, but in autumn\r\nshe seems to widen the range, presenting strong contrasts of yellow-red\r\nand purple-blue.\r\n\r\n(79) Every day she plays upon the values of this sequence, from the\r\nstrong contrasts of light and shadow at noon to the hardly perceptible\r\ndifferences at twilight. The chroma of this sequence expands during the\r\nsummer to strong colors, and contracts in winter to grays. Indeed,\r\nNature, who would seem to be the source of our notions of color harmony,\r\nrarely repeats herself, yet is endlessly balancing inequalities of hue,\r\nvalue, and chroma by compensations of quantity.\r\n\r\n(80) So subtle is this equilibrium that it is taken for granted and\r\nforgotten, except when some violent disturbance disarranges it, such as\r\nan earthquake or a thunder-storm.\r\n\r\n\r\n+The triple nature of color balance illustrated.+\r\n\r\n(81) The simplest idea of balance is the equilibrium of two halves of a\r\nstick supported at its middle point. If one end is heavier than the\r\nother, the support must be moved nearer to that end.\r\n\r\nBut, since color unites three qualities, we must seek some type of\r\n_triple balance_. The game of jackstraws illustrates this, when the\r\ndisturbance of one piece involves the displacement of two others. The\r\naction of three children on a floating plank or the equilibrium of two\r\nacrobats carried on the shoulders of a third may also serve as examples.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 14.]\r\n\r\n(82) Triple balance may be graphically shown by three discs in contact.\r\nTwo of them are suspended by their centres, while they remain in touch\r\nwith a third supported on a pivot, as in Fig. 14. Let us call the lowest\r\ndisc Hue (H), and the lateral discs Value (V) and Chroma (C). Any dip or\r\nrotation of the lower disc H will induce sympathetic action in the two\r\nlateral discs V and C. When H is inclined, both V and C change their\r\nrelations to it. If H is raised vertically, both V and C dip outward. If\r\nH is rotated, both V and C rotate, but in opposite directions. Indeed,\r\nany disturbance of V affects H and C, while H and V respond to any\r\nmovement of C. So we must be prepared to realize that any change of one\r\ncolor quality involves readjustment of the other two.\r\n\r\n(83) Color balance soon leads to a study of optics in one direction, to\r\næsthetics in another, and to mathematical proportions in a third, and\r\nany attempt at an easy solution of its problems is not likely to\r\nsucceed. It is a very complicated question, whose closest counterpart is\r\nto be sought in musical rhythms. The fall of musical impulses upon the\r\near can make us gay or sad, and there are color groups which, acting\r\nthrough the eye, can convey pleasure or pain to the mind.\r\n\r\n(84) A colorist is keenly alive to these feelings of satisfaction or\r\nannoyance, and consciously or unconsciously he rejects certain\r\ncombinations of color and accepts others. Successful pictures and\r\ndecorative schemes are due to some sort of balance uniting \"light and\r\nshade\" (value), \"warmth and coolness\" (hue), with \"brilliancy and\r\ngrayness\" (chroma); for, when they fail to please, the mind at once\r\nbegins to search for the unbalanced quality, and complains that the\r\ncolor is \"too hot,\" \"too dark,\" or \"too crude.\" This effort to establish\r\npleasing proportions may be unconscious in one temperament, while it\r\nbecomes a matter of definite analysis in another. Emerson claimed that\r\nthe unconscious only is complete. We gladly permit those whose color\r\ninstinct is unerring--(and how few they are!)--to neglect all rules and\r\nset formulas. But education is concerned with the many who have not this\r\ngift.\r\n\r\n(85) Any real progress in color education must come not from a blind\r\nimitation of past successes, but by a study into the laws which they\r\nexemplify. To exactly copy fine Japanese prints or Persian rugs or\r\nRenaissance tapestries, while it cultivates an appreciation of their\r\nrefinements, does not give one the power to create things equally\r\nbeautiful. The masterpieces of music correctly rendered do not of\r\nnecessity make a composer. The musician, besides the study of\r\nmasterpieces, absorbs the science of counterpoint, and records by an\r\nunmistakable notation the exact character of any new combination of\r\nmusical intervals which he conceives.\r\n\r\n(86) So must the art of the colorist be furnished with a scientific\r\nbasis and a clear form of color notation. This will record the successes\r\nand failures of the past, and aid in a search, by contrast and analysis,\r\nfor the fundamentals of color balance. Without a measured and systematic\r\nnotation, attempts to describe color harmony only produce hazy\r\ngeneralities of little value in describing our sensations, and fail to\r\nexpress the essential differences between \"good\" and \"bad\" color.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX TO CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nFALSE COLOR BALANCE. There is a widely accepted error that red, yellow,\r\nand blue are \"primary,\" although Brewster's theory was long ago dropped\r\nwhen the elements of color vision proved to be RED, GREEN, and\r\nVIOLET-BLUE. The late Professor Rood called attention to this in\r\nChapters VIII.-XI. of his book, \"Modern Chromatics,\" which appeared in\r\n1879. Yet we find it very generally taught in school. Nor does the harm\r\nend there, for placing red, yellow, and blue equidistant in a circle,\r\nwith orange, green, and purple as intermediates, the teacher goes on to\r\nstate that opposite hues are complementary.\r\n\r\n  Red is thus made the complement of Green,\r\n  Yellow        \"          \"         Purple, and\r\n  Blue          \"          \"         Orange.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, each of these statements is wrong, and, if tested by the\r\nmixture of colored lights or with Maxwell's rotating discs, their\r\nfalsity is evident.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that green is not the complement of red, nor\r\npurple of yellow, nor orange of blue, for neither one of these pairs\r\nunites as it should in a balanced neutrality, and a total test of the\r\ncircle gives great excess of orange, showing that red and yellow usurp\r\ntoo great a portion of the circumference. Starting from a false basis,\r\nthe Brewster theory can only lead to unbalanced and inharmonious effects\r\nof color.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental color sensations are RED, GREEN, and VIOLET-BLUE.\r\n\r\n  RED has for its true complement BLUE-GREEN,\r\n  GREEN            \"        \"     RED-PURPLE, and\r\n  VIOLET-BLUE      \"        \"     YELLOW,\r\n\r\nall of the hues in the right-hand column being compound sensations. The\r\nsensation of green is not due to a mixture of yellow and blue, as the\r\nabsorptive action of pigments might lead one to think: GREEN IS\r\nFUNDAMENTAL, and not made by mixing any hues of the spectrum, while\r\nYELLOW IS NOT FUNDAMENTAL, but caused by the mingled sensations of red\r\nand green. This is easily proved by a controlled spectrum, for all\r\nyellow-reds, yellows, and green-yellows can be matched by certain\r\nproportions of red and green light, all blue-greens, blues, and\r\npurple-blues can be obtained by the union of green and violet light,\r\nwhile purple-blue, purple, and red-purple result from the union of\r\nviolet and red light. But there is no point where a mixture gives red,\r\ngreen, or violet-blue. They are the true primaries, whose mixtures\r\nproduce all other hues.\r\n\r\nStudio and school-room practice still cling to the discredited theory,\r\nclaiming that, if it fails to describe our color sensations, yet it may\r\nbe called practically true of pigments, because a red, yellow, and blue\r\npigment suffice to imitate most natural colors. This discrepancy between\r\npigment mixture and retinal mixture becomes clear as soon as one learns\r\nthe physical make-up and behavior of paints.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n            { Vermilion\r\n  Spectra   {\r\n            { Em. Green\r\n  P. B. G. Y. R.]\r\n\r\nSpectral analysis shows that no pigment is a pure example of the\r\ndominant hue which it sends to the eye. Take, for example, the very\r\nchromatic pigments representing red and green, such as vermilion and\r\nemerald green. If each emitted a single pure hue free from trace of any\r\nother hue, then their mixture would appear yellow, as when spectral red\r\nand green unite. But, instead of yellow, their mixture produces a warm\r\ngray, called brown or \"dull salmon,\" and this is to be inferred from\r\ntheir spectra, where it is seen that vermilion emits some green and\r\npurple as well as its dominant color, while the green also sends some\r\nblue and red light to the eye.[20]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 20: See Rood, Chapter VII., on Color by Absorption.]\r\n\r\nThus stray hues from other parts of the spectrum tend to neutralize the\r\nyellow sensation, which would be strong if each of the pigments were\r\npure in the spectral sense. Pigment absorption affects all palette\r\nmixtures, and, failing to obtain a satisfactory yellow by mixture of red\r\nand green, painters use original yellow pigments,--such as aureolin,\r\ncadmium, and lead chromate,--each of them also impure but giving a\r\ndominant sensation of yellow. Did the eye discriminate, as does the ear\r\nwhen it analyzes the separate tones of a chord, then we should recognize\r\nthat yellow pigments emit both red and green rays.\r\n\r\nWhite light dispersed into a colored band by one prism, may have the\r\nprocess reversed by a second prism, so that the eye sees again only\r\nwhite light. But this would not be so, did not the balance of red,\r\ngreen, and violet-blue sensations remain undisturbed. All our ideas of\r\ncolor harmony are based upon this fundamental relation, and, if pigments\r\nare to render harmonious effects, we must learn to control their\r\nimpurities so as to preserve a balance of red, green, and violet-blue.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, the excessive chroma and value of red and yellow pigments so\r\noverwhelm the lesser degrees of green and blue pigments that no balance\r\nis possible, and the colorist of fine perception must reject not alone\r\nthe theoretical, but also the practical outcome of a \"red-yellow-blue\"\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\nSome of the points raised in this discussion are rather subtle for\r\nstudents, and may well be left until they arise in a study of optics,\r\nbut the teacher should grasp them clearly, so as not to be led into\r\nfalse statements about primary and complementary hues.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nPRISMATIC COLOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Pure color is seen in the spectrum of sunlight.+\r\n\r\n(87) The strongest sensation of color is gained in a darkened room, with\r\na prism used to split a beam of sunlight into its various wave lengths.\r\nThrough a narrow slit there enters a straight pencil of light which we\r\nare accustomed to think of as _white_, although it is a bundle of\r\nvariously colored rays (or waves of ether) whose union and balance is so\r\nperfect that no single ray predominates.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 13.]\r\n\r\n(88) Cover the narrow slit, and we are plunged in darkness. Admit the\r\nbeam, and the eye feels a powerful contrast between the spot of light on\r\nthe floor and its surrounding darkness. Place a triangular glass prism\r\nnear the slit to intercept the beam of white light, and suddenly there\r\nappears on the opposite wall a band of brilliant colors. This delightful\r\nexperiment rivets the eye by the beauty and purity of its hues. All\r\nother colors seem weak by comparison.\r\n\r\nTheir weakness is due to impurity, for all pigments and dyes reflect\r\nportions of hues other than their dominant one, which tend to \"gray\" and\r\ndiminish their chroma.\r\n\r\n(89) But prismatic color is pure, or very nearly so, because the shape\r\nof the glass refracts each hue, and separates it by the length of its\r\nether wave. These waves have been measured, and science can name each\r\nhue by its wave length. Thus a certain red is known as M. 6867, and a\r\ncertain green sensation is M. 5269.[21] Without attempting any\r\nscientific analysis of color, let it be said that Sir Isaac Newton made\r\nhis series of experiments in 1687, and was privileged to name this color\r\nsequence by seven steps which he called red, orange, yellow, green,\r\nblue, violet, and indigo. Later a scientist named Fraunhofer discovered\r\nfine black lines crossing the solar spectrum, and marked them with\r\nletters of the alphabet from a to h. These with the wave length serve to\r\nlocate every hue and define every step in the sequence. Since Newton's\r\ntime it has been proved that only three of the spectral hues are\r\n_primary_; viz., a red, a green, and a violet-blue, while their mixture\r\nproduces all other gradations. By receiving the spectrum on an opaque\r\nscreen with fine slits that fit the red and green waves, so that they\r\nalone pass through, these two primary hues can be received on mirrors\r\ninclined at such an angle as to unite on another screen, where, instead\r\nof red or green, the eye sees only yellow.[22]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 21: See Micron in Glossary.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 22: The fact that the spectral union of red and green\r\n    makes yellow is a matter of surprise to practical workers in\r\n    color who are familiar with the action of pigments, but\r\n    unfamiliar with spectrum analysis. Yellow seems to them a\r\n    primary and indispensable color, because it cannot be made by\r\n    the union of red and green pigments. Another surprise is\r\n    awaiting them when they hear that the yellow and blue of the\r\n    spectrum make _white_, for all their experience with paints goes\r\n    to prove that yellow and blue unite to form green. Attention is\r\n    called to this difference between the mixture of colored light\r\n    and of colored pigments, not with the idea of explaining it\r\n    here, but to emphasize their difference; for in the next chapter\r\n    we shall describe the practical making of a color sphere with\r\n    pigments, which would be quite impractical, could we have only\r\n    the colors of the spectrum to work with. See Appendix to\r\n    preceding chapter.]\r\n\r\n(90) A similar arrangement of slits and mirrors for the green and\r\nviolet-blue proves that they unite to make blue, while a third\r\nexperiment shows that the red and violet-blue can unite to make purple.\r\nSo yellow, blue-green, and purple are called secondary hues because they\r\nresult from the mixture of the three primaries, red, green, and\r\nviolet-blue.\r\n\r\nIn comparing these two color lists, we see that the \"indigo\" and\r\n\"orange\" of Sir Isaac Newton have been discarded. Both are indefinite,\r\nand refer to variable products of the vegetable kingdom. Violet is also\r\nborrowed from the same kingdom; and, in order to describe a violet, we\r\nsay it is a purple violet or blue violet, as the case may be, just as we\r\ndescribe an orange as a red orange or a yellow orange. Their color\r\ndifference is not expressed by the terms \"orange\" or \"violet,\" but by\r\nthe words \"red,\" \"yellow,\" \"blue,\" or \"purple,\" all of which are true\r\ncolor names and arouse an unmixed color image.\r\n\r\n(91) In the nursery a child learns to use the simple color names red,\r\nyellow, green, blue, and purple. When familiarity with the color sphere\r\nmakes him relate them to each other and place them between black and\r\nwhite by their degree of light and strength, there will be no occasion\r\nto revert to vegetables, animals, minerals, or the ever-varying hues of\r\nsea and sky to express his color sensations.\r\n\r\n(92) Another experiment accentuates the difference between spectral and\r\npigment color. When the spectrum is spread on the screen by the use of a\r\nprism, and a second prism is placed inverted beyond the first, it\r\nregathers the dispersed rays back into their original beam, making a\r\nwhite spot on the floor. This proves that all the colored rays of light\r\ncombine to balance each other in whiteness. But if pigments which are\r\nthe closest possible imitation of these hues are united on a painter's\r\npalette, either by the brush or the knife, they _make gray, and not\r\nwhite_.\r\n\r\n(93) This is another illustration of the behavior of pigments, for,\r\ninstead of uniting to form white, they form gray, which is a darkened or\r\nimpure form of white; and, lest this should be attributed to a chemical\r\nreaction between the various matters that serve as pigments, the\r\nexperiment can be carried out without allowing one pigment to touch\r\nanother by using Maxwell discs, as will be shown in the next chapter.\r\n\r\n(94) Before leaving these prismatic colors, let us study them in the\r\nlight of what has already been learned of color dimensions. Not only do\r\nthey present different values, but also different chromas. Their values\r\nrange from darkness at each end, where red and purple become visible, to\r\na brightness in the greenish yellow, which is almost white. So on the\r\ncolor tree described in Chapter II., paragraph 34, yellow has the\r\nhighest branch, green is lower, red is below the middle, with blue and\r\npurple lower down, near black.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 15.]\r\n\r\n(95) Then in chroma they range from the powerful stimulation of the red\r\nto the soothing purple, with green occupying an intermediate step. This\r\nis also given on the color tree by the length of its branches.\r\n\r\n(96) In Fig. 15 the vertical curve describes the values of the spectrum\r\nas they grade from red through yellow, green, blue, and purple. The\r\nhorizontal curve describes the chromas of the spectrum in the same\r\nsequence; while the third curve leaning outward is obtained by uniting\r\nthe first two by two planes at right angles to one another, and sums up\r\nthe three qualities by a single descriptive line. Now the red and purple\r\nends are far apart, and science forbids their junction because of their\r\ngreat difference in wave length. But the mind is prone to unite them in\r\norder to produce the red-purples which we see in clouds at sunset, in\r\nflowers and grapes and the amethyst. Indeed, it has been done\r\nunhesitatingly in most color schemes in order to supply the opposite of\r\ngreen.\r\n\r\n(97) This gives a slanting circuit joining all the branch ends of the\r\ncolor tree, and has been likened to the rings of Saturn in Chapter I.,\r\nparagraph 17.\r\n\r\n\r\n+A prismatic color sphere.+\r\n\r\n(98) With a little effort of the imagination we can picture a prismatic\r\ncolor sphere, using only the colors of light. In a cylindrical chamber\r\nis hung a diaphanous ball similar to a huge soap bubble, which can\r\ndisplay color on its surface without obscuring its interior. Then, at\r\nthe proper points of the surrounding wall, three pure beams of colored\r\nlight are admitted,--one red, another green, and the third violet-blue.\r\n\r\n(99) They fall at proper levels on three sides of the sphere, while\r\ntheir intermediate gradations encircle the sphere with a complete\r\nspectrum plus the needed purple. As they penetrate the sphere, they\r\nunite to balance each other in neutrality. Pure whiteness is at the top,\r\nand, by some imaginary means their light gradually diminishes until they\r\ndisappear in darkness below.\r\n\r\n(100) This ideal color system is impossible in the present state of our\r\nknowledge and implements. Even were it possible, its immaterial hues\r\ncould not serve to dye materials or paint pictures. Pigments are, and\r\nwill in all probability continue to be, the practical agents of\r\ncoloristic productions, however reluctant the scientist may be to accept\r\nthem as the basis of a color system. It is true that they are chemically\r\nimpure and imperfectly represent the colors of light. Some of them fade\r\nrapidly and undergo chemical change, as in the notable case of a green\r\npigment tested by this measured system, which in a few weeks lost four\r\nsteps of chroma, gained two steps of value, and swung into a bluer hue.\r\n\r\n(101) But the color sphere to be next described is worked out with a few\r\nreliable pigments, mostly natural earths, whose fading is a matter of\r\nyears and so slight as to be almost imperceptible. Besides, its\r\nprincipal hues are preserved in safe keeping by imperishable enamels,\r\nwhich can be used to correct any tendency of the pigments to distort the\r\nmeasured intervals of the color sphere.\r\n\r\nThis meets the most serious objection to a pigment system. Without it a\r\nchild has nothing tangible which he can keep in constant view to imitate\r\nand memorize. With it he builds up a mental image of measured relations\r\nthat describe every color in nature, including the fleeting hues of the\r\nrainbow, although they appear but for a moment at rare intervals.\r\nFinally, it furnishes a simple notation which records every color\r\nsensation by a letter and two numerals. With the enlargement of his\r\nmental power he will unite these in a comprehensive grasp of the larger\r\nrelations of color.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX TO CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Children's Color Studies.+\r\n\r\nThese reproductions of children's work are given as proof that color\r\ncharm and good taste may be cultivated from the start.\r\n\r\nFIVE MIDDLE HUES are first taught by the use of special crayons, and\r\nlater with water colors. They represent the equator of the color sphere\r\n(see Plate I.),--a circle midway between the extremes of color-light and\r\ncolor-strength,--and are known as MIDDLE RED, MIDDLE YELLOW, MIDDLE\r\nGREEN, MIDDLE BLUE, and MIDDLE PURPLE.\r\n\r\nThese are starting-points for training the eye to measure regular scales\r\nof Value and Chroma.[23] Only with such a trained judgment is it safe to\r\nundertake the use of strong colors.[24]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 23: See Century Dictionary for definition of chroma.\r\n    Under the word \"color\" will be found definitions of Primary,\r\n    Complementary, Constants (chroma, luminosity, and hue), and the\r\n    Young-Helmholtz theory of color-sensation.]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 24: It must not be assumed because so much stress is\r\n    laid upon quiet and harmonious color that this system excludes\r\n    the more powerful degrees. To do so would forfeit its claim to\r\n    completeness. A Color Atlas in preparation displays all known\r\n    degrees of pigment color arranged in measured scales of Hue,\r\n    Value, and Chroma.]\r\n\r\n_Beginners should avoid Strong Color._ Extreme red, yellow, and blue are\r\ndiscordant. (They \"shriek\" and \"swear.\" Mark Twain calls Roxana's gown\r\n\"a volcanic eruption of infernal splendors.\") Yet there are some who\r\nclaim that the child craves them, and must have them to produce a\r\nthrill. So also does he crave candies, matches, and the carving-knife.\r\nHe covets the trumpet, fire-gong, and bass-drum for their \"thrill\"; but\r\nwho would think them necessary to the musical training of the ear? Like\r\nthe blazing bill-board and the circus wagon, they may be suffered\r\nout-of-doors; but such boisterous sounds and color sprees are unfit for\r\nthe school-room.\r\n\r\n_Quiet Color is the Mark of Good Taste._ Refinement in dress and the\r\nfurnishings of the home is attractive, but we shrink from those who are\r\n\"loud\" in their speech or their clothing. If we wish our children to\r\nbecome well-bred, is it logical to begin by encouraging barbarous\r\ntastes? Their young minds are very open to suggestion. They quickly\r\nadopt our standards, and the blame must fall upon us if they acquire\r\ncrude color habits. Yellow journalism and rag-time tunes will not help\r\ntheir taste in speech or song, nor will violent hues improve their taste\r\nin matters of color.\r\n\r\n_Balance of Color is to be sought._ Artists and decorators are well\r\naware of a fact that slowly dawns upon the student; namely, that color\r\nharmony is due to the preservation of a subtle balance and impossible by\r\nthe use of extremes. This balance of color resides more _within_ the\r\nspherical surface of this system than in the excessive chromas which\r\nproject beyond. It is futile to encourage children in efforts to rival\r\nthe poppy or buttercup, even with the strongest pigments obtainable.\r\nTheir sunlit points give pleasure because they are surrounded and\r\nbalanced by blue ether and wide green fields. Were these conditions\r\nreversed, so that the flowers appeared as little spots of blue or green\r\nin great fields of blazing red, orange, and yellow, our pained eyes\r\nwould be shut in disgust.\r\n\r\nThe painter knows that pigments _cannot_ rival the brilliancy of the\r\nbuttercup and poppy, enhanced by their surroundings. What is more, he\r\ndoes not care to attempt it. Nor does the musician wish to imitate the\r\nscreech of a siren or the explosion of a gun. These are not subjects for\r\nart. Harmonious sounds are the study of the musician, and tuned colors\r\nare the materials of the colorist. Corot in landscape, and Titian,\r\nVelasquez, and Whistler in figure painting, show us that Nature's\r\nrichest effects and most beautiful color are enveloped in an atmosphere\r\nof gray.\r\n\r\n_Beauty of Color lies in Tempered Relations._ Music rarely touches the\r\nextreme range of sound, and harmonious color rarely uses the extremes of\r\ncolor-light or color-strength. Regular scales in the middle register are\r\nfirst given to train the ear, and so should the eye be first\r\nfamiliarized with medium degrees of color.\r\n\r\nThis system provides measured scales, established by special\r\ninstruments, and is able to select the middle points of red, yellow,\r\ngreen, blue, and purple as a basis for comparing and relating all\r\ncolors. These five middle colors form a Chromatic Tuning Fork. (See page\r\n70.) It is far better that children should first become familiar with\r\nthese tuned color intervals which are harmonious in themselves rather\r\nthan begin by blundering among unrelated degrees of harsh and violent\r\ncolor. Who would think of teaching the musical scale with a piano out\r\nof tune?\r\n\r\n_The Tuning of Color cannot be left to Personal Whim._ The wide\r\ndiscrepancies of red, yellow, and blue, which have been falsely taught\r\nas primary colors, can no more be tuned by a child than the musical\r\nnovice can tune his instrument. Each of these hues has three variable\r\nfactors (see page 14, paragraph 14), and scientific tests are necessary\r\nto measure and relate their uneven degrees of Hue, Value, and Chroma.\r\n\r\nVisual estimates of color, without the help of any standard for\r\ncomparison, are continually distorted by doubt, guess-work, and the\r\nfatigue of the eye. Hardly two persons can agree in the intelligible\r\ndescription of color. Not only do individuals differ, but the same eye\r\nwill vary in its estimates from day to day. A frequent assumption that\r\nall strong pigments are equal in chroma, is far from the truth, and\r\ninvolves beginners in many mishaps. Thus the strongest blue-green,\r\nchromium sesquioxide, is but half the chroma of its red complement, the\r\nsulphuret of mercury. Yet ignorance is constantly leading to their\r\nunbalanced use. Indeed, some are still unaware that they are the\r\ncomplements of each other.[25]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 25: See Appendix to Chapter III.]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that the fundamental scales of Hue, Value, and Chroma must\r\nbe established by scientific measures, not by personal bias. This system\r\nis unique in the possession of such scales, made possible by the\r\ndevising of special instruments for the measurement of color, and can\r\ntherefore be trusted as a permanent basis for training the color sense.\r\n\r\nThe examples in Plates II. and III. show how successfully the tuned\r\ncrayons, cards, and water colors of this system lead a child to fine\r\nappreciations of color harmony.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE II.\r\n\r\nCOLOR STUDIES WITH TUNED CRAYONS IN THE LOWER GRADES.\r\n\r\nChildren have made every example on this plate, with no other material\r\nthan the five crayons of middle hue, tempered with gray and black.\r\nA Color Sphere is always kept in the room for reference, and five color\r\nballs to match the five middle hues are placed in the hands of the\r\nyoungest pupils. Starting with these middle points in the scales of\r\nValue and Chroma, they learn to estimate rightly all lighter and darker\r\nvalues, all weaker and stronger chromas, and gradually build up a\r\ndisciplined judgment of color.\r\n\r\nEach study can be made the basis of many variations by a simple change\r\nof one color element, as suggested in the text.\r\n\r\n  1. Butterfly. Yellow and black crayon. Vary by using any single\r\n  crayon with black.\r\n\r\n  2. Dish. Red crayon, blue and green crayons for back and foreground.\r\n  Vary by using the two opposites of any color chosen for the dish and\r\n  omitting the two neighboring colors. See No. 4.\r\n\r\n  3. Hiawatha's canoe. Yellow crayon, with rim and name in green. Vary\r\n  color of canoe, keeping the rim a neighboring color. See No. 4.\r\n\r\n  4. Color-circle. Gray crayon for centre, and five crayons spaced\r\n  equidistant. This gives the invariable order, red, yellow, green,\r\n  blue, purple. _Never use all five in a single design._ Either use\r\n  a color and its two neighbors or a color and its two opposites. By\r\n  mingling touches of any two neighbors, the intermediates are made\r\n  and named yellow-red (orange), green-yellow, blue-green, purple-blue\r\n  (violet), and red-purple. Abbreviated, the circle reads R, YR, Y,\r\n  GY, G, BG, B, PB, P, RP.\r\n\r\n  5. Rosette. Red cross in centre, green leaves: blue field, black\r\n  outline. Vary as in No. 2.\r\n\r\n  6. Rosette. Green centre and edge of leaves, purple field and black\r\n  accents. Vary color of centre, keeping field two colors distant.\r\n\r\n  7. Plaid. Use any three crayons with black. Vary the trio.\r\n\r\n  8. Folding screen. Yellow field (lightly applied), green and black\r\n  edge. Make lighter and darker values of each color, and arrange in\r\n  scales graded from black to white.\r\n\r\n  9. Rug. Light red field with solid red centre, border pattern and\r\n  edges of gray. This is called self-color. Change to each of the\r\n  crayons.\r\n\r\n  10. Rug. Light yellow field and solid centre, with purple and black\r\n  in border design. Vary by change of ground, keeping design two\r\n  colors distant and darkened with black.\r\n\r\n  11. Lattice. Yellow with black: alternate green and blue lozenges.\r\n  Vary by keeping the lozenges of two neighboring colors, but one\r\n  color removed from that of the lattice.\r\n\r\nFor principles involved in these color groups, see Chapter III.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLATE III.\r\n\r\nCOLOR STUDIES WITH TUNED WATER COLORS IN THE UPPER GRADES.\r\n\r\nPrevious work with measured scales, made by the tuned crayons and tested\r\nby reference to the color sphere, have so trained the color judgment\r\nthat children may now be trusted with more flexible material. They have\r\nmemorized the equable degrees of color on the equator of the sphere, and\r\nfound how lighter colors may balance darker colors, how small areas of\r\nstronger chroma may be balanced by larger masses of weaker chroma, and\r\nin general gained a disciplined color sense. Definite impressions and\r\nclear thinking have taken the place of guess-work and blundering.\r\n\r\nThus, before reaching the secondary school, they are put in possession\r\nof the color faculty by a system and notation similar to that which was\r\ndevised centuries ago for the musical sense. No system, however logical,\r\nwill produce the artist, but every artist needs some systematic training\r\nat the outset, and this simple method by measured scales is believed to\r\nbe the best yet devised.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: PLATE 2.\r\n  Copyright 1907 by A.

Munsell]\r\n\r\nEach example on this plate may be made the basis of many variants, by\r\nsmall changes in the color steps, as suggested in the text, and further\r\nelaborated in Chapter VI. Indeed, the studies reproduced on Plates II.\r\nand III. are but a handful among hundreds of pleasing results produced\r\nin a single school.[26]\r\n\r\n  1. Pattern.

Wall decoration. Frieze pattern made of cat-tails and\r\n  leaves,--the leaves of blue-green with black, tails of yellow-red\r\n  with black, and ground of the two colors united and thinned with\r\n  water. Wall of blue-green, slightly grayed by additions of the two\r\n  colors in the frieze. Dado could be a match of the cat-tails\r\n  slightly grayer. _See Fig. 23, page 82._\r\n\r\n  7. Group. Foreground in purple-blue, grayed with black.

First a colorless globe, mounted\r\nso as to spin freely on its axis. Then a measured scale of value,\r\nspecially devised for this purpose, obtained by the daylight\r\nphotometer.[28] Next a set of carefully chosen pigments, whose\r\nreasonable permanence has been tested by long use, and which are\r\nprepared so that they will not glisten when spread on the surface of the\r\nglobe, but give a uniformly mat surface. A glass palette, palette knife,\r\nand some fine brushes complete the list.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 28: See paragraph 65.]\r\n\r\n(104) Here is a list of the paints arranged in pairs to represent the\r\nfive sets of opposite hues described in Chapter III., paragraphs\r\n61-63:--\r\n\r\n  _Color Pairs._    _Pigments Used._      _Chemical Nature._\r\n\r\n  Red and           Venetian red.         Calcined native earth.\r\n    Blue-green.     Viridian and Cobalt.  Chromium sesquioxide.\r\n\r\n  Yellow and        Raw Sienna.           Native earth.\r\n    Purple-blue.    Ultramarine.          Artificial product.\r\n\r\n  Green and         Emerald green.        Arsenate of copper.\r\n    Red-purple.     Purple madder.        Extract of the madder plant.\r\n\r\n  Blue and          Cobalt.               Oxide of cobalt with alumina.\r\n    Yellow-red.     Orange cadmium.       Sulphide of cadmium.\r\n\r\n  Purple and        Madder and cobalt.    See each pigment above.\r\n    Green-yellow.   Emerald green         See each pigment above.\r\n                      and Sienna.\r\n\r\n(105) These paints have various degrees of hue, value, and chroma, but\r\ncan be tempered by additions of the neutrals, zinc white and ivory\r\nblack, until each is brought to a middle value and tested on the value\r\nscale. After each pair has been thus balanced, they are painted in their\r\nappropriate spaces on the globe, forming an equator of balanced hues.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 17.]\r\n\r\n(106) The method of proving this balance has already been suggested in\r\nChapter IV., paragraph 93. It consists of an ingenious implement devised\r\nby Clerk-Maxwell, which gives us a result of mixing colors without the\r\nchemical risks of letting them come in contact, and also measures\r\naccurately the quantity of each which is used (Fig. 17).\r\n\r\n(107) This is called a Maxwell disc, and is nothing more than a circle\r\nof firm cardboard, pierced with a central hole to fit the spindle of a\r\nrotary motor, and with a radial slit from rim to centre, so that another\r\ndisc may be slid over the first to cover any desired fraction of its\r\nsurface. Let us paint one of these discs with Venetian red and the other\r\nwith viridian and cobalt, the first pair in the list of pigments to be\r\nused on the globe.\r\n\r\n(108) Having dried these two discs, one is combined with the other on\r\nthe motor shaft so that each color occupies half the circle. As soon as\r\nthe motor starts, the two colors are no longer distinguished, and rapid\r\nrotation melts them so perfectly that the eye sees a new color, due to\r\ntheir mixture on the retina. This new color is a reddish gray, showing\r\nthat the red is more chromatic than the blue-green. But by stopping the\r\nmotor and sliding the green disc to cover more of the red one, there\r\ncomes a point where rotation melts them into a perfectly neutral gray.\r\nNo hint of either hue remains, and the pair is said to balance.\r\n\r\n(109) Since this balance has been obtained by _unequal areas_ of the two\r\npigments, it must compensate for a lack of equal chroma in the hues (see\r\nparagraphs 76, 77); and, to measure this inequality, a slightly larger\r\ndisc, with decimal divisions on its rim, is placed back of the two\r\npainted ones. If this scale shows the red as occupying 3-1/3 parts of the\r\narea, while blue-green occupies 6-2/3 parts, then the blue-green must be\r\nonly half as chromatic as the red, since it takes twice as much to\r\nproduce the balance.\r\n\r\n(110) The red is then grayed (diminished in chroma by additions of a\r\nmiddle gray) until it can occupy half the circle, with blue-green on the\r\nremaining half, and still produce neutrality when mixed by rotation.\r\nEach disc now reads 5 on the decimal scale. Lest the graying of red\r\nshould have disturbed its value, it is again tested on the photometric\r\nscale, and reads 4.7, showing it has been slightly darkened by the\r\ngraying process. A little white is therefore added until its value is\r\nrestored to 5.\r\n\r\n(111) The two opposites are now completely balanced, for they are equal\r\nin value (5), equal in chroma (5), and have proved their equality as\r\ncomplements by uniting in equal areas to form a neutral mixture. It only\r\nremains to apply them in their proper position on the sphere.\r\n\r\n(112) A band is traced around the equator, divided in ten equal spaces,\r\nand lettered R, YR, Y, GY, G, BG, B, PB, P, and RP (see Fig. 18). This\r\nbalanced red and blue-green are applied with the brush to spaces marked\r\nR and BG, care being taken to fill, but not to overstep the bounds, and\r\nthe color laid absolutely flat, that no unevenness of value or chroma\r\nmay disturb the balance.\r\n\r\n(113) The next pair, represented by Raw Sienna and Ultramarine, is\r\nsimilarly brought to middle value, balanced by equal areas on the\r\nMaxwell discs, and, when correct in each quality, is painted in the\r\nspaces Y and PB. Emerald Green and Purple Madder, which form the next\r\npigment pair, are similarly tempered, proved, and applied, followed by\r\nthe two remaining pairs, until the equator of the globe presents its ten\r\nequal steps of middle hues.\r\n\r\n\r\n+An equator of ten balanced hues.+\r\n\r\n(114) Now comes the total test of this circuit of balanced hues by\r\nrotation of the sphere. As it gains speed, the colors flash less and\r\nless, and finally melt into a middle gray of perfect neutrality. Had it\r\nfailed to produce this gray and shown a tinge of any hue still\r\npersisting, we should say that the persistent hue was in excess, or,\r\nconversely, that its opposite hue was deficient in chroma, and failed to\r\npreserve its share in the balance.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 18.]\r\n\r\n(115) For instance, had rotation discovered the persistence of reddish\r\ngray, it would have proved the red too strong, or its opposite,\r\nblue-green, too weak, and we should have been forced to retrace our\r\nsteps, applying a correction until neutrality was established by the\r\nrotation test.\r\n\r\n(116) This is the practical demonstration of the assertion (Chapter I.,\r\nparagraph 8) that a _color has three dimensions which can be measured_.\r\nEach of these ten middle hues has proved its right to a definite place\r\non the color globe by its measurements of value and chroma. Being of\r\nequal chroma, all are equidistant from the neutral centre, and, being\r\nequal in value, all are equally removed from the poles. If the warm hues\r\n(red and yellow) or the cool hues (blue and green) were in excess, the\r\nrotation test of the sphere would fail to produce grayness, and so\r\ndetect its lack of balance.[29]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 29: Such a test would have exposed the excess of warm\r\n    color in the schemes of Runge and Chevreul, as shown in the\r\n    Appendix to this chapter.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+A chromatic tuning fork.+\r\n\r\n(117) The five principal steps in this color equator are made in\r\npermanent enamel and carefully safeguarded, so that, if the pigments\r\npainted on the globe should change or become soiled, it could be at once\r\ndetected and set right. These five are middle red (so called because\r\nmidway between white and black, as well as midway between our strongest\r\nred and the neutral centre), middle yellow, middle green, middle blue,\r\nand middle purple. They may be called the CHROMATIC TUNING FORK, for\r\nthey serve to establish the pitch of colors, as the musical tuning fork\r\npreserves the pitch of sounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Completion of a pigment color sphere.+\r\n\r\n(118) When the chromatic tuning fork has thus been obtained, the\r\ncompletion of the globe is only a matter of patience, for the same\r\nmethod can be applied at any level in the scale of value, and a new\r\ncircuit of balanced hues made to conform with its position between the\r\npoles of white and black.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 19.]\r\n\r\n(119) The surface above and below the equatorial band is set off by\r\nparallels to match the photometric scale, making nine bands or value\r\nzones in all, of which the equator is fifth, the black pole being 0 and\r\nthe white pole 10.\r\n\r\n(120) Ten meridians carry the equatorial hues across all these value\r\nzones and trace the gradation of each hue through a complete scale from\r\nblack to white, marked by their values, as shown in paragraph 68. Thus\r\nthe red scale is R1, R2, R3, R4, R5 (middle red), R6, R7, R8, and R9,\r\nand similarly with each of the other hues. When the circle of hues\r\ncorresponding to each level has been applied and tested, the entire\r\nsurface of the globe is spread with a logical system of color scales,\r\nand the eye gratified with regular sequences which move by measured\r\nsteps in each direction.\r\n\r\n(121) Each meridian traces a scale of value for the hue in which it\r\nlies. Each parallel traces a scale of hue for the value at whose level\r\nit is drawn. Any oblique path across these scales traces a regular\r\nsequence, each step combining change of hue with a change of value and\r\nchroma. The more this path approaches the vertical, the less are its\r\nchanges of hue and the more its changes of value and chroma; while, the\r\nnearer it comes to the horizontal, the less are its changes of value and\r\nchroma, while the greater become its changes of hue. Of these two\r\noblique paths the first may be called that of a Luminist, or painter\r\nlike Rembrandt, whose canvases present great contrasts of light and\r\nshade, while the second is that of the Colorist, such as Titian, whose\r\nwork shows great fulness of hues without the violent extremes of white\r\nand black.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Total balance of the sphere tested by rotation on any desired axis.+\r\n\r\n(122) Not only does the mount of the color sphere permit its rotation on\r\nthe vertical axis (white-black), but it is so hung that it may be spun\r\non the ends of any desired axis, as, for instance, that joining our\r\nfirst color pair, red and blue-green. With this pair as poles of\r\nrotation, a new equator is traced through all the values of purple on\r\none side and of green-yellow on the other, which the rotation test melts\r\nin a perfect balance of middle gray, proving the correctness of these\r\nvalues. In the same way it may be hung and tested on successive axes,\r\nuntil the total balance of the entire spherical series is proved.\r\n\r\n(123) But this color system does not cease with the colors spread on the\r\nsurface of a globe.[30] The first illustration of an orange filled with\r\ncolor was chosen for the purpose of stimulating the imagination to\r\nfollow a surface color inward to the neutral axis by regular decrease of\r\nchroma. A slice at any level of the solid, as at value 8 (Fig. 10),\r\nshows each hue of that level passing by even steps of increasing\r\ngrayness to the neutral gray N8 of the axis. In the case of red at this\r\nlevel, it is easily described by the notation R 8/3, R 8/2, R 8/1, of\r\nwhich the initial and upper numerals do not change, but the lower\r\nnumeral traces loss of chroma by 3, 2, and 1 to the neutral axis.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 30: No color is excluded from this system, but the\r\n    excess and inequalities of pigment chroma are traced in the\r\n    Color Atlas.]\r\n\r\n(124) And there are stronger chromas of red outside the surface, which\r\ncan be written R 8/4, R 8/5, R 8/6, etc. Indeed, our color measurements\r\ndiscover such differences of chroma in the various pigments used, that\r\nthe color tree referred to in paragraphs 34, 35, is necessary to bring\r\nbefore the eye their maximum chromas, most of which are well outside the\r\nspherical shell and at various levels of value. One way to describe the\r\ncolor sphere is to suggest that a color tree, the intervals between\r\nwhose irregular branches are filled with appropriate color, can be\r\nplaced in a turning lathe and turned down until the color maxima are\r\nremoved, thus producing a color solid no larger than the chroma of its\r\nweakest pigment (Fig. 2).\r\n\r\n\r\n+Charts of the color solid.+\r\n\r\n(125) Thus it becomes evident that, while the color sphere is a valuable\r\nhelp to the child in conceiving color relations, in uniting the three\r\nscales of color measure, and in furnishing with its mount an excellent\r\ntest of the theory of color balance, yet it is always restricted to the\r\nchroma of its weakest color, the surplus chromas of all other colors\r\nbeing thought of as enormous mountains built out at various levels to\r\nreach the maxima of our pigments.\r\n\r\n(126) The complete color solid is, therefore, of irregular shape, with\r\nmountains and valleys, corresponding to the inequalities of pigments. To\r\ndisplay these inequalities to the eye, we must prepare cross sections or\r\ncharts of the solid, some horizontal, some vertical, and others oblique.\r\n\r\n(127) Such a set of charts forms an atlas of the color solid, enabling\r\none to see any color in its relation to all other colors, and name it by\r\nits degree of hue, value, and chroma. Fig. 20 is a horizontal chart of\r\nall colors which present middle value (5), and describes by an uneven\r\ncontour the chroma of every hue at this level. The dotted fifth circle\r\nis the equator of the color sphere, whose principal hues, R 5/5. Y 5/5,\r\nG 5/5, B 5/5, and P 5/5, form the chromatic tuning fork, paragraph 117.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 20.\r\n\r\n  Chart of\r\n  Middle Value\r\n  - 5 -\r\n  Showing Unequal Chroma\r\n  in circle of Hues. (See Fig. 2).]\r\n\r\n(128) In this single chart the eye readily distinguishes some three\r\nhundred different colors, each of which may be written by its hue,\r\nvalue, and chroma. And even the slightest variation of one of them can\r\nbe defined. Thus, if the principal red were to fade slightly, so that it\r\nwas a trifle lighter and a trifle weaker than the enamel, it would be\r\nwritten R{5.1/4.9}, showing it had lightened by 1 per cent. and weakened\r\nby 1 per cent. The discrimination made possible by this decimal notation\r\nis much finer than our present visual limit. Its use will stimulate\r\nfiner perception of color.\r\n\r\n(129) Such a very elementary sketch of the Color Solid and Color Atlas,\r\nwhich is all that can be given in the confines of this small book, will\r\nbe elsewhere presented on a larger and more complete scale. It should be\r\ncontrasted with the ideal form composed of prismatic colors, suggested\r\nin the last chapter, paragraphs 98, 99, which was shown to be\r\nimpracticable, but whose ideal conditions it follows as far as the\r\nlimitations of pigments permit.\r\n\r\n(130) Besides its value in education as setting all our color notions in\r\norder, and supplying a simple method for their clear expression, it\r\npromises to do away with much of the misunderstanding that accompanies\r\nthe every-day use of color.\r\n\r\n(131) Popular color names are incongruous, irrational, and often\r\nludicrous. One must smile in reading the list of 25 steps in a scale of\r\nblue, made by Schiffer-Muller in 1772:--\r\n\r\n  A. _a._ White pure.\r\n     _b._ White silvery or pearly.\r\n     _c._ White milky.\r\n  B. _a._ Bluish white.\r\n     _b._ Pearly white.\r\n     _c._ Watery white.\r\n  C.      Blue being born.\r\n  D.      Blue dying or pale.\r\n  E.      Mignon blue.\r\n  F.      Celestial blue, or sky-color.\r\n  G. _a._ Azure, or ultramarine.\r\n     _b._ Complete or perfect blue.\r\n     _c._ Fine or queen blue.\r\n  H.      Covert blue or turquoise.\r\n  I.      King blue (deep).\r\n  J.      Light brown blue or indigo.\r\n  K. _a._ Persian blue or woad flower.\r\n     _b._ Forge or steel blue.\r\n     _c._ Livid blue.\r\n  L. _a._ Blackish blue.\r\n     _b._ Hellish blue.\r\n     _c._ Black-blue.\r\n  M. _a._ Blue-black or charcoal.\r\n     _b._ Velvet black.\r\n     _c._ Jet black.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of spacing these 25 colors in 13 groups, some with three\r\nand others with but one example, is not apparent; nor why ultramarine\r\nshould be several steps above turquoise, for the reverse is generally\r\ntrue. Besides which the hue of turquoise is greenish, while that of\r\nultramarine is purplish, but the list cannot show this; and the\r\nremarkable statement that one kind of blue is \"hellish,\" while another\r\nis \"celestial,\" should rest upon an experience that few can claim.\r\nFailing to define color-value and color-hue, the list gives no hint of\r\ncolor-strength, except at C and D, where one kind of blue is \"dying\"\r\nwhen the next is \"being born,\" which not inaptly describes the color\r\nmemory of many a person. Finally, it assures us that Queen blue is\r\n\"fine\" and King blue is \"deep.\"\r\n\r\nThis year the fashionable shades are \"burnt onion\" and \"fresh spinach.\"\r\nThe florists talk of a \"pink violet\" and a \"green pink.\" A maker of inks\r\ndescribes the red as a \"true crimson scarlet,\" which is a contradiction\r\nin terms. These and a host of other names borrowed from the most\r\nheterogeneous sources, become outlawed as soon as the simple color terms\r\nand measures of this system are adopted.\r\n\r\nColor anarchy is replaced by systematic color description.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX TO CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Color schemes based on Brewster's mistaken theory.+\r\n\r\n  [Illustration]\r\n\r\nRunge, of Hamburg (1810), suggested that red, yellow, and blue be placed\r\nequidistant around the equator of a sphere, with white and black at\r\nopposite poles. As the yellow was very light and the blue very dark, any\r\ncoherency in the value scales of red, yellow, and blue was impossible.\r\n\r\nChevreul, of Paris (1861), seeking uniform color scales for his workmen\r\nat the Gobelins, devised a hollow cylinder built up of ten color\r\ncircles. The upper circle had red, yellow, and blue spaced equidistant,\r\nand, as in Runge's solid, yellow was very light and blue very dark. Each\r\ncircle was then made \"one-tenth\" darker than the next above, until black\r\nwas reached at the base. Although each circle was supposed to lie\r\nhorizontally, only the black lowest circle presents a level of uniform\r\nvalues.\r\n\r\nYellow values increase their luminosity thrice as fast as purple values,\r\nso that each circle should tilt at an increasing angle, and the upper\r\ncircle of strongest colors be inclined at 60° to the black base. Besides\r\nthis fault shared with Runge's sphere, it falls into another by not\r\ndiminishing the size of the lower circles where added black diminishes\r\nthe chroma.\r\n\r\nDesire to make colors fit a chosen contour, and the absence of measuring\r\ninstruments, cause these schemes to ignore the facts of color relation.\r\nLike ancient maps made to satisfy a conqueror, they amuse by their\r\ndistortion.\r\n\r\nBrewster's mistaken theory underlies these schemes, as is also the case\r\nwith Froebel's gifts, whose color balls continue to give wrong notions\r\nat the very threshold of color education. As pointed out in the Appendix\r\nto Chapter III., the \"red-yellow-blue\" theory inevitably spreads the\r\nwarm field of yellow-red too far, and contracts the blue field, so that\r\nbalance of color is rendered impossible, as illustrated in the gaudy\r\nchromo and flaming bill-board.\r\n\r\nThese schemes are criticised by Rood as \"not only in the main arbitrary,\r\nbut also vague\"; and, although Chevreul's charts were published by the\r\ngovernment in most elaborate form, their usefulness is small. Interest\r\nin the growth of the present system, because of its measured character,\r\nled Professor Rood to give assistance in the tests, and at his request a\r\ncolor sphere was made for the Physical Cabinet at Columbia.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\nCOLOR NOTATION.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Suggestion of a chromatic score.+\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 21.]\r\n\r\n(132) The last chapter traced a series of steps leading to the\r\nconstruction of a practical color sphere. Each color was tested by\r\nappropriate instruments to assure its degree of hue, value, and chroma,\r\nbefore being placed in position. Then the total sphere was tested to\r\ndetect any lack of balance.\r\n\r\n(133) Each color was also _written_ by a letter and two numerals,\r\nshowing its place in the three scales of hue, value, and chroma. This\r\nnaturally suggests, not only a record of each separate color sensation,\r\nbut also a union of these records in series and groups to form a _color\r\nscore_, similar to the musical score by which the measured relations of\r\nsound are recorded.\r\n\r\n(134) A very simple form of color score may be easily imagined as a\r\ntransparent envelope wrapped around the equator of the sphere, and\r\nforming a vertical cylinder (Fig. 21). On the envelope the equator\r\ntraces a horizontal centre line, which is at 5 of the _value scale_,\r\nwith zones 6, 7, 8, and 9 as parallels above, and the zones 4, 3, 2, and\r\n1 below. Vertical lines are drawn through ten equidistant points on this\r\ncentre line, corresponding with the divisions of the _hue scale_, and\r\nmarked R, YR, Y, GY, G, BG, B, PB, P, and RP.\r\n\r\n(135) The transparent envelope is thus divided into one hundred\r\ncompartments, which provide for ten steps of value in each of the ten\r\nmiddle colors. Now, if we cut open this envelope along one of the\r\nverticals,--as, for instance, red-purple (RP), it may be spread out,\r\nmaking a flat chart of the color sphere (Fig. 22).\r\n\r\n\r\n+Why green is given the centre of the score.+\r\n\r\n(136) A cylindrical envelope might be opened on any desired meridian,\r\nbut it is an advantage to have green (G) at the centre of the chart, and\r\nit is therefore opened at the opposite point, red-purple (RP). To the\r\nright of the green centre are the meridians of green-yellow (GY), yellow\r\n(Y), yellow-red (YR), and red (R), all of which are known as _warm\r\ncolors_, because they contain yellow and red. To the left are the\r\nmeridians of blue-green (BG), blue (B), purple-blue (PB), and purple\r\n(P), all of which are called _cool colors_, because they contain blue.\r\nGreen, being neither warm nor cold of itself, and becoming so only by\r\nadditions of yellow or of blue, thus serves as a balancing point or\r\ncentre in the hue-scale.[31]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 31: To put this in terms of the spectrum wave lengths,\r\n    long waves at the red end of the spectrum give the sensation of\r\n    warmth, while short waves at the violet end cause the sensation\r\n    of coolness. Midway between these extremes is the wave length of\r\n    green.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 22.]\r\n\r\n(137) The color score presents four large divisions or color fields made\r\nby the intersection of the equator with the meridian of green. Above the\r\ncentre are all light colors, and below it are all dark colors. To the\r\nright of the centre are all warm colors, and to the left are all cool\r\ncolors. Middle green (5G 5/5) is the centre of balance for these\r\ncontrasted qualities, recognized by all practical color workers. The\r\nchart forms a rectangle whose length equals the equator of the color\r\nsphere and its height equals the axis (a proportion of 3.14:1),\r\nrepresenting a union and balance of the scales of hue and of value. This\r\nprovides for two color dimensions; but, to be complete, the chart must\r\nprovide for the third dimension, chroma.\r\n\r\n(138) Replacing the chart around the sphere and joining its ends, so\r\nthat it re-forms the transparent envelope, we may thrust a pin through\r\nat any point until it pierces the surface of the sphere. Indeed, the pin\r\ncan be thrust deeper until it reaches the neutral axis, thus forming a\r\nscale of chroma for the color point where it enters (see paragraph 12).\r\nIn the same way any colors on the sphere, within the sphere, or without\r\nit, can have pins thrust into the chart to mark their place, and the\r\nlength by which each pin projects can be taken as a measure of chroma.\r\nIf the chart is now unrolled, it retains the pins, which by their place\r\ndescribe the hue and value of a color, while their length describes its\r\nchroma.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Pins stuck into the score represent chroma.+\r\n\r\n(139) With this idea of the third color dimension incorporated in the\r\nscore we can discard the pin, and record its length by a numeral. Any\r\ndot placed on the score marks a certain degree of hue and value, while a\r\nnumeral beside it marks the degree of chroma which it carries, uniting\r\nwith the hue and value of that point to give us a certain color.\r\nGlancing over a series of such color points, the eye easily grasps their\r\nindividual character, and connects them into an intelligible series.\r\n\r\n(140) Thus a flat chart becomes the projection of the color solid, and\r\nany color in that solid is transferred to the surface of the chart,\r\nretaining its degrees of hue, value, and chroma. So far the scales have\r\nbeen spoken of as divided into ten steps, but they may be subdivided\r\nmuch finer, if desired, by use of the decimal point. It is a question of\r\nconvenience whether to make a small score with only the large divisions,\r\nor a much larger score with a hundred times as many steps. In the\r\nlatter case each hue has ten steps, the middle step of green being\r\ndistinguished as 5G-5/5 to suggest the four steps 1G, 2G, 3G, 4G, which\r\nprecede it, and 6G, 7G, 8G, and 9G, which follow it toward blue-green.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 23.\r\n  COLOR SCORE--(or Nº 6 in Plate III)--GIVING AREAS BY H, V AND C.]\r\n\r\n\r\n+The score preserves color records in a convenient shape.+\r\n\r\nSuch a color score, or notation diagram, to be made small or large as\r\nthe case demands, offers a very convenient means for recording color\r\ncombinations, when pigments are not at hand.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 24.]\r\n\r\n(141) To display its three dimensions, a little model can be made with\r\nthree visiting cards, so placed as to present their mutual intersection\r\nat right angles (Fig. 24).\r\n\r\n5G 5/5 is their centre of mutual balance. A central plane separates all\r\ncolors into two contrasted fields. To the right are all warm colors, to\r\nthe left are all cool colors. Each of these fields is again divided by\r\nthe plane of the equator into lighter colors above and darker colors\r\nbelow. These four color fields are again subdivided by a transverse\r\nplane through 5G 5/5 into strong colors in front and weak colors beyond\r\nor behind it.\r\n\r\n(142) Any color group, whose record must all be written to the right of\r\nthe centre, is warm, because red and yellow are dominant. One to the\r\nleft of the centre must be cool, because it is dominated by blue.\r\nA group written all above the centre must have light in excess, while\r\none written entirely below is dark to excess. Finally, a score written\r\nall in front of the centre represents only strong chromas, while one\r\nwritten behind it contains only weak chromas. From this we gather that a\r\nbalanced composition of color preserves some sort of equilibrium,\r\nuniting degrees of warm and cool, of light and dark, and of weak and\r\nstrong, which is made at once apparent by the dots on the score.\r\n\r\n(143) A single color, like that of a violet, a rose, or a buttercup,\r\nappears as a dot on the score, with a numeral added for its chroma.\r\nA parti-colored flower, such as a nasturtium, is shown by two dots with\r\ntheir chromas, and a bunch of red and yellow flowers will give by their\r\ndots a color passage, or \"silhouette,\" whose warmth and lightness is\r\nunmistakable.\r\n\r\nThe chroma of each flower written with the silhouette completes the\r\nrecord. The hues of a beautiful Persian rug, with dark red\r\npredominating, or a verdure tapestry, in which green is dominant, or a\r\nJapanese print, with blue dominant, will trace upon the score a pattern\r\ndescriptive of its color qualities. These records, with practice, become\r\nas significant to the eye as the musical score. The general character of\r\na color combination is apparent at a glance, while its degrees of chroma\r\nare readily joined to fill out the mental image.\r\n\r\n(144) Such a plan of color notation grows naturally from the spherical\r\nsystem of measured colors. It is hardly to be hoped, in devising a color\r\nscore, that it should not seem crude at first. But the measures forming\r\nthe basis of this record can be verified by impartial instruments, and\r\nhave a permanent value in the general study of color. They also afford\r\nsome definite data as to personal bias in color estimates.\r\n\r\n(145) This makes it possible to collect in a convenient form two\r\ncontrasting and valuable records, one preserving such effects of color\r\nas are generally called pleasing, and another of such groups as are\r\nfound unpleasant to the eye. Out of such material something may be\r\ngained, more reliable than the shifting, personal, and contradictory\r\nstatements about color harmony now prevalent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nCOLOR HARMONY.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Colors may be grouped to please or to give annoyance.+\r\n\r\n(146) Attempts to define the laws of harmonious color have not attained\r\nmarked success, and the cause is not far to seek. The very sensations\r\nunderlying these effects of concord or of discord are themselves\r\nundefined. The misleading formula of my student days--that three parts\r\nof yellow, five parts of red, and eight parts of blue would combine\r\nharmoniously--was unable to define the _kind_ of red, yellow, and blue\r\nintended; that is, the hue, value, and chroma of each of these colors\r\nwas unknown, and the formula meant a different thing to each person who\r\ntried to use it.\r\n\r\n(147) It is true that a certain red, green, and blue can be united in\r\nsuch proportions on Maxwell discs as to balance in a neutral gray; but\r\nthe slightest change in either the hue, value, or chroma, of any one of\r\nthem, upsets the balance. A new proportion is then needed to regain the\r\nneutral mixture. This has already been shown in the discussion of triple\r\nbalance (paragraph 82).\r\n\r\n(148) Harmony of color has been still further complicated by the use of\r\nterms that belong to musical harmony. Now music is a _measured art_, and\r\nhas found a set of intervals which are defined scientifically. The two\r\narts have many points of similarity; and the impulses of sound waves on\r\nthe ear, like those of light waves on the eye, are measured vibrations.\r\nBut they are far apart in their scales, and differ so much in important\r\nparticulars that no practical relationship can be set up. The intervals\r\nof color sensation require fit names and measures, ere their infinite\r\nvariety can be organized into a fixed system.\r\n\r\n(149) Any effort to compare certain sounds to certain colors soon leads\r\nto the wildest vagaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Harmony of sound is unlike harmony of color.+\r\n\r\n(150) The poverty of color language tempts to a borrowing from the\r\nricher terminology of music. Musical terms, such as \"pitch, key, note,\r\ntone, chord, modulation, nocturne, and symphony,\" are frequently used in\r\nthe description of color, serving by association to convey certain vague\r\nideas.\r\n\r\n(151) In the same way the term _color harmony_, from association with\r\nmusical harmony, presents to the mind an image of color\r\narrangement,--varied, yet well proportioned, grouped in orderly fashion,\r\nand agreeable to the eye. But any attempt to define this image in terms\r\nof color is disappointing. Here is a beautiful Persian rug: why do we\r\ncall it beautiful? One says \"because its colors are _rich_.\" Why are\r\nthey rich? \"Because they are _deep in tone_.\" What does that mean? The\r\ndouble-bass and the fog-horn are _deep_ in tone, but not necessarily\r\nbeautiful on that account. \"Oh, no,\" says another, \"it is all in _one\r\nharmonious key_.\" But what is a key of color? Is it made by all the\r\nvalues of one color, such as red, or by all the hues of equal value,\r\nsuch as the middle hues in our color solid?\r\n\r\n(152) Certainly it is neither, for the rug has both light and dark\r\ncolors; and, of the reds, yellows, greens, and blues, some are stronger\r\nand others weaker. Then what do we mean by a key of color? One must\r\neither continue to flounder about or frankly confess ignorance.\r\n\r\n(153) Musical harmony explains itself in clear language. It is\r\nillustrated by fixed and definite sound intervals, whose measured\r\nrelations form the basis of musical composition. Each key has an\r\nunmistakable character, and the written score presents a statement that\r\nmeans practically the same thing to every person of musical\r\nintelligence. But the adequate terms of color harmony are yet to be\r\nworked out.\r\n\r\nLet us leave these musical analogies, retaining only the clue that _a\r\nmeasured and orderly relation underlies the idea of harmony_. The color\r\nsolid which has been the subject of these pages is built upon measured\r\ncolor relations. It unites measured scales of hue, value, and chroma,\r\nand gives a definite color name to every sensation from the maxima of\r\ncolor-light and color-strength to their disappearance in darkness.\r\n\r\n(154) Must not this theoretical color solid, therefore, locate all the\r\nelements which combine to produce color harmony or color discord?[32]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 32: Professor James says there are three classic\r\n    stages in the career of a theory: \"First, it is attacked as\r\n    absurd; then admitted to be true, but obvious and insignificant;\r\n    finally it is seen to be so important that its adversaries claim\r\n    to be its discoverers.\"]\r\n\r\n(155) Instead of theorizing, let us experiment. As a child at the piano,\r\nwho first strikes random and widely separated notes, but soon seeks for\r\nthe intervals of a familiar air, so let us, after roaming over the color\r\nglobe and its charts, select one familiar color, and study what others\r\nwill combine with it to please the eye.\r\n\r\n(156) Here is a grayish green stuff for a dress, and the little girl who\r\nis to wear it asks what other colors she may use with it. First let us\r\nfind it on our instrument, so as to realize its relation to other\r\ndegrees of color. Its value is 6,--one step above the equator of middle\r\nvalue. Its hue is green, G, and its chroma 5. It is written G 6/5.\r\n\r\n(157) Color paths lead out from this point in every direction. Where\r\nshall we find harmonious colors, where discordant, where those paths\r\nmost frequently travelled? Are there new ones still to be explored?\r\n\r\n(158) _There are three typical paths: one vertical_, with rapid change\r\nof value; _another lateral_, with rapid change of hue; and a _third\r\ninward_, through the neutral centre to seek the opposite color field.\r\nAll other paths are combinations of two or three of these typical\r\ndirections in the color solid.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Three typical color paths.+\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 25.]\r\n\r\n(159) 1. The vertical path finds only lighter and darker values of\r\ngray-green,--\"self-colors or shades,\" they are generally called,--and\r\noffers a safe path, even for those deficient in color sensation,\r\navoiding all complications of hue, and leaving the eye free to estimate\r\ndifferent degrees of a single quality,--color-light.\r\n\r\n(160) 2. The lateral path passes through neighboring hues on either\r\nside. In this case it is a sequence from blue, through green into\r\nyellow. This is simply change of hue, without change of value or chroma\r\nif the path be level, but, by inclining it, one end of the sequence\r\nbecomes lighter, while the other end darkens. It thus becomes an\r\nintermediate between the first and second typical paths, combining, at\r\neach step, a change of hue with a change of value. This is more\r\ncomplicated, but also more interesting, showing how the character of the\r\ngray-green dress will be set off by a _lighter_ hat of Leghorn straw,\r\nand further improved by a trimming of _darker_ blue-green. The sequence\r\ncan be made still more subtle and attractive by choosing a straw whose\r\nyellow is _stronger_ than the green of the dress, while a _weaker_\r\nchroma of blue-green is used in the trimming. This is clearly expressed\r\nby the notation thus: Y 8/7, G 6/5, BG 4/3, and written on the score by\r\nthree dots and their chromas,--7, 5, and 3 (see Fig. 23).\r\n\r\n(161) 3. The inward path which leads by increase of gray to the neutral\r\ncentre, and on to the opposite hue red-purple, RP 4/5, is full of\r\npitfalls for the inexpert. It combines great change of hue and chroma,\r\nwith small change of value.\r\n\r\n(162) If any other color point be chosen in place of gray-green, the\r\nsame typical paths are just as easily traced, written by the notation,\r\nand recorded on the color score.\r\n\r\n\r\n+These paths trace sequences from any point in the color solid.+\r\n\r\n(163) In the construction of the color solid we saw that its scales were\r\nmade of equal steps in hue, value, and chroma, and tested by balance on\r\nthe centre of neutral gray. Any step will serve as a point of departure\r\nto trace regular sequences of the three types. The vertical type is a\r\nsequence of value only. It is somewhat tame, lacking the change of hue\r\nand chroma, but giving a monotonous harmony of regular values. The\r\nhorizontal type traces a sequence of neighboring hues, less tame than\r\nthe vertical type, but monotonous in value and chroma. The inward type\r\nconnects opposite hues by a sequence of chroma balanced on middle gray,\r\nand is more stimulating to the eyes.\r\n\r\n(164) These paths have so far been treated as made up of equal steps in\r\neach direction, with the accompanying idea of equal quantities of color\r\nat each step. But by using _unequal quantities of color_, the balance\r\nmay be preserved by compensations to the intervals that separate the\r\ncolors (see paragraphs 109, 110).\r\n\r\n\r\n+Unequal color quantities compensated by relations of hue, value,\r\nand chroma.+\r\n\r\n(165) Small bits of powerful color can be used to balance large fields\r\nof weak chroma. For instance, a spot of strong reddish purple is\r\nbalanced and enhanced by a field of gray-green. So an amethyst pin at\r\nthe neck of the girl's dress will appear to advantage with the gown, and\r\nalso with the Leghorn straw. But a large field of strong color, such as\r\na cloth jacket of reddish purple, would be fatal to the measured harmony\r\nwe seek.\r\n\r\n(166) This use of a small point of strong chroma, if repeated at\r\nintervals, sets up a notion of rhythm; but, in order to be rhythmic,\r\nthere must be recurrent emphasis, \"a succession of similar units,\r\ncombining unlike elements.\" This quality must not be confused with the\r\nunaccented succession, seen in a measured scale of hue, value, or\r\nchroma.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Paper masks to isolate color intervals.+\r\n\r\n(167) A sheet of paper large enough to hide the color sphere may be\r\nperforated with three or more openings in a straight line, and applied\r\nagainst the surface, so as to isolate the steps of any sequence which we\r\nwish to study. Thus the sequence given in paragraph 160--Y 8/7, G 6/5,\r\nBG 4/3--may be changed to bring it on the surface of the sphere, when it\r\nreads Y 8/3, G 6/5, BG 5/5. A mask with round holes, spaced so as to\r\nuncover these three spots, relieves the eye from the distraction of\r\nother colors. Keeping the centre spot on green, the mask may be moved so\r\nas to study the effect of changing hue or value of the other two steps\r\nin the sequence.\r\n\r\n(168) The sequence is lightened by sliding the whole mask upward, and\r\ndarkened by dropping it lower. Then the result of using the same\r\nintervals in another field is easily studied by moving the mask to\r\nanother part of the solid.\r\n\r\n(169) Change of interval immediately modifies the character of a color\r\nsequence. This is readily shown by having an under-mask, with a long,\r\ncontinuous slit, and an over-mask whose perforations are arranged in\r\nseveral rows, each row giving different spaces between the perforations.\r\nIn the case of the girl's clothing, the same sequence produces quite a\r\ndifferent effect, if two perforations of the over-mask are brought\r\nnearer to select a lighter yellow-green dress, while the ends of the\r\nsequence remain unchanged. To move the middle perforation near the other\r\nend, selects a darker bluish green dress, on which the trimming will be\r\nless contrasted, while the hat appears brighter than before, because of\r\ngreater contrast.\r\n\r\n(170) The variations of color sequence which can thus be studied out by\r\nsimple masks are almost endless; yet upon a measured system the\r\ncharacter of each effect is easily described, and, if need be, preserved\r\nby a written record.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Invention of color groups.+\r\n\r\n(171) Experiments with variable masks for the selection of color\r\nintervals, such as have been described, soon stimulate the imagination,\r\nso that it conceives sequences through any part of the color solid. The\r\ncolor image becomes a permanent mental adjunct. Five middle colors,\r\ntempered with white and black, permit us to devise the greatest variety\r\nof sequences, some light, others dark, some combining small difference\r\nof chroma with large difference of hue, others uniting large intervals\r\nof chroma with small intervals of hue, and so on through a well-nigh\r\ninexhaustible series.\r\n\r\n(172) As this constructive imagination gains power, the solid and its\r\ncharts may be laid aside. _We can now think color consecutively._ Each\r\ncolor suggests its place in the system, and may be taken as a point of\r\ndeparture for the invention of groups to carry out a desired relation.\r\n\r\n(173) This selective mental process is helped by the score described in\r\nthe last chapter; and the quantity of each color chosen for the group is\r\neasily indicated by a variable circle, drawn round the various points on\r\nthe diagram. Thus, in the case of the child's clothes, a large circle\r\naround G 6/5 gives the area of that color as compared with smaller\r\ncircles around Y 8/7 and BG 4/3, representing the area of the straw and\r\nthe trimming.\r\n\r\n(174) When the plotting of color groups has become instinctive from long\r\npractice, it opens a wide field of color study. Take as illustration the\r\nwings of butterflies or the many varieties of pansies. These fascinating\r\ncolor schemes can be written with indications of area that record their\r\ndifferences by a simple diagram. In the same way, rugs, tapestries,\r\nmosaics,--whatever attracts by its beauty and harmony of color,--can be\r\nrecorded and studied in measured terms; and the mental process of\r\nestimating hues, values, chromas, and areas by established scales must\r\nlead the color sense to finer and finer perceptions.\r\n\r\nThe same process serves as well to record the most annoying and\r\ninharmonious color groups. When sufficient of these records have been\r\nobtained, they furnish definite material for a contrast of the color\r\ncombinations which please, with those that cause disgust. Such a\r\ncontrast should discover some broad law of color harmony. It will then\r\nbe in measured terms which can be clearly given; not a vague personal\r\nstatement, conveying different meanings to each one who hears it.\r\n\r\n\r\n+Constant exercise needed to train the color sense.+\r\n\r\n(175) Appreciation of beautiful color grows by exercise and\r\ndiscrimination, just as naturally as fine perception of music or\r\nliterature. Each is an outlet for the expression of taste,--a language\r\nwhich may be used clumsily or with skill.\r\n\r\n(176) As color perception becomes finer, it discards the more crude and\r\nviolent contrasts. A child revels in strong chromas, but the mark of a\r\ncolorist is ability to employ low chroma without impoverishing the color\r\neffect. As a boy's shrieks and groans can be tempered to musical\r\nutterance, so his debauches in violent red, green, and purple must be\r\nreplaced by tempered hues.\r\n\r\n(177) Raphael, Titian, Velasquez, Corot, Chavannes, and Whistler are\r\nmasters in the use of gray. Personal bias may lead one colorist a little\r\nmore toward warm colors, and another slightly toward the cool field, in\r\neach case attaining a sense of harmonious balance by tempered degrees of\r\nvalue and chroma.[33]\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 33: \"Nature's most lively hues are bathed in lilac\r\n    grays. Spread all about us, yet visible only to the fine\r\n    perception of the colorist, is this gray quality by which he\r\n    appeals. Not he whose pictures abound in '_couleurs voyantes_,'\r\n    but he who preserves in his work all the '_gris colorés_' is the\r\n    good colorist.\"\r\n\r\n    Translation from J. F. Rafaelli, in _Annales Politiques &\r\n    Litteraires_.]\r\n\r\n(178) It is not claimed that discipline in the use of subtle colors will\r\nmake another Corot or Velasquez, but it will make for comprehension of\r\ntheir skill. It is grotesque to watch gaudily dressed persons going into\r\necstasies over the delicate coloring of a Botticelli, when the internal\r\nas well as the external evidence is against them.\r\n\r\n(179) The colors which we choose, not only in personal apparel, but in\r\nour rooms and decorations, are mute witnesses to a stage of color\r\nperception.\r\n\r\nIf that perception is trained to finer distinctions, the mind can no\r\nlonger be content with coarse expression. It begins to feel an\r\nincongruity between the \"loud\" color of the wall paper, bought because\r\nit was fashionable, and the quiet hues of the rug, which was a gift from\r\nsome artistic friend. It sees that, although the furniture is covered\r\nwith durable and costly materials, their color \"swears\" at that of the\r\ncurtains and wood-work. In short, the room has been jumbled together at\r\nvarious periods, without any plan or sense of color design.\r\n\r\n(180) Good taste demands that a room be furnished, not alone for\r\nconvenience and comfort, but also with an eye to the beauty of the\r\nvarious objects, so that, instead of confusing and destroying the\r\ncolors, each may enhance the other. And, when this sense of color\r\nharmony is aroused, it selects and arranges the books, the rugs, the\r\nlamp shade, the souvenirs of travel and friendship, the wall paper,\r\npictures, and hangings, so that they fit into a color scheme, not only\r\ncharming to the eye at first glance, but which continues to please the\r\nmind as it traces out an intelligent plan, bringing all into general\r\nharmony.\r\n\r\n(181) Nor will this cease when one room has been put to rights. Such a\r\ncoloristic attitude is not satisfied until the vista into the next\r\napartment is made attractive. Or should there be a suite of rooms, it\r\ndemands that, with variety in each one, they all be brought into\r\nharmonious sequence. Thus the study of color finds immediate and\r\npractical use in daily life. It is a needed discipline of color vision,\r\nin the sense that geometry is a discipline of the mind, and it also\r\nenters into the pleasure and refinement of life at every step. Skill or\r\nawkwardness in its use exerts as positive an influence upon us as do the\r\nharmonies and discords of sound, and a far more continuous one. It is\r\nthought a defect to be unmusical. Should it not be considered a mark of\r\ndefective cultivation to be insensitive to color?\r\n\r\n(182) In this slight sketch of color education it has been assumed that\r\nwe are to deal with those who have normal perceptions. But there are\r\nsome who inherit or develop various degrees of color-blindness; and a\r\nword in their behalf may be opportune.\r\n\r\n(183) A case of total color-blindness is very rare, but a few are on\r\nrecord. When a child shows deficient color perception,[34] a little care\r\nmay save him much discomfort, and patient training may correct it. If he\r\nmismatches some hues, confuses their names, seems incapable of the finer\r\ndistinctions of color, study to find the hues which he estimates well,\r\nand then help him to venture a little into that field where his\r\nperception is at fault. Improvement is pretty sure to follow when this\r\nis sympathetically done. One student, who never outgrew the habit of\r\ngiving a purplish hue to all his work, despite many expedients and the\r\nuse of various lights and colored objects to correct it, is the single\r\nexception among hundreds whom it has been my privilege to watch as they\r\nimproved their first crude estimates, and gained skill in expressing\r\ntheir sense of Nature's subtle color.\r\n\r\n    [Footnote 34: See Color Blindness in Glossary.]\r\n\r\n(184) To sum up, the first chapter suggests a measured color system in\r\nplace of guess-work. The next describes the three color qualities, and\r\nsketches a child's growth in color perception. The third tells how\r\ncolors may be mingled in such proportions as to balance. After the\r\nimpracticability of using spectral color has been shown in the fourth\r\nchapter, the fifth proceeds to build a practical color solid. The sixth\r\nprovides for a written record of color, and the last applies all that\r\nhas preceded to suggestions for the study of color harmony.\r\n\r\n(185) Wide gaps appear in this outline. There is much that deserves\r\nfuller treatment. But, if the search for refined color and a clearer\r\noutlook upon its relations are stimulated by this fragmentary sketch,\r\nsome of its faults may be overlooked.\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n  REPRODUCTION OF FLOWER STUDIES, PAINTED WITH MUNSELL WATER COLOR\r\n  Published By\r\n  WADSWORTH, HOWLAND & CO., INCORPORATED\r\n  BOSTON, MASS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  PART II.\r\n\r\n  A COLOR SYSTEM AND COURSE OF STUDY\r\n  BASED ON THE COLOR SOLID AND ITS CHARTS.\r\n\r\n  Arranged for nine years of school life.\r\n\r\n\r\n  GLOSSARY OF COLOR TERMS.\r\n\r\n  Taken from the Century Dictionary.\r\n\r\n\r\n  INDEX\r\n\r\n  (by paragraphs).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: Fig. 2 (See Fig. 20)\r\n  The Color Tree]\r\n\r\n  A COLOR SYSTEM WITH COURSE OF STUDY\r\n  BASED ON THE COLOR SOLID AND ITS CHARTS\r\n\r\n\r\n  _See Chapter II._\r\n\r\n  Copyright, 1904, by A.

Special attention is called to the cross references which\r\nserve to differentiate HUE, VALUE, and CHROMA._\r\n\r\n\r\nAFTER IMAGE.--An image perceived after withdrawing the eye from a\r\nbrilliantly illuminated object. Such images are called positive when\r\ntheir colors are the same as that of the object, and negative when they\r\nare its complementary colors.\r\n\r\nBLUE.--Of the color of the clear sky; of the color of the spectrum\r\nbetween wave lengths .505 and .415 micron, and more especially .487 and\r\n.460; or of such light mixed with white; azure, cerulean.\r\n\r\nBLACK.--Possessing in the highest degree the property of absorbing\r\nlight; reflecting and transmitting little or no light; of the color of\r\nsoot or coal; of the darkest possible hue; sable. Optically, wholly\r\ndestitute of color, or absolutely dark, whether from the absence or the\r\ntotal absorption of light. Opposed to white.\r\n\r\nBROWN.--A dark color, inclined to red or yellow, obtained by mixing red,\r\nblack, and yellow.\r\n\r\n+CHROMA.--The degree of departure of a color sensation from that of\r\nwhite or gray; the intensity of distinctive hue; color intensity.+\r\n\r\nCHROMATIC.--Relating to or of the nature of color.\r\n\r\nCOBALT BLUE.--A pure blue tending toward cyan blue and of high\r\nluminosity; also called Hungary blue, Lethner's blue, and Paris blue.\r\n\r\nCOLOR.--Objectively, that quality of a thing or appearance which is\r\nperceived by the eye alone, independently of the form of the thing;\r\nsubjectively, a sensation peculiar to the organ of vision, and arising\r\nfrom the optic nerve.\r\n\r\nCOLOR BLINDNESS.--Incapacity for perceiving colors, independent of the\r\ncapacity for distinguishing light and shade. The most common form is\r\ninability to perceive red as a distinct color, red objects being\r\nconfounded with gray or green; and next in frequency is the inability to\r\nperceive green.\r\n\r\nCOLOR CONSTANTS.--The numbers which measure the quantities, as well as\r\nany other system of three numbers for defining colors, are called\r\nconstants of color.\r\n\r\nCOLOR VARIABLES.--Colors vary in CHROMA, or freedom from admixture of\r\nwhite light; in BRIGHTNESS, or luminosity; and in HUE, which roughly\r\ncorresponds to the mean wave length of the light emitted.\r\n\r\nCOLORS, COMPLEMENTARY.--Those pairs of color which when mixed produce\r\nwhite or gray light, such as red and green-blue, yellow and indigo-blue,\r\ngreen-yellow and violet.\r\n\r\nCOLORS, PRIMARY.--The red, green, and violet light of the spectrum, from\r\nthe mixture of which all other colors can be produced. Also called\r\nfundamental colors.\r\n\r\nDYESTUFFS.--In commerce, any dyewood, lichen, or dyecake used in dyeing\r\nand staining.\r\n\r\nELECTRIC LIGHT.--Light produced by electricity and of two general kinds,\r\nthe arc light and the incandescent light.

In the second a resisting conductor is rendered\r\nincandescent by the current.\r\n\r\nENAMEL.--In the fine arts a vitreous substance or glass, opaque or\r\ntransparent, and variously colored, applied as a coating on a surface of\r\nmetal or of porcelain.\r\n\r\nGRATING, DIFFRACTION.--A series of fine parallel lines on a surface of\r\nglass, or polished metal, ruled very close together, at the rate of\r\n10,000 to 20,000 or even 40,000 to the inch; distinctively called a\r\ndiffraction or a diffraction grating, much used in spectroscopic work.\r\n\r\nGRAY.--A color having little or no distinctive hue (CHROMA) and only\r\nmoderate luminosity.\r\n\r\nGREEN.--The color of ordinary foliage; the color seen in the solar\r\nspectrum between wave lengths 0.511 and 0.543 micron.\r\n\r\nEMERALD GREEN.--A highly chromatic and extraordinarily luminous green of\r\nthe color of the spectrum at wave length 0.524 micron. It recalls the\r\nemerald by its brilliancy, but not by its tint; applied generally to the\r\naceto-arsenate of copper. Usually known as Paris green.\r\n\r\nHIGH COLOR.--A hue which excites intensely chromatic color sensations.\r\n\r\n+HUE.--Specifically and technically, distinctive quality of coloring in\r\nan object or on a surface; the respect in which red, yellow, green,\r\nblue, etc., differ one from another; that in which colors of equal\r\nluminosity and CHROMA may differ.+\r\n\r\nINDIGO.--The violet-blue color of the spectrum, extending, according to\r\nHelmholtz, from G two-thirds of the way to F in the prismatic spectrum.\r\nThe name was introduced by Newton, but has lately been discarded by the\r\nbest writers.\r\n\r\nLIGHT.--Adjective applied to colors highly luminous and more or less\r\ndeficient in CHROMA.\r\n\r\nLUMINOSITY.--Specifically, the intensity of light in a color, measured\r\nphotometrically; that is to say, a standard light has its intensity, or\r\n_vis viva_, altered, until it produces the impression of being equally\r\nbright with the color whose light is to be determined; and the measure\r\nof the _vis viva_ of the altered light, relatively to its standard\r\nintensity, is then taken as the luminosity of the color in question.\r\n\r\nMAXWELL COLOR DISCS.--Discs having each a single color, and slit\r\nradially so that one may be made to lap over another to any desired\r\nextent. By rotating these on a spindle, the effect of combining certain\r\ncolors in varying proportions can be studied.\r\n\r\nMICRON.--The millionth part of a metre, or 1/23400 of an English inch.\r\nThe term has been formally adopted by the International Commission of\r\nWeights and Measures, representing the civilized nations of the world,\r\nand is adopted by all metrologists.\r\n\r\nORANGE.--A reddish yellow color, of which the orange is the type.\r\n\r\nVISION, PERSISTENCE OF.--The continuance of a visual impression upon the\r\nretina of the eye after the exciting cause is removed. The length of\r\ntime varies with the intensity of the light and the excitability of the\r\nretina, and ordinarily is brief, though the duration may be for hours,\r\nor even days. The after image may be either positive or negative, the\r\nlatter when the bright part appears dark and the colored parts in their\r\ncorresponding contrast colors. It is because of this persistence that,\r\nfor example, a firebrand moved very rapidly appears as a band or circle\r\nof light.\r\n\r\nPHOTOMETER.--An instrument used to measure the intensity of light.\r\nSpecifically, to compare the relative intensities of the light emitted\r\nfrom various sources.\r\n\r\nPIGMENT.--Any substance that is or can be used by painters to impart\r\ncolor to bodies.\r\n\r\nPINK.--A red color of low chroma, but high luminosity, inclining toward\r\npurple.\r\n\r\nPRIMARY COLORS.--See Colors, primary.\r\n\r\nPURE COLOR.--A color produced by homogeneous light. Any very brilliant\r\nor decided color.\r\n\r\nPURPLE.--A color formed by the mixture of blue and red, including the\r\nviolet of the spectrum above wave length 0.417, which is nearly a violet\r\nblue, and extending to, but not including, crimson.\r\n\r\nRAINBOW.--A bow or an arc of a circle, consisting of the prismatic\r\ncolors, formed by the refraction and the reflection of rays of light\r\nfrom drops of rain or vapor, appearing in the part of the heavens\r\nopposite to the sun.\r\n\r\nRED.--A color more or less resembling that of blood, or the lower end of\r\nthe spectrum. Red is one of the most general color names, and embraces\r\ncolors ranging in hue from aniline to scarlet iodide of mercury and red\r\nlead. A red yellower than vermilion is called scarlet. One much more\r\ncrimson is called crimson red. A very dark red, if pure or crimson, is\r\ncalled maroon; if brownish, chestnut or chocolate. A pale red--that is,\r\none of low CHROMA and high LUMINOSITY--is called a pink, ranging from\r\nrose pink or pale crimson to salmon pink or pale scarlet.\r\n\r\nVENETIAN RED.--An important pigment used by artists, somewhat darker\r\nthan brick red in color, and very permanent.\r\n\r\nRETINA.--The innermost and chiefly nervous coat of the posterior part of\r\nthe eyeball.\r\n\r\nSATURATION, OF COLORS.--In optics the degree of admixture with white,\r\nthe saturation diminishing as the amount of white is increased. In other\r\nwords, the highest degree of saturation belongs to a given color when in\r\nthe state of greatest purity.\r\n\r\nSCALE.--A graded system, by reference to which the degree, intensity, or\r\nquality of a sense perception may be estimated.\r\n\r\nSHADE.--Degree or gradation of defective luminosity in a color, often\r\nused vaguely from the fact that paleness, or high luminosity, combined\r\nwith defective CHROMA, is confounded with high luminosity by itself. See\r\nColor, Hue, and Tint.\r\n\r\nSPECTRUM.--In physics the continuous band of light showing the\r\nsuccessive prismatic colors, or the isolated lines or bands of color,\r\nobserved when the radiation from such a source as the sun or an ignited\r\nvapor in a gas flame is viewed after having been passed through a prism\r\n(prismatic spectrum) or reflected from a diffraction grating\r\n(diffraction or interference spectrum). See Rainbow.\r\n\r\nTINT.--A variety of color; especially and properly, a luminous variety\r\nof low CHROMA; also, abstractly, the respect in which a color may be\r\nraised by more or less admixture of white, which at once increases the\r\nluminosity and diminishes the CHROMA.\r\n\r\nTONE.--A sound having definiteness and continuity enough so that its\r\npitch, force, and quality may be readily estimated by the ear. Musical\r\nsound opposed to noise. The prevailing effect of a color.\r\n\r\nULTRAMARINE.--A beautiful natural blue pigment, obtained from the\r\nmineral lapis-lazuli.\r\n\r\n+VALUE.--In painting and the allied arts, relation of one object, part,\r\nor atmospheric plane of a picture to the others, with reference to light\r\nand shade, the idea of HUE being abstracted.+\r\n\r\nVERMILION.--The red sulphate of mercury.\r\n\r\nVIOLET.--A general class of colors, of which the violet flower is a\r\nhighly chromatic example. The sensation is produced by a pure blue whose\r\nCHROMA has been diminished while its LUMINOSITY has been increased. Thus\r\nblue and violet are the same color, though the sensations are different.\r\nA mere increase of illumination may cause a violet blue to appear\r\nviolet, with a diminution of apparent CHROMA. This color, called violet\r\nor blue according to the quality of the sensation it excites, is one of\r\nthe three fundamental colors of Young's theory. A deep blue tinged with\r\nred.\r\n\r\nVIRIDIAN.--Same as Veronese green.\r\n\r\nWHITE.--A color transmitting, and so reflecting to the eye, all the rays\r\nof the spectrum, combined in the same proportion as in the impinging\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nYELLOW.--The color of gold and of light, of wave length 0.581 micron.\r\nThe name is restricted to highly chromatic and luminous colors. When\r\nreduced in CHROMA, it becomes buff; when reduced in LUMINOSITY, a cool\r\nbrown. See Brown.\r\n\r\nVERONESE GREEN.--A pigment consisting of hydrated chromium sesquioxide.\r\nIt is a clear bluish green of great permanency. Also called Viridian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX BY PARAGRAPHS.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Balance of color, 23, 47, 67, 75-77, 81-86, 106, 108, 111, 114, 132,\r\n      136, 142, 147, Appendix III.\r\n  Black, 12, 16, 22, 31, 41, 54, 55, 65, 91, 119.\r\n  Blue, 9, 12, 16, 34, 104, 146, 147.\r\n  Brewster's theory, Appendix III.\r\n\r\n  Charts of the color sphere, 14, 17, 126, 127, 135, 136, 140.\r\n  Chevreul, Appendix III., V.\r\n  Chroma, 3, 4, 8, 11, 14, 21-24, 28, 39, 40, 42, 45, 64, 76, 78, 82,\r\n      88, 94, 95, 105, 121, 132.\r\n    Scale of, 12, 19, 25, 31-35, 42, 133.\r\n    Strongest, 32, 34, 42.\r\n  Chromatic tuning fork, 117, 118, 119-127.\r\n  Circuit, inclined, 16, 17, 97.\r\n  Color, apparatus, 3, 8, 14, 132.\r\n    Atlas, 129.\r\n    Balance, 23, 47, 67, 75-77, 81-86 (triple), 106, 108, 111, 114, 132,\r\n        136, 142, 147.\r\n    Blindness, 182, 183.\r\n    Charts, 14, 17, 126, 127, 135, 136, 140.\r\n    Circuit, 54, 58, 59.\r\n    Complementary, 76, 77.\r\n    Color, dimensions of, 3, 8, 9, 13, 25, 53, 94, 116.\r\n    Curves, 94.\r\n    Discs, Maxwell's, 76, 93, 106-112, 113, 117.\r\n    Harmony, 47, 77, 86, 145-148, 151-174, 180.\r\n    Hand as a holder of, 54-58.\r\n    Key of, 6, 151, 152.\r\n    Language, poverty of, 5, 175.\r\n    Lists, 131.\r\n    Measured, 3, 14, 32.\r\n    Meridians, 136, 137.\r\n    Middle, 28, 29, 40-42, 113.\r\n    Misnomers, Appendix I.\r\n    Mixture, 56-72.\r\n    Names, 1, 2, 14, 19, 25, 90, 91, 131.\r\n    Notation, 36, 37, 40-42, 47, 67, 72, 86, 101, 133.\r\n    Orange, 9-11, 89, 123.\r\n    Parallels, 12, 119.\r\n    Paths, 157, 158, 160-164.\r\n    Perception, 27, 29, 39, 179.\r\n    Principal (5), 4, 16, 21, 26, 31, 34, 40, 54, 56, 57.\r\n    Principal (5) and intermediates (5), 31, 60, 68, 112, 134.\r\n    Purity, 8, 19, 23, 89, 98, 99.\r\n    Records 145.\r\n    Relations, 14, 24, 36, 37, 153.\r\n    Rhythm, 166.\r\n    Scale, 3, 7, 24, 30, 55, 120, 140, Appendix II.\r\n    Score, 133-139, 142, 173.\r\n    Sensations, 3, 4, 15, 19, 21, 87.\r\n    Sequences, 47, 78, 79, 120, 156, 169-171, 181.\r\n    Sir Isaac Newton's, 89.\r\n    Schemes, Appendix V.\r\n    Solid, 14, 19, 102, 126, 129, 140, 153.\r\n    Spectral, 16, 88, 94, 129.\r\n    Sphere, 12-17, 24, 25, 31, 43, 55, 72, 91, 101, 102, 111, 122, 132.\r\n    Standard, 4, 26, 35.\r\n    System, 3, 8, 28, 123, 130.\r\n      Need of, 46, 148.\r\n    Tree, 14, 30-34, 43, 94, 95, 124.\r\n    Waves, 21, 23, 136.\r\n    Tones, 134.\r\n  Children's color studies, Appendix IV.\r\n  Colorist, 84, 121, 177.\r\n  Coloristic art, 7, 38, 45, 177.\r\n  Combined scales, 12, 14, 36, 37, 47.\r\n  Complements, 76, 77.\r\n  Course of color study, 48-50.\r\n\r\n  Daylight photometer, 22, 103, 119.\r\n\r\n  Enamels, 28, 29, 101, 117.\r\n\r\n  Fading, 8, 23.\r\n  False color balance, Appendix III.\r\n  Flat diagrams, 14.\r\n  Fundamental sensations, 28, Appendix III.\r\n\r\n  Green, 2, 32, 104, 136, 137, 140, 147, 148.\r\n\r\n  Hue, 3, 4, 8, 9-11, 14, 18, 21-26, 34, 39, 40, 43, 54, 59, 76, 82,\r\n      89, 105.\r\n    Scale of, 12, 19, 25, 31, 35, 120, 133.\r\n\r\n  Ideal color system, 100.\r\n\r\n  Lambert's pyramid, note to 31.\r\n  Luminist, 121.\r\n\r\n  Masks, 47, 167-171.\r\n  Maxwell discs, 93, 107, 113, 117.\r\n  Measurement of colors, 3, 8, 14, 116, Appendix IV.\r\n  Middle gray, 61, 65, 72.\r\n  Middle hues, 10, 28, 65.\r\n  Mixture of hues, 56-72.\r\n  Musical terms used for colors, 6, 46, 148-150.\r\n\r\n  Neutral axis, 31, 34, 61, 65, 121.\r\n  Neutral gray, 11, 23, 25, 62, 64, 65, 72, 114, 102.\r\n  Notation diagram, 140.\r\n\r\n  Orange, 9-11, 18, 123.\r\n\r\n  Personal bias, 144, 174.\r\n  Pigments, 14, 27-29, 101-104, 125, 129.\r\n  Photometer, 65.\r\n  Primary sensations, 89.\r\n  Prismatic color sphere, 98.\r\n  Purple, 5.\r\n\r\n  Rainbow, 15, 17.\r\n  Red, middle, 1, 32, 41, 60, 66, 72, 104, 110, 122, 147, 148.\r\n  Retina, 21.\r\n  Rood, modern chromatics, Appendix I.\r\n  Runge, note to 31, Appendix V.\r\n\r\n  Shades and tints, 22.\r\n  Spectrum, solar, 15-18, 27, 28, 87, 88, 92, 95, 96.\r\n\r\n  Tone, 6.\r\n\r\n  Value, 3, 8-11, 14, 21-24, 28, 34, 39, 40-43, 54, 76, 78, 82, 94,\r\n      105, 120, 132.\r\n    Scale of, 12, 19, 25, 31, 34, 35, 64, 102, 120, 133.\r\n  Vermilion, 42, Appendix III.\r\n  Vertical (neutral) axis, 12, 25, 31, 34, 65, 68.\r\n  Violet, 90.\r\n\r\n  Warm and cold colors, 72, 123, note to 136, 137, 138.\r\n  Wave lengths, 21, 22, 23, 89.\r\n  White, 12, 16, 17, 22, 31, 41, 54, 55, 65, 87, 91, 92, 99, 119.\r\n\r\n  Yellow, 1, 32, 54, 104, 136.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe MUNSELL PHOTOMETER\r\n\r\n  Patented November 19, 1901\r\n\r\n\r\n  A portable, daylight instrument, adapted to laboratory work\r\n    in general, and of especial service in the comparison\r\n      of color values.
