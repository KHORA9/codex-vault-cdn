The original method of\r\npresentation is preserved. The text-book idea is adhered to, so that\r\nthe individual instructor may have full liberty to expand on topics in\r\nwhich he is especially interested. A number of illustrations have been\r\nadded, the text has been improved in many instances by the addition\r\nof further explanatory matter and the most recent general advances in\r\nthe Science. Examples are the System of Classification of the Society\r\nof American Bacteriologists, which is used throughout the text, their\r\nKey to the Genera of Bacteria, a discussion of the H-ion concentration\r\nmethod of standardization, the selective action of anilin dyes, the\r\nmechanism of entrance of pathogenic organisms into the body, a more\r\ndetailed explanation of the origin of antibodies, the nature of\r\nantigens and a table of antigens and antibodies.\r\n\r\nProfessor Vera McCoy Masters has assisted in the revision by aiding\r\nin the preparation of manuscript and the reading of proof and in the\r\nmaking of the index, for which services the author’s thanks are hereby\r\nexpressed.\r\n\r\n    C.

One semester is\r\ndevoted to General Bacteriology. During the second semester the student\r\nhas a choice of special work in Pathogenic, Dairy, Soil, Water, or\r\nChemical Bacteriology. A second year may be devoted to advanced work in\r\nany of the above lines, to Immunity and Serum Therapy, or to Pathogenic\r\nProtozoa.\r\n\r\nThis text-book is intended to cover the first or introductory\r\nsemester’s work, and requires two classroom periods per week. Each\r\nstudent is compelled to take two laboratory periods of three hours per\r\nweek along with the class work. The outline of the laboratory work is\r\ngiven at the end of the text. Results attained seem to justify this\r\nplan. A text-book is but one of many pedagogical mechanisms and is not\r\nintended to be an encyclopedia of the subject.\r\n\r\nThe author makes no claim to originality of content, since the facts\r\npresented are well known to every bacteriologist, though the method\r\nof presentation is somewhat different from texts in general. During\r\nthe preparation of this work he has made a thorough review of the\r\nliterature of Bacteriology, covering the standard text-books as well\r\nas works of reference and the leading periodicals dealing with the\r\nsubject. Thus the latest information has been incorporated.\r\n\r\nNo attempt has been made to give detailed references in a work of this\r\ncharacter.\r\n\r\nThe photomicrographs are original except where otherwise indicated\r\nand are all of a magnification of one thousand diameters where no\r\nstatement to the contrary appears. These photographs were made with\r\na Bausch & Lomb Projection Microscope fitted with a home-made camera\r\nbox. Direct current arc light was used and exposures were five to ten\r\nseconds. Photographs of cultures are also original with a few indicated\r\nexceptions. All temperatures are indicated in degrees centigrade.\r\n\r\nFor use of electrotypes or for prints furnished the author is indebted\r\nto the following: A. P. Barber Creamery Supply Company, Chicago, Ill.;\r\nBausch & Lomb Optical Company, Rochester, N.

INTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nBacteriology as a science is a development of the latter half of the\r\nnineteenth century. It may be said to have begun in the decade between\r\n1870 and 1880, due largely to the wide circulation given to Koch’s\r\nwork in proving that _Bacillus anthracis_ is the cause of Anthrax in\r\n1876, in devising new culture methods and in demonstrating that wound\r\ninfections are due to microörganisms, 1878. Associated with this\r\nwork were the great improvements in the microscope by Abbé and the\r\nintroduction of anilin dyes for staining bacteria by Weigert. These\r\nresults attracted workers throughout the world to the “new science.”\r\nNevertheless, this work of Koch’s was preceded by numerous observations\r\nand experiments which led up to it. Certainly the most important\r\ndiscoveries immediately responsible were those of Pasteur. He must be\r\nconsidered as the greatest of the pioneer bacteriologists since he\r\nworked in all fields of the subject. Some of the antecedent work was\r\ndone in attempting to disprove the old “spontaneous generation” theory\r\nas to the origin of organisms; some in searching for the causes of\r\ndisease and some in the study of fermentation and putrefaction.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPONTANEOUS GENERATION.\r\n\r\nSpeculation as to the first origin of life is as old as history and\r\ndoubtless older. Every people of antiquity had its own legends, as for\r\nexample, the account in Genesis. This question never can be definitely\r\nsettled, even though living matter should be made in the laboratory.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of the “spontaneous origin” of particular animals or\r\nplants from dead material under man’s own observation is a somewhat\r\ndifferent proposition and may be subjected to experimental test. The\r\nold Greek philosophers believed it. Anaximander (B.C. 610-547) taught\r\nthat some animals are derived from moisture. Even Aristotle (B.C.\r\n384-322) said that “animals sometimes arise in soil, in plants, or\r\nin other animals,” _i.e._, spontaneously. It can be stated that this\r\nbelief was general from his day down through the Dark and Middle Ages\r\nand later. Cardano (A.D. 1501-1576) wrote that water gives rise to\r\nfish and animals and is also the cause of fermentation. Van Helmont\r\n(1578-1644) gives directions for making artificial mice. Kircher\r\n(1602-1680) describes and figures animals _produced under his own eyes_\r\nby water on plant stems.\r\n\r\nHowever, many thinkers of the seventeenth century doubted the truth\r\nof this long-established belief. Francesco Redi (1626-1698) made a\r\nnumber of experiments which tended to prove that maggots did not\r\narise spontaneously in meat, as was generally believed, but developed\r\nonly when flies had an opportunity to deposit their eggs on the\r\nmeat. It seems that by the latter part of this century the idea that\r\norganisms large enough to be seen with the naked eye could originate\r\nspontaneously was generally abandoned by learned men.\r\n\r\nThe work of Leeuwenhoek served to suspend for a time the subject of\r\nspontaneous generation, only to have it revived more vigorously later\r\non. He is usually called “The Father of the Microscope,” though the\r\ncompound microscope was invented probably by Hans Zansz or his son\r\nZacharias, of Holland, about 1590. Leeuwenhoek used a simple lens,\r\nbut his instruments were so much more powerful that they opened up an\r\nentirely new and unknown world. (Fig. 1.)\r\n\r\nAnthony van Leeuwenhoek (1632-1723) was apprenticed to a linen draper\r\nand accumulated a comfortable fortune in this business. He became\r\ninterested in the grinding of spectacle lenses, then an important\r\nindustry in Delft, Holland, where he lived, and did a great deal of\r\nexperimental work in this line, mainly for his own enjoyment. Finally\r\nhe succeeded in making a lens so powerful that he could see in water\r\nand various infusions very minute living bodies never before observed.\r\nLeeuwenhoek contributed 112 papers to the Royal Society of Great\r\nBritain, the first in 1673, many of them accompanied by such accurate\r\ndescriptions and drawings, for example a paper submitted September\r\n12, 1683, that there is no doubt that he really saw bacteria and was\r\nthe first to do so (Fig. 2). Rightly may he be styled “The Father\r\nof Bacteriology,” if not of the microscope. He says in one paper:\r\n“With the greatest astonishment I observed that everywhere through\r\nthe material I was examining were distributed _animalcules_ of the\r\nmost microscopic dimness which moved themselves about in a remarkably\r\nenergetic way.” Thus he considered these living objects to be animals,\r\nfrom their motion, and this belief held sway for nearly two hundred\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Leeuwenhoek’s Microscope. A is the simple\r\nbi-convex lens held firmly in place. In front of this is the small\r\ntable, B, with the support, C, on the tip of which the object to be\r\nexamined was held. This support could be brought nearer to or removed\r\nfurther away from the lens and held firmly in place by the screw, D.\r\nE is a second screw for raising or lowering the entire table. A concave\r\nmirror that Leeuwenhoek sometimes used to focus more light on the\r\nobject under examination, is shown at the right.]\r\n\r\nLeeuwenhoek was a pure observer of facts and made no attempt at\r\nspeculation, but his discoveries soon started the theorists to\r\ndiscussing the origin of these minute organisms. Most observers, as\r\nwas probably to be expected, believed that they arose spontaneously.\r\nNeedham, in 1749, described the development of microörganisms\r\naround grains of barley in water. Bonnet, in 1768, suggested that\r\nprobably Needham’s animalcules came from ova in the liquid. The Abbot\r\nSpallanzani, in 1769, called attention to the crudeness of Needham’s\r\nmethods and later, in 1776, attempted to disprove spontaneous origin\r\nby heating infusions of organic material in flasks and then _sealing_\r\nthem. His critics raised the objections that heating the liquids\r\ndestroyed their ability to support life, and that sealing prevented\r\nthe access of fresh air which was also necessary. The first objection\r\nwas disproved by the accidental cracking of some of the flasks which\r\nthereafter showed an abundant growth. This accident seemed also to\r\nsupport the second objection, and Spallanzani did not answer it. Though\r\nSpallanzani’s experiments failed to convince his opponents, they led to\r\nimportant practical results, since François Appert, in 1810, applied\r\nthem to the preserving of fruits, meats, etc., and in a sense started\r\nthe modern canning industry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--The first drawings of bacteria by Leeuwenhoek.\r\nThe dotted line _C-D_ indicates the movement of the organism.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Schultze’s experiment. The set of bulbs next to\r\nthe face contained KOH and the other set concentrated H₂SO₄. Air was\r\ndrawn through at frequent intervals from May until August but no growth\r\ndeveloped in the boiled infusion.]\r\n\r\nFrom Spallanzani to Schultze, there were no further experiments to\r\nprove or disprove spontaneous generation. Schultze, in 1836, attempted\r\nto meet the second objection to Spallanzani’s experiment, _i.e._,\r\nthe exclusion of air, by drawing air through his boiled infusions,\r\nfirst causing it to bubble through concentrated sulphuric acid to\r\nkill the “germs” (Fig. 3.). His flasks fortunately showed no growths,\r\nbut his critics claimed that the strong acid changed the properties\r\nof the air so that it would not support life. This experiment of\r\nSchultze’s, though devised for a different purpose, was really the\r\nfirst _experiment_ in the use of _chemical disinfectants_, though\r\nThaer (page 31) had used chemicals in a practical way. Schwann, in\r\n1837, modified this experiment, by drawing the air through a tube\r\nheated to destroy the living germs (Fig. 4). His experiments were\r\nsuccessful but the “spontaneous generation” theorists raised the same\r\nobjection, _i.e._, the change in the air by heating. This was the first\r\n_experiment_ in which the principle of “_dry heat_” or “_hot air_”\r\nsterilization was used. Similar arguments were brought forward, also\r\nto the use of _cotton plugs_ as filters by Schroeder and Dusch in 1859\r\n(Fig. 5). This was the first use of the principle of _sterilization by\r\nfiltration_. It remained for Chevreuil and Pasteur to overcome this\r\nobjection in 1861 by the use of flasks with long necks drawn out to a\r\npoint and bent over. These permitted a full access of air by diffusion\r\nbut kept out living germs, since these cannot fly but are carried\r\nmechanically by air currents or fall of their own weight (Fig. 6.).\r\nHoffman, the year before (1860), had made similar experiments but these\r\nremained unnoticed. The Pasteur flasks convinced most scientists that\r\n“spontaneous generation” has never been observed by man, though some\r\nfew, notably Dr. Charlton Bastian, of England, vigorously supported the\r\ntheory from the early seventies until his death in November, 1915.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--Schwann’s experiment. After boiling, as shown\r\nin the diagram, and cooling, air was drawn into the flask by aspiration\r\nwhile the coiled tube was kept hot with the flame.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--Schroeder and Dusch’s experiment. The\r\naspirating bottle drew the air through the flask after it had been\r\nfiltered by the cotton in the tube.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--Pasteur’s flask.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--Tyndall’s box. One side is removed to show\r\nthe construction. The bent tubes at the top are to permit a free\r\ncirculation of air into the interior. The window at the back has one\r\ncorresponding in the front (removed). Through these the beam of light\r\nsent through from the lamp at the side was observed. The three tubes\r\nreceived the infusion and were then boiled in an oil bath. The pipette\r\nwas for filling the tubes. (Popular Science Monthly, April, 1877.).]\r\n\r\nJohn Tyndall, in combating Bastian’s views showed that boiled infusions\r\nleft open to the air in a closed box through which air circulated\r\ndid not show any growth of organisms provided the air was so free of\r\nparticles that the path of a ray of light sent through it from side to\r\nside could not be seen (Fig. 7). Or if such sterilized infusions were\r\nexposed to dust-free air, as in the high Alps, the majority showed\r\nno growth, while all infusions in dusty air did show an abundance of\r\norganisms. Tyndall’s experiments confirmed those of Pasteur and his\r\npredecessors and showed that the organisms developed from “germs”\r\npresent in the air falling into the liquids and not spontaneously.\r\n\r\nWhile Tyndall’s experiments were of great value as indicated, they\r\nprobably were harmful in another way. These “germs in the air” were\r\nconsidered by bacteriologists as well as laymen to include necessarily\r\nmany _disease germs_ and to indicate the very general, if not\r\nuniversal, presence of these latter _in the air_. This idea led to many\r\nerroneous practices in sanitation and disinfection which even to this\r\nday are not eliminated.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUSATION OF DISEASE.\r\n\r\nThe transmission of disease from person to person was recognized by the\r\nancients of European and Asiatic countries. Inoculation of smallpox was\r\npracticed in China and India probably several thousand years ago and\r\nwas introduced by Lady Mary Wortley Montague into England in 1721, from\r\nConstantinople. These beliefs and practices do not seem to have been\r\nassociated with any speculations or theories as to the cause of the\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nApparently the first writer on this subject was Varo, about B.C. 70,\r\nwho suggested that fevers in swampy places were due to invisible\r\norganisms. The treatment of wounds during the thirteenth and fourteenth\r\ncenturies by hot wine fomentations and by the application of plasters\r\nwas based on the theory that the _air_ brought about conditions in the\r\nwounds which led to suppuration. These practices were indeed primitive\r\nantisepsis, yet were not based on a _germ theory_ of the conditions\r\nwhich were partially prevented. Fracastorius (1484-1553), in a work\r\npublished in 1546, elaborated a theory of “disease germs” and “direct\r\nand indirect contagion” very similar to modern views, though based\r\non no direct pathological knowledge. Nevertheless Kircher (mentioned\r\nalready) is usually given undeserved credit for the “contagium vivum”\r\ntheory. In 1657 by the use of simple lenses he observed “worms” in\r\ndecaying substances, in blood and in the pus from bubonic plague\r\npatients (probably rouleaux of corpuscles in the blood, certainly not\r\nbacteria in any case). Based on these observations and possibly also on\r\nreading the work of Fracastorius, his theory of a “living cause” for\r\nvarious diseases was published in 1671, but received little support.\r\n\r\nThe discoveries of Leeuwenhoek which proved the existence of\r\nmicroscopic organisms soon revived the “contagium vivum” idea of\r\nKircher. Nicolas Andry in a work published in 1701 upheld this view.\r\nLancisi in 1718 advanced the idea that “animalcules” were responsible\r\nfor malaria, a view not proved until Laveran discovered the malarial\r\nparasite in 1880.[1] Physicians ascribed the plague which visited\r\nSouthern France in 1721 to the same cause, and many even went so far as\r\nto attribute all disease to animalcules, which brought the theory into\r\nridicule. Nevertheless the “contagium vivum” theory survived, and even\r\nLinnaeus in his _Systema Naturæ_ (1753-6) recognized it by placing the\r\norganisms of Leeuwenhoek, the contagia of diseases and the causes of\r\nputrefaction and fermentation in one class called “Chaos.”\r\n\r\nPlenciz, a prominent physician and professor in the Vienna Medical\r\nSchool, published in 1762 a work in which he gave strong arguments for\r\nthe “living cause” theory for transmissable diseases. He taught that\r\nthe agent is evidently transmitted through the air and that there is\r\na certain period of incubation pointing to a multiplication within\r\nthe body. He also believed that there was a specific agent for each\r\ndisease. His writings attracted little attention at the time and the\r\n“contagium vivum” theory seems to have been almost lost sight of for\r\nmore than fifty years. Indeed, Oznam, in 1820, said it was no use to\r\nwaste time in refuting hypotheses as to the animal nature of contagium.\r\n\r\nIsolated observers, were, however, keeping the idea alive, each in\r\nhis own locality. In 1787 Wollstein, of Vienna, showed that the pus\r\nfrom horses with glanders could infect other horses if inoculated\r\ninto the skin. Abilgaard, of Copenhagen, made similar experiments at\r\nabout the same time. In 1797 Eric Viborg, a pupil of Abilgaard’s,\r\npublished experiments in which he showed the infectious nature not\r\nonly of the pus but also of the nasal discharges, saliva, urine, etc.,\r\nof glandered horses. Jenner in 1795-98 introduced vaccination as a\r\nmethod of preventing smallpox. This epoch-making discovery attracted\r\nworld wide attention and led to the overcoming of this scourge which\r\nhad devastated Europe for centuries, but contributed little or nothing\r\nto the question of the causation of disease. Prevost’s discovery of\r\nthe cause of grain rust (_Puccinia graminis_) in 1807 was the _first\r\ninstance of an infectious disease of plants_ shown to be _due to a\r\nmicroscopic plant organism_, though not a bacterium in this case.\r\n\r\nDoubtless one reason why the work on glanders and grain rust attracted\r\nlittle attention among the practitioners of human medicine was owing to\r\nthe prevalent belief in man’s complete separation from all lower forms\r\nof life. The evolutionists had not yet paved the way for experimental\r\nmedicine.\r\n\r\nIn 1822 Gaspard showed the poisonous nature of material from infected\r\nwounds by injecting it into animals and causing their death. Tiedemann\r\n(1822), Peacock (1828) described “little bodies” in the muscles of\r\nhuman cadavers which Hilton (1832) considered to be parasitic in\r\nnature. Paget (1835) showed that these bodies were round worms and\r\nOwen (1835) described them more accurately and gave the name _Trichina\r\nspiralis_ to them. Leidy (1846) found organisms in the muscles of\r\nhogs which he considered to be the same as Owen’s Trichina and paved\r\nthe way for the work of Zenker (1860) in showing the pathological\r\nrelation between the Trichina of pork and human Trichinosis. Bearing\r\non the “contagium vivum” theory was the rediscovery of the “itch mite”\r\n(_Sarcoptes scabiei_) by Renucci (1834), an Italian medical student.\r\nThis had been declared several hundred years before but had been lost\r\nsight of. Chevreuil and Pasteur, in 1836, showed that putrefaction did\r\nnot occur in meat protected from contamination, and suggested that\r\nwound infection probably resulted from entrance of germs from without.\r\nBassi, investigating a disease of silkworms in Italy, demonstrated\r\nthat a certain mold-like fungus (_Botrytis bassiana_) was the cause in\r\n1837. This was the _first instance of a microscopic vegetable organism_\r\nproved to be capable of _causing disease in an animal_.\r\n\r\nBoehm, in 1838, observed minute organisms in the stools of cholera\r\npatients and conjectured that they might have a causal connection\r\nwith the disease. Dubini of Milan in 1838 discovered the _Ankylostoma\r\nduodenale_ which later was further described by Omodei in 1843 and\r\nshown to be the cause of Egyptian chlorosis by Griesinger (1851).\r\nThe fungous nature of favus, a scalp disease, was recognized by\r\nSchönlein in 1839, and the organism was afterward called “_Achorion\r\nschoenleinii_.” Berg, in 1839-41, showed that thrush is likewise due to\r\na fungus, “_Oidium albicans_.”\r\n\r\nThese discoveries led Henle, in 1840, to publish a work in which\r\nhe maintained that all contagious diseases must be due to living\r\norganisms, and to propound certain postulates (afterward restated\r\nby Koch and now known as “Koch’s postulates” p. 233) which must be\r\ndemonstrated before one can be sure that a given organism is the\r\nspecific cause of a given disease. The methods then in vogue and the\r\ninstruments of that period did not enable Henle to prove his claims,\r\nbut he must be given the credit for establishing the “contagium vivum”\r\ntheory on a good basis and pointing the way for men better equipped to\r\nprove its soundness in after years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE II\r\n\r\nSIR JOSEPH LISTER]\r\n\r\nIn 1842-43 Gruby showed that Herpes tonsurans, a form of ringworm, is\r\ndue to the fungus _Trichophyton tonsurans_. Klencke, in 1843, produced\r\ngeneralized tuberculosis in a rabbit by injecting tuberculous material\r\ninto a vein in the ear, but did not carry his researches further.\r\nIn 1843, Doctor Oliver Wendell Holmes wrote a paper in which he\r\ncontended that puerperal fever was contagious. Liebert identified the\r\n_Peronospora infestans_ as the cause of one type of potato rot in 1845.\r\nThe skin disease Pityriasis (tinea) versicolor was shown to be due to\r\nthe _Microsporon furfur_ by Eichstedt in 1846. In 1847 Semmelweiss of\r\nVienna recommended disinfection of the hands with chloride of lime by\r\nobstetricians because he believed with Holmes in the transmissibility\r\nof puerperal fever through poisons carried in this way from the\r\ndissecting room but his theories were ridiculed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE III\r\n\r\nROBERT KOCH]\r\n\r\nPollender, in 1849, and Davaine and Rayer, in 1850, independently\r\nobserved small rod-like bodies in the blood of sheep and cattle\r\nwhich had died of splenic fever (anthrax). That Egyptian chlorosis,\r\nafterward identified with Old World “hookworm disease,” is caused by\r\nthe _Ankylostoma duodenale_ was shown by Greisinger in 1851. In the\r\nsame year the _Schistosomum hematobium_ was shown to be the cause\r\nof the “Bilharzia disease” by Bilharz. Küchenmeister discovered the\r\ntapeworm, _Tænia solium_, in 1852, Cohn, an infectious disease of\r\nflies due to a parasitic fungus (_Empusa muscæ_) in 1855, and Zenker\r\nshowed the connection between trichinosis of pork (“measly pork”)\r\nand human trichinosis (1860) as indicated above. The organisms just\r\nmentioned are, of course, not bacteria, but these discoveries proved\r\nconclusively that _living things of one kind or another, some large,\r\nmost of them microscopic, could cause disease in other organisms_ and\r\nstimulated the search for other “living contagiums.” In 1863 Davaine,\r\nalready mentioned, showed that anthrax could be transmitted from\r\nanimal to animal by inoculation of blood, but only if the blood\r\ncontained the minute rods which he believed to be the cause. Davaine\r\nlater abandoned this belief because he transmitted the disease with\r\nold blood in which he could find no rods. It is now known that this\r\nwas because the bacilli were in the “spore” form which Davaine did not\r\nrecognize. He thus missed the definite proof of the bacterial nature\r\nof anthrax because he was not familiar with the life history of the\r\norganism which was worked out by Koch thirteen years later. In 1865\r\nVillemin repeatedly caused tuberculosis in rabbits by subcutaneous\r\ninjection of tuberculous material and showed that this disease must be\r\ninfectious also. In the same year Lord Lister introduced antiseptic\r\nmethods in surgery. He believed that wound infections were due to\r\nmicroörganisms getting in from the air, the surgeon’s fingers, etc.,\r\nand without proving this, he used carbolic acid to kill these germs\r\nand prevent the infection. His pioneer experiments made modern surgery\r\npossible. In this year also, Pasteur was sent to investigate a disease,\r\nPebrine, which was destroying the silkworms in Southern France. He\r\nshowed the cause to be a protozoan which had been seen previously by\r\nCornalia and described by Nägeli under the name _Nosema bombycis_ and\r\ndevised preventive measures. This was the _first infectious disease_\r\nshown to be _due to a protozoan_. In 1866 Rindfleisch observed small\r\npin-point-like bodies in the heart muscle of persons who had died\r\nof wound infection. Klebs, in 1870-71, published descriptions and\r\nnames of organisms he had found in the material from similar wounds,\r\nthough he did not establish their causal relation. Bollinger, in\r\n1872, discovered the spores of anthrax and explained the persistence\r\nof the disease in certain districts as due to the resistant spores.\r\nIn 1873 Obermeier observed in the blood of patients suffering from\r\nrecurrent fever long, flexible spiral organisms which have been named\r\n_Spirochæta obermeieri_. Lösch ascribed tropical dysentery to an ameba,\r\nnamed by him _Amœba coli_, in 1875. Finally, Koch, in 1876, isolated\r\nthe anthrax bacillus, worked out the life history of the organism\r\nand reproduced the disease by the injection of pure cultures and\r\nrecovered the organism from the inoculated animals, thus establishing\r\nbeyond reasonable doubt its causal relationship to the disease. This\r\nwas the _first instance of a bacterium_ proved to be the cause of a\r\n_disease in animals_. Pasteur, working on the disease at the same time,\r\nconfirmed all of Koch’s findings, though his results were published\r\nthe next year, 1877. Bollinger determined that the _Actinomyces bovis_\r\n(_Streptothrix bovis_) is the cause of actinomycosis in cattle in\r\n1877. Woronin in the same year discovered a protozoan (_Plasmodiophora\r\nbrassicæ_) to be the cause of a disease in cabbage, the _first proved\r\ninstance of a unicellular animal causing a disease in a plant_. In 1878\r\nKoch published his researches on wound infection in which he showed\r\nbeyond question that microörganisms are the cause of this condition,\r\nthough Pasteur in 1837, had suggested the same thing and Lister had\r\nacted on the theory in preventing infection.\r\n\r\nThese discoveries, especially those of Koch, immediately attracted\r\nworld-wide attention and stimulated a host of workers, so that within\r\nthe next ten years most of the bacteria which produce disease in\r\nmen and animals were isolated and described. It is well to remember\r\nthat the first _specific_ disease of man proved to be caused by a\r\n_bacterium_ was _tuberculosis_, by Koch in 1882.\r\n\r\nProgress was greatly assisted by the introduction of anilin dyes as\r\nsuitable stains for organisms by Weigert in 1877, by Koch’s application\r\nof special technic and gelatin cultures for isolation and study, 1881,\r\nand the great improvements in the microscope by Prof. Abbé, of Jena.\r\n\r\nLaveran’s discovery of the malarial parasite in 1880 turned attention\r\nto protozoa as the causes of disease and led to the discovery of the\r\nvarious piroplasmoses and trypanosomiases in man and the lower animals.\r\n\r\nPasteur’s protective inoculations in chicken cholera and anthrax\r\ndirected attention to the possibility of using bacteria or their\r\nproducts as a specific protective or curative means against particular\r\ndiseases. This finally led to the discovery of diphtheria antitoxin by\r\nBehring, and independently by Roux, in 1890, a discovery which opened\r\nup the wide field of immunity which is so persistently cultivated at\r\nthe present time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE IV\r\n\r\nLOUIS PASTEUR]\r\n\r\nWhile the causation of disease by bacteria has probably attracted\r\nmost attention, especially in the popular mind, it should not be\r\nforgotten that this is but one of the numerous ways in which these\r\norganisms manifest their activities, and in a sense it is one of\r\ntheir least-important ways, since other kinds are essential in many\r\nindustries (dairying, agriculture) and processes (sewage purification)\r\nand are even _indispensable for the very existence of all green plants\r\nand hence of animals, including man himself_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUTREFACTION AND FERMENTATION.\r\n\r\nThe idea that there is a certain resemblance between some infectious\r\ndiseases and the processes of putrefaction and fermentation seems to\r\nhave originated during the discussion on spontaneous generation and\r\nthe “contagium vivum” theory which followed Leeuwenhoek’s discoveries.\r\nPlenciz (1762) appears to have first formulated this belief in writing.\r\nHe considered putrefaction to be due to the “animalcules” and said that\r\nit occurred only when there was a coat of organisms on the material\r\nand only when they increased and multiplied. Spallanzani’s experiments\r\ntended to support this view since his infusions did not “spoil” when\r\nboiled and sealed. Appert’s practical application of this idea has been\r\nmentioned.\r\n\r\nThaer, in his _Principles of Rational Agriculture_, published in the\r\nfirst quarter of the nineteenth century, expressed the belief that the\r\n“blue milk fermentation” was probably due to a kind of fungus that\r\ngets in from the air, and stated that he had prevented it by treating\r\nthe milk cellars and vessels, with sulphur fumes or with “oxygenated\r\nhydrochloric acid” (hypochlorous acid).\r\n\r\nIn 1836 Chevreuil and Pasteur showed that putrefaction did not occur\r\nin meat protected from contamination. In 1837 Caignard-Latour, in\r\nFrance, and Schwann, in Germany, independently showed that alcoholic\r\nfermentation in beer and wine is due to the growth of a microscopic\r\nplant, the yeast, in the fermenting wort. C. J. Fuchs described the\r\norganism which is commonly called the “blue milk bacillus” in 1841 and\r\nconjectured that the souring of milk was probably bacterial in origin.\r\nIt remained for Pasteur to prove this in 1857. During the following\r\nsix or seven years Pasteur also proved that acetic acid fermentation,\r\nas in vinegar making, butyric acid fermentation (odor of rancid butter\r\nand old cheese) and the ammoniacal fermentation of urea, so noticeable\r\naround stables, were each due to different species of bacteria. Pasteur\r\nalso, during the progress of this work, discovered the class of\r\norganisms which can grow in the absence of free oxygen--the anaërobic\r\nbacteria. There is no question that Pasteur from 1857 on did more to\r\nlay the foundations of the science of bacteriology than any other\r\none man. Influenced by Pasteur’s work von Hesseling, in 1866, stated\r\nhis belief that the process of cheese ripening, like the souring of\r\nmilk, was associated with the growth of fungi, and Martin also, in\r\n1867, stated that cheese ripening was a process which was akin to\r\nalcoholic, lactic and butyric fermentations. Kette, in 1869, asserted\r\nthe probability of Pasteur’s researches furnishing a scientific basis\r\nfor many processes of change in the soil. In 1873 Schlösing and Müntz\r\nshowed that nitrification must be due to the action of microörganisms,\r\nthough the discovery of the particular ones remained for Winogradsky\r\nin 1889. Thus the belief that fermentation and putrefaction are due to\r\nmicroörganisms was as well established by the early eighties of the\r\nlast century as that similar organisms are the causes of infectious\r\ndiseases.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTUDY OF FORMS.\r\n\r\nAn important part of the scientific knowledge of living organisms is\r\ndependent on a study of their forms and relationships. As has been\r\nstated, Leeuwenhoek considered bacteria to be “animalcules” because\r\nthey showed independent movement. But little attention was paid to\r\nthe natural history of these animalcules for nearly a hundred years\r\nafter Leeuwenhoek. During the last quarter of the eighteenth century,\r\nhowever, workers busied themselves chiefly with the discovery and\r\ndescription of new forms. Among these students were Baron Gleichen,\r\nJablot, Lesser, Reaumur, Hill and others. Müller, of Copenhagen, in\r\n1786 published the first attempt at classification, a most important\r\nstep in the study of these organisms. Müller introduced the terms\r\nMonas, Proteus and Vibrio, which are still in use. Ehrenberg, in his\r\nwork on _Infusoria_, or the organisms found in infusions, published\r\nin 1838, introduced many generic names in use at present, but still\r\nclassed the bacteria with protozoa. Joseph Leidy, the American\r\nnaturalist, considered that the “vibrios” of previous writers were\r\nplants and not “animalcules.” He seems to have been the first to have\r\nmade this distinction (1849). Perty (1852) recognized the presence of\r\nspores in some of his organisms. Ferdinand Cohn (1854) classed the\r\nbacteria among plants. Nägeli (1857) proposed the name “Schizomycetes”\r\nor “fission fungi,” which is still retained for the entire class of\r\nbacteria. Cohn in the years 1872-1875 established classification on\r\na modern basis and added greatly to the knowledge of morphology and\r\nnatural history of bacteria. He described spore formation and the\r\ndevelopment of spores into active bacteria, and showed the close\r\nrelationships as well as differences between the bacteria and the lower\r\nalgæ. Robert Koch was a pupil of Cohn.\r\n\r\nAn examination of the accompanying chronological table will show how\r\nthe investigations and discoveries in connection with “spontaneous\r\ngeneration,” the “contagium vivum” theory and putrefaction and\r\nfermentation must have been mutually suggestive:\r\n\r\n  1546.

While it is not\r\ndifficult to distinguish between the higher plants and higher animals,\r\nit becomes almost, if not quite, impossible to separate the lowest,\r\nforms of life. It is only by the method of resemblances above mentioned\r\nthat a decision is finally reached. It has even been proposed to make a\r\nthird class of organisms neither plants nor animals but midway between\r\nin which the bacteria are included, but such a classification has not\r\nas yet been adopted.\r\n\r\nIn many respects the bacteria are most nearly related to the lowest\r\n_algæ_, since both are unicellular organisms, both reproduce by\r\ntransverse division and the forms of the cell are strikingly similar.\r\nThe bacteria differ in one important respect, that is, they do not\r\ncontain _chlorophyl_, the green coloring matter which enables all\r\nplants possessing it to absorb and break up carbon dioxide in the\r\nlight, and hence belong among the fungi. Bacteria average much smaller\r\nthan even the smallest algæ.\r\n\r\nBacteria are closely connected with the _fission yeasts_ and the\r\n_yeasts_ and _torulæ_. All are unicellular and without chlorophyl. The\r\nbacteria, as has been stated, reproduce by division but the others\r\ncharacteristically by budding or gemmation, though the fission yeasts\r\nalso by division.\r\n\r\nThere is a certain resemblance to the _molds_ in their absence\r\nof chlorophyl. But the molds grow as branching threads and also\r\nhave special fruiting organs for producing spores as a means of\r\nreproduction, neither of which characteristics is found among the\r\n_true_ bacteria. The higher thread bacteria do show true branching\r\nand rudimentary fruiting bodies (Streptothrix) and appear to be a link\r\nconnecting the true bacteria and the molds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--A thread of blue-green algæ.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--A thread of small blue-green algæ.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--A thread of bacteria. Compare with Figs. 8\r\nand 9.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--A chain of spherical blue-green algæ.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--A chain of spherical bacteria.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--A pair of spherical blue-green algæ.]\r\n\r\nFurther the _chemical composition_ of bacteria is more like that of\r\nother fungous plants than of any of the forms classed as animals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--Spherical bacteria. Several pairs are shown.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--Yeast cells. Some show typical budding.]\r\n\r\nThe food of bacteria is always taken up in solution by diffusion\r\nthrough the outer covering of the cell as it is in all plants. Plant\r\ncells never surround and engulf particles of solid food and digest them\r\nwithin the cell as many single-celled animals do, and as the leukocytes\r\nand similar ameboid cells in practically all multicelled animals do.[2]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--A portion of the mycelium of a mold. Note the\r\nlarge size and the branching.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most marked differences between animals and plants is with\r\nrespect to their energy relationships. Plants are characteristically\r\nstorers of energy while animals are liberators of it. Some bacteria\r\nwhich have the power of swimming in a liquid certainly liberate\r\nrelatively large amounts of energy, and in the changes which bacteria\r\nbring about in the material which they use as food considerable heat is\r\nevolved (“heating” of manure, etc.). Nevertheless the evidence is good\r\nthat the bacteria as a class store much more of the energy contained\r\nin the substances actually taken into the body cell as food than is\r\nliberated in any form.\r\n\r\nBacteria do show some resemblance to the protozoa, or single-celled\r\nanimal forms, in that the individuals of each group consist of one cell\r\nonly and some bacteria have the power of independent motion from place\r\nto place in a liquid as most “infusoria” do, but here the resemblance\r\nceases.\r\n\r\nBacteria are among the smallest of organisms, so small that it requires\r\nthe highest powers of the microscope for their successful study, and\r\nthe use of a special unit for their measurement. This unit is the\r\none-thousandth part of a millimeter and is called the micro-millimeter\r\nor micron. Its symbol is the Greek letter _mu_ (µ).\r\n\r\nThe size varies widely among different kinds but is fairly constant in\r\nthe same kind. The smallest described form is said to be only 0.18µ\r\nlong by 0.06µ thick and is just visible with the highest power of the\r\nmicroscope, though it is possible and even probable that there are\r\nforms still smaller which cannot be seen. Some large rare forms may\r\nmeasure 40µ in length, but the vast majority are from 1µ to 4µ or 5µ\r\nlong, and from one-third to one-half as wide.\r\n\r\nFrom the above description a bacterium might be said to be a\r\n_microscopic, unicellular plant, without chlorophyl, which reproduces\r\nby dividing transversely_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\nMORPHOLOGY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nCELL STRUCTURES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _essential_ structures which may by appropriate means be\r\ndistinguished in the bacterial cell are _cell wall_ and _cell\r\ncontents_, technically termed _protoplasm_, cytoplasm. The cell wall is\r\nnot so dense, relatively, as that of green plants, but is thicker than\r\nthe outer covering of protozoa. It is very similar to the cell wall\r\nof other lower fungi. Diffusion takes place readily through it with\r\nvery little selective action on substances absorbed as judged by the\r\ncomparative composition of bacteria and their surrounding medium.\r\n\r\n=Cytoplasm.=--The cytoplasm according to Bütschli and others is\r\nsomewhat different and slightly denser in its outer portion next to the\r\ncell wall. This layer is designated the _ectoplasm_, as distinguished\r\nfrom the remainder of the cell contents, the _endoplasm_. When bacteria\r\nare suddenly transferred from a given medium into one of decidedly\r\n_greater_ density, there sometimes results a contraction of the\r\n_endoplasm_, due to the rapid diffusion of water. This phenomenon is\r\ndesignated _plasmolysis_ (Fig. 17), and is similar to what occurs in\r\nthe cells of higher plants when subjected to the same treatment. This\r\nis one of the methods which may be used to show the different parts of\r\nthe cell just described.\r\n\r\nIf bacteria are suddenly transferred from a relatively dense medium\r\nto one which is of decidedly _less_ density, it occasionally happens\r\nthat water diffuses into the cell and swells up the endoplasm so much\r\nmore rapidly than the cell wall that the latter ruptures and some of\r\nthe endoplasm exudes in the form of droplets on the surface of the cell\r\nwall. This phenomenon is called _plasmoptysis_. Students will seldom\r\nobserve the distinction between cell wall and cell contents, except\r\nthat in examining living bacteria the outer portion appears more highly\r\nrefractive. This is chiefly due to the presence of a cell wall, but is\r\nnot a proof of its existence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--Cells of bacteria showing plasmolysis. The\r\ncell substance of three of the cells in the middle of the chain has\r\nshrunk until it appears as a round black mass. The cell wall shows as\r\nthe lighter area.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--Vacuoles in the bacterial cell. The lighter\r\nareas are vacuoles.]\r\n\r\n=Nucleus.=--Douglas and Distaso[3] summarize the various opinions with\r\nregard to the nucleus in bacteria as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Those who do not admit, the presence of a nucleus or of anything\r\nequivalent to it. (Fischer, Migula, Massart).\r\n\r\n2. Those who consider that the entire bacterial cell is the equivalent\r\nof a nucleus and contains no protoplasm. (Ruzicka).\r\n\r\n3. Those who admit the presence of nuclein but say that this is not\r\nmorphologically differentiated from the protoplasm as a nucleus.\r\n(Weigert).\r\n\r\n4. Those who consider the bacterial protoplasm to consist of a central\r\nendoplasm throughout which the nuclein is diffused and an external\r\nlayer of ectoplasm next to the cell wall. (Bütschli, Zettnow).\r\n\r\n5. Those who say that the bacterial cell contains a distinct nucleus,\r\nat least in most instances. These authors base their claims on staining\r\nwith a Giemsa stain. (Feinberg, Ziemann, Neuvel, Dobell, Douglass and\r\nDistaso).\r\n\r\nThat nucleoproteins are present in the bacterial cell in relatively\r\nlarge amounts is well established. Also that there are other proteins\r\nand that the protoplasm is not all nuclein.\r\n\r\nSome workers as noted above have been able to demonstrate collections\r\nof nuclein by staining, especially in very young cells. In older cells\r\nthis material is in most instances diffused throughout the protoplasm\r\nand can not be so differentiated.\r\n\r\nThe following statement probably represents the generally accepted view\r\nat the present time:\r\n\r\nA nucleus _as such_ is not present in bacterial cells, except in a few\r\nlarge rare forms and in very young cells. _Nuclein_, the characteristic\r\nchemical substance in nuclei, which when aggregated forms the nucleus,\r\nis scattered throughout the cell contents and thus intimately mingled\r\nwith the protoplasm, and cannot be differentiated by staining as in\r\nmost cells.\r\n\r\nThe close association of nuclein and protoplasm may explain the rapid\r\nrate of division of bacteria (Chapter VIII, p. 91).\r\n\r\nThe chemical composition of the bacterial cell is discussed in Chapter\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the _essential_ parts just described the bacterial cell\r\nmay show some of the following _accidental_ structures: _vacuoles_,\r\n_capsules_, _metachromatic granules_, _flagella_, _spores_.\r\n\r\n=Vacuoles.=--_Vacuoles_ appear as clear spaces in the protoplasm when\r\nthe organism is examined in the living condition or when stained very\r\nslightly (Fig. 18). During life these are filled with liquid or gaseous\r\nmaterial which is sometimes waste, sometimes reserve food, sometimes\r\ndigestive fluids. Students are apt to confuse vacuoles with spores (p.\r\n47). Staining is the surest way to differentiate (Chapter XIX, p. 209).\r\nIf vacuoles have any special function, it is an unimportant one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--Bacteria seen within capsules.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--Metachromatic granules in bacteria. The dark\r\nround spots are the granules. The cells of the bacteria are scarcely\r\nvisible.]\r\n\r\n=Capsule.=--The _capsule_ is a second covering outside the cell wall\r\nand probably developed from it (Fig. 19). It is usually gelatinous,\r\nso that bacteria which form capsules frequently stick together\r\nwhen growing in a fluid, so that the whole mass has a jelly-like\r\nconsistency. The term _zoöglœa_ was formerly applied to such masses,\r\nbut it is a poor term and misleading (zoön = an animal) and should\r\nbe dropped. The masses of jelly-like material frequently found on\r\ndecaying wood, especially in rainy weather, are in some cases masses\r\nof capsule-forming bacteria, though a part of the jelly is a product\r\nof bacterial activity, a gum-like substance which lies among the\r\ncapsulated organisms. When these masses dry out, they become tough\r\nand leathery, but it is not to be presumed that capsules are of this\r\nconsistency. On the contrary, they are soft and delicate, though they\r\ncertainly serve as an additional protection to the organism, doubtless\r\nmore by selective absorption than mechanically. Certain bacteria\r\nwhich cause disease form capsules in the blood of those animals which\r\nthey kill and not in the blood of those in which they have no effect\r\n(_Bacterium anthracis_ in guinea pig’s blood and in rat’s blood). The\r\npresence of capsules around an organism can be proved only by staining\r\nthe capsule. Many bacteria when stained in albuminous fluids show a\r\nclear space around them which appears like a capsule. It is due to the\r\ncontraction of the fluid away from the organism during drying.\r\n\r\n=Metachromatic Granules.=--The term “_metachromatic_” is applied to\r\ngranules which in stained preparations take a color different from\r\nthe protoplasm as a whole (Fig. 20). They vary widely in chemical\r\ncomposition. Some of them are glycogen, some fat droplets. Others are\r\nso-called “granulose” closely related to starch but probably not true\r\nstarch. Others are probably nuclein. Of many the chemical composition\r\nis unknown. They are called “Babes-Ernst corpuscles” in certain\r\nbacteria (typhoid bacillus). Since they frequently occur in the ends\r\nof cells the term “polar granules” is also applied. Their presence is\r\nof value in the recognition of but few bacteria (“Neisser granules” in\r\ndiphtheria).\r\n\r\n=Flagellum.=--A _flagellum_ is a very minute thread-like process\r\ngrowing out from the cell wall, probably filled with a strand of\r\nprotoplasm. The vibrations of the flagella move the organism through\r\nthe liquid medium. Bacteria which are thus capable of independent\r\nmovement are spoken of as “motile bacteria.” The actual rate of\r\nmovement is very slight, though in proportion to the size of the\r\norganism it may be considered rapid. Thus Alfred Fischer determined\r\nthat some organisms have a speed for short periods of about 40 cm. per\r\nhour. This is equivalent to a man moving more than 200 miles in the\r\nsame time.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that bacteria which can move about in a liquid have an\r\nadvantage in obtaining food, since they do not need to wait for it to\r\nbe brought to them. This advantage is probably slight.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--A bacterium showing a single flagellum at the\r\nend--monotrichic.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--A bacterium showing a bundle of four flagella\r\nat the end--lophotrichic.]\r\n\r\nAn organism may have only one flagellum at the end. It is then said\r\nto be monotrichic (Fig. 21) (μόνος = alone, single; τριχος = hair).\r\nThis is most commonly at the front end, so that the bacterium is drawn\r\nthrough the liquid by its motion. Rarely it is at the rear end. Other\r\nbacteria may possess a bundle of flagella at one end and are called\r\n_lophotrichic_ (Fig. 22) (λοφος = tuft). Sometimes at approaching\r\ndivision the flagella may be at both ends and are then _amphitrichic_\r\n(Fig. 23) (αμφι = both). It is probable that this condition does not\r\npersist long, but represents the development of flagella at one end\r\nof each of a pair resulting from division of an organism which has\r\nflagella at one end only. In many bacteria the flagella arise from\r\nall parts of the surface of the cell. Such bacteria are _peritrichic_\r\n(Fig. 24) (περι = around). The position and even the number of the\r\nflagella are very constant for each kind and are of decided value in\r\nidentification.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--A bacterium showing flagella at each\r\nend--amphitrichic.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.--A bacterium showing flagella all\r\naround--peritrichic.]\r\n\r\nFlagella are too fine and delicate to be seen on the living organism,\r\nor even on bacteria which have been colored by the ordinary stains.\r\nThey are rendered visible only by certain methods which cause a\r\nprecipitate on both bacteria and flagella which are thereby made thick\r\nenough to be seen (Chapter XIX, p. 210). The movement of liquid around\r\na bacterium caused by vibrations of flagella can sometimes be observed\r\nwith large forms and the use of “dark-field” illumination.\r\n\r\nFlagella are very delicate and easily broken off from the cell body.\r\nSlight changes in the density or reaction of the medium frequently\r\ncause this breaking off, so that preparations made from actively motile\r\nbacteria frequently show no flagella. For this reason and also on\r\naccount of their fineness the demonstration of flagella is not easy,\r\nand it is not safe to say that a non-motile bacterium has no flagella\r\nexcept after very careful study.\r\n\r\nThe motion of bacteria is characteristic and a little practice in\r\nobserving will enable the student to recognize it and distinguish\r\nbetween motility and “Brownian” or molecular motion. Dead and\r\nnon-motile bacteria show the latter. In fact, any finely divided\r\nparticles suspended in a liquid which is not too viscous and in which\r\nthe particles are not soluble show Brownian motion or “pedesis.” This\r\nlatter is a dancing motion of the particle within a very small area\r\nand without change of place, while motile bacteria move from place to\r\nplace or even out of the field of the microscope with greater or less\r\nspeed. There is a marked difference in the character of the motion of\r\ndifferent kinds of bacteria. Some rotate around the long axis when\r\nmoving, others vibrate from side to side.\r\n\r\nAmong the higher thread bacteria there are some which show motility\r\nwithout possessing flagella. Just how they move is little understood.\r\n\r\n=Spores.=--Under certain conditions some bacterial cells undergo\r\ntransformations which result in the formation of so-called _spores_.\r\nIf the process is followed under the microscope, the changes observed\r\nare approximately these: A very minute point appears in the protoplasm\r\nwhich seems to act somewhat like the centrosome of higher cells as a\r\n“center of attraction” so that the protoplasm gradually collects around\r\nit. The spot disappears or is enclosed in the collected protoplasm.\r\nThis has evidently become denser as it is more highly refractive than\r\nbefore. In time all or nearly all of the protoplasm is collected. A new\r\ncell wall is developed around it which is thicker than the cell wall of\r\nthe bacterium. This thickened cell wall is called the “spore capsule.”\r\nGradually the remnants of the former cell contents and the old cell\r\nwall disappear or dissolve and the spore becomes “free” (Fig. 25).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--The smaller oval bodies in the middle of the\r\nfield are free spores.]\r\n\r\nIf the spore is placed in favorable conditions the protoplasm absorbs\r\nwater, swells, the capsule bursts at some point, a cell wall is formed\r\nand the bacterium grows to normal size and divides, that is, it is an\r\nactive growing cell again. This process is called “germination” of the\r\nspore. The point at which the spore capsule bursts to permit the new\r\ncell to emerge is characteristic for each kind of bacterium. It may be\r\nat the end when the germination is said to be _polar_ (Fig. 26). It may\r\nbe from the middle of one side which gives _equatorial_ germination\r\n(Fig. 27). Rarely it is diagonally from a point between the equator and\r\nthe pole, which type may be styled _oblique_ germination. In one or\r\ntwo instances the entire spore swells up, lengthens and becomes a rod\r\nwithout any special germination unless this type might be designated\r\n_bi-polar_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--Spores showing polar germination. The lighter\r\npart of the two organisms just below A and B is the developing\r\nbacterium. In the original slide the spore was stained red and the\r\ndeveloping bacterium a faint blue.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.--A spore showing equatorial germination.\r\nThe spore in the center of the field shows a rod growing out of it\r\nlaterally. In the original slide the spore was stained red and the\r\ndeveloping bacterium blue.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.--Spores in the middle of the rod without\r\nenlargement of the rod. The lighter areas in the rods are spores.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.--Spores in the middle of the rod with\r\nenlargement of the rod around them. The lighter areas in the rods are\r\nspores.]\r\n\r\nSpores are most commonly oval or elliptical in shape, though sometimes\r\nspherical. A spore may be formed in the middle of the organism without\r\n(Fig. 28) or with (Fig. 29) a change in size of the cell around it.\r\nIf the diameter through the cell is increased, then the cell with\r\nthe contained spore becomes spindle-shaped. Such a cell is termed a\r\n“_clostridium_.” Sometimes the spore develops in the end of the cell\r\neither without (Fig. 30) or with enlarging it (Fig. 31). In a few\r\nforms the spore is placed at the end of the rod and shows a marked\r\nenlargement. This is spoken of as the “_plectridium_” or more commonly\r\nthe “drumstick spore” (Fig. 32). The position and shape of the spore\r\nare constant for each kind of bacteria. In one or two instances only,\r\ntwo spores have been observed in a single organism.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.--Spores in the end of the rod with no\r\nenlargement of the rod around them. The lighter areas in the rods are\r\nspores.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.--Spores in the end of the rod with enlargement\r\nof the rod, _A_, _A_, _A_, _A_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.--Drumstick spores at the end of the rod.]\r\n\r\nThe fact that the protoplasm is denser and the spore capsule thicker\r\n(the percentage of water in each is decidedly less than in the growing\r\ncell) gives the spore the property of much greater resistance to all\r\ndestructive agencies than the active bacterium has. For example, all\r\nactively growing cells are destroyed by boiling in a very few minutes,\r\nwhile some spores require several hours’ boiling. The same relation\r\nholds with regard to drying, the action of chemicals, light, etc. That\r\nthe coagulation temperature of a protein varies inversely with the\r\namount of water, it contains, is shown by the following table from\r\nFrost and McCampbell, “General Bacteriology”:\r\n\r\n  Egg albumin plus 50 per cent. water coagulates at  56°\r\n   „     „     „   25 per cent.   „       „      „   74-80°\r\n   „     „     „   18 per cent.   „       „      „   88-90°\r\n   „     „     „    6 per cent.   „       „      „  145°\r\n   „     „    dry                 „       „      „  160-170°\r\n\r\nThis resistance explains why it happens that food materials boiled\r\nand sealed in cans to prevent the entrance of organisms sometimes\r\nspoil. The spores have not been killed by the boiling. It explains\r\nalso in part the persistence of some diseases like anthrax and black\r\nleg in pastures for years. From the above description it follows that\r\nthe spore is to be considered as _a condensation of the bacterial\r\nprotoplasm surrounded by an especially thick cell wall_. _Its function\r\nis the preservation of the organism under adverse conditions._ It\r\ncorresponds most closely to the encystment of certain protozoa--the\r\nameba for example. Possibly the spore represents a very rudimentary\r\nbeginning of a reproductive function such as is gradually evolved in\r\nthe higher thread bacteria, the fission yeasts, the yeasts, the molds,\r\netc. Its characteristics are so markedly different, however, that the\r\nfunction of preservation is certainly the main one.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that spores are formed under adverse conditions\r\nonly, because bacteria showing vigorous growth frequently form spores\r\nrapidly. Special conditions are necessary for their formation just as\r\nthey are for the growth and other functions of bacteria (Chapters VI\r\nand VII).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nCELL FORMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThough there is apparently a wide variation in the shapes of different\r\nbacterial cells, these may all be reduced to _three_ typical _cell\r\nforms_. These are: first and simplest, the round or _spherical_,\r\ntypified by a ball and called the _coccus_ form, or _coccus_, plural\r\ncocci[4] (Fig. 33). The coccus may be large, that is, from 1.5µ to 2µ\r\nin diameter. The term _macrococcus_ is sometimes applied to these large\r\ncocci. If the _coccus_ is less than 1µ in diameter, it is sometimes\r\nspoken of as a _micrococcus_; in fact, this term is very commonly\r\napplied to any coccus. When cocci are growing together, many of the\r\ncells do not appear as true spheres but are more or less distorted\r\nfrom pressure of their neighbors or from failure to grow to full size\r\nafter recent division. Most cocci divide into hemispheres and then each\r\nhalf grows to full size. A few cocci elongate before division and then\r\nappear oval or elliptical.\r\n\r\nThe second cell form is that of a _cylinder_ or rod typified by a\r\nsection of a lead-pencil. The name _bacillus_, plural _bacilli_, is\r\napplied to this type (Fig. 34). The bacillus may be short (Fig. 35),\r\n1µ or less in length, or long, up to 40µ in rare cases. Most bacilli\r\nare from 2µ to 5µ or 6µ long. The ends of the rod are usually rounded,\r\noccasionally square and very rarely pointed. It is evident that a very\r\nshort rod with rounded ends approaches a coccus in form and it is not\r\nalways easy to differentiate in such cases. Most bacilli are straight,\r\nbut some are slightly curved (Fig. 36).\r\n\r\nThe third cell form is the _spiral_, typified by a section of a\r\ncork-screw and named _spirillum_, plural _spirilla_ (Fig. 37). A very\r\nshort spiral consisting of only a portion of a turn is sometimes called\r\n_vibrio_ (Fig. 38). Vibrios when seen under the microscope look like\r\nshort curved rods. The distinction between the two can be made only by\r\nexamining the organism alive and moving in a liquid. The vibrio shows a\r\ncharacteristic spiral twisting motion. Very long, flexible spirals are\r\nusually named _spirochetes_ (Fig. 39). The spirochetes are motile but\r\nflagella have not been shown to be present.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.--Cocci.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.--Bacilli.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.--Short bacilli.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.--Curved bacilli. Only the one in the center of\r\nthe field is in focus. The others curve out of focus.]\r\n\r\nBesides the three typical cell forms bacteria frequently show\r\nvery great irregularities in shape. They may be pointed, bulged,\r\nclub-shaped or even slightly branched. These peculiar and bizarre\r\nforms practically always occur when some of the necessary conditions\r\nfor normal growth, discussed in Chapters VI and VII, are not fulfilled.\r\nThey are best regarded as _involution_ or _degeneration_ forms for this\r\nreason (Fig. 40). In a very few cases it is not possible to obtain the\r\norganism without these forms (the diphtheria group). It is probable\r\nthat these cell forms are normal in such cases, or else conditions\r\nsuitable for the normal growth have not been obtained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.--Spirilla.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.--Vibrio forms of spirilla. Compare with Fig.\r\n36.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.--Spirochetes.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.--Involution forms. The organisms are tapering\r\nand branched at one end.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\nCELL GROUPINGS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that bacteria reproduce by transverse division, that\r\nis, division across the long axis. Following repeated divisions the new\r\ncells may or may not remain attached. In the latter case the bacteria\r\noccur as separate isolated individuals. In the former, arrangements\r\ncharacteristic of the particular organism almost invariably result.\r\nThese arrangements are best described as _cell groupings_ or _growth\r\nforms_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.--Streptospirillum grouping.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.--Diplobacillus grouping.]\r\n\r\nIn the case of spiral forms it is obvious that there is only one\r\npossible grouping, that is, in chains of two or more individuals\r\nadherent end to end. A chain of two spirilla might be called\r\na _diplospirillum_ (διπλός = double); of three or more, a\r\n_streptospirillum_ (στρεπτός = necklace, chain) (Fig. 41). These terms\r\nare rarely used, since spirilla do not ordinarily remain attached.\r\nLikewise the bacillus can grow only in chains of two or more, and\r\nthe terms _diplobacillus_ (Fig. 42), bacilli in groups of two, and\r\n_streptobacillus_ (Fig. 43), bacilli in chains are frequently used.\r\nStill the terms _thread_, _filament_, or _chain_ are more common for\r\n_streptobacillus_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.--Streptobacillus grouping.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.--Typical diplococcus grouping. Note that the\r\nindividual cocci are flattened on the apposing sides.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.--Long streptococcus grouping.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.--Short streptococcus grouping.]\r\n\r\nSince the coccus is spherical, _transverse_ division may occur in any\r\ndirection, though in three planes only at right angles to each other.\r\nDivision might occur in _one plane only_ as in spirilla and bacilli,\r\nor in _two planes only_ or in _all three planes_. As a matter of fact\r\nthese three methods of division are found among the cocci, but only one\r\nmethod for each particular kind of coccus. As a result there may be a\r\nvariety of cell groupings among the cocci. When division occurs in one\r\nplane only, the possible groupings are the same as among the spirilla\r\nor bacilli. The cocci may occur in groups of two--_diplococcus_\r\ngrouping (Fig. 44), or in chains--_streptococcus_ grouping (Figs. 45\r\nand 46). When the grouping is in _diplococci_, the individual cocci\r\nmost commonly appear as hemispheres with the plane surfaces apposed\r\n(Fig. 44). Sometimes they appear as spheres and occasionally are even\r\nsomewhat elongated. The individuals in a streptococcus grouping are\r\nmost commonly elongated, either in the same direction as the length of\r\nthe chain, or at right angles to it. The latter appearance is probably\r\ndue to failure to enlarge completely after division. Streptococci\r\nfrequently appear as chains of diplococci, that is, the pair resulting\r\nfrom the division of a single coccus remain a little closer to each\r\nother than to neighboring cells, as a close inspection of Fig. 45 will\r\nshow.\r\n\r\nIf division occurs in _two planes only_, there may result the above\r\ngroupings and several others in addition. The four cocci which result\r\nfrom a single division may remain together, giving the _tetracoccus_\r\nor _tetrad_ grouping. Very rarely all the cocci divide evenly and the\r\nresult is a regular _rectangular flat mass_ of cells, the total number\r\nof which is a multiple of four. The term merismopedia (from a genus of\r\nalgæ which grows the same way) is applied to such a grouping. If the\r\ncells within a group after a few divisions do not reproduce so rapidly\r\n(lack of food), as usually happens, the number of cells becomes uneven\r\nor at least not necessarily a multiple of four and the resultant _flat\r\nmass_ has an _irregular_, _uneven outline_. This grouping is termed\r\n_staphylococcus_ (σταφυλος = a bunch of grapes) (Fig. 47). It is the\r\nmost common grouping among the cocci.\r\n\r\nWhen division occurs in all three planes, there is in addition to all\r\nthe groupings possible to one- and two-plane division a third grouping\r\nin which the cells are in _solid packets_, _multiples of eight_. The\r\nname _sarcina_ is applied to this growth form (Fig. 48). The individual\r\ncells in a sarcina packet never show the typical coccus form so long as\r\nthey remain together, but are always flattened on two or more sides.\r\n\r\nThe above descriptions indicate how the method of division may be\r\ndetermined. If in examining a preparation the _sarcina_ grouping\r\nappears, that shows _three-plane division_. If there are no sarcina,\r\nbut _tetrads_ or _staphylococci_ (rarely merismopedia), then the\r\ndivision is in _two planes_. If none of the foregoing is observed but\r\nonly _diplo-_ or _streptococci_, these indicate _one-plane division_\r\nonly. Cocci show their _characteristic_ groupings only when grown in a\r\nliquid medium, and such should always be used before deciding on the\r\nplane of division.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.--Staphylococcus grouping. The large flat masses\r\nare staphylococcus grouping. Diplococcus grouping, tetrads and short\r\nstreptococci are also evident.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.--Sarcina grouping.]\r\n\r\nAs the above description shows, these terms which are properly\r\nadjectives describing the cell grouping, are quite generally used as\r\nnouns. Thus the terms a diplococcus, a tetrad, a streptococcus, etc.,\r\nare common, meaning a bacterium of the cell form and cell grouping\r\nindicated.\r\n\r\n    CELL FORM.

For animal forms and for the\r\nhigher plants this classification is gradually becoming standardized\r\nthrough the International Congress of Zoölogists and of Botanists\r\nrespectively. Unfortunately, the naming of the bacteria has not as\r\nyet been taken up by the latter body, though announced as one of the\r\nsubjects for the Congress of 1916 (postponed on account of the war).\r\nHence there is at present no system which can be regarded as either\r\nfixed or official.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.--Illustrates the genus Streptococcus. Typical\r\nchains, no staphylococcus grouping, no sarcina grouping, no flagella.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.--Illustrates the genus Micrococcus.\r\nDiplococcus, tetrads short chains and staphylococcus; no sarcina, no\r\nflagella.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.--Illustrates the genus Sarcina. Sarcina\r\ngrouping, no flagella.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.--Illustrates the genus Bacillus. A bacillus\r\nwith peritrichic flagella. (Student preparation.)]\r\n\r\nSince Müller’s first classification of “animalcules” in 1786 numerous\r\nattempts have been made to solve the problem. Only those beginning with\r\nFerdinand Cohn (1872-75) are of any real value. As long as bacteria\r\nare regarded as plants it appears that the logical method is to follow\r\nthe well-established botanical principles in any system for naming\r\nthem. Botanists depend on morphological features almost entirely in\r\nmaking their distinctions. The preceding chapters have shown that\r\nthe minute plants which are discussed have very few such features.\r\nThey are, to recapitulate, _cell wall_, _protoplasm_, _vacuoles_,\r\n_metachromatic granules_, _capsules_, _flagella_, _spores_, _cell\r\nforms_ and _cell groupings_. Most bacteria show not more than three\r\nor four of these features, so that it is impossible by the aid of\r\nmorphology alone to distinguish from each other the large number of\r\ndifferent kinds which certainly exist. In the various systems which\r\nare conceded to be the best these characteristics do serve to classify\r\nthem down to genera, leaving the “species” to be determined from their\r\n_physiological_ activities. One of these systems was adopted by the\r\nlaboratory section of the American Public Health Association and by the\r\nSociety of American Bacteriologists and was practically the standard\r\nin this country until superseded by the Society’s own classification.\r\nIt is that of the German Bacteriologist Migula and is given below for\r\ncomparison. Since practically the entire discussion in this book is\r\nconcerned with the first three families the generic characteristics\r\nin these only will be given. The full classification as well as a\r\nthorough discussion of this subject is given in Lafar’s _Handbuch_,\r\nwhence the following is adopted:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.--Illustrates the genus Pseudomonas. A bacillus\r\nwith flagella at the end only.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.--Illustrates the genus Microspira.

This\r\noutline does not attempt to give the detailed characterizations of the\r\ndifferent groups as defined by the committee, but does show the names\r\nto be applied to the commoner organisms.

They\r\noccur in the air immediately above the surface, since they are carried\r\nup mechanically by air currents. They cannot fly of themselves. There\r\nis no reason to believe that any increase in numbers occurs to an\r\nappreciable extent in the air. The upper air, for example, on high\r\nmountains, is nearly free from them. So also is the air over midocean,\r\nand in high latitudes. As a rule, the greater the amount of dust in\r\nthe air, the more numerous are the bacteria. Hence they are found more\r\nabundantly in the air in cities and towns than in the open country.\r\nThe soil is especially rich in numbers in the upper few feet, but they\r\ndiminish rapidly below and almost disappear at depths of about six\r\nfeet unless the soil is very porous and open, when they may be carried\r\nfarther down. Hence the waters from deep wells and springs are usually\r\ndevoid of these organisms. In the sea they occur at all levels and have\r\nbeen found in bottom ooze dredged from depths of several miles. It is\r\nperhaps needless to add that they are found on the bodies and in the\r\nalimentary tract of human beings and animals; on clothing, utensils;\r\nin dwellings, stables, outhouses, etc. From one-fourth to one-half of\r\nthe dry weight of the feces of animals and men is due to the bacteria\r\npresent. The urine is practically free from them in health.\r\n\r\nWhile bacteria are thus found nearly everywhere, it is an entirely\r\nmistaken idea to suppose that all are injurious to man. As a matter\r\nof fact, those which are dangerous are relatively few and are for the\r\nmost part found only in close association with man. Most bacteria are\r\nharmless and the vast majority are beneficial or even essential to\r\nman’s existence on the earth. These facts must be constantly borne in\r\nmind, and it is hoped that the pages which follow will make them clear.\r\n\r\nIn order that any organism may thrive there are a number of general\r\nenvironmental conditions which must be fulfilled. These conditions\r\nvary more or less for each kind of organism. Bacteria are no exception\r\nto this general rule. These conditions may be conveniently considered\r\nunder the general heads of _moisture_; _temperature_; _light_; _oxygen\r\nsupply_; _osmotic pressure_; _action of electricity_; of _Röntgen_\r\nand _radium rays_; _pressure_; _mechanical vibration_; and _chemical\r\nenvironment_, including the _reaction of the medium_, _the effect\r\nof injurious chemicals_, and especially the _food requirements of\r\nbacteria_. For each of these conditions there is a _maximum_, meaning\r\nthe greatest amount of the given condition which the organism can\r\nwithstand, a _minimum_, or the least amount, and an _optimum_ or that\r\namount which is most favorable for development. Further, there might be\r\ndistinguished a maximum for _mere existence_ and a lower maximum for\r\n_development_; also a minimum for _mere existence_ and a higher minimum\r\nfor _development_. These maxima, minima, and optima for bacteria have\r\nbeen determined with exactness for only a very few of the general\r\nconditions and for comparatively few kinds.\r\n\r\n\r\nMOISTURE.\r\n\r\nThe _maximum_ moisture is absolutely pure water, and no organism can\r\nthrive in this alone owing to the factor of too low osmotic pressure\r\nand to the further factor of absence of food material. There are many\r\nbacteria which thrive in water containing only traces of mineral salts\r\nand a large class whose natural habitat is surface water. These “water\r\nbacteria” are of great benefit in the purification of streams. They are\r\nas a class harmless to men and animals. Some of the disease-producing\r\nbacteria like _Bacterium typhosum_ (of typhoid fever) and _Vibrio\r\ncholeræ_ (of Asiatic cholera) were undoubtedly originally water\r\nbacteria, and it is rather striking that in these diseases conditions\r\nare induced in the intestine (diarrheas) which simulate the original\r\nwatery environment. The _minimum_ moisture condition is absolute\r\ndryness, and no organism can even exist, not to say develop, in such\r\na condition since water is an essential constituent of living matter.\r\nSome bacteria and especially most spores may live when dried in the\r\nair or by artificial means for months and even years, while some are\r\ndestroyed in a few hours or days when dried (typhoid, cholera, etc.).\r\nThe optimum amount of moisture has not been determined with any great\r\naccuracy and certainly a rather wide range in percentage of water is\r\npermissible with many, though a liquid medium is usually most favorable\r\nfor artificial growth. The “water bacteria” have been mentioned. In the\r\nsoil a water content of 5 to 15 per cent. seems to be most suitable for\r\nmany of the organisms which aid in plant growth. In animals and man the\r\norganisms infecting the intestinal tract prefer a high percentage of\r\nmoisture as a rule, especially those causing disease here. Those found\r\non the surface of the body (pus cocci) need a less amount of water,\r\nwhile those invading the tissues (tuberculosis, black-leg, etc.) seem\r\nto be intermediate in this respect. In artificial culture media a water\r\ncontent of less than 30 per cent. inhibits the growth of most bacteria.\r\n\r\nAs a general rule those bacteria which require the largest percentage\r\nof water are most susceptible to its loss and are most readily killed\r\nby drying. The typhoid and cholera organisms die in a few hours when\r\ndried, while pus cocci and tubercle bacilli live much longer.\r\n\r\n\r\nTEMPERATURE.\r\n\r\nThe temperature conditions for bacterial existence and growth have been\r\ndetermined more accurately than any of the other general conditions.\r\nThe maximum for existence must be placed at or near 100° since it is\r\nknown that all bacteria including spores may be killed by boiling in\r\ntime. Nevertheless, certain forms have been reported as thriving in hot\r\nsprings where the water temperature was 93°. This is the highest known\r\ntemperature for development. The minimum for existence lies at or near\r\nthe absolute zero (-273°) since certain organisms have been subjected\r\nto the temperature produced by the sudden evaporation of liquid\r\nhydrogen (-256° to -265°) and have remained alive. Whether they could\r\nwithstand such temperatures indefinitely is not known. The minimum for\r\ndevelopment is near the freezing-point of water, since reproduction\r\nby division has been observed in the water from melting sea-ice at\r\na temperature of -1.5°. Thus bacteria as a class have a range for\r\nexistence of about 373° (-273° to +100°) and for development of 94.5°\r\n(-1.5° to +93°) certainly much wider ranges than any other group of\r\norganisms.[5]\r\n\r\nThe optimum temperature for development varies within rather wide\r\nlimits for different organisms. In general it may be stated that the\r\noptimum temperature is approximately that of the natural habitat of\r\nthe organism, though there are exceptions. The optimum of the “hot\r\nspring” bacteria just mentioned is apparently that of the springs (93°\r\nin this case). Many soil organisms are known whose optimum is near\r\n70° (a temperature rarely, if ever, attained in the soil), _but only\r\nwhen grown in air or oxygen_; but is very much lower when grown in the\r\n_absence of oxygen_. Many other soil organisms exhibit very little\r\ndifference in rate or amount of growth when grown at temperatures which\r\nmay vary as much as 10° or 15°, apparently an adaptation to their\r\nnormal environment. The disease-producing organisms show much narrower\r\nlimits for growth, especially those which are difficult to cultivate\r\noutside the body. For example, the bacterium of tuberculosis in man\r\nscarcely develops beyond the limits of 2° or 3° from the normal body\r\ntemperature of man (37°), while the bacterium of tuberculosis in birds\r\ngrows best at 41° to 45°, the normal for birds, and the bacterium of\r\nso-called tuberculosis of cold-blooded animals at 14° to 18°.\r\n\r\nThose bacteria whose optimum temperature is above 40° are sometimes\r\nspoken of as the “_thermophil_” bacteria. The fixing of the “thermal\r\ndeath-point” that is, the minimum temperature at which the bacteria\r\nare killed is a matter of great practical importance in many ways\r\nand numerous determinations of this have been made with a great many\r\norganisms and by different observers. The factors which enter into such\r\ndeterminations are so many and so varied that unless all the conditions\r\nof the experiment are given together with the time of application,\r\nthe mere statements are worthless. It may be stated that all _young,\r\nactively growing_ (non-spore-containing) _disease-producing bacteria,\r\nwhen exposed in watery liquids and in small quantities are killed at\r\na temperature of 60° within half an hour_. It is evident, that this\r\nfact has very little practical application, since the conditions stated\r\nare rarely, if ever, fulfilled except in laboratory experiments. (See\r\nSterilization and Pasteurization, Chapter XIII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nLIGHT.\r\n\r\nSpeaking generally, it can be said that light is destructive to\r\nbacteria. Many growing forms are killed in a few hours when properly\r\nexposed to direct sunlight and die out in several days in the diffuse\r\ndaylight of a well-lighted room. Even spores are destroyed in a\r\nsimilar manner, though the exposure must be considerably longer.\r\nCertain bacteria which produce colors may grow in the light, since\r\nthe pigments protect them. Some few kinds, like the sulphur bacteria,\r\nwhich contain a purplish-red pigment that serves them to break up\r\nH₂S, need light for their growth. Since disease-producing bacteria\r\nare all injuriously affected by light, the advantage of well-lighted\r\nhabitations both for men and animals is obvious.\r\n\r\n\r\nOXYGEN SUPPLY.\r\n\r\nOxygen is one of the constituents of protoplasm and is therefore\r\nnecessary for all organisms. This does not mean that all organisms\r\nmust obtain their supply from _free oxygen_, however, as animals and\r\nplants generally do. This fact is well illustrated by the differences\r\namong bacteria in this respect. Some bacteria _require free oxygen_ for\r\ntheir growth and are therefore called _aërobic_ bacteria or _aërobes_\r\n(sometimes _strict aërobes_, though the adjective is unnecessary).\r\nOthers _cannot grow in the presence of free oxygen_ and are therefore\r\nnamed _anaërobic bacteria_ or _anaërobes_ (strict is unnecessary).\r\nThere are still other kinds which may grow either in the presence of\r\nfree oxygen or in its absence, hence the term _facultative anaërobes_\r\n(usually) is applied to them. The distinction between _facultative\r\naërobe_ and _facultative anaërobe_ might be made. The former means\r\nthose which grow best in the absence of free oxygen, though capable of\r\ngrowing in its presence, while the latter term means those which grow\r\nbest in the presence of free oxygen, but are capable of growing in its\r\nabsence. The amount of oxygen in the atmosphere in which an organism\r\ngrows may be conveniently expressed in terms of the oxygen pressure,\r\n_i.e._, in millimeters of mercury. It is evident that the maximum,\r\nminimum and optimum oxygen pressures for anaërobic bacteria are the\r\nsame, namely, 0 mm. Hg. This is true only for natural conditions,\r\nsince a number of anaërobic organisms have been gradually accustomed\r\nto increasing amounts of O, so that by this process of training they\r\nfinally grew in ordinary air, that is, at an oxygen pressure of about\r\n150 mm. Hg. (Normal air pressure is 760 mm. Hg. and oxygen makes up\r\none-fifth of the air.) The minimum O pressure for facultative anaërobes\r\nis also 0 mm. Hg. Some experiments have been made to determine the\r\nlimits for aërobes, but on a few organisms only, so that no general\r\nconclusions can be drawn from them. To illustrate: _Bacillus subtilis_\r\n(a common “hay bacillus”) will grow at 10 mm. Hg. pressure but not at 5\r\nmm. Hg. It will also grow in compressed oxygen at a pressure of three\r\natmospheres (2280 mm. Hg.), but not at four atmospheres (3040 mm. Hg.),\r\nthough it is not destroyed.\r\n\r\nParodko has determined the oxygen limits for five common organisms as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n                                                        Minimum\r\n                                 Maximum.            Vol.     Mm.\r\n                      In atmospheres.  Mm. Hg.     per cent.  Hg.\r\n\r\n  _Bacterium          1.94 to 2.51  1474 to 1908  0.00016 = 0.0012\r\n   fluorescens_\r\n  _Sarcina lutea_     2.51 to 3.18  1908 to 2417  0.00015 = 0.0011\r\n  _Proteus vulgaris_  3.63 to 4.35  2749 to 3306      0        0\r\n  _Bacterium coli_    4.09 to 4.84  3108 to 3478      0        0\r\n  _Erythrobacillus    5.45 to 6.32  3152 to 4800      0        0\r\n   prodigiosus_\r\n\r\nThese few instances do not disclose any general principles which may\r\nbe applied either for the growth or for the distinction of aërobes or\r\nfacultative anaërobes.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown that compressed oxygen will kill some bacteria but\r\nthis method of destroying them has little or no practical value. Oxygen\r\nin the form of ozone, O₃, is rapidly destructive to bacteria, and this\r\nfact is applied practically in the purification of water supplies for\r\ncertain cities where the ozone is generated by electricity obtained\r\ncheaply from water power. The same is true of oxygen in the “nascent\r\nstate” as illustrated by the use of hypochlorites for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nIt was stated (p. 74) that certain thermophil bacteria in the soil have\r\nan optimum temperature for growth _in the air_ which is much higher\r\nthan is ever reached in their natural habitat and that they grow at a\r\nmoderate temperature under _anaërobic_ conditions. It has been shown\r\nthat if these organisms are grown with aërobes or facultative anaërobes\r\nthey thrive at ordinary room temperature. These latter organisms by\r\nusing up the oxygen apparently keep the tension low, and this explains\r\nhow such organisms grow in the soil.[6]\r\n\r\n\r\nOSMOTIC PRESSURE.\r\n\r\nLike all living cells bacteria are very susceptible to changes in\r\nthe density of the surrounding medium. If placed in a medium less\r\nconcentrated than their own protoplasm water is absorbed and they\r\n“swell up”; while if placed in a denser medium, water is given off and\r\nthey shrink (plasmoptysis or plasmolysis). Should these differences\r\nbe marked or the transition be sudden, the cell walls may even burst\r\nand the organisms be destroyed. If the differences are not too great\r\nor if the transition is made gradually, the organisms may not be\r\ndestroyed, but will either cease to grow and slowly die out, or will\r\nshow very much retarded growth, or will produce abnormal cell forms.\r\nThis is illustrated in the laboratory in attempting to grow bacteria on\r\nfood material which has dried out. A practical application of osmotic\r\neffects is in the use of a high percentage of sugar in preserving\r\nfruits, etc., and in the salting of meats. Neither the cane-sugar nor\r\nthe common salt themselves injure the bacteria chemically, but by the\r\nhigh concentration prevent their development. In drying material in\r\norder to preserve it there are two factors involved: first, the loss of\r\nwater necessary for growth and second, the increased osmotic pressure.\r\n\r\nIn a medium of greater density diffusion of water is outward from the\r\ncell and this will continue until an equilibrium is established between\r\ncell contents and medium. Food for the organism _must be in solution\r\nand enter the cell by diffusion_. Therefore, growth ceases in a medium\r\ntoo dense, since water to carry food in solution does not enter the\r\ncell.\r\n\r\n\r\nELECTRICITY.\r\n\r\nCareful experimenters have shown that the electric current, either\r\ndirect or alternating, has no direct destructive effect on bacteria.\r\nIn a liquid medium the organisms may be attracted to or repelled\r\nfrom one or the other pole or may arrange themselves in definite\r\nways between the poles (galvanotaxis), but are not injured. However,\r\nelectricity through the _secondary_ effects produced, may be used to\r\ndestroy bacteria. If the passage of the electric current _increases the\r\ntemperature_ of the medium sufficiently, the bacteria will be killed,\r\nor if _injurious chemical substances_ are formed (ozone, chlorine,\r\nacids, bases, etc.), the same result will follow (see Ozone, pp. 77 and\r\n157).\r\n\r\n\r\nRADIATIONS.\r\n\r\nRöntgen or _x_-rays and radium emanations when properly applied to\r\nbacteria will destroy them. The practical use of these agents for\r\nthe direct destruction of bacteria in diseases of man or animals is\r\nrestricted to those cases where they may be applied directly to the\r\ndiseased area, since they are just as injurious to the animal cell\r\nas they are to the bacteria, and even more so. Their skilful use as\r\n_stimuli to the body cells_ to enable them to resist and overcome\r\nbacteria and other injurious organisms or cell growths is an entirely\r\ndifferent function and will not be considered here.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESSURE.\r\n\r\nHydrostatic pressure up to about 10,000 pounds per square inch is\r\nwithout appreciable effect on bacteria as has been shown by several\r\nexperimenters and also by finding living bacteria in the ooze dredged\r\nfrom the bottom of the ocean at depths of several miles.\r\n\r\nPressures from 10,000 to 100,000 pounds show variable effects. Some\r\nbacteria are readily killed and others, even non-spore formers,\r\nare only slightly affected. The time factor is important in this\r\nconnection. The presence of acids, even CO₂, or organic acids, results\r\nin the destruction of most non-spore formers.\r\n\r\n\r\nMECHANICAL VIBRATION.\r\n\r\nVibrations transmitted to bacteria in a liquid may be injurious to them\r\nunder certain circumstances. Some of the larger forms like _Bacillus\r\nsubtilis_ may be completely destroyed by shaking in a rapidly moving\r\nshaking machine in a few hours. Bacteria in liquids placed on portions\r\nof machinery where only a slight trembling is felt, have been found\r\nto be killed after several days. Reinke has shown that the passing of\r\nstrong sound waves through bacterial growths markedly inhibits their\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL ENVIRONMENT.\r\n\r\n\r\nREACTION OF MEDIUM.\r\n\r\nMost bacteria are very susceptible to changes in the degree of acidity\r\nor alkalinity of the medium in which they grow. Some kinds prefer a\r\nslightly acid reaction, some a slightly alkaline, and some a neutral\r\n(with reference to litmus as indicator). The organism which is the\r\ncommonest cause of the souring of milk thrives so well in the acid\r\nmedium it produces that it crowds out practically all other kinds,\r\nthough its own growth is eventually stopped by too much acid. Acid\r\nsoils are usually low in numbers of bacteria and as a consequence\r\nproduce poor crops. The disease-producing bacteria as a class grow best\r\nin a medium which is slightly alkaline.\r\n\r\nAccurate determination of limits have been made on but few organisms.\r\nThe reaction is a most important factor in growing bacteria on\r\nartificial media (see Making of Media, Chapter XVI).\r\n\r\n\r\nINJURIOUS CHEMICAL SUBSTANCES.\r\n\r\n(SEE DISINFECTION AND DISINFECTANTS, Chapter XIII.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL COMPOSITION.\r\n\r\nThe chemical composition is subject to wide variation chiefly for\r\ntwo reasons: First, the cell wall in most instances seems to exert\r\nonly a slight selective action in the absorption of mineral salts\r\nso that their concentration within the cell is very nearly that of\r\nthe surrounding medium. Second, the chief organic constitutents vary\r\nremarkably with the kind and amount of food material available--a\r\nrich protein pabulum increases the protein, a plentiful supply of\r\ncarbohydrates or of fat results in the storing of more fat, especially\r\nand _vice versa_. These facts must be borne in mind in considering the\r\nchemistry of bacteria.\r\n\r\nOf the chemical elements known, only the following seem to be essential\r\nin the structure of bacteria: carbon, hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen,\r\nsulphur, phosphorus, chlorine, potassium, calcium, magnesium, iron,\r\nmanganese. Other elements, as sodium, iodine, silicon, aluminum,\r\nlithium, copper, etc., have been reported by different analysts, but\r\nnone of them can be regarded as essential, except possibly in isolated\r\ninstances.\r\n\r\nThese elements exist in the bacterial cell in a great variety of\r\ncombinations of which the most abundant is _water_. The amount of water\r\nvaries in different species from 75 to 90 per cent. of the total weight\r\nin growing cells, and is less in spores. The amount of _ash_ has been\r\nshown by different observers to vary from less than 2 per cent. to as\r\nmuch as 30 per cent. of the _dry weight_. The following table compiled\r\nfrom various sources will give an idea of the relative abundance of the\r\ndifferent elements in the ash.\r\n\r\n  S  as SO₃         7.64 per cent. (much more in sulphur bacteria)\r\n  P  as P₂O₅       18.14    „      to 73.94 per cent.\r\n  Cl                2.29    „\r\n  K  as K₂O        11.1     „      to 25.59    „\r\n  Ca as CaO        12.64    „      to 14.0     „\r\n  Mg as MgO         0.7     „      to 11.55    „\r\n  Fe as Fe₂O₃       1.0     „      to 8.15     „   (iron bacteria)\r\n  Mn               traces\r\n\r\nAs to the form in which the last six elements in the table exist in\r\nthe cell, little is known. The sulphur and phosphorus are essential\r\nconstituents of various proteins. The high percentage of phosphorus\r\npoints to nuclein compounds as its probable source.\r\n\r\nThe carbon and nitrogen, together with most of the hydrogen and oxygen\r\nnot united as water, make up the great variety of organic compounds\r\nwhich compose the main substances in the bacterial cell.\r\n\r\nIt has already been stated that the essential structures in the\r\nbacterial cell are cell wall and protoplasm, including the nuclein.\r\nThese differ markedly in chemical composition. It is well known that\r\nthe cell walls of green plants consist largely of cellulose and closely\r\nrelated substances.[7] _True cellulose_ has been recognized in but\r\nvery few bacteria. (_Sarcina ventriculi_, Migula; _Mycobacterium\r\ntuberculosis_, Hammerschlag, Dreyfuss, Nishimura; _Bacillus\r\nsubtilis_, Dreyfuss; _Acetobacter xylinum_, Brown; _Acetobacter\r\nacidi oxalici_, Banning; and a few others.) It is certainly not an\r\nimportant constituent of the cell wall in many. On the other hand,\r\n_hemicellulose_ and _gum-like_ substances have been identified in\r\nnumerous organisms of this class as important constituents of the cell\r\nwall and of the capsule which is probably an outgrowth from the latter.\r\nPractically always associated with these substances are compounds\r\ncontaining nitrogen. One of these has been certainly identified as\r\n_chitin_ or a closely similar substance. Chitin is the nitrogenous\r\nsubstance which enters largely into the composition of the hard parts\r\nof insects, spiders and crustaceans. It is an interesting fact to find\r\nthis substance characteristic of these animals in bacteria, as well as\r\nother fungi.\r\n\r\nThough it is extremely difficult to separate the cell wall of bacteria\r\nfrom the cell contents, in the light of our present knowledge it can be\r\nstated that the cell walls are composed of a carbohydrate body closely\r\nrelated to cellulose, though not true cellulose, probably in close\r\ncombination with chitin.\r\n\r\nOf the organic constituents of the cell contents the most abundant are\r\nvarious proteins which ordinarily make up about one-half of the dry\r\nweight of the entire cell. The “Mycoproteid” of Nencki, 1879, and other\r\nearlier workers is deserving of little more than historical interest,\r\nsince these substances were certainly very impure and probably\r\nconsisted of mixtures of several “proteins” in the more recent sense.\r\n\r\nFrom later studies it seems probable that substances resembling\r\nthe albumin of higher forms do not occur in bacteria, at least in\r\nappreciable quantities. Globulin has been reported by Hellmich in an\r\nundetermined bacterium, but is certainly not commonly found. The larger\r\nportion of the protein is of a comparatively simple type, in fact,\r\nconsists of protamins most of which are in combination with nucleic\r\nacid as nucleoprotamins. Practically all recent workers find a high\r\npercentage of nuclein, both actually isolated and as indicated by the\r\namounts of purin bases--xanthin, guanin, adenin--obtained, as well as\r\nby the abundance of phosphorus in the ash, already mentioned. Some of\r\nthese nucleins have been shown to have poisonous properties.\r\n\r\nClosely related to but not identical with the proteins are the enzymes\r\nand toxins which are formed in the cell and exist there as endo-enzymes\r\nor endo-toxins respectively. These substances will be discussed later\r\nunder the heading “Physiological Activities of Bacteria” (Chapter XII).\r\n\r\nCarbohydrates are not commonly present in the cell contents, though\r\nglycogen has been observed in a few and a substance staining blue\r\nwith iodine in one or two others. This latter substance was at first\r\nconsidered to be starch “granulose,” but is probably more closely\r\nrelated to glycogen.\r\n\r\nFats seem to be very generally present. The commoner fats--tri-olein,\r\ntri-palmitin, tri-stearin have been found by many analysts. The\r\n“acid-fast bacteria” are particularly rich in fatty substances,\r\nespecially the higher wax-like fats. Lecithins (phosphorized fats) and\r\ncholesterins (not fats but alcohols) have been repeatedly observed and\r\nprobably occur in all bacteria as products of katabolism.\r\n\r\nOrganic acids and esters occur as cell constituents but will be\r\ndiscussed in connection with their more characteristic occurrences\r\nas products of bacterial activity, as will also pigments which may\r\nlikewise be intracellular in some instances.\r\n\r\nThe following analysis of tubercle bacilli, from de Schweinitz and\r\nDorset, while not intended as typical for all bacteria, still\r\nillustrates the high percentage of protein compounds which undoubtedly\r\noccurs in most, as well as showing the large amount of fatty substance\r\nin a typical “acid-fast” organism:\r\n\r\n                {  8.5 per cent. tuberculinic acid\r\n                { 24.5    „      nucleoprotamin    }\r\n  In the dried  { 23.0    „      neucleoprotein    } 55.8 per cent.\r\n    organisms   {  8.3    „      proteinoid        } protein.\r\n                { 26.5    „      fat and wax\r\n                {  9.2    „      ash\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL ENVIRONMENT (CONTINUED).\r\n\r\n\r\nGENERAL FOOD RELATIONSHIPS. METABOLISM.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing brief review of the chemical composition of the bacterial\r\ncell illustrates the variety of compounds which necessarily occurs,\r\nbut affords no definite clue as to the source of the elements which\r\nenter into these compounds. These elements come from the material\r\nwhich the organism uses as food. Under this term are included elements\r\nor compounds which serve as building material, either for new cell\r\nsubstance or to repair waste, or as sources of energy.\r\n\r\nAn organism which is capable of making use of an element in the free\r\nstate is said to be _prototrophic_ for that particular element.\r\nThus aërobes and facultative anaërobes are prototrophic for O. The\r\n“root-tubercle bacteria” of leguminous and other plants and certain\r\nfree living soil organisms are prototrophic for N.[8]\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the element must be secured from compounds, then\r\nthe organism is _metatrophic_ in respect to the element in question.\r\nShould the compound be inorganic, the term _autotrophic_ is applied\r\nto the organism and _heterotrophic_ if the compound is organic. It is\r\nvery probable that anaërobes, exclusive of a few nitrogen absorbers,\r\nare metatrophic for all the elements they utilize. With the exception\r\nof the anaërobes it seems that all bacteria are _mixotrophic_, that is,\r\nprototrophic for one or two elements and auto- or heterotrophic for the\r\nothers.[9]\r\n\r\nThose bacteria whose food consists of dead material are spoken of as\r\n_saprophytes_, while those whose natural habitat, without reference to\r\ntheir food, is in or on other living organisms are called _parasites_.\r\nThe _host_ is the organism in or on which the parasite lives.\r\nParasites may be of several kinds. Those which neither do injury nor\r\nare of benefit to the host are called _non-pathogenic_ parasites or\r\n_commensals_; many of the bacteria in the intestines of man and other\r\nanimals are of this class. Those which do injury to the host are\r\ncalled _pathogenic_ or disease-producing, as the organisms causing the\r\ntransmissible diseases of animals and plants.[10] Finally, we have\r\nthose parasites which are of benefit to and receive benefit from the\r\nhost. These are called _symbionts_ or _symbiotic parasites_ and the\r\nmutual relationship _symbiosis_. Certain of the intestinal bacteria in\r\nman and especially in herbivorous animals are undoubted _symbionts_, as\r\nare also the “root-tubercle bacteria” already mentioned.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that all parasites that may be cultivated outside\r\nthe body are for the time _saprophytic_, hence the terms _strict_\r\nparasites and _facultative_ parasites, which should require no further\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\nThe changes which the above-mentioned types of food material undergo\r\nin the various anabolic and katabolic processes _within the cell_ are\r\nas yet but very slightly known. Nevertheless there are a number of\r\nreactions brought about by bacteria acting on various food materials,\r\npartly within _but largely without the cell_ which are usually\r\ndescribed as “physiological activities” or “biochemical reactions.”\r\nSome of these changes are to be ascribed to the utilization of certain\r\nof the elements and compounds in these materials as tissue builders,\r\nsome as energy-yielding reactions and still others as giving rise to\r\nsubstances that are of direct benefit to the organism concerned in its\r\ncompetition with other organisms.\r\n\r\nThough all of the twelve elements already mentioned are essential for\r\nthe growth of every bacterium, two of them are of especial importance\r\nfor the reason that most of the “physiological activities” to be\r\ndescribed in the next chapters are centered around their acquisition\r\nand utilization. These elements are _carbon_ and _nitrogen_. Some few\r\nof the special activities of certain groups have to do with one or the\r\nother of the remaining nine, as will be shown later. But generally\r\nspeaking _when a bacterium under natural conditions secures an adequate\r\nsupply of carbon and nitrogen, the other elements are readily available\r\nin sufficient amount_.\r\n\r\nCarbon is necessary not only because it is an essential constituent\r\nof protoplasm but because its oxidation is the chief source of the\r\nenergy necessary for the internal life of the cell, though nitrogen\r\nand sulphur replace it in this function with a few forms. This\r\nlatter use of carbon constitutes what may be called its _respiratory\r\nfunction_. Bacteria like other organisms in their respiration utilize\r\noxygen and give off carbon dioxide. The amount of the latter given off\r\nfrom the cell in this way is very small as compared with that which\r\nis frequently produced as an accompaniment of other reactions (see\r\nFermentation, next chapter). But there is no doubt of its formation and\r\nit has been determined by a few investigators. On account of this use\r\nof carbon, bacteria require relatively large amounts of this element.\r\nOne group of bacteria concerned in the spontaneous heating of coal\r\nseems to be able to use free carbon from this material. Another group\r\nis said to be able to oxidize marsh gas, CH₄, and use this as its\r\nsource of carbon. The nitrite, nitrate and sulphur bacteria mentioned\r\nlater utilize carbon dioxide and carbonates as their carbon supply,\r\nand one kind has been described which uses carbon monoxide. With these\r\nfew exceptions bacteria are dependent on _organic compounds_ for their\r\ncarbon and cannot use CO₂ as green plants do.\r\n\r\nThe oxygen requirement is high partly for the same reason that\r\ncarbon is, _i.e._, respiration. Oxygen is one of the constituents of\r\nprotoplasm, and combined with hydrogen forms water which makes up such\r\na large part of the living cell. Anaërobic bacteria are dependent on\r\nso-called “molecular respiration” for their energy. That is, through\r\na shifting or rearrangement of the atoms in the compounds used as\r\nfood the oxidation of carbon is brought about. Enzymes are probably\r\nresponsible for this action. Carbon dioxide is produced by anaërobes\r\nas well as by aërobes, and frequently in amounts readily collected. A\r\ncarbohydrate is usually though not always essential for the growth of\r\nanaërobes and serves them as the best source of energy.\r\n\r\nNitrogen is the characteristic element of living material. Protoplasm\r\nis a chemical substance in unstable equilibrium and nitrogen is\r\nresponsible for this instability. No other of the commoner elements\r\nis brought into combination with such difficulty, nor is so readily\r\nliberated when combined (all commercial explosives are nitrogen\r\ncompounds). Bacteria, like other forms of protoplasm, require nitrogen.\r\nMore marked peculiarities are shown by bacteria with reference to the\r\nsources from which they derive their nitrogen than for carbon. Some can\r\neven combine the free nitrogen of the air and furnish the only natural\r\nmeans of any importance for this reaction. Some few forms (the nitrite\r\nand nitrate formers, Chapter XI) obtain their energy from the oxidation\r\nof inorganic nitrogen compounds, ammonia and nitrites respectively, and\r\nnot from carbon. These latter bacteria use carbon from carbon dioxide\r\nand carbonates. A great many bacteria can secure their nitrogen from\r\nnitrates but some are restricted to organic nitrogen. Many bacteria\r\nobtain their carbon from the same organic compounds from which their\r\nnitrogen is derived.\r\n\r\nSulphur serves mainly as a constituent of protein compounds in the\r\nprotoplasmic structure. In some of the _sulphur_ bacteria it is a\r\nsource of energy, since either free sulphur or H₂S is oxidized by them.\r\nSome of these bacteria can obtain their carbon from CO₂ or carbonates,\r\nand their nitrogen from nitrates or ammonium salts.\r\n\r\nWhether the _iron_ bacteria, belonging to the genus _Crenothrix_ of the\r\nhigher, thread bacteria, use this element or its compounds as sources\r\nof energy is still a disputed question. The evidence is largely in\r\nfavor of this view.\r\n\r\nFree hydrogen has been shown to be oxidized by some forms which obtain\r\ntheir energy in this way.\r\n\r\nWhether there is a special class of _phosphorus_ bacteria remains to be\r\ndiscovered. That phosphorus is oxidized during the activity of many\r\nbacteria is undoubted, but whether this represents a source of energy\r\nor is the accidental by-product of other activities is undetermined.\r\n\r\nPractically nothing is known about the metabolism of the other elements\r\nas such.\r\n\r\nFrom the preceding brief review of the relation of certain bacteria\r\nto some of the elements in the free state and from the further fact\r\nthat there is scarcely a known natural organic compound which cannot\r\nbe utilized by some kind of bacterium, it is evident that this class\r\nof organisms has a far wider range of adaptability than any other\r\nclass, and this adaptability helps to explain their seemingly universal\r\ndistribution.\r\n\r\nAs to the metabolism _within the cell_, no more is known than is the\r\ncase with other cells, nor even as much. The materials used for growth\r\nand as sources of energy are taken into the cell, built up into various\r\ncompounds some of which have been enumerated and in part broken down\r\nagain. Carbon dioxide and water are formed in the latter process. What\r\nother katabolic products occur it is not easy to determine. Certainly\r\nsome of the substances mentioned in the next chapters are such products\r\nbut it is not always possible to separate those formed _inside_ the\r\ncell from those formed _outside_. Perhaps most of the latter should be\r\nconsidered true metabolic products. It would seem that on account of\r\nthe simplicity of structure of the bacterial cell and of the compounds\r\nwhich they may use as food they would serve as excellent objects\r\nfor the study of the fundamental problems of cell metabolism. Their\r\nminuteness and the nearly impossible task of separating them completely\r\nfrom the medium in or on which they are grown makes the solution of\r\nthese problems one of great difficulty.\r\n\r\nWhen all of the environmental conditions necessary for the best\r\ndevelopment of a given bacterium are fulfilled, it will then develop\r\nto the limit of its capacity. This development is characterized\r\nessentially by its reproduction, which occurs by transverse division.\r\nThe rate of this division varies much with the kind even under good\r\nconditions. The most rapid rate so far observed is a division in\r\neighteen minutes. A great many reproduce every half-hour and this may\r\nbe taken as a good average rate. If such division could proceed without\r\ninterruption, a little calculation will show that in about sixty-five\r\nhours a mass as large as the earth would be produced.\r\n\r\n  Starting with 1 coccus, 1µ in diameter,\r\n    its volume = 0.0000000000005 cc.\r\n\r\n       1/2 hour  =                 2\r\n         1 hour  =                 4\r\n         2 hours =                16\r\n         4 hours =               256\r\n         5 hours =              1024 = 10³+\r\n        15 hours =     1,000,000,000 = 10⁹ = 0.5 cc.\r\n        35 hours =     10²¹+ = 500.0 cu.m.\r\n  About 65 hours = 2 × 10⁴²+ = 5 × 10²⁰ cu.m. = a mass as large\r\n                                               as the earth.\r\n\r\nSuch a rate of increase evidently cannot be kept up long on account of\r\nmany limiting factors, chief of which is the food supply.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing calculation is based on the assumption that the organism\r\ndivides in one plane only. If it divides in 2 or 3 planes, the rate is\r\nmuch faster, as is shown by the following formulæ, which indicate the\r\ntheoretical rate of division:\r\n\r\n  S = number of bacteria after a given number of divisions.\r\n  a = number at the beginning, and n = number of divisions.\r\n              1 plane division S = 2_ⁿ_a\r\n              2   „      „     S = 2²_ⁿ_a\r\n              3   „      „     S = 2³_ⁿ_a\r\n\r\nWith two-plane or three-plane division, assuming that each organism\r\nattains full size, as was assumed in the first calculation, the “mass\r\nas large as the earth” would be attained in about thirty-two and\r\ntwenty-two hours respectively.\r\n\r\nThis extraordinary rate of increase explains in large measure why\r\nbacteria are able to bring about such great chemical changes in so\r\nshort a time as is seen in the rapid “spoiling” of food materials,\r\nespecially liquids. The reactions brought about by bacteria on\r\nsubstances which are soluble and diffusible are essentially “surface\r\nreactions.” The material diffuses into the cell over its entire surface\r\nwith little hindrance. The bacteria are usually distributed throughout\r\nthe medium, so that there is very intimate contact in all parts of\r\nthe mass which favors rapid chemical action. The following calculation\r\nillustrates this:\r\n\r\n  The volume of a coccus 1µ in diameter is 0.5236 × 10⁻¹³ cc.\r\n  The surface of a coccus 1µ in diameter is π × 10⁻⁸ sq. cm.\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon to find in milk on the point of souring\r\n1,000,000,000 bacteria per cc.\r\n\r\nAssuming these to be cocci of 1µ diameter the volume of these bacteria\r\nin a liter is only 0.05 cc. or in the liter there would be 19999 parts\r\nof milk and only 1 part bacteria. The surface area of these bacteria is\r\n3141.6 sq. cm. With this large surface exposed, it is not strange that\r\nthe change from “on the point of souring” to “sour” occurs within an\r\nhour or less.\r\n\r\nAlthough large numbers of bacteria can and do cause great chemical\r\nchanges the amount of material actually utilized for maintenance of\r\nthe cell is very slight, infinitesimal almost, and yet is fairly\r\ncomparable to that required for man, as is illustrated by the following\r\ncomputations:\r\n\r\nE. Kohn has shown that certain water bacteria grew well in water to\r\nwhich there was added per liter 0.000002 mg. dextrose, 0.00000007\r\nmg. (NH₄)₂SO₄ and 0.0000000007 mg. (NH₄)₂HPO₄. The bacteria numbered\r\nabout 1000 per cc. Taking the specific gravity at 1 (a little too\r\nlow) the mass of the bacteria in the liter was about 0.001 mg. Hence\r\nthe bacteria used 0.002 of their weight of carbohydrate and 0.00007\r\nof ammonium sulphate. A 150-pound (75-kilo) man can live on 375 g.\r\nof sugar (0.005 of his weight) and 52.5 g. of protein (0.0007 of his\r\nweight). From these figures it can be calculated that the man utilizes\r\nabout two and a half times as much carbohydrate and about seven times\r\nas much nitrogen as the bacterium, relatively speaking.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nPHYSIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe physiological activities of motion, reproduction and metabolism\r\nwithin the cell have been discussed in previous chapters. The\r\nobjects in view in the discussion of the “physiological activities”\r\n(sometimes spoken of as “biochemical” activities) of bacteria in\r\nthis and subsequent chapters are to familiarize the student to some\r\nextent with the great range of chemical changes brought about by these\r\nminute organisms, to show their usefulness, even their necessity, and\r\nto impress the fact that it is chiefly by a careful study of these\r\n“activities” that individual kinds of bacteria are identified. It\r\nshould always be borne in mind that the bacteria, in bringing about\r\nthese changes which are so characteristic in many instances, are simply\r\nengaged in their own life struggle, in securing the elements which\r\nthey need for growth, in liberating energy for vital processes, or\r\noccasionally in providing conditions which favor their own development\r\nand hinder that of their competitors.\r\n\r\n\r\nFERMENTATION OF CARBOHYDRATES.\r\n\r\nBy this is meant the changes which different carbohydrates undergo when\r\nsubjected to bacterial action.[11]\r\n\r\nThese changes are marked chiefly by the production of gas or acid. The\r\nformer is called “gaseous fermentation” the latter “acid fermentation.”\r\nThe gases commonly produced are carbon dioxide (CO₂) hydrogen and\r\nmarsh gas (CH₄). Other gases of the paraffin series may also be formed\r\nas ethane (C₂H₆), acetylene (C₂H₂), etc. CO₂ and H are the ones usually\r\nformed from sugars by the few gas-forming bacteria which produce\r\ndisease, though even here some CH₄ is present. The common _Bacterium\r\ncoli_ forms all three, though the CH₄ is in smallest quantity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60.--Cylinder to show the formation of gas by\r\nbacteria. The gauge shows 265 pounds. It went beyond 500 pounds.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61.--A burning natural gas well at night. From a\r\nphotograph colored.]\r\n\r\nIn the fermentation of the polysaccharids--starch and especially\r\ncellulose and woody material--large amounts of CH₄ occur, particularly\r\nwhen the changes are due to anaërobic bacteria. This phenomenon may be\r\nreadily observed in sluggish streams, ponds and swamps where vegetable\r\nmatter accumulates on the bottom. The bubbles of gas which arise when\r\nthe mass is disturbed explode if a lighted match is applied to them.\r\n\r\nThe author has conducted a number of experiments to demonstrate this\r\naction as follows: Material taken from the bottom of a pond in the\r\nfall after vegetation had died out was packed into a cylinder five\r\nfeet long and six inches in diameter, water was added to within about\r\n2 inches of the top. After leaving them open for a few days to permit\r\nall the dissolved oxygen to be used up by the aërobes, the cylinders\r\nwere tightly capped and allowed to stand undisturbed. Pressure gauges\r\nreading to 500 lbs. were attached (Fig. 60). At the end of six months\r\nthe gauge showed a pressure beyond the limits of the readings on it.\r\nMost of the gas was collected and measured 146 liters. An analysis\r\nof portions collected when about one-half had been allowed to escape\r\nshowed the following composition, according to Prof. D. J. Demorest of\r\nthe Department of Metallurgy:\r\n\r\n  CO₂     18.6 per cent.\r\n  CH₄     76.1    „\r\n   H       1.0    „\r\n   N       4.3    „\r\n\r\nIn the author’s opinion natural gas and petroleum have been formed in\r\nthis way[12] (Figs. 61 and 62).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62.--A “flowing” oil well.]\r\n\r\nOne of the very few practical uses of the gaseous fermentation of\r\ncarbohydrates is in making “salt rising” bread. The “rising” of the\r\nmaterial is due not to yeasts but to the formation of gas by certain\r\nbacteria which are present on the corn meal or flour used in the\r\nprocess (Fig. 63).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63.--A loaf of “salt rising” bread. The porous\r\nstructure is due to the gas formed by bacilli and not by yeasts.]\r\n\r\nAnother is in the formation of the “holes” or “eyes” so characteristic\r\nof Swiss and other types of cheese (Fig. 64).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64.--Ohio Swiss cheese. The “eyes” are due to gas\r\nformed by bacteria during the ripening of the cheese.]\r\n\r\nA great many organic acids are formed during the “acid fermentation”\r\nof carbohydrates by bacteria. Each kind of bacterium, as a rule, forms\r\nseveral different acids as well as other substances, though usually one\r\nis produced in much larger amounts, and the kind of fermentation is\r\nnamed from this acid. One of the commonest of these acids is lactic.\r\nThe “lactic acid bacteria” form a very large and important group and\r\nare indispensable in many commercial processes. In the making of butter\r\nthe cream is first “ripened,” as is the milk from which many kinds of\r\ncheese are made (Fig. 65). The chief feature of this “ripening” is the\r\nformation of lactic acid from the milk-sugar by the action of bacteria.\r\nA similar change occurs in the popular “Bulgarian fermented milk.” The\r\nreaction is usually represented by the equation:\r\n\r\n  Milk-sugar.                  Lactic acid.\r\n  C₁₂H₂₂O₁₁ + H₂O + (bacteria) = 4C₃H₆O₃\r\n\r\nIt is not probable that the change occurs quantitatively as indicated,\r\nbecause a number of other substances are also formed. Some of these\r\nare acetic and succinic acids and alcohol. Another industrial use of\r\nthis acid fermentation is in the preparation of “sauer kraut.” These\r\nbacteria are chiefly anaërobic and grow best in a relatively high salt\r\nconcentration. They occur naturally on the cabbage leaves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65.--A cream ripener. In this apparatus cream is\r\n“ripened,” _i.e._, undergoes lactic acid fermentation, preparatory to\r\nmaking it into butter.]\r\n\r\nIn the formation of ensilage (Fig. 66) the lactic acid bacteria play\r\na very important part, as they do also in “sour mash” distilling, and\r\nin many kinds of natural “pickling.” In fact, whenever green vegetable\r\nmaterial “sours” spontaneously, lactic acid bacteria are always present\r\nand account for a large part of the acid. This property of lactic acid\r\nformation is also taken advantage of in the preparation of lactic acid\r\non a commercial scale in at least one plant in this country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66.--Filling a silo on the University farm.]\r\n\r\nAcetic acid is another common product of acid fermentation. However, in\r\nvinegar making the acetic acid is not formed directly from the sugar in\r\nthe fruit juice by bacteria. The sugar is first converted into alcohol\r\nby yeasts, then the alcohol is _oxidized_ to acid by the bacteria (Fig.\r\n67). The reaction may be represented as follows:\r\n\r\n  Dextrose. Ethyl alcohol.  Acetic acid.\r\n  C₆H₁₂O₆ = 2C₂H₅OH + 2CO₂\r\n\r\n  C₂H₅OH + O₂ + (bacteria) = CH₃COOH + H₂O.\r\n\r\nButyric acid is generally produced where fermentation of carbohydrates\r\noccurs under _anaërobic_ conditions. Some of the “strong” odor of\r\ncertain kinds of cheese is due to this acid which is formed partly\r\nfrom the milk-sugar remaining in the cheese. Most of it under these\r\nconditions comes from the proteins of the cheese and especially from\r\nthe fat (see page 101).\r\n\r\nAs has been indicated alcohol is a common accompaniment of most acid\r\nfermentations, as are the esters of acids other than the chief product.\r\nBacteria are not used in a commercial way to produce alcohol, however,\r\nas the yield is too small. There are some few bacteria in which the\r\namount of alcohol is prominent enough to call the process an “alcoholic\r\nfermentation” rather than an acid one. In brewing and distilling\r\nindustries, _yeasts_ are used to make the alcohol, though molds replace\r\nthem in some countries (“sake” and “arrak” from rice).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67.--A vinegar ripener. The tank shown opened at\r\nthe side is filled with a special type of beech shavings which thus\r\nprovide a very large surface. The apple juice which has been previously\r\nfermented with yeast, which converts the sugar into alcohol, is allowed\r\nto trickle through the openings at the top over the shavings. The\r\nacetic acid bacteria on the shavings rapidly oxidize the alcohol to\r\nacetic acid. The vinegar is drawn off below.]\r\n\r\nUnder ordinary conditions the carbohydrate is never completely\r\nfermented, since the accumulation of the product--acid--stops\r\nthe reaction. If the acid is neutralized by the addition of an\r\nalkali--calcium or magnesium carbonate is best--then the sugar\r\nmay all be split up. Where such fermentation occurs under natural\r\nconditions, the products are further split up, partly by molds and\r\npartly by acid-destroying bacteria into simpler acids and eventually\r\nto carbon dioxide and water, so that the end-products of the complete\r\nfermentation of carbohydrate material in nature are carbon dioxide,\r\nhydrogen, marsh gas, and water.\r\n\r\nIn all of these fermentations the bacteria are utilizing the _carbon_\r\nboth as building material and for oxidation and the fermentations\r\nare incidental to this use. As a rule, the acid-forming bacteria can\r\nwithstand a higher concentration of acid than the other bacteria that\r\nwould utilize the same material, and in a short time crowd out their\r\ncompetitors or inhibit their growth, and thus have better conditions\r\nfor their own existence, though finally their growth is also checked by\r\nthe acid.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPLITTING OF FATS.\r\n\r\nThe _splitting of fats_ into glycerin and the particular acid or\r\nacids involved may be brought about by bacteria. An illustration\r\nis the development of rancidity in butter at times and the\r\n“strong” odor of animal fats on long keeping and of many kinds of\r\ncheese--“limburger”--in this country. Generally speaking, however, fats\r\nare not vigorously attacked, as is illustrated by the difficulties due\r\nto accumulation of fats in certain types of sewage-disposal works. The\r\nchemical change is represented by the equation:\r\n\r\n   Fat.                            Glycerin.     Fatty acid.\r\n  C₃H₅(C{_n_}H₂{_n_}₋₁O₂)₃ + 3 H₂O = C₃H₅(OH)₃ + 3 (C{_n_}H₂{_n_}O₂).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nPHYSIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES (CONTINUED).\r\n\r\n\r\nPUTREFACTION OF PROTEINS.\r\n\r\nThe word “_putrefaction_” is now restricted to the action of bacteria\r\non the _complex nitrogen-containing substances_, proteins, and their\r\nimmediate derivatives. The process is usually accompanied by the\r\ndevelopment of foul odors.\r\n\r\nBacteria make use of proteins chiefly as a source of nitrogen, but also\r\nas a source of carbon and other elements. Proteins contain nitrogen,\r\ncarbon, hydrogen, oxygen, sulphur and frequently phosphorus. Some of\r\nthe metals--potassium, sodium, calcium, magnesium, iron and manganese\r\nand the non-metal chlorine--are nearly always associated with them more\r\nor less intimately. Since these bodies are the most complex of natural\r\nchemical substances it follows that the breaking up of the molecule to\r\nsecure a part of the nitrogen gives rise to a great variety of products.\r\n\r\nThere are marked differences among bacteria in their ability to\r\nattack this class of compounds. Some can break up the most complex\r\nnatural proteins such as albumins, globulins, glyco-, chromo-, and\r\nnucleoproteins, nucleins and albuminoid derivatives like gelatin. The\r\nterm _saprogenic_ (σαπρος = rotten) is sometimes applied to bacteria\r\nwhich have this power. These proteins are large-moleculed and not\r\ndiffusible, so that the first splitting up that they undergo must occur\r\noutside the bacterial cell. The products of this first splitting may\r\ndiffuse into the cell and be utilized there. The bacteria of this class\r\nattack not only these proteins in the natural state or in solution,\r\nbut also in the coagulated state. The coagulum becomes softened and\r\nfinally changed into a liquid condition. The process when applied to\r\nthe casein of milk is usually called “digestion,” also when coagulated\r\nblood serum is acted on. In the latter case the serum is more commonly\r\nsaid to be “liquefied” as is the case when gelatin is the substance\r\nchanged. Most of these bacteria have also the property of coagulating\r\nor curdling milk in an alkaline medium, and then digesting the curd.\r\nA second class of bacteria has no effect on the complex proteins just\r\nmentioned but readily attacks the products of their first splitting,\r\n_i.e._, the proteoses, peptones, polypeptids and amino-acids. They are\r\nsometimes called _saprophilic_ bacteria.\r\n\r\nOther bacteria derive their nitrogen from some of the products of the\r\nfirst two groups, and still further break down the complex protein\r\nmolecule. Under normal conditions these various kinds of bacteria\r\nall occur together and thus mutually assist one another in what is\r\nequivalent to a symbiosis or rather a metabiosis, a “successive\r\nexistence,” one set living on the products of the other. The result\r\nis the complete splitting up of the complete protein molecule. A part\r\nof the nitrogen is built up into the bodies of the bacteria which are\r\nusing it as food. A part is finally liberated as _free nitrogen_ or as\r\n_ammonia_ after having undergone a series of transformations many of\r\nwhich are still undetermined.\r\n\r\nOne class of compounds formed received at one time much attention\r\nbecause they were supposed to be responsible for a great deal of\r\nillness. These are the “ptomaines,” basic nitrogen compounds of\r\ndefinite composition--amines--some few of which are poisonous, most of\r\nthem not. The basic character of ptomaines may be understood if they be\r\nregarded as made up of one or more molecules of ammonia in which the\r\nhydrogen has been replaced by alkyl or other radicals. Thus ammonia\r\n(NH₃) may be represented as\r\n\r\n    /H\r\n   /\r\n  N--H\r\n   \\\r\n    \\H.\r\n\r\nThe simplest ptomaine is\r\n\r\n    /CH₃\r\n   /\r\n  N--H\r\n   \\\r\n    \\H,\r\n\r\nin which one H is replaced by methyl, methylamine, a gaseous ptomaine.\r\nWith two hydrogens replaced by methyl,\r\n\r\n    /CH₃\r\n   /\r\n  N--CH₃\r\n   \\\r\n    \\H,\r\n\r\ndimethylamine, also a gas at ordinary temperature, is formed.\r\nTrimethylamine,\r\n\r\n    /CH₃\r\n   /\r\n  N--CH₃\r\n   \\\r\n    \\CH₃,\r\n\r\na liquid, results when three hydrogens are similarly replaced.\r\nAll three of these occur in herring brine and are responsible\r\nfor the characteristic odor of this material. Putrescin and\r\ncadaverin--tetramethylene--diamine, and pentamethylenediamine\r\nrespectively--occur generally in decomposing flesh, hence the names.\r\nThey are only slightly poisonous. One of the highly poisonous ptomaines\r\nis neurin C₅H₁₃NO or C₂H₃N(CH₃)₃OH = trimethyl-vinyl ammonium\r\nhydroxide. This is a stronger base than ammonia, liberating it from\r\nits salts. Numerous other ptomaines have been isolated and described.\r\nThese bodies were considered for a long time to be the cause of various\r\nkinds of “meat poisoning,” “ice cream poisoning,” “cheese poisoning,”\r\netc. It is true that they may sometimes cause these conditions, but\r\nthey are very much rarer than the laity generally believe. Most of\r\nthe “meat poisonings” in America are due, not to ptomaines, but to\r\ninfections with certain bacilli of the _Bacterium enteritidis_ group.\r\nOccasionally a case of poisoning by the true toxin (see Chapter XII) of\r\n_Clostridium botulinum_ occurs, and in recent years has become entirely\r\ntoo common due to insufficient heating of canned goods. _The boiling of\r\nsuch material will destroy this toxin. The safest rule to follow is not\r\nto eat any canned material that shows any departure from the normal in\r\nflavor, taste or consistency._\r\n\r\nAs ptomaines result from the putrefaction of proteins, so they are\r\nstill further decomposed by bacteria and eventually the nitrogen is\r\nliberated either as free nitrogen or as ammonia.\r\n\r\nAnother series of products are the so-called aromatic compounds--phenol\r\n(carbolic acid), various cresols, also indol and skatol or methyl indol\r\n(these two are largely responsible for the characteristic odor of human\r\nfeces). All of these nitrogen compounds are attacked by bacteria and\r\nthe nitrogen is eventually liberated, so far as it is not locked up in\r\nthe bodies of the bacteria, as free nitrogen or as ammonia.\r\n\r\nThe carbon which occurs in proteins accompanies the nitrogen in many of\r\nthe above products, but also appears in nitrogen-free organic acids,\r\naldehydes and alcohols which are all eventually split up, so that the\r\ncarbon is changed to carbon dioxide or in the absence of oxygen partly\r\nto marsh gas.\r\n\r\nThe intermediate changes which the sulphur in proteins undergoes are\r\nnot known, but it is liberated as sulphuretted hydrogen (H₂S) or as\r\nvarious mercaptans (all foul-smelling), or is partially oxidized to\r\nsulphuric acid. Some of the H₂S and the sulphur of the mercaptans\r\nare oxidized by the sulphur bacteria to free sulphur and finally to\r\nsulphuric acid.\r\n\r\nPhosphorus is present especially in the nucleoproteins and nucleins.\r\nJust what the intermediate stages are, on whether there are any, so\r\nfar as the phosphorus is concerned, in the splitting up of nucleic\r\nacid by bacterial action is not determined. The phosphorus may occur\r\nas phosphoric acid in such decompositions, or when the conditions are\r\nanaërobic, as phosphine (PH₃), which burns spontaneously in the air to\r\nphosphorus pentoxide (P₂O₅), and water.[13]\r\n\r\nThe hydrogen in proteins appears in the forms above indicated: H₄C,\r\nH₃N, H₃P, H₂S, H₂O and as free H. The oxygen as CO₂ and H₂O.\r\n\r\nIn the breaking down of the complex protein molecule even by a single\r\nkind of bacterium there is not a perfect descending scale of complexity\r\nas might be supposed from the statement that there result proteoses,\r\npeptones, polypeptids, amino-acids. These substances do result, but at\r\nthe time of their formation simpler ones are formed also, even CO₂,\r\nNH₃ and H₂S. It appears that the entire molecule is shattered in such\r\na way that less complex proteins are formed from the major part, while\r\na minor portion breaks up completely to the simplest combinations\r\npossible. A more complete knowledge of these decompositions will aid\r\nin the further unravelling of the structure of proteins. The presence\r\nor absence of free oxygen makes a difference in the end-products, as\r\nhas been indicated. There are bacteria which oxidize the ammonia to\r\nnitric acid and the H₂S to sulphuric acid. (See Oxidation, Chapter XI.)\r\nBacteria which directly oxidize phosphorus compounds to phosphoric\r\nacid have not been described. It does not seem that such are necessary\r\nsince this is either split off from nucleic acid or results from the\r\nspontaneous oxidation of phosphine when this is formed under anaërobic\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nNot only are proteins decomposed as above outlined, but also their\r\nwaste products, that is, the form in which their nitrogen leaves the\r\nanimal body. This is largely urea in mammals, with much hippuric acid\r\nin herbivorous animals and uric acid in birds and reptiles. These\r\nsubstances yield NH₃, CO₂ and H₂O with a variety of organic acids\r\nas intermediate products in some cases. The strong odor of ammonia\r\nin stables and about manure piles is the everyday evidence of this\r\ndecomposition.\r\n\r\nWhere the putrefaction of proteins occurs in the soil with moderate\r\namounts of moisture and free access of air a large part of the products\r\nis retained in the soil. Thus the ammonia and carbon dioxide in the\r\npresence of water form ammonium carbonate; the nitric, sulphuric and\r\nphosphoric acids unite with some of the metals which are always present\r\nto form salts. Some of the gases do escape and most where the oxygen\r\nsupply is least, since they are not oxidized.\r\n\r\nThe protein-splitting reactions afford valuable tests in aiding in\r\nthe recognition of bacteria. In the study of pathogenic bacteria the\r\ncoagulation and digestion of milk, the digestion or liquefaction\r\nof blood serum, the liquefaction of gelatin and the production of\r\nindol and H₂S are those usually tested for. In dairy bacteriology\r\nthe coagulation of milk and the digestion of the casein are common\r\nphenomena. Most bacteria which liquefy gelatin also digest blood serum\r\nand coagulate and digest milk, though there are exceptions. In soil\r\nbacteriology the whole range of protein changes is of the greatest\r\nimportance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n     +----<----------------------+\r\n     |                           |\r\n

activities already discussed explain how\r\nbacteria break down the chief complex, energy-rich substances\r\n--carbohydrates, fats and proteins which constitute the bulk of the\r\norganic material in the bodies of plants and animals, as well as\r\nthe waste products of the latter--into energy-free compounds like\r\ncarbon dioxide, water, ammonia, nitric, sulphuric and phosphoric\r\nacids--mineralize them, as is frequently said. By so doing the bacteria\r\nact as the great scavengers of nature removing the dead animal\r\nand vegetable matter of all kinds which but for this action would\r\naccumulate to such an extent that all life, both on land and in the\r\nwater, must cease. It is further to be noted that not only is all this\r\ndead organic matter removed; but it is converted into forms which are\r\nagain available for plant growth. Carbon dioxide forms the source of\r\nthe carbon in all green plants, hence in all animals; the sulphates and\r\nphosphates are likewise taken up by green plants and built up again\r\ninto protein compounds; the ammonia is not directly available to green\r\nplants to any large extent but is converted by the nitrifying bacteria\r\n(Chapter XI) into nitrates which is the form in which nitrogen is\r\nassimilated by these higher types. Even the free nitrogen of the air\r\nis taken up by several kinds of bacteria, the symbiotic “root-tubercle\r\nbacteria” of leguminous and other plants, and some free-living forms,\r\nand made available. Hence bacteria are indispensable in nature,\r\nespecially in keeping up the circulation of nitrogen. They are also of\r\ngreat service in the circulation of carbon, sulphur and phosphorus.\r\nThough some few kinds cause disease in man and animals, if it were not\r\nfor the saprophytic bacteria above outlined, there could be no animals\r\nand higher plants to acquire these diseases.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\nPHYSIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES (CONTINUED).\r\n\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION OF ACIDS.\r\n\r\nThe production of organic acids has been sufficiently discussed in\r\npreceding chapters. It should be noted that not only these in great\r\nvariety are produced by bacteria but that under certain conditions\r\nmineral acids, such as nitric, sulphuric and phosphoric may be formed\r\n(see Oxidation, p. 114). Acid production is of great value in the\r\nidentification of bacteria in dairy and soil work and in connection\r\nwith certain types of pathogenic bacteria.\r\n\r\n\r\nGAS PRODUCTION.\r\n\r\nIt will be sufficient merely to enumerate collectively the various\r\ngases mentioned in preceding paragraphs and to state that those\r\ncommonly observed in the study of pathogenic bacteria are the first\r\nsix mentioned. Most of them come in in dairy work either in the study\r\nof bacteria causing milk and cheese “failures” or as affecting the\r\nflavors of butter or cheese. In the study of soil organisms, any or all\r\nof them are liable to be of importance. The gases are: CO₂, H, CH₄, N,\r\nNH₃, H₂S, gaseous mercaptans, gaseous ptomaines, volatile fatty acids,\r\nethereal salts or esters and others, both of pleasant and of foul odor,\r\nbut of unknown composition.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION OF ESTERS.\r\n\r\nThe production of esters, as mentioned in Chapters IX and X, of various\r\nalcohols and aldehydes are activities which are sometimes of value in\r\nthe study of bacteria, but need not be further discussed.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION OF “AROMATIC” COMPOUNDS.\r\n\r\nThese have been mentioned in discussing the putrefaction of proteins,\r\nas indol, skatol, phenol and various cresols. Of these only the first\r\nis ordinarily tested for in the study of bacteria, though others of the\r\ngroup become of value in certain special cases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72.--Culture of phosphorescent bacteria in an\r\nEhrlenmeyer flask photographed by their own light. Time of exposure\r\ntwelve hours. (Molisch, from Lafar.)]\r\n\r\n\r\nPHOSPHORESCENCE OR PHOTOGENESIS.\r\n\r\nThis is a most interesting phenomenon associated with the growth of\r\nsome bacteria. The “fox fire” frequently seen on decaying wood which\r\nis covered with a slimy deposit is most commonly due to bacteria,\r\nthough also to other fungi. Phosphorescent bacteria are very common\r\nin sea water, hence they are frequently found on various sea foods,\r\nespecially when these are allowed to decompose, such as fish, oysters,\r\nclams, etc. The light is due to the conversion of the energy of\r\nunknown easily oxidizable compounds directly into _visible_ radiant\r\nenergy through oxidation without appreciable quantities of heat.\r\nThe light produced may be sufficient to tell the time on a watch in\r\nabsolute darkness, and also to photograph the growths with their own\r\nlight, but only after several hours’ exposure (Fig. 72). None of the\r\nphosphorescent bacteria so far discovered produce disease in the higher\r\nanimals or man.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION OF PIGMENT OR CHROMOGENESIS.\r\n\r\nOne of the most striking results of bacterial activity is this\r\nphenomenon. The particular color which results may be almost any one\r\nthroughout the range of the spectrum, though shades of yellow and of\r\nred are of more frequent occurrence.\r\n\r\nIn the red sulphur bacteria the “bacteriopurpurin” which they contain\r\nappears to serve as a true respiratory pigment in a manner similar to\r\nthe chlorophyl in green plants, except that these bacteria oxidize\r\nH₂S in the light as a source of energy instead of splitting up CO₂.\r\nThe red pigment produced by certain bacteria has been shown to have\r\na capacity for combining with O resembling that of hemoglobin, and\r\nsome investigators have believed that such bacteria do store O in this\r\nway for use when the supply is diminished. With these few exceptions\r\nthe pigments seem to be merely by-products of cell activity which are\r\ncolored and have no known function.\r\n\r\nThe red sulphur bacteria above mentioned and one or two other kinds\r\nretain the pigments formed within the cell. Such bacteria are called\r\n_chromophoric_ as distinguished from the _chromoparic_ bacteria whose\r\npigment lies outside the cell.\r\n\r\nThe chemical composition of no bacterial pigment has been determined\r\nup to the present. Some are soluble in water, as shown by the\r\ndiscoloration of the substances on which they grow. Others are not\r\nsoluble in water but are in alcohol, or in some of the fat solvents\r\nas ether, chloroform, benzol, etc. These latter are probably closely\r\nrelated to the _lipochromes_ or “fat colors” of higher plants and\r\nanimals. Attempts have been made to render the production of pigments\r\na still more reliable means of identification of species of bacteria\r\nthrough a careful examination of the spectra of their solutions, but\r\nsuch study has not as yet led to any valuable practical results.\r\n\r\nThe production of pigment depends on the same general factors which\r\ndetermine the growth of the organism but does _not necessarily run\r\nparallel_ with these. It is especially influenced by the oxygen\r\nsupply (only a very few organisms are known which produce pigment\r\nanaërobically--_Spirillum rubrum_ is one); by the presence of\r\ncertain food substances (starch, as in potato, for many bacteria\r\nproducing yellow and red colors; certain mineral salts, as\r\nphosphates and sulphates, for others); by the temperature (many\r\nbacteria cease to produce color at all if grown at body temperature,\r\n37°--_Erythrobacillus prodigiosus_--or if grown for a longer time at\r\ntemperatures a few degrees higher).\r\n\r\n\r\nREDUCING ACTIONS.\r\n\r\nReduction of nitrates to nitrites or to ammonia or even to free\r\nnitrogen is brought about by a great many different kinds of bacteria.\r\nIn many instances this phenomenon is due to a lack of free oxygen,\r\nwhich is obtained by the bacteria from these easily reducible salts.\r\nIn other cases a portion of the nitrogen is removed to be used as food\r\nmaterial in the building up of new protein in the bacterial cell. This\r\nlatter use of the nitrogen of nitrates by bacteria might theoretically\r\nresult in considerable loss of “available nitrogen” in the soil as has\r\nactually been shown in a few experiments. The reduction of nitrates as\r\nabove mentioned would also diminish this supply, but probably neither\r\nof these results has any very great practical effect on soil fertility.\r\nThe building up of protein from these mineral salts by bacteria in the\r\nintestines of herbivorous animals has been suggested by Armsby as a\r\nconsiderable source of nitrogenous food, and this suggestion appears\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nThe liberation of nitrogen from nitrates or nitrites, either as free\r\nnitrogen or as ammonia, is spoken of as “dentrification,” though this\r\nterm was formerly applied to such liberations, from compounds of\r\nnitrogen generally even from proteins.\r\n\r\nCertain bacteria may also reduce sulphates and other sulphur compounds\r\nto H₂S, a phenomenon frequently observed in sewage and likewise of\r\nimportance in the soil. It is possible that phosphates may be similarly\r\nreduced.[14] Further and more careful study of the reducing actions of\r\nbacteria is needed.\r\n\r\n\r\nOXIDATION.\r\n\r\nAs has been stated in discussing the respiration of bacteria (Chapter\r\nVIII) most of these organisms gain their energy through the oxidation\r\nof carbon in various forms, chiefly organic, so that CO₂ is a product\r\nof the activity of nearly all bacteria. Some few oxidize CO to CO₂,\r\nothers CH₄ and other paraffins to CO₂ for this purpose. One class of\r\nbacteria even oxidizes H in small amounts for its energy and uses the\r\ncarbon dioxide of the air or traces of organic carbon in the air as a\r\nsource of carbon for “building” purposes.\r\n\r\nOne of the familiar oxidations of organic carbon is that of the acetic\r\nacid bacteria in the making of vinegar. These oxidize the alcohol\r\nwhich results from the action of yeast to acetic acid according to the\r\nformula CH₃CH₂OH + O₂ = CH₃COOH + H₂O (see Fig. 67).\r\n\r\nOf the various phenomena of oxidation due to bacteria, the formation of\r\nnitrites and nitrates has the greatest practical importance, since it\r\nis by this means that the ammonia which results from the decomposition\r\nof animal and vegetable tissue and waste products is again rendered\r\navailable to green plants as food in the form of nitrates. Practically\r\nall the nitrates found in nature, sometimes in large quantities, are\r\nformed in this way. There are two distinct kinds of bacteria involved.\r\nOne, the nitrous bacteria, oxidizes the ammonia to nitrous acid\r\nwhich forms nitrites with bases, and the other, the nitric bacteria,\r\noxidizes the nitrous to nitric acid, giving nitrates with bases. A\r\nstriking peculiarity of these two classes of organisms is that they\r\nmay live entirely on inorganic food materials, are proto-autotrophic,\r\nprototrophic for oxygen (aërobic) and autotrophic for the other\r\nelements. Their carbon is derived from CO₂ or carbonates. The\r\nimportance of such organisms in keeping up the supply of nitrates in\r\nthe soil can scarcely be overestimated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73.--Sprinkling filters of the Columbus\r\nsewage-disposal plant--devices which provide a good supply of oxygen\r\nfor the bacteria that oxidize the organic matter in the sewage.]\r\n\r\nThe oxidation of the H₂S, which is formed in the putrefaction\r\nof proteins, to free S by the sulphur bacteria and the further\r\noxidation of this free S to sulphuric acid, and of the phosphorus, so\r\ncharacteristic of the nucleins, to phosphoric acid have been referred\r\nto. These activities of bacteria are of great value in the soil.\r\nDoubtless the commercial “phosphate rock” owes its origin to similar\r\nbacterial action in ages past.\r\n\r\nThe oxidation of H₂S to free S may be an explanation of the origin of\r\nthe great deposits of sulphur which are found in Louisiana and along\r\nthe Gulf coast. These deposits occur in the same general regions as\r\nnatural gas and oil. The sulphur might have been derived from the same\r\norganic material carried down by the Mississippi which yielded the oil\r\nand gas.[15]\r\n\r\nA purposeful utilization of the oxidizing power of bacteria is in\r\n“contact beds,” “sprinkling filters” and “aërated sludge tanks” in\r\nsewage disposal works. In these instances the sewage is thoroughly\r\nmixed with air and brought in contact with large amounts of porous\r\nmaterial so as to expose an extensive surface for oxidation (Fig. 73).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74.--One of the University hot beds.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION OF HEAT.\r\n\r\nA direct result of the oxidizing action of bacteria is the production\r\nof heat. Under most conditions of bacterial growth this heat is not\r\nappreciable. It may become well marked. The “heating” of manure is one\r\nof the commonest illustrations. The temperature in such cases may reach\r\n70°. The heating of hay and other green materials is due chiefly to\r\nbacterial action. This heating may lead to “spontaneous combustion.”\r\nThe high temperatures (60° to 70°) favor the growth of thermophil\r\nbacteria which cause a still further rise. The heat dries out the\r\nmaterial, portions of which are in a state of very fine division due\r\nto the disintegrating action of the organisms. The hot, dry, finely\r\ndivided material oxidizes so rapidly on contact with the air that it\r\nignites.\r\n\r\nA practical use of heat production by bacteria is in the making of “hot\r\nbeds” for forcing vegetables (Fig. 74).\r\n\r\n\r\nABSORPTION OF FREE NITROGEN.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 75.--Root tubercles on soy bean. × 3/7.]\r\n\r\nThis is likewise one of the most important practical activities of\r\ncertain types of bacteria present in the soil. The ability of plants\r\nof the legume family to enrich the soil has been known and taken\r\nadvantage of for centuries, but it is only about thirty years since\r\nit was demonstrated that this property is due to bacteria. These\r\nplants, and several other kinds as well, have on their roots larger or\r\nsmaller nodules (Fig. 75) spoken of as “root tubercles” which are at\r\ncertain stages filled with bacteria. When conditions are favorable,\r\nthese bacteria live in symbiotic relationship with the plant tissues,\r\nreceiving carbonaceous and other food material from them and in return\r\nfurnishing nitrogenous compounds to the plant. This nitrogenous\r\nmaterial is built up from free nitrogen absorbed from the air by the\r\nbacteria. The utilization of this peculiar property through the proper\r\ncultivation of clover, alfalfa, soy beans and other legumes is one of\r\nthe best ways of building up and maintaining soil fertility in so far\r\nas the nitrogen is concerned. The technical name of these bacteria is\r\n_Rhizobium leguminosarum_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76.--Free-living nitrogen absorbing bacteria\r\n“Azotobacter.” Note their large size as compared with other bacteria\r\nshown in this book.]\r\n\r\nThere are also types of “free-living,” as distinguished from these\r\nsymbiotic, bacteria which absorb the free nitrogen of the air and aid\r\nmaterially in keeping up this supply under natural conditions. One\r\nof the most important of these types is the aërobic “Azotobacter”\r\n(Fig. 76), while another is the anaërobic _Clostridium pasteurianum_.\r\nThe nitrogen which is absorbed is built up into the protein material\r\nof the cell body and this latter must in all probability be “worked\r\nover” by various types of decomposition bacteria and by the nitrous\r\nand nitric organisms and be converted into utilizable nitrates just\r\nas other protein material is, as has been discussed in Chapter X. At\r\nany rate there is as yet no definite knowledge of any other method of\r\ntransformation. Up to the present no intentional practical utilization\r\nof this valuable property of these free-living forms has been made.\r\n\r\n=Nitrogen Nutrition of Green Plants.=--It is the belief of botanists\r\nthat green plants obtain their nitrogen chiefly in the form of\r\nnitrates, though ammonium salts may be utilized to some extent by\r\ncertain plants at least. Exceptions to this general rule are those\r\nplants provided with root tubercles (and the bog plants and others\r\nwhich have mycorrhiza?). These plants obtain their nitrogen in the\r\nform of organic compounds made for them by the bacteria growing in\r\nthe tubercles. That nitrogen circulates throughout the structure of\r\nplants in organic combination is certain. There does not appear to\r\nbe any reason why similar compounds which are soluble and diffusible\r\n(amino-acids?) should not be taken up through the roots of plants and\r\nutilized as such. _It seems to the author that this is very probably\r\nthe case._ Arguments in favor of this view are: (1) The nitrogen\r\nnutrition of leguminous and other plants with root nodules. (2) The\r\nclose symbiosis between “Azotobacter” and similar nitrogen-absorbing\r\nbacteria and many species of algæ in sea water at least. (3) The\r\nvigorous growth of plants in soils very rich in organic matter, which\r\ninhibits the production of nitrates by the nitrous-nitric bacteria\r\nwhen grown in culture, and possibly (?) in the soil, so that nitrates\r\nmay not account for the vigorous growth. (4) The effect of nitrate\r\nfertilizers is to add an amount of nitrogen to the crop much in excess\r\nof the amount added as nitrate. (5) The most fertile soils contain\r\nthe largest numbers of bacteria. The doctrine that nitrates furnish\r\nthe only nitrogen to plants was established before the activities of\r\nbacteria in the soil were suspected, and, so far as the author is\r\naware, has not been supported by experiments under conditions rigidly\r\ncontrolled as to sterility.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that one of the chief functions of soil bacteria is to\r\nprepare soluble organic compounds of nitrogen for the use of green\r\nplants and thus to make a “short cut” in the nitrogen cycle (p. 107),\r\nas now believed in, direct from the “decomposition bacteria” to green\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nExperiments have been made by different observers in growing seedling\r\nplants of various kinds in water culture with one or in some cases\r\nseveral of the amino-acids as sources of nitrogen. Most of these\r\nexperiments were disappointing. Plant proteins are not so different\r\nfrom animal proteins, or plant protoplasm (apart from the chlorophyl\r\nportions of plants) from animal protoplasm as to lead one to suppose\r\nthat it could be built up from one or two amino-acids any more than\r\nanimal protoplasm can. The author is strongly convinced that this\r\nsubject should be thoroughly investigated. It will require careful\r\nexperimentation and perhaps rather large funds to provide the amounts\r\nof amino-acids that would probably be needed, but might result in a\r\ndecided change in our ideas of soil fertility, and especially in the\r\nuse of nitrogen fertilizers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nPHYSIOLOGICAL ACTIVITIES (CONTINUED).\r\n\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION OF ENZYMES.\r\n\r\nMost of the physiological activities of bacteria which have been\r\ndiscussed are due to the action of these peculiar substances, so that\r\na knowledge of their properties is essential. This knowledge cannot as\r\nyet be exact because no enzyme has, up to the present, been obtained in\r\na “pure state,” though it must be admitted that there are no certain\r\ncriteria which will enable this “pure state” to be recognized. It was\r\nformerly thought that they were protein in nature, but very “pure” and\r\nactive enzymes have been prepared which did not give the characteristic\r\nprotein reactions, so this idea must be abandoned. That they are large\r\nmoleculed colloidal substances closely related to the proteins in many\r\nrespects must still be maintained. There are certain characteristics\r\nwhich belong to enzymes, though no one of them exclusively. These may\r\nbe enumerated as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Enzymes are _dead_ organic chemical substances.\r\n\r\n_Dead_ is used in the sense of non-living, never having lived, not in\r\nthe sense of “ceased to be alive.”\r\n\r\n2. They are always produced by _living_ cells:\r\n\r\nSometimes as active enzymes, sometimes as _pro-enzymes_ or _zymogens_\r\nwhich are converted into enzymes outside the cell by acids, other\r\ninorganic substances or other enzymes.\r\n\r\n3. They produce very great chemical changes without themselves being\r\nappreciably affected.\r\n\r\nEnzymes will not continue to act indefinitely, but are used up in the\r\nprocess (combination with products?). The amount of change is so great\r\nin proportion to the amount of enzyme that the above statement is\r\njustified in the relative sense. Thus a milk-curdling enzyme has been\r\nprepared that would precipitate 100,000,000 times its own weight of\r\ncaseinogen.\r\n\r\n4. Their action is specific in that each enzyme acts on one kind of\r\nchemical substance only, and the products are always the same.\r\n\r\nThe substance may be combined with a variety of other chemical\r\nsubstances so that the action appears to be on several, but in reality\r\nit is on a definite group of molecules in each instance. For example,\r\nemulsin attacks several different glucosides but always sets free\r\ndextrose from them.\r\n\r\n5. The action is inhibited and eventually stopped, and in some cases\r\nthe enzyme is destroyed by an accumulation of the products of the\r\naction. If the products are removed, the action will continue, if the\r\nenzyme is not destroyed. This effect is explained partly because the\r\nenzyme probably combines with some of the products, since it does\r\nnot act indefinitely, and partly because of the reversibility of the\r\nreaction.\r\n\r\n6. Like many chemical reactions those of enzymes are reversible, that\r\nis, the substance broken up may be reformed by it from the products\r\nproduced in many instances. Thus:\r\n\r\n  maltose + maltase ⇆ glucose + glucose + maltase.\r\n\r\n      fat + lipase ⇆ glycerin + fatty acid + lipase.\r\n\r\n7. The presence of certain mineral salts seems to be essential for\r\ntheir action. These and other substances which are necessary are\r\nsometimes called _co-enzymes_. A salt of calcium is most favorable for\r\na great many.\r\n\r\n8. They may be adsorbed like other colloids by “shaking out” with\r\nfinely divided suspensions like charcoal or kaolin, or by other\r\ncolloids like aluminum hydroxide or proteins.\r\n\r\n9. When properly introduced into the tissues or blood of an animal,\r\nthey cause the body cells to form _anti-enzymes_ which will prevent the\r\naction of the enzyme (see Chapter XXVII).\r\n\r\n10. Though inert, they show many of the characteristics of living\r\norganisms, that is\r\n\r\n(_a_) Each enzyme has an optimum, a maximum and a minimum temperature\r\nfor its action.\r\n\r\nAll chemical reactions have such temperature limits, the distinction\r\nis that for enzymes as for living substance the _range_ is relatively\r\nnarrow.\r\n\r\n(_b_) High temperatures destroy enzymes. All in water are destroyed\r\nby boiling in time and most at temperatures considerably below the\r\nboiling-point. When dry, many will withstand a higher degree of heat\r\nthan 100° before they are destroyed.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Temperatures below the minimum stop their action, though they are\r\nnot destroyed by cold.\r\n\r\n(_d_) Many poisons and chemical disinfectants (Chapter XIV) which kill\r\nliving organisms will also stop the action of enzymes, though generally\r\nmore of the substance is required, so that it is possible to destroy\r\nthe living cells by such means and yet the action of the enzyme will\r\ncontinue.\r\n\r\n(_e_) Most enzymes have an optimum reaction of medium either acid,\r\nalkaline or neutral, depending on the particular enzyme, though some\r\nfew seem to act equally well within a considerable range on either side\r\nof the neutral point.\r\n\r\n_The final test for an enzyme is the chemical change it brings about in\r\nthe specific substance acted on._\r\n\r\nThe most prominent characteristic of enzymes is that they bring about\r\nvery great chemical changes without themselves being appreciably\r\naffected. This property is also shown by many inorganic substances\r\nwhich are spoken of as “catalytic agents” or “catalyzers” so that\r\nenzymes are sometimes called “organic catalyzers.” The function of\r\ncatalytic agents seems to be to hasten the rate of a reaction which\r\nwould occur spontaneously, though in a great many cases with extreme\r\nslowness.\r\n\r\nJust how enzymes act is not certain and probably will not be until\r\ntheir composition and constitution are known. Most probably they form a\r\ncombination with the substance acted on (_the substrate_) as a result\r\nof which there is a rearrangement of the atoms in such a way that new\r\ncompounds are formed, nearly always at least two, and the enzyme is at\r\nthe same time set free. It is rather remarkable that chiefly optically\r\nactive substances are split up by enzymes and where two modifications\r\nexist it is usually the dextro-rotatory one which is attacked. No\r\nsingle enzyme attacks both. This probably means that the structure of\r\nthe enzyme corresponds to that of the substrate, “fits it as a key fits\r\na lock,” as Emil Fischer says.\r\n\r\nThe production of enzymes is by no means restricted to bacteria since\r\nall kinds of living cells that have been investigated have been shown\r\nto produce them and presumably _all_ living cells do. Hence the\r\nnumber of different kinds of enzymes and of substances acted upon\r\nis practically unlimited. Nevertheless they may be grouped into a\r\ncomparatively few classes based on the general character of the change\r\nbrought about by them.\r\n\r\nI. Class I is the so-called _“splitting” enzymes_ whose action is\r\nfor the most part hydrolytic, that is, the substance takes up water\r\nand then splits into compounds that were apparently constituents of\r\nthe original molecule. As examples may be mentioned _diastase_, the\r\nenzyme first discovered, which changes starch into a malt-sugar, hence\r\nis more commonly called _amylase_[16] (starch-splitting enzyme);\r\n_invertase_,[16] which splits cane-sugar into dextrose and levulose:\r\nC₁₂H₂₂O₁₁ + H₂O = C₆H₁₂O₆ + C₆H₁₂O₆. _Lipase_[16] or a fat-splitting\r\nenzyme, which decomposes fat into glycerin and fatty acid:\r\n\r\n  C₃H₅(OC{n}H₂{n}₋₁O)₃ + 3H₂O = C₃H₅(OH)₃ + 3C{n}H₂{n}O₂.\r\n   Fat                        Glycerin   Fatty acid\r\n\r\n_Proteases_, which split up proteins into proteoses and peptones.\r\n\r\nOther classes of “splitting enzymes” break up the products of complex\r\nprotein decomposition, such as proteoses, peptones and amino-acids. A\r\nvariety of the “splitting enzymes” is the group of\r\n\r\n_“Coagulases” or coagulating enzymes_ as the rennet (lab, chymosin)\r\nwhich curdles milk; fibrin ferment (thrombin, thrombase) which causes\r\nthe coagulation of blood. These apparently act by splitting up a\r\nsubstance in the fluids mentioned, after which splitting one of the\r\nnew products formed combines with other compounds present (usually a\r\nmineral salt, and in the cases mentioned a calcium salt) to form an\r\ninsoluble compound, the curd or coagulum.\r\n\r\n_Another variety is the “activating” enzymes or “kinases”_ such as the\r\nenterokinase of the intestine. The action here is a splitting of the\r\n_zymogen_ or mother substance or form in which the enzyme is built up\r\nby the cell so as to liberate the active enzyme.\r\n\r\nOf a character quite distinct, from the splitting enzymes are\r\n\r\nII. The _zymases_. Their action seems to be to cause a “shifting on\r\nrearrangement of the carbon atoms” so that new compounds are formed\r\nwhich are not assumed to have been constituents of the original\r\nmolecule. Most commonly there is a closer combination of the carbon and\r\noxygen atoms, frequently even the formation of CO₂ so that considerable\r\nenergy is thus liberated. Examples are the _zymase_ or _alcoholase_ of\r\nyeast which converts sugar into alcohol and carbon dioxide; C₆H₁₂O₆\r\n= 2C₂H₆O + 2CO₂: also _urease_, which causes the change of urea into\r\nammonia and carbon dioxide. Another common zymase is the _lactacidase_\r\nin lactic acid fermentation.\r\n\r\nIII. _Oxidizing enzymes_ also play an important part in many of the\r\nactivities of higher plants and animals. Among the bacteria this action\r\nis illustrated by the formation of nitrites, nitrates and sulphates and\r\nthe oxidation of alcohol to acetic acid as already described.\r\n\r\nIV. _Reducing enzymes_ occur in many of the dentrifying bacteria and\r\nin those which liberate H₂S from sulphates. A very widely distributed\r\nreducing enzyme is “catalase” which decomposes hydrogen peroxide.\r\n\r\nAs previously stated, most of the physiological activities of\r\nbacteria are due to the enzymes that they produce. It is evident\r\nthat for action to occur on substances which do not diffuse into the\r\nbacterial cell--starches, cellulose, complex proteins, gelatin--the\r\nenzymes must _pass out_ of the bacterium and consequently may be\r\nfound in the surrounding medium. Substances like sugars, peptones,\r\nalcohol, which are readily diffusible, may be acted on by enzymes\r\n_retained within_ the cell body. In the former case the enzymes are\r\nspoken of as extra-cellular or “_exo-enzymes_,” and in the latter as\r\nintra-cellular or “_endo-enzymes_.” The endo-enzymes and doubtless also\r\nthe exo-enzymes may after the death of the cell digest the contents\r\nto a greater or less extent and thus furnish substances that are\r\nnot otherwise obtainable. This process of “self-digestion” is known\r\ntechnically as “_autolysis_.”\r\n\r\nA distinction was formerly made between “organized” and “unorganized\r\nferments.” The former term was applied to the minute living organisms,\r\nbacteria, yeasts, molds, etc., which bring about characteristic\r\nfermentative changes, while the latter term was restricted to enzymes\r\nas just described. Since investigation has shown that the changes\r\nascribed to the “organized ferments” are really due to their enzymes,\r\nand that enzymes are probably formed by all living cells, the\r\ndistinction is scarcely necessary at present.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION OF TOXINS.\r\n\r\nThe injurious effects of pathogenic bacteria are due in large part to\r\nthe action of these substances, which in many respects bear a close\r\nrelationship to enzymes. The chemical composition is unknown since\r\nno toxin has been prepared “pure” as yet. It was formerly thought\r\nthat they were protein in character, but very pure toxins have been\r\nprepared which failed to show the characteristic protein reactions. It\r\nis well established that they are complex substances, of rather large\r\nmolecule and are precipitated by many of the reagents which precipitate\r\nproteins. Toxins will be further discussed in Chapter XXVII. It will\r\nbe sufficient at this point to enumerate their chief peculiarities in\r\norder to show their marked resemblance to enzymes.\r\n\r\n1. Toxins are _dead_ organic chemical substances.\r\n\r\n2. They are always produced by _living_ cells.\r\n\r\n3. They are active poisons in _very small quantities_.[17]\r\n\r\n4. Their action is specific in that each toxin acts on a particular\r\nkind of cell. The fact that a so-called toxin acts on several\r\ndifferent kinds of cells, possibly indicates a mixture of several\r\ntoxins, or action on the _same substance_ in the cells.\r\n\r\n5. Toxins are very sensitive to the action of injurious agencies such\r\nas heat, light, etc., and in about the same measure that enzymes are,\r\nthough as a rule they are somewhat more sensitive or “labile.”\r\n\r\n6. Toxins apparently have maxima, optima, and minima of temperature for\r\ntheir action, as shown by the destructive effect of heat and by the\r\nfact that a frog injected with tetanus toxin and kept at 20° shows no\r\nindication of poison, but if the temperature is raised to 37°, symptoms\r\nof poisoning are soon apparent. Cold, however, does not destroy a toxin.\r\n\r\n7. When properly introduced into the tissues of animals they cause the\r\nbody cells to form antitoxins (Chapter XXVII) which are capable of\r\npreventing the action of the toxin in question.\r\n\r\n8. _The determining test for a toxin is its action on a living cell._\r\n\r\nIt is true that enzymes are toxic, as are also various foreign\r\nproteins, when injected into an animal, but in much larger doses than\r\nare toxins.\r\n\r\nA marked difference between enzymes and toxins is that the former may\r\nbring about a very great chemical change and still may be recovered\r\nfrom the mixture of substances acted on and produced, while the toxin\r\nseems to be permanently used up in its toxic action and cannot be\r\nso recovered. _Toxins seem very much like enzymes whose action is\r\nrestricted to living cells._\r\n\r\nJust as enzymes are probably produced by all kinds of cells and not by\r\nbacteria alone, so toxins are produced by other organisms. Among toxins\r\nwhich have been carefully studied are _ricin_, the poison of the castor\r\noil plant (_Ricinus communis_); _abrin_ of the jequirity bean (_Abrus\r\nprecatorius_); _robin_ of the common locust (_Robinia pseudacacia_);\r\npoisons of spiders, scorpions, bees, fish, snakes and salamanders.\r\n\r\nIt has been stated that some enzymes are thrown out from the cell and\r\nothers are retained within the cell. The same is true of toxins, hence\r\nwe speak of _exo-toxins_ or toxins excreted from, and _endo-toxins_\r\nor toxins retained within the cell. Among the pathogenic bacteria\r\nthere are very few which secrete toxins when growing outside the body.\r\n_Clostridium tetani_ or lockjaw bacillus, _Corynebacterium diphtheriæ_\r\nor the diphtheria bacillus, _Clostridium botulinum_ or a bacillus\r\ncausing a type of food poisoning, _Pseudomonas pyocyanea_ or the blue\r\npus bacillus are the most important. Other pathogenic bacteria do not\r\nsecrete their toxins under the above conditions, but only give them up\r\nwhen the cell is disintegrated either within or outside the body. For\r\nthe reason that endotoxins are therefore difficult to obtain, their\r\ncharacteristics have not been much studied. The description of toxins\r\nas above given is intended to apply to the _exo-toxins_ of bacteria,\r\nsometimes spoken of as _true toxins_, and to the vegetable toxins\r\n(phytotoxins) which resemble them.\r\n\r\nThe snake venoms and probably most of the animal toxins (zoötoxins) are\r\nvery different substances. (See Chapter XXIX.)\r\n\r\n\r\nCAUSATION OF DISEASE.\r\n\r\nThis subject belongs properly in special pathogenic bacteriology. It\r\nwill be sufficient to indicate that bacteria may cause disease in one\r\nor more of the following ways: (_a_) blocking circulatory vessels,\r\neither blood or lymph, directly or indirectly; (_b_) destruction of\r\ntissue; (_c_) production of non-specific poisons (ptomaines, bases,\r\nnitrites, acids, gases, etc.); (_d_) production of specific poisons\r\n(toxins).\r\n\r\n\r\nANTIBODY FORMATION.\r\n\r\nBacteria cause the formation of specific “antibodies” when properly\r\nintroduced into animals. This must be considered as a physiological\r\nactivity since it is by means of substances produced within the\r\nbacterial cell that the body cells of animals are stimulated to form\r\nantibodies. (See Chapters XXVI-XXIX.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSTAINING.\r\n\r\nThe reaction of bacteria to various stains is dependent on their\r\nphysico-chemical structure and hence is a result of physiological\r\nprocesses, but is best discussed separately (Chapter XIX).\r\n\r\n\r\nCULTURAL CHARACTERISTICS.\r\n\r\nThe same is true of the appearance and growth on different culture\r\nmedia. (Chapter XX.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\nDISINFECTION--STERILIZATION--DISINFECTANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe discussion of the physiology of bacteria in the preceding chapters\r\nhas shown that a number of environmental factors must be properly\r\ncorrelated in order that a given organism may thrive. Conversely, it\r\ncan be stated that any one of these environmental factors may be so\r\nvaried that the organism will be more or less injured, may even be\r\ndestroyed by such variation. It has been the thorough study of the\r\nabove-mentioned relationships which has led to practical methods for\r\ndestroying bacteria, for removing them or preventing their growth when\r\nsuch procedures become necessary.\r\n\r\nThe process of killing all the living organisms or of removing them\r\ncompletely is spoken of as _disinfection_ or as _sterilization_,\r\naccording to circumstances. Thus the latter term is applied largely in\r\nthe laboratory, while the former more generally in practice outside the\r\nlaboratory. So also disinfection is most commonly done with chemical\r\nagents and sterilization by physical means, though exceptions are\r\nnumerous. The original idea of disinfection was the destruction of\r\n“infective” organisms, that is, organisms producing disease in man or\r\nanimals. A wider knowledge of bacteriology has led to the application\r\nof the term to the destruction of other organisms as well. Thus the\r\ncheese-maker “disinfects” his curing rooms to prevent abnormal ripening\r\nof cheese, and the dairy-worker “disinfects” his premises to avoid bad\r\nflavors, abnormal changes in the butter or milk. _Sterilization_ is\r\nmore commonly applied to relatively small objects and _disinfection_ to\r\nlarger ones. Thus in the laboratory, instruments, glassware, apparatus,\r\netc., are “sterilized” while desks, walls and floors are “disinfected.”\r\nThe surgeon “sterilizes” his instruments, but “disinfects” his\r\noperating table and room. The dairy-workers mentioned above sterilize\r\ntheir apparatus, pails, milk bottles, etc. Evidently the object of the\r\ntwo processes is the same, removing or destroying living organisms, the\r\nname to be applied is largely a question of usage and circumstances.\r\nAny agent which is used to destroy microörganisms is called a\r\n“disinfectant.” Material freed from _living_ organisms is “sterile.”\r\n\r\nThe process of _preventing the growth_ of organisms without reference\r\nto whether they are killed or removed is spoken of as “_antisepsis_,”\r\nand the agent as an _antiseptic_. Hence a mildly applied “disinfectant”\r\nbecomes an “antiseptic,” though it does not necessarily follow that\r\nan “antiseptic” may become a disinfectant when used abundantly. Thus\r\nstrong sugar solutions prevent the development of many organisms,\r\nthough they do not necessarily kill them.\r\n\r\n_Asepsis_ is a term which is restricted almost entirely to surgical\r\noperations and implies the taking of such precautions that foreign\r\norganisms are _kept out_ of the field of operation. Such an operation\r\nis an _aseptic_ one, or performed _aseptically_.\r\n\r\nA “deodorant or deodorizer” is used to destroy or remove an odor and\r\ndoes not necessarily have either antiseptic or disinfectant properties.\r\n\r\nThe agents which are used for the above-described processes may be\r\nconveniently divided into _physical agents_ and _chemical agents_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSICAL AGENTS.\r\n\r\n=1. Drying.=--This is doubtless the oldest method for _preventing the\r\ngrowth_ of organisms, and the one which is used on the greatest amount\r\nof material at the present time. A very large percentage of commercial\r\nproducts is preserved and transported intact because the substances\r\nare kept free from moisture. In the laboratory many materials which\r\nare used as food for bacteria (see Chapter XVI) “keep” because they\r\nare dry. Nevertheless, drying should be considered as an _antiseptic_\r\nrather than as a _disinfectant_ process. While it is true that the\r\n_complete_ removal of water would result in the death of all organisms\r\nthis necessitates a high temperature, in itself destructive, and does\r\nnot occur in practice. Further, though many pathogenic bacteria are\r\nkilled by drying, many more, including the spore formers, are not.\r\nHence drying alone is not a practical method of _disinfecting_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77.--A small laboratory hot-air sterilizer.]\r\n\r\n=2. Heat.=--The use of heat in some form is one of the very best\r\nmeans for destroying bacteria. It may be made use of by combustion,\r\nor burning, as direct exposure to the open flame, as dry heat (hot\r\nair), or as moist heat (boiling water or steam). Very frequently in\r\nveterinary practice, especially in the country, occasionally under\r\nother conditions, the infected material is best burned. This method is\r\nthoroughly effective and frequently the cheapest in the end. Wherever\r\nthere are no valid objections it should be used. Exposure to the open\r\nflame is largely a laboratory procedure to sterilize small metallic\r\ninstruments and even small pieces of glassware. It is an excellent\r\nprocedure in postmortem examinations to burn off the surface of the\r\nbody or of an organ when it is desired to obtain bacteria from the\r\ninterior free from contamination with surface organisms.\r\n\r\n_Dry Heat._--Dry heat is not nearly so effective as moist heat as a\r\nsterilizing agent. The temperature must be higher and continued longer\r\nto accomplish the same result. Thus a dry heat of 150° for thirty\r\nminutes is no more efficient than steam under pressure at 115° for\r\nfifteen minutes. Various forms of hot-air sterilizers are made for\r\nlaboratory purposes (Fig. 77). On account of the greater length of\r\ntime required for sterilization their use is more and more restricted\r\nto objects which must be used dry, as in blood and serum work, for\r\nexample. In practice the use of hot air in disinfecting plants is now\r\nlargely restricted to objects which might be injured by steam, as\r\nleather goods, furs, and certain articles of furniture, but even here\r\nchemical agents are more frequently used.\r\n\r\n_Moist Heat._--Moist heat may be applied either by boiling in water\r\nor by the use of steam at air pressure, or, for rapid work and on\r\nsubstances that would not be injured, by steam under pressure.\r\nBoiling is perhaps the best household method for disinfecting all\r\nmaterial which can be so treated. The method is simple, can always\r\nbe made use of, and is universally understood. It must be remembered\r\nthat all pathogenic organisms, even their spores, are destroyed by a\r\nfew minutes’ boiling. The process may be applied to more resistant\r\norganisms, such as are met with in canning vegetables, though the\r\nboiling must be continued for several hours, or what is better,\r\nrepeated on several different days. This latter process, known as\r\n“_discontinuous sterilization_,” or “_tyndallization_,” must also be\r\napplied to substances which would be injured or changed in composition\r\nby too long-continued heating, such as gelatin, milk, and certain\r\nsugars. In the laboratory such materials are boiled or subjected to\r\nsteaming steam for half an hour on each of three successive days. In\r\ncanning vegetables the boiling should be from one to two hours each\r\nday. The principle involved is that the first boiling destroys the\r\ngrowing cells, but not all spores. Some of the latter germinate by the\r\nnext day and are then killed by the second boiling and the remainder\r\ndevelop and are killed on the third day. Occasionally a fourth boiling\r\nis necessary. It is also true that repeated heating and cooling is more\r\ndestructive to bacteria than continuous heating for the same length of\r\ntime, but the development of the spores is the more important factor.\r\nDiscontinuous heating may also be used at temperatures below the\r\nboiling-point for the sterilization of fluids like blood serum which\r\nwould be coagulated by boiling. In this case the material is heated at\r\n55° to 56° for one hour, but on each of seven to ten successive days.\r\nThe intermittent heating and cooling is of the same importance as the\r\ndevelopment of the spores in this case. (Better results are secured\r\nwith such substances by collecting them aseptically in the first place.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78.--The Arnold steam sterilizer for laboratory\r\nuse.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79.--Vertical gas-heated laboratory autoclave.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 80.--Horizontal gas-heated laboratory autoclave.]\r\n\r\n_Steam._--Steam is one of the most commonly employed agents for\r\nsterilization and disinfection. It is used either as “streaming steam”\r\nat air pressure or confined under pressure so that the temperature is\r\nraised. For almost all purposes where boiling is applicable streaming\r\nsteam may be substituted. It is just as efficient and frequently\r\nmore easily applied. The principle of the numerous forms of “steam\r\nsterilizers” (Fig. 78) is essentially the same. There is a receptacle\r\nfor a relatively small quantity of water and means for conducting the\r\nsteam generated by boiling this water to the objects to be treated,\r\nwhich are usually placed immediately above the water. Surgical\r\ninstruments may be most conveniently sterilized by boiling or by\r\nsteaming in especially constructed instrument sterilizers. If boiled,\r\nthe addition of carbonate of soda, about 1 per cent., usually prevents\r\ninjury.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 81.--A battery of two horizontal autoclaves in one\r\nof the author’s student laboratories. Steam is furnished direct from\r\nthe University central heating plant.]\r\n\r\n_Steam under pressure_ affords a much more rapid and certain method of\r\ndestroying organisms. Fifteen to twenty pounds pressure corresponding\r\nto temperatures of 121° to 125° is commonly used. Variations depend on\r\nthe bulk and nature of the material. Apparatus for this purpose may\r\nnow be obtained from sizes as small as one or two gallons up to huge\r\nstructures which will take one or two truckloads of material (Figs.\r\n79-91). The latter type is in common use in canning factories, dairy\r\nplants, hospitals, public institutions, municipal and governmental\r\ndisinfecting stations. Very frequently there is an apparatus attached\r\nfor producing a vacuum, both to exhaust the air before sterilizing,\r\nso that the steam penetrates much more quickly and thoroughly and for\r\nremoving the vapor after sterilizing, thus hastening the drying out of\r\nthe material disinfected.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 82.--A “process kettle” (steam-pressure sterilizer)\r\nused in canning. Diameter, 40 inches; height, 72 inches.]\r\n\r\nThe smaller types of pressure sterilizers are called “autoclaves”\r\nand have become indispensable in laboratory work. Fifteen pounds\r\npressure maintained for fifteen minutes is commonly sufficient for a\r\nfew small objects. For larger masses much longer time is needed. The\r\nauthor found that in an autoclave of the type shown in Fig. 81 it\r\nrequired ten minutes for 500 cc. of water at 15 pounds pressure to\r\nreach a temperature of 100°, starting at room temperatures, 20° to\r\n25°. Autoclaves may be used as simple steam sterilizers by leaving the\r\nescape valves open so that the steam is not confined, hence they have\r\nlargely replaced the latter.[18]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 83.--Horizontal steam chest used in canning.\r\nHeight, 32 inches; width, 28 inches; length, 10 feet.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 84.--A battery of horizontal rectangular steam\r\nchests in actual use in a canning factory.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 85.--A battery of cylindrical process kettles in\r\nactual use in a canning factory.]\r\n\r\nA process closely akin to sterilization by heat is _pasteurization_.\r\nThis means the heating of material at a temperature and for a time\r\nwhich will destroy the actively growing bacteria but not the spores.\r\nThe methods for doing this vary but are essentially two in principle.\r\n1. The material in small quantities in suitable containers (bottles) is\r\nplaced in the apparatus; the temperature is raised to 60° to 65° and\r\nmaintained for twenty to thirty minutes and then the whole is cooled\r\n(beer, wine, grape juice, bottled milk) (Figs. 92, 93 and 94).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 86.--A steam chamber used in government\r\ndisinfection work. Size, 4 feet 4 inches × 5 feet 4 inches × 9 feet.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 87.--Circular steam chamber used in government\r\ndisinfection work, 54 inches in diameter.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 88.--Portable steam chamber used in government\r\ndisinfection work.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 89.--Steam chambers on deck of the U. S. quarantine\r\nstation barge “Defender.”]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 90.--Steam chambers in hold of U. S. quarantine\r\nstation barge “Protector.” Disinfected space.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 91.--Municipal disinfecting station, Washington,\r\nD. C.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 92.--A pasteurizer for milk in bottles.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 93.--A pasteurizer for grape juice, cider, etc., in\r\nbottles.]\r\n\r\n2. Pasteurizing machines are used and the fluid flows through\r\ncontinuously. In one type the temperature is raised to 60° and by\r\n“retarders” is kept at this temperature for twenty to thirty minutes\r\n(Figs. 95 to 98). In another type the temperature is raised to as\r\nhigh as 85° for a few seconds only, “flash process” (Fig. 99), and then\r\nthe material is rapidly cooled. It is certain that all pathogenic\r\nmicroörganisms, except the very few spore formers in that stage, are\r\nkilled by proper pasteurization. The process is largely employed in the\r\nfermentation and dairy industries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 94.--A pasteurizer for beer in bottles.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 95.--A continuous milk pasteurizer.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 96.--A pasteurizer for cream to be used in making\r\nice-cream.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 97.--A continuous milk pasteurizer with holder;\r\ncapacity 1500 pounds per hour. _A_, pasteurizer--the milk flows in\r\ntubes inside of a jacket of water heated to the proper temperature;\r\n_B_, holder; _C_, water cooler; _D_, brine cooler.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 98.--A continuous pasteurizing plant in operation.\r\nSimilar to Fig. 97 but larger. Capacity, 12,000 pounds per hour. _A_,\r\npasteurizer; _B_, seven compartment holder; _C_, _D_, coolers.]\r\n\r\n=3. Cold.=--That _cold_ is an excellent _antiseptic_ is illustrated\r\nby the general use of refrigerators and “cold storage.” Numerous\r\nexperiments have shown that although many pathogenic organisms of a\r\ngiven kind are killed by temperatures below freezing, not all of the\r\nsame kind are, and many kinds are only slightly affected. Hence cold\r\ncannot be considered a practical means for _disinfection_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 99.--A “flash process” pasteurizing outfit, with\r\nholder. _A_, flash pasteurizer; _B_, holder; _C_, cooler.]\r\n\r\n=4. Light.=--It has been stated (p. 75) that light is destructive to\r\nbacteria, and the advisability of having well-lighted habitations\r\nfor men and animals has been mentioned. The practice of “sunning”\r\nbedclothing, hangings and other large articles which can scarcely be\r\ndisinfected in a more convenient way is the usual method of employing\r\nthis agent. Drying and the action of the oxygen of the air assist\r\nthe process to some extent. Undoubtedly large numbers of pathogenic\r\norganisms are destroyed under natural conditions by the combined\r\neffects of drying, direct sunlight and oxidation, but it should not\r\nbe forgotten that a very slight protection will prevent the action of\r\nlight (Figs. 100 and 101).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 100.--Effect of light on bacteria. × 7/10. The\r\nplate was inoculated in the usual way. A letter _H_ of black paper was\r\npasted on the bottom. The plate was then exposed for four hours to the\r\nsun in January outside the window and then incubated. The black paper\r\nprotected the bacteria. Outside of it they were killed except where\r\nthey happened to be in large masses. Hence the letter shows distinctly.\r\n(Student preparation.)]\r\n\r\n=5. Osmotic Pressure.=--Increase in the concentration of substances\r\nin solution is in practical use as an _antiseptic_ procedure.\r\nVarious kinds of “sugar preserves,” salt meats and condensed milk\r\nare illustrations. It must be remembered that a similar increase in\r\nconcentration occurs when many substances are dried, and is probably\r\nas valuable in the preservative action as the loss of water. That the\r\nprocess cannot be depended on to _kill_ even pathogenic organisms is\r\nshown by finding living tubercle bacilli in condensed milk. The placing\r\nof bacteria in water or in salt solution in order to have them die and\r\ndisintegrate (greatly aided by vigorous shaking in a shaking machine)\r\n(“autolysis,” p. 126) is a laboratory procedure to obtain cell\r\nconstituents. It is not a practical method of disinfection, however.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 101.--Effect of light on bacteria. × 7/10. This\r\nplate was treated exactly as the plate in Fig. 100, except that the\r\nletter is _L_, and that it was exposed inside the window and wire\r\nscreen. The window was plate glass. It is evident that few of the\r\nbacteria were killed, since the letter _L_ is barely outlined. The\r\nexposure was at the same time as the plate in Fig. 100. (Student\r\npreparation.)]\r\n\r\n=6. Electricity.=--Electricity, though not in itself injurious to\r\nbacteria, is used as an indirect means for destroying bacteria in a\r\npractical way. This is done by electrical production of some substance\r\nwhich is destructive to bacteria as in ozone water purification\r\n(Petrograd, Florence, and elsewhere), or the use of ultra-violet rays\r\nfor the same purpose (Marseilles, Paris) and for treatment of certain\r\ndisease conditions. Electricity might be used as a source of heat for\r\ndisinfecting purposes should its cheapness justify it. It has also\r\nbeen used in the preservation of meats to hasten the _penetration of\r\nthe salt_ and thus reduce the time of pickling. Electrolyzed sea water\r\nhas been tried as a means of flushing and disinfecting streets, but\r\nit is very doubtful if the added expense is justified by any increased\r\nbenefit. A number of electric devices have been put forth for various\r\nsterilizing and disinfecting purposes and doubtless will continue to\r\nbe, but everyone should be carefully tested before money is invested in\r\nit.[19]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 102.--An electric milk purifier (pasteurizer). The\r\nmilk flowing from cup to cup completes the circuit when the current is\r\non. The effect is certainly a heat effect. Sparking occurs at the lips\r\nof the cups.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 103.--One of the ten filter beds of the Columbus\r\nwater filtration plant with the filtering material removed.

Filtration.=--Filtration is a process for rendering fluids sterile\r\nby passing them through some material which will hold back the\r\nbacteria. It is used on a large scale in the purification of water for\r\nsanitary or manufacturing reasons (Fig. 103). Air is also rendered\r\n“germ free” in some surgical operating rooms, “serum laboratories” and\r\nbreweries by filtration. In the laboratory it is a very common method\r\nof sterilizing liquids which would be injured by any other process.\r\nThe apparatus consists of a porous cylinder with proper devices for\r\ncausing the liquid to pass through either by suction (Fig. 104) where\r\nthe pressure will be only one atmosphere (approximately 15 pounds per\r\nsquare inch), or by the use of compressed air at any desired pressure\r\n(Fig. 105). The two main types of porous cylinders (“filter candles,”\r\n“bougies”) are the Pasteur-Chamberland (Fig. 106) and the Berkefeld.\r\nThe former are made of unglazed porcelain of different degrees of\r\nfineness, the latter of diatomaceous earth (Fig. 107) The Mandler\r\nfilter of this same material is now manufactured in the United States\r\nand is equal if not superior to the Berkefeld. The designs of complete\r\napparatus are numerous.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 106.--Pasteur-Chamberland filter candles about\r\none-half natural size.]\r\n\r\n=8. Burying.=--This is a time-honored method of disposing of infected\r\nmaterial of all kinds and at first thought might not be considered\r\na means of _disinfection_. As a matter of fact, under favorable\r\nconditions it is an excellent method. The infected material is\r\nremoved. Pathogenic organisms tend to die out in the soil owing to an\r\nunfavorable environment as to temperature and food supply, competition\r\nwith natural soil organisms for what food there is, and the injurious\r\neffects of the products of these organisms. Care must be taken that\r\nthe burial is done in such a way that the _surface_ soil is not\r\ncontaminated either directly or by material brought up from below by\r\ndigging or burrowing animals, insects, worms, or movement of ground\r\nwater to the surface. Also that the underground water supply which is\r\ndrawn upon for use by men or animals is not contaminated. Frequently\r\ninfected material, carcasses of animals, etc., are treated in some\r\nway so as to aid the natural process of destruction of the organisms\r\npresent, especially by the use of certain chemical agents, as quicklime\r\n(see p. 158).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 107.--Berkefeld filter candles about one-half\r\nnatural size.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nDISINFECTION AND STERILIZATION (CONTINUED).\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL AGENTS.\r\n\r\nA very large number of chemical substances might be used for destroying\r\nbacteria or preventing their growth either through direct injurious\r\naction or by the effect of concentration. Those which are practically\r\nuseful are relatively few, though this is one of the commonest methods\r\nof disinfecting and the word “disinfectant” is frequently wrongly\r\nrestricted to chemical agents.\r\n\r\nChemical agents act on bacteria in a variety of ways. Most commonly\r\nthere is direct union of the chemical with the protoplasm of the cell\r\nand consequent injury. Some times the chemical is first precipitated\r\non the surface of the cell without penetrating at once. If removed\r\nsoon enough, the organism is not destroyed. This is true of bichloride\r\nof mercury and formaldehyde. If bacteria treated with these agents in\r\ninjurious strength be washed with ammonia or ammonium sulphate, even\r\nafter a time which would otherwise result in their failure to grow,\r\nthey will develop. Some chemicals change the reaction of the material\r\nin a direction unfavorable to growth, and if the change is enough,\r\nmay even kill the bacteria. Some agents remove a chemical substance\r\nnecessary to the growth of the organism and hence inhibit it. Such\r\nactions are mainly preventive (antiseptic) and become disinfectant only\r\nafter a long time.\r\n\r\n\r\nELEMENTS.\r\n\r\n=Oxygen.=--Oxygen as it occurs in the air is probably not injurious\r\nto living bacteria but aids them with the exception of the anaërobes.\r\nIn the nascent state especially as liberated from ozone (O₃)\r\nhydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) and hypochlorites (Ca(ClO)₂) it is strongly\r\nbactericidal.\r\n\r\n=Chlorine.=--Chlorine is actively disinfectant and is coming into use\r\nfor sterilizing water on a large scale in municipal plants (Fig. 108).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 108.--Apparatus for sterilizing water with liquid\r\nchlorine.]\r\n\r\n_Iodine_ finds extended use in aseptic surgical operations and\r\nantiseptic dressings. Bromine, mercury, silver, gold, nickel, zinc\r\nand copper are markedly germicidal in the elemental state but are not\r\npractical.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPOUNDS.\r\n\r\n=Calcium Oxide.=--Calcium oxide (CaO), _quick lime_, is an excellent\r\ndisinfectant for stables, yards, outhouses, etc., where it is used\r\nin the freshly slaked condition as “white wash;” also to disinfect\r\ncarcasses to be buried. It is very efficient against the typhoid\r\nbacillus in water, where it is much used to assist in the softening.\r\n\r\n=Chloride of Lime.=--Chloride of lime, _bleaching powder_, which\r\nconsists of calcium hypochlorite, the active agent, and chloride and\r\nsome unchanged quicklime is one of the most useful disinfectants. It\r\nis employed to sterilize water for drinking purposes on a large scale\r\nand to disinfect sewage plant effluents. A 5 per cent. solution is the\r\nproper strength for ordinary disinfection. Only a supply which is fresh\r\nor has been kept in air-tight containers should be used, as it rapidly\r\nloses strength on exposure to the air. The active agent is nascent\r\noxygen liberated from the decomposition of the hypochlorite.\r\n\r\n=Sodium Hypochlorite.=--Sodium hypochlorite prepared by the\r\nelectrolysis of common salt has been used to some extent.\r\n\r\n=Bichloride of Mercury.=--Bichloride of mercury, _mercuric chloride,\r\ncorrosive sublimate_ (HgCl₂), is the strongest of all disinfectants\r\nunder proper conditions. It is also extremely poisonous to men and\r\nanimals and great care is necessary in its use. It is precipitated by\r\nalbuminous substances and attacks metallic objects, hence should not be\r\nused in the presence of these classes of substances.\r\n\r\nIt is used in a strength of one part HgCl₂ to 1000 of water for general\r\ndisinfection. Ammonium chloride or sodium chloride, common salt, in\r\nquantities equal to the bichloride, or citric acid in one-half of the\r\namount should be added in making large quantities of solution or for\r\nuse with albuminous fluids to prevent precipitation of the mercury\r\n(Fig. 109).\r\n\r\nNone of the other metallic salts are of value as practical\r\ndisinfectants aside from their use in surgical practice. In this\r\nlatter class come boric acid, silver nitrate, potassium permanganate.\r\nThe strong mineral acids and alkalies are, of course, destructive to\r\nbacteria, but their corrosive effect excludes them from practical use,\r\nexcept that “lye washes” are of value in cleaning floors and rough\r\nwood-work, but even here better _disinfection_ can be done more easily\r\nand safely.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 109.--Tanks for bichloride of mercury, government\r\nquarantine disinfecting plant.]\r\n\r\n\r\nORGANIC COMPOUNDS.\r\n\r\n=Carbolic Acid or Phenol.=--Carbolic acid or phenol (C₆H₅ OH) is one\r\nof the commonest agents in this class. It is used mostly in 5 per\r\ncent. solution as a disinfectant and in 0.5 per cent. solution as an\r\nantiseptic. For use in large quantities the crude is much cheaper and,\r\naccording to some experimenters, even more active than the pure acid,\r\nowing to the cresols it contains. The crude acid is commonly mixed with\r\nan equal volume of commercial sulphuric acid and the mixture is added\r\nto enough water to make a 5 per cent. dilution, which is stronger than\r\neither of the ingredients alone in 5 per cent. solution.\r\n\r\n=Cresols.=--The cresols (C₆H₄CH₃OH, ortho, meta and para), coal-tar\r\nderivatives, as phenol, are apparently more powerful disinfectants.\r\nA great number of preparations containing them have been put on the\r\nmarket. _Creolin_ is one which is very much used in veterinary practice\r\nand forms a milky fluid with water, while _lysol_ forms a clear frothy\r\nliquid owing to the presence of soap. Both of these appear to be more\r\nactive than carbolic acid and are less poisonous and more agreeable to\r\nuse. They are used in 2 to 5 per cent. solution.\r\n\r\n=Alcohol.=--Ordinary (ethyl) alcohol (C₂H₅OH) is largely used as a\r\n_preservative_, also as a disinfectant for the body surface, hands, and\r\narms. Experiments show that alcohol of 70 per cent. strength is most\r\nstrongly bactericidal and that absolute alcohol is very slightly so.\r\n\r\n=Soap.=--Experimenters have obtained many conflicting results with\r\nsoaps when tested on different organisms, as is to be expected from\r\nthe great variations in this article. Miss Vera McCoy in the author’s\r\nlaboratory carried out experiments with nine commercial soaps--Ivory,\r\nNaphtha, Packer’s Tar, Grandpa’s Tar, Balsam Peru, A. D. S. Carbolic,\r\nGerman Green, Dutch Cleanser, Sapolio--and obtained abundant growth\r\nfrom spores of _Bacillus anthracis_, from _Bacterium coli_ and from\r\n_Staphylococcus pyogenes aureus_ in all cases even when the organisms\r\nhad been exposed twenty-four hours in 5 per cent. solutions. From\r\nthese results and from the wide variations reported in the literature\r\nit is clear that _soap solutions alone cannot be depended on_ as\r\ndisinfectants. Medicated soaps do not appear to offer any advantages in\r\nthis respect. The amount of the disinfectant which goes into solution\r\nwhen the soap is dissolved is too small to have any effect.\r\n\r\n=Formaldehyde.=--Formaldehyde (HCHO) is perhaps the most largely used\r\nchemical disinfectant at the present time. The substance is a gas\r\nbut occurs most commonly in commerce as a watery solution containing\r\napproximately 40 per cent. of the gas. This solution is variously known\r\nas formalin, formol, and formaldehyde solution. The first two names\r\nare patented and the substance under these names usually costs more.\r\nIt is used in the gaseous form for disinfecting closed spaces of all\r\nkinds to the exclusion of most other means today. A great many types\r\nof formalin generators have been devised. The gas has little power of\r\npenetration and all material to be reached should be exposed as much as\r\npossible. The dry gas is almost ineffective, so that the objects must\r\nbe moistened or vapor generated along with the gas. A common method\r\nin use is to avoid expensive generators by pouring the formaldehyde\r\nsolution on permanganate of potash crystals placed in a vessel removed\r\nfrom inflammable objects on account of the heat developed which\r\noccasionally sets the gas on fire. The formalin is used in amounts\r\nvarying from 20 to 32 ounces to 8-1/2 to 13 ounces of permanganate to\r\neach 1000 cubic feet of space. This method is expensive since one pint\r\n(16 ounces) of formalin is sufficient for each 1000 cubic feet, and\r\nsince the permanganate is an added expense. Dr. Dixon, Commissioner of\r\nHealth of Pennsylvania, recommends the following mixture to replace the\r\npermanganate, claiming that it works more rapidly and is less expensive\r\nand just as efficient:\r\n\r\n  1. Sodium bichromate, ten ounces.\r\n  2. Saturated solution of formaldehyde, sixteen ounces.\r\n  3. Common sulphuric acid, one and a half ounces.\r\n\r\nTwo and three are mixed together and when cool are poured on the\r\nbichromate which is placed in an earthenware jar of a volume about ten\r\ntimes the quantity of fluid used. The quantities given are for each\r\n1000 cubic feet of space.\r\n\r\nA very simple method is to cause the formalin, diluted about twice\r\nwith water to furnish moisture enough, to drop by means of a regulated\r\n“separator funnel” on a heated iron plate. The dropping should be so\r\nregulated that each drop is vaporized as it falls. The plate must\r\nhave raised edges, pan-shaped, to prevent the drops rolling off when\r\nthey first strike the plate. Formaldehyde has no corrosive (except on\r\niron) or bleaching action, and is the most nearly ideal closed space\r\ndisinfectant today. In disinfecting stations it is made use of in\r\nclosed sterilizers such as were described under steam disinfection\r\nparticularly in connection with vacuum apparatus. It is also used\r\nin solution as a preservative and as a disinfectant. The commonest\r\nstrength is 2 or 3 per cent. of formalin or 0.8 to 1.2 per cent. of\r\nthe formaldehyde gas. As an _antiseptic_ it is efficient in dilutions\r\nas high as 1 to 2000 of the gas. It is very irritant to mucous\r\nmembranes of most individuals.\r\n\r\n=Anilin Dyes.=--Some of the anilin dyes show remarkable selective\r\ndisinfectant and antiseptic action on certain kinds of bacteria with\r\nlittle effect on others. This has been well shown by Churchman in his\r\nwork on Gentian Violet. This dye inhibits the growth of _Gram positive_\r\norganisms up to a dilution of one part in 300,000 while for _Gram\r\nnegative_ organisms it is without effect even in saturated solution.\r\nThis is nicely shown in the accompanying illustration. This inhibiting\r\neffect of anilin dyes is taken advantage of in several methods of\r\nisolating bacteria (Chapter XVIII).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 110.--The lower half of the plate is plain agar\r\nmedium, the upper half the same medium plus gentian violet to make one\r\npart in 300,000. The Gram positive organism is on the right and the\r\nGram negative on the left. Streak inoculations were made across both\r\nmedia.]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the above-discussed disinfectants a large number of\r\nsubstances, particularly organic, are used in medicine, surgery,\r\ndentistry, etc., as more or less strong antiseptics, and the list is a\r\nconstantly lengthening one.\r\n\r\nIn the laboratory chloroform, H₂O₂, ether and other volatile or easily\r\ndecomposable substances have been used to sterilize liquids which could\r\nnot be treated by heat or by filtration. The agent is removed either\r\nby slow evaporation or by exhausting the fluid with an air pump. The\r\nmethod is not very satisfactory, nor is absolute sterilization easily\r\naccomplished. It is much better to secure such liquids aseptically\r\nwhere possible.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nDISINFECTION AND STERILIZATION (CONTINUED).\r\n\r\n\r\nCHOICE OF AGENT.\r\n\r\nThe choice of the above-described agents depends on the conditions.\r\nEvidently a barn is not to be disinfected in the same way that a\r\ntest-tube in the laboratory is sterilized. Among the factors to be\r\nconsidered in making a choice are the thing to be disinfected or\r\nsterilized, its size and nature, that is, whether it will be injured by\r\nthe process proposed, cost of the agent, especially when a large amount\r\nof material is to be treated. Among the conditions which affect the\r\naction of all agents the following should be borne in mind particularly\r\nwhen testing the disinfecting power of chemical agents:\r\n\r\n1. _The kind of bacterium_ to be destroyed, since some are more readily\r\nkilled by a given disinfectant than others, even though no spores are\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n2. _The age of the culture._ Young bacteria less than twenty-four hours\r\nold are usually more readily killed than older ones since the cell wall\r\nis more delicate and more easily penetrated, though old growths may\r\nbe weakened by the accumulation of their products and be more easily\r\ndestroyed.\r\n\r\n3. _Presence of spores_, since they are much more resistant than the\r\ngrowing cells.\r\n\r\n4. Whether the organism is a _“good” or “bad” growth_, _i.e._, whether\r\nit has grown in a favorable environment and hence is vigorous, or under\r\nunfavorable conditions and hence is weak.\r\n\r\n5. _The number of bacteria present_, since with chemical agents the\r\naction is one of relative masses.\r\n\r\n6. _Nature of the substance in which the bacteria are._ Metallic salts,\r\nespecially bichloride of mercury, are precipitated by albuminous\r\nsubstances and if employed at all must be used in several times the\r\nordinary strength. Solids require relatively more of a given solution\r\nthan liquids.\r\n\r\n7. _State of the disinfectant_, whether solid, liquid or gas, and\r\nwhether it is ionized or not. Solutions penetrate best and are\r\ntherefore more quickly active and more efficient.\r\n\r\n8. _The solvent._ Water is the best solvent to use. Strong alcohol (90\r\nper cent. +) diminishes the effect of carbolic acid, formaldehyde and\r\nbichloride of mercury. Oil has a similar effect. The action is probably\r\nto prevent the penetration of the disinfectant.\r\n\r\n9. _Strength of solution._ The stronger the solution, the more rapid\r\nand more certain the action, for the same reason as mentioned under 5.\r\nIn fact, every disinfectant has a strength below the lethal at which it\r\nstimulates bacterial growth.\r\n\r\n10. _Addition of salts._ Common salt favors the action of bichloride\r\nof mercury and also of carbolic acid. Other salts may hinder by\r\nprecipitating the disinfectant.\r\n\r\n11. _Temperature._ Chemical disinfectants, as a rule, follow the\r\ngeneral law that chemical action increases with the temperature, up to\r\nthe point where the heat of itself is sufficient to kill.\r\n\r\n12. _Time of action._ It is scarcely necessary to point out that a\r\ncertain length of time is necessary for any disinfectant to act. One\r\nmay touch a red hot stove and not be burned. All the above-mentioned\r\nconditions are influenced by the time of action.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTANDARDIZATION OF DISINFECTANTS--“PHENOL COEFFICIENT.”\r\n\r\nMany attempts have been made to devise standard methods for testing\r\nthe relative strengths of disinfectants. The one most widely used in\r\nthe United States is the so-called “Hygienic Laboratory” method of\r\ndetermining the “phenol coefficient” of the given substance and is a\r\nmodification of the method originally proposed by Rideal and Walker\r\nin England. In this method as proposed by Anderson and McClintic,\r\nformerly of the above laboratory, the strengths of the dilution of the\r\ndisinfectant to be tested which kills a culture of _Bacterium typhosum_\r\nin 2-1/2 minutes is divided by the strength of the dilution of carbolic\r\nacid which does the same; and the dilution which kills in 15 minutes is\r\nlikewise divided by the corresponding dilution of carbolic acid. The\r\ntwo ratios thus obtained are averaged and the result is the “phenol\r\ncoefficient.” For example\r\n\r\n        Phenol      1:80 killed in 2-1/2 minutes\r\n  Disinfectant “A”  1:375  „    „    „      „\r\n        Phenol      1:110  „    „   15      „\r\n  Disinfectant “A”  1:650  „    „    „      „\r\n                   375 ÷ 80  = 4.69\r\n                   650 ÷ 110 = 5.91\r\n                              -----\r\n                            2)10.60\r\n                              -----\r\n                   Average = 5.30 = “phenol coefficient.”\r\n\r\nStandard conditions of temperature, age of culture, medium, reaction,\r\netc., and of making the dilutions and transfers are insisted on.\r\nDetails may be found in the Journal of Infectious Diseases, 1911, 8, p.\r\n1.\r\n\r\nThis is probably as good a method as any for arriving at the relative\r\nstrengths of disinfectants and in the hands of any given worker\r\nconcordant results in comparative tests can usually be attained.\r\nExperience has shown that the results obtained by different workers\r\nwith the same disinfectant may be decidedly at variance. This is to\r\nbe expected from a knowledge of the factors affecting the action of\r\ndisinfectants above stated and from the known specific action of\r\ncertain disinfectants on certain organisms (compare anilin dyes, p.\r\n162).\r\n\r\nIt seems that the only sure way to test the action of such a substance\r\nis to try it out in the way it is to be used. It is scarcely wise to\r\nadopt the “phenol coefficient” method as a legal standard method as\r\nsome states have done.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRACTICAL STERILIZATION AND DISINFECTION.\r\n\r\nThe methods for sterilizing in the laboratory have been discussed and\r\nwill be referred to again in the next chapter.\r\n\r\nIn practical disinfection it is a good plan always to _proceed as\r\nthough spores were present_ even if the organism is known. Hence use an\r\n_abundance of the agent_ and _apply it as long as practicable_. Also\r\nit is best to secure the _chemical substances used as such_ and _not\r\ndepend on patented mixtures purporting to contain them_. As a rule the\r\nlatter are _more expensive_ in _proportion to the results secured_.\r\n\r\n_Surgical instruments_ may be sterilized by boiling in water for\r\nfifteen minutes, provided they are clean, as they should be. If dried\r\nblood, pus, mucus, etc., are adherent, which should never be the case,\r\nthey should be boiled one-half hour. The addition of sodium carbonate\r\n(0.5 to 1 per cent.) prevents rusting. Surgeons’ sterilizers are to\r\nbe had at reasonable prices and are very convenient. Whether the\r\ninstruments are boiled or subjected to streaming steam depends on\r\nwhether the supporting tray is covered with water or not. The author\r\nfinds it a good plan to keep the needles of hypodermic syringes in a\r\nsmall wire basket in an _oil bath_. The oil may be heated to 150° to\r\n200° and the needles sterilized in a very few minutes. The oil also\r\nprevents rusting.\r\n\r\n_Rooms_, _offices_ and all spaces which may be readily made practically\r\ngas-tight are best disinfected by means of formaldehyde by any of the\r\nmethods above described (Figs. 111 and 112).\r\n\r\n_Stables_ and _Barnyards_ (Mohler): “A preliminary cleaning up of all\r\nlitter is advisable together with the scraping of the floor, mangers\r\nand walls of the stable with hoes and the removal of all dust and\r\nfilth. All this material should be burned since it probably contains\r\nthe infective agent. Heat may be applied to the surfaces, including\r\nbarnyard, by means of a ‘cyclone oil burner.’ When such burning is\r\nimpracticable, the walls may be disinfected with one of the following:\r\n\r\n  1. Whitewash 1 gallon + chloride of lime 6 ounces.\r\n\r\n  2. Whitewash 1 gallon + crude carbolic acid 7 ounces.\r\n\r\n  3. Whitewash 1 gallon + formalin 4 ounces.\r\n\r\nThe same may be applied with brushes or, more rapidly, sprayed on with\r\na pump; the surface soil of the yard and surroundings should be removed\r\nto a depth of 5 or 6 inches, placed in a heap and thoroughly mixed\r\nwith quicklime. The fresh surface of soil thus exposed may be sprinkled\r\nwith a solution of a chemical disinfectant as above described.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 111.--Formaldehyde generator used in city work for\r\nroom disinfection.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 112.--Government formaldehyde generator.]\r\n\r\n“Portions of walls and ceiling not readily accessible may be\r\ndisinfected by chlorine gas liberated from chloride of lime by crude\r\ncarbolic acid. This is accomplished by making a cone of 5 or 6 pounds\r\nof chloride of lime in the top of which a deep crater is made for the\r\nplacement of from 1 to 2 pints of crude carbolic acid. The edge of\r\nthe crater is thereupon pushed into the fluid, when a lively reaction\r\nfollows. Owing to the heat generated, it is advisable to place the\r\nchloride of lime in an iron crucible (pot), and to have nothing\r\ninflammable within a radius of two feet. The number and location of\r\nthese cones of chloride of lime depend on the size and structure\r\nof the building to be disinfected. As a rule it may be stated that\r\nchlorine gas liberated from the above sized cone will be sufficient for\r\ndisinfecting 5200 cubic feet of air space.”\r\n\r\n_Liquid manure_, _leachings_, etc., where collected are thoroughly\r\ndisinfected by chloride of lime applied in the proportion of 2 parts to\r\n1000 of fluid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 113.--Chamber used in government work for\r\nformaldehyde disinfection. The small cylinder at the side is the\r\ngenerator.]\r\n\r\n_Vehicles_ may be thoroughly washed with 2 per cent. formalin solution,\r\nor if closed space is available, subjected to formaldehyde gas\r\ndisinfection, after cushions, hangings, etc., have been removed and\r\nwashed with the disinfectant.\r\n\r\n_Harness_, _brushes_, _combs_ should be washed with a solution of\r\nformalin, carbolic acid, or creolin as given under these topics.\r\n\r\n_Washable articles_ should be boiled, dropped into disinfectant,\r\nsolutions as soon as soiled, and then boiled or steamed.\r\n\r\n_Unwashable articles_--burn all possible. Use formaldehyde gas method\r\nin a closed receptacle (Fig. 113).\r\n\r\n_Stock cars_--the method described for stables is applicable here.\r\n\r\n_Animals, large and small_, may have the coat and surface of the body\r\ndisinfected by washing with 1 to 1000 bichloride or strong hot soapsuds\r\nto which carbolic acid has been added to make a 5 per cent. solution;\r\nthey should then be given a good warm bath.\r\n\r\nFrequently time and money are saved by a combination of steam and\r\nformaldehyde disinfection. This is a regular practice in municipal and\r\nquarantine disinfection (Fig. 114).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 114.--Chamber in actual use at government\r\nquarantine station for disinfecting baggage and dunnage with steam\r\nor formaldehyde or both. The small cylinder at the side is the steam\r\nformaldehyde generator.]\r\n\r\nPersons engaged in disinfection work should wear rubber boots, coats\r\nand caps which should be washed in a disinfectant solution and the\r\nchange to ordinary clothing made in a special room so that no infective\r\nmaterial will be taken away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART III.\r\n\r\nTHE STUDY OF BACTERIA.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nCULTURE MEDIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe study of bacteria may be taken up for the disciplinary and\r\npedagogic value of the study of a science; with the idea of extending\r\nthe limits of knowledge; or for the purpose of learning their\r\nbeneficial or injurious actions with the object of taking advantage of\r\nthe former and combating or preventing the latter.\r\n\r\nSince bacteria are classed as plants, their successful study implies\r\ntheir cultivation on a suitable soil. A growth of bacteria is called\r\na “_culture_” and the “soil” or material on which they are grown is\r\ncalled a “_culture medium_.” In so far as the culture medium is made up\r\nin the laboratory it is an “artificial culture medium” as distinguished\r\nfrom a natural medium. A culture consisting of one kind of bacteria\r\nonly is spoken of as a “pure culture,” and accurate knowledge of\r\nbacteria depends on obtaining them in “pure culture.” After getting\r\na “pure culture” the special characteristics of the organism must be\r\nascertained in order to distinguish it from others. The discussion of\r\nthe _morphology_ of bacteria in Chapters II, III, and IV shows that\r\nthe morphological structures are too few to separate individual kinds.\r\nThey serve at best to enable groups of similarly appearing forms to be\r\narranged. Hence any further differentiation must be based on a study\r\nof the _physiology_ of the organism as discussed in the chapters on\r\nPhysiological Activities of Bacteria.\r\n\r\nThe thorough study of a bacterium involves, therefore:\r\n\r\n1. Its isolation in pure culture.\r\n\r\n2. Its study with the microscope to determine morphological features\r\nand staining reactions.\r\n\r\n3. Growth on culture media for determining its physiological activities\r\nas well as morphological characteristics of the growths themselves.\r\n\r\n4. Animal inoculations in certain instances.\r\n\r\n5. Special serum reactions in some cases.\r\n\r\nSince isolation in pure culture requires material for growing the\r\norganism, the first subject to be considered is culture media.\r\n\r\nA culture medium for a given bacterium should show the following\r\nessentials:\r\n\r\n1. It must contain all the elements necessary for the growth of the\r\norganism except those that may be obtained from the surrounding\r\natmosphere.\r\n\r\n2. These elements must be in a form available to the organism.\r\n\r\n3. The medium must not be too dry, in order to furnish sufficient\r\nmoisture for growth and to prevent too great a concentration of the\r\ndifferent ingredients.\r\n\r\n4. The reaction must be adjusted to suit the particular organism dealt\r\nwith.\r\n\r\n5. There must be no injurious substances present in concentration\r\nsufficient to inhibit the growth of the organism or to kill it.\r\n\r\nOrdinarily, more attention must be paid to the sources of the two\r\nelements N and C than to the others, for in general the substances\r\nused to furnish these two and the water contain the other elements in\r\nsufficient amount. For very exact work on the products of bacteria,\r\n_synthetic media_ containing definite amounts of chemicals of known\r\ncomposition have been prepared, but for most of the work with bacteria\r\npathogenic to animals such media are not needed.\r\n\r\nCulture media may be either _liquid_ or _solid_, or for certain\r\npurposes may be liquid at higher temperatures and solid at lower, as\r\nindicated later. Liquid media are of value for obtaining bacteria for\r\nthe study of morphology and cell groupings and for ascertaining many of\r\nthe physiological activities of the organisms. Solid media are useful\r\nfor studying some few of the physiological activities and especially\r\nfor determining characteristic appearances of the isolated growths\r\nof bacteria. These isolated growths of bacteria on solid media are\r\ntechnically spoken of as “_colonies_,” whether they are microscopic in\r\nsize or visible to the unaided eye.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the kinds of culture media used for the study of\r\nbacteria may be unlimited but the undergraduate student will need to\r\nuse a relatively small number, which will be discussed in this section.\r\n\r\n=Meat Broth (Bouillon).=[20]--This itself is used as a medium and as\r\nthe basis for the preparation of other solid and liquid media.\r\n\r\nFinely ground _lean_ beef is selected because it contains the necessary\r\nfood materials. Fat is not desired since it is a poor food for most\r\nbacteria and in the further processes of preparation would be melted\r\nand form an undesirable film on the surface of the medium. The meat is\r\nplaced in a suitable container and mixed with about twice its weight of\r\n_cold_ water (not distilled) and allowed to soak overnight or longer.\r\nThe cold water extracts from the meat water-soluble proteins, blood,\r\ncarbohydrates in the form of dextrose (occasionally some glycogen),\r\nnitrogenous extractives and some of the mineral salts. The fluid is\r\nstrained or pressed free from the meat. This “meat juice” should now\r\nbe thoroughly boiled, which results in a coagulation of a large part\r\nof the proteins and a precipitation of some of the mineral salts,\r\nparticularly phosphates of calcium and magnesium, both of which must be\r\nfiltered off and the water loss restored by adding the proper amount of\r\ndistilled water. The boiling is done at this point because the medium\r\nmust later be heated to sterilize it and it is best to get rid of the\r\ncoagulable proteins at once. The proteins thus thrown out deprive\r\nthe medium of valuable nitrogenous food material which is replaced\r\nby adding about 1 per cent. by weight of commercial peptone. It is\r\nusual also (though not always necessary) to add about 0.5 per cent. by\r\nweight of common salt which helps to restore the proper concentration\r\nof mineral ingredients lost by the boiling. The chlorine is also an\r\nessential element. The reaction is now determined and adjusted to the\r\ndesired end point, “standardized,” as it is called. The medium is\r\nagain _thoroughly_ boiled and filtered boiling hot. The adjusting of\r\nthe reaction and the boiling ordinarily cause a precipitate to form\r\nwhich is largely phosphates of the alkaline earths with some protein.\r\nThe filtered medium is collected in suitable containers, flasks or\r\ntubes, which are plugged with well-fitting non-absorbent cotton plugs\r\nand sterilized, best in the autoclave for twenty minutes at 15 pounds\r\npressure, or discontinuously in streaming steam at 100°. If careful\r\nattention is paid to _titration_ and to _sufficient boiling_ where\r\nindicated, the meat broth prepared as above should be clear, only\r\nfaintly yellowish in color and show no precipitate on cooling.\r\n\r\nThe conventional method for standardizing an acid medium is as follows:\r\nTake 5 cc of the medium, add 45 cc of distilled water and 1 cc of\r\n_phenolphthalein_ as indicator. Boil the solution and while still hot\r\nrun in from a burette N/20 NaOH solution until a faint pink color\r\nappears. From the number of cc of N/20 NaOH used to “neutralize” the\r\n5 cc of medium it is calculated how many cc of N/1 NaOH are necessary\r\nto give the desired end reaction to the volume of medium which is to\r\nbe standardized. The resulting reaction is expressed as % _acid or\r\nalkaline to phenolphthalein_. If it is necessary to add to each 100 cc\r\nof the medium 1 cc of N/1 NaOH to make it neutral to phenolphthalein,\r\nthe reaction is called 1% acid: if to each 100 cc of medium there is\r\nadded 1 cc of N/1 alkali in addition to the quantity necessary to\r\nneutralize, the reaction is called 1% alkaline.\r\n\r\nIn order to obtain a pink color when titrating with this indicator\r\nnot only must the “free acid” be neutralized by the alkali but also\r\nloosely combined acid and any other substances present which will\r\ncombine with the alkali rather than with the indicator so that in many\r\nmedia _more alkali_ is added than is necessary to neutralize the “free\r\nacid,” _i.e._, the free H ions present.\r\n\r\nIt is well established that the controlling factor in the growth of\r\nbacteria in so far as “reaction” is concerned is not the _titratable\r\nsubstances_ present but only the “free acid,” _i.e._, the _number of\r\nfree H ions_, consequently it is better to determine the concentration\r\nof H ions and to _standardize to a definite H ion concentration_.\r\nPhenolphthalein as shown above is not a good indicator for this purpose.\r\n\r\nThe H ions present can be determined accurately in all cases only by\r\nelectrolytic methods. The apparatus necessary is usually relatively\r\nexpensive and scarcely adapted to the use of large classes of students.\r\nThere are a number of indicators each of which will show color changes\r\nwithin rather narrow ranges of H ion concentration. Standardization by\r\nthe use of these indicators, the “colorimetric method,” is recommended\r\nby the Society of American Bacteriologists and is coming into general\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nThe H ion concentration is ordinarily _indicated_ by the conventional\r\nsymbol P{H}, _e.g._, the concentration in pure water which is regarded\r\nas neutral is expressed as P{H} 7; of normal HCl, P{H} 0; of normal\r\nNaOH, P{H} 14. The figure after P{H} does not in reality represent the\r\nconcentration of H ions in the solution. This, like the concentration\r\nof acids, is expressed on the basis of normality, _i.e._, as compared\r\nwith the concentration of a normal solution (1 g. equivalent) of H\r\nions. Concentration of H ions in pure water is N/10,000,000, _i.e._,\r\nis 1/10,000,000 of the concentration in a normal solution of H ions.\r\nExpressed in other words, it is the concentration in a normal solution\r\nof H ions diluted ten million times. 10,000,000 = 10 to the 7th power\r\n= 10⁷. Hence the figure after the P{H} indicates the _logarithm of\r\nthe number of times the solution is diluted_. Therefore this number\r\n_increases with the dilution_, and the larger the figure after the\r\nP{H}, the _less acid the solution is_.\r\n\r\nMost saprophytic organisms and many parasitic ones grow within a wide\r\nrange of H ion concentration so that titration with phenolphthalein\r\ngives sufficient accuracy for media for such organisms. On the\r\nother hand, many organisms grow within a very narrow range of H ion\r\nconcentration, hence accurate standardization to a definite H ion\r\nconcentration is necessary. It is also evident that for comparative\r\nwork, such standardization is essential because this reaction can be\r\nreproduced in other media and by other workers.[21]\r\n\r\nBroth may be prepared from Liebig’s or Armour’s meat extract by adding\r\n5 grams of either, 10 grams peptone and 5 grams NaCl to 1000 cc of\r\nwater, boiling to dissolve, then titrating and filtering as above.\r\n\r\nThe author after much experience finds _meat juice_ preferable to meat\r\nextract for broth and other media for pathogenic bacteria, and has\r\nabandoned the use of meat extracts for these organisms.\r\n\r\n=Glycerin Broth.=--Glycerin broth is made by adding 4 to 6 per cent. of\r\nglycerin to the broth just previous to the sterilization. The glycerin\r\nserves as a source of carbon to certain bacteria which will not grow on\r\nthe ordinary broth--as _Mycobacterium tuberculosis_.\r\n\r\n=Sugar Broths.=--Sugar broths are used for determining the action of\r\nbacteria on these carbohydrates, since this is a valuable means of\r\ndifferentiating certain forms, especially those from the intestinal\r\ntract. Broth _free from sugar_ must first be made. This is done by\r\nadding to broth prepared as already described, _just previous to final\r\nfiltering and sterilization_, a culture of some sugar-destroying\r\norganism (_Bacterium coli_ is ordinarily used), and then allowing the\r\norganism to grow in the raw broth at body temperature for twenty-four\r\nhours. Any carbohydrate in the broth is destroyed by the _Bacterium\r\ncoli_. This mixture is then boiled to kill the _Bacterium coli_,\r\nrestandardized and then 1 per cent. by weight of required sugar is\r\nadded. Dextrose, saccharose and lactose are the most used, though\r\nmany others are used for special purposes. After the sugar is added\r\nthe medium must be sterilized by _discontinuous heating_ at 100° for\r\nthree or four successive days, because long boiling or heating in the\r\nautoclave splits up the di- and polysaccharids into simpler sugars and\r\nmay even convert the simple sugars (dextrose) into acid.\r\n\r\nVarious other _modified broths_ are frequently used for special\r\npurposes but need not be discussed here.\r\n\r\n=Dunham’s peptone solution=, frequently used to determine indol\r\nproduction, is a solution of 1 per cent. of peptone and 0.5 per cent.\r\nof salt in tap water. It does not need to be titrated, but should be\r\nboiled and filtered into tubes or flasks and sterilized.\r\n\r\n=Nitrate Broth.=--Nitrate broth for determining nitrate reduction\r\nis 1 per cent. of peptone, 0.2 per cent. of C. P. potassium nitrate\r\ndissolved in distilled water and sterilized.\r\n\r\n=Milk.=--Milk is a natural culture medium much used. It should be\r\nfresh and thoroughly skimmed, best by a separator or centrifuge to\r\nget rid of the _fat_. If the milk is not fresh, it should be titrated\r\nas for broth and the reaction adjusted. The milk should be sterilized\r\ndiscontinuously to avoid splitting up the lactose as well as action on\r\nthe casein and calcium phosphate.\r\n\r\n_Litmus Milk._--Litmus milk is milk as above to which litmus has been\r\nadded as an acid production indicator. The milk should show blue when\r\nthe litmus is added or be made to by the addition of normal NaOH\r\nsolution. It should be sterilized discontinuously. Frequently on\r\nheating litmus milk the blue color disappears due to a reduction of\r\nthe litmus. This blue color will reappear on shaking with air or on\r\nstanding several days, due to absorption of O and oxidation of the\r\nreduced litmus, provided the heating has produced no other change in\r\nthe milk, as proper heating will not.\r\n\r\n=Gelatin Culture Medium.=--Gelatin to the extent of 10 to 15 per\r\ncent. is frequently added to broth and gives a culture medium of\r\nmany advantages. It is solid at temperatures up to about 25° and\r\nfluid above this temperature, a property which is of great advantage\r\nin the isolation of bacteria. (See Chapter XVIII.) Further gelatin\r\nis liquefied (that is digested, converted into gelatin proteose and\r\ngelatin peptone, which are soluble in water and do not gelatinize)\r\nby many bacteria and not by others, a valuable diagnostic feature.\r\nThe gelatin colonies of many bacteria are very characteristic in\r\nappearance, as is the growth of many on gelatin in culture tubes.\r\n\r\nGelatin medium may be prepared by adding the proper amount of gelatin\r\n(10 to 15 per cent. by weight) broken into small pieces (powdered\r\ngelatin in the same proportion may be used) to broth, gently warming\r\nuntil the gelatin is dissolved, standardizing as for broth, filtering\r\nand sterilizing. It is usually cleared before filtering by stirring\r\ninto the gelatin solution, cooled to below 60°, the white of an egg\r\nfor each 1000 cc., and then thoroughly boiling before filtering. The\r\ncoagulation of the egg albumen entangles the suspended matter so that\r\nthe gelatin filters perfectly clear, though with a slight yellowish\r\ncolor. The filtering may be done through filter paper if the gelatin\r\nis well boiled and filtered boiling hot, but is more conveniently done\r\nthrough absorbent cotton, wet with boiling water.\r\n\r\nOr, the gelatin may be added to _meat juice before it is boiled_, then\r\nthis is heated to about body temperature (not too hot, or the proteins\r\nwill be coagulated too soon) until the gelatin is dissolved. Then\r\nthe material is standardized and thoroughly boiled and filtered. The\r\nproteins of the meat juice coagulate and thus clear the medium without\r\nthe addition of egg white. Commercial gelatin is markedly acid from the\r\nmethod of manufacture, hence the medium requires careful titration,\r\neven when made from a standardized broth.\r\n\r\nGelatin should be sterilized by discontinuous heating at 100° on three\r\nsuccessive days, because long boiling or heating above 100° tends to\r\nhydrolyze the gelatin into gelatin proteose and peptone and it will\r\nnot gelatinize on cooling. It may be heated in the autoclave for\r\nten to fifteen minutes at 10 pounds’ pressure and sometimes not be\r\nhydrolyzed, but the procedure is uncertain and very resistant spores\r\nmay not be killed. The medium should be put into the culture tubes in\r\nwhich it is to be used as soon as filtered, and sterilized in these,\r\nsince, if put into flasks these must be sterilized, and then when\r\ntransferred to tubes for use, it must be again sterilized unless great\r\ncare is taken to have the tubes plugged and sterilized first, and in\r\ntransferring aseptically to these tubes. These repeated heatings are\r\nvery apt to decompose the gelatin, so it will not “set” on cooling. The\r\nprepared and sterilized tubes of gelatin should be kept in an ice-box\r\nor cool room, as they will melt in overheated laboratories in summer or\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\n=Agar Medium.=--Agar agar, usually called agar, is a complex\r\ncarbohydrate substance of unknown composition obtained from certain\r\nseaweeds along the coast of Japan and Southeastern Asia. It occurs\r\nin commerce as thin translucent strips or as a powder. It resembles\r\ngelatin only in the property its solutions have of gelatinizing when\r\ncooled. Gelatin is an albuminoid closely related to the proteins,\r\nagar a carbohydrate. Agar is much less soluble in water, 1 or 1.5\r\nper cent. of agar giving a jelly as dense as 10 to 15 per cent. of\r\ngelatin. It dissolves only in water heated to near the boiling-point\r\n(98° to 99°) and only after much longer heating. This hot solution\r\n“jells,” “sets” or gelatinizes at about 38° and remains solid until\r\nagain heated to near boiling. Hence bacteria may be grown on agar at\r\nthe body temperature (37°) and above, and the agar will remain solid,\r\nwhile gelatin media are fluid above about 25°. No pathogenic bacteria\r\nand none of the saprophytes liable to be met with in the laboratory are\r\nable to “liquefy” agar.\r\n\r\nAn agar medium is conveniently prepared from broth by adding 1 or\r\n1.5 per cent. of the finely divided agar to the broth and boiling\r\nuntil dissolved, standardizing, clearing, filtering, and sterilizing.\r\nThe agar must be thoroughly boiled, usually for ten to fifteen\r\nminutes, and the water loss made up by the addition of distilled\r\nwater before titration. Agar is practically neutral so that there is\r\nlittle difference between the titration of the dissolved agar and\r\nthe original broth. The agar solution should be kept hot from the\r\nbeginning to the end except the cooling down to below 60°, when the\r\negg white for clearing is added. Though filtration through paper is\r\npossible as with gelatin, if the agar solution is thoroughly boiled\r\nand filtered boiling hot, it is more satisfactory for beginners to\r\nuse absorbent cotton wet with boiling water and to pour the hot agar\r\nthrough the same filter if not clear the first time. The solidified\r\nagar medium is never perfectly clear, but always more or less\r\nopalescent. The agar medium may be sterilized in the autoclave for\r\nfifteen minutes at 15 pounds pressure as the high temperature does not\r\ninjure the agar.\r\n\r\n=Potato Media.=--Potatoes furnish a natural culture medium which is\r\nvery useful for the study of many bacteria. The simplest, and for most\r\npurposes the best, way to use potatoes is in culture tubes as “potato\r\ntube cultures” (No. 8, Fig. 119). These are prepared as follows:\r\nLarge tubes are used. Large healthy potatoes are selected. Each end\r\nof the potato is sliced off so as to have parallel surfaces. With a\r\ncork-borer of a size to fit the tubes used, cylinders about one and\r\none-half inches long are made. Each cylinder is cut diagonally from\r\nbase to base. This furnishes two pieces each with a circular base and\r\nan oval, sloping surface. The pieces are then washed clean and dropped\r\nfor a minute into boiling water to destroy the oxidizing enzyme on the\r\nsurface which would otherwise cause a darkening of the potato. (The\r\ndarkening may also be prevented by keeping the freshly cut potatoes\r\ncovered with clean water until ready to sterilize.) A bit of cotton\r\none-fourth to one-half inch in depth is put into each of the test-tubes\r\nto retain moisture and a piece of potato dropped in, circular base\r\ndown. The tubes are then plugged with cotton and sterilized in the\r\nautoclave at 15 pounds pressure for not less than twenty-five minutes,\r\nsince potatoes usually harbor very resistant spores, and it is not\r\nunusual for a few tubes to spoil even after this thorough heating.\r\n\r\nPotatoes are sometimes used in “potato plate cultures.” The term “plate\r\nculture” is a relic of the time when flat glass plates were used for\r\nthis and other “plate cultures.” Now glass dishes of the general\r\nform shown in Fig. 115, called “Petri dishes,” or plates are used for\r\npractically all plate culture work. For “potato plates” slices from\r\npotatoes are cut as large and as thick as the relative sizes of potato\r\nand dish permit (Fig. 116). The slices should be thin enough not to\r\ntouch the lid and thick enough to be firm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 115.--Petri dish with the lid partly raised. × 1/2]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 116.--A potato plate. × 1/2]\r\n\r\nIt is a good plan to wrap each dish separately in paper to retain the\r\nlid securely, then sterilize as for potato tubes, and leave plates\r\nwrapped until wanted.\r\n\r\nIt sometimes happens that the natural acidity of potatoes is too great\r\nfor the growth of many organisms. The acidity is sufficiently corrected\r\nby soaking the pieces of potato in a 1 per cent. solution of sodium\r\ncarbonate for an hour before they are put into the tubes or plates.\r\n\r\n_Glycerinized potato tubes_ are conveniently prepared by covering the\r\npotato in the tube with glycerin broth, sterilizing and pouring off the\r\nexcess broth immediately after sterilizing, taking care that the tubes\r\ndo not become contaminated which is not very probable if the work is\r\nquickly done while the tubes are still hot.\r\n\r\n=Blood Serum Media.=--Blood serum, usually from the larger, domestic\r\nanimals on account of convenience in securing it in quantity, is used\r\nin the study of the bacteria causing disease in man and animals. Most\r\ncommonly the serum is collected from the clotted blood after it has\r\nwell separated (usually about forty-eight hours is required for this).\r\nIt is then run into tubes which are plugged with cotton and placed in\r\nan apparatus for coagulating the serum by heat. A copper water bath\r\nwith a tightly closed air compartment or the horizontal autoclave (Fig.\r\n81) is sufficient for this purpose, though special forms of apparatus\r\nare to be had. It is important that the temperature be raised slowly so\r\nthat the blood gases escape gradually. Three to five hours or longer\r\nshould be allowed for the temperature to reach the boiling-point. If\r\nthe tubes are heated too rapidly, the serum is filled with bubbles and\r\nbadly torn since the gases are driven off suddenly. _Löffler’s serum_\r\nis made by adding one part of dextrose broth to three parts of serum\r\nand then coagulating as above. The solidified serum in either case is\r\nbest sterilized discontinuously, though with care the autoclave at 15\r\npounds pressure may be used for a single sterilization. This is very\r\napt to cause a greater darkening of the serum and frequently also a\r\nlaceration of the solid mass by escaping gases.\r\n\r\nBlood serum is also used in the liquid state. For this purpose it is\r\nbest to collect it aseptically; or it may be sterilized discontinuously\r\nat a temperature of 55° or 56° on seven to ten consecutive days. Novy\r\nhas recently suggested dialyzing the serum to free it from salts and\r\nthus prevent its coagulation when heated. Whether the removal of the\r\nvarious “extractives” which diffuse out with the salts deprives the\r\nserum of any of its advantageous properties remains to be ascertained.\r\n\r\nFrom the discussion of the physiological activities of bacteria in\r\nChapters IX-XII it is apparent that a very great variety of culture\r\nmedia other than those described is necessary for the study of special\r\ntypes of bacteria, but such media are beyond the scope of the present\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe ideal culture media are without a doubt the _synthetic media_, that\r\nis media of definite known chemical composition, so that the various\r\nchanges due to the growth of bacteria can be accurately determined\r\nand thus a means of sharply differentiating closely related organisms\r\nbe secured. Such media have been prepared and every bacteriologist\r\nbelieves strongly in their future usefulness when media of wider\r\napplication shall have been devised. An example of this type of culture\r\nmedia is Uschinsky’s synthetic medium, of which the following is one of\r\nthe modifications:\r\n\r\n  Distilled-water              1000 parts\r\n  Asparagin                       4  „\r\n  Ammonium lactate                6  „\r\n  Disodium phosphate              2  „\r\n  Sodium chloride                 5  „\r\n\r\nA criticism of this medium is that the elements K, Ca, Mg, Fe, Mn, and\r\nS which have been shown to be essential are not present if chemically\r\npure salts are used in the preparation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF USING CULTURE MEDIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe way in which culture media shall be used depends on the purpose\r\nin view. By far the larger part of bacteriological work is done with\r\ncultures in “bacteriological culture tubes.” Various laboratories have\r\ntheir own special types but all are more or less after the “Board of\r\nHealth” form. They differ from ordinary chemical test-tubes in that\r\nthey are usually longer, have no “lip” and have much thicker walls to\r\nprevent breakage and consequent loss of the culture as well as danger\r\nfrom pathogenic organisms. The author finds two sets of tubes most\r\nserviceable for student use--one size 15 cm. long by 19 mm. outside\r\ndiameter (No. 9, Fig. 119), the other 15 cm. long by 13 mm. (Nos. 1 to\r\n7, Fig. 119). Culture tubes are conveniently used in “wire baskets”\r\ncircular or square in section and of a size to correspond with the\r\nlength and number of tubes used. These baskets are light, do not break,\r\nand if made of good galvanized wire netting do not readily rust (Figs.\r\n117 and 118).\r\n\r\nLiquid media such as broth, milk, litmus milk, indol and nitrate broths\r\nare used in the above-mentioned tubes when small quantities only are\r\nto be worked with. The tubes are filled approximately one-third full,\r\nthen plugged with _non-absorbent_ cotton and sterilized. _Cotton plugs_\r\nare used so much in bacteriological work because they permit a free\r\ncirculation of air and gases and at the same time act as filters to\r\nkeep out the bacteria of the air.\r\n\r\nSugar broths or other media in which gas may be produced are used in\r\nfermentation tubes (Smith tubes) of the type shown in Fig. 120 so that\r\nthe gas may be collected in the closed arm of the tube, measured (Fig.\r\n121) and tested if desired.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 117.--Round wire basket.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 118.--Square wire basket.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 119.--Culture tubes with media in them. × 2/3. _1_\r\nto _7_ are the smaller tubes mentioned in the text; _9_ the larger\r\ntube; _8_ is extra large for potato tubes; _1_, plain broth; _2_, plain\r\nmilk; _3_, litmus milk; _4_, gelatin for “stab” or “puncture” culture;\r\n_5_, agar for “stab” or “puncture” culture; _6_, agar for “slope” or\r\n“slant” culture; _7_, blood serum; _8_, potato tube; _9_, agar for\r\nplating. Note the transparency of the broth and gelatin and the slight\r\nopalescence of the agar.]\r\n\r\nOne method of using gelatin and also agar is as “puncture” or “stab”\r\ncultures. The tubes (the narrower tubes are to be preferred for most\r\n“stab” cultures) are filled one-third full of the medium while it is\r\nstill fluid, plugged, sterilized and allowed to cool in the vertical\r\nposition. The medium is then “inoculated” with a _straight_ platinum\r\nneedle by plunging this into the center of the surface down to the\r\nbottom of the tube (Fig. 119, Nos. 4 and 5).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 120.--Fermentation tubes. _1_, filled ready for\r\nuse; _2_, shows a cloudy growth and the development of gas in the\r\nclosed arm.]\r\n\r\nAgar and blood serum are frequently used in the form of “slope” or\r\n“slant” cultures. That is, the medium solidifies with the tubes lying\r\non their sides which gives a long, sloping _surface_ on which the\r\nbacteria are inoculated (Fig. 119, Nos. 6 and 7).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 121.--Method of estimating percentage of gas in a\r\nfermentation tube by means of the “gasometer”, the reading is 45 per\r\ncent.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 122.--A toxin flask showing a large surface\r\ngrowth.]\r\n\r\nPotato tubes are likewise used for “slant” or “slope” cultures (Fig.\r\n119, No. 8). Potatoes as “plate cultures” have been referred to. Agar\r\nand gelatin are very largely used in the form of “plate cultures”\r\nalso. For this purpose Petri dishes are first sterilized, then the\r\nmelted agar or gelatin poured into them and allowed to “set” while the\r\nplates are kept horizontal. The melted media may be “inoculated” before\r\nthey are poured, or a portion of the material to be “plated” may be\r\nplaced in the dish, then the melted medium poured in and distributed\r\nover the dish by tilting in various directions, or the medium after\r\nsolidifying may be inoculated by “strokes” or “streaks” over its\r\nsurface, according to the purpose in view in using the plate. The\r\nlarger sized tubes should be used for making plates in order to have\r\nsufficient medium in the plate (No. 9, Fig. 119).\r\n\r\nFor using large quantities of medium, Florence flasks, Ehrlenmeyer\r\nflasks, special toxin flasks (Fig. 122) or various other devices\r\n(Vaughan and Novy’s “mass cultures,” Figs. 123 and 124) have been\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nFor growing _anaërobic organisms_ it is evident that some method for\r\nremoving and excluding the oxygen of the air must be used. A very great\r\nvariety of appliances have been devised for these purposes. Some are\r\nbased on the principle of the vacuum, exhausting the air with an air\r\npump; some on replacing the air with a stream of hydrogen; others on\r\nabsorbing the oxygen by chemical means, as with an alkaline solution\r\nof pyrogallic acid, or even by growing a vigorous aërobe in the\r\nsame culture or in the same container with the anaërobe, the aërobe\r\nexhausting the oxygen so that the anaërobe then develops, or finally\r\nby excluding the air through the use of deep culture tubes well filled\r\nwith the medium, or in the closed arm of fermentation tubes. For many\r\npurposes a combination of two or more of the above methods gives good\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nIn any event the culture medium should have been _freshly sterilized_\r\njust before use, or _should be boiled_ in order to drive out the\r\ndissolved oxygen. For most, anaërobes the presence in the medium of\r\nabout 1 per cent. of a carbohydrate, as dextrose, is advisable.\r\n\r\nA description of all the various devices is unnecessary in this work,\r\nbut the following have answered most of the purposes of general work in\r\nthe author’s laboratories.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 123.--Tank with raised lids. (Vaughan.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 124.--Tank with lids lowered. (Vaughan.)\r\n\r\nFIGS. 123 and 124.--Vaughan and Novy’s mass culture apparatus.]\r\n\r\n_A._ “_Vignal tubes_” of the style shown (Fig. 125) are made from\r\nglass tubes of about 6 to 8 mm. outside diameter, sealed at the small\r\nend, plugged with cotton above the constriction and sterilized. The\r\nmedium, agar or gelatin, which has been previously inoculated with the\r\nanaërobic culture, is then drawn up into the tube, after breaking off\r\nthe tip, as far as the constriction. The tube is then sealed in the\r\nflame at the small end and also at the constriction. Since it is full\r\nof the medium and sealed, access of air is prevented. This forms an\r\nexcellent means for “isolation” (Chapter XVIII); the tube needs merely\r\nto be cut with a file at the point where colonies appear, then these\r\nmay be readily transferred.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 125.--Vignal tubes. × 1/3 _1_, the sterile tube\r\nready for inoculation; _2_, fourth dilution tube showing a few isolated\r\ncolonies, one near the figure; _3_, third dilution showing colonies\r\nisolated but numerous; _4_, second dilution tube showing colonies still\r\nmore numerous; _5_, first dilution tube showing colonies so numerous\r\nand small as to give a cloudy appearance to the tube. In use tube _2_\r\nwould be filed in two at the colony and inoculations made from it.]\r\n\r\n_B._ “_Fermentation tubes_” form a simple means for growing liquid\r\ncultures of anaërobes, the growth occurring in the closed arm only,\r\nwhile with facultative anaërobes, growth occurs both in the closed arm\r\nand in the open bulb. A little “paraffin oil” (a clear, heavy petroleum\r\nderivative) may be poured on the fluid in the open bulb as a very\r\nefficient seal, though it is not usually necessary.\r\n\r\n_C._ “_Deep culture tubes._”--The medium, agar, gelatin or a liquid is\r\npoured into tubes until they are approximately one-half full, a little\r\nparaffin oil is poured on the surface (not essential always), then the\r\ntubes are plugged and sterilized. Inoculation is made to the bottom\r\nand anaërobes grow well (Fig. 126).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 126.--Deep tubes showing anaërobic growth. _1_,\r\nshows a few small gas bubbles; _2_, shows the medium broken up by the\r\nexcessive development of gas.]\r\n\r\n_D._ For slope or plate, or any type of surface cultures the Novy jar\r\n(Fig. 127) is the most practical device. It is good practice to combine\r\nthe vacuum method, the hydrogen replacement method and the oxygen\r\nabsorption method in using these jars. In operation a solution of 20\r\nper cent. NaOH is poured on the bottom of the jar to a depth of 1 or 2\r\ncm., the cultures are placed on glass supports above the alkali and a\r\nshort wide tube of strong pyrogallol is set in on the bottom in such a\r\nway that it may be easily upset and mixed with the alkali when it is\r\ndesired to do so. The cover is now clamped in position with all joints\r\nwell vaselined. Then the outlet tube is connected with a suction pump\r\nand the air drawn out. Meanwhile the inlet tube has been connected\r\nwith a hydrogen generator, and after the jar is exhausted hydrogen is\r\nallowed to flow in, and this process is repeated until one is satisfied\r\nthat the air is replaced. The suction exhausts the air from the tubes\r\nor plates so that much less time is required to replace the air with\r\nhydrogen. Finally the stop-cock is closed, and the pyrogallol solution\r\nis gently shaken down and mixed with the alkali so that any remaining\r\noxygen will be absorbed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 127.--Novy jars.]\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that facultative anaërobes as well as anaërobes\r\nwill grow under any of the above conditions, so that cultures of\r\norganisms so obtained must be further tested aërobically in order to\r\ndetermine to which group the organisms belong.\r\n\r\nReference has been made above to the “inoculation” of culture media,\r\nwhich means introducing into the medium used the desired material in\r\nthe proper way. For small quantities this is most conveniently done\r\nwith platinum “needles,” that is, pieces of platinum wire inserted\r\ninto the ends of glass rods. The “straight” needle is a piece of\r\nheavy platinum wire of about 0.022 inch in diameter (Fig. 128). It is\r\nused most frequently to inoculate all forms of _solid media_. The\r\nplatinum loop is of lighter wire, 0.018 inch. The loop in the end is\r\nconveniently made by twisting the wire around the lead of an ordinary\r\nlead-pencil. The “loop needle” (Fig. 129) is most used in transferring\r\nliquid media. On account of the high price of platinum, the author\r\nhas substituted “nichrome” wire for student use. This is stiffer, not\r\nso easily made into loops and breaks out of the rods more easily.\r\nThe latter defect is remedied to some extent, by imbedding the wire\r\nonly slightly for about one-fourth of an inch on the side of the end\r\nportion of the rod. The low cost, less than one-twentieth of platinum,\r\njustifies its use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 128.--Straight needle.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 129.--Straight and loop needles.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 130.--Pasteur flask--“ballon pipette.”]\r\n\r\nSterile graduated pipettes varying in capacity from 1 cc graduated in\r\nhundredths, upward, permit the transfer of definite amounts of liquids.\r\nLarge quantities are conveniently transferred by means of Pasteur\r\nflasks (Fig. 130). The details of inoculation are best derived from\r\nlaboratory practice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nISOLATION OF BACTERIA IN PURE CULTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs has been stated, the thorough study of a bacterium depends on\r\nfirst getting it in pure culture. In the early days of bacteriology\r\nsupposedly pure cultures were obtained by (1) _dilution in liquid\r\nmedia_. A series of tubes or flasks containing sterile liquid media was\r\nprepared. Number one was inoculated with the material to be examined\r\nand thoroughly mixed. A small portion of the mixture was transferred\r\nto number two, and mixed; from this to number three, and so on until a\r\nsufficient number were inoculated, the last three or four in the series\r\nreceiving the same amounts of a very high dilution of the original\r\nmaterial. If one or two of these latter showed a growth and the others\r\nnot, it was assumed that the dilution had been carried so far that only\r\na single organism was transferred and therefore the culture obtained\r\nwas “pure.” The method in this crude form is too uncertain to be of\r\nvalue today and recourse is had to more exact means. The procedure most\r\nwidely used is that of (2) “_plating out_” by means of gelatin or agar\r\nplates. The material to be plated out is diluted by transferring to\r\nthree or more tubes of melted gelatin or agar as in the first method\r\nand then all the tubes are poured into Petri dishes and grown under\r\nsuitable conditions. By proper mixing in the tubes the bacteria are\r\nwell scattered through the medium which holds the individual organisms\r\nseparate when it solidifies. On some of the plates a sufficient\r\ndilution will be reached so that the colonies developing from the\r\nbacteria will be so few that they are separate and pure cultures may\r\nbe obtained by inoculating from one of these a tube of the appropriate\r\nmedium (Figs. 131 to 134). The chief uncertainty with this method is\r\nthat occasionally two kinds of bacteria stick together so closely that\r\neven the separate colonies contain both organisms. This is not common,\r\nhowever. The plate colonies frequently develop from groups of bacteria\r\nwhich were not separated, but as these are of the same kind the culture\r\nis essentially pure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 131.--Dilution plates. × 3/10. _1_, shows the\r\nfirst dilution, the colonies are so numerous and small that they\r\nare invisible (compare Fig. 132); _2_, shows fewer and hence larger\r\ncolonies, but too crowded to isolate (compare Fig. 133); _3_, shows the\r\ncolonies larger and well separated, so that it is easy to isolate from\r\nthem (compare Fig. 134).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 132.--A portion of plate _1_ in Fig. 131 as seen\r\nunder the low-power objective. × 100. Very small, closely crowded\r\ncolonies.]\r\n\r\nAnother method which is frequently applicable with material from human\r\nor animal sources is to (3) _rub the material over the surface_ of a\r\nslope tube or of medium solidified in a Petri dish with a sterile heavy\r\nplatinum needle, glass rod, or cotton swab. If the bacteria are not\r\ntoo numerous, pure cultures may frequently be obtained. A modification\r\nof this method is to make a series of (4) _parallel streaks on a\r\nslope tube or plate of medium_ with a needle inserted _but once_ into\r\nthe material to be plated. On the first streak most of the bacteria\r\nare rubbed off and a continuous growth results, but usually on the\r\nlast of a series only isolated colonies appear, which are presumably\r\npure. The ideal method for securing pure cultures is to be absolutely\r\ncertain that the culture starts from a single organism. This may be\r\naccomplished by means of the (5) _apparatus and pipettes devised by\r\nProfessor Barber_ of the University of Kansas (Figs. 135 and 136). With\r\nthis instrument a single organism is picked out under the microscope\r\nand isolated in a drop of culture medium and observed until it is\r\nseen to divide, thus proving its viability. Transfers are then made\r\nto the proper media. The method requires much practice to develop the\r\nnecessary skill in the making of pipettes, determining the proper\r\ncondition of the large cover-glasses used over the isolating box, and\r\nin manipulation, but the results fully compensate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 133.--From the thinnest part of plate _2_, Fig. 131\r\nas seen under the low-power objective. × 100. Colonies much larger than\r\non plate _1_, but still crowded.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 134.--The smallest colony on plate _3_, Fig. 131,\r\nas seen under the low-power objective. × 100. Large, single, isolated\r\ncolony.]\r\n\r\nProfessor W. A. Starin of the author’s department, a former student of\r\nProfessor Barber, has done some excellent work with this apparatus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 135.--Diagram of Barber’s isolation apparatus. _b_,\r\nmoist chamber; _ms_, large cover-glass over moist chamber; _p_, small\r\npipette drawn out to a fine point; _k_, _r_, _g_, pipette holder; _f_,\r\nscrew for raising and lowering _k_, _r_, _g_; _s_, screw for lateral\r\nmotion of _k_, _r_, _g_; _n_, screw for clamp on pipette which allows\r\nit to be moved in or out; _m_, mechanical stage of microscope; _t_,\r\nrubber tube held in the mouth and used to move the liquid culture\r\nmedium in the pipette. (Journal of Infectious Diseases, October 20,\r\n1908, vol. 5, No. 4, p. 381.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 136.--Photograph of microscope with Barber’s\r\nisolation apparatus set up to use.]\r\n\r\nA number of procedures may be used to greatly facilitate the above\r\nmethods of isolation by taking advantage of the different physiological\r\nproperties of different organisms in a mixture such as ability\r\nto form spores, different resistance to antiseptics, special food\r\nrequirements, and pathogenic properties. (_a_) If material contains\r\nresistant spores, it may be _heated to temperatures high_ enough to\r\nkill all of the organisms except the spores (80° for half an hour, for\r\nexample) and then plated out. Or (_b_) _an antiseptic which restrains\r\nthe growth_ of some organisms and not others may be placed in the\r\nculture media (carbolic acid, various anilin dyes, (p. 162), excess\r\nacid, or alkali, ox bile, etc.), when the more resistant organisms grow\r\non the final plates, the others not. (_c_) _Special food substances_\r\n(various carbohydrates) from which the organism desired forms special\r\nproducts (acids, aldehydes) that may be shown on the plates by various\r\nindicators, is one of the commonest means. Or media in which certain\r\norganisms thrive and others not, so that the former soon “crowd out”\r\nthe latter (unsterilized milk for lactic acid bacteria, inorganic\r\nmedia in soil bacteriology) may be used. A combination of the general\r\nmethods (_b_) and (_c_) is much used in the separation of the organisms\r\nof the “intestinal group” in human practice. (_d_) _The inoculation\r\nof a susceptible animal_ with a mixture suspected to contain a given\r\npathogenic bacterium frequently results in the development of the\r\nlatter in pure culture in the body of an animal, from which it may be\r\nreadily recovered. In all of the above methods (except Barber’s) the\r\nfirst “pure culture” obtained should be “purified” by replating in a\r\nseries of dilution plates to make sure that it is pure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\nSTUDY OF INDIVIDUAL BACTERIA--STAINING.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen an organism has been obtained in pure culture by any of the\r\nmethods described in the preceding chapter the next step is the study\r\nof its morphology as discussed in Chapters II--IV. This involves the\r\nuse of the microscope, and since bacteria are so small, objectives\r\nof higher power than the student has presumably used will be needed.\r\nDoubtless only the two-thirds inch or 16 mm. and the one-sixth inch or\r\n4 mm. objectives are all that have been used in previous microscopic\r\nwork, while for examining bacteria a one-twelfth inch or 2 mm. is\r\nnecessary. It will have been observed that the higher the power of\r\nthe objective the smaller is the front lens or object glass and\r\nconsequently the less is the amount of light which enters. With the use\r\nof the one-twelfth inch or 2 mm. objective it is necessary to employ\r\ntwo devices for increasing the amount of light entering it, with which\r\nthe student is probably not familiar. One of these is to place a drop\r\nof cedar oil between the front lens and the object and to immerse the\r\nlens in this oil--hence the term “oil-immersion objective;” the other\r\nis the substage or Abbé condenser. The latter is a system of lenses\r\nplaced below the stage and so constructed as to bring parallel rays of\r\nlight--daylight--from an area much larger than the face of the front\r\nlens of the objective to a focus on the object to be examined, thus\r\nadding very greatly to the amount of light entering the objective.\r\nSince the condenser brings _parallel_ rays to a focus on the object,\r\nthe _flat-mirror_ is always used with the condenser when working with\r\ndaylight. With _artificial light close_ to the microscope, the concave\r\nmirror may be used to make the divergent rays more nearly parallel and\r\nthus give better illumination.\r\n\r\nThe function of immersion oil is to prevent the dispersion of\r\nconsiderable light that would otherwise occur owing to refraction\r\nas the light passes up through the slide and into the air. The\r\naccompanying diagram will help to make this clearer (Fig. 137). A ray\r\nof light (_A B_) coming through the slide will be refracted in the\r\ndirection _B C_ if the medium has a lower refractive index than the\r\nslide, as air has, and hence will not enter the objective _O_. If,\r\nhowever, there is interposed between the objective and the slide a\r\nmedium which has the same refractive index as the slide, as immersion\r\noil has, then the ray will continue in the same direction (_B D_) at\r\nthe point _B_ and hence enter the objective. Evidently the immersion\r\noil causes much more light to enter the front lens and makes the field\r\nbrighter and at the same time prevents considerable refraction and\r\ndispersion of light from the object seen and hence this appears more\r\ndistinct and sharply defined. The Abbé condenser and the oil-immersion\r\nobjective are practically always used in the microscopic study of\r\nbacteria (Fig. 138).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 137.--Diagram of use of immersion oil.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 138.--Diagram of paths of rays of microscope.]\r\n\r\n\r\nHANGING DROP SLIDE.\r\n\r\nIt is sometimes necessary to examine living bacteria and for this\r\npurpose the device known as the “hanging drop slide” is used (Fig.\r\n139). The slide has a slight concave depression ground in the middle\r\nof one face. A ring of vaseline is placed around this depression with\r\nthe loop needle. On a clean cover-glass, large enough to fit over the\r\nring of vaseline, several drops of a broth culture, or of material\r\nfrom a solid culture suspended in broth or physiological normal salt\r\nsolution are placed. The slide is inverted on the cover-glass in such\r\na way that the ring of vaseline seals the latter to the slide. When\r\nthe whole preparation is quickly turned cover side up, the drops are\r\nseen “hanging” to the under side of the cover over the depression in\r\nthe slide. In examining such a preparation with the microscope great\r\ncare is necessary in order to focus on the bacteria, without breaking\r\nthe cover. To see the organisms distinctly the _lower iris diaphragm of\r\nthe condenser must be nearly closed_, so that the light coming through\r\nconsists mainly of parallel vertical rays, otherwise the transparent\r\nbacteria themselves refract and diffract the light and appear blurred\r\nand indistinct. By studying living bacteria with this device it can\r\nbe determined whether they are motile or not. The motility should not\r\nbe confounded with the familiar “Brownian movement” of all minute\r\ninsoluble inert particles which non-motile living bacteria and\r\nalso dead bacteria show. The hanging drop slide is of value in the\r\nmeasurement of bacteria, since this is properly done on the living\r\norganism. Measurement is done with a calibrated ocular micrometer as in\r\nother kinds of measurement with the microscope with which the student\r\nis presumably familiar. The direct effect of various agents on living\r\nbacteria as light, electricity, heat, etc., in the study of “tropisms”\r\nand “taxes” has been investigated on various modifications of the\r\nabove-described hanging drop slide.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 139.--Hanging drop slide.]\r\n\r\nCell forms and cell groupings may be studied in the same way but\r\nthese features are best determined on _stained_ preparations in many\r\ninstances.\r\n\r\n“Dark field” illumination and the ultramicroscope are of great value in\r\nthe study of living bacteria and other minute objects, but apparatus\r\nof this type would scarcely be used by the student in an introductory\r\ncourse, so that they will not be discussed in the present volume.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTAINING.\r\n\r\nThe main use of the microscope in bacteriology is in the study of\r\n_stained preparations_ of the organisms. Staining makes bacteria opaque\r\nand hence more easily seen than the transparent unstained forms. Some\r\nmethods of staining also show morphological structures which are either\r\nimperfectly recognized in the unstained cell, spores, or are not\r\nvisible at all--capsules, metachromatic granules, flagella. Finally\r\ncertain bacteria are colored by special methods of staining which do\r\nnot affect others, so that under proper conditions these bacteria may\r\nbe recognized by staining methods alone--tubercle bacilli in the organs\r\nof animals.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of staining are essentially chemical, though sometimes\r\nthe chemical union is a very weak one, even resembling an absorption of\r\nthe dye rather than true chemical union--most watery stains. In other\r\ncases the chemical compounds formed are decidedly stable and are not\r\ndecomposed even by strong mineral acids--staining of tubercle bacilli\r\nand other “acid-fast” organisms. In still other cases the principal\r\naction is a precipitation on the surface of the object stained--methods\r\nfor staining flagella.\r\n\r\nIn many methods of staining in addition to the dyes used other\r\nsubstances are added to the solution which assist in fixing the dye in\r\nor on the organism stained. Such substances are called _mordants_. The\r\nprincipal mordants used are alkalies, anilin, carbolic acid, iodine,\r\nmetallic salts, tannic acid.\r\n\r\nWhile it is true that some bacteria may be stained by that standard\r\nhistological nuclear dye, hematoxylin, it is of little value for this\r\npurpose. Practically all bacteriological stains are solutions of the\r\n_anilin dyes_. These dyes, as is well known, are of nearly every\r\nconceivable color and shade but relatively very few are used in\r\nbacteriological work. The beginning student will rarely use solutions\r\nof other than the three dyes _fuchsin_ (red), _methylene blue_ and\r\n_gentian violet_ for staining bacteria, with occasionally Bismarck\r\nbrown, or eosin, or safranin as tissue contrast stains.\r\n\r\nThe bacteriological dyes are kept “in stock” as saturated solutions in\r\n95 per cent. alcohol which are _never used as stains_, but merely for\r\nconvenience in making the various staining solutions.\r\n\r\nThe approximate percentages of the three common dyes in such solutions\r\nare indicated in the following table adapted from Woods _Chemical and\r\nMicroscopical Diagnosis_, Third Edition, 1917, Appendix:\r\n\r\n  Fuchsin           3.0%\r\n  Gentian Violet    4.8%\r\n  Methylene Blue    2.0%\r\n\r\nThe stains made from these dyes which are in most common use are the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n  1. Aqueous (watery) gentian violet solution.\r\n\r\n  Saturated alcoholic solution of gentian violet      1 part\r\n  Distilled water                                    20 parts\r\n  Mix well and filter.\r\n\r\n  2. Anilin gentian violet.\r\n\r\n  Saturated alcoholic solution of gentian violet      1 part\r\n  Anilin water (see below)                           10 parts\r\n  Mix well and filter.\r\n\r\n  3. Anilin Fuchsin.\r\n\r\n  Saturated alcoholic solution of fuchsin             1 part\r\n  Anilin water (see below)                           10 parts\r\n  Mix and filter.\r\n\r\nThese stains rarely keep longer than ten days in the laboratory (unless\r\nkept in the ice-box) and must be made fresh on the first sign of a\r\ndeposit on the glass of the container.\r\n\r\n=Anilin Water.=--Anilin water is made by putting 3 or 4 cc of anilin\r\n“oil” in a 120 cc. flask, adding 100 cc of distilled water, shaking\r\nvigorously for a minute or so and filtering through a wet filter, in\r\nother words, a saturated solution of anilin in water.\r\n\r\n  4. Löffler’s (methylene) blue.\r\n\r\n  Saturated alcoholic solution of methylene blue      3 parts\r\n  Aqueous solution of NaOH (or KOH), 1 to 10,000     10   „\r\n  Mix and filter.\r\n\r\n  5. Carbol-fuchsin (Ziehl’s solution).\r\n\r\n  Saturated alcoholic solution of fuchsin             1 part\r\n  5 per cent. aqueous solution of carbolic acid      10 parts\r\n  Mix and filter.\r\n\r\n  6.

Square bottles are set\r\nin square holes in the block. The capacity of each bottle is 30 cc.]\r\n\r\nStaining solutions are conveniently kept in square dropping bottles\r\ninserted in a block as shown in Fig. 140. This form of holder\r\nnecessitates the use of _one hand only_ in securing the stain and\r\ndropping it on the preparation.\r\n\r\nThe actual staining of bacteriological preparations can be learned only\r\nby repeated laboratory practice, yet the following methods have given\r\nsuch uniform results in class work that it is felt they are not out of\r\nplace in a text-book.\r\n\r\n=Preparation of the “Film.”=--The author learned to stain bacteria,\r\non the “cover-glass” but does not recall having used this method in\r\nfifteen years and does not teach it to his students. All staining is\r\ndone on the slide. To prepare a film from a solid culture medium the\r\nprocedure is as follows:\r\n\r\nFirst, be sure the slide is clean and _free from grease_. This is\r\naccomplished most readily by scouring a few minutes with finely\r\nground pumice stone and a little water, then washing and drying with\r\na grease-free cloth, handkerchief, or piece of cheese-cloth. With the\r\n“loop” needle place in the middle of the slide a small loop of water.\r\nThis is best done by filling the loop by dipping in water, then tapping\r\nit gently so that all that remains is the water that just fills the\r\nloop level full, and this amount is placed on the slide by touching\r\nthe flat side of the loop to the glass. Then the _straight needle_ is\r\nsterilized, dipped into the culture and just touched once into the\r\nsmall drop of water on the slide. The remainder of the culture on the\r\nstraight needle is then burned off and the needle is used to spread the\r\ndrop of water containing the bacteria into a thin even film, which will\r\nresult, provided the slide is free from grease. This is dried and then\r\n“fixed” by passing three times through the Bunsen flame at intervals of\r\nabout one second, passing through slowly for thick slides and a little\r\nmore rapidly for thin ones. If the culture is in a liquid medium, the\r\nuse of the loop of water is unnecessary; a loop of the fluid from the\r\nsurface, middle or bottom as the culture indicates is spread out to a\r\nthin film, dried and fixed.\r\n\r\nAfter the film is fixed the stain desired is dropped on, allowed\r\nto act for the proper time, which will depend on the stain and the\r\npreparation, washed in water, dried thoroughly and examined with the\r\noil-immersion lens, without a cover. If it is desired to preserve the\r\npreparation it may then be mounted in balsam. This is not necessary, as\r\nthey keep just as well, provided the immersion oil is removed. To do\r\nthis, fold a piece of filter paper so that at least three thicknesses\r\nresult. Lay this on the slide and press firmly several times, when the\r\nsurplus oil will be taken up by the paper. Slides not mounted in balsam\r\nare more apt to become dusty than those that are. This is the only\r\ndisadvantage.\r\n\r\n=Gram’s Method of Staining.=--It has been ascertained that some\r\nbacteria contain a substance, possibly a protein, which forms a\r\ncompound with gentian violet and iodine, which compound is insoluble in\r\nalcohol, and other bacteria do not contain this substance. Consequently\r\nwhen bacteria are stained by Gram’s method (given below), those that\r\ncontain this chemical remain colored, while if it is not present the\r\ndye is washed out by the alcohol and the bacteria are colorless and may\r\nbe stained by a contrast stain. The bacteria which stain by this method\r\nare said to “take Gram’s” or to be “Gram-positive,” while those that\r\ndecolorize are called “Gram-negative.” The method is:\r\n\r\n1. Prepare the film as above given.\r\n\r\n2. Stain with fresh anilin gentian violet 1 minute.\r\n\r\n3. Wash in tap water.\r\n\r\n4. Cover with Gram’s solution 1 minute.\r\n\r\n5. Wash in tap water.\r\n\r\n6. Wash with 95 per cent. alcohol three times or until no more color\r\ncomes out.\r\n\r\n7. Dry and examine.\r\n\r\nGram’s solution is:\r\n\r\n  I           1 part\r\n  KI          2 parts\r\n  H₂O       300   „\r\n\r\nThis method is excellent for differentiating Gram-positive and\r\nGram-negative organisms on the same slide. First stain by this\r\nmethod and after washing with alcohol stain with a counter-stain,\r\ncarbol-fuchsin diluted ten to fifteen times with water is excellent.\r\nThe Gram-positive bacteria are violet and the Gram-negative are red.\r\n\r\nIt is also of great value in staining Gram-positive bacteria in\r\ntissues, but the sections should be stained about five minutes in\r\nthe anilin gentian violet and be left about two minutes in the Gram’s\r\nsolution. Sections are to be counter-stained in Bismarck brown, dilute\r\neosin or safranin solutions and cleared in oil of bergamot, lavender or\r\noriganum and not in clove oil or carbol-xylol, as these latter dissolve\r\nout the dye from the bacteria.\r\n\r\n=Staining of Spores in the Rod.=--Prepare the films as usual. Cover\r\nwith carbol-fuchsin, using plenty of stain so that it will not dry on\r\nthe slide; heat until vapor arises, not to boiling; cool until the\r\nstain becomes cloudy and heat again until the stain clears, and repeat\r\nonce more; wash in tap water and then wash in 1 per cent. H₂SO₄ three\r\ntimes, dropping on plenty of acid, tilting and running this over the\r\nslide three times and then pour off and use fresh acid and repeat this\r\nonce. Wash thoroughly in _distilled_ water, then stain with Löffler’s\r\nblue one to three minutes. Wash, dry and examine. The spores should be\r\nbright red in a blue rod.\r\n\r\nThis method will give good results if care is taken to secure cultures\r\nof the right age. If the culture is too old the spores will all be free\r\noutside the rods, while if too young they will decolorize with the\r\nacid. For _Bacillus subtilis_ and _Bacillus anthracis_, cultures on\r\nagar slants forty-eight hours in the 37° incubator are just right. For\r\nthe spores of _Clostridium tetani_, the culture should be three days\r\nold, but may be as old as a week.\r\n\r\n=Staining of “Acid-fast” Bacilli.=--_Mycobacterium tuberculosis,\r\nMycobacterium of Johne’s disease, “grass” and “butter bacilli,”\r\nMycobacterium lepræ, Mycobacterium smegmatis._\r\n\r\n_Gabbet’s method_:\r\n\r\n  1. Prepare the film as usual.\r\n\r\n  2. Stain with carbol-fuchsin as given above for spores.\r\n\r\n  3. Wash with tap water.\r\n\r\n  4. Decolorize and stain at the same time with Gabbet’s blue, two or\r\n  three minutes.\r\n\r\n  5. Wash, dry and examine.\r\n\r\nThe sulphuric acid in Gabbet’s blue removes the carbol-fuchsin from\r\neverything except the “acid-fast” bacteria, which remain red, and the\r\nblue stains the decolorized bacteria and nuclei of any tissue cells\r\npresent.\r\n\r\n_Ziehl-Neelson method_:\r\n\r\n  1, 2, 3, as in Gabbet’s method.\r\n\r\n  4. Decolorize with 10 per cent. HCl until washing with water shows\r\n  only a faint pink color left on slide.\r\n\r\n  5. Wash thoroughly.\r\n\r\n  6. Stain with Löffler’s blue one or two minutes.\r\n\r\n  7. Wash, dry and examine.\r\n\r\nThe results are the same as with Gabbet’s method.\r\n\r\n=Staining of Capsules.=--_Räbiger’s Method._--Films of the organism\r\nto show capsules should be _freshly prepared, dried but not fixed_.\r\nMaterial is usually obtained from milk or blood. A drop of the fluid\r\nis placed on the middle of a slide about one-fourth of the distance\r\nfrom one end. The narrow edge of another clean slide is placed in this\r\ndrop and then drawn lengthwise across the slide with firm pressure.\r\nThis gives a _thin layer_ which is necessary if good results are to\r\nbe expected. The preparation is covered with a _freshly prepared_\r\nsaturated solution of gentian violet in formalin and this allowed\r\nto stain for 30 seconds. Then wash _lightly_, dry and examine. The\r\norganisms appear deeply violet and much larger than with ordinary\r\nstains and capsules are well stained and show well.\r\n\r\n_Welch’s Method._--Prepare films as in the above method. Cover with\r\nglacial acetic acid for 10 to 20 seconds. Wash off the acid with\r\ncarbol-fuchsin. Wash the stain off with physiological normal salt\r\nsolution (0.85 per cent.) until all surplus stain is removed. Dry and\r\nexamine. Capsules and bacteria are red.\r\n\r\n=Staining of Flagella.=--The rendering of flagella visible is\r\nconsidered one of the most difficult processes in staining. Experience\r\nof a number of years during which whole classes numbering from one\r\nhundred to three hundred students accomplish this result shows that it\r\nis no more difficult than many other staining processes. The essentials\r\nare: (1) clean slides, (2) young cultures on agar slopes, (3) freshly\r\nprepared mordant and stain which are kept free from precipitate,\r\n(4) gentle heating. The author’s students are furnished only stock\r\nmaterials and make their own cultures, mordants and stains.\r\n\r\nThe slides are cleaned with pumice in the usual way. An agar slope\r\nculture of the organism to be stained from six to twenty-four hours\r\nold is selected. A bit of the culture is removed and placed in a\r\nwatch-glass of water. The bacteria are allowed to diffuse of themselves\r\nwithout stirring. After several minutes a loop of this water is removed\r\nand three streaks are made across the slide, one in the middle and one\r\non each side of this about one-quarter of an inch from it. This gives\r\nwell scattered bacteria in one of the three streaks at least and very\r\nlittle other material on the slide to cause precipitates. The slide is\r\ncarefully dried and fixed and then covered with an abundance of the\r\nmordant by filtering through a small filter onto the slide so that the\r\nmordant shows transparent on the slide. The preparation is then gently\r\nwarmed and cooled three times, adding mordant if necessary. _Do not\r\nheat to steaming._ After mordanting for about five minutes the excess\r\nis washed off under the tap. It is a good plan to hold the slide level\r\nand allow the water to run into the center of the mordant and flow it\r\noff. Inclining the slide is apt to cause the film on the surface of the\r\nmordant to settle down on the slide and spoil the preparation. After\r\nthe mordant is washed off and all traces of it removed with a clean\r\ncloth if necessary the stain is applied and gently heated and cooled\r\nthe same way for from three to five minutes. The preparation is then\r\nwashed, dried and examined.\r\n\r\nThe mordant used is a modification of Löffler’s which is somewhat\r\nsimpler in preparation since the stock solution of FeCl₃ is more\r\npermanent than FeSO₄ solution.\r\n\r\nMordant sufficient for one student:\r\n\r\n  5 per cent. solution of FeCl₃           20.0 cc\r\n  25 per cent. solution of tannic acid    20.0 cc\r\n  Anilin fuchsin                           4.0 cc\r\n  Normal NaOH                              1.5 cc\r\n\r\nThe solution of FeCl₃ is made up in the cold and must be perfectly\r\nclear. The tannic acid solution must be thoroughly boiled and filtered\r\nuntil clear. The iron and the acid are carefully mixed, boiled and\r\nfiltered clear. The anilin fuchsin must be added slowly with constant\r\nstirring and the mixture boiled and filtered. The NaOH is added in the\r\nsame way and this mixture boiled and filtered. The final mordant should\r\nnot leave a film on a clean slide when poured on and allowed to run\r\noff. Unless the mordant is in this condition and perfectly clear, it\r\nshould not be used, but a new one must be made up. Time and care in the\r\npreparation of the mordant are essential.\r\n\r\nThe stain to follow this mordant is anilin fuchsin.\r\n\r\n=Staining of Metachromatic Granules.=--_Neisser’s Method._ Prepare the\r\nfilm in the usual way. Stain with Neisser’s stain a few seconds only.\r\nWash and stain with Bismarck brown a few seconds only.\r\n\r\n  _Neisser’s Stain_:\r\n\r\n  Sat. alcoholic solution of methylene blue   1.0 part\r\n  Glacial acetic acid                         2.5 parts\r\n  Distilled water                            50.0 parts\r\n\r\n  _Bismarck Brown_:\r\n\r\n  Bismarck brown (dry dye)                      2 parts\r\n  Distilled Water                            1000 parts\r\n\r\nBy the use of the hanging drop slide and the methods of staining just\r\ndescribed all the various morphological features of the bacterial cell\r\nmay be ascertained.\r\n\r\nIt is necessary when _cell groupings_ as characteristic of definite\r\nmodes of division are to be determined to make slides from a liquid\r\nculture, as broth. Place a drop of the material, preferably from the\r\nbottom of the tube in most instances, from the top in case a pellicle\r\nor scum is formed on the surface, on the slide and allow this to dry\r\n_without spreading it out_, fix, wash gently with water, then stain\r\nlightly with Löffler’s blue. Such slides also show characteristic\r\n_cell forms_ as well. Slides should be made from solid media to show\r\nvariations in form and size and involution forms. These latter are\r\nespecially apt to occur on potato media.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nSTUDY OF THE PHYSIOLOGY OF BACTERIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nOf the environmental conditions influencing the growth of bacteria the\r\nfollowing are the chief ones ordinarily determined:\r\n\r\n_A._ Temperature.--The optimum temperature for growth is usually\r\nabout the temperature of the natural environment and ordinarily one\r\ndetermines merely whether the organism grows at body temperature (37°)\r\nand at room temperature (20°) or not. For exact work the maximum,\r\nminimum and optimum temperature must be ascertained by growing in\r\n“incubators” with varying temperatures.\r\n\r\nA bacteriological incubator is an apparatus for growing bacteria at a\r\nconstant temperature. This may be any temperature within the limits for\r\nbacterial growth. If temperatures above that of an ordinary room are\r\ndesired, some source of artificial heat is needed. Electricity, gas or\r\noil may be used. A necessary adjunct is some device for maintaining\r\nthe temperature constant, a “thermoregulator” or “thermostat.” For\r\nlower temperatures a cooling arrangement must be installed. For the\r\ngreat part of bacteriological work only two temperatures are used, 20°\r\nso-called “room temperature” (this applies to European “rooms” not to\r\nAmerican) and 37° or body temperature. Incubators for 37° of almost any\r\nsize and style desired may be secured from supply houses and need not\r\nbe further described. Figs. 141 and 142 illustrate some of the types.\r\n\r\nFor use with large classes “incubator rooms” are to be preferred. The\r\nauthor has one such room for 37° work with 200 compartments for student\r\nuse which did not cost over $60 to install.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 141.--Small laboratory incubator, gas heated.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 142.--Electric incubator.]\r\n\r\nThe styles of incubators for lower temperatures, 20° and below, are not\r\nso numerous nor so satisfactory. The author has constructed a device\r\nwhich answers every purpose for a small class. The diagram, Fig. 143,\r\nexplains it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 143.--Diagram of fittings for a cold incubator.\r\n_1._ small tank for constant head, about 1 foot in each dimension. _a_,\r\ninflow; _b_, overflow; _c_, lead pipe. _2_, refrigerator. _a′_, ice;\r\n_b′_, flat coil under ice; _c′_, outflow to incubator. _3_, incubator.\r\n_a″_, cold water inflow; _b″_, overflow; thermometer and burner\r\nomitted. The diagram explains the construction. The water cooled to\r\nabout 14° with artificial ice by flowing through the lead coil under\r\nthe ice, flows into the incubator which may be heated and regulated in\r\nthe usual way.]\r\n\r\nThe thermal death-point is determined by exposing the organisms in\r\nthin tubes of broth at varying temperatures for ten-minute periods and\r\nthen plating out to determine growth. The effect of heat may also be\r\ndetermined by exposing at a given temperature, _e.g._, 60°, for varying\r\nlengths of time and plating out.\r\n\r\n_B._ Oxygen relations--whether the organism is aërobic, anaërobic, or\r\nfacultative is determined by inoculation in gelatin or agar puncture or\r\nstab cultures and noting whether the most abundant growth is at the\r\ntop, the bottom or all along the line of inoculation.\r\n\r\n_C._ Reaction of the medium--acid, alkaline or neutral as influencing\r\nthe rate and amount of growth.\r\n\r\n_D._ The kind of medium on which the organism grows best.\r\n\r\n_E._ The effect of injurious chemicals, as various disinfectants, on\r\nthe growth.\r\n\r\n_F._ Osmotic pressure conditions, though modifying decidedly the growth\r\nof bacteria, are not usually studied as aids in their recognition, nor\r\nare the effects of various forms of energy, such as light, electricity,\r\n_x_-rays, etc.\r\n\r\nAmong the “Physiological Activities” discussed in Chapters IX-XII those\r\nwhich, in addition to the staining reactions described, are of most\r\nuse in the identification of non-pathogenic bacteria are the first ten\r\nlisted below. For pathogenic bacteria the entire thirteen are needed.\r\n\r\n1. Liquefaction of gelatin.\r\n\r\n2. Digestion of blood serum.\r\n\r\n3. Coagulation and digestion of milk.\r\n\r\n4. Acid or gaseous fermentation in milk, or both.\r\n\r\n5. Acid or gaseous fermentation of various carbohydrates in\r\ncarbohydrate broth, or both.\r\n\r\n6. Production of indol in “indol solution.”\r\n\r\n7. Production of pigments on various media.\r\n\r\n8. Reduction of nitrates to nitrites, ammonia, or free nitrogen.\r\n\r\n9. Production of enzymes as illustrated in the above activities.\r\n\r\n10. Appearance of growth on different culture media.\r\n\r\n11. Production of free toxins as determined by injection of animals\r\nwith broth cultures filtered free from bacteria.\r\n\r\n12. Causation of disease as ascertained by the injection of animals\r\nwith the bacteria themselves, and recovery of the organism from the\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n13. Formation of specific antibodies as determined by the\r\nproper injection of animals with the organism or its products\r\nand the subsequent testing of the blood serum of the inoculated\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\nFor special kinds of bacteria other activities must be determined\r\n(oxidation, nitrate and nitrite formation, action of sulphur and iron\r\nbacteria, etc.).\r\n\r\nThe first nine activities are determined by inoculating the different\r\nculture media already described and observing the phenomena indicated,\r\nmaking chemical tests where necessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPEARANCE OF GROWTH ON DIFFERENT CULTURE MEDIA.\r\n\r\nIn addition to those changes that are associated with the manifestation\r\nof different physiological activities, many bacteria, show\r\ncharacteristic appearances on the various culture media which are of\r\nvalue in their identification.\r\n\r\nToo much stress should not be laid on these appearances alone, however,\r\nsince slight variations, particularly in solid media due especially to\r\nthe age of the medium, may change decidedly the appearance of a colony.\r\nThis is true of variations in the amount of moisture on agar plates.\r\nColonies which are ordinarily round and regular may assume very diverse\r\nshapes, if there chance to be an excess of moisture on the surface.\r\n\r\nAlso in slope and puncture cultures on the various solid media much\r\nvariation results from the amount of material on the inoculation needle\r\nand just how the puncture is made, or the needle drawn over the slope.\r\nThese variations are largely prevented by the use of standard media and\r\nby inoculating by standard methods. The Laboratory Committee of the\r\nAmerican Public Health Association has proposed standard methods for\r\nall culture media and tests and for methods of inoculation, and these\r\nhave been generally adopted in this country for comparative work.\r\n\r\nLikewise the Society of American Bacteriologists has at different times\r\n(1904, 1914, 1917) adopted “descriptive charts” for detailing all the\r\ncharacteristics of a given organism. A committee is at present working\r\non a revision of the 1917 chart to be presented at the 1920 meeting.\r\nOne of the earlier charts which includes a glossary of descriptive\r\nterms is inserted in this chapter.\r\n\r\nAmong the cultural appearances the following are of most importance:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 144.--Broth cultures × 2/3. _1_ uninoculated\r\ntransparent broth; _2_, broth cloudy from growth of organisms; _3_,\r\nbroth slightly cloudy with a deposit in bottom; _4_, broth slightly\r\ncloudy with a heavy membrane at the surface.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 145.--A filiform stab or puncture culture. × 3/5.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 146.--A beaded stab or puncture culture. × 1/2.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 147.--A villous stab or puncture culture. × 1/2.]\r\n\r\nIn broth cultures the presence or absence of growth on the surface\r\nand the amount of the same. Whether the broth is rendered cloudy or\r\nremains clear, and whether there is a deposit at the bottom or not\r\n(Fig. 144). An abundant surface growth with little or nothing below\r\nindicates a strict aërobe, while a growth or deposit at bottom and a\r\nclear or nearly clear medium above, an anaërobe. These appearances are\r\nfor the first few days only of growth. If the broth is disturbed, or\r\nafter the culture stands for several days many surface growths tend to\r\nsink to the bottom. So an actively motile organism causes in general\r\na cloudiness, especially if the organism is a facultative anaërobe,\r\nwhich tends to clear up by precipitation after several days when the\r\norganisms lose their motility. Non-motile facultative anaërobes\r\nusually cloud the broth also, but settle out more rapidly than the\r\nmotile ones.\r\n\r\nIn gelatin and agar punctures the oxygen relationship is shown by\r\nsurface growth for aërobes, growth near the bottom of the puncture\r\nfor anaërobes, and a fairly uniform growth all along the line of\r\ninoculation for facultative anaërobes. In the case of these last\r\norganisms, a preference for more or less oxygen is indicated by the\r\napproach to the aërobic or anaërobic type of growth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 148 FIG. 149 FIG. 150 FIG. 151\r\n\r\nFIG. 148.--Crateriform liquefaction of gelatin. × 1/2.\r\n\r\nFIG. 149.--Funnelform liquefaction of gelatin. × 1/2.\r\n\r\nFIG. 150.--Saccate liquefaction of gelatin. × 1/2.\r\n\r\nFIG. 151.--Stratiform liquefaction of gelatin. × 1/2.]\r\n\r\nAlong the line of puncture the commonest types are _filiform_ (Fig.\r\n145), which indicates a uniform growth; _beaded_ (Fig. 146), or small\r\nseparate colonies; _villous_ (Fig. 147), delicate lateral outgrowths\r\nwhich do not branch; _arborescent_, tree-like growths branching\r\nlaterally from the line. In agar these branchings are usually short and\r\nstubby, or technically, _papillate_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 152.--Filiform slope culture. × 1/2.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 153.--Filiform, slightly spreading, slope culture.\r\n× 1/2.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 154.--Beaded slope culture. × 1/2.]\r\n\r\nFurther, in the gelatin puncture the liquefaction which occurs is\r\nfrequently characteristic. It may be _crateriform_ (Fig. 148), a\r\nshallow saucer at the surface; or _funnel-shaped_ (Fig. 149); or it\r\nmay be of uniform width all along the puncture, _i.e._, _saccate_ (Fig.\r\n150); or it may be _stratiform_, (Fig. 151), _i.e._, the liquefaction\r\nextends to the sides of the tube and proceeds uniformly downward.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 155 FIG. 156 FIG. 157 FIG. 158\r\n\r\nFIG. 155.--Effuse slope culture. × 1/2.\r\n\r\nFIG. 156.--Rhizoid slope culture. × 1/2.\r\n\r\nFIG. 157.--Rugose slope culture. × 1/2.\r\n\r\nFIG. 158.--Verrucose slope culture. × 1/2.]\r\n\r\nOn agar, potato and blood serum slope tubes the amount of growth, its\r\nform and elevation, the character of the surface, and the consistency\r\nshould be carefully noted, and in some few cases the character of the\r\nedge. Figures 152 to 158 show some of the commoner types.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 159.--Punctiform colonies on a plate. × 1/2.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 160.--A rhizoid colony on a plate. Natural size.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 161.--Ameboid colonies on a plate. × 1/2.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 162.--Large effuse colony on a plate. The edge is\r\nlacerated. Incidentally the colony shows the rate of growth for six\r\nsuccessive days. × 2/3.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 163.--Colony with edge entire as seen under the\r\nlow-power objective. × 100.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 164.--Colony with edge coarsely granular as seen\r\nunder the low-power objective. × 100.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 165.--Colony with edge curled as seen under the\r\nlow-power objective. × 100.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 166.--Colony with edge rhizoid as seen under the\r\nlow-power objective. × 100.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 167.--A small deep rhizoid colony as seen under the\r\nlow-power objective. × 100.]\r\n\r\nOn agar and gelatin plates made so that the colonies are well isolated,\r\nthe form of the latter, the rate of their growth, the character of the\r\nedge and of the surface, the elevation and the internal structure\r\nas determined by a low-power lens are often of almost diagnostic\r\nvalue. Also in the case of the gelatin plates, the character of the\r\nliquefaction is important. Figs. 159 to 167 show some of the commoner\r\ncharacteristics to be noted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 168.--A small mold colony natural size as viewed by\r\ntransmitted light.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 169.--The same colony as viewed by reflected light.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 170.--A portion of the thin edge of the same colony\r\nas seen with the lower-power objective. × 100.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 171.--A single fruiting body (sporangium) from the\r\nsame colony as seen under the lower-power objective. × 100.]\r\n\r\nColonies of mold frequently appear on plates. These are readily\r\ndifferentiated from bacterial colonies after a little experience. With\r\nthe naked eye usually the fine radiations of the edge of the colony\r\nare apparent. The surface appears duller and by reflected light more\r\nor less “fuzzy.” With the low-power objective the relatively large,\r\nbranching threads of the mold (mycelia) show distinctly. Also the large\r\nfruiting bodies (sporangia) are easily distinguished. Figs. 168 to 171\r\nillustrate a common black mold (_Rhizopus nigricans_).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nANIMAL INOCULATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAnimal inoculation has been referred to (1) as a method of assisting\r\nin the preparation of pure cultures of pathogenic organisms; (2) as a\r\nmeans of testing the poisonous properties of substances produced in\r\nbacterial cultures; (3) in order to test the ability of an organism to\r\ncause a disease; (4) for the production of various antibodies; it may\r\nbe added (5) that some bacteria produce in the smaller experimental\r\nanimals lesions which do not occur in animals naturally infected, but\r\nwhich nevertheless are characteristic for the given organism. The best\r\nillustration is the testicular reaction of young male guinea-pigs to\r\nintraperitoneal injections of glanders bacilli. Experimental animals\r\nare also inoculated (6) to test the potency of various bacterial and\r\nother biological products, as toxins, antitoxins, etc.\r\n\r\nGuinea-pigs are the most widely used experimental animals because they\r\nare easily kept and are susceptible to so many diseases on artificial\r\ninoculation. Rabbits are used very largely also, as are white mice. For\r\nspecial purposes white rats, pigeons, goats and swine are necessary.\r\nFor commercial products horses (antitoxins) and cattle (smallpox\r\nvaccine) are employed. In the study of many human diseases the higher\r\nmonkeys and even the anthropoid apes are necessary, since none of the\r\nlower animals are susceptible.\r\n\r\nThe commonest method of animal inoculation is undoubtedly the\r\n_subcutaneous_. This is accomplished most readily with the hypodermic\r\nneedle. The skin at the point selected (usually in guinea-pigs the\r\nlateral posterior half of the abdominal surface, in mice the back near\r\nthe root of the tail) is pinched up to avoid entering the muscles and\r\nthe needle quickly inserted. Clipping the hairs and washing with an\r\nantiseptic solution should precede the inoculation as routine practice.\r\nFrequently a small “skin pocket” is all that is needed. The hair is\r\nclipped off, the skin pinched up with small forceps and a slight snip\r\nwith sharp scissors is made. The material may be inserted into this\r\npocket with a heavy platinum needle. _Cutaneous_ inoculation is made\r\nby shaving the skin and rubbing the material onto the shaved surface\r\nor scratching with a scalpel or special scarifier, but without drawing\r\nblood, and then rubbing in the material to be inoculated.\r\n\r\n_Intravenous_ injections are made with larger animals. In rabbits the\r\nposterior external auricular is a convenient vein. In larger animals\r\nthe external jugular is used.\r\n\r\n_Intraperitoneal_, _-thoracic_, _-cardiac_, _-ocular_, _-muscular_\r\ninjections, and injections into the parenchyma of internal organs are\r\naccomplished with the hypodermic needle. In the case of the first two,\r\ninjury to contained organs should be carefully avoided. Intracardiac\r\ninjection, or aspiration of the heart to secure blood, requires\r\nconsiderable practice to be successful without causing the death of the\r\nanimal at once through internal hemorrhage. In _subdural_ injections\r\ninto the cranial cavity it is necessary to trephine the skull first,\r\nwhile such injections into the spinal canal may be accomplished between\r\nthe vertebra with needles longer and stronger than the usual hypodermic\r\nneedle. Occasionally animals are caused to _inhale_ the organisms, or\r\nare _fed_ cultures mixed with the feed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECURING AND TRANSPORTING MATERIAL FROM ANIMALS FOR BACTERIOLOGICAL\r\nEXAMINATION.\r\n\r\nIf the site of the lesion is readily accessible from the exterior,\r\nmaterial from the _living animal_ should be collected with sterile\r\ninstruments and kept in sterile utensils until the necessary tests can\r\nbe made. Testing should be done on material as soon after collection\r\nas possible, in all cases, to avoid the effects of “decomposition”\r\nbacteria.\r\n\r\nIf the blood is to be investigated it may be aspirated from a\r\nperipheral vein with a sterile hypodermic syringe of appropriate size\r\nor allowed to flow through a sterile canula into sterile receptacles.\r\nThe site of the puncture should be shaved and disinfected before the\r\ninstrument is introduced.\r\n\r\nDischarges of whatever kind should likewise be collected in sterile\r\nreceptacles and examined as soon as may be.\r\n\r\nIf internal organs are to be examined it is best to kill a moribund\r\nanimal than to wait for death, since after death, and in severe\r\ninfections even sometimes before, the tissues are rapidly invaded by\r\nsaprophytic bacteria from the alimentary and respiratory tracts which\r\ncomplicate greatly the isolation of the specific organism. Hence the\r\nsearch for specific bacteria in carcasses or organs several hours after\r\ndeath is frequently negative. Animal inoculation with such material is\r\nvery often followed by sepsis or septicemia in a few hours, so that the\r\nspecific organism has no opportunity to manifest itself.\r\n\r\nIn securing material for cultures from internal organs it is a good\r\nplan to burn the surface of the organ with a gas or alcohol flame, or\r\nto sear it with a hot instrument to kill surface organisms, then make\r\nthe incision or puncture through the burned area and secure material\r\nfrom the interior of the organ. Such punctures made with a stiff\r\nplatinum needle frequently give pure cultures of the organism sought.\r\nSlides may be made from such material and culture media inoculated at\r\nonce.\r\n\r\nSince a bacteriological diagnosis depends most commonly on growing the\r\norganisms, it is evident that material sent for examination must _never\r\nbe treated with an antiseptic or preservative_. If decomposition is to\r\nbe feared the only safe procedure is to _pack the material in ice_ and\r\nforward in this way.\r\n\r\n_Tuberculous material from the parenchyma_ of internal organs may be\r\nforwarded in a preservative (not _formalin_, since this makes it very\r\ndifficult to stain the bacteria) as _in this special_ case a very\r\npositive diagnosis may be made by staining alone. Even here it is\r\nbetter to _pack in ice_ in order that the diagnosis by staining may be\r\nconfirmed by inoculating the living organisms into guinea-pigs.\r\n\r\nIn the case of material _from a rabid animal_ and many protozoal\r\ndiseases the rule against preservatives is not absolute, since staining\r\nis a reliable diagnostic means. Even in these cases it is often\r\ndesirable to inoculate animals, hence, as before stated, it is best to\r\nmake it a uniform practice to _pack material for examination in ice and\r\nuse no preservatives_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART IV.\r\n\r\nGENERAL PATHOGENIC BACTERIOLOGY.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nPathogenic Bacteriology treats of the unicellular microörganisms which\r\nare responsible for disease conditions, _i.e._, pathological changes\r\nin other organisms. Hence not only are bacteria considered, but also\r\nother low vegetable forms, as yeasts and molds, likewise protozoa in\r\nso far as they may be pathogenic. For this reason the term pathogenic\r\n“Microbiology” has been introduced to include all these organisms. It\r\nis largely for the reason that the methods devised for the study of\r\nbacteria have been applied to the investigation of other microörganisms\r\nthat the term “bacteriology” was extended to cover the entire field.\r\nThe general discussion in this chapter is intended to include,\r\ntherefore, microörganisms of whatever kind pathogenic to animals.\r\n\r\nThe term pathogenic as applied to an organism must be understood in a\r\npurely _relative_ sense, since there is no single organism that can\r\ncause disease in all of a certain class, but each is limited to a more\r\nor less narrow range. Some form of tuberculosis attacks nearly all\r\nvertebrates, but no other classes of animals and no plants. Lockjaw or\r\ntetanus attacks most mammals, but not any other vertebrates naturally.\r\nTyphoid fever affects human beings; hog cholera, swine, etc. This point\r\nis more fully discussed in Chapter XXIII but can not be too greatly\r\ninsisted upon.\r\n\r\n    “The greatest enemy to mankind is man.”\r\n\r\nExceptions to this statement do occur and are important and must be\r\nconsidered in efforts to protect completely human beings from disease\r\n(tuberculosis from cattle, glanders from horses, poisoning from spoiled\r\ncanned goods, anthrax from hair, hides, wool, of animals dead of the\r\ndisease), but the most common human diseases are derived from other\r\nhuman beings directly or indirectly.\r\n\r\nDiseases which are due to unicellular pathogenic microörganisms are\r\ncalled _infectious_ diseases, while if such diseases are transmitted\r\nunder natural conditions from organism to organism they are spoken of\r\nas _contagious_ diseases. Most infectious diseases are contagious but\r\nnot all. Tetanus is a good illustration of a non-contagious infectious\r\ndisease. There are very few such diseases.\r\n\r\nWhen a unicellular microörganism gains entrance into the body and\r\nbrings about any pathological changes there, the result is an\r\n_infection_. Undoubtedly many pathogenic organisms get into the body\r\nbut never manifest their presence by causing disease conditions, hence\r\ndo not cause an infection. It is the pathological conditions which\r\nresult that constitute the infection, and not the mere _invasion_.\r\n\r\nThe time that elapses between the entrance of the organism and the\r\nappearance of symptoms is called the _period of incubation_ and varies\r\ngreatly in different diseases.\r\n\r\nThe term _infestation_ is used to denote pathological conditions due to\r\n_multicellular_ parasites. Thus an animal is _infested_ (not infected)\r\nwith tapeworms, roundworms, lice, mites, etc. Many of these conditions,\r\nprobably all, are contagious, _i.e._, transmissable naturally from\r\nanimal to animal. The word _contagious_ has been used in a variety\r\nof ways to mean _communicated by direct contact_, communicated by a\r\nliving something (_contagium_) that might be carried to a distance\r\nand finally _communicable_ in any manner, transmissable. The agency\r\nof transmission may be very roundabout--as through a _special tick_\r\nin Texas fever, a _mosquito_ in malaria, etc.,--or by direct personal\r\ncontact, as generally in venereal diseases. After all, though exactness\r\nis necessary, it is better to learn all possible about the _means of\r\ntransmission of diseases_, than quibble as to the terms to be used.\r\n\r\nAn infectious disease may be _acute_ or _chronic_. An acute infection\r\nis one which runs for a relatively short time and is “self-limited,”\r\nso-called, _i.e._, the organisms cease to manifest their presence after\r\na time. In some acute infections the time is very short--German measles\r\nusually runs five or six days. Typhoid fever may continue eight to\r\nten weeks, sometimes longer, yet it is an acute infectious disease.\r\nIt is not so much the time as the fact of _self-limitation_ that\r\ncharacterizes acute infections.\r\n\r\nIn chronic infections there is little or no evidence of limitation of\r\nthe progress of the disease which may continue for years. Tuberculosis\r\nis usually chronic. Leprosy in man is practically always so. Glanders\r\nin horses is most commonly chronic; in mules and in man it is more apt\r\nto be acute.\r\n\r\nMany infections begin acutely and later change to the chronic type.\r\nSyphilis in man is a good illustration.\r\n\r\nThe differences between acute and chronic infections are partly due\r\nto the nature of the organism, partly to the number of organisms\r\nintroduced and the point of their introduction and partly to the\r\nresistance of the animal infected.\r\n\r\nAn infectious disease is said to be _specific_ when one kind of\r\norganism is responsible for its manifestations--as diphtheria due\r\nto the _Corynebacterium diphtheriæ_, lockjaw due to _Clostridium\r\ntetani_, Texas fever due to the _Piroplasma bigeminum_, etc. It is\r\n_non-specific_ when it may be due to a variety of organisms, as\r\n_enteritis_ (generally), _bronchopneumonia_, _wound infections_.\r\n\r\nHenle, as early as 1840, stated certain principles that must be\r\nestablished before a given organism can be accepted as the cause of a\r\nspecific disease. These were afterward restated by Koch, and have come\r\nto be known as “Koch’s postulates.” They may be stated as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The given organism must be found in all cases of the disease in\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\n2. No other organism must be found in all cases.\r\n\r\n3. The organism must, when obtained in pure culture, reproduce the\r\ndisease in susceptible animals.\r\n\r\n4. It must be recovered from such animals in pure culture and this\r\nculture likewise reproduce the disease.\r\n\r\nThese postulates have not been fully met with reference to any disease,\r\nbut the principles embodied have been applied as far as possible\r\nin all those infections which we recognize as specific, and whose\r\ncausative agent is accepted. In many diseases recognized as infectious\r\nand contagious no organism has been found which is regarded as the\r\nspecific cause. In some of these the organism appears to be too small\r\nto be seen with the highest powers of the microscope, hence they are\r\ncalled “_ultramicroscopic_” organisms. Because these agents pass\r\nthrough the finest bacterial filters, they are also frequently called\r\n“_filterable_.” The term “_virus_” or “_filterable virus_” is likewise\r\napplied to these “ultramicroscopic” and “filterable” agents.\r\n\r\nThe term _primary infection_ is sometimes applied to the first\r\nmanifestation of a disease, either specific or non-specific, while\r\n_secondary_ refers to later developments. For example, a _secondary_\r\ngeneral infection may follow a _primary_ wound infection, or _primary_\r\nlung tuberculosis be followed by _secondary_ generalized tuberculosis,\r\nor _primary_ typhoid fever by a _secondary_ typhoid pneumonia. The\r\nterms _primary_ and _secondary_ are also used where the body is\r\ninvaded by one kind of an organism and later on by another kind; thus\r\na _primary_ measles may be followed by _secondary_ infection of the\r\nmiddle ear, or a _primary_ influenza may be followed by a _secondary_\r\npneumonia, or a _primary_ scarlet fever by a _secondary_ nephritis\r\n(inflammation of the kidney). Where several organisms seem to be\r\nassociated simultaneously in causing the condition then the term _mixed\r\ninfection_ is used--in severe diphtheria, streptococci are commonly\r\nassociated with the _Corynebacterium diphtheriæ_. In many cases of\r\nhog-cholera, mixed infections in the lungs and in the intestines are\r\ncommon. Wound infections are usually _mixed_. _Auto-infection_ refers\r\nto those conditions in which an organism commonly present in or on the\r\nbody in a latent or harmless condition gives rise to an infectious\r\nprocess. If the _Bacterium coli_ normal to the intestine escapes into\r\nthe peritoneal cavity, or passes into the bladder, a severe peritonitis\r\nor cystitis, respectively, is apt to result. “Boils” and “pimples”\r\nare frequently autoinfections. Such infections are also spoken of as\r\n_endogenous_ to distinguish them from those due to the entrance of\r\norganisms from without--_exogenous_ infections. _Relapses_ are usually\r\ninstances of autoinfection.\r\n\r\nThose types of _secondary infection_ where the infecting agent is\r\ntransferred from one disease focus to another or several other points\r\nand sets up the infection there are sometimes called _metastases_. Such\r\nare the transfer of tubercle bacilli from lung to intestine, spleen,\r\netc., the formation of abscesses in internal organs following a primary\r\nsurface abscess, the appearance of glanders nodules throughout various\r\norgans following pulmonary glanders, etc.\r\n\r\nThe characteristic of a pathogenic microörganism which indicates\r\nits ability to cause disease is called its _virulence_. If slightly\r\nvirulent, the effect is slight; if highly virulent, the effect is\r\nsevere, and may be fatal.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the characteristic of the host which indicates\r\nits capacity for infection is called _susceptibility_. If slightly\r\nsusceptible, infection is slight, if highly susceptible, the infection\r\nis severe.\r\n\r\nEvidently the degree of infection is dependent in large measure on\r\nthe relation between the _virulence_ of the invading organism and the\r\n_susceptibility_ of the host. High virulence and great susceptibility\r\nmean a severe infection; low virulence and little susceptibility a\r\nslight infection; while high virulence and little susceptibility or\r\nlow virulence and great susceptibility might mean a moderate infection\r\nvarying in either direction. Other factors influencing the degree of\r\ninfection are the number of organisms introduced, the point where they\r\nare introduced and various conditions. These will be discussed in\r\nanother connection (Chapter XXV).\r\n\r\nThe study of pathogenic bacteriology includes the thorough study\r\nof the individual organisms according to the methods already given\r\n(Chapters XVIII-XXI) as an aid to diagnosis and subsequent treatment,\r\nbacteriological or other, in a given disease. Of far greater\r\nimportance than the _treatment_, which in most infectious diseases\r\nis not specific, is the _prevention_ and _ultimate eradication_ of\r\nall infectious diseases. To accomplish these objects involves further\r\na study of the _conditions under which pathogenic organisms exist\r\noutside the body_, _the paths of entrance into and elimination from\r\nthe body_ and those _agencies within the body itself_ which make it\r\n_less susceptible to infection or overcome the infective agent after\r\nits introduction_. That condition of the body itself which prevents any\r\nmanifestation of a virulent pathogenic organism after it has been once\r\nintroduced is spoken of as _immunity_ in the modern sense. Immunity is\r\nthus the opposite of susceptibility and may exist in varying degrees.\r\n\r\nThat scientists are and have been for some years in possession of\r\nsufficient knowledge to permit of the prevention and eradication\r\nof most, if not all, of our infectious diseases can scarcely be\r\nquestioned. The practical application of this knowledge presents\r\nmany difficulties, the chief of which is the absence of a public\r\nsufficiently enlightened to permit the expenditure of the necessary\r\nfunds. Time and educative effort alone can surmount this difficulty. It\r\nwill probably be years yet, but it will certainly be accomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII.\r\n\r\nPATHOGENIC BACTERIA OUTSIDE THE BODY.\r\n\r\n\r\nPathogenic bacteria may exist outside the body of the host under a\r\nvariety of conditions as follows:\r\n\r\n  I. In or on inanimate objects or material.\r\n    (_a_) As true saprophytes.\r\n    (_b_) As facultative saprophytes.\r\n    (_c_) Though obligate parasites, they exist in a latent\r\n        state.\r\n  II. In or on other animals, or products from them:\r\n    A. Susceptible to the disease.\r\n      (_a_) Sick themselves.\r\n        (As far as human beings are concerned these are\r\n        mainly:\r\n        1. Other human beings for most diseases.\r\n        2. Rats for plague.\r\n        3. Dogs for rabies.\r\n        4. Horses for glanders.\r\n        5. Cattle, swine, parrots for tuberculosis).\r\n      (_b_) Recovered from illness.\r\n      (_c_) Never sick but “carriers.”\r\n    B. Not susceptible.\r\n      (_d_) Accidental carriers.\r\n      (_e_) Serving as necessary intermediate hosts for certain\r\n        stages of the parasite--this applies to _protozoal_\r\n        diseases only, as yet.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\n(_a_) The bacilli of tetanus, malignant edema and the organisms of\r\n“gas gangrene” are widely distributed. There is no evidence that their\r\nentrance into the body is at all necessary for the continuation of\r\ntheir life processes, or that one case of either of these diseases\r\never has any connection with any other case; they are true saprophytes.\r\nManifestly it would be futile to attempt to prevent or eradicate such\r\ndiseases by attacking the organism in its natural habitat. _Clostridium\r\nbotulinum_, which causes a type of food poisoning in man, does not even\r\nmultiply in the body, but the disease symptoms are due to a soluble\r\ntoxin which is produced during its growth outside the body.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Organisms like the bacterium of anthrax and the bacillus of\r\nblack-leg from their local occurrence seem to be distributed from\r\nanimals infected, though capable of a saprophytic existence outside the\r\nbody for years. These can no more be attacked during their saprophytic\r\nexistence than those just mentioned. Doubtless in warm seasons of the\r\nyear and in the tropics other organisms pathogenic to animals may live\r\nand multiply in water or in damp soil where conditions are favorable,\r\njust as the cholera organism in India, and occasionally the typhoid\r\nbacillus in temperate climates do.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Most pathogenic organisms, however, when they are thrown off\r\nfrom the bodies of animals, remain quiescent, do not multiply, in fact\r\nalways tend to die out from lack of all that is implied in a “favorable\r\nenvironment,” food, moisture, temperature, light, etc. Disinfection is\r\nsometimes effective in this class of diseases in preventing new cases.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. A.\r\n\r\n(_a_) The most common infectious diseases of animals are transmitted\r\nmore or less directly from other animals of the same species. Human\r\nbeings get nearly all their diseases from other human beings who are\r\nsick; horses, from other horses; cattle, from other cattle; swine,\r\nfrom swine, etc. Occasionally transmission from one species to another\r\noccurs. Tuberculosis of swine most frequently results from feeding\r\nthem milk of tuberculous cattle or from their eating the droppings of\r\nsuch cattle. Human beings occasionally contract anthrax from wool,\r\nhair and hides of animals dead of the disease or from postmortems\r\non such animals; glanders from horses; tuberculosis (in children)\r\nfrom tuberculous milk; bubonic plague from rats; rabies practically\r\nalways from the bites of dogs and other rabid animals, etc. The\r\nmode of limiting this class of diseases is evidently to isolate the\r\nsick, disinfect their discharges and their _immediate_ surroundings,\r\nsterilize such products as must be handled or used, kill lower animals\r\nthat are dangerous, and disinfect, bury properly, or destroy their\r\ncarcasses.\r\n\r\nClasses of the sick that are especially dangerous for the spread of\r\ndisease are the mild cases and the undetected cases. These individuals\r\ndo not come under observation and hence not under control.\r\n\r\n(_b_) This class of carriers offers a difficult problem in the\r\nprevention of infectious diseases since they may continue to give off\r\nthe organisms indefinitely and thus infect others. Typhoid carriers\r\nhave been known to do so for fifty-five years. Cholera, diphtheria,\r\nmeningitis and other carriers are well known in human practice.\r\nCarriers among animals have not been so frequently demonstrated,\r\nbut there is every reason for thinking that hog-cholera, distemper,\r\nroup, influenza and other carriers are common. Carriers furnish the\r\nexplanation for many of the so-called “spontaneous” outbreaks of\r\ndisease among men and animals.\r\n\r\nIt is the general rule that those who are sick cease to carry the\r\norganisms on recovery and it is the occasional ones who do not that are\r\nthe exceptions. In those diseases in which the organism is known it\r\ncan be determined by examination of the patient or his discharges how\r\nlong he continues to give off the causative agent. In those in which\r\nthe cause is unknown (in human beings, the commonest and most easily\r\ntransmitted diseases, scarlet fever, measles, German measles, mumps,\r\nchicken-pox, small-pox, influenza), no such check is possible. It is\r\nnot known how long such individuals remain carriers. Hence isolation\r\nand quarantine of such convalescents is based partly on experience\r\nand partly on theory. It is highly probable that in the diseases just\r\nmentioned transmission occurs in the _early stages only_, except\r\nin small-pox and chicken-pox where the organism seems to be in the\r\npustules and transmission by means of material from these is possible,\r\nthough only by direct contact with it.\r\n\r\nThe fact that such individuals are _known to have had the disease_ is a\r\nguide for control. The methods to be used are essentially the same as\r\nfor the sick, (_a_), though obviously such human carriers are much more\r\ndifficult to deal with since they are well.\r\n\r\n(_c_) Another class of carriers is those who have never had the\r\ndisease. Such individuals are common and are very dangerous sources\r\nof infection. Many of them have _associated with the sick or with\r\nconvalescents_ and these should always be suspected of harboring the\r\norganisms. Their control differs in no way from that of class (_b_).\r\nUnfortunately a history of such association is too often not available.\r\nModern transportation and modern social habits are largely responsible\r\nfor the nearly universal distribution of this type of carrier. Their\r\ndetection is probably the largest single problem in the prevention\r\nof infectious diseases. A partial solution would be universal\r\nbacteriological examination. In our present stage of progress this is\r\nimpossible and would not detect carriers of diseases of unknown cause.\r\n\r\nThe various classes of carriers just discussed are in a large part\r\nresponsible for the continued presence of the commoner diseases\r\nthroughout the country. The difficulties in control have been\r\nmentioned. A complete solution of the problem is not yet obtained. The\r\narmy experience of the past few years in the control of infectious\r\ndiseases shows what may be done.\r\n\r\nThere is another class of carriers which might be called the “universal\r\ncarrier,” _i.e._, there are certain organisms which seem to be\r\nconstantly or almost constantly present in or on the human body. These\r\nare _micrococci_, _streptococci_ and _pneumococci_, all _Gram positive_\r\norganisms. They are ordinarily harmless parasites, but on occasion may\r\ngive rise to serious, even fatal, infection. Infected wounds, pimples,\r\nboils, “common colds,” most “sore throats,” bronchitis, pneumonia are\r\npathological conditions that come in this class. Such infections are\r\nusually autogenous. There is a constant interchange of these organisms\r\namong individuals closely associated, so that all of a group usually\r\nharbor the same type though no one individual can be called _the_\r\ncarrier. Whenever, for any reason, the resistance of an individual (see\r\nChaps. XXV et seq.) is lowered either locally or generally some of\r\nthese organisms are liable to gain a foothold and cause infection. It\r\nsometimes happens that a strain of dangerous organisms may be developed\r\nin an individual in this way which is passed around to others with its\r\nvirulence increased and thus cause an epidemic. Or, since all of the\r\ngroup are living under the same conditions the resistance of all or\r\nmany of them may be lowered from the same general cause and an epidemic\r\nresult from the organism common to all (pneumonia after measles,\r\nscarlet fever and influenza in camps). Protection of the individual is\r\nchiefly a personal question, _i.e._, by keeping up the “normal healthy\r\ntone” in all possible ways: The use of protective vaccines (Chap. XXX)\r\nappears to be advisable in such instances (colds, pneumonia after\r\nmeasles and influenza, inflammation of throat and middle ear following\r\nscarlet fever and measles). Results obtained in this country during\r\nthe recent influenza epidemic have been conflicting but on the whole\r\nappear to show that preventive vaccination against _pneumonia liable to\r\nfollow_ should be practiced.\r\n\r\nIt would seem that among groups of individuals where infection may be\r\nexpected the proper procedure would be to prepare autogenous vaccines\r\n(Chapter XXX) from members of the group and vaccinate all with the\r\nobject of protecting them.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. B.\r\n\r\n(_d_) In this class come the “accidental carriers” like flies, fleas,\r\nlice, bed-bugs, ticks, and other biting and blood-sucking insects,\r\nvultures, buzzards, foxes, rats, and carrion-eating animals generally;\r\npet animals in the household, etc. Here the animals are not susceptible\r\nto the given disease but become contaminated with the organisms\r\nand then through defilement of the food or drink or contact with\r\nindividuals or with utensils pass the organisms on to the susceptible.\r\nSome biting and blood-sucking insects transmit the organisms through\r\nbiting infected and non-infected animals successively. The spirilloses\r\nand trypanosomiases seem to be transmitted in this way, though there\r\nis evidence accumulating which may place these diseases in the next\r\nclass. Anthrax is considered in some instances to be transmitted by\r\nflies and by vultures in the southern United States. Transmission\r\nof typhoid, dysentery, cholera and other diseases by flies is well\r\nestablished in man. Why not hog-cholera from farm to farm by flies,\r\nEnglish sparrows, pigeons feeding, or by turkey buzzards? Though this\r\nwould not be easy to prove, it seems reasonable.\r\n\r\nPreventing contact of such animals with the discharges or with the\r\ncarcasses of those dead of the disease, destruction of insect carriers,\r\nscreening and prevention of fly breeding are obvious protective\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\n(_e_) In this class come certain diseases for which particular\r\ninsects are necessary for the parasite in question, so that certain\r\nstages in its life history may be passed therein. The surest means\r\nfor eradicating such diseases is the destruction of the insects\r\nconcerned. Up to the present no _bacterial_ disease is known in which\r\nthis condition exists, unless Rocky Mountain spotted fever and typhus\r\nfever shall prove to be due to bacteria. Such diseases are all due to\r\nprotozoa. Among them are Texas fever, due to _Piroplasma bigeminum_\r\nin this country which has been eradicated in entire districts by\r\ndestruction of the cattle tick (_Margaropus annulatus_).\r\n\r\nPiroplasmoses in South Africa among cattle and horses, and in other\r\ncountries are transmitted in similar ways. Probably many of the\r\ndiseases due to spirochetes and trypanosomes are likewise transmitted\r\nby _necessary_ insect intermediaries. In human medicine the eradication\r\nof yellow fever from Panama and Cuba is due to successful warfare\r\nagainst, a certain mosquito (_Stegomyia_). So the freeing of large\r\nareas in different parts of the world from _malaria_ follows the\r\ndestruction of the mosquitoes. The prevention of typhus fever and\r\nof trench fever by “delousing” methods is familiar from recent army\r\nexperience though for typhus this method has been practiced in Russia\r\nfor more than ten years to the author’s personal knowledge. The\r\ncampaign against disease in animals and man from insect sources must be\r\nconsidered as still in its infancy. The full utilization of tropical\r\nlands depends largely on the solution of this problem.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nPATHS OF ENTRANCE OF PATHOGENIC ORGANISMS,\r\n\r\nOR\r\n\r\nCHANNELS OF INFECTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A._ =The Skin.=--If the skin is healthy there is no opportunity for\r\nbacteria to penetrate it. It is protected not only by the stratified\r\nepithelium, but also in various animals, by coats of hair, wool,\r\nfeathers, etc. The secretion pressure of the healthy sweat and oil\r\nglands acts as an effective bar even to motile bacteria. Nevertheless a\r\nvery slight injury only is sufficient to give normal surface parasites\r\nand other pathogenics, accidentally or purposely brought in contact\r\nwith it, an opportunity for more rapid growth and even entrance\r\nfor general infection. Certain diseases due to higher fungi are\r\ncharacteristically “skin diseases” and rarely become general--various\r\nforms of favus, trichophyton infections, etc. A few disease organisms,\r\ntetanus, malignant edema, usually get in through the skin; others,\r\nblack-leg, anthrax, quite commonly; and those diseases transmitted\r\nby biting and blood-sucking insects, piroplasmoses, trypanosomiases,\r\nspirilloses, scarcely in any other way. Defective secretion in the skin\r\nglands from other causes, may permit lodgment and growth of bacteria\r\nin them or in the hair follicles. “Pimples” and boils in man and local\r\nabscesses occasionally in animals are illustrations. Sharp-edged and\r\nfreely bleeding wounds are less liable to be infected than contusions,\r\nragged wounds, burns, etc. The flowing blood washes out the wound and\r\nthe clotting seals it, while there is less material to be repaired\r\nby the leukocytes and they are free to care for invading organisms\r\n(phagocytosis). Pathogenic organisms, especially pus cocci, frequently\r\ngain lodgment in the _milk glands_ and cause local (mastitis) or\r\ngeneral infection.\r\n\r\n_B._ =Mucosæ directly continuous with the skin and lined with\r\nstratified epithelium= are commonly well protected thereby and by the\r\nsecretions.\r\n\r\n(_a_) The external auditory meatus is rarely the seat even of local\r\ninfection. The tympanic cavity is normally sterile, though it may\r\nbecome infected by extension through the Eustachian tube from the\r\npharynx (_otitis media_).\r\n\r\n(_b_) The conjunctiva is frequently the seat of localized, very rarely\r\nthe point of entrance for a generalized infection, except after severe\r\ninjury. Those diseases whose path of entrance is generally assumed to\r\nbe the respiratory tract (see “Lungs” below) might also be admitted\r\nthrough the eye. Material containing such organisms might get on the\r\nconjunctiva and be washed down through the lachrymal canal into the\r\nnose. Experiment has shown that bacteria may pass in this way in a\r\nfew minutes. In case masks are worn to avoid infection from patients\r\nsuffering with these diseases, the eyes should therefore be protected\r\nas well as the nose and mouth.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The nasal cavity on account of its anatomical structure retains\r\npathogenic organisms which give rise to local infections more\r\nfrequently than other mucosæ of its character. These may extend from\r\nhere to middle ear, neighboring sinuses, or along the lymph spaces of\r\nthe olfactory nerve into the cranial cavity (meningitis). Acute coryza\r\n(“colds” in man) is characteristic. Glanders, occasionally, is primary\r\nin the nose, as is probably roup in chickens, leprosy in man. The\r\nmeningococcus and the virus of poliomyelitis pass from the nose into\r\nthe cranial cavity without local lesions in the former.\r\n\r\n(_d_) The mouth cavity is ordinarily protected by its epithelium\r\nand secretions, though the injured mucosa is a common source of\r\n_actinomycosis_ infection, as well as thrush. In foot-and-mouth disease\r\nno visible lesions seem necessary to permit the localization of the\r\nunknown infective agent.\r\n\r\n(_e_) The tonsils afford a ready point of entrance for ever-present\r\n_micrococci_ and _streptococci_ whenever occasion offers (follicular\r\ntonsillitis, “quinsy”), and articular rheumatism is not an uncommon\r\nsequel. The diphtheria bacillus characteristically seeks these\r\nstructures for its development. Tubercle and anthrax organisms\r\noccasionally enter here.\r\n\r\n(_f_) The pharynx is the seat of localized infection as in\r\n_micrococcal_, _streptococcal_ and diphtherial “sore throat” in human\r\nbeings, but both it and the esophagus are rarely infected in animals\r\nexcept as the result of injury.\r\n\r\n(_g_) The external genitalia are the usual points of entrance for\r\nthe venereal organisms in man (gonococcus, _Treponema pallidum_, and\r\nDucrey’s bacillus). The bacillus of contagious abortion and probably\r\nthe trypanosome of dourine are commonly introduced through these\r\nchannels in animals.\r\n\r\n_C._ =Lungs.=--The varied types of pneumonia due to many different\r\norganisms (tubercle, glanders, influenza, plague bacilli, pneumococcus,\r\nstreptococcus, micrococcus and many others) show how frequently these\r\norgans are the seat of a localized infection, which may or may not be\r\ngeneral. Whether the lungs are the actual point of entrance in these\r\ncases is a question which is much discussed at the present time,\r\nparticularly with reference to tuberculosis. The mucous secretion\r\nof the respiratory tract tends to catch incoming bacteria and other\r\nsmall particles and the ciliary movement along bronchial tubes and\r\ntrachea tends to carry such material out. “Foreign body pneumonia”\r\nshows clinically, and many observers have shown experimentally that\r\nmicroörganisms may reach the alveoli even though the exchange of\r\nair between them and the bronchioles and larger bronchi takes place\r\nordinarily only by diffusion. The presence of carbon particles in the\r\nwalls of the alveoli in older animals and human beings and in those\r\nthat breathe dusty air for long periods indicates strongly, though it\r\ndoes not prove absolutely, that these came in with inspired air. On the\r\nother hand, experiment has shown that tubercle bacilli introduced into\r\nthe intestine may appear in the lungs and cause disease there and not\r\nin the intestine. It is probably safe to assume that in those diseases\r\nwhich are transmitted most readily through close association though\r\nnot necessarily actual contact, the commonest path is through the\r\nrespiratory tract, which may or may not show lesions (smallpox, scarlet\r\nfever, measles, chicken-pox, whooping-cough, pneumonic plague in man,\r\nlobar and bronchopneumonias and influenza in man and animals, some\r\ncases of glanders and tuberculosis). On the other hand, the fact that\r\nthe _Bacterium typhosum_ and _Bacterium coli_ may cause pneumonia when\r\nthey evidently have reached the lung from the intestinal tract, and the\r\nexperimental evidence of lung tuberculosis above mentioned show that\r\nthis route cannot be excluded in inflammations of the lung.\r\n\r\n_D._ =Alimentary Tract.=--The alimentary tract affords the ordinary\r\npath of entrance for the causal microbes of many of the diseases of\r\nanimals and man, since they are carried into the body most commonly and\r\nmost abundantly in the food and drink.\r\n\r\n(_a_) The stomach is rarely the seat of local infection, even in\r\nruminants, except as the result of trauma. The character of the\r\nepithelium in the rumen, reticulum and omasum in ruminants, the\r\nhydrochloric acid in the abomasum and in the stomachs of animals\r\ngenerally are usually sufficient protection. Occasionally anthrax\r\n“pustules” develop in the gastric mucosa. (The author saw nine such\r\npustules in a case of anthrax in a man.)\r\n\r\n(_b_) The intestines are frequently the seat of localized infections,\r\nas various “choleras” and “dysenteries” in men and many animals,\r\nanthrax, tuberculosis, Johne’s disease. Here doubtless enter the\r\norganisms causing “hemorrhagic septicemias” in many classes of animals,\r\nand numerous others. These various organisms must have passed through\r\nthe stomach and the question at once arises, why did the HCl not\r\ndestroy them? It must be remembered that the acid is present only\r\nduring stomach digestion, and that liquids taken on an “empty stomach”\r\npass through rapidly and any organisms present are not subjected to\r\nthe action of the acid. Also spores generally resist the acid. Other\r\norganisms may pass through the stomach within masses of undigested\r\nfood. The fact that digestion is going on in the stomach of ruminants\r\npractically all the time may explain the relative freedom of _adult_\r\nanimals of this class from “choleras” and “dysenteries.”\r\n\r\n\r\nMECHANISM OF ENTRANCE OF ORGANISMS.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapters statements have been made that “bacteria\r\nenter” at various places or they “pass through” different mucous\r\nmembranes, skin, etc. Strictly speaking such statements are\r\nincorrect--bacteria do not “enter” or “pass through” of themselves.\r\nIt is true that some of the intestinal organisms are motile, but most\r\nof the bacteria which are pathogenic are non-motile. Even the motile\r\nones can not make their way against fluids secreted or excreted on free\r\nsurfaces. Bacteria cannot pass by diffusion through membranes since\r\nthey are finite particles and not in solution.\r\n\r\nIn the case of penetrating wounds bacteria may be carried mechanically\r\ninto the tissues, but this is exceptional in most infections. Also\r\nafter gaining lodgment they may gradually grow through by destroying\r\ntissue as they grow, but this is a minor factor. Evidently, there\r\nmust be some mechanism by which they _are carried_ through. The known\r\nmechanisms for this in the body are ameboid cells, especially the\r\nphagocytes. It is most probable that these are the chief agents in\r\ngetting bacteria into the tissues through various free surfaces. The\r\nphagocytes engulf bacteria, carry them into the tissues and either\r\ndestroy them, are destroyed by them, or may disgorge or excrete them\r\nfree in the tissues or in the blood.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISSEMINATION OF ORGANISMS.\r\n\r\nDissemination of organisms within the tissues occurs either through\r\nthe lymph channels or the bloodvessels or both. If through the lymph\r\nvessels only it is usually much more restricted in extent, or much more\r\nslowly disseminated, while blood dissemination is characterized by the\r\nnumber of organs involved simultaneously.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATHS OF ELIMINATION OF PATHOGENIC MICRÖORGANISMS.\r\n\r\nI. Directly from the point, of injury. This is true in infected\r\nwounds open to the surface, skin glanders (farcy), black-leg,\r\nsurface anthrax, exanthemata in man and animals (scarlet fever (?),\r\nmeasles (?), smallpox; hog erysipelas, foot-and-mouth disease):\r\nalso in case of disease of mucous membranes continuous with the\r\nskin--from nasal discharges (glanders), saliva (foot-and-mouth\r\ndisease), material coughed or sneezed out (tuberculosis, influenza,\r\npneumonias), urethral and vaginal discharges (gonorrhea and syphilis\r\nin man, contagious abortion and dourine in animals), intestinal\r\ndischarges (typhoid fever, “choleras,” “dysenteries,” anthrax,\r\ntuberculosis, Johne’s disease). Material from nose, mouth and lungs\r\nmay be swallowed and the organisms passed out through the intestines.\r\n\r\nII. Indirectly through the secretions and the excretions where the\r\ninternal organs are involved. The _saliva_ of rabid animals contains\r\nthe ultramicroscopic virus of rabies (the sympathetic ganglia\r\nwithin the salivary glands, and pancreas also, are affected in this\r\ndisease as well as the cells of the central nervous system). The\r\n_gall-bladder_ in man is known to harbor colon and typhoid bacilli,\r\nas that of hog-cholera hogs does the virus of this disease. It may\r\nharbor analogous organisms in other animals, though such knowledge\r\nis scanty. The _kidneys_ have been shown experimentally to excrete\r\ncertain organisms introduced into the circulation within a few minutes\r\n(micrococci, colon and typhoid bacilli, anthrax). Typhoid bacilli occur\r\nin the urine of typhoid-fever patients in about 25 per cent. of all\r\ncases and the urine of hogs with hog cholera is highly virulent. Most\r\nobservers are of the opinion, however, that under natural conditions\r\nthe kidneys do not excrete bacteria unless they themselves are infected.\r\n\r\nThe _milk_ both of tuberculous cattle and tuberculous women has been\r\nshown to contain tubercle bacilli _even when the mammary glands are not\r\ninvolved_. Doubtless such bacteria are carried through the walls of the\r\nsecreting tubules or of the smaller ducts by phagocytes and are then\r\nset free in the milk.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIFICITY OF LOCATION OF INFECTIVE ORGANISMS.\r\n\r\nIt is readily apparent that certain disease organisms tend to locate\r\nthemselves in definite regions and the question arises, Is this due\r\nto any specific relationship between organism and tissue or not?\r\nDiphtheria in man usually attacks the tonsils first, gonorrhea and\r\nsyphilis the external genitals, tuberculosis the lung, “choleras” the\r\nsmall intestine, “dysenteries” the large intestine, influenza the\r\nlungs. In these cases the explanation is probably that the points\r\nattacked are the places where the organism is most commonly carried,\r\nwith no specific relationship, since all of these organisms (Asiatic\r\ncholera excepted) also produce lesions in other parts of the body _when\r\nthey reach them_. On the other hand, the virus of hydrophobia attacks\r\nnerve cells, leprosy frequently singles out nerves, glanders bacilli\r\nintroduced into the abdominal cavity of a young male guinea-pig cause\r\nan inflammation of the testicle, malarial parasites and piroplasms\r\nattack the red blood corpuscles, etc. In fact, most _pathogenic\r\nprotozoa_ are specific in their localization either in certain tissue\r\ncells or in the blood or lymph. In these cases there is apparently a\r\nreal chemical relationship, as there is also between the _toxins_ of\r\nbacteria and certain tissue cells (tetanus toxin and nerve cells).\r\nWhether “chemotherapy” will ever profit from a knowledge of such\r\nchemical relationships remains to be developed. It appears that a\r\nsearch for these specific chemical substances with the object of\r\ncombining poisons with them so that the organisms might in this way be\r\ndestroyed, would be a profitable line of research.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nIMMUNITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nImmunity, as has already been stated, implies such a condition of the\r\nbody that pathogenic organisms after they have been introduced are\r\nincapable of manifesting themselves, and are unable to cause disease.\r\nThe word has come to have a more specific meaning than resistance in\r\nmany instances, in other cases the terms are used synonymously. It is\r\nthe opposite of susceptibility. The term must be understood always in a\r\nrelative sense, since no animal is immune to all pathogenic organisms,\r\nand conceivably not entirely so to anyone, because there is no question\r\nthat a sufficient number of bacteria of any kind might be injected\r\ninto the circulation to kill an animal, even though it did it purely\r\nmechanically.\r\n\r\nImmunity may be considered with reference to a single individual or to\r\nentire divisions of the organic world, with all grades between. Thus\r\nplants are immune to the diseases affecting animals; invertebrates to\r\nvertebrate diseases; cold-blooded animals to those of warm blood; man\r\nis immune to most of the diseases affecting other mammals; the rat to\r\nanthrax, which affects other rodents and most mammals; the well-known\r\nrace of Algerian sheep is likewise immune to anthrax while other sheep\r\nare susceptible; the negro appears more resistant to yellow fever than\r\nthe white; some few individuals in a herd of hogs always escape an\r\nepizoötic of hog cholera, etc.\r\n\r\nImmunity within a given species is modified by a number of\r\nfactors--age, state of nutrition, extremes of heat or cold, fatigue,\r\nexcesses of any kind, in fact, anything which tends to lower the\r\n“normal healthy tone” of an animal also tends to lower its resistance.\r\nChildren appear more susceptible to scarlet fever, measles,\r\nwhooping-cough, etc., than adults; young cattle more frequently have\r\nblack-leg than older ones (these apparently greater susceptibilities\r\nmay be due in part to the fact that most of the older individuals\r\nhave had the diseases when young and are immune for this reason).\r\nAnimals weakened by hunger or thirst succumb to infection more readily.\r\nFrogs and chickens are immune to tetanus, but if the former be put\r\nin water and warmed up to and kept, at about 37°, and the latter be\r\nchilled for several hours in ice-water, then each may be infected.\r\nPneumonia frequently follows exposure to cold. The immune rat may\r\nbe given anthrax if first he is made to run in a “squirrel cage”\r\nuntil exhausted. Alcoholics are far less resistant to infection than\r\ntemperate individuals. “Worry,” mental anguish, tend to predispose to\r\ninfection.\r\n\r\nThe following outlines summarize the different, classifications of\r\nimmunity so far as mammals are concerned for the purposes of discussion.\r\n\r\nImmunity.\r\n\r\n            {              {1. Inherited through\r\n            {              {   the germ cell or cells.\r\n            {              {                {(_a_) By having the\r\n            {A. Congenital {2.

Introduction of the organism or its products.\r\n               2. Introduction of the blood serum of an immune animal.\r\n\r\nImmunity.\r\n\r\n I. Active--due to the introduction of the organism or due to the\r\n    introduction of the products of the organism.\r\n      A. Naturally by having the disease.\r\n      B. Artificially.\r\n        1. By introducing the organism:\r\n                                    {1. Passage through another animal.\r\n                                    {2. Drying.\r\n          (_a_) Alive and virulent. {3.

By introducing the products of the organism.\r\n\r\n II. Passive--due to the introduction of the blood serum of an actively\r\n     immunized animal.\r\n\r\nImmunity present in an animal and not due to human interference is to\r\nbe regarded as _natural_ immunity, while if brought about by man’s\r\neffort it is considered _artificial_. Those cases of natural immunity\r\nmentioned above which are common to divisions, classes, orders,\r\nfamilies, species or races of organisms and to those few individuals\r\nwhere no special cause is discoverable, must be regarded as instances\r\nof true _inheritance_ through the germ cell as other characteristics\r\nare. All other kinds of immunity are _acquired_. Occasionally young are\r\nborn with every evidence that they have had a disease _in utero_ and\r\nare thereafter as immune as though the attack had occurred after birth\r\n(“small-pox babies,” “hog-cholera pigs”). Experiment has shown that\r\nimmune substances may pass from the blood of the mother to the fetus\r\n_in utero_ and the young be immune for a time after birth (tetanus).\r\nThis is of no practical value as yet. It is a familiar fact that with\r\nmost infectious diseases recovery from one attack confers a more or\r\nless lasting immunity, though there are marked exceptions.\r\n\r\n=Active Immunity.=--By active immunity is meant that which is due\r\nto the actual introduction of the organism, or in some cases of its\r\nproducts. The term active is used because the body cells of the animal\r\nimmunized perform the real work of bringing about the immunity as\r\nwill be discussed later. In _passive_ immunity the blood serum of an\r\nactively immunized animal is introduced into a second animal, which\r\nthereupon becomes immune, though its cells are not concerned in the\r\nprocess. The animal is _passive_, just as a test-tube, in which a\r\nreaction takes place, plays no other part than that of a passive\r\ncontainer for the reagents.\r\n\r\nIn _active_ immunity the organism may be introduced in what is to\r\nbe considered a natural manner, as when an animal becomes infected,\r\nhas a disease, without human interference. Or the organism may be\r\npurposely introduced to bring about the immunity. For certain purposes\r\nthe introduction of the products of the organism (toxins) is used to\r\nbring about active immunity (preparation of diphtheria and tetanus\r\nantitoxin from the horse). The method of producing active immunity by\r\nthe artificial introduction of the organism is called _vaccination_,\r\nand a _vaccine_ must therefore contain the organism. _Vaccines_ for\r\n_bacterial_ diseases are frequently called _bacterins_. The use of\r\nthe blood serum of an immunized animal to confer passive immunity on\r\na second animal is properly called _serum therapy_, and the serum so\r\nused is spoken of as an _antiserum_, though the latter word is also\r\nused to denote any serum containing any kind of an antibody (Chapters\r\nXXVII-XXXI). In a few instances both the organism and an antiserum are\r\nused to cause both active and passive immunity (_serum-simultaneous\r\nmethod_ in immunizing against hog cholera).\r\n\r\nIn producing active immunity the organism may be introduced (_a_)\r\n_alive and virulent_, but in very small doses, or in combination with\r\nan immune serum, as just mentioned for hog cholera. The introduction\r\nof the live virulent organism alone is done only experimentally as\r\nyet, as it is obviously too dangerous to do in practice, except under\r\nthe strictest control (introduction of a _single tubercle_ bacillus,\r\nfollowed by gradually increasing numbers--Barber and Webb). More\r\ncommonly the organisms are introduced (_b_) alive but with their\r\n_virulence reduced_ (“attenuated”) in one of several ways: (1) By\r\npassing the organism through another animal as is the case with\r\n_smallpox vaccine_ derived from a calf or heifer. This method was\r\nfirst introduced by Jenner in 1795 and was the first practical means\r\nof preventing disease by _vaccination_. This word was used because\r\nmaterial was derived from a cow--Latin _vacca_. (2) By drying the\r\norganism, as is done in the preparation of the vaccine for the _Pasteur\r\ntreatment of rabies_, where the spinal cords of rabbits are dried for\r\nvarying lengths of time--one to four days, Russian method, one to three\r\ndays, German method, longer in this country. (It is probable that the\r\npassage of the “fixed virus” through the rabbit is as important in this\r\nprocedure as the drying, since it is doubtful if the “fixed virus” is\r\npathogenic for man.) It would be more correct to speak of this as a\r\n_preventive vaccination against rabies_, since the latter is one of the\r\nfew diseases which is not amenable to _treatment_. The patient always\r\ndies if the disease develops. (3) The organism may be attenuated by\r\ngrowing at a temperature above the normal. This is the method used in\r\npreparing _anthrax vaccine_ as done by Pasteur originally. (4) Instead\r\nof growing at a higher temperature the culture may be heated in such\r\na way that it is not killed but merely weakened. _Black-leg_ vaccines\r\nare made by this method. (5) Chemicals are sometimes added to attenuate\r\nthe organisms, as was formerly done in the preparation of black-leg\r\nvaccine by Kruse’s method in Germany. The use of toxin-antitoxin\r\nmixtures in immunizing against diphtheria and in the preparation\r\nof diphtheria antitoxin from horses is an application of the same\r\nprinciple, though here it is the _product_ of the organism and not the\r\norganism whose action is weakened. (6) Within the past few years the\r\nworkers in the Pasteur Institute in Paris have been experimenting with\r\nvaccines prepared by treating living virulent bacteria with antisera\r\n(“sensitizing them”) so that they are no longer capable of causing\r\nthe disease when introduced, but do cause the production of an active\r\nimmunity. The method has been used with typhoid fever bacilli in man\r\nand seems to be successful. It remains to be tried out further before\r\nits worth is demonstrated (the procedure is more complicated and the\r\nchance for infection apparently much greater than by the use of killed\r\ncultures). The term _sero-bacterins_ is used by manufacturers in this\r\ncountry to designate such bacterial vaccines. (7) Growing on artificial\r\nculture media reduces the virulence of most organisms after a longer\r\nor shorter time. This method has been tried with many organisms in the\r\nlaboratory, but is not now used in practice. The difficulties are that\r\nthe attenuation is very uncertain and that the organisms tend to regain\r\ntheir virulence when introduced into the body.\r\n\r\nIn producing active immunity against many bacterial diseases the\r\norganisms are introduced (_c_) dead. They are killed by heat or by\r\nchemicals, or by using both methods (Chapter XXX).\r\n\r\nWhen the products of an organism are introduced the resulting immunity\r\nis against the products only and not against the organism. If the\r\norganism itself is introduced there results an immunity against it\r\nand in some cases also against the products, though the latter does\r\nnot necessarily follow. Hence the immunity may be _antibacterial_ or\r\n_antitoxic_ or both.\r\n\r\nInvestigation as to the causes of immunity and the various methods by\r\nwhich it is produced has not resulted in the discovery of specific\r\nmethods of treatment for as many diseases as was hoped for at one\r\ntime. Just at present progress in serum therapy appears to be at a\r\nstandstill, though vaccines are giving good results in many instances\r\nnot believed possible a few years ago. As a consequence workers in all\r\nparts of the world are giving more and more attention to the search for\r\n_specific chemical substances_, which will destroy invading parasites\r\nand not injure the host (_chemotherapy_). Nevertheless, in the study\r\nof immunity very much of value in the treatment and prevention of\r\ndisease has been learned. Also much knowledge which is of the greatest\r\nuse in other lines has been accumulated. Methods of _diagnosis_ of\r\ngreat exactness have resulted, applicable in numerous diseases. Ways\r\nof _detecting adulteration_ in foods, particularly foods from animal\r\nsources, and of _differentiating proteins_ of varied origin, as well\r\nas means of establishing _biological relationships_ and differences\r\namong groups of animals through “immunity reactions” of blood serums\r\nhave followed from knowledge gained by application of the facts or the\r\nmethods of immunity research. Hence the study of “immunity problems”\r\nhas come to include much more than merely the study of those factors\r\nwhich prevent the development of disease in an animal or result in\r\nits spontaneous recovery. A proper understanding of the principles of\r\nimmunity necessitates a study of these various features and they will\r\nbe considered in the discussion to follow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nTHEORIES OF IMMUNITY.\r\n\r\n\r\nPasteur and the bacteriologists of his time discovered that bacteria\r\ncease to grow in artificial culture media after a time, because of\r\nthe exhaustion of the food material in some cases and because of the\r\ninjurious action of their own products in other instances. These facts\r\nwere brought forward to explain immunity shortly after bacteria were\r\nshown to be the cause of certain diseases. Theories based on these\r\nobservations were called (1) “_Exhaustion Theory_” of _Pasteur_, and\r\n(2) “_Noxious Retention Theory_” of _Chauveau_ respectively. The fact,\r\nsoon discovered, that virulent pathogenic bacteria are not uncommonly\r\npresent in perfectly healthy animals, and the later discovery that\r\nimmunity may be conferred by the injection of dead bacteria have led\r\nto the abandonment of both these older ideas. The (3) “_Unfavorable\r\nEnvironment_” theory of _Baumgartner_, _i.e._, bacteria do not grow\r\nin the body and produce disease because their surroundings are not\r\nsuitable, in a sense covers the whole ground, though it is not true as\r\nto the first part, as was pointed out above, and is of no value as a\r\nworking basis, since it offers no explanation as to _what the factors\r\nare_ that constitute the “_unfavorable environment_.” Metchnikoff\r\nbrought forward a rational explanation of immunity with his (4)\r\n“_Cellular or Phagocytosis Theory_.” As first propounded it based\r\nimmunity on the observed fact that certain white blood corpuscles,\r\n_phagocytes_, engulf and destroy bacteria. Metchnikoff has since\r\nelaborated the original theory to explain facts of later discovery.\r\nEhrlich soon after published his (5) “_Chemical or Side-chain Theory_”\r\nwhich seeks to explain immunity on the basis of _chemical substances_\r\nin the body which may in part destroy pathogenic organisms or in\r\npart neutralize their products; or in some instances there may be\r\nan absence of certain chemical substances in the body cells so that\r\nbacteria or their products _cannot unite_ with the cells and hence can\r\ndo no damage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE VI\r\n\r\nPAUL EHRLICH]\r\n\r\nAt the present time it is generally accepted, in this country at\r\nleast, that Ehrlich’s theory explains immunity in many diseases as\r\nwell as many of the phenomena related to immunity, and in other\r\ndiseases the phagocytes, frequently assisted by chemical substances,\r\nare the chief factors. Specific instances are discussed in _Pathogenic\r\nBacteriologies_ which should be consulted. It is essential that the\r\nstudent should be familiar with the basic ideas of the chemical\r\ntheory, not only from the standpoint of immunity, but also in order to\r\nunderstand the principles of a number of valuable methods of diagnosis.\r\n\r\nThe chemical theory rests on three fundamental physiological\r\nprinciples: (1) the response of cells to stimuli, in this connection\r\n_specific chemical stimuli_, (2) the presence within cells of _specific\r\nchemical groups_ which combine with chemical stimuli and thus enable\r\nthem to act on the cell, which groups Ehrlich has named _receptors_,\r\nand (3) the “_over-production_” activity of cells as announced by\r\nWeigert.\r\n\r\n1. That cells respond to stimuli is fundamental in physiology. These\r\nstimuli may be of many kinds as mechanical, electrical, light, thermal,\r\nchemical, etc. The body possesses groups of cells specially developed\r\nto _receive_ some of these stimuli--touch cells for mechanical stimuli,\r\nretinal cells for light, temperature nerve endings for thermal,\r\nolfactory and gustatory cells for certain chemical stimuli. _Response_\r\nto chemical stimuli is well illustrated along the digestive tract. That\r\nthe chemical stimuli in digestion may be more or less specific is shown\r\nby the observed differences in the enzymes of the pancreatic juice\r\ndependent on the relative amounts of carbohydrates, fats, or proteins\r\nin the food, the specific enzyme in each case being increased in the\r\njuice with the increase of its corresponding foodstuff. The cells of\r\nthe body, or certain of them at least, seem to respond in a specific\r\nway when substances are brought into direct contact with them, that is,\r\nwithout having been subjected to digestion in the alimentary tract,\r\nbut injected directly into the blood or lymph stream. Cells may be\r\naffected by stimuli in one of three ways: if the stimulus is too weak,\r\nthere is no effect (in reality there is no “stimulus” acting); if the\r\nstimulus is too strong, the cell is injured, or may be destroyed; if\r\nthe stimulus is of proper amount then it excites the cell to increased\r\nactivity, and in the case of _specific chemical stimuli_ the increased\r\nactivity, as mentioned for the pancreas, shows itself in an _increased\r\nproduction of whatever is called forth by the chemical stimulus_. In\r\nthe case of many organic chemicals, the substances produced by the\r\ncells under their direct stimulation are markedly specific for the\r\nparticular substance introduced.\r\n\r\n2. Since chemical action always implies at least two bodies to react,\r\nEhrlich assumes that in every cell which is affected by a chemical\r\nstimulus there must therefore be a chemical group to unite with this\r\nstimulus. He further states that there must be as many different\r\nkinds of these groups as there are different kinds of chemicals which\r\nstimulate the cell. Since these groups are present in the body cells to\r\n_take up_ different kinds of chemical substances, Ehrlich calls them\r\n_receptors_. Since these groups must be small as compared with the cell\r\nas a whole, and must be more or less on the surface and unite readily\r\nwith chemical substances he further speaks of them as “side-chains”\r\nafter the analogy of compounds of the aromatic series especially. The\r\nterm _receptors_ is now generally used. As was stated above, the effect\r\nof _specific chemical stimuli_ is to cause the production of _more of\r\nthe particular substance_ for which it is specific and in the class\r\nof bodies under discussion, the _particular product is these cell\r\nreceptors_ with which the chemical may unite.\r\n\r\n3. Weigert first called attention to the practically constant\r\nphenomenon that cells ordinarily respond by doing more of a particular\r\nresponse than is actually called for by the stimulus, that there is\r\nalways an “overproduction” of activity. In the case of chemical stimuli\r\nthis means an _increased production of the specific substance_ over and\r\nabove the amount actually needed.\r\n\r\nThe student will better understand this theory if he recalls his\r\nfundamental physiology. Living substance is characterized, among other\r\nthings, by irritability which is instability. It is in a constant,\r\nstate of unstable equilibrium. Whenever the equilibrium becomes\r\npermanently stable the substance is dead. It is also continually\r\nattempting to restore disturbances in its equilibrium. Whenever a\r\nchemical substance unites with a chemical substance in the cell, a\r\nreceptor, the latter is, so far as the cell is concerned, _thrown out\r\nof function_ for that cell. The chemical equilibrium of the latter\r\nis upset. It attempts to restore this and does so by making a _new_\r\nreceptor to take the place of the one thrown out of function. If this\r\nprocess is continued, _i.e._, if the new receptor is similarly “used\r\nup” and others similarly formed are also, then the cell will prepare\r\na supply of these and even an excess, according to Weigert’s theory.\r\nWhenever a cell accumulates an excess of products the normal result\r\nis that it excretes them from its own substance into the surrounding\r\nlymph, whence they reach the blood stream to be either carried to\r\nthe true excretory organs, utilized by other cells or remain for a\r\nlonger or shorter time in the blood. Hence the excess of receptors\r\nis _excreted from the cell that forms them_ and they become _free_\r\nin the blood. These free receptors are termed _antibodies_. _They\r\nare receptors_ but instead of being retained in the cell are _free\r\nin solution in the blood_. One function of the free receptor, the\r\nantibody, is _always to unite with the chemical substance which caused\r\nit to be formed_. _It may have additional functions._ The chemical\r\nsubstance which caused the excess formation of receptors, antibodies,\r\nis termed an _antigen_ for that particular kind of antibody.\r\n\r\nTo recapitulate, Ehrlich’s theory postulates _specific chemical\r\nstimuli_, which react with _specific chemical substances in the body\r\ncells, named receptors_, and that these _receptors_, according to\r\nWeigert, are _produced in excess_ and hence are excreted from the\r\ncell and become _free receptors_ in the blood and lymph. These _free\r\nreceptors_ are the various kinds of _antibodies_, the kind depending\r\non the nature of the stimulus, antigen, the substance introduced. Any\r\nsubstance which when introduced into the body causes the formation of\r\nan antibody of any kind whatsoever is called an _antigen_,[23] _i.e._,\r\nanti (body) former.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing discussion explains Ehrlich’s theory of immunity.\r\nAccording to this theory the _manner of formation of all antibodies_ is\r\nthe same. The _kind of antibody_ and the _manner of its action_ will\r\ndiffer with the _different kinds of antigens_ used.\r\n\r\nThe succeeding chapters discuss some of the kinds of antibodies, the\r\ntheory of their action and some practical applications. It must be\r\nborne in mind throughout the study of these, as has been stated, that\r\n_every antibody has the property of uniting with its antigen whether it\r\nhas any property in addition or not_.\r\n\r\nJust what antibodies are chemically has not been determined because\r\nno one has as yet succeeded in isolating them chemically pure. To the\r\nauthor they appear to be enzymes.\r\n\r\nAntigens were considered by Ehrlich to be proteins or to be related to\r\nproteins. Most workers since Ehrlich have held similar views. Dr. Carl\r\nWarden of the University of Michigan has been doing much work in recent\r\nyears in which he is attempting to show that the antigens are not\r\nproteins but are fats or fatty acids. Mr. E. E. H. Boyer, in his work\r\n(not yet published) in the author’s laboratory for the degree of Ph.D.,\r\nreceived in June, 1920, succeeded in producing various antibodies from\r\n_Bacterium coli_ antigens. In these antigens he could detect only fatty\r\nacids or salts of fatty acids. If the work of these men is confirmed,\r\nit will open up a most interesting and extremely important field in\r\nimmunity and in preventive medicine. It is not apparent that the nature\r\nof the antigen would affect Ehrlich’s theory of the formation of\r\nantibodies.\r\n\r\nThe author has no doubt that eventually the formation of antibodies and\r\nthe reactions between them and their antigens will be explained on the\r\nbasis of physical-chemical laws, but this probably awaits the discovery\r\nof their nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nRECEPTORS OF THE FIRST ORDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTITOXINS--ANTIENZYMES.\r\n\r\nThe general characteristics of toxins have been described (Chapter\r\nXII). It has been stated that they are more or less specific in\r\ntheir action on cells. In order to affect a cell it is evident that\r\na toxin must enter into chemical combination with it. This implies\r\nthat the toxin molecule possesses a chemical group which can combine\r\nwith a receptor of the cell. This group is called the _haptophore_ or\r\ncombining group. The toxic or injurious portion of the toxin molecule\r\nis likewise spoken of as the _toxophore_ group. When a toxin is\r\nintroduced into the body its _haptophore_ group combines with suitable\r\n_receptors_ in different cells of the body. If not too much of the\r\ntoxin is given, instead of injuring, it acts as a chemical stimulus\r\nto the cell in the manner already described. The cell in response\r\nproduces more of the specific thing, which in this instance is more\r\nreceptors which can combine with the toxin, _i.e._, with its haptophore\r\ngroup. If the stimulus is kept up, more and more of these receptors\r\nare produced until an excess for the cell accumulates, which excess is\r\nexcreted from the individual cell and becomes free in the blood. These\r\nfree receptors have, of course, the capacity to combine with toxin\r\nthrough its haptophore group. When the toxin is combined with these\r\nfree receptors, it cannot combine with any other receptors, _e.g._,\r\nthose in another cell and hence cannot injure another cell. These free\r\nreceptors constitute, in this case, _antitoxin_, so-called because\r\nthey can combine with toxin and hence neutralize it. Antitoxins are\r\nspecific--that is, an antitoxin which will combine with the toxin of\r\n_Clostridium tetani_ will not combine with that of _Corynebacterium\r\ndiphtheriæ_ or of _Clostridium botulinum_, or of any other toxin,\r\nvegetable or animal.\r\n\r\nWhen a toxin is kept in solution for some time or when it is heated\r\nabove a certain temperature (different for each toxin) it loses its\r\npoisonous character. It may be shown, however, that it is still capable\r\nof uniting with antitoxin, and preventing the latter from uniting with\r\na fresh toxin. This confirms the hypothesis that a toxin molecule has\r\nat least two groups: a combining or _haptophore_, and a poisoning or\r\n_toxophore_ group. A toxin which has lost its poisonous property, its\r\ntoxophore group, is spoken of as a _toxoid_. The theory of antitoxin\r\nformation is further supported by the fact that the proper introduction\r\nof _toxoid_, the _haptophore_ group, and hence the real stimulus, can\r\ncause the production of _antitoxin_ to a certain extent at least.\r\n\r\nThe close relationship between toxins and enzymes has already been\r\npointed out. This is still further illustrated by the fact that when\r\nenzymes are properly introduced into the tissues of an animal there\r\nis formed in the animal an _antienzyme_ specific for the enzyme in\r\nquestion which can prevent its action. The structure of enzymes,\r\nas composed of a _haptophore_, or uniting, and a _zymophore_ or\r\n_digesting_ (or other activity) group, is similar to that of toxins,\r\nand _enzymoids_ or enzymes which can combine with the substance acted\r\non but not affect it further, have been demonstrated.\r\n\r\nThese free cell receptors, antitoxins or antienzymes, which are\r\nproduced in the body by the proper introduction of toxins or enzymes,\r\nrespectively, have the function of _combining_ with these bodies\r\n_but no other action_. As was pointed out above, this is sufficient\r\nto neutralize the toxin or enzyme and prevent any injurious effect\r\nsince they can unite with nothing else. Since these receptors are the\r\nsimplest type which has been studied as yet, they are spoken of by\r\nEhrlich as _receptors of the first order_. Other antibodies which are\r\nlikewise free receptors of the first, order and have the function of\r\ncombining only have been prepared and will be referred to in their\r\nproper connection. They are mainly of theoretical interest.\r\n\r\nEhrlich did a large part of his work on toxins and antitoxins\r\nwith _ricin_, the toxin of the castor-oil bean, _abrin_, from the\r\njequirity bean, _robin_ from the locust tree, and with the toxins and\r\nantitoxins for diphtheria and tetanus. Antitoxins have been prepared\r\nexperimentally for a large number of both animal and vegetable poisons,\r\nincluding a number for bacterial toxins. The only ones which, as yet,\r\nare of much practical importance are _antivenin_ for snake poison, (not\r\na true toxin, however, see p. 275), _antipollenin_ (supposed to be\r\nfor the toxin of hay fever) and the antitoxins for the true bacterial\r\ntoxins of _Corynebacterium diphtheriæ_ and _Clostridium tetani_.\r\n\r\nThe method of preparing antitoxins is essentially the same in all\r\ncases, though differing in minor details. For commercial purposes\r\nlarge animals are selected, usually horses, so that the yield of\r\nserum may be large. The animals must, of course, be vigorous, free\r\nfrom all infectious disease. The first injection given is either a\r\nrelatively small amount of a solution of toxin or of a mixture of\r\ntoxin and antitoxin. The animal shows more or less reaction, increased\r\ntemperature, pulse and respiration and frequently an edema at the\r\npoint of injection, unless this is made intravenously. After several\r\ndays to a week or more, when the animal has recovered from the first\r\ninjection, a second stronger dose is given, usually with less reaction.\r\nIncreasingly large doses are given at proper intervals until the animal\r\nmay take several hundred times the amount which would have been fatal\r\nif given at first. The process of immunizing a horse for diphtheria or\r\ntetanus toxin usually takes several months. Variations in time and in\r\nyield of antitoxin are individual and not predictable in any given case.\r\n\r\nAfter several injections a few hundred cubic centimeters of blood\r\nare withdrawn from the jugular vein and serum from this is tested\r\nfor the amount of antitoxin it contains. When the amount is found\r\nsufficiently large (250 “units” at least for diphtheria per cc.)[24]\r\nthen the maximum amount of blood is collected from the jugular with\r\nsterile trocar and cannula. The serum from this blood with the addition\r\nof an antiseptic (0.5 per cent. phenol, tricresol, etc.) constitutes\r\n“antidiphtheritic serum” or “antitetanic serum,” etc. All sera which\r\nare put on the market must conform to definite standards of strength\r\nexpressed in “units” as determined by the U. S. Hygienic Laboratory.\r\nIn reality a “unit” of diphtheria antitoxin in the United States is\r\nan amount equivalent to 1 cc. of a given solution of a _standard_\r\ndiphtheria _antitoxin_ which is kept at the above-mentioned laboratory.\r\nThis statement, of course, gives no definite idea as to the amount\r\nof antitoxin actually in a “unit.” Specifically stated, a “unit” of\r\nantitoxin contains approximately the amount which would protect a 250\r\ngram guinea-pig from 100 minimum lethal doses of diphtheria toxin, or\r\nprotect 100 guinea-pigs weighing 250 grams each from one minimum lethal\r\ndose each. The minimum lethal dose (M. L. D.) of diphtheria toxin is\r\nthe least amount that will kill a guinea-pig of the size mentioned\r\nwithin four days. Since toxins on standing change into toxoids to a\r\ngreat extent, the amount, of antitoxin in a “unit,” though protecting\r\nagainst 100 M. L. D., in reality would protect against about 200 M. L.\r\nD. of toxin containing no toxoid.\r\n\r\nThe official unit for tetanus antitoxin is somewhat different, since it\r\nis standardized against a _standard toxin_ which is likewise kept at\r\nthe Hygienic Laboratory. The unit is defined as “ten times the amount\r\nof antitoxin necessary to protect a 350 g. guinea-pig for 96 hours\r\nagainst the _standard test dose_” of the standard toxin. The standard\r\ntest dose is 100 M. L. D. of toxin for a 350 g. guinea-pig. To express\r\nit another way, one could say that a “unit” of tetanus antitoxin\r\nwould protect one thousand 350 g. guinea-pigs from 1 M. L. D. each of\r\nstandard tetanus toxin.\r\n\r\nVarious methods have been devised for increasing the amount of\r\nantitoxin in 1 cc. of solution by precipitating out portions of the\r\nblood-serum proteins and at the same time concentrating the antitoxin\r\nin smaller volume. It is not considered necessary in a work of this\r\ncharacter to enter into these details nor to discuss the process of\r\nstandardizing antitoxin so that the exact amount of “units” per cc. may\r\nbe known.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nRECEPTORS OF THE SECOND ORDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nAGGLUTININS.\r\n\r\nCharrin and Rogers appear to have been the first (1889) to observe the\r\nclumping together of bacteria (_Pseudomonas pyocyanea_) when mixed\r\nwith the blood serum of an animal immunized against them. Gruber and\r\nDurham (1896) first used the term “agglutination” in this connection\r\nand called the substance in the blood-serum “agglutinin.” Widal (1896)\r\nshowed the importance of the reaction for diagnosis by testing the\r\nblood serum of an infected person against a known culture (typhoid\r\nfever).\r\n\r\nIt is now a well-known phenomenon that the proper injection of cells\r\nof any kind foreign to a given animal will lead to the accumulation in\r\nthe animal’s blood of substances which will cause a clumping together\r\nof the cells used when suspended in a suitable liquid. The cells settle\r\nout of such suspension much more rapidly than they would otherwise\r\ndo. This clumping is spoken of as “agglutination” and the substances\r\nproduced in the animal are called “agglutinins.” If blood cells are\r\ninjected then “hemagglutinins” result: if bacterial cells “bacterial\r\nagglutinins” for the particular organism used as “glanders agglutinin”\r\nfor _Pfeifferella mallei_, “abortion agglutinin” for _Bacterium\r\nabortus_, “typhoid agglutinin” for _Bacterium typhosum_, etc.\r\n\r\nThe phenomenon may be observed either under the microscope or in small\r\ntest-tubes, that is, either _microscopically_ or _macroscopically_.\r\n\r\nIn this case the cells introduced, or more properly, some substances\r\nwithin the cells, act as stimuli to the body cells of the animal\r\ninjected to cause them to produce more of the specific cell receptors\r\nwhich respond to the stimulus. The substance within the introduced\r\ncell which acts as a stimulus (_antigen_) to the body cells is called\r\nan “_agglutinogen_.” That “agglutinogen” is present in the cell has\r\nbeen shown by injecting animals experimentally with extracts of cells\r\n(bacterial and other cells) and the blood serum of the animal injected\r\nshowed the presence of agglutinin for the given cell. It will be\r\nnoticed that the receptors which become the free agglutinins have at\r\nleast _two functions_, hence at least _two chemical groups_. They must\r\ncombine with the foreign cells and also bring about their clumping\r\ntogether, their agglutination. Hence it can be stated technically that\r\nan agglutinin possesses a _haptophore group_ and an _agglutinating\r\ngroup_.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that the agglutination, the clumping, is a secondary\r\nphenomenon depending on the presence of certain salts and that the\r\nagglutinin acts on its antigen as an enzyme, possibly a “splitting”\r\nenzyme. This is analogous to what occurs in the curdling of milk\r\nby rennet and in the coagulation of blood. This probability is\r\nsubstantiated by the fact that suspensions of bacteria may be\r\n“agglutinated” by appropriate strengths of various acids.\r\n\r\nThe formation of agglutinin in the body for different bacteria does\r\nnot as yet appear to be of any special significance in protecting the\r\nanimal from the organism, since the bacteria are not killed, even\r\nthough they are rendered non-motile, if of the class provided with\r\nflagella, and are clumped together. The fact that such bodies are\r\nformed, however, is of decided value in the diagnosis of disease, and\r\nalso in the identification of unknown bacteria.\r\n\r\nIn many bacterial diseases, agglutinins for the particular organism\r\nare present in the blood serum of the affected animal. Consequently\r\nif the blood serum of the animal be mixed with a suspension of the\r\norganism supposed to be the cause of the disease and the latter be\r\nagglutinated, one is justified in considering it the causative agent,\r\nprovided certain necessary conditions are fulfilled. In the first place\r\nit must be remembered that the blood of normal animals frequently\r\ncontains agglutinins (“normal agglutinins”) for many different\r\nbacteria when mixed with them in full strength. Hence the serum must\r\nalways be diluted with physiological salt solution (0.85 per cent.).\r\nFurther, closely related bacteria may be agglutinated to some extent by\r\nthe same serum. It is evident that if they are closely related, their\r\nprotoplasm must contain some substances of the same kind to account for\r\nthis relationship. Since some of these substances may be agglutinogens,\r\ntheir introduction into the animal body will give rise to agglutinins\r\nfor the related cells, as well as for the cell introduced. The\r\nagglutinins for the cell introduced “chief agglutinins,” will be\r\nformed in larger quantity, since a given bacterial cell must contain\r\nmore of its own agglutinogen than that of any other cell. By _diluting\r\nthe blood serum_ from the animal to be tested the agglutinins for the\r\nrelated organisms (so-called “coagglutinins” or “partial agglutinins”)\r\nwill become so much diminished as to show no action, while the\r\nagglutinin for the specific organism is still present in an amount\r\nsufficient to cause its clumping. _Agglutinins are specific for their\r\nparticular agglutinogens_, but since a given blood serum may contain\r\nmany agglutinins, the _serum’s specificity for a given bacterium_\r\ncan be determined only by diluting it until this bacterium alone\r\nis agglutinated. Hence the necessity of diluting the unknown serum\r\nin varying amounts when testing against several known bacteria to\r\ndetermine for which it is specific, _i.e._, which is the cause of the\r\ndisease in the animal.\r\n\r\nThe agglutinins in the serum may be removed from it by treating it with\r\na suspension of the cells for which agglutinins are present. If the\r\n“chief” cell is used all the agglutinins will be absorbed. If related\r\ncells are used, only the agglutinins for this particular kind are\r\nremoved. These “absorption tests” furnish another means of determining\r\nspecificity of serum, or rather of determining the “chief agglutinin”\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nJust as an unidentified _disease_ in an animal may be determined by\r\ntesting its serum as above described against _known_ kinds of bacteria,\r\nso _unknown bacteria_ isolated from an animal, from water, etc., may\r\nbe identified by testing them against the _blood sera_ of different\r\nanimals, each of which has been properly inoculated with a different\r\nkind of _known bacteria_. If the unknown organism is agglutinated\r\nby the blood of one of the animals in high dilution, and not by the\r\nothers, evidently the bacterium is the same as that with which the\r\nanimal has been inoculated, or _immunized_, as is usually stated. This\r\nmethod of identifying cultures of bacteria is of wide application,\r\nbut is used practically only in those cases where other methods of\r\nidentification are not readily applied, and especially where other\r\nmethods are _not sufficient_ as in the “intestinal group” of organisms\r\nin human practice.\r\n\r\nThe diagnosis of disease in an animal by testing its serum is also a\r\nvaluable and much used procedure. This is the method of the “Widal” or\r\n“Gruber-Widal” test for typhoid fever in man and is used in veterinary\r\npractice in testing for glanders, contagious abortion, etc. In some\r\ncases a dilution of the serum of from 20 to 50 times is sufficient for\r\ndiagnosis (Malta fever), in most cases, however, 50 times is the lowest\r\nlimit. Evidently the greater the dilution, that is, the higher the\r\n“titer,” the more specific is the reaction.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRECIPITINS.\r\n\r\nSince agglutinins act on bacteria, probably through the presence of\r\nsubstances within the bacterial cell, it is reasonable to expect that\r\nif these substances be dissolved out of the cell, there would be some\r\nreaction between their (colloidal) solution and the same serum. As\r\na matter of fact Kraus (1897) showed that broth cultures freed from\r\nbacteria by porcelain filters do show a precipitate when mixed with\r\nthe serum of an animal immunized against the particular bacterium and\r\nthat the reaction is specific under proper conditions of dilution.\r\nIt was not long after Kraus’s work until the experiments were tried\r\nof “immunizing” an animal not against a bacterium or its filtered\r\nculture, but against (colloidal) solutions of proteins, such as white\r\nof egg, casein of milk, proteins of meat and of blood serum, vegetable\r\nproteins, etc. It was ascertained that in all these cases the animal’s\r\nserum contains a substance which causes a _precipitate_ with solutions\r\nof the protein used for immunization. The number of such precipitating\r\nserums that have been made experimentally is very large and it appears\r\nthat protein from any source when properly introduced into the blood\r\nor tissues of an animal will cause the formation of a precipitating\r\nsubstance for its solutions. This substance is known, technically as a\r\n“_precipitin_.” The protein used as antigen to stimulate its formation,\r\nor some part of the protein molecule (haptophore group), which acts\r\nas stimulus to the cell is spoken of as a “precipitinogen,” both\r\nterms after the analogy of “agglutinin” and “agglutinogen.” In fact\r\nthe specific precipitation and agglutination are strictly analogous\r\nphenomena. Precipitins act on proteins in (colloidal) _solution_ and\r\ncause them to settle out, agglutinins act on substances within cells\r\nwhich cells are in _suspension_ in a fluid and cause the cells to\r\nsettle out. Ehrlich’s theory of the formation of precipitins is similar\r\nto that of agglutinins, and need not be repeated. Substitute the\r\ncorresponding words in the theory of formation of agglutinins as above\r\ngiven and the theory applies.\r\n\r\nThe precipitin reaction has not found much practical use in\r\nbacteriology largely because the “agglutination test” takes its place\r\nas simpler of performance and just as accurate. The reaction is,\r\nhowever, generally applicable to filtrates of bacterial cultures and\r\ncould be used if needed. The so-called “mallease” reaction in glanders\r\nis an instance.\r\n\r\nPrecipitins find their greatest usefulness in legal medicine and\r\nin food adulteration work. As was noted above, if animals, rabbits\r\nfor example, are immunized with the blood of another animal (human\r\nbeings) precipitins are developed which are specific for the injected\r\nblood with proper dilution. This forms an extremely valuable means\r\nof determining the _kind of blood_ present in a given spot shown by\r\nchemical and spectroscopic tests to be blood and has been adopted as\r\na legal test in countries where such rules of procedure are applied.\r\nSimilarly the test has been used to identify the different kinds of\r\nmeat in sausage, and different kinds of milk in a mixture. An extract\r\nof the sausage is made and tested against the serum of an animal\r\npreviously treated with extract of horse meat, or hog meat, or beef,\r\netc., the specific precipitate occurring with the specific serum. Such\r\nreactions have been obtained where the protein to be tested was diluted\r\n100,000 times and more. Biological relationships and differences have\r\nbeen detected by the reaction. Human immune serum shows no reaction\r\nwith the blood of any animals except to a slight extent with that of\r\nvarious monkeys, most with the higher, very slight with the lower Old\r\nWorld and scarcely any with New World monkeys.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact of theoretical interest mainly that if agglutinins\r\nand precipitins themselves be injected into an animal they will\r\nact as _antigens_ and cause the formation of _antiagglutinins_ or\r\n_antiprecipitins_, which are therefore receptors of the first order\r\nsince they simply combine with these immune bodies to neutralize their\r\naction, have only a combining or haptophore group. Also if agglutinins\r\nor precipitins be heated to the proper temperature they may retain\r\ntheir combining power but cause no agglutination or precipitation,\r\n_i.e._, they are converted into agglutinoid or precipitinoid\r\nrespectively after the analogy of toxin and toxoid.\r\n\r\nPrecipitins like agglutinins possess at least two groups--a combining\r\nor _haptophore_ group and a _precipitating_ (sometimes called\r\nzymophore) group. Hence they are somewhat more complex than antitoxins\r\nor antienzymes which have a combining group only. For this reason\r\nEhrlich classes agglutinins and precipitins as _receptors of the second\r\norder_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nRECEPTORS OF THE THIRD ORDER.\r\n\r\n\r\nCYTOLYSINS.\r\n\r\nBefore Koch definitely proved bacteria capable of causing disease\r\nseveral physiologists had noted that the red corpuscles of certain\r\nanimals were destroyed by the blood of other animals (Creite, 1869,\r\nLandois, 1875), and Traube and Gescheidel had shown that freshly drawn\r\nblood destroys bacteria (1874). It was not until about ten years\r\nafterward that this action of the blood began to be investigated in\r\nconnection with the subject of immunity. Von Fodor (1885) showed that\r\nsaprophytic bacteria injected into the blood are rapidly destroyed.\r\nFlügge and his pupils, especially Nuttall in combating Metchnikoff’s\r\ntheory of phagocytosis, announced in 1883, studied the action of the\r\nblood on bacteria and showed its destructive effect (1885-57). Nuttall\r\nalso showed that the blood lost this power if heated to 56°. Buchner\r\n(1889) gave the name “alexin” (from the Greek “to ward off”) to the\r\ndestroying substance and showed that the substance was present in\r\nthe _blood serum_ as well as in the whole blood, and that when the\r\nserum lost its power to dissolve, this could be restored by adding\r\nfresh blood. Pfeiffer (1894) showed that the destructive power of the\r\nblood of animals immunized against bacteria (cholera and typhoid) was\r\nmarkedly specific for the bacteria used. He introduced a mixture of\r\nthe blood and the bacteria into the abdominal cavity of the immunized\r\nanimal or of a normal one of the same species and noted the rapid\r\nsolution of the bacteria by withdrawing portions of the peritoneal\r\nfluid and examining them (“Pfeiffer’s phenomenon”). Belfanti and\r\nCarbone and especially Bordet (1898) showed the specific dissolving\r\naction of the serum of one animal on the blood corpuscles of another\r\nanimal with which it had been injected. Since this time the phenomenon\r\nhas been observed with a great variety of cells other than red blood\r\ncorpuscles and bacteria--leukocytes, spermatozoa, cells from liver,\r\nkidney, brain, epithelia, etc., protozoa, and many vegetable cells.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore a well-established fact that the proper injection of\r\nan animal with almost any cell foreign to it will lead to the blood of\r\nthe animal injected acquiring the power to injure or destroy cells of\r\nthe same kind as those introduced. The destroying power of the blood\r\nhas been variously called its “cytotoxic” or “cytolytic” power, though\r\nthe terms are not strictly synonymous since “cytotoxic” means “cell\r\npoisoning” or “injuring,” while “cytolytic” means “cell dissolving.”\r\nThe latter term is the one generally used and there is said to be\r\npresent in the blood a specific “cytolysin.” The term is a general one\r\nand a given cytolysin is named from the cell which is dissolved, as a\r\n_bacteriolysin_, a _hemolysin_ (red-corpuscle-lysin), _epitheliolysin_,\r\n_nephrolysin_ (for kidney cells), etc. If the cell is _killed_ but\r\nnot _dissolved_ the suffix “cidin” or “toxin” is frequently used as\r\n“bacteriocidin,” “spermotoxin,” “neurotoxin,” etc.\r\n\r\nThe use of the term “cytolysin” is also not strictly correct, though\r\nconvenient, for the process is more complex than if _one substance\r\nonly_ were employed. As was stated above, the immune serum loses its\r\npower to dissolve the cell if it is heated to 55° to 56° for half an\r\nhour, it is _inactivated_. But if there be added to the heated or\r\ninactivated serum a small amount of _normal serum_ (which contains only\r\na very little cytolytic substance, so that it has no dissolving power\r\nwhen so diluted) the mixture again becomes cytolytic. It is evident\r\nthen that in cytolysis there are _two distinct substances_ involved,\r\none which is _present in all serum, normal or immune_, and the other\r\n_present only in the immune cytolytic_ serum. This may be more apparent\r\nif the facts are arranged in the following form:\r\n\r\n  I. Immune serum dissolves cells in high dilution.\r\n\r\n  II. Heated immune serum does not dissolve cells.\r\n\r\n  III. Normal serum in high dilution does not dissolve cells.\r\n\r\n  II. + III., _i.e._, Heated immune serum plus diluted normal serum\r\n  dissolves cells.\r\n\r\nTherefore, there is something in heated immune serum necessary for\r\ncell dissolving and something different in diluted normal serum which\r\nis necessary. This latter something is present in unheated immune\r\nserum also, and is destroyed by heat. Experiment has shown that it is\r\nthe substance present in all serum both normal and immune that is the\r\ntrue dissolving body, while the immune substance serves to unite this\r\nbody to the cell to be destroyed, _i.e._, to the antigen. Since the\r\nimmune body has therefore _two uniting groups_, one for the dissolving\r\nsubstance and one for the cell to be dissolved, Ehrlich calls it the\r\n“_amboceptor_.” He also uses the word “_complement_” to denote the\r\ndissolving substance, giving the idea that it completes the action of\r\ndissolving after it has been united to the cell by the amboceptor, thus\r\nreplacing Buchner’s older term “alexin” for the same dissolving body.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMBOCEPTORS.\r\n\r\nThe theory of formation of amboceptors is similar to that for the\r\nformation of the other types of antibodies. The cell introduced\r\ncontains some substance, which acts as a chemical stimulus to some of\r\nthe body cells provided with proper receptors so that more of these\r\nspecial receptors are produced, and eventually in excess so that they\r\nbecome free in the blood and constitute the free amboceptors. It will\r\nbe noticed that these free receptors differ from either of the two\r\nkinds already described in that they have _two uniting groups_, one for\r\nthe antigen (cell introduced) named _cytophil-haptophore_, the other\r\nfor the complement, _complementophil haptophore_. Hence amboceptors\r\nare spoken of as _receptors of the third order_. They have no other\r\nfunction than that of this double combining power. The action which\r\nresults is due to the third body--the complement. It will be readily\r\nseen that complement must possess at least two groups, a combining or\r\n_haptophore group_ which unites with the amboceptor, and an active\r\ngroup which is usually called the _zymophore_ or _toxophore_ group.\r\nComplements thus resemble either toxins, where the specific cell\r\n(antigen) is injured or killed, or enzymes, in case the cell is\r\nlikewise dissolved. This action again shows the close relation between\r\ntoxins and enzymes. Complement may lose its active group in the same\r\nway that toxin does and becomes then _complementoid_. Complement is\r\nreadily destroyed in blood or serum by heating it to 55° to 56° for\r\nhalf an hour, and is also destroyed spontaneously when serum stands for\r\na day or two, less rapidly at low temperature than at room temperature.\r\n\r\nAmboceptors appear to be _specific_ in the same sense that agglutinins\r\nare. That is, if a given cell is used to immunize an animal, the\r\nanimal’s blood will contain amboceptors for the cell used and also for\r\nothers closely related to it. Immunization with spermatozoa or with\r\nepithelial or liver cells gives rise to amboceptors for these cells\r\nand also for red blood corpuscles and other body cells. A typhoid\r\nbactericidal serum has also some dissolving effect on colon bacilli,\r\netc. Hence a given serum may contain a chief amboceptor and a variety\r\nof “coamboceptors,” or one amboceptor made up of a number of “partial\r\namboceptors” each specific for its own antigen (“amboceptorogen”).\r\nAmboceptors may combine with other substances than antigen and\r\ncomplement, as is shown by their union with lecithin and other\r\n“lipoids,” though these substances seem capable of acting as complement\r\nin causing solution of blood corpuscles.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPLEMENTS.\r\n\r\nAs to whether complements are numerous, as Ehrlich claims, or there\r\nis only one complement, according to Buchner and others, need not be\r\ndiscussed here. In the practical applications given later as means of\r\ndiagnosis it is apparent that all the complement or complements are\r\ncapable of uniting with at least two kinds of amboceptors.\r\n\r\nIf complement be injected into an animal it may act as an antigen and\r\ngive rise to the formation of _anticomplement_ which may combine with\r\nit and prevent its action and is consequently analogous to antitoxin.\r\nIf amboceptors as antigen are injected into an animal there will be\r\nformed by the animal’s cells _antiamboceptors_. As one would expect,\r\nthere are two kinds of antiamboceptors, one for each of its combining\r\ngroups, since it has been stated that it is always the combining group\r\nof any given antigen that acts as the cell stimulus. Hence we may have\r\nan “anticytophil amboceptor” or an “anticomplementophil amboceptor.”\r\nThese antiamboceptors and the anticomplements are analogous to\r\nantitoxin, antiagglutinin, etc., and hence are receptors of the first\r\norder.\r\n\r\n\r\nANTISNAKE VENOMS.\r\n\r\nA practical use of antiamboceptors is in antisnake venoms. Snake\r\npoisons appear to contain only _amboceptors_ for different cells of the\r\nbody. In the most deadly the amboceptor is specific for nerve cells\r\n(cobra), in others for red corpuscles, or for endothelial cells of the\r\nbloodvessels (rattlesnake). The complement is furnished by the blood\r\nof the individual bitten, that is, in a sense the individual poisons\r\nhimself, since he furnishes the destroying element. The antisera\r\ncontain antiamboceptors which unite with the amboceptor introduced and\r\nprevent it joining to cells and thus binding the complement to the\r\ncells and destroying them. With this exception these antibodies are\r\nchiefly of theoretical interest.\r\n\r\n\r\nFAILURE OF CYTOLYTIC SERUMS.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the possibility of producing a strongly bactericidal\r\nserum in the manner above described aroused the hope that such sera\r\nwould prove of great value in passive immunization and serum treatment\r\nof bacterial diseases. Unfortunately such expectations have not been\r\nrealized and no serum of this character of much practical importance\r\nhas been developed as yet (with the possible exception of Flexner’s\r\nantimeningococcus serum in human practice. What hog cholera serum is\r\nremains to be discovered).\r\n\r\nThe reasons for the failure of such sera are not entirely clear.\r\nThe following are some that have been offered: (1) Amboceptors do\r\nnot appear to be present in very large amount so that relatively\r\nlarge injections of blood are necessary, which is not without risk\r\nin itself. (2) Since the complement is furnished by the blood of the\r\nanimal to be treated, there may not be enough of this to unite with a\r\nsufficient quantity of amboceptor to destroy all the bacteria present,\r\nhence the disease is continued by those that escape. (3) Or the\r\ncomplement may not be of the right kind to unite with the amboceptor\r\nintroduced, since this is derived from the blood of a _heterologous_\r\n(“other kind”) species. In hog-cholera serum, if it is bactericidal,\r\nthis difficulty is removed by using blood of a _homologous_ (“same\r\nkind”) animal. Hence Ehrlich suggested the use of apes for preparing\r\nbactericidal sera for human beings. The good results which have been\r\nreported in the treatment of human beings with the serum of persons\r\nconvalescing from the same disease indicate that this lack of proper\r\ncomplement for the given amboceptor is probably a chief factor in the\r\nfailure of sera from lower animals. (4) The bacteria may be localized\r\nin tissues (lymph glands), within cavities (cranial, peritoneal), in\r\nhollow organs (alimentary tract), etc., so that it is not possible to\r\nget at them with sufficient serum to destroy all. This difficulty is\r\nobviated by injecting directly into the spinal canal when Flexner’s\r\nantimeningococcus serum is used. (5) Even if the bacteria are dissolved\r\nit does not necessarily follow that their _endotoxins_ are destroyed.\r\nThese may be merely liberated and add to the danger of the patient,\r\nthough this does not appear to be a valid objection. (6) Complement\r\nwhich is present in such a large excess of amboceptor may just as\r\nwell unite with amboceptor which is not united to the bacteria to be\r\ndestroyed as with that which is, and hence be actually prevented from\r\ndissolving the bacteria. Therefore it is difficult to standardize the\r\nserum to get a proper amount of amboceptor for the complement present.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPLEMENT-FIXATION TEST.\r\n\r\nAlthough little practical use has been made of bactericidal sera,\r\nthe discovery of receptors of this class and the peculiar relations\r\nbetween the antigen, amboceptor and complement have resulted in\r\ndeveloping one of the most delicate and accurate methods for the\r\ndiagnosis of disease and for the recognition of small amounts of\r\nspecific protein that is in use today.\r\n\r\nThis method is usually spoken of as the “complement-fixation” or the\r\n“complement-deviation test” (“Wassermann test” in syphilis) and is\r\napplicable in a great variety of microbial diseases, but it is of\r\npractical importance in those diseases only where other methods are\r\nuncertain--syphilis in man, concealed glanders in horses, contagious\r\nabortion in cattle, etc. A better name would be the “Unknown Amboceptor\r\nTest” since it is the amboceptor that is searched for in the test by\r\nmaking use of its power to “fix” complement.\r\n\r\nThe principle is the same in all cases. The method depends, as\r\nindicated above, on the ability of complement to combine with at least\r\ntwo amboceptor-antigen systems, and on the further fact that if the\r\ncombination with one amboceptor-antigen system is once formed, it\r\ndoes not dissociate so as to liberate the complement for union with\r\nthe second amboceptor-antigen system. If an animal is infected with a\r\nmicroörganism and a part of its defensive action consists in destroying\r\nthe organisms in its blood or lymph, then it follows from the above\r\ndiscussion of cytolysins that there will be developed in the blood of\r\nthe animal amboceptor specific for the organism in question. If the\r\npresence of this _specific amboceptor_ can be detected, the conclusion\r\nis warranted that the organism for which it is specific is the cause of\r\nthe disease. Consequently what is sought in the “complement-fixation\r\ntest” is a _specific amboceptor_. In carrying out the test, blood\r\nserum from the suspected animal is collected, heated at 56° for half\r\nan hour to destroy any complement it contains and mixed in definite\r\nproportions with the specific antigen and with complement. The\r\nantigen is an extract of a diseased organ (syphilitic fetal liver,\r\nin syphilis), a suspension of the known bacteria, or an extract of\r\nthese bacteria. Complement is usually derived from a guinea-pig,\r\nsince the serum of this animal is higher in complement than that\r\nof most animals. The blood of the gray rat contains practically as\r\nmuch. If the specific amboceptor is present, that is, if the animal\r\nis infected with the suspected disease, the complement will unite\r\nwith the antigen-amboceptor system and be “fixed,” that is, be no\r\nlonger capable of uniting with any other amboceptor-antigen system. No\r\nchemical or physical means of telling whether this union has occurred\r\nor not, except as given below, has been discovered as yet, though\r\ndoubtless will be by physico-chemical tests, nor can the combination\r\nbe seen. Hence an “indicator,” as is so frequently used in chemistry,\r\nis put into the mixture of antigen-amboceptor-complement after it has\r\nbeen allowed to stand in the incubator for one-half to one hour to\r\npermit the union to become complete. The “indicator” used is a mixture\r\nof sheep’s corpuscles and the heated (“inactivated”) blood serum of\r\na rabbit which has been injected with sheep’s blood corpuscles and\r\ntherefore contains a _hemolytic amboceptor specific_ for the corpuscles\r\nwhich is capable also of uniting with complement. The indicator is\r\nput into the first mixture and the whole is again incubated and\r\nexamined. If the mixture is _clear_ and _colorless_ with a _deposit\r\nof red corpuscles_ at the bottom, that would mean that the complement\r\nhad been bound to the first complex, since it was not free to unite\r\nwith the second sheep’s corpuscles (antigen)--rabbit serum (hemolytic\r\namboceptor) complex--and destroy the corpuscles. Hence if the\r\ncomplement is bound in the first instance, the _specific amboceptor_\r\nfor the first antigen must have been present in the blood, that is, the\r\nanimal was infected with the organism in question. Such a reaction is\r\ncalled a “positive” test.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the final solution is _clear_ but of a _red_\r\ncolor, that would mean that complement must have united with the\r\ncorpuscles--hemolytic amboceptor system--and destroyed the corpuscles\r\nin order to cause the _clear red_ solution of hemoglobin. If complement\r\nunited with this system it could not have united with the first system,\r\nhence there was no _specific amboceptor_ there to bind it; no specific\r\namboceptor in the animal’s blood, means no infection. Hence a _red\r\nsolution_ is a “negative test.”\r\n\r\nThe scheme for the test may be outlined as follows:\r\n\r\n  Antigen         +  Patient’s Serum, heated  +  Complement\r\n  (specific for      (unknown amboceptor)        (derived from\r\n  the amboceptor                                 guinea pig’s serum)\r\n  sought)\r\n\r\nIncubate one-half hour in a water bath or one hour in an incubator.\r\n\r\nThen add the indicator which is\r\n\r\n  Antigen                 +  Amboceptor\r\n  (red blood corpuscles)     (for corpuscles, serum of\r\n                             a rabbit immunized against\r\n                             the red corpuscles)\r\n\r\nIncubate as above.\r\n\r\nIn practice all the different ingredients must be accurately tested,\r\nstandardized and used in exact quantities, and tests must also be run\r\nas controls with a known normal blood of an animal of the same species\r\nas the one examined and with a known positive blood.\r\n\r\n  It should be stated that in one variety of the Complement-Fixation\r\n  Test, namely, the “Wassermann Test for Syphilis” in human beings,\r\n  an antigen is used which is not derived from the specific organism\r\n  (_Treponema pallidum_) which causes the disease nor even from\r\n  syphilitic tissue. It has been determined that alcohol will extract\r\n  from certain tissues, _human or animal_, substances which _act\r\n  specifically_ in combining with the syphilitic amboceptor present\r\n  in the blood. Alcoholic extracts of beef heart are most commonly\r\n  used. Details of this test may be learned in the advanced course in\r\n  Immunity and Serum Therapy.\r\n\r\nThe complement-fixation test might be applied to the determination\r\nof unknown bacteria, using the unknown culture as antigen and trying\r\nit with the sera of different animals immunized against a variety\r\nof organisms, some one of which might prove to furnish _specific\r\namboceptor_ for the unknown organism and hence indicate what it is. The\r\ntest used in this way has not been shown to be a practical necessity\r\nand hence is rarely employed. It has been used, however, to detect\r\ntraces of unknown proteins, particularly blood-serum proteins, in\r\nmedico-legal cases in exactly the above outlined manner and is very\r\ndelicate and accurate.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nPHAGOCYTOSIS--OPSONINS.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been mentioned that Metchnikoff, in a publication in 1883,\r\nattempted to explain immunity on a purely cellular basis. It has\r\nbeen known since Haeckel’s first observation in 1858 that certain of\r\nthe white corpuscles do engulf solid particles that may get into the\r\nbody, and among them bacteria. Metchnikoff at first thought that this\r\nengulfing and subsequent intracellular digestion of the microörganisms\r\nwere sufficient to protect the body from infection. The later\r\ndiscoveries (discussed in considering Ehrlich’s theory of immunity)\r\nof substances present in the blood serum and even in the blood plasma\r\nwhich either destroy the bacteria or neutralize their action have\r\ncaused Metchnikoff to modify his theory to a great extent. He admitted\r\nthe presence of these substances, though giving them other names,\r\nbut ascribed their formation to the phagocytes or to the same organs\r\nwhich form the leukocytes--lymphoid tissue generally, bone marrow. It\r\nis not within the province of this work to attempt to reconcile these\r\ntheories, but it may be well to point out that Ehrlich’s theory is one\r\nof _chemical substances_ and that the _origin_ of these substances is\r\nnot an _essential_ part of the theory, so that the two theories, except\r\nin some minor details, are not necessarily mutually exclusive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE V\r\n\r\nELIE METCHNIKOFF]\r\n\r\nSir A. E. Wright and Douglas, in 1903, showed that even in those\r\ninstances where immunity depends on phagocytosis, as it certainly does\r\nin many cases, the phagocytes are more or less inactive unless they are\r\naided by chemical substances present in the blood. These substances\r\n_act on the bacteria, not on the leukocytes_, and change them in such\r\na way that they are more readily taken up by the phagocytes. Wright\r\nproposed for these bodies the name _opsonin_, derived from a Greek\r\nword signifying “to prepare a meal for.” Neufeld and Rimpau at about\r\nthe same time (1904), in studying immune sera, observed substances of\r\nsimilar action in these sera and proposed the name _bacteriotropins_,\r\nor bacteriotropic substances. There is scarcely a doubt that the two\r\nnames are applied to identical substances and that Wright’s name\r\n_opsonin_ should have preference.\r\n\r\nThe chemical nature of opsonins is not certainly determined, but they\r\nappear to be a distinct class of antibodies and to possess two groups,\r\na combining or haptophore and a preparing or opsonic group and hence\r\nare similar to antibodies of Ehrlich’s second order--agglutinins and\r\nprecipitins. Wright also showed that opsonins are just as specific as\r\nagglutinins are--that is, a micrococcus opsonin prepares micrococci\r\nonly for phagocytosis and not streptococci or any other bacteria.\r\n\r\nWright showed that opsonins for many bacteria are present in normal\r\nserum and that in the serum of an animal which has been immunized\r\nagainst such bacteria the opsonins are _increased_ in amount. Also\r\nthat in a person infected with certain bacteria the opsonins are\r\neither increased or diminished, depending on whether the progress of\r\nthe infection is favorable or unfavorable. The _opsonic power_ of a\r\nserum normal or otherwise is determined by mixing an emulsion of fresh\r\nleukocytes in normal saline solution with a suspension of the bacteria\r\nand with the serum to be tested. The leukocytes must first be washed in\r\nseveral changes of normal salt solution to free them from any adherent\r\nplasma or serum. The mixture is incubated for about fifteen minutes\r\nand then slides are made, stained with a good differential blood\r\nstain, Wright’s or other, and the average number of bacteria taken up\r\nby at least fifty phagocytes taken in order in a field is determined\r\nby counting under the microscope. The number so obtained Wright calls\r\nthe _phagocytic index_ of the serum tested. The phagocytic index of a\r\ngiven serum divided by the phagocytic index of a normal serum gives\r\nthe _opsonic index_ of the serum tested. Assuming the normal opsonic\r\nindex to be 1, Wright asserts that in healthy individuals the range\r\nshould be not more than from 0.8 to 1.2, and that an index below 0.8\r\nmay show a great susceptibility for the organism tested, infection with\r\nthe given organism if derived from the individual, or improper dosage\r\nin case attempts have been made to immunize by using killed cultures,\r\nvaccines, of the organism.\r\n\r\nOn the occasion of the author’s visit to Wright’s clinic (1911) he\r\nstated that he used the determination of the _opsonic index_ chiefly as\r\na _guide to the dosage_ in the use of vaccines.\r\n\r\nMost workers outside the Wright school have failed to recognize any\r\nessential value of determinations of the opsonic index in the use\r\nof vaccines. Some of the reasons for this are as follows: The limit\r\nof error in phagocytic counts may be as great as 50 per cent. in\r\ndifferent series of fifty, hence several hundred must be counted, which\r\nadds greatly to the tediousness and time involved; the variation in\r\napparently healthy individuals is frequently great, hence the “normal”\r\nis too uncertain; finally the opsonic index and the clinical course of\r\nthe disease do not by any means run parallel. Undoubtedly the method\r\nhas decided value in the hands of an individual who makes opsonic\r\ndeterminations his chief work, as Wright’s assistants do, but it can\r\nscarcely be maintained at the present time that such determinations\r\nare necessary in vaccine therapy. Nevertheless that opsonins actually\r\nexist and that they play an essential part in phagocytosis, and hence\r\nin immunity, is now generally recognized.\r\n\r\n\r\nBACTERIAL VACCINES.\r\n\r\nWhether determinations of opsonic index are useful or not is largely\r\na matter of individual opinion, but there is scarcely room to doubt\r\nthat Wright has conferred a lasting benefit by his revival of the\r\nuse of _dead cultures of bacteria_, _bacterial vaccines_, both for\r\nprotective inoculation and for treatment. It is perhaps better to use\r\nthe older terms “vaccination” and “vaccine” (though the cow, _vacca_,\r\nis not concerned) than to use Wright’s term “opsonic method” in this\r\nconnection, bearing in mind that the idea of a vaccine is that it\r\ncontains the _causative organism_ of the infection as indicated on p.\r\n253.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1880 Touissant proposed the use of dead cultures of\r\nbacteria to produce immunity. But because injections of such cultures\r\nwere so frequently followed by abscess formation, doubtless due to\r\nthe _high temperatures_ used to kill the bacteria, the method was\r\nabandoned. Further, Pasteur and the French school persistently denied\r\nthe possibility of success with such a procedure, and some of them\r\neven maintain this attitude at the present time. The successes of\r\nWright and the English school which are being repeated so generally\r\nwherever properly attempted, leave no doubt in the unprejudiced of the\r\nvery great value of the method and have unquestionably opened a most\r\npromising field both for preventive inoculation and for treatment in\r\nmany infectious diseases. That the practice is no more universally\r\napplicable than are immune serums and that it has been and is still\r\nbeing grossly overexploited is undoubted.\r\n\r\nThe use of a vaccine is based on two fundamental principles. The first\r\nof these is that the cell introduced must not be in a condition to\r\ncause serious injury to the animal by its multiplication and consequent\r\nelaboration of injurious substances. The second is that, on the other\r\nhand, it must contain antigens in such condition that they will act as\r\nstimuli to the body cells to produce the necessary antibodies, whether\r\nthese be opsonins, bactericidal substances, or anti-endotoxins. In the\r\nintroduction of living organisms there is always more or less risk\r\nof the organism not being sufficiently attenuated and hence of the\r\npossibility of its producing too severe an infection. In using killed\r\ncultures, great care must be exercised in destroying the organisms,\r\n_so that the antigens are not at the same time rendered inactive_.\r\nHence in the preparation of bacterial vaccines by Wright’s method the\r\n_temperature and the length of time used to kill the bacteria are most\r\nimportant factors_. This method is in general to grow the organisms\r\non an agar medium, rub off the culture and emulsify in sterile normal\r\nsalt solution (0.85 per cent. NaCl). The number of bacteria per cc.\r\nis determined by staining a slide made from a small volume of the\r\nemulsion mixed with an equal volume of human blood drawn from the\r\nfinger and counting the relative number of bacteria and of red blood\r\ncorpuscles. Since the corpuscles are normally 5,000,000 per c.mm.,\r\na simple calculation gives the number of bacteria. The emulsion of\r\nbacteria is then diluted so that a certain number of millions shall\r\nbe contained in each cc., “standardized” as it is called, then heated\r\nto the proper temperature for the necessary time and it is ready for\r\nuse. A preservative, as 0.5 per cent. phenol, tricresol, etc., is added\r\nunless the vaccine is to be used up at once. The amounts of culture,\r\nsalt solution, etc., vary with the purpose for which the vaccine is to\r\nbe used, from one or two agar slant cultures and a few cc. of solution,\r\nwhen a single animal is to be treated, to bulk agar cultures and liters\r\nof solution as in preparing antityphoid vaccine on a large scale.\r\n\r\nAgar surface cultures are used so that there will be as little\r\nadmixture of foreign protein as possible (see Anaphylaxis, p. 289 _et\r\nseq._). Normal saline solution is isotonic with the body cells and\r\nhence is employed as the vehicle.\r\n\r\n=Lipovaccines.=--The suspension of bacteria in neutral oil was first\r\nused by Le Moignac and Pinoy who gave the name “lipovaccines” (λιπος\r\n= fat) to them. It was claimed that the reaction following injection\r\nof these vaccines was less severe than with saline vaccines in many\r\ninstances; also, that the bacteria were much more slowly absorbed. For\r\nthese two reasons it was hoped that much larger numbers of bacteria\r\ncould be injected at one dose and one injection would suffice instead\r\nof three or more as ordinarily used. The technique of preparation,\r\nstandardization and killing of the organisms has not as yet been\r\nsufficiently well established to warrant the general substitution of\r\nlipovaccines for ordinary saline suspensions.\r\n\r\nVaccines are either “_autogenous_” or “_stock_.” An “autogenous”\r\nvaccine is a vaccine that is made from bacteria derived from the\r\nindividual or animal which it is desired to vaccinate and contains\r\nnot only the particular organism but the particular strain of that\r\norganism which is responsible for the lesion. Stock vaccines are\r\nmade up from organisms like the infective agent in a given case but\r\nderived from some other person or animal or from laboratory cultures.\r\nCommercial vaccines are “stock” vaccines and are usually “polyvalent”\r\nor even “mixed.” A “polyvalent” vaccine contains several strains of the\r\ninfective agent and a “mixed” contains several different organisms.\r\n\r\nStock vaccines have shown their value when used as preventive\r\ninoculations, notably so in typhoid fever in man, anthrax and black-leg\r\nin cattle. The author is strongly of the opinion, not only from the\r\nextended literature on the subject, but also from his own experience\r\nin animal, and especially in human cases, that stock vaccines are\r\nmuch inferior and much more uncertain in their action when used in\r\nthe _treatment_ of an infection, than are autogenous vaccines. This\r\napplies particularly to those instances in which _pneumococci_,\r\n_streptococci_, _micrococci_, and _colon bacilli_ are the causative\r\nagents but to others as well. The following are some of the reasons for\r\nthis opinion: The above organisms are notoriously extremely variable in\r\ntheir virulence. While there is no necessarily close connection between\r\nvirulence and antigenic property, yet since virulence is so variable,\r\nit is rational to assume that antigenic property is also extremely\r\nvariable. Individuals vary just as much in susceptibility and hence in\r\nreactive power, and generally speaking, an individual will react better\r\nin the production of antibodies to a stimulus to which he has been more\r\nor less subjected, _i.e._, to organisms derived from his own body.\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of a vaccine great care must be used in heating so\r\nthat the organisms are killed, but the _antigens_ are not destroyed.\r\nMany of the enzymes present in bacteria, especially the proteolytic\r\nones, are not any more sensitive to heat than are the antigens, hence\r\nare not destroyed entirely. Therefore a vaccine kept in stock for a\r\nlong time gradually has some of its antigens destroyed by the uninjured\r\nenzymes present with them, and so loses in potency. Therefore in\r\ntreating a given infection it is well to make up a vaccine from the\r\nlesion, use three or four doses and if more are necessary make up a new\r\nvaccine.\r\n\r\nIf the above statements are borne in mind and vaccines are made and\r\nadministered accordingly, the author is well satisfied that much better\r\nresults will be secured.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with the theory on which the use of vaccines is based,\r\n_i.e._, that they stimulate the body cells to produce immunizing\r\nantibodies, it is clear that they are especially suitable in those\r\ninfections in which the process is _localized_ and should not be of\r\nmuch value in _general_ infections. In the latter case the cells of\r\nthe body are stimulated to produce antibodies by the circulating\r\norganisms, probably nearly to their limit, hence the introduction of\r\nmore of the same organisms, capable of stimulating though dead, is apt\r\nto overtax the cells and do more harm than good. It is not possible to\r\ntell accurately when this limit is reached, but the clinical symptoms\r\nare a guide. If vaccines are used at all in general infections they\r\nshould be given in the early stages and in small doses at first with\r\nclose watch as to the effect. In localized infections only the cells in\r\nthe immediate neighborhood are much stimulated, hence the introduction\r\nof a vaccine calls to their aid cells in the body generally, and much\r\nmore of the resulting antibodies are carried to the lesion in question.\r\nManifestly surgical procedures such as incision, drainage, washing\r\naway of dead and necrotic tissue with normal saline solution, not\r\nnecessarily antiseptics, will aid the antibodies in their action and\r\nare to be recommended where indicated.\r\n\r\nIn the practical application of any remedy the _dosage_ is most\r\nimportant. Unfortunately there is no accurate method of determining\r\nthis with a vaccine. Wright recommended determining the number of\r\nthe organisms per cc. as before mentioned, and his method or some\r\nmodification of it is still in general use. From what was said with\r\nregard to variation, both in organisms and in individuals, it can\r\nbe seen that the number of organisms is at least only a very rough\r\nguide. This is further illustrated by the doses of micrococcus\r\n(staphylococcus) vaccines recommended by different writers, which\r\nvary from 50,000,000 to 2,000,000,000 per cc. The author is decidedly\r\nof the opinion that _there is no way of determining the dosage of\r\na vaccine in the treatment of any given case except by the result\r\nof the first dose_. Hence it is his practice to make vaccines of a\r\nparticular organism of the same approximate strength, and to give a\r\ndose of a measured portion of a cubic centimeter, judging the amount\r\nby what the individual or animal can apparently withstand, without too\r\nviolent a reaction. If there is no local or general reaction or if it\r\nis very slight and there is no effect on the lesion, the dose is too\r\nsmall. If there is a violent local reaction with severe constitutional\r\nsymptoms clinically, and the lesion appears worse, the dose is too\r\nlarge. There should be some local reaction and some general, but not\r\nenough to cause more than a slight disturbance, easy to judge in human\r\nsubjects, more difficult in animals. In cases suitable for vaccine\r\ntreatment no _serious_ results should follow from a properly prepared\r\nvaccine, though the process of healing may be delayed temporarily.\r\nWright claimed, and many have substantiated him, that always following\r\na vaccination there is a period when the resistance of the animal is\r\ndiminished. This is called the “negative phase,” and Wright considered\r\nthis to last as long as the opsonic index remained low, and when this\r\nlatter began to increase the stage of the “positive” or favorable phase\r\nwas reached. As has been stated the opsonic index is pretty generally\r\nregarded as of doubtful value, though the existence of a period of\r\nlowered resistance is theoretically probable from the fact that\r\nantibodies already present in the blood will be partially used up in\r\nuniting with the vaccine introduced and that the body cells are called\r\nupon suddenly to do an extra amount of work and it takes them some time\r\nto adapt themselves. This time, the “negative phase,” is much better\r\ndetermined by the clinical symptoms, general and especially local. It\r\nis good practice to begin with a dose relatively small. The result\r\nof this is an indication of the proper dosage and also prepares the\r\npatient for a larger one. The second dose should follow the first not\r\nsooner than three or four days, and should be five to seven days if the\r\nfirst reaction is severe. These directions are not very definite, but\r\nclinical experience to date justifies them. It is worth the time and\r\nmoney to one who wishes to use vaccines to learn from one who has had\r\nexperience both in making and administering them, and then to remember\r\nthat each patient is an individual case, for the use of vaccines as\r\nwell as for any other kind of treatment.\r\n\r\n\r\nAGGRESSIN.\r\n\r\nOpsonins have been shown to be specific substances which act on\r\nbacteria in such a way as to render them more readily taken up by the\r\nleukocytes. By analogy one might expect to find bacteria secreting\r\nspecific substances which would tend to counteract the destructive\r\naction of the phagocytes and bactericidal substances. Bail and his\r\nco-workers claim to have demonstrated such substances in exudates in\r\ncertain diseases and have given the distinctive name “aggressins” to\r\nthem. By injecting an animal with “aggressins,” antiaggressins are\r\nproduced which counteract their effects and thus enable the bacteria to\r\nbe destroyed. The existence of such specific bodies is not generally\r\naccepted as proved. The prevailing idea is that bacteria protect\r\nthemselves in any given case by the various toxic substances that they\r\nproduce, and that “aggressins” as a special class of substances are not\r\nformed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nANAPHYLAXIS.\r\n\r\n\r\nDallera, in 1874, and a number of physiologists of that period,\r\nobserved peculiar skin eruptions following the transfusion of blood,\r\nthat is, the introduction of foreign proteins. In the years subsequent\r\nto the introduction of diphtheria antitoxin (1890) characteristic\r\n“serum rashes” were not infrequently reported, sometimes accompanied by\r\nmore or less severe general symptoms and occasionally death--a train of\r\nphenomena to which the name “serum sickness” was later applied, since\r\nit was shown that it was the horse serum (foreign protein) that was\r\nthe cause, and not the antitoxin itself. In 1898 Richet and Hericourt\r\nnoticed that some of the dogs which they were attempting to immunize\r\nagainst toxic eel serum not only were not immunized but suffered even\r\nmore severely after the second injection. They obtained similar results\r\nwith an extract of mussels which contain a toxin. Richet gave the name\r\n“anaphylaxis” (“no protection”) to this phenomenon to distinguish it\r\nfrom immunity or prophylaxis (protection).\r\n\r\nAll the above-mentioned observations led to no special investigations\r\nas to their cause. In 1903, Arthus noticed abscess formation,\r\nnecrosis and sloughing following several injections of horse serum\r\nin immediately adjacent parts of the skin in rabbits (“Arthus’\r\nphenomenon”). Theobald Smith, in 1904, observed the death of\r\nguinea-pigs following properly spaced injections of horse serum. This\r\nsubject was investigated by Otto and by Rosenau and Anderson in this\r\ncountry and about the same time von Pirquet and Schick were making a\r\nstudy of serum rashes mentioned above. The publications of these men\r\nled to a widespread study of the subject of injections of foreign\r\nproteins. It is now a well-established fact that the injection into an\r\nanimal of a foreign protein--vegetable, animal or bacterial, simple or\r\ncomplex--followed by a second injection after a proper length of time\r\nleads to a series of symptoms indicating poisoning, which may be so\r\nsevere as to cause the death of the animal. Richet’s term “anaphylaxis”\r\nhas been applied to the condition of the animal following the first\r\ninjection and indicates that it is in a condition of supersensitiveness\r\nfor the protein in question. The animal is said to be “sensitized”\r\nfor that protein.[25] The sensitization is specific since an animal\r\ninjected with white of chicken’s egg reacts to a second injection of\r\nchicken’s egg only and not pigeon’s egg or blood serum or any other\r\nprotein. The specific poisonous substance causing the symptoms has\r\nbeen called “anaphylotoxin” though what it is, is still a matter of\r\ninvestigation. It is evident that some sort of an antibody results from\r\nthe first protein injected and that it is specific for its own antigen.\r\n\r\nA period of ten days is usually the minimum time that must elapse\r\nbetween the first and second injections in guinea-pigs in order that a\r\nreaction may result, though a large primary dose requires much longer.\r\nIf the second injection is made within less time no effect follows,\r\nand after three or more injections at intervals of about one week the\r\nanimal fails to react at all, it has become “immune” to the protein.\r\nFurthermore, after an animal has been sensitized by one injection and\r\nhas reacted to a second, then, if it does not die from the reaction, it\r\nfails to react to subsequent injections. In this latter case it is said\r\nto be “antianaphylactic.”\r\n\r\nIt must be remembered that proteins do not normally get into the\r\ncirculation except by way of the alimentary tract. Here all proteins\r\nthat are absorbed are first broken down to their constituent\r\namino-acids, absorbed as such and these are built up into the proteins\r\ncharacteristic of the animal’s blood. Hence when protein as such gets\r\ninto the blood it is a foreign substance to be disposed of. The blood\r\ncontains proteolytic enzymes for certain proteins normally. It is\r\nalso true that the body cells possess the property of digesting the\r\nproteins of the blood and building them up again into those which are\r\ncharacteristic of the cell. Hence it appears rational to assume that\r\nthe foreign proteins act as stimuli to certain cells to produce more\r\nof the enzymes necessary to decompose them, so that they may be either\r\nbuilt up into cell structure or eliminated as waste. If in this process\r\nof splitting up of protein a poison were produced, then the phenomena\r\nof “anaphylaxis” could be better understood. As a matter of fact\r\nVaughan and his co-workers have shown that by artificially splitting\r\nup proteins from many different sources--animal, vegetable, pathogenic\r\nand saprophytic bacteria--a poison _is produced_ which appears to be\r\nthe same in all cases and which causes the symptoms characteristic of\r\nanaphylaxis. On the basis of these facts it is seen that anaphylaxis\r\nis simply another variety of immunity. The _specific antibody_ in\r\nthis case is an _enzyme_ which decomposes the protein instead of\r\nprecipitating it. The enzyme must be specific for the protein since\r\nthese differ in constitution. Vaughan even goes so far as to say that\r\nthe poison is really the central ring common to all proteins and that\r\nthey differ only in the lateral groups or side chains attached to this\r\ncentral nucleus. The action of the enzyme in this connection would be\r\nto split off the side chains, and since these are the specific parts of\r\nthe protein, the enzyme must be specific for each protein. The pepsin\r\nof the gastric juice and the trypsin of the pancreas split the native\r\nproteins only to peptones. As is well known, these when injected in\r\nsufficient quantity give rise to poisonous symptoms, and will also\r\ngive rise to anaphylaxis under properly spaced injections. They do not\r\npoison normally because they are split by the intestinal erepsin to\r\namino-acids and absorbed as such. Whether Vaughan’s theory of protein\r\nstructure is the true one or not remains to be demonstrated. It is\r\nnot essential to the theory of anaphylaxis above outlined, _i.e._,\r\na phenomenon due to the action of specific _antibodies_ which are\r\nenzymes. On physiological grounds this appears the most rational of the\r\nfew explanations of anaphylaxis that have been offered and was taught\r\nby the author before he had read Vaughan’s theory along the same lines.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of the author’s theory the phenomena of protein immunity\r\nand antianaphylaxis may be explained in the following way which the\r\nauthor has not seen presented. The enzymes necessary to decompose the\r\ninjected protein are present in certain cells and are formed in larger\r\namount by those cells to meet the increased demand due to injection\r\nof an excess of protein. They are retained in the cell for a time at\r\nleast. If a second dose of protein is given before the enzymes are\r\nexcreted from the cells as waste, this is digested within the cells in\r\nthe normal manner. If a third dose is given, the cells adapt themselves\r\nto this increased intracellular digestion and it thus becomes normal\r\nto them. Hence the _immunity_ is due to this increased intracellular\r\ndigestion.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the second injection is delayed long enough, then\r\nthe _excess_ enzyme, but not all, is excreted from the cells and meets\r\nthe second dose of protein in the blood stream and rapidly decomposes\r\nit there, so that more or less intoxication from the split products\r\nresults. This uses up _excess_ enzyme, hence subsequent injections are\r\nnot digested in the blood stream but within the cells as before. So\r\nthat “antianaphylaxis” is dependent on the exhaustion of the excess\r\nenzyme in the blood, and the condition is _fundamentally_ the same as\r\nprotein immunity, _i.e._, due to _intracellular_ digestion in each case.\r\n\r\nAs has been indicated “serum sickness” and sudden death following\r\nserum injections are probably due to a sensitization of the individual\r\nto the proteins of the horse in some unknown way. Probably hay fever\r\nurticarial rashes and idiosyncrasies following the ingestion of certain\r\nfoods--strawberries, eggs, oysters, etc., are anaphylactic phenomena.\r\n\r\nIn medical practice the reaction is used as a means of diagnosis in\r\ncertain diseases, such as the tuberculin test in tuberculosis, the\r\nmallein test in glanders. The individual or animal with tuberculosis\r\nbecomes sensitized to certain proteins of the tubercle bacillus and\r\nwhen these proteins in the form of tuberculin are introduced into the\r\nbody a reaction results, local or general, according to the method of\r\nintroduction. The practical facts in connection with the tuberculin\r\ntest are also in harmony with the author’s theory of anaphylaxis\r\nas above outlined. Milder cases of tuberculosis give more vigorous\r\nreactions because the intracellular enzymes are not used up rapidly\r\nenough since the products of the bacillus are secreted slowly in such\r\ncases. Hence excess of enzyme is free in the blood and the injection of\r\nthe tuberculin meets it there and a vigorous reaction results. In old,\r\nfar-advanced cases, no reaction occurs, because the enzymes are all\r\nused in decomposing the large amount of tuberculous protein constantly\r\npresent in the blood. The fact that an animal which has once reacted\r\nfails to do so until several months afterward likewise depends on the\r\nfact that the _excess_ enzyme is used in the reaction and time must\r\nelapse for a further excess to accumulate.\r\n\r\nThe anaphylactic reaction has been made use of in the identification of\r\nvarious types of proteins and is of very great value since the reaction\r\nis so delicate, particularly when guinea-pigs are used as test animals.\r\nWells has detected the 0.000,001 g. of protein by this test. It is\r\nevident that the test is applicable in medico-legal cases and in food\r\nexamination and has been so used.\r\n\r\n\r\nA TABULATION OF ANTIGENS AND ANTIBODIES AS AT PRESENT RECOGNIZED.\r\n\r\n                                                                CLASS OF\r\n ANTIGEN         ANTIBODY         ACTION OF ANTIBODY            RECEPTOR\r\n\r\n Toxin           Antitoxin        Combines with toxin and             I.\r\n                                    hence prevents toxin\r\n                                    from uniting with a\r\n                                    cell and injuring it,\r\n                                    _i.e._, neutralizes toxin.\r\n\r\n Enzyme          Antienzyme       Combines with enzyme                I.\r\n                                    and thus prevents enzyme\r\n                                    from uniting\r\n                                    with anything else and\r\n                                    showing its action, _i.e._,\r\n                                    neutralizes enzyme.\r\n\r\n Solution of     Precipitin       Unites with its antigen            II.\r\n   protein                          and causes its precipitation\r\n                                    from solution.\r\n\r\n Solution of          ?

The actual factors so far as at\r\npresent known may be summarized as follows:\r\n\r\n1. _Antitoxins_ which neutralize true toxins; shown to exist for very\r\nfew diseases.\r\n\r\n2. _Cytolytic substances_ which destroy the invading organism: in\r\nreality two substances; amboceptor, which is specific, and complement,\r\nthe real dissolving enzyme.\r\n\r\n3. _Phagocytosis_ or the destruction of the invading organisms within\r\nthe leukocytes.\r\n\r\n4. _Opsonins_ which render the bacteria more readily taken up by the\r\nphagocytes.\r\n\r\n5. _Enzymes_ other than complement possibly play a part in the\r\ndestruction of some pathogenic organisms or their products. This\r\nremains to be more definitely established.\r\n\r\n6. It is possible that in natural immunity there might be no receptors\r\nin the body cells to take up the organisms or their products, or the\r\nreceptors might be present in certain cells but of a very low chemical\r\naffinity, so that combination does not occur. It is even highly\r\nprobable that many substances formed by invading organisms which might\r\ninjure specialized cells, such as those of glandular, nervous or muscle\r\ntissue, have a more rapid rate of reaction with, or a stronger affinity\r\nfor, lower unspecialized cells, such as connective and lymphoid tissue,\r\nand unite with these so that their effects are not noticed.\r\n\r\nThe importance of these different, factors varies in different diseases\r\nand need not be considered in this connection.\r\n\r\nThe question “which of the body cells are engaged in the production\r\nof antibodies” is not uncommonly asked. On physiological grounds it\r\nwould not seem reasonable that the highly specialized tissues above\r\nmentioned could take up this work, even though they are the ones which\r\nsuffer the greatest injury in disease. Hence it is to be expected that\r\nthe lower or unspecialized cells are the source, and it has been shown\r\nthat the antibodies are produced by the phagocytes (though not entirely\r\nas Metchnikoff maintained), by lymphoid tissue generally, by the bone\r\nmarrow and also by connective-tissue cells, though in varying degrees.\r\n\r\nSince immunity depends on the activity of the body cells it is evident\r\nthat one of the very best methods for avoiding infectious diseases is\r\nto keep these cells up to their highest state of efficiency, to keep in\r\n“good health.” Hence good health means not only _freedom from disease_\r\nbut also _protection against disease_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF LABORATORY EXERCISES GIVEN IN CONNECTION WITH THE CLASS WORK\r\nINCLUDED IN THIS TEXT-BOOK.\r\n\r\n  Exercise 1.

A. Blake has called attention to the fact that the “mosquito\r\ntheory” of malaria is mentioned in a Sanscrit manuscript of about the\r\n6th century A.D.\r\n\r\n[2] Myxomycetes excepted, and they are probably to be regarded as\r\nanimals--Mycetozoa.\r\n\r\n[3] Centralblatt f. Bakteriologie, etc. LXIII. 1 Abt. Orig. 1912, 4,\r\nidem LXVI. 1 Abt. Orig. 1912, 323.\r\n\r\n[4] The pronunciation of this word according to English standards\r\nis kok-si; the continental pronunciation is kok-kee; the commonest\r\nAmerican seems to be kok-ki. We prefer the latter since it is easier\r\nand more natural and should like to see it adopted. (Author.)\r\n\r\n[5] With the possible exception of blue green algæ which have been\r\nfound with bacteria in the above-mentioned hot springs. Seeds of\r\nmany plants have been subjected to as low temperatures as those\r\nabove-mentioned without apparent injury.\r\n\r\n[6] It is popularly supposed that in canning fruit, vegetables, meats,\r\netc., all the air must be removed, since the organisms which cause\r\n“spoiling” cannot grow in a vacuum. The existence of anaërobic and\r\nfacultative anaërobic bacteria shows the fallacy of such beliefs.\r\n\r\n[7] “By cellulose is understood a carbohydrate of the general formula\r\nC₆H₁₀O₅ not soluble in water, alcohol, ether, or dilute acids but\r\nsoluble in an ammoniacal solution of copper oxide. It gives with iodine\r\nand sulphuric acid a blue color and with iodine zinc chloride a violet\r\nand yields dextrose on hydrolysis.”--H. Fischer.\r\n\r\n[8] The sulphur bacteria are partially prototrophic for S; probably the\r\niron bacteria also for Fe. Some few soil bacteria have been shown to\r\nbe capable of utilizing free H, and it seems certain that the bacteria\r\nassociated with the spontaneous heating of coal may oxidize free C. So\r\nfar as known no elements other than these six are directly available to\r\nbacteria.\r\n\r\n[9] Only a few kinds of bacteria so far as known are proto-autotrophic.\r\nThe nitrous and nitric organisms of Winogradsky which are so essential\r\nin the soil, and which might have been the first of all organisms so\r\nfar as their food is concerned, and some of the sulphur bacteria are\r\nexamples.\r\n\r\n[10] The term _pathogenic_ is also applied to certain non-parasitic\r\nsaprophytic bacteria whose products cause disease conditions, as one\r\nof the organisms causing a type of food poisoning in man (_Clostridium\r\nbotulinum_), which also probably causes “forage poisoning” in domestic\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n[11] The term “fermentation” was originally used to denote the process\r\nwhich goes on in fruit juices or grain extracts when alcohol and gas\r\nare formed. Later it was extended to apply to the decomposition of\r\nalmost any organic substance. In recent years the attempt has been made\r\nto give a chemical definition to the word by restricting its use to\r\nthose changes in which by virtue of a “wandering” or rearrangement of\r\nthe carbon atoms “new substances are formed which are not constitutents\r\nof the original molecule.” It may be doubted whether this restriction\r\nis justified or necessary. A definition is at present scarcely possible\r\nexcept when the qualifying adjective is included as “alcoholic\r\nfermentation,” “ammoniacal fermentation,” “lactic acid fermentation,”\r\netc.\r\n\r\n[12] See “Oil and Gas in Ohio,” Bownocker: Geological Survey of Ohio,\r\nFourth Series, Bull. I, pp. 313-314.\r\n\r\n[13] It is probable that this is the way “Jack o’lanterns” or “Will o’\r\nthe wisps” are ignited. Marsh gas is produced as above outlined from\r\nthe vegetable and animal matter decomposing in swampy places under\r\nanaërobic conditions and likewise phosphine. These escape into the air\r\nand the “spontaneous combustion” of the phosphine ignites the marsh gas.\r\n\r\n[14] Dr. H. H. Green, of Pretoria, South Africa, has isolated from\r\n“cattle dips” a bacterium that _reduces arsenates_ to _arsenites_.\r\n\r\n[15] Dr. Green (l. c.) has also isolated an organism which causes some\r\ndeterioration of cattle dips by _oxidizing arsenites to arsenates_.\r\n\r\n[16] It will be noted that the names of enzymes (except some of\r\nthose first discovered) terminate in _ase_ which is usually added to\r\nthe _stem of the name of the substance acted on_, though sometimes\r\nto a word which indicates the substance formed by the action, as\r\n_lactacidase_, _alcoholase_.\r\n\r\n[17] Tetanus toxin is about 120 times as poisonous as strychnin, both\r\nof which act on the same kind of nerve cells.\r\n\r\n[18] In the author’s laboratory in the past ten years all sterilization\r\nexcept those few objects in blood and serum work which must be dry, has\r\nbeen done in autoclaves of the type shown in Fig. 81 which are supplied\r\nwith steam from the University central heating plant. A very great\r\nsaving of time is thus secured.\r\n\r\n[19] The author has tested an “electric milk purifier” (Fig. 102)\r\nwhich was as efficient as a first-class pasteurizer and left the milk\r\nin excellent condition both chemically and as far as “cream line” was\r\nconcerned. The cost of operation as compared with steam will depend on\r\nthe price of electricity.\r\n\r\n[20] The exact laboratory details for preparing various media are\r\nnot given in this chapter. It is the object to explain the choice of\r\ndifferent materials and the reasons for the various processes to which\r\nthey are subjected.\r\n\r\n[21] For a discussion of this method of standardization consult the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n  Clark & Lubs--J. Bact., 1917, II, 1-34, 109-136, 191-236.\r\n  Committee Report--Ibid., 1919. IV, 107-132.\r\n  Jones--J. Inf. Dis., 1919, 25, 262-268.\r\n  Fennel & Fisher--Ibid., 444-451.\r\n\r\nAdditional references will be found in these articles.\r\n\r\n[22] Term also applied to the solidification of serum in media: _e.g._,\r\nthe Hiss inulin medium for the differentiation of pneumococci (see\r\ndiplococcus of pneumonia).\r\n\r\n[23] The term “antigen” is also used to designate substances which may\r\ntake the place of what are supposed to be the true antigens in certain\r\ndiagnostic reactions (Chapter XXIX, Complement Fixation Test for\r\nSyphilis).\r\n\r\n[24] If the antitoxin is later concentrated (see last paragraph in\r\nthis chapter) a serum containing as little as 175 units per cc. may be\r\ncommercially profitable.\r\n\r\n[25] Tho term “allergie” was introduced by Von Pirquet to designate the\r\nstate of the animal’s being sensitized and “allergic” as the adjective\r\nderived therefrom. It does not seem to the author that there is any\r\nadvantage gained by the introduction of these terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  A\r\n\r\n  ABBÉ, 17\r\n    condenser, 200\r\n

This is a printer’s error: no pages are missing.\r\n\r\nThe descriptive chart insert has been moved from between pages 216 and\r\n217 to the end of the book.\r\n\r\nThe following changes have also been made:\r\n\r\n  Page 26: ‘this scourge which had devastated’\r\n  for ‘this scourge which had devasted’\r\n\r\n  Page 30: ‘to be the cause of a disease in cabbage,’\r\n  [added comma]\r\n\r\n  Page 32: ‘alcoholic, lactic and butyric’\r\n  for ‘alcoholic, lactic and butryic’\r\n\r\n  Page 32: ‘however, workers busied themselves’\r\n  for ‘however, workers, busied themselves’ [deleted extra comma]\r\n\r\n  Page 56: ‘Fig. 43.--Streptobacillus’\r\n  for ‘Fig. 43.--Steptobacillus’\r\n\r\n  Page 57: ‘from a genus of algæ’\r\n  for ‘from a genus of algae’\r\n\r\n  Page 58: ‘staphylococcus--irregular’\r\n  for ‘staphylococcus--irrgular’\r\n\r\n  Page 59: ‘so that it is impossible’\r\n  for ‘so that is is impossible’\r\n\r\n  Page 62: ‘Illustrates the genus Spirochæta’\r\n  for ‘Illustrates the genus Spirochaeta’\r\n\r\n  Page 63: ‘since it is without a sheath’\r\n  for ‘since it is without a a sheath’\r\n\r\n  Page 64: ‘Corynebacterium diphtheriæ’\r\n  for ‘Corynebacterium diphtheriae’\r\n\r\n  Page 67: ‘Prazmowski, 1880; anaërobic’\r\n  for ‘Prazmowski, 1880; anaerobic’\r\n\r\n  Page 70: ‘growth processes involving oxidation’\r\n  for ‘growth processes involving oxidadation’\r\n\r\n  Page 70: ‘EE--Anaërobes, rods swollen at sporulation’\r\n  for ‘EE--Anaerobes, rods swollen at sporulation’\r\n\r\n  Page 73: ‘percentage of water is permissible’\r\n  for ‘percentage of water is permissable’\r\n\r\n  Page 95: ‘Material taken from the bottom’\r\n  for ‘Material taken from the botton’\r\n\r\n  Page 102: ‘large-moleculed and not diffusible’\r\n  for ‘large-moleculed and not diffusable’\r\n\r\n  Page 104: ‘various kinds of “meat poisoning,”’\r\n  for ‘various kinds of “meat posisoning,”’\r\n\r\n  Page 106: ‘formed under anaërobic conditions’\r\n  for ‘formed under anaerobic conditions’\r\n\r\n  Page 110: ‘volatile fatty acids, ethereal’\r\n  for ‘volatile fatty acids, etheral’\r\n\r\n  Page 127: ‘but in much larger doses’\r\n  for ‘but in much large doses’\r\n\r\n  Page 131: ‘“antiseptic” may become a disinfectant’\r\n  for ‘“antiseptic” may become a disfectant’\r\n\r\n  Page 141: ‘quarantine station barge’\r\n  for ‘quaratine station barge’\r\n\r\n  Page 147: ‘A continuous milk pasteurizer.’\r\n  for ‘A continuous milk pastuerizer.’\r\n\r\n  Page 163: ‘especially when a large amount of material’\r\n  for ‘expecially when a large amount of material’\r\n\r\n  Page 179: ‘these must be sterilized’\r\n  for ‘these must be steriliized’\r\n\r\n  Page 191: ‘Deep tubes showing anaërobic’\r\n  for ‘Deep tubes showing anaerobic’\r\n\r\n  Page 193: ‘less than one-twentieth of platinum’\r\n  for ‘less than one-twentieth of platimum’\r\n\r\n  Page 207: ‘grease-free cloth, handkerchief’\r\n  for ‘grease-free cloth, handerchief’\r\n\r\n  Page 210: ‘Stain with Löffler’s blue’\r\n  for ‘Stain with Löffller’s blue’\r\n\r\n  Page 211: ‘slide to cause precipitates’\r\n  for ‘slide to cause preciptates’\r\n\r\n  Page 213: ‘grows at body temperature (37°)’\r\n  [added closing parenthesis]\r\n\r\n  Page 217: ‘working on a revision’\r\n  for ‘working on a revission’\r\n\r\n  Page 220: ‘inoculation for facultative anaërobes’\r\n  for ‘inoculation for facultative anërobes’\r\n\r\n  Page 231: ‘the unicellular microörganisms’\r\n  for ‘the unicellular micro-organisms’ [split across line]\r\n\r\n  Page 232: ‘unicellular pathogenic microörganisms’\r\n  for ‘unicellular pathogenic micro-organisms’ [split across line]\r\n\r\n  Page 233: ‘the fact of self-limitation’\r\n  for ‘the fact of self-limitaion’\r\n\r\n  Page 242: ‘the cattle tick (_Margaropus annulatus_).’\r\n  for ‘the cattle tick (_Margaropus annulatus_.)’\r\n\r\n  Page 244: ‘B.
