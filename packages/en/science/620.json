MORE TAXES!\r\n\r\n--and then all the people cheered again, and one man, who was more\r\nexcited than the rest, flung his hat high into the air, and shouted\r\n(as well as I could make out) “Who roar for the Sub-Warden?” Everybody\r\nroared, but whether it was for the Sub-Warden, or not, did not clearly\r\nappear: some were shouting “Bread!” and some “Taxes!”, but no one seemed\r\nto know what it was they really wanted.\r\n\r\nAll this I saw from the open window of the Warden's breakfast-saloon,\r\nlooking across the shoulder of the Lord Chancellor, who had sprung\r\nto his feet the moment the shouting began, almost as if he had been\r\nexpecting it, and had rushed to the window which commanded the best view\r\nof the market-place.\r\n\r\n“What can it all mean?” he kept repeating to himself, as, with his hands\r\nclasped behind him, and his gown floating in the air, he paced rapidly\r\nup and down the room. “I never heard such shouting before--and at this\r\ntime of the morning, too! And with such unanimity! Doesn't it strike you\r\nas very remarkable?”\r\n\r\nI represented, modestly, that to my ears it appeared that they were\r\nshouting for different things, but the Chancellor would not listen to my\r\nsuggestion for a moment. “They all shout the same words, I assure you!”\r\n he said: then, leaning well out of the window, he whispered to a man who\r\nwas standing close underneath, “Keep'em together, ca'n't you? The Warden\r\nwill be here directly. Give'em the signal for the march up!” All this\r\nwas evidently not meant for my ears, but I could scarcely help hearing\r\nit, considering that my chin was almost on the Chancellor's shoulder.\r\n\r\nThe 'march up' was a very curious sight:\r\n\r\n{Image...The march-up}\r\n\r\na straggling procession of men, marching two and two, began from the\r\nother side of the market-place, and advanced in an irregular zig-zag\r\nfashion towards the Palace, wildly tacking from side to side, like a\r\nsailing vessel making way against an unfavourable wind so that the head\r\nof the procession was often further from us at the end of one tack than\r\nit had been at the end of the previous one.\r\n\r\nYet it was evident that all was being done under orders, for I noticed\r\nthat all eyes were fixed on the man who stood just under the window, and\r\nto whom the Chancellor was continually whispering. This man held his hat\r\nin one hand and a little green flag in the other: whenever he waved the\r\nflag the procession advanced a little nearer, when he dipped it they\r\nsidled a little farther off, and whenever he waved his hat they all\r\nraised a hoarse cheer. “Hoo-roah!” they cried, carefully keeping time\r\nwith the hat as it bobbed up and down. “Hoo-roah! Noo! Consti! Tooshun!\r\nLess! Bread! More! Taxes!”\r\n\r\n“That'll do, that'll do!” the Chancellor whispered. “Let 'em rest a bit\r\ntill I give you the word. He's not here yet!” But at this moment the\r\ngreat folding-doors of the saloon were flung open, and he turned with a\r\nguilty start to receive His High Excellency. However it was only Bruno,\r\nand the Chancellor gave a little gasp of relieved anxiety.\r\n\r\n“Morning!” said the little fellow, addressing the remark, in a general\r\nsort of way, to the Chancellor and the waiters. “Doos oo know where\r\nSylvie is? I's looking for Sylvie!”\r\n\r\n“She's with the Warden, I believe, y'reince!” the Chancellor replied\r\nwith a low bow. There was, no doubt, a certain amount of absurdity in\r\napplying this title (which, as of course you see without my telling you,\r\nwas nothing but 'your Royal Highness' condensed into one syllable) to\r\na small creature whose father was merely the Warden of Outland: still,\r\nlarge excuse must be made for a man who had passed several years at the\r\nCourt of Fairyland, and had there acquired the almost impossible art of\r\npronouncing five syllables as one.\r\n\r\nBut the bow was lost upon Bruno, who had run out of the room, even\r\nwhile the great feat of The Unpronounceable Monosyllable was being\r\ntriumphantly performed.\r\n\r\nJust then, a single voice in the distance was understood to shout “A\r\nspeech from the Chancellor!” “Certainly, my friends!” the Chancellor\r\nreplied with extraordinary promptitude. “You shall have a speech!”\r\n Here one of the waiters, who had been for some minutes busy making a\r\nqueer-looking mixture of egg and sherry, respectfully presented it on\r\na large silver salver. The Chancellor took it haughtily, drank it off\r\nthoughtfully, smiled benevolently on the happy waiter as he set down the\r\nempty glass, and began. To the best of my recollection this is what he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n“Ahem! Ahem! Ahem! Fellow-sufferers, or rather suffering fellows--”\r\n (“Don't call 'em names!” muttered the man under the window. “I didn't\r\nsay felons!” the Chancellor explained.) “You may be sure that I always\r\nsympa--” (“'Ear, 'ear!” shouted the crowd, so loudly as quite to drown\r\nthe orator's thin squeaky voice) “--that I always sympa--” he repeated.\r\n(“Don't simper quite so much!” said the man under the window. “It makes\r\nyer look a hidiot!” And, all this time, “'Ear, 'ear!” went rumbling\r\nround the market-place, like a peal of thunder.) “That I always\r\nsympathise!” yelled the Chancellor, the first moment there was silence.\r\n“But your true friend is the Sub-Warden! Day and night he is brooding on\r\nyour wrongs--I should say your rights--that is to say your wrongs--no,\r\nI mean your rights--” (“Don't talk no more!” growled the man under the\r\nwindow. “You're making a mess of it!”) At this moment the Sub-Warden\r\nentered the saloon. He was a thin man, with a mean and crafty face,\r\nand a greenish-yellow complexion; and he crossed the room very slowly,\r\nlooking suspiciously about him as if he thought there might be a savage\r\ndog hidden somewhere. “Bravo!” he cried, patting the Chancellor on the\r\nback. “You did that speech very well indeed. Why, you're a born orator,\r\nman!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that's nothing!” the Chancellor replied, modestly, with downcast\r\neyes. “Most orators are born, you know.”\r\n\r\nThe Sub-Warden thoughtfully rubbed his chin. “Why, so they are!” he\r\nadmitted. “I never considered it in that light. Still, you did it very\r\nwell. A word in your ear!”\r\n\r\nThe rest of their conversation was all in whispers: so, as I could hear\r\nno more, I thought I would go and find Bruno.\r\n\r\nI found the little fellow standing in the passage, and being addressed\r\nby one of the men in livery, who stood before him, nearly bent double\r\nfrom extreme respectfulness, with his hands hanging in front of him\r\nlike the fins of a fish. “His High Excellency,” this respectful man was\r\nsaying, “is in his Study, y'reince!” (He didn't pronounce this quite so\r\nwell as the Chancellor.) Thither Bruno trotted, and I thought it well to\r\nfollow him.\r\n\r\nThe Warden, a tall dignified man with a grave but very pleasant face,\r\nwas seated before a writing-table, which was covered with papers, and\r\nholding on his knee one of the sweetest and loveliest little maidens it\r\nhas ever been my lot to see. She looked four or five years older than\r\nBruno, but she had the same rosy cheeks and sparkling eyes, and the same\r\nwealth of curly brown hair. Her eager smiling face was turned upwards\r\ntowards her father's, and it was a pretty sight to see the mutual love\r\nwith which the two faces--one in the Spring of Life, the other in its\r\nlate Autumn--were gazing on each other.\r\n\r\n“No, you've never seen him,” the old man was saying: “you couldn't, you\r\nknow, he's been away so long--traveling from land to land, and seeking\r\nfor health, more years than you've been alive, little Sylvie!” Here\r\nBruno climbed upon his other knee, and a good deal of kissing, on a\r\nrather complicated system, was the result.\r\n\r\n“He only came back last night,” said the Warden, when the kissing was\r\nover: “he's been traveling post-haste, for the last thousand miles or\r\nso, in order to be here on Sylvie's birthday. But he's a very early\r\nriser, and I dare say he's in the Library already. Come with me and see\r\nhim. He's always kind to children. You'll be sure to like him.”\r\n\r\n“Has the Other Professor come too?” Bruno asked in an awe-struck voice.\r\n\r\n“Yes, they arrived together. The Other Professor is--well, you won't\r\nlike him quite so much, perhaps. He's a little more dreamy, you know.”\r\n\r\n“I wiss Sylvie was a little more dreamy,” said Bruno.\r\n\r\n“What do you mean, Bruno?” said Sylvie.\r\n\r\nBruno went on addressing his father. “She says she ca'n't, oo know. But\r\nI thinks it isn't ca'n't, it's wo'n't.”\r\n\r\n“Says she ca'n't dream!” the puzzled Warden repeated.\r\n\r\n“She do say it,” Bruno persisted. “When I says to her 'Let's stop\r\nlessons!', she says 'Oh, I ca'n't dream of letting oo stop yet!'”\r\n\r\n“He always wants to stop lessons,” Sylvie explained, “five minutes after\r\nwe begin!”\r\n\r\n“Five minutes' lessons a day!” said the Warden. “You won't learn much at\r\nthat rate, little man!”\r\n\r\n“That's just what Sylvie says,” Bruno rejoined. “She says I wo'n't learn\r\nmy lessons. And I tells her, over and over, I ca'n't learn 'em. And what\r\ndoos oo think she says? She says 'It isn't ca'n't, it's wo'n't!'”\r\n\r\n“Let's go and see the Professor,” the Warden said, wisely avoiding\r\nfurther discussion. The children got down off his knees, each secured a\r\nhand, and the happy trio set off for the Library--followed by me. I had\r\ncome to the conclusion by this time that none of the party (except, for\r\na few moments, the Lord Chancellor) was in the least able to see me.\r\n\r\n“What's the matter with him?” Sylvie asked, walking with a little extra\r\nsedateness, by way of example to Bruno at the other side, who never\r\nceased jumping up and down.\r\n\r\n{Image...Visiting the profesor}\r\n\r\n“What was the matter--but I hope he's all right now--was lumbago, and\r\nrheumatism, and that kind of thing. He's been curing himself, you\r\nknow: he's a very learned doctor. Why, he's actually invented three new\r\ndiseases, besides a new way of breaking your collar-bone!”\r\n\r\n“Is it a nice way?” said Bruno.\r\n\r\n“Well, hum, not very,” the Warden said, as we entered the Library. “And\r\nhere is the Professor. Good morning, Professor! Hope you're quite rested\r\nafter your journey!”\r\n\r\nA jolly-looking, fat little man, in a flowery dressing-gown, with a\r\nlarge book under each arm, came trotting in at the other end of the\r\nroom, and was going straight across without taking any notice of the\r\nchildren. “I'm looking for Vol. Three,” he said. “Do you happen to have\r\nseen it?”\r\n\r\n“You don't see my children, Professor!” the Warden exclaimed, taking him\r\nby the shoulders and turning him round to face them.\r\n\r\nThe Professor laughed violently: then he gazed at them through his great\r\nspectacles, for a minute or two, without speaking.\r\n\r\nAt last he addressed Bruno. “I hope you have had a good night, my\r\nchild?” Bruno looked puzzled. “I's had the same night oo've had,” he\r\nreplied. “There's only been one night since yesterday!”\r\n\r\nIt was the Professor's turn to look puzzled now. He took off his\r\nspectacles, and rubbed them with his handkerchief. Then he gazed at them\r\nagain. Then he turned to the Warden. “Are they bound?” he enquired.\r\n\r\n“No, we aren't,” said Bruno, who thought himself quite able to answer\r\nthis question.\r\n\r\nThe Professor shook his head sadly. “Not even half-bound?”\r\n\r\n“Why would we be half-bound?” said Bruno.\r\n\r\n“We're not prisoners!”\r\n\r\nBut the Professor had forgotten all about them by this time, and was\r\nspeaking to the Warden again. “You'll be glad to hear,” he was saying,\r\n“that the Barometer's beginning to move--”\r\n\r\n“Well, which way?” said the Warden--adding, to the children, “Not that\r\nI care, you know. Only he thinks it affects the weather. He's a\r\nwonderfully clever man, you know. Sometimes he says things that only the\r\nOther Professor can understand. Sometimes he says things that nobody can\r\nunderstand! Which way is it, Professor? Up or down?”\r\n\r\n“Neither!” said the Professor, gently clapping his hands. “It's going\r\nsideways--if I may so express myself.”\r\n\r\n“And what kind of weather does that produce?” said the Warden. “Listen,\r\nchildren! Now you'll hear something worth knowing!”\r\n\r\n“Horizontal weather,” said the Professor, and made straight for the\r\ndoor, very nearly trampling on Bruno, who had only just time to get out\r\nof his way.\r\n\r\n“Isn't he learned?” the Warden said, looking after him with admiring\r\neyes. “Positively he runs over with learning!”\r\n\r\n“But he needn't run over me!” said Bruno.\r\n\r\nThe Professor was back in a moment: he had changed his dressing-gown for\r\na frock-coat, and had put on a pair of very strange-looking boots, the\r\ntops of which were open umbrellas. “I thought you'd like to see them,”\r\n he said. “These are the boots for horizontal weather!”\r\n\r\n{Image...Boots for horizontal weather}\r\n\r\n“But what's the use of wearing umbrellas round one's knees?”\r\n\r\n“In ordinary rain,” the Professor admitted, “they would not be of\r\nmuch use. But if ever it rained horizontally, you know, they would be\r\ninvaluable--simply invaluable!”\r\n\r\n“Take the Professor to the breakfast-saloon, children,” said the Warden.\r\n“And tell them not to wait for me. I had breakfast early, as I've some\r\nbusiness to attend to.” The children seized the Professor's hands, as\r\nfamiliarly as if they had known him for years, and hurried him away. I\r\nfollowed respectfully behind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 2. L'AMIE INCONNUE.\r\n\r\nAs we entered the breakfast-saloon, the Professor was saying “--and he\r\nhad breakfast by himself, early: so he begged you wouldn't wait for him,\r\nmy Lady. This way, my Lady,” he added, “this way!” And then, with (as it\r\nseemed to me) most superfluous politeness, he flung open the door of my\r\ncompartment, and ushered in “--a young and lovely lady!” I muttered to\r\nmyself with some bitterness. “And this is, of course, the opening\r\nscene of Vol. I. She is the Heroine. And I am one of those subordinate\r\ncharacters that only turn up when needed for the development of her\r\ndestiny, and whose final appearance is outside the church, waiting to\r\ngreet the Happy Pair!”\r\n\r\n“Yes, my Lady, change at Fayfield,” were the next words I heard (oh that\r\ntoo obsequious Guard!), “next station but one.” And the door closed, and\r\nthe lady settled down into her corner, and the monotonous throb of the\r\nengine (making one feel as if the train were some gigantic monster,\r\nwhose very circulation we could feel) proclaimed that we were once more\r\nspeeding on our way. “The lady had a perfectly formed nose,” I caught\r\nmyself saying to myself, “hazel eyes, and lips--” and here it occurred\r\nto me that to see, for myself, what “the lady” was really like, would be\r\nmore satisfactory than much speculation.\r\n\r\nI looked round cautiously, and--was entirely disappointed of my hope.\r\nThe veil, which shrouded her whole face, was too thick for me to see\r\nmore than the glitter of bright eyes and the hazy outline of what might\r\nbe a lovely oval face, but might also, unfortunately, be an equally\r\nunlovely one. I closed my eyes again, saying to myself “--couldn't have\r\na better chance for an experiment in Telepathy! I'll think out her face,\r\nand afterwards test the portrait with the original.”\r\n\r\nAt first, no result at all crowned my efforts, though I 'divided my\r\nswift mind,' now hither, now thither, in a way that I felt sure would\r\nhave made AEneas green with envy: but the dimly-seen oval remained as\r\nprovokingly blank as ever--a mere Ellipse, as if in some mathematical\r\ndiagram, without even the Foci that might be made to do duty as a nose\r\nand a mouth. Gradually, however, the conviction came upon me that I\r\ncould, by a certain concentration of thought, think the veil away, and\r\nso get a glimpse of the mysterious face--as to which the two questions,\r\n“is she pretty?” and “is she plain?”, still hung suspended, in my mind,\r\nin beautiful equipoise.\r\n\r\nSuccess was partial--and fitful--still there was a result: ever and\r\nanon, the veil seemed to vanish, in a sudden flash of light: but,\r\nbefore I could fully realise the face, all was dark again. In each such\r\nglimpse, the face seemed to grow more childish and more innocent:\r\nand, when I had at last thought the veil entirely away, it was,\r\nunmistakeably, the sweet face of little Sylvie!\r\n\r\n“So, either I've been dreaming about Sylvie,” I said to myself, “and\r\nthis is the reality. Or else I've really been with Sylvie, and this is a\r\ndream! Is Life itself a dream, I wonder?”\r\n\r\nTo occupy the time, I got out the letter, which had caused me to take\r\nthis sudden railway-journey from my London home down to a strange\r\nfishing-town on the North coast, and read it over again:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    “DEAR OLD FRIEND,\r\n\r\n    “I'm sure it will be as great a pleasure to me, as it can possibly\r\n    be to you, to meet once more after so many years: and of course I\r\n    shall be ready to give you all the benefit of such medical skill as\r\n    I have: only, you know, one mustn't violate professional etiquette!\r\n    And you are already in the hands of a first-rate London doctor,\r\n    with whom it would be utter affectation for me to pretend to compete.\r\n    (I make no doubt he is right in saying the heart is affected:\r\n    all your symptoms point that way.) One thing, at any rate, I have\r\n    already done in my doctorial capacity--secured you a bedroom on the\r\n    ground-floor, so that you will not need to ascend the stairs at all.\r\n\r\n    “I shalt expect you by last train on Friday, in accordance with your\r\n    letter: and, till then, I shalt say, in the words of the old song,\r\n    'Oh for Friday nicht!  Friday's lang a-coming!'\r\n\r\n    “Yours always,\r\n\r\n    “ARTHUR FORESTER.\r\n\r\n    “P.S.  Do you believe in Fate?”\r\n\r\nThis Postscript puzzled me sorely. “He is far too sensible a man,” I\r\nthought, “to have become a Fatalist. And yet what else can he mean by\r\nit?” And, as I folded up the letter and put it away, I inadvertently\r\nrepeated the words aloud. “Do you believe in Fate?”\r\n\r\nThe fair 'Incognita' turned her head quickly at the sudden question.\r\n“No, I don't!” she said with a smile. “Do you?”\r\n\r\n“I--I didn't mean to ask the question!” I stammered, a little taken\r\naback at having begun a conversation in so unconventional a fashion.\r\n\r\nThe lady's smile became a laugh--not a mocking laugh, but the laugh of a\r\nhappy child who is perfectly at her ease. “Didn't you?” she said. “Then\r\nit was a case of what you Doctors call 'unconscious cerebration'?”\r\n\r\n“I am no Doctor,” I replied. “Do I look so like one? Or what makes you\r\nthink it?”\r\n\r\nShe pointed to the book I had been reading, which was so lying that its\r\ntitle, “Diseases of the Heart,” was plainly visible.\r\n\r\n“One needn't be a Doctor,” I said, “to take an interest in medical\r\nbooks. There's another class of readers, who are yet more deeply\r\ninterested--”\r\n\r\n“You mean the Patients?” she interrupted, while a look of tender pity\r\ngave new sweetness to her face. “But,” with an evident wish to avoid a\r\npossibly painful topic, “one needn't be either, to take an interest in\r\nbooks of Science. Which contain the greatest amount of Science, do you\r\nthink, the books, or the minds?”\r\n\r\n“Rather a profound question for a lady!” I said to myself, holding, with\r\nthe conceit so natural to Man, that Woman's intellect is essentially\r\nshallow. And I considered a minute before replying. “If you mean living\r\nminds, I don't think it's possible to decide. There is so much written\r\nScience that no living person has ever read: and there is so much\r\nthought-out Science that hasn't yet been written. But, if you mean the\r\nwhole human race, then I think the minds have it: everything, recorded\r\nin books, must have once been in some mind, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Isn't that rather like one of the Rules in Algebra?” my Lady enquired.\r\n(“Algebra too!” I thought with increasing wonder.) “I mean, if we\r\nconsider thoughts as factors, may we not say that the Least Common\r\nMultiple of all the minds contains that of all the books; but not the\r\nother way?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly we may!” I replied, delighted with the illustration. “And\r\nwhat a grand thing it would be,” I went on dreamily, thinking aloud\r\nrather than talking, “if we could only apply that Rule to books! You\r\nknow, in finding the Least Common Multiple, we strike out a quantity\r\nwherever it occurs, except in the term where it is raised to its highest\r\npower. So we should have to erase every recorded thought, except in the\r\nsentence where it is expressed with the greatest intensity.”\r\n\r\nMy Lady laughed merrily. “Some books would be reduced to blank paper,\r\nI'm afraid!” she said.\r\n\r\n“They would. Most libraries would be terribly diminished in bulk. But\r\njust think what they would gain in quality!”\r\n\r\n“When will it be done?” she eagerly asked. “If there's any chance of it\r\nin my time, I think I'll leave off reading, and wait for it!”\r\n\r\n“Well, perhaps in another thousand years or so--”\r\n\r\n“Then there's no use waiting!”, said my Lady. “Let's sit down. Uggug, my\r\npet, come and sit by me!”\r\n\r\n“Anywhere but by me!” growled the Sub-warden. “The little wretch always\r\nmanages to upset his coffee!”\r\n\r\nI guessed at once (as perhaps the reader will also have guessed, if,\r\nlike myself, he is very clever at drawing conclusions) that my Lady was\r\nthe Sub-Warden's wife, and that Uggug (a hideous fat boy, about the same\r\nage as Sylvie, with the expression of a prize-pig) was their son. Sylvie\r\nand Bruno, with the Lord Chancellor, made up a party of seven.\r\n\r\n{Image...A portable plunge-bath}\r\n\r\n“And you actually got a plunge-bath every morning?” said the Sub-Warden,\r\nseemingly in continuation of a conversation with the Professor. “Even at\r\nthe little roadside-inns?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, certainly, certainly!” the Professor replied with a smile on his\r\njolly face. “Allow me to explain. It is, in fact, a very simple problem\r\nin Hydrodynamics. (That means a combination of Water and Strength.)\r\nIf we take a plunge-bath, and a man of great strength (such as myself)\r\nabout to plunge into it, we have a perfect example of this science. I\r\nam bound to admit,” the Professor continued, in a lower tone and with\r\ndowncast eyes, “that we need a man of remarkable strength. He must be\r\nable to spring from the floor to about twice his own height, gradually\r\nturning over as he rises, so as to come down again head first.”\r\n\r\n“Why, you need a flea, not a man!” exclaimed the Sub-Warden.\r\n\r\n“Pardon me,” said the Professor. “This particular kind of bath is\r\nnot adapted for a flea. Let us suppose,” he continued, folding his\r\ntable-napkin into a graceful festoon, “that this represents what is\r\nperhaps the necessity of this Age--the Active Tourist's Portable Bath.\r\nYou may describe it briefly, if you like,” looking at the Chancellor,\r\n“by the letters A.T.P.B.”\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor, much disconcerted at finding everybody looking at him,\r\ncould only murmur, in a shy whisper, “Precisely so!”\r\n\r\n“One great advantage of this plunge-bath,” continued the Professor, “is\r\nthat it requires only half-a-gallon of water--”\r\n\r\n“I don't call it a plunge-bath,” His Sub-Excellency remarked, “unless\r\nyour Active Tourist goes right under!”\r\n\r\n“But he does go right under,” the old man gently replied. “The A.T.\r\nhangs up the P. B. on a nail--thus. He then empties the water-jug into\r\nit--places the empty jug below the bag--leaps into the air--descends\r\nhead-first into the bag--the water rises round him to the top of the\r\nbag--and there you are!” he triumphantly concluded. “The A.T. is as much\r\nunder water as if he'd gone a mile or two down into the Atlantic!”\r\n\r\n“And he's drowned, let us say, in about four minutes--”\r\n\r\n“By no means!” the Professor answered with a proud smile. “After about\r\na minute, he quietly turns a tap at the lower end of the P. B.--all the\r\nwater runs back into the jug and there you are again!”\r\n\r\n“But how in the world is he to get out of the bag again?”\r\n\r\n“That, I take it,” said the Professor, “is the most beautiful part of\r\nthe whole invention. All the way up the P.B., inside, are loops for\r\nthe thumbs; so it's something like going up-stairs, only perhaps less\r\ncomfortable; and, by the time the A. T. has risen out of the bag, all\r\nbut his head, he's sure to topple over, one way or the other--the Law of\r\nGravity secures that. And there he is on the floor again!”\r\n\r\n“A little bruised, perhaps?”\r\n\r\n“Well, yes, a little bruised; but having had his plunge-bath: that's the\r\ngreat thing.”\r\n\r\n“Wonderful! It's almost beyond belief!” murmured the Sub-Warden. The\r\nProfessor took it as a compliment, and bowed with a gratified smile.\r\n\r\n“Quite beyond belief!” my Lady added--meaning, no doubt, to be more\r\ncomplimentary still. The Professor bowed, but he didn't smile this time.\r\n“I can assure you,” he said earnestly, “that, provided the bath was\r\nmade, I used it every morning. I certainly ordered it--that I am clear\r\nabout--my only doubt is, whether the man ever finished making it. It's\r\ndifficult to remember, after so many years--”\r\n\r\nAt this moment the door, very slowly and creakingly, began to open, and\r\nSylvie and Bruno jumped up, and ran to meet the well-known footstep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 3. BIRTHDAY-PRESENTS.\r\n\r\n“It's my brother!” the Sub-warden exclaimed, in a warning whisper.\r\n“Speak out, and be quick about it!”\r\n\r\nThe appeal was evidently addressed to the Lord Chancellor, who instantly\r\nreplied, in a shrill monotone, like a little boy repeating the alphabet,\r\n“As I was remarking, your Sub-Excellency, this portentous movement--”\r\n\r\n“You began too soon!” the other interrupted, scarcely able to restrain\r\nhimself to a whisper, so great was his excitement. “He couldn't have\r\nheard you. Begin again!” “As I was remarking,” chanted the obedient Lord\r\nChancellor, “this portentous movement has already assumed the dimensions\r\nof a Revolution!”\r\n\r\n“And what are the dimensions of a Revolution?” The voice was genial and\r\nmellow, and the face of the tall dignified old man, who had just entered\r\nthe room, leading Sylvie by the hand, and with Bruno riding triumphantly\r\non his shoulder, was too noble and gentle to have scared a less guilty\r\nman: but the Lord Chancellor turned pale instantly, and could hardly\r\narticulate the words “The dimensions your--your High Excellency?\r\nI--I--scarcely comprehend!”\r\n\r\n“Well, the length, breadth, and thickness, if you like it better!” And\r\nthe old man smiled, half-contemptuously.\r\n\r\nThe Lord Chancellor recovered himself with a great effort, and pointed\r\nto the open window. “If your High Excellency will listen for a moment\r\nto the shouts of the exasperated populace--” (“of the exasperated\r\npopulace!” the Sub-Warden repeated in a louder tone, as the Lord\r\nChancellor, being in a state of abject terror, had dropped almost into a\r\nwhisper) “--you will understand what it is they want.”\r\n\r\nAnd at that moment there surged into the room a hoarse confused cry, in\r\nwhich the only clearly audible words were “Less--bread--More--taxes!”\r\n The old man laughed heartily. “What in the world--” he was beginning:\r\nbut the Chancellor heard him not. “Some mistake!” he muttered, hurrying\r\nto the window, from which he shortly returned with an air of relief.\r\n“Now listen!” he exclaimed, holding up his hand impressively. And now\r\nthe words came quite distinctly, and with the regularity of the ticking\r\nof a clock, “More--bread--Less taxes!'”\r\n\r\n“More bread!” the Warden repeated in astonishment. “Why, the new\r\nGovernment Bakery was opened only last week, and I gave orders to sell\r\nthe bread at cost-price during the present scarcity! What can they\r\nexpect more?”\r\n\r\n“The Bakery's closed, y'reince!” the Chancellor said, more loudly and\r\nclearly than he had spoken yet. He was emboldened by the consciousness\r\nthat here, at least, he had evidence to produce: and he placed in the\r\nWarden's hands a few printed notices, that were lying ready, with some\r\nopen ledgers, on a side-table.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, I see!” the Warden muttered, glancing carelessly through\r\nthem. “Order countermanded by my brother, and supposed to be my doing!\r\nRather sharp practice! It's all right!” he added in a louder tone. “My\r\nname is signed to it: so I take it on myself. But what do they mean by\r\n'Less Taxes'? How can they be less? I abolished the last of them a month\r\nago!”\r\n\r\n“It's been put on again, y'reince, and by y'reince's own orders!”, and\r\nother printed notices were submitted for inspection.\r\n\r\nThe Warden, whilst looking them over, glanced once or twice at the\r\nSub-Warden, who had seated himself before one of the open ledgers, and\r\nwas quite absorbed in adding it up; but he merely repeated “It's all\r\nright. I accept it as my doing.”\r\n\r\n“And they do say,” the Chancellor went on sheepishly--looking much\r\nmore like a convicted thief than an Officer of State, “that a change\r\nof Government, by the abolition of the Sub-Warden---I mean,” he hastily\r\nadded, on seeing the Warden's look of astonishment, “the abolition of\r\nthe office of Sub-Warden, and giving the present holder the right to\r\nact as Vice-Warden whenever the Warden is absent--would appease all this\r\nseedling discontent I mean,” he added, glancing at a paper he held in\r\nhis hand, “all this seething discontent!”\r\n\r\n“For fifteen years,” put in a deep but very harsh voice, “my husband has\r\nbeen acting as Sub-Warden. It is too long! It is much too long!” My Lady\r\nwas a vast creature at all times: but, when she frowned and folded her\r\narms, as now, she looked more gigantic than ever, and made one try to\r\nfancy what a haystack would look like, if out of temper.\r\n\r\n“He would distinguish himself as a Vice!” my Lady proceeded, being far\r\ntoo stupid to see the double meaning of her words. “There has been no\r\nsuch Vice in Outland for many a long year, as he would be!”\r\n\r\n“What course would you suggest, Sister?” the Warden mildly enquired.\r\n\r\nMy Lady stamped, which was undignified: and snorted, which was\r\nungraceful. “This is no jesting matter!” she bellowed.\r\n\r\n“I will consult my brother,” said the Warden. “Brother!”\r\n\r\n“--and seven makes a hundred and ninety-four, which is sixteen and\r\ntwo-pence,” the Sub-Warden replied. “Put down two and carry sixteen.”\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor raised his hands and eyebrows, lost in admiration. “Such\r\na man of business!” he murmured.\r\n\r\n“Brother, could I have a word with you in my Study?” the Warden said in\r\na louder tone. The Sub-Warden rose with alacrity, and the two left the\r\nroom together.\r\n\r\nMy Lady turned to the Professor, who had uncovered the urn, and was\r\ntaking its temperature with his pocket-thermometer. “Professor!” she\r\nbegan, so loudly and suddenly that even Uggug, who had gone to sleep in\r\nhis chair, left off snoring and opened one eye. The Professor pocketed\r\nhis thermometer in a moment, clasped his hands, and put his head on one\r\nside with a meek smile.\r\n\r\n“You were teaching my son before breakfast, I believe?” my Lady loftily\r\nremarked. “I hope he strikes you as having talent?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, very much so indeed, my Lady!” the Professor hastily replied,\r\nunconsciously rubbing his ear, while some painful recollection seemed\r\nto cross his mind. “I was very forcibly struck by His Magnificence, I\r\nassure you!”\r\n\r\n“He is a charming boy!” my Lady exclaimed. “Even his snores are more\r\nmusical than those of other boys!”\r\n\r\nIf that were so, the Professor seemed to think, the snores of other boys\r\nmust be something too awful to be endured: but he was a cautious man,\r\nand he said nothing.\r\n\r\n“And he's so clever!” my Lady continued. “No one will enjoy your Lecture\r\nmore by the way, have you fixed the time for it yet? You've never given\r\none, you know: and it was promised years ago, before you--\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, my Lady, I know! Perhaps next Tuesday or Tuesday week--”\r\n\r\n“That will do very well,” said my Lady, graciously. “Of course you will\r\nlet the Other Professor lecture as well?”\r\n\r\n“I think not, my Lady?” the Professor said with some hesitation. “You\r\nsee, he always stands with his back to the audience. It does very well\r\nfor reciting; but for lecturing--”\r\n\r\n“You are quite right,” said my Lady. “And, now I come to think of it,\r\nthere would hardly be time for more than one Lecture. And it will go off\r\nall the better, if we begin with a Banquet, and a Fancy-dress Ball--”\r\n\r\n“It will indeed!” the Professor cried, with enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n“I shall come as a Grass-hopper,” my Lady calmly proceeded. “What shall\r\nyou come as, Professor?”\r\n\r\nThe Professor smiled feebly. “I shall come as--as early as I can, my\r\nLady!”\r\n\r\n“You mustn't come in before the doors are opened,” said my Lady.\r\n\r\n“I ca'n't,” said the Professor. “Excuse me a moment. As this is Lady\r\nSylvie's birthday, I would like to--” and he rushed away.\r\n\r\nBruno began feeling in his pockets, looking more and more melancholy\r\nas he did so: then he put his thumb in his mouth, and considered for a\r\nminute: then he quietly left the room.\r\n\r\nHe had hardly done so before the Professor was back again, quite out of\r\nbreath. “Wishing you many happy returns of the day, my dear child!” he\r\nwent on, addressing the smiling little girl, who had run to meet him.\r\n“Allow me to give you a birthday-present. It's a second-hand pincushion,\r\nmy dear. And it only cost fourpence-halfpenny!”\r\n\r\n“Thank you, it's very pretty!” And Sylvie rewarded the old man with a\r\nhearty kiss.\r\n\r\n“And the pins they gave me for nothing!” the Professor added in high\r\nglee. “Fifteen of 'em, and only one bent!”\r\n\r\n“I'll make the bent one into a hook!” said Sylvie. “To catch Bruno with,\r\nwhen he runs away from his lessons!”\r\n\r\n“You ca'n't guess what my present is!” said Uggug, who had taken the\r\nbutter-dish from the table, and was standing behind her, with a wicked\r\nleer on his face.\r\n\r\n“No, I ca'n't guess,” Sylvie said without looking up. She was still\r\nexamining the Professor's pincushion.\r\n\r\n“It's this!” cried the bad boy, exultingly, as he emptied the dish over\r\nher, and then, with a grin of delight at his own cleverness, looked\r\nround for applause.\r\n\r\nSylvie coloured crimson, as she shook off the butter from her frock: but\r\nshe kept her lips tight shut, and walked away to the window, where she\r\nstood looking out and trying to recover her temper.\r\n\r\nUggug's triumph was a very short one: the Sub-Warden had returned, just\r\nin time to be a witness of his dear child's playfulness, and in another\r\nmoment a skilfully-applied box on the ear had changed the grin of\r\ndelight into a howl of pain.\r\n\r\n“My darling!” cried his mother, enfolding him in her fat arms. “Did they\r\nbox his ears for nothing? A precious pet!”\r\n\r\n“It's not for nothing!” growled the angry father. “Are you aware, Madam,\r\nthat I pay the house-bills, out of a fixed annual sum? The loss of all\r\nthat wasted butter falls on me! Do you hear, Madam!”\r\n\r\n“Hold your tongue, Sir!” My Lady spoke very quietly--almost in a\r\nwhisper. But there was something in her look which silenced him. “Don't\r\nyou see it was only a joke? And a very clever one, too! He only meant\r\nthat he loved nobody but her! And, instead of being pleased with the\r\ncompliment, the spiteful little thing has gone away in a huff!”\r\n\r\nThe Sub-Warden was a very good hand at changing a subject. He walked\r\nacross to the window. “My dear,” he said, “is that a pig that I see down\r\nbelow, rooting about among your flower-beds?”\r\n\r\n“A pig!” shrieked my Lady, rushing madly to the window, and almost\r\npushing her husband out, in her anxiety to see for herself. “Whose pig\r\nis it? How did it get in? Where's that crazy Gardener gone?”\r\n\r\nAt this moment Bruno re-entered the room, and passing Uggug (who was\r\nblubbering his loudest, in the hope of attracting notice) as if he was\r\nquite used to that sort of thing, he ran up to Sylvie and threw his arms\r\nround her. “I went to my toy-cupboard,” he said with a very sorrowful\r\nface, “to see if there were somefin fit for a present for oo! And there\r\nisn't nuffin! They's all broken, every one! And I haven't got no money\r\nleft, to buy oo a birthday-present! And I ca'n't give oo nuffin but\r\nthis!” (“This” was a very earnest hug and a kiss.)\r\n\r\n“Oh, thank you, darling!” cried Sylvie. “I like your present best of\r\nall!” (But if so, why did she give it back so quickly?)\r\n\r\nHis Sub-Excellency turned and patted the two children on the head with\r\nhis long lean hands. “Go away, dears!” he said. “There's business to\r\ntalk over.”\r\n\r\nSylvie and Bruno went away hand in hand: but, on reaching the door,\r\nSylvie came back again and went up to Uggug timidly. “I don't mind about\r\nthe butter,” she said, “and I--I'm sorry he hurt you!” And she tried to\r\nshake hands with the little ruffian: but Uggug only blubbered louder,\r\nand wouldn't make friends. Sylvie left the room with a sigh.\r\n\r\nThe Sub-Warden glared angrily at his weeping son. “Leave the room,\r\nSirrah!” he said, as loud as he dared. His wife was still leaning out of\r\nthe window, and kept repeating “I ca'n't see that pig! Where is it?”\r\n\r\n“It's moved to the right now it's gone a little to the left,” said the\r\nSub-Warden: but he had his back to the window, and was making signals to\r\nthe Lord Chancellor, pointing to Uggug and the door, with many a cunning\r\nnod and wink.\r\n\r\n{Image...Removal of Uggug}\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor caught his meaning at last, and, crossing the room, took\r\nthat interesting child by the ear the next moment he and Uggug were out\r\nof the room, and the door shut behind them: but not before one piercing\r\nyell had rung through the room, and reached the ears of the fond mother.\r\n\r\n“What is that hideous noise?” she fiercely asked, turning upon her\r\nstartled husband.\r\n\r\n“It's some hyaena--or other,” replied the Sub-Warden, looking vaguely up\r\nto the ceiling, as if that was where they usually were to be found. “Let\r\nus to business, my dear. Here comes the Warden.” And he picked up from\r\nthe floor a wandering scrap of manuscript, on which I just caught the\r\nwords 'after which Election duly holden the said Sibimet and Tabikat\r\nhis wife may at their pleasure assume Imperial--' before, with a guilty\r\nlook, he crumpled it up in his hand.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 4. A CUNNING CONSPIRACY.\r\n\r\nThe Warden entered at this moment: and close behind him came the Lord\r\nChancellor, a little flushed and out of breath, and adjusting his wig,\r\nwhich appeared to have been dragged partly off his head.\r\n\r\n“But where is my precious child?” my Lady enquired, as the four took\r\ntheir seats at the small side-table devoted to ledgers and bundles and\r\nbills.\r\n\r\n“He left the room a few minutes ago with the Lord Chancellor,” the\r\nSub-Warden briefly explained.\r\n\r\n“Ah!” said my Lady, graciously smiling on that high official. “Your\r\nLordship has a very taking way with children! I doubt if any one could\r\ngain the ear of my darling Uggug so quickly as you can!” For an entirely\r\nstupid woman, my Lady's remarks were curiously full of meaning, of which\r\nshe herself was wholly unconscious.\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor bowed, but with a very uneasy air. “I think the Warden\r\nwas about to speak,” he remarked, evidently anxious to change the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nBut my Lady would not be checked. “He is a clever boy,” she continued\r\nwith enthusiasm, “but he needs a man like your Lordship to draw him\r\nout!”\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor bit his lip, and was silent. He evidently feared that,\r\nstupid as she looked, she understood what she said this time, and was\r\nhaving a joke at his expense. He might have spared himself all anxiety:\r\nwhatever accidental meaning her words might have, she herself never\r\nmeant anything at all.\r\n\r\n“It is all settled!” the Warden announced, wasting no time over\r\npreliminaries. “The Sub-Wardenship is abolished, and my brother is\r\nappointed to act as Vice-Warden whenever I am absent. So, as I am going\r\nabroad for a while, he will enter on his new duties at once.”\r\n\r\n“And there will really be a Vice after all?” my Lady enquired.\r\n\r\n“I hope so!” the Warden smilingly replied.\r\n\r\nMy Lady looked much pleased, and tried to clap her hands: but you might\r\nas well have knocked two feather-beds together, for any noise it made.\r\n“When my husband is Vice,” she said, “it will be the same as if we had a\r\nhundred Vices!”\r\n\r\n“Hear, hear!” cried the Sub-Warden.\r\n\r\n“You seem to think it very remarkable,” my Lady remarked with some\r\nseverity, “that your wife should speak the truth!”\r\n\r\n“No, not remarkable at all!” her husband anxiously explained. “Nothing\r\nis remarkable that you say, sweet one!”\r\n\r\nMy Lady smiled approval of the sentiment, and went on. “And am I\r\nVice-Wardeness?”\r\n\r\n“If you choose to use that title,” said the Warden: “but 'Your\r\nExcellency' will be the proper style of address. And I trust that both\r\n'His Excellency' and 'Her Excellency' will observe the Agreement I have\r\ndrawn up. The provision I am most anxious about is this.” He unrolled a\r\nlarge parchment scroll, and read aloud the words “'item, that we will be\r\nkind to the poor.' The Chancellor worded it for me,” he added, glancing\r\nat that great Functionary. “I suppose, now, that word 'item' has some\r\ndeep legal meaning?”\r\n\r\n“Undoubtedly!” replied the Chancellor, as articulately as he could with\r\na pen between his lips. He was nervously rolling and unrolling several\r\nother scrolls, and making room among them for the one the Warden had\r\njust handed to him. “These are merely the rough copies,” he explained:\r\n“and, as soon as I have put in the final corrections--” making a great\r\ncommotion among the different parchments, “--a semi-colon or two that I\r\nhave accidentally omitted--” here he darted about, pen in hand, from one\r\npart of the scroll to another, spreading sheets of blotting-paper over\r\nhis corrections, “all will be ready for signing.”\r\n\r\n“Should it not be read out, first?” my Lady enquired.\r\n\r\n“No need, no need!” the Sub-Warden and the Chancellor exclaimed at the\r\nsame moment, with feverish eagerness.\r\n\r\n“No need at all,” the Warden gently assented. “Your husband and I have\r\ngone through it together. It provides that he shall exercise the full\r\nauthority of Warden, and shall have the disposal of the annual revenue\r\nattached to the office, until my return, or, failing that, until Bruno\r\ncomes of age: and that he shall then hand over, to myself or to Bruno as\r\nthe case may be, the Wardenship, the unspent revenue, and the\r\ncontents of the Treasury, which are to be preserved, intact, under his\r\nguardianship.”\r\n\r\nAll this time the Sub-Warden was busy, with the Chancellor's help,\r\nshifting the papers from side to side, and pointing out to the Warden\r\nthe place whew he was to sign. He then signed it himself, and my Lady\r\nand the Chancellor added their names as witnesses.\r\n\r\n“Short partings are best,” said the Warden. “All is ready for my\r\njourney. My children are waiting below to see me off” He gravely kissed\r\nmy Lady, shook hands with his brother and the Chancellor, and left the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n{Image...'What a game!'}\r\n\r\nThe three waited in silence till the sound of wheels announced that the\r\nWarden was out of hearing: then, to my surprise, they broke into peals\r\nof uncontrollable laughter.\r\n\r\n“What a game, oh, what a game!” cried the Chancellor. And he and the\r\nVice-Warden joined hands, and skipped wildly about the room. My Lady was\r\ntoo dignified to skip, but she laughed like the neighing of a horse, and\r\nwaved her handkerchief above her head: it was clear to her very limited\r\nunderstanding that something very clever had been done, but what it was\r\nshe had yet to learn.\r\n\r\n“You said I should hear all about it when the Warden had gone,” she\r\nremarked, as soon as she could make herself heard.\r\n\r\n“And so you shall, Tabby!” her husband graciously replied, as he removed\r\nthe blotting-paper, and showed the two parchments lying side by side.\r\n“This is the one he read but didn't sign: and this is the one he signed\r\nbut didn't read! You see it was all covered up, except the place for\r\nsigning the names--”\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes!” my Lady interrupted eagerly, and began comparing the two\r\nAgreements.\r\n\r\n“'Item, that he shall exercise the authority of Warden, in the Warden's\r\nabsence.' Why, that's been changed into 'shall be absolute governor\r\nfor life, with the title of Emperor, if elected to that office by the\r\npeople.' What! Are you Emperor, darling?”\r\n\r\n“Not yet, dear,” the Vice-Warden replied. “It won't do to let this paper\r\nbe seen, just at present. All in good time.”\r\n\r\nMy Lady nodded, and read on. “'Item, that we will be kind to the poor.'\r\nWhy, that's omitted altogether!”\r\n\r\n“Course it is!” said her husband. “We're not going to bother about the\r\nwretches!”\r\n\r\n“Good,” said my Lady, with emphasis, and read on again. “'Item, that the\r\ncontents of the Treasury be preserved intact.' Why, that's altered into\r\n'shall be at the absolute disposal of the Vice-Warden'! Well, Sibby,\r\nthat was a clever trick! All the Jewels, only think! May I go and put\r\nthem on directly?”\r\n\r\n“Well, not just yet, Lovey,” her husband uneasily replied. “You see the\r\npublic mind isn't quite ripe for it yet. We must feel our way. Of course\r\nwe'll have the coach-and-four out, at once. And I'll take the title of\r\nEmperor, as soon as we can safely hold an Election. But they'll hardly\r\nstand our using the Jewels, as long as they know the Warden's alive. We\r\nmust spread a report of his death. A little Conspiracy--”\r\n\r\n“A Conspiracy!” cried the delighted lady, clapping her hands. “Of all\r\nthings, I do like a Conspiracy! It's so interesting!”\r\n\r\nThe Vice-Warden and the Chancellor interchanged a wink or two. “Let\r\nher conspire to her heart's content!” the cunning Chancellor whispered.\r\n“It'll do no harm!”\r\n\r\n“And when will the Conspiracy--”\r\n\r\n“Hist!', her husband hastily interrupted her, as the door opened, and\r\nSylvie and Bruno came in, with their arms twined lovingly round each\r\nother--Bruno sobbing convulsively, with his face hidden on his sister's\r\nshoulder, and Sylvie more grave and quiet, but with tears streaming down\r\nher cheeks.\r\n\r\n“Mustn't cry like that!” the Vice-Warden said sharply, but without any\r\neffect on the weeping children. “Cheer 'em up a bit!” he hinted to my\r\nLady.\r\n\r\n“Cake!” my Lady muttered to herself with great decision, crossing the\r\nroom and opening a cupboard, from which she presently returned with two\r\nslices of plum-cake. “Eat, and don't cry!” were her short and simple\r\norders: and the poor children sat down side by side, but seemed in no\r\nmood for eating.\r\n\r\nFor the second time the door opened--or rather was burst open, this\r\ntime, as Uggug rushed violently into the room, shouting “that old\r\nBeggars come again!”\r\n\r\n“He's not to have any food--” the Vice-warden was beginning, but the\r\nChancellor interrupted him. “It's all right,” he said, in a low voice:\r\n“the servants have their orders.”\r\n\r\n“He's just under here,” said Uggug, who had gone to the window, and was\r\nlooking down into the court-yard.\r\n\r\n“Where, my darling?” said his fond mother, flinging her arms round the\r\nneck of the little monster. All of us (except Sylvie and Bruno, who\r\ntook no notice of what was going on) followed her to the window. The old\r\nBeggar looked up at us with hungry eyes. “Only a crust of bread, your\r\nHighness!” he pleaded.\r\n\r\n{Image...'Drink this!'}\r\n\r\nHe was a fine old man, but looked sadly ill and worn. “A crust of bread\r\nis what I crave!” he repeated. “A single crust, and a little water!”\r\n\r\n“Here's some water, drink this!”\r\n\r\nUggug bellowed, emptying a jug of water over his head.\r\n\r\n“Well done, my boy!” cried the Vice-Warden.\r\n\r\n“That's the way to settle such folk!”\r\n\r\n“Clever boy!”, the Wardeness chimed in. “Hasn't he good spirits?”\r\n\r\n“Take a stick to him!” shouted the Vice-Warden, as the old Beggar shook\r\nthe water from his ragged cloak, and again gazed meekly upwards.\r\n\r\n“Take a red-hot poker to him!” my Lady again chimed in.\r\n\r\nPossibly there was no red-hot poker handy: but some sticks were\r\nforthcoming in a moment, and threatening faces surrounded the poor old\r\nwanderer, who waved them back with quiet dignity. “No need to break my\r\nold bones,” he said. “I am going. Not even a crust!”\r\n\r\n“Poor, poor old man!” exclaimed a little voice at my side, half choked\r\nwith sobs. Bruno was at the window, trying to throw out his slice of\r\nplum-cake, but Sylvie held him back.\r\n\r\n“He shalt have my cake!” Bruno cried, passionately struggling out of\r\nSylvie's arms.\r\n\r\n“Yes, yes, darling!” Sylvie gently pleaded. “But don't throw it out!\r\nHe's gone away, don't you see? Let's go after him.” And she led him\r\nout of the room, unnoticed by the rest of the party, who were wholly\r\nabsorbed in watching the old Beggar.\r\n\r\nThe Conspirators returned to their seats, and continued their\r\nconversation in an undertone, so as not to be heard by Uggug, who was\r\nstill standing at the window.\r\n\r\n“By the way, there was something about Bruno succeeding to the\r\nWrardenship,” said my Lady. “How does that stand in the new Agreement?”\r\n\r\nThe Chancellor chuckled. “Just the same, word for word,” he said, “with\r\none exception, my Lady. Instead of 'Bruno,' I've taken the liberty to\r\nput in--” he dropped his voice to a whisper, “to put in 'Uggug,' you\r\nknow!”\r\n\r\n“Uggug, indeed!” I exclaimed, in a burst of indignation I could no\r\nlonger control. To bring out even that one word seemed a gigantic\r\neffort: but, the cry once uttered, all effort ceased at once: a sudden\r\ngust swept away the whole scene, and I found myself sitting up, staring\r\nat the young lady in the opposite corner of the carriage, who had now\r\nthrown back her veil, and was looking at me with an expression of amused\r\nsurprise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 5. A BEGGAR'S PALACE.\r\n\r\nThat I had said something, in the act of waking, I felt sure: the hoarse\r\nstifled cry was still ringing in my ears, even if the startled look\r\nof my fellow-traveler had not been evidence enough: but what could I\r\npossibly say by way of apology?\r\n\r\n“I hope I didn't frighten you?” I stammered out at last. “I have no idea\r\nwhat I said. I was dreaming.”\r\n\r\n“You said 'Uggug indeed!'” the young lady replied, with quivering lips\r\nthat would curve themselves into a smile, in spite of all her efforts to\r\nlook grave. “At least--you didn't say it--you shouted it!”\r\n\r\n“I'm very sorry,” was all I could say, feeling very penitent and\r\nhelpless. “She has Sylvie's eyes!” I thought to myself, half-doubting\r\nwhether, even now, I were fairly awake. “And that sweet look of innocent\r\nwonder is all Sylvie's too. But Sylvie hasn't got that calm resolute\r\nmouth nor that far-away look of dreamy sadness, like one that has had\r\nsome deep sorrow, very long ago--” And the thick-coming fancies almost\r\nprevented my hearing the lady's next words.\r\n\r\n“If you had had a 'Shilling Dreadful' in your hand,” she proceeded,\r\n“something about Ghosts or Dynamite or Midnight Murder--one could\r\nunderstand it: those things aren't worth the shilling, unless they give\r\none a Nightmare. But really--with only a medical treatise, you know--”\r\n and she glanced, with a pretty shrug of contempt, at the book over which\r\nI had fallen asleep.\r\n\r\nHer friendliness, and utter unreserve, took me aback for a moment; yet\r\nthere was no touch of forwardness, or boldness, about the child\r\nfor child, almost, she seemed to be: I guessed her at scarcely over\r\ntwenty--all was the innocent frankness of some angelic visitant, new\r\nto the ways of earth and the conventionalisms or, if you will, the\r\nbarbarisms--of Society. “Even so,” I mused, “will Sylvie look and speak,\r\nin another ten years.”\r\n\r\n“You don't care for Ghosts, then,” I ventured to suggest, “unless they\r\nare really terrifying?”\r\n\r\n“Quite so,” the lady assented. “The regular Railway-Ghosts--I mean the\r\nGhosts of ordinary Railway-literature--are very poor affairs. I feel\r\ninclined to say, with Alexander Selkirk, 'Their tameness is shocking to\r\nme'! And they never do any Midnight Murders. They couldn't 'welter in\r\ngore,' to save their lives!”\r\n\r\n“'Weltering in gore' is a very expressive phrase, certainly. Can it be\r\ndone in any fluid, I wonder?”\r\n\r\n“I think not,” the lady readily replied--quite as if she had thought it\r\nout, long ago. “It has to be something thick. For instance, you might\r\nwelter in bread-sauce. That, being white, would be more suitable for a\r\nGhost, supposing it wished to welter!”\r\n\r\n“You have a real good terrifying Ghost in that book?” I hinted.\r\n\r\n“How could you guess?” she exclaimed with the most engaging frankness,\r\nand placed the volume in my hands. I opened it eagerly, with a not\r\nunpleasant thrill (like what a good ghost-story gives one) at the\r\n'uncanny' coincidence of my having so unexpectedly divined the subject\r\nof her studies.\r\n\r\nIt was a book of Domestic Cookery, open at the article Bread Sauce.'\r\n\r\nI returned the book, looking, I suppose, a little blank, as the lady\r\nlaughed merrily at my discomfiture. “It's far more exciting than some\r\nof the modern ghosts, I assure you! Now there was a Ghost last month--I\r\ndon't mean a real Ghost in in Supernature--but in a Magazine. It was\r\na perfectly flavourless Ghost. It wouldn't have frightened a mouse! It\r\nwasn't a Ghost that one would even offer a chair to!”\r\n\r\n“Three score years and ten, baldness, and spectacles, have their\r\nadvantages after all!”, I said to myself. “Instead of a bashful youth\r\nand maiden, gasping out monosyllables at awful intervals, here we have\r\nan old man and a child, quite at their ease, talking as if they had\r\nknown each other for years! Then you think,” I continued aloud, “that\r\nwe ought sometimes to ask a Ghost to sit down? But have we any authority\r\nfor it? In Shakespeare, for instance--there are plenty of ghosts\r\nthere--does Shakespeare ever give the stage-direction 'hands chair to\r\nGhost'?”\r\n\r\nThe lady looked puzzled and thoughtful for a moment: then she almost\r\nclapped her hands. “Yes, yes, he does!” she cried. “He makes Hamlet say\r\n'Rest, rest, perturbed Spirit!”'\r\n\r\n“And that, I suppose, means an easy-chair?”\r\n\r\n“An American rocking-chair, I think--”\r\n\r\n“Fayfield Junction, my Lady, change for Elveston!” the guard announced,\r\nflinging open the door of the carriage: and we soon found ourselves,\r\nwith all our portable property around us, on the platform.\r\n\r\nThe accommodation, provided for passengers waiting at this Junction, was\r\ndistinctly inadequate--a single wooden bench, apparently intended for\r\nthree sitters only: and even this was already partially occupied by\r\na very old man, in a smock frock, who sat, with rounded shoulders and\r\ndrooping head, and with hands clasped on the top of his stick so as to\r\nmake a sort of pillow for that wrinkled face with its look of patient\r\nweariness.\r\n\r\n“Come, you be off!” the Station-master roughly accosted the poor old\r\nman. “You be off, and make way for your betters! This way, my Lady!” he\r\nadded in a perfectly different tone. “If your Ladyship will take a seat,\r\nthe train will be up in a few minutes.” The cringing servility of his\r\nmanner was due, no doubt, to the address legible on the pile of luggage,\r\nwhich announced their owner to be “Lady Muriel Orme, passenger to\r\nElveston, via Fayfield Junction.”\r\n\r\nAs I watched the old man slowly rise to his feet, and hobble a few paces\r\ndown the platform, the lines came to my lips:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    “From sackcloth couch the Monk arose,\r\n    With toil his stiffen'd limbs he rear'd;\r\n    A hundred years had flung their snows\r\n    On his thin locks and floating beard.”\r\n\r\n{Image...'Come, you be off!'}\r\n\r\nBut the lady scarcely noticed the little incident. After one glance\r\nat the 'banished man,' who stood tremulously leaning on his stick, she\r\nturned to me. “This is not an American rocking-chair, by any means!\r\nYet may I say,” slightly changing her place, so as to make room for me\r\nbeside her, “may I say, in Hamlet's words, 'Rest, rest--'” she broke off\r\nwith a silvery laugh.\r\n\r\n“--perturbed Spirit!”' I finished the sentence for her. “Yes, that\r\ndescribes a railway-traveler exactly! And here is an instance of it,” I\r\nadded, as the tiny local train drew up alongside the platform, and the\r\nporters bustled about, opening carriage-doors--one of them helping the\r\npoor old man to hoist himself into a third-class carriage, while another\r\nof them obsequiously conducted the lady and myself into a first-class.\r\n\r\nShe paused, before following him, to watch the progress of the other\r\npassenger. “Poor old man!” she said. “How weak and ill he looks! It was\r\na shame to let him be turned away like that. I'm very sorry--” At this\r\nmoment it dawned on me that these words were not addressed to me, but\r\nthat she was unconsciously thinking aloud. I moved away a few steps,\r\nand waited to follow her into the carriage, where I resumed the\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n“Shakespeare must have traveled by rail, if only in a dream: 'perturbed\r\nSpirit' is such a happy phrase.”\r\n\r\n“'Perturbed' referring, no doubt,” she rejoined, “to the sensational\r\nbooklets peculiar to the Rail. If Steam has done nothing else, it has at\r\nleast added a whole new Species to English Literature!”\r\n\r\n“No doubt of it,” I echoed. “The true origin of all our medical\r\nbooks--and all our cookery-books--”\r\n\r\n“No, no!” she broke in merrily. “I didn't mean our Literature! We are\r\nquite abnormal. But the booklets--the little thrilling romances, where\r\nthe Murder comes at page fifteen, and the Wedding at page forty--surely\r\nthey are due to Steam?”\r\n\r\n“And when we travel by Electricity if I may venture to develop your\r\ntheory we shall have leaflets instead of booklets, and the Murder and\r\nthe Wedding will come on the same page.”\r\n\r\n“A development worthy of Darwin!”, the lady exclaimed enthusiastically.\r\n“Only you reverse his theory. Instead of developing a mouse into an\r\nelephant, you would develop an elephant into a mouse!” But here we\r\nplunged into a tunnel, and I leaned back and closed my eyes for a\r\nmoment, trying to recall a few of the incidents of my recent dream.\r\n\r\n“I thought I saw--” I murmured sleepily: and then the phrase insisted\r\non conjugating itself, and ran into “you thought you saw--he thought he\r\nsaw--” and then it suddenly went off into a song:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    “He thought he saw an Elephant,\r\n    That practised on a fife:\r\n    He looked again, and found it was\r\n    A letter from his wife.\r\n    'At length I realise,' he said,\r\n    “The bitterness of Life!'”\r\n\r\nAnd what a wild being it was who sang these wild words! A Gardener\r\nhe seemed to be yet surely a mad one, by the way he brandished his\r\nrake--madder, by the way he broke, ever and anon, into a frantic\r\njig--maddest of all, by the shriek in which he brought out the last\r\nwords of the stanza!\r\n\r\n{Image....The gardener}\r\n\r\nIt was so far a description of himself that he had the feet of an\r\nElephant: but the rest of him was skin and bone: and the wisps of\r\nloose straw, that bristled all about him, suggested that he had been\r\noriginally stuffed with it, and that nearly all the stuffing had come\r\nout.\r\n\r\nSylvie and Bruno waited patiently till the end of the first verse. Then\r\nSylvie advanced alone (Bruno having suddenly turned shy) and timidly\r\nintroduced herself with the words “Please, I'm Sylvie!”\r\n\r\n“And who's that other thing?', said the Gardener.\r\n\r\n“What thing?” said Sylvie, looking round. “Oh, that's Bruno. He's my\r\nbrother.”\r\n\r\n“Was he your brother yesterday?” the Gardener anxiously enquired.\r\n\r\n“Course I were!” cried Bruno, who had gradually crept nearer, and\r\ndidn't at all like being talked about without having his share in the\r\nconversation.\r\n\r\n“Ah, well!” the Gardener said with a kind of groan. “Things change so,\r\nhere. Whenever I look again, it's sure to be something different! Yet I\r\ndoes my duty! I gets up wriggle-early at five--”\r\n\r\n“If I was oo,” said Bruno, “I wouldn't wriggle so early. It's as bad as\r\nbeing a worm!” he added, in an undertone to Sylvie.\r\n\r\n“But you shouldn't be lazy in the morning, Bruno,” said Sylvie.\r\n“Remember, it's the early bird that picks up the worm!”\r\n\r\n“It may, if it likes!” Bruno said with a slight yawn. “I don't like\r\neating worms, one bit. I always stop in bed till the early bird has\r\npicked them up!”\r\n\r\n“I wonder you've the face to tell me such fibs!” cried the Gardener.\r\n\r\nTo which Bruno wisely replied “Oo don't want a face to tell fibs\r\nwiz--only a mouf.”\r\n\r\nSylvie discreetly changed the subject. “And did you plant all these\r\nflowers?” she said.\r\n\r\n“What a lovely garden you've made! Do you know, I'd like to live here\r\nalways!”\r\n\r\n“In the winter-nights--” the Gardener was beginning.\r\n\r\n“But I'd nearly forgotten what we came about!” Sylvie interrupted.\r\n“Would you please let us through into the road? There's a poor old\r\nbeggar just gone out--and he's very hungry--and Bruno wants to give him\r\nhis cake, you know!”\r\n\r\n“It's as much as my place is worth!” the Gardener muttered, taking a key\r\nfrom his pocket, and beginning to unlock a door in the garden-wall.\r\n\r\n“How much are it wurf?” Bruno innocently enquired.\r\n\r\nBut the Gardener only grinned. “That's a secret!” he said. “Mind you\r\ncome back quick!” he called after the children, as they passed out into\r\nthe road. I had just time to follow them, before he shut the door again.\r\n\r\nWe hurried down the road, and very soon caught sight of the old Beggar,\r\nabout a quarter of a mile ahead of us, and the children at once set off\r\nrunning to overtake him.\r\n\r\nLightly and swiftly they skimmed over the ground, and I could not in\r\nthe least understand how it was I kept up with them so easily. But the\r\nunsolved problem did not worry me so much as at another time it might\r\nhave done, there were so many other things to attend to.\r\n\r\nThe old Beggar must have been very deaf, as he paid no attention\r\nwhatever to Bruno's eager shouting, but trudged wearily on, never\r\npausing until the child got in front of him and held up the slice of\r\ncake. The poor little fellow was quite out of breath, and could only\r\nutter the one word “Cake!” not with the gloomy decision with which\r\nHer Excellency had so lately pronounced it, but with a sweet childish\r\ntimidity, looking up into the old man's face with eyes that loved 'all\r\nthings both great and small.'\r\n\r\nThe old man snatched it from him, and devoured it greedily, as some\r\nhungry wild beast might have done, but never a word of thanks did he\r\ngive his little benefactor--only growled “More, more!” and glared at the\r\nhalf-frightened children.\r\n\r\n“There is no more!”, Sylvie said with tears in her eyes. “I'd eaten\r\nmine. It was a shame to let you be turned away like that. I'm very\r\nsorry--”\r\n\r\nI lost the rest of the sentence, for my mind had recurred, with a great\r\nshock of surprise, to Lady Muriel Orme, who had so lately uttered\r\nthese very words of Sylvie's--yes, and in Sylvie's own voice, and with\r\nSylvie's gentle pleading eyes!\r\n\r\n“Follow me!” were the next words I heard, as the old man waved his hand,\r\nwith a dignified grace that ill suited his ragged dress, over a bush,\r\nthat stood by the road side, which began instantly to sink into the\r\nearth. At another time I might have doubted the evidence of my eyes,\r\nor at least have felt some astonishment: but, in this strange scene, my\r\nwhole being seemed absorbed in strong curiosity as to what would happen\r\nnext.\r\n\r\nWhen the bush had sunk quite out of our sight, marble steps were seen,\r\nleading downwards into darkness. The old man led the way, and we eagerly\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nThe staircase was so dark, at first, that I could only just see the\r\nforms of the children, as, hand-in-hand, they groped their way down\r\nafter their guide: but it got lighter every moment, with a strange\r\nsilvery brightness, that seemed to exist in the air, as there were no\r\nlamps visible; and, when at last we reached a level floor, the room, in\r\nwhich we found ourselves, was almost as light as day.\r\n\r\nIt was eight-sided, having in each angle a slender pillar, round which\r\nsilken draperies were twined. The wall between the pillars was entirely\r\ncovered, to the height of six or seven feet, with creepers, from which\r\nhung quantities of ripe fruit and of brilliant flowers, that almost hid\r\nthe leaves. In another place, perchance, I might have wondered to see\r\nfruit and flowers growing together: here, my chief wonder was that\r\nneither fruit nor flowers were such as I had ever seen before. Higher\r\nup, each wall contained a circular window of coloured glass; and over\r\nall was an arched roof, that seemed to be spangled all over with jewels.\r\n\r\nWith hardly less wonder, I turned this way and that, trying to make\r\nout how in the world we had come in: for there was no door: and all the\r\nwalls were thickly covered with the lovely creepers.\r\n\r\n“We are safe here, my darlings!” said the old man, laying a hand on\r\nSylvie's shoulder, and bending down to kiss her. Sylvie drew back\r\nhastily, with an offended air: but in another moment, with a glad cry of\r\n“Why, it's Father!”, she had run into his arms.\r\n\r\n{Image...A beggar's palace}\r\n\r\n“Father! Father!” Bruno repeated: and, while the happy children were\r\nbeing hugged and kissed, I could but rub my eyes and say “Where, then,\r\nare the rags gone to?”; for the old man was now dressed in royal robes\r\nthat glittered with jewels and gold embroidery, and wore a circlet of\r\ngold around his head.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 6. THE MAGIC LOCKET.\r\n\r\n“Where are we, father?” Sylvie whispered, with her arms twined closely\r\naround the old man's neck, and with her rosy cheek lovingly pressed to\r\nhis.\r\n\r\n“In Elfland, darling. It's one of the provinces of Fairyland.”\r\n\r\n“But I thought Elfland was ever so far from Outland: and we've come such\r\na tiny little way!”\r\n\r\n“You came by the Royal Road, sweet one. Only those of royal blood can\r\ntravel along it: but you've been royal ever since I was made King of\r\nElfland that's nearly a month ago. They sent two ambassadors, to make\r\nsure that their invitation to me, to be their new King, should reach me.\r\nOne was a Prince; so he was able to come by the Royal Road, and to come\r\ninvisibly to all but me: the other was a Baron; so he had to come by the\r\ncommon road, and I dare say he hasn't even arrived yet.”\r\n\r\n“Then how far have we come?” Sylvie enquired.\r\n\r\n“Just a thousand miles, sweet one, since the Gardener unlocked that door\r\nfor you.”\r\n\r\n“A thousand miles!” Bruno repeated. “And may I eat one?”\r\n\r\n“Eat a mile, little rogue?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Bruno. “I mean may I eat one of that fruits?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, child,” said his father: “and then you'll find out what Pleasure\r\nis like--the Pleasure we all seek so madly, and enjoy so mournfully!”\r\n\r\nBruno ran eagerly to the wall, and picked a fruit that was shaped\r\nsomething like a banana, but had the colour of a strawberry.\r\n\r\nHe ate it with beaming looks, that became gradually more gloomy, and\r\nwere very blank indeed by the time he had finished.\r\n\r\n“It hasn't got no taste at all!” he complained. “I couldn't feel nuffin\r\nin my mouf! It's a--what's that hard word, Sylvie?”\r\n\r\n“It was a Phlizz,” Sylvie gravely replied. “Are they all like that,\r\nfather?”\r\n\r\n“They're all like that to you, darling, because you don't belong to\r\nElfland--yet. But to me they are real.”\r\n\r\nBruno looked puzzled. “I'll try anuvver kind of fruits!” he said, and\r\njumped down off the King's knee. “There's some lovely striped ones, just\r\nlike a rainbow!” And off he ran.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Fairy-King and Sylvie were talking together, but in such\r\nlow tones that I could not catch the words: so I followed Bruno, who\r\nwas picking and eating other kinds of fruit, in the vain hope of finding\r\nsome that had a taste. I tried to pick so me myself--but it was like\r\ngrasping air, and I soon gave up the attempt and returned to Sylvie.\r\n\r\n“Look well at it, my darling,” the old man was saying, “and tell me how\r\nyou like it.”\r\n\r\n“'It's just lovely,” cried Sylvie, delightedly. “Bruno, come and\r\nlook!” And she held up, so that he might see the light through it, a\r\nheart-shaped Locket, apparently cut out of a single jewel, of a rich\r\nblue colour, with a slender gold chain attached to it.\r\n\r\n“It are welly pretty,” Bruno more soberly remarked: and he began\r\nspelling out some words inscribed on it. “All--will--love--Sylvie,” he\r\nmade them out at last. “And so they doos!” he cried, clasping his arms\r\nround her neck. “Everybody loves Sylvie!”\r\n\r\n“But we love her best, don't we, Bruno?” said the old King, as he took\r\npossession of the Locket. “Now, Sylvie, look at this.” And he showed\r\nher, lying on the palm of his hand, a Locket of a deep crimson colour,\r\nthe same shape as the blue one and, like it, attached to a slender\r\ngolden chain.\r\n\r\n“Lovelier and lovelier!” exclaimed Sylvie, clasping her hands in\r\necstasy. “Look, Bruno!”\r\n\r\n“And there's words on this one, too,” said Bruno.\r\n“Sylvie--will--love--all.”\r\n\r\n“Now you see the difference,” said the old man: “different colours and\r\ndifferent words.”\r\n\r\n“Choose one of them, darling. I'll give you which ever you like best.”\r\n\r\n{Image...The crimson locket}\r\n\r\nSylvie whispered the words, several times over, with a thoughtful smile,\r\nand then made her decision. “It's very nice to be loved,” she said: “but\r\nit's nicer to love other people! May I have the red one, Father?”\r\n\r\nThe old man said nothing: but I could see his eyes fill with tears, as\r\nhe bent his head and pressed his lips to her forehead in a long loving\r\nkiss. Then he undid the chain, and showed her how to fasten it round her\r\nneck, and to hide it away under the edge of her frock. “It's for you\r\nto keep you know he said in a low voice, not for other people to see.\r\nYou'll remember how to use it?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I'll remember,” said Sylvie.\r\n\r\n“And now darlings it's time for you to go back or they'll be missing you\r\nand then that poor Gardener will get into trouble!”\r\n\r\nOnce more a feeling of wonder rose in my mind as to how in the world we\r\nwere to get back again--since I took it for granted that wherever the\r\nchildren went I was to go--but no shadow of doubt seemed to cross\r\ntheir minds as they hugged and kissed him murmuring over and over again\r\n“Good-bye darling Father!” And then suddenly and swiftly the darkness\r\nof midnight seemed to close in upon us and through the darkness harshly\r\nrang a strange wild song:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    He thought he saw a Buffalo\r\n    Upon the chimney-piece:\r\n    He looked again, and found it was\r\n    His Sister's Husband's Niece.\r\n    'Unless you leave this house,' he said,\r\n    'I'll send for the Police!'\r\n\r\n{Image...'He thought he saw a buffalo'}\r\n\r\n“That was me!” he added, looking out at us, through the half-opened\r\ndoor, as we stood waiting in the road.' “And that's what I'd have\r\ndone--as sure as potatoes aren't radishes--if she hadn't have tooken\r\nherself off! But I always loves my pay-rints like anything.”\r\n\r\n“Who are oor pay-rints?” said Bruno.\r\n\r\n“Them as pay rint for me, a course!” the Gardener replied. “You can come\r\nin now, if you like.”\r\n\r\nHe flung the door open as he spoke, and we got out, a little dazzled\r\nand stupefied (at least I felt so) at the sudden transition from\r\nthe half-darkness of the railway-carriage to the brilliantly-lighted\r\nplatform of Elveston Station.\r\n\r\nA footman, in a handsome livery, came forwards and respectfully touched\r\nhis hat. “The carriage is here, my Lady,” he said, taking from her\r\nthe wraps and small articles she was carrying: and Lady Muriel, after\r\nshaking hands and bidding me “Good-night!” with a pleasant smile,\r\nfollowed him.\r\n\r\nIt was with a somewhat blank and lonely feeling that I betook myself to\r\nthe van from which the luggage was being taken out: and, after giving\r\ndirections to have my boxes sent after me, I made my way on foot to\r\nArthur's lodgings, and soon lost my lonely feeling in the hearty welcome\r\nmy old friend gave me, and the cozy warmth and cheerful light of the\r\nlittle sitting-room into which he led me.\r\n\r\n“Little, as you see, but quite enough for us two. Now, take the\r\neasy-chair, old fellow, and let's have another look at you! Well, you\r\ndo look a bit pulled down!” and he put on a solemn professional air.\r\n“I prescribe Ozone, quant. suff. Social dissipation, fiant pilulae quam\r\nplurimae: to be taken, feasting, three times a day!”\r\n\r\n“But, Doctor!” I remonstrated. “Society doesn't 'receive' three times a\r\nday!”\r\n\r\n“That's all you know about it!” the young Doctor gaily replied. “At\r\nhome, lawn-tennis, 3 P.M. At home, kettledrum, 5 P.M. At home, music\r\n(Elveston doesn't give dinners), 8 P.M. Carriages at 10. There you are!”\r\n\r\nIt sounded very pleasant, I was obliged to admit. “And I know some\r\nof the lady-society already,” I added. “One of them came in the same\r\ncarriage with me.”\r\n\r\n“What was she like? Then perhaps I can identify her.”\r\n\r\n“The name was Lady Muriel Orme. As to what she was like--well, I thought\r\nher very beautiful. Do you know her?”\r\n\r\n“Yes--I do know her.” And the grave Doctor coloured slightly as he added\r\n“Yes, I agree with you. She is beautiful.”\r\n\r\n“I quite lost my heart to her!” I went on mischievously. “We talked--”\r\n\r\n“Have some supper!” Arthur interrupted with an air of relief, as the\r\nmaid entered with the tray. And he steadily resisted all my attempts to\r\nreturn to the subject of Lady Muriel until the evening had almost worn\r\nitself away. Then, as we sat gazing into the fire, and conversation was\r\nlapsing into silence, he made a hurried confession.\r\n\r\n“I hadn't meant to tell you anything about her,” he said (naming no\r\nnames, as if there were only one 'she' in the world!) “till you had\r\nseen more of her, and formed your own judgment of her: but somehow you\r\nsurprised it out of me. And I've not breathed a word of it to any one\r\nelse. But I can trust you with a secret, old friend! Yes! It's true of\r\nme, what I suppose you said in jest.\r\n\r\n“In the merest jest, believe me!” I said earnestly. “Why, man, I'm three\r\ntimes her age! But if she's your choice, then I'm sure she's all that is\r\ngood and--”\r\n\r\n“--and sweet,” Arthur went on, “and pure, and self-denying, and\r\ntrue-hearted, and--” he broke off hastily, as if he could not trust\r\nhimself to say more on a subject so sacred and so precious. Silence\r\nfollowed: and I leaned back drowsily in my easy-chair, filled with\r\nbright and beautiful imaginings of Arthur and his lady-love, and of all\r\nthe peace and happiness in store for them.\r\n\r\nI pictured them to myself walking together, lingeringly and lovingly,\r\nunder arching trees, in a sweet garden of their own, and welcomed back\r\nby their faithful gardener, on their return from some brief excursion.\r\n\r\nIt seemed natural enough that the gardener should be filled with\r\nexuberant delight at the return of so gracious a master and mistress and\r\nhow strangely childlike they looked! I could have taken them for Sylvie\r\nand Bruno less natural that he should show it by such wild dances, such\r\ncrazy songs!\r\n\r\n\r\n    “He thought he saw a Rattlesnake\r\n    That questioned him in Greek:\r\n    He looked again, and found it was\r\n    The Middle of Next Week.\r\n    'The one thing I regret,' he said,\r\n    'Is that it cannot speak!”\r\n\r\n--least natural of all that the Vice-Warden and 'my Lady' should be\r\nstanding close beside me, discussing an open letter, which had just been\r\nhanded to him by the Professor, who stood, meekly waiting, a few yards\r\noff.\r\n\r\n“If it were not for those two brats,” I heard him mutter, glancing\r\nsavagely at Sylvie and Bruno, who were courteously listening to the\r\nGardener's song, “there would be no difficulty whatever.”\r\n\r\n“Let's hear that bit of the letter again,” said my Lady. And the\r\nVice-Warden read aloud:--\r\n\r\n“--and we therefore entreat you graciously to accept the Kingship, to\r\nwhich you have been unanimously elected by the Council of Elfland: and\r\nthat you will allow your son Bruno of whose goodness, cleverness, and\r\nbeauty, reports have reached us--to be regarded as Heir-Apparent.”\r\n\r\n“But what's the difficulty?” said my Lady.\r\n\r\n“Why, don't you see? The Ambassador, that brought this, is waiting in\r\nthe house: and he's sure to see Sylvie and Bruno: and then, when he sees\r\nUggug, and remembers all that about 'goodness, cleverness, and beauty,'\r\nwhy, he's sure to--”\r\n\r\n“And where will you find a better boy than Uggug?” my Lady indignantly\r\ninterrupted. “Or a wittier, or a lovelier?”\r\n\r\nTo all of which the Vice-Warden simply replied “Don't you be a great\r\nblethering goose! Our only chance is to keep those two brats out of\r\nsight. If you can manage that, you may leave the rest to me. I'll make\r\nhim believe Uggug to be a model of cleverness and all that.”\r\n\r\n“We must change his name to Bruno, of course?” said my Lady.\r\n\r\nThe Vice-Warden rubbed his chin. “Humph! No!” he said musingly.\r\n“Wouldn't do. The boy's such an utter idiot, he'd never learn to answer\r\nto it.”\r\n\r\n“Idiot, indeed!” cried my Lady. “He's no more an idiot than I am!”\r\n\r\n“You're right, my dear,” the Vice-Warden soothingly I replied. “He\r\nisn't, indeed!”\r\n\r\nMy Lady was appeased. “Let's go in and receive the Ambassador,” she\r\nsaid, and beckoned to the Professor. “Which room is he waiting in?” she\r\ninquired.\r\n\r\n“In the Library, Madam.”\r\n\r\n“And what did you say his name was?” said the Vice-Warden.\r\n\r\nThe Professor referred to a card he held in his hand. “His Adiposity the\r\nBaron Doppelgeist.”\r\n\r\n“Why does he come with such a funny name?” said my Lady.\r\n\r\n“He couldn't well change it on the journey,” the Professor meekly\r\nreplied, “because of the luggage.”\r\n\r\n“You go and receive him,” my Lady said to the Vice-Warden, “and I'll\r\nattend to the children.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 7. THE BARONS EMBASSY.\r\n\r\nI was following the Vice-Warden, but, on second thoughts, went after my\r\nLady, being curious to see how she would manage to keep the children out\r\nof sight.\r\n\r\nI found her holding Sylvie's hand, and with her other hand stroking\r\nBruno's hair in a most tender and motherly fashion: both children were\r\nlooking bewildered and half-frightened.\r\n\r\n“My own darlings,” she was saying, “I've been planning a little treat\r\nfor you! The Professor shall take you a long walk into the woods this\r\nbeautiful evening: and you shall take a basket of food with you, and\r\nhave a little picnic down by the river!”\r\n\r\nBruno jumped, and clapped his hands. “That are nice!” he cried. “Aren't\r\nit, Sylvie?”\r\n\r\nSylvie, who hadn't quite lost her surprised look, put up her mouth for a\r\nkiss. “Thank you very much,” she said earnestly.\r\n\r\nMy Lady turned her head away to conceal the broad grin of triumph that\r\nspread over her vast face, like a ripple on a lake. “Little simpletons!”\r\n she muttered to herself, as she marched up to the house. I followed her\r\nin.\r\n\r\n“Quite so, your Excellency,” the Baron was saying as we entered the\r\nLibrary. “All the infantry were under my command.” He turned, and was\r\nduly presented to my Lady.\r\n\r\n“A military hero?” said my Lady. The fat little man simpered. “Well,\r\nyes,” he replied, modestly casting down his eyes. “My ancestors were all\r\nfamous for military genius.”\r\n\r\nMy Lady smiled graciously. “It often runs in families,” she remarked:\r\n“just as a love for pastry does.”\r\n\r\nThe Baron looked slightly offended, and the Vice-Warden discreetly\r\nchanged the subject. “Dinner will soon be ready,” he said. “May I have\r\nthe honour of conducting your Adiposity to the guest-chamber?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly, certainly!” the Baron eagerly assented. “It would never do\r\nto keep dinner waiting!” And he almost trotted out of the room after the\r\nVice-Warden.\r\n\r\nHe was back again so speedily that the Vice-warden had barely time\r\nto explain to my Lady that her remark about “a love for pastry” was\r\n“unfortunate. You might have seen, with half an eye,” he added, “that\r\nthat's his line. Military genius, indeed! Pooh!”\r\n\r\n“Dinner ready yet?” the Baron enquired, as he hurried into the room.\r\n\r\n“Will be in a few minutes,” the Vice-Warden replied. “Meanwhile, let's\r\ntake a turn in the garden. You were telling me,” he continued, as the\r\ntrio left the house, “something about a great battle in which you had\r\nthe command of the infantry--”\r\n\r\n“True,” said the Baron. “The enemy, as I was saying, far outnumbered\r\nus: but I marched my men right into the middle of--what's that?” the\r\nMilitary Hero exclaimed in agitated tones, drawing back behind the\r\nVice-Warden, as a strange creature rushed wildly upon them, brandishing\r\na spade.\r\n\r\n“It's only the Gardener!” the Vice-Warden replied in an encouraging\r\ntone. “Quite harmless, I assure you. Hark, he's singing! Its his\r\nfavorite amusement.”\r\n\r\nAnd once more those shrill discordant tones rang out:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    “He thought he saw a Banker's Clerk\r\n    Descending from the bus:\r\n    He looked again, and found it was\r\n    A Hippopotamus:\r\n    'If this should stay to dine,' he said,\r\n    'There won't be mutch for us!'”\r\n\r\nThrowing away the spade, he broke into a frantic jig, snapping his\r\nfingers, and repeating, again and again,\r\n\r\n\r\n    “There won't be much for us!\r\n    There won't be much for us!”\r\n\r\n{Image...It was a hippoptamus}\r\n\r\nOnce more the Baron looked slightly offended, but the Vice-Warden\r\nhastily explained that the song had no allusion to him, and in fact had\r\nno meaning at all. “You didn't mean anything by it, now did you?”\r\n He appealed to the Gardener, who had finished his song, and stood,\r\nbalancing himself on one leg, and looking at them, with his mouth open.\r\n\r\n“I never means nothing,” said the Gardener: and Uggug luckily came up at\r\nthe moment, and gave the conversation a new turn.\r\n\r\n“Allow me to present my son,” said the Vice-warden; adding, in a\r\nwhisper, “one of the best and cleverest boys that ever lived! I'll\r\ncontrive for you to see some of his cleverness. He knows everything that\r\nother boys don't know; and in archery, in fishing, in painting, and\r\nin music, his skill is--but you shall judge for yourself. You see that\r\ntarget over there? He shall shoot an arrow at it. Dear boy,” he went on\r\naloud, “his Adiposity would like to see you shoot. Bring his Highness'\r\nbow and arrows!”\r\n\r\nUggug looked very sulky as he received the bow and arrow, and prepared\r\nto shoot. Just as the arrow left the bow, the Vice-Warden trod heavily\r\non the toe of the Baron, who yelled with the pain.\r\n\r\n“Ten thousand pardons!” he exclaimed. “I stepped back in my excitement.\r\nSee! It is a bull's-eye!”\r\n\r\nThe Baron gazed in astonishment. “He held the bow so awkwardly, it\r\nseemed impossible!” he muttered. But there was no room for doubt: there\r\nwas the arrow, right in the centre of the bull's-eye!\r\n\r\n“The lake is close by,” continued the Vice-warden. “Bring his Highness'\r\nfishing-rod!” And Uggug most unwillingly held the rod, and dangled the\r\nfly over the water.\r\n\r\n“A beetle on your arm!” cried my Lady, pinching the poor Baron's\r\narm worse than if ten lobsters had seized it at once. “That kind is\r\npoisonous,” she explained. “But what a pity! You missed seeing the fish\r\npulled out!”\r\n\r\nAn enormous dead cod-fish was lying on the bank, with the hook in its\r\nmouth.\r\n\r\n“I had always fancied,” the Baron faltered, “that cod were salt-water\r\nfish?”\r\n\r\n“Not in this country,” said the Vice-Warden. “Shall we go in? Ask my son\r\nsome question on the way any subject you like!” And the sulky boy was\r\nviolently shoved forwards, to walk at the Baron's side.\r\n\r\n“Could your Highness tell me,” the Baron cautiously began, “how much\r\nseven times nine would come to?”\r\n\r\n“Turn to the left!” cried the Vice-Warden, hastily stepping forwards to\r\nshow the way---so hastily, that he ran against his unfortunate guest,\r\nwho fell heavily on his face.\r\n\r\n“So sorry!” my Lady exclaimed, as she and her husband helped him to his\r\nfeet again. “My son was in the act of saying 'sixty-three' as you fell!”\r\n\r\nThe Baron said nothing: he was covered with dust, and seemed much hurt,\r\nboth in body and mind. However, when they had got him into the house,\r\nand given him a good brushing, matters looked a little better.\r\n\r\nDinner was served in due course, and every fresh dish seemed to increase\r\nthe good-humour of the Baron: but all efforts, to get him to express his\r\nopinion as to Uggug's cleverness, were in vain, until that interesting\r\nyouth had left the room, and was seen from the open window, prowling\r\nabout the lawn with a little basket, which he was filling with frogs.\r\n\r\n“So fond of Natural History as he is, dear boy!” said the doting mother.\r\n“Now do tell us, Baron, what you think of him!”\r\n\r\n“To be perfectly candid,” said the cautious Baron, “I would like a\r\nlittle more evidence. I think you mentioned his skill in--”\r\n\r\n“Music?” said the Vice-Warden. “Why, he's simply a prodigy! You shall\r\nhear him play the piano.” And he walked to the window. “Ug--I mean my\r\nboy! Come in for a minute, and bring the music-master with you! To turn\r\nover the music for him,” he added as an explanation.\r\n\r\nUggug, having filled his basket with frogs, had no objection to obey,\r\nand soon appeared in the room, followed by a fierce-looking little man,\r\nwho asked the Vice-Warden “Vot music vill you haf?”\r\n\r\n“The Sonata that His Highness plays so charmingly,” said the\r\nVice-Warden. “His Highness haf not--” the music-master began, but was\r\nsharply stopped by the Vice-warden.\r\n\r\n“Silence, Sir! Go and turn over the music for his Highness. My dear,”\r\n (to the Wardeness) “will you show him what to do? And meanwhile, Baron,\r\nI'll just show you a most interesting map we have--of Outland, and\r\nFairyland, and that sort of thing.”\r\n\r\nBy the time my Lady had returned, from explaining things to the\r\nmusic-master, the map had been hung up, and the Baron was already much\r\nbewildered by the Vice-Warden's habit of pointing to one place while he\r\nshouted out the name of another.\r\n\r\n{Image...The map of fairyland}\r\n\r\nMy Lady joining in, pointing out other places, and shouting other names,\r\nonly made matters worse; and at last the Baron, in despair, took to\r\npointing out places for himself, and feebly asked “Is that great yellow\r\nsplotch Fairyland?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that's Fairyland,” said the Vice-warden: “and you might as well\r\ngive him a hint,” he muttered to my Lady, “about going back to-morrow.\r\nHe eats like a shark! It would hardly do for me to mention it.”\r\n\r\nHis wife caught the idea, and at once began giving hints of the most\r\nsubtle and delicate kind. “Just see what a short way it is back to\r\nFairyland! Why, if you started to-morrow morning, you'd get there in\r\nvery little more than a week!”\r\n\r\nThe Baron looked incredulous. “It took me a full month to come,” he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n“But it's ever so much shorter, going back, you know!'\r\n\r\nThe Baron looked appealingly to the Vice-warden, who chimed in readily.\r\n“You can go back five times, in the time it took you to come here\r\nonce--if you start to-morrow morning!”\r\n\r\nAll this time the Sonata was pealing through the room. The Baron could\r\nnot help admitting to himself that it was being magnificently played:\r\nbut he tried in vain to get a glimpse of the youthful performer. Every\r\ntime he had nearly succeeded in catching sight of him, either the\r\nVice-Warden or his wife was sure to get in the way, pointing out some\r\nnew place on the map, and deafening him with some new name.\r\n\r\nHe gave in at last, wished a hasty good-night, and left the room, while\r\nhis host and hostess interchanged looks of triumph.\r\n\r\n“Deftly done!” cried the Vice-Warden. “Craftily contrived! But what\r\nmeans all that tramping on the stairs?” He half-opened the door, looked\r\nout, and added in a tone of dismay, “The Baron's boxes are being carried\r\ndown!”\r\n\r\n“And what means all that rumbling of wheels?” cried my Lady. She peeped\r\nthrough the window curtains. “The Baron's carriage has come round!” she\r\ngroaned.\r\n\r\nAt this moment the door opened: a fat, furious face looked in: a\r\nvoice, hoarse with passion, thundered out the words “My room is full of\r\nfrogs--I leave you!”: and the door closed again.\r\n\r\nAnd still the noble Sonata went pealing through the room: but it was\r\nArthur's masterly touch that roused the echoes, and thrilled my very\r\nsoul with the tender music of the immortal 'Sonata Pathetique': and\r\nit was not till the last note had died away that the tired but happy\r\ntraveler could bring himself to utter the words “good-night!” and to\r\nseek his much-needed pillow.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 8. A RIDE ON A LION.\r\n\r\nThe next day glided away, pleasantly enough, partly in settling myself\r\nin my new quarters, and partly in strolling round the neighbourhood,\r\nunder Arthur's guidance, and trying to form a general idea of Elveston\r\nand its inhabitants. When five o'clock arrived, Arthur proposed without\r\nany embarrassment this time--to take me with him up to 'the Hall,' in\r\norder that I might make acquaintance with the Earl of Ainslie, who had\r\ntaken it for the season, and renew acquaintance with his daughter Lady\r\nMuriel.\r\n\r\nMy first impressions of the gentle, dignified, and yet genial old man\r\nwere entirely favourable: and the real satisfaction that showed itself\r\non his daughter's face, as she met me with the words “this is indeed\r\nan unlooked-for pleasure!”, was very soothing for whatever remains of\r\npersonal vanity the failures and disappointments of many long years, and\r\nmuch buffeting with a rough world, had left in me.\r\n\r\nYet I noted, and was glad to note, evidence of a far deeper feeling than\r\nmere friendly regard, in her meeting with Arthur though this was, as I\r\ngathered, an almost daily occurrence--and the conversation between them,\r\nin which the Earl and I were only occasional sharers, had an ease and a\r\nspontaneity rarely met with except between very old friends: and, as\r\nI knew that they had not known each other for a longer period than the\r\nsummer which was now rounding into autumn, I felt certain that 'Love,'\r\nand Love alone, could explain the phenomenon.\r\n\r\n“How convenient it would be,” Lady Muriel laughingly remarked, a propos\r\nof my having insisted on saving her the trouble of carrying a cup of tea\r\nacross the room to the Earl, “if cups of tea had no weight at all! Then\r\nperhaps ladies would sometimes be permitted to carry them for short\r\ndistances!”\r\n\r\n“One can easily imagine a situation,” said Arthur, “where things would\r\nnecessarily have no weight, relatively to each other, though each would\r\nhave its usual weight, looked at by itself.”\r\n\r\n“Some desperate paradox!” said the Earl. “Tell us how it could be. We\r\nshall never guess it.”\r\n\r\n“Well, suppose this house, just as it is, placed a few billion miles\r\nabove a planet, and with nothing else near enough to disturb it: of\r\ncourse it falls to the planet?”\r\n\r\nThe Earl nodded. “Of course though it might take some centuries to do\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“And is five-o'clock-tea to be going on all the while?” said Lady\r\nMuriel.\r\n\r\n“That, and other things,” said Arthur. “The inhabitants would live their\r\nlives, grow up and die, and still the house would be falling, falling,\r\nfalling! But now as to the relative weight of things. Nothing can be\r\nheavy, you know, except by trying to fall, and being prevented from\r\ndoing so. You all grant that?”\r\n\r\nWe all granted that.\r\n\r\n“Well, now, if I take this book, and hold it out at arm's length, of\r\ncourse I feel its weight. It is trying to fall, and I prevent it.\r\nAnd, if I let go, it fails to the floor. But, if we were all falling\r\ntogether, it couldn't be trying to fall any quicker, you know: for, if\r\nI let go, what more could it do than fall? And, as my hand would be\r\nfalling too--at the same rate--it would never leave it, for that would\r\nbe to get ahead of it in the race. And it could never overtake the\r\nfailing floor!”\r\n\r\n“I see it clearly,” said Lady Muriel. “But it makes one dizzy to think\r\nof such things! How can you make us do it?”\r\n\r\n“There is a more curious idea yet,” I ventured to say. “Suppose a cord\r\nfastened to the house, from below, and pulled down by some one on the\r\nplanet. Then of course the house goes faster than its natural rate of\r\nfalling: but the furniture--with our noble selves--would go on failing\r\nat their old pace, and would therefore be left behind.”\r\n\r\n“Practically, we should rise to the ceiling,” said the Earl. “The\r\ninevitable result of which would be concussion of brain.”\r\n\r\n“To avoid that,” said Arthur, “let us have the furniture fixed to\r\nthe floor, and ourselves tied down to the furniture. Then the\r\nfive-o'clock-tea could go on in peace.”\r\n\r\n“With one little drawback!” Lady Muriel gaily interrupted. “We should\r\ntake the cups down with us: but what about the tea?”\r\n\r\n“I had forgotten the tea,” Arthur confessed. “That, no doubt, would rise\r\nto the ceiling unless you chose to drink it on the way!”\r\n\r\n“Which, I think, is quite nonsense enough for one while!” said the Earl.\r\n“What news does this gentleman bring us from the great world of London?”\r\n\r\nThis drew me into the conversation, which now took a more conventional\r\ntone. After a while, Arthur gave the signal for our departure, and in\r\nthe cool of the evening we strolled down to the beach, enjoying the\r\nsilence, broken only by the murmur of the sea and the far-away music of\r\nsome fishermen's song, almost as much as our late pleasant talk.\r\n\r\nWe sat down among the rocks, by a little pool, so rich in animal,\r\nvegetable, and zoophytic--or whatever is the right word--life, that I\r\nbecame entranced in the study of it, and, when Arthur proposed returning\r\nto our lodgings, I begged to be left there for a while, to watch and\r\nmuse alone.\r\n\r\nThe fishermen's song grew ever nearer and clearer, as their boat stood\r\nin for the beach; and I would have gone down to see them land their\r\ncargo of fish, had not the microcosm at my feet stirred my curiosity yet\r\nmore keenly.\r\n\r\nOne ancient crab, that was for ever shuffling frantically from side to\r\nside of the pool, had particularly fascinated me: there was a vacancy in\r\nits stare, and an aimless violence in its behaviour, that irresistibly\r\nrecalled the Gardener who had befriended Sylvie and Bruno: and, as I\r\ngazed, I caught the concluding notes of the tune of his crazy song.\r\n\r\nThe silence that followed was broken by the sweet voice of Sylvie.\r\n“Would you please let us out into the road?”\r\n\r\n“What! After that old beggar again?” the Gardener yelled, and began\r\nsinging:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    “He thought he saw a Kangaroo\r\n    That worked a coffee-mill:\r\n    He looked again, and found it was\r\n    A Vegetable-pill\r\n    'Were I to swallow this,' he said,\r\n    'I should be very ill!'”\r\n\r\n{Image...He thought he saw a kangaroo}\r\n\r\n“We don't want him to swallow anything,” Sylvie explained. “He's not\r\nhungry. But we want to see him. So Will you please--”\r\n\r\n“Certainly!” the Gardener promptly replied. “I always please. Never\r\ndispleases nobody. There you are!” And he flung the door open, and let\r\nus out upon the dusty high-road.\r\n\r\nWe soon found our way to the bush, which had so mysteriously sunk into\r\nthe ground: and here Sylvie drew the Magic Locket from its hiding-place,\r\nturned it over with a thoughtful air, and at last appealed to Bruno in a\r\nrather helpless way. “What was it we had to do with it, Bruno? It's all\r\ngone out of my head!”\r\n\r\n“Kiss it!” was Bruno's invariable recipe in cases of doubt and\r\ndifficulty. Sylvie kissed it, but no result followed.\r\n\r\n“Rub it the wrong way,” was Bruno's next suggestion.\r\n\r\n“Which is the wrong way?”, Sylvie most reasonably enquired. The obvious\r\nplan was to try both ways.\r\n\r\nRubbing from left to right had no visible effect whatever.\r\n\r\nFrom right to left--“Oh, stop, Sylvie!” Bruno cried in sudden alarm.\r\n“Whatever is going to happen?”\r\n\r\nFor a number of trees, on the neighbouring hillside, were moving slowly\r\nupwards, in solemn procession: while a mild little brook, that had been\r\nrippling at our feet a moment before, began to swell, and foam, and\r\nhiss, and bubble, in a truly alarming fashion.\r\n\r\n“Rub it some other way!” cried Bruno. “Try up-and-down! Quick!”\r\n\r\nIt was a happy thought. Up-and-down did it: and the landscape, which had\r\nbeen showing signs of mental aberration in various directions, returned\r\nto its normal condition of sobriety with the exception of a small\r\nyellowish-brown mouse, which continued to run wildly up and down the\r\nroad, lashing its tail like a little lion.\r\n\r\n“Let's follow it,” said Sylvie: and this also turned out a happy\r\nthought. The mouse at once settled down into a business-like jog-trot,\r\nwith which we could easily keep pace. The only phenomenon, that gave\r\nme any uneasiness, was the rapid increase in the size of the little\r\ncreature we were following, which became every moment more and more like\r\na real lion.\r\n\r\nSoon the transformation was complete: and a noble lion stood patiently\r\nwaiting for us to come up with it. No thought of fear seemed to occur\r\nto the children, who patted and stroked it as if it had been a\r\nShetland-pony.\r\n\r\n{Image...The mouse-lion}\r\n\r\n“Help me up!” cried Bruno. And in another moment Sylvie had lifted him\r\nupon the broad back of the gentle beast, and seated herself behind him,\r\npillion-fashion. Bruno took a good handful of mane in each hand, and\r\nmade believe to guide this new kind of steed. “Gee-up!', seemed quite\r\nsufficient by way of verbal direction: the lion at once broke into an\r\neasy canter, and we soon found ourselves in the depths of the forest. I\r\nsay 'we,' for I am certain that I accompanied them though how I managed\r\nto keep up with a cantering lion I am wholly unable to explain. But\r\nI was certainly one of the party when we came upon an old beggar-man\r\ncutting sticks, at whose feet the lion made a profound obeisance, Sylvie\r\nand Bruno at the same moment dismounting, and leaping in to the arms of\r\ntheir father.\r\n\r\n“From bad to worse!” the old man said to himself, dreamily, when the\r\nchildren had finished their rather confused account of the Ambassador's\r\nvisit, gathered no doubt from general report, as they had not seen him\r\nthemselves. “From bad to worse! That is their destiny. I see it, but\r\nI cannot alter it. The selfishness of a mean and crafty man--the\r\nselfishness of an ambitious and silly woman----the selfishness of a\r\nspiteful and loveless child all tend one way, from bad to worse! And\r\nyou, my darlings, must suffer it awhile, I fear. Yet, when things are at\r\ntheir worst, you can come to me. I can do but little as yet--”\r\n\r\nGathering up a handful of dust and scattering it in the air, he slowly\r\nand solemnly pronounced some words that sounded like a charm, the\r\nchildren looking on in awe-struck silence:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Let craft, ambition, spite,\r\n    Be quenched in Reason's night,\r\n    Till weakness turn to might,\r\n    Till what is dark be light,\r\n    Till what is wrong be right!”\r\n\r\nThe cloud of dust spread itself out through the air, as if it were\r\nalive, forming curious shapes that were for ever changing into others.\r\n\r\n“It makes letters! It makes words!” Bruno whispered, as he clung,\r\nhalf-frightened, to Sylvie. “Only I ca'n't make them out! Read them,\r\nSylvie!”\r\n\r\n“I'll try,” Sylvie gravely replied. “Wait a minute--if only I could see\r\nthat word--”\r\n\r\n“I should be very ill!', a discordant voice yelled in our ears.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Were I to swallow this,' he said,\r\n    'I should be very ill!'”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 9. A JESTER AND A BEAR.\r\n\r\nYes, we were in the garden once more: and, to escape that horrid\r\ndiscordant voice, we hurried indoors, and found ourselves in the\r\nlibrary--Uggug blubbering, the Professor standing by with a bewildered\r\nair, and my Lady, with her arms clasped round her son's neck, repeating,\r\nover and over again, “and did they give him nasty lessons to learn? My\r\nown pretty pet!”\r\n\r\n“What's all this noise about?” the Vice-warden angrily enquired, as he\r\nstrode into the room. “And who put the hat-stand here?”\r\n\r\nAnd he hung his hat up on Bruno, who was standing in the middle of the\r\nroom, too much astonished by the sudden change of scene to make any\r\nattempt at removing it, though it came down to his shoulders, making him\r\nlook something like a small candle with a large extinguisher over it.\r\n\r\nThe Professor mildly explained that His Highness had been graciously\r\npleased to say he wouldn't do his lessons.\r\n\r\n“Do your lessons this instant, you young cub!” thundered the\r\nVice-Warden. “And take this!” and a resounding box on the ear made the\r\nunfortunate Professor reel across the room.\r\n\r\n“Save me!” faltered the poor old man, as he sank, half-fainting, at my\r\nLady's feet.\r\n\r\n“Shave you? Of course I will!” my Lady replied, as she lifted him into a\r\nchair, and pinned an anti-macassar round his neck. “Where's the razor?”\r\n\r\nThe Vice-Warden meanwhile had got hold of Uggug, and was belabouring him\r\nwith his umbrella. “Who left this loose nail in the floor?” he shouted,\r\n“Hammer it in, I say! Hammer it in!” Blow after blow fell on the\r\nwrithing Uggug, till he dropped howling to the floor.\r\n\r\n{Image...'Hammer it in!'}\r\n\r\nThen his father turned to the 'shaving' scene which was being enacted,\r\nand roared with laughter. “Excuse me, dear, I ca'n't help it!” he said\r\nas soon as he could speak. “You are such an utter donkey! Kiss me,\r\nTabby!”\r\n\r\nAnd he flung his arms round the neck of the terrified Professor, who\r\nraised a wild shriek, but whether he received the threatened kiss or\r\nnot I was unable to see, as Bruno, who had by this time released himself\r\nfrom his extinguisher, rushed headlong out of the room, followed by\r\nSylvie; and I was so fearful of being left alone among all these crazy\r\ncreatures that I hurried after them.\r\n\r\n“We must go to Father!” Sylvie panted, as they ran down the garden.\r\n“I'm sure things are at their worst! I'll ask the Gardener to let us out\r\nagain.”\r\n\r\n“But we ca'n't walk all the way!” Bruno whimpered. “How I wiss we had a\r\ncoach-and-four, like Uncle!”\r\n\r\nAnd, shrill and wild, rang through the air the familiar voice:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    “He thought he saw a Coach-and-Four\r\n    That stood beside his bed:\r\n    He looked again, and found it was\r\n    A Bear without a Head.\r\n    'Poor thing,' he said, 'poor silly thing!\r\n    It's waiting to be fed!'”\r\n\r\n{Image...A bear without a head}\r\n\r\n“No, I ca'n't let you out again!” he said, before the children could\r\nspeak. “The Vice-warden gave it me, he did, for letting you out last\r\ntime! So be off with you!” And, turning away from them, he began digging\r\nfrantically in the middle of a gravel-walk, singing, over and over\r\nagain, “'Poor thing,' he said, 'poor silly thing! It's waiting to be\r\nfed!'” but in a more musical tone than the shrill screech in which he\r\nhad begun.\r\n\r\nThe music grew fuller and richer at every moment: other manly voices\r\njoined in the refrain: and soon I heard the heavy thud that told me the\r\nboat had touched the beach, and the harsh grating of the shingle as the\r\nmen dragged it up. I roused myself, and, after lending them a hand in\r\nhauling up their boat, I lingered yet awhile to watch them disembark a\r\ngoodly assortment of the hard-won 'treasures of the deep.'\r\n\r\nWhen at last I reached our lodgings I was tired and sleepy, and glad\r\nenough to settle down again into the easy-chair, while Arthur hospitably\r\nwent to his cupboard, to get me out some cake and wine, without which,\r\nhe declared, he could not, as a doctor, permit my going to bed.\r\n\r\nAnd how that cupboard-door did creak! It surely could not be Arthur, who\r\nwas opening and shutting it so often, moving so restlessly about, and\r\nmuttering like the soliloquy of a tragedy-queen!\r\n\r\nNo, it was a female voice. Also the figure half-hidden by the\r\ncupboard-door--was a female figure, massive, and in flowing robes.\r\n\r\nCould it be the landlady? The door opened, and a strange man entered the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n“What is that donkey doing?” he said to himself, pausing, aghast, on the\r\nthreshold.\r\n\r\nThe lady, thus rudely referred to, was his wife. She had got one of the\r\ncupboards open, and stood with her back to him, smoothing down a sheet\r\nof brown paper on one of the shelves, and whispering to herself “So, so!\r\nDeftly done! Craftily contrived!”\r\n\r\nHer loving husband stole behind her on tiptoe, and tapped her on the\r\nhead. “Boh!” he playfully shouted at her ear. “Never tell me again I\r\nca'n't say 'boh' to a goose!”\r\n\r\nMy Lady wrung her hands. “Discovered!” she groaned. “Yet no--he is one\r\nof us! Reveal it not, oh Man! Let it bide its time!”\r\n\r\n“Reveal what not?” her husband testily replied, dragging out the sheet\r\nof brown paper. “What are you hiding here, my Lady? I insist upon\r\nknowing!”\r\n\r\nMy Lady cast down her eyes, and spoke in the littlest of little voices.\r\n“Don't make fun of it, Benjamin!” she pleaded. “It's--it's---don't you\r\nunderstand? It's a DAGGER!”\r\n\r\n“And what's that for?” sneered His Excellency. “We've only got to make\r\npeople think he's dead! We haven't got to kill him! And made of tin,\r\ntoo!” he snarled, contemptuously bending the blade round his thumb.\r\n“Now, Madam, you'll be good enough to explain. First, what do you call\r\nme Benjamin for?”\r\n\r\n“It's part of the Conspiracy, Love! One must have an alias, you know--”\r\n\r\n“Oh, an alias, is it? Well! And next, what did you get this dagger for?\r\nCome, no evasions! You ca'n't deceive me!”\r\n\r\n“I got it for--for--for--” the detected Conspirator stammered, trying\r\nher best to put on the assassin-expression that she had been practising\r\nat the looking-glass. “For--”\r\n\r\n“For what, Madam!”\r\n\r\n“Well, for eighteenpence, if you must know, dearest! That's what I got\r\nit for, on my--”\r\n\r\n“Now don't say your Word and Honour!” groaned the other Conspirator.\r\n“Why, they aren't worth half the money, put together!”\r\n\r\n“On my birthday,” my Lady concluded in a meek whisper. “One must have a\r\ndagger, you know. It's part of the--”\r\n\r\n“Oh, don't talk of Conspiracies!” her husband savagely interrupted, as\r\nhe tossed the dagger into the cupboard. “You know about as much how to\r\nmanage a Conspiracy as if you were a chicken. Why, the first thing is to\r\nget a disguise. Now, just look at this!”\r\n\r\nAnd with pardonable pride he fitted on the cap and bells, and the rest\r\nof the Fool's dress, and winked at her, and put his tongue in his cheek.\r\n“Is that the sort of thing, now.” he demanded.\r\n\r\nMy Lady's eyes flashed with all a Conspirator's enthusiasm. “The very\r\nthing!” she exclaimed, clapping her hands. “You do look, oh, such a\r\nperfect Fool!”\r\n\r\nThe Fool smiled a doubtful smile. He was not quite clear whether it was\r\na compliment or not, to express it so plainly. “You mean a Jester? Yes,\r\nthat's what I intended. And what do you think your disguise is to be?”\r\n And he proceeded to unfold the parcel, the lady watching him in rapture.\r\n\r\n“Oh, how lovely!” she cried, when at last the dress was unfolded. “What\r\na splendid disguise! An Esquimaux peasant-woman!”\r\n\r\n“An Esquimaux peasant, indeed!” growled the other. “Here, put it on,\r\nand look at yourself in the glass. Why, it's a Bear, ca'n't you use your\r\neyes?” He checked himself suddenly, as a harsh voice yelled through the\r\nroom,\r\n\r\n\r\n    “He looked again, and found it was\r\n    A Bear without a Head!”\r\n\r\nBut it was only the Gardener, singing under the open window. The\r\nVice-Warden stole on tip-toe to the window, and closed it noiselessly,\r\nbefore he ventured to go on. “Yes, Lovey, a Bear: but not without a\r\nhead, I hope! You're the Bear, and me the Keeper. And if any one knows\r\nus, they'll have sharp eyes, that's all!”\r\n\r\n“I shall have to practise the steps a bit,” my Lady said, looking out\r\nthrough the Bear's mouth: “one ca'n't help being rather human just at\r\nfirst, you know. And of course you'll say 'Come up, Bruin!', won't you?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, of course,” replied the Keeper, laying hold of the chain, that\r\nhung from the Bear's collar, with one hand, while with the other he\r\ncracked a little whip. “Now go round the room in a sort of a dancing\r\nattitude. Very good, my dear, very good. Come up, Bruin! Come up, I\r\nsay!”\r\n\r\n{Image...'Come up, bruin!'}\r\n\r\nHe roared out the last words for the benefit of Uggug, who had just come\r\ninto the room, and was now standing, with his hands spread out, and eyes\r\nand mouth wide open, the very picture of stupid amazement. “Oh, my!” was\r\nall he could gasp out.\r\n\r\nThe Keeper pretended to be adjusting the bear's collar, which gave him\r\nan opportunity of whispering, unheard by Uggug, “my fault, I'm afraid!\r\nQuite forgot to fasten the door. Plot's ruined if he finds it out! Keep\r\nit up a minute or two longer. Be savage!” Then, while seeming to pull\r\nit back with all his strength, he let it advance upon the scared boy:\r\nmy Lady, with admirable presence of mind, kept up what she no doubt\r\nintended for a savage growl, though it was more like the purring of a\r\ncat: and Uggug backed out of the room with such haste that he tripped\r\nover the mat, and was heard to fall heavily outside--an accident to\r\nwhich even his doting mother paid no heed, in the excitement of the\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nThe Vice-Warden shut and bolted the door. “Off with the disguises!” he\r\npanted. “There's not a moment to lose. He's sure to fetch the Professor,\r\nand we couldn't take him in, you know!” And in another minute the\r\ndisguises were stowed away in the cupboard, the door unbolted, and the\r\ntwo Conspirators seated lovingly side-by-side on the sofa, earnestly\r\ndiscussing a book the Vice-Warden had hastily snatched off the table,\r\nwhich proved to be the City-Directory of the capital of Outland.\r\n\r\nThe door opened, very slowly and cautiously, and the Professor peeped\r\nin, Uggug's stupid face being just visible behind him.\r\n\r\n“It is a beautiful arrangement!” the Vice-warden was saying with\r\nenthusiasm. “You see, my precious one, that there are fifteen houses in\r\nGreen Street, before you turn into West Street.”\r\n\r\n“Fifteen houses! Is it possible?” my Lady replied. “I thought it was\r\nfourteen!” And, so intent were they on this interesting question, that\r\nneither of them even looked up till the Professor, leading Uggug by the\r\nhand, stood close before them.\r\n\r\nMy Lady was the first to notice their approach. “Why, here's the\r\nProfessor!” she exclaimed in her blandest tones. “And my precious child\r\ntoo! Are lessons over?”\r\n\r\n“A strange thing has happened!” the Professor began in a trembling tone.\r\n“His Exalted Fatness” (this was one of Uggug's many titles) “tells me he\r\nhas just seen, in this very room, a Dancing-Bear and a Court-Jester!”\r\n\r\nThe Vice-Warden and his wife shook with well-acted merriment.\r\n\r\n“Not in this room, darling!” said the fond mother. “We've been sitting\r\nhere this hour or more, reading--,” here she referred to the book lying\r\non her lap, “--reading the--the City-Directory.”\r\n\r\n“Let me feel your pulse, my boy!” said the anxious father. “Now put out\r\nyour tongue. Ah, I thought so! He's a little feverish, Professor, and\r\nhas had a bad dream. Put him to bed at once, and give him a cooling\r\ndraught.”\r\n\r\n“I ain't been dreaming!” his Exalted Fatness remonstrated, as the\r\nProfessor led him away.\r\n\r\n“Bad grammar, Sir!” his father remarked with some sternness. “Kindly\r\nattend to that little matter, Professor, as soon as you have corrected\r\nthe feverishness. And, by the way, Professor!” (The Professor left his\r\ndistinguished pupil standing at the door, and meekly returned.) “There\r\nis a rumour afloat, that the people wish to elect an--in point of fact,\r\nan--you understand that I mean an--”\r\n\r\n“Not another Professor!” the poor old man exclaimed in horror.\r\n\r\n“No! Certainly not!” the Vice-Warden eagerly explained. “Merely an\r\nEmperor, you understand.”\r\n\r\n“An Emperor!” cried the astonished Professor, holding his head between\r\nhis hands, as if he expected it to come to pieces with the shock. “What\r\nwill the Warden--”\r\n\r\n“Why, the Warden will most likely be the new Emperor!” my Lady\r\nexplained. “Where could we find a better? Unless, perhaps--” she glanced\r\nat her husband.\r\n\r\n“Where indeed!” the Professor fervently responded, quite failing to take\r\nthe hint.\r\n\r\nThe Vice-Warden resumed the thread of his discourse. “The reason I\r\nmentioned it, Professor, was to ask you to be so kind as to preside at\r\nthe Election. You see it would make the thing respectable--no suspicion\r\nof anything, underhand--”\r\n\r\n“I fear I ca'n't, your Excellency!” the old man faltered. “What will the\r\nWarden--”\r\n\r\n“True, true!” the Vice-Warden interrupted. “Your position, as\r\nCourt-Professor, makes it awkward, I admit. Well, well! Then the\r\nElection shall be held without you.”\r\n\r\n“Better so, than if it were held within me!” the Professor murmured with\r\na bewildered air, as if he hardly knew what he was saying. “Bed, I think\r\nyour Highness said, and a cooling-draught?” And he wandered dreamily\r\nback to where Uggug sulkily awaited him.\r\n\r\nI followed them out of the room, and down the passage, the Professor\r\nmurmuring to himself, all the time, as a kind of aid to his feeble\r\nmemory, “C, C, C; Couch, Cooling-Draught, Correct-Grammar,” till, in\r\nturning a corner, he met Sylvie and Bruno, so suddenly that the startled\r\nProfessor let go of his fat pupil, who instantly took to his heels.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 10. THE OTHER PROFESSOR.\r\n\r\n“We were looking for you!” cried Sylvie, in a tone of great relief. “We\r\ndo want you so much, you ca'n't think!”\r\n\r\n“What is it, dear children?” the Professor asked, beaming on them with a\r\nvery different look from what Uggug ever got from him.\r\n\r\n“We want you to speak to the Gardener for us,” Sylvie said, as she and\r\nBruno took the old man's hands and led him into the hall.\r\n\r\n“He's ever so unkind!” Bruno mournfully added. “They's all unkind to us,\r\nnow that Father's gone. The Lion were much nicer!”\r\n\r\n“But you must explain to me, please,” the Professor said with an anxious\r\nlook, “which is the Lion, and which is the Gardener. It's most important\r\nnot to get two such animals confused together. And one's very liable to\r\ndo it in their case--both having mouths, you know--”\r\n\r\n“Doos oo always confuses two animals together?” Bruno asked.\r\n\r\n“Pretty often, I'm afraid,” the Professor candidly confessed. “Now, for\r\ninstance, there's the rabbit-hutch and the hall-clock.” The Professor\r\npointed them out. “One gets a little confused with them--both having\r\ndoors, you know. Now, only yesterday--would you believe it?--I put some\r\nlettuces into the clock, and tried to wind up the rabbit!”\r\n\r\n“Did the rabbit go, after oo wounded it up?” said Bruno.\r\n\r\nThe Professor clasped his hands on the top of his head, and groaned.\r\n“Go? I should think it did go! Why, it's gone? And where ever it's gone\r\nto--that's what I ca'n't find out! I've done my best--I've read all the\r\narticle 'Rabbit' in the great dictionary--Come in!”\r\n\r\n“Only the tailor, Sir, with your little bill,” said a meek voice outside\r\nthe door.\r\n\r\n“Ah, well, I can soon settle his business,” the Professor said to the\r\nchildren, “if you'll just wait a minute. How much is it, this year, my\r\nman?” The tailor had come in while he was speaking.\r\n\r\n“Well, it's been a doubling so many years, you see,” the tailor replied,\r\na little gruffly, “and I think I'd like the money now. It's two thousand\r\npound, it is!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, that's nothing!” the Professor carelessly remarked, feeling in his\r\npocket, as if he always carried at least that amount about with him.\r\n“But wouldn't you like to wait just another year, and make it four\r\nthousand? Just think how rich you'd be! Why, you might be a King, if you\r\nliked!”\r\n\r\n“I don't know as I'd care about being a King,” the man said\r\nthoughtfully. “But it dew sound a powerful sight o' money! Well, I\r\nthink I'll wait--”\r\n\r\n“Of course you will!” said the Professor. “There's good sense in you, I\r\nsee. Good-day to you, my man!”\r\n\r\n“Will you ever have to pay him that four thousand pounds?” Sylvie asked\r\nas the door closed on the departing creditor.\r\n\r\n“Never, my child!” the Professor replied emphatically. “He'll go on\r\ndoubling it, till he dies. You see it's always worth while waiting\r\nanother year, to get twice as much money! And now what would you like to\r\ndo, my little friends? Shall I take you to see the Other Professor?\r\nThis would be an excellent opportunity for a visit,” he said to himself,\r\nglancing at his watch: “he generally takes a short rest--of fourteen\r\nminutes and a half--about this time.”\r\n\r\nBruno hastily went round to Sylvie, who was standing at the other side\r\nof the Professor, and put his hand into hers. “I thinks we'd like to\r\ngo,” he said doubtfully: “only please let's go all together. It's best\r\nto be on the safe side, oo know!”\r\n\r\n“Why, you talk as if you were Sylvie!” exclaimed the Professor.\r\n\r\n“I know I did,” Bruno replied very humbly. “I quite forgotted I wasn't\r\nSylvie. Only I fought he might be rarver fierce!”\r\n\r\nThe Professor laughed a jolly laugh. “Oh, he's quite tame!” he said.\r\n“He never bites. He's only a little--a little dreamy, you know.” He took\r\nhold of Bruno's other hand; and led the children down a long passage\r\nI had never noticed before--not that there was anything remarkable\r\nin that: I was constantly coming on new rooms and passages in that\r\nmysterious Palace, and very seldom succeeded in finding the old ones\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nNear the end of the passage the Professor stopped. “This is his room,”\r\n he said, pointing to the solid wall.\r\n\r\n“We ca'n't get in through there!” Bruno exclaimed.\r\n\r\nSylvie said nothing, till she had carefully examined whether the wall\r\nopened anywhere. Then she laughed merrily. “You're playing us a trick,\r\nyou dear old thing!” she said. “There's no door here!”\r\n\r\n“There isn't any door to the room,” said the Professor. “We shall have\r\nto climb in at the window.”\r\n\r\nSo we went into the garden, and soon found the window of the Other\r\nProfessor's room. It was a ground-floor window, and stood invitingly\r\nopen: the Professor first lifted the two children in, and then he and I\r\nclimbed in after them.\r\n\r\n{Image...The other professor}\r\n\r\nThe Other Professor was seated at a table, with a large book open before\r\nhim, on which his forehead was resting: he had clasped his arms round\r\nthe book, and was snoring heavily. “He usually reads like that,”\r\n the Professor remarked, “when the book's very interesting: and then\r\nsometimes it's very difficult to get him to attend!”\r\n\r\nThis seemed to be one of the difficult times: the Professor lifted him\r\nup, once or twice, and shook him violently: but he always returned to\r\nhis book the moment he was let go of, and showed by his heavy breathing\r\nthat the book was as interesting as ever.\r\n\r\n“How dreamy he is!” the Professor exclaimed. “He must have got to a very\r\ninteresting part of the book!” And he rained quite a shower of thumps on\r\nthe Other Professor's back, shouting “Hoy! Hoy!” all the time. “Isn't it\r\nwonderful that he should be so dreamy?” he said to Bruno.\r\n\r\n“If he's always as sleepy as that,” Bruno remarked, “a course he's\r\ndreamy!”\r\n\r\n“But what are we to do?” said the Professor. “You see he's quite wrapped\r\nup in the book!”\r\n\r\n“Suppose oo shuts the book?” Bruno suggested.\r\n\r\n“That's it!” cried the delighted Professor. “Of course that'll do it!”\r\n And he shut up the book so quickly that he caught the Other Professor's\r\nnose between the leaves, and gave it a severe pinch.\r\n\r\nThe Other Professor instantly rose to his feet, and carried the book\r\naway to the end of the room, where he put it back in its place in the\r\nbook-case. “I've been reading for eighteen hours and three-quarters,”\r\n he said, “and now I shall rest for fourteen minutes and a half. Is the\r\nLecture all ready?”\r\n\r\n“Very nearly,” the Professor humbly replied. “I shall ask you to give me\r\na hint or two--there will be a few little difficulties--”\r\n\r\n“And Banquet, I think you said?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes! The Banquet comes first, of course. People never enjoy\r\nAbstract Science, you know, when they're ravenous with hunger. And then\r\nthere's the Fancy-Dress-Ball. Oh, there'll be lots of entertainment!”\r\n\r\n“Where will the Ball come in?” said the Other Professor.\r\n\r\n“I think it had better come at the beginning of the Banquet--it brings\r\npeople together so nicely, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that's the right order. First the Meeting: then the Eating: then\r\nthe Treating--for I'm sure any Lecture you give us will be a treat!”\r\n said the Other Professor, who had been standing with his back to us all\r\nthis time, occupying himself in taking the books out, one by one, and\r\nturning them upside-down. An easel, with a black board on it, stood near\r\nhim: and, every time that he turned a book upside-down, he made a mark\r\non the board with a piece of chalk.\r\n\r\n“And as to the 'Pig-Tale'--which you have so kindly promised to give\r\nus--” the Professor went on, thoughtfully rubbing his chin. “I think\r\nthat had better come at the end of the Banquet: then people can listen\r\nto it quietly.”\r\n\r\n“Shall I sing it?” the Other Professor asked, with a smile of delight.\r\n\r\n“If you can,” the Professor replied, cautiously.\r\n\r\n“Let me try,” said the Other Professor, seating himself at the\r\npianoforte. “For the sake of argument, let us assume that it begins on\r\nA flat.” And he struck the note in question. “La, la, la! I think that's\r\nwithin an octave of it.” He struck the note again, and appealed to\r\nBruno, who was standing at his side. “Did I sing it like that, my\r\nchild?”\r\n\r\n“No, oo didn't,” Bruno replied with great decision. “It were more like a\r\nduck.”\r\n\r\n“Single notes are apt to have that effect,” the Other Professor said\r\nwith a sigh. “Let me try a whole verse,\r\n\r\n\r\n   There was a Pig, that sat alone,\r\n   Beside a ruined Pump.\r\n   By day and night he made his moan:\r\n   It would have stirred a heart of stone\r\n   To see him wring his hoofs and groan,\r\n   Because he could not jump.\r\n\r\nWould you call that a tune, Professor?” he asked, when he had finished.\r\n\r\nThe Professor considered a little. “Well,” he said at last, “some of the\r\nnotes are the same as others and some are different but I should hardly\r\ncall it a tune.”\r\n\r\n“Let me try it a bit by myself,” said the Other Professor. And he began\r\ntouching the notes here and there, and humming to himself like an angry\r\nbluebottle.\r\n\r\n“How do you like his singing?” the Professor asked the children in a low\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n“It isn't very beautiful,” Sylvie said, hesitatingly.\r\n\r\n“It's very extremely ugly!” Bruno said, without any hesitation at all.\r\n\r\n“All extremes are bad,” the Professor said, very gravely. “For instance,\r\nSobriety is a very good thing, when practised in moderation: but even\r\nSobriety, when carried to an extreme, has its disadvantages.”\r\n\r\n“What are its disadvantages?” was the question that rose in my\r\nmind--and, as usual, Bruno asked it for me. “What are its lizard\r\nbandages?'\r\n\r\n“Well, this is one of them,” said the Professor. “When a man's tipsy\r\n(that's one extreme, you know), he sees one thing as two. But, when he's\r\nextremely sober (that's the other extreme), he sees two things as one.\r\nIt's equally inconvenient, whichever happens.\r\n\r\n“What does 'illconvenient' mean?” Bruno whispered to Sylvie.\r\n\r\n“The difference between 'convenient' and 'inconvenient' is best\r\nexplained by an example,” said the Other Professor, who had overheard\r\nthe question. “If you'll just think over any Poem that contains the two\r\nwords--such as--”\r\n\r\nThe Professor put his hands over his ears, with a look of dismay. “If\r\nyou once let him begin a Poem,” he said to Sylvie, “he'll never leave\r\noff again! He never does!”\r\n\r\n“Did he ever begin a Poem and not leave off again?” Sylvie enquired.\r\n\r\n“Three times,” said the Professor.\r\n\r\nBruno raised himself on tiptoe, till his lips were on a level with\r\nSylvie's ear. “What became of them three Poems?” he whispered. “Is he\r\nsaying them all, now?”\r\n\r\n“Hush!” said Sylvie. “The Other Professor is speaking!”\r\n\r\n“I'll say it very quick,” murmured the Other Professor, with downcast\r\neyes, and melancholy voice, which contrasted oddly with his face, as\r\nhe had forgotten to leave off smiling. (“At least it wasn't exactly a\r\nsmile,”) as Sylvie said afterwards: “it looked as if his mouth was made\r\nthat shape.”\r\n\r\n“Go on then,” said the Professor. “What must be must be.”\r\n\r\n“Remember that!” Sylvie whispered to Bruno, “It's a very good rule for\r\nwhenever you hurt yourself.”\r\n\r\n“And it's a very good rule for whenever I make a noise,” said the saucy\r\nlittle fellow. “So you remember it too, Miss!”\r\n\r\n“Whatever do you mean?” said Sylvie, trying to frown, a thing she never\r\nmanaged particularly well.\r\n\r\n“Oftens and oftens,” said Bruno, “haven't oo told me 'There mustn't\r\nbe so much noise, Bruno!' when I've tolded oo 'There must!' Why, there\r\nisn't no rules at all about 'There mustn't'! But oo never believes me!”\r\n\r\n“As if any one could believe you, you wicked wicked boy!” said Sylvie.\r\nThe words were severe enough, but I am of opinion that, when you are\r\nreally anxious to impress a criminal with a sense of his guilt, you\r\nought not to pronounce the sentence with your lips quite close to his\r\ncheek--since a kiss at the end of it, however accidental, weakens the\r\neffect terribly.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 11. PETER AND PAUL.\r\n\r\n“As I was saying,” the other Professor resumed, “if you'll just think\r\nover any Poem, that contains the words--such as,\r\n\r\n\r\n   'Peter is poor,' said noble Paul,\r\n   'And I have always been his friend:\r\n    And, though my means to give are small,\r\n    At least I can afford to lend.\r\n    How few, in this cold age of greed,\r\n    Do good, except on selfish grounds!\r\n    But I can feel for Peter's need,\r\n    And I WILL LEND HIM FIFTY POUNDS!'\r\n\r\n    How great was Peter's joy to find\r\n    His friend in such a genial vein!\r\n    How cheerfully the bond he signed,\r\n    To pay the money back again!\r\n    'We ca'n't,' said Paul, 'be too precise:\r\n    'Tis best to fix the very day:\r\n    So, by a learned friend's advice,\r\n    I've made it Noon, the Fourth of May.\r\n\r\n{Image...'How cheefully the bond he signed!'}\r\n\r\n\r\n    But this is April!  Peter said.\r\n    'The First of April, as I think.\r\n    Five little weeks will soon be fled:\r\n    One scarcely will have time to wink!\r\n    Give me a year to speculate--\r\n    To buy and sell--to drive a trade--'\r\n    Said Paul 'I cannot change the date.\r\n    On May the Fourth it must be paid.'\r\n\r\n    'Well, well!' said Peter, with a sigh.\r\n    'Hand me the cash, and I will go.\r\n    I'll form a Joint-Stock Company,\r\n    And turn an honest pound or so.'\r\n    'I'm grieved,' said Paul, 'to seem unkind:\r\n    The money shalt of course be lent:\r\n    But, for a week or two, I find\r\n    It will not be convenient.'\r\n\r\n    So, week by week, poor Peter came\r\n    And turned in heaviness away;\r\n    For still the answer was the same,\r\n    'I cannot manage it to-day.'\r\n    And now the April showers were dry--\r\n    The five short weeks were nearly spent--\r\n    Yet still he got the old reply,\r\n    'It is not quite convenient!'\r\n\r\n    The Fourth arrived, and punctual Paul\r\n    Came, with his legal friend, at noon.\r\n    'I thought it best,' said he, 'to call:\r\n    One cannot settle things too soon.'\r\n    Poor Peter shuddered in despair:\r\n    His flowing locks he wildly tore:\r\n    And very soon his yellow hair\r\n    Was lying all about the floor.\r\n\r\n    The legal friend was standing by,\r\n    With sudden pity half unmanned:\r\n    The tear-drop trembled in his eye,\r\n    The signed agreement in his hand:\r\n    But when at length the legal soul\r\n    Resumed its customary force,\r\n    'The Law,' he said, 'we ca'n't control:\r\n    Pay, or the Law must take its course!'\r\n\r\n    Said Paul 'How bitterly I rue\r\n    That fatal morning when I called!\r\n    Consider, Peter, what you do!\r\n    You won't be richer when you're bald!\r\n    Think you, by rending curls away,\r\n    To make your difficulties less?\r\n    Forbear this violence, I pray:\r\n    You do but add to my distress!'\r\n\r\n{Image...'Poor peter shuddered in despair'}\r\n\r\n\r\n    'Not willingly would I inflict,'\r\n    Said Peter, 'on that noble heart\r\n    One needless pang.  Yet why so strict?\r\n    Is this to act a friendly part?\r\n    However legal it may be\r\n    To pay what never has been lent,\r\n    This style of business seems to me\r\n    Extremely inconvenient!\r\n\r\n    'No Nobleness of soul have I,\r\n    Like some that in this Age are found!'\r\n    (Paul blushed in sheer humility,\r\n    And cast his eyes upon the ground)\r\n    'This debt will simply swallow all,\r\n    And make my life a life of woe!'\r\n    'Nay, nay, nay Peter!' answered Paul.\r\n    'You must not rail on Fortune so!\r\n\r\n    'You have enough to eat and drink:\r\n    You are respected in the world:\r\n    And at the barber's, as I think,\r\n    You often get your whiskers curled.\r\n    Though Nobleness you ca'n't attain\r\n    To any very great extent--\r\n    The path of Honesty is plain,\r\n    However inconvenient!'\r\n\r\n    “Tis true, 'said Peter,' I'm alive:\r\n    I keep my station in the world:\r\n    Once in the week I just contrive\r\n    To get my whiskers oiled and curled.\r\n    But my assets are very low:\r\n    My little income's overspent:\r\n    To trench on capital, you know,\r\n    Is always inconvenient!'\r\n\r\n    'But pay your debts!' cried honest Paul.\r\n    'My gentle Peter, pay your debts!\r\n    What matter if it swallows all\r\n    That you describe as your “assets”?\r\n    Already you're an hour behind:\r\n    Yet Generosity is best.\r\n    It pinches me--but never mind!\r\n    I WILL NOT CHARGE YOU INTEREST!'\r\n\r\n    'How good!  How great!' poor Peter cried.\r\n    'Yet I must sell my Sunday wig--\r\n    The scarf-pin that has been my pride--\r\n    My grand piano--and my pig!'\r\n    Full soon his property took wings:\r\n    And daily, as each treasure went,\r\n    He sighed to find the state of things\r\n    Grow less and less convenient.\r\n\r\n    Weeks grew to months, and months to years:\r\n    Peter was worn to skin and bone:\r\n    And once he even said, with tears,\r\n    'Remember, Paul, that promised Loan!'\r\n    Said Paul' I'll lend you, when I can,\r\n    All the spare money I have got--\r\n    Ah, Peter, you're a happy man!\r\n    Yours is an enviable lot!\r\n\r\n{Image...Such boots as these you seldom see}\r\n\r\n\r\n    'I'm getting stout, as you may see:\r\n    It is but seldom I am well:\r\n    I cannot feel my ancient glee\r\n    In listening to the dinner-bell:\r\n    But you, you gambol like a boy,\r\n    Your figure is so spare and light:\r\n    The dinner-bell's a note of joy\r\n    To such a healthy appetite!'\r\n\r\n    Said Peter 'I am well aware\r\n    Mine is a state of happiness:\r\n    And yet how gladly could I spare\r\n    Some of the comforts I possess!\r\n    What you call healthy appetite\r\n    I feel as Hunger's savage tooth:\r\n    And, when no dinner is in sight,\r\n    The dinner-bell's a sound of ruth!\r\n\r\n    'No scare-crow would accept this coat:\r\n    Such boots as these you seldom see.\r\n    Ah, Paul, a single five-pound-note\r\n    Would make another man of me!'\r\n    Said Paul 'It fills me with surprise\r\n    To hear you talk in such a tone:\r\n    I fear you scarcely realise\r\n    The blessings that are all your own!\r\n\r\n    'You're safe from being overfed:\r\n    You're sweetly picturesque in rags:\r\n    You never know the aching head\r\n    That comes along with money-bags:\r\n    And you have time to cultivate\r\n    That best of qualities, Content--\r\n    For which you'll find your present state\r\n    Remarkably convenient!'\r\n\r\n    Said Peter 'Though I cannot sound\r\n    The depths of such a man as you,\r\n    Yet in your character I've found\r\n    An inconsistency or two.\r\n    You seem to have long years to spare\r\n    When there's a promise to fulfil:\r\n    And yet how punctual you were\r\n    In calling with that little bill!'\r\n\r\n    'One can't be too deliberate,'\r\n    Said Paul, 'in parting with one's pelf.\r\n    With bills, as you correctly state,\r\n    I'm punctuality itself:\r\n    A man may surely claim his dues:\r\n    But, when there's money to be lent,\r\n    A man must be allowed to choose\r\n    Such times as are convenient!'\r\n\r\n    It chanced one day, as Peter sat\r\n    Gnawing a crust--his usual meal--\r\n    Paul bustled in to have a chat,\r\n    And grasped his hand with friendly zeal.\r\n    'I knew,' said he, 'your frugal ways:\r\n    So, that I might not wound your pride\r\n    By bringing strangers in to gaze,\r\n    I've left my legal friend outside!\r\n\r\n    'You well remember, I am sure,\r\n    When first your wealth began to go,\r\n    And people sneered at one so poor,\r\n    I never used my Peter so!\r\n    And when you'd lost your little all,\r\n    And found yourself a thing despised,\r\n    I need not ask you to recall\r\n    How tenderly I sympathised!\r\n\r\n    'Then the advice I've poured on you,\r\n    So full of wisdom and of wit:\r\n    All given gratis, though 'tis true\r\n    I might have fairly charged for it!\r\n    But I refrain from mentioning\r\n    Full many a deed I might relate\r\n    For boasting is a kind of thing\r\n    That I particularly hate.\r\n\r\n{Image...'I will lend you fifty more!'}\r\n\r\n\r\n    'How vast the total sum appears\r\n    Of all the kindnesses I've done,\r\n    From Childhood's half-forgotten years\r\n    Down to that Loan of April One!\r\n    That Fifty Pounds!  You little guessed\r\n    How deep it drained my slender store:\r\n    But there's a heart within this breast,\r\n    And I WILL LEND YOU FIFTY MORE!'\r\n\r\n    'Not so,' was Peter's mild reply,\r\n    His cheeks all wet with grateful tears;\r\n    No man recalls, so well as I,\r\n    Your services in bygone years:\r\n    And this new offer, I admit,\r\n    Is very very kindly meant--\r\n    Still, to avail myself of it\r\n    Would not be quite convenient!'\r\n\r\nYou'll see in a moment what the difference is between 'convenient'\r\nand 'inconvenient.' You quite understand it now, don't you?” he added,\r\nlooking kindly at Bruno, who was sitting, at Sylvie's side, on the\r\nfloor.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Bruno, very quietly. Such a short speech was very unusual,\r\nfor him: but just then he seemed, I fancied, a little exhausted. In\r\nfact, he climbed up into Sylvie's lap as he spoke, and rested his head\r\nagainst her shoulder. “What a many verses it was!” he whispered.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 12. A MUSICAL GARDENER.\r\n\r\nThe Other Professor regarded him with some anxiety. “The smaller animal\r\nought to go to bed at once,” he said with an air of authority.\r\n\r\n“Why at once?” said the Professor.\r\n\r\n“Because he can't go at twice,” said the Other Professor.\r\n\r\nThe Professor gently clapped his hands. “Isn't he wonderful!” he said to\r\nSylvie. “Nobody else could have thought of the reason, so quick. Why, of\r\ncourse he ca'n't go at twice! It would hurt him to be divided.”\r\n\r\nThis remark woke up Bruno, suddenly and completely. “I don't want to be\r\ndivided,” he said decisively.\r\n\r\n“It does very well on a diagram,” said the Other Professor. “I could\r\nshow it you in a minute, only the chalk's a little blunt.”\r\n\r\n“Take care!” Sylvie anxiously exclaimed, as he began, rather clumsily,\r\nto point it. “You'll cut your finger off, if you hold the knife so!”\r\n\r\n“If oo cuts it off, will oo give it to me, please? Bruno thoughtfully\r\nadded.\r\n\r\n“It's like this,” said the Other Professor, hastily drawing a long line\r\nupon the black board, and marking the letters 'A,' 'B,' at the two\r\nends, and 'C' in the middle: “let me explain it to you. If AB were to be\r\ndivided into two parts at C--”\r\n\r\n“It would be drownded,” Bruno pronounced confidently.\r\n\r\nThe Other Professor gasped. “What would be drownded?”\r\n\r\n“Why the bumble-bee, of course!” said Bruno. “And the two bits would\r\nsink down in the sea!”\r\n\r\nHere the Professor interfered, as the Other Professor was evidently too\r\nmuch puzzled to go on with his diagram.\r\n\r\n“When I said it would hurt him, I was merely referring to the action of\r\nthe nerves--”\r\n\r\nThe Other Professor brightened up in a moment. “The action of the\r\nnerves,” he began eagerly, “is curiously slow in some people. I had a\r\nfriend, once, that, if you burnt him with a red-hot poker, it would take\r\nyears and years before he felt it!”\r\n\r\n“And if you only pinched him?” queried Sylvie.\r\n\r\n“Then it would take ever so much longer, of course. In fact, I doubt if\r\nthe man himself would ever feel it, at all. His grandchildren might.”\r\n\r\n“I wouldn't like to be the grandchild of a pinched grandfather, would\r\nyou, Mister Sir?” Bruno whispered. “It might come just when you wanted\r\nto be happy!”\r\n\r\nThat would be awkward, I admitted, taking it quite as a matter of course\r\nthat he had so suddenly caught sight of me. “But don't you always want\r\nto be happy, Bruno?”\r\n\r\n“Not always,” Bruno said thoughtfully. “Sometimes, when I's too happy,\r\nI wants to be a little miserable. Then I just tell Sylvie about it, oo\r\nknow, and Sylvie sets me some lessons. Then it's all right.”\r\n\r\n“I'm sorry you don't like lessons,” I said.\r\n\r\n“You should copy Sylvie. She's always as busy as the day is long!”\r\n\r\n“Well, so am I!” said Bruno.\r\n\r\n“No, no!” Sylvie corrected him. “You're as busy as the day is short!”\r\n\r\n“Well, what's the difference?” Bruno asked. “Mister Sir, isn't the day\r\nas short as it's long? I mean, isn't it the same length?”\r\n\r\nNever having considered the question in this light, I suggested that\r\nthey had better ask the Professor; and they ran off in a moment to\r\nappeal to their old friend. The Professor left off polishing his\r\nspectacles to consider. “My dears,” he said after a minute, “the day\r\nis the same length as anything that is the same length as it.” And he\r\nresumed his never-ending task of polishing.\r\n\r\nThe children returned, slowly and thoughtfully, to report his answer.\r\n“Isn't he wise?”\r\n\r\nSylvie asked in an awestruck whisper. “If I was as wise as that, I\r\nshould have a head-ache all day long. I know I should!”\r\n\r\n“You appear to be talking to somebody--that isn't here,” the Professor\r\nsaid, turning round to the children. “Who is it?”\r\n\r\nBruno looked puzzled. “I never talks to nobody when he isn't here!” he\r\nreplied. “It isn't good manners. Oo should always wait till he comes,\r\nbefore oo talks to him!”\r\n\r\nThe Professor looked anxiously in my direction, and seemed to look\r\nthrough and through me without seeing me. “Then who are you talking to?”\r\n he said. “There isn't anybody here, you know, except the Other Professor\r\nand he isn't here!” he added wildly, turning round and round like a\r\nteetotum. “Children! Help to look for him! Quick! He's got lost again!”\r\n\r\nThe children were on their feet in a moment.\r\n\r\n“Where shall we look?” said Sylvie.\r\n\r\n“Anywhere!” shouted the excited Professor. “Only be quick about it!” And\r\nhe began trotting round and round the room, lifting up the chairs, and\r\nshaking them.\r\n\r\nBruno took a very small book out of the bookcase, opened it, and shook\r\nit in imitation of the Professor. “He isn't here,” he said.\r\n\r\n“He ca'n't be there, Bruno!” Sylvie said indignantly.\r\n\r\n“Course he ca'n't!” said Bruno. “I should have shooked him out, if he'd\r\nbeen in there!”\r\n\r\n“Has he ever been lost before?” Sylvie enquired, turning up a corner of\r\nthe hearth-rug, and peeping under it.\r\n\r\n“Once before,” said the Professor: “he once lost himself in a wood--”\r\n\r\n“And couldn't he find his-self again?” said Bruno. “Why didn't he shout?\r\nHe'd be sure to hear his-self, 'cause he couldn't be far off, oo know.”\r\n\r\n“Lets try shouting,” said the Professor.\r\n\r\n“What shall we shout?” said Sylvie.\r\n\r\n“On second thoughts, don't shout,” the Professor replied. “The\r\nVice-Warden might hear you. He's getting awfully strict!”\r\n\r\nThis reminded the poor children of all the troubles, about which they\r\nhad come to their old friend. Bruno sat down on the floor and began\r\ncrying. “He is so cruel!” he sobbed. “And he lets Uggug take away all my\r\ntoys! And such horrid meals!”\r\n\r\n“What did you have for dinner to-day?” said the Professor.\r\n\r\n“A little piece of a dead crow,” was Bruno's mournful reply.\r\n\r\n“He means rook-pie,” Sylvie explained.\r\n\r\n“It were a dead crow,” Bruno persisted. “And there were a\r\napple-pudding--and Uggug ate it all--and I got nuffin but a crust! And\r\nI asked for a orange--and--didn't get it!” And the poor little fellow\r\nburied his face in Sylvie's lap, who kept gently stroking his hair as\r\nshe went on. “It's all true, Professor dear! They do treat my darling\r\nBruno very badly! And they're not kind to me either,” she added in a\r\nlower tone, as if that were a thing of much less importance.\r\n\r\nThe Professor got out a large red silk handkerchief, and wiped his eyes.\r\n“I wish I could help you, dear children!” he said. “But what can I do?”\r\n\r\n“We know the way to Fairyland--where Father's gone--quite well,” said\r\nSylvie: “if only the Gardener would let us out.”\r\n\r\n“Won't he open the door for you?” said the Professor.\r\n\r\n“Not for us,” said Sylvie: “but I'm sure he would for you. Do come and\r\nask him, Professor dear!”\r\n\r\n“I'll come this minute!” said the Professor.\r\n\r\nBruno sat up and dried his eyes. “Isn't he kind, Mister Sir?”\r\n\r\n“He is indeed,” said I. But the Professor took no notice of my remark.\r\nHe had put on a beautiful cap with a long tassel, and was selecting one\r\nof the Other Professor's walking-sticks, from a stand in the corner of\r\nthe room. “A thick stick in one's hand makes people respectful,” he was\r\nsaying to himself. “Come along, dear children!” And we all went out into\r\nthe garden together.\r\n\r\n“I shall address him, first of all,” the Professor explained as we went\r\nalong, “with a few playful remarks on the weather. I shall then question\r\nhim about the Other Professor. This will have a double advantage. First,\r\nit will open the conversation (you can't even drink a bottle of\r\nwine without opening it first): and secondly, if he's seen the Other\r\nProfessor, we shall find him that way: and, if he hasn't, we sha'n't.”\r\n\r\nOn our way, we passed the target, at which Uggug had been made to shoot\r\nduring the Ambassador's visit.\r\n\r\n“See!” said the Professor, pointing out a hole in the middle of the\r\nbull's-eye. “His Imperial Fatness had only one shot at it; and he went\r\nin just here!”\r\n\r\nBruno carefully examined the hole. “Couldn't go in there,” he whispered\r\nto me. “He are too fat!”\r\n\r\nWe had no sort of difficulty in finding the Gardener. Though he was\r\nhidden from us by some trees, that harsh voice of his served to direct\r\nus; and, as we drew nearer, the words of his song became more and more\r\nplainly audible:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    “He thought he saw an Albatross\r\n    That fluttered round the lamp:\r\n    He looked again, and found it was\r\n    A Penny-Postage-Stamp.\r\n    'You'd best be getting home,' he said:\r\n    'The nights are very damp!'”\r\n\r\n{Image...He thought he saw an albatross}\r\n\r\n“Would it be afraid of catching cold?” said Bruno.\r\n\r\n“If it got very damp,” Sylvie suggested, “it might stick to something,\r\nyou know.”\r\n\r\n“And that somefin would have to go by the post, what ever it was!” Bruno\r\neagerly exclaimed. “Suppose it was a cow! Wouldn't it be dreadful for\r\nthe other things!”\r\n\r\n“And all these things happened to him,” said the Professor. “That's what\r\nmakes the song so interesting.”\r\n\r\n“He must have had a very curious life,” said Sylvie.\r\n\r\n“You may say that!” the Professor heartily rejoined.\r\n\r\n“Of course she may!” cried Bruno.\r\n\r\nBy this time we had come up to the Gardener, who was standing on one\r\nleg, as usual, and busily employed in watering a bed of flowers with an\r\nempty watering-can.\r\n\r\n“It hasn't got no water in it!” Bruno explained to him, pulling his\r\nsleeve to attract his attention.\r\n\r\n“It's lighter to hold,” said the Gardener. “A lot of water in it makes\r\none's arms ache.” And he went on with his work, singing softly to\r\nhimself,\r\n\r\n\r\n     “The nights are very damp!”\r\n\r\n“In digging things out of the ground which you probably do now and\r\nthen,” the Professor began in a loud voice; “in making things into\r\nheaps--which no doubt you often do; and in kicking things about with one\r\nheel--which you seem never to leave off doing; have you ever happened to\r\nnotice another Professor something like me, but different?”\r\n\r\n“Never!” shouted the Gardener, so loudly and violently that we all drew\r\nback in alarm. “There ain't such a thing!”\r\n\r\n“We will try a less exciting topic,” the Professor mildly remarked to\r\nthe children. “You were asking--”\r\n\r\n“We asked him to let us through the garden-door,” said Sylvie: “but he\r\nwouldn't: but perhaps he would for you!”\r\n\r\nThe Professor put the request, very humbly and courteously.\r\n\r\n“I wouldn't mind letting you out,” said the Gardener. “But I mustn't\r\nopen the door for children. D'you think I'd disobey the Rules? Not for\r\none-and-sixpence!”\r\n\r\nThe Professor cautiously produced a couple of shillings.\r\n\r\n“That'll do it!” the Gardener shouted, as he hurled the watering-can\r\nacross the flower-bed, and produced a handful of keys--one large one,\r\nand a number of small ones.\r\n\r\n“But look here, Professor dear!” whispered Sylvie. “He needn't open the\r\ndoor for us, at all. We can go out with you.”\r\n\r\n“True, dear child!” the Professor thankfully replied, as he replaced\r\nthe coins in his pocket. “That saves two shillings!” And he took the\r\nchildren's hands, that they might all go out together when the door\r\nwas opened. This, however, did not seem a very likely event, though the\r\nGardener patiently tried all the small keys, over and over again.\r\n\r\nAt last the Professor ventured on a gentle suggestion. “Why not try the\r\nlarge one? I have often observed that a door unlocks much more nicely\r\nwith its own key.”\r\n\r\nThe very first trial of the large key proved a success: the Gardener\r\nopened the door, and held out his hand for the money.\r\n\r\nThe Professor shook his head. “You are acting by Rule,” he explained,\r\n“in opening the door for me. And now it's open, we are going out by\r\nRule--the Rule of Three.”\r\n\r\nThe Gardener looked puzzled, and let us go out; but, as he locked the\r\ndoor behind us, we heard him singing thoughtfully to himself,\r\n\r\n\r\n    “He thought he saw a Garden-Door\r\n    That opened with a key:\r\n    He looked again, and found it was\r\n    A Double Rule of Three:\r\n    'And all its mystery,' he said,\r\n    'Is clear as day to me!'”\r\n\r\n“I shall now return,” said the Professor, when we had walked a few\r\nyards: “you see, it's impossible to read here, for all my books are in\r\nthe house.”\r\n\r\nBut the children still kept fast hold of his hands. “Do come with us!”\r\n Sylvie entreated with tears in her eyes.\r\n\r\n“Well, well!” said the good-natured old man. “Perhaps I'll come after\r\nyou, some day soon. But I must go back now. You see I left off at\r\na comma, and it's so awkward not knowing how the sentence finishes!\r\nBesides, you've got to go through Dogland first, and I'm always a little\r\nnervous about dogs. But it'll be quite easy to come, as soon as I've\r\ncompleted my new invention--for carrying one's-self, you know. It wants\r\njust a little more working out.”\r\n\r\n“Won't that be very tiring, to carry yourself?” Sylvie enquired.\r\n\r\n“Well, no, my child. You see, whatever fatigue one incurs by carrying,\r\none saves by being carried! Good-bye, dears! Good-bye, Sir!” he added to\r\nmy intense surprise, giving my hand an affectionate squeeze.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye, Professor!” I replied: but my voice sounded strange and far\r\naway, and the children took not the slightest notice of our farewell.\r\nEvidently they neither saw me nor heard me, as, with their arms lovingly\r\ntwined round each other, they marched boldly on.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 13. A VISIT TO DOGLAND.\r\n\r\n“There's a house, away there to the left,” said Sylvie, after we had\r\nwalked what seemed to me about fifty miles. “Let's go and ask for a\r\nnight's lodging.”\r\n\r\n“It looks a very comfable house,” Bruno said, as we turned into the\r\nroad leading up to it. “I doos hope the Dogs will be kind to us, I is so\r\ntired and hungry!”\r\n\r\nA Mastiff, dressed in a scarlet collar, and carrying a musket, was\r\npacing up and down, like a sentinel, in front of the entrance. He\r\nstarted, on catching sight of the children, and came forwards to meet\r\nthem, keeping his musket pointed straight at Bruno, who stood quite\r\nstill, though he turned pale and kept tight hold of Sylvie's hand, while\r\nthe Sentinel walked solemnly round and round them, and looked at them\r\nfrom all points of view.\r\n\r\n{Image...The mastiff-sentinel}\r\n\r\n“Oobooh, hooh boohooyah!” He growled at last. “Woobah yahwah oobooh! Bow\r\nwahbah woobooyah? Bow wow?” he asked Bruno, severely.\r\n\r\nOf course Bruno understood all this, easily enough. All Fairies\r\nunderstand Doggee---that is, Dog-language. But, as you may find it a\r\nlittle difficult, just at first, I had better put it into English for\r\nyou. “Humans, I verily believe! A couple of stray Humans! What Dog do\r\nyou belong to? What do you want?”\r\n\r\n“We don't belong to a Dog!” Bruno began, in Doggee. (“Peoples never\r\nbelongs to Dogs!” he whispered to Sylvie.)\r\n\r\nBut Sylvie hastily checked him, for fear of hurting the Mastiff's\r\nfeelings. “Please, we want a little food, and a night's lodging--if\r\nthere's room in the house,” she added timidly. Sylvie spoke Doggee\r\nvery prettily: but I think it's almost better, for you, to give the\r\nconversation in English.\r\n\r\n“The house, indeed!” growled the Sentinel. “Have you never seen a Palace\r\nin your life? Come along with me! His Majesty must settle what's to be\r\ndone with you.”\r\n\r\nThey followed him through the entrance-hall, down a long passage, and\r\ninto a magnificent Saloon, around which were grouped dogs of all sorts\r\nand sizes. Two splendid Blood-hounds were solemnly sitting up, one on\r\neach side of the crown-bearer. Two or three Bull-dogs---whom I guessed\r\nto be the Body-Guard of the King--were waiting in grim silence: in fact\r\nthe only voices at all plainly audible were those of two little dogs,\r\nwho had mounted a settee, and were holding a lively discussion that\r\nlooked very like a quarrel.\r\n\r\n“Lords and Ladies in Waiting, and various Court Officials,” our guide\r\ngruffly remarked, as he led us in. Of me the Courtiers took no notice\r\nwhatever: but Sylvie and Bruno were the subject of many inquisitive\r\nlooks, and many whispered remarks, of which I only distinctly caught\r\none--made by a sly-looking Dachshund to his friend “Bah wooh wahyah\r\nhoobah Oobooh, hah bah?” (“She's not such a bad-looking Human, is she?”)\r\n\r\nLeaving the new arrivals in the centre of the Saloon, the Sentinel\r\nadvanced to a door, at the further end of it, which bore an inscription,\r\npainted on it in Doggee, “Royal Kennel--scratch and Yell.”\r\n\r\nBefore doing this, the Sentinel turned to the children, and said “Give\r\nme your names.”\r\n\r\n“We'd rather not!” Bruno exclaimed, pulling' Sylvie away from the door.\r\n“We want them ourselves. Come back, Sylvie! Come quick!”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense!” said Sylvie very decidedly: and gave their names in Doggee.\r\n\r\nThen the Sentinel scratched violently at the door, and gave a yell that\r\nmade Bruno shiver from head to foot.\r\n\r\n“Hooyah wah!” said a deep voice inside. (That's Doggee for “Come in!”)\r\n\r\n“It's the King himself!” the Mastiff whispered in an awestruck tone.\r\n“Take off your wigs, and lay them humbly at his paws.” (What we should\r\ncall “at his feet.”)\r\n\r\nSylvie was just going to explain, very politely, that really they\r\ncouldn't perform that ceremony, because their wigs wouldn't come off,\r\nwhen the door of the Royal Kennel opened, and an enormous Newfoundland\r\nDog put his head out. “Bow wow?” was his first question.\r\n\r\n“When His Majesty speaks to you,” the Sentinel hastily whispered to\r\nBruno, “you should prick up your ears!”\r\n\r\nBruno looked doubtfully at Sylvie. “I'd rather not, please,” he said.\r\n“It would hurt.”\r\n\r\n{Image...The dog-king}\r\n\r\n“It doesn't hurt a bit!” the Sentinel said with some indignation. “Look!\r\nIt's like this!” And he pricked up his ears like two railway signals.\r\n\r\nSylvie gently explained matters. “I'm afraid we ca'n't manage it,”\r\n she said in a low voice. “I'm very sorry: but our ears haven't got the\r\nright--” she wanted to say “machinery” in Doggee: but she had forgotten\r\nthe word, and could only think of “steam-engine.”\r\n\r\nThe Sentinel repeated Sylvie's explanation to the King.\r\n\r\n“Can't prick up their ears without a steam-engine!” His Majesty\r\nexclaimed. “They must be curious creatures! I must have a look at them!”\r\n And he came out of his Kennel, and walked solemnly up to the children.\r\n\r\nWhat was the amazement--nor to say the horror of the whole assembly,\r\nwhen Sylvie actually patted His Majesty on the head, while Bruno seized\r\nhis long ears and pretended to tie them together under his chin!\r\n\r\nThe Sentinel groaned aloud: a beautiful Greyhound who appeared to be\r\none of the Ladies in Waiting--fainted away: and all the other Courtiers\r\nhastily drew back, and left plenty of room for the huge Newfoundland to\r\nspring upon the audacious strangers, and tear them limb from limb.\r\n\r\nOnly--he didn't. On the contrary his Majesty actually smiled so far as\r\na Dog can smile--and (the other Dogs couldn't believe their eyes, but it\r\nwas true, all the same) his Majesty wagged his tail!\r\n\r\n“Yah! Hooh hahwooh!” (that is “Well! I never!”) was the universal cry.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty looked round him severely, and gave a slight growl, which\r\nproduced instant silence. “Conduct my friends to the banqueting-hall!”\r\n he said, laying such an emphasis on “my friends” that several of the\r\ndogs rolled over helplessly on their backs and began to lick Bruno's\r\nfeet.\r\n\r\nA procession was formed, but I only ventured to follow as far as the\r\ndoor of the banqueting-hall, so furious was the uproar of barking dogs\r\nwithin. So I sat down by the King, who seemed to have gone to sleep, and\r\nwaited till the children returned to say good-night, when His Majesty\r\ngot up and shook himself.\r\n\r\n“Time for bed!” he said with a sleepy yawn. “The attendants will show\r\nyou your room,” he added, aside, to Sylvie and Bruno. “Bring lights!”\r\n And, with a dignified air, he held out his paw for them to kiss.\r\n\r\nBut the children were evidently not well practised in Court-manners.\r\nSylvie simply stroked the great paw: Bruno hugged it: the Master of the\r\nCeremonies looked shocked.\r\n\r\nAll this time Dog-waiters, in splendid livery, were running up with\r\nlighted candles: but, as fast as they put them upon the table, other\r\nwaiters ran away with them, so that there never seemed to be one for\r\nme, though the Master kept nudging me with his elbow, and repeating, “I\r\nca'n't let you sleep here! You're not in bed, you know!”\r\n\r\nI made a great effort, and just succeeded in getting out the words “I\r\nknow I'm not. I'm in an arm-chair.”\r\n\r\n“Well, forty winks will do you no harm,” the Master said, and left me.\r\nI could scarcely hear his words: and no wonder: he was leaning over the\r\nside of a ship, that was miles away from the pier on which I stood. The\r\nship passed over the horizon and I sank back into the arm-chair.\r\n\r\nThe next thing I remember is that it was morning: breakfast was just\r\nover: Sylvie was lifting Bruno down from a high chair, and saying to\r\na Spaniel, who was regarding them with a most benevolent smile, “Yes,\r\nthank you we've had a very nice breakfast. Haven't we, Bruno?”\r\n\r\n“There was too many bones in the”--Bruno began, but Sylvie frowned at\r\nhim, and laid her finger on her lips, for, at this moment, the travelers\r\nwere waited on by a very dignified officer, the Head-Growler, whose duty\r\nit was, first to conduct them to the King to bid him farewell and\r\nthen to escort them to the boundary of Dogland. The great Newfoundland\r\nreceived them most affably but instead of saying “good-bye” he startled\r\nthe Head-growler into giving three savage growls, by announcing that he\r\nwould escort them himself.\r\n\r\nIt is a most unusual proceeding, your Majesty! the Head-Growler\r\nexclaimed, almost choking with vexation at being set aside, for he\r\nhad put on his best Court-suit, made entirely of cat-skins, for the\r\noccasion.\r\n\r\n“I shall escort them myself,” his Majesty repeated, gently but firmly,\r\nlaying aside the Royal robes, and changing his crown for a small\r\ncoronet, “and you may stay at home.”\r\n\r\n“I are glad!” Bruno whispered to Sylvie, when they had got well out of\r\nhearing. “He were so welly cross!” And he not only patted their Royal\r\nescort, but even hugged him round the neck in the exuberance of his\r\ndelight.\r\n\r\nHis Majesty calmly wagged the Royal tail. “It's quite a relief,” he\r\nsaid, “getting away from that Palace now and then! Royal Dogs have a\r\ndull life of it, I can tell you! Would you mind” (this to Sylvie, in a\r\nlow voice, and looking a little shy and embarrassed) “would you mind the\r\ntrouble of just throwing that stick for me to fetch?”\r\n\r\nSylvie was too much astonished to do anything for a moment: it sounded\r\nsuch a monstrous impossibility that a King should wish to run after a\r\nstick. But Bruno was equal to the occasion, and with a glad shout of “Hi\r\nthen! Fetch it, good Doggie!” he hurled it over a clump of bushes. The\r\nnext moment the Monarch of Dogland had bounded over the bushes, and\r\npicked up the stick, and came galloping back to the children with it in\r\nhis mouth. Bruno took it from him with great decision. “Beg for it!”\r\n he insisted; and His Majesty begged. “Paw!” commanded Sylvie; and His\r\nMajesty gave his paw. In short, the solemn ceremony of escorting the\r\ntravelers to the boundaries of Dogland became one long uproarious game\r\nof play!\r\n\r\n“But business is business!” the Dog-King said at last. “And I must\r\ngo back to mine. I couldn't come any further,” he added, consulting a\r\ndog-watch, which hung on a chain round his neck, “not even if there were\r\na Cat insight!”\r\n\r\nThey took an affectionate farewell of His Majesty, and trudged on.\r\n\r\n“That were a dear dog!” Bruno exclaimed. “Has we to go far, Sylvie? I's\r\ntired!”\r\n\r\n“Not much further, darling!” Sylvie gently replied. “Do you see that\r\nshining, just beyond those trees? I'm almost sure it's the gate of\r\nFairyland! I know it's all golden--Father told me so and so bright, so\r\nbright!” she went on dreamily.\r\n\r\n“It dazzles!” said Bruno, shading his eyes with one little hand, while\r\nthe other clung tightly to Sylvie's hand, as if he were half-alarmed at\r\nher strange manner.\r\n\r\nFor the child moved on as if walking in her sleep, her large eyes gazing\r\ninto the far distance, and her breath coming and going in quick pantings\r\nof eager delight. I knew, by some mysterious mental light, that a great\r\nchange was taking place in my sweet little friend (for such I loved to\r\nthink her) and that she was passing from the condition of a mere Outland\r\nSprite into the true Fairy-nature.\r\n\r\nUpon Bruno the change came later: but it was completed in both\r\nbefore they reached the golden gate, through which I knew it would be\r\nimpossible for me to follow. I could but stand outside, and take a last\r\nlook at the two sweet children, ere they disappeared within, and the\r\ngolden gate closed with a bang.\r\n\r\nAnd with such a bang! “It never will shut like any other cupboard-door,”\r\n Arthur explained. “There's something wrong with the hinge. However,\r\nhere's the cake and wine. And you've had your forty winks. So you really\r\nmust get off to bed, old man! You're fit for nothing else. Witness my\r\nhand, Arthur Forester, M.D.”\r\n\r\nBy this time I was wide-awake again. “Not quite yet!” I pleaded. “Really\r\nI'm not sleepy now. And it isn't midnight yet.”\r\n\r\n“Well, I did want to say another word to you,” Arthur replied in a\r\nrelenting tone, as he supplied me with the supper he had prescribed.\r\n“Only I thought you were too sleepy for it to-night.”\r\n\r\nWe took our midnight meal almost in silence; for an unusual nervousness\r\nseemed to have seized on my old friend.\r\n\r\n“What kind of a night is it?” he asked, rising and undrawing the\r\nwindow-curtains, apparently to change the subject for a minute. I\r\nfollowed him to the window, and we stood together, looking out, in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n“When I first spoke to you about--” Arthur began, after a long and\r\nembarrassing silence, “that is, when we first talked about her--for I\r\nthink it was you that introduced the subject--my own position in life\r\nforbade me to do more than worship her from a distance: and I was\r\nturning over plans for leaving this place finally, and settling\r\nsomewhere out of all chance of meeting her again. That seemed to be my\r\nonly chance of usefulness in life.”\r\n\r\n“Would that have been wise?” I said. “To leave yourself no hope at all?”\r\n\r\n“There was no hope to leave,” Arthur firmly replied, though his eyes\r\nglittered with tears as he gazed upwards into the midnight sky, from\r\nwhich one solitary star, the glorious 'Vega,' blazed out in fitful\r\nsplendour through the driving clouds. “She was like that star to\r\nme--bright, beautiful, and pure, but out of reach, out of reach!”\r\n\r\nHe drew the curtains again, and we returned to our places by the\r\nfireside.\r\n\r\n“What I wanted to tell you was this,” he resumed. “I heard this evening\r\nfrom my solicitor. I can't go into the details of the business, but the\r\nupshot is that my worldly wealth is much more than I thought, and I am\r\n(or shall soon be) in a position to offer marriage, without imprudence,\r\nto any lady, even if she brought nothing. I doubt if there would be\r\nanything on her side: the Earl is poor, I believe. But I should have\r\nenough for both, even if health failed.”\r\n\r\n“I wish you all happiness in your married life!” I cried. “Shall you\r\nspeak to the Earl to-morrow?”\r\n\r\n“Not yet awhile,” said Arthur. “He is very friendly, but I dare not\r\nthink he means more than that, as yet. And as for--as for Lady Muriel,\r\ntry as I may, I cannot read her feelings towards me. If there is love,\r\nshe is hiding it! No, I must wait, I must wait!”\r\n\r\nI did not like to press any further advice on my friend, whose judgment,\r\nI felt, was so much more sober and thoughtful than my own; and we parted\r\nwithout more words on the subject that had now absorbed his thoughts,\r\nnay, his very life.\r\n\r\nThe next morning a letter from my solicitor arrived, summoning me to\r\ntown on important business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 14. FAIRY-SYLVIE.\r\n\r\nFor a full month the business, for which I had returned to London,\r\ndetained me there: and even then it was only the urgent advice of my\r\nphysician that induced me to leave it unfinished and pay another visit\r\nto Elveston.\r\n\r\nArthur had written once or twice during the month; but in none of his\r\nletters was there any mention of Lady Muriel. Still, I did not augur ill\r\nfrom his silence: to me it looked like the natural action of a lover,\r\nwho, even while his heart was singing “She is mine!”, would fear to\r\npaint his happiness in the cold phrases of a written letter, but would\r\nwait to tell it by word of mouth. “Yes,” I thought, “I am to hear his\r\nsong of triumph from his own lips!”\r\n\r\nThe night I arrived we had much to say on other matters: and, tired with\r\nthe journey, I went to bed early, leaving the happy secret still untold.\r\nNext day, however, as we chatted on over the remains of luncheon, I\r\nventured to put the momentous question. “Well, old friend, you have told\r\nme nothing of Lady Muriel--nor when the happy day is to be?”\r\n\r\n“The happy day,” Arthur said, looking unexpectedly grave, “is yet in the\r\ndim future. We need to know--or, rather, she needs to know me better.\r\nI know her sweet nature, thoroughly, by this time. But I dare not speak\r\ntill I am sure that my love is returned.”\r\n\r\n“Don't wait too long!” I said gaily. “Faint heart never won fair lady!”\r\n\r\n“It is 'faint heart,' perhaps. But really I dare not speak just yet.”\r\n\r\n“But meanwhile,” I pleaded, “you are running a risk that perhaps you\r\nhave not thought of. Some other man--”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Arthur firmly. “She is heart-whole: I am sure of that. Yet,\r\nif she loves another better than me, so be it! I will not spoil her\r\nhappiness. The secret shall die with me. But she is my first--and my\r\nonly love!”\r\n\r\n“That is all very beautiful sentiment,” I said, “but it is not\r\npractical. It is not like you.\r\n\r\n\r\n    He either fears his fate too much,\r\n    Or his desert is small,\r\n    Who dares not put it to the touch,\r\n    To win or lose it all.”\r\n\r\n“I dare not ask the question whether there is another!” he said\r\npassionately. “It would break my heart to know it!”\r\n\r\n“Yet is it wise to leave it unasked? You must not waste your life upon\r\nan 'if'!”\r\n\r\n“I tell you I dare not!,”\r\n\r\n“May I find it out for you?” I asked, with the freedom of an old friend.\r\n\r\n“No, no!” he replied with a pained look. “I entreat you to say nothing.\r\nLet it wait.”\r\n\r\n“As you please,” I said: and judged it best to say no more just then.\r\n“But this evening,” I thought, “I will call on the Earl. I may be able\r\nto see how the land lies, without so much as saying a word!”\r\n\r\nIt was a very hot afternoon--too hot to go for a walk or do anything--or\r\nelse it wouldn't have happened, I believe.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, I want to know--dear Child who reads this!--why\r\nFairies should always be teaching us to do our duty, and lecturing us\r\nwhen we go wrong, and we should never teach them anything? You can't\r\nmean to say that Fairies are never greedy, or selfish, or cross, or\r\ndeceitful, because that would be nonsense, you know. Well then, don't\r\nyou think they might be all the better for a little lecturing and\r\npunishing now and then?\r\n\r\nI really don't see why it shouldn't be tried, and I'm almost sure that,\r\nif you could only catch a Fairy, and put it in the corner, and give it\r\nnothing but bread and water for a day or two, you'd find it quite an\r\nimproved character--it would take down its conceit a little, at all\r\nevents.\r\n\r\nThe next question is, what is the best time for seeing Fairies? I\r\nbelieve I can tell you all about that.\r\n\r\nThe first rule is, that it must be a very hot day--that we may consider\r\nas settled: and you must be just a little sleepy--but not too sleepy to\r\nkeep your eyes open, mind. Well, and you ought to feel a little--what\r\none may call “fairyish “--the Scotch call it “eerie,” and perhaps that's\r\na prettier word; if you don't know what it means, I'm afraid I can\r\nhardly explain it; you must wait till you meet a Fairy, and then you'll\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nAnd the last rule is, that the crickets should not be chirping. I can't\r\nstop to explain that: you must take it on trust for the present.\r\n\r\nSo, if all these things happen together, you have a good chance of\r\nseeing a Fairy--or at least a much better chance than if they didn't.\r\n\r\nThe first thing I noticed, as I went lazily along through an open place\r\nin the wood, was a large Beetle lying struggling on its back, and I went\r\ndown upon one knee to help the poor thing to its feet again. In some\r\nthings, you know, you ca'n't be quite sure what an insect would like:\r\nfor instance, I never could quite settle, supposing I were a moth,\r\nwhether I would rather be kept out of the candle, or be allowed to fly\r\nstraight in and get burnt--or again, supposing I were a spider, I'm not\r\nsure if I should be quite pleased to have my web torn down, and the fly\r\nlet loose--but I feel quite certain that, if I were a beetle and had\r\nrolled over on my back, I should always be glad to be helped up again.\r\n\r\nSo, as I was saying, I had gone down upon one knee, and was just\r\nreaching out a little stick to turn the Beetle over, when I saw a sight\r\nthat made me draw back hastily and hold my breath, for fear of making\r\nany noise and frightening the little creature a way.\r\n\r\nNot that she looked as if she would be easily frightened: she seemed so\r\ngood and gentle that I'm sure she would never expect that any one could\r\nwish to hurt her. She was only a few inches high, and was dressed in\r\ngreen, so that you really would hardly have noticed her among the long\r\ngrass; and she was so delicate and graceful that she quite seemed to\r\nbelong to the place, almost as if she were one of the flowers. I may\r\ntell you, besides, that she had no wings (I don't believe in Fairies\r\nwith wings), and that she had quantities of long brown hair and large\r\nearnest brown eyes, and then I shall have done all I can to give you an\r\nidea of her.\r\n\r\n{Image...Fairy-sylvie}\r\n\r\nSylvie (I found out her name afterwards) had knelt down, just as I was\r\ndoing, to help the Beetle; but it needed more than a little stick for\r\nher to get it on its legs again; it was as much as she could do, with\r\nboth arms, to roll the heavy thing over; and all the while she was\r\ntalking to it, half scolding and half comforting, as a nurse might do\r\nwith a child that had fallen down.\r\n\r\n“There, there! You needn't cry so much about it. You're not killed\r\nyet--though if you were, you couldn't cry, you know, and so it's a\r\ngeneral rule against crying, my dear! And how did you come to\r\ntumble over? But I can see well enough how it was--I needn't ask you\r\nthat--walking over sand-pits with your chin in the air, as usual. Of\r\ncourse if you go among sand-pits like that, you must expect to tumble.\r\nYou should look.”\r\n\r\nThe Beetle murmured something that sounded like “I did look,” and Sylvie\r\nwent on again.\r\n\r\n“But I know you didn't! You never do! You always walk with your chin\r\nup--you're so dreadfully conceited. Well, let's see how many legs are\r\nbroken this time. Why, none of them, I declare! And what's the good of\r\nhaving six legs, my dear, if you can only kick them all about in the air\r\nwhen you tumble? Legs are meant to walk with, you know. Now don't begin\r\nputting out your wings yet; I've more to say. Go to the frog that\r\nlives behind that buttercup--give him my compliments--Sylvie's\r\ncompliments--can you say compliments'?”\r\n\r\nThe Beetle tried and, I suppose, succeeded.\r\n\r\n“Yes, that's right. And tell him he's to give you some of that salve I\r\nleft with him yesterday. And you'd better get him to rub it in for you.\r\nHe's got rather cold hands, but you mustn't mind that.”\r\n\r\nI think the Beetle must have shuddered at this idea, for Sylvie went on\r\nin a graver tone. “Now you needn't pretend to be so particular as all\r\nthat, as if you were too grand to be rubbed by a frog. The fact is, you\r\nought to be very much obliged to him. Suppose you could get nobody but a\r\ntoad to do it, how would you like that?”\r\n\r\nThere was a little pause, and then Sylvie added “Now you may go. Be a\r\ngood beetle, and don't keep your chin in the air.” And then began one of\r\nthose performances of humming, and whizzing, and restless banging about,\r\nsuch as a beetle indulges in when it has decided on flying, but hasn't\r\nquite made up its mind which way to go. At last, in one of its awkward\r\nzigzags, it managed to fly right into my face, and, by the time I had\r\nrecovered from the shock, the little Fairy was gone.\r\n\r\nI looked about in all directions for the little creature, but there\r\nwas no trace of her--and my 'eerie' feeling was quite gone off, and the\r\ncrickets were chirping again merrily--so I knew she was really gone.\r\n\r\nAnd now I've got time to tell you the rule about the crickets. They\r\nalways leave off chirping when a Fairy goes by--because a Fairy's a kind\r\nof queen over them, I suppose--at all events it's a much grander\r\nthing than a cricket--so whenever you're walking out, and the crickets\r\nsuddenly leave off chirping, you may be sure that they see a Fairy.\r\n\r\nI walked on sadly enough, you may be sure. However, I comforted myself\r\nwith thinking “It's been a very wonderful afternoon, so far. I'll just\r\ngo quietly on and look about me, and I shouldn't wonder if I were to\r\ncome across another Fairy somewhere.”\r\n\r\nPeering about in this way, I happened to notice a plant with rounded\r\nleaves, and with queer little holes cut in the middle of several of\r\nthem. “Ah, the leafcutter bee!” I carelessly remarked--you know I am\r\nvery learned in Natural History (for instance, I can always tell kittens\r\nfrom chickens at one glance)--and I was passing on, when a sudden\r\nthought made me stoop down and examine the leaves.\r\n\r\nThen a little thrill of delight ran through me--for I noticed that the\r\nholes were all arranged so as to form letters; there were three leaves\r\nside by side, with “B,” “R,” and “U” marked on them, and after some\r\nsearch I found two more, which contained an “N” and an “O.”\r\n\r\nAnd then, all in a moment, a flash of inner light seemed to illumine\r\na part of my life that had all but faded into oblivion--the strange\r\nvisions I had experienced during my journey to Elveston: and with a\r\nthrill of delight I thought “Those visions are destined to be linked\r\nwith my waking life!”\r\n\r\nBy this time the 'eerie' feeling had come back again, and I suddenly\r\nobserved that no crickets were chirping; so I felt quite sure that Bruno\r\nwas somewhere very near.\r\n\r\nAnd so indeed he was--so near that I had very nearly walked over him\r\nwithout seeing him; which would have been dreadful, always supposing\r\nthat Fairies can be walked over my own belief is that they are something\r\nof the nature of Will-o'-the-wisps: and there's no walking over them.\r\n\r\nThink of any pretty little boy you know, with rosy cheeks, large dark\r\neyes, and tangled brown hair, and then fancy him made small enough to go\r\ncomfortably into a coffee-cup, and you'll have a very fair idea of him.\r\n\r\n“What's your name, little one?” I began, in as soft a voice as I could\r\nmanage. And, by the way, why is it we always begin by asking little\r\nchildren their names? Is it because we fancy a name will help to make\r\nthem a little bigger? You never thought of asking a real large man his\r\nname, now, did you? But, however that may be, I felt it quite necessary\r\nto know his name; so, as he didn't answer my question, I asked it again\r\na little louder. “What's your name, my little man?”\r\n\r\n“What's oors?” he said, without looking up.\r\n\r\nI told him my name quite gently, for he was much too small to be angry\r\nwith.\r\n\r\n“Duke of Anything?” he asked, just looking at me for a moment, and then\r\ngoing on with his work.\r\n\r\n“Not Duke at all,” I said, a little ashamed of having to confess it.\r\n\r\n“Oo're big enough to be two Dukes,” said the little creature. “I suppose\r\noo're Sir Something, then?”\r\n\r\n“No,” I said, feeling more and more ashamed. “I haven't got any title.”\r\n\r\nThe Fairy seemed to think that in that case I really wasn't worth the\r\ntrouble of talking to, for he quietly went on digging, and tearing the\r\nflowers to pieces.\r\n\r\nAfter a few minutes I tried again. “Please tell me what your name is.”\r\n\r\n“Bruno,” the little fellow answered, very readily. “Why didn't oo say\r\n'please' before?”\r\n\r\n“That's something like what we used to be taught in the nursery,” I\r\nthought to myself, looking back through the long years (about a hundred\r\nof them, since you ask the question), to the time when I was a little\r\nchild. And here an idea came into my head, and I asked him “Aren't you\r\none of the Fairies that teach children to be good?”\r\n\r\n“Well, we have to do that sometimes,” said Bruno, “and a dreadful bother\r\nit is.” As he said this, he savagely tore a heartsease in two, and\r\ntrampled on the pieces.\r\n\r\n“What are you doing there, Bruno?” I said.\r\n\r\n“Spoiling Sylvie's garden,” was all the answer Bruno would give at\r\nfirst. But, as he went on tearing up the flowers, he muttered to himself\r\n“The nasty cross thing wouldn't let me go and play this morning,--said\r\nI must finish my lessons first--lessons, indeed! I'll vex her finely,\r\nthough!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Bruno, you shouldn't do that!” I cried. “Don't you know that's\r\nrevenge? And revenge is a wicked, cruel, dangerous thing!”\r\n\r\n“River-edge?” said Bruno. “What a funny word! I suppose oo call it cruel\r\nand dangerous 'cause, if oo wented too far and tumbleded in, oo'd get\r\ndrownded.”\r\n\r\n“No, not river-edge,” I explained: “revenge” (saying the word very\r\nslowly). But I couldn't help thinking that Bruno's explanation did very\r\nwell for either word.\r\n\r\n“Oh!” said Bruno, opening his eyes very wide, but without trying to\r\nrepeat the word.\r\n\r\n“Come! Try and pronounce it, Bruno!” I said, cheerfully. “Re-venge,\r\nre-venge.”\r\n\r\nBut Bruno only tossed his little head, and said he couldn't; that his\r\nmouth wasn't the right shape for words of that kind. And the more I\r\nlaughed, the more sulky the little fellow got about it.\r\n\r\n“Well, never mind, my little man!” I said. “Shall I help you with that\r\njob?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, please,” Bruno said, quite pacified.\r\n\r\n“Only I wiss I could think of somefin to vex her more than this. Oo\r\ndon't know how hard it is to make her angry!”\r\n\r\n“Now listen to me, Bruno, and I'll teach you quite a splendid kind of\r\nrevenge!”\r\n\r\n“Somefin that'll vex her finely?” he asked with gleaming eyes.\r\n\r\n“Something that will vex her finely. First, we'll get up all the weeds\r\nin her garden. See, there are a good many at this end quite hiding the\r\nflowers.”\r\n\r\n“But that won't vex her!” said Bruno.\r\n\r\n“After that,” I said, without noticing the remark, “we'll water this\r\nhighest bed--up here. You see it's getting quite dry and dusty.”\r\n\r\nBruno looked at me inquisitively, but he said nothing this time.\r\n\r\n“Then after that,” I went on, “the walks want sweeping a bit; and I\r\nthink you might cut down that tall nettle--it's so close to the garden\r\nthat it's quite in the way--”\r\n\r\n“What is oo talking about?” Bruno impatiently interrupted me. “All that\r\nwon't vex her a bit!”\r\n\r\n“Won't it?” I said, innocently. “Then, after that, suppose we put in\r\nsome of these coloured pebbles--just to mark the divisions between\r\nthe different kinds of flowers, you know. That'll have a very pretty\r\neffect.”\r\n\r\nBruno turned round and had another good stare at me. At last there\r\ncame an odd little twinkle into his eyes, and he said, with quite a new\r\nmeaning in his voice, “That'll do nicely. Let's put 'em in rows--all the\r\nred together, and all the blue together.”\r\n\r\n“That'll do capitally,” I said; “and then--what kind of flowers does\r\nSylvie like best?”\r\n\r\nBruno had to put his thumb in his mouth and consider a little before he\r\ncould answer. “Violets,” he said, at last.\r\n\r\n“There's a beautiful bed of violets down by the brook--”\r\n\r\n“Oh, let's fetch 'em!” cried Bruno, giving a little skip into the air.\r\n“Here! Catch hold of my hand, and I'll help oo along. The grass is\r\nrather thick down that way.”\r\n\r\nI couldn't help laughing at his having so entirely forgotten what a\r\nbig creature he was talking to. “No, not yet, Bruno,” I said: “we must\r\nconsider what's the right thing to do first. You see we've got quite a\r\nbusiness before us.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, let's consider,” said Bruno, putting his thumb into his mouth\r\nagain, and sitting down upon a dead mouse.\r\n\r\n“What do you keep that mouse for?” I said. “You should either bury it,\r\nor else throw it into the brook.”\r\n\r\n“Why, it's to measure with!” cried Bruno. “How ever would oo do a garden\r\nwithout one? We make each bed three mouses and a half long, and two\r\nmouses wide.”\r\n\r\nI stopped him, as he was dragging it off by the tail to show me how it\r\nwas used, for I was half afraid the 'eerie' feeling might go off before\r\nwe had finished the garden, and in that case I should see no more of him\r\nor Sylvie. “I think the best way will be for you to weed the beds, while\r\nI sort out these pebbles, ready to mark the walks with.”\r\n\r\n“That's it!” cried Bruno. “And I'll tell oo about the caterpillars while\r\nwe work.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, let's hear about the caterpillars,” I said, as I drew the pebbles\r\ntogether into a heap and began dividing them into colours.\r\n\r\nAnd Bruno went on in a low, rapid tone, more as if he were talking to\r\nhimself. “Yesterday I saw two little caterpillars, when I was sitting\r\nby the brook, just where oo go into the wood. They were quite green, and\r\nthey had yellow eyes, and they didn't see me. And one of them had got a\r\nmoth's wing to carry--a great brown moth's wing, oo know, all dry, with\r\nfeathers. So he couldn't want it to eat, I should think--perhaps he\r\nmeant to make a cloak for the winter?”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps,” I said, for Bruno had twisted up the last word into a sort of\r\nquestion, and was looking at me for an answer.\r\n\r\nOne word was quite enough for the little fellow, and he went on merrily.\r\n“Well, and so he didn't want the other caterpillar to see the moth's\r\nwing, oo know--so what must he do but try to carry it with all his left\r\nlegs, and he tried to walk on the other set. Of course he toppled over\r\nafter that.”\r\n\r\n“After what?” I said, catching at the last word, for, to tell the truth,\r\nI hadn't been attending much.\r\n\r\n“He toppled over,” Bruno repeated, very gravely, “and if oo ever saw a\r\ncaterpillar topple over, oo'd know it's a welly serious thing, and not\r\nsit grinning like that--and I sha'n't tell oo no more!”\r\n\r\n“Indeed and indeed, Bruno, I didn't mean to grin. See, I'm quite grave\r\nagain now.”\r\n\r\nBut Bruno only folded his arms, and said “Don't tell me. I see a little\r\ntwinkle in one of oor eyes--just like the moon.”\r\n\r\n“Why do you think I'm like the moon, Bruno?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Oor face is large and round like the moon,” Bruno answered, looking\r\nat me thoughtfully. “It doosn't shine quite so bright--but it's more\r\ncleaner.”\r\n\r\nI couldn't help smiling at this. “You know I sometimes wash my face,\r\nBruno. The moon never does that.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, doosn't she though!” cried Bruno; and he leant forwards and added\r\nin a solemn whisper, “The moon's face gets dirtier and dirtier every\r\nnight, till it's black all across. And then, when it's dirty all\r\nover--so--” (he passed his hand across his own rosy cheeks as he spoke)\r\n“then she washes it.”\r\n\r\n“Then it's all clean again, isn't it?”\r\n\r\n“Not all in a moment,” said Bruno. “What a deal of teaching oo wants!\r\nShe washes it little by little--only she begins at the other edge, oo\r\nknow.”\r\n\r\nBy this time he was sitting quietly on the dead mouse with his arms\r\nfolded, and the weeding wasn't getting on a bit: so I had to say “Work\r\nfirst, pleasure afterwards: no more talking till that bed's finished.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 15. BRUNO'S REVENGE.\r\n\r\nAfter that we had a few minutes of silence, while I sorted out the\r\npebbles, and amused myself with watching Bruno's plan of gardening. It\r\nwas quite a new plan to me: he always measured each bed before he weeded\r\nit, as if he was afraid the weeding would make it shrink; and once, when\r\nit came out longer than he wished, he set to work to thump the mouse\r\nwith his little fist, crying out “There now! It's all gone wrong again!\r\nWhy don't oo keep oor tail straight when I tell oo!”\r\n\r\n“I'll tell you what I'll do,” Bruno said in a half-whisper, as we\r\nworked. “Oo like Fairies, don't oo?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I said: “of course I do, or I shouldn't have come here. I should\r\nhave gone to some place where there are no Fairies.”\r\n\r\nBruno laughed contemptuously. “Why, oo might as well say oo'd go to some\r\nplace where there wasn't any air--supposing oo didn't like air!”\r\n\r\nThis was a rather difficult idea to grasp. I tried a change of subject.\r\n“You're nearly the first Fairy I ever saw. Have you ever seen any people\r\nbesides me?”\r\n\r\n“Plenty!” said Bruno. “We see'em when we walk in the road.”\r\n\r\n“But they ca'n't see you. How is it they never tread on you?”\r\n\r\n“Ca'n't tread on us,” said Bruno, looking amused at my ignorance. “Why,\r\nsuppose oo're walking, here--so--” (making little marks on the ground)\r\n“and suppose there's a Fairy--that's me--walking here. Very well then,\r\noo put one foot here, and one foot here, so oo doosn't tread on the\r\nFairy.”\r\n\r\nThis was all very well as an explanation, but it didn't convince me.\r\n“Why shouldn't I put one foot on the Fairy?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“I don't know why,” the little fellow said in a thoughtful tone. “But\r\nI know oo wouldn't. Nobody never walked on the top of a Fairy. Now\r\nI'll tell oo what I'll do, as oo're so fond of Fairies. I'll get oo\r\nan invitation to the Fairy-King's dinner-party. I know one of the\r\nhead-waiters.”\r\n\r\nI couldn't help laughing at this idea. “Do the waiters invite the\r\nguests?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Oh, not to sit down!” Bruno said. “But to wait at table. Oo'd like\r\nthat, wouldn't oo? To hand about plates, and so on.”\r\n\r\n“Well, but that's not so nice as sitting at the table, is it?”\r\n\r\n“Of course it isn't,” Bruno said, in a tone as if he rather pitied my\r\nignorance; “but if oo're not even Sir Anything, oo ca'n't expect to be\r\nallowed to sit at the table, oo know.”\r\n\r\nI said, as meekly as I could, that I didn't expect it, but it was the\r\nonly way of going to a dinner-party that I really enjoyed. And Bruno\r\ntossed his head, and said, in a rather offended tone that I might do as\r\nI pleased--there were many he knew that would give their ears to go.\r\n\r\n“Have you ever been yourself, Bruno?”\r\n\r\n“They invited me once, last week,” Bruno said, very gravely. “It was\r\nto wash up the soup-plates--no, the cheese-plates I mean that was\r\ngrand enough. And I waited at table. And I didn't hardly make only one\r\nmistake.”\r\n\r\n“What was it?” I said. “You needn't mind telling me.”\r\n\r\n“Only bringing scissors to cut the beef with,” Bruno said carelessly.\r\n“But the grandest thing of all was, I fetched the King a glass of\r\ncider!”\r\n\r\n“That was grand!” I said, biting my lip to keep myself from laughing.\r\n\r\n“Wasn't it?” said Bruno, very earnestly. “Oo know it isn't every one\r\nthat's had such an honour as that!”\r\n\r\nThis set me thinking of the various queer things we call “an honour” in\r\nthis world, but which, after all, haven't a bit more honour in them than\r\nwhat Bruno enjoyed, when he took the King a glass of cider.\r\n\r\nI don't know how long I might not have dreamed on in this way, if Bruno\r\nhadn't suddenly roused me. “Oh, come here quick!” he cried, in a state\r\nof the wildest excitement. “Catch hold of his other horn! I ca'n't hold\r\nhim more than a minute!”\r\n\r\nHe was struggling desperately with a great snail, clinging to one of its\r\nhorns, and nearly breaking his poor little back in his efforts to drag\r\nit over a blade of grass.\r\n\r\nI saw we should have no more gardening if I let this sort of thing go\r\non, so I quietly took the snail away, and put it on a bank where he\r\ncouldn't reach it. “We'll hunt it afterwards, Bruno,” I said, “if you\r\nreally want to catch it. But what's the use of it when you've got it?”\r\n\r\n“What's the use of a fox when oo've got it?” said Bruno. “I know oo big\r\nthings hunt foxes.”\r\n\r\nI tried to think of some good reason why “big things” should hunt foxes,\r\nand he should not hunt snails, but none came into my head: so I said at\r\nlast, “Well, I suppose one's as good as the other. I'll go snail-hunting\r\nmyself some day.”\r\n\r\n“I should think oo wouldn't be so silly,” said Bruno, “as to go\r\nsnail-hunting by oor-self. Why, oo'd never get the snail along, if oo\r\nhadn't somebody to hold on to his other horn!”\r\n\r\n“Of course I sha'n't go alone,” I said, quite gravely. “By the way,\r\nis that the best kind to hunt, or do you recommend the ones without\r\nshells?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no, we never hunt the ones without shells,” Bruno said, with a\r\nlittle shudder at the thought of it. “They're always so cross about it;\r\nand then, if oo tumbles over them, they're ever so sticky!”\r\n\r\nBy this time we had nearly finished the garden. I had fetched some\r\nviolets, and Bruno was just helping me to put in the last, when he\r\nsuddenly stopped and said “I'm tired.”\r\n\r\n“Rest then,” I said: “I can go on without you, quite well.”\r\n\r\nBruno needed no second invitation: he at once began arranging the dead\r\nmouse as a kind of sofa. “And I'll sing oo a little song,” he said, as\r\nhe rolled it about.\r\n\r\n“Do,” said I: “I like songs very much.”\r\n\r\n“Which song will oo choose?” Bruno said, as he dragged the mouse into a\r\nplace where he could get a good view of me. “'Ting, ting, ting' is the\r\nnicest.”\r\n\r\nThere was no resisting such a strong hint as this: however, I pretended\r\nto think about it for a moment, and then said “Well, I like 'Ting, ting,\r\nting,' best of all.”\r\n\r\n{Image...Bruno's revenge}\r\n\r\n“That shows oo're a good judge of music,” Bruno said, with a pleased\r\nlook. “How many hare-bells would oo like?” And he put his thumb into his\r\nmouth to help me to consider.\r\n\r\nAs there was only one cluster of hare-bells within easy reach, I said\r\nvery gravely that I thought one would do this time, and I picked it\r\nand gave it to him. Bruno ran his hand once or twice up and down\r\nthe flowers, like a musician trying an instrument, producing a most\r\ndelicious delicate tinkling as he did so. I had never heard flower-music\r\nbefore--I don't think one can, unless one's in the 'eerie' state and I\r\ndon't know quite how to give you an idea of what it was like, except by\r\nsaying that it sounded like a peal of bells a thousand miles off.\r\nWhen he had satisfied himself that the flowers were in tune, he seated\r\nhimself on the dead mouse (he never seemed really comfortable anywhere\r\nelse), and, looking up at me with a merry twinkle in his eyes, he began.\r\nBy the way, the tune was rather a curious one, and you might like to try\r\nit for yourself, so here are the notes.\r\n\r\n{Image...Music for hare-bells}\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Rise, oh, rise!  The daylight dies:\r\n     The owls are hooting, ting, ting, ting!\r\n     Wake, oh, wake!  Beside the lake\r\n     The elves are fluting, ting, ting, ting!\r\n     Welcoming our Fairy King,\r\n     We sing, sing, sing.”\r\n\r\nHe sang the first four lines briskly and merrily, making the hare-bells\r\nchime in time with the music; but the last two he sang quite slowly and\r\ngently, and merely waved the flowers backwards and forwards. Then he\r\nleft off to explain. “The Fairy-King is Oberon, and he lives across the\r\nlake--and sometimes he comes in a little boat--and we go and meet him\r\nand then we sing this song, you know.”\r\n\r\n“And then you go and dine with him?” I said, mischievously.\r\n\r\n“Oo shouldn't talk,” Bruno hastily said: “it interrupts the song so.”\r\n\r\nI said I wouldn't do it again.\r\n\r\n“I never talk myself when I'm singing,” he went on very gravely: “so oo\r\nshouldn't either.” Then he tuned the hare-bells once more, and sang:---\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Hear, oh, hear!  From far and near\r\n    The music stealing, ting, ting, ting!\r\n    Fairy belts adown the dells\r\n    Are merrily pealing, ting, ting, ting!\r\n    Welcoming our Fairy King,\r\n    We ring, ring, ring.\r\n\r\n    “See, oh, see!  On every tree\r\n    What lamps are shining, ting, ting, ting!\r\n    They are eyes of fiery flies\r\n    To light our dining, ting, ting, ting!\r\n    Welcoming our Fairy King\r\n    They swing, swing, swing.\r\n\r\n    “Haste, oh haste, to take and taste\r\n    The dainties waiting, ting, ting, ting!\r\n    Honey-dew is stored--”\r\n\r\n“Hush, Bruno!” I interrupted in a warning whisper. “She's coming!”\r\n\r\nBruno checked his song, and, as she slowly made her way through the\r\nlong grass, he suddenly rushed out headlong at her like a little bull,\r\nshouting “Look the other way! Look the other way!”\r\n\r\n“Which way?” Sylvie asked, in rather a frightened tone, as she looked\r\nround in all directions to see where the danger could be.\r\n\r\n“That way!” said Bruno, carefully turning her round with her face to the\r\nwood. “Now, walk backwards walk gently--don't be frightened: oo sha'n't\r\ntrip!”\r\n\r\nBut Sylvie did trip notwithstanding: in fact he led her, in his hurry,\r\nacross so many little sticks and stones, that it was really a wonder\r\nthe poor child could keep on her feet at all. But he was far too much\r\nexcited to think of what he was doing.\r\n\r\nI silently pointed out to Bruno the best place to lead her to, so as to\r\nget a view of the whole garden at once: it was a little rising ground,\r\nabout the height of a potato; and, when they had mounted it, I drew back\r\ninto the shade, that Sylvie mightn't see me.\r\n\r\nI heard Bruno cry out triumphantly “Now oo may look!” and then followed\r\na clapping of hands, but it was all done by Bruno himself. Sylvie: was\r\nsilent--she only stood and gazed with her hands clasped together, and I\r\nwas half afraid she didn't like it after all.\r\n\r\nBruno too was watching her anxiously, and when she jumped down off the\r\nmound, and began wandering up and down the little walks, he cautiously\r\nfollowed her about, evidently anxious that she should form her own\r\nopinion of it all, without any hint from him. And when at last she drew\r\na long breath, and gave her verdict--in a hurried whisper, and without\r\nthe slightest regard to grammar--“It's the loveliest thing as I never\r\nsaw in all my life before!” the little fellow looked as well pleased\r\nas if it had been given by all the judges and juries in England put\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\n“And did you really do it all by yourself, Bruno?” said Sylvie. “And all\r\nfor me?”\r\n\r\n“I was helped a bit,” Bruno began, with a merry little laugh at her\r\nsurprise. “We've been at it all the afternoon--I thought oo'd like--”\r\n and here the poor little fellow's lip began to quiver, and all in a\r\nmoment he burst out crying, and running up to Sylvie he flung his arms\r\npassionately round her neck, and hid his face on her shoulder.\r\n\r\nThere was a little quiver in Sylvie's voice too, as she whispered “Why,\r\nwhat's the matter, darling?” and tried to lift up his head and kiss him.\r\n\r\nBut Bruno only clung to her, sobbing, and wouldn't be comforted till\r\nhe had confessed. “I tried--to spoil oor garden--first--but I'll\r\nnever--never--” and then came another burst of tears, which drowned the\r\nrest of the sentence. At last he got out the words “I liked--putting in\r\nthe flowers--for oo, Sylvie--and I never was so happy before.” And the\r\nrosy little face came up at last to be kissed, all wet with tears as it\r\nwas.\r\n\r\nSylvie was crying too by this time, and she said nothing but “Bruno,\r\ndear!” and “I never was so happy before,” though why these two children\r\nwho had never been so happy before should both be crying was a mystery\r\nto me.\r\n\r\nI felt very happy too, but of course I didn't cry: “big things” never\r\ndo, you know we leave all that to the Fairies. Only I think it must have\r\nbeen raining a little just then, for I found a drop or two on my cheeks.\r\n\r\nAfter that they went through the whole garden again, flower by flower,\r\nas if it were a long sentence they were spelling out, with kisses for\r\ncommas, and a great hug by way of a full-stop when they got to the end.\r\n\r\n“Doos oo know, that was my river-edge, Sylvie?” Bruno solemnly began.\r\n\r\nSylvie laughed merrily. “What do you mean?” she said. And she pushed\r\nback her heavy brown hair with both hands, and looked at him with\r\ndancing eyes in which the big teardrops were still glittering.\r\n\r\nBruno drew in a long breath, and made up his mouth for a great effort.\r\n“I mean revenge,” he said: “now oo under'tand.” And he looked so happy\r\nand proud at having said the word right at last, that I quite envied\r\nhim. I rather think Sylvie didn't “under'tand” at all; but she gave him\r\na little kiss on each cheek, which seemed to do just as well.\r\n\r\nSo they wandered off lovingly together, in among the buttercups, each\r\nwith an arm twined round the other, whispering and laughing as they\r\nwent, and never so much as once looked back at poor me. Yes, once,\r\njust before I quite lost sight of them, Bruno half turned his head, and\r\nnodded me a saucy little good-bye over one shoulder. And that was all\r\nthe thanks I got for my trouble. The very last thing I saw of them was\r\nthis--Sylvie was stooping down with her arms round Bruno's neck, and\r\nsaying coaxingly in his ear, “Do you know, Bruno, I've quite forgotten\r\nthat hard word. Do say it once more. Come! Only this once, dear!”\r\n\r\nBut Bruno wouldn't try it again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 16. A CHANGED CROCODILE.\r\n\r\nThe Marvellous--the Mysterious--had quite passed out of my life for the\r\nmoment: and the Common-place reigned supreme. I turned in the direction\r\nof the Earl's house, as it was now 'the witching hour' of five, and I\r\nknew I should find them ready for a cup of tea and a quiet chat.\r\n\r\nLady Muriel and her father gave me a delightfully warm welcome. They\r\nwere not of the folk we meet in fashionable drawing-rooms who conceal\r\nall such feelings as they may chance to possess beneath the impenetrable\r\nmask of a conventional placidity. 'The Man with the Iron Mask' was, no\r\ndoubt, a rarity and a marvel in his own age: in modern London no one\r\nwould turn his head to give him a second look! No, these were real\r\npeople. When they looked pleased, it meant that they were pleased: and\r\nwhen Lady Muriel said, with a bright smile, “I'm very glad to see you\r\nagain!”, I knew that it was true.\r\n\r\nStill I did not venture to disobey the injunctions--crazy as I felt\r\nthem to be--of the lovesick young Doctor, by so much as alluding to his\r\nexistence: and it was only after they had given me full details of a\r\nprojected picnic, to which they invited me, that Lady Muriel exclaimed,\r\nalmost as an after-thought, “and do, if you can, bring Doctor Forester\r\nwith you! I'm sure a day in the country would do him good. I'm afraid he\r\nstudies too much--”\r\n\r\nIt was 'on the tip of my tongue' to quote the words “His only books are\r\nwoman's looks!” but I checked myself just in time--with something of the\r\nfeeling of one who has crossed a street, and has been all but run over\r\nby a passing 'Hansom.'\r\n\r\n“--and I think he has too lonely a life,” she went on, with a gentle\r\nearnestness that left no room whatever to suspect a double meaning. “Do\r\nget him to come! And don't forget the day, Tuesday week. We can drive\r\nyou over. It would be a pity to go by rail----there is so much pretty\r\nscenery on the road. And our open carriage just holds four.”\r\n\r\n“Oh, I'll persuade him to come!” I said with confidence--thinking “it\r\nwould take all my powers of persuasion to keep him away!”\r\n\r\nThe picnic was to take place in ten days: and though Arthur readily\r\naccepted the invitation I brought him, nothing that I could say would\r\ninduce him to call--either with me or without me on the Earl and his\r\ndaughter in the meanwhile. No: he feared to “wear out his welcome,” he\r\nsaid: they had “seen enough of him for one while”: and, when at last the\r\nday for the expedition arrived, he was so childishly nervous and\r\nuneasy that I thought it best so to arrange our plans that we should go\r\nseparately to the house--my intention being to arrive some time after\r\nhim, so as to give him time to get over a meeting.\r\n\r\nWith this object I purposely made a considerable circuit on my way to\r\nthe Hall (as we called the Earl's house): “and if I could only manage to\r\nlose my way a bit,” I thought to myself, “that would suit me capitally!”\r\n\r\nIn this I succeeded better, and sooner, than I had ventured to hope\r\nfor. The path through the wood had been made familiar to me, by many a\r\nsolitary stroll, in my former visit to Elveston; and how I could have\r\nso suddenly and so entirely lost it--even though I was so engrossed in\r\nthinking of Arthur and his lady-love that I heeded little else--was a\r\nmystery to me. “And this open place,” I said to myself, “seems to have\r\nsome memory about it I cannot distinctly recall--surely it is the very\r\nspot where I saw those Fairy-Children! But I hope there are no snakes\r\nabout!” I mused aloud, taking my seat on a fallen tree. “I certainly do\r\nnot like snakes--and I don't suppose Bruno likes them, either!”\r\n\r\n“No, he doesn't like them!” said a demure little voice at my side. “He's\r\nnot afraid of them, you know. But he doesn't like them. He says they're\r\ntoo waggly!”\r\n\r\nWords fail me to describe the beauty of the little group--couched on a\r\npatch of moss, on the trunk of the fallen tree, that met my eager gaze:\r\nSylvie reclining with her elbow buried in the moss, and her rosy cheek\r\nresting in the palm of her hand, and Bruno stretched at her feet with\r\nhis head in her lap.\r\n\r\n{Image...Fairies resting}\r\n\r\n“Too waggly?” was all I could say in so sudden an emergency.\r\n\r\n“I'm not praticular,” Bruno said, carelessly: “but I do like straight\r\nanimals best--”\r\n\r\n“But you like a dog when it wags its tail,” Sylvie interrupted. “You\r\nknow you do, Bruno!”\r\n\r\n“But there's more of a dog, isn't there, Mister Sir?” Bruno appealed to\r\nme. “You wouldn't like to have a dog if it hadn't got nuffin but a head\r\nand a tail?”\r\n\r\nI admitted that a dog of that kind would be uninteresting.\r\n\r\n“There isn't such a dog as that,” Sylvie thoughtfully remarked.\r\n\r\n“But there would be,” cried Bruno, “if the Professor shortened it up for\r\nus!”\r\n\r\n“Shortened it up?” I said. “That's something new. How does he do it?”\r\n\r\n“He's got a curious machine,” Sylvie was beginning to explain.\r\n\r\n“A welly curious machine,” Bruno broke in, not at all willing to\r\nhave the story thus taken out of his mouth, “and if oo puts\r\nin--some-finoruvver--at one end, oo know and he turns the handle--and it\r\ncomes out at the uvver end, oh, ever so short!”\r\n\r\n“As short as short!” Sylvie echoed.\r\n\r\n“And one day when we was in Outland, oo know--before we came to\r\nFairyland me and Sylvie took him a big Crocodile. And he shortened it up\r\nfor us. And it did look so funny! And it kept looking round, and saying\r\n'wherever is the rest of me got to?' And then its eyes looked unhappy--”\r\n\r\n“Not both its eyes,” Sylvie interrupted.\r\n\r\n“Course not!” said the little fellow. “Only the eye that couldn't\r\nsee wherever the rest of it had got to. But the eye that could see\r\nwherever--”\r\n\r\n“How short was the crocodile?” I asked, as the story was getting a\r\nlittle complicated.\r\n\r\n“Half as short again as when we caught it--so long,” said Bruno,\r\nspreading out his arms to their full stretch.\r\n\r\nI tried to calculate what this would come to, but it was too hard for\r\nme. Please make it out for me, dear Child who reads this!\r\n\r\n“But you didn't leave the poor thing so short as that, did you?”\r\n\r\n“Well, no. Sylvie and me took it back again and we got it stretched\r\nto--to--how much was it, Sylvie?”\r\n\r\n“Two times and a half, and a little bit more,” said Sylvie.\r\n\r\n“It wouldn't like that better than the other way, I'm afraid?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, but it did though!” Bruno put in eagerly. “It were proud of its new\r\ntail! Oo never saw a Crocodile so proud! Why, it could go round and walk\r\non the top of its tail, and along its back, all the way to its head!”\r\n\r\n{Image...A changed crocodile}\r\n\r\n“Not quite all the way,” said Sylvie. “It couldn't, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, but it did, once!” Bruno cried triumphantly. “Oo weren't\r\nlooking--but I watched it. And it walked on tippiety-toe, so as it\r\nwouldn't wake itself, 'cause it thought it were asleep. And it got both\r\nits paws on its tail. And it walked and it walked all the way along its\r\nback. And it walked and it walked on its forehead. And it walked a tiny\r\nlittle way down its nose! There now!”\r\n\r\nThis was a good deal worse than the last puzzle. Please, dear Child,\r\nhelp again!\r\n\r\n“I don't believe no Crocodile never walked along its own forehead!”\r\n Sylvie cried, too much excited by the controversy to limit the number of\r\nher negatives.\r\n\r\n“Oo don't know the reason why it did it!” Bruno scornfully retorted. “It\r\nhad a welly good reason. I heerd it say 'Why shouldn't I walk on my own\r\nforehead?' So a course it did, oo know!”\r\n\r\n“If that's a good reason, Bruno,” I said, “why shouldn't you get up that\r\ntree?”\r\n\r\n“Shall, in a minute,” said Bruno: “soon as we've done talking. Only two\r\npeoples ca'n't talk comfably togevver, when one's getting up a tree, and\r\nthe other isn't!”\r\n\r\nIt appeared to me that a conversation would scarcely be 'comfable' while\r\ntrees were being climbed, even if both the 'peoples' were doing it: but\r\nit was evidently dangerous to oppose any theory of Bruno's; so I thought\r\nit best to let the question drop, and to ask for an account of the\r\nmachine that made things longer.\r\n\r\nThis time Bruno was at a loss, and left it to Sylvie. “It's like a\r\nmangle,” she said: “if things are put in, they get squoze--”\r\n\r\n“Squeezeled!” Bruno interrupted.\r\n\r\n“Yes.” Sylvie accepted the correction, but did not attempt to pronounce\r\nthe word, which was evidently new to her. “They get--like that--and they\r\ncome out, oh, ever so long!”\r\n\r\n“Once,” Bruno began again, “Sylvie and me writed--”\r\n\r\n“Wrote!” Sylvie whispered.\r\n\r\n“Well, we wroted a Nursery-Song, and the Professor mangled it longer for\r\nus. It were 'There was a little Man, And he had a little gun, And the\r\nbullets--'”\r\n\r\n“I know the rest,” I interrupted. “But would you say it long I mean the\r\nway that it came out of the mangle?”\r\n\r\n“We'll get the Professor to sing it for you,” said Sylvie. “It would\r\nspoil it to say it.”\r\n\r\n“I would like to meet the Professor,” I said. “And I would like to take\r\nyou all with me, to see some friends of mine, that live near here. Would\r\nyou like to come?”\r\n\r\n“I don't think the Professor would like to come,” said Sylvie. “He's\r\nvery shy. But we'd like it very much. Only we'd better not come this\r\nsize, you know.”\r\n\r\nThe difficulty had occurred to me already: and I had felt that perhaps\r\nthere would be a slight awkwardness in introducing two such tiny friends\r\ninto Society. “What size will you be?” I enquired.\r\n\r\n“We'd better come as--common children,” Sylvie thoughtfully replied.\r\n“That's the easiest size to manage.”\r\n\r\n“Could you come to-day?” I said, thinking “then we could have you at the\r\npicnic!”\r\n\r\nSylvie considered a little. “Not to-day,” she replied. “We haven't got\r\nthe things ready. We'll come on--Tuesday next, if you like. And now,\r\nreally Bruno, you must come and do your lessons.”\r\n\r\n“I wiss oo wouldn't say 'really Bruno!'” the little fellow pleaded, with\r\npouting lips that made him look prettier than ever. “It always show's\r\nthere's something horrid coming! And I won't kiss you, if you're so\r\nunkind.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, but you have kissed me!” Sylvie exclaimed in merry triumph.\r\n\r\n“Well then, I'll unkiss you!” And he threw his arms round her neck for\r\nthis novel, but apparently not very painful, operation.\r\n\r\n“It's very like kissing!” Sylvie remarked, as soon as her lips were\r\nagain free for speech.\r\n\r\n“Oo don't know nuffin about it! It were just the conkery!” Bruno replied\r\nwith much severity, as he marched away.\r\n\r\nSylvie turned her laughing face to me. “Shall we come on Tuesday?” she\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n“Very well,” I said: “let it be Tuesday next. But where is the\r\nProfessor? Did he come with you to Fairyland?”\r\n\r\n“No,” said Sylvie. “But he promised he'd come and see us, some day. He's\r\ngetting his Lecture ready. So he has to stay at home.”\r\n\r\n“At home?” I said dreamily, not feeling quite sure what she had said.\r\n\r\n“Yes, Sir. His Lordship and Lady Muriel are at home. Please to walk this\r\nway.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 17. THE THREE BADGERS.\r\n\r\nStill more dreamily I found myself following this imperious voice into\r\na room where the Earl, his daughter, and Arthur, were seated. “So you're\r\ncome at last!” said Lady Muriel, in a tone of playful reproach.\r\n\r\n“I was delayed,” I stammered. Though what it was that had delayed me I\r\nshould have been puzzled to explain! Luckily no questions were asked.\r\n\r\nThe carriage was ordered round, the hamper, containing our contribution\r\nto the Picnic, was duly stowed away, and we set forth.\r\n\r\nThere was no need for me to maintain the conversation. Lady Muriel and\r\nArthur were evidently on those most delightful of terms, where one has\r\nno need to check thought after thought, as it rises to the lips, with\r\nthe fear 'this will not be appreciated--this will give' offence--this\r\nwill sound too serious--this will sound flippant': like very old\r\nfriends, in fullest sympathy, their talk rippled on.\r\n\r\n“Why shouldn't we desert the Picnic and go in some other direction?” she\r\nsuddenly suggested. “A party of four is surely self-sufficing? And as\r\nfor food, our hamper--”\r\n\r\n“Why shouldn't we? What a genuine lady's argument!” laughed Arthur.\r\n“A lady never knows on which side the onus probandi--the burden of\r\nproving--lies!”\r\n\r\n“Do men always know?” she asked with a pretty assumption of meek\r\ndocility.\r\n\r\n“With one exception--the only one I can think of Dr. Watts, who has\r\nasked the senseless question,\r\n\r\n\r\n    'Why should I deprive my neighbour\r\n    Of his goods against his will?'\r\n\r\nFancy that as an argument for Honesty! His position seems to be 'I'm\r\nonly honest because I see no reason to steal.' And the thief's answer\r\nis of course complete and crushing. 'I deprive my neighbour of his goods\r\nbecause I want them myself. And I do it against his will because there's\r\nno chance of getting him to consent to it!'”\r\n\r\n“I can give you one other exception,” I said: “an argument I heard only\r\nto-day---and not by a lady. 'Why shouldn't I walk on my own forehead?'”\r\n\r\n“What a curious subject for speculation!” said Lady Muriel, turning to\r\nme, with eyes brimming over with laughter. “May we know who propounded\r\nthe question? And did he walk on his own forehead?”\r\n\r\n“I ca'n't remember who it was that said it!” I faltered. “Nor where I\r\nheard it!”\r\n\r\n“Whoever it was, I hope we shall meet him at the Picnic!” said Lady\r\nMuriel. “It's a far more interesting question than 'Isn't this a\r\npicturesque ruin?' Aren't those autumn-tints lovely?' I shall have to\r\nanswer those two questions ten times, at least, this afternoon!”\r\n\r\n“That's one of the miseries of Society!” said Arthur. “Why ca'n't people\r\nlet one enjoy the beauties of Nature without having to say so every\r\nminute? Why should Life be one long Catechism?”\r\n\r\n“It's just as bad at a picture-gallery,” the Earl remarked. “I went to\r\nthe R.A. last May, with a conceited young artist: and he did torment me!\r\nI wouldn't have minded his criticizing the pictures himself: but I had\r\nto agree with him--or else to argue the point, which would have been\r\nworse!”\r\n\r\n“It was depreciatory criticism, of course?” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“I don't see the 'of course' at all.”\r\n\r\n“Why, did you ever know a conceited man dare to praise a picture?\r\nThe one thing he dreads (next to not being noticed) is to be proved\r\nfallible! If you once praise a picture, your character for infallibility\r\nhangs by a thread. Suppose it's a figure-picture, and you venture to say\r\n'draws well.' Somebody measures it, and finds one of the proportions an\r\neighth of an inch wrong. You are disposed of as a critic! 'Did you say\r\nhe draws well?' your friends enquire sarcastically, while you hang your\r\nhead and blush. No. The only safe course, if any one says 'draws well,'\r\nis to shrug your shoulders. 'Draws well?' you repeat thoughtfully.\r\n'Draws well? Humph!' That's the way to become a great critic!”\r\n\r\nThus airily chatting, after a pleasant drive through a few miles of\r\nbeautiful scenery, we reached the rendezvous--a ruined castle--where the\r\nrest of the picnic-party were already assembled. We spent an hour or\r\ntwo in sauntering about the ruins: gathering at last, by common consent,\r\ninto a few random groups, seated on the side of a mound, which commanded\r\na good view of the old castle and its surroundings.\r\n\r\nThe momentary silence, that ensued, was promptly taken possession of or,\r\nmore correctly, taken into custody--by a Voice; a voice so smooth, so\r\nmonotonous, so sonorous, that one felt, with a shudder, that any other\r\nconversation was precluded, and that, unless some desperate remedy were\r\nadopted, we were fated to listen to a Lecture, of which no man could\r\nforesee the end!\r\n\r\nThe speaker was a broadly-built man, whose large, flat, pale face was\r\nbounded on the North by a fringe of hair, on the East and West by a\r\nfringe of whisker, and on the South by a fringe of beard--the whole\r\nconstituting a uniform halo of stubbly whitey-brown bristles. His\r\nfeatures were so entirely destitute of expression that I could not\r\nhelp saying to myself--helplessly, as if in the clutches of a\r\nnight-mare--“they are only penciled in: no final touches as yet!” And\r\nhe had a way of ending every sentence with a sudden smile, which spread\r\nlike a ripple over that vast blank surface, and was gone in a moment,\r\nleaving behind it such absolute solemnity that I felt impelled to murmur\r\n“it was not he: it was somebody else that smiled!”\r\n\r\n“Do you observe?” (such was the phrase with which the wretch began each\r\nsentence) “Do you observe the way in which that broken arch, at the very\r\ntop of the ruin, stands out against the clear sky? It is placed exactly\r\nright: and there is exactly enough of it. A little more, or a little\r\nless, and all would be utterly spoiled!”\r\n\r\n{Image...A lecture, on art}\r\n\r\n“Oh gifted architect!” murmured Arthur, inaudibly to all but Lady Muriel\r\nand myself. “Foreseeing the exact effect his work would have, when in\r\nruins, centuries after his death!”\r\n\r\n“And do you observe, where those trees slope down the hill,” (indicating\r\nthem with a sweep of the hand, and with all the patronising air of the\r\nman who has himself arranged the landscape), “how the mists rising from\r\nthe river fill up exactly those intervals where we need indistinctness,\r\nfor artistic effect? Here, in the foreground, a few clear touches\r\nare not amiss: but a back-ground without mist, you know! It is simply\r\nbarbarous! Yes, we need indistinctness!”\r\n\r\nThe orator looked so pointedly at me as he uttered these words, that I\r\nfelt bound to reply, by murmuring something to the effect that I hardly\r\nfelt the need myself--and that I enjoyed looking at a thing, better,\r\nwhen I could see it.\r\n\r\n“Quite so!” the great man sharply took me up. “From your point of view,\r\nthat is correctly put. But for anyone who has a soul for Art, such a\r\nview is preposterous. Nature is one thing. Art is another. Nature shows\r\nus the world as it is. But Art--as a Latin author tells us--Art, you\r\nknow the words have escaped my memory--”\r\n\r\n“Ars est celare Naturam,” Arthur interposed with a delightful\r\npromptitude.\r\n\r\n“Quite so!” the orator replied with an air of relief. “I thank you! Ars\r\nest celare Naturam but that isn't it.” And, for a few peaceful moments,\r\nthe orator brooded, frowningly, over the quotation. The welcome\r\nopportunity was seized, and another voice struck into the silence.\r\n\r\n“What a lovely old ruin it is!” cried a young lady in spectacles, the\r\nvery embodiment of the March of Mind, looking at Lady Muriel, as the\r\nproper recipient of all really original remarks. “And don't you admire\r\nthose autumn-tints on the trees? I do, intensely!”\r\n\r\nLady Muriel shot a meaning glance at me; but replied with admirable\r\ngravity. “Oh yes indeed, indeed! So true!”\r\n\r\n“And isn't strange,” said the young lady, passing with startling\r\nsuddenness from Sentiment to Science, “that the mere impact of certain\r\ncoloured rays upon the Retina should give us such exquisite pleasure?”\r\n\r\n“You have studied Physiology, then?” a certain young Doctor courteously\r\nenquired.\r\n\r\n“Oh, yes! Isn't it a sweet Science?”\r\n\r\nArthur slightly smiled. “It seems a paradox, does it not,” he went on,\r\n“that the image formed on the Retina should be inverted?”\r\n\r\n“It is puzzling,” she candidly admitted. “Why is it we do not see things\r\nupside-down?”\r\n\r\n“You have never heard the Theory, then, that the Brain also is\r\ninverted?”\r\n\r\n“No indeed! What a beautiful fact! But how is it proved?”\r\n\r\n“Thus,” replied Arthur, with all the gravity of ten Professors rolled\r\ninto one. “What we call the vertex of the Brain is really its base: and\r\nwhat we call its base is really its vertex: it is simply a question of\r\nnomenclature.”\r\n\r\nThis last polysyllable settled the matter.\r\n\r\n“How truly delightful!” the fair Scientist exclaimed with enthusiasm. “I\r\nshall ask our Physiological Lecturer why he never gave us that exquisite\r\nTheory!”\r\n\r\n“I'd give something to be present when the question is asked!” Arthur\r\nwhispered to me, as, at a signal from Lady Muriel, we moved on to\r\nwhere the hampers had been collected, and devoted ourselves to the more\r\nsubstantial business of the day.\r\n\r\nWe 'waited' on ourselves, as the modern barbarism (combining two good\r\nthings in such a way as to secure the discomforts of both and the\r\nadvantages of neither) of having a picnic with servants to wait upon\r\nyou, had not yet reached this out-of-the-way region--and of course the\r\ngentlemen did not even take their places until the ladies had been duly\r\nprovided with all imaginable creature-comforts. Then I supplied myself\r\nwith a plate of something solid and a glass of something fluid, and\r\nfound a place next to Lady Muriel.\r\n\r\nIt had been left vacant--apparently for Arthur, as a distinguished\r\nstranger: but he had turned shy, and had placed himself next to the\r\nyoung lady in spectacles, whose high rasping voice had already\r\ncast loose upon Society such ominous phrases as “Man is a bundle of\r\nQualities!”, “the Objective is only attainable through the Subjective!”.\r\nArthur was bearing it bravely: but several faces wore a look of alarm,\r\nand I thought it high time to start some less metaphysical topic.\r\n\r\n“In my nursery days,” I began, “when the weather didn't suit for an\r\nout-of-doors picnic, we were allowed to have a peculiar kind, that we\r\nenjoyed hugely. The table cloth was laid under the table, instead of\r\nupon it: we sat round it on the floor: and I believe we really enjoyed\r\nthat extremely uncomfortable kind of dinner more than we ever did the\r\northodox arrangement!”\r\n\r\n“I've no doubt of it,” Lady Muriel replied. “There's nothing a\r\nwell-regulated child hates so much as regularity. I believe a really\r\nhealthy boy would thoroughly enjoy Greek Grammar--if only he might stand\r\non his head to learn it! And your carpet-dinner certainly spared you one\r\nfeature of a picnic, which is to me its chief drawback.”\r\n\r\n“The chance of a shower?” I suggested.\r\n\r\n“No, the chance--or rather the certainty of live things occurring in\r\ncombination with one's food! Spiders are my bugbear. Now my father\r\nhas no sympathy with that sentiment--have you, dear?” For the Earl had\r\ncaught the word and turned to listen.\r\n\r\n“To each his sufferings, all are men,” he replied in the sweet sad tones\r\nthat seemed natural to him: “each has his pet aversion.”\r\n\r\n“But you'll never guess his!” Lady Muriel said, with that delicate\r\nsilvery laugh that was music to my ears.\r\n\r\nI declined to attempt the impossible.\r\n\r\n“He doesn't like snakes!” she said, in a stage whisper. “Now, isn't\r\nthat an unreasonable aversion? Fancy not liking such a dear, coaxingly,\r\nclingingly affectionate creature as a snake!”\r\n\r\n“Not like snakes!” I exclaimed. “Is such a thing possible?”\r\n\r\n“No, he doesn't like them,” she repeated with a pretty mock-gravity.\r\n“He's not afraid of them, you know. But he doesn't like them. He says\r\nthey're too waggly!”\r\n\r\nI was more startled than I liked to show. There was something so uncanny\r\nin this echo of the very words I had so lately heard from that little\r\nforest-sprite, that it was only by a great effort I succeeded in saying,\r\ncarelessly, “Let us banish so unpleasant a topic. Won't you sing us\r\nsomething, Lady Muriel? I know you do sing without music.”\r\n\r\n“The only songs I know--without music--are desperately sentimental, I'm\r\nafraid! Are your tears all ready?”\r\n\r\n“Quite ready! Quite ready!” came from all sides, and Lady Muriel--not\r\nbeing one of those lady-singers who think it de rigueur to decline\r\nto sing till they have been petitioned three or four times, and have\r\npleaded failure of memory, loss of voice, and other conclusive reasons\r\nfor silence--began at once:--\r\n\r\n{Image...'Three badgers on a mossy stone'}\r\n\r\n\r\n     “There be three Badgers on a mossy stone,\r\n     Beside a dark and covered way:\r\n     Each dreams himself a monarch on his throne,\r\n     And so they stay and stay\r\n     Though their old Father languishes alone,\r\n     They stay, and stay, and stay.\r\n\r\n     “There be three Herrings loitering around,\r\n     Longing to share that mossy seat:\r\n     Each Herring tries to sing what she has found\r\n     That makes Life seem so sweet.\r\n     Thus, with a grating and uncertain sound,\r\n     They bleat, and bleat, and bleat,\r\n\r\n     “The Mother-Herring, on the salt sea-wave,\r\n     Sought vainly for her absent ones:\r\n     The Father-Badger, writhing in a cave,\r\n     Shrieked out 'Return, my sons!\r\n     You shalt have buns,' he shrieked, 'if you'll behave!\r\n     Yea, buns, and buns, and buns!'\r\n\r\n     “'I fear,' said she, 'your sons have gone astray?\r\n     My daughters left me while I slept.'\r\n     'Yes 'm,' the Badger said: 'it's as you say.'\r\n     'They should be better kept.'\r\n     Thus the poor parents talked the time away,\r\n     And wept, and wept, and wept.”\r\n\r\nHere Bruno broke off suddenly. “The Herrings' Song wants anuvver tune,\r\nSylvie,” he said. “And I ca'n't sing it not wizout oo plays it for me!”\r\n\r\n{Image...'Three badgers, writhing in a cave'}\r\n\r\nInstantly Sylvie seated herself upon a tiny mushroom, that happened\r\nto grow in front of a daisy, as if it were the most ordinary musical\r\ninstrument in the world, and played on the petals as if they were the\r\nnotes of an organ. And such delicious tiny music it was! Such teeny-tiny\r\nmusic!\r\n\r\nBruno held his head on one side, and listened very gravely for a few\r\nmoments until he had caught the melody. Then the sweet childish voice\r\nrang out once more:--\r\n\r\n\r\n     “Oh, dear beyond our dearest dreams,\r\n     Fairer than all that fairest seems!\r\n     To feast the rosy hours away,\r\n     To revel in a roundelay!\r\n     How blest would be\r\n     A life so free---\r\n     Ipwergis-Pudding to consume,\r\n     And drink the subtle Azzigoom!\r\n\r\n     “And if in other days and hours,\r\n     Mid other fluffs and other flowers,\r\n     The choice were given me how to dine---\r\n     'Name what thou wilt: it shalt be thine!'\r\n     Oh, then I see\r\n     The life for me\r\n     Ipwergis-Pudding to consume,\r\n     And drink the subtle Azzigoom!”\r\n\r\n“Oo may leave off playing now, Sylvie. I can do the uvver tune much\r\nbetter wizout a compliment.”\r\n\r\n“He means 'without accompaniment,'” Sylvie whispered, smiling at my\r\npuzzled look: and she pretended to shut up the stops of the organ.\r\n\r\n\r\n    “The Badgers did not care to talk to Fish:\r\n    They did not dote on Herrings' songs:\r\n    They never had experienced the dish\r\n    To which that name belongs:\r\n    And oh, to pinch their tails,' (this was their wish,)\r\n    'With tongs, yea, tongs, and tongs!'”\r\n\r\nI ought to mention that he marked the parenthesis, in the air, with his\r\nfinger. It seemed to me a very good plan. You know there's no sound to\r\nrepresent it--any more than there is for a question.\r\n\r\nSuppose you have said to your friend “You are better to-day,” and that\r\nyou want him to understand that you are asking him a question, what\r\ncan be simpler than just to make a “?”. in the air with your finger? He\r\nwould understand you in a moment!\r\n\r\n{Image...'Those aged one waxed gay'}\r\n\r\n\r\n     “'And are not these the Fish,' the Eldest sighed,\r\n     'Whose Mother dwells beneath the foam'\r\n     'They are the Fish!' the Second one replied.\r\n     'And they have left their home!'\r\n     'Oh wicked Fish,' the Youngest Badger cried,\r\n     'To roam, yea, roam, and roam!'\r\n     “Gently the Badgers trotted to the shore\r\n     The sandy shore that fringed the bay:\r\n     Each in his mouth a living Herring bore--\r\n     Those aged ones waxed gay:\r\n     Clear rang their voices through the ocean's roar,\r\n     'Hooray, hooray, hooray!'”\r\n\r\n“So they all got safe home again,” Bruno said, after waiting a minute to\r\nsee if I had anything to say: he evidently felt that some remark ought\r\nto be made. And I couldn't help wishing there were some such rule in\r\nSociety, at the conclusion of a song--that the singer herself should say\r\nthe right thing, and not leave it to the audience. Suppose a young lady\r\nhas just been warbling ['with a grating and uncertain sound') Shelley's\r\nexquisite lyric 'I arise from dreams of thee': how much nicer it would\r\nbe, instead of your having to say “Oh, thank you, thank you!” for the\r\nyoung lady herself to remark, as she draws on her gloves, while the\r\nimpassioned words 'Oh, press it to thine own, or it will break at last!'\r\nare still ringing in your ears, “--but she wouldn't do it, you know. So\r\nit did break at last.”\r\n\r\n“And I knew it would!” she added quietly, as I started at the sudden\r\ncrash of broken glass. “You've been holding it sideways for the last\r\nminute, and letting all the champagne run out! Were you asleep, I\r\nwonder? I'm so sorry my singing has such a narcotic effect!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 18. QUEER STREET, NUMBER FORTY.\r\n\r\nLady Muriel was the speaker. And, for the moment, that was the only fact\r\nI could clearly realise. But how she came to be there and how I came\r\nto be there--and how the glass of champagne came to be there--all these\r\nwere questions which I felt it better to think out in silence, and not\r\ncommit myself to any statement till I understood things a little more\r\nclearly.\r\n\r\n'First accumulate a mass of Facts: and then construct a Theory.' That,\r\nI believe, is the true Scientific Method. I sat up, rubbed my eyes, and\r\nbegan to accumulate Facts.\r\n\r\nA smooth grassy slope, bounded, at the upper end, by venerable ruins\r\nhalf buried in ivy, at the lower, by a stream seen through arching\r\ntrees--a dozen gaily-dressed people, seated in little groups here and\r\nthere--some open hampers--the debris of a picnic--such were the\r\nFacts accumulated by the Scientific Researcher. And now, what deep,\r\nfar-reaching Theory was he to construct from them? The Researcher found\r\nhimself at fault. Yet stay! One Fact had escaped his notice. While all\r\nthe rest were grouped in twos and in threes, Arthur was alone: while all\r\ntongues were talking, his was silent: while all faces were gay, his was\r\ngloomy and despondent. Here was a Fact indeed! The Researcher felt that\r\na Theory must be constructed without delay.\r\n\r\nLady Muriel had just risen and left the party. Could that be the cause\r\nof his despondency? The Theory hardly rose to the dignity of a Working\r\nHypothesis. Clearly more Facts were needed.\r\n\r\nThe Researcher looked round him once more: and now the Facts accumulated\r\nin such bewildering profusion, that the Theory was lost among them. For\r\nLady Muriel had gone to meet a strange gentleman, just visible in the\r\ndistance: and now she was returning with him, both of them talking\r\neagerly and joyfully, like old friends who have been long parted: and\r\nnow she was moving from group to group, introducing the new hero of the\r\nhour: and he, young, tall, and handsome, moved gracefully at her side,\r\nwith the erect bearing and firm tread of a soldier. Verily, the Theory\r\nlooked gloomy for Arthur! His eye caught mine, and he crossed to me.\r\n\r\n“He is very handsome,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Abominably handsome!” muttered Arthur: then smiled at his own bitter\r\nwords. “Lucky no one heard me but you!”\r\n\r\n“Doctor Forester,” said Lady Muriel, who had just joined us, “let me\r\nintroduce to you my cousin Eric Lindon Captain Lindon, I should say.”\r\n\r\nArthur shook off his ill-temper instantly and completely, as he rose and\r\ngave the young soldier his hand. “I have heard of you,” he said. “I'm\r\nvery glad to make the acquaintance of Lady Muriel's cousin.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, that's all I'm distinguished for, as yet!” said Eric (so we soon\r\ngot to call him) with a winning smile. “And I doubt,” glancing at Lady\r\nMuriel, “if it even amounts to a good-conduct-badge! But it's something\r\nto begin with.”\r\n\r\n“You must come to my father, Eric,” said Lady Muriel. “I think he's\r\nwandering among the ruins.” And the pair moved on.\r\n\r\nThe gloomy look returned to Arthur's face: and I could see it was only\r\nto distract his thoughts that he took his place at the side of the\r\nmetaphysical young lady, and resumed their interrupted discussion.\r\n\r\n“Talking of Herbert Spencer,” he began, “do you really find no logical\r\ndifficulty in regarding Nature as a process of involution, passing from\r\ndefinite coherent homogeneity to indefinite incoherent heterogeneity?”\r\n\r\nAmused as I was at the ingenious jumble he had made of Spencer's words,\r\nI kept as grave a face as I could.\r\n\r\n“No physical difficulty,” she confidently replied: “but I haven't\r\nstudied Logic much. Would you state the difficulty?”\r\n\r\n“Well,” said Arthur, “do you accept it as self-evident? Is it as\r\nobvious, for instance, as that 'things that are greater than the same\r\nare greater than one another'?”\r\n\r\n“To my mind,” she modestly replied, “it seems quite as obvious. I grasp\r\nboth truths by intuition. But other minds may need some logical--I\r\nforget the technical terms.”\r\n\r\n“For a complete logical argument,” Arthur began with admirable\r\nsolemnity, “we need two prim Misses--”\r\n\r\n“Of course!” she interrupted. “I remember that word now. And they\r\nproduce--?”\r\n\r\n“A Delusion,” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“Ye--es?” she said dubiously. “I don't seem to remember that so well.\r\nBut what is the whole argument called?”\r\n\r\n“A Sillygism?\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes! I remember now. But I don't need a Sillygism, you know, to\r\nprove that mathematical axiom you mentioned.”\r\n\r\n“Nor to prove that 'all angles are equal', I suppose?”\r\n\r\n“Why, of course not! One takes such a simple truth as that for granted!”\r\n\r\nHere I ventured to interpose, and to offer her a plate of strawberries\r\nand cream. I felt really uneasy at the thought that she might detect the\r\ntrick: and I contrived, unperceived by her, to shake my head reprovingly\r\nat the pseudo-philosopher. Equally unperceived by her, Arthur slightly\r\nraised his shoulders, and spread his hands abroad, as who should say\r\n“What else can I say to her?” and moved away, leaving her to discuss her\r\nstrawberries by 'involution,' or any other way she preferred.\r\n\r\nBy this time the carriages, that were to convey the revelers to their\r\nrespective homes, had begun to assemble outside the Castle-grounds: and\r\nit became evident--now that Lady Muriel's cousin had joined our party\r\nthat the problem, how to convey five people to Elveston, with a carriage\r\nthat would only hold four, must somehow be solved.\r\n\r\nThe Honorable Eric Lindon, who was at this moment walking up and down\r\nwith Lady Muriel, might have solved it at once, no doubt, by announcing\r\nhis intention of returning on foot. Of this solution there did not seem\r\nto be the very smallest probability.\r\n\r\nThe next best solution, it seemed to me, was that I should walk home:\r\nand this I at once proposed.\r\n\r\n“You're sure you don't mind?” said the Earl. “I'm afraid the carriage\r\nwont take us all, and I don't like to suggest to Eric to desert his\r\ncousin so soon.”\r\n\r\n“So far from minding it,” I said, “I should prefer it. It will give me\r\ntime to sketch this beautiful old ruin.”\r\n\r\n“I'll keep you company,” Arthur suddenly said. And, in answer to what\r\nI suppose was a look of surprise on my face, he said in a low voice, “I\r\nreally would rather. I shall be quite de trop in the carriage!”\r\n\r\n“I think I'll walk too,” said the Earl. “You'll have to be content with\r\nEric as your escort,” he added, to Lady Muriel, who had joined us while\r\nhe was speaking.\r\n\r\n“You must be as entertaining as Cerberus--'three gentlemen rolled into\r\none'--” Lady Muriel said to her companion. “It will be a grand military\r\nexploit!”\r\n\r\n“A sort of Forlorn Hope?” the Captain modestly suggested.\r\n\r\n“You do pay pretty compliments!” laughed his fair cousin. “Good day to\r\nyou, gentlemen three--or rather deserters three!” And the two young folk\r\nentered the carriage and were driven away.\r\n\r\n“How long will your sketch take?” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“Well,” I said, “I should like an hour for it. Don't you think you had\r\nbetter go without me? I'll return by train. I know there's one in about\r\nan hour's time.”\r\n\r\n“Perhaps that would be best,” said the Earl. “The Station is quite\r\nclose.”\r\n\r\nSo I was left to my own devices, and soon found a comfortable seat, at\r\nthe foot of a tree, from which I had a good view of the ruins.\r\n\r\n“It is a very drowsy day,” I said to myself, idly turning over the\r\nleaves of the sketch-book to find a blank page. “Why, I thought you were\r\na mile off by this time!” For, to my surprise, the two walkers were back\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n“I came back to remind you,” Arthur said, “that the trains go every ten\r\nminutes--”\r\n\r\n“Nonsense!” I said. “It isn't the Metropolitan Railway!”\r\n\r\n“It is the Metropolitan Railway,” the Earl insisted. “'This is a part of\r\nKensington.”\r\n\r\n“Why do you talk with your eyes shut?” said Arthur. “Wake up!”\r\n\r\n“I think it's the heat makes me so drowsy,” I said, hoping, but not\r\nfeeling quite sure, that I was talking sense. “Am I awake now?”\r\n\r\n“I think not,” the Earl judicially pronounced. “What do you think,\r\nDoctor? He's only got one eye open!”\r\n\r\n“And he's snoring like anything!” cried Bruno. “Do wake up, you dear old\r\nthing!” And he and Sylvie set to work, rolling the heavy head from side\r\nto side, as if its connection with the shoulders was a matter of no sort\r\nof importance.\r\n\r\nAnd at last the Professor opened his eyes, and sat up, blinking at\r\nus with eyes of utter bewilderment. “Would you have the kindness to\r\nmention,” he said, addressing me with his usual old-fashioned courtesy,\r\n“whereabouts we are just now and who we are, beginning with me?”\r\n\r\nI thought it best to begin with the children. “This is Sylvie. Sir; and\r\nthis is Bruno.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, yes! I know them well enough!” the old man murmured. “Its myself\r\nI'm most anxious about. And perhaps you'll be good enough to mention, at\r\nthe same time, how I got here?”\r\n\r\n“A harder problem occurs to me,” I ventured to say: “and that is, how\r\nyou're to get back again.”\r\n\r\n“True, true!” the Professor replied. “That's the Problem, no doubt.\r\nViewed as a Problem, outside of oneself, it is a most interesting one.\r\nViewed as a portion of one's own biography, it is, I must admit, very\r\ndistressing!” He groaned, but instantly added, with a chuckle, “As to\r\nmyself, I think you mentioned that I am--”\r\n\r\n“Oo're the Professor!” Bruno shouted in his ear. “Didn't oo know that?\r\nOo've come from Outland! And it's ever so far away from here!”\r\n\r\nThe Professor leapt to his feet with the agility of a boy. “Then there's\r\nno time to lose!” he exclaimed anxiously. “I'll just ask this guileless\r\npeasant, with his brace of buckets that contain (apparently) water, if\r\nhe'll be so kind as to direct us. Guileless peasant!” he proceeded in a\r\nlouder voice. “Would you tell us the way to Outland?”\r\n\r\nThe guileless peasant turned with a sheepish grin. “Hey?” was all he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\n“The way--to--Outland!” the Professor repeated.\r\n\r\nThe guileless peasant set down his buckets and considered. “Ah dunnot--”\r\n\r\n“I ought to mention,” the Professor hastily put in, “that whatever you\r\nsay will be used in evidence against you.”\r\n\r\nThe guileless peasant instantly resumed his buckets. “Then ah says\r\nnowt!” he answered briskly, and walked away at a great pace.\r\n\r\nThe children gazed sadly at the rapidly vanishing figure. “He goes very\r\nquick!” the Professor said with a sigh. “But I know that was the right\r\nthing to say. I've studied your English Laws. However, let's ask\r\nthis next man that's coming. He is not guileless, and he is not a\r\npeasant--but I don't know that either point is of vital importance.”\r\n\r\nIt was, in fact, the Honourable Eric Lindon, who had apparently\r\nfulfilled his task of escorting Lady Muriel home, and was now strolling\r\nleisurely up and down the road outside the house, enjoying; a solitary\r\ncigar.\r\n\r\n“Might I trouble you, Sir, to tell us the nearest way to Outland!”\r\n Oddity as he was, in outward appearance, the Professor was, in that\r\nessential nature which no outward disguise could conceal, a thorough\r\ngentleman.\r\n\r\nAnd, as such, Eric Lindon accepted him instantly. He took the cigar from\r\nhis mouth, and delicately shook off the ash, while he considered. “The\r\nname sounds strange to me,” he said. “I doubt if I can help you?'\r\n\r\n“It is not very far from Fairyland,” the Professor suggested.\r\n\r\nEric Lindon's eye-brows were slightly raised at these words, and an\r\namused smile, which he courteously tried to repress, flitted across his\r\nhandsome face: “A trifle cracked!” he muttered to himself. “But what a\r\njolly old patriarch it is!” Then he turned to the children. “And ca'n't\r\nyou help him, little folk?” he said, with a gentleness of tone that\r\nseemed to win their hearts at once. “Surely you know all about it?\r\n\r\n\r\n    'How many miles to Babylon?\r\n    Three-score miles and ten.\r\n    Can I get there by candlelight?\r\n    Yes, and back again!'”\r\n\r\nTo my surprise, Bruno ran forwards to him, as if he were some old friend\r\nof theirs, seized the disengaged hand and hung on to it with both of his\r\nown: and there stood this tall dignified officer in the middle of the\r\nroad, gravely swinging a little boy to and fro, while Sylvie stood ready\r\nto push him, exactly as if a real swing had suddenly been provided for\r\ntheir pastime.\r\n\r\n“We don't want to get to Babylon, oo know!” Bruno explained as he swung.\r\n\r\n“And it isn't candlelight: it's daylight!” Sylvie added, giving the\r\nswing a push of extra vigour, which nearly took the whole machine off\r\nits balance.\r\n\r\nBy this time it was clear to me that Eric Lindon was quite unconscious\r\nof my presence. Even the Professor and the children seemed to have lost\r\nsight of me: and I stood in the midst of the group, as unconcernedly as\r\na ghost, seeing but unseen.\r\n\r\n“How perfectly isochronous!” the Professor exclaimed with enthusiasm.\r\nHe had his watch in his hand, and was carefully counting Bruno's\r\noscillations. “He measures time quite as accurately as a pendulum!”\r\n {Image...'How perfectly isochronous!'}\r\n\r\n“Yet even pendulums,” the good-natured young soldier observed, as he\r\ncarefully released his hand from Bruno's grasp, “are not a joy for ever!\r\nCome, that's enough for one bout, little man!' Next time we meet, you\r\nshall have another. Meanwhile you'd better take this old gentleman to\r\nQueer Street, Number--”\r\n\r\n“We'll find it!” cried Bruno eagerly, as they dragged the Professor\r\naway.\r\n\r\n“We are much indebted to you!” the Professor said, looking over his\r\nshoulder.\r\n\r\n“Don't mention it!” replied the officer, raising his hat as a parting\r\nsalute.\r\n\r\n“What number did you say!” the Professor called from the distance.\r\n\r\nThe officer made a trumpet of his two hands. “Forty!” he shouted in\r\nstentorian tones. “And not piano, by any means!” he added to himself.\r\n“It's a mad world, my masters, a mad world!” He lit another cigar, and\r\nstrolled on towards his hotel.\r\n\r\n“What a lovely evening!” I said, joining him as he passed me.\r\n\r\n“Lovely indeed,” he said. “Where did you come from? Dropped from the\r\nclouds?”\r\n\r\n“I'm strolling your way,” I said; and no further explanation seemed\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\n“Have a cigar?”\r\n\r\n“Thanks: I'm not a smoker.”\r\n\r\n“Is there a Lunatic Asylum near here?”\r\n\r\n“Not that I know of.”\r\n\r\n“Thought there might be. Met a lunatic just now. Queer old fish as ever\r\nI saw!”\r\n\r\nAnd so, in friendly chat, we took our homeward ways, and wished each\r\nother 'good-night' at the door of his hotel.\r\n\r\nLeft to myself, I felt the 'eerie' feeling rush over me again, and saw,\r\nstanding at the door of Number Forty, the three figures I knew so well.\r\n\r\n“Then it's the wrong house?” Bruno was saying.\r\n\r\n“No, no! It's the right house,” the Professor cheerfully replied: “but\r\nit's the wrong street. That's where we've made our mistake! Our best\r\nplan, now, will be to--”\r\n\r\nIt was over. The street was empty, Commonplace life was around me, and\r\nthe 'eerie' feeling had fled.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 19. HOW TO MAKE A PHLIZZ.\r\n\r\nThe week passed without any further communication with the 'Hall,' as\r\nArthur was evidently fearful that we might 'wear out our welcome'; but\r\nwhen, on Sunday morning, we were setting out for church, I gladly agreed\r\nto his proposal to go round and enquire after the Earl, who was said to\r\nbe unwell.\r\n\r\nEric, who was strolling in the garden, gave us a good report of the\r\ninvalid, who was still in bed, with Lady Muriel in attendance.\r\n\r\n“Are you coming with us to church?” I enquired.\r\n\r\n“Thanks, no,” he courteously replied. “It's not--exactly in my line, you\r\nknow. It's an excellent institution--for the poor. When I'm with my own\r\nfolk, I go, just to set them an example. But I'm not known here: so I\r\nthink I'll excuse myself sitting out a sermon. Country-preachers are\r\nalways so dull!”\r\n\r\nArthur was silent till we were out of hearing. Then he said to himself,\r\nalmost inaudibly, “Where two or three are gathered together in my name,\r\nthere am I in the midst of them.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I assented: “no doubt that is the principle on which church-going\r\nrests.”\r\n\r\n“And when he does go,” he continued (our thoughts ran so much together,\r\nthat our conversation was often slightly elliptical), “I suppose he\r\nrepeats the words 'I believe in the Communion of Saints'?”\r\n\r\nBut by this time we had reached the little church, into which a goodly\r\nstream of worshipers, consisting mainly of fishermen and their families,\r\nwas flowing.\r\n\r\nThe service would have been pronounced by any modern aesthetic\r\nreligionist--or religious aesthete, which is it?--to be crude and cold:\r\nto me, coming fresh from the ever-advancing developments of a London\r\nchurch under a soi-disant 'Catholic' Rector, it was unspeakably\r\nrefreshing.\r\n\r\nThere was no theatrical procession of demure little choristers, trying\r\ntheir best not to simper under the admiring gaze of the congregation:\r\nthe people's share in the service was taken by the people themselves,\r\nunaided, except that a few good voices, judiciously posted here and\r\nthere among them, kept the singing from going too far astray.\r\n\r\nThere was no murdering of the noble music, contained in the Bible and\r\nthe Liturgy, by its recital in a dead monotone, with no more expression\r\nthan a mechanical talking-doll.\r\n\r\nNo, the prayers were prayed, the lessons were read, and best of all the\r\nsermon was talked; and I found myself repeating, as we left the church,\r\nthe words of Jacob, when he 'awaked out of his sleep.' “'Surely the Lord\r\nis in this place! This is none other but the house of God, and this is\r\nthe gate of heaven.'”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Arthur, apparently in answer to my thoughts, “those 'high'\r\nservices are fast becoming pure Formalism. More and more the people are\r\nbeginning to regard them as 'performances,' in which they only 'assist'\r\nin the French sense. And it is specially bad for the little boys.\r\nThey'd be much less self-conscious as pantomime-fairies. With all\r\nthat dressing-up, and stagy-entrances and exits, and being always en\r\nevidence, no wonder if they're eaten up with vanity, the blatant little\r\ncoxcombs!”\r\n\r\nWhen we passed the Hall on our return, we found the Earl and Lady Muriel\r\nsitting out in the garden. Eric had gone for a stroll.\r\n\r\nWe joined them, and the conversation soon turned on the sermon we had\r\njust heard, the subject of which was 'selfishness.'\r\n\r\n“What a change has come over our pulpits,” Arthur remarked, “since the\r\ntime when Paley gave that utterly selfish definition of virtue, 'the\r\ndoing good to mankind, in obedience to the will of God, and for the sake\r\nof everlasting happiness'!”\r\n\r\nLady Muriel looked at him enquiringly, but she seemed to have learned\r\nby intuition, what years of experience had taught me, that the way to\r\nelicit Arthur's deepest thoughts was neither to assent nor dissent, but\r\nsimply to listen.\r\n\r\n“At that time,” he went on, “a great tidal wave of selfishness\r\nwas sweeping over human thought. Right and Wrong had somehow been\r\ntransformed into Gain and Loss, and Religion had become a sort of\r\ncommercial transaction. We may be thankful that our preachers are\r\nbeginning to take a nobler view of life.”\r\n\r\n“But is it not taught again and again in the Bible?” I ventured to ask.\r\n\r\n“Not in the Bible as a whole,” said Arthur. “In the Old Testament, no\r\ndoubt, rewards and punishments are constantly appealed to as motives for\r\naction. That teaching is best for children, and the Israelites seem\r\nto have been, mentally, utter children. We guide our children thus,\r\nat first: but we appeal, as soon as possible, to their innate sense of\r\nRight and Wrong: and, when that stage is safely past, we appeal to the\r\nhighest motive of all, the desire for likeness to, and union with,\r\nthe Supreme Good. I think you will find that to be the teaching of the\r\nBible, as a whole, beginning with 'that thy days may be long in the\r\nland,' and ending with 'be ye perfect, even as your Father which is in\r\nheaven is perfect.'”\r\n\r\nWe were silent for awhile, and then Arthur went off on another tack.\r\n“Look at the literature of Hymns, now. How cankered it is, through and\r\nthrough, with selfishness! There are few human compositions more utterly\r\ndegraded than some modern Hymns!”\r\n\r\nI quoted the stanza\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Whatever, Lord, we tend to Thee,\r\n    Repaid a thousandfold shall be,\r\n    Then gladly will we give to Thee,\r\n    Giver of all!'\r\n\r\n“Yes,” he said grimly: “that is the typical stanza. And the very last\r\ncharity-sermon I heard was infected with it. After giving many good\r\nreasons for charity, the preacher wound up with 'and, for all you give,\r\nyou will be repaid a thousandfold!' Oh the utter meanness of such a\r\nmotive, to be put before men who do know what self-sacrifice is, who\r\ncan appreciate generosity and heroism! Talk of Original Sin!” he went\r\non with increasing bitterness. “Can you have a stronger proof of the\r\nOriginal Goodness there must be in this nation, than the fact that\r\nReligion has been preached to us, as a commercial speculation, for a\r\ncentury, and that we still believe in a God?”\r\n\r\n“It couldn't have gone on so long,” Lady Muriel musingly remarked, “if\r\nthe Opposition hadn't been practically silenced--put under what the\r\nFrench call la cloture. Surely in any lecture-hall, or in private\r\nsociety, such teaching would soon have been hooted down?”\r\n\r\n“I trust so,” said Arthur: “and, though I don't want to see 'brawling\r\nin church' legalised, I must say that our preachers enjoy an enormous\r\nprivilege--which they ill deserve, and which they misuse terribly. We\r\nput our man into a pulpit, and we virtually tell him 'Now, you may stand\r\nthere and talk to us for half-an-hour. We won't interrupt you by so much\r\nas a word! You shall have it all your own way!' And what does he give\r\nus in return? Shallow twaddle, that, if it were addressed to you over a\r\ndinner-table, you would think 'Does the man take me for a fool?'”\r\n\r\nThe return of Eric from his walk checked the tide of Arthur's eloquence,\r\nand, after a few minutes' talk on more conventional topics, we took our\r\nleave. Lady Muriel walked with us to the gate. “You have given me much\r\nto think about,” she said earnestly, as she gave Arthur her hand. “I'm\r\nso glad you came in!” And her words brought a real glow of pleasure into\r\nthat pale worn face of his.\r\n\r\nOn the Tuesday, as Arthur did not seem equal to more walking, I took\r\na long stroll by myself, having stipulated that he was not to give\r\nthe whole day to his books, but was to meet me at the Hall at\r\nabout tea-time. On my way back, I passed the Station just as the\r\nafternoon-train came in sight, and sauntered down the stairs to see it\r\ncome in. But there was little to gratify my idle curiosity: and, when\r\nthe train was empty, and the platform clear, I found it was about time\r\nto be moving on, if I meant to reach the Hall by five.\r\n\r\nAs I approached the end of the platform, from which a steep irregular\r\nwooden staircase conducted to the upper world, I noticed two passengers,\r\nwho had evidently arrived by the train, but who, oddly enough, had\r\nentirely escaped my notice, though the arrivals had been so few. They\r\nwere a young woman and a little girl: the former, so far as one could\r\njudge by appearances, was a nursemaid, or possibly a nursery-governess,\r\nin attendance on the child, whose refined face, even more than her\r\ndress, distinguished her as of a higher class than her companion.\r\n\r\nThe child's face was refined, but it was also a worn and sad one, and\r\ntold a tale (or so I seemed to read it) of much illness and suffering,\r\nsweetly and patiently borne. She had a little crutch to help herself\r\nalong with: and she was now standing, looking wistfully up the long\r\nstaircase, and apparently waiting till she could muster courage to begin\r\nthe toilsome ascent.\r\n\r\nThere are some things one says in life--as well as things one\r\ndoes--which come automatically, by reflex action, as the physiologists\r\nsay (meaning, no doubt, action without reflection, just as lucus is said\r\nto be derived 'a non lucendo'). Closing one's eyelids, when something\r\nseems to be flying into the eye, is one of those actions, and saying\r\n“May I carry the little girl up the stairs?” was another. It wasn't that\r\nany thought of offering help occurred to me, and that then I spoke:\r\nthe first intimation I had, of being likely to make that offer, was the\r\nsound of my own voice, and the discovery that the offer had been made.\r\nThe servant paused, doubtfully glancing from her charge to me, and then\r\nback again to the child. “Would you like it, dear?” she asked her. But\r\nno such doubt appeared to cross the child's mind: she lifted her arms\r\neagerly to be taken up. “Please!” was all she said, while a faint smile\r\nflickered on the weary little face. I took her up with scrupulous care,\r\nand her little arm was at once clasped trustfully round my neck.\r\n\r\n{Image...The lame child}\r\n\r\nShe was a very light weight--so light, in fact, that the ridiculous idea\r\ncrossed my mind that it was rather easier going up, with her in my\r\narms, than it would have been without her: and, when we reached the road\r\nabove, with its cart-ruts and loose stones--all formidable obstacles for\r\na lame child--I found that I had said “I'd better carry her over this\r\nrough place,” before I had formed any mental connection between its\r\nroughness and my gentle little burden. “Indeed it's troubling you too\r\nmuch, Sir!” the maid exclaimed. “She can walk very well on the flat.”\r\n But the arm, that was twined about my neck, clung just an atom more\r\nclosely at the suggestion, and decided me to say “She's no weight,\r\nreally. I'll carry her a little further. I'm going your way.”\r\n\r\nThe nurse raised no further objection: and the next speaker was a ragged\r\nlittle boy, with bare feet, and a broom over his shoulder, who ran\r\nacross the road, and pretended to sweep the perfectly dry road in front\r\nof us. “Give us a 'ap'ny!” the little urchin pleaded, with a broad grin\r\non his dirty face.\r\n\r\n“Don't give him a 'ap'ny!” said the little lady in my arms. The words\r\nsounded harsh: but the tone was gentleness itself. “He's an idle little\r\nboy!” And she laughed a laugh of such silvery sweetness as I had never\r\nyet heard from any lips but Sylvie's. To my astonishment, the boy\r\nactually joined in the laugh, as if there were some subtle sympathy\r\nbetween them, as he ran away down the road and vanished through a gap in\r\nthe hedge.\r\n\r\nBut he was back in a few moments, having discarded his broom and\r\nprovided himself, from some mysterious source, with an exquisite bouquet\r\nof flowers. “Buy a posy, buy a posy! Only a 'ap'ny!” he chanted, with\r\nthe melancholy drawl of a professional beggar.\r\n\r\n“Don't buy it!” was Her Majesty's edict as she looked down, with a lofty\r\nscorn that seemed curiously mixed with tender interest, on the ragged\r\ncreature at her feet.\r\n\r\nBut this time I turned rebel, and ignored the royal commands. Such\r\nlovely flowers, and of forms so entirely new to me, were not to be\r\nabandoned at the bidding of any little maid, however imperious. I bought\r\nthe bouquet: and the little boy, after popping the halfpenny into his\r\nmouth, turned head-over-heels, as if to ascertain whether the human\r\nmouth is really adapted to serve as a money-box.\r\n\r\nWith wonder, that increased every moment, I turned over the flowers, and\r\nexamined them one by one: there was not a single one among them that\r\nI could remember having ever seen before. At last I turned to the\r\nnursemaid. “Do these flowers grow wild about here? I never saw--” but\r\nthe speech died away on my lips. The nursemaid had vanished!\r\n\r\n“You can put me down, now, if you like,” Sylvie quietly remarked.\r\n\r\nI obeyed in silence, and could only ask myself “Is this a dream?”, on\r\nfinding Sylvie and Bruno walking one on either side of me, and clinging\r\nto my hands with the ready confidence of childhood.\r\n\r\n“You're larger than when I saw you last!” I began. “Really I think we\r\nought to be introduced again! There's so much of you that I never met\r\nbefore, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Very well!” Sylvie merrily replied. “This is Bruno. It doesn't take\r\nlong. He's only got one name!”\r\n\r\n“There's another name to me!” Bruno protested, with a reproachful look\r\nat the Mistress of the Ceremonies. “And it's--' Esquire'!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, of course. I forgot,” said Sylvie. “Bruno--Esquire!”\r\n\r\n“And did you come here to meet me, my children?” I enquired.\r\n\r\n“You know I said we'd come on Tuesday,” Sylvie explained. “Are we the\r\nproper size for common children?”\r\n\r\n“Quite the right size for children,” I replied, (adding mentally “though\r\nnot common children, by any means!”) “But what became of the nursemaid?”\r\n\r\n“It are gone!” Bruno solemnly replied.\r\n\r\n“Then it wasn't solid, like Sylvie and you?”\r\n\r\n“No. Oo couldn't touch it, oo know. If oo walked at it, oo'd go right\r\nfroo!”\r\n\r\n“I quite expected you'd find it out, once,” said Sylvie. “Bruno ran it\r\nagainst a telegraph post, by accident. And it went in two halves. But\r\nyou were looking the other way.”\r\n\r\nI felt that I had indeed missed an opportunity: to witness such an\r\nevent as a nursemaid going 'in two halves' does not occur twice in a\r\nlife-time!\r\n\r\n“When did oo guess it were Sylvie?” Bruno enquired.\r\n\r\n{Image...'It went in two halves'}\r\n\r\n“I didn't guess it, till it was Sylvie,” I said. “But how did you manage\r\nthe nursemaid?”\r\n\r\n“Bruno managed it,” said Sylvie. “It's called a Phlizz.”\r\n\r\n“And how do you make a Phlizz, Bruno?”\r\n\r\n“The Professor teached me how,” said Bruno. “First oo takes a lot of\r\nair--”\r\n\r\n“Oh, Bruno!” Sylvie interposed. “The Professor said you weren't to\r\ntell!”\r\n\r\n“But who did her voice?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Indeed it's troubling you too much, Sir! She can walk very well on the\r\nflat.”\r\n\r\nBruno laughed merrily as I turned hastily from side to side, looking in\r\nall directions for the speaker. “That were me!” he gleefully proclaimed,\r\nin his own voice.\r\n\r\n“She can indeed walk very well on the flat,” I said. “And I think I was\r\nthe Flat.”\r\n\r\nBy this time we were near the Hall. “This is where my friends live,” I\r\nsaid. “Will you come in and have some tea with them?”\r\n\r\nBruno gave a little jump of joy: and Sylvie said “Yes, please. You'd\r\nlike some tea, Bruno, wouldn't you? He hasn't tasted tea,” she explained\r\nto me, “since we left Outland.”\r\n\r\n“And that weren't good tea!” said Bruno. “It were so welly weak!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 20. LIGHT COME, LIGHT GO.\r\n\r\nLady Muriel's smile of welcome could not quite conceal the look of\r\nsurprise with which she regarded my new companions.\r\n\r\nI presented them in due form. “This is Sylvie, Lady Muriel. And this is\r\nBruno.”\r\n\r\n“Any surname?” she enquired, her eyes twinkling with fun.\r\n\r\n“No,” I said gravely. “No surname.”\r\n\r\nShe laughed, evidently thinking I said it in fun; and stooped to kiss\r\nthe children a salute to which Bruno submitted with reluctance: Sylvie\r\nreturned it with interest.\r\n\r\nWhile she and Arthur (who had arrived before me) supplied the children\r\nwith tea and cake, I tried to engage the Earl in conversation: but he\r\nwas restless and distrait, and we made little progress. At last, by a\r\nsudden question, he betrayed the cause of his disquiet.\r\n\r\n“Would you let me look at those flowers you have in your hand?”\r\n\r\n“Willingly!” I said, handing him the bouquet. Botany was, I knew, a\r\nfavourite study of his: and these flowers were to me so entirely new and\r\nmysterious, that I was really curious to see what a botanist would say\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nThey did not diminish his disquiet. On the contrary, he became every\r\nmoment more excited as he turned them over. “These are all from Central\r\nIndia!” he said, laying aside part of the bouquet. “They are rare, even\r\nthere: and I have never seen them in any other part of the world. These\r\ntwo are Mexican--This one--” (He rose hastily, and carried it to\r\nthe window, to examine it in a better light, the flush of excitement\r\nmounting to his very forehead) “--is, I am nearly sure--but I have a\r\nbook of Indian Botany here--” He took a volume from the book-shelves,\r\nand turned the leaves with trembling fingers. “Yes! Compare it with this\r\npicture! It is the exact duplicate! This is the flower of the Upas-tree,\r\nwhich usually grows only in the depths of forests; and the flower fades\r\nso quickly after being plucked, that it is scarcely possible to keep its\r\nform or colour even so far as the outskirts of the forest! Yet this\r\nis in full bloom! Where did you get these flowers?” he added with\r\nbreathless eagerness.\r\n\r\nI glanced at Sylvie, who, gravely and silently, laid her finger on her\r\nlips, then beckoned to Bruno to follow her, and ran out into the\r\ngarden; and I found myself in the position of a defendant whose two most\r\nimportant witnesses have been suddenly taken away. “Let me give you the\r\nflowers!” I stammered out at last, quite 'at my wit's end' as to how to\r\nget out of the difficulty. “You know much more about them than I do!”\r\n\r\n“I accept them most gratefully! But you have not yet told me--” the\r\nEarl was beginning, when we were interrupted, to my great relief, by the\r\narrival of Eric Lindon.\r\n\r\nTo Arthur, however, the new-comer was, I saw clearly, anything but\r\nwelcome. His face clouded over: he drew a little back from the\r\ncircle, and took no further part in the conversation, which was wholly\r\nmaintained, for some minutes, by Lady Muriel and her lively cousin, who\r\nwere discussing some new music that had just arrived from London.\r\n\r\n“Do just try this one!” he pleaded. “The music looks easy to sing at\r\nsight, and the song's quite appropriate to the occasion.”\r\n\r\n“Then I suppose it's\r\n\r\n\r\n    'Five o'clock tea!\r\n    Ever to thee\r\n    Faithful I'll be,\r\n    Five o'clock tea!”'\r\n\r\nlaughed Lady Muriel, as she sat down to the piano, and lightly struck a\r\nfew random chords.\r\n\r\n“Not quite: and yet it is a kind of 'ever to thee faithful I'll be!'\r\nIt's a pair of hapless lovers: he crosses the briny deep: and she is\r\nleft lamenting.”\r\n\r\n“That is indeed appropriate!” she replied mockingly, as he placed the\r\nsong before her. “And am I to do the lamenting? And who for, if you\r\nplease?”\r\n\r\nShe played the air once or twice through, first in quick, and finally in\r\nslow, time; and then gave us the whole song with as much graceful ease\r\nas if she had been familiar with it all her life:--\r\n\r\n\r\n    “He stept so lightly to the land,\r\n    All in his manly pride:\r\n    He kissed her cheek, he pressed her hand,\r\n    Yet still she glanced aside.\r\n    'Too gay he seems,' she darkly dreams,\r\n    'Too gallant and too gay\r\n    To think of me--poor simple me---\r\n    When he is far away!'\r\n\r\n    'I bring my Love this goodly pearl\r\n    Across the seas,' he said:\r\n    'A gem to deck the dearest girl\r\n    That ever sailor wed!'\r\n    She clasps it tight: her eyes are bright:\r\n    Her throbbing heart would say\r\n    'He thought of me--he thought of me---\r\n    When he was far away!'\r\n\r\n    The ship has sailed into the West:\r\n    Her ocean-bird is flown:\r\n    A dull dead pain is in her breast,\r\n    And she is weak and lone:\r\n    Yet there's a smile upon her face,\r\n    A smile that seems to say\r\n    'He'll think of me he'll think of me---\r\n    When he is far away!\r\n\r\n    'Though waters wide between us glide,\r\n    Our lives are warm and near:\r\n    No distance parts two faithful hearts\r\n    Two hearts that love so dear:\r\n    And I will trust my sailor-lad,\r\n    For ever and a day,\r\n    To think of me--to think of me---\r\n    When he is far away!'”\r\n\r\nThe look of displeasure, which had begun to come over Arthur's face\r\nwhen the young Captain spoke of Love so lightly, faded away as the song\r\nproceeded, and he listened with evident delight. But his face darkened\r\nagain when Eric demurely remarked “Don't you think 'my soldier-lad'\r\nwould have fitted the tune just as well!”\r\n\r\n“Why, so it would!” Lady Muriel gaily retorted. “Soldiers, sailors,\r\ntinkers, tailors, what a lot of words would fit in! I think 'my\r\ntinker-lad' sounds best. Don't you?”\r\n\r\nTo spare my friend further pain, I rose to go, just as the Earl was\r\nbeginning to repeat his particularly embarrassing question about the\r\nflowers.\r\n\r\n“You have not yet--'\r\n\r\n“Yes, I've had some tea, thank you!” I hastily interrupted him. “And\r\nnow we really must be going. Good evening, Lady Muriel!” And we made our\r\nadieux, and escaped, while the Earl was still absorbed in examining the\r\nmysterious bouquet.\r\n\r\nLady Muriel accompanied us to the door. “You couldn't have given\r\nmy father a more acceptable present!” she said, warmly. “He is so\r\npassionately fond of Botany. I'm afraid I know nothing of the theory\r\nof it, but I keep his Hortus Siccus in order. I must get some sheets of\r\nblotting-paper, and dry these new treasures for him before they fade.\r\n\r\n“That won't be no good at all!” said Bruno, who was waiting for us in\r\nthe garden.\r\n\r\n“Why won't it?” said I. “You know I had to give the flowers, to stop\r\nquestions?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it ca'n't be helped,” said Sylvie: “but they will be sorry when\r\nthey find them gone!”\r\n\r\n“But how will they go?”\r\n\r\n“Well, I don't know how. But they will go. The nosegay was only a\r\nPhlizz, you know. Bruno made it up.”\r\n\r\nThese last words were in a whisper, as she evidently did not wish Arthur\r\nto hear. But of this there seemed to be little risk: he hardly seemed to\r\nnotice the children, but paced on, silent and abstracted; and when, at\r\nthe entrance to the wood, they bid us a hasty farewell and ran off, he\r\nseemed to wake out of a day-dream.\r\n\r\nThe bouquet vanished, as Sylvie had predicted; and when, a day or two\r\nafterwards, Arthur and I once more visited the Hall, we found the Earl\r\nand his daughter, with the old housekeeper, out in the garden, examining\r\nthe fastenings of the drawing-room window.\r\n\r\n“We are holding an Inquest,” Lady Muriel said, advancing to meet us:\r\n“and we admit you, as Accessories before the Fact, to tell us all you\r\nknow about those flowers.”\r\n\r\n“The Accessories before the Fact decline to answer any questions,” I\r\ngravely replied. “And they reserve their defence.”\r\n\r\n“Well then, turn Queen's Evidence, please! The flowers have disappeared\r\nin the night,” she went on, turning to Arthur, “and we are quite sure\r\nno one in the house has meddled with them. Somebody must have entered by\r\nthe window--”\r\n\r\n“But the fastenings have not been tampered with,” said the Earl.\r\n\r\n“It must have been while you were dining, my Lady,” said the\r\nhousekeeper.\r\n\r\n“That was it,” said the Earl. “The thief must have seen you bring the\r\nflowers,” turning to me, “and have noticed that you did not take\r\nthem away. And he must have known their great value--they are simply\r\npriceless!” he exclaimed, in sudden excitement.\r\n\r\n“And you never told us how you got them!” said Lady Muriel.\r\n\r\n“Some day,” I stammered, “I may be free to tell you. Just now, would you\r\nexcuse me?”\r\n\r\nThe Earl looked disappointed, but kindly said “Very well, we will ask no\r\nquestions.”\r\n\r\n{Image...Five o'clock tea}\r\n\r\n“But we consider you a very bad Queen's Evidence,” Lady Muriel added\r\nplayfully, as we entered the arbour. “We pronounce you to be an\r\naccomplice: and we sentence you to solitary confinement, and to be fed\r\non bread and butter. Do you take sugar?”\r\n\r\n“It is disquieting, certainly,” she resumed, when all\r\n'creature-comforts' had been duly supplied, “to find that the house\r\nhas been entered by a thief in this out-of-the-way place. If only the\r\nflowers had been eatables, one might have suspected a thief of quite\r\nanother shape--”\r\n\r\n“You mean that universal explanation for all mysterious disappearances,\r\n'the cat did it'?” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she replied. “What a convenient thing it would be if all thieves\r\nhad the same shape! It's so confusing to have some of them quadrupeds\r\nand others bipeds!”\r\n\r\n“It has occurred to me,” said Arthur, “as a curious problem in\r\nTeleology--the Science of Final Causes,” he added, in answer to an\r\nenquiring look from Lady Muriel.\r\n\r\n“And a Final Cause is--?”\r\n\r\n“Well, suppose we say--the last of a series of connected events--each of\r\nthe series being the cause of the next--for whose sake the first event\r\ntakes place.”\r\n\r\n“But the last event is practically an effect of the first, isn't it? And\r\nyet you call it a cause of it!”\r\n\r\nArthur pondered a moment. “The words are rather confusing, I grant you,”\r\n he said. “Will this do? The last event is an effect of the first: but\r\nthe necessity for that event is a cause of the necessity for the first.”\r\n\r\n“That seems clear enough,” said Lady Muriel. “Now let us have the\r\nproblem.”\r\n\r\n“It's merely this. What object can we imagine in the arrangement by\r\nwhich each different size (roughly speaking) of living creatures has\r\nits special shape? For instance, the human race has one kind of\r\nshape--bipeds. Another set, ranging from the lion to the mouse, are\r\nquadrupeds. Go down a step or two further, and you come to insects with\r\nsix legs--hexapods--a beautiful name, is it not? But beauty, in our\r\nsense of the word, seems to diminish as we go down: the creature becomes\r\nmore--I won't say 'ugly' of any of God's creatures--more uncouth. And,\r\nwhen we take the microscope, and go a few steps lower still, we come\r\nupon animalculae, terribly uncouth, and with a terrible number of legs!”\r\n\r\n“The other alternative,” said the Earl, “would be a diminuendo series of\r\nrepetitions of the same type. Never mind the monotony of it: let's see\r\nhow it would work in other ways. Begin with the race of men, and the\r\ncreatures they require: let us say horses, cattle, sheep, and dogs--we\r\ndon't exactly require frogs and spiders, do we, Muriel?”\r\n\r\nLady Muriel shuddered perceptibly: it was evidently a painful subject.\r\n“We can dispense with them,” she said gravely.\r\n\r\n“Well, then we'll have a second race of men, half-a-yard high--”\r\n\r\n“--who would have one source of exquisite enjoyment, not possessed by\r\nordinary men!” Arthur interrupted.\r\n\r\n“What source?” said the Earl.\r\n\r\n“Why, the grandeur of scenery! Surely the grandeur of a mountain, to me,\r\ndepends on its size, relative to me? Double the height of the mountain,\r\nand of course it's twice as grand. Halve my height, and you produce the\r\nsame effect.”\r\n\r\n“Happy, happy, happy Small!” Lady Muriel murmured rapturously. “None but\r\nthe Short, none but the Short, none but the Short enjoy the Tall!”\r\n\r\n“But let me go on,” said the Earl. “We'll have a third race of men, five\r\ninches high; a fourth race, an inch high--”\r\n\r\n“They couldn't eat common beef and mutton, I'm sure!” Lady Muriel\r\ninterrupted.\r\n\r\n“True, my child, I was forgetting. Each set must have its own cattle and\r\nsheep.”\r\n\r\n“And its own vegetation,” I added. “What could a cow, an inch high, do\r\nwith grass that waved far above its head?”\r\n\r\n“That is true. We must have a pasture within a pasture, so to speak. The\r\ncommon grass would serve our inch-high cows as a green forest of palms,\r\nwhile round the root of each tall stem would stretch a tiny carpet of\r\nmicroscopic grass. Yes, I think our scheme will work fairly well. And it\r\nwould be very interesting, coming into contact with the races below us.\r\nWhat sweet little things the inch-high bull-dogs would be! I doubt if\r\neven Muriel would run away from one of them!”\r\n\r\n“Don't you think we ought to have a crescendo series, as well?” said\r\nLady Muriel. “Only fancy being a hundred yards high! One could use an\r\nelephant as a paper-weight, and a crocodile as a pair of scissors!”\r\n\r\n“And would you have races of different sizes communicate with one\r\nanother?” I enquired. “Would they make war on one another, for instance,\r\nor enter into treaties?”\r\n\r\n“War we must exclude, I think. When you could crush a whole nation with\r\none blow of your fist, you couldn't conduct war on equal terms. But\r\nanything, involving a collision of minds only, would be possible in\r\nour ideal world--for of course we must allow mental powers to all,\r\nirrespective of size. Perhaps the fairest rule would be that, the\r\nsmaller the race, the greater should be its intellectual development!”\r\n\r\n“Do you mean to say,” said Lady Muriel, “that these manikins of an inch\r\nhigh are to argue with me?”\r\n\r\n“Surely, surely!” said the Earl. “An argument doesn't depend for its\r\nlogical force on the size of the creature that utters it!”\r\n\r\nShe tossed her head indignantly. “I would not argue with any man less\r\nthan six inches high!” she cried. “I'd make him work!”\r\n\r\n“What at?” said Arthur, listening to all this nonsense with an amused\r\nsmile.\r\n\r\n“Embroidery!” she readily replied. “What lovely embroidery they would\r\ndo!”\r\n\r\n“Yet, if they did it wrong,” I said, “you couldn't argue the question. I\r\ndon't know why: but I agree that it couldn't be done.”\r\n\r\n“The reason is,” said Lady Muriel, “one couldn't sacrifice one's dignity\r\nso far.”\r\n\r\n“Of course one couldn't!” echoed Arthur. “Any more than one could argue\r\nwith a potato. It would be altogether--excuse the ancient pun--infra\r\ndig.!”\r\n\r\n“I doubt it,” said I. “Even a pun doesn't quite convince me.”\r\n\r\n“Well, if that is not the reason,” said Lady Muriel, “what reason would\r\nyou give?”\r\n\r\nI tried hard to understand the meaning of this question: but the\r\npersistent humming of the bees confused me, and there was a drowsiness\r\nin the air that made every thought stop and go to sleep before it had\r\ngot well thought out: so all I could say was “That must depend on the\r\nweight of the potato.”\r\n\r\nI felt the remark was not so sensible as I should have liked it to be.\r\nBut Lady Muriel seemed to take it quite as a matter of course. “In that\r\ncase--” she began, but suddenly started, and turned away to listen.\r\n“Don't you hear him?” she said. “He's crying. We must go to him,\r\nsomehow.”\r\n\r\nAnd I said to myself “That's very strange.” I quite thought it was\r\nLady Muriel talking to me. “Why, it's Sylvie all the while!” And I made\r\nanother great effort to say something that should have some meaning in\r\nit. “Is it about the potato?”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 21. THROUGH THE IVORY DOOR.\r\n\r\n“I don't know,” said Sylvie. “Hush! I must think. I could go to him, by\r\nmyself, well enough. But I want you to come too.”\r\n\r\n“Let me go with you,” I pleaded. “I can walk as fast as you can, I'm\r\nsure.”\r\n\r\nSylvie laughed merrily. “What nonsense!” she cried. “Why, you ca'n't\r\nwalk a bit! You're lying quite flat on your back! You don't understand\r\nthese things.”\r\n\r\n“I can walk as well as you can,” I repeated. And I tried my best to walk\r\na few steps: but the ground slipped away backwards, quite as fast as I\r\ncould walk, so that I made no progress at all. Sylvie laughed again.\r\n\r\n“There, I told you so! You've no idea how funny you look, moving your\r\nfeet about in the air, as if you were walking! Wait a bit. I'll ask the\r\nProfessor what we'd better do.” And she knocked at his study-door.\r\n\r\nThe door opened, and the Professor looked out. “What's that crying I\r\nheard just now?” he asked. “Is it a human animal?”\r\n\r\n“It's a boy,” Sylvie said.\r\n\r\n“I'm afraid you've been teasing him?”\r\n\r\n“No, indeed I haven't!” Sylvie said, very earnestly. “I never tease\r\nhim!”\r\n\r\n“Well, I must ask the Other Professor about it.” He went back into the\r\nstudy, and we heard him whispering “small human animal--says she hasn't\r\nbeen teasing him--the kind that's called Boy--”\r\n\r\n“Ask her which Boy,” said a new voice. The Professor came out again.\r\n\r\n“Which Boy is it that you haven't been teasing?”\r\n\r\nSylvie looked at me with twinkling eyes. “You dear old thing!” she\r\nexclaimed, standing on tiptoe to kiss him, while he gravely stooped to\r\nreceive the salute. “How you do puzzle me! Why, there are several boys I\r\nhaven't been teasing!”\r\n\r\nThe Professor returned to his friend: and this time the voice said “Tell\r\nher to bring them here--all of them!”\r\n\r\n“I ca'n't, and I won't!” Sylvie exclaimed, the moment he reappeared.\r\n“It's Bruno that's crying: and he's my brother: and, please, we both\r\nwant to go: he ca'n't walk, you know: he's--he's dreaming, you know”\r\n (this in a whisper, for fear of hurting my feelings). “Do let's go\r\nthrough the Ivory Door!”\r\n\r\n“I'll ask him,” said the Professor, disappearing again. He returned\r\ndirectly. “He says you may. Follow me, and walk on tip-toe.”\r\n\r\nThe difficulty with me would have been, just then, not to walk on\r\ntip-toe. It seemed very hard to reach down far enough to just touch the\r\nfloor, as Sylvie led me through the study.\r\n\r\nThe Professor went before us to unlock the Ivory Door. I had just time\r\nto glance at the Other Professor, who was sitting reading, with his back\r\nto us, before the Professor showed us out through the door, and locked\r\nit behind us. Bruno was standing with his hands over his face, crying\r\nbitterly.\r\n\r\n{Image...'What's the matter, darling?'}\r\n\r\n“What's the matter, darling?” said Sylvie, with her arms round his neck.\r\n\r\n“Hurted mine self welly much!” sobbed the poor little fellow.\r\n\r\n“I'm so sorry, darling! How ever did you manage to hurt yourself so?”\r\n\r\n“Course I managed it!” said Bruno, laughing through his tears. “Doos oo\r\nthink nobody else but oo ca'n't manage things?”\r\n\r\nMatters were looking distinctly brighter, now Bruno had begun to argue.\r\n“Come, let's hear all about it!” I said.\r\n\r\n“My foot took it into its head to slip--” Bruno began.\r\n\r\n“A foot hasn't got a head!” Sylvie put in, but all in vain.\r\n\r\n“I slipted down the bank. And I tripted over a stone. And the stone\r\nhurted my foot! And I trod on a Bee. And the Bee stinged my finger!”\r\n Poor Bruno sobbed again. The complete list of woes was too much for his\r\nfeelings. “And it knewed I didn't mean to trod on it!” he added, as the\r\nclimax.\r\n\r\n“That Bee should be ashamed of itself!” I said severely, and Sylvie\r\nhugged and kissed the wounded hero till all tears were dried.\r\n\r\n“My finger's quite unstung now!” said Bruno. “Why doos there be stones?\r\nMister Sir, doos oo know?”\r\n\r\n“They're good for something,” I said: “even if we don't know what.\r\nWhat's the good of dandelions, now?”\r\n\r\n“Dindledums?” said Bruno. “Oh, they're ever so pretty! And stones aren't\r\npretty, one bit. Would oo like some dindledums, Mister Sir?”\r\n\r\n“Bruno!” Sylvie murmured reproachfully. “You mustn't say 'Mister' and\r\n'Sir,' both at once! Remember what I told you!”\r\n\r\n“You telled me I were to say Mister' when I spoked about him, and I were\r\nto say 'Sir' when I spoked to him!”\r\n\r\n“Well, you're not doing both, you know.”\r\n\r\n“Ah, but I is doing bofe, Miss Praticular!” Bruno exclaimed\r\ntriumphantly. “I wishted to speak about the Gemplun--and I wishted to\r\nspeak to the Gemplun. So a course I said 'Mister Sir'!”\r\n\r\n“That's all right, Bruno,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Course it's all right!” said Bruno. “Sylvie just knows nuffin at all!”\r\n\r\n“There never was an impertinenter boy!” said Sylvie, frowning till her\r\nbright eyes were nearly invisible.\r\n\r\n“And there never was an ignoranter girl!” retorted Bruno. “Come along\r\nand pick some dindledums. That's all she's fit for!” he added in a very\r\nloud whisper to me.\r\n\r\n“But why do you say 'Dindledums,' Bruno? Dandelions is the right word.”\r\n\r\n“It's because he jumps about so,” Sylvie said, laughing.\r\n\r\n“Yes, that's it,” Bruno assented. “Sylvie tells me the words, and then,\r\nwhen I jump about, they get shooken up in my head--till they're all\r\nfroth!”\r\n\r\nI expressed myself as perfectly satisfied with this explanation. “But\r\naren't you going to pick me any dindledums, after all?”\r\n\r\n“Course we will!” cried Bruno. “Come along, Sylvie!” And the happy\r\nchildren raced away, bounding over the turf with the fleetness and grace\r\nof young antelopes.\r\n\r\n“Then you didn't find your way back to Outland?” I said to the\r\nProfessor.\r\n\r\n“Oh yes, I did!” he replied, “We never got to Queer Street; but I found\r\nanother way. I've been backwards and forwards several times since then.\r\nI had to be present at the Election, you know, as the author of the new\r\nMoney-act. The Emperor was so kind as to wish that I should have the\r\ncredit of it. 'Let come what come may,' (I remember the very words of\r\nthe Imperial Speech) 'if it should turn out that the Warden is alive,\r\nyou will bear witness that the change in the coinage is the Professor's\r\ndoing, not mine!' I never was so glorified in my life, before!” Tears\r\ntrickled down his cheeks at the recollection, which apparently was not\r\nwholly a pleasant one.\r\n\r\n“Is the Warden supposed to be dead?”\r\n\r\n“Well, it's supposed so: but, mind you, I don't believe it! The evidence\r\nis very weak--mere hear-say. A wandering Jester, with a Dancing-Bear\r\n(they found their way into the Palace, one day) has been telling people\r\nhe comes from Fairyland, and that the Warden died there. I wanted the\r\nVice-Warden to question him, but, most unluckily, he and my Lady\r\nwere always out walking when the Jester came round. Yes, the Warden's\r\nsupposed to be dead!” And more tears trickled down the old man's cheeks.\r\n\r\n“But what is the new Money-Act?”\r\n\r\nThe Professor brightened up again. “The Emperor started the thing,” he\r\nsaid. “He wanted to make everybody in Outland twice as rich as he was\r\nbefore just to make the new Government popular. Only there wasn't nearly\r\nenough money in the Treasury to do it. So I suggested that he might do\r\nit by doubling the value of every coin and bank-note in Outland. It's\r\nthe simplest thing possible. I wonder nobody ever thought of it before!\r\nAnd you never saw such universal joy. The shops are full from morning to\r\nnight. Everybody's buying everything!”\r\n\r\n“And how was the glorifying done?”\r\n\r\nA sudden gloom overcast the Professor's jolly face. “They did it as I\r\nwent home after the Election,” he mournfully replied. “It was kindly\r\nmeant but I didn't like it! They waved flags all round me till I was\r\nnearly blind: and they rang bells till I was nearly deaf: and they\r\nstrewed the road so thick with flowers that I lost my way!” And the poor\r\nold man sighed deeply.\r\n\r\n“How far is it to Outland?” I asked, to change the subject.\r\n\r\n“About five days' march. But one must go back--occasionally. You see, as\r\nCourt-Professor, I have to be always in attendance on Prince Uggug. The\r\nEmpress would be very angry if I left him, even for an hour.”\r\n\r\n“But surely, every time you come here, you are absent ten days, at\r\nleast?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, more than that!” the Professor exclaimed. “A fortnight, sometimes.\r\nBut of course I keep a memorandum of the exact time when I started, so\r\nthat I can put the Court-time back to the very moment!” “Excuse me,” I\r\nsaid. “I don't understand.”\r\n\r\nSilently the Professor drew front his pocket a square gold watch, with\r\nsix or eight hands, and held it out for my inspection. “This,” he began,\r\n“is an Outlandish Watch--”\r\n\r\n“So I should have thought.”\r\n\r\n“--which has the peculiar property that, instead of its going with the\r\ntime, the time goes with it. I trust you understand me now?”\r\n\r\n“Hardly,” I said.\r\n\r\n“Permit me to explain. So long as it is let alone, it takes its own\r\ncourse. Time has no effect upon it.”\r\n\r\n“I have known such watches,” I remarked.\r\n\r\n“It goes, of course, at the usual rate. Only the time has to go with it.\r\nHence, if I move the hands, I change the time. To move them forwards, in\r\nadvance of the true time, is impossible: but I can move them as much as\r\na month backwards---that is the limit. And then you have the events all\r\nover again--with any alterations experience may suggest.”\r\n\r\n“What a blessing such a watch would be,” I thought, “in real life! To\r\nbe able to unsay some heedless word--to undo some reckless deed! Might I\r\nsee the thing done?”\r\n\r\n“With pleasure!” said the good natured Professor. “When I move this\r\nhand back to here,” pointing out the place, “History goes back fifteen\r\nminutes!”\r\n\r\nTrembling with excitement, I watched him push the hand round as he\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n“Hurted mine self welly much!”\r\n\r\nShrilly and suddenly the words rang in my ears, and, more startled than\r\nI cared to show, I turned to look for the speaker.\r\n\r\nYes! There was Bruno, standing with the tears running down his cheeks,\r\njust as I had seen him a quarter of an hour ago; and there was Sylvie\r\nwith her arms round his neck!\r\n\r\nI had not the heart to make the dear little fellow go through his\r\ntroubles a second time, so hastily begged the Professor to push the\r\nhands round into their former position. In a moment Sylvie and Bruno\r\nwere gone again, and I could just see them in the far distance, picking\r\n'dindledums.'\r\n\r\n“Wonderful, indeed!” I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“It has another property, yet more wonderful,” said the Professor. “You\r\nsee this little peg? That is called the 'Reversal Peg.' If you push it\r\nin, the events of the next hour happen in the reverse order. Do not\r\ntry it now. I will lend you the Watch for a few days, and you can amuse\r\nyourself with experiments.”\r\n\r\n“Thank you very much!” I said as he gave me the Watch. “I'll take the\r\ngreatest care of it--why, here are the children again!”\r\n\r\n“We could only but find six dindledums,” said Bruno, putting them into\r\nmy hands, “'cause Sylvie said it were time to go back. And here's a big\r\nblackberry for ooself! We couldn't only find but two!”\r\n\r\n“Thank you: it's very nice,” I said. “And I suppose you ate the other,\r\nBruno?”\r\n\r\n“No, I didn't,” Bruno said, carelessly. “Aren't they pretty dindledums,\r\nMister Sir?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, very: but what makes you limp so, my child?”\r\n\r\n“Mine foot's come hurted again!” Bruno mournfully replied. And he sat\r\ndown on the ground, and began nursing it.\r\n\r\nThe Professor held his head between his hands--an attitude that I knew\r\nindicated distraction of mind. “Better rest a minute,” he said. “It may\r\nbe better then--or it may be worse. If only I had some of my medicines\r\nhere! I'm Court-Physician, you know,” he added, aside to me.\r\n\r\n“Shall I go and get you some blackberries, darling?” Sylvie whispered,\r\nwith her arms round his neck; and she kissed away a tear that was\r\ntrickling down his cheek.\r\n\r\nBruno brightened up in a moment. “That are a good plan!” he\r\nexclaimed. “I thinks my foot would come quite unhurted, if I eated a\r\nblackberry--two or three blackberries--six or seven blackberries--”\r\n\r\nSylvie got up hastily. “I'd better go,” she said, aside to me, “before\r\nhe gets into the double figures!”\r\n\r\n“Let me come and help you,” I said. “I can reach higher up than you\r\ncan.”\r\n\r\n“Yes, please,” said Sylvie, putting her hand into mine: and we walked\r\noff together.\r\n\r\n“Bruno loves blackberries,” she said, as we paced slowly along by a tall\r\nhedge, “that looked a promising place for them, and it was so sweet of\r\nhim to make me eat the only one!”\r\n\r\n“Oh, it was you that ate it, then? Bruno didn't seem to like to tell me\r\nabout it.”\r\n\r\n“No; I saw that,” said Sylvie. “He's always afraid of being praised. But\r\nhe made me eat it, really! I would much rather he--oh, what's that?” And\r\nshe clung to my hand, half-frightened, as we came in sight of a hare,\r\nlying on its side with legs stretched out just in the entrance to the\r\nwood.\r\n\r\n“It's a hare, my child. Perhaps it's asleep.”\r\n\r\n“No, it isn't asleep,” Sylvie said, timidly going nearer to look at it:\r\n“it's eyes are open. Is it--is it--her voice dropped to an awestruck\r\nwhisper, is it dead, do you think?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, it's quite dead,” I said, after stooping to examine it. “Poor\r\nthing! I think it's been hunted to death. I know the harriers were out\r\nyesterday. But they haven't touched it. Perhaps they caught sight of\r\nanother, and left it to die of fright and exhaustion.”\r\n\r\n“Hunted to death?” Sylvie repeated to herself, very slowly and sadly. “I\r\nthought hunting was a thing they played at like a game. Bruno and I hunt\r\nsnails: but we never hurt them when we catch them!”\r\n\r\n“Sweet angel!” I thought. “How am I to get the idea of Sport into your\r\ninnocent mind?” And as we stood, hand-in-hand, looking down at the dead\r\nhare, I tried to put the thing into such words as she could understand.\r\n“You know what fierce wild-beasts lions and tigers are?” Sylvie nodded.\r\n“Well, in some countries men have to kill them, to save their own lives,\r\nyou know.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Sylvie: “if one tried to kill me, Bruno would kill it if he\r\ncould.”\r\n\r\n“Well, and so the men--the hunters--get to enjoy it, you know: the\r\nrunning, and the fighting, and the shouting, and the danger.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Sylvie. “Bruno likes danger.”\r\n\r\n“Well, but, in this country, there aren't any lions and tigers, loose:\r\nso they hunt other creatures, you see.” I hoped, but in vain, that this\r\nwould satisfy her, and that she would ask no more questions.\r\n\r\n“They hunt foxes,” Sylvie said, thoughtfully. “And I think they kill\r\nthem, too. Foxes are very fierce. I daresay men don't love them. Are\r\nhares fierce?”\r\n\r\n“No,” I said. “A hare is a sweet, gentle, timid animal--almost as gentle\r\nas a lamb.”\r\n\r\n“But, if men love hares, why--why--” her voice quivered, and her sweet\r\neyes were brimming over with tears.\r\n\r\n“I'm afraid they don't love them, dear child.”\r\n\r\n“All children love them,” Sylvie said. “All ladies love them.”\r\n\r\n“I'm afraid even ladies go to hunt them, sometimes.”\r\n\r\nSylvie shuddered. “Oh, no, not ladies!” she earnestly pleaded. “Not Lady\r\nMuriel!”\r\n\r\n“No, she never does, I'm sure--but this is too sad a sight for you,\r\ndear. Let's try and find some--”\r\n\r\nBut Sylvie was not satisfied yet. In a hushed, solemn tone, with bowed\r\nhead and clasped hands, she put her final question. “Does GOD love\r\nhares?”\r\n\r\n“Yes!” I said. “I'm sure He does! He loves every living thing. Even\r\nsinful men. How much more the animals, that cannot sin!”\r\n\r\n“I don't know what 'sin' means,” said Sylvie. And I didn't try to\r\nexplain it.\r\n\r\n“Come, my child,” I said, trying to lead her away. “Wish good-bye to the\r\npoor hare, and come and look for blackberries.”\r\n\r\n“Good-bye, poor hare!” Sylvie obediently repeated, looking over her\r\nshoulder at it as we turned away. And then, all in a moment, her\r\nself-command gave way. Pulling her hand out of mine, she ran back to\r\nwhere the dead hare was lying, and flung herself down at its side in\r\nsuch an agony of grief as I could hardly have believed possible in so\r\nyoung a child.\r\n\r\n“Oh, my darling, my darling!” she moaned, over and over again. “And God\r\nmeant your life to be so beautiful!”\r\n\r\nSometimes, but always keeping her face hidden on the ground, she would\r\nreach out one little hand, to stroke the poor dead thing, and then once\r\nmore bury her face in her hands, and sob as if her heart would break.\r\n{Image...The dead hare}\r\n\r\nI was afraid she would really make herself ill: still I thought it best\r\nto let her weep away the first sharp agony of grief: and, after a few\r\nminutes, the sobbing gradually ceased, and Sylvie rose to her feet, and\r\nlooked calmly at me, though tears were still streaming down her cheeks.\r\n\r\nI did not dare to speak again, just yet; but simply held out my hand to\r\nher, that we might quit the melancholy spot.\r\n\r\nYes, I'll come now, she said. Very reverently she kneeled down, and\r\nkissed the dead hare; then rose and gave me her hand, and we moved on in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nA child's sorrow is violent but short; and it was almost in her usual\r\nvoice that she said after a minute “Oh stop stop! Here are some lovely\r\nblackberries!”\r\n\r\nWe filled our hands with fruit and returned in all haste to where the\r\nProfessor and Bruno were seated on a bank awaiting our return.\r\n\r\nJust before we came within hearing-distance Sylvie checked me. “Please\r\ndon't tell Bruno about the hare!” she said.\r\n\r\nVery well, my child. But why not?\r\n\r\nTears again glittered in those sweet eyes and she turned her head away\r\nso that I could scarcely hear her reply. “He's--he's very fond of gentle\r\ncreatures you know. And he'd--he'd be so sorry! I don't want him to be\r\nmade sorry.”\r\n\r\nAnd your agony of sorrow is to count for nothing, then, sweet unselfish\r\nchild! I thought to myself. But no more was said till we had reached\r\nour friends; and Bruno was far too much engrossed, in the feast we had\r\nbrought him, to take any notice of Sylvie's unusually grave manner.\r\n\r\n“I'm afraid it's getting rather late, Professor?” I said.\r\n\r\n“Yes, indeed,” said the Professor. “I must take you all through the\r\nIvory Door again. You've stayed your full time.”\r\n\r\n“Mightn't we stay a little longer!” pleaded Sylvie.\r\n\r\n“Just one minute!” added Bruno.\r\n\r\nBut the Professor was unyielding. “It's a great privilege, coming\r\nthrough at all,” he said. “We must go now.” And we followed him\r\nobediently to the Ivory Door, which he threw open, and signed to me to\r\ngo through first.\r\n\r\n“You're coming too, aren't you?” I said to Sylvie.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” she said: “but you won't see us after you've gone through.”\r\n\r\n“But suppose I wait for you outside?” I asked, as I stepped through the\r\ndoorway.\r\n\r\n“In that case,” said Sylvie, “I think the potato would be quite\r\njustified in asking your weight. I can quite imagine a really superior\r\nkidney-potato declining to argue with any one under fifteen stone!”\r\n\r\nWith a great effort I recovered the thread of my thoughts. “We lapse\r\nvery quickly into nonsense!” I said.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 22. CROSSING THE LINE.\r\n\r\n“Let us lapse back again,” said Lady Muriel. “Take another cup of tea? I\r\nhope that's sound common sense?”\r\n\r\n“And all that strange adventure,” I thought, “has occupied the space\r\nof a single comma in Lady Muriel's speech! A single comma, for which\r\ngrammarians tell us to 'count one'!” (I felt no doubt that the Professor\r\nhad kindly put back the time for me, to the exact point at which I had\r\ngone to sleep.)\r\n\r\nWhen, a few minutes afterwards, we left the house, Arthur's first remark\r\nwas certainly a strange one. “We've been there just twenty minutes,” he\r\nsaid, “and I've done nothing but listen to you and Lady Muriel talking:\r\nand yet, somehow, I feel exactly as if I had been talking with her for\r\nan hour at least!”\r\n\r\nAnd so he had been, I felt no doubt: only, as the time had been put back\r\nto the beginning of the tete-a-tete he referred to, the whole of it\r\nhad passed into oblivion, if not into nothingness! But I valued my own\r\nreputation for sanity too highly to venture on explaining to him what\r\nhad happened.\r\n\r\nFor some cause, which I could not at the moment divine, Arthur was\r\nunusually grave and silent during our walk home. It could not be\r\nconnected with Eric Lindon, I thought, as he had for some days been away\r\nin London: so that, having Lady Muriel almost 'all to himself'--for\r\nI was only too glad to hear those two conversing, to have any wish to\r\nintrude any remarks of my own--he ought, theoretically, to have been\r\nspecially radiant and contented with life. “Can he have heard any bad\r\nnews?” I said to myself. And, almost as if he had read my thoughts, he\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n“He will be here by the last train,” he said, in the tone of one who is\r\ncontinuing a conversation rather than beginning one.\r\n\r\n“Captain Lindon, do you mean?”\r\n\r\n“Yes--Captain Lindon,” said Arthur: “I said 'he,' because I fancied\r\nwe were talking about him. The Earl told me he comes tonight, though\r\nto-morrow is the day when he will know about the Commission that he's\r\nhoping for. I wonder he doesn't stay another day to hear the result, if\r\nhe's really so anxious about it as the Earl believes he is.”\r\n\r\n“He can have a telegram sent after him,” I said: “but it's not very\r\nsoldier-like, running away from possible bad news!”\r\n\r\n“He's a very good fellow,” said Arthur: “but I confess it would be good\r\nnews for me, if he got his Commission, and his Marching Orders, all at\r\nonce! I wish him all happiness--with one exception. Good night!” (We had\r\nreached home by this time.) “I'm not good company to-night--better be\r\nalone.”\r\n\r\nIt was much the same, next day. Arthur declared he wasn't fit for\r\nSociety, and I had to set forth alone for an afternoon-stroll. I took\r\nthe road to the Station, and, at the point where the road from the\r\n'Hall' joined it, I paused, seeing my friends in the distance, seemingly\r\nbound for the same goal.\r\n\r\n“Will you join us?” the Earl said, after I had exchanged greetings with\r\nhim, and Lady Muriel, and Captain Lindon. “This restless young man is\r\nexpecting a telegram, and we are going to the Station to meet it.”\r\n\r\n“There is also a restless young woman in the case,” Lady Muriel added.\r\n\r\n“That goes without saying, my child,” said her father. “Women are always\r\nrestless!”\r\n\r\n“For generous appreciation of all one's best qualities,” his daughter\r\nimpressively remarked, “there's nothing to compare with a father, is\r\nthere, Eric?”\r\n\r\n“Cousins are not 'in it,'” said Eric: and then somehow the conversation\r\nlapsed into two duologues, the younger folk taking the lead, and the two\r\nold men following with less eager steps.\r\n\r\n“And when are we to see your little friends again?” said the Earl. “They\r\nare singularly attractive children.”\r\n\r\n“I shall be delighted to bring them, when I can,” I said! “But I don't\r\nknow, myself, when I am likely to see them again.”\r\n\r\n“I'm not going to question you,” said the Earl: “but there's no harm in\r\nmentioning that Muriel is simply tormented with curiosity! We know most\r\nof the people about here, and she has been vainly trying to guess what\r\nhouse they can possibly be staying at.”\r\n\r\n“Some day I may be able to enlighten her: but just at present--”\r\n\r\n“Thanks. She must bear it as best she can. I tell her it's a grand\r\nopportunity for practising patience. But she hardly sees it from that\r\npoint of view. Why, there are the children!”\r\n\r\nSo indeed they were: waiting (for us, apparently) at a stile, which they\r\ncould not have climbed over more than a few moments, as Lady Muriel and\r\nher cousin had passed it without seeing them. On catching sight of us,\r\nBruno ran to meet us, and to exhibit to us, with much pride, the handle\r\nof a clasp-knife--the blade having been broken off--which he had picked\r\nup in the road.\r\n\r\n“And what shall you use it for, Bruno?” I said.\r\n\r\n“Don't know,” Bruno carelessly replied: “must think.”\r\n\r\n“A child's first view of life,” the Earl remarked, with that sweet\r\nsad smile of his, “is that it is a period to be spent in accumulating\r\nportable property. That view gets modified as the years glide away.” And\r\nhe held out his hand to Sylvie, who had placed herself by me, looking a\r\nlittle shy of him.\r\n\r\nBut the gentle old man was not one with whom any child, human or fairy,\r\ncould be shy for long; and she had very soon deserted my hand for\r\nhis--Bruno alone remaining faithful to his first friend. We overtook the\r\nother couple just as they reached the Station, and both Lady Muriel and\r\nEric greeted the children as old friends--the latter with the words “So\r\nyou got to Babylon by candlelight, after all?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, and back again!” cried Bruno.\r\n\r\nLady Muriel looked from one to the other in blank astonishment. “What,\r\nyou know them, Eric?” she exclaimed. “This mystery grows deeper every\r\nday!”\r\n\r\n“Then we must be somewhere in the Third Act,” said Eric. “You don't\r\nexpect the mystery to be cleared up till the Fifth Act, do you?”\r\n\r\n“But it's such a long drama!” was the plaintive reply. “We must have got\r\nto the Fifth Act by this time!”\r\n\r\n“Third Act, I assure you,” said the young soldier mercilessly. “Scene, a\r\nrailway-platform. Lights down. Enter Prince (in disguise, of course)\r\nand faithful Attendant. This is the Prince--” (taking Bruno's hand)\r\n“and here stands his humble Servant! What is your Royal Highness next\r\ncommand?” And he made a most courtier-like low bow to his puzzled little\r\nfriend.\r\n\r\n“Oo're not a Servant!” Bruno scornfully exclaimed. “Oo're a Gemplun!”\r\n\r\n“Servant, I assure your Royal Highness!” Eric respectfully insisted.\r\n“Allow me to mention to your Royal Highness my various situations--past,\r\npresent, and future.”\r\n\r\n“What did oo begin wiz?” Bruno asked, beginning to enter into the jest.\r\n“Was oo a shoe-black?”\r\n\r\n“Lower than that, your Royal Highness! Years ago, I offered myself as\r\na Slave--as a 'Confidential Slave,' I think it's called?” he asked,\r\nturning to Lady Muriel.\r\n\r\nBut Lady Muriel heard him not: something had gone wrong with her glove,\r\nwhich entirely engrossed her attention.\r\n\r\n“Did oo get the place?” said Bruno.\r\n\r\n“Sad to say, Your Royal Highness, I did not! So I had to take a\r\nsituation as--as Waiter, which I have now held for some years haven't\r\nI?” He again glanced at Lady Muriel.\r\n\r\n“Sylvie dear, do help me to button this glove!” Lady Muriel whispered,\r\nhastily stooping down, and failing to hear the question.\r\n\r\n“And what will oo be next?” said Bruno.\r\n\r\n“My next place will, I hope, be that of Groom. And after that--”\r\n\r\n“Don't puzzle the child so!” Lady Muriel interrupted. “What nonsense you\r\ntalk!”\r\n\r\n“--after that,” Eric persisted, “I hope to obtain the situation of\r\nHousekeeper, which--Fourth Act!” he proclaimed, with a sudden change of\r\ntone. “Lights turned up. Red lights. Green lights. Distant rumble heard.\r\nEnter a passenger-train!”\r\n\r\nAnd in another minute the train drew up alongside of the platform, and\r\na stream of passengers began to flow out from the booking office and\r\nwaiting-rooms.\r\n\r\n“Did you ever make real life into a drama?” said the Earl. “Now just\r\ntry. I've often amused myself that way. Consider this platform as\r\nour stage. Good entrances and exits on both sides, you see. Capital\r\nbackground scene: real engine moving up and down. All this bustle, and\r\npeople passing to and fro, must have been most carefully rehearsed! How\r\nnaturally they do it! With never a glance at the audience! And every\r\ngrouping is quite fresh, you see. No repetition!”\r\n\r\nIt really was admirable, as soon as I began to enter into it from this\r\npoint of view. Even a porter passing, with a barrow piled with luggage,\r\nseemed so realistic that one was tempted to applaud. He was followed\r\nby an angry mother, with hot red face, dragging along two screaming\r\nchildren, and calling, to some one behind, “John! Come on!” Enter John,\r\nvery meek, very silent, and loaded with parcels. And he was followed,\r\nin his turn, by a frightened little nursemaid, carrying a fat baby, also\r\nscreaming. All the children screamed.\r\n\r\n“Capital byplay!” said the old man aside. “Did you notice the\r\nnursemaid's look of terror? It was simply perfect!”\r\n\r\n“You have struck quite a new vein,” I said. “To most of us Life and its\r\npleasures seem like a mine that is nearly worked out.”\r\n\r\n“Worked out!” exclaimed the Earl. “For any one with true dramatic\r\ninstincts, it is only the Overture that is ended! The real treat has yet\r\nto begin. You go to a theatre, and pay your ten shillings for a stall,\r\nand what do you get for your money? Perhaps it's a dialogue between a\r\ncouple of farmers--unnatural in their overdone caricature of farmers'\r\ndress--more unnatural in their constrained attitudes and gestures--most\r\nunnatural in their attempts at ease and geniality in their talk. Go\r\ninstead and take a seat in a third-class railway-carriage, and you'll\r\nget the same dialogue done to the life! Front-seats--no orchestra to\r\nblock the view--and nothing to pay!”\r\n\r\n“Which reminds me,” said Eric. “There is nothing to pay on receiving a\r\ntelegram! Shall we enquire for one?” And he and Lady Muriel strolled off\r\nin the direction of the Telegraph-Office.\r\n\r\n“I wonder if Shakespeare had that thought in his mind,” I said, “when he\r\nwrote 'All the world's a stage'?”\r\n\r\nThe old man sighed. “And so it is,” he said, “look at it as you will.\r\nLife is indeed a drama; a drama with but few encores--and no bouquets!”\r\n he added dreamily. “We spend one half of it in regretting the things we\r\ndid in the other half!”\r\n\r\n“And the secret of enjoying it,” he continued, resuming his cheerful\r\ntone, “is intensity!”\r\n\r\n“But not in the modern aesthetic sense, I presume? Like the young lady,\r\nin Punch, who begins a conversation with 'Are you intense?'”\r\n\r\n“By no means!” replied the Earl. “What I mean is intensity of thought--a\r\nconcentrated attention. We lose half the pleasure we might have in Life,\r\nby not really attending. Take any instance you like: it doesn't matter\r\nhow trivial the pleasure may be--the principle is the same. Suppose\r\nA and B are reading the same second-rate circulating-library novel. A\r\nnever troubles himself to master the relationships of the characters, on\r\nwhich perhaps all the interest of the story depends: he 'skips' over all\r\nthe descriptions of scenery, and every passage that looks rather dull:\r\nhe doesn't half attend to the passages he does read: he goes on reading\r\nmerely from want of resolution to find another occupation--for hours\r\nafter he ought to have put the book aside: and reaches the 'FINIS' in a\r\nstate of utter weariness and depression! B puts his whole soul into the\r\nthing--on the principle that 'whatever is worth doing is worth doing\r\nwell': he masters the genealogies: he calls up pictures before his\r\n'mind's eye' as he reads about the scenery: best of all, he resolutely\r\nshuts the book at the end of some chapter, while his interest is yet at\r\nits keenest, and turns to other subjects; so that, when next he allows\r\nhimself an hour at it, it is like a hungry man sitting down to dinner:\r\nand, when the book is finished, he returns to the work of his daily life\r\nlike 'a giant refreshed'!”\r\n\r\n“But suppose the book were really rubbish--nothing to repay attention?”\r\n\r\n“Well, suppose it,” said the Earl. “My theory meets that case, I assure\r\nyou! A never finds out that it is rubbish, but maunders on to the end,\r\ntrying to believe he's enjoying himself. B quietly shuts the book, when\r\nhe's read a dozen pages, walks off to the Library, and changes it for\r\na better! I have yet another theory for adding to the enjoyment of\r\nLife--that is, if I have not exhausted your patience? I'm afraid you\r\nfind me a very garrulous old man.”\r\n\r\n“No indeed!” I exclaimed earnestly. And indeed I felt as if one could\r\nnot easily tire of the sweet sadness of that gentle voice.\r\n\r\n“It is, that we should learn to take our pleasures quickly, and our\r\npains slowly.”\r\n\r\n“But why? I should have put it the other way, myself.”\r\n\r\n“By taking artificial pain--which can be as trivial as you\r\nplease--slowly, the result is that, when real pain comes, however\r\nsevere, all you need do is to let it go at its ordinary pace, and it's\r\nover in a moment!”\r\n\r\n“Very true,” I said, “but how about the pleasure?”\r\n\r\n“Why, by taking it quick, you can get so much more into life. It takes\r\nyou three hours and a half to hear and enjoy an opera. Suppose I can\r\ntake it in, and enjoy it, in half-an-hour. Why, I can enjoy seven\r\noperas, while you are listening; to one!”\r\n\r\n“Always supposing you have an orchestra capable of playing them,” I\r\nsaid. “And that orchestra has yet to be found!”\r\n\r\nThe old man smiled. “I have heard an 'air played,” he said, “and by no\r\nmeans a short one--played right through, variations and all, in three\r\nseconds!”\r\n\r\n“When? And how?” I asked eagerly, with a half-notion that I was dreaming\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n“It was done by a little musical-box,” he quietly replied. “After it had\r\nbeen wound up, the regulator, or something, broke, and it ran down, as I\r\nsaid, in about three seconds. But it must have played all the notes, you\r\nknow!”\r\n\r\n“Did you enjoy it? I asked, with all the severity of a cross-examining\r\nbarrister.\r\n\r\n“No, I didn't!” he candidly confessed. “But then, you know, I hadn't\r\nbeen trained to that kind of music!”\r\n\r\n“I should much like to try your plan,” I said, and, as Sylvie and Bruno\r\nhappened to run up to us at the moment, I left them to keep the Earl\r\ncompany, and strolled along the platform, making each person and event\r\nplay its part in an extempore drama for my especial benefit. “What, is\r\nthe Earl tired of you already?” I said, as the children ran past me.\r\n\r\n“No!” Sylvie replied with great emphasis. “He wants the evening-paper.\r\nSo Bruno's going to be a little news-boy!”\r\n\r\n“Mind you charge a good price for it!” I called after them.\r\n\r\nReturning up the platform, I came upon Sylvie alone. “Well, child,”\r\n I said, “where's your little news-boy? Couldn't he get you an\r\nevening-paper?”\r\n\r\n“He went to get one at the book-stall at the other side,” said Sylvie;\r\n“and he's coming across the line with it--oh, Bruno, you ought to cross\r\nby the bridge!” for the distant thud, thud, of the Express was already\r\naudible.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a look of horror came over her face. “Oh, he's fallen down on\r\nthe rails!” she cried, and darted past me at a speed that quite defied\r\nthe hasty effort I made to stop her.\r\n\r\nBut the wheezy old Station-Master happened to be close behind me: he\r\nwasn't good for much, poor old man, but he was good for this; and,\r\nbefore I could turn round, he had the child clasped in his arms, saved\r\nfrom the certain death she was rushing to. So intent was I in watching\r\nthis scene, that I hardly saw a flying figure in a light grey suit,\r\nwho shot across from the back of the platform, and was on the line in\r\nanother second. So far as one could take note of time in such a moment\r\nof horror, he had about ten clear seconds, before the Express would be\r\nupon him, in which to cross the rails and to pick up Bruno. Whether he\r\ndid so or not it was quite impossible to guess: the next thing one knew\r\nwas that the Express had passed, and that, whether for life or death,\r\nall was over. When the cloud of dust had cleared away, and the line was\r\nonce more visible, we saw with thankful hearts that the child and his\r\ndeliverer were safe.\r\n\r\n“All right!” Eric called to us cheerfully, as he recrossed the line.\r\n“He's more frightened than hurt!”\r\n\r\n{Image...Crossing the line}\r\n\r\nHe lifted the little fellow up into Lady Muriel's arms, and mounted\r\nthe platform as gaily as if nothing had happened: but he was as pale as\r\ndeath, and leaned heavily on the arm I hastily offered him, fearing he\r\nwas about to faint. “I'll just--sit down a moment--” he said dreamily:\r\n“--where's Sylvie?”\r\n\r\nSylvie ran to him, and flung her arms round his neck, sobbing as if her\r\nheart would break. “Don't do that, my darling!” Eric murmured, with a\r\nstrange look in his eyes. “Nothing to cry about now, you know. But you\r\nvery nearly got yourself killed for nothing!”\r\n\r\n“For Bruno!” the little maiden sobbed. “And he would have done it for\r\nme. Wouldn't you, Bruno?”\r\n\r\n“Course I would!” Bruno said, looking round with a bewildered air.\r\n\r\nLady Muriel kissed him in silence as she put him down out of her arms.\r\nThen she beckoned Sylvie to come and take his hand, and signed to\r\nthe children to go back to where the Earl was seated. “Tell him,” she\r\nwhispered with quivering lips, “tell him--all is well!” Then she turned\r\nto the hero of the day. “I thought it was death,” she said. “Thank God,\r\nyou are safe! Did you see how near it was?”\r\n\r\n“I saw there was just time,” Eric said lightly.\r\n\r\n“A soldier must learn to carry his life in his hand, you know. I'm all\r\nright now. Shall we go to the telegraph-office again? I daresay it's\r\ncome by this time.”\r\n\r\nI went to join the Earl and the children, and we waited--almost in\r\nsilence, for no one seemed inclined to talk, and Bruno was half-asleep\r\non Sylvie's lap--till the others joined us. No telegram had come.\r\n\r\n“I'll take a stroll with the children,” I said, feeling that we were a\r\nlittle de trop, “and I'll look in, in the course of the evening.”\r\n\r\n“We must go back into the wood, now,” Sylvie said, as soon as we were\r\nout of hearing. “We ca'n't stay this size any longer.”\r\n\r\n“Then you will be quite tiny Fairies again, next time we meet?”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Sylvie: “but we'll be children again some day--if you'll let\r\nus. Bruno's very anxious to see Lady Muriel again.”\r\n\r\n“She are welly nice,” said Bruno.\r\n\r\n“I shall be very glad to take you to see her again,” I said. “Hadn't I\r\nbetter give you back the Professor's Watch? It'll be too large for you\r\nto carry when you're Fairies, you know.”\r\n\r\nBruno laughed merrily. I was glad to see he had quite recovered from the\r\nterrible scene he had gone through. “Oh no, it won't!” he said. “When we\r\ngo small, it'll go small!”\r\n\r\n“And then it'll go straight to the Professor,” Sylvie added, “and you\r\nwon't be able to use it anymore: so you'd better use it all you can,\r\nnow. We must go small when the sun sets. Good-bye!”\r\n\r\n“Good-bye!” cried Bruno. But their voices sounded very far away, and,\r\nwhen I looked round, both children had disappeared.\r\n\r\n“And it wants only two hours to sunset!” I said as I strolled on. “I\r\nmust make the best of my time!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 23. AN OUTLANDISH WATCH.\r\n\r\nAs I entered the little town, I came upon two of the fishermen's wives\r\ninterchanging that last word “which never was the last”: and it occurred\r\nto me, as an experiment with the Magic Watch, to wait till the little\r\nscene was over, and then to 'encore' it.\r\n\r\n“Well, good night t'ye! And ye winna forget to send us word when your\r\nMartha writes?”\r\n\r\n“Nay, ah winna forget. An' if she isn't suited, she can but coom back.\r\nGood night t'ye!”\r\n\r\nA casual observer might have thought “and there ends the dialogue!” That\r\ncasual observer would have been mistaken.\r\n\r\n“Ah, she'll like 'em, I war'n' ye! They'll not treat her bad, yer may\r\ndepend. They're varry canny fowk. Good night!”\r\n\r\n“Ay, they are that! Good night!”\r\n\r\n“Good night! And ye'll send us word if she writes?”\r\n\r\n“Aye, ah will, yer may depend! Good night t'ye!”\r\n\r\nAnd at last they parted. I waited till they were some twenty yards\r\napart, and then put the Watch a minute back. The instantaneous change\r\nwas startling: the two figures seemed to flash back into their former\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\n“--isn't suited, she can but coom back. Good night t'ye!” one of them\r\nwas saying: and so the whole dialogue was repeated, and, when they\r\nhad parted for the second time, I let them go their several ways, and\r\nstrolled on through the town.\r\n\r\n“But the real usefulness of this magic power,” I thought, “would be to\r\nundo some harm, some painful event, some accident--”\r\n\r\nI had not long to wait for an opportunity of testing this property also\r\nof the Magic Watch, for, even as the thought passed through my mind, the\r\naccident I was imagining occurred. A light cart was standing at the\r\ndoor of the 'Great Millinery Depot' of Elveston, laden with card-board\r\npacking-cases, which the driver was carrying into the shop, one by one.\r\nOne of the cases had fallen into the street, but it scarcely seemed\r\nworth while to step forward and pick it up, as the man would be back\r\nagain in a moment. Yet, in that moment, a young man riding a bicycle\r\ncame sharp round the corner of the street and, in trying to avoid\r\nrunning over the box, upset his machine, and was thrown headlong against\r\nthe wheel of the spring-cart. The driver ran out to his assistance, and\r\nhe and I together raised the unfortunate cyclist and carried him into\r\nthe shop. His head was cut and bleeding; and one knee seemed to be badly\r\ninjured; and it was speedily settled that he had better be conveyed at\r\nonce to the only Surgery in the place. I helped them in emptying the\r\ncart, and placing in it some pillows for the wounded man to rest on; and\r\nit was only when the driver had mounted to his place, and was starting\r\nfor the Surgery, that I bethought me of the strange power I possessed of\r\nundoing all this harm.\r\n\r\n“Now is my time!” I said to myself, as I moved back the hand of the\r\nWatch, and saw, almost without surprise this time, all things restored\r\nto the places they had occupied at the critical moment when I had first\r\nnoticed the fallen packing-case.\r\n\r\nInstantly I stepped out into the street, picked up the box, and replaced\r\nit in the cart: in the next moment the bicycle had spun round the\r\ncorner, passed the cart without let or hindrance, and soon vanished in\r\nthe distance, in a cloud of dust.\r\n\r\n“Delightful power of magic!” I thought. “How much of human suffering I\r\nhave--not only relieved, but actually annihilated!” And, in a glow of\r\nconscious virtue, I stood watching the unloading of the cart, still\r\nholding the Magic Watch open in my hand, as I was curious to see what\r\nwould happen when we again reached the exact time at which I had put\r\nback the hand.\r\n\r\nThe result was one that, if only I had considered the thing carefully,\r\nI might have foreseen: as the hand of the Watch touched the mark, the\r\nspring-cart--which had driven off, and was by this time half-way down\r\nthe street, was back again at the door, and in the act of starting,\r\nwhile--oh woe for the golden dream of world-wide benevolence that had\r\ndazzled my dreaming fancy!--the wounded youth was once more reclining\r\non the heap of pillows, his pale face set rigidly in the hard lines that\r\ntold of pain resolutely endured.\r\n\r\n“Oh mocking Magic Watch!” I said to myself, as I passed out of the\r\nlittle town, and took the seaward road that led to my lodgings. “The\r\ngood I fancied I could do is vanished like a dream: the evil of this\r\ntroublesome world is the only abiding reality!”\r\n\r\nAnd now I must record an experience so strange, that I think it only\r\nfair, before beginning to relate it, to release my much-enduring reader\r\nfrom any obligation he may feel to believe this part of my story. I\r\nwould not have believed it, I freely confess, if I had not seen it\r\nwith my own eyes: then why should I expect it of my reader, who, quite\r\npossibly, has never seen anything of the sort?\r\n\r\nI was passing a pretty little villa, which stood rather back from the\r\nroad, in its own grounds, with bright flower-beds in front---creepers\r\nwandering over the walls and hanging in festoons about the\r\nbow-windows--an easy-chair forgotten on the lawn, with a newspaper lying\r\nnear it--a small pug-dog “couchant” before it, resolved to guard the\r\ntreasure even at the sacrifice of life--and a front-door standing\r\ninvitingly half-open. “Here is my chance,” I thought, “for testing the\r\nreverse action of the Magic Watch!” I pressed the 'reversal-peg' and\r\nwalked in. In another house, the entrance of a stranger might cause\r\nsurprise--perhaps anger, even going so far as to expel the said stranger\r\nwith violence: but here, I knew, nothing of the sort could happen.\r\nThe ordinary course of events first, to think nothing about me; then,\r\nhearing my footsteps to look up and see me; and then to wonder what\r\nbusiness I had there--would be reversed by the action of my Watch. They\r\nwould first wonder who I was, then see me, then look down, and think no\r\nmore about me. And as to being expelled with violence, that event would\r\nnecessarily come first in this case. “So, if I can once get in,” I said\r\nto myself, “all risk of expulsion will be over!”\r\n\r\n{Image...'The pug-dog sat up'}\r\n\r\nThe pug-dog sat up, as a precautionary measure, as I passed; but, as I\r\ntook no notice of the treasure he was guarding, he let me go by without\r\neven one remonstrant bark. “He that takes my life,” he seemed to be\r\nsaying, wheezily, to himself, “takes trash: But he that takes the Daily\r\nTelegraph--!” But this awful contingency I did not face.\r\n\r\nThe party in the drawing-room--I had walked straight in, you understand,\r\nwithout ringing the bell, or giving any notice of my approach--consisted\r\nof four laughing rosy children, of ages from about fourteen down to ten,\r\nwho were, apparently, all coming towards the door (I found they were\r\nreally walking backwards), while their mother, seated by the fire with\r\nsome needlework on her lap, was saying, just as I entered the room,\r\n“Now, girls, you may get your things on for a walk.”\r\n\r\nTo my utter astonishment--for I was not yet accustomed to the action\r\nof the Watch “all smiles ceased,” (as Browning says) on the four pretty\r\nfaces, and they all got out pieces of needle-work, and sat down. No one\r\nnoticed me in the least, as I quietly took a chair and sat down to watch\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nWhen the needle-work had been unfolded, and they were all ready to\r\nbegin, their mother said “Come, that's done, at last! You may fold\r\nup your work, girls.” But the children took no notice whatever of the\r\nremark; on the contrary, they set to work at once sewing--if that is\r\nthe proper word to describe an operation such as I had never before\r\nwitnessed. Each of them threaded her needle with a short end of thread\r\nattached to the work, which was instantly pulled by an invisible force\r\nthrough the stuff, dragging the needle after it: the nimble fingers of\r\nthe little sempstress caught it at the other side, but only to lose it\r\nagain the next moment. And so the work went on, steadily undoing itself,\r\nand the neatly-stitched little dresses, or whatever they were, steadily\r\nfalling to pieces. Now and then one of the children would pause, as the\r\nrecovered thread became inconveniently long, wind it on a bobbin, and\r\nstart again with another short end.\r\n\r\nAt last all the work was picked to pieces and put away, and the lady\r\nled the way into the next room, walking backwards, and making the insane\r\nremark “Not yet, dear: we must get the sewing done first.” After which,\r\nI was not surprised to see the children skipping backwards after her,\r\nexclaiming “Oh, mother, it is such a lovely day for a walk!”\r\n\r\nIn the dining-room, the table had only dirty plates and empty dishes\r\non it. However the party--with the addition of a gentleman, as\r\ngood-natured, and as rosy, as the children--seated themselves at it very\r\ncontentedly.\r\n\r\nYou have seen people eating cherry-tart, and every now and then\r\ncautiously conveying a cherry-stone from their lips to their plates?\r\nWell, something like that went on all through this ghastly--or shall we\r\nsay 'ghostly'?---banquet. An empty fork is raised to the lips: there\r\nit receives a neatly-cut piece of mutton, and swiftly conveys it to the\r\nplate, where it instantly attaches itself to the mutton already there.\r\nSoon one of the plates, furnished with a complete slice of mutton and\r\ntwo potatoes, was handed up to the presiding gentleman, who quietly\r\nreplaced the slice on the joint, and the potatoes in the dish.\r\n\r\nTheir conversation was, if possible, more bewildering than their mode of\r\ndining. It began by the youngest girl suddenly, and without provocation,\r\naddressing her eldest sister. “Oh, you wicked story-teller!” she said.\r\n\r\nI expected a sharp reply from the sister; but, instead of this, she\r\nturned laughingly to her father, and said, in a very loud stage-whisper,\r\n“To be a bride!”\r\n\r\nThe father, in order to do his part in a conversation that seemed only\r\nfit for lunatics, replied “Whisper it to me, dear.”\r\n\r\nBut she didn't whisper (these children never did anything they were\r\ntold): she said, quite loud, “Of course not! Everybody knows what Dotty\r\nwants!”\r\n\r\nAnd little Dolly shrugged her shoulders, and said, with a pretty\r\npettishness, “Now, Father, you're not to tease! You know I don't want to\r\nbe bride's-maid to anybody!”\r\n\r\n“And Dolly's to be the fourth,” was her father's idiotic reply.\r\n\r\nHere Number Three put in her oar. “Oh, it is settled, Mother dear,\r\nreally and truly! Mary told us all about it. It's to be next\r\nTuesday four weeks--and three of her cousins are coming; to be\r\nbride's-maids--and--”\r\n\r\n“She doesn't forget it, Minnie!” the Mother laughingly replied. “I do\r\nwish they'd get it settled! I don't like long engagements.”\r\n\r\nAnd Minnie wound up the conversation--if so chaotic a series of remarks\r\ndeserves the name--with “Only think! We passed the Cedars this morning,\r\njust exactly as Mary Davenant was standing at the gate, wishing good-bye\r\nto Mister---I forget his name. Of course we looked the other way.”\r\n\r\nBy this time I was so hopelessly confused that I gave up listening, and\r\nfollowed the dinner down into the kitchen.\r\n\r\nBut to you, O hypercritical reader, resolute to believe no item of this\r\nweird adventure, what need to tell how the mutton was placed on the\r\nspit, and slowly unroasted--how the potatoes were wrapped in their\r\nskins, and handed over to the gardener to be buried--how, when the\r\nmutton had at length attained to rawness, the fire, which had gradually\r\nchanged from red-heat to a mere blaze, died down so suddenly that\r\nthe cook had only just time to catch its last flicker on the end of a\r\nmatch--or how the maid, having taken the mutton off the spit, carried\r\nit (backwards, of course) out of the house, to meet the butcher, who was\r\ncoming (also backwards) down the road?\r\n\r\nThe longer I thought over this strange adventure, the more hopelessly\r\ntangled the mystery became: and it was a real relief to meet Arthur in\r\nthe road, and get him to go with me up to the Hall, to learn what news\r\nthe telegraph had brought. I told him, as we went, what had happened at\r\nthe Station, but as to my further adventures I thought it best, for the\r\npresent, to say nothing.\r\n\r\nThe Earl was sitting alone when we entered. “I am glad you are come in\r\nto keep me company,” he said. “Muriel is gone to bed--the excitement of\r\nthat terrible scene was too much for her--and Eric has gone to the hotel\r\nto pack his things, to start for London by the early train.”\r\n\r\n“Then the telegram has come?” I said.\r\n\r\n“Did you not hear? Oh, I had forgotten: it came in after you left the\r\nStation. Yes, it's all right: Eric has got his commission; and, now that\r\nhe has arranged matters with Muriel, he has business in town that must\r\nbe seen to at once.”\r\n\r\n“What arrangement do you mean?” I asked with a sinking heart, as the\r\nthought of Arthur's crushed hopes came to my mind. “Do you mean that\r\nthey are engaged?”\r\n\r\n“They have been engaged--in a sense--for two years,” the old man gently\r\nreplied: “that is, he has had my promise to consent to it, so soon as\r\nhe could secure a permanent and settled line in life. I could never\r\nbe happy with my child married to a man without an object to live\r\nfor--without even an object to die for!”\r\n\r\n“I hope they will be happy,” a strange voice said. The speaker was\r\nevidently in the room, but I had not heard the door open, and I looked\r\nround in some astonishment. The Earl seemed to share my surprise. “Who\r\nspoke?” he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“It was I,” said Arthur, looking at us with a worn, haggard face, and\r\neyes from which the light of life seemed suddenly to have faded. “And\r\nlet me wish you joy also, dear friend,” he added, looking sadly at the\r\nEarl, and speaking in the same hollow tones that had startled us so\r\nmuch.\r\n\r\n“Thank you,” the old man said, simply and heartily.\r\n\r\nA silence followed: then I rose, feeling sure that Arthur would wish to\r\nbe alone, and bade our gentle host 'Good night': Arthur took his hand,\r\nbut said nothing: nor did he speak again, as we went home till we were\r\nin the house and had lit our bed-room candles. Then he said more to\r\nhimself than to me, “The heart knoweth its own bitterness. I never\r\nunderstood those words till now.”\r\n\r\nThe next few days passed wearily enough. I felt no inclination to call\r\nby myself at the Hall; still less to propose that Arthur should go\r\nwith me: it seemed better to wait till Time--that gentle healer of our\r\nbitterest sorrows should have helped him to recover from the first shock\r\nof the disappointment that had blighted his life.\r\n\r\nBusiness however soon demanded my presence in town; and I had to\r\nannounce to Arthur that I must leave him for a while. “But I hope to run\r\ndown again in a month,” I added. “I would stay now, if I could. I don't\r\nthink it's good for you to be alone.”\r\n\r\n“No, I ca'n't face solitude, here, for long,” said Arthur. “But don't\r\nthink about me. I have made up my mind to accept a post in India, that\r\nhas been offered me. Out there, I suppose I shall find something to live\r\nfor; I ca'n't see anything at present. 'This life of mine I guard, as\r\nGod's high gift, from scathe and wrong, Not greatly care to lose!'”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” I said: “your name-sake bore as heavy a blow, and lived through\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“A far heavier one than mine,” said Arthur. “The woman he loved proved\r\nfalse. There is no such cloud as that on my memory of--of--” He left the\r\nname unuttered, and went on hurriedly. “But you will return, will you\r\nnot?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I shall come back for a short time.”\r\n\r\n“Do,” said Arthur: “and you shall write and tell me of our friends. I'll\r\nsend you my address when I'm settled down.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 24. THE FROGS' BIRTHDAY-TREAT.\r\n\r\nAnd so it came to pass that, just a week after the day when my\r\nFairy-friends first appeared as Children, I found myself taking a\r\nfarewell-stroll through the wood, in the hope of meeting them once more.\r\nI had but to stretch myself on the smooth turf, and the 'eerie' feeling\r\nwas on me in a moment.\r\n\r\n“Put oor ear welly low down,” said Bruno, “and I'll tell oo a secret!\r\nIt's the Frogs' Birthday-Treat--and we've lost the Baby!”\r\n\r\n“What Baby?” I said, quite bewildered by this complicated piece of news.\r\n\r\n“The Queen's Baby, a course!” said Bruno. “Titania's Baby. And we's\r\nwelly sorry. Sylvie, she's--oh so sorry!”\r\n\r\n“How sorry is she?” I asked, mischievously.\r\n\r\n“Three-quarters of a yard,” Bruno replied with perfect solemnity. “And\r\nI'm a little sorry too,” he added, shutting his eyes so as not to see\r\nthat he was smiling.\r\n\r\n“And what are you doing about the Baby?”\r\n\r\n“Well, the soldiers are all looking for it--up and down everywhere.”\r\n\r\n“The soldiers?” I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Yes, a course!” said Bruno. “When there's no fighting to be done, the\r\nsoldiers doos any little odd jobs, oo know.”\r\n\r\nI was amused at the idea of its being a 'little odd job' to find the\r\nRoyal Baby. “But how did you come to lose it?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“We put it in a flower,” Sylvie, who had just joined us, explained with\r\nher eyes full of tears. “Only we ca'n't remember which!”\r\n\r\n“She says us put it in a flower,” Bruno interrupted, “'cause she doosn't\r\nwant I to get punished. But it were really me what put it there. Sylvie\r\nwere picking Dindledums.”\r\n\r\n{Image...The queen's baby}\r\n\r\n“You shouldn't say 'us put it in a flower',” Sylvie very gravely\r\nremarked.\r\n\r\n“Well, hus, then,” said Bruno. “I never can remember those horrid H's!”\r\n\r\n“Let me help you to look for it,” I said. So Sylvie and I made a 'voyage\r\nof discovery' among all the flowers; but there was no Baby to be seen.\r\n\r\n“What's become of Bruno?” I said, when we had completed our tour.\r\n\r\n“He's down in the ditch there,” said Sylvie, “amusing a young Frog.”\r\n\r\nI went down on my hands and knees to look for him, for I felt very\r\ncurious to know how young Frogs ought to be amused. After a minute's\r\nsearch, I found him sitting at the edge of the ditch, by the side of the\r\nlittle Frog, and looking rather disconsolate.\r\n\r\n“How are you getting on, Bruno?” I said, nodding to him as he looked up.\r\n\r\n“Ca'n't amuse it no more,” Bruno answered, very dolefully, “'cause\r\nit won't say what it would like to do next! I've showed it all\r\nthe duck-weeds--and a live caddis-worm----but it won't say nuffin!\r\nWhat--would oo like?'” he shouted into the ear of the Frog: but the\r\nlittle creature sat quite still, and took no notice of him. “It's deaf,\r\nI think!” Bruno said, turning away with a sigh. “And it's time to get\r\nthe Theatre ready.”\r\n\r\n“Who are the audience to be?”\r\n\r\n“Only but Frogs,” said Bruno. “But they haven't comed yet. They wants to\r\nbe drove up, like sheep.”\r\n\r\n“Would it save time,” I suggested, “if I were to walk round with Sylvie,\r\nto drive up the Frogs, while you get the Theatre ready?”\r\n\r\n“That are a good plan!” cried Bruno. “But where are Sylvie?”\r\n\r\n“I'm here!” said Sylvie, peeping over the edge of the bank. “I was just\r\nwatching two Frogs that were having a race.”\r\n\r\n“Which won it?” Bruno eagerly inquired.\r\n\r\nSylvie was puzzled. “He does ask such hard questions!” she confided to\r\nme.\r\n\r\n“And what's to happen in the Theatre?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“First they have their Birthday-Feast,” Sylvie said: “then Bruno does\r\nsome Bits of Shakespeare; then he tells them a Story.”\r\n\r\n“I should think the Frogs like the Feast best. Don't they?”\r\n\r\n“Well, there's generally very few of them that get any. They will keep\r\ntheir mouths shut so tight! And it's just as well they do,” she added,\r\n“because Bruno likes to cook it himself: and he cooks very queerly. Now\r\nthey're all in. Would you just help me to put them with their heads the\r\nright way?”\r\n\r\nWe soon managed this part of the business, though the Frogs kept up a\r\nmost discontented croaking all the time.\r\n\r\n“What are they saying?” I asked Sylvie.\r\n\r\n“They're saying 'Fork! Fork!' It's very silly of them! You're not going\r\nto have forks!” she announced with some severity. “Those that want any\r\nFeast have just got to open their mouths, and Bruno 'll put some of it\r\nin!”\r\n\r\nAt this moment Bruno appeared, wearing a little white apron to show that\r\nhe was a Cook, and carrying a tureen full of very queer-looking soup.\r\nI watched very carefully as he moved about among the Frogs; but I could\r\nnot see that any of them opened their mouths to be fed--except one\r\nvery young one, and I'm nearly sure it did it accidentally, in yawning.\r\nHowever Bruno instantly put a large spoonful of soup into its mouth, and\r\nthe poor little thing coughed violently for some time.\r\n\r\nSo Sylvie and I had to share the soup between us, and to pretend to\r\nenjoy it, for it certainly was very queerly cooked.\r\n\r\nI only ventured to take one spoonful of it (“Sylvie's Summer-Soup,”\r\n Bruno said it was), and must candidly confess that it was not at all\r\nnice; and I could not feel surprised that so many of the guests had kept\r\ntheir mouths shut up tight.\r\n\r\n“What's the soup made of, Bruno?” said Sylvie, who had put a spoonful of\r\nit to her lips, and was making a wry face over it.\r\n\r\nAnd Bruno's answer was anything but encouraging. “Bits of things!”\r\n\r\nThe entertainment was to conclude with “Bits of Shakespeare,” as Sylvie\r\nexpressed it, which were all to be done by Bruno, Sylvie being fully\r\nengaged in making the Frogs keep their heads towards the stage: after\r\nwhich Bruno was to appear in his real character, and tell them a Story\r\nof his own invention.\r\n\r\n“Will the Story have a Moral to it?” I asked Sylvie, while Bruno was\r\naway behind the hedge, dressing for the first 'Bit.'\r\n\r\n“I think so,” Sylvie replied doubtfully. “There generally is a Moral,\r\nonly he puts it in too soon.”\r\n\r\n“And will he say all the Bits of Shakespeare?”\r\n\r\n“No, he'll only act them,” said Sylvie. “He knows hardly any of the\r\nwords. When I see what he's dressed like, I've to tell the Frogs what\r\ncharacter it is. They're always in such a hurry to guess! Don't you\r\nhear them all saying 'What? What?'” And so indeed they were: it had only\r\nsounded like croaking, till Sylvie explained it, but I could now make\r\nout the “Wawt? Wawt?” quite distinctly.\r\n\r\n“But why do they try to guess it before they see it?”\r\n\r\n“I don't know,” Sylvie said: “but they always do. Sometimes they begin\r\nguessing weeks and weeks before the day!”\r\n\r\n(So now, when you hear the Frogs croaking in a particularly melancholy\r\nway, you may be sure they're trying to guess Bruno's next Shakespeare\r\n'Bit'. Isn't that interesting?)\r\n\r\nHowever, the chorus of guessing was cut short by Bruno, who suddenly\r\nrushed on from behind the scenes, and took a flying leap down among the\r\nFrogs, to re-arrange them.\r\n\r\nFor the oldest and fattest Frog--who had never been properly arranged so\r\nthat he could see the stage, and so had no idea what was going on--was\r\ngetting restless, and had upset several of the Frogs, and turned others\r\nround with their heads the wrong way. And it was no good at all, Bruno\r\nsaid, to do a 'Bit' of Shakespeare when there was nobody to look at it\r\n(you see he didn't count me as anybody). So he set to work with a stick,\r\nstirring them up, very much as you would stir up tea in a cup, till most\r\nof them had at least one great stupid eye gazing at the stage.\r\n\r\n“Oo must come and sit among them, Sylvie,” he said in despair, “I've\r\nput these two side-by-side, with their noses the same way, ever so many\r\ntimes, but they do squarrel so!”\r\n\r\nSo Sylvie took her place as 'Mistress of the Ceremonies,' and Bruno\r\nvanished again behind the scenes, to dress for the first 'Bit.'\r\n\r\n“Hamlet!” was suddenly proclaimed, in the clear sweet tones I knew so\r\nwell. The croaking all ceased in a moment, and I turned to the stage,\r\nin some curiosity to see what Bruno's ideas were as to the behaviour of\r\nShakespeare's greatest Character.\r\n\r\nAccording to this eminent interpreter of the Drama, Hamlet wore a short\r\nblack cloak (which he chiefly used for muffling up his face, as if he\r\nsuffered a good deal from toothache), and turned out his toes very much\r\nas he walked. “To be or not to be!” Hamlet remarked in a cheerful tone,\r\nand then turned head-over-heels several times, his cloak dropping off in\r\nthe performance.\r\n\r\nI felt a little disappointed: Bruno's conception of the part seemed so\r\nwanting in dignity. “Won't he say any more of the speech?” I whispered\r\nto Sylvie.\r\n\r\n“I think not,” Sylvie whispered in reply. “He generally turns\r\nhead-over-heels when he doesn't know any more words.”\r\n\r\nBruno had meanwhile settled the question by disappearing from the stage;\r\nand the Frogs instantly began inquiring the name of the next Character.\r\n\r\n“You'll know directly!” cried Sylvie, as she adjusted two or three young\r\nFrogs that had struggled round with their backs to the stage. “Macbeth!”\r\n she added, as Bruno re-appeared.\r\n\r\nMacbeth had something twisted round him, that went over one shoulder and\r\nunder the other arm, and was meant, I believe, for a Scotch plaid. He\r\nhad a thorn in his hand, which he held out at arm's length, as if he\r\nwere a little afraid of it. “Is this a dagger?” Macbeth inquired, in a\r\npuzzled sort of tone: and instantly a chorus of “Thorn! Thorn!” arose\r\nfrom the Frogs (I had quite learned to understand their croaking by this\r\ntime).\r\n\r\n“It's a dagger!” Sylvie proclaimed in a peremptory tone. “Hold your\r\ntongues!” And the croaking ceased at once.\r\n\r\nShakespeare has not told us, so far as I know, that Macbeth had any such\r\neccentric habit as turning head-over-heels in private life: but Bruno\r\nevidently considered it quite an essential part of the character, and\r\nleft the stage in a series of somersaults. However, he was back again\r\nin a few moments, having tucked under his chin the end of a tuft of\r\nwool (probably left on the thorn by a wandering sheep), which made a\r\nmagnificent beard, that reached nearly down to his feet.\r\n\r\n“Shylock!” Sylvie proclaimed. “No, I beg your pardon!” she hastily\r\ncorrected herself, “King Lear! I hadn't noticed the crown.” (Bruno had\r\nvery cleverly provided one, which fitted him exactly, by cutting out the\r\ncentre of a dandelion to make room for his head.)\r\n\r\nKing Lear folded his arms (to the imminent peril of his beard) and said,\r\nin a mild explanatory tone, “Ay, every inch a king!” and then paused,\r\nas if to consider how this could best be proved. And here, with all\r\npossible deference to Bruno as a Shakespearian critic, I must express my\r\nopinion that the poet did not mean his three great tragic heroes to be\r\nso strangely alike in their personal habits; nor do I believe that he\r\nwould have accepted the faculty of turning head-over-heels as any proof\r\nat all of royal descent. Yet it appeared that King Lear, after deep\r\nmeditation, could think of no other argument by which to prove his\r\nkingship: and, as this was the last of the 'Bits' of Shakespeare (“We\r\nnever do more than three,” Sylvie explained in a whisper), Bruno gave\r\nthe audience quite a long series of somersaults before he finally\r\nretired, leaving the enraptured Frogs all crying out “More! More!” which\r\nI suppose was their way of encoring a performance. But Bruno wouldn't\r\nappear again, till the proper time came for telling the Story.\r\n\r\n{Image...The frogs' birthday-treat}\r\n\r\nWhen he appeared at last in his real character, I noticed a remarkable\r\nchange in his behaviour.\r\n\r\nHe tried no more somersaults. It was clearly his opinion that, however\r\nsuitable the habit of turning head-over-heels might be to such petty\r\nindividuals as Hamlet and King Lear, it would never do for Bruno to\r\nsacrifice his dignity to such an extent. But it was equally clear that\r\nhe did not feel entirely at his ease, standing all alone on the stage,\r\nwith no costume to disguise him: and though he began, several times,\r\n“There were a Mouse--,” he kept glancing up and down, and on all sides,\r\nas if in search of more comfortable quarters from which to tell the\r\nStory. Standing on one side of the stage, and partly overshadowing it,\r\nwas a tall foxglove, which seemed, as the evening breeze gently swayed\r\nit hither and thither, to offer exactly the sort of accommodation that\r\nthe orator desired. Having once decided on his quarters, it needed only\r\na second or two for him to run up the stem like a tiny squirrel, and\r\nto seat himself astride on the topmost bend, where the fairy-bells\r\nclustered most closely, and from whence he could look down on his\r\naudience from such a height that all shyness vanished, and he began his\r\nStory merrily.\r\n\r\n“Once there were a Mouse and a Crocodile and a Man and a Goat and a\r\nLion.” I had never heard the 'dramatis personae' tumbled into a story\r\nwith such profusion and in such reckless haste; and it fairly took my\r\nbreath away. Even Sylvie gave a little gasp, and allowed three of the\r\nFrogs, who seemed to be getting tired of the entertainment, to hop away\r\ninto the ditch, without attempting to stop them.\r\n\r\n“And the Mouse found a Shoe, and it thought it were a Mouse-trap. So it\r\ngot right in, and it stayed in ever so long.”\r\n\r\n“Why did it stay in?” said Sylvie. Her function seemed to be much the\r\nsame as that of the Chorus in a Greek Play: she had to encourage the\r\norator, and draw him out, by a series of intelligent questions.\r\n\r\n“'Cause it thought it couldn't get out again,” Bruno explained. “It were\r\na clever mouse. It knew it couldn't get out of traps!”\r\n\r\n“But why did it go in at all?” said Sylvie.\r\n\r\n“--and it jamp, and it jamp,” Bruno proceeded, ignoring this question,\r\n“and at last it got right out again. And it looked at the mark in the\r\nShoe. And the Man's name were in it. So it knew it wasn't its own Shoe.”\r\n\r\n“Had it thought it was?” said Sylvie.\r\n\r\n“Why, didn't I tell oo it thought it were a Mouse-trap?” the indignant\r\norator replied. “Please, Mister Sir, will oo make Sylvie attend?” Sylvie\r\nwas silenced, and was all attention: in fact, she and I were most of the\r\naudience now, as the Frogs kept hopping away, and there were very few of\r\nthem left.\r\n\r\n“So the Mouse gave the Man his Shoe. And the Man were welly glad, cause\r\nhe hadn't got but one Shoe, and he were hopping to get the other.”\r\n\r\nHere I ventured on a question. “Do you mean 'hopping,' or 'hoping'?”\r\n\r\n“Bofe,” said Bruno. “And the Man took the Goat out of the Sack.” (“We\r\nhaven't heard of the sack before,” I said. “Nor you won't hear of it\r\nagain,” said Bruno). “And he said to the Goat, 'Oo will walk about here\r\ntill I comes back.' And he went and he tumbled into a deep hole. And the\r\nGoat walked round and round. And it walked under the Tree. And it wug\r\nits tail. And it looked up in the Tree. And it sang a sad little Song.\r\nOo never heard such a sad little Song!”\r\n\r\n“Can you sing it, Bruno?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“Iss, I can,” Bruno readily replied. “And I sa'n't. It would make Sylvie\r\ncry--”\r\n\r\n“It wouldn't!,” Sylvie interrupted in great indignation. “And I don't\r\nbelieve the Goat sang it at all!”\r\n\r\n“It did, though!” said Bruno. “It singed it right froo. I sawed it\r\nsinging with its long beard--”\r\n\r\n“It couldn't sing with its beard,” I said, hoping to puzzle the little\r\nfellow: “a beard isn't a voice.”\r\n\r\n“Well then, oo couldn't walk with Sylvie!” Bruno cried triumphantly.\r\n“Sylvie isn't a foot!”\r\n\r\nI thought I had better follow Sylvie's example, and be silent for a\r\nwhile. Bruno was too sharp for us.\r\n\r\n“And when it had singed all the Song, it ran away--for to get along to\r\nlook for the Man, oo know. And the Crocodile got along after it--for to\r\nbite it, oo know. And the Mouse got along after the Crocodile.”\r\n\r\n“Wasn't the Crocodile running?” Sylvie enquired. She appealed to me.\r\n“Crocodiles do run, don't they?”\r\n\r\nI suggested “crawling” as the proper word.\r\n\r\n“He wasn't running,” said Bruno, “and he wasn't crawling. He went\r\nstruggling along like a portmanteau. And he held his chin ever so high\r\nin the air--”\r\n\r\n“What did he do that for?” said Sylvie.\r\n\r\n“'cause he hadn't got a toofache!” said Bruno. “Ca'n't oo make out\r\nnuffin wizout I 'splain it? Why, if he'd had a toofache, a course he'd\r\nhave held his head down--like this--and he'd have put a lot of warm\r\nblankets round it!”\r\n\r\n“If he'd had any blankets,” Sylvie argued.\r\n\r\n“Course he had blankets!” retorted her brother. “Doos oo think\r\nCrocodiles goes walks wizout blankets? And he frowned with his eyebrows.\r\nAnd the Goat was welly flightened at his eyebrows!”\r\n\r\n“I'd never be afraid of eyebrows!” exclaimed Sylvie.\r\n\r\n“I should think oo would, though, if they'd got a Crocodile fastened to\r\nthem, like these had! And so the Man jamp, and he jamp, and at last he\r\ngot right out of the hole.”\r\n\r\nSylvie gave another little gasp: this rapid dodging about among the\r\ncharacters of the Story had taken away her breath.\r\n\r\n“And he runned away for to look for the Goat, oo know. And he heard the\r\nLion grunting---”\r\n\r\n“Lions don't grunt,” said Sylvie.\r\n\r\n“This one did,” said Bruno. “And its mouth were like a large cupboard.\r\nAnd it had plenty of room in its mouth. And the Lion runned after the\r\nMan for to eat him, oo know. And the Mouse runned after the Lion.”\r\n\r\n“But the Mouse was running after the Crocodile,” I said: “he couldn't\r\nrun after both!”\r\n\r\nBruno sighed over the density of his audience, but explained very\r\npatiently. “He did runned after bofe: 'cause they went the same way! And\r\nfirst he caught the Crocodile, and then he didn't catch the Lion. And\r\nwhen he'd caught the Crocodile, what doos oo think he did--'cause he'd\r\ngot pincers in his pocket?”\r\n\r\n“I ca'n't guess,” said Sylvie.\r\n\r\n{Image...'He wrenched out that crocodile's toof!'}\r\n\r\n“Nobody couldn't guess it!” Bruno cried in high glee. “Why, he wrenched\r\nout that Crocodile's toof!”\r\n\r\n“Which tooth?” I ventured to ask.\r\n\r\nBut Bruno was not to be puzzled. “The toof he were going to bite the\r\nGoat with, a course!”\r\n\r\n“He couldn't be sure about that,” I argued, “unless he wrenched out all\r\nits teeth.”\r\n\r\nBruno laughed merrily, and half sang, as he swung himself backwards and\r\nforwards, “He did--wrenched--out--all its teef!”\r\n\r\n“Why did the Crocodile wait to have them wrenched out?” said Sylvie.\r\n\r\n“It had to wait,” said Bruno.\r\n\r\nI ventured on another question. “But what became of the Man who said\r\n'You may wait here till I come back'?”\r\n\r\n“He didn't say 'Oo may,'” Bruno explained. “He said, 'Oo will.' Just\r\nlike Sylvie says to me 'Oo will do oor lessons till twelve o'clock.' Oh,\r\nI wiss,” he added with a little sigh, “I wiss Sylvie would say 'Oo may\r\ndo oor lessons'!”\r\n\r\nThis was a dangerous subject for discussion, Sylvie seemed to think. She\r\nreturned to the Story. “But what became of the Man?”\r\n\r\n“Well, the Lion springed at him. But it came so slow, it were three\r\nweeks in the air--”\r\n\r\n“Did the Man wait for it all that time?” I said.\r\n\r\n“Course he didn't!” Bruno replied, gliding head-first down the stem of\r\nthe fox-glove, for the Story was evidently close to its end. “He sold\r\nhis house, and he packed up his things, while the Lion were coming. And\r\nhe went and he lived in another town. So the Lion ate the wrong man.”\r\n\r\nThis was evidently the Moral: so Sylvie made her final proclamation to\r\nthe Frogs. “The Story's finished! And whatever is to be learned from\r\nit,” she added, aside to me, “I'm sure I don't know!”\r\n\r\nI did not feel quite clear about it myself, so made no suggestion: but\r\nthe Frogs seemed quite content, Moral or no Moral, and merely raised a\r\nhusky chorus of “Off! Off!” as they hopped away.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER 25. LOOKING EASTWARD.\r\n\r\n“It's just a week,” I said, three days later, to Arthur, “since we heard\r\nof Lady Muriel's engagement. I think I ought to call, at any rate, and\r\noffer my congratulations. Won't you come with me?”\r\n\r\nA pained expression passed over his face.\r\n\r\n“When must you leave us?” he asked.\r\n\r\n“By the first train on Monday.”\r\n\r\n“Well--yes, I will come with you. It would seem strange and unfriendly\r\nif I didn't. But this is only Friday. Give me till Sunday afternoon. I\r\nshall be stronger then.”\r\n\r\nShading his eyes with one hand, as if half-ashamed of the tears that\r\nwere coursing down his cheeks, he held the other out to me. It trembled\r\nas I clasped it.\r\n\r\nI tried to frame some words of sympathy; but they seemed poor and cold,\r\nand I left them unspoken. “Good night!” was all I said.\r\n\r\n“Good night, dear friend!” he replied. There was a manly vigour in his\r\ntone that convinced me he was wrestling with, and triumphing over,\r\nthe great sorrow that had so nearly wrecked his life--and that, on the\r\nstepping-stone of his dead self, he would surely rise to higher things!\r\n\r\nThere was no chance, I was glad to think, as we set out on Sunday\r\nafternoon, of meeting Eric at the Hall, as he had returned to town\r\nthe day after his engagement was announced. His presence might have\r\ndisturbed the calm--the almost unnatural calm--with which Arthur met\r\nthe woman who had won his heart, and murmured the few graceful words of\r\nsympathy that the occasion demanded.\r\n\r\nLady Muriel was perfectly radiant with happiness: sadness could not live\r\nin the light of such a smile: and even Arthur brightened under it, and,\r\nwhen she remarked “You see I'm watering my flowers, though it is the\r\nSabbath-Day,” his voice had almost its old ring of cheerfulness as he\r\nreplied “Even on the Sabbath-Day works of mercy are allowed. But this\r\nisn't the Sabbath-Day. The Sabbath-day has ceased to exist.”\r\n\r\n“I know it's not Saturday,” Lady Muriel replied; “but isn't Sunday often\r\ncalled 'the Christian Sabbath'?”\r\n\r\n“It is so called, I think, in recognition of the spirit of the Jewish\r\ninstitution, that one day in seven should be a day of rest. But I hold\r\nthat Christians are freed from the literal observance of the Fourth\r\nCommandment.”\r\n\r\n“Then where is our authority for Sunday observance?”\r\n\r\n“We have, first, the fact that the seventh day was 'sanctified', when\r\nGod rested from the work of Creation. That is binding on us as Theists.\r\nSecondly, we have the fact that 'the Lord's Day' is a Christian\r\ninstitution. That is binding on us as Christians.”\r\n\r\n“And your practical rules would be--?”\r\n\r\n“First, as Theists, to keep it holy in some special way, and to make\r\nit, so far as is reasonably possible, a day of rest. Secondly, as\r\nChristians, to attend public worship.”\r\n\r\n“And what of amusements?”\r\n\r\n“I would say of them, as of all kinds of work, whatever is innocent on a\r\nweek-day, is innocent on Sunday, provided it does not interfere with the\r\nduties of the day.”\r\n\r\n“Then you would allow children to play on Sunday?”\r\n\r\n“Certainly I should. Why make the day irksome to their restless\r\nnatures?”\r\n\r\n“I have a letter somewhere,” said Lady Muriel, “from an old friend,\r\ndescribing the way in which Sunday was kept in her younger days. I will\r\nfetch it for you.”\r\n\r\n“I had a similar description, viva voce, years ago,” Arthur said when\r\nshe had left us, “from a little girl. It was really touching to hear\r\nthe melancholy tone in which she said 'On Sunday I mustn't play with my\r\ndoll! On Sunday I mustn't run on the sands! On Sunday I mustn't dig\r\nin the garden!' Poor child! She had indeed abundant cause for hating\r\nSunday!”\r\n\r\n“Here is the letter,” said Lady Muriel, returning. “Let me read you a\r\npiece of it.”\r\n\r\n“When, as a child, I first opened my eyes on a Sunday-morning, a feeling\r\nof dismal anticipation, which began at least on the Friday, culminated.\r\nI knew what was before me, and my wish, if not my word, was 'Would\r\nGod it were evening!' It was no day of rest, but a day of texts,\r\nof catechisms (Watts'), of tracts about converted swearers, godly\r\ncharwomen, and edifying deaths of sinners saved.\r\n\r\n“Up with the lark, hymns and portions of Scripture had to be learned by\r\nheart till 8 o'clock, when there were family-prayers, then breakfast,\r\nwhich I was never able to enjoy, partly from the fast already undergone,\r\nand partly from the outlook I dreaded.\r\n\r\n“At 9 came Sunday-School; and it made me indignant to be put into\r\nthe class with the village-children, as well as alarmed lest, by some\r\nmistake of mine, I should be put below them.\r\n\r\n“The Church-Service was a veritable Wilderness of Zin. I wandered in\r\nit, pitching the tabernacle of my thoughts on the lining of the square\r\nfamily-pew, the fidgets of my small brothers, and the horror of knowing\r\nthat, on the Monday, I should have to write out, from memory, jottings\r\nof the rambling disconnected extempore sermon, which might have had any\r\ntext but its own, and to stand or fall by the result.\r\n\r\n“This was followed by a cold dinner at 1 (servants to have no work),\r\nSunday-School again from 2 to 4, and Evening-Service at 6. The intervals\r\nwere perhaps the greatest trial of all, from the efforts I had to make,\r\nto be less than usually sinful, by reading books and sermons as barren\r\nas the Dead Sea. There was but one rosy spot, in the distance, all that\r\nday: and that was 'bed-time,' which never could come too early!”\r\n\r\n“Such teaching was well meant, no doubt,” said Arthur; “but it must\r\nhave driven many of its victims into deserting the Church-Services\r\naltogether.”\r\n\r\n“I'm afraid I was a deserter this morning,” she gravely said. “I had\r\nto write to Eric. Would you--would you mind my telling you something he\r\nsaid about prayer? It had never struck me in that light before.”\r\n\r\n“In what light?” said Arthur.\r\n\r\n“Why, that all Nature goes by fixed, regular laws--Science has proved\r\nthat. So that asking God to do anything (except of course praying for\r\nspiritual blessings) is to expect a miracle: and we've no right to do\r\nthat. I've not put it as well as he did: but that was the outcome of\r\nit, and it has confused me. Please tell me what you can say in answer to\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“I don't propose to discuss Captain Lindon's difficulties,” Arthur\r\ngravely replied; “specially as he is not present. But, if it is your\r\ndifficulty,” (his voice unconsciously took a tenderer tone) “then I will\r\nspeak.”\r\n\r\n“It is my difficulty,” she said anxiously.\r\n\r\n“Then I will begin by asking 'Why did you except spiritual blessings?'\r\nIs not your mind a part of Nature?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, but Free-Will comes in there--I can choose this or that; and God\r\ncan influence my choice.”\r\n\r\n“Then you are not a Fatalist?”\r\n\r\n“Oh, no!” she earnestly exclaimed.\r\n\r\n“Thank God!” Arthur said to himself, but in so low a whisper that only\r\nI heard it. “You grant then that I can, by an act of free choice, move\r\nthis cup,” suiting the action to the word, “this way or that way?”\r\n\r\n“Yes, I grant it.”\r\n\r\n“Well, let us see how far the result is produced by fixed laws. The cup\r\nmoves because certain mechanical forces are impressed on it by my hand.\r\nMy hand moves because certain forces--electric, magnetic, or whatever\r\n'nerve-force' may prove to be--are impressed on it by my brain. This\r\nnerve-force, stored in the brain, would probably be traceable, if\r\nScience were complete, to chemical forces supplied to the brain by\r\nthe blood, and ultimately derived from the food I eat and the air I\r\nbreathe.”\r\n\r\n“But would not that be Fatalism? Where would Free-Will come in?”\r\n\r\n“In choice of nerves,” replied Arthur. “The nerve-force in the brain may\r\nflow just as naturally down one nerve as down another. We need something\r\nmore than a fixed Law of Nature to settle which nerve shall carry it.\r\nThat 'something' is Free-Will.”\r\n\r\nHer eyes sparkled. “I see what you mean!” she exclaimed. “Human\r\nFree-Will is an exception to the system of fixed Law. Eric said\r\nsomething like that. And then I think he pointed out that God can only\r\ninfluence Nature by influencing Human Wills. So that we might reasonably\r\npray 'give us this day our daily bread,' because many of the causes that\r\nproduce bread are under Man's control. But to pray for rain, or fine\r\nweather, would be as unreasonable as--” she checked herself, as if\r\nfearful of saying something irreverent.\r\n\r\nIn a hushed, low tone, that trembled with emotion, and with the\r\nsolemnity of one in the presence of death, Arthur slowly replied “Shalt\r\nhe that contendeth with the Almighty instruct him? Shall we 'the swarm\r\nthat in the noontide beam were born,' feeling in ourselves the power to\r\ndirect, this way or that, the forces of Nature--of Nature, of which we\r\nform so trivial a part--shall we, in our boundless arrogance, in our\r\npitiful conceit, deny that power to the Ancient of Days? Saying, to\r\nour Creator, 'Thus far and no further. Thou madest, but thou canst not\r\nrule!'?”\r\n\r\nLady Muriel had covered her face in her hands, and did not look up. She\r\nonly murmured “Thanks, thanks!” again and again.\r\n\r\nWe rose to go. Arthur said, with evident effort, “One word more. If you\r\nwould know the power of Prayer--in anything and everything that Man can\r\nneed try it. Ask, and it shall be given you. I--have tried it. I know\r\nthat God answers prayer!”\r\n\r\nOur walk home was a silent one, till we had nearly reached the\r\nlodgings: then Arthur murmured--and it was almost an echo of my own\r\nthoughts--“What knowest thou, O wife, whether thou shalt save thy\r\nhusband?”\r\n\r\nThe subject was not touched on again. We sat on, talking, while hour\r\nafter hour, of this our last night together, glided away unnoticed. He\r\nhad much to tell me about India, and the new life he was going to, and\r\nthe work he hoped to do. And his great generous soul seemed so filled\r\nwith noble ambition as to have no space left for any vain regret or\r\nselfish repining.\r\n\r\n“Come, it is nearly morning! Arthur said at last, rising and leading the\r\nway upstairs.\r\n\r\n“The sun will be rising in a few minutes: and, though I have basely\r\ndefrauded you of your last chance of a night's rest here, I'm sure\r\nyou'll forgive me: for I really couldn't bring myself to say 'Good\r\nnight' sooner. And God knows whether you'll ever see me again, or hear\r\nof me!”\r\n\r\n“Hear of you I am certain I shall!” I warmly responded, and quoted the\r\nconcluding lines of that strange poem 'Waring':--\r\n\r\n\r\n    “Oh, never star\r\n    Was lost here, but it rose afar\r\n    Look East, where whole new thousands are!\r\n    In Vishnu-land what Avatar?”\r\n\r\n“Aye, look Eastward!” Arthur eagerly replied, pausing at the stair-case\r\nwindow, which commanded a fine view of the sea and the eastward horizon.\r\n“The West is the fitting tomb for all the sorrow and the sighing, all\r\nthe errors and the follies of the Past: for all its withered Hopes and\r\nall its buried Loves! From the East comes new strength, new ambition,\r\nnew Hope, new Life, new Love! Look Eastward! Aye, look Eastward!”\r\n\r\nHis last words were still ringing in my ears as I entered my room, and\r\nundrew the window-curtains, just in time to see the sun burst in glory\r\nfrom his ocean-prison, and clothe the world in the light of a new day.\r\n\r\n“So may it be for him, and me, and all of us!” I mused. “All that is\r\nevil, and dead, and hopeless, fading with the Night that is past! All\r\nthat is good, and living, and hopeful, rising with the dawn of Day!\r\n\r\n“Fading, with the Night, the chilly mists, and the noxious vapours,\r\nand the heavy shadows, and the wailing gusts, and the owl's melancholy\r\nhootings: rising, with the Day, the darting shafts of light, and the\r\nwholesome morning breeze, and the warmth of a dawning life, and the mad\r\nmusic of the lark! Look Eastward!\r\n\r\n“Fading, with the Night, the clouds of ignorance, and the deadly blight\r\nof sin, and the silent tears of sorrow: and ever rising, higher, higher,\r\nwith the Day, the radiant dawn of knowledge, and the sweet breath of\r\npurity, and the throb of a world's ecstasy! Look Eastward!\r\n\r\n{Image...'Look eastward!'}\r\n\r\n“Fading, with the Night, the memory of a dead love, and the withered\r\nleaves of a blighted hope, and the sickly repinings and moody regrets\r\nthat numb the best energies of the soul: and rising, broadening, rolling\r\nupward like a living flood, the manly resolve, and the dauntless will,\r\nand the heavenward gaze of faith--the substance of things hoped for, the\r\nevidence of things not seen!\r\n\r\n“Look Eastward! Aye, look Eastward!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\nOne little picture in this book, the Magic Locket, at p. 77, was drawn\r\nby 'Miss Alice Havers.' I did not state this on the title-page, since\r\nit seemed only due, to the artist of all these (to my mind) wonderful\r\npictures, that his name should stand there alone.\r\n\r\nThe descriptions, at pp. 386, 387, of Sunday as spent by children of\r\nthe last generation, are quoted verbatim from a speech made to me by a\r\nchild-friend and a letter written to me by a lady-friend.\r\n\r\nThe Chapters, headed 'Fairy Sylvie' and 'Bruno's Revenge,' are a\r\nreprint, with a few alterations, of a little fairy-tale which I wrote in\r\nthe year 1867, at the request of the late Mrs. Gatty, for 'Aunt Judy's\r\nMagazine,' which she was then editing.\r\n\r\nIt was in 1874, I believe, that the idea first occurred to me of making\r\nit the nucleus of a longer story. As the years went on, I jotted down,\r\nat odd moments, all sorts of odd ideas, and fragments of dialogue, that\r\noccurred to me--who knows how?--with a transitory suddenness that left\r\nme no choice but either to record them then and there, or to abandon\r\nthem to oblivion. Sometimes one could trace to their source these random\r\nflashes of thought--as being suggested by the book one was reading,\r\nor struck out from the 'flint' of one's own mind by the 'steel' of\r\na friend's chance remark but they had also a way of their own, of\r\noccurring, a propos of nothing--specimens of that hopelessly illogical\r\nphenomenon, 'an effect without a cause.' Such, for example, was the last\r\nline of 'The Hunting of the Snark,' which came into my head (as I have\r\nalready related in 'The Theatre' for April, 1887) quite suddenly, during\r\na solitary walk: and such, again, have been passages which occurred in\r\ndreams, and which I cannot trace to any antecedent cause whatever. There\r\nare at least two instances of such dream-suggestions in this book--one,\r\nmy Lady's remark, 'it often runs in families, just as a love for pastry\r\ndoes', at p. 88; the other, Eric Lindon's badinage about having been\r\nin domestic service, at p. 332. And thus it came to pass that I found\r\nmyself at last in possession of a huge unwieldy mass of litterature--if\r\nthe reader will kindly excuse the spelling--which only needed stringing\r\ntogether, upon the thread of a consecutive story, to constitute the book\r\nI hoped to write. Only! The task, at first, seemed absolutely hopeless,\r\nand gave me a far clearer idea, than I ever had before, of the meaning\r\nof the word 'chaos': and I think it must have been ten years, or more,\r\nbefore I had succeeded in classifying these odds-and-ends sufficiently\r\nto see what sort of a story they indicated: for the story had to grow\r\nout of the incidents, not the incidents out of the story I am telling\r\nall this, in no spirit of egoism, but because I really believe that some\r\nof my readers will be interested in these details of the 'genesis' of\r\na book, which looks so simple and straight-forward a matter, when\r\ncompleted, that they might suppose it to have been written straight off,\r\npage by page, as one would write a letter, beginning at the beginning;\r\nand ending at the end.\r\n\r\nIt is, no doubt, possible to write a story in that way: and, if it be\r\nnot vanity to say so, I believe that I could, myself,--if I were in the\r\nunfortunate position (for I do hold it to be a real misfortune) of being\r\nobliged to produce a given amount of fiction in a given time,--that I\r\ncould 'fulfil my task,' and produce my 'tale of bricks,' as other slaves\r\nhave done. One thing, at any rate, I could guarantee as to the story so\r\nproduced--that it should be utterly commonplace, should contain no new\r\nideas whatever, and should be very very weary reading!\r\n\r\nThis species of literature has received the very appropriate name of\r\n'padding' which might fitly be defined as 'that which all can write and\r\nnone can read.' That the present volume contains no such writing I dare\r\nnot avow: sometimes, in order to bring a picture into its proper place,\r\nit has been necessary to eke out a page with two or three extra lines:\r\nbut I can honestly say I have put in no more than I was absolutely\r\ncompelled to do.\r\n\r\nMy readers may perhaps like to amuse themselves by trying to detect, in\r\na given passage, the one piece of 'padding' it contains. While arranging\r\nthe 'slips' into pages, I found that the passage, whichnow extends\r\nfrom the top of p. 35 to the middle of p. 38, was 3 lines too short.\r\nI supplied the deficiency, not by interpolating a word here and a word\r\nthere, but by writing in 3 consecutive lines. Now can my readers guess\r\nwhich they are?\r\n\r\nA harder puzzle if a harder be desired would be to determine, as to the\r\nGardener's Song, in which cases (if any) the stanza was adapted to the\r\nsurrounding text, and in which (if any) the text was adapted to the\r\nstanza.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the hardest thing in all literature--at least I have found it\r\nso: by no voluntary effort can I accomplish it: I have to take it as it\r\ncome's is to write anything original. And perhaps the easiest is, when\r\nonce an original line has been struck out, to follow it up, and to write\r\nany amount more to the same tune. I do not know if 'Alice in Wonderland'\r\nwas an original story--I was, at least, no conscious imitator in writing\r\nit--but I do know that, since it came out, something like a dozen\r\nstory-books have appeared, on identically the same pattern. The path I\r\ntimidly explored believing myself to be 'the first that ever burst into\r\nthat silent sea'--is now a beaten high-road: all the way-side flowers\r\nhave long ago been trampled into the dust: and it would be courting\r\ndisaster for me to attempt that style again.\r\n\r\nHence it is that, in 'Sylvie and Bruno,' I have striven with I know not\r\nwhat success to strike out yet another new path: be it bad or good, it\r\nis the best I can do. It is written, not for money, and not for fame,\r\nbut in the hope of supplying, for the children whom I love, some\r\nthoughts that may suit those hours of innocent merriment which are the\r\nvery life of Childhood; and also in the hope of suggesting, to them and\r\nto others, some thoughts that may prove, I would fain hope, not wholly\r\nout of harmony with the graver cadences of Life.\r\n\r\nIf I have not already exhausted the patience of my readers, I would like\r\nto seize this opportunity perhaps the last I shall have of addressing so\r\nmany friends at once of putting on record some ideas that have occurred\r\nto me, as to books desirable to be written--which I should much like to\r\nattempt, but may not ever have the time or power to carry through--in\r\nthe hope that, if I should fail (and the years are gliding away very\r\nfast) to finish the task I have set myself, other hands may take it up.\r\n\r\nFirst, a Child's Bible. The only real essentials of this would be,\r\ncarefully selected passages, suitable for a child's reading and\r\npictures. One principle of selection, which I would adopt, would be that\r\nReligion should be put before a child as a revelation of love no need to\r\npain and puzzle the young mind with the history of crime and punishment.\r\n(On such a principle I should, for example, omit the history of the\r\nFlood.) The supplying of the pictures would involve no great difficulty:\r\nno new ones would be needed: hundreds of excellent pictures already\r\nexist, the copyright of which has long ago expired, and which simply\r\nneed photo-zincography, or some similar process, for their successful\r\nreproduction. The book should be handy in size with a pretty attractive\r\nlooking cover--in a clear legible type--and, above all, with abundance\r\nof pictures, pictures, pictures!\r\n\r\nSecondly, a book of pieces selected from the Bible--not single texts,\r\nbut passages of from 10 to 20 verses each--to be committed to memory.\r\nSuch passages would be found useful, to repeat to one's self and\r\nto ponder over, on many occasions when reading is difficult, if\r\nnot impossible: for instance, when lying awake at night--on a\r\nrailway-journey--when taking a solitary walk-in old age, when eye-sight\r\nis failing of wholly lost--and, best of all, when illness, while\r\nincapacitating us for reading or any other occupation, condemns us to\r\nlie awake through many weary silent hours: at such a time how keenly\r\none may realise the truth of David's rapturous cry 'O how sweet are thy\r\nwords unto my throat: yea, sweeter than honey unto my mouth!'\r\n\r\nI have said 'passages,' rather than single texts, because we have no\r\nmeans of recalling single texts: memory needs links, and here are none:\r\none may have a hundred texts stored in the memory, and not be able\r\nto recall, at will, more than half-a-dozen--and those by mere chance:\r\nwhereas, once get hold of any portion of a chapter that has been\r\ncommitted to memory, and the whole can be recovered: all hangs together.\r\n\r\nThirdly, a collection of passages, both prose and verse, from books\r\nother than the Bible. There is not perhaps much, in what is called\r\n'un-inspired' literature (a misnomer, I hold: if Shakespeare was not\r\ninspired, one may well doubt if any man ever was), that will bear the\r\nprocess of being pondered over, a hundred times: still there are such\r\npassages--enough, I think, to make a goodly store for the memory.\r\n\r\nThese two books of sacred, and secular, passages for memory--will serve\r\nother good purposes besides merely occupying vacant hours: they\r\nwill help to keep at bay many anxious thoughts, worrying thoughts,\r\nuncharitable thoughts, unholy thoughts. Let me say this, in better\r\nwords than my own, by copying a passage from that most interesting book,\r\nRobertson's Lectures on the Epistles to the Corinthians, Lecture XLIX.\r\n“If a man finds himself haunted by evil desires and unholy images, which\r\nwill generally be at periodical hours, let him commit to memory passages\r\nof Scripture, or passages from the best writers in verse or prose. Let\r\nhim store his mind with these, as safeguards to repeat when he lies\r\nawake in some restless night, or when despairing imaginations, or\r\ngloomy, suicidal thoughts, beset him. Let these be to him the sword,\r\nturning everywhere to keep the way of the Garden of Life from the\r\nintrusion of profaner footsteps.”\r\n\r\nFourthly, a “Shakespeare” for girls: that is, an edition in which\r\neverything, not suitable for the perusal of girls of (say) from 10\r\nto 17, should be omitted. Few children under 10 would be likely to\r\nunderstand or enjoy the greatest of poets: and those, who have passed\r\nout of girlhood, may safely be left to read Shakespeare, in any edition,\r\n'expurgated' or not, that they may prefer: but it seems a pity that\r\nso many children, in the intermediate stage, should be debarred from\r\na great pleasure for want of an edition suitable to them. Neither\r\nBowdler's, Chambers's, Brandram's, nor Cundell's 'Boudoir' Shakespeare,\r\nseems to me to meet the want: they are not sufficiently 'expurgated.'\r\nBowdler's is the most extraordinary of all: looking through it, I am\r\nfilled with a deep sense of wonder, considering what he has left in,\r\nthat he should have cut anything out! Besides relentlessly erasing all\r\nthat is unsuitable on the score of reverence or decency, I should be\r\ninclined to omit also all that seems too difficult, or not likely\r\nto interest young readers. The resulting book might be slightly\r\nfragmentary: but it would be a real treasure to all British maidens who\r\nhave any taste for poetry.\r\n\r\nIf it be needful to apologize to any one for the new departure I have\r\ntaken in this story--by introducing, along with what will, I hope, prove\r\nto be acceptable nonsense for children, some of the graver thoughts of\r\nhuman life--it must be to one who has learned the Art of keeping such\r\nthoughts wholly at a distance in hours of mirth and careless ease. To\r\nhim such a mixture will seem, no doubt, ill-judged and repulsive. And\r\nthat such an Art exists I do not dispute: with youth, good health, and\r\nsufficient money, it seems quite possible to lead, for years together,\r\na life of unmixed gaiety--with the exception of one solemn fact, with\r\nwhich we are liable to be confronted at any moment, even in the midst\r\nof the most brilliant company or the most sparkling entertainment. A\r\nman may fix his own times for admitting serious thought, for attending\r\npublic worship, for prayer, for reading the Bible: all such matters he\r\ncan defer to that 'convenient season', which is so apt never to occur\r\nat all: but he cannot defer, for one single moment, the necessity of\r\nattending to a message, which may come before he has finished reading\r\nthis page,' this night shalt thy soul be required of thee.'\r\n\r\nThe ever-present sense of this grim possibility has been, in all ages,*\r\n\r\n\r\n     Note... At the moment, when I had written these words, there\r\n     was a knock at the door, and a telegram was brought me,\r\n     announcing the sudden death of a dear friend.\r\n\r\nan incubus that men have striven to shake off. Few more interesting\r\nsubjects of enquiry could be found, by a student of history, than the\r\nvarious weapons that have been used against this shadowy foe. Saddest\r\nof all must have been the thoughts of those who saw indeed an\r\nexistence beyond the grave, but an existence far more terrible than\r\nannihilation--an existence as filmy, impalpable, all but invisible\r\nspectres, drifting about, through endless ages, in a world of shadows,\r\nwith nothing to do, nothing to hope for, nothing to love! In the midst\r\nof the gay verses of that genial 'bon vivant' Horace, there stands one\r\ndreary word whose utter sadness goes to one's heart. It is the word\r\n'exilium' in the well-known passage\r\n\r\n\r\n    Omnes eodem cogimur, omnium\r\n    Versatur urna serius ocius\r\n    Sors exitura et nos in aeternum\r\n    Exilium impositura cymbae.\r\n\r\nYes, to him this present life--spite of all its weariness and all its\r\nsorrow--was the only life worth having: all else was 'exile'! Does it\r\nnot seem almost incredible that one, holding such a creed, should ever\r\nhave smiled?\r\n\r\nAnd many in this day, I fear, even though believing in an existence\r\nbeyond the grave far more real than Horace ever dreamed of, yet regard\r\nit as a sort of 'exile' from all the joys of life, and so adopt Horace's\r\ntheory, and say 'let us eat and drink, for to-morrow we die.'\r\n\r\nWe go to entertainments, such as the theatre--I say 'we', for I also\r\ngo to the play, whenever I get a chance of seeing a really good one and\r\nkeep at arm's length, if possible, the thought that we may not return\r\nalive. Yet how do you know--dear friend, whose patience has carried you\r\nthrough this garrulous preface that it may not be your lot, when mirth\r\nis fastest and most furious, to feel the sharp pang, or the deadly\r\nfaintness, which heralds the final crisis--to see, with vague wonder,\r\nanxious friends bending over you to hear their troubled whispers perhaps\r\nyourself to shape the question, with trembling lips, “Is it serious?”,\r\nand to be told “Yes: the end is near” (and oh, how different all Life\r\nwill look when those words are said!)--how do you know, I say, that all\r\nthis may not happen to you, this night?\r\n\r\nAnd dare you, knowing this, say to yourself “Well, perhaps it is an\r\nimmoral play: perhaps the situations are a little too 'risky', the\r\ndialogue a little too strong, the 'business' a little too suggestive. I\r\ndon't say that conscience is quite easy: but the piece is so clever, I\r\nmust see it this once! I'll begin a stricter life to-morrow.” To-morrow,\r\nand to-morrow, and tomorrow!\r\n\r\n\r\n   “Who sins in hope, who, sinning, says,\r\n   'Sorrow for sin God's judgement stays!'\r\n   Against God's Spirit he lies; quite stops\r\n   Mercy with insult; dares, and drops,\r\n   Like a scorch'd fly, that spins in vain\r\n   Upon the axis of its pain,\r\n   Then takes its doom, to limp and crawl,\r\n   Blind and forgot, from fall to fall.”\r\n\r\nLet me pause for a moment to say that I believe this thought, of the\r\npossibility of death--if calmly realised, and steadily faced would be\r\none of the best possible tests as to our going to any scene of amusement\r\nbeing right or wrong. If the thought of sudden death acquires, for you,\r\na special horror when imagined as happening in a theatre, then be very\r\nsure the theatre is harmful for you, however harmless it may be for\r\nothers; and that you are incurring a deadly peril in going. Be sure the\r\nsafest rule is that we should not dare to live in any scene in which we\r\ndare not die.\r\n\r\nBut, once realise what the true object is in life--that it is not\r\npleasure, not knowledge, not even fame itself, 'that last infirmity of\r\nnoble minds'--but that it is the development of character, the rising\r\nto a higher, nobler, purer standard, the building-up of the perfect\r\nMan--and then, so long as we feel that this is going on, and will (we\r\ntrust) go on for evermore, death has for us no terror; it is not a\r\nshadow, but a light; not an end, but a beginning!\r\n\r\nOne other matter may perhaps seem to call for apology--that I should\r\nhave treated with such entire want of sympathy the British passion for\r\n'Sport', which no doubt has been in by-gone days, and is still, in\r\nsome forms of it, an excellent school for hardihood and for coolness in\r\nmoments of danger. But I am not entirely without sympathy for genuine\r\n'Sport': I can heartily admire the courage of the man who, with severe\r\nbodily toil, and at the risk of his life, hunts down some 'man-eating'\r\ntiger: and I can heartily sympathize with him when he exults in the\r\nglorious excitement of the chase and the hand-to-hand struggle with the\r\nmonster brought to bay. But I can but look with deep wonder and sorrow\r\non the hunter who, at his ease and in safety, can find pleasure in what\r\ninvolves, for some defenceless creature, wild terror and a death of\r\nagony: deeper, if the hunter be one who has pledged himself to preach\r\nto men the Religion of universal Love: deepest of all, if it be one of\r\nthose 'tender and delicate' beings, whose very name serves as a\r\nsymbol of Love--'thy love to me was wonderful, passing the love of\r\nwomen'--whose mission here is surely to help and comfort all that are in\r\npain or sorrow!\r\n\r\n\r\n   'Farewell, farewell! but this I tell\r\n   To thee, thou Wedding-Guest!\r\n   He prayeth well, who loveth well\r\n   Both man and bird and beast.\r\n\r\n   He prayeth best, who loveth best\r\n   All things both great and small;\r\n   For the dear God who loveth us,\r\n   He made and loveth all.'\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of the Project Gutenberg EBook of Sylvie and Bruno, by Lewis Carroll\r\n\r\n***",
