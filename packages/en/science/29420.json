SYSTEMS\r\n\r\n=Transportation Problem.=--Public highways, like many other familiar\r\nthings, are utilized constantly with little thought of how\r\nindispensable they are to the conduct of the business of a nation or\r\nof the intimate relation they bear to the everyday life of any\r\ncommunity. The degree to which a nation or a community perfects its\r\ntransportation facilities is an index of its industrial progress and\r\npublic highways constitute an important element in the national\r\ntransportation system. It is to be expected that the average citizen\r\nwill think of the public highway only when it affects his own\r\nactivities and that he will concern himself but little with the broad\r\nproblem of highway improvement unless it be brought forcibly to his\r\nattention through taxation or by publicity connected with the\r\nadvancement of specific projects.\r\n\r\n=National in Scope.=--The improvement and extension of the highway\r\nsystem is of national importance just as is development and extension\r\nof railways, and concerted action throughout a nation is a\r\nprerequisite to an adequate policy in regard to either. It is\r\ninconceivable that any community in a nation can prosper greatly\r\nwithout some benefit accruing to many other parts of the country.\r\nIncreased consumption, which always accompanies material prosperity,\r\nmeans increased production somewhere, and people purchase from many\r\nvaried sources to supply the things that they want. Good\r\ntransportation facilities contribute greatly to community prosperity\r\nand indirectly to national prosperity, and the benefits of highly\r\nimproved public highways are therefore national in scope. This fact\r\nhas been recognized in Europe, notably in England, France and Belgium,\r\nwhere the public highways are administered largely as national\r\nutilities.\r\n\r\nUntil recent years, highway improvement in the United States has been\r\nsubordinated to other more pressing public improvements, but during\r\nthe World War the inadequacy of the transportation system of the\r\nUnited States became apparent. While such an unprecedented load upon\r\ntransportation facilities may not recur for many years, it has become\r\napparent that more rapid progress in highway improvement is necessary\r\nand in the United States the subject is now likely to receive\r\nattention commensurate with its importance.\r\n\r\n=Development of Traffic.=--The character and extent of the highway\r\nimprovement needed in any locality is dependent entirely on the\r\ndemands of traffic. In sparsely settled areas, particularly those that\r\nare semi-arid or arid, the amount of traffic on local roads is likely\r\nto be small and the unimproved trails or natural roads adequate. But\r\nas an area develops either on account of agricultural progress or the\r\nestablishment of industrial enterprises, the use of the public\r\nhighways both for business and for pleasure increases and the old\r\ntrails are gradually improved to meet, at least to some degree, the\r\nnew demands of traffic. In sparsely settled areas, it is possible for\r\nthe public to accommodate its use of the highways to the physical\r\ncondition thereof, and business is more or less regulated according to\r\nthe condition of the roads. This is not always pleasant or economical\r\nbut is the only possible arrangement. In populous districts, with\r\ndiversified activities, it becomes imperative to have year-round\r\nusable roads in order to transact with reasonable dispatch the regular\r\nbusiness of the industries. Anything less will handicap normal\r\ncommunity progress.\r\n\r\nThe advent of the motor driven vehicle in the United States has\r\nresulted in a greatly increased use of the public highways of\r\nagricultural areas, even of those that are sparsely populated, because\r\nof the convenience of the motor vehicle both for passenger and for\r\nfreight service. Probably in excess of 90 per cent of the tonnage\r\npassing over the rural highways in the United States is carried by\r\nmotor vehicles. This class of traffic has really just developed and no\r\none can predict what it will be in ten years, yet it has already\r\nintroduced into the highway problem an element that has revolutionized\r\nmethods of construction and maintenance.\r\n\r\nA different set of traffic conditions exists in those parts of the\r\nUnited States where large areas are devoted primarily to industrial\r\npursuits, the agricultural development being of secondary importance.\r\nPublic highways connecting the industrial centers are indispensable\r\nadjuncts to the business facilities in such communities and are\r\nordinarily subjected to a very large volume and tonnage of traffic\r\nconsisting principally of motor vehicles. The roads first selected for\r\nimprovement will not be those serving the agricultural interests of\r\nthe district, but rather those serving the industrial centers.\r\nInter-city roads of great durability and relatively high cost are\r\nnecessary for such traffic conditions.\r\n\r\nNot infrequently the transportation needs will require a system of\r\nboth inter-city and rural highways in the same community. There are\r\nfew areas in the United States where there is no agricultural\r\ndevelopment. It is apparent therefore that the nature of the highway\r\nsystems and the administrative organization under which they are built\r\nand maintained will differ in various states or areas according to\r\nthe nature of development of that area agriculturally and\r\nindustrially. In planning improvements of highway systems, it is\r\nrecognized that one or more of several groups of traffic may be\r\nencountered and that the extent and nature of the improvement must be\r\nsuch as will meet the requirements of all classes of traffic, the most\r\nimportant being first provided for, and that of lesser importance as\r\nrapidly as finances permit.\r\n\r\n\r\nKINDS OF TRAFFIC ON PUBLIC HIGHWAYS\r\n\r\n=Local or Farm to Market Traffic.=--In strictly agricultural\r\ncommunities the principal use of the highways will pertain to\r\nagricultural activities and most of it will be between the farm and\r\nthe most convenient market center. In the ordinary state, the number\r\nof rural families will not average more than six to eight per square\r\nmile, but in some districts it may reach twenty families per square\r\nmile. The travel from the district around a market center will\r\noriginate in this rather sparsely populated area and converge onto a\r\nfew main roads leading to market. The outlying or feeder roads will be\r\nused by only a few families, but the density of traffic will increase\r\nnearer the market centers and consequently the roads nearer town will\r\nbe much more heavily traveled than the outlying ones. It is apparent\r\ntherefore that considerable difference may exist in the kind of\r\nconstruction adequate for the various sections of road where farm\r\ntraffic is the principal consideration. This traffic is made up of\r\nhorse drawn wagons, transporting farm products and of horse drawn and\r\nmotor passenger vehicles, the motor traffic comprising 80 per cent or\r\nmore of the volume of traffic and a greater per cent of the tonnage.\r\nMotor trucks are now employed to some extent for marketing farm\r\nproducts and, where surfaced highways have been provided, this class\r\nof traffic is superseding horse drawn traffic.\r\n\r\n=Farm to Farm Traffic.=--In the ordinary prosecution of farming\r\noperations, a considerable amount of neighborhood travel is\r\ninevitable. Farmers help each other with certain kinds of work,\r\nexchange commodities such as seed, machinery and farm animals and\r\nvisit back and forth both for business and pleasure. To accommodate\r\nthis traffic, it is desirable to provide good neighborhood roads.\r\nTraffic of this sort follows no particular route and can to some\r\nextent accommodate itself to the condition of the highways without\r\nentailing financial loss, although some discomfort and some\r\ninconvenience may result from inadequate highway facilities. This\r\ntraffic will be partly motor and partly horse drawn, but the\r\nproportion of motor driven is large.\r\n\r\n=Inter-city Traffic.=--In strictly agricultural districts there is a\r\nlarge amount of travel between towns, both for business and for\r\npleasure. The pleasure travel is mostly in motor vehicles and a\r\nconsiderable part of the business traffic is the same, although horse\r\ndrawn vehicles are employed to some extent.\r\n\r\nIn industrial districts there is a large volume of this class of\r\ntraffic consisting of motor passenger vehicles used for business and\r\nfor pleasure and of motor freight vehicles used for general business\r\npurposes. In addition, there is certain to be a large amount of motor\r\ntruck freight traffic incident to the particular industrial pursuits\r\nof the cities. Where adequate public highways connect industrial\r\ncenters, there is invariably a very large amount of inter-city\r\ntraffic, due in part to the needs of industry and in part to\r\nconcentration of population in industrial centers.\r\n\r\n=Inter-County and Inter-State Traffic.=--Automobile touring is a\r\npopular means of relaxation, especially on the part of those who live\r\nin the cities, although it is by no means confined to them. Traffic of\r\nthis kind follows the routes where roads are best and passes entirely\r\nacross a county, attracted by some public gathering. Often it is\r\ninter-state in character, made up of tourists who are traveling to\r\ndistant pleasure resorts. Such traffic at present constitutes a\r\nrelatively small part of the travel on public highways, except on\r\ncertain favorable routes, but as the wealth of the country increases\r\nand good touring roads are numerous, long distance travel will\r\nincrease and will eventually necessitate the construction of a number\r\nof well maintained national highways, located with reference to the\r\nconvenience of the automobile tourist.\r\n\r\n\r\nPUBLIC HIGHWAYS AND COMMUNITY LIFE\r\n\r\nIt is well to recognize the intimate relation public highways bear to\r\nthe economic progress of a nation. Normal development of all of the\r\ndiverse activities of a people depends very largely upon the highway\r\npolicy that is adopted and whether the actual construction of\r\nserviceable roads keeps pace with transportation needs.\r\n\r\n=Rural Education.=--It has become increasingly apparent during the\r\nWorld War that the demand upon North America for food stuffs is to\r\nbecome more and more insistent as the years pass. Already the\r\nconsumption in the United States has approached quite closely to the\r\naverage production and yet the population is constantly increasing.\r\nThe time is not far distant when greater production will be required\r\nof the agricultural area in North America in order to meet the home\r\ndemand for foodstuffs, and many thousands of tons will be needed for\r\nexport. This need can only be met by agricultural methods that will\r\nincrease greatly the present yield of the soil. The adoption of better\r\nagricultural methods must of necessity be preceded by the technical\r\ntraining of the school children who will be the farmers of the next\r\ngeneration, which can best be accomplished in graded schools with well\r\nequipped laboratories and with suitably trained teachers. The problem\r\nof providing such schools in rural communities has, in some instances,\r\nbeen solved by consolidating a number of rural school districts and\r\nconstructing a well equipped building to accommodate the students from\r\nan area several miles square. An educational system of this sort can\r\nreach its highest usefulness only when adequate public highways\r\nfacilitate attendance of pupils. The whole trend of rural educational\r\nprogress is toward a system which is predicated upon a comprehensive\r\nhighway policy in the district.\r\n\r\n=Rural Social Life.=--Closely allied to the rural educational problem\r\nis the rural social problem. Motor cars and good roads do a great deal\r\nto eliminate the isolation and lack of social opportunity that has\r\ncharacterized rural life in the United States. A high order of\r\ncitizenship in rural communities is essential to the solution of many\r\nproblems of rural economics, and such citizens will not live away from\r\nthe social opportunities of modern life. The rural school house and\r\nthe rural church may become social centers and local plays, moving\r\npicture shows and lectures and entertainments of other kinds made\r\navailable to those who live in the country. Their enjoyment of these\r\nsocial opportunities will be much more general if the public highways\r\nare at all times in a condition to be traveled in comfort. Good homes\r\nand good schools on good roads are prerequisites to the solution of\r\nmany rural problems.\r\n\r\nIf there is opportunity for those who live in the cities to get some\r\nadequate idea of rural life and the conditions under which farming\r\noperations are carried on it will correct many misunderstandings of\r\nthe broad problems of food production and distribution. Reference has\r\nfrequently been made to the seeming desire on the part of city people\r\nto get into the country, and, by facilitating the realization of this\r\ndesire, a great social service is rendered.\r\n\r\n=Good Roads and Commerce.=--That good highways are almost as necessary\r\nas are railroads to the commercial development of a nation is\r\nrecognized but, unlike the railroads, the highways are not operated\r\nfor direct profit and the responsibility of securing consideration of\r\nthe demand for improvements is not centralized. Therefore, sentiment\r\nfor road improvement has been of slow growth, and important projects\r\nare often delayed until long after the need for them was manifest.\r\nMovements to secure financial support for highway improvement must go\r\nthrough the slow process of legislative enactment, encountering all of\r\nthe uncertainties of political action, and the resulting financial\r\nplan is likely to be inadequate and often inequitable.\r\n\r\nThe whole commercial structure of a nation rests upon transportation,\r\nand the highways are a part of the transportation system. The highway\r\nproblem can never receive adequate consideration until public highways\r\nare recognized as an indispensable element in the business equipment\r\nof a nation.\r\n\r\nDuring the World War all transportation facilities were taxed to the\r\nlimit, and motor trucks were utilized for long distance freight\r\nhaulage to an extent not previously considered practicable. As a\r\nresult, the interest in the motor truck as an addition to the\r\ntransportation equipment of the nation, has been greatly stimulated.\r\nMany haulage companies have entered the freight transportation field,\r\ndelivering commodities by truck to distances of a hundred miles or\r\nmore.\r\n\r\nThe part the motor truck will play in the future can only be\r\nestimated, but it seems clear that the most promising field is for\r\nshipments destined to or originating in a city of some size and a\r\nwarehouse or store not on a railroad spur, and especially when the\r\nshipments are less than car load lots. The delays and expense incident\r\nto handling small shipments of freight through the terminals of a\r\nlarge city and carting from the unloading station to the warehouse or\r\nother destination constitute a considerable item in the cost of\r\ntransportation.\r\n\r\nMr. Charles Whiting Baker, Consulting Editor of _Engineering\r\nNews-Record_, states:[1]\r\n\r\n     [1] Engineering News Record, July 10, 1919.\r\n\r\n     \"It costs today as much to haul a ton of farm produce ten miles\r\n     to a railway station as it does to haul it a thousand miles over\r\n     a heavy-traffic trunk-line railway. It often costs more today to\r\n     transport a ton of merchandise from its arrival in a long train\r\n     in the freight yard on the outskirts of a great city to its\r\n     deposit in the warehouse of a merchant four or five miles away\r\n     than it has cost to haul it over a thousand miles of railway\r\n     line.\"\r\n\r\nNevertheless it seems probable that new methods of operating the motor\r\ntruck transport, and possibly new types of trucks or trucks and\r\ntrailers will be developed so that freight traffic over many roads\r\nwill be of considerable tonnage and an established part of the\r\ntransportation system of the nation. In the article above referred to\r\nare given the following data relative to the cost of hauling on\r\nimproved roads by motor truck and these cost estimates are based on\r\nthe best information available at this time. They should be considered\r\nas approximate only, but serve to indicate the limitations of the\r\ntruck as a competitor of the steam railway.\r\n\r\n  TABLE 1\r\n\r\n  TRUCK OPERATION COSTS, FROM

one way and empty returning      .2412\r\n  Cost per ton-mile for full loads one way and half load returning  .16\r\n\r\nThe significance of these figures becomes apparent when they are\r\ncompared with the cost of hauling freight over trunk-line railways\r\nwith heavy traffic where the cost per ton-mile, including terminal\r\ncharges, ranges from 1.7 _mills_ per ton-mile to 4.4 _mills_ per\r\nton-mile.\r\n\r\nIn view of these facts it seems reasonable to suppose that motor\r\nvehicles for use on the public highways are more likely to be employed\r\nto supplement the rail transport than to compete with it. To the\r\nactual cost of operation of motor trucks given in Table 2, there\r\nshould be added the proportionate cost of maintaining the highway for\r\nthe use of the truck, which is partly covered by the item \"License\r\nFee\" in the table. The license fee would necessarily be considerably\r\nlarger if it were to compensate adequately for the wear on the\r\nhighways over which the trucks operate. This will still further\r\nincrease the cost of hauling by motor truck.\r\n\r\nMotor trucks are employed for many kinds of hauling where their speed\r\nand consequently their daily capacity is an advantage over team\r\nhauling that is decidedly worth while. It probably could be shown\r\nthat for many kinds of hauling, teams are more economical than motor\r\ntrucks, but when promptness and speed and the consequent effect on\r\ndependent activities are considered, the motor truck often has a\r\ndistinct advantage, and the use of the truck to replace horse drawn\r\nvans is progressing rapidly. This is true not only in the cities, but\r\nalso in the smaller towns and in the country. Motor trucks have been\r\nadopted in a great many communities for delivery of farm products to\r\nmarket, and this use of the truck is certain to increase rapidly. But\r\ntrucks in this service will use the secondary roads as well as the\r\nmain or primary roads.\r\n\r\nThese observations emphasize the extent to which the highway policy of\r\nthe nation must be predicated on the use of the highways by motor\r\nvehicles.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nHIGHWAY ADMINISTRATION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe systems of highway administration extant in the various political\r\nunits in the United States present a patchwork of overlapping\r\nauthority and undetermined responsibility. Highway laws are being\r\nconstantly revised by state legislatures and with each revision there\r\nis some change in administrative methods and often the changes are\r\nrevolutionary in character. In most states, the trend is away from\r\ncounty and township administration and toward state administration,\r\nwith provision for considerable participation by the federal\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\nIt will be pertinent to consider briefly the present functions of each\r\nof the administrative authorities having duties in connection with\r\nhighway work in the United States, although these duties vary greatly\r\nin the several states and change periodically with the action of\r\nlegislatures.\r\n\r\n=Township Administration.=--Township or \"Town\" authority is a survival\r\nof the old New England town government and the town board consists of\r\nthree or more trustees who hold office for fixed terms. The usual term\r\nis three years, but is less in some states. The incumbent is generally\r\na man who has other responsibilities of a public or private nature and\r\nwho gives but little of his time to highway matters. In some states\r\nthe pay is a fixed annual salary and in others a per diem with some\r\nlimitation on the amount that may be drawn in any one year, which\r\nlimitation may be statutory or may be by common consent.\r\n\r\nThe township highway commissioners or trustees have jurisdiction over\r\ncertain of the roads in the township, usually best described as all\r\nroads not by law placed under the jurisdiction of some other\r\nauthority. In certain instances, the township authorities have charge\r\nof all of the roads in the township, which would mean that no \"county\"\r\nor \"state\" roads happened to be laid out in that township. It is a\r\nmatter of general observation that the trend of legislation is toward\r\nremoving from the jurisdiction of the township officials all roads\r\nexcept those upon which the traffic is principally local in character.\r\nThe actual mileage of roads in the United States that is at present\r\nadministered by township officials is large, probably constituting not\r\nless than seventy per cent of the total mileage.\r\n\r\nIn most states the township officials are responsible for the\r\nmaintenance of the roads under their jurisdiction and also supervise\r\nsuch new construction as is undertaken. This includes the construction\r\nof culverts and bridges as a rule, but in some states the county board\r\nof supervisors is responsible for all of the bridge and culvert work\r\non the township roads. In other states, the township board is\r\nresponsible only for bridges or culverts that cost less than a certain\r\namount specified by law (usually about $1000) and the county board\r\nprovides for the construction and upkeep of the more expensive bridges\r\nand culverts.\r\n\r\nFunds for the work carried out by the township road officials are\r\nobtained by general taxation, the amount that may be levied being\r\nlimited by statute and the actual levy being any amount up to the\r\nmaximum that the township board deems necessary for its purposes. It\r\nis the general observation that the tax levy is usually the maximum\r\npermitted by law.\r\n\r\nIn many states, township officials are permitted to issue bonds for\r\nroad construction, almost invariably, however, with the restriction\r\nthat each issue must be approved by the voters of the township. There\r\nis always a provision that the total amount of bonds outstanding must\r\nnot exceed the constitutional limit in force in the state. In several\r\nstates, the townships have large amounts of road bonds outstanding.\r\n\r\n=County Administration.=--In some states the county is the smallest\r\nadministrative unit in the road system. A county board, called the\r\nboard of county supervisors or board of county commissioners\r\nconsisting of from three to fifteen members, is the administrative\r\nauthority. Its members are elected for fixed terms which vary in\r\nlength from one to five years. The county board usually has many\r\npublic responsibilities other than highway administration, and is\r\ngenerally made up of men with considerably more business ability than\r\nthe average township board.\r\n\r\nThe county board has jurisdiction over all of the highways in the\r\ncounty in some states, and in others it has charge of only the more\r\nimportant highways. In most states, the laws set forth specifically\r\nwhat highways shall be under the jurisdiction of the county\r\nauthorities.\r\n\r\nIn addition to having direct supervision of the improvement and\r\nmaintenance of the roads assigned to county administration, the county\r\nboards in some states arrange for the construction of all culverts and\r\nbridges on the roads that are under township supervision, or at least\r\nthe more expensive bridges and culverts on such roads. Sometimes this\r\nis accomplished by granting county aid for township bridges, under\r\nwhich system the county pays a part of the cost of the construction of\r\nbridges on the township roads. The amount of aid varies, but is\r\ngenerally about one-half of the cost, and the township and county\r\nofficials jointly assume the responsibility of arranging for the\r\nconstruction by contract or otherwise.\r\n\r\nThe county board obtains funds for road work through a direct tax on\r\nall property in the county, the maximum rate being limited by statute.\r\nCounty boards are also authorized to issue bonds for road construction\r\nunder statutory restrictions and limitations similar to those\r\neffective in the township as to total amount issued, and many\r\nmillions of dollars' worth of highway bonds have been issued by\r\ncounty authorities in the United States.\r\n\r\n=State Administration.=--In a state, the administrative authority in\r\nhighway matters is vested in a board of commissioners usually\r\nconsisting of three or more members. In a few states, the\r\nadministrative authority is delegated to a single commissioner. Where\r\nthe authority is vested in a board, that board is usually appointed by\r\nthe governor. In several states one or more members of the commission\r\nhold that position _ex officio_; for example, in several states the\r\ngovernor is by law a member of the commission, in others the secretary\r\nof state or the dean of engineering at the State University or the\r\nstate geologist is a member of the commission. Where the\r\nadministrative authority is a single commissioner he may be elected\r\nalong with other state officers, but this is the case in only a few\r\nstates.\r\n\r\nThe authority of the state highway department varies in the several\r\nstates, but in general the departments serve in the dual capacity of\r\ngeneral advisers to the county and township authorities on road\r\nmatters and as the executive authority responsible for the\r\nconstruction of those highways that are built entirely or in part from\r\nstate or federal funds.\r\n\r\nState highway departments consist of the commission or commissioner,\r\nand the technical and clerical staff required to perform the duties\r\nimposed on the state organization. To some extent the state highway\r\ndepartments are able to encourage economical and correct construction\r\nof highways by the township and county authorities by furnishing them\r\nstandard plans and specifications and by formulating regulations to\r\ngovern the character of construction, but such efforts are likely to\r\nbe more or less ineffective unless the state authority has supervision\r\nof the allotment of state or federal funds to the various counties and\r\ntownships. Nevertheless, most state highway departments do a great\r\ndeal of advisory work in connection with the highway construction\r\ncarried out by county and township authorities.\r\n\r\nState highway departments are supported by funds obtained in various\r\nways, laws differing greatly in this respect. The necessary support is\r\nin some states appropriated from funds obtained by general taxation,\r\nand is in others obtained from automobile license fees. In still\r\nothers, the funds are secured by a combination of the two methods\r\nmentioned above. In addition to these support funds, a certain part of\r\nthe money obtained as federal aid may be employed for the engineering\r\nand inspection costs on federal aid roads. The above mentioned funds\r\nare required to maintain the state highway department. In addition,\r\nthe departments have supervision of the expenditures of construction\r\nfunds which can be used for road construction and maintenance, and may\r\nnot be expended for salaries or other overhead expense.\r\n\r\nIn a number of states, automobile license fees are set aside for\r\nfinancing road construction and maintenance, and the work paid for\r\nfrom the fees is carried out under the supervision of the state\r\nhighway department.\r\n\r\nIn a number of instances, state bonds have been issued for road\r\nconstruction, and the expenditure of the proceeds of the sale of road\r\nbonds has usually been supervised by the state highway department.\r\n\r\nAll federal aid funds allotted to a state must be expended under the\r\ndirection of the state highway department.\r\n\r\n=Federal Administration.=--Federal authority in highway work is vested\r\nin the Bureau of Public Roads of the United States Department of\r\nAgriculture. The official head is the Secretary of Agriculture, but\r\nthe administrative head is the Director of the Bureau. In this Bureau\r\nare the various instrumentalities needed for carrying on\r\ninvestigations and furnishing information to the various states on\r\nhighway subjects. The Bureau also supervises the construction of\r\nfederal aid roads in a general way through district engineers, each\r\nof whom looks after the work in several states.\r\n\r\nFunds for the support of the Bureau of Public Roads are obtained from\r\ncongressional appropriations to the Department of Agriculture and from\r\na percentage of the funds appropriated for federal aid.\r\n\r\nFederal aid is money appropriated by Congress to be distributed to the\r\nvarious states to stimulate road construction. It is granted to the\r\nstates on the condition that the states will expend at least an equal\r\namount on the projects involved. The states in turn usually give a\r\nsuitable part of the state allotment to each county. There are various\r\nlimitations as to the amount of federal aid per mile of road and the\r\ntype of construction that may be employed, but these are matters of\r\nregulation that change from time to time.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that each of the administrative authorities, except\r\nthe Bureau of Public Roads, is to some extent subservient to a higher\r\nauthority, and the Bureau of Public Roads is supervised by the United\r\nStates Congress. Considerable diplomacy is required on the part of any\r\nadministrative authority if his contact with other officials is to be\r\nwithout friction. This is especially true in connection with the\r\nformulation of a policy regarding the types of construction to be\r\nadopted for an improvement. The responsibility for the selection is\r\nvariously placed on the township, county or state authority, the laws\r\nnot being uniform in this respect. If state or federal funds are\r\nallotted to an improvement, the state authority either makes the\r\nselection of the type of construction or the selection is made by some\r\nsubordinate authority subject to the approval of the state highway\r\ndepartment. Where the improvement is paid for exclusively with\r\ntownship or county funds, the selection is often made by the township\r\nor county authority without review by higher authority. Many abuses\r\nhave crept into highway administration through the unscrupulous\r\nmethods of promoters of the sale of road materials or road machinery.\r\nA great deal of the selling activity of the agents for these\r\ncommodities is entirely irreproachable, but it is well known that such\r\nis not always the case. As a result, the tendency of legislation is to\r\nrequire the state highway department to approve contracts for\r\nmaterials or construction entered into by the township or county\r\nauthorities. The state highway departments can secure the requisite\r\ntechnical experts to determine the merits of materials and equipment\r\nand, in spite of some glaring examples of inefficiency or worse, have\r\nmade a good record for impartiality and integrity as custodians of the\r\nfunds for which they are responsible.\r\n\r\n\r\nHIGHWAY FINANCE\r\n\r\nThe paramount problem in highway administration is the development of\r\nan adequate financial plan for carrying on road improvement. The\r\nnecessary expenditures are enormous, although the money so expended is\r\nprobably much less than the actual benefit resulting from the\r\nimprovements.\r\n\r\n=Special Assessments.=--There is presumed to be a direct and\r\nrecognized benefit conferred on farm lands by the construction of\r\nimproved highways adjacent thereto. Therefore, it is equitable to\r\ncharge a part of the cost against the lands so benefited.\r\n\r\nThe principle of paying for public improvements by a special\r\nassessment upon private property has been long established and a large\r\nproportion of the public improvements in the cities and towns have\r\nbeen made financially possible through the medium of special\r\nassessments on abutting and adjacent property. The same principle has\r\nbeen applied to the financing of drainage projects for reclaiming farm\r\nlands. Recently the special assessment method has come into limited\r\nuse in financing rural highway improvements. The policy in such cases\r\nis to assess the abutting and adjacent property in a zone along the\r\nimproved road for a percentage of the cost of the improvement. The\r\namount so assessed does not ordinarily exceed one-fourth of the total\r\ncost of the improvement and may be considerably less. The assessment\r\nis spread over an area extending back from one to six miles from the\r\nimproved road. The assessment area is generally divided into about\r\nfour zones parallel to the road. The zone next the road is assessed at\r\na rate arbitrarily determined as a fair measure of the benefit, and\r\neach succeeding zone is assessed at a somewhat lower rate. Generally\r\nabout three-fourths of the total assessment is placed on the half of\r\nthe assessment area lying next to the road.\r\n\r\nMany systems of making assessments have been proposed which are\r\nmechanical in application after the area and rate of distribution of\r\nbenefit have been established, but in practice it is always found\r\nnecessary to make adjustments on individual parcels of land because of\r\nvariation in benefits received and it is impossible to eliminate the\r\nexercise of human judgment in equalizing the assessments.\r\n\r\n=Zone Method of Assessing.=--The area to be assessed on each side of\r\nthe improved road is divided into zones usually four in number, but a\r\nlarger or smaller number of zones may be adopted. The rate for each\r\nzone is then arbitrarily determined. For a typical case, the first of\r\nfour zones would receive an assessment of 50 per cent of the amount to\r\nbe borne by the area; the second zone 25 per cent, the third 15 per\r\ncent and the fourth 10 per cent. Other percentages sometimes adopted\r\nare 45, 25, 20 and 10 and 60, 20, 15 and 5. The set of percentages\r\nfirst mentioned seems to insure the most equitable distribution for an\r\narea all of which is substantially equally productive.\r\n\r\nWhen a road, for the improvement of which an assessment is being made,\r\nlies on two or more sides of a parcel of land all of which is within\r\nthe assessment area, the rate is arbitrarily reduced to relieve that\r\nparcel of land somewhat, or the assessment is first spread as above\r\noutlined and afterward equalized as judgment dictates.\r\n\r\nIn applying the zone method some difficulty is encountered in\r\ndetermining an equitable distribution on those parcels of land lying\r\npartly in one zone and partly in another, but the rate may be arrived\r\nat with reasonable accuracy by pro-rating in accordance with the exact\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nIn. Fig. 1, let it be assumed that the assessment area is to be two\r\nmiles wide, one mile on each side of the road and the various\r\nownerships to be indicated by the parcels of land numbered 1 to 8, as\r\nshown.

In order to prevent\r\nunjust charges against such properties, laws usually limit the total\r\nassessment against any parcel of land to a fixed percentage of a fair\r\nmarket value or of the assessed value. The assessment on these parcels\r\nwould be reduced as seemed expedient and the deficit would be\r\ndistributed over the remainder of the area in the same manner as the\r\noriginal assessment was spread. In practice such re-distribution is\r\nordinarily made by the arbitrary adjustment in accordance with what\r\nthe authorized officials consider to be fair and equitable. The method\r\noutlined is merely a mechanical means of securing distribution and\r\nmust not be considered as an infallible method of making the\r\nassessment. It is always necessary to review the results in the light\r\nof the actual benefits to be presumed for each parcel of land.\r\nNevertheless, the method outlined will prove equitable in a majority\r\nof cases.\r\n\r\n=General Taxation.=--There is a general community benefit derived from\r\nthe construction of good roads in that the actual cost of marketing\r\nfarm products is lessened with a resulting lowering of the price to\r\nthe consumer. The benefit also accrues from the greater facility with\r\nwhich all community business may be conducted. The introduction of\r\nbetter opportunities for social, religious and educational activities\r\nin the rural districts which results from improved highways is also a\r\ncommunity benefit of no mean importance. A part of the cost of road\r\nimprovement may therefore be equitably paid from funds obtained by\r\ngeneral taxation.\r\n\r\nA considerable portion of the current expense of maintaining the\r\ntownship and county highway work and at least a part of the cost of\r\nmaintaining state highway activities is met from funds obtained by\r\ngeneral taxation. Likewise, the funds required for the amortization of\r\nbond issues are often obtained from general taxation although vehicle\r\nlicense fees are sometimes used for that purpose.\r\n\r\nGeneral taxes are levied on all taxable property in a political unit\r\nunder statutory provisions regulating the amount of the levy and the\r\npurpose for which the revenue is to be used. In the aggregate, the\r\nroad taxes are large but in the township or county the rate is\r\ngenerally small compared to some other taxes, such as the school tax.\r\n\r\n=Vehicle Taxes.=--The great direct benefit derived by those who\r\nactually operate vehicles over the roads justifies the policy of\r\nrequiring a vehicle to pay a license fee in lieu of other taxes, the\r\nfunds so obtained to be used for the construction and maintenance of\r\npublic highways. In practice, this method has already been applied to\r\nmotor vehicles in most states and has proven to be an important source\r\nof revenue. Its application to horse-drawn vehicles has not been\r\nattempted, due probably to the fact that such horse-drawn vehicles as\r\nuse the public highways are also employed about the farm or in the\r\ntowns and the determination of an equitable basis for taxation\r\ninvolves many difficulties.\r\n\r\nThe rate of the fee for motor vehicles should be based on their\r\ndestructive effect on the road so far as that is possible. The scale\r\nof fees should therefore take account of weight and speed of vehicle\r\nand if the license is in lieu of all other taxes, it should also be\r\ngraduated with the cost of the vehicle.\r\n\r\nWhen funds are thus derived, every precaution should be taken to\r\ninsure that the money is used judiciously for construction and\r\nespecially for maintenance on those roads most useful to motor\r\ntraffic.\r\n\r\n=Highway Bonds.=--Bond issues for road improvement afford a means of\r\nconstructing roads and paying for them while they are being used. A\r\nvery large volume of such bonds are outstanding in the United States.\r\nRoad bonds should be issued only for durable types of improvement and\r\nthe life of the bond should be well within the probable useful life of\r\nthe road surface. It is customary and highly desirable that the\r\ngeneral nature and extent of the improvement be established before the\r\nbonds are issued. It is desirable that bond issues be subject to\r\napproval by referendum before issue and that is provided in every\r\ninstance.\r\n\r\nHighway bonds are of three classes known as Sinking Fund, Annuity and\r\nSerial Bonds, respectively. The earlier bonds issued were almost all\r\nof the sinking fund class, but in recent years the serial bond has\r\nbeen widely employed and is probably the most satisfactory to\r\nadminister.\r\n\r\n=Sinking Fund Bonds.=[1]--When this type of bond is employed, the\r\namount of the expenditure for road improvement is determined upon and\r\nthe length of the period during which tax payments shall be made is\r\nsettled. To employ a concrete example, it may be assumed that $100,000\r\nis to be expended for road work and is to be paid at the end of ten\r\nyears. The interest rate on the bonds will vary with the condition of\r\nthe bond market and the stability of the political unit issuing the\r\nbonds, but is usually about 5 per cent. Knowing these factors, the\r\namount to be added to the sinking fund each year is computed. In order\r\nto pay the interest on the bonds, a tax of suitable rate is levied,\r\nand in order to retire the bonds at the end of the period, a sum is\r\nset aside each year which is supposed to be invested and draw interest\r\nwhich will be added to the principle, and the principle and interest\r\ncomprise the sinking fund. The principle of the sinking fund is\r\nobtained by tax levies, a sum being added to the principle of the\r\nsinking fund each year.\r\n\r\n    [1] For a more detailed discussion of highway bonds see Bulletin\r\n    136, U. S. Dept. of Agriculture, which is the basis of this\r\n    discussion.\r\n\r\nThe success of this method of financing depends upon the proper\r\nadministration of the sinking fund. It must be invested with fidelity\r\nand the fund be kept intact. Usually the sinking fund cannot be\r\ninvested at as high a rate of interest as the bonds bear and there is\r\nsome loss as a result. Road bonds bearing 5 per cent interest can\r\nusually be sold at par while the sinking fund will usually net about 3\r\nor 3-1/2 per cent interest. The total cost of a bond issue will be\r\ngreater by the sinking fund method than by either of the other methods\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n=Annuity Bonds.=--Annuity bonds are drawn in such a manner that the\r\namount of the payment for principle and interest is the same each year\r\nduring the life of the bond. When the amount of the issue and the rate\r\nof interest has been determined and the amount of the desired annual\r\npayment has been determined, the number of years the bonds must run is\r\ncomputed.\r\n\r\nThis method is convenient in that the amount of the tax to be levied\r\neach year remains constant.\r\n\r\n=Serial Bonds.=--Serial bonds are drawn so that a uniform amount of\r\nthe principle is retired each year after retirement starts and the\r\ntotal interest payments decrease each year after the first bonds are\r\nretired. The first bond may not be retired for a number of years after\r\nthe issue of the bonds, but when it once starts retirement proceeds at\r\na constant rate annually.\r\n\r\n=Comparison of Methods of Issuing Bonds.=--The relative costs of\r\nfinancing by either of the three methods depends upon the rate of\r\ninterest in each case and the net rate secured on the sinking fund\r\nprovided for retiring sinking fund bonds.\r\n\r\nFor comparative purposes, some typical examples are given in Table 3.\r\nThese illustrate the differences in total cost of securing $100,000 by\r\neach of the three methods at various interest rates.\r\n\r\n  TABLE 3\r\n\r\n  TOTAL COST OF A LOAN OF $100,000 FOR 20 YEARS, INTEREST\r\n  COMPOUNDED ANNUALLY\r\n\r\n  ---------+---------------------------------------+---------+---------\r\n  Annual   |        Sinking Fund Compounded        |         |\r\n  Interest |              Annually at              |         |\r\n  on Bonds +----------+----------------+-----------+ Annuity |  Serial\r\n           |3 per cent| 3-1/2 per cent | 4 per cent|         |\r\n  ---------+----------+----------------+-----------+---------+---------\r\n  4        | $154,431 | $150,722       | $147,163  |$147,163 | $142,000\r\n  4-1/2    |  164,431 |  160,722       |  157,163  | 153,752 |  147,250\r\n  5        |  174,431 |  170,722       |  167,163  | 160,485 |  152,500\r\n  5-1/2    |  184,431 |  180,722       |  177,163  | 167,359 |  157,750\r\n  6        |  194,431 |  190,722       |  187,163  | 174,369 |  163,000\r\n  ---------+----------+----------------+-----------+---------+---------\r\n\r\n=Desirability of Road Bonds.=--In theory the bond method of financing\r\nenables the highway authorities to construct a large mileage of roads\r\nin a few years and spreads the cost over the period during which the\r\npublic is being benefited. Better prices are obtained on contracts for\r\na large mileage than for smaller jobs, and the community can receive\r\nthe benefit more quickly than where construction proceeds piecemeal\r\nwith current funds. The vital consideration is to insure that the term\r\nof the bonds is well within the useful life of the road, and that\r\nample provision is made to maintain the roads during that period.\r\nUnder proper restrictions the bond method of financing is to be\r\ncommended. The bonds are an attractive investment and readily\r\nmarketable on satisfactory terms.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nDRAINAGE OF ROADS\r\n\r\n\r\n=The Necessity for Drainage.=--The importance of drainage for all\r\nroads subject to the effects of storm or underground water has always\r\nbeen recognized by road builders, but during recent years constantly\r\nincreasing attention has been given to this phase of road\r\nconstruction. It is unfortunate that there has in the past been some\r\ntendency to consider elaborate drainage provisions less necessary\r\nwhere rigid types of surfaces were employed. It has become apparent,\r\nfrom the nature of the defects observed in all sorts of road surfaces,\r\nthat to neglect or minimize the importance of drainage in connection\r\nwith either earth roads or any class of surfaced roads is to invite\r\nrapid deterioration of some sections of the roadway surface and to add\r\nto maintenance costs.\r\n\r\nThe degree to which lack of drainage provisions affect the\r\nserviceability of the road surface varies with the amount of\r\nprecipitation in the locality and the manner in which it is\r\ndistributed throughout the year. In the humid areas of the United\r\nStates, which are, roughly, those portions east of a north and south\r\nline passing through Omaha and Kansas City, together with the northern\r\npart of the Pacific slope, precipitation is generally in excess of 30\r\ninches per year and fairly well distributed throughout the year, but\r\nwith seasonal variations in rate. In these areas, the effect of the\r\nprecipitation, both as regards its tendency to lower the stability of\r\nsoils and as an eroding agent, must be carefully provided against in\r\nhighway design.\r\n\r\nOutside of the areas mentioned above, the precipitation is much less\r\nthan 30 inches per year and its effect as an agent of erosion is of\r\ngreatest significance, although in restricted areas there may be short\r\nperiods when the soil is made unstable by ground water.\r\n\r\n=Importance of Design.=--The drainage system for a proposed road\r\nimprovement ought to be designed with as much care as any other\r\nelement, and, to do so, a study must be made of all factors that have\r\nany bearing on the drainage requirements and the probable\r\neffectiveness of the proposed drainage system. The well established\r\nprinciples of land drainage should be followed so far as applicable.\r\n\r\nThe basic principle of road drainage is to minimize the effect of\r\nwater to such an extent that there will always be a layer of\r\ncomparatively dry soil of appreciable thickness under the traveled\r\npart of the road. This layer should probably never be less than two\r\nfeet thick and for soils of a structure favorable to capillary action\r\nit should be at least three feet thick. The means employed to\r\naccomplish the requisite drainage will be as various as the conditions\r\nencountered.\r\n\r\n=Surface Drainage.=--The drainage method which is by far the most\r\nnearly general in application is that which utilizes open ditches, and\r\nthe system which employs these ditches is usually referred to as\r\nsurface drainage. The full possibilities of this method of minimizing\r\nthe effects of storm water are rarely fully utilized in road\r\nconstruction. Very frequently, deterioration of a road surface is\r\ndirectly attributable to failure to provide adequately for the removal\r\nof the storm water or water from the melting of snow that has fallen\r\non the road, or water that flows to the road from land adjacent\r\nthereto. Surface water can usually most cheaply and expeditiously be\r\ncarried away in open ditches, although special conditions are\r\noccasionally encountered which require supplementary tile drains. The\r\ncross section commonly adopted for roads lends itself naturally to the\r\nconstruction of drainage ditches at the sides of the traveled way, and\r\nthese are usually the principal dependence for the disposal of storm\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n=Run-off.=--The capacity required of side ditches to insure\r\nsatisfactory surface drainage will be affected by the amount and\r\nnature of the precipitation in the region where the road is built. The\r\nannual rainfall in a region may amount to several feet, but may be\r\nwell distributed throughout the year with an absence of excessive\r\nrainfall for short periods, that is, flood conditions may rarely\r\noccur. In other areas, the annual rainfall may be comparatively small\r\nbut the precipitation occurs at a very high rate, that is, flood\r\nconditions may be common, or it may be at a low rate extending over a\r\nconsiderable period. These peculiarities must be known before an\r\nadequate drainage system can be planned.\r\n\r\nIt is almost universally true in the United States that precipitation\r\nat a very high rate will be for a relatively short duration, and\r\nduring these short periods, which usually do not exceed thirty\r\nminutes, a portion of the water that falls on the areas adjacent to\r\nthe road and that drains to the road ditches will soak into the soil\r\nand therefore not reach the ditches along the road. The extent to\r\nwhich the water is taken up by the soil will vary with the porosity\r\nand slope of the land and the character of the growth thereon.\r\nCultivated land will absorb nearly all of the water from showers up to\r\nfifteen or twenty minutes duration; grass land a somewhat smaller\r\npercentage; and hard baked or other impervious soil will absorb a\r\ncomparatively small amount. Rocky ground and steep slopes will absorb\r\nvery little storm water.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the road is designed to turn water rapidly to the\r\nditches, but when the material is the natural soil, there is always\r\nconsiderable absorption of storm water. Surfaces such as sandclay,\r\ngravel and macadam do not absorb to exceed 10 per cent of the\r\nprecipitation during short showers. Bituminous surfaces, brick and\r\nconcrete pavements, do not absorb an appreciable amount of storm\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nGenerally it is best to assume that if a rain lasts for forty-five\r\nminutes or more, all of the water will run off, as the soil will reach\r\na state of saturation in that time. This is not true of deep sand, but\r\nis for nearly all other soils.\r\n\r\nThe ditch capacity needed will therefore depend upon the area drained,\r\nthe character of the soil, the slopes and the rainfall characteristics\r\nof the region, and upon the nature of the road surface.\r\n\r\nFor a required capacity, the cross section area of the ditch will vary\r\ninversely as the grade, because the velocity of flow increases with an\r\nincrease in the grade of the ditch. If the surface water must be\r\ncarried along the road for distances exceeding five or six hundred\r\nfeet, the ditch must be constructed of increasing capacity toward the\r\noutlet in order to accommodate the accumulated volume of water.\r\n\r\nThe velocity of flow varies not only with the grade, but with the\r\nshape of the cross section, cleanness of the channel, the depth of the\r\nwater in the channel, alignment of the channel and the kind of\r\nmaterial in which the channel is formed. It is not necessary to go to\r\ngreat refinement in the design of the side ditches for the ordinary\r\ncase where the water is carried along the road for only a few hundred\r\nfeet. The ditches are made of ample capacity by using the commonly\r\naccepted cross section for a road, which will be discussed in a later\r\nparagraph. But where large areas must be drained by the road ditches,\r\nit is desirable carefully to design the side ditches. The basis for\r\nthat design is too lengthy to be included herein, and reference should\r\nbe made to a standard treatise on the subject.\r\n\r\n=Ordinary Design of Ditches.=--For grades of one per cent or less on\r\nroads in the humid area, the bottom of the ditch should be at least\r\nthree and one-half feet lower than the traveled surface of the road,\r\nexcept for very sandy soil. For grades greater than one per cent, this\r\ndepth may be decreased one foot, and for grades of four per cent and\r\nupward, the depth may be still less. These general rules for depth are\r\nsusceptible of variation but are believed to be the minimum except in\r\narid or semi-arid climates. It is far better to be too liberal in\r\nditch allowance than to be too conservative. In arid or semi-arid\r\nregions, the ditch design will be based on the necessity of providing\r\nfor flood flow and preventing damage through erosion. Ordinary\r\ndrainage requirements will be satisfactory with the ditch about one\r\nfoot deep.\r\n\r\nIf the topography is such that it is evident considerable storm water\r\nwill flow from the adjacent land to the road ditches, the design must\r\nbe modified to take this into account. Sometimes such water can be\r\ndiverted by ditches well back from the road, and thus prevented from\r\nflowing into the side ditches along the roadway. It is especially\r\ndesirable to divert water, which would otherwise flow down the slope\r\nof a cut, by means of a ditch on the hill-side above the upper edge of\r\nthe slope of the cut.\r\n\r\nDitches are not effective unless they afford a free flow throughout\r\ntheir length and have an outlet to a drainage channel of ample\r\ncapacity. Therefore, ditch grades should be established by survey,\r\nespecially if the gradient is less than one per cent, and the\r\nconstruction work should be checked to insure that the ditch is\r\nactually constructed as planned. A few high places in the ditch will\r\ngreatly reduce the effectiveness, although these may appear at the\r\ntime of construction to be slight. Constricted places, such as might\r\nbe due to a small amount of loose earth left in the ditch, are always\r\nto be avoided.\r\n\r\nWhere the side ditch passes from a cut to the berm alongside a fill,\r\nthe ditch should be excavated throughout in the undisturbed natural\r\nsoil, five feet or more from the toe of the slope of the fill, and\r\nalong the filled portion of the road there should be a berm of three\r\nor four feet between the toe of the slope of the fill and the near\r\nedge of the ditch.\r\n\r\n=Underground Water.=--In a preceding paragraph, mention was made of\r\nthe fact that only a part of the storm water runs off over the surface\r\nof the ground, the larger part being absorbed by the soil. The water\r\nthus absorbed flows downward through the pores in the soil until it is\r\ndeflected laterally by some physical characteristic of the soil\r\nstructure. The movement of underground water is affected by many\r\ncircumstances, but only two conditions need be discussed herein.\r\n\r\nUnderground water, like surface water, tends to attain a level\r\nsurface, but in so doing it may need to flow long distances through\r\nthe pores of the soil, and to overcome the resistance incident to so\r\ndoing some head will be required. That is to say, the water will be\r\nhigher at some places than at others. If a cut is made in grading the\r\nroad, the road surface may actually be lower than the ground water\r\nlevel in the land adjoining the road. As a result, the water will seep\r\nout of the side slopes in the cut and keep the ditches wet, or even\r\nfurnish enough water to occasion a flow in the ditch. Similarly, the\r\nhigher head of the underground water near the top of a hill may result\r\nin ground water coming quite close to the surface some distance down\r\nthe hill. The remedy in both cases is tile underdrains alongside the\r\nroad to lower the ground water level so that it cannot affect the road\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nSometimes the ground water encounters an impervious stratum as it\r\nflows downward through the soil, or one that is less pervious than the\r\nsurface soil. When such is the case, the water will follow along this\r\nstratum, and should there be an outcrop of the dense stratum, a spring\r\nwill be found at that place. This may be on a highway. The impervious\r\nstratum may not actually outcrop but may lie only a few feet under the\r\nsurface of the road, in which case, the road surface will be so water\r\nsoaked as to be unstable. The so-called \"seepy places\" so often noted\r\nalong a road are generally the result of this condition. This\r\ncondition can be corrected by tile laid so as to intercept the flow at\r\na depth that precludes damage to the road. Commonly, the tile will be\r\nlaid diagonally across the road some distance above the section where\r\nthe effect of the water is noted, and will be turned parallel to the\r\nroad at the ditch line and carried under one of the side ditches to an\r\noutlet.\r\n\r\n=Tile Drains.=--Where the soil and climatic conditions are such that\r\nthe roadway at times becomes unstable because of underground water\r\nrising to a level not far below the road surface, the ground water\r\nlevel is lowered by means of tile underdrains. The function of the\r\ntile drains in such cases is precisely the same as when employed in\r\nland drainage; to lower the ground water level.\r\n\r\n=Laying Tile.=--The tile lines are usually laid in trenches parallel\r\nto the center line of the road near the ditch line and at least 4 feet\r\ndeep so as to keep the ground water level well down. They must be\r\ncarefully laid to line and grade. A good outlet must be provided and\r\nthe last few joints of pipe should be bell-and-spigot sewer pipe with\r\nthe joints filled with cement mortar. The opening of the tile should\r\nbe covered with a coarse screen to prevent animals from nesting in the\r\ntile.\r\n\r\nIt is frequently necessary to lay a line of tile at the toe of the\r\nslope in cuts to intercept water that will percolate under the road\r\nfrom the banks at the sides. In some cases, it is desirable to\r\nback-fill the tile trench with gravel or broken stone to insure rapid\r\npenetration of surface water to the tile. In other instances, it is\r\nadvantageous to place catch basins about every three or four hundred\r\nfeet. These may be of concrete or of tile placed on end or may be\r\nblind catch basins formed by filling a section of the trench with\r\nbroken stone. When a blind catch basin is used, the top should be\r\nbuilt up into a mound, and for a tile or concrete catch basin, a\r\ngrating of the beehive type should be used, so that flow to the tile\r\nwill not be obstructed by weeds and other trash that is carried to the\r\ncatch basin.\r\n\r\n=Culverts.=--Culverts and bridges are a part of the drainage system\r\nand the distinction between the two is merely a matter of size.\r\nGenerally, structures of spans less than about eight feet are classed\r\nas culverts, but the practice is not uniform. In this discussion\r\nculverts will be defined as of spans of 8 feet or less.\r\n\r\nNumerous culverts are required to afford passage for storm water and\r\nsmall streams crosswise of the road, and their aggregate cost is a\r\nlarge item in the cost of road improvement. The size of the waterway\r\nof a culvert required in any location will be estimated by an\r\ninspection of the stream and existing structure, and by determining\r\nthe extent and physical characteristics of the drainage area.\r\nSometimes there is sufficient evidence at the site to indicate quite\r\nclosely the size required, but this should always be checked by\r\nrun-off computations. The drainage area contributing water to the\r\nstream passing through the culvert under consideration is computed\r\nfrom contour maps or from a survey of the ground, and the size of\r\nculvert determined by one of the empirical formulas applicable to that\r\npurpose. In these formulas, the solution depends upon the proper\r\nselection of a factor \"C\" which varies in accordance with the nature\r\nof the drainage area. Two of these that are quite widely used are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  _Myers' Formula: a = CA_\r\n\r\nWhere _a_ = area of cross section of culvert in square feet. _A_ =\r\narea in acres of the drainage area above culvert. _C_ a factor varying\r\nfrom 1 for flat country to 4 for mountainous country or rocky soil,\r\nthe exact value to be selected after an inspection of the drainage\r\narea.\r\n\r\n_Talbot's Formula_: Area of waterway in square feet =\r\n\r\n  _C_ [Square root of] ((Drainage area in acres)^3)\r\n\r\n     Transcriber's Note: The above formula used the mathematical\r\n     square root symbol in the original. One should read it as \"C\r\n     times the square root of the Drainage area in acres cubed.\"\r\n\r\n_C_ being variable according to circumstances thus:\r\n\r\n\"For steep and rocky ground _C_ varies from 2/3 to 1. For rolling\r\nagricultural country, subject to floods at times of melting snow, and\r\nwith length of valley three or four times its width, _C_ is about 1/3,\r\nand if stream is longer in proportion to the area, decrease _C_. In\r\ndistricts not affected by accumulated snow, and where the length of\r\nvalley is several times its width, 1/5 or 1/6 or even less may be\r\nused. _C_ should be increased for steep side slopes, especially if the\r\nupper part of the valley has a much greater fall than the channel at\r\nthe culvert. The value of _C_ to be used in any case is determined\r\nafter an inspection of the drainage area.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2. Design of Pipe Culvert and Bulkhead]\r\n\r\n=Length of Culvert.=--The clear length between end walls on a culvert\r\nshould be at least equal to the width of the roadway between ditches.\r\nThis is a minimum of 20 feet for secondary roads and ranges from 24 to\r\n30 feet for main roads. The headwall to the culvert should not be a\r\nmonument, but should be no higher than needed to prevent vehicles from\r\nleaving the roadway at the culvert.\r\n\r\n=Farm Entrance Culverts.=--At farm entrances, culverts are required to\r\ncarry the farm driveway across the side ditch of the road. These\r\nculverts are usually about 16 feet along, and should be of a size\r\nadequate to take the flow of the side ditch. The farm entrance culvert\r\nshould be of such design that it can be easily removed to permit\r\ncleaning out the ditches with a road grader.\r\n\r\n\r\nTYPES OF CULVERTS\r\n\r\nCulverts constructed of concrete and poured in place are called box\r\nculverts because of the rectangular form of the cross section.\r\nCulverts of pre-cast pipe are known as pipe culverts. Several forms of\r\npipe culvert are in general use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3.--Typical Concrete Box Culvert]\r\n\r\n=Metal Pipe.=--These may be of cast iron, steel or wrought iron. The\r\ncast iron pipe is very durable but expensive and heavy to handle and\r\nis not widely used in highway construction. Steel pipe has been\r\nemployed to a limited extent but its durability is questioned. At\r\nleast it is known that the pipe made from uncoated, light sheet steel\r\nis not very durable. Sheet iron and sheets made from alloy iron\r\ncoated with spelter have been extensively used and seem to be durable,\r\nespecially when laid deep enough to eliminate possibility of damage\r\nfrom heavy loads. To insure reasonable resistance to corrosion, the\r\nmetal sheets should be coated with at least one and one-half ounces of\r\nspelter per square foot of sheet and the sheets should not be lighter\r\nthan 16 gauge for small sizes and should be heavier for the larger\r\nsizes.\r\n\r\n=Clay and Cement Concrete Pipe.=--The ordinary burned clay bell and\r\nspigot pipe that is employed for sewer construction is sometimes used\r\nfor culverts. It must be very carefully bedded, preferably on a\r\nconcrete cradle and the joints filled with cement mortar. Culverts of\r\nthis type have a tendency to break under unusual loads, such as\r\ntraction engines or trucks. They may be damaged by the pressure from\r\nfreezing water, particularly when successive freezing and thawing\r\nresults in the culvert filling with mushy snow, which subsequently\r\nfreezes.\r\n\r\n=Concrete Pipe.=--Reinforced concrete pipe is a satisfactory material\r\nfor culverts, if the pipe is properly designed. The pipe should be\r\ncarefully laid on a firm earth bed with earth carefully back-filled\r\nand tamped around the pipe. The joints in the pipe should be filled\r\nwith cement mortar, or should be of a design that will be tight.\r\n\r\n=Endwalls for Culverts.=--A substantial retaining wall is placed at\r\neach end of the culvert barrel, whatever the type. This is to prevent\r\nthe end of the culvert from becoming choked with earth and to retain\r\nthe roadway at the culvert. It also indicates to the drivers the\r\nlocation of the end of the culvert. The endwall extends a foot or more\r\nbelow the floor of the culvert to prevent water from cutting under the\r\nbarrel. Plain concrete or stone masonry are most commonly used for\r\nculvert endwalls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4.--Two Types of Drop Inlet Culvert]\r\n\r\n=Reinforced Concrete Box Culverts.=--The pipe culvert is limited in\r\napplication to the smaller waterways. Reinforced concrete is\r\nextensively used for culverts of all sizes, but especially for the\r\nlarger ones. These are usually constructed with endwalls integral with\r\nthe barrel of the culvert. Culverts of this type must be designed for\r\nthe loads anticipated to insure suitable strength and stability, and\r\nmust be constructed of a good quality of concrete. Figs. 2 and 3 show\r\ndesigns for pipe and box culverts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5.--Drop Inlet Culvert]\r\n\r\n=Drop Inlet Culverts.=--In some locations erosion has begun in the\r\nfields adjacent to a culvert and it will probably continue until the\r\nstream above the culvert has eroded to about the level of the floor of\r\nthe culvert. This is a reason for placing the culvert as high as the\r\nroadway will permit, so long as the area above the culvert will be\r\nproperly drained. Considerable reclamation of land is possible if the\r\nculvert is constructed with a box at the inlet and as shown in Fig. 4.\r\nThe area up-stream from the culvert will not erode below the level of\r\nthe top of the box at the inlet end.\r\n\r\nWhere the stream crossing the road has eroded to considerable depth or\r\nhas considerable fall, as would sometimes be the case on side hill\r\nroads, the culvert barrel would follow the general slope of the ditch\r\nbut should have a drop inlet. This type of culvert is shown in Fig.\r\n5.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nROAD DESIGN\r\n\r\n\r\n=Necessity for Planning.=--Sometimes highway improvement is the result\r\nof spasmodic and carelessly directed work carried out at odd times on\r\nvarious sections of a road, finally resulting in the worst places\r\nbeing at least temporarily bettered. The grade on the steepest hills\r\nis probably reduced somewhat and some of the worst of the low lying\r\nsections are filled in and thereby raised. Short sections of surfacing\r\nsuch as gravel or broken stone may be placed here and there. From the\r\nstandpoint of the responsible official, the road has been \"improved,\"\r\nbut too often such work does not produce an improvement that lasts,\r\nand sometimes it is not even of any great immediate benefit to those\r\nwho use the roads. In nearly every instance such work costs more in\r\nmoney and labor that it is worth.\r\n\r\nLasting improvement of public highways can be brought about only\r\nthrough systematic and correlated construction carried on for a series\r\nof years. In other words, there must be a road improvement policy\r\nwhich will be made effective through some agency that is so organized\r\nthat its policies will be perpetuated and is clothed with enough\r\nauthority to be capable of enforcing the essential features of good\r\ndesign and of securing the proper construction of improvements.\r\n\r\nDetails of highway construction and design must vary with many local\r\nconditions and types of surface. The limits of grades and the many\r\nother details of design may properly be adopted for a specific piece\r\nof work only after an adequate investigation of the local requirements\r\nand in the light of wide experience in supervising road improvement.\r\n\r\nNew ideas are constantly being injected into the art of road building,\r\nbut these are disseminated somewhat slowly, so that valuable devices\r\nand improvements in methods remain long unknown except to the\r\ncomparatively few who have the means for informing themselves of all\r\nsuch developments.\r\n\r\nIt follows then that the logical system of conducting road improvement\r\nis through an agency of continuing personnel which will supervise the\r\npreparation of suitable plans and direct the construction in\r\naccordance with the most recent experience.\r\n\r\n=Road Plans.=--The information shown on the plans prepared for road\r\nimprovement varies somewhat with the design and with the ideas of the\r\nengineer as to what constitutes necessary information, but in general\r\nthe plans show the existing road and the new construction contemplated\r\nin an amount of detail depending principally upon the character of the\r\nconstruction. Simple plans suffice for grade reduction or reshaping an\r\nearth road surface, while for the construction of paved roads, the\r\nplans must be worked out in considerable detail. The essential\r\nrequirement is that there be given on the plans all information\r\nnecessary to enable the construction to be carried out according to\r\nthe intentions of the engineer, that all parts of the work fit\r\ntogether, that the culverts are of the proper size and located at the\r\nproper places, ditches drain properly, grades are reduced to the\r\npredetermined rate, that excavated material is utilized and that an\r\nexact record of the work done is retained. Plans are indispensable to\r\neconomical road construction and the preparation of the plans is the\r\nwork of the expert in road design, that is, the highway engineer.\r\n\r\n=Problem of Design.=--The problem of road design is to prepare plans\r\nfor a road improvement with the various details so correlated as to\r\ninsure in the road constructed in accordance therewith the maximum of\r\nsafety, convenience and economy to the users thereof. The degree to\r\nwhich the design will be effective will depend to a considerable\r\nextent upon the financial limitations imposed upon the engineer, but\r\nskill and effort on the plans will do a great deal to offset financial\r\nhandicap and no pains should be spared in the preparation of the\r\nplans. Moreover, the plans must afford all of the information needed\r\nby the contractor in preparing a bid for the work.\r\n\r\n=Preliminary Investigation.=--The first step in road improvement is to\r\nsecure an adequate idea of the existing conditions on the road or\r\nroads involved. The detail to which this information need go will\r\ndepend entirely upon the purpose of the preliminary investigation, for\r\nbefore a definite plan is prepared, it may be necessary to choose the\r\nbest from among several available routes. For this purpose, it is not\r\nalways necessary to make an actual instrument survey of the several\r\nroutes. A hasty reconnaissance will usually be sufficient. This is\r\nmade by walking or riding over the road and noting, in a suitable book\r\nor upon prepared blanks, the information needed. The items of\r\ninformation recorded will usually be as follows: distances, grades,\r\ntype of soil on the road and nature of existing surface, character of\r\ndrainage, location of bridges and culverts and the type of each with\r\nnotes as to its condition, location of railway crossings and notes as\r\nto type, location of intersecting roads, farm entrances, and all\r\nsimilar features that have a bearing on the choice of routes. These\r\ndata can be obtained in a comparatively short time by a skilled\r\nobserver who may drive over the road in a motor car. Sometimes it may\r\nbe desirable to make a more careful study of some certain sections of\r\nroad and this may be done by waking over the section in question in\r\norder to make a more deliberate survey of the features to be\r\nconsidered than is possible when riding in a motor car.\r\n\r\nFactors other than relative lengths of routes will obviously determine\r\nthe cost of improvement and the comparative merits of the improved\r\nroads. Some special characteristic of a road, such as bad railroad\r\ncrossings or a few bad hills, may eliminate a route, or availability\r\nof materials along a route may offset disadvantages of alignment or\r\ngrade.\r\n\r\nIn special cases, complete surveys of routes may be required finally\r\nto select the best route, but these instances are few in number.\r\n\r\n=Road Surveys.=--When a road has been definitely selected for\r\nimprovement, a careful survey is made to furnish information for the\r\npreparation of the plans. This will consist of a transit survey and a\r\nlevel survey.\r\n\r\nThe transit survey is made by running a line between established\r\ncorners following the recorded route of the road, or if no records are\r\navailable or the road is irregular in alignment, by establishing\r\narbitrary reference points and running a line along the center line of\r\nthe existing road or parallel thereto. The topography is referenced to\r\nthis line in such completeness that it can be reproduced on the plans.\r\nThe level survey consists in taking levels on cross sections of the\r\nroad at one hundred foot intervals, and oftener if there are abrupt\r\nchanges in grade. Special level determinations are made at streams,\r\nrailroad crossings, intersecting roads or lanes and wherever it\r\nappears some special features of the terrain should be recorded.\r\n\r\nFrom the surveys and such other information as has been assembled\r\nrelative to the project, a plan is prepared which embodies a design\r\npresumed to provide for an improvement in accordance with the best\r\nhighway practice.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PROBLEM OF DESIGN\r\n\r\nIt will be convenient to consider separately the components of a road\r\ndesign, although in the actual design the consideration of these\r\ncannot be separated because all parts of the plan must fit together.\r\n\r\n=Alignment.=--The alignment of the road is determined to a\r\nconsiderable extent by the existing right-of-way, which may follow\r\nsection lines, regardless of topography, as is the case with many\r\nroads in the prairie states, or it may follow the valleys, ridges, or\r\nother favorable location in hilly country. In many places the roads of\r\nnecessity wind around among the hills in order to avoid excessive\r\ngrades. In designing an improvement, it is generally desirable to\r\nfollow the existing right-of-way so far as possible. But the element\r\nof safety must not be lost sight of, and curves should not preclude a\r\nview ahead for sufficient distance to insure safety to vehicles. The\r\nnecessary length of clear view ahead is usually assumed to be 250\r\nfeet, but probably 200 feet is a satisfactory compromise distance when\r\na greater distance cannot be obtained at reasonable cost. To secure\r\nsuitable sight distance, the curves must be of long radii, and where\r\npossible the right-of-way on the inside of the curve should be cleared\r\nof trees or brush that will obstruct the view. Where the topography\r\nwill not permit a long radius curve and the view is obstructed by an\r\nembankment or by growing crops or other growth, it is desirable to\r\nseparate the tracks around the curve to eliminate the possibility of\r\naccidents on the curve. This is readily accomplished if the road is\r\nsurfaced, but if it is not surfaced, the same end is accomplished by\r\nmaking the earth road of ample width at the curve.\r\n\r\nRelocations should be resorted to whenever they shorten distances or\r\nreduce grades sufficiently to compensate for the cost.\r\n\r\n=Intersections.=--At road intersections, it is always difficult to\r\ndesign a curve that entirely meets the requirements of safety because\r\nthere is not enough room in the right-of-way, and enough additional\r\nright-of-way must be secured to permit the proper design. It is not\r\nnecessary to provide an intersection that is adapted to high speed\r\ntraffic, where main roads cross, but, on the contrary, a design that\r\nautomatically causes traffic to slow up has distinct advantages.\r\n\r\nWhere a main route, improved with a hard surface, crosses secondary\r\nroads, it is satisfactory to continue the paved surface across the\r\nintersecting road at normal width and make no provision for the\r\nintersecting road traffic other than a properly graded approach at the\r\nintersection.\r\n\r\n=Superelevation.=--On all curved sections of road, other than\r\nintersections, account is taken of the tendency of motor cars to skid\r\ntoward the outside of the curve. This tendency is counteracted by\r\ndesigning the cross section with superelevation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 6]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 6, _F_ represents the tangential force that tends to cause\r\nskidding. _W_ represents the weight of the vehicle in pounds, THETA\r\n= the angle of superelevated surface _c-d_, with the horizontal _c-a_.\r\n_R_ represents the radius of the curve upon which the vehicle is\r\nmoving. _w_ is the component of the weight parallel to the surface\r\n_c-d_, _v_ = velocity of the vehicle in feet per second. _m_ = mass\r\nof vehicle = _W/g  THETA_\r\n\r\n\r\n                  _w_ = _W_ tan _THETA_\r\n\r\n\r\n               _mv^2_     _wv^2_\r\n       _F_ =  -------  =  ------\r\n                _R_        _gR_\r\n\r\nIf _F_ = _w_ there will be no tendency to skid; hence the rate of\r\nsuperelevation necessary in any case is as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n                         _Wv^2_\r\n      _W_ tan _THETA_ = -------\r\n                          _gR_\r\n\r\n\r\n                          _v^2_\r\n          tan _THETA_ = -------\r\n                          _gR_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe amount of superelevation required, therefore, varies as the square\r\nof the velocity and inversely as the radius of the curve.\r\n\r\nTheoretically, the amount of the superelevation should increase with a\r\ndecrease in the radius of the curve and should also increase as the\r\nsquare of the speed of the vehicle. On account of the variation in\r\nspeeds of the vehicles, the superelevation for curves on a highway can\r\nonly be designed to suit the average speed. At turns approaching\r\nninety degrees, the curve is likely to be of such short radius that it\r\nis impossible to maintain the ordinary road speed around the curve,\r\neven with the maximum superelevation permissible. It is good practice\r\nto provide the theoretical superelevation on all curves having radii\r\ngreater than 300 feet for vehicle speeds of the maximum allowed by\r\nlaw, which is generally about 25 miles per hour. Where the radii are\r\nless than 300 feet, the theoretical superelevation for the maximum\r\nvehicle speeds gives a superelevation too great for motor trucks and\r\nhorse drawn vehicles and generally no charge is made in superelevation\r\nfor radii less than 300 feet, but all such curves are constructed with\r\nthe same superelevation as the curve with 300 foot radius.\r\n\r\nThe diagram in Fig. 7 shows the theoretical superelevation for various\r\ncurve radii.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 7. Curves showing Theoretical Superelevation for\r\nVarious Degrees of Curve for Various Speeds of Vehicle]\r\n\r\nAt the intersection of important highways, the problem is complicated\r\nby the necessity for providing for through traffic in both directions\r\nand for traffic which may turn in either direction and the engineer\r\nmust provide safe roadways for each class of traffic.\r\n\r\n=Tractive Resistance.=--The adoption of a policy regarding the grades\r\non a road involves an understanding of the effect of variation in the\r\ncharacter of the surface and in rate of grade upon the energy required\r\nto transport a load over the highway. The forces that oppose the\r\nmovement of a horse drawn vehicle are fairly well understood and their\r\nmagnitude has been measured by several observers, but comparatively\r\nlittle is known about the forces opposing translation of rubber tired\r\nself-propelled vehicles.\r\n\r\nThe resistance to translation of a vehicle is made up of three\r\nelements: resistance of the road surface to the rolling wheel,\r\nresistance of the air to the movement of the vehicle and internal\r\nfriction in the vehicle itself.\r\n\r\n=Rolling Resistance.=--When the wheel of a vehicle rolls over a road\r\nsurface, both the wheel and the surface are distorted. If the wheel\r\nhas steel tires and the road surface is plastic, there will be\r\nconsiderable distortion of the road surface and very little of the\r\nwheel. A soft rubber tire will be distorted considerably by a brick\r\nroad surface. Between these extremes there are innumerable\r\ncombinations of tire and road surface encountered, but there is always\r\na certain amount of distortion of either road surface or wheel, or of\r\nboth, which has the same effect upon the force necessary for\r\ntranslation as a slight upward grade. When both the tire and the road\r\nsurface strongly resist distortion (as steel tires on vitrified brick\r\npaving), the resistance to translation is low but the factor of impact\r\nis likely to be introduced. Where impact is present, energy is used up\r\nin the pounding and grinding of the wheels on the surface, and this\r\nfactor increases as the speed of translation, and may be a\r\nconsiderable item. Impact is especially significant on rough roads\r\nwith motor vehicles, particularly trucks, traveling at high speed.\r\nThese two factors (impact and rolling resistance) combined constitute\r\nthe major part of the resistance to translation for horse drawn\r\nvehicles.\r\n\r\n=Internal Resistance.=--For horse drawn vehicles, the internal\r\nresistance consists of axle friction, which is small in amount. For\r\nself-propelled vehicles, the internal resistance consists of axle\r\nfriction and friction in the driving mechanism, of which gear\r\nfriction and the churning of oil in the gear boxes is a large item.\r\nInternal friction is of significance in all self-propelled vehicles\r\nand especially so at high speeds.\r\n\r\n=Air Resistance.=--At slow speeds, the resistance of still air to\r\ntranslation is small, but as the speed increases, the air resistance\r\nincreases rapidly and at the usual speed of the passenger automobile\r\non the road becomes a very considerable part of the total resistance\r\nto translation. This factor has no significance in connection with\r\nhorse drawn vehicles, but is to be taken into account when dealing\r\nwith self-propelled vehicles at speeds in excess of five miles per\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nMany determinations of tractive resistance with horse drawn vehicles\r\nhave been made from time to time and these show values that are fairly\r\nconsistent when the inevitable variations in surfaces of the same type\r\nare taken into account.

In Fig. 8 _W_ represents the\r\nweight of the vehicle, acting vertically downward, _w_ is the\r\ncomponent of the weight perpendicular to the road surface and _W_{2}_\r\nis the component parallel to the road surface.\r\n\r\n    _W_{2}_     = _W_ tan _THETA_.\r\n\r\n    tan _THETA_ = 0.01 × per cent of grade.\r\n\r\n    _W_{2}_     = 0.01 _W_ × per cent grade.\r\n\r\n    _W_{2}_     = 0.01 × 2000 × per cent of grade, for each ton\r\n                      of weight of vehicle.\r\n\r\n  Hence _W_{2}_ = 20 lbs. per ton of load for each one per cent of\r\n                      grade.\r\n\r\nThe gravity force acting upon a vehicle parallel to the surface on a\r\ngrade is therefore 20 lbs. per ton for each one per cent of grade and\r\nthis force tends either to retard or to accelerate the movement of the\r\nvehicle.\r\n\r\nLet _F_ = the sum of all forces opposing the translation of a vehicle.\r\n\r\n  _F = f_{r} + f_{i} + f_{p} + f_{a} + f_{g}_     (1)\r\n\r\nwhere\r\n\r\n  _f_{r}_ = rolling resistance of road surface.\r\n  _f_{i}_ = resistance due to internal friction in the vehicle.\r\n  _f_{p}_ = resistance due to impact of the road surface.\r\n  _f_{a}_ = resistance due to air.\r\n  _f_{g}_ = resistance due to grade, which is positive when\r\n      ascending and negative when descending.\r\n\r\nAll of the above in pounds per ton of 2000 lbs.\r\n\r\nLet _T_ = the tractive effort applied to the vehicle by any means.\r\n\r\n_T_ >= must be greater than _F_ in order to move the vehicle.\r\n\r\nBy an inspection of (1), it will be seen that for a given vehicle and\r\nany type of road surface, all terms are constant except _f_{a}_ and\r\n_f_{g}_. _f_{a}_ varies as the speed of the vehicle and the driver can\r\nmaterially decrease _f_{a}_ by reducing speed. _f_{g}_ varies with the\r\nrate of grade. For any vehicle loaded for satisfactory operation on a\r\nlevel road with the power available, the limiting condition is the\r\nfactor _f_{g}_. If the load is such as barely to permit motion on a\r\nlevel road, any hill will stall the vehicle. Therefore, in practice\r\nthe load is always so adjusted that there is an excess of power on a\r\nlevel road. If draft animals are employed the load is usually about\r\none fourth of that which the animals could actually move by their\r\nmaximum effort for a short period. With motor vehicles, the excess\r\npower is provided for by gearing.\r\n\r\nIf it be assured a load of convenient size is being moved on a level\r\nroad by draft animals, there is a limit to the rate of grade up which\r\nthe load can be drawn by the maximum effort of the animals.\r\n\r\nTests indicate that the horse can pull at a speed of 2-1/2 miles per\r\nhour, an amount equal to 1/8 to 1/10 of its weight, and for short\r\nintervals can pull 3/4 of its weight. The maximum effort possible is\r\ntherefore six times the average pull, but this is possible for only\r\nshort intervals. A very short steep hill would afford a condition\r\nwhere such effort would be utilized. But for hills of any length, that\r\nis, one hundred feet or more but not to exceed five hundred feet, it\r\nis safe to count on the draft animal pulling three times his normal\r\npulling power for sustained effort.\r\n\r\nThe limiting grade for the horse drawn vehicle is therefore one\r\nrequiring, to overcome the effect of grade, or _f_{g}_, a pull in\r\nexcess of three times that exerted on the level.\r\n\r\nA team of draft animals weighing 1800 lbs. each could exert a\r\ncontinuous pull of about 1/10 of their weight or 360 lbs. If it be\r\nassumed that the character of the vehicle and the road surface is such\r\nthat _f_{r}_ + _f_{i}_ + _f_{p}_ + _f_{a}_ = 100 lbs. per gross ton on\r\na level section of road, then the gross load for the team would be 3.6\r\ntons. The same team could for a short time exert an additional pull of\r\nthree times 360 lbs. or 1080 lbs. For each 1 per cent of grade a pull\r\nof 20 lbs. per ton would be required or _f_{g}_ for the 3.6 tons load\r\nwould be 72 lbs. for each per cent of grade. At that rate, the\r\nlimiting grade for the team would be fifteen per cent.\r\n\r\nIf, however, the character of the vehicle and the road surface were\r\nsuch that _f_{r}_ + _f_{i}_ + _f_{p}_ + _f_{a}_ = 60 lbs. per gross\r\nton on a level section of road, the gross load for the team on the\r\nlevel would be 6 tons, and the limiting grade 9 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe above discussion serves to illustrate the desirability of adopting\r\na low ruling or limiting grade for roads to be surfaced with a\r\nmaterial having low tractive resistance and the poor economy of\r\nadopting a low ruling grade for earth roads or roads to be surfaced\r\nwith material of high tractive resistance.\r\n\r\nIt may be questioned whether horse drawn traffic should be the\r\nlimiting consideration for main trunk line highways, but it is\r\ncertain that for a number of years horse drawn traffic will be a\r\nfactor on secondary roads.\r\n\r\nIn the case of motor vehicles, excess power is provided by means of\r\ngears and no difficulty is encountered in moving vehicles over grades\r\nup to 12 or 15 per cent, so that any grade that would ordinarily be\r\ntolerated on a main highway will present no obstacle to motor\r\nvehicles, but the economy of such design is yet to be investigated.\r\n\r\n=Energy Loss on Account of Grades.=--Whether a vehicle is horse drawn\r\nor motor driven, energy has been expended in moving it up a hill. A\r\npart of this energy has been required to overcome the various\r\nresistances other than grade, and that has been dissipated, but the\r\nenergy required to translate the vehicle against the resistance due to\r\ngrade has been transformed into potential energy and can be partially\r\nor wholly recovered when the vehicle descends a grade, provided the\r\nphysical conditions permit its utilization. If the grade is so steep\r\nas to cause the vehicle to accelerate rapidly, the brakes must be\r\napplied and loss of energy results. The coasting grade is dependent\r\nupon the character of the surface and the nature of the vehicle. In\r\nthe cases discussed in the preceding paragraph, the coasting grades\r\nwould be five per cent and three per cent respectively. For horse\r\ndrawn vehicles then the economical grades would be three and five per\r\ncent, which again emphasizes the necessity of lower grades on roads\r\nthat are surfaced than on roads with no wearing surface other than the\r\nnatural soil.\r\n\r\nThe theory of grades is somewhat different when motor vehicles are\r\nconsidered, since it is allowable to permit considerably higher speed\r\nthan with horse drawn vehicles before applying the brakes and the\r\neffect of grade can be utilized not only in translating the vehicle\r\ndown the grade, but also in overcoming resistances due to mechanical\r\nfriction and the air. On long grades, a speed might be attained that\r\nwould require the use of the brake or the same condition might apply\r\non very steep short grades. There is at present insufficient data on\r\nthe tractive resistance and air resistance with motor vehicles to\r\npermit the establishing of rules relative to grade, but experience\r\nindicates a few general principles that may be accepted.\r\n\r\nIf a hill is of such rate of grade and of such length that it is not\r\nnecessary to use the brake it may be assumed that no energy loss\r\nresults so far as motor vehicles are concerned. Where there is no turn\r\nat the bottom of the hill and the physical condition of the road\r\npermits speeds up to thirty-five or forty miles per hour grades of\r\nfive per cent are permissible if the length does not exceed five\r\nhundred feet and grades of three per cent one thousand feet long are\r\nallowable. It is a rather settled conviction among highway engineers\r\nthat on trunk line highways the maximum grade should be six per cent,\r\nunless a very large amount of grading is necessary to reach that\r\ngrade.\r\n\r\n=Undulating Roads.=--Many hills exist upon highways, the grade of\r\nwhich is much below the maximum permissible. If there are grades\r\nranging from 0 to 4 per cent, with a few hills upon which it is\r\nimpracticable to reach a grade of less than six per cent, it is\r\nquestionable economy to reduce the grades that are already lower than\r\nthe allowable maximum. It is especially unjustifiable to incur expense\r\nin reducing a grade from two per cent to one and one-half per cent on\r\na road upon which there are also grades in excess of that amount. The\r\nundulating road is not uneconomical unless the grades are above the\r\nallowable maximum or are exceptionally long or the alignment follows\r\nshort radius curves.\r\n\r\n=Safety Considerations.=--On hills it is especially desirable to\r\nprovide for safety and curves on hills are always more dangerous than\r\non level sections of road. Therefore, it is desirable to provide as\r\nflat grades as possible at the curves and to cut away the berm at the\r\nside of the road so as to give a view ahead for about three hundred\r\nfeet. Whether a road be level or on a hill, safety should always be\r\nconsidered and the most important safety precaution is to provide a\r\nclear view ahead for a sufficient distance to enable motor vehicle\r\ndrivers to avoid accidents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 9.--Types of Guard Rails]\r\n\r\n=Guard Railing.=--When a section of road is on an embankment, guard\r\nrails are provided at the top of the side slope to serve as warnings\r\nof danger, and to prevent vehicles from actually going over the\r\nembankment in case of skidding, or if for any reason the driver loses\r\ncontrol. These are usually strongly built, but would hardly restrain a\r\nvehicle which struck at high speed. But they are adequate for the\r\nprotection of a driver who uses reasonable care. A typical guard rail\r\nis shown in Fig. 9, but many other designs of similar nature are\r\nemployed. At very dangerous turns a solid plank wall six or eight feet\r\nhigh is sometimes built of such substantial construction as to\r\nwithstand the severest shock without being displaced.\r\n\r\nTrees, shrubs and the berms at the side of the road in cuts are\r\nparticularly likely to obstruct the view and should be cleared or cut\r\nback so far as is necessary to provide the proper sight distance.\r\n\r\n=Width of Roadway.=--For roads carrying mixed traffic, 9 feet of width\r\nis needed for a single line of vehicles and 18 feet for 2 lines of\r\nvehicles. In accordance with the above, secondary roads, carrying\r\nperhaps 25 to 50 vehicles per day, may have an available traveled way\r\n18 feet wide. Those more heavily traveled may require room for three\r\nvehicles to pass at any place and therefore have an available traveled\r\nway 30 feet wide. Greater width is seldom required on rural highways,\r\nand 20 feet is the prevailing width for main highways.\r\n\r\n=Cross Section.=--The cross section of the road is designed to give\r\nthe required width of traveled way, and, in addition, provide the\r\ndrainage channels that may be needed. In regions of small rainfall the\r\nside ditches will be of small capacity or may be entirely omitted, but\r\nusually some ditch is provided. The transition from the traveled way\r\nto ditch should be a gradual slope so as to avoid the danger incident\r\nto abrupt change in the shape of the cross section. The depth of ditch\r\nmay be varied without changing to width or slope of the traveled part\r\nof the road as shown in Fig. 10.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 10]\r\n\r\n=Control of Erosion.=--The construction of a highway may be utilized\r\nto control general erosion to some extent, particularly when public\r\nhighways exist every mile or two and are laid out on a gridiron\r\nsystem, as is the case in many of the prairie states. The streams\r\ncross the highways at frequent intervals and the culverts can be\r\nplaced so as effectually to prevent an increase in depth of the\r\nstream. This will to some extent limit the erosion above the culvert\r\nand if such culverts are built every mile or two along the stream,\r\nconsiderable effect is produced.\r\n\r\nWhere small streams have their origin a short distance from a culvert\r\nunder which they pass, it is sometimes advisable to provide tile for\r\ncarrying the water under the road, instead of the culvert, and, by\r\ncontinuing the tile into the drainage area of the culvert, eliminate\r\nthe flow of surface water and reclaim considerable areas of land.\r\n\r\nErosion in the ditches along a highway can be prevented by\r\nconstructing weirs across the ditch at frequent intervals, thus\r\neffectually preventing an increase in the depth of the ditch.\r\n\r\nWherever water flows at a velocity sufficient to produce erosion or\r\nwhere the drainage channel changes abruptly from a higher to a lower\r\nlevel, paved gutters, tile or pipe channels should be employed to\r\nprevent erosion.\r\n\r\n=Private Entrances.=--Entrance to private property along the highway\r\nis by means of driveways leading off the main road. These should\r\nalways be provided for in the design so as to insure easy and\r\nconvenient access to the property. The driveways will usually cross\r\nthe side ditch along the road and culverts will be required to carry\r\nthe water under the driveway. Driveways that cross a gutter by means\r\nof a pavement in the gutter are usually unsatisfactory, and to cross\r\nthe gutter without providing a pavement is to insure stoppage of the\r\nflow at the crossing. The culvert at a driveway entrance must be large\r\nenough to take the ditch water readily or it will divert the water to\r\nthe roadway itself. Generally end walls on such culverts are not\r\nrequired as in the case of culverts across a highway.\r\n\r\n=Aesthetics.=--Much of the traffic on the public highways is for\r\npleasure and relaxation and anything that tends to increase the\r\nattractiveness of the highways is to be encouraged. Usually the\r\nroadside is a mass of bloom in the fall, goldenrod, asters and other\r\nhardy annuals being especially beautiful. In some states wild roses\r\nand other low bushes are planted to serve the two-fold purpose of\r\nassisting to prevent erosion and to beautify the roadside. In humid\r\nareas trees of any considerable size shade the road surface and are a\r\ndistinct disadvantage to roads surfaced with the less durable\r\nmaterials such as sand-clay or gravel. It is doubtful if the same is\r\ntrue of paved surfaces, but the trees should be far enough back from\r\nthe traveled way to afford a clear view ahead. Shrubs are not\r\nobjectionable from any view-point and are to be encouraged for their\r\nbeauty, so long as they do not obstruct the view at turns.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nEARTH ROADS\r\n\r\n\r\nHighways constructed without the addition of surfacing material to the\r\nnatural soil of the right-of-way are usually called earth roads. But\r\nif the natural soil exhibits peculiar characteristics or is of a\r\ndistinct type, the road may be referred to by some distinctive name\r\nindicating that fact. Hence, roads are referred to as clay, gumbo,\r\nsandy or caliche roads as local custom may elect. In each case,\r\nhowever, the wearing surface consists of the natural soil, which may\r\nhave been shaped and smoothed for traffic or may be in its natural\r\nstate except for a trackway formed by the vehicles that have used it.\r\n\r\n=Variations in Soils.=--The nature of the existing soil will obviously\r\ndetermine the serviceability and physical characteristics of the road\r\nsurface it affords. That is to say that even under the most favorable\r\nconditions some earth roads will be much more serviceable than others,\r\ndue to the better stability of the natural soil. Some soils are dense\r\nand somewhat tough when dry and therefore resist to a degree the\r\ntendency of vehicles to grind away the particles and dissipate them in\r\nthe form of dust. Such soils retain a reasonably smooth trackway in\r\ndry weather even when subjected to considerable traffic. Other soils\r\ndo not possess the inherent tenacity and stability to enable them to\r\nresist the action of wheels and consequently grind away rapidly. Roads\r\non such soils become very dusty. These are the extremes and between\r\nthem are many types of soils or mixtures of soils possessing varying\r\ndegrees of stability, and, in consequence, differing rates of wear.\r\nSimilarly the various soils exhibit different degrees of stability\r\nwhen wet.\r\n\r\nIt is to be expected that soils will differ with the geographical\r\nlocation, for it is well known that there is a great variation in\r\nsoils in the various parts of the world. But wide differences are also\r\nencountered in the soil on roads very near each other and even on\r\nsuccessive stretches of the same road. It is for this reason that\r\nearth roads often exhibit great differences in serviceability even in\r\na restricted area.\r\n\r\n=Variation in Rainfall.=--The stability of a soil and its ability to\r\nsupport the weight of vehicles varies greatly with the amount of water\r\nin the soil. A certain small amount of moisture in the soil is\r\nbeneficial in that practically every soil compacts more readily when\r\nmoist than when dry because the moisture aids in binding together the\r\nparticles. But most soils also become unstable when the amount of\r\nwater present is in excess of that small amount referred to above and\r\nthe stability decreases very rapidly as the amount of water in the\r\nsoil increases.\r\n\r\nThe serviceability of an earth road will change continually as the\r\nmoisture content of the soil changes and consequently the general\r\nutility of the earth road system in any locality is dependent to a\r\nconsiderable extent upon the amount and seasonal distribution of\r\nprecipitation. The methods of maintaining earth roads appropriate to\r\nany locality must of necessity be adapted to the climatic conditions,\r\nand the amount of work required to give the highest possible degree of\r\nserviceability will be exceedingly variable from season to season and\r\nfrom place to place. In regions of great humidity, earth roads may be\r\nexpected to have a low average of serviceability, while in arid\r\nregions they may possess sufficient durability for a considerable\r\nvolume of traffic. The design adopted for earth roads and the methods\r\nof maintenance followed should therefore be carefully evolved to meet\r\nthe soil and climate conditions where the roads are located. These\r\nwill differ greatly throughout a state or even a county.\r\n\r\n=Cross Sections.=--The general principles of road design were set\r\nforth in Chapter IV. In Fig. 11 are shown typical cross sections for\r\nearth roads adapted to various conditions as indicated. It is not\r\napparent that one form of ditch is particularly preferable to the\r\nother and since some engineers prefer the V section and others the\r\ntrapezoidal section both are shown. It would appear that the V shaped\r\nditch is somewhat the easier to construct with the blade grader while\r\nthe trapezoidal is readily excavated with the slip or fresno scraper.\r\nThe ditch capacity required and consequently the dimensions will\r\ndepend upon the drainage requirements, as was pointed out in Chapter\r\nIII.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 11. Cross Section for Earth Roads]\r\n\r\n\r\nEARTH ROADS IN REGIONS OF CONSIDERABLE RAINFALL\r\n\r\nIn the zones where the annual precipitation exceeds 30 inches\r\ndistributed over several months, earth roads will be unserviceable for\r\na considerable period each year unless they are constructed so as to\r\nminimize the effect of water. This is done by providing for the best\r\npossible drainage and by adopting a method of maintenance that will\r\nrestore the surface to a smooth condition as quickly as possible after\r\na period of rainy weather or after the \"frost comes out\" in the\r\nspring.\r\n\r\nBefore the construction of the desired cross section is undertaken,\r\nall of the grade reduction should be completed, except for minor cuts\r\nwhich can be handled with the elevating grader in the manner that will\r\nbe described presently.\r\n\r\nWhere any considerable change in grade is to be effected, the earth\r\ncan be moved in several ways and of these the most economical cannot\r\nbe readily determined. Ordinarily a contractor or a county will use\r\nthe equipment that happens to be at hand even though some other might\r\nbe more advantageous.\r\n\r\n=Elevating Grader.=--Where the topography is such as to permit its\r\nuse, the elevating grader is employed in grade reduction to load the\r\nearth into dump wagons in which it is hauled to the fill or waste\r\nbank. The elevating grader consists essentially of a heavy shear plow\r\nor disc plow which loosens the earth and deposits it on a moving\r\ncanvas apron. The apron carries the material up an incline and\r\ndeposits it into a wagon which is driven along under the end of the\r\napron. When the wagon is loaded, the grader is stopped while the\r\nloaded wagon is hauled out and an empty one drawn into position. The\r\nmotive power for the elevating grader is either a tractor or five or\r\nsix teams of mules. For many kinds of work, particularly where\r\nfrequent turning is necessary or where the ground is yielding, mules\r\nare preferable to a tractor. The apron is operated by gearing from the\r\nrear wheels of the grader. Generally four mules are hitched to a\r\npusher in the rear of the grader and six or eight in the lead. This\r\nmethod of grade reduction is particularly advantageous when the\r\nmaterial must be hauled a distance of 500 yards or more, because wagon\r\nhauling in such cases is the most economical method to employ. A\r\ntractor may be used to draw the elevating grader and one having a\r\ncommercial rating of 30 to 45 horsepower is required.\r\n\r\n=Maney Grader.=--If the haul is long and the nature of the cut will\r\nnot permit the use of the elevating grader because of excessive grades\r\nor lack of room for turning, a grader of the Maney type may be used.\r\nThis consists of a scoop of about one cubic yard capacity, suspended\r\nfrom a four-wheel wagon gear. When loading, the scoop is let down and\r\nfilled in the same manner as a two-wheeled scraper or \"wheeler.\" The\r\npull required to fill a Maney grader is so great that a tractor is\r\nordinarily employed in place of a \"snap\" team. The tractor is hitched\r\nat the end of the tongue, without interfering with the team drawing\r\nthe grader. One team readily handles the grader after it is loaded.\r\nFor this service a tractor having a commercial rationing of 25 to 30\r\nhorsepower is required.\r\n\r\n=Wheel Scraper.=--For moving earth for distances between 150 and 500\r\nyards, the wheel scraper of a capacity of about 1-1/2 yards is quite\r\ngenerally employed. The soil must be loosened with a plow before it\r\ncan conveniently be loaded into the wheeler and a heavy plow is\r\nordinarily employed for that purpose. Two furrows with the plow will\r\nloosen a strip of earth about as wide as the scoop of the scraper and\r\nif more is loosened it will be packed down by the scrapers wheeling in\r\nplace to load. A helper or \"snap\" team is employed to assist in\r\nloading, after which the wheel scraper is handled by one team.\r\n\r\n=Slip Scraper.=--The slip scraper differs from the wheel scraper in\r\nthat the scoop is not suspended from wheels but is dragged along the\r\nground. It is drawn by one team and the capacity is two to five cubic\r\nfeet, but the material spills out to some extent as the scraper is\r\ndragged along and the method is not suitable for long hauls, 100 feet\r\nbeing about the economical limit.\r\n\r\n=Fresno Scraper.=--The Fresno scraper is one form of slip scraper\r\nrequiring four horses or mules for efficient work. It differs\r\nsomewhat from the ordinary slip scraper in shape and is of larger\r\ncapacity, but is a drag type of scraper much favored in the western\r\nstates.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHAPING TO PROPER CROSS SECTION\r\n\r\nIf a road has been graded so that the profile is satisfactory or if\r\nthe existing profile of the location is satisfactory, and the surface\r\nis to be shaped to a prescribed cross section, either the elevating\r\ngrader or the blade grader may be employed.\r\n\r\n=Elevating Grader Work.=--If the elevating grader is used in shaping\r\nthe earth road, the apron will be lowered and the material will be\r\nexcavated at the sides of the road and deposited on the middle\r\nportion. If slight changes in grade are desired, wagons will accompany\r\nthe grader and catch under the apron at the high places and haul the\r\nmaterial to the low places. After the earth has been deposited it must\r\nbe worked over to secure the correct cross section and be made\r\npassable for vehicles. This requires that clods be broken, weeds and\r\ngrass that are mixed with the earth be removed by harrowing and\r\nforking and that the surface be carefully smoothed with a blade\r\ngrader. This latter operation will have to be repeated several times\r\nbefore a satisfactory surface is secured. But this miscellaneous work\r\nis highly important and under no circumstances ought to be neglected.\r\nNothing so detracts from an otherwise creditable piece of work as\r\nfailure to provide a smooth surface for the use of vehicles. It is\r\nespecially uncomfortable for the users of a highway if sods and weeds\r\nin quantity are left in the road after it has been graded. The humus\r\nthat will be left in the soil as the vegetable matter decays increases\r\nthe porosity of the road surface making it more absorbent than soil\r\nwithout humus. This increases the susceptibility to softening from\r\nstorm water or ground water.\r\n\r\nThe tractor can advantageously be used to draw the elevating grader on\r\nthis class of work, but will be greatly handicapped if there are wet\r\nsections along the road, through which the tractor must be driven. In\r\nmany cases its use is prohibited by such conditions and for all-round\r\nservice of this character, mules are preferred for motive power.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 12.--Tractor-grader Outfit]\r\n\r\n=Use of Blade Grader.=--Heavy blade graders designed to be drawn by a\r\ntractor are suitable for shaping the earth road. Some of these have\r\nblades 12 feet long and excellent control for regulating the depth of\r\ncutting. Often two such graders are operated tandem. These machines\r\nhave a device which permits the operator to steer the grader\r\nindependently of the tractor. Thus the grader can be steered off to\r\nthe side to cut out the ditches, while the tractor continues to travel\r\non the firm part of the road. Earth moved with the blade grader is\r\nusually fairly free from large lumps and can readily be smoothed to a\r\nsatisfactory surface for the use of traffic. The sods and weeds will\r\nbe drawn into the road along with the earth just as they are when the\r\nelevating grader is employed. Precaution must therefore be taken to\r\neliminate them before the vegetable matter decays, and to smooth the\r\nsurface for the use of traffic.\r\n\r\n=Costs.=--The cost of shaping an earth road in the manner described\r\nabove will vary through rather wide limits because the nature and\r\namount of work to be done varies so greatly. Some roads can be graded\r\nsatisfactorily for $300.00 per mile, while others will cost $700.00.\r\nBut $425.00 per mile may be taken as an average for blade or elevating\r\ngrader work plus a moderate amount of grade reduction in the way of\r\nremoving slight knolls. For the amount of grade reduction necessary in\r\nrolling country, followed by grader shaping, $1000.00 to $1800.00 per\r\nmile will be required. The method is not adapted to rolling country\r\nwhere the roads are undulating and require some grade reduction on\r\nevery hill. For hilly roads one of the methods described for grade\r\nreduction will be required and the cost will obviously depend upon the\r\namount of earth moved. Averages of cost figures mean nothing in such\r\ncases as the cost may reach $10,000.00 per mile, or may be as low as\r\n$2000.00 per mile.\r\n\r\n=Maintenance.=--Regardless of the care with which an earth road has\r\nbeen graded, it will be yielding and will readily absorb water for a\r\nlong time after the completion of the work. The condition of the\r\nsurface will naturally deteriorate rapidly during the first season it\r\nis used unless the road receives the constant maintenance that is a\r\nprerequisite to satisfactory serviceability. The road drag is\r\ngenerally recommended for this purpose, and if a drag is properly used\r\nit will serve to restore the shape of the surface as fast as it is\r\ndestroyed by traffic.\r\n\r\nGood results with the drag depend upon choosing the proper time to\r\ndrag and upon doing the work in the right way when using the drag. The\r\nbest time to drag is as soon after a rain as the road has dried out\r\nenough to pack under traffic. If the work is done while the road is\r\ntoo wet, the first vehicles traveling the road after it has been\r\ndragged will make ruts and to a considerable extent offset the good\r\ndone by the drag. If the road is too dry, the drag will not smooth the\r\nirregularities. A little observation will be required to determine the\r\nproper time for dragging on any particular soil, but usually after a\r\nrain or thaw there is a period lasting a day or two when conditions\r\nare about right.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 13.--Road Drag]\r\n\r\nThe drag is used merely to restore the shape of the surface and to do\r\nso a small amount of material is drawn toward the middle of the road.\r\nBut there must not be a ridge of loose material left in the middle\r\nafter the work is completed. Some patrolmen start at one side of the\r\nroad and gradually work across the road on successive trips, finally\r\nfinishing up at the side opposite that at which the start was made.\r\nThe next dragging should start on the opposite side from the first if\r\nthat method is followed.\r\n\r\nBy shifting his weight on the drag, the operator can adjust the\r\ncutting edge so that very little loose material is moved crosswise of\r\nthe road and that is the proper method to pursue. In that case no\r\nridge will remain at the middle of the road. If a slight one is left\r\nit should be removed by a final trip with the drag.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the dragging, weeds must be cut along the road about\r\ntwice a year, the ditches must be kept cleaned out and culverts open.\r\n\r\nAll of the maintenance for 10 miles of earth road can be accomplished\r\nby one man giving his entire time to the work, and that is the only\r\nmethod that has proven adequate to the problem.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARTH ROADS IN ARID REGIONS\r\n\r\nIn areas where the rainfall is less than 18 inches per year, and\r\nespecially where it is 10 inches or less, an entirely different road\r\nproblem exists. The effect of precipitation is of significance\r\nprimarily from the standpoint of erosion, and the design of cross\r\nsection and ditches and the culvert provisions are entirely different\r\nfrom those necessary in humid regions.\r\n\r\nFrequently the rainfall in semi-arid regions will be seasonal and\r\nprovision must be made to care for a large volume of water during the\r\nrainy season, but, in general, road design is adapted to prevention of\r\nerosion rather than to elimination of ground water effects, or the\r\nsoftening effects of surface water. Generally the rainy period does\r\nnot last long enough to warrant expensive construction to eliminate\r\nits general effects. In fact, the saturation of the soil is more\r\nlikely to be a benefit than otherwise.\r\n\r\nEarth roads are likely to be satisfactory except where the traffic is\r\nsufficient to grind the surface into dust to such an extent that an\r\nexcessive dust layer is produced. In such locations the problem is one\r\nof providing a durable surface unaffected by long continued dry\r\nweather.\r\n\r\nGrade reduction will have the same importance as in humid areas and\r\nwill be carried out in the same way.\r\n\r\nMaintenance will consist in repairing the damage from occasional\r\nfloods and in removing or preventing accumulations of drifting sand\r\nor dust. Crude petroleum oils have been satisfactory for maintenance\r\nin such locations when used on stable soils.\r\n\r\n=Value of Earth Roads.=--The serviceability of the earth road depends\r\nto a large extent upon the care exercised in its maintenance. The only\r\npart of earth road construction that is permanent is the grade\r\nreduction. The cross section that is so carefully shaped at\r\nconsiderable cost may flatten out in one or two years, especially if\r\nthe road goes through unusually wet periods. Traffic will continually\r\nseek a new track during the period when the road is muddy and is as\r\nlikely to cross the ditch to the sod near the fence as to use any\r\nother part of the road. Continual and persistent maintenance is\r\ntherefore essential to even reasonable serviceability. At best the\r\nearth road will be a poor facility for a considerable period each year\r\nin the regions of year-around rainfall. In most localities, roads of\r\ndistinctly minor importance are of necessity only earth roads and for\r\nthe comparatively small territory they serve and the small amount of\r\ntraffic, they probably serve the purpose. For roads of any importance\r\nin the humid areas of the United States, the earth road cannot carry\r\nsatisfactorily the traffic of a prosperous and busy community.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nSAND-CLAY AND GRAVEL ROADS\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Chapter IV, mention was made of the variation in serviceability of\r\nroad surfaces composed of the natural soil existing on the\r\nright-of-way of the road. It has been found that soils of a clayey\r\nnature in which there is a considerable percentage of sand usually\r\nafford a serviceable road surface for light or moderate traffic,\r\nespecially in areas where climatic conditions are favorable. A study\r\nof these soils, together with the construction of experimental roads\r\nof various mixtures of sand and clay, has led to a fairly\r\ncomprehensive understanding of the principles of construction and\r\nrange of capacity of this type of road surface, which is known as the\r\nsand-clay road.\r\n\r\nThe sand-clay road surface consists of a natural or artificial mixture\r\nof sand and clay, in which the amount of clay is somewhat greater than\r\nsufficient to fill the voids in the dry sand. It may be assumed that\r\nthe sand contains 40 per cent of voids and that at least 45 per cent\r\nof clay is required to fill the voids and bind the sand grains\r\ntogether, because the clay spreads the sand grains apart during the\r\nmixing, thus having the effect of increasing the voids. As a matter of\r\nexperiment, it is found to be impractical to secure by available\r\nconstruction methods mixtures of sufficient uniformity to render it\r\nnecessary to exercise great exactness in proportioning the components,\r\nbut reasonable care in proportioning the materials is desirable.\r\n\r\nSuccessful utilization of this type of surface requires considerable\r\nstudy of available materials and investigations of their behavior when\r\ncombined. Extensive and exhaustive experiments have been conducted\r\nwith sand-clay mixtures in various places where they are widely used\r\nfor road surfaces and the following general principles have been\r\ndeduced.\r\n\r\n=The Binder.=--In the sand-clay road, stability is obtained by\r\nutilizing the bonding properties possessed to some degree by all\r\nsoils. Naturally this characteristic may be expected to vary widely\r\nwith the several types of soil. It is generally considered to be a\r\ncommon property of clay, but the term clay is a general one that is\r\noften applied to soils differing greatly in physical characteristics\r\nand the term therefore loses its significance in this connection.\r\nThose soils that are properly and technically called clay are\r\ndecidedly sticky when wet and are the best materials for sand-clay\r\nconstruction. Of the clays, those that produce a tough sticky mud are\r\nbest. This can be tested by mixing a small quantity into a stiff mud\r\nand molding it into a ball and immersing in water. If the ball retains\r\nits shape for some little time, it is likely to prove a very\r\nsatisfactory binder, but, if it becomes plastic and loses its shape,\r\nit will be an inferior binder, as a general rule. The ball clay, as\r\nthe former is called, may be of any color common to soils, not\r\nnecessarily yellow or reddish as is sometimes supposed. Likewise,\r\nballs of mixtures containing varying percentages of sand and the\r\nbinder to be used may be made up and immersed in water. The mixture\r\nthat holds its shape longest is of course the best combination of the\r\nmaterials and indicates the mixture to use in the construction.\r\n\r\nAn ideal, or even a fairly satisfactory soil for a binder may not\r\nexist in the vicinity of a proposed improvement, and consequently an\r\ninferior binder is frequently the only material available.\r\n\r\nSometimes deposits of clay or gravel contain a considerable percentage\r\nof gypsum which serves as a binder and is particularly effective when\r\nused in combination with clay and sand or gravel.\r\n\r\nIn many places a soil of the type used for adobe and called \"caliche\"\r\nmay be found and this is an excellent binder for sand or gravel.\r\n\r\n=Top-Soil or Natural Mixtures.=--Deposits consisting of a natural\r\nmixture of sand and clay in which the ingredients happen to exist in\r\nabout the correct relative proportions for sand-clay road surfaces are\r\nfound in many localities. These mixtures are commonly referred to as\r\ntop-soil. If the deposits are somewhat deficient either in sand or\r\nclay, they can be utilized if the proper corrections in the\r\nproportions are made during construction. Very satisfactory road\r\nsurfaces are sometimes constructed with mixtures that appear to be far\r\nfrom ideal in composition, but experience and frequent trials are\r\nneeded to determine the best way in which to handle these mixtures.\r\n\r\n=Sand-Clay Surfaces on Sandy Roads.=--Sand-clay surfaces may be\r\nconstructed on naturally sandy roads either by adding clay and mixing\r\nit with the sand to secure the desired composition, or a layer of a\r\nnatural sand-clay mixture, caliche or sand-clay-gypsum may be placed\r\non top of the sand.\r\n\r\nThe most widely used method is to mix clay or other binder with the\r\nsand. Since there is no need to provide for ditches to carry storm\r\nwater on a deep sand soil, the sand is graded off nearly flat across\r\nthe road and no ditches are provided. The clay is dumped on the road\r\nin a layer about 8 inches thick and is then mixed into the sand. It is\r\ndesired to mix enough sand with the clay to produce a mixture composed\r\nof approximately 1/3 clay and 2/3 sand. The mixing is accomplished in\r\nvarious ways, the most common being to use a heavy plow at first and\r\nto follow this with a heavy disc harrow. The mixing is a tedious and\r\ndisagreeable process, but its thorough accomplishment is\r\nindispensable. The mixing is most readily done when the materials are\r\nsaturated with water and in practice it is customary to depend upon\r\nrain for the water, although in the final stages water may be hauled\r\nand sprinkled on the road to facilitate final completion of the\r\nmixing. After the mixing has been completed, the surface is smoothed\r\nwith the blade grader and is kept smooth until it dries out. Repeated\r\ndragging will be required, during the first year especially, and to\r\nsome extent each year in order to keep the surface smooth, but the\r\ndragging can be successfully accomplished only when the road is wet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 14.--Cross Sections for Sand-Clay Roads]\r\n\r\nIn regions where several months of continued hot, dry weather is to be\r\nexpected each year, the sand-clay mixture is likely to break through\r\nunless it is of considerable thickness and generally the surface layer\r\nis made much thicker than for regions where the annual rainfall is\r\nfairly well distributed. This is especially necessary when the binder\r\nis of inferior quality. It is not uncommon in such cases to make the\r\nsand-clay surface as much as two feet thick.\r\n\r\nAs the mixing progresses it may appear that patches here and there are\r\ndeficient in either clay or sand and the mixture in these places is\r\ncorrected by the addition of a little sand or clay as may be\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nIf the top-soil is used it is deposited on the sand in the required\r\nquantity and is remixed in place to insure uniformity. If either sand\r\nor clay is needed to give a satisfactory mixture, the proper material\r\nis added and mixed in as the work progresses. The surface is finally\r\nsmoothed by means of the grader and drag.\r\n\r\n=Sand-Clay on Clay or Loam.=--If the existing road is of clay or loam,\r\nample drainage will be required as discussed in Chapter IV. The\r\nsurface may be constructed of a natural sand-clay mixture or of a sand\r\nmixed with the natural soil. If the former, the surface of the\r\nexisting road is prepared by grading so as to insure good drainage and\r\nthe natural mixture is then deposited and the surface completed as\r\ndescribed in the preceding section.\r\n\r\nIf the surface is formed by mixing sand with the existing soil, the\r\nsands may be deposited in a layer about six inches thick which will\r\ngradually mix with the soil as the road is used. A second application\r\nof sand may follow in a year or two if it is needed. Such a road\r\nsurface will lack uniformity of composition and it seems preferable to\r\nmix the sand with the soil by plowing and discing as previously\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n=Characteristics.=--Sand-clay road surfaces do not have sufficient\r\ndurability for heavily traveled highways, but will be satisfactory for\r\na moderate amount of traffic. These surfaces have maximum\r\nserviceability when moist, not wet, and consequently are not as\r\ndurable in dry climates as in humid areas. They are likely to become\r\nsticky and unstable in continued wet weather and to become friable and\r\nwear into chuck holes in long continued dry weather. At their best,\r\nthey are dustless, somewhat resilient and of low tractive resistance.\r\n\r\nGRAVEL ROAD SURFACES\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 15.--Cross Sections for Gravel Highways]\r\n\r\n=Natural Gravel.=--Gravel is the name given to a material consisting\r\nof a mixture of more or less rounded stones, sand and earthy material,\r\nwhich is found in natural deposits. These deposits exist in almost\r\nevery part of North America, being especially numerous in the\r\nglaciated areas, but by no means confined to them. Gravel deposits\r\nconsist of pieces of rock varying in size from those of a cubic yard\r\nor more in volume to the finest stone dust, but with pieces ranging in\r\nsize from that which will pass a 3-inch ring down to fine sand\r\npredominating. The larger pieces are usually more or less rounded and\r\nthe finer particles may be rounded or may be angular. Many varieties\r\nof rocks are to be found among the gravel pebbles, but the rocks of\r\nigneous origin and possessing a considerable degree of hardness\r\ngenerally predominate. Intermixed with the pieces of rock there is\r\nlikely to be clay or other soil, the quantity varying greatly in\r\ndifferent deposits and even in various places in the same deposits.\r\n\r\nOften there are found deposits of material which are by the layman\r\ntermed gravel, which are really clayey sand or sand containing a few\r\npebbles, but which are of value to the road builder for the sand clay\r\ntype of surfacing. The term gravel is exceedingly general and unless\r\nspecifically defined, gives little indication of the exact nature of\r\nto which it is applied.\r\n\r\n  TABLE 7\r\n\r\n  SHOWING CEMENTING PROPERTIES OF SEVERAL SAMPLES OF\r\n  GRAVEL\r\n\r\n  -----------------+----------------------------\r\n                   |       Cementing Value\r\n  Per Cent Clay by +---------------+------------\r\n      Weight       | As Received   |  Washed\r\n  -----------------+---------------+------------\r\n        4.4        |      276      |      43\r\n        6.4        |      105      |     285\r\n        5.1        |      241      |      70\r\n       14.5        |      500      |     279\r\n        8.5        |      500      |     112\r\n       10.1        |      300      |     267\r\n       14.8        |      500      |     107\r\n        7.5        |      184      |     198\r\n       16.5        |      500      |     428\r\n        2.0        |      185      |     239\r\n        1.5        |      500      |     500\r\n        4.5        |      212      |     204\r\n        2.5        |      116      |     363\r\n  -----------------+---------------+------------\r\n\r\nThe value of any gravel for road surfacing depends upon the degree to\r\nwhich it possesses the properties of an ideal gravel for road\r\nsurfacing. Ideal gravel is seldom encountered, but a consideration of\r\nits characteristics serves to establish a measure by which to estimate\r\nthe probable value of any deposit.\r\n\r\n=The Ideal Road Gravel.=--The ideal road gravel is a mixture of\r\npebbles, sand and earthy material, the pieces varying from coarse to\r\nfine in such a manner that when the gravel is compacted into a road\r\nsurface the spaces between the larger pebbles are filled with the\r\nfiner material. The pebbles are of a variety of rock that is highly\r\nresistant to wear so that the road surface made from the gravel will\r\nhave the quality of durability. The gravel possesses good cementing\r\nproperties, insuring that the pieces will hold together in the road\r\nsurface. The cementing property may be due to the rock powder in the\r\ndeposit or to earthy material mixed with the rock particles, or to\r\nboth. Table 7 shows the results of a number of tests made upon gravels\r\nand indicates that the cementing property of the gravel does not\r\nalways depend upon the clay content.\r\n\r\n=Permissible Size of Pebbles.=--The larger pebbles in the gravel are\r\nless likely to crush under loads than smaller pebbles of the same sort\r\nof rock, but if the rock is of some of the tougher varieties such as\r\ntrap, there is very little likelihood of even the smaller pebbles\r\ncrushing. If the pebbles are of rock of medium toughness, the smaller\r\npebbles might be crushed under the heavier loads. It is the usual\r\npractice to permit gravel to be used for the foundation course in\r\nwhich the pebbles are as large as will pass a 3-1/2-inch circular\r\nscreen opening, and for the wearing course, as large as will pass a\r\n2-1/2-inch circular screen opening. If larger pebbles are allowed in\r\nthe wearing course, the surface is certain to become rough after a\r\ntime. If the gravel is to be placed in a single course as is a very\r\ncommon practice, then the maximum size should not exceed that which\r\nwill pass a 2-1/2-inch circular screen opening.\r\n\r\nThe Wisconsin Highway Commission has constructed a very large mileage\r\nof excellent gravel roads and the sizes specified for their roads are\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n     \"_Bottom Course Gravel_.--Bottom course shall consist of a\r\n     mixture of gravel, sand and clay with the proportions and various\r\n     sizes as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"All to pass a two-inch screen and to have at least sixty and not\r\n     more than seventy-five per cent retained on a quarter-inch\r\n     screen; at least twenty-five and not more than seventy-five per\r\n     cent of the total coarse aggregate to be retained on a one-inch\r\n     screen; at least sixty-five and not more than eighty-five per\r\n     cent of the total fine aggregate to be retained on a two\r\n     hundred-mesh sieve.\"\r\n\r\n     \"_Top Course Gravel_.--Top course shall consist of a mixture of\r\n     gravel, sand and clay with the proportions of the various sizes\r\n     as follows:\r\n\r\n     \"All to pass a one-inch screen and to have at least fifty and not\r\n     more than seventy-five per cent retained on a quarter-inch\r\n     screen; at least twenty-five and not more than seventy-five per\r\n     cent of the total coarse aggregate (material over one-fourth inch\r\n     in size) to be retained on a one-half-inch screen; at least\r\n     sixty-five and not more than eighty-five per cent of the total\r\n     fine aggregate (material under one-fourth inch in size) to be\r\n     retained on a two hundred-mesh sieve.\"\r\n\r\n     \"_Screened Gravel and Sand Mixtures_.--Where it is impossible to\r\n     obtain run of bank gravel containing the necessary binder in its\r\n     natural state, screened gravel shall be used and the necessary\r\n     sand and clay binder added as directed by the engineer. Gravel\r\n     and sand shall be delivered on the work separately. Clay binder\r\n     shall be obtained from approved pits and added as directed by the\r\n     engineer.\"\r\n\r\n     \"_Run of Bank Gravel_.--When run of bank gravel is permitted\r\n     either for one course or two course work, the size shall not\r\n     exceed that specified for bottom or top course. If necessary, the\r\n     contractor shall pass all the material through a two-inch screen\r\n     for the bottom course, and through a one-inch screen for the top\r\n     course. When the work consists of only one course, the material\r\n     shall be of the sizes as specified for the top course. The\r\n     necessary binder shall be contained in the material in its\r\n     natural state, excepting that a small percentage of clay binder\r\n     may be added as directed by the Engineer.\"\r\n\r\n=Wearing Properties.=--A certain amount of grinding action takes place\r\non the road surface under the direct action of wheels, especially\r\nthose with steel tires. Where rubber tired traffic predominates, this\r\naction is much less severe than where steel tired vehicles\r\npredominate, but the tendency exists on all roads. In addition, there\r\nis distortion of the layer of gravel under heavy loads which causes\r\nthe pieces of stone in the surface to rub against each other and to\r\nwear away slowly.\r\n\r\nThe gravel road in the very best condition is slightly uneven but\r\nthere is comparatively little jar imparted to vehicles, and,\r\nconsequently, little impact on the surface. When somewhat worn, the\r\nimpact becomes a factor of some importance and the pounding of\r\nvehicles has a very destructive action on the surface. Soft pebbles\r\nwill be reduced to dust in a comparatively short time.\r\n\r\nThe degree to which any gravel resists the destructive action of\r\ntraffic depends upon the varieties of rock represented by the pebbles\r\nin the gravel. If the pebbles are mostly from rocks of good wearing\r\nproperties, that quality will be imparted to the road surface. If\r\nmostly from rocks of little durability, the same characteristic will\r\nbe imparted to the road surface. A very good general notion of the\r\nprobable durability of gravel can therefore be obtained by a careful\r\nvisual examination of the material and classification of the rock\r\nvarieties represented by the pebbles.\r\n\r\n=Utilizing Natural Gravels.=--Gravel road construction is advantageous\r\nonly when it can be accomplished at low first cost. This usually\r\npresupposes a local supply of gravel that can be utilized, or at any\r\nrate a supply that need not be shipped a long distance. In the nature\r\nof things, such deposits are likely to be deficient in some of the\r\ndesirable characteristics, and may be deficient in most of them. By\r\nvarious means, the defects in the materials can be partially corrected\r\nwhile constructing the road.\r\n\r\nIf the gravel deposit consists of layers of varying composition as\r\nregards size and clay content, the material may be loosened from the\r\nexposed face and allowed to fall to the bottom of the pit thereby\r\nbecoming mixed to a sufficient extent to produce a reasonably uniform\r\nproduct. If deficient in clay, it often proves feasible to add a small\r\npart of the clay over-burden, thereby insuring enough binder.\r\nSometimes adjoining deposits will consist one of relatively fine\r\nmaterial, the other of relatively coarse. These may be mixed on the\r\nwork by first placing the coarse material in a layer about 5 inches\r\nthick and adding the finer material in a similar layer. The two will\r\nmix very rapidly during the operations of spreading and shaping.\r\n\r\nWhen deposits contain pebbles larger than will pass a 3-1/2-inch ring,\r\nthese larger stones will prove to be undesirable if placed on the\r\nroad, as they are almost sure to work to the surface of the gravel\r\nlayer and become a source of annoyance to the users of the road.\r\nOversize stone can be removed while loading the gravel or while\r\nspreading it, if care is exercised and not too large a proportion is\r\noversize. It is preferable however to remove the oversize by means of\r\nscreens at the pit. Usually on large jobs the oversize is crushed and\r\nmixed with the supply so as to utilize what is really the best part of\r\nthe material.\r\n\r\nGravels deficient in bonding material are often encountered in\r\ndeposits where there is insufficient overburden to give enough\r\nadditional binder or where the overburden is of a material unsuitable\r\nfor binder. Such materials may be utilized by adding binder in the\r\nform of clay after the gravel has been placed on the road.\r\n\r\nAlmost any gravel deposit can be utilized in some way if the material\r\nis of a durable nature, regardless of other characteristics. The\r\nserviceability of a gravel road will depend largely on how nearly the\r\ngravel approaches the ideal, but variations in the manipulations will\r\ndo much to overcome deficiencies in materials.\r\n\r\n=Thickness of Layer.=--The thickness of the layer of gravel required\r\ndepends both upon the type of soil upon which it is placed and the\r\nnature of the traffic to which the road will be subjected. Gravel\r\nsurfaces should not ordinarily be constructed on highways carrying\r\nheavy truck traffic, but if gross loads of three or four tons are the\r\nheaviest anticipated, the gravel will be reasonably stable. On such\r\nroads, a layer of well compacted gravel ten inches thick will support\r\nthe loads if a well drained earth foundation is provided. If but\r\nlittle truck traffic is anticipated and loads up to three tons on\r\nsteel tires are the average, a layer 8 inches thick will be\r\nsufficient. In dry climates, a layer six inches thick will be\r\nadequate if it can be kept from raveling.\r\n\r\nOn secondary roads, carrying principally farm-to-market traffic, and\r\nnot a great volume of that, the above thicknesses may be reduced about\r\none-fourth.\r\n\r\nThe exact thickness needed for any particular road is a matter for\r\nspecial study on account of the variations in the gravels and in the\r\nsupporting power of the soil upon which they are placed.\r\n\r\n\r\nPLACING GRAVEL\r\n\r\n=Preparation of the Road.=--The roadway that is to be surfaced with\r\ngravel is first brought to the desired grade and cross section. It\r\nwould be advantageous if this could be done a year before the gravel\r\nis placed so that no settlement of the earth foundation would occur\r\nafter the gravel surface is completed. But if that is impractical, the\r\ngrading may be done just prior to placing the gravel, providing\r\nappropriate methods are adopted for securing compacted fills.\r\n\r\n=Trench Method.=--Two distinct methods of placing the gravel are in\r\ngeneral use, known as the trench method and the surface or feather\r\nedge method respectively. The method to adopt for any particular road\r\nwill depend largely on certain conditions that will be explained\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nIn the trench method, a trench of the proper width and depth for\r\nreceiving the gravel is excavated in the earth road surface and the\r\ngravel is placed therein.\r\n\r\nThe trench is formed by plowing a few furrows and scraping out the\r\nloosened earth with a blade grader. The loose material is generally\r\nmoved out laterally to build up earth berms or \"shoulders\" alongside\r\nthe gravel. Into this trench the gravel is dumped in the proper\r\nquantity to give the required thickness after being compacted.\r\n\r\nThe greatest care must be exercised in spreading the gravel to\r\neliminate unevenness where the loads were deposited. An ordinary blade\r\ngrader is one of the best and most economical implements to use for\r\nspreading the gravel. When the gravel has been deposited in the trench\r\nfor a distance of a thousand feet or more, the spreading is\r\naccomplished by dragging the surface repeatedly with the blade grader,\r\nthe work being continued until all waviness disappears. The gravel is\r\nthen thoroughly and repeatedly harrowed with a heavy stiff tooth\r\nharrow to mix thoroughly the fine and coarse gravel so as to produce\r\nas nearly a uniform mixture as may be. The gravel is then finally\r\nsmoothed with the blade grader.\r\n\r\nThe gravel may be compacted by rolling or may be allowed to pack from\r\nthe action of traffic. The former is greatly to be preferred where\r\npracticable. The rolling is performed with a three-wheeled\r\nself-propelled roller weighing about 8 tons and must be done while the\r\ngravel is wet. Generally a sprinkling wagon is used to wet down the\r\ngravel, but advantage is always taken of rains to facilitate the work.\r\nThe gravel must be spread in layers not over 5 or 6 inches thick to\r\nget the desired results, which means that for an ordinary gravel road\r\nabout 10 inches thick, the gravel will be placed in two layers of\r\nabout equal thickness, each of which will be rolled.\r\n\r\nThe gravel will compact slowly even if it is not rolled, but generally\r\ndoes not become stable until the material is thoroughly soaked by\r\nrains. Then it will begin to pack, but will become badly rutted and\r\nuneven during the process. During this period the surface must be kept\r\nsmooth by means of the blade grader. The drag does not suffice for\r\nthis purpose, tending to accentuate the unevenness rather than to\r\ncorrect it.\r\n\r\nIf gravel is placed in a trench in dense soil and rainy weather\r\nensues, sufficient water will be held in the trench to cause\r\nunevenness from foundation settlement and the gravel will become mixed\r\nwith the soil to some extent and be thereby wasted. Trenches cut from\r\nthe road bed upon which the gravel is placed, to the side ditches,\r\nwill relieve this condition by affording an outlet for the surplus\r\nwater. Nevertheless some difficulty may be expected if the trench\r\nmethod is used and wet weather prevails. If it is possible to close\r\nthe road against traffic until the road is dry the method is\r\napplicable. Moreover, in long-continued dry weather, the dispersion\r\nand loss of considerable gravel from the action of automobile traffic\r\nis avoided because the gravel is held between substantial earth berms\r\nand the gravel will pack better and hold its shape longer when\r\nconstructed by the trench method than otherwise.\r\n\r\n=Surface Method.=--The surface method is one in which the gravel is\r\nplaced on the graded earth road surface without earth shoulders to\r\nhold the gravel in place. It is also sometimes called the feather-edge\r\nmethod. Except for the manner of placing as just mentioned, the\r\nseveral operations are conducted in the same general manner as for the\r\ntrench method. The gravel does not compact as quickly as in the trench\r\nmethod and a considerable loss of material is likely to result from\r\nthe effect of automobile traffic while the gravel is loose. But it has\r\nthe advantage of being free from difficulties in wet weather and in\r\nsome locations is therefore preferable to the trench method. It is\r\nparticularly applicable to those projects on which the placing of\r\ngravel continues throughout the winter, the gravel being dumped and\r\nspread, to be finally smoothed and finished in the early summer.\r\n\r\n=Bonding.=--Where gravels deficient in binder are utilized, clay for\r\nbinder is sometimes added as the gravel is placed on the road. This\r\nmay be done by spreading the clay on top of the lower course of\r\ngravel, placing the upper layer and sprinkling and rolling until the\r\nclay squeezes up through the surface layer. It may also be\r\naccomplished by spreading dry clay on the upper course before it is\r\nharrowed and then harrowing to mix it with the gravel. Both methods\r\nare practiced, but the former is believed to be preferable. A third\r\nmethod is to separate the sand and pebbles and to mix the clay binder\r\nwith the sand and then spread the sand on top of the pebbles and mix\r\nby harrowing.\r\n\r\n=Maintenance.=--Gravel surfaces require careful maintenance,\r\nespecially during the first season the road is used. The gravel will\r\ncompact slowly and during the process will be rutted and otherwise\r\ndisturbed by traffic. It is important during this period to restore\r\nthe shape once a week or at least twice a month. The light blade\r\ngrader is usually employed for the purpose so long as the gravel is\r\nsomewhat loose. Later a drag of the type known as the planer will\r\nprove to be the most effective. Figure 16 shows a type of drag that is\r\nvery satisfactory for use on gravel roads.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 16.--Road Planer]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nBROKEN STONE ROAD SURFACES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe broken stone road surface, or macadam road as it is usually\r\ntermed, consists of a layer of broken stone, bonded or cemented\r\ntogether by means of stone dust and water. The surface may or may not\r\nbe coated with some bituminous material.\r\n\r\n=Design.=--It has been an accepted assumption that the macadam road\r\nsurface is somewhat more stable than the gravel road surface of equal\r\nthickness, and since this is probably the consensus of opinion of\r\nengineers familiar with both types, it may be accepted until\r\nexperimental data are available on the subject.\r\n\r\nThe thickness of the layer of macadam required for a road will depend\r\nupon the same factors that were considered in connection with the\r\nthickness of the gravel surface, i.e., kind of stone used, character\r\nof earth foundation and nature of the traffic.\r\n\r\nThe standard macadam surface where good earth foundation is to be had\r\nand where the loads do not exceed about four tons has for years been\r\neight inches thick. For heavier loads or inferior foundation, a\r\nsomewhat greater thickness would be employed, but the best practice\r\nwould probably provide a foundation course of the Telford type for\r\ndoubtful foundation conditions, especially for the extremely uncertain\r\ncases. For soils of very good supporting strength such as very sandy\r\nloam or deep sand or for arid regions where stable foundation is\r\nalways assured the thickness of the macadam might be reduced to six\r\ninches. It should be borne in mind that the broken stone road is not\r\nadapted to the traffic carried by trunk line highways in populous\r\ndistricts, but is rather a type permissible on secondary roads and\r\nusually adequate for local roads. It should never be employed for\r\nroads carrying any considerable volume of passenger automobile traffic\r\nor motor truck traffic. If surfaced with a bituminous material it will\r\ncarry up to 1200 passenger automobiles per day, but not to exceed\r\nfifty trucks.\r\n\r\n=Properties of the Stone.=--The stone employed for the broken stone\r\nroad should possess the qualities of hardness and toughness and should\r\nbe capable of resisting abrasion sufficiently well to have reasonable\r\nlife under the traffic to which it is subjected. Since the traffic may\r\nvary from very light on some roads to far beyond the limit of the\r\neconomical capacity of this type of pavement on others, it follows\r\nthat any particular deposit of stone might be durable enough for some\r\nroads, while for others it might be entirely inadequate. As a general\r\nrule it has been found that stone that wears away at a moderate rate\r\nwill, when used for water-bound macadam surface, result in a smoother\r\ntrackway than one that will wear very slowly. It is not therefore\r\naltogether certain that the most durable stone to be had should be\r\nselected for a particular road. This is especially true now that the\r\nwater-bound macadam surface has been largely superseded for trunk line\r\nhighways and other heavily traveled roads, and is employed in\r\nlocations where service conditions are not severe.\r\n\r\nThe stone employed for the water-bound macadam surface must possess\r\ngood cementing properties, because the surface depends for stability\r\nprimarily upon the bonding action of the dust from the broken stone.\r\nThis is in contrast to the gravel road, where little dependence is\r\nplaced upon the bonding effect of the rock dust. In preparing the\r\nstone for macadam surfaces, the ledge rock is crushed and screened,\r\nand in that way a supply of the finer particles, which are a part of\r\nthe output of the crusher, is obtained for use in bonding the\r\nsurface. This finely broken material, usually called screenings, is\r\nessential to the construction of the water-bound type of surface.\r\nRocks vary considerably in the cementing properties of the dust, but\r\nusually the rocks classed as \"trap,\" such as andesite, gabbro and\r\nrhyolite, and schist and basalt possess good cementing properties.\r\nLimestones usually possess good cementing properties, but some of the\r\ndolomitic limestones are of low cementing value. Quartz, sandstone and\r\nthe granites are of low cementing value.\r\n\r\n=Kinds of Rocks Used for Macadam.=--Limestone and chert are the two\r\nsedimentary rocks, employed most extensively for broken stone roads.\r\nThese rocks are found in widely distributed areas and vary in physical\r\ncharacteristics from very soft material of no use to the road builder\r\nto materials possessing considerable durability. It is desirable to\r\ncarefully test out the deposits of these materials before using to\r\nascertain the probable value of the rock, for the construction of the\r\nroad surface.\r\n\r\nOf the igneous rocks, those classed as trap are best known to the road\r\nbuilder and many of the deposits of trap rock afford an excellent\r\nmaterial for broken stone roads where the severest conditions of\r\ntraffic are encountered. The trap rocks are tough and durable and\r\ngenerally possess excellent cementing properties.\r\n\r\nGranite and sandstone are seldom used for water-bound macadam as they\r\npossess poor cementing properties and a binder of some kind must be\r\nadded to cement the pieces together. For this purpose clay or the\r\nscreenings from some other variety of stone may be utilized.\r\n\r\nSome other materials are occasionally employed for the construction of\r\nmacadam surfaces. Of these, oyster or marine shells, burnt shale, and\r\nslag are most common.\r\n\r\nShells and slag are of rather low durability but possess good\r\ncementing properties. Shale is a makeshift suitable only for very\r\nlight traffic roads.\r\n\r\n=Sizes of Stone.=--The stone for the wearing course of a macadam road\r\nshould be as large as practicable, because the larger the pieces the\r\nmore durable the surface. If the individual stones are too large it is\r\ndifficult to secure a smooth surface, and large stones will be readily\r\nloosened by tipping as the wheels roll over them. These considerations\r\nlimit the size to a maximum of that which will pass a 2-1/2-inch\r\nscreen. Stone of excellent wearing qualities may be somewhat smaller,\r\nbut never less than that which will just pass a 1-1/2-inch screen.\r\n\r\nFor the lower course, the size is not particularly important except\r\nwhere the earth foundation is such as to require special construction.\r\nIt is not uncommon to use the same size of stone for both upper and\r\nlower course and yet in many instances stone up to that which will\r\njust pass a 3-1/2-inch screen is used for the lower course. Stone much\r\nsmaller in size may also be used successfully, but if the stone is\r\nbroken to a smaller size than is required, unnecessary expense is\r\nincurred.\r\n\r\nThe bonding material is the finer portion of the product of the\r\ncrusher, which is called screenings. This material may be so finely\r\ncrushed as to pass a one-fourth inch screen, or may be so coarse as to\r\njust pass a one-half inch screen, but in any case must contain all of\r\nthe dust and fine material produced by the crusher.\r\n\r\nWhere the soil and drainage conditions demand an especially stable\r\nfoundation course, the Telford type is used. The Telford foundation\r\nconsists of a layer of stones of various dimensions that can be laid\r\nso as to give a thickness of 8 inches. These large stones are placed\r\nby hand and therefore the size requirements are not rigid. Stones\r\nhaving one dimension about 8 inches and the others not over 10 or 12\r\ninches are satisfactory.\r\n\r\n=Earth Work.=--A thoroughly drained and stable earth foundation is\r\nessential to success with the macadam type of surface. Before placing\r\nthe stone, the road must be shaped to the proper cross section and\r\nall grade reduction work completed. Preferably heavy fills should have\r\na year to settle before the macadam surface is placed. Side ditches,\r\nnecessary culverts and tile drains should be constructed as required\r\nfor drainage. The earth work is often carried out in connection with\r\nthe construction of the macadam surface, being completed just ahead of\r\nthe surfacing. In that case, the fills must be carefully rolled as\r\nthey are placed. The road bed may be shaped in connection with the\r\nother earthwork. If the road has been brought to a satisfactory grade\r\nsome time prior to placing the macadam, the road bed for the broken\r\nstone will be prepared as needed for placing the stone.\r\n\r\n=Foundation for the Macadam.=--Macadam surfaces are quite generally\r\nplaced in a trench as described in the trench method for placing\r\ngravel. It is an almost universal practice to compact the layer of\r\nstone by rolling with an 8- or 10-ton power roller, and if the stone\r\nis not held between substantial earth berms or shoulders, the rolling\r\nmerely serves to spread the stone out over the road bed instead of\r\ncompacting it. If an attempt is made to roll broken stone which has\r\nbeen placed on a yielding foundation, no benefit results, but on the\r\ncontrary the stone is likely to be forced down into the soil. To\r\ninsure that the layer of broken stone can be compacted by rolling, it\r\nis first necessary to roll the earth foundation until it becomes hard\r\nand unyielding. If soft or yielding places appear during the rolling\r\nthese should be corrected by tile drains or by removing the earth from\r\nthe spongy place and back-filling with material that will compact when\r\nrolled.\r\n\r\nIt is not always easy to determine why these soft places exist in what\r\nappears to be a well drained roadway, especially since they are as\r\nlikely to be found on fills as anywhere else. Apparently they are due\r\nto local pockets of porous soil held by denser soil so that the water\r\ndoes not readily drain away. It is usually true that such places are\r\nobserved during the season of frequent precipitation more often than\r\nduring other seasons of the year.\r\n\r\nIn dry climates, the difficulties of securing suitable foundations for\r\nthe broken stone road are largely eliminated, but it may be observed\r\nthat this type of surface is not suitable for such climates unless\r\nsome sort of bituminous binder is employed to hold the stones in\r\nplace. The cementing power of the stone dust is inadequate when the\r\nsurface is continually dry.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 17.--Cross Section for Macadam]\r\n\r\n=Telford Foundation.=--When the Telford type of foundation is\r\nemployed, the earth subgrade is prepared and then the Telford stone\r\nplaced carefully by hand. The spaces between the large stones are\r\nfilled with the spalls broken from the larger stones in fitting them\r\nin place. When completed the base is rolled with a heavy roller to\r\nsecure a firm unyielding layer. The thickness is generally about eight\r\ninches. Any fairly sound stone may be used for the Telford base.\r\n\r\n=Placing the Broken Stone.=--It has been found impracticable properly\r\nto roll a greater thickness than about 5 or 6 inches of loose stone,\r\ntherefore, the stone for the macadam surface is usually placed in two\r\nlayers, the first or lower layer being rolled before the next layer is\r\nplaced. The stone is hauled in dump wagons, trucks or dump cars,\r\ndumped on the road bed and spread by hand rakes or by means of a blade\r\ngrader and is then rolled. To insure the proper thickness the loads\r\nare accurately spaced to spread to the proper thickness.\r\n\r\n=Rolling.=--A three-wheeled or \"macadam\" type of roller, of the\r\nself-propelled type, is best for compacting the broken stone road. The\r\nweight varies from eight to fifteen tons, but for most conditions the\r\nten or twelve ton size seems to be preferable. On Telford base\r\nconstruction, a heavier machine is desirable and for very hard stone\r\nit may be successfully employed.\r\n\r\nThe first trip with the roller is made along the edge of the stone and\r\neach successive trip is made a little nearer the middle until finally\r\none half of the strip of stone has been rolled. The roller is then\r\ntaken to the opposite side of the roadway and the operation repeated\r\non the other half. The rolling is continued until the stone is\r\nthoroughly compacted, which is evidenced by the fact that the roller\r\nmakes but a slight track in the surface.\r\n\r\nThe second layer of stone is then placed and rolled in the same manner\r\nas the first.\r\n\r\n=Spreading Screenings.=--After the upper course has been rolled, the\r\nscreenings are spread on it from piles alongside the road, enough\r\nbeing used to fill the voids in the layer of stone and furnish a\r\nslight excess. As the screenings are spread they are rolled to work\r\nthem into the voids. When these are filled, the surface is sprinkled\r\nthoroughly by means of an ordinary street sprinkling cart and again\r\nrolled. In this way the dust and water are mixed into a mortar which\r\nfills the crevices between the stones. This mortar hardens in a few\r\ndays, giving a bond that is weak, but sufficient for the purpose if\r\nthe traffic is not too heavy. A broken stone road finished in this way\r\nis called a water-bound macadam, and is ready for traffic in three or\r\nfour days after completion.\r\n\r\n=Bituminous Surfaces.=--On account of the inadequacy of the\r\nwater-bound macadam when subjected to motor traffic and to obviate the\r\ntendency of broken stone surfaces to loosen in dry weather, there has\r\nbeen developed a method of covering the surface with a bituminous\r\nmaterial such as tar or asphalt. This will be described in detail in a\r\nlater chapter.\r\n\r\n=Maintenance.=--Even under favorable conditions as regards kind and\r\namount of traffic the macadam road requires constant maintenance. The\r\nfirst effect of traffic will be to brush away the fine materials used\r\nfor bonding the surface, thus exposing the larger stones in such a way\r\nthat they are rather easily loosened and removed from the surface by\r\nwheels and the hoofs of animals. This finer material must be replaced\r\nas fast as it is removed so as to protect the surface. Either stone\r\ndust or clayey sand may be used, but clay if used alone is likely to\r\nbe sticky when wet and prove to be worse than the condition it was\r\nexpected to correct. In time, ruts and depressions will appear, either\r\nas the gradual effect of wear, which will inevitably effect some\r\nportions of the surface more than others, or on account of subsidence\r\nof the foundation. Uneven places are repaired by first loosening the\r\nstone, then restoring the cross section by adding new material and\r\ntamping or rolling it in place.\r\n\r\nIf a bituminous coating has been applied, it will eventually peel off\r\nin places and these places must be recoated as soon as practicable.\r\n\r\nEventually the surface will be worn to such an extent that an entirely\r\nnew wearing surface must be added. This is done by loosening the\r\nentire surface to a depth of 3 or 4 inches and then adding a new layer\r\nof broken stone. The loosening is sometimes accomplished by means of\r\nheavy spikes inserted in the roller wheels, and at others by means of\r\na special tool known as a scarifier.\r\n\r\nThe new surface is placed and rolled in precisely the same manner as\r\nthe wearing surface of the original construction, but the layer may\r\nnot be as thick as the original wearing course. A new course will not\r\nbond to the old surface unless the old macadam has been thoroughly\r\nbroken up first.\r\n\r\n=Characteristics.=--The water-bound macadam is a dusty, somewhat rough\r\nsurface of low durability for rubber tired vehicles. It has long been\r\nthe standard rural highway for steel tired vehicles, but cannot carry\r\nany considerable amount of motor traffic. It is easily repaired. When\r\nfinished with a bituminous surface its durability is greatly increased\r\nand the dust is eliminated. It does not seem to be sufficiently rigid\r\nfor truck traffic, unless placed on exceptionally good foundation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nCEMENT CONCRETE ROADS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe cement concrete road is one of the later developments in highway\r\nconstruction, but the type has had sufficient use to show that it is\r\none of the satisfactory types for heavy mixed traffic, and, where the\r\nproper materials are available, it is one of the economical types of\r\nconstruction.\r\n\r\n=Destructive Agencies.=--It is well to have clearly in mind at the\r\noutset that the concrete in a road surface is subjected to certain\r\ndestructive agencies not usually significant in connection with the\r\nuse of concrete, and these are so often disregarded that the average\r\nserviceability of the concrete road surface is sometimes much lower\r\nthan it would be if built with due regard for the effect of traffic on\r\nconcrete surfaces. In most structural uses of concrete, its strength\r\nin compression only is utilized, and the factor of safety is such as\r\nto eliminate to some extent failures due to inferior materials or\r\nworkmanship.\r\n\r\nThe concrete road surface is subjected to compression under wheel\r\nloads, to bending, causing tension in the concrete, to abrasion from\r\nwheels, and to tension and compression due to effect of temperature.\r\nThe weight of the wheel loads may cause sufficient distortion of the\r\nroad slab to produce rupture. The aggregates may be crushed under\r\nwheel loads if the material is too soft. Abrasion from steel tired\r\nvehicles wears away the concrete unless it is hard and durable.\r\nChanges in dimension due to the effect of change in temperature\r\nintroduce tension or compression into the road slab and may result in\r\ncracks. Freezing and thawing in the subgrade subjects the slab to\r\nvertical movement and discontinuous support with the result that\r\nlongitudinal and transverse cracks occur.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing indicates the importance of securing good concrete for\r\nroad surfacing, and that is accomplished by using suitable aggregates,\r\nby proper design of the road surface and by following established\r\nconstruction methods.\r\n\r\n=Design.=--The widths usually adopted for concrete roads are: for\r\nsingle track roads, 9 or 10 feet, and for double track roads, 18 or 20\r\nfeet. The thickness is 6 to 8 inches at the middle, varying with\r\nclimatic conditions and with the kind of soil upon which the concrete\r\nis laid. The thickness at the edge is 1 inch less than at the middle\r\nexcept that 6-inch surfaces are usually of uniform thickness, the\r\ntotal crown being 2 inches. The thickness of the two course pavement\r\nis the same as would be used for a single course pavement in the same\r\nlocation. The surface of either width has a total crown of one or two\r\ninches to insure water running off the surface. The earth foundation\r\nis often flat, the crown being obtained by making the slab thicker at\r\nthe middle than at the edge. Fig. 18 shows cross section for concrete\r\nroads.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 18.--Cross Section for Concrete Highway]\r\n\r\nIn the state of California, concrete roads four or five inches thick\r\nand surfaced with a bituminous carpet mat have been successfully\r\nconstructed. Similar designs have been used in a few other places, but\r\nfor general practice it is unsafe to depend upon such a thin slab.\r\nClimatic and soil conditions probably account for the success of the\r\nthin roads in California.\r\n\r\n=Concrete Materials.=--The coarse aggregate for the concrete may be\r\nbroken stone or pebbles screened from natural gravel. Durability is\r\nnecessary, but it is also important to have uniformity in the concrete\r\nso that the road surface will wear uniformly and consequently keep\r\nsmooth. Supplies of broken stone are likely to contain a small\r\npercentage of soft pieces and such of these as are at the surface when\r\nthe concrete is finished will crush under traffic, leaving a pit in\r\nthe surface. Pebbles screened from gravel are also likely to be\r\nvariable in durability and should be carefully inspected if they are\r\nto be used as aggregate for concrete roads. The harder limestones,\r\nsome sandstones, pebbles from many of the gravel deposits and\r\npractically all of the igneous rocks make satisfactory aggregates for\r\nthe concrete road.\r\n\r\nSometimes none of the coarse aggregates readily available are\r\nsufficiently durable or uniform for the wearing surface of the\r\nconcrete road, but a suitable aggregate may be obtained at relatively\r\nhigh price by shipping considerable distances. In such cases what is\r\nknown as the two course type of concrete road is employed. The wearing\r\ncourse usually is about 2 inches thick and is constructed with\r\nselected aggregates of good quality shipped in for the purpose. The\r\nlower course is constructed of aggregates which do not possess the\r\ndesired qualities for a wearing course, but which are satisfactory for\r\nconcrete not subjected to abrasion. The aggregates for the wearing\r\ncourse will be selected with the same regard for uniformity and\r\ndurability that would be the case if they were for the one course\r\npavement.\r\n\r\nBank run gravel, or run of the crusher stone, is generally not\r\nsufficiently uniform as regards proportion of fine and coarse material\r\nto produce uniformity in the concrete, and the use of aggregates of\r\nthat character is not permissible for the wearing course, but under\r\nproper inspection they may be used for the lower course of two course\r\npavements.\r\n\r\n=Fine Aggregate.=--The fine aggregate is generally natural sand, but a\r\nmixture of natural sand and stone screenings is sometimes employed.\r\nThe fine aggregate of whatever character must be clean, free from\r\norganic matter and sand, must contain no appreciable amount of mica,\r\nfeldspar, alkali, shale or similar deleterious substances and not\r\nexceed two and one-half per cent of clay and silt. The sand is of such\r\na range of sizes that all will pass the one-fourth-inch sieve and that\r\nnot exceeding about five per cent will pass the 100-mesh sieve.\r\n\r\n=Proportions.=--Various mixtures for the concrete are employed because\r\nthese may properly vary to some extent with the exact character and\r\ngrading of the aggregates. Experience seems to have shown that the\r\nconcrete used for the wearing surface should have a crushing strength\r\nof at least 2500 pounds per square inch, and the mixture adopted is\r\nbased on the requirements that will give the desired crushing\r\nstrength. The common mixture for the one course pavement is one part\r\ncement, two parts sand and three and one-half parts coarse aggregate.\r\nFor the wearing course of the two-course type of pavement, a mixture\r\nof the same kind is very often specified.\r\n\r\nWhile these are perhaps the most widely adopted proportions, many\r\nothers have been used, especially where the aggregates exhibit\r\npeculiarities or the traffic conditions are unusual. It is desired to\r\nemphasize that the purpose is to obtain concrete of the desired\r\nstrength and there can be no such thing as \"standard\" proportions.\r\n\r\n=Measuring Materials.=--In considering the methods employed for\r\nmeasuring aggregates, emphasis should be placed on the futility of\r\nrigid requirements for the aggregates, both as regards quality and\r\nrange of sizes, if the materials are carelessly proportioned at the\r\nmixer. If even reasonably near uniform wearing qualities are to be\r\nsecured throughout the entire area of the concrete road surface,\r\nsuccessive batches of concrete must be alike, and to insure that, the\r\naggregates including the water in each batch of concrete must be mixed\r\nin exactly the same proportions. The aggregates are measured in\r\nvarious ways, all essentially alike in that the intent is to insure\r\nexactly the same amount of each ingredient for each batch of concrete.\r\n\r\nOne method is to place bottomless boxes in wheelbarrows, fill the\r\nboxes level full and then lift off the box. Another is to use a\r\nwheelbarrow with a bed of such shape that the contents will be a\r\nmultiple of 1 cubic foot when level full. For the larger jobs, the\r\naggregates are hauled in industrial cars, each having sufficient\r\ncapacity for a batch of concrete. The car body is provided with a\r\npartition so as to separate the fine and coarse material.\r\n\r\nThe water is measured in a tank which automatically refills to the\r\nsame level each time it is emptied and when adjusted for a mixture\r\nwill introduce the proper amount of water for each batch. It is highly\r\nimportant to use the least amount of water that will produce workable\r\nconcrete.\r\n\r\n=Preparation of the Earth Foundation.=--The concrete road is generally\r\nplaced directly on the natural soil which has been brought to the\r\nproper cross section. Some engineers advocate that in preparing the\r\nsubgrade, the earth be thoroughly rolled; others prefer not to roll\r\nthe subgrade. If fills of considerable depth are constructed, they\r\nshould either be rolled as built or else should be allowed to settle\r\nfor some months before the concrete road is placed, preferably the\r\nlatter.\r\n\r\n=Placing the Concrete.=--The concrete is placed between substantial\r\nside forms of a height equal to the thickness of the concrete road\r\nslab at the edge, and is shaped roughly by means of shovels.\r\n\r\nVarious methods have been developed for striking the surface to the\r\nexact shape desired and smoothing it. If hand finishing methods are\r\nemployed, a plank template is cut to the prescribed cross section and\r\nthe concrete is shaped by drawing the template along the side forms.\r\nSometimes the template is used as a tamper, being moved along very\r\nslowly accompanied by an up and down motion that tends to tamp the\r\nconcrete. The template is then drawn along a second time to smooth the\r\nsurface finally.\r\n\r\nAfter the surface has been struck off by hand, it is finally smoothed,\r\nfirst by rolling crosswise with a slight hand roller about 8 inches in\r\ndiameter and 30 inches long. The final finish is effected by dragging\r\na piece of web belting back and forth across the surface.\r\n\r\nMachines designed to tamp the concrete and strike it off to the\r\nrequired cross section are also employed for finishing. The machine is\r\npower operated and is carried on wheels that run on the side forms,\r\nand the machine moves slowly along as the tamping progresses. The\r\nconcrete is tamped, struck off to shape and smoothed with the belt at\r\none operation. This method of finishing produces denser and stronger\r\nconcrete than can be produced by hand finishing methods.\r\n\r\n=Placing Concrete for Two-course Road.=--The methods employed for the\r\ntwo-course concrete road are much the same as for the one-course road.\r\nThe concrete for the lower course is placed and struck off by means of\r\nhand tools, and after that course has progressed a few feet, the upper\r\ncourse is placed and finished as has been described for the one-course\r\nroad.\r\n\r\n=Curing the Concrete.=--The setting action of cement is a chemical\r\nprocess, not merely a drying out of the water introduced in mixing the\r\nconcrete. The chemical action is progressive for a long time, but is\r\nmore rapid during the first few hours than during the later periods,\r\nand the concrete reaches about three-fourths of its maximum strength\r\nat the end of seven days. During the setting period and particularly\r\nduring the first few days, plenty of water must be available to the\r\ncement.\r\n\r\nTo prevent too rapid loss of water from the concrete during the\r\nsetting period, the surface must be protected from the wind and sun.\r\nThis is accomplished by first covering with canvas as soon as the\r\nconcrete has hardened sufficiently and by later covering with earth,\r\nto a depth of two inches. The earth covering is kept wet for about ten\r\ndays and is left in place for about one month.\r\n\r\nIn some places the ponding method of curing is adopted. The surface is\r\ndivided into sections by earthen dikes and the space inside the dikes\r\nfilled with water to a depth of two or three inches. The water\r\ncovering is maintained for two weeks or longer.\r\n\r\nNo traffic is permitted on the surface for one month, and in cold\r\nweather traffic may be kept off the surface for a longer period.\r\n\r\n=Expansion Joints.=--To permit the concrete slab to accommodate itself\r\nto changes in dimension due to temperature changes, expansion joints\r\n1/2 inch wide are placed about every thirty feet. These consist of a\r\nsheet of some prepared bituminous material placed in position as the\r\nconcrete is poured.\r\n\r\nExperience seems to indicate that in spite of the expansion joints,\r\nthe concrete will crack more or less and many engineers think it\r\nadvisable to omit expansion joints in constructing the pavement and\r\nwhen cracks develop to pour bituminous material into them, thus\r\nforming expansion joints.\r\n\r\nThe prevailing practice in rural highway construction is to omit the\r\nexpansion joints, but they are commonly adopted in city pavements.\r\n\r\n=Reinforcing.=--To minimize the cracking, either bar or wire mesh\r\nreinforcing is used in the concrete. If bars are used they are placed\r\nin the concrete as it is poured so as to form a belt around each\r\nsection about 15 feet square. If the mesh type is employed, a part of\r\nthe layer of concrete is placed and smoothed off and a strip of the\r\nmesh laid in place. Additional concrete is then poured on top of the\r\nmesh to bring the slab to the required thickness.\r\n\r\n=Bituminous Coatings on Concrete Surfaces.=--The concrete road surface\r\nis sometimes coated with a layer of bituminous material and stone\r\nchips or gravel pebbles. This is particularly advisable where no\r\nreally satisfactory aggregates are available and the concrete surface\r\nwould not possess sufficient durability. The bituminous material is\r\napplied hot to the surface and is then covered with stone chips or\r\ngravel pebbles, ranging in size from 3/4 inch down to 1/4 inch, the\r\nresulting coating being about 3/4 inch thick. Many failures of this\r\ntype of surface have been recorded due to the difficulty of securing\r\nadhesion to the concrete. This seems to be due in part to inability to\r\nget the proper bituminous materials and in part to climatic effects.\r\nConsiderable progress has been made in developing this type of surface\r\nand it may eventually become a satisfactory maintenance method.\r\n\r\n=Characteristics.=--The concrete road is of a granular texture and is\r\nnot slippery. It is of course rigid and noisy for steel tired\r\nvehicles. It is an excellent automobile road and its low tractive\r\nresistance makes it a desirable surface for horse drawn vehicles. It\r\npossesses a high degree of durability if properly constructed. It is\r\nlikely to crack indiscriminately but as a general rule the cracks are\r\nnot a serious defect.\r\n\r\n=Maintenance.=--The cracks that appear in the concrete surface are\r\nfilled once or twice a year, tar or asphalt being employed. The dust\r\nand detritus is cleaned out of the cracks and the hot filler poured\r\nin, with enough excess overflowing to protect the edges.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nVITRIFIED BRICK ROADS\r\n\r\n\r\nVitrified brick roads consist of a foundation course of Portland\r\ncement concrete, broken stone or slag macadam, or of brick laid flat,\r\nthe first named being by far the most generally used, and a wearing\r\ncourse of vitrified brick.\r\n\r\n=Vitrified Brick.=--Vitrified brick are made from clay of such a\r\ncharacter that when heated to the required temperature they will fuse\r\ninto a glassy texture. Brick roads are constructed on roads carrying\r\nthe severest of traffic and the brick must therefore be tough and of\r\nhigh resistance to wear.\r\n\r\nNot all of the clays from which brick may be manufactured will produce\r\na product suitable for road construction, and paving brick, even\r\nthough truly vitrified, are of different degrees of durability,\r\ndepending upon the nature of the clay and the care exercised in the\r\nmanufacture.\r\n\r\nPaving brick are manufactured by the stiff mud process, which means\r\nthat the clay is molded into form in a relatively dry condition. To\r\naccomplish this, considerable pressure is exerted in forcing the\r\ncolumn of clay through the dies, which form the prism from which the\r\nbrick are cut. If the clay is unsuitable in character or is not\r\nproperly ground and mixed, the brick will possess planes of weakness\r\nbetween the various layers of clay which have been pressed together,\r\nand these planes, called laminations, are a source of weakness if too\r\nmarked. It is usual to specify that the brick used for road surfaces\r\nshall be free from marked laminations.\r\n\r\nIf the brick is not properly burned it will be only partly vitrified\r\nand therefore not of maximum durability. It is customary to specify\r\nthat the brick shall show a glassy fracture indicating complete\r\nvitrification.\r\n\r\nVarious defects of a minor nature occasionally develop in the brick\r\nduring the successive steps in the manufacturing process. Check cracks\r\nresulting from the burning or from too rapid cooling are often\r\nencountered, but unless these are deep, that is 3/16 inch or more,\r\nthey do not impair the wearing quality of the brick, nor indicate\r\nstructural weakness. Kiln marks are formed on some of the brick due to\r\nthe weight of the brick above in the kiln. These depressions are not\r\nobjectionable unless the brick are so distorted that they will not lie\r\nevenly in the pavement.\r\n\r\nSpacing lugs or raised letters are formed on one face of the brick to\r\ninsure sufficient space between the brick for the filler. These lugs\r\nor letters are not less than 1/8 inch nor more than 1/4 inch high and\r\nof such design that they will not obstruct the free flow of filler\r\ninto the joints between the brick.\r\n\r\nSeveral varieties of paving brick are to be had, the difference being\r\nprincipally in the design or size.\r\n\r\n=Repressed Brick.=--In this type of brick the spacing lugs are formed\r\nby pressing the green brick, after it has been cut to size, into a\r\nmold on one face of which are recessed letters or other devices into\r\nwhich the clay is pressed, thus forming the spacing lugs.\r\n\r\n=Vertical Fiber Brick.=--These brick are designed to be laid with one\r\nwire-cut face up and spacing is provided by two or more beads on the\r\nside of the brick. Sometimes the vertical fiber brick has no spacing\r\nlug, it being contended that the irregularities of the brick are such\r\nas to provide all of the space required. In practice this does not\r\nalways work out, as the brick are so regular in shape that when laid\r\nthere is too little space between the brick to permit the introduction\r\nof a suitable filler. The use of brick without spacing lugs is just\r\nbeginning and is not yet a generally accepted practice.\r\n\r\n=Wire-cut-lug Brick.=--This is a type of non-repressed brick which has\r\nspacing lugs provided by cutting one face in a special manner which\r\nprovided lugs for spacing. In this type the wire cut face is the one\r\nbetween the brick as they are laid in the pavement.\r\n\r\n=Tests for Quality.=--The standard test for quality of paving brick is\r\nthe rattler test. The brick rattler consists of a barrel of 14 sides\r\n24 inches long, mounted so as to rotate at a speed between 29.5 and\r\n30.5 revolutions per minute. The duration of a test is 1800\r\nrevolutions. Ten brick constitute a charge and these are placed in the\r\nrattler along with 300 lbs. of cast iron spheres. The spheres are of\r\ntwo sizes, the smaller being 1-7/8 inch in diameter when new, and the\r\nlarger 3-3/4 inches in diameter when new. Ten of the larger spheres\r\nare used and the balance of the charge is made up of the small size.\r\n\r\nWhen tested in the standard manner the loss allowable for the several\r\nclasses of service are as follows:\r\n\r\n  ------------+---------------+----------------\r\n              |               |   Maximum Loss\r\n    Traffic   |  Average Loss |   for any Brick\r\n  ------------+---------------+----------------\r\n    Heavy     |   20 per cent |    24 per cent\r\n    Medium    |   22 per cent |    26 per cent\r\n    Light     |   25 per cent |    28 per cent\r\n  ------------+---------------+----------------\r\n\r\n=Other Tests.=--Sometimes the absorption test is specified for paving\r\nbrick, but it is rarely a vitrified brick that will pass the rattler\r\ntests which fails to pass a reasonable absorption test. Absorption of\r\nwater in an amount exceeding 4 per cent indicates incomplete\r\nvitrification and failure of such brick is almost certain during the\r\nrattler tests.\r\n\r\nThe cross breaking test is also sometimes employed, but generally\r\nonly to check the general quality of the brick. Failure in service\r\nmore frequently occurs from excessive wear than from any other cause\r\nand the cross breaking test has little significance, except for brick\r\nless than 3 inches thick, which are to be laid on a sand bedding\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\n=Foundation.=--The foundation for brick roads is usually of Portland\r\ncement concrete, the thickness varying with the nature of the traffic\r\nand the kind of soil upon which the pavement is built. For well\r\ndrained soils and normal highway traffic, 5 inches is the ordinary\r\nthickness of foundation. Under favorable conditions such as locations\r\nwith sandy soils or in semi-arid or arid regions where the soil is\r\nalways stable, the foundation may be four inches thick, and a\r\nconsiderable mileage of brick road has been built with concrete\r\nfoundations less than four inches thick.\r\n\r\nIn other locations the soil and traffic conditions require a base six\r\ninches or more in thickness, and the proper thickness can be\r\ndetermined only after all of the factors involved are known and have\r\nbeen analyzed. It is impractical to adopt a standard thickness of\r\nfoundation that will be equally economical for all locations and all\r\nkinds of traffic. As the brick pavement is essentially a heavy traffic\r\ntype of surface, the design cannot be varied greatly with similar\r\nfoundation conditions because the weight of individual loads is the\r\nsignificant factor and this does not vary so much as the volume of\r\ntraffic. A variation in volume of traffic may be compensated for by a\r\nvariation in the quality of the brick as already set forth.\r\n\r\nThe mixtures for the concrete foundation vary widely because of the\r\nvariation in the aggregates employed. If the fine and coarse aggregate\r\nfor the concrete are of good quality a mixture of one part cement, two\r\nand one-half parts sand and five parts of coarse aggregate would\r\ninsure concrete of adequate strength. A somewhat leaner mixture is\r\nsometimes employed and would be satisfactory if the aggregates were of\r\nexceptional concrete making quality. Mixtures of sand and pebbles\r\n(unscreened gravel) may also be used if care is exercised to secure a\r\nmixture of adequate strength. The proportion will of necessity vary\r\nwith each particular material and the discussion of the various\r\nconsiderations involved may be obtained from various standard works on\r\nconcrete and concrete materials.\r\n\r\nBroken stone macadam is sometimes utilized for the foundation course\r\nof the brick pavement and such foundations are constructed as\r\nwater-bound, which is described in a previous chapter. The thickness,\r\nlike that of the concrete foundation, varies with the soil conditions\r\nand the weight of the loads that are expected to use the road. The\r\nmacadam is placed in a single layer and is rolled and bonded with\r\nscreenings as described in the chapter dealing with water-bound\r\nmacadam. Six inches is a common thickness for the macadam base. This\r\ntype of foundation should be employed only where the soil is quite\r\nstable and where material costs are such as to insure that the macadam\r\nbase is materially cheaper than one of concrete. This would usually be\r\nin locations where the cost of cement is high because of long hauls\r\nand where suitable macadam materials may be obtained close at hand.\r\n\r\nOld macadam roads are sometimes utilized for the foundation for the\r\nbrick surface, but the instances where this is permissible are\r\ncomparatively few in number. When an old macadam is to be used it is\r\nreshaped to the proper cross section and re-rolled and bonded so as to\r\nafford a stable foundation of the proper cross slope.\r\n\r\n\r\nBEDDING COURSE FOR BRICK SURFACES\r\n\r\nIn order to equalize the variations in size and shape of the brick,\r\nthey are laid on a bedding course composed of material into which the\r\nbrick may be forced by rolling. In this way the upper surfaces of all\r\nbrick can be brought to the proper elevation to insure smoothness and\r\neasy riding qualities. Several kinds of bedding course are now\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\n=Sand Bedding Course.=--The sand bedding course has been referred to\r\nas a sand cushion, but as a matter of experience the cushion effect is\r\nslight, although sometimes pavements have become uneven because the\r\nbrick have pushed down into the sand after the pavement was used for a\r\ntime. The sand for the bedding course should preferably be fine\r\ngrained, all particles passing the eight mesh sieve, but ordinary\r\nconcrete sand is satisfactory. The sand need not be clean, as a\r\ncomparatively large percentage of silt or clay does not impair the\r\nusefulness of the material.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 19.--Cross Sections for Brick Highways]\r\n\r\n=Sand Mortar Bedding Course.=--In order to eliminate the tendency for\r\nthe straight sand bedding course to shift because of the impact of\r\ntraffic on the brick, a lean cement mortar is sometimes employed\r\nrather than the straight sand. Sand and cement in the ratio of one\r\npart cement to four or five parts of sand are mixed dry, and after the\r\nbrick have been rolled, is moistened to furnish water to hydrate the\r\ncement. The sand employed is ordinary clean concrete sand.\r\n\r\n=Green Concrete Bedding Course.=--In the monolithic type of brick\r\nroad construction, the brick are laid directly on the green concrete\r\nbase before the concrete has taken a set and the irregularities of the\r\nbrick are taken up by rolling them until bedded in concrete.\r\n\r\n\r\nFILLERS FOR BRICK SURFACES\r\n\r\nThe spaces between the brick are filled with some material that will\r\nprevent the brick from being displaced and prevent water getting to\r\nthe bedding course. A suitable filler must adhere to the brick and\r\nfill completely the spaces between them. It must withstand traffic so\r\nas to remain intact in the joints and when in place it must be rigid\r\nenough to prevent displacement of the brick.\r\n\r\n=Cement Grout Filler.=--One of the most commonly used fillers for\r\nbrick pavements consists of a grout composed of Portland cement and\r\nfine sand. When properly mixed and applied the grout filler meets all\r\nrequirements for a filler except that it is non-elastic and some means\r\nmust be adopted for caring for pavement expansion.\r\n\r\n=Bituminous Fillers.=--Asphaltic materials and tars are widely used as\r\nfillers for brick pavements. Such fillers are of high melting point\r\nand consequently solid at ordinary temperature. They are poured into\r\nthe joints hot and when they cool are firm enough to comply with the\r\nrequirements for a filler. In addition, they have enough ductility to\r\naccommodate the expansion of the pavement due to temperature changes.\r\n\r\n=Mastic Fillers.=--Mastic consists of a mixture of about equal volumes\r\nof fine sand and a solid bituminous material. The mixture is prepared\r\nat high temperature and is worked into the joints between the brick\r\nwhile hot. When cool it resembles the straight bituminous filler\r\nexcept that the mastic is somewhat more resistant to wear than the\r\nstraight bituminous filler.\r\n\r\nEXPANSION JOINTS\r\n\r\nIt is recognized that brick will expand and contract with changes in\r\ntemperature. When a bituminous or mastic filler is employed there is\r\nsufficient yield to the filler to accommodate the change in dimension\r\nin the brick, but when the grout filler is used either the expansion\r\njoint must be provided or the pavement must be designed to withstand\r\nthe compression due to expansion of the brick. Expansion joints may\r\nconsist of a sheet of bituminous mastic prepared for the purpose and\r\nset in place in the pavement. The sheet of joint material is simply\r\ninserted between courses of brick at the proper place.\r\n\r\nAnother method of forming an expansion joint consists in placing a\r\nstrip of wood between courses of brick at the place where a joint is\r\nrequired. After the pavement has been grouted, the wooden strip is\r\npulled out and the joint is filled with a suitable bituminous filler.\r\n\r\n=Marginal Curb.=--If the sand bedding course is employed, it is\r\nnecessary to provide curbing along the sides of the brick to hold the\r\nbedding course in place. The curb is usually constructed integral with\r\nthe base and of concrete of the same mixture as the base. The width of\r\nthe curb is usually six inches and the top of the curb is at the same\r\nelevation as the edge of brick surface.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONSTRUCTION OF THE SURFACE\r\n\r\nBefore the construction of a brick surface should be undertaken on a\r\nroad, the drainage should be provided for even more completely than\r\nfor a less costly type of surface since it does not pay to jeopardize\r\nthe stability of the pavement by failure to provide adequately for the\r\nstability of the supporting soil. Grades should also be reduced to the\r\neconomical limit.\r\n\r\nThe earth subgrade is brought to the proper elevation and cross\r\nsection and is thoroughly rolled. If there are places where the soil\r\nwill not compact properly under rolling, these places are corrected by\r\ntaking out the material and back filling with new material that will\r\nproperly compact under the roller.\r\n\r\nThe aggregates for the concrete may be distributed along on the\r\nprepared subgrade or may be stored in stock piles or bins at\r\nconvenient points. If stored on the subgrade, a traction mixer is\r\nemployed which is drawn along the road as the work progresses, the\r\nmaterials being placed directly in the mixer. If stored at a central\r\npoint, they may be transported to the mixer on the road and dumped\r\ndirectly into the mixer, or the mixer may be set up at the storage\r\npiles and the concrete hauled in trucks to the road where it is\r\ndeposited and shaped.\r\n\r\nThe concrete is spread to the proper thickness and tamped either by\r\nhand or by machinery. If the marginal curb is to be employed, it is\r\nconstructed immediately after the concrete for the base has been\r\nfinished but before the cement begins to set.\r\n\r\nAfter the foundation concrete has set, the bedding course is spread\r\nand struck off to the proper thickness. When the bedding course\r\nconsists of sand-cement mortar, the sand and cement are mixed dry and\r\nspread to prescribed thickness. It is considered to be desirable to\r\nroll the sand bedding course with a light hand roller before the brick\r\nare placed, but the sand-cement bedding course is not rolled. The\r\nbedding course must be carefully shaped by means of a templet or\r\nstrike board before the brick are placed.\r\n\r\nThe brick are laid in straight courses across the pavement, with the\r\nspacing lugs all in the same direction if brick with spacing lugs are\r\nemployed, and with the lugs in contact with the brick of adjoining\r\ncourses. If brick without spacing lugs are used they are laid loosely\r\nso that there will be room for the filler between the brick of\r\nadjoining courses.\r\n\r\nAfter the brick have been laid they are rolled to bed them in the sand\r\nor sand-mortar bedding course and thus secure a smooth surface. For\r\nthis purpose a light, power driven, tandem roller is used and the\r\nrolling is continued until the brick are thoroughly bedded. Any\r\ndefective brick that are noted are removed and replaced with good\r\nbrick and after this culling has been completed the surface is once\r\nmore thoroughly rolled. If a cement-sand bedding course is employed,\r\nthe surface is sprinkled just after the final rolling so that water\r\nwill flow down between the brick and moisten the bedding course\r\nsufficiently to cause the cement to set. In some cases, the\r\nsand-cement bedding course is sprinkled just before the brick are laid\r\nbut in warm weather the setting would take place before the brick\r\ncould be rolled if that were done. In cool weather the setting is\r\nsufficiently slow to permit rolling before the bedding course hardens.\r\n\r\nThe filler is applied to the surface after the rolling. If the\r\nbituminous type of filler is employed, the hot filler is poured onto\r\nthe surface and worked into the joints by means of squeegees, with\r\ncomparatively little material left on the surface. In some instances\r\ncone-shaped pouring pots are employed and the material is poured\r\ndirectly into the joints.\r\n\r\nThe cement grout filler is applied in the same general manner as the\r\nbituminous filler. The grout, consisting of equal parts of sand and\r\ncement, is mixed to a thin consistency and poured onto the surface and\r\nis then worked into the joints with squeegees. Two or more\r\napplications are usually required to effect a complete filling of the\r\njoints. The surface should be covered with sand and be kept moist\r\nuntil the cement grout has set.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nBITUMINOUS ROAD MATERIALS AND THEIR USE\r\n\r\n\r\nTars and asphaltic materials of various kinds are widely used for road\r\nconstruction and maintenance, especially for road surfaces subjected\r\nto motor traffic. Materials of this character that are employed in\r\nhighway work possess varying degrees of adhesiveness, and while they\r\nmay be semi-solid or viscous liquids at air temperature, they melt on\r\nthe application of heat and can be made sufficiently fluid to mix with\r\nthe mineral aggregates that may be used in the road surface. Upon\r\ncooling, the bituminous materials return to the previous state and\r\nimpart a certain amount of plasticity to the mixture, at the same time\r\nserving as a binding or cementing agent, which is sufficiently stable\r\nfor many classes of road construction.\r\n\r\n=Classes of Bituminous Materials.=--Bituminous materials may be\r\nclassified, according to the source from which they are obtained, as\r\ncoal tars, water gas tars, native or natural asphalts and oil or\r\npetroleum asphalts.\r\n\r\n=Coal Tar.=--Coal tar is obtained as a by-product in the manufacture\r\nof illuminating gas from coal. It is also obtained in the manufacture\r\nof coke from coal. The tar thus obtained is manufactured into products\r\nthat are used for dust layers on gravel or macadam roads, binders for\r\nmacadam and gravel surfaces, fillers for brick, wood block and stone\r\nblock pavements and for expansion joints. These various materials\r\ndiffer mainly in their consistency at air temperature. (They may\r\ndiffer widely in chemical composition, but that need not be considered\r\nherein.)\r\n\r\n=Water Gas Tar.=--Water gas tar is obtained as a by-product in the\r\nmanufacture of illuminating gas from crude petroleum. It is used for\r\nthe same kinds of construction as coal tar, and the products utilized\r\nfor the several purposes, like the coal tars, differ mainly in\r\nconsistency.\r\n\r\n=Natural Asphalt.=--Natural asphalt is found in deposits at many\r\nplaces in the world, existing in beds or pools where it has exuded\r\nfrom the earth or as veins in cavities in the rocks. It is of varying\r\ncomposition and consistency, but those kinds in most general use are\r\nsolid or very viscous liquids at air temperature. Of the deposits that\r\nhave been developed on a commercial scale, the Trinidad lake in the\r\nBritish West Indies and Bermudez deposit in Venezuela are best known.\r\nBoth of these materials are too hard in the natural state to be used\r\nfor road construction, and are softened, or fluxed as it is called,\r\nwith fluid petroleum oil before being used.\r\n\r\n=Petroleum Asphalt.=--Petroleum asphalt is a residue remaining after\r\nthe fluid products have been distilled from petroleum. Residues of\r\nthis sort are not always suitable for road construction, but a number\r\nof brands of road material are obtained from this source. Oil asphalts\r\nare used for dust layers, for binders for macadam roads, for asphalt\r\ncements for sheet pavement surfaces, and for fillers for block\r\npavements and expansion joints.\r\n\r\n=Mixtures.=--Water gas tars and asphalts are sometimes mixed to\r\nproduce road materials, and likewise native asphalts and residues\r\nobtained from petroleum are sometimes mixed to produce asphalt cements\r\nfor paving mixtures.\r\n\r\n=Classification according to Consistency.=--The various bituminous\r\nmaterials may be classified according to consistency in discussing the\r\nvarious uses to which they may be put.\r\n\r\n=Road Oils.=--Road oils are fluid petroleum oils of such consistency\r\nthat they may be applied cold or by heating slightly. They are used\r\nas dust layers on earth, gravel and macadam surfaces. Their efficacy\r\ndepends upon the binding properties of the small amount of asphaltic\r\nmaterial that is contained in the oil.\r\n\r\n=Liquid Asphalts.=--These are somewhat less fluid than the road oils,\r\nand must always be heated before application, but are viscous liquids\r\nat ordinary temperature. These materials are obtained from crude\r\npetroleum or semi-solid native bitumens, in which case they are\r\nusually called malthas. Both coal tars and water gas tars of\r\nsemi-solid consistency are also employed for the same class of\r\nconstruction as the liquid asphalts.\r\n\r\nThese materials are used for carpeting mediums on macadam roads and as\r\ncementing agents in the construction of hot-mixed macadam.\r\n\r\n=Asphalt Cements.=--The solid asphaltic materials used for hot-mixed\r\ntypes of construction are called asphalt cements. They may be\r\npetroleum residues or native asphalts fluxed with petroleum oils. They\r\nare solids at ordinary temperature and must be heated to a temperature\r\nin excess of two hundred and fifty degrees before they are\r\nsufficiently fluid to use. Asphalt cements are used for sheet asphalt\r\nand asphaltic concrete construction and for hot-mixed bituminous\r\nmacadam.\r\n\r\n=Fillers.=--Fillers are solid asphalts or tars that are used for\r\nfilling expansion joints in rigid pavements and for filling the spaces\r\nbetween the blocks in brick, wood block and stone block pavements.\r\n\r\n=Bitumen.=--Bituminous materials are all soluble to a greater or\r\nlesser extent in carbon disulphide and the soluble portion is called\r\nbitumen. It is the bitumen that gives to the materials the cementing\r\nproperties utilized in road construction. Mixtures of mineral\r\naggregates and bituminous materials for various purposes are\r\nproportioned with bitumen as a basis. Therefore, less of an asphalt\r\ncontaining one hundred per cent bitumen will be used than of one\r\ncontaining less than one hundred per cent of bitumen.\r\n\r\n  TABLE 8\r\n\r\n  PROPERTIES OF ASPHALTIC ROAD MATERIALS\r\n\r\n  (A) Material\r\n  (B) Specific Gravity\r\n  (C) Consistency\r\n  (D) Solubility in CS_2, Per Cent\r\n  (E) Solubility of Bitumen in CCl_4, Per Cent\r\n  (F) Solubility of Bitumen in 86° Naphtha, Per Cent\r\n  (G) Fixed Carbon, Per Cent\r\n  (H) Flash Point\r\n  (I) Ductility\r\n  -------------------------+---------+----------+----------+------------\r\n           (A)             |   (B)   |    (C)   |   (D)    |    (E)\r\n  -------------------------+---------+----------+----------+------------\r\n  Mexican oil asphalts     |1.03-1.05|As desired| 99.5-99.9|99.5-99.9\r\n  California oil asphalts  |1.02-1.04|As desired|   99.9   |    99.9\r\n  Texas oil asphalts       |1.01-1.03|As desired|   99.9   |    99.9\r\n  Bermudez  natural asphalt|1.07     |    25    |    95    |     99+\r\n  Trinidad natural asphalt |1.40     |     7    |  56-57   |     100\r\n  Bermudez asphalt cement  |1.04-1.06|Up to 135 |  95-97   |99.5 or more\r\n  -------------------------+---------+----------+----------+------------\r\n\r\n  -------------------------+---------+----------+----------+------------\r\n           (A)             |   (F)   |   (G)    |   (H)    |     (I)\r\n  -------------------------+---------+----------+----------+------------\r\n  Mexican oil asphalts     |  70-80  |   13-16  | 200°C. up|   60-100\r\n  California oil asphalts  |  75-80  |   10-12  | 200°C. up|   100+\r\n  Texas oil asphalts       |  75-80  |   12-14  | 200°C. up|   50-100\r\n  Bermudez  natural asphalt|  68-70  |   13-14  |    ...   |    ...\r\n  Trinidad natural asphalt |  64-65  |   10-11  |    ...   |    ...\r\n  Bermudez asphalt cement  |  77-80  |   11-12  |  175-200 |   25-50\r\n  -------------------------+---------+----------+----------+------------\r\n\r\n=Specifications.=--Some properties of bituminous materials can be\r\nvaried in the process of manufacture, while others are inherent in the\r\nmaterial and cannot be changed in the process of manufacture.\r\nSpecifications must therefore be drawn with care to insure that the\r\nrequirements can be met by satisfactory materials. But certain\r\nproperties, such as specific gravity, may vary greatly among materials\r\nequally satisfactory for construction purposes. One should not be\r\nmisled by apparent differences in the characteristics of materials,\r\nbecause these may simply be natural peculiarities which have no\r\nbearing on the usefulness of the material. There are given in Table 8\r\nthe properties of some of the commonly used bituminous materials and\r\nthe properties that can be varied in the process of manufacture are\r\nindicated with an asterisk. A variation in these properties will\r\nusually result in some change of other properties, but generally not a\r\ngreat change.\r\n\r\n\r\nSURFACES IN WHICH BITUMINOUS MATERIALS ARE UTILIZED\r\n\r\nI. Surface Treatments\r\n\r\nAttention has been directed to the rapid deterioration of water-bound\r\nmacadam when subjected to passenger automobile traffic.\r\n\r\nIn water-bound macadam the stones are held in place by a weak cement\r\ncomposed of stone dust and water, and this cement is not sufficiently\r\nstrong to hold the stones in place when they are subjected to the\r\nshear of automobile tires. In finishing the water-bound macadam\r\nsurface, the spaces between the stones are filled with screening and\r\nin addition a layer about one-fourth inch thick is left on the\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nThe automobile traffic first brushes aside all of the screenings and\r\nsmaller particles of rock, exposing the larger stones. These gradually\r\nloosen as the road is used and are brushed aside. When this effect\r\nbegins, the road is said to be raveling. Various lengths of time may\r\nelapse from the time the road is first finished until raveling begins,\r\ndepending upon the character of the stone, the weather and the amount\r\nof motor traffic. During the period before raveling starts, it is\r\ncomparatively easy to restore the road surface at any time by the\r\naddition of screenings or clay and sand. Usually there will be a few\r\nsmall areas of the surface that, on account of faulty construction,\r\nwill ravel or become rutted much earlier than the remainder of the\r\nsurface. These can be repaired by the methods described in the chapter\r\non \"Water-bound Macadam Construction.\" When the surface begins to\r\nravel seriously, maintenance becomes much more difficult and in order\r\nto prevent raveling and the difficulties of maintenance thereafter,\r\nthe macadam surface is often coated with a bituminous material.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 20.--Oiling a Gravel Road]\r\n\r\nIf there is any dust or screenings on the road surface, the bituminous\r\nmaterial will not adhere to the stones and will soon flake off under\r\ntraffic. The surface of the macadam must therefore be thoroughly\r\ncleaned before the bituminous material is applied. The usual practice\r\nis to finish the road as water-bound macadam, and permit traffic on it\r\nfor a sufficient length of time to show any weak places in the surface\r\nand at the same time thoroughly to season the surface. If any\r\ndefective places appear, they are repaired and when the surface\r\nexhibits satisfactory stability, but before it begins to ravel, the\r\nbituminous surface is applied. There will ordinarily be some stone\r\ndust and some screenings remaining on the surface at the time\r\nbituminous treatment is undertaken, and there may also be some caked\r\nmud or other foreign material. All of this must be removed so as to\r\nexpose the stones throughout.\r\n\r\n=Applying the Bituminous Binder.=--The bituminous binder may be\r\ndelivered in tank cars, which is desirable if the work is near a\r\nrailroad siding, or ample tank wagon service is available for long\r\nhauls so that the tank will not be held up too long. Often it is\r\ndesirable to purchase the binder in barrels and haul these to the site\r\nof the work in advance of beginning the construction of the surface.\r\n\r\nThe bituminous material may be applied by means of hand spreading cans\r\nnot unlike an ordinary garden watering pot, except that a slotted\r\nnozzle is substituted for the ordinary perforated one. If hand methods\r\nare employed for spreading, the bituminous material is heated in open\r\nkettles and then spread on the surface, the quantity required usually\r\nbeing about one-half gallon per square yard of surface. The\r\ntemperature of the binder should be great enough to insure fluidity\r\nand the road should be dry at the time of the application. As soon as\r\nthe material has been spread, the surface is finished with a dressing\r\nof chips.\r\n\r\n=Finishing the Surface.=--For surface dressing the best material is\r\nstone chips ranging in size from about 1 inch down to one-fourth inch.\r\nBut the chips must be of durable material, or they will quickly grind\r\ninto dust. They must be free from dust when applied, as the presence\r\nof any considerable amount of dust interferes with the proper\r\nfinishing of the surface. The stone chips are rolled into the surface,\r\na sufficient quantity being used to just cover the surface.\r\n\r\n=Patching.=--It almost always happens that some small areas will not\r\nbe properly cleaned or that for some unknown reason the coating peels\r\noff the surface. Such places must be promptly patched to prevent them\r\nenlarging under the action of traffic. This work is usually done by\r\npatrolmen, who inspect the road at frequent intervals and make the\r\nnecessary repairs. The patrolman is equipped with a small heating\r\nkettle, a spreading can and the necessary brushes, tampers and\r\nmiscellaneous tools needed for the repair work. The place to be\r\npatched is carefully cleaned, coated with bituminous binder and stone\r\nchips and tamped until dense and solid. Repairs made in this way are\r\nexceedingly important in that they arrest deterioration in its early\r\nstages and maintain a high degree of serviceability.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. Penetration Macadam\r\n\r\nA considerable mileage of macadam has been constructed in which an\r\nattempt was made to eliminate the difficulties of maintenance by a\r\nmethod of construction that involves applying a bituminous binder in\r\nsuch a manner as to permit it to penetrate two inches or more into the\r\nsurface. It is expected that the binder will coat the stones to such\r\nan extent as to increase materially the stability of the bituminous\r\nmacadam over the surface treated one. It is also expected that less\r\ndifficulty will be encountered in maintaining a surface of bituminous\r\nmaterial and stone chips on this type of road than on the water-bound\r\nmacadam. The extent to which these expectations have been realized has\r\nvaried to a marked degree and although some excellent surfaces have\r\nbeen constructed by this method, the results have as a rule been\r\nneither uniform nor entirely satisfactory. It seems to be apparent\r\nthat good results cannot be obtained unless the materials are entirely\r\nsuitable and the construction is carried out with unusual skill.\r\n\r\n=Foundation.=--The foundation or lower course consists of a layer of\r\nbroken stone six inches thick placed on a well drained and thoroughly\r\nrolled earth subgrade. In exceptional cases, the Telford type of\r\nfoundation might be employed.\r\n\r\nThe lower course of broken stone is finished in the same manner as\r\nwater-bound macadam, being bonded with stone screenings or with fine\r\ngravel of high clay content.\r\n\r\nSince this course is in reality the foundation of the surface, it is\r\nnecessary to secure stability by appropriate construction methods,\r\nexactly as in constructing water-bound macadam.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 21.--Type of Roller used on Gravel and Macadam\r\nRoads]\r\n\r\n=Upper or Wearing Course.=--The wearing course consists of a layer of\r\nstone about two and one-half inches thick. The stone is placed and\r\nrolled and the spaces between the stones partially filled with some\r\nsuitable bituminous material. The bituminous material is usually\r\napplied by means of a mechanical spreading device connected to a tank\r\nwagon. The bituminous materials employed for this class of\r\nconstruction are semi-solid in character and must be heated to give\r\nthem sufficient fluidity for application. They may be heated in the\r\ntank wagon which is used for the application or they may be heated in\r\nseparate tanks and transferred to the distributing wagon for\r\nspreading. Some kind of a nozzle or group of nozzles is employed for\r\nspreading the material so that it can be delivered in the form of a\r\nspray or at least in a thin fan-shaped stream and can be distributed\r\nin a fairly uniform layer over the stone. The binder will cool rather\r\nrapidly after it is applied, but meanwhile will flow into the openings\r\nbetween the stones and will form over the surface stones a coating of\r\nslight thickness.\r\n\r\nThe surface of the macadam is next covered with a layer of chips of\r\ntough rock, similar to the material used for the final dressing in\r\nsurface treatments. These are carefully brushed into the openings\r\nbetween the larger stones by means of heavy brush brooms. This is an\r\nexceedingly important part of the work and often a much neglected part\r\nof the construction.\r\n\r\nThe surface is then covered with a second application of bituminous\r\nmaterial, somewhat less in quantity than required for the first\r\ntreatment and the surface again covered with stone chips and brushed.\r\n\r\nThe surface is then thoroughly rolled and is ready for traffic.\r\n\r\n=Patching.=--As in the case of surface treatments, there are likely to\r\nbe places that, on account of defects in the construction, will fail\r\nsoon after the road is placed under traffic. These will quickly\r\nenlarge unless they are repaired promptly. The repairs are made by\r\nloosening the stone in the area affected and adding new stone as\r\nneeded and then pouring on the necessary amount of bituminous material\r\nto coat the stones. Allowance must be made for the compression of the\r\nmaterial by tamping so that a depression does not result. The stones\r\nare carefully tamped to place and covered with chips which are also\r\ntamped.\r\n\r\n=Characteristics.=--The penetration macadam is a surface well adapted\r\nto motor traffic if the individual vehicles are not too heavy. It is\r\nlikely to squeeze out of shape under motor truck traffic, becoming\r\nseriously uneven and uncomfortable for traffic. Its durability is\r\nmaterially affected by the construction methods followed.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. Hot Mixed Macadam\r\n\r\nThe wearing course of the mixed macadam is composed of graded broken\r\nstone or gravel and a bituminous binder. Usually the bituminous\r\nmaterial only is heated prior to the mixing, but sometimes the stone\r\nis also heated.\r\n\r\n=Foundation.=--The lower course, which serves as the foundation, is\r\neither broken stone macadam, gravel or concrete.\r\n\r\nWhere a foundation of broken stone is used, it is constructed of the\r\nmaterials and in the manner described for the foundation of the\r\npenetration macadam. Quite often a badly worn macadam or gravel road\r\nis used for the foundation and a new wearing course provided by adding\r\na mixed macadam surface. If such is the case, the old surface is\r\nworked over so as to restore the shape sufficiently and to insure that\r\nit is everywhere of sufficient thickness.\r\n\r\nPortland cement concrete is sometimes used as a foundation for the\r\nmixed macadam, but not often. Usually if the traffic is of a character\r\nrequiring a concrete foundation, it is desirable to use a better\r\nwearing course than the mixed macadam, and the asphaltic concrete or\r\nsheet asphalt type of surface is employed. It is necessary to finish\r\nthe surface of the concrete base with some device that will leave the\r\nsurface rough to prevent the macadam from creeping. A knobbed tamper\r\nwhich leaves numerous irregular depressions about 2 inches in diameter\r\nand three-fourths inch deep is often employed.\r\n\r\n=Sizes of Stone.=--For the wearing surface, stone ranging in size from\r\n2 inches down to one-fourth inch is usually employed. If the stone is\r\nof good quality the maximum size may be but 1-1/2 inches, but soft or\r\neven medium stone of that size are likely to crush under traffic. The\r\nstone for the base course should preferably be from 3 inches down, but\r\nany available size will be satisfactory if the layer is well rolled\r\nand bonded. The base course is constructed in the same manner as\r\nwater-bound macadam and any material satisfactory for the base course\r\nof macadam will serve for the base course of mixed macadam. Screenings\r\nhaving good bonding properties will also be required for the base\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\n=Mixing and Wearing Surface.=--Several methods are employed in mixing\r\nthe wearing surface. The simplest is to mix by hand with shovels. The\r\naggregates are heated in improvised heaters which may consist of\r\nnothing more than a metal pipe two or three feet in diameter, around\r\nwhich the stone is piled. The mixing platform is usually a metal plate\r\nsometimes arranged so that it can be heated by means of a fire\r\nunderneath. The bituminous material is heated in kettles. For some\r\nmixtures, the stone is not heated, but the bituminous material is\r\nalways heated. The batch of stone is placed on the mixing platform,\r\nthe bituminous material added and the materials mixed by hand.\r\n\r\nMachine mixing is practiced much more extensively than hand mixing,\r\nbeing both more rapid and cheaper. The mixer is similar to a concrete\r\nmixer except that the drum is arranged so that it can be heated. The\r\nhot stone and the bituminous binder are put into the drum and mixed\r\nfor the requisite length of time. Sometimes the stone is mixed cold,\r\nthe bituminous material only being heated.\r\n\r\n=Placing the Wearing Surface.=--The hot mixture is carted to the road\r\nand spread to such thickness that after rolling the wearing surface\r\nwill be not less than two inches thick. The hot mixture is dumped and\r\nthen spread by means of shovels to the approximate thickness and the\r\nspreading completed by means of rakes. The surface is then rolled\r\neither with a tandem or a three-wheeled roller until thoroughly\r\ncompressed.\r\n\r\n=Seal Coat.=--After the rolling has been completed, the surface is\r\ncovered with hot bituminous cement and dressed with pea gravel or\r\nstone chips and again rolled. Traffic may be permitted in twenty-four\r\nhours.\r\n\r\n=Characteristics.=--The mixed macadam is a somewhat resilient surface\r\nof excellent riding qualities and considerable durability for medium\r\ntraffic. It is likely to creep and become uneven when subjected to\r\nheavy loads. The seal coat will wear off in two or three years and\r\nwill require replacing.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. Asphaltic Concrete\r\n\r\nAsphaltic concrete is a name given to a road surface mixture which is\r\ncomposed of graded stone, graded sand and asphalt cement. This type is\r\ndesignated as asphaltic concrete because of the analogy of the mixture\r\nto Portland cement concrete.\r\n\r\nAsphaltic concrete is of two general types known as bitulithic, or\r\nWarrenite, and Topeka asphaltic concrete, respectively, the\r\ndifferences being in the nature of the mixture.\r\n\r\n=Bitulithic or Warrenite.=--The stone employed for these types is\r\ngraded down from a size about equal to one-half of the thickness of\r\nthe wearing course, and stone passing a 1-1/4 or 1-1/2-inch screen is\r\nusually specified. From the maximum size the stone is graded down to\r\nthe finest particles produced by the crusher. The range of sizes of\r\nstone will vary with the source of the supply, and in order to secure\r\nthe desired density in the mixture, varying amounts of graded sand and\r\nmineral dust, such as ground limestone or Portland cement, are added\r\nto the broken stone. Usually the resulting mixture contains less than\r\nfifteen per cent of voids, and to this carefully graded mineral\r\naggregate there is added enough asphalt cement to bind together the\r\nparticles.\r\n\r\n=Topeka Asphaltic Concrete.=--In this type of asphaltic concrete, the\r\nmineral aggregate consists of a mixture of carefully graded sand and\r\nof broken stone of such size that all will pass a one-half-inch screen\r\nand graded down to the fine dust produced by the crusher. To this\r\nmixture is added about nine per cent of Portland cement or limestone\r\ndust. The voids in the mixture are usually about twenty-five per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that the essential differences between the Bitulithic\r\nand Topeka types are these: the Topeka type contains a larger\r\npercentage of voids and stone of a smaller maximum size than the\r\nBitulithic. Both types have been extensively employed for city paving,\r\nbut the Bitulithic and Warrenite types have also been used to some\r\nextent for rural highways. The Topeka type has been used but little\r\nfor rural highways.\r\n\r\n=Foundation.=--The foundation for the asphaltic concrete may be an old\r\nmacadam road, a base course constructed of broken stone or Portland\r\ncement concrete, the latter being used much more extensively than\r\neither of the other types.\r\n\r\nSometimes asphaltic concrete is used for resurfacing water-bound\r\nmacadam or gravel roads when the traffic has increased to the point\r\nwhere the cost of maintenance of the water-bound macadam has become\r\nexcessive. The existing surface is repaired and the cross section is\r\nrestored, or possibly flattened somewhat.\r\n\r\n=Placing the Surface.=--The stone, sand and asphalt cement are heated\r\nto the required temperature and combined in the proper proportions and\r\nare then thoroughly mixed by a mechanical mixer. The mixture is hauled\r\ndirectly to the road and is dumped and spread by means of rakes. It is\r\nthen rolled thoroughly while still hot, a three-wheeled roller being\r\nmost satisfactory. After rolling, a seal coat of hot asphalt cement is\r\nspread over the surface and covered with hot stone chips about 1/4\r\ninch in size. The surface can be opened to traffic immediately after\r\nthe surface has been completed.\r\n\r\n=Characteristics.=--The asphaltic concrete surface is of excellent\r\nriding properties, is easily repaired and of moderate durability. It\r\nis a particularly desirable surface for pleasure automobile riding and\r\nfor horse drawn traffic.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nMAINTENANCE OF HIGHWAYS\r\n\r\n\r\nProper maintenance of highways is equally important with proper\r\nconstruction. With nearly all types of road construction, the need for\r\nmaintenance arises soon after the surface is placed under traffic and\r\nis continuous thereafter. The nature and amount of maintenance work\r\nvaries greatly among the several types of surface and the organization\r\nsuitable for a system of highways will depend to a considerable extent\r\nupon the kinds of surfaces that are to be maintained.\r\n\r\nThe upkeep of a road may be conveniently considered as of two kinds,\r\nviz., (1) that which has to do with the wearing surface and earth\r\nshoulders or berms upon which there is some traffic and (2) that which\r\nhas to do with the side ditches and drainage structures and keeping\r\nthe roadside in presentable condition. Both kinds of work are usually\r\ncarried out by the same organization, but whereas the nature of the\r\nwork indicated under (1) will vary with the type of wearing surface\r\nand with all variations in traffic, that which is indicated under (2)\r\nwill be nearly constant in any locality.\r\n\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION FOR MAINTENANCE\r\n\r\nMaintenance of highways is preferably under the administration of the\r\nsame authority as construction and when an improvement is undertaken\r\nunder the jurisdiction of a State Highway Department, the completed\r\nimprovement is ordinarily maintained under the state authority. If\r\nthe improvement is made by county authorities, the maintenance is also\r\ncarried out under county authority.\r\n\r\nThe nature of the organization of maintenance forces is dependent upon\r\nthe kind of roads to be cared for and must of necessity be varied in\r\nany instance as conditions demand. In general, either maintenance\r\ngangs or patrolmen are employed and often both are used on the same\r\nroad system.\r\n\r\n=Patrol Maintenance.=--Where this system is in operation, the highway\r\nsystem is divided into patrol districts of from six to eighteen miles\r\nof highway and a single patrolman is placed in charge of each\r\ndistrict. He is provided with all of the necessary tools and materials\r\nrequired in his district and performs all of the work required in the\r\nordinary upkeep of the highway. He should work under the direction of\r\nthe county engineer or the district engineer for the state highway\r\ndepartment, because his work involves the use of materials and\r\nprocesses requiring technical supervision.\r\n\r\n=Gang Maintenance.=--The maintenance gang may be employed for some\r\ntypes of road surface in lieu of the patrolman or with other types of\r\nsurface may be employed to supplement the work of the patrolman. The\r\nmaintenance gang consists of three to ten men and is furnished all of\r\nthe tools and materials required for the particular kind of work they\r\ndo. Ordinarily the gang goes over the roads assigned to it once each\r\nseason and performs those repair operations requiring more work than\r\nthe patrolman can find time for. The work of the maintenance gang like\r\nthat of the patrolman should be under engineering supervision.\r\n\r\n=Maintenance of Earth, Sand-clay, Gravel and Macadam Roads.=--The\r\nordinary upkeep of earth, sand-clay, gravel and macadam surfaces is\r\nmost readily accomplished by the patrol method, since constant care is\r\nrequired to keep the roads in a condition of maximum service ability.\r\n\r\nThe tools required for each patrolman may include the following:\r\n\r\n  1 shovel              1 spade\r\n  1 stone rake          1 pick\r\n  1 scythe              1 tamper\r\n  1 or more road drags  1 mowing machine for cutting weeds\r\n  1 wheelbarrow           (sometimes)\r\n  1 light truck         1 small kit carpenter's tools\r\n\r\nThe work of the patrolman consists in keeping the surface of the road\r\nsmooth by dragging, repairing chuck holes by tamping in fresh material\r\nof the appropriate kind, keeping the ditches and culverts free from\r\nobstruction, cutting weeds and repairing bridge floors if they are of\r\nplank construction. Removal of snow drifts is sometimes a part of the\r\npatrolman's duty, but more often that is done by special gangs.\r\nUsually the patrolman is authorized to hire teams for dragging and\r\ncutting weeds.\r\n\r\nWhen an earth road requires to be re-graded so as to restore the\r\ncross-section and deepen the ditches, a gang is sent in to perform\r\nthat work, as it is obviously impossible for the patrolman to perform\r\nwork, of that kind.\r\n\r\nIf the gravel road is being maintained with a bituminous carpet coat,\r\nthe patrolman will be furnished the necessary tools to enable him to\r\npatch the surface with bituminous material as necessity requires.\r\n\r\nWhen the surface deteriorates to such an extent that a new carpet coat\r\nis required, the gang system is employed for all work connected with\r\nresurfacing, instead of attempting to have the work done by patrolmen.\r\n\r\nThe maintenance of the macadam road is carried out in much the same\r\nmanner as that of the gravel road. The binder of stone dust or clayey\r\nsand is renewed as often as it is swept off by traffic. Depressions or\r\nruts are repaired by first loosening the surface with a pick and then\r\nadding broken stone and screenings to restore the surface.\r\n\r\nWhen the macadam reaches the stage where entire resurfacing is\r\nneeded, the work is performed by gangs organized and equipped for the\r\npurpose; and likewise when the surface is being maintained with a\r\nbituminous carpet, the renewal of the carpet coat is performed by\r\nspecial gangs, but the ordinary upkeep of the surface by patching is\r\nhandled by a patrolman.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAINTENANCE OF MIXED BITUMINOUS SURFACES\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 22.--Scarafier used in Gravel Road Maintenance]\r\n\r\nThese types of surface can be kept in satisfactory condition if they\r\nare carefully repaired once or twice each season. This work requires\r\nconsiderable experience and some special equipment, not ordinarily\r\nsupplied to patrolmen. A gang is organized for the work and supplied\r\nwith the proper equipment. They go over the roads and patch all worn\r\nplaces, generally first removing the wearing surface entirely in the\r\narea affected.\r\n\r\nThe wearing surface mixture is then prepared and tamped or rolled into\r\nplace. If the area affected is small, tamping is satisfactory, and\r\nwhen the area is considerable, rolling is employed. The upkeep of the\r\nside roads may be accomplished by the same gang but is preferably\r\ntaken care of by patrolmen, who do not attempt any but minor repairs\r\nto the wearing surface.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAINTENANCE OF BRICK AND CONCRETE ROADS\r\n\r\nOn brick and concrete roads, the principal work on the wearing surface\r\nconsists in filling the cracks with a suitable bituminous material.\r\nThis work is done by patrolmen or by special gangs and generally will\r\nbe done once each year. The upkeep of the side roads is cared for by\r\npatrolmen who drag the side roads and cut the weeds as occasion\r\nrequires.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Administration county; 15\r\n    federal;
