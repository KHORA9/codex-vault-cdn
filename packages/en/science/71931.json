The present\r\nwork was undertaken by both authors as a labor of patriotism and\r\nbecause of their interest in the Service.\r\n\r\nThe two years which have elapsed since the initial discussion of the\r\noutlines of the book have thoroughly convinced us of the need of such\r\na work. The Engineers, the Medical Department, and most of the other\r\nbranches of the Army have their recognized textbooks and manuals.\r\nThere has been no way, however, by which the uninformed can check the\r\naccuracy of statements regarding Chemical Warfare. The present volume\r\nwill serve, in a measure, to fill this gap. That it does not do so\r\nmore completely is due in part to the fact that secrecy must still be\r\nmaintained about some of the facts and some of the new discoveries\r\nwhich are the property of the Service. Those familiar with the work of\r\nthe Chemical Warfare Service will discover, though, that the following\r\npages contain many statements which were zealously guarded secrets two\r\nyears ago. This enlarged program of publicity on the part of the Chief\r\nof the Service is being justified every day by the ever increasing\r\ninterest in this branch of warfare. Where five men were discussing\r\nChemical Warfare two years ago, fifty men are talking about the work\r\nand the possibilities of the Service today. It is hoped that the facts\r\nhere presented may further increase the interest in Chemical Warfare,\r\nfor there is no question but that it must be recognized as a permanent\r\nand a very vital branch of the Army of every country. Reasons for this\r\nwill be found scattered through the pages of this book.\r\n\r\nIt should be explained that this is in no sense a complete historical\r\nsketch of the development and personnel of the Chemical Warfare\r\nService. At least two more volumes are needed,—one on the Manufacture\r\nof Poisonous Gases and one on the Tactics of Chemical Warfare. We have\r\npurposely refrained from an attempt to give credit to individuals for\r\nthe accomplishments of the various Divisions of the Service, because\r\nsuch an attempt would have made the book too voluminous, and would\r\nhave defeated the primary purpose, namely, that it should present\r\nthe information in as concise manner as possible. The published and\r\nunpublished materials of the files of all the Divisions have been\r\nfreely drawn upon in writing the various chapters, and many old C. W.\r\nS. men will undoubtedly recognize whole sentences which they wrote\r\nunder the stress of the laboratory or plant “battle front.” May\r\nthese few lines be an acknowledgment of their contributions. Those\r\nwho desire to consult the literature of Chemical Warfare will find a\r\nfairly complete bibliography (to about the middle of 1919) in “Special\r\nLibraries” for November, 1919.\r\n\r\nSpecial acknowledgment is made to Dr. G. J. Esselen, Jr., for having\r\nread the manuscript and for helpful and constructive criticisms.\r\nMany of the figures are reproduced by permission of the Journal of\r\nIndustrial and Engineering Chemistry; those showing the Nelson cell\r\nwere furnished by the Samuel M. Green Company.\r\n\r\n                                            AMOS A. FRIES,\r\n                                            CLARENCE J. WEST.\r\n\r\n    Aug. 1, 1921.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOREWORD\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter all peaceful means of settling disputes between nations have\r\nbeen resorted to and have failed, war is often declared by one of the\r\ndisputants for the purpose of imposing its will upon the other by\r\nforce. In order to accomplish this, a superiority must be established\r\nover the adversary in trained men and in implements of war.\r\n\r\nMen are nothing in modern war unless they are equipped with the most\r\neffective devices for killing and maiming the enemy’s soldiers and\r\nthoroughly trained in the use of such implements.\r\n\r\nHistory proves that an effective implement of war has never been\r\ndiscarded until it becomes obsolete.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to humanize the act of killing and maiming the enemy’s\r\nsoldiers, and there is no logical grounds on which to condemn an\r\nappliance so long as its application can be so confined. Experiments in\r\nthis and other countries during the World War completely established\r\nthe fact that gas can be so confined. The range of gas clouds is no\r\ngreater than that of artillery and the population in the area behind\r\nthe front line must, if they remain in such range, take their chance.\r\nThe danger area in the future will be known to all.\r\n\r\nAs the first Director of the Chemical Warfare Service, U. S. Army, I\r\nspeak with some experience when I say that there is no field in which\r\nthe future possibilities are greater than in chemical warfare, and no\r\nfield in which neglect to keep abreast of the times in research and\r\ntraining would be more disastrous.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the fact that gas was used in the World War two years\r\nbefore the United States entered the fray, practically nothing was\r\ndone in this country before April, 1917, towards the development of\r\nany chemical warfare appliances, offensive or defensive, and had it\r\nnot been for the ability of an ally to supply our troops with such\r\nappliances, they would have been as defenseless as the Canadians were\r\nat Ypres when the Germans sent over their first gas cloud.\r\n\r\nThis book recites the troubles and successes of this new service under\r\nthe stress of war for which it was unprepared and I trust that its\r\nperusal will create a public opinion that will insist upon chemical\r\npreparation for war.\r\n\r\nI feel that this book will show that the genius and patriotism\r\ndisplayed by the chemists and chemical engineers of the country were\r\nnot surpassed in any other branch of war work and that to fail to\r\nutilize in peace times this talent would be a crime.\r\n\r\n    WILLIAM L.

The popular opinion is that\r\nthis form of warfare was original with the Germans. Such, however, is\r\nnot the case. Quoting from an article in the _Candid Quarterly Review_,\r\n=4=, 561, “All they can claim is the inhuman adoption of devices\r\ninvented in England, and by England rejected as too horrible to be\r\nentertained even for use against an enemy.” But the use of poison gases\r\nis even of an earlier origin than this article claims.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: This chapter originally appeared in Science, Vol. =49=,\r\npp. 412-417 (1919).]\r\n\r\nThe first recorded effort to overcome an enemy by the generation of\r\npoisonous and suffocating gases seems to have been in the wars of the\r\nAthenians and Spartans (431-404 B.C.) when, besieging the cities of\r\nPlatea and Belium, the Spartans saturated wood with pitch and sulfur\r\nand burned it under the walls of these cities in the hope of choking\r\nthe defenders and rendering the assault less difficult. Similar uses\r\nof poisonous gases are recorded during the Middle Ages. In effect\r\nthey were like our modern stink balls, but were projected by squirts\r\nor in bottles after the manner of a hand grenade. The legend is told\r\nof Prester John (about the eleventh century), that he stuffed copper\r\nfigures with explosives and combustible materials which, emitted from\r\nthe mouths and nostrils of the effigies, played great havoc.\r\n\r\nThe idea referred to by the writer in the _Candid Quarterly Review_,\r\nis from the pen of the English Lord Dundonald, which appeared in the\r\npublication entitled “The Panmure Papers.” This is an extremely dull\r\nrecord of an extremely dull person, only rendered interesting by the\r\none portion, concerned with the use of poison gases, which, it is said,\r\n“should never have been published at all.”\r\n\r\nThat portion of the article from the _Candid Quarterly Review_ dealing\r\nwith the introduction of poisonous gas by the Germans, and referred to\r\nin the first paragraph above, is quoted in full as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The great Admiral Lord Dundonald—perhaps the ablest\r\n    sea captain ever known, not even excluding Lord\r\n    Nelson—was also a man of wide observation, and no\r\n    mean chemist. He had been struck in 1811 by the deadly\r\n    character of the fumes of sulphur in Sicily; and, when\r\n    the Crimean War was being waged, he communicated to\r\n    the English government, then presided over by Lord\r\n    Palmerston, a plan for the reduction of Sebastopol\r\n    by sulphur fumes. The plan was imparted to Lord\r\n    Panmure and Lord Palmerston, and the way in which it\r\n    was received is so illustrative of the trickery and\r\n    treachery of the politician that it is worth while to\r\n    quote Lord Palmerston’s private communication upon it\r\n    to Lord Panmure:\r\n\r\n          “LORD PALMERSTON TO LORD PANMURE\r\n\r\n               “‘HOUSE OF COMMONS, 7th August, 1855\r\n    “‘I agree with you that if Dundonald will go out\r\n    himself to superintend and direct the execution of\r\n    his scheme, we ought to accept his offer and try his\r\n    plan. If it succeeds, it will, as you say, save a great\r\n    number of English and French lives; if it fails _in\r\n    his hands_, we shall be exempt from blame, and if\r\n    we come in for a small share of the ridicule, we can\r\n    bear it, and the greater part will fall on him. You\r\n    had best, therefore, make arrangement with him without\r\n    delay, and with as much secrecy as the nature of things\r\n    will admit of.’\r\n\r\n    “Inasmuch as Lord Dundonald’s plans have already been\r\n    deliberately published by the two persons above named,\r\n    there can be no harm in now republishing them. They\r\n    will be found in the first volume of ‘The Panmure\r\n    Papers’ (pp. 340-342) and are as follows:\r\n\r\n                  “‘(ENCLOSURE)\r\n\r\n           “‘BRIEF PRELIMINARY OBSERVATIONS\r\n\r\n    “‘It was observed when viewing the Sulphur Kilns, in\r\n    July, 1811, that the fumes which escaped in the rude\r\n    process of extracting the material, though first\r\n    elevated by heat, soon fell to the ground, destroying\r\n    all vegetation, and endangering animal life to a great\r\n    distance, and it was asserted that an ordinance existed\r\n    prohibiting persons from sleeping within the distance\r\n    of three miles during the melting season.\r\n\r\n    “‘An application of these facts was immediately made\r\n    to Military and Naval purposes, and after mature\r\n    consideration, a Memorial was presented on the subject\r\n    to His Royal Highness the Prince Regent on the 12th\r\n    of April, 1812, who was graciously pleased to lay it\r\n    before a Commission, consisting of Lord Keith, Lord\r\n    Exmouth and General and Colonel Congreve (afterwards\r\n    Sir William), by whom a favorable report having been\r\n    given, His Royal Highness was pleased to order that\r\n    secrecy should be maintained by all parties.\r\n                                  “‘(Signed) DUNDONALD\r\n\r\n       “‘7th August, 1855’\r\n\r\n                   “‘MEMORANDUM\r\n\r\n    “‘Materials required for the expulsion of the Russians\r\n    from Sebastopol: Experimental trials have shown that\r\n    about five parts of coke effectually vaporize one part\r\n    of sulphur. Mixtures for land service, where weight\r\n    is of importance, may, however, probably be suggested\r\n    by Professor Faraday, as to operations on shore I\r\n    have paid little attention. Four or five hundred tons\r\n    of sulphur and two thousand tons of coke would be\r\n    sufficient.\r\n\r\n    “‘Besides these materials, it would be necessary to\r\n    have, say, as much bituminous coal, and a couple of\r\n    thousand barrels of gas or other tar, for the purpose\r\n    of masking fortifications to be attacked, or others\r\n    that flank the assailing positions.\r\n\r\n    “‘A quantity of dry firewood, chips, shavings, straw,\r\n    hay or other such combustible materials, would also\r\n    be requisite quickly to kindle the fires, which ought\r\n    to be kept in readiness for the first favourable and\r\n    steady breeze.\r\n                                      “‘DUNDONALD\r\n\r\n        “‘7th August, 1855’\r\n\r\n    “‘=_Note._=—The objects to be accomplished\r\n    being specially stated the responsibility of their\r\n    accomplishment ought to rest on those who direct their\r\n    execution.\r\n\r\n    “‘Suppose that the Malakoff and Redan are the objects\r\n    to be assailed it might be judicious merely to obscure\r\n    the Redan (by the smoke of coal and tar kindled in ‘The\r\n    Quarries’), so that it could not annoy the Mamelon,\r\n    where the sulphur fire would be placed to expel\r\n    the garrison from the Malakoff, which ought to have\r\n    all the cannon that can be turned towards its ramparts\r\n    employed in overthrowing its undefended ramparts.\r\n\r\n    “‘There is no doubt but that the fumes will envelop all\r\n    the defenses from the Malakoff to the Barracks, and\r\n    even to the line of battleship, the Twelve Apostles, at\r\n    anchor in the harbour.\r\n\r\n    “‘The two outer batteries, on each side of the Port,\r\n    ought to be smoked, sulphured, and blown down by\r\n    explosion vessels, and their destruction completed by a\r\n    few ships of war anchored under cover of the smoke.’\r\n\r\n    “That was Lord Dundonald’s plan in 1855, improperly\r\n    published in 1908, and by the Germans, who thus learnt\r\n    it, ruthlessly put into practise in 1915.\r\n\r\n    “Lord Dundonald’s memoranda, together with further\r\n    elucidatory notes, were submitted by the English\r\n    government of that day to a committee and subsequently\r\n    to another committee in which Lord Playfair took\r\n    leading part. These committees, with Lord Dundonald’s\r\n    plans fully and in detail before them, both reported\r\n    that the plans were perfectly feasible; that the\r\n    effects expected from them would undoubtedly be\r\n    produced; but that those effects were so horrible that\r\n    no honorable combatant could use the means required to\r\n    produce them. The committee therefore recommended that\r\n    the scheme should not be adopted; that Lord Dundonald’s\r\n    account of it should be destroyed. How the records\r\n    were obtained and preserved by those who so improperly\r\n    published them in 1908 we do not know. Presumably they\r\n    were found among Lord Panmure’s papers. Admiral Lord\r\n    Dundonald himself was certainly no party to their\r\n    publication.”\r\n\r\nOne of the early, if not the earliest suggestion as to the use of\r\npoison gas in shell is found in an article on “Greek Fire,” by B. W.\r\nRichardson.[2]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: _Popular Science Review_, =3=, 176 (1864).]\r\n\r\nHe says:\r\n\r\n    “I feel it a duty to state openly and boldly, that if\r\n    science were to be allowed her full swing, if society\r\n    would really allow that ‘all is fair in war,’ war\r\n    might be banished at once from the earth as a game\r\n    which neither subject nor king dare play at. Globes\r\n    that could distribute liquid fire could distribute\r\n    also lethal agents, within the breath of which no man,\r\n    however puissant, could stand and live. From the summit\r\n    of Primrose Hill, a few hundred engineers, properly\r\n    prepared, could render Regent’s Park, in an incredibly\r\n    short space of time, utterly uninhabitable; or could\r\n    make an army of men, that should even fill that space,\r\n    fall with their arms in their hands, prostrate and\r\n    helpless as the host of Sennacherib.\r\n\r\n    “The question is, shall these things be? I do not\r\n    see that humanity should revolt, for would it not be\r\n    better to destroy a host in Regent’s Park by making\r\n    the men fall as in a mystical sleep, than to let\r\n    down on them another host to break their bones, tear\r\n    their limbs asunder and gouge out their entrails with\r\n    three-cornered pikes; leaving a vast majority undead,\r\n    and writhing for hours in torments of the damned?\r\n    I conceive, for one, that science would be blessed\r\n    in spreading her wings on the blast, and breathing\r\n    into the face of a desperate horde of men prolonged\r\n    sleep—for it need not necessarily be a death—which\r\n    they could not grapple with, and which would yield them\r\n    up with their implements of murder to an enemy that in\r\n    the immensity of its power could afford to be merciful\r\n    as Heaven.\r\n\r\n    “The question is, shall these things be? I think they\r\n    must be. By what compact can they be stopped? It were\r\n    improbable that any congress of nations could agree on\r\n    any code regulating means of destruction; but if it\r\n    did, it were useless; for science becomes more powerful\r\n    as she concentrates her forces in the hands of units,\r\n    so that a nation could only act, by the absolute and\r\n    individual assent of each of her representatives.\r\n    Assume, then, that France shall lay war to England, and\r\n    by superior force of men should place immense hosts,\r\n    well armed, on English soil. Is it probable that the\r\n    units would rest in peace and allow sheer brute force\r\n    to win its way to empire? Or put English troops on\r\n    French soil, and reverse the question?\r\n\r\n    “To conclude. War has, at this moment, reached, in its\r\n    details, such an extravagance of horror and cruelty,\r\n    that it can not be made worse by any art, and can only\r\n    be made more merciful by being rendered more terribly\r\n    energetic. Who that had to die from a blow would not\r\n    rather place his head under Nasmyth’s hammer, than\r\n    submit it to a drummer-boy armed with a ferrule?”\r\n\r\nThe _Army and Navy Register_ of May 29, 1915, reports that\r\n\r\n    “among the recommendations forwarded to the Board of\r\n    Ordnance and Fortifications there may be found many\r\n    suggestions in favor of the asphyxiation process,\r\n    mostly by the employment of gases contained in bombs\r\n    to be thrown within the lines of the foe, with varying\r\n    effects from peaceful slumber to instant death. One\r\n    ingenious person suggested a bomb laden to its full\r\n    capacity with snuff, which should be so evenly and\r\n    thoroughly distributed that the enemy would be\r\n    convulsed with sneezing, and in this period of paroxysm\r\n    it would be possible to creep up on him and capture him\r\n    in the throes of the convulsion.”\r\n\r\nThat the probable use of poisonous gas has often been in the minds\r\nof military men during recent times is evidenced by the fact that at\r\nthe Hague Conference in 1899 several of the more prominent nations of\r\nEurope and Asia pledged themselves not to use projectiles whose only\r\nobject was to give out suffocating or poisonous gases. Many of the\r\nPowers did not sign this declaration until later. Germany signed and\r\nratified it on Sept. 4, 1900, but the United States never signed it.\r\nFurther, this declaration was not to be binding in case of a war in\r\nwhich a non-signatory was or became a belligerent. Admiral Mahan, a\r\nUnited States delegate, stated his position in regard to the use of gas\r\nin shell (at that time an untried theory) as follows:\r\n\r\n    “The reproach of cruelty and perfidy addressed against\r\n    these supposed shells was equally uttered previously\r\n    against fire-arms and torpedoes, although both are\r\n    now employed without scruple. It is illogical and not\r\n    demonstrably humane to be tender about asphyxiating\r\n    men with gas, when all are prepared to admit that it\r\n    is allowable to blow the bottom out of an ironclad\r\n    at midnight, throwing four or five hundred men into\r\n    the sea to be choked by the water, with scarcely the\r\n    remotest chance to escape.”\r\n\r\nAt the Hague Congress of 1907, article 23 of the rules adopted for war\r\non land states:\r\n\r\n    “It is expressly forbidden (_a_),\r\n     to employ poisons or poisonous weapons.”\r\n\r\nBefore the War suffocating cartridges were shot from the\r\ncartridge-throwing rifle of 26 mm. These cartridges were charged with\r\nethyl bromoacetate, a slightly suffocating and non-toxic lachrymator.\r\nThey were intended for attack on the flanking works of permanent\r\nfortifications, flanking casements or caponiers, into which the enemy\r\ntried to make the cartridges penetrate through the narrow slits used\r\nfor loopholes. The men who were serving the machine guns or the cannon\r\nof the flanking works would have been bothered by the vapor from the\r\nethyl bromoacetate, and the assailant would have profited by their\r\ndisturbance to get past the obstacle presented by the fortification.\r\nThe employment of these devices, not entailing death, did not\r\ncontravene the Hague conventions.\r\n\r\nThe only memorable operations in the course of which these devices were\r\nused before the War was the attack on the Bonnet gang at Choisy-le-roi.\r\n\r\nIn connection with the suggested use of sulfur dioxide by Lord\r\nDundonald and the proposed use of poisonous gases in shell, the\r\nfollowing description of a charcoal respirator by Dr. J. Stenhouse,[3]\r\ncommunicated by Dr. George Wilson in 1854, is of interest.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: _Trans. Royal Scottish Soc. Arts_, =4=, Appendix O, 198\r\n(1854).]\r\n\r\n    “Dr. Wilson commenced by stating that, having read with\r\n    much interest the account of Dr. Stenhouse’s researches\r\n    on the deodorizing and disinfecting properties\r\n    of charcoal, and the application of these to the\r\n    construction of a new and important kind of respirator,\r\n    he had requested the accomplished chemist to send one\r\n    of his instruments for exhibition to the society,\r\n    which he had kindly done. Two of the instruments were\r\n    now on the table, differing, however, so slightly in\r\n    construction, that it would be sufficient to explain\r\n    the arrangement of one of them. Externally, it had\r\n    the appearance of a small fencing-mask of wire gauze,\r\n    covering the face from the chin upwards to the bridge\r\n    of the nose, but leaving the eyes and forehead free.\r\n    It consisted, essentially, of two plates of wire\r\n    gauze, separated from each other by a space of about\r\n    one-fourth or one-eighth of an inch, so as to form a\r\n    small cage filled with small fragments of charcoal. The\r\n    frame of the cage was of copper, but the edges were\r\n    made of soft lead, and were lined with velvet, so as to\r\n    admit of their being made to fit the cheeks tightly and\r\n    inclose the mouth and nostrils. By this arrangement, no\r\n    air could enter the lungs without passing through the\r\n    wire gauze and traversing the charcoal. An aperture is\r\n    provided with a screw or sliding valve for the removal\r\n    and replenishment of the contents of the cage, which\r\n    consist of the siftings or riddlings of the lighter\r\n    kinds of wood charcoal. The apparatus is attached to\r\n    the face by an elastic band passing over the crown of\r\n    the head and strings tying behind, as in the case of\r\n    the ordinary respirator. The important agent in this\r\n    instrument is the charcoal, which has so remarkable\r\n    a power of absorbing and destroying irritating and\r\n    otherwise irrespirable and poisonous gases or vapors\r\n    that, armed with the respirator, spirits of hartshorn,\r\n    sulphuretted hydrogen, hydrosulphuret of ammonia and\r\n    chlorine may be breathed through it with impunity,\r\n    though but slightly diluted with air. This result,\r\n    first obtained by Dr. Stenhouse, has been verified by\r\n    those who have repeated the trial, among others by Dr.\r\n    Wilson, who has tried the vapors named above on himself\r\n    and four of his pupils, who have breathed them with\r\n    impunity. The explanation of this remarkable property\r\n    of charcoal is two-fold. It has long been known to\r\n    possess the power of condensing into its pores gases\r\n    and vapors, so that if freshly prepared and exposed to\r\n    these, it absorbs and retains them. But it has scarcely\r\n    been suspected till recently, when Dr. Stenhouse\r\n    pointed out the fact, that if charcoal be allowed\r\n    to absorb simultaneously such gases as sulphuretted\r\n    hydrogen and air, the oxygen of this absorbed and\r\n    condensed air rapidly oxidizes and destroys the\r\n    accompanying gas. So marked is this action, that if\r\n    dead animals be imbedded in a layer of charcoal a few\r\n    inches deep, instead of being prevented from decaying\r\n    as it has hitherto been supposed that they would be by\r\n    the supposed antiseptic powers of the charcoal, they\r\n    are found by Dr. Stenhouse to decay much faster, whilst\r\n    at the same time, no offensive effluvia are evolved.\r\n    The deodorizing powers of charcoal are thus established\r\n    in a way they never have been before; but at the\r\n    same time it is shown that the addition of charcoal\r\n    to sewage refuse lessens its agricultural value\r\n    contemporaneously with the lessening of odor. From\r\n    these observations, which have been fully verified, it\r\n    appears that by strewing charcoal coarsely powdered to\r\n    the extent of a few inches, over church-yards, or by\r\n    placing it inside the coffins of the dead, the escape\r\n    of noisome and poisonous exhalations may be totally\r\n    prevented. The charcoal respirator embodies this\r\n    important discovery. It is certain that many of the\r\n    miasma, malaria and infectious matters which propagate\r\n    disease in the human subjects, enter the body by the\r\n    lungs, and impregnating the blood there, are carried\r\n    with it throughout the entire body, which they thus\r\n    poison. These miasma are either gases and vapors or\r\n    bodies which, like fine light dust, are readily carried\r\n    through the air; moreover, they are readily destroyed\r\n    by oxidizing agents, which convert them into harmless,\r\n    or at least non-poisonous substances, such as water,\r\n    carbonic acid and nitrogen. There is every reason,\r\n    therefore, for believing that charcoal will oxidize\r\n    and destroy such miasma as effectually as it does\r\n    sulphuretted hydrogen or hydrosulphuret of ammonia, and\r\n    thus prevent their reaching and poisoning the blood.\r\n    The intention accordingly is that those who are exposed\r\n    to noxious vapors, or compelled to breathe infected\r\n    atmospheres, shall wear the charcoal respirator,\r\n    with a view to arrest and destroy the volatile\r\n    poisons contained in these. Some of the non-obvious\r\n    applications of the respirator were then referred to:\r\n\r\n      “1. Certain of the large chemical manufacturers in\r\n      London are now supplying their workmen with the\r\n      charcoal respirators as a protection against the more\r\n      irritating vapors to which they are exposed.\r\n\r\n      “2. Many deaths have occurred among those employed\r\n      to explore the large drains and sewers of London\r\n      from exposure to sulphuretted hydrogen, etc. It may\r\n      be asserted with confidence that fatal results from\r\n      exposure to the drainage gases will cease as soon as\r\n      the respirator is brought into use.\r\n\r\n      “3. In districts such as the Campagna of Rome, where\r\n      malaria prevails and to travel during night or to\r\n      sleep in which is certainly followed by an attack of\r\n      dangerous and often fatal ague, the wearing of the\r\n      respirator even for a few hours may be expected to\r\n      render the marsh poison harmless.\r\n\r\n      “4. Those, who as clergymen, physicians or legal\r\n      advisers, have to attend the sick-beds of sufferers\r\n      from infectious disorders, may, on occasion, avail\r\n      themselves of the protection afforded by Dr.\r\n      Stenhouse’s instrument during their intercourse with\r\n      the sick.\r\n\r\n      “5. The longing for a short and decisive war has led\r\n      to the invention of ‘a suffocating bombshell,’ which\r\n      on bursting, spreads far and wide an irrespirable or\r\n      poisonous vapor; one of the liquids proposed for the\r\n      shell is the strongest ammonia, and against this it\r\n      is believed that the charcoal respirator may defend\r\n      our soldiers. As likely to serve this end, it is at\r\n      present before the Board of Ordnance.\r\n\r\n      “Dr. Wilson stated, in conclusion, that Dr. Stenhouse\r\n      had no interest but a scientific one in the success of\r\n      the respirators. He had declined to patent them, and\r\n      desired only to apply his remarkable discoveries to the\r\n      abatement of disease and death. Charcoal had long been\r\n      used in filters to render poisonous water wholesome; it\r\n      was now to be employed to filter poisonous air.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nMODERN DEVELOPMENT OF GAS WARFARE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe use of toxic gas in the World War dates from April 22, 1915, when\r\nthe Germans launched the first cylinder attack, employing chlorine, a\r\ncommon and well known gas. Judging from the later experience of the\r\nAllies in perfecting this form of attack, it is probable that plans for\r\nthis attack had been under way for months before it was launched. The\r\nsuggestion that poisonous gases be used in warfare has been laid upon\r\nProf. Nernst of the University of Berlin (Auld, “Gas and Flame,” page\r\n15), while the actual field operations were said to have been under\r\nthe direction of Prof. Haber of the Kaiser Wilhelm Physical Chemical\r\nInstitute of Berlin. Some writers have felt that the question of\r\npreparation had been a matter of years rather than of months, and refer\r\nto the work on industrial gases as a proof of their statement. The fact\r\nthat the gas attack was not more successful, that the results to be\r\nobtained were not more appreciated, and that better preparation against\r\nretaliation had not been made, argues against this idea of a long\r\nperiod of preparation, except possibly in a very desultory way. That\r\nsuch was the case is most fortunate for the allied cause, for had the\r\nGerman high command known the real situation at the close of the first\r\ngas attack, or had that attack been more severe, the outcome of the war\r\nof 1914 would have been very different, and the end very much earlier.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIRST GAS ATTACK\r\n\r\nThe first suggestion of a gas attack came to the British Army through\r\nthe story of a German deserter. He stated that the German Army was\r\nplanning to poison their enemy with a cloud of gas, and that the\r\ncylinders had already been installed in the trenches. No one listened\r\nto the story, because, first of all, the whole procedure seemed so\r\nimpossible and also because, in spite of the numerous examples of\r\nGerman barbarity, the English did not believe the Germans capable of\r\nsuch a violation of the Hague rules of warfare. The story appeared in\r\nthe summary of information from headquarters (“Comic Cuts”) and as Auld\r\nsays “was passed for information for what it is worth.” But the story\r\nwas true, and on the afternoon of the 22nd of April, all the conditions\r\nbeing ideal, the beginning of “gas warfare” was launched. Details of\r\nthat first gas attack will always be meager, for the simple reason that\r\nthe men who could have told about it all lie in Flanders field where\r\nthe poppies grow.\r\n\r\nThe place selected was in the northeast part of the Ypres salient, at\r\nthat part of the line where the French and British lines met, running\r\nsouthward from where the trenches left the canal near Boesinghe. The\r\nFrench right was held by the —— Regiment of Turcos, while on the\r\nBritish left were the Canadians. Auld describes the attack as follows:\r\n\r\n    “Try to imagine the feelings and the condition of\r\n    the colored troops as they saw the vast cloud of\r\n    greenish-yellow gas spring out of the ground and slowly\r\n    move down wind towards them, the vapor clinging to the\r\n    earth, seeking out every hole and hollow and filling\r\n    the trenches and shell holes as it came. First wonder,\r\n    then fear; then, as the first, fringes of the cloud\r\n    enveloped them and left them choking and agonized in\r\n    the fight for breath—panic. Those who could move broke\r\n    and ran, trying, generally in vain, to outstrip the\r\n    cloud which followed inexorably after them.”\r\n\r\nIt is only to be expected that the first feeling connected with\r\ngas warfare was one of horror. That side of it is very thrillingly\r\ndescribed by Rev. O. S. Watkins in the _Methodist Recorder_ (London).\r\nAfter describing the bombardment of the City of Ypres from April 20th\r\nto 22nd he relates that in the midst of the uproar came the poison gas!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.—French Gas Attack as seen from an Aeroplane.\r\n\r\nThe French front, second and third line trenches are plainly visible.\r\nThe gas is seen issuing over a wide front from the front line and\r\ndrifting towards the German lines.]\r\n\r\n    “Going into the open air for a few moments’ relief from\r\n    the stifling atmosphere of the wards, our attention was\r\n    attracted by very heavy firing to the north, where the\r\n    line was held by the French. Evidently a hot fight—and\r\n    eagerly we scanned the country with our field glasses\r\n    hoping to glean some knowledge of the progress of\r\n    the battle. Then we saw that which almost caused our\r\n    hearts to stop beating—figures running wildly and in\r\n    confusion over the fields.\r\n\r\n    “‘The French have broken,’ we exclaimed. We hardly\r\n    believed our words.... The story they told we could\r\n    not believe; we put it down to their terror-stricken\r\n    imaginings—a greenish-gray cloud had swept down upon\r\n    them, turning yellow as it traveled over the country,\r\n    blasting everything it touched, shriveling up the\r\n    vegetation. No human courage could face such a peril.\r\n\r\n    “Then there staggered into our midst French soldiers,\r\n    blinded, coughing, chests heaving, faces an ugly purple\r\n    color—lips speechless with agony, and behind them, in\r\n    the gas-choked trenches, we learned that they had left\r\n    hundreds of dead and dying comrades. The impossible was\r\n    only too true.\r\n\r\n    “It was the most fiendish, wicked thing I have ever\r\n    seen.”\r\n\r\nIt must be said here, however, that this was true only because the\r\nFrench had no protection against the gas. Indeed, it is far from being\r\nthe most horrible form of warfare, provided both sides are prepared\r\ndefensively and offensively. Medical records show that out of every\r\n100 Americans gassed less than two died, and as far as records of\r\nfour years show, very few are permanently injured. Out of every 100\r\nAmerican casualties from all forms of warfare other than gas more than\r\n25 per cent died, while from 2 to 5 per cent more are maimed, blinded\r\nor disfigured for life. Various forms of gas, as will be shown in the\r\nfollowing pages, make life miserable or vision impossible to those\r\nwithout a mask. Yet they do not kill.\r\n\r\nThus instead of gas warfare being the most horrible, it is the most\r\nhumane where both sides are prepared for it, while against savage\r\nor unprepared peoples it can be made so humane that but very few\r\ncasualties will result.\r\n\r\nThe development of methods of defense against gas will be discussed\r\nin a later chapter. It will suffice to say here that, in response to\r\nan appeal from Lord Kitchener, a temporary protection was quickly\r\nfurnished the men. This was known as the “Black Veiling” respirator,\r\nand consisted of a cotton pad soaked in ordinary washing soda solution,\r\nand later, in a mixture of washing soda and “hypo,” to which was added\r\na little glycerine. These furnished a fair degree of protection to the\r\nmen against chlorine, the only gas used in the early attacks.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHOSGENE INTRODUCED\r\n\r\nThe use of chlorine alone continued until the introduction on December\r\n19, 1915, of a mixture of phosgene with the chlorine. This mixture\r\noffered many advantages over the use of chlorine alone (see Chapter VI).\r\n\r\nThe Allies were able, through warning of the impending use of phosgene,\r\nto furnish a means of protection against it. It was at this time\r\nthat the P and the PH helmets were devised, the cotton filling being\r\nimpregnated with sodium phenolate and later with a mixture of sodium\r\nphenolate and hexamethylenetetramine. This helmet was used until the\r\nStandard Box Respirator was developed by the late Lt. Col. Harrison.\r\n\r\n\r\nALLIES ADOPT GAS\r\n\r\nFor a week or two the Allies were very hesitant about adopting gas\r\nwarfare. However, when the repeated use of gas by the Germans made\r\nit evident that, in spite of what the Hague had to say about the\r\nmatter, gas was to be a part, and as later developments showed, a very\r\nimportant part of modern warfare, they realized there was no choice on\r\ntheir part and that they had to retaliate in like manner. This decision\r\nwas reached in May of 1915. It was followed by the organization of a\r\nGas Service and intensive work on the part of chemists, engineers and\r\nphysiologists. It was September 25, 1915, however, before the English\r\nwere in a position to render a gas attack. From then on the Service\r\ngrew in numbers and in importance, whether viewed from the standpoint\r\nof research, production, or field operations.\r\n\r\nThe Allies of course adopted not only chlorine but phosgene as well,\r\nsince both were cheap, easy of preparation and effective. They felt\r\nduring the early part of the War that they should adopt a substance\r\nthat would kill instantly, and not one that would cause men to suffer\r\neither during the attack or through symptoms which would develop later\r\nin a hospital. For this reason a large amount of experimental work was\r\ncarried out on hydrocyanic acid, particularly by the French. Since this\r\ngas has a very low density, it was necessary to mix with it substances\r\nwhich would tend to keep it close to the ground during the attack.\r\nVarious mixtures, all called “vincennite,” were prepared,—chloroform,\r\narsenic trichloride and stannic chloride being used in varying\r\nproportions with the acid. It was some time before it was definitely\r\nlearned that these mixtures were far from being successful, both from\r\nthe standpoint of stability and of poisonous properties. While the\r\nFrench actually used these mixtures in constantly decreasing quantities\r\non the field for a long time, they were ultimately abandoned, though\r\nnot until American chemists had also carried out a large number\r\nof tests. However, following the recommendation of the American\r\nGas Service in France in December, 1917, no vincennite was ever\r\nmanufactured by the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nLACHRYMATORS\r\n\r\nAlmost simultaneously with the introduction of the gas wave attacks, in\r\nwhich liquefied gas under pressure was liberated from cylinders, came\r\nthe use of lachrymatory or tear gases. These, while not very poisonous\r\nin the concentrations used, were very effective in incapacitating men\r\nthrough the effects produced upon their eyes. The low concentration\r\nrequired (one part in ten million of some lachrymators is sufficient\r\nto make vision impossible without a mask) makes this form of gas\r\nwarfare very economical as well as very effective. Even if a mask\r\ndoes completely protect against such compounds, their use compels an\r\narmy to wear the mask indefinitely, with an expenditure of shell far\r\nshort of that required if the much more deadly gases were used. Thus\r\nFries estimates that one good lachrymatory shell will force wearing\r\nthe mask over an area that would require 500 to 1000 phosgene shell\r\nof equal size to produce the same effect. While the number of actual\r\ncasualties will be very much lower, the total effect considered from\r\nthe standpoint of the expenditure of ammunition and of the objectives\r\ngained, will be just as valuable. So great is the harassing value\r\nof tear and irritant gases that the next war will see them used in\r\nquantities approximating that of the more poisonous gases.\r\n\r\nThe first lachrymator used was a mixture of the chlorides and bromides\r\nof toluene. Benzyl chloride and bromide are the only valuable\r\nsubstances in this mixture, the higher halogenated products having\r\nlittle or no lachrymatory value. Xylyl bromide is also effective.\r\nChloroacetone and bromoacetone are also well known lachrymators, though\r\nthey are expensive to manufacture and are none too stable. Because of\r\nthis the French modified their preparation and obtained mixtures to\r\nwhich they gave the name “martonite.” This is a mixture of 80 per cent\r\nbromoacetone and 20 per cent chloroacetone, and can be made with nearly\r\ncomplete utilization of the halogen. Methyl ethyl ketone may also be\r\nused, which gives rise to the “homomartonite” of the French. During\r\nthe early part of the War, when bromine was so very expensive, the\r\nEnglish developed ethyl iodoacetate. This was used with or without the\r\naddition of alcohol. Later the French developed bromobenzyl cyanide,\r\nC₆H₅CH(Br)CN. This was probably the best lachrymator developed during\r\nthe War and put into large scale manufacture, though very little\r\nof it was available on the field of battle before the War ended.\r\nChloroacetophenone would have played an important part had the War\r\ncontinued.\r\n\r\n\r\nDISADVANTAGE OF WAVE ATTACKS\r\n\r\nAs will be discussed more fully in the chapters on “The Tactics of\r\nGas,” the wave attacks became relatively less important in 1916\r\nthrough the use of gas in artillery shell. This was the result of many\r\nfactors. Cloud gas attacks, as carried out under the old conditions,\r\nrequired a long time for the preliminary preparations, entailed a\r\ngreat deal of labor under the most difficult conditions, and were\r\ndangerous of execution even when weather conditions became suitable.\r\nThe difficulties may be summarized as follows:\r\n\r\n(1) The heavy gas cylinders used required a great deal of\r\ntransportation, and not only took the time of the Infantry but\r\nrendered surprise attacks difficult owing both to the time required\r\nand to the unusual activity behind the lines that became, with the\r\ndevelopment of aeroplanes, more and more readily discerned.\r\n\r\n(2) Few gases were available for wave attacks—chlorine, phosgene and,\r\nto a less extent, chloropicrin proving to be the only ones successfully\r\nused by either the Allies or the Germans. Hydrogen sulfide, carbon\r\nmonoxide and hydrocyanic acid gas were suggested and tried, but were\r\nabandoned for one reason or another.\r\n\r\n(3) Gas cloud attacks were wholly dependent upon weather conditions.\r\nNot only were the velocity and direction of the wind highly important\r\nas regards the successful carrying of the wave over the enemy’s line,\r\nbut also to prevent danger to the troops making the attack due to a\r\npossible shift of the wind, which would carry the gas back over their\r\nown line.\r\n\r\n(4) The use of gas in artillery shell does not require especially\r\ntrained troops inasmuch as gas shell are fired in the same manner as\r\nordinary shell, and by the same gun crews. Moreover, since artillery\r\ngas shell are used generally only for ranges of a mile or more, the\r\ndirection and velocity of the wind are of minor importance. Another\r\nfactor which adds to the advantage of artillery shell in certain cases\r\nis the ability to land high concentrations of gas suddenly upon a\r\ndistant target through employing a large number of the largest caliber\r\nguns available for firing gas.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the above named disadvantages of wave attacks it was\r\nfelt by the Americans from the beginning that successful gas cloud\r\nattacks were so fruitful in producing casualties and were such a strain\r\nupon those opposed to it, that they would continue. Furthermore, since\r\nartillery shell contain about 10 per cent gas, while gas cylinders may\r\ncontain 50 per cent, or even more of the total weight of the cylinder,\r\nthe efficiency of a cloud gas attack for at least the first mile of the\r\nenemy’s territory is far greater than that of the artillery gas attack.\r\nIt was accordingly felt that the only thing necessary to make cloud gas\r\nattacks highly useful and of frequent occurrence in the future was the\r\ndevelopment of mobile methods—methods whereby the gas attack could be\r\nlaunched on the surface of the ground and at short notice. For these\r\nreasons gas wave attacks may be expected to continue and to eventually\r\nreach a place of very decided importance in Chemical Warfare.\r\n\r\n\r\nGAS SHELL\r\n\r\nThe firing of gas in artillery shell and in bombs has another great\r\nadvantage over the wave attack just mentioned. There is a very great\r\nlatitude in the choice of those gases which have a high boiling point\r\nor which, at ordinary temperatures, are solids. Mustard gas is an\r\nexample of a liquid with a high boiling point, and diphenylchloroarsine\r\nan example of a gas that is ordinarily solid. For the above reason the\r\nterm “gas warfare” was almost a misnomer at the close of the War, and\r\ntoday is true only in the sense that all the substances used are in a\r\ngaseous or finely divided condition immediately after the shell explode\r\nor at least when they reach the enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROJECTOR ATTACKS\r\n\r\nStill another method of attack, developed by the British and first\r\nused by them in July, 1917, was the projector (invented by Captain\r\nLivens). This was used very successfully up to the close of the War,\r\nand though the German attempted to duplicate it, his results were never\r\nas effective. The projector consists of a steel tube of uniform cross\r\nsection, with an internal diameter of about 8 inches. By using nickel\r\nsteel the weight may be decreased until it is a one man load. The\r\nprojector was set against a pressed steel base plate (about 16 inches\r\nin diameter) placed in a very shallow trench.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.—Livens’ Projector.\r\n\r\nThe Type shown is an 18 cm. German Gas Projector, captured during the\r\n2d Battle of the Marne.]\r\n\r\nUntil about the close of the war projectors were installed by digging\r\na triangular trench deep enough to bring the muzzles of the projectors\r\nnearly level with the surface of the ground. They were then protected\r\nby sand bags or canvas covers, or camouflaged with wire netting to\r\nwhich colored bits of cloth were tied to simulate leaves and shadows.\r\nThe projectors were fired by connecting them in series with ordinary\r\nblasting machines operated by hand from a convenient point in the\r\nrear. The digging in of the projectors in No Man’s Land or very close\r\nto it was a dangerous and laborious undertaking. The Americans early\r\nconceived the idea that projectors could be fired just as accurately\r\nby digging a shallow trench just deep enough to form a support for\r\nthe base plate, and then supporting the outer ends of the projector\r\non crossed sticks or a light frame work of boards. This idea proved\r\nentirely practical except for one condition. It was found necessary to\r\nfire with a single battery all the projectors near enough together to\r\nbe disturbed by the blast from any portion of them. Inasmuch as most of\r\nthe blasting machines used for firing had a capacity of only 20 to 30\r\nprojectors, it was necessary to so greatly scatter a large projector\r\nattack that the method was very little used. However, investigations\r\nwere well under way at the close of the War to develop portable\r\nfiring batteries that would enable the discharge of at least 100 and\r\npreferably 500 projectors at one time. By this arrangement a projector\r\nattack could be prepared and launched in two to four hours, depending\r\nupon the number of men available. This enabled the attack to be decided\r\nupon in the evening (if the weather conditions were right), and to have\r\nthe attack launched before morning, thereby making it impossible for\r\naeroplane observers, armed with cameras, to discover the preparation\r\nfor the projector attack. Since the bombs used in the projector may\r\ncarry as high as 30 pounds of gas (usually phosgene), some idea of the\r\namount of destruction may be gained when it is known that the British\r\nfired nearly 2500 at one time into Lens.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTOKES’ MORTAR\r\n\r\nAnother British invention is the Stokes’ gun or trench mortar. The\r\nrange of this gun is about 800 to 1000 yards. It is therefore effective\r\nonly where the front lines are relatively close together. The shell\r\nconsists of a case containing the high explosive, smoke material or\r\ngas, fitted to a base filled with a high charge of propelling powder.\r\nThe shell is simply dropped into the gun. At the bottom of the gun\r\nthere is a projection or stud that strikes the primer, setting off\r\nthe small charge and expelling the projectile. In order to obtain any\r\nconsiderable concentration of gas in a particular locality, it is\r\nnecessary to fire the Stokes’ continuously (15 shots per minute being\r\npossible under battle conditions) for two to five minutes since the\r\nbomb contains only seven pounds of gas.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPERPALITE\r\n\r\nIt is believed that the first gas shell contained lachrymators or tear\r\ngases. Although the use of these shell continued up to and even after\r\nthe introduction of mustard gas, they gradually fell off in number—the\r\ntrue poison gas shell taking their place. Towards the end of 1915 Auld\r\nstates that the Germans were using chloromethyl chloroformate (palite)\r\nin shell. In 1916, during the battle of the Somme, palite was replaced\r\nby superpalite (trichloromethyl chloroformate, or diphosgene) which\r\nis more toxic than palite, and about as toxic as phosgene. It has the\r\nadvantage over phosgene of being much more persistent. In spite of the\r\nfact that American chemists were not able to manufacture superpalite\r\non a large scale, or at least so successfully that it would compete in\r\nprice with other war gases, the Germans used large quantities of it,\r\nalone and mixed with chloropicrin, in shell of every caliber up to and\r\nincluding the 15 cm. Howitzer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.—Stokes’ Mortar.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCHLOROPICRIN\r\n\r\nThe next gas to be introduced was chloropicrin, trichloronitromethane\r\nor “vomiting gas.” It has been stated that a mixture of chloropicrin\r\n(25 per cent) and chlorine (75 per cent) has been used in cloud\r\nattacks, but the high boiling point of chloropicrin (112° C.) makes its\r\nconsiderable use for this purpose very unlikely. The gas is moderately\r\ntoxic and somewhat lachrymatory, but it was mainly used because of\r\nits peculiar property of causing vomiting when inhaled. Its value was\r\nfurther increased at first because it was particularly difficult to\r\nprepare a charcoal which would absorb it. Its peculiar properties are\r\napt to cause it to be used for a long time.\r\n\r\n\r\nSNEEZING GAS\r\n\r\nDuring the summer of 1917 two new and very important gases were\r\nintroduced, and, as before, by the Germans. One of these was\r\ndiphenylchloroarsine, “sneezing gas” or “Blue Cross.” This is a white\r\nsolid which was placed in a bottle and embedded in TNT in the shell.\r\nUpon explosion of the shell the solid was atomized into very fine\r\nparticles. Since the ordinary mask does not remove smoke or mists,\r\nthe sneezing gas penetrates the mask and causes violent sneezing.\r\nThe purpose, of course, is to compel the removal of the mask in an\r\natmosphere of lethal gas. (The firing regulations prescribed its use\r\nwith phosgene or other lethal shell.) The latest type masks protect\r\nagainst this dust, but as it is extraordinarily powerful, its use will\r\ncontinue.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSTARD GAS\r\n\r\nThe second gas was dichloroethyl sulfide, mustard gas, Yellow Cross or\r\nYperite. Mustard gas, as it is commonly designated, is probably the\r\nmost important single poisonous substance used in gas warfare. It was\r\nfirst used by the Germans at Ypres, July 12, 1917. The amount of this\r\ngas used is illustrated by the fact that at Nieuport more than 50,000\r\nshell were fired in one night, some of which contained nearly three\r\ngallons of the liquid.\r\n\r\nMustard gas is a high boiling and very persistent material, which is\r\ncharacterized by its vesicant (skin blistering) action. Men who come in\r\ncontact with it, either in the form of fine splashes of the liquid or\r\nin the form of vapor, suffer severe blistering of the skin. The burns\r\nappear from four to twelve hours after exposure and heal very slowly.\r\nOrdinary clothing is no protection against either the vapor or the\r\nliquid. Other effects will be considered in Chapter IX.\r\n\r\nSince then there has been no important advance so far as new gases\r\nare concerned. Various arsenic derivatives were prepared in the\r\nlaboratory and tested on a small scale. The Germans did actually\r\nintroduce ethyldichloroarsine and the Americans were considering\r\nmethyldichloroarsine. Attempts were made to improve upon mustard gas\r\nbut they were not successful.\r\n\r\n\r\nLEWISITE\r\n\r\nIt is rather a peculiar fact that so few new chemical compounds were\r\nused as war gases. Practically all the substances were well known\r\nto the organic chemist long before the World War. One of the most\r\ninteresting and valuable of the compounds which would have found\r\nextensive use had the War continued, is an arsenic compound called\r\nLewisite from its discoverer, Capt. W. Lee Lewis, of Northwestern\r\nUniversity. The chemistry of this compound is discussed in Chapter X.\r\nBecause of the early recognized value of this compound, very careful\r\nsecrecy was maintained as to all details of the method of preparation\r\nand its properties. As a result, strange stories were circulated about\r\nits deadly powers. Characteristic of these was the story that appeared\r\nin the _New York Times_ early in 1919. Now that the English have\r\npublished the chemical and pharmacological properties, we can say that,\r\nalthough Lewisite was never proven on the battle field, laboratory\r\ntests indicate that we have here a very powerful agent. Not only is it\r\na vesicant of about the same order of mustard gas, but the arsenical\r\npenetrates the skin of an animal, and three drops, placed on the\r\nabdomen of a mouse, are sufficient to kill within two to three hours.\r\nIt is also a powerful respiratory irritant and causes violent sneezing.\r\nIts possible use in aeroplane bombs has led General Fries to apply the\r\nterm “The Dew of Death” to its use in this way.\r\n\r\n\r\nCAMOUFLAGE GASES\r\n\r\nConsiderable effort was spent on the question of camouflage gases. This\r\ninvolved two lines of research:\r\n\r\n(1) To prevent the recognition of a gas when actually present on the\r\nfield, by masking its odor.\r\n\r\n                                TABLE I\r\n                    CHEMICAL WARFARE GASES\r\n\r\n    ----------------------+-----------+--------------+------------------\r\n          Chemical        |Belligerent|   Effect     | Means of\r\n                          |           |              |    Projection\r\n    ----------------------+-----------+--------------+------------------\r\n    Acrolein              |  French   |Lachrymatory  |Hand grenades\r\n        (allylaldehyde)   |           |Lethal        |\r\n    Arsenic chloride      |           |(In mixtures. |\r\n                          |           |   See below) |\r\n    Benzyl iodide         |  French   |Lachrymatory  |Artillery shell\r\n    Benzyl chloride       |  French   |Lachrymatory  |Artillery shell\r\n                          |           |              |\r\n    Bromoacetone          |  French   |Lachrymatory  |Artillery shell\r\n                          |           |Lethal        |\r\n    Bromobenzylcyanide    |  French   |Lachrymatory  |Artillery shell\r\n    Bromomethylethylketone|  German   |Lachrymatory  |Artillery shell\r\n                          |           |Lethal        |Artillery shell\r\n                          |           |              |\r\n    Benzyl bromide        |  German   |Lachrymatory  |Artillery shell\r\n                          |  French   |              |\r\n    Chlorine              |  German   |Lethal        |Cylinders\r\n                          |  British  |              |    (cloud gas)\r\n                          |  French   |              |\r\n                          |  American |              |\r\n    Chlorosulfonic acid   |  German   |Irritant      |Hand grenades,\r\n                          |           |              | light minenwerfer\r\n    Chloroacetone         |  French   |Lachrymatory  |Artillery shell\r\n    Chlorobenzene         |  German   |Lachrymatory  |Artillery shell\r\n        (as solvent)      |           |              |\r\n    Chloropicrin          |  British  |Lethal        |Artillery shell\r\n                          |  French   |Lachrymatory  |Trench mortar\r\n                          |  German   |              |        bombs\r\n                          |  American |              |Projectors\r\n    Cyanogen bromide      |  Austrian | Lethal       |Artillery shell\r\n    Dichloromethylether   |  German   | Lachrymatory |Artillery shell\r\n       (as solvent)       |           |              |\r\n    Diphenylchloroarsine  |  German   | Sternutatory |Artillery shell\r\n                          |           | Lethal       |\r\n    Dichloroethylsulfide  |  German   | Vesicant     |Artillery shell\r\n                          |  French   | Lethal       |\r\n                          |  British  | Irritant     |\r\n                          |  American |              |\r\n                          |           |              |\r\n    Ethyldichloroarsine   |  German   | Lethal       |Artillery shell\r\n    Ethyliodoacetate      |  British  | Lachrymatory |Artillery shell,\r\n                          |           |              |4-in.

This may be done either by\r\nusing a substance whose odor in the field strongly suggests that of the\r\ngas in question, or by so thoroughly associating a totally different\r\nodor with a particular “gas” in normal use that, when used alone, it\r\nstill seems to imply the presence of that gas. This use of imitation\r\ngas would thus be of service in economizing the use of actual “gas” or\r\nin the preparation of surprise attacks.\r\n\r\nWhile there was some success with this kind of “gas,” very few such\r\nattacks were really carried out, and these were in connection with\r\nprojector attacks.\r\n\r\n\r\nGASES USED\r\n\r\nTable I gives a list of all the gases used by the various armies, the\r\nnation which used them, the effect produced and the means of projection\r\nused.\r\n\r\nTable II gives the properties of the more important war cases (compiled\r\nby Major R. E. Wilson, C. W. S.).\r\n\r\nThe gases used by the Germans may also be classified by the names\r\nof the shell in which they were used. Table III gives such a\r\nclassification.\r\n\r\n\r\nMARKINGS FOR AMERICAN SHELL\r\n\r\nIn selecting markings for American chemical shell, red bands were used\r\nto denote persistency, white bands to denote non-persistency and lethal\r\nproperties, yellow bands to denote smoke, and purple bands to denote\r\nincendiary action. The number of bands indicates the relative strength\r\nof the property indicated; thus, three red bands denote a gas more\r\npersistent than one red band.\r\n\r\nThe following shell markings were actually used:\r\n\r\n    1 White                    Diphenylchloroarsine\r\n    2 White                    Phosgene\r\n    1 White, 1 red             Chloropicrin\r\n    1 White, 1 red, 1 white    75% Chloropicrin, 25% Phosgene\r\n    1 White, 1 red, 1 yellow   80% Chloropicrin, 20% Stannic Chloride\r\n    1 Red                      Bromoacetone\r\n    2 Red                      Bromobenzylcyanide\r\n    3 Red                      Mustard Gas\r\n    1 Yellow                   White Phosphorus\r\n    2 Yellow                   Titanium Tetrachloride\r\n\r\n                              TABLE II\r\n\r\n          PHYSICAL CONSTANTS OF IMPORTANT WAR GASES\r\n    ----------------------+---------------+-----------+----------\r\n                          |               |           | Liquid\r\n                          |               |           | Density\r\n          Name of Gas     |    Formula    | Molecular | at 20° C.\r\n                          |               |  Weight   |  under\r\n                          |               |           |   Own\r\n                          |               |           | Pressure\r\n    ----------------------+---------------+-----------+----------\r\n    Bromoacetone          | C₃H₅BrO       |  136.98   | 1.7(?)\r\n    Carbon monoxide       | CO            |   28.00   | (Gas)\r\n    Cyanogen bromide      | BrCN          |  106.02   | 2.01\r\n    Cyanogen chloride     | ClCN          |   61.56   | 1.186\r\n    Chlorine              | Cl₂           |   70.92   | 1.408\r\n    Chloropicrin          | Cl₃C(NO₂)     |  164.39   | 1.654\r\n    Dichloroethyl sulfide | (CH₃CHCl₂)S   |  169.06   | 1.274\r\n    Diphenylchloroarsine  | (C₆H₅)₂AsCl   |  264.56   | 1.422\r\n    Hydrocyanic acid      | HCN           |   27.11   |  .697\r\n    Phenyldichloroarsine  | C₆H₅AsCl₂     |  210.96   | 1.640\r\n    Phosgene              | COCl₂         |   98.92   | 1.38\r\n    Stannic chloride      | SnCl₄         |  260.54   | 2.226\r\n    Superpalite           | CCl₃COOCl     |  197.85   | 1.65\r\n    Xylyl bromide         |( CH₃)C₆H₄CH₂Br|  185.03   | 1.381\r\n    ----------------------+---------------+-----------+-----------\r\n    ----------------------+---------+---------+----------\r\n                          |         |         |\r\n                          |         |         |  Vapor\r\n          Name of Gas     | Melting | Boiling | Pressure\r\n                          |  point, |  point, | at 20° C.\r\n                          |   °C.   |   °C.   | (mm.

Really, however, it\r\nmay be said to have started somewhat earlier, for Germany undoubtedly\r\nhad spent several months in perfecting a successful gas cylinder and a\r\nmethod of attack. The Allies, surprised by such a method of warfare,\r\nwere forced to develop, under pressure, a method of defense, and then,\r\nwhen it was finally decided to retaliate, a method of gas warfare.\r\n“Offensive organizations were enrolled in the Engineer Corps of the two\r\narmies and trained for the purpose of using poisonous gases; the first\r\noperation of this kind was carried out by the British at the battle of\r\nLoos in September, 1915.\r\n\r\n“Shortly after this the British Army in the field amalgamated all the\r\noffensive, defensive, advisory and supply activities connected with\r\ngas warfare and formed a ‘Gas Service’ with a Brigadier General as\r\nDirector. This step was taken almost as a matter of necessity, and\r\nbecause of the continually increasing importance of the use of gas in\r\nthe war (Auld).”\r\n\r\nAt once the accumulation of valuable information and experience was\r\nstarted. Later this was very willingly and freely placed at the\r\ndisposal of American workers. Too much cannot be said about the hearty\r\nco-operation of England and France. Without it and the later exchange\r\nof information on all matters regarding gas warfare, the progress of\r\ngas research in all the allied countries would have been very much\r\nretarded.\r\n\r\nWhile many branches of the American Army were engaged in following the\r\nprogress of the war during 1915-1916, the growing importance of gas\r\nwarfare was far from being appreciated. When the United States declared\r\nwar on Germany April 6, 1917, there were a few scattered observations\r\non gas warfare in various offices of the different branches, but there\r\nwas no attempt at an organized survey of the field, while absolutely no\r\neffort had been made by the War Department to inaugurate research in\r\na field that later had 2,000 men alone in pure research work. Equally\r\nimportant was the fact that no branch of the Service had any idea of\r\nthe practical methods of gas warfare.\r\n\r\nThe only man who seemed to have the vision and the courage of his\r\nconvictions was Van H. Manning, Director of the Bureau of Mines. Since\r\nthe establishment of the Bureau in 1908 it had maintained a staff\r\nof investigators studying poisonous and explosive gases in mines,\r\nthe use of self-contained breathing apparatus for exploring mines\r\nfilled with noxious gases, the treatment of men overcome by gas, and\r\nsimilar problems. At a conference of the Director of the Bureau with\r\nhis Division Chiefs, on February 7, 1917, the matter of national\r\npreparedness was discussed, and especially the manner in which the\r\nBureau could be of most immediate assistance with its personnel and\r\nequipment. On February 8, the Director wrote C. D. Walcott, Chairman\r\nof the Military Committee of the National Research Council, pointing\r\nout that the Bureau of Mines could immediately assist the Navy and\r\nthe Army in developing, for naval or military use, special oxygen\r\nbreathing apparatus similar to that used in mining. He also stated that\r\nthe Bureau could be of aid in testing types of gas masks used on the\r\nfighting lines, and had available testing galleries at the Pittsburgh\r\nexperiment station and an experienced staff. Dr. Walcott replied on\r\nFebruary 12 that he was bringing the matter to the attention of the\r\nMilitary Committee.\r\n\r\nA meeting was arranged between the Bureau and the War College, the\r\nlatter organization being represented by Brigadier General Kuhn\r\nand Major L. P. Williamson. At this conference the War Department\r\nenthusiastically accepted the offer of the Bureau of Mines and agreed\r\nto support the work in every way possible.\r\n\r\nThe supervision of the research on gases was offered to Dr. G. A.\r\nBurrell, for a number of years in charge of the chemical work done by\r\nthe Bureau in connection with the investigation of mine gases and\r\nnatural gas. He accepted the offer on April 7, 1917. The smoothness\r\nwith which the work progressed under his direction and the importance\r\nof the results obtained were the result of Colonel Burrell’s great\r\ntact, his knowledge of every branch of research under investigation and\r\nhis imagination and general broad-mindedness.\r\n\r\nOnce, however, that the importance of gas warfare had been brought to\r\nthe attention of the chemists of the country, the response was very\r\neager and soon many of the best men of the university and industrial\r\nplants were associated with Burrell in all the phases of gas research.\r\nThe staff grew very rapidly and laboratories were started at various\r\npoints in the East and Middle West.\r\n\r\nIt was immediately evident that there should be a central laboratory\r\nin Washington to co-ordinate the various activities and also to\r\nconsiderably enlarge those activities under the joint direction of\r\nthe Army, the Navy and the Bureau of Mines. Fortunately a site was\r\navailable for such a laboratory at the American University, the use\r\nof the buildings and grounds having been tendered President Wilson on\r\nApril 30, 1917. Thus originated the American University Experiment\r\nStation, later to become the Research Division of the Chemical Warfare\r\nService.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile other organizations were getting under way. The procurement\r\nof toxic gases and the filling of shell was assigned to the Trench\r\nWarfare Section of the Ordnance Department. In June, 1917, General\r\nCrozier, then Chief of the Ordnance Department, approved the general\r\nproposition of building a suitable plant for filling shell with toxic\r\ngas. In November, 1917, it was decided to establish such a plant at\r\nGunpowder Neck, Maryland. Owing to the inability of the chemical\r\nmanufacturers to supply the necessary toxic gases, it was further\r\ndecided, in December, 1917, to erect at the same place such chemical\r\nplants as would be necessary to supply these gases. In January, 1918,\r\nthe name was changed to Edgewood Arsenal, and the project was made a\r\nseparate Bureau of the Ordnance Department, Col. William H. Walker, of\r\nthe Massachusetts Institute of Technology, being soon afterwards put in\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nWhile, during the latter part of the War, gas shell were handled\r\nby the regular artillery, special troops were needed for cylinder\r\nattacks, Stokes’ mortars, Livens’ projectors and for other forms of gas\r\nwarfare. General Pershing early cabled, asking for the organization and\r\ntraining of such troops, and recommended that they be placed, as in the\r\nEnglish Army, under the jurisdiction of the Engineer Corps. On August\r\n15, 1917, the General Staff authorized one regiment of Gas and Flame\r\ntroops, which was designated the “30th Engineers,” and was commanded by\r\nMajor (later Colonel) E. J. Atkisson. This later became the First Gas\r\nRegiment, of the Chemical Warfare Service.\r\n\r\nAbout this time (September, 1917) the need of gas training was\r\nrecognized by the organization of a Field Training Section, under the\r\ndirection of the Sanitary Corps, Medical Department. Later it was\r\nrecognized that neither the Training Section nor the Divisional Gas\r\nOfficers should be under the Medical Department, and, in January, 1918,\r\nthe organization was transferred to the Engineer Corps.\r\n\r\nAll of these, with the exception of the Gas and Flame regiment, were\r\nfor service on this side. The need for an Overseas force was recognized\r\nand definitely stated in a letter, dated August 4, 1917. On September\r\n3, 1917, an order was issued establishing the Gas Service, under\r\nthe command of Lt. Col. (later Brigadier General) A. A. Fries, as a\r\nseparate Department of the A. E. F. in France. In spite of a cable on\r\nSeptember 26th, in which General Pershing had said\r\n\r\n    “Send at once chemical laboratory, complete\r\n    equipment and personnel, including physiological and\r\n    pathological sections, for extensive investigation of\r\n    gases and powders....”\r\n\r\nit was not until the first of January, 1918, that Colonel R. F. Bacon\r\nof the Mellon Institute sailed for France with about fifty men and a\r\ncomplete laboratory equipment.\r\n\r\nMeantime a Chemical Service Section had been organized in the United\r\nStates. This holds the distinction of being the first recognition of\r\nchemistry as a separate branch of the military service in any country\r\nor any war. This was authorized October 16, 1917, and was to consist\r\nof an officer of the Engineers, not above the rank of colonel, who was\r\nto be Director of Gas Service, with assistants, not above the rank of\r\nlieutenant colonel from the Ordnance Department, Medical Department\r\nand Chemical Service Section. The Section itself was to consist of 47\r\ncommissioned and 95 non-commissioned officers and privates. Colonel C.\r\nL. Potter, Corps of Engineers, was appointed Director and Professor\r\nW. H. Walker was commissioned Lieutenant Colonel and made Assistant\r\nDirector of the Gas Service and Chief of the Chemical Service Section.\r\nThis was increased on Feb. 15, 1918 to 227 commissioned and 625\r\nenlisted men, and on May 6, 1918 to 393 commissioned and 920 enlisted\r\nmen. Meanwhile Lt. Col. Walker had been transferred to the Ordnance and\r\nLt. Col. Bogert had been appointed in his place.\r\n\r\nAt this time practically every branch of the Army had some connection\r\nwith Gas Warfare. The Medical Corps directed the Gas Defense\r\nproduction. Offense production was in the hands of the Ordnance\r\nDepartment. Alarm devices, etc., were made by the Signal Corps. The\r\nEngineers contributed their 30th Regiment (Gas and Flame) and the Field\r\nTraining Section. The Research Section was still in charge of the\r\nBureau of Mines, in spite of repeated attempts to militarize it. And\r\nin addition, the Chemical Service Section had been formed primarily\r\nto deal with overseas work. While the Director of the Gas Service was\r\nexpected to co-ordinate all these activities, he was given no authority\r\nto control policy, research or production.\r\n\r\nIn order to improve these conditions Major General Wm. L. Sibert, a\r\ndistinguished Engineer Officer who built the Gatun Locks and Dam of the\r\nPanama Canal and who had commanded the First Division in France, was\r\nappointed Director of the Chemical Warfare Service on May 11, 1918.\r\nUnder his direction the Chemical Warfare Service was organized with the\r\nfollowing Divisions:\r\n\r\n    Overseas                   Brigadier General Amos A. Fries\r\n    Research                   Colonel G. A. Burrell\r\n    Development                Colonel F. M. Dorsey\r\n    Gas Defense Production     Colonel Bradley Dewey\r\n    Gas Offense Production     Colonel Wm. H. Walker\r\n    Medical                    Colonel W. J. Lyster\r\n    Proving                    Lt. Col. W. S. Bacon\r\n    Administration             Brigadier General H. C. Newcomer\r\n    Gas and Flame              Colonel E. J. Atkisson\r\n\r\nThe final personnel authorized, though never reached owing to the\r\nsigning of the Armistice, was 4,066 commissioned officers and 44,615\r\nenlisted men; this was including three gas regiments of eighteen\r\ncompanies each.\r\n\r\nGeneral Sibert brought with him not only an extended experience in\r\norganizing and conducting big business, but a strong sympathy for the\r\nwork and an appreciation of the problem that the American Army was\r\nfacing in France. He very quickly welded the great organization of\r\nthe Chemical Warfare Service into a whole, and saw to it that each\r\ndepartment not only carried on its own duties but co-operated with\r\nthe others in carrying out the larger program, which, had the war\r\ncontinued, would have beaten the German at his own game.\r\n\r\nMore detailed accounts will now be given of the various Divisions of\r\nthe Chemical Warfare Service.\r\n\r\n\r\nADMINISTRATION DIVISION\r\n\r\nThe Administration Division was the result of the development which has\r\nbeen sketched in the preceding pages. It is not necessary to review\r\nthat, but the organization as of October 19, 1918 will be given:\r\n\r\n    Director                            Major General Wm. L. Sibert\r\n    Staff:\r\n      Medical Officer                   Colonel W. J. Lyster\r\n      Ordnance Officer                  Lt. Col. C. B. Thummel\r\n      British Military Mission          Major J. H. Brightman\r\n    Assistant Director                  Colonel H. C. Newcomer\r\n    Office Administration               Major W. W. Parker\r\n    Relations Section                   Colonel M. T. Bogert\r\n    Personnel Section                   Major F. E. Breithut\r\n    Contracts and Patents Section       Captain W. K. Jackson\r\n    Finance Section                     Major C. C. Coombs\r\n    Requirements and Progress Section   Capt. S. M. Cadwell\r\n    Confidential Information Section    Major S. P. Mullikin\r\n    Transportation Section              Captain H. B. Sharkey\r\n    Training Section                    Lt. Col. G. N. Lewis\r\n    Procurement Section                 Lt. Col. W. J. Noonan\r\n\r\nThe administrative offices were located in the Medical Department\r\nBuilding. The function of most of the sections is indicated by their\r\nnames.\r\n\r\nThe Industrial Relations Section was created to care for the interests\r\nof the industrial plants which were considered as essential war\r\nindustries. Through its activity many vitally important industries\r\nwere enabled to retain, on deferred classification or on indefinite\r\nfurlough, those skilled chemists without which they could not have\r\nmaintained a maximum output of war munitions.\r\n\r\nIn the same way the University Relations Section cared for the\r\neducational and research institutions. In this way our recruiting\r\nstations for chemists were kept in as active operation as war\r\nconditions permitted.\r\n\r\nAnother important achievement of the Administration Section was to\r\nsecure the order from The Adjutant General, dated May 28, 1918, that\r\nread:\r\n\r\n    “Owing to the needs of the military service for a\r\n    great many men trained in chemistry, it is considered\r\n    most important that all enlisted men who are graduate\r\n    chemists should be assigned to duty where their\r\n    special knowledge and training can be fully utilized.\r\n\r\n     *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n    “Enlisted men who are graduate chemists will not\r\n    be sent overseas unless they are to be employed on\r\n    chemical duties....”\r\n\r\nWhile this undoubtedly created a great deal of feeling among the men\r\nwho naturally were anxious to see actual fighting in France, it was\r\nvery important that this order be carried out in order to conserve our\r\nchemical strength. The following clipping from the September, 1918,\r\nissue of _The Journal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry_ shows\r\nthe result of this order.\r\n\r\n\r\n“CHEMISTS IN CAMP\r\n\r\n    “As the result of the letter from The Adjutant General\r\n    of the Army, dated May 28, 1918, 1,749 chemists have\r\n    been reported on. Of these the report of action to\r\n    August 1, 1918, shows that 281 were ordered to remain\r\n    with their military organization because they were\r\n    already performing chemical duties, 34 were requested\r\n    to remain with their military organization because they\r\n    were more useful in the military work which they were\r\n    doing, 12 were furloughed back to industry, 165 were\r\n    not chemists in the true sense of the word and were,\r\n    therefore, ordered back to the line, and 1,294 now\r\n    placed in actual chemical work. There were being held\r\n    for further investigation of their qualifications on\r\n    August 1, 1918, 432 men. The remaining 23 men were\r\n    unavailable for transfer, because they had already\r\n    received their overseas orders.\r\n\r\n    “The 1,294 men, who would otherwise be serving in a\r\n    purely military capacity and whose chemical training is\r\n    now being utilized in chemical work, have, therefore,\r\n    been saved from waste.\r\n\r\n    “Each case has been considered individually, the man’s\r\n    qualifications and experience have been studied with\r\n    care, the needs of the Government plants and bureaus\r\n    have been considered with equal care, and each man has\r\n    been assigned to the position for which his training\r\n    and qualifications seem to fit him best.\r\n\r\n    “Undoubtedly, there have been some cases in which\r\n    square pegs have been fitted into round holes, but, on\r\n    the whole, it is felt that the adjustments have been as\r\n    well as could be expected under the circumstances.”\r\n\r\n\r\nRESEARCH DIVISION\r\n\r\nThe American University Experiment Station, established by the Bureau\r\nof Mines in April, 1917, became July 1, 1918 the Research Division\r\nof the Chemical Warfare Service. For the first five months work was\r\ncarried out in various laboratories, scattered over the country. In\r\nSeptember, 1917, the buildings of the American University became\r\navailable; a little later portions of the new chemical laboratory\r\nof the Catholic University, Washington, were taken over. Branch\r\nlaboratories were established in many of the laboratories of the\r\nUniversities and industrial plants, of which Johns Hopkins, Princeton,\r\nYale, Ohio State, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Harvard,\r\nMichigan, Columbia, Cornell, Wisconsin, Clark, Bryn Mawr, Nela Park and\r\nthe National Carbon Company were active all through the war.\r\n\r\nAt the time of the signing of the armistice the organization of the\r\nResearch Division was as follows:\r\n\r\n    Col. G. A. Burrell       Chief of Research Division\r\n    Dr. W. K. Lewis          In Charge of Defense Problems\r\n    Dr. E. P.

Marshall in charge of Pharmacological Research. About May 1,\r\n1918, Pharmacological Research became so extensive that the Section\r\nwas made into two, with Marshall and Loevenhart in charge, while Dr.\r\nHunt was appointed special adviser on pharmacological problems. When\r\nthe transfer to the War Department was made, Henderson, Underhill,\r\nWinternitz and Marshall were transferred to the Medical Division.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Lt. Col. McPherson was formerly in charge, and was later\r\ntransferred to Ordnance.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: This Section was originally under H. H. Clark. Later\r\nit was split into two, with Clark and Fogler in charge, and finally\r\nconsolidated under Fogler.] The chief functions of the Research\r\nDivision were:\r\n\r\n1. To prepare and test compounds which might be of value in gas\r\nwarfare, determining the properties of these substances and the\r\nconditions under which they might be effective in warfare.\r\n\r\n2. To develop satisfactory methods of making such compounds as seemed\r\npromising (Small Scale).\r\n\r\n3. To develop the best methods of utilizing these compounds.\r\n\r\n4. To develop materials which should absorb or destroy war gases,\r\nstudying their properties and determining the conditions under which\r\nthey might be effective.\r\n\r\n5. To develop satisfactory methods of making such absorbents as might\r\nseem promising.\r\n\r\n6. To develop masks, canisters, protective clothing, etc.\r\n\r\n7. To develop incendiaries, smokes, signals, etc., and the best methods\r\nof using the same.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.—American University Experiment Station, showing\r\nSmall Scale Plants.]\r\n\r\n8. To co-operate with the manufacturing divisions in regard to\r\ndifficulties arising during the operations of manufacturing war gases,\r\nabsorbents, etc.\r\n\r\n9. To co-operate with other branches of the Government, civil and\r\nmilitary, in regard to war problems.\r\n\r\n10. To collect and make available to the Director of the Chemical\r\nWarfare Service all information in regard to the chemistry of gas\r\nwarfare.\r\n\r\nThe relation of the various sections may best be shown by outlining the\r\ngeneral procedure used when a new toxic substance was developed.\r\n\r\nThe substance in question may have been used by the Germans or the\r\nAllies; it may have been suggested by someone outside the station; or\r\nthe staff may have thought of it from a search of the literature, from\r\nanalogy or from pure inspiration. The Offense Research Section made the\r\nsubstance. If it was a solid it was sent to the Dispersoid Section,\r\nwhere methods of dispersing it were worked out. When this had been\r\ndone, or, at once, if the compound was a liquid or vapor, it was sent\r\nto the Toxicological Section to be tested for toxicity, lachrymatory\r\npower, vesicant action, or other special properties. If these tests\r\nproved the compound to have a high toxicity or a peculiar physiological\r\nbehavior, it was then turned over to a number of different sections.\r\n\r\nThe Offense Research Section tried to improve the method of\r\npreparation. When a satisfactory method had been found, the Chemical\r\nProduction or Small Scale Manufacturing Section endeavored to make it\r\non a large scale (50 pounds to a ton) and worked out the manufacturing\r\ndifficulties. If further tests showed that the substance was valuable,\r\nthe manufacture was then given to the Development Division or the Gas\r\nOffense Production Division for large scale production.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Analytical Section had been working on a method for\r\ntesting the purity of the material and for analyzing air mixtures,\r\nand the Gas Mask Section had run tests against it with the standard\r\ncanisters. If the protection afforded did not seem sufficient, the\r\nDefense Chemical Section studied changes in the ingredients of the\r\ncanister or even developed a new absorbent or mixture of absorbents to\r\nmeet the emergency. If a change in the mechanical construction of the\r\ncanister was necessary, this was referred to the Mechanical Research\r\nSection; this work was especially important in case the material was to\r\nbe used as a toxic smoke.\r\n\r\nThe compound was also sent to the Pyrotechnic Section, which studied\r\nits behavior when fired from a shell, or, if suitable, when used in a\r\ncylinder. If it proved stable on detonation, large field tests were\r\nthen made by the Proving Division, in connection with the Pyrotechnic\r\nand Toxicological Sections of the Research Division, to learn the\r\neffect when shell loaded with the compound were fired from guns on\r\na range, with animals placed suitably in or near the trenches. The\r\nAnalytical Section worked out methods of detecting the gas in the\r\nfield, wherever possible.\r\n\r\nThe Medical Division, working with the Toxicological and\r\nPharmacological Sections, studied pathological details, methods of\r\ntreating gassed cases, the effect of the gas on the body, and in some\r\ncases even considered other questions, such as the susceptibility of\r\ndifferent men.\r\n\r\nIf the question of an ointment or clothing entered into the matter\r\nof protection, these were usually attacked by several Sections from\r\ndifferent points of view.\r\n\r\nOut of the 250 gases prepared by the Offense Chemical Research Section,\r\nvery few were sufficiently valuable to pass all of these tests and\r\nthus the number of gases actually put into large scale production were\r\nless than a dozen. This had its advantages, for it made unnecessary a\r\nlarge number of factories and the training of men in the manufacturing\r\ndetails of many gases. As one British report stated, “The ultimate\r\nobject of chemical warfare should be to produce two substances only;\r\none persistent and the other non-persistent; both should be lethal and\r\nboth should be penetrants.” They might well have added that both should\r\nbe instantly and powerfully lachrymatory.\r\n\r\nSince most of the work of the Research Division will be covered in\r\ndetail in later chapters, only a brief summary of the principal\r\nproblems will be given here.\r\n\r\nThe first and most important problem was the development of a gas mask.\r\nThis was before Sections had been organized and was the work of the\r\nentire Division. After comparing the existing types of masks it was\r\ndecided that the Standard Box Respirator of the British was the best\r\none to copy. Because we were entirely new at the game that meant work\r\non charcoal, soda-lime, and the various mechanical parts of the mask,\r\nsuch as the facepiece, elastics, eyepieces, mouthpiece, noseclip, hose,\r\ncan, valves, etc. The story of the “first twenty thousand” is very well\r\ntold by Colonel Burrell.[12]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: _J. Ind. Eng. Chem._, =11=, 93 (1919).]\r\n\r\n\r\n              “THE FIRST TWENTY THOUSAND\r\n\r\n    “About the first of May, 1917, Major L. P. Williamson,\r\n    acting as liaison officer between the Bureau of\r\n    Mines and the War Department, put the last ounce of\r\n    ‘pep’ into the organization by asking us to build\r\n    20,000 gas masks for shipment overseas. 20,000 masks\r\n    did not seem like a very large order. We did not\r\n    fully appreciate all the conditions which a war gas\r\n    mask had to encounter, so we readily and willingly\r\n    accepted the order. Then began a struggle with can\r\n    manufacturers, buckle makers, manufacturers of straps,\r\n    rubber facepieces, eyepieces, knapsacks, etc. The\r\n    country was canvassed from the Atlantic Coast to the\r\n    Mississippi River for manufacturers who could turn out\r\n    the different parts acceptably and in a hurry.\r\n\r\n    “Charcoal was made from red cedar by the Day Chemical\r\n    Co. of Westline, Pennsylvania; soda-lime permanganate\r\n    was manufactured by the General Chemical Company;\r\n    knapsacks by the Simmons Hardware Company in St.\r\n    Louis; facepieces by the Goodrich and Goodyear Rubber\r\n    Companies at Akron; canisters by the American Can\r\n    Company; and the assembly made at one of the plants of\r\n    the American Can Company in Long Island City.\r\n\r\n    “The writer cannot recall all the doubts, fears,\r\n    optimism, and enthusiasm felt in turn by different\r\n    members of the organization during the fabrication\r\n    of those first 20,000 masks. We were performing an\r\n    important task for the War Department. Night became\r\n    day. Dewey, Lewis, Henderson, Gibbs, and others stepped\r\n    from one train to another, and we used the telephone\r\n    between Washington and St. Louis or Boston as freely as\r\n    we used the local Washington telephone.\r\n\r\n    “We thought we could improve on the English box\r\n    respirator on various points. We made the canister\r\n    larger, and have been glad ever since that we did.\r\n    We thought the English mouthpiece was too flexible\r\n    and too small, and made ours stiff and larger, and\r\n    were sorry we made the change. We tested the fillings\r\n    against chlorine, phosgene, prussic acid, etc., and\r\n    had a canister that was all that was desired for\r\n    absorbing these gases. But, alas, we did not know\r\n    that chloropicrin was destined to be one of the most\r\n    important war gases used by the various belligerents.\r\n    Further, it was not fully appreciated that the\r\n    rubberized cloth used in making the facepiece had to\r\n    be highly impermeable against gases, that hardness as\r\n    much as anything else was desired in the make-up of\r\n    the soda-lime granules in order to withstand rough\r\n    jolting so that the fines would not clog the canister,\r\n    and raise the resistance to breathing to a prohibitive\r\n    figure. Neither was it appreciated at that time by any\r\n    of the allies, that the gas mask really should be a\r\n    be a fighting instrument, one that men could work hard\r\n    in, run in, and wear for hours, without too serious\r\n    discomfort.\r\n\r\n    “The first 20,000 masks sent over to England were\r\n    completed by the Research Division in record time.\r\n    As compared with the French masks, they were far\r\n    superior, giving greater protection against chlorine,\r\n    phosgene, superpalite, prussic acid, xylyl bromide,\r\n    etc. The French mask was of the cloth type, conforming\r\n    to the face, and consisting of twenty layers of\r\n    cheesecloth impregnated with sodium phenate and\r\n    hexamethylenetetramine. Chloropicrin went through this\r\n    like a shot. Just before the masks were sent abroad,\r\n    we received disturbing rumors of the contemplated\r\n    use of large quantities of chloropicrin. The French,\r\n    apparently, had no intention of changing the design\r\n    of their mask, and did not do so for months to come.\r\n    We therefore released the masks, they were sent\r\n    abroad, and an anxious research group on this side\r\n    of the water waited expectantly for the verdict. It\r\n    came. A brief cablegram told us what our English\r\n    cousins thought of us. It was a subject they had been\r\n    wrestling with for two years and a half. They had had\r\n    battlefield experience; they had gone through the grief\r\n    of developing poor masks into better ones, knew the\r\n    story better than we did, and after a thorough test\r\n    ‘hammered’ the American design unmercifully.\r\n\r\n    “This experience put the Research Division on its\r\n    mettle. Our first attempt had given us the necessary\r\n    preliminary experience; cablegrams and reports traveled\r\n    back and forth; an expert or two eventually came to\r\n    this country from England in response to previous\r\n    appeals for assistance, and we turned with adequate\r\n    information to the development of a real mask.”\r\n\r\nThe story of mustard gas is given later. It probably occupied more time\r\nand thought on the part of the Research Division, as well as that of\r\nEdgewood Arsenal and the Development Division, than any other gas.\r\n\r\nDiphenylchloroarsine led to the preparation of a series of arsenic\r\ncompounds, some more easily prepared and more or less effective.\r\n\r\nCyanogen chloride and cyanogen bromide, reported by the Italians as\r\nhaving been used by the Germans, were extensively studied.\r\n\r\nThe Inorganic Section was early interested in special incendiary\r\nmaterials which were developed for bombs, shells, darts and grenades,\r\nand which were later taken over by the Pyrotechnic Section, and finally\r\nadopted by the Ordnance Department.\r\n\r\nIn discussing the work one can very well start with the Offense\r\nSection. This Section had two aims in view always, to develop methods\r\nof making the gases used by the Germans more economically than they\r\nwere making them, and to develop better gases if possible. When we\r\nentered the war, chlorine, phosgene and chloropicrin were the lethal\r\ngases used, while bromoacetone and xylyl bromide were the lachrymators.\r\nIt was not a difficult matter to prepare these. But the introduction\r\nof mustard gas in the summer of 1917 and of diphenylchloroarsine in\r\nthe autumn of the same year, not only made our chemists ponder over\r\na manufacturing method, but also so revised our notions of warfare\r\nthat the possibility of using other substances created the need for\r\nextensive research. The development of bromobenzylcyanide by the French\r\nlikewise opened a new field among lachrymatory substances.\r\n\r\nColored rockets and smokes were developed for the Navy and Army.\r\nThe smoke box was also studied but the work was taken over by the\r\nPyrotechnic Section.\r\n\r\nA large amount of pure inorganic research on arsine and arsenides,\r\nfluorine, hydrofluoric acid and fluorides, cyanides, cyanogen sulfide\r\nand nitrogen tetroxide was carried out, sometimes successfully and at\r\nother times with little or no success.\r\n\r\nThe Analytical Section not only carried out all routine analyses but\r\ndeveloped methods for many new gases.\r\n\r\nThe Offense Section worked in very close contact with the Small Scale\r\nManufacturing Section (Chemical Production Section). Often it happened\r\nthat a method, apparently successful in the laboratory, was of no\r\nvalue in the plant. Small scale plants were developed for mustard gas,\r\nhydrocyanic acid, cyanogen chloride, arsenic trichloride, arsenic\r\ntrifluoride, magnesium arsenide, superpalite and bromobenzylcyanide.\r\n\r\nThe Chemical Defense Section, organized January, 1918, was occupied\r\nwith problems relating to protection, such as charcoal, soda-lime, and\r\nspecial absorbents, eyepieces, smoke filters, efficiency of absorbents,\r\nand special work with mustard gas.\r\n\r\nCharcoal demanded extensive research. Raw materials required a\r\nworld-wide search, carbonizing methods had to be developed, and\r\nimpregnating agents were thoroughly studied. This story is told in\r\nChapter XIII.\r\n\r\nSoda-lime was likewise a difficult problem. Starting with the British\r\nformula, the influence of the various factors was studied and a balance\r\nbetween a number of desirable qualities, absorptive activity, capacity,\r\nhardness, resistance to abrasion, chemical stability, etc., obtained.\r\nThe final product consisted of a mixture of lime, cement, kieselguhr,\r\nsodium permanganate and sodium hydroxide.\r\n\r\nEqually valuable work was performed in the perfection of two carbon\r\nmonoxide absorbents for the Navy. The better of these consisted of a\r\nmixture of suitably prepared oxides which acts catalytically under\r\ncertain conditions, and causes the carbon monoxide to react with the\r\noxygen of the air. Since there are color changes connected with the\r\niodine pentoxide reaction (the first absorbent) it has been possible\r\nto develop this so as to serve as a very sensitive detector for the\r\npresence of carbon monoxide in air.\r\n\r\nWhile the question of smoke filters was so important that it occupied\r\nthe attention of several Sections, the Defense Section developed, as a\r\npart of its work, a standard method of testing and comparing filters,\r\nand did a great deal of work on the preparation of paper for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nVarious problems related to mustard gas were also studied. The question\r\nof a protective ointment was solved as successfully as possible under\r\nthe circumstances, but was dropped when it appeared doubtful if under\r\nbattlefield conditions of concentration and length of exposure, any\r\nointment offered sufficient protection to pay for the trouble of\r\napplying it. The removal of mustard gas from clothing was investigated,\r\nespecially by the accelerating effect of turkey red oil. Another phase\r\nof the work concerned the destruction of mustard gas on the ground,\r\nwhile a fourth phase related to the persistency of mustard (and other\r\ngases) on the field of battle.\r\n\r\nThe Gas Mask Research Section concerned itself largely with developing\r\nmethods of testing canisters and with routine tests. When one\r\nconsiders the number of gases studied experimentally, the large\r\nnumber of experimental canisters developed, all of which were tested\r\nagainst two or more gases, and further that the Section assisted in the\r\ncontrol of the production at Long Island City, it is seen that this\r\nwas no small job. In addition, the effect of various conditions, such\r\nas temperature, humidity, ageing, size of particles, were studied in\r\ntheir relation to the life of absorbents and canisters. Man tests and\r\nmechanical tests will be discussed in a later chapter. Other studies\r\nwere concerned with weathering tests of gas mask fabrics, mustard gas\r\ndetector, and covering for dugout entrances (dugout blankets), which\r\nwere impregnated with a mixture of mineral and vegetable oils. In\r\nstudying the course of gases through a canister the “wave front” method\r\nwas of great value in detecting defects in canister design and filling.\r\n\r\nThe Pyrotechnic Section was composed of a number of units, each with\r\nits own problem. The gas shell was studied, with special reference\r\nto the stability of gases and toxic solids, both on storage and on\r\ndetonation. Extensive work was carried out on smoke screens—a Navy\r\nfunnel, an Army portable smoke apparatus, using silicon tetrachloride,\r\na grenade, a Livens, and various shell being developed for that\r\npurpose. The smoke screen was adapted to the tank and the airplane as\r\nwell as to the funnel of a ship. Several types of incendiary bombs\r\nand darts were perfected. The liquid fire gun was studied but the\r\nresults were never utilized because of the abandonment as useless of\r\nthat form of warfare. Various forms of signal lights, flares, rockets\r\nand colored smokes were studied and in most cases specifications were\r\nwritten. Extensive studies were also carried out on gas shell linings,\r\nfrom which a lead and an enamel lining were evolved. Many physical\r\nproperties of war gases and their mixtures were determined.\r\n\r\nThe Dispersoid Section studied the production of smokes or mists from\r\nvarious solid and liquid substances. Apparatus were developed to study\r\nthe concentration of smoke clouds and their rate of settling. The\r\nefficiency of various filters and canisters was determined, and among\r\nother things, a new smoke candle was perfected.\r\n\r\nMechanical research at first was related to design and construction of\r\na canister and mask, based on the English type. During the latter part\r\nof 1917 the Tissot type of mask was studied and then turned over to\r\nthe Gas Defense Division. A Navy Head Mask and canister was perfected.\r\nThe horse mask was developed along the lines of the British type, and\r\nalso a dog mask of the same general nature. Horse boots were also\r\nconstructed, though they never were used at the front. Many Ordnance\r\nand Pyrotechnic problems were also successfully completed, not the\r\nleast of which was a noiseless gas cylinder. This section developed the\r\nfirst special poison gas suit, composed of an oilcloth suit, a mask and\r\nhelmet and a special canister.\r\n\r\nThe Manufacturing Development Section had general charge of the defense\r\nproblems, and really acted as an emergency section, filling in as\r\noccasion demanded. They developed mustard gas clothing and a horse\r\nmask. They constructed a hydrogen plant at Langley Field, assisted in\r\nsolving the difficulties relating to Batchite charcoal at Springfield,\r\nMass., and co-operated in the study of paper and felt as filtering\r\nmaterials for smokes. Towards the close of the war the Section was\r\ninterested in the application of the gas mask to the industries.\r\n\r\nThe Physiological work is discussed under the Medical Division.\r\n\r\nThe Editorial Section received reports from all the other Sections,\r\nfrom which a semi-monthly report was written, and distributed to\r\nauthorized representatives of the Army and Navy and to our Allies.\r\nReports were also received from abroad and the information thus\r\nreceived was made available to the Research Division. As the number of\r\nreports increased the work was collected together into monographs on\r\nthe various war gases, absorbents, smokes, etc. After the signing of\r\nthe armistice these were revised and increased in number, so that about\r\nfifty were finally turned over to the Director of the Chemical Warfare\r\nService.\r\n\r\n\r\nGAS DEFENSE DIVISION\r\n\r\nThe story of the Gas Defense Division is largely the story of the\r\ngas mask. Colonel (then Mr.) Bradley Dewey was in charge of the\r\n“first twenty thousand.” Soon after that work was undertaken, he was\r\ncommissioned Major in the Gas Defense Division of the Sanitary Corps\r\nand was placed in charge of the entire manufacturing program. The work\r\nof the Division included the development and manufacture as well as the\r\ntesting and inspection of gas masks, and other defense equipment. The\r\nmagnitude of the work is seen from the following record of production:\r\n5,692,000 completed gas masks, 3,614,925 of which were produced at the\r\nLong Island City Plant, while the remainder were assembled at the Hero\r\nManufacturing Company’s Plant at Philadelphia, 377,881 horse masks,\r\n191,388 dugout blankets, 2,450 protective suits and 1,773 pairs of\r\ngloves, 1,246 tons of protective ointment, 45,906 gas warning signals\r\n(largely hand horns), 50,549 trench fans and many oxygen inhalators.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.—The Defective Gas Mask.\r\n\r\nSuccessfully used by the Gas Defense Division to stimulate care in\r\nevery part of the operation of the manufacture of Gas Masks.]\r\n\r\nThe story of the “first twenty thousand” has already been told on page\r\n43. That these masks were far from satisfactory is no reflection upon\r\nthe men who made them. Even with the standard design of the British as\r\na pattern, it was impossible to attain all the knowledge concerning gas\r\nmasks in two months. The experience gained in this struggle enabled\r\nthe Army to take up the manufacture of gas masks, in July, 1917, with\r\na more complete realization of the seriousness of the task. The masks\r\nwere not lost, either, for they were sent to the various camps as\r\ntraining masks and served a very useful purpose.\r\n\r\nThe first order after this was for 1,100,000 masks, to be completed\r\nwithin a year from date. For this production there was authorized\r\none major, two captains, and ten lieutenants. How little the problem\r\nwas understood is evident when we realize that in the end there were\r\n12,000 employees in the Gas Defense Plant at Long Island City, N. Y.\r\nThe first attempts were to secure these through existing concerns.\r\nThe Hero Manufacturing Company of Philadelphia undertook the work and\r\ncarried on certain portions of it all through the War. Experience soon\r\nshowed, however, that because of the necessity for extreme care in\r\nthe manufacture and inspection of the mask, the ordinary commercial\r\norganization was not adapted to carry on their manufacture on the scale\r\nnecessitated by the Army program. Consequently, on Nov. 21, 1917, the\r\nSecretary of War authorized the establishment of a government operated\r\nplant, and experienced officials were drawn from New York, Chicago,\r\nBoston and other manufacturing centers to carry on the work. Buildings\r\nin Long Island City, not far from the chemical plant (charcoal and soda\r\nlime) at Astoria, were taken over by the officers of the Gas Defense\r\nService, until in July, 1918, five large buildings were occupied,\r\nhaving a total floor space of 1,000,000 square feet (23 acres). The\r\norganization grew from the original thirteen officers until it included\r\nsome 12,000 employees of whom about 8,500 were women. Because of the\r\ncare required in all the work, attempt was made to secure, as far as\r\npossible, those who had relatives with the A. E. F. The thought was\r\nthat their personal interest in the work would result in greater care\r\nin manufacture and inspection. The personnel was unique in that the\r\nauthority was apparently divided between civilian and military, but\r\nthere was no friction because of this. The efficiency of the entire\r\norganization is shown by the fact that the masks manufactured at Long\r\nIsland City cost fifty cents less per mask than those manufactured\r\nunder contract.\r\n\r\nThe first actual shipment (overseas) of box respirators was made from\r\nthe Gas Defense Plant on March 4, 1918. From this date the production\r\nincreased by leaps and bounds. As mentioned above, between this date\r\nand November 26, when the last mask was manufactured, 3,146,413 masks\r\nof the box respirator type were passed through final inspection in the\r\nplant. The greatest daily production, 43,926 masks, was reached on\r\nOctober 26, 1918. The process of manufacture will be discussed under\r\nthe chapter on the Gas Mask.\r\n\r\nDuring the last half of 1918 the Kops Tissot mask was manufactured.\r\nThis mask had been perfected during the months preceding August,\r\n1918, when its manufacture was started. Considerable difficulty was\r\nencountered in its production, but the first mask was completed on\r\nSeptember 14, and between that time and the Armistice, 189,603 masks of\r\nthis type had been manufactured.\r\n\r\nAlong with this manufacturing development went the building up of\r\nan elaborate procurement force charged with the responsibility of\r\nproviding parts to be assembled at the Gas Defense Plant and at the\r\nHero Manufacturing Company. This Section faced a hard and intricate\r\ntask, but, though there were instances where the shortage of parts\r\ntemporarily caused a slowing down of production, these were remarkably\r\nrare. Not only had the parts to be standardized, and specifications\r\nwritten, but a field inspection force had to be trained in order that\r\nthe finished parts might be suitable for the final assembly plant.\r\nThe problem was further complicated by the fact that the design was\r\nconstantly changing, as improvement followed improvement. Officers,\r\ntrained in inspection in a day, were sent out to train inspectors in\r\nthe industrial centers.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1918, shortly before the German drive commenced,\r\nrequisitions were received for sample lots of oiled mittens and oiled\r\nunion suits as protection against mustard gas. These were prepared in\r\nquantity and sent to the front, as was also a considerable amount of\r\nchloride of lime for neutralizing the mustard gas in the field.\r\n\r\nAnother phase of the work consisted of the Field Testing Section, which\r\nwas organized to provide field testing conditions for the regular\r\nproduct and for the development organization. Later there were added\r\na preliminary course of training for officers for overseas duty in\r\nchemical warfare, the military training of the Gas Defense officers\r\nlocated in and near New York and the training of boat crews engaged in\r\ncarrying offensive gas supplies. The Field Testing Section rendered\r\nvaluable service in pointing out weaknesses of designs as developments\r\ntook place and especially those uncomfortable features of the masks\r\nwhich were apparent only through long wear. During the course of this\r\nwork the section built a complete trench system in the Pennsylvania\r\nRailroad yards with an elaborate dugout, the equal of any of the famous\r\nGerman quarters on the Western front.\r\n\r\nThe chapters on Charcoal, Soda-Lime and the Gas Mask must be read\r\nin this connection to gain an idea of the work carried out by this\r\nDivision. It is summed up in the statement that American soldiers were\r\nprovided with equipment which neutralized the best effects of German\r\nchemical knowledge as evidenced by the offensive methods and materials\r\nemployed.\r\n\r\nThe organization of the Gas Defense Division, as of Nov. 11, 1918, was\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n    Colonel Bradley Dewey    Officer in Charge\r\n    Lieut. Col. A. L. Besse  Asst. Officer in Charge\r\n    Major M. L. Emerson      Administration Section\r\n    Major H. P. Schuit       Comptrolling Section\r\n    Mr. R. Skemp             Procurement Section\r\n    Major C. R. Johnson      Technical Director\r\n    Capt. K. Atterbury       Field Testing Section\r\n    Major J. C. Woodruff     Chemical Manufacturing and Development\r\n    Mr. R. R. Richardson     Manager, Gas Defense Plant\r\n    Capt. H. P. Scott        Officer in Charge, Hero Manufacturing Co.\r\n    Major L. W. Cottman      Engineering Branch\r\n    Major T. L. Wheeler      Chemical Development\r\n    Major I. W. Wilson       Astoria Branch\r\n    Capt. W. E. Brophy       San Francisco Branch\r\n    Lt. E. J. Noble          Cleveland Branch\r\n    Lt. L. Merrill           Springfield Branch\r\n\r\n\r\nEDGEWOOD ARSENAL\r\n\r\nThe Ordnance Department, in making plans for a shell filling plant,\r\nthought to interest existing chemical firms in the manufacture of the\r\nrequired toxic materials. As plans developed, however, difficulties\r\narose in carrying out this program. The manufacture of such material\r\nat private plants necessitated its shipment to the filling plant at\r\nEdgewood. The transportation of large quantities of highly toxic gases\r\nseemed attended with great danger. The Director General of Railroads\r\nruled that all such shipments must be made by special train, a very\r\nexpensive method of transportation. Still more serious objections were\r\nencountered in the attempt to enlist the co-operation of existing\r\nfirms. They recognized that the manufacture of such material would be\r\nattended by very great danger; that the work would be limited to the\r\nduration of the war; and that the processes involved, as well as the\r\nplants necessary for carrying out their processes, would have little\r\npost-war value. Moreover, such firms as had the personnel and equipment\r\nwere already over-worked. With a few exceptions (notably the American\r\nSynthetic Color Company, the Oldbury Electro-Chemical Co., Zinsser &\r\nCo., and the Dow Chemical Company) they were unwilling to undertake\r\nwork of this character on any terms whatever.\r\n\r\nEarly in December, 1917, therefore, it was decided to erect, on\r\nthe site of the shell filling plant, such chemical plants as would\r\nbe necessary to furnish the toxic materials required for filling\r\nthe shell. The Arsenal is situated in an isolated district, twenty\r\nmiles east of Baltimore, Maryland, on the Pennsylvania Railroad, and\r\ncomprises 3,400 acres. Since the main line of the Pennsylvania Railroad\r\nruns on one side of the tract, while on another is the Bush River,\r\nonly a few miles from its mouth in Chesapeake Bay, the tract was\r\nideally situated for shipping. This site was referred to, at first, as\r\n“Gunpowder Reservation,” but on May 4, 1918, the name was officially\r\nchanged to “Edgewood Arsenal.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.—Edgewood Arsenal.\r\n\r\nThe upper view shows the site as it appeared Oct. 24, 1917. The lower\r\nview shows the same as it appeared nine months later.]\r\n\r\nSome idea of the extent of the work may be gained from the following\r\nfacts. On October 1, 1918, there were 233 officers, 6,948 enlisted men\r\nand 3,066 civilians engaged in work at Edgewood. 86 cantonments were\r\nbuilt, accommodating about 8,500 men, while the five officers’ barracks\r\nprovided accommodations for 290. The completed hospital unit consisted\r\nof 34 buildings, accommodating 420 patients under ordinary conditions.\r\nThe total number of buildings erected on the Arsenal grounds was 550.\r\n14.8 miles of improved roads were built, and 21 miles of standard gauge\r\nand 15 miles of narrow gauge railway. A system furnishing 9.5 million\r\ngallons of salt water and another furnishing two millions of fresh\r\nwater daily were successfully installed. Large power plants were built\r\nin connection with the shell filling plants and the chlorine plant.\r\n\r\nPlants for phosgene, chloropicrin, mustard gas, chlorine and sulfur\r\nchloride were built and placed in successful operation. Most of the raw\r\nmaterials, with the exception of sulfur chloride, were obtained from\r\ncommercial firms. The other gases and manufactured materials used, such\r\nas phosphorus, tin and silicon tetrachlorides, bromobenzylcyanide and\r\narsenic derivatives were supplied by various plants scattered through\r\nthe East and Middle West States.\r\n\r\nThe raw materials used by the Arsenal in 1918 were as follows:\r\n\r\n    Salt               17,358,000 pounds\r\n    Bleach             42,384,000   “\r\n    Picric acid         3,718,000   “\r\n    Alcohol             3,718,000   “\r\n    Sulfur             24,912,000   “\r\n    Sulfur chloride     6,624,000   “\r\n    Bromine               238,000   “\r\n    Benzyl chloride        26,000   “\r\n\r\nThe production of toxic materials and the amount shipped overseas in\r\nbulk follow:\r\n\r\n    -----------------------+-------------+-------------\r\n                           | Production, | Shipped in\r\n                           |   Pounds    | Bulk, Pounds\r\n    -----------------------+-------------+-------------\r\n    Chlorine:              |             |\r\n      Liquid               |  5,446,000  | 2,976,000\r\n      Gaseous              |  2,208,000  |\r\n    Chloropicrin           |  5,552,000  | 3,806,000\r\n    Phosgene               |  3,233,070  |   840,000\r\n    Mustard gas            |  1,422,000  |   380,000\r\n    Bromobenzyl cyanide    |     10,000  |\r\n    White phosphorus       |  2,012,000  |   342,000\r\n    Tin tetrachloride      |  2,012,000  |   212,000\r\n    Titanium tetrachloride |    362,000  |\r\n    -----------------------+-------------+-------------\r\n\r\nFor nearly a month previous to the signing of the Armistice, the\r\nvarious plants at the Arsenal had shut down or were operated only to\r\nan extent sufficient to maintain the machinery and equipment in good\r\nworking order, on account of the lack of shell into which to fill\r\nthe gas, so that the above figures do not at all represent maximum\r\nproductive capacity.\r\n\r\nThese plants will be described in the appropriate chapters.\r\n\r\nThe shell filling plant was really composed of several small\r\nplants, each of which was made up of units radiating from a central\r\nrefrigeration plant which would serve all the units. Each unit could\r\nthen be fitted with machinery adapted for filling shell of a different\r\nsize, and for a particular gas. Moreover, an accident in one of the\r\nunits would in no way impair the working of the remainder.\r\n\r\nThe problem involved in the filling of a shell with toxic material\r\n(which is always a liquid or a solid and never a gas under the\r\nconditions in which it is loaded in the shell) is similar in a way\r\nto that of filling bottles with carbonated water. In the development\r\nof plans for the filling plant, many suggestions were obtained from\r\na study of the apparatus used in commercial bottling plants. It was\r\nnecessary to keep in mind not only the large number of shell to be\r\nfilled, but also the highly toxic character of the filling material to\r\nbe used. It was essential that the work of filling and closing the\r\nshell should be done by machinery in so far as that was possible, and\r\nthat the operation should be carried out in a thoroughly ventilated\r\nroom or tunnel, arranged so that the machinery contained in the tunnel\r\ncould be operated from the outside. Special care was taken in closing\r\nthe shell, the closing being accomplished by motors actuated by\r\ncompressed air, which, in the closing process were driven until they\r\nstalled. In this way a uniform closing torque was obtained. The final\r\nresults secured were admirable, as is evidenced by the fact, reported\r\nby the Quartermaster Officer at Vincennes on November 15, 1918, that\r\nnot a single leaky shell had been found among the 200,000 shell\r\nreceived up to that date.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.—A Typical Shell filling Plant at Edgewood\r\nArsenal.]\r\n\r\nDetails of the filling process will be found in the chapter on Phosgene.\r\n\r\nBesides the ordinary gas filling plants (of which one was completed\r\nand two were 80 per cent completed) there was a plant for stannic\r\nchloride grenades, one for white phosphorus grenades, and one for smoke\r\nshell also filled with phosphorus and a plant for filling incendiary\r\nbombs.\r\n\r\nShell are designated by their diameter in inches or millimeters. The\r\napproximate amount of toxic gas required for filling each type of shell\r\n(10.5 per cent void) is as follows:\r\n\r\n    ---------+-----------+-----------+-------------\r\n    Shell    | Phosgene, | N.

The number of casualties should change the\r\nmind of anyone who feels that men chose this work as being “safe”\r\ninstead of going to France. During the six months from June to December\r\nthere were 925 casualties, of which three were fatal, two being due to\r\nphosgene and one to mustard gas. These were divided among the different\r\ngases as follows:\r\n\r\n    Mustard gas           674\r\n    Stannic chloride       50\r\n    Phosgene               50\r\n    Chloropicrin           44\r\n    Chlorine               62\r\n    Other material         45\r\n\r\nOf these 279 occurred during August, 197 during September and 293\r\nduring October. Since production stopped early in November, there were\r\nonly 14 during that month and three during December.\r\n\r\nThe Staff at Edgewood Arsenal at the signing of the Armistice was as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    Commanding Officer            Colonel Wm. H. Walker\r\n                                { Lt. Colonel George Cahoon, Jr.\r\n    Administrative Officers     { Lt. Col. Edward M. Ellicott\r\n                                { Lt. Col. Wm. C.

Evans\r\n\r\nAs the work of the Arsenal expanded it was necessary to manufacture\r\ncertain of the chemicals at outside plants. The men in charge of these\r\nplants were:\r\n\r\n    Bound Brook, N. J.            Lt. William R. Chappell\r\n    Stamford, Conn.               Lt. V. E. Fishburn\r\n    Hastings-on-Hudson, N. Y.     Major F. G. Zinnsser\r\n    Niagara Falls, N. Y.          Major A.

Hulburt\r\n\r\nAfter the Armistice, Edgewood Arsenal was selected as the logical home\r\nof the Chemical Warfare Service, and all the outside activities of the\r\nService were gradually closed up and the physical property and files\r\nmoved to Edgewood. At first the command of the Arsenal was in the hands\r\nof Lt. Col. Fries, but when he was appointed Chief of the Service,\r\nMajor E. J. Atkisson, who had so successfully commanded the First Gas\r\nRegiment, A. E. F., was happily chosen his successor. At the present\r\ntime (July 1, 1921), the organization of Edgewood Arsenal is as follows:\r\n\r\n    Commanding Officer            Major E. J. Atkisson\r\n    Executive Officer             Major R. C. Ditto\r\n    Technical Director            Dr. J. E. Mills\r\n    Chemical Division             Mr. D. B. Bradner\r\n    Mechanical Division           Mr. S. P. Johnson\r\n    Plant Division                Capt. E. G. Thompson\r\n    Chemical Warfare School       Major O. R. Meredith\r\n    Property                      Major A. M. Heritage\r\n    First Gas Regiment            Major C. W. Mason\r\n    Mask Production Division      Lt. L. A. Elliott\r\n    Medical Department            Major T. L. Gore\r\n    Pathological Division         Lt. H. A. Kuhn\r\n    Quartermaster Department      Capt. H. L. Hudson\r\n    Finance Department            Capt. C. R. Insley\r\n\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT DIVISION\r\n\r\nThe Development Division had its origin in the research laboratories\r\nof the National Carbon Company and of the National Lamp Works of the\r\nGeneral Electric Company. Both of these companies knew charcoal, and\r\nthey were asked to produce a satisfactory absorbent charcoal. The\r\nsuccess of this undertaking will be seen in the chapter on Absorbents.\r\nAfter a short time all the laboratory work was taken over by the\r\nNational Carbon Co., while the developmental work was assigned to\r\nthe National Lamp Works. When the final organization of the Chemical\r\nWarfare Service took place, the National Carbon Laboratory became part\r\nof the Research Division, while the National Lamp Works became the\r\nDefense Section of the Development Division.\r\n\r\nThe Development Division may be considered as having been composed of\r\nthe following sections:\r\n\r\n    1. Defense\r\n    2. Offense\r\n    3. Midland\r\n    4. Willoughby\r\n    5. Special Investigation.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Defense Section consisted of the development of a\r\ncharcoal suitable for use in gas masks, and its manufacture. While the\r\ndetails will be given later, it may be mentioned here that three weeks\r\nafter the organization of the Section (April 28, 1917) the furnaces\r\nof the National Carbon Company were turning out cedar charcoal, using\r\na straight distillation procedure. Cedar was selected from a large\r\nvariety of materials as giving the highest absorptive value against\r\nchlorine. But phosgene and chloropicrin were also being used, and it\r\nwas found that the cedar charcoal was not effective against either.\r\nProceeding on a definite hypothesis, fifty materials were investigated\r\nto find the charcoal with the highest density. Cocoanut hulls furnished\r\nthe raw material, which yielded the most active charcoal. By a\r\nprocess of air activation a charcoal was obtained which possessed\r\nhigh absorptive power for such gases as chloropicrin and phosgene.\r\nLater this air process was changed to one in which steam is used;\r\nthe cocoanut shell charcoal activated with steam was given the name\r\n“Dorsite.”\r\n\r\nComplete apparatus for this air process was installed at the plant of\r\nthe Astoria Light, Heat & Power Company, Long Island City, and the\r\nfirst charcoal was prepared during September, 1917. This was followed\r\nby a large amount of experimental work, relating to the raw material,\r\nthe method of activation, and the type of furnace used. Because of the\r\nshortage of cocoanut hulls, it later became necessary to use a mixture\r\nof cocoanuts with cohune nuts, apricot and peach pits, cherry pits and\r\nvegetable ivory. Another substitute for cocoanut charcoal was found\r\nin a steam activated product from high grade anthracite coal, called\r\n“Batchite.”\r\n\r\nThe Offense Section and the Midland Section were concerned with the\r\nmanufacture of mustard gas. This work was greatly delayed because\r\nof the unsatisfactory nature of the so-called chlorohydrin process.\r\nAnother difficulty was the development of a satisfactory ethylene\r\nfurnace. Finally in February, 1918, Pope in England discovered the\r\nsulfur chloride method of making mustard gas. At once all the energies\r\nof the Research Division were concentrated on this process, and\r\nin March steps were taken to put this process into production. An\r\nexperimental plant was established at Cleveland; no attempt was made\r\nto manufacture mustard gas on a large scale, but the results obtained\r\nin the experimental studies were immediately transmitted to the\r\nmanufacturing plants at Edgewood Arsenal, the Hastings-on-Hudson plant,\r\nthe National Aniline & Chemical Company (Buffalo) plant, and the Dow\r\nChemical Company (Midland) plant. The details of the work on mustard\r\ngas will be given in a later chapter.\r\n\r\nSpecial investigations were undertaken to develop a booster casing and\r\nadapter for 75 mm. gas shell, and to duplicate the French process of\r\nlining gas shell with glass.\r\n\r\nThe organization of the Development Division at the signing of the\r\nArmistice was as follows:\r\n\r\n    Colonel F. M. Dorsey          Chief of the Division\r\n    Major L. J. Willien           Supt., Offense Section\r\n    Capt. O. L. Barnebey          Supt., Defense Section\r\n    Lt. Col. W. G. Wilcox         Supt., Experimental Station\r\n    Capt. Duncan MacRae           Special Investigation Section\r\n    Dr. A. W. Smith               Midland Section\r\n    Capt. J. R. Duff              Administrative Section\r\n\r\n\r\nPROVING DIVISION\r\n\r\nThe Proving Division had its origin in the decision to build an\r\nExperimental Ground for gas warfare under the direction of the Trench\r\nWarfare Section of the Ordnance Department. While this decision was\r\nreached about September, 1917, actual work on the final location\r\n(Lakehurst, N. J.) was not started until March 26, 1918, and the\r\nconstruction work was not completed until August 1, 1918. However,\r\nfiring trials were started on April 25, 1918, and in all 82 were\r\ncarried out.\r\n\r\nThe Proving Division was created to do two things: To experiment\r\nwith gas shell before they reached the point where they could be\r\nmanufactured safely in large numbers for shipment overseas; and to\r\nprove gas shell, presumably perfect and ready for shipment, to guard\r\nagainst any mechanical inaccuracies in manufacture or filling. It\r\nis evident that the second proposition is dependent upon the first.\r\nShell can not be proved to ascertain the effect of gases under various\r\nconditions and concentrations until the mechanical details of the\r\nshell itself, purely an Ordnance matter, have been standardized.\r\nUnfortunately many of the tests carried out had to do with this very\r\nquestion of testing Ordnance.\r\n\r\nFor field concentration work two complete and separate lines of\r\ntrenches were used and also several impact grounds. The trenches were\r\nbuilt to simulate the trenches actually used in warfare. Each line of\r\ntrench contained several concrete shell-proof dugouts and was also\r\nequipped with shelves into which boxes could be placed for holding\r\nthe sample bottles. At intervals of one yard throughout the trenches\r\nthere were electrical connections available for electrical sampling\r\npurposes. The various impact grounds were used for cloud gas attacks,\r\nand experiments with mustard gas or in many cases for static trials.\r\nThe samples were collected by means of an automatic sampling apparatus.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Division consisted in the first instance of determining\r\nthe proper bursting charge. While a great deal of this work had been\r\ncarried out in Europe, American gas shell were enough different to\r\nrequire that tests be carried out on them. The importance of this work\r\nis obvious, since phosgene, a substance with a low boiling point, would\r\nrequire a smaller bursting charge to open the shell and allow the\r\nsubstance to vaporize than would mustard gas, where the bursting charge\r\nmust be not only sufficient to fragment the shell but also to scatter\r\nthe liquid so that it would be atomized over the largest possible area.\r\nIn the case of low boiling liquids it was necessary that the charge be\r\nworked out very carefully as a difference of one or two grams would\r\nseriously affect the concentration. Too small a charge would allow a\r\ncup to be formed by the base of the shell which would carry some of the\r\nliquid into the ground, while too great an amount of explosive tended\r\nto throw the gas too high into the air.\r\n\r\nAfter the bursting charge had been determined a large number of shell\r\nwere repeatedly fired into the trenches, wooded areas, rolling and\r\nlevel ground, and the concentration of gas produced and the effect upon\r\nanimals placed within the area ascertained. From the results of these\r\nexperiments the Proving Division was able to furnish the artillery\r\nwith data regarding how many shell of given caliber should be used,\r\nwith corrections for ranges, wind velocities, temperatures, ground\r\nconditions, etc. Trials were also held to determine how many high\r\nexplosive (H.E.) shell could be fired with gas shell on the same area\r\nwithout unduly affecting the concentration. This was important, because\r\nH.E. shell were useful in disguising gas bombardments. Gas shell can\r\nusually be distinguished by the small detonation on bursting.\r\n\r\nExperiments were performed to determine the decomposition of various\r\ngases on detonation. The shell were fired at a large wooden screen and\r\nburst on impact. Samples of gas were taken immediately and analyzed.\r\n\r\nCo-operative tests were carried out with the Gas Defense Division to\r\ndetermine the value of given masks under field conditions. Companies of\r\ninfantry, fully equipped for the field, would wear masks for hours at\r\na time digging trenches, cutting timber, drilling, etc., and imitating\r\nin every way, as far as possible, actual field conditions. During\r\nthese activities tons of gas in cylinders were released in such a way\r\nthat the men were enveloped in a far higher concentration than would\r\nprobably ever be the case in actual battle. These tests gave valuable\r\ndata for criticizing gas mask construction.\r\n\r\nAnother line of activity consisted of a study of the persistency and\r\nrelative effectiveness of various samples of mustard gas, in which the\r\nliquid was distributed uniformly upon the surface of grassy zones one\r\nto three feet in width, which formed the periphery of circular areas 14\r\nto 21 feet in diameter, the central part of each circle being occupied\r\nby animals.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Proving Division was brought to an end (by the\r\nArmistice) just at the time when it had reached its greatest\r\nusefulness. Not only were the physical properties and personnel of the\r\nDivision developed to the maximum degree, but the production of gas\r\nshell in this country for shipment to France had just reached the stage\r\nwhere the Proving Ground could have been used to its fullest extent in\r\ntheir proving.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAINING DIVISION\r\n\r\nFrom the standpoint of the man at the front the Training Division\r\nis one of the most important. To him gas warfare is an ever present\r\ntitanic struggle between poisonous vapors that kill on one side, and\r\nthe gas mask and a knowledge of how and when to wear it, on the other.\r\nBecause of this it is rather surprising that we did not hear more about\r\nthis branch of the Service. It did exist, however, and credit must be\r\ngiven to those camp gas officers who remained in the United States\r\nperforming an inconspicuous and arduous duty in the face of many local\r\nobstacles.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.]\r\n\r\nThe Field Training Division of the Gas Defense Service in the United\r\nStates was organized in September, 1917, and consisted of Major J. H.\r\nWalton and 45 first lieutenants, all chemists. These men were given a\r\nthree months’ military training at the American University. The arrival\r\nof Major (now Colonel) Auld during this time was very helpful, as he\r\nwas able to give the Section first-hand knowledge. About 12 of the 45\r\nmen wore sent to France, while the remainder, together with British Gas\r\nOfficers, were assigned to various Divisions still in training. There\r\nwas little idea at that time as to what constituted real gas training.\r\nNo one knew how much gas training would be received in France, and\r\nsince little was often received due to lack of time, many men went\r\ninto action with no idea of what this training really meant. Moreover,\r\nan order that the gas officers should not go to France with their\r\nDivisions had, as was only natural, a discouraging effect upon the men\r\nand upon gas training and discipline generally.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1918, the gas officers were transferred to the Engineers,\r\nand designated as the 473d Engineers. Later an Army Gas School was\r\nestablished at Camp Humphreys. Because of the rapidly changing\r\npersonnel, owing to overseas assignments, the policy was adopted of\r\nsending specialized gas officers only to Divisional Camps and the\r\nlarger training centers. The need of a larger unit and increased\r\nauthority was recognized by all intimately associated with the work,\r\nbut little was accomplished until the transfer to the Chemical Warfare\r\nService. Upon the appointment of Brigadier General H. C. Newcomer as\r\nAssistant Director of the Chemical Warfare Service, he was placed in\r\ncharge of all military affairs of the Service, and the administrative\r\nofficers of the Training Section became his “military assistants.” A\r\nfew weeks later the Training Section of the Administration Division,\r\nC.W.S. was formed.\r\n\r\nAt this time new duties fell to the lot of this Section, among the more\r\nimportant being:\r\n\r\n    (1) The organization of gas troops and casual\r\n        detachments for overseas duty;\r\n\r\n    (2) The establishment of a Chemical Warfare Training\r\n        Camp;\r\n\r\n    (3) The procurement and training of officers for\r\n        overseas duty.\r\n\r\nFor this purpose a training camp was established near the Proving\r\nGround (Camp Kendrick) to hold 1300 officers and men. Line officers\r\nwere sent from the larger camps for training, the best of whom might\r\nlater be transferred to the Chemical Warfare Service for duty as Gas\r\nOfficers.\r\n\r\nThe work of the Section eventually grew to such proportions that it was\r\nrecognized as the Training Division of the Chemical Warfare Service. It\r\ndiffered from other Divisions in that all administrative routine was\r\ncarried on through the offices of the Director, and with the assistance\r\nand co-operation of its various Sections.\r\n\r\nBecause of the formation of the Chemical Warfare Service and the\r\napparent need for officers, the office was soon flooded with\r\napplications for commissions. These were carefully examined and the\r\nmen were sent first, by courtesy of the Chief of Engineers, to Camp\r\nHumphreys for a month’s course of military training. At the end of this\r\nperiod they were sent to Camp Kendrick as students of the Army Gas\r\nSchool. Toward the last of October all the officers and enlisted men\r\nwere transferred to Camp Kendrick where an Officers’ Training Battalion\r\nwas organized.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that the gas training of troops was the most responsible\r\nduty of the Training Division. There was constantly in mind an ideal\r\nof supervised and standardized training for all troops in the United\r\nStates, and the Division, at the time of the Armistice, for the first\r\ntime found itself with a nearly adequate corps of officers through whom\r\nthis ideal could be realized.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICAL DIVISION\r\n\r\nDr. Yandell Henderson of Yale University was the logical man to\r\ninaugurate the medical work of the Bureau of Mines, because of his\r\nexperience with oxygen rescue apparatus. A member of the first\r\ncommittee of the Bureau, he secured, in July, 1917, an appropriation\r\nfor the study of toxic gases at Yale. This was in charge of Doctors\r\nUnderhill, therapy; Marshall, pharmacology; and Winternitz, pathology.\r\nWhen the American University Station was opened Marshall was given\r\ncharge of the pharmacology. About the same time a factory protection\r\nunit was organized under the direction of Doctors Bradley, Eyster\r\nand Loevenhart. At first this committee reported to the Ordnance\r\nDepartment, but later the work was transferred to the Gas Defense\r\nService.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1917, the Medical Advisory Board was organized. This\r\nincluded all the men who were carrying on experimental work of a\r\nmedical nature. This board had as its object the correlation of\r\nall medical work; new work was outlined and attempts were made to\r\nsecure the co-operation of scientific men throughout the country.\r\nThe following groups of workers assisted in this effort: At Yale,\r\nUnderhill studied therapy, turning his animals over to Winternitz\r\nfor pathological study. Henderson was specially interested in the\r\nphysiology of aviation. At the American University Marshall carried\r\non pharmacological research, specially as regards mustard gas, the\r\ntoxicology being covered by Loevenhart. A pathological laboratory\r\nwas also started, under Winternitz, where many valuable studies\r\nwere made.[14] At Cleveland Sollmann was busy with mustard gas and\r\nprotective agents. Pearce, working in co-operation with Dr. Geer of\r\nthe Goodrich Rubber Company, perfected the Goodrich Lakeside Mask. His\r\nstudy was very valuable as concerning the physiology of the gas mask.\r\nAt Ann Arbor Warthin and Weller[15] were studying the physiology and\r\npathology of mustard gas. Wells, Amberg, Helmholz and Austin of the\r\nOtho Sprague Memorial Institute were interested in protective clothing,\r\nwhile at Madison, Eyster, Loevenhart and Meek were engaged in a study\r\nof the chronic effect of long exposures to low concentrations, and\r\nlater expanded their work to protective ointments and certain problems\r\nin pathology.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: See the Pathology of War Gas Poisoning, 1920, Yale Press.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: See Medical Aspects of Mustard Gas Poisoning, 1919, C. O.\r\nMosby Co.]\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1918 many of these men were commissioned into the Gas\r\nDefense Service of the Sanitary Corps, and were later transferred to\r\nthe Chemical Warfare Service as the Medical Division, with Colonel W.\r\nJ. Lyster, M.C., in charge.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important functions of this Division was the daily\r\ntesting of a large number of compounds for toxicity, lachrymatory or\r\nvesicant properties. The accuracy of these tests might and probably did\r\nsave a large amount of unnecessary experimental work on the part of the\r\nResearch Division. These tests are described in a later chapter.\r\n\r\nVery interesting and likewise valuable was the study of mustard gas by\r\nMarshall, Lynch and Smith. They were able to work out the mechanism of\r\nits action and the varying degrees of susceptibility in individuals\r\n(see page 171).\r\n\r\nAnother interesting point was the fact that in the case of certain\r\ngases there is a cumulative effect. With superpalite and mustard gas\r\nthe lethal concentration (that concentration which is fatal after a\r\ngiven exposure) is lower on longer exposures. On the other hand there\r\nis no cumulative effect with hydrocyanic acid. Whether the action is\r\ncumulative or not depends on the rate at which the system destroys or\r\neliminates the poison.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIAISON OFFICERS\r\n\r\nThis chapter should not be closed without reference to the Liaison\r\nService that was established between the United States and her Allies,\r\nespecially England.\r\n\r\nDuring the early days no one in the States was familiar with the\r\ndetails of gas warfare. At the request of the Medical Corps, upon the\r\nurgent representations of the Gas Service, A.E.F., Captain (now Major)\r\nH. W. Dudley was sent to this country (Sept., 1917) to assist in the\r\ndevelopment and manufacture of gas masks. For some time he was the\r\nCourt of Appeal on nearly all technical points regarding matters of\r\ndefense. Dudley’s continual insistence on the need for maintaining the\r\nhighest possible standard of factory inspection was one of the factors\r\nresulting in the excellent construction of the American Mask. In March,\r\n1918, Lieut. Col. Dewey and Captain Dudley made a trip to England\r\nand France, during which the idea of a liaison between the defense\r\norganizations of the two countries originated. Dudley was transferred\r\nto the Engineers, promoted and placed in charge of the Liaison service.\r\nWhile the time until the Armistice was too short to really test the\r\nidea, enough was accomplished to show the extreme desirability of some\r\nsuch arrangement.\r\n\r\nProbably the best known liaison officer from the British was Colonel\r\nS. J. M. Auld, also sent upon the urgent representations of the Gas\r\nService, A.E.F. He arrived in this country about the middle of October,\r\n1917, in charge of 28 officers and 28 non-commissioned officers, who\r\nwere to act as advisers in training and many other military subjects\r\nbesides gas warfare. Since Auld had had personal experience with gas\r\nwarfare as then practiced at the front, his advice was welcomed most\r\nheartily by all the different branches of the Army then handling gas\r\nwarfare. On questions of general policy Auld was practically the sole\r\nforeign adviser. The matter of gas training was transferred from the\r\nMedical Corps to the Engineers, and was greatly assisted by four\r\npamphlets on Gas Warfare issued by the War College, which were prepared\r\nby Major Auld with the assistance of Captain Walton and Lieut. Bohnson.\r\nLater Auld gave the American public a very clear idea of gas warfare\r\nin his series of articles appearing in the Saturday Evening Post, and\r\nre-written as “Gas and Flame.”\r\n\r\nMajor H. R. LeSueur, who was at Porton previous to his arrival in this\r\ncountry in December, 1917, rendered valuable aid in establishing the\r\nExperimental Proving Ground and in its later operations.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the war the British War Office had drawn up a\r\nscheme for a Gas Mission, which was to correlate all the gas activities\r\nof England and America. This was never carried through because of the\r\nsigning of the Armistice.\r\n\r\nThe French representatives, M. Grignard, Capt. Hanker and Lt. Engel\r\nfurnished valuable information as to French methods, but they were\r\nhandicapped by the fact that French manufacturers did not disclose\r\ntheir trade secrets even to their own Government.\r\n\r\nAbout August, 1918, Lieut. Col. James F. Norris opened an office in\r\nLondon. His duties were to establish cordial and intimate relations not\r\nonly with the various agencies of the British Government which were\r\nconnected with gas warfare, but also with the various laboratories\r\nwhere experiments were being conducted, that important changes might be\r\ntransmitted to America with the least possible delay. The English made\r\nColonel Norris a member of the British Chemical Warfare Committee. Here\r\nagain the signing of the Armistice prevented a full realization of the\r\nimportance of this work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE CHEMICAL WARFARE SERVICE IN FRANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is worth noting here that the Chemical Warfare Service was organized\r\nas a separate service in the American Expeditionary Forces nearly ten\r\nmonths before it was organized in the United States, and that the\r\norganization in the United States as heretofore described was patterned\r\nclosely on that found so successful in France.\r\n\r\nVery soon after the United States declared war against the Central\r\nPowers, a commission was sent abroad to study the various phases of\r\nwarfare as carried on by the Allies, and as far as possible by the\r\nenemy. Certain members of this commission gave attention to chemical\r\nwarfare. One of those who did this was Professor Hulett of Princeton\r\nUniversity. He, with certain General Staff officers, gathered what\r\ninformation they could in England and France concerning the gases\r\nused and methods of manufacturing them, and to a very slight extent\r\nthe methods of projecting those gases upon the enemy. Some attention\r\nwas paid to gas masks, but there being nobody on the General Staff,\r\nor anywhere else in the Regular Army, whose duty it was to look out\r\nparticularly for chemical warfare materials, these studies produced no\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nAs has already been stated, the Medical Department started the\r\nmanufacture of masks, and the Bureau of Mines, under the leadership\r\nof the Director, Mr. Manning, began studies upon poisonous gases and\r\nthe methods of manufacturing them just before or shortly after war was\r\ndeclared.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, although American troops left for France in May, 1917,\r\nit was not until the end of August—the 17th to be exact—that definite\r\naction was taken toward establishing a Chemical Warfare Service, or,\r\nas it was then known, a Gas Service in the American Expeditionary\r\nForces. On that date a cablegram was sent to the United States to the\r\neffect that it was desired to make Lieut. Col. Amos A. Fries, Corps of\r\nEngineers, Chief of the Gas Service, and requesting that no assignments\r\nto the regiment of gas troops authorized in the United States be made\r\nwhich would conflict with this appointment. On August 22d, Lieut. Col.\r\nFries entered upon his duties as Chief of the Gas Service.\r\n\r\nThere were then in France about 30 miles from the German lines, some\r\n12,000 American troops without any gas masks or training whatever in\r\nChemical Warfare. Immediate steps were taken to teach the wearing of\r\nthe masks, and English and French gas masks were obtained for them at\r\nthe earliest possible moment. At the same time efforts were made to\r\nobtain officer personnel for the C. W. S., and to have sent to France\r\na laboratory for making such emergency researches, experiments, and\r\ntesting as might become necessary. From that time to the end of the war\r\nthe C. W. S. continued to develop on broad lines covering research,\r\ndevelopment, and manufacture; the filling of shell and other containers\r\nwith poisonous gases, smoke and incendiary materials; the purchase\r\nof gas masks and other protective devices, as well as the handling\r\nand supply of these materials in the field; the training of the Army\r\nin chemical warfare methods, both in offense and defense; and the\r\norganization, equipment and operation of special gas troops.\r\n\r\nThis gave an ideal organization whereby research was linked with the\r\nclosest possible ties to the firing line, and where the necessities\r\nof the firing line were brought home to the supply and manufacturing\r\nbranches and to the development and research elements of the Service\r\ninstantly and with a force that could not have been obtained in any\r\nother manner. The success of the C. W. S. in the field and at home was\r\ndue to this complete organization. To the Commander-in-Chief, General\r\nPershing, is due the credit for authorizing this organization and for\r\nbacking it up whenever occasion demanded. Other details of this work\r\nwill be considered under the following heads: Administrative; Training;\r\nChemical Warfare Troops; Supply; Technical; Intelligence; and Medical.\r\n\r\n\r\nADMINISTRATIVE DUTIES\r\n\r\nThe duties of administration covered those necessary for a general\r\ncontrol of research, of supply, of training, and the operation of\r\nspecial gas troops. At first the Chief of the Gas Service comprised the\r\nwhole of the Service since he was without personnel, material, rules,\r\nregulations, or anything else of a chemical warfare nature.\r\n\r\nThe experience in getting together this organization should be\r\nsufficient to insure that the United States will never place on any\r\nother man’s shoulders the burden of organizing a new and powerful\r\nservice in the midst of war, 4,000 miles from home, without precedent,\r\nmaterial, or anything else on which to base action. It is true the\r\nAmericans had available the experience of the English and the French,\r\nand it should be said to the credit of both of these nations that\r\nthey gave of their experience, their time, and their material with\r\nthe greatest freedom and willingness, but just as Americans are\r\nAmericans and were Americans in 1917, just so the methods of the French\r\nand English or of the enemy were not entirely suitable to American\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nIf there is any one thing needed in the training of U. S. Army leaders\r\nof today and for the future, it is vision—vision that can foresee the\r\nsize of a conflict and make preparations accordingly. We do not mean\r\nvision that will order, as happened in some cases, ten times as much\r\nmaterial as could possibly be used by even 5,000,000 troops, but the\r\nsort of vision that could foresee in the fall of 1917 that 2,000,000\r\nmen might be needed in France and then make preparations to get\r\nmaterials there for those troops by the time they arrived.\r\n\r\nIn order to cover the early formative period of the C. W. S. in France\r\nand to show some of the difficulties encountered, the following running\r\naccount is given of some of the early happenings without regard to the\r\nsubdivisions under which they might properly be considered.\r\n\r\n=Assignment of Chief of the Gas Service.= Sailing from the United\r\nStates on the 23d of July, 1917, Fries arrived in Paris on the morning\r\nof August 14, 1917, and was immediately assigned the task of organizing\r\na highway service for the American Expeditionary Forces. Five days\r\nlater and before the highway order was issued, he was asked what he\r\nwould think if his orders were changed so as to make him Chief of the\r\nnewly proposed Gas Service. Being given one night to think it over he\r\ntold the General Staff he would undertake the work. The road work was\r\nimmediately closed up and on the 22d of August the organization of a\r\nGas Service was actively started.\r\n\r\nAt that time some information concerning gases and gas troops had been\r\ngathered by Colonel Barber of the General Staff. Likewise, Colonel\r\n(later Brigadier General) Hugh A. Drum had made a rough draft of\r\nan order accompanied by a diagram for the establishment of the Gas\r\nService. This information was turned over to Fries who was told to\r\ncomplete the draft of the order, together with an organization chart,\r\nfor the action of the Commander-in-Chief. After one and a half days\r\nhad been put on this work the draft and chart were considered in good\r\nenough shape to submit to General Pershing, Commander-in-Chief.\r\n\r\n=First Trip to British Gas Headquarters.= Noting that the proposed\r\norganization provided for the handling of 4-inch Stokes’ mortars by\r\ngas troops, General Pershing asked why this work could not be done\r\nby regular trench mortar companies. He was told that gas operations\r\nwere too technical and dangerous to be intrusted to any but especially\r\ntrained troops, and that, furthermore, it was understood that 4-inch\r\nStokes’ mortars were used only by the British troops. General Pershing\r\nsaid, “You had better beat it to the British Gas Headquarters in the\r\nfield and settle definitely that and certain other minor points.”\r\nFries told him he was only too glad to do this, and, having completed\r\npreparations, left on the morning of August 25th with Colonel Church\r\nand Captain Boothby, both of the Medical Department, for St. Omer,\r\nHeadquarters of the British Gas Service in the Field.\r\n\r\nColonel Church of the Medical Department had been in France nearly\r\none and a half years prior to the entry of the United States into the\r\nwar, and had taken sufficient interest in Gas Warfare to collect\r\nconsiderable information and a number of documents from French sources\r\nbearing on the defensive side of the subject. Captain Boothby had done\r\nthe same with the British, including a course in a British Gas Defense\r\nSchool. On this trip they took up the defensive side with the British,\r\nwhile Fries took up the offensive side of the Service. The latter\r\nincluded gases used, gas troops, and ammunition and guns used in Gas\r\nWarfare by the Artillery and other branches of the Service. The trip\r\nincluded a brief visit to the headquarters of the First British Army in\r\nthe vicinity of Lens, where the British Gas Service had a large depot\r\nof offensive gas material.\r\n\r\n=Order Forming Service.= Returning on the 28th of August the order,\r\ntogether with a chart organizing the Service, was completed and\r\nsubmitted to the General Staff. This was published as G. O. 31,\r\nSeptember 3, 1917. As a result of a study of the information submitted\r\nby Colonel Barber and General Drum, together with his own observations\r\nof British organization and work, Fries decided it was advisable to\r\nmake the Service cover as complete a scope as possible and to make\r\nthe order very general, leaving details to be worked out as time and\r\nexperience permitted. This proved to be a very wise decision, because\r\nthe entire absence of gas knowledge among Americans either in France\r\nor the United States made it necessary to build from the bottom up\r\nand do it rapidly. At that time, and at all times since, it was found\r\nutterly impossible to separate the defensive side from the offensive\r\nside. Indeed, many of the worst troubles of the British with their Gas\r\nService throughout nearly the whole war arose from such a division of\r\nduties in their Service. Thus, the development of masks must be kept\r\nparallel with the development of gases and methods of discharging\r\nthem. Otherwise a new gas invented may penetrate existing masks and\r\npreparations be carried far towards using it before the development of\r\nmasks are undertaken to care for the new gas. Obviously a gas which our\r\nown masks will not take care of cannot be safely used by our own troops\r\nuntil new masks are developed to protect against it.\r\n\r\n=American and British Masks.= Just prior to Fries’s assignment as\r\nChief of the Gas Service twenty thousand American-made masks or box\r\nrespirators were received from the United States. Through the energy\r\nof Captain Boothby several of these had been sent at once to the\r\nBritish for test. The test showed that the granules in the canisters\r\nwere entirely too soft, the charcoal of poor quality, and more than\r\nall else, the fabric of the face piece was so pervious to gases that\r\nchloropicrin became unbearable to the eyes in less than a minute\r\nunder the standard test used by the British. A cable containing this\r\ninformation had been framed and sent to the United States just prior to\r\nFries’s appointment as Chief of the Service.\r\n\r\nAugust 23d, the day after Fries took charge, it was decided to adopt\r\nthe British mask or box respirator as the principal mask and the French\r\nM-2 as an emergency, both to be carried by the soldier, the French M-2,\r\nhowever, to be used only when the British mask became lost or unfit\r\nfor use. A requisition for one hundred thousand of each was at once\r\nsubmitted and very shortly approved by the General Staff.\r\n\r\n=Getting Gas Supplies.= It should be stated here that inasmuch as\r\nno Gas Service had been organized in the United States, no money\r\nappropriation had been made for it, thereby making it necessary for\r\nthe Gas Service to obtain all its supplies through other departments\r\nordinarily handling the same or similar materials. Thus defensive\r\nsupplies were obtained through the Medical Department and offensive\r\nsupplies through the Ordnance Department, while other miscellaneous\r\nequipment was obtained through the Engineer Department, the\r\nQuartermaster Department, or the Signal Corps. This procedure proved\r\nexceedingly embarrassing, cumbersome and inefficient. To begin with it\r\nwas necessary to get some agreement between the departments as to what\r\neach would supply. This was very difficult, resulting in delays and\r\nconsumption of time which was urgently needed on other work.\r\n\r\nNot only was there trouble in getting orders accepted and started on\r\nthe way but following them up became practically impossible. None of\r\nthe Departments furnishing the materials were especially interested in\r\nthem nor in many instances did they realize the vital nature of them.\r\nAccordingly in order to get any action it was necessary to continually\r\nfollow up all orders and doing this through another department created\r\nfriction and misunderstanding. Officers of these departments took\r\nthe attitude that the whole question of obtaining supplies should be\r\nleft to them, once the requisition was turned in. This could not be\r\ndone. The Chief of the Gas Service was absolutely responsible for gas\r\nsupplies, and he fully realized that no excuses would be accepted,\r\nno matter who stood in the way. It was necessary to get action.\r\nFinally the matter was settled, some six months after the Service was\r\norganized, by giving the Chemical Warfare Service the right of direct\r\npurchase.\r\n\r\n=Purchase of Offensive Gas Supplies.= Realizing the difficulty that\r\nwould probably be encountered in getting supplies at all times from\r\nthe British and French, two requisitions for offensive gas supplies to\r\nbe purchased from the British were submitted on September 8th and 10th\r\nrespectively. It would seem proper to state here that investigation\r\nshowed the British gas organization to be far superior to the French.\r\nIndeed, the latter practically had no organization.\r\n\r\nConsequently it was determined to purchase complete equipment for gas\r\ntroops and for the defensive side of the service from the British and\r\nto make no attempt to produce new materials, methods or equipment\r\nuntil ample supplies of the standard equipment of the British were\r\nat hand or in process of manufacture or delivery. This was another\r\nexceedingly wise conclusion. No supplies of any kind were received from\r\nthe United States for the next eight months, and then only masks and\r\ncertain defensive supplies. Indeed, no cylinders, mortars, projectors\r\nor artillery shell containing gas were received from the United States\r\nuntil just before the Armistice, though gas had been available in the\r\nUnited States for months in large quantities, over 3,600 tons having\r\nbeen shipped in one ton containers to the English and French. The\r\nOrdnance material was what was lacking.\r\n\r\n=Obtaining Personnel.= On September. 8, Colonel R. W. Crawford was\r\nassigned to duty with the Gas Service. This matter of obtaining\r\npersonnel became immediately, and continued for almost a year to be,\r\none of the most serious difficulties facing the new Gas Service. The\r\ntroubles here again were the same as those in respect to supplies. None\r\nof the old departments were especially interested in gas and hence none\r\nof them desired to let good officers be transferred.\r\n\r\nOfficers were scarce in the early days in France in every department\r\nof the Service, consequently a new department with no organization in\r\nthe United States and no precedents or opportunities for promotion made\r\nthe obtaining of officers almost a matter of impossibility. Further\r\nthan this, while the Engineer Department was at first supposed to\r\nfurnish most of the officer personnel, it failed to do so, apparently\r\nlooking upon the Gas Service as an unimportant matter when compared\r\nwith the regular work of the Engineers. It was necessary to make\r\ndirect application to the Chief of Staff to obtain Colonel Crawford\r\nand shortly thereafter to cable directly to the United States for\r\nofficers. A year later enough officers were obtained but only after the\r\norganization of a separate Service in the United States.\r\n\r\n=Supplies for Gas Troops.= Colonel Crawford was at once put in Charge\r\nof all supplies for the Gas Service, including the location and\r\nconstruction of separate depots for that Service. Prior to this the\r\nGeneral Staff had decided to have chemical supplies stored in depots\r\nseparate from those of other supplies on account of the poisonous\r\nnature of the gases which might prove very annoying if leakage occurred\r\nnear any other class of supplies. Colonel Crawford took hold of this\r\nwork with zeal and energy and so conducted it as to relieve the Chief\r\nof the Gas Service of all anxiety in that matter. As before stated,\r\non the 10th of September a requisition for a very large quantity\r\nof offensive supplies for gas troops was submitted to the General\r\nStaff for approval. Inasmuch as this involved approximately 50,000\r\ngas cylinders, 50,000 Liven’s drums, with at least 20,000 Liven’s\r\nprojectors and a large number of Stokes’ mortars and bombs, there was\r\nconsiderable difficulty in getting it approved. Finally Colonel Malone\r\nof the Training Section, who took an active interest in the Chemical\r\nWarfare Service, got it approved. Then began the difficulty of getting\r\nthe order placed and of trying to expedite the filling of the order on\r\ntime. These difficulties were never overcome until after the entire\r\npurchase of supplies was, as previously related, taken care of by the\r\nGas Service.\r\n\r\n=First Inter-allied Gas Conference.= The first inter-allied gas\r\nconference was held in Paris on September 16th, and consisted of\r\nAmerican, British, French, Italian, and Belgian delegates. The\r\nconference busied itself mainly with questions of the medical treatment\r\nof gassed cases and of defense against gas.\r\n\r\n=Mustard Gas.= The principal topic under consideration at this\r\nconference was the effects of the new mustard gas first used at Ypres\r\nagainst the British on the nights of the 11th and 12th of July, 1917.\r\nThe British suffered nearly 20,000 casualties from this gas during the\r\nfirst six weeks of its use, and were so worried over it that the start\r\nof the attacks carried out later in the fall of 1917 against Ypres were\r\ndelayed several days. The casualties were particularly heavy because\r\nthe smell of the gas was entirely new and not unpleasant and because\r\nof the delayed action of the gas, whereby men got no indication of its\r\nseriousness until 4 to 8 hours after exposure. For these reasons men\r\nsimply took shelter from the bombardment without putting on masks or\r\ntaking other precautions. As a result of the Paris conference a long\r\ncable was sent to the United States asking among other things that\r\nimmediate report be made on the possibilities of producing ethylene\r\nchlorhydrin, one of the essentials in the manufacture of mustard gas by\r\nthe only method then known.\r\n\r\nWithin two weeks after this conference, there occurred an incident\r\nwhich illustrates the very great danger in taking the views of any one\r\nman unless certain that he is in a position to be posted on all sides\r\nof the question under discussion. A high British official was asked\r\nwhat he had heard in regard to the new mustard gas, and what and how it\r\nwas considered. He said with emphasis that the British had no further\r\nfear of it since they had learned what it was and how to take care of\r\nthemselves and that it had ceased to be any longer a problem with them.\r\n\r\nFries, knowing what he did, was convinced that this did not represent\r\nthe attitude of the British authorities who knew what the gas was\r\ndoing, and the statement was not allowed to influence the American Gas\r\nService in the least. This was a very fortunate thing as events later\r\nproved. It should also be added that a quite similar report was made by\r\na French officer in regard to mustard gas some time in the month of\r\nOctober. The French officer had more reason for his attitude than the\r\nBritish officer as up to that time mustard gas had not been largely\r\nused against the French. However, both cases simply emphasize the\r\ndanger of accepting the views of any man who has seen but one angle of\r\na problem so complicated as gas in war.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAINING\r\n\r\n=Training in Gas Defense.= In the latter part of October seventeen\r\nyoung engineer officers, who had just arrived in France, were assigned\r\nto the Gas Service and were promptly sent to British Gas Schools for\r\ntraining in mask inspection, salvage and repair and in training men\r\nto wear masks and take other necessary precautions against gas in the\r\nfield. It was also necessary at this time to establish gas training in\r\nthe First Division, and Captain Boothby was assigned to that work.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.—Destroying Mustard Gas on the Battle Field.]\r\n\r\nIt is important to note that the Gas Service had to begin operations\r\nimmediately upon its organization although it had almost no facilities\r\nof any kind to work with. At one and the same time it was necessary\r\nto decide upon the kinds of masks to be used and then to obtain them;\r\nto decide upon methods of training troops in gas defense and start at\r\nonce to do it; to decide upon gases to be used and manufactured in the\r\nUnited States and then obtain and send the necessary data and finally\r\nto decide what weapons gas troops were to use and to purchase those\r\nweapons, since none of them existed in the United States. Worse still\r\nno one in the United States was taking any interest in them.\r\n\r\n=New Mask.= About November 1, Major Karl Connell of the Medical\r\nDepartment, National Guard of New York, reported for duty in response\r\nto a cablegram that had been sent asking for him by name. It was\r\nintended to send him to a British School to learn the art of teaching\r\ngas defense. However, learning after a short talk with him that he had\r\nbeen interested in making masks for administering anæsthesia, there\r\nwas at once turned over to him samples of all the masks in use by both\r\nthe Allies and the Germans, with a view to getting his ideas for a new\r\nmask. Within two or three hours he suggested a new mask having a metal\r\nface piece with sponge rubber against the face and with a canister to\r\nbe carried on the back of the head.\r\n\r\nAt that early date it was realized that a new mask must be invented\r\nwhich would be far more comfortable and give better vision than the\r\nBritish respirators adopted for use. Connell, thirty-six hours after\r\nreporting, had so far developed his idea that he was sent to Paris to\r\nmake the first model, which he succeeded in doing in about three weeks.\r\nThis first mask was good enough to risk testing in a high concentration\r\nof chlorine and while it leaked to some extent it indicated that the\r\nidea was sound. The problem then was to perfect the mask and determine\r\nhow it could be produced commercially on the large scale necessary to\r\nequip an army.\r\n\r\nSince the British at this time and practically throughout the war were\r\nmuch ahead of the French in all phases of gas warfare, Connell was\r\nsent to London. There he succeeded in getting additional models in\r\nsuch shape that one of them was sent to the United States during the\r\nfirst few days of January, 1918. Connell’s work and experiments were\r\ncontinued so successfully that after a model had been submitted to the\r\nGeneral Staff, as well as to General Pershing himself, one thousand\r\nwere ordered to be made early in May with a view to an extensive field\r\ntest preparatory to their adoption for general use in the United States\r\nArmy.\r\n\r\nIn this connection, during November, 1917, a letter was written to the\r\nUnited States stating that while the Gas Service in France insisted\r\non the manufacture of British respirators exactly as the British\r\nwere making them, they desired to have experiments pushed on a more\r\ncomfortable mask to meet the future needs of the Army.\r\n\r\nThe following four principles were set down in that letter: (_a_)\r\nThat the mask must give protection and that experience had shown that\r\nsuitable protection could only be obtained by drawing the air through a\r\nbox filled with chemicals and charcoal. (_b_) That there must be clear\r\nvision and that experience to date indicated that the Tissot method of\r\nbringing the inspired air over the eyepieces was by far the best, (_c_)\r\nThat the mask must be as comfortable as compatible with reasonable\r\nprotection, and that this meant the mouthpiece and noseclip must be\r\nomitted. (_d_) That the mask must be as nearly fool proof as it could\r\nbe made. That is, it should be of quick and accurate adjustment, in the\r\ndark or in the trenches, and be difficult to disarrange or injure once\r\nin position.\r\n\r\n=Gas Training and Battle of Picardy Plains.= On March 21, 1918, as is\r\nknown to everyone, the Germans began their great drive from Cambrai\r\nacross the Picardy Plains to Amiens. While the battle was expected\r\nit came as a complete surprise so far as the tactics used, and the\r\nextent and force of the attack, were concerned. Lieutenant Colonel\r\nG. N. Lewis, who had been sent about March 1 to British Gas Schools,\r\nand had been assigned to one of the schools run by the Canadians, was\r\nthus just on the edge of the attack. This gave him an opportunity to\r\nactually observe some of that attack and to learn from eye-witnesses\r\na great deal more. The school, of course, was abandoned hurriedly and\r\nthe students ordered back to their stations. Lewis submitted two brief\r\nreports covering facts bearing on the use of gas and smoke by the\r\nGermans. These reports exhibited such a grasp of gas and smoke battle\r\ntactics that he was immediately ordered to headquarters as assistant on\r\nthe Defense side of gas work, that is, on training in gas defense. Up\r\nto that time no one had been able to organize the Defensive side of gas\r\nwork in the way it was felt it must be organized if it were to prove\r\na thorough success. A month later he was put at the head of the Gas\r\nDefense Section, and in two months he had put the Defense Division on a\r\nsound basis. He was then ordered to the United States to help organize\r\nGas Defense Training there.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.—Close Burst of a Gas Shell. The 6th Marines in\r\nthe Sommediene Sector near Verdun, April 30, 1918.]\r\n\r\n=Cabled Report on Picardy Battle.= Based partly on Colonel Lewis’s\r\nwritten and oral reports, and also on information contained in\r\nIntelligence dispatches and the newspapers, a cablegram of more than\r\n300 words was drafted reciting the main features of the battle so far\r\nas they pertained to the use of gas. This cablegram ended with the\r\nstatement that “the above illustrates the tremendous importance of\r\ncomfort in a mask” and that “the future mask must omit the mouthpiece\r\nand noseclip.”\r\n\r\n=Keeping the General Staff Informed of Work.= In the early part of\r\nMay, 1918, the Americans arrived in the vicinity of Montdidier, south\r\nof Amiens, on the most threatened point of the western front. It was\r\non May 18, 1918, that the Americans attacked, took, and held against\r\nseveral counter-attacks the town of Cantigny. Shortly afterward they\r\nwere very heavily shelled with mustard gas and suffered in one night\r\nnearly 900 casualties. Investigation showed that these casualties were\r\ndue to a number of causes more or less usual, but also to the fact that\r\nthe men had to wear the mask 12 to 15 hours if they were to escape\r\nbeing gassed. Such long wearing of the British mask with its mouthpiece\r\nand noseclip is practically an impossibility and scores became gassed\r\nsimply through exhaustion and inability to wear the mask.\r\n\r\nAn inspector from General Headquarters in reporting on supplies and\r\nequipment in the First Division, stated that one of the most urgent\r\nneeds was a more comfortable mask. The First Division suggested a mask\r\non the principles of the new French mask which was then becoming known\r\nand which omitted the mouthpiece and noseclip. The efforts of the\r\nAmerican Gas Service in France to perfect a mask without a mouthpiece\r\nand noseclip were so well known and so much appreciated that they did\r\nnot even call upon the Gas Service for remark. The assistant to the\r\nChief of Staff who drew up the memorandum to the Chief simply said the\r\nmatter was being attended to by the Gas Service. This illustrates the\r\nvalue of keeping the General Staff thoroughly informed of what is being\r\ndone to meet the needs of the troops on the firing line.\r\n\r\nThen, as always, it was urged that a reasonably good mask was far more\r\ndesirable than the delay necessary to get a more perfect one. Based on\r\nthese experiences with mask development, the authors are convinced that\r\nthe whole tendency of workers in general, in laboratories far from the\r\nfront, is to over-estimate the value of perfect protection based on\r\nlaboratory standards. It is difficult for laboratory workers to realize\r\nthat battle conditions always require a compromise between perfection\r\nand getting something in time for the battle. It was early evident to\r\nthe Gas Service in France that we were losing, and would continue to\r\nlose, vastly more men through removal of masks of the British type, due\r\nto discomfort and exhaustion, than we would from a more comfortable\r\nbut less perfect mask. In other words when protection becomes so much\r\nof a burden that the average man cannot or will not stand it, it is\r\nhigh time to find out what men will stand, and then supply it even at\r\nthe expense of occasional casualties. Protection in battle is always\r\nrelative. The only perfect protection is to stay at home on the farm.\r\nThe man who cannot balance protection against legitimate risks has no\r\nbusiness passing on arms, equipment or tactics to be used at the Front.\r\n\r\nAs early as September, 1917, gas training was begun in the First\r\nDivision at Condrecourt. This training school became the First Corps\r\nSchool. Later a school was established at Langres known as the Army\r\nGas School while two others known as the Second and Third Corps Gas\r\nSchools were established elsewhere. The first program of training for\r\ntroops in France provided for a total period of three months. Of this,\r\ntwo days were allowed the Gas Service. Later this was reduced to six\r\nhours, notwithstanding a vigorous protest by the Gas Service. However,\r\nfollowing the first gas attacks against the Americans with German\r\nprojectors in March, 1918, followed a little later by extensive attacks\r\nwith mustard gas, the A. E. F. Gas Defense School was established at\r\nthe Experimental Field. Arrangements were made for the accommodation\r\nof 200 officers for a six-day course. The number instructed actually\r\naveraged about 150, due to the feeling among Division Commanders that\r\nthey could not spare quite so many officers as were required to furnish\r\n200 per week.\r\n\r\nThis school was conducted under the Commandant of Hanlon Field,\r\nLieutenant Colonel Hildebrand, by Captain Bush of the British Service.\r\nThis Gas Defense School became one of the most efficient schools in\r\nthe A. E. F., and was developing methods of teaching that were highly\r\nsuccessful in protecting troops in the field.\r\n\r\n=Failure of German Gas.= The losses of the Americans from German gas\r\nattacks fluctuated through rather wide limits. There were times in the\r\nearly days during training when this reached 65 per cent of the total\r\ncasualties. There were other times in battle, when due to extremely\r\nsevere losses from machine gun fire in attacks, that the proportion of\r\ngas losses to all other forms of casualties was very small. On the\r\nwhole the casualties from gas reached 27.3 of all casualties. This\r\nsmall percentage was due solely to the fact that when the Americans\r\nmade their big attacks at San Mihiel and the Argonne, the German supply\r\nof gas had run very low. This was particularly true of the supply of\r\nmustard gas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.—German Gas Alarms.]\r\n\r\nFries was at the front visiting the Headquarters of the First Army and\r\nthe Headquarters of the 1st, 3d, and 5th Corps from two days before\r\nthe beginning of the battle of the Argonne to four days afterwards. He\r\nwatched reports of the battle on the morning of the attack at the Army\r\nHeadquarters and later at the 1st, 5th and 3d Corps headquarters in\r\nthe order named. No reports of any gas casualties were received. This\r\nsituation continued throughout the day. It was so remarkable that he\r\ntold the Chief of Staff he could attribute the German failure to use\r\ngas to only one of two possible conditions; first, the enemy was out of\r\ngas; second, he was preparing some master stroke. The first proved to\r\nbe the case as examination after the Armistice of German shell dumps\r\ncaptured during the advance revealed less than 1 per cent of mustard\r\ngas shell. Even under these circumstances the Germans caused quite a\r\nlarge number of gas casualties during the later stages of the fighting\r\nin the Argonne-Meuse sector.\r\n\r\nEvidently the Germans, immediately after the opening of the attack, or\r\nmore probably some days before, began to gather together all available\r\nmustard gas and other gases along the entire western battle front,\r\nand ship them to the American sector. This conclusion seems justified\r\nbecause the enemy never had a better chance to use gas effectively than\r\nhe did the first three or four days of the Argonne fight, and knowing\r\nthis fact he certainly would never have failed to use the gas if it had\r\nbeen available. Had he possessed 50 per cent of his artillery shell in\r\nthe shape of mustard gas, our losses in the Argonne-Meuse fight would\r\nhave been at least 100,000 more than it was. Indeed, it is more than\r\npossible we would never have succeeded in taking Sedan and Mezieres in\r\nthe fall of 1918.\r\n\r\n=Officers’ Training Camp.= The first lot of about 100 officers were\r\nsent to France in July, 1918, with only a few days’ training, and in\r\nsome cases with no training at all. Accordingly, arrangements were made\r\nto train these men in the duties of the soldier in the ranks, and then\r\nas officers. Their training in gas defense and offense followed a month\r\nof strenuous work along the above mentioned lines.\r\n\r\nThis camp was established near Hanlon (Experimental) Field, at a\r\nlittle town called Choignes. The work as laid out included squad and\r\ncompany training for the ordinary soldier, each officer taking turns in\r\ncommanding the company at drill. They were given work in map reading as\r\nwell as office and company administration.\r\n\r\nThis little command was a model of cleanliness and military discipline,\r\nand attracted most favorable comment from staff officers on duty at\r\nGeneral Headquarters less than two miles distant. Just before the\r\nArmistice arrangements were made to transfer this work to Chignon,\r\nabout 25 miles southeast of Tours, where ample buildings and grounds\r\nwere available to carry out not alone training of officers but of\r\nsoldiers along the various lines of work they would encounter, from the\r\nhandling of a squad, to being Chief Gas Officer of a Division.\r\n\r\n=Educating the Army in the Use of Gas.= As has been remarked before,\r\nthe Medical Department in starting the manufacture of gas masks and\r\nother defensive appliances, and the Bureau of Mines in starting\r\nresearches into poisonous gases as well as defensive materials, were\r\nthe only official bodies who early interested themselves in gas\r\nwarfare. Due to this early work of the Bureau of Mines and the Medical\r\nDepartment in starting mask manufacture as well as training in the\r\nwearing of gas masks, the defensive side of gas warfare became known\r\nthroughout the army very far in advance of the offensive side. On the\r\nother hand, since the Ordnance Department, which was at first charged\r\nwith the manufacture of poisonous gases, made practically no move for\r\nmonths, the offensive use of gas did not become known among United\r\nStates troops until after they landed in France.\r\n\r\nMoreover, no gas shell was allowed to be fired by the artillery in\r\npractice even in France, so that all the training in gas the artillery\r\ncould get until it went into the line was defensive, with lectures on\r\nthe offensive.\r\n\r\nThe work of raising gas troops was not begun until the late fall of\r\n1917 and as their work is highly technical and dangerous, they were not\r\nready to begin active work on the American front until June, 1918.\r\n\r\nBy that time the army was getting pretty well drilled in gas defense\r\nand despite care in that respect were getting into a frame of mind\r\nalmost hostile to the use of gas by our own troops. Among certain staff\r\nofficers, as well as some commanders of fighting units, this hostility\r\nwas outspoken and almost violent.\r\n\r\nMuch the hardest, most trying and most skillful work required of\r\nChemical Warfare Service officers was to persuade such Staffs\r\nand Commanders that gas was useful and get them to permit of a\r\ndemonstration on their front. Repeatedly Chemical Warfare Service\r\nofficers on Division staffs were told by officers in the field that\r\nthey had nothing to do with gas in offense, that they were simply\r\ndefensive officers. And yet no one else knew anything about the use of\r\ngas. Gradually, however, by constantly keeping before the General Staff\r\nand others the results of gas attacks by the Germans, by the British,\r\nby the French, and by ourselves, headway was made toward getting our\r\nArmies to use gas effectively in offense.\r\n\r\nBut so slow was this work that it was necessary to train men\r\nparticularly how to appeal to officers and commanders on the subject.\r\nIndeed the following phrase, used first by Colonel Mayo-Smith,\r\nbecame a watchword throughout the Service in the latter part of the\r\nwar—“Chemical Warfare Service officers have got to go out and sell gas\r\nto the Army.” In other words we had to adopt much the same means of\r\nmaking gas known that the manufacturer of a new article adopts to make\r\na thing manufactured by him known to the public.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.—A Typical Shell Dump near the Front.]\r\n\r\nThis work was exceedingly trying, requiring great skill, great\r\npatience and above all a most thorough knowledge of the subject. As\r\nillustrating some of these difficulties, the Assistant Chief of Staff,\r\nG-3 (Operations) of a certain American Corps refused to consider a\r\nrecommendation to use gas on a certain point in the battle of the\r\nArgonne unless the gas officer would state in writing that if the gas\r\nwas so used it could not possibly result in the casualty of a single\r\nAmerican soldier. Such an attitude was perfectly absurd.\r\n\r\nThe Infantry always expects some losses from our own high explosive\r\nwhen following a barrage, and though realizing the tremendous value of\r\ngas, this staff officer refused to use it without an absolute guarantee\r\nin writing that it could not possibly injure a single American soldier.\r\nAnother argument often used was that a gas attack brought retaliatory\r\nfire on the front where the gas was used. Such objectors were narrow\r\nenough not to realize that the mere fact of heavy retaliation indicated\r\nthe success of the gas on the enemy for everyone knows an enemy does\r\nnot retaliate against a thing which does not worry him.\r\n\r\nBut on the other hand, when the value of gas troops had become fully\r\nknown, the requests for them were so great that a single platoon had to\r\nbe assigned to brigades, and sometimes even to whole Divisions. Thus\r\nit fell to the Lieutenants commanding these platoons to confer with\r\nDivision Commanders and Staffs, to recommend how, when and where to use\r\ngas, and do so in a manner which would impress the Commanding General\r\nand the Staff sufficiently to allow them to undertake the job. That no\r\ncase of failure has been reported is evidence of the splendid ability\r\nof these officers on duty with the gas troops. Efficiency in the big\r\nAmerican battles was demanded to an extent unheard of in peace, and had\r\nany one of these officers made a considerable failure, it certainly\r\nwould have been reported and Fries would have heard of it.\r\n\r\nEqually hard, and in many cases even more so, was the work of the gas\r\nofficers on Division, Corps and Army Staffs, who handled the training\r\nin Divisions, and who also were required to recommend the use of gas\r\ntroops, the use of gas in artillery shell and in grenades, and the\r\nuse of smoke by the infantry in attack. However, the success of the\r\nChemical Warfare Service in the field with these Staff officers was\r\njust as great as with the Regiment.\r\n\r\nTo the everlasting credit of those Staff Officers and the Officers of\r\nthe Gas Regiment from Colonel Atkisson down, both Staff Gas officers\r\nand officers of the Gas Regiment worked together in the fullest harmony\r\nwith the single object of defeating the Germans.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL WARFARE TROOPS\r\n\r\nChemical Warfare troops were divided into two distinct divisions—gas\r\nregiments and staff troops.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.—Firing a 155-Millimeter Howitzer.\r\n\r\nThe men are wearing gas masks to keep out the enemy gas fired at them\r\nin Oct., 1918.]\r\n\r\n=Staff Troops.= The staff troops of the Chemical Warfare Service\r\nperformed all work required of gas troops except that of actual\r\nfighting. They handled all Chemical Warfare Service supplies from\r\nthe time they were unloaded from ships to the time they were issued\r\nto the fighting troops at the front, whether the fighting troops\r\nwere Chemical Warfare or any other. They furnished men for clerical\r\nand other services with the Army, Corps and Division Gas Officers,\r\nand they manufactured poisonous gases, filled gas shells and did all\r\nrepairing and altering of gas masks. Though these men received none of\r\nthe glamour or glory that goes with the fighting men at the front, yet\r\nthey performed services of the most vital kind and in many cases did\r\nwork as dangerous and hair raising as going over the top in the face of\r\nbursting shell and screaming machine gun bullets.\r\n\r\nThink of the intense interest these men must have felt when carrying\r\nfrom the field of battle to the laboratory or experimental field,\r\nshell loaded with strange and unheard of compounds and which might any\r\nmoment burst and end forever their existence! Or watch them drilling\r\ninto a new shell knowing not what powerful poison or explosive it might\r\ncontain or what might happen when the drill “went through”!\r\n\r\nAnd again what determination it took to work 12 or 16 hours a day way\r\nback at the depots repairing or altering masks, and, as was done at\r\nChateroux, alter and repair 15,000 masks a day and be so rushed that\r\nat times they had a bare day’s work of remodeled masks ahead. But they\r\nkept ahead and to the great glory of these men no American soldier ever\r\nhad to go to the front without a mask. And what finer work than that\r\nof these men who, in the laboratory and testing room, toyed with death\r\nin testing unknown gases with American and foreign masks even to the\r\nextent of applying the gases to their own bodies.\r\n\r\nHeroic, real American work, all of it and done in real American style\r\nas part of the day’s work without thought of glory and without hope of\r\nreward.\r\n\r\n=The First Gas Regiment.= In the first study of army organization made\r\nby the General Staff it was decided to recommend raising under the\r\nChief of Engineers one regiment of six companies of gas troops.\r\n\r\nShortly after the cable of August 17, 1917, was sent stating that\r\nLieut. Colonel Fries would be made Chief of the Gas Service, the War\r\nDepartment promoted him to be Colonel of the 30th Engineers which\r\nlater became the First Gas Regiment. At almost the same time, Captain\r\nAtkisson, Corps of Engineers, was appointed Lieut. Col. of the\r\nRegiment. Although Colonel Fries remained the nominal Commander of the\r\nregiment, he never acted in that capacity, for his duties as Chief of\r\nthe Gas Service left him neither time nor opportunity. All the credit\r\nfor raising, training, and equipping the First Gas Regiment belongs to\r\nColonel E. J. Atkisson and the officers picked by him.\r\n\r\nImmediately upon the formation of the Gas Service, the Chief urged\r\nthat many more than six companies of gas troops should be provided.\r\nThese recommendations were repeated and urged for the next two months\r\nor until about the first of November, when it became apparent that an\r\nincrease could not be obtained at that time and that any further urging\r\nwould only cause irritation. The matter was therefore dropped until a\r\nmore auspicious time should arrive. This arrived the next spring when\r\nthe first German projector attack against United States troops produced\r\nsevere casualties, exactly as had been forecasted by the Gas Service.\r\nAbout the middle of March, 1918, an increase from two battalions to\r\nsix battalions (eighteen companies) was authorized. A further increase\r\nto three regiments of six battalions each (a total of fifty-four\r\ncompanies) was authorized early in September, 1918, after the very\r\ngreat value of gas troops had been demonstrated in the fight from the\r\nMarne to the Vesle in July.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.—Receiving and Transmitting Data for Firing Gas\r\nShell while Wearing Gas Masks. Battlefield of the Argonne, October,\r\n1918.]\r\n\r\n=No Equipment for Gas Troops.= About the first of December a\r\ncablegram was received from the United States stating that due to\r\nlack of equipment the various regiments of special engineers recently\r\nauthorized, including the 30th (Gas and Flame) would not be organized\r\nuntil the spring of 1918. An urgent cablegram was then sent calling\r\nattention to the fact that gas troops were not service of supply troops\r\nbut first line fighting troops, and consequently that they should be\r\nraised and trained in time to take the field with the first Americans\r\ngoing into the line. At this same time the 30th regiment was given\r\nearly priority by the General Staff, A. E. F., on the priority lists\r\nfor troop shipments from the United States. The raising of the first\r\ntwo companies was then continued under Colonel Atkisson at the American\r\nUniversity in Washington.\r\n\r\nAbout January 15 word was received that the Headquarters of the\r\nregiment and the Headquarters of the First Battalion together with\r\nCompanies A and B of the 30th Engineers (later the First Gas Regiment)\r\nwere expected to arrive very soon. Some months prior General Foulkes,\r\nChief of the British Gas Service in the field, had stated that he would\r\nbe glad to have the gas troops assigned to him for training. It was\r\nagreed that the training should include operations in the front line\r\nfor a time to enable the American Gas Troops to carry on gas operations\r\nindependently of anyone else and with entire safety to themselves and\r\nthe rest of the Army.\r\n\r\nDue to the fact that the British were occupying their gas school,\r\nthe British General Headquarters were a little reluctant to take the\r\nAmerican troops Feb. 1. However, General Foulkes made room for the\r\nAmerican troops by moving his own troops out. He then placed his best\r\nofficers in charge of their training and at all times did everything\r\nin his power to help the American Gas Troops learn the gas game and\r\nget sufficient supplies to operate with. Colonel Hartley, Assistant to\r\nGeneral Foulkes, also did everything he could to help the American Gas\r\nService. These two officers did more than any other foreign officers in\r\nFrance to enable the Chemical Warfare Service to make the success it\r\ndid.\r\n\r\n=Second Battle of the Marne.= The Chief of the Gas Service, following\r\na visit to the British Gas Headquarters, and the Headquarters of the\r\nAmerican 2d Corps then operating with the British, arrived on the\r\nevening of July 17, 1918, at 1st Corps Headquarters at La Ferte sous\r\nJouarre about 10 miles southeast of Château-Thierry.\r\n\r\nTwo companies of the First Gas Regiment would have been ready in 48\r\nhours to put off a projector attack against an excellent target just\r\nwest of Belleau Wood had not the 2d battle of the Marne opened when\r\nit did. It is said that General Foch had kept this special attack so\r\nsecret that the First American Corps Commander knew it less than 48\r\nhours prior to the hour set for its beginning. Certainly the Chief of\r\nthe Gas Service knew nothing of it until about 9:00 P.M., the night of\r\nJuly 17th. Consequently the gas attack was not made. At that time so\r\nlittle was known of the usefulness of gas troops that they were started\r\non road work. At Colonel Atkisson’s suggestion that gas troops could\r\nclean out machine gun nests, he was asked to visit the First Corps\r\nheadquarters and take up his suggestion vigorously with the First Corps\r\nStaff.\r\n\r\n=Attacking Machine Gun Nests.= Thereupon the Gas troops were allowed\r\nto try attacking machine gun nests with phosphorus and thermite. This\r\nwork proved so satisfactory that not long afterwards the General Staff\r\nauthorized an increase in gas troops from 18 companies to 54 companies,\r\nto be formed into three regiments of two battalions each. The 6\r\ncompanies in France did excellent work with smoke and thermite during\r\nall the second battle of the Marne to the Vesle river, where by means\r\nof smoke screens they made possible the crossing of that river and the\r\ngaining of a foothold on the north or German side.\r\n\r\nWith the assembling of American troops in the sector near Verdun in\r\nSeptember, 1918, the gas troops were all collected there with the\r\nexception of one or two companies and took a very active part in\r\nthe capture of the St. Mihiel salient. It was at this battle that\r\nthe Chemical Warfare Service really began to handle offensive gas\r\noperations in the way they should be handled. Plans were drawn for\r\nthe use of gas and smoke by artillery and gas troops both. The use of\r\nhigh explosives in Liven’s bombs was also planned. Those plans were\r\nproperly co-ordinated with all the other arms of the service in making\r\nthe attack. Gas was to be used not alone by gas troops but by the\r\nartillery. Plans were made so that the different kinds of gases would\r\nbe used where they would do the most good. While these plans and their\r\nexecution were far from perfect, they marked a tremendous advance and\r\ndemonstrated to everyone the possibilities that lay in gas and smoke\r\nboth with artillery and with gas troops.\r\n\r\nFollowing the attack on the St. Mihiel salient, came the battle of the\r\nArgonne, where plans were drawn as before, using the added knowledge\r\ngained at St. Mihiel. The work was accordingly more satisfactory.\r\nHowever, the attempt to cover the entire American front of nine\r\ndivisions with only six companies proved too great a task. Practically\r\nall gas troops were put in the front line the morning of the attack.\r\nDue to weather conditions they used mostly phosphorus and thermite\r\nwith 4 inch Stokes’ mortars. Having learned how useful these were in\r\ntaking machine gun nests, plans were made to have them keep right up\r\nwith the Infantry. This they did in a remarkable manner considering the\r\nweight of the Stokes’ mortar and the base plates and also that each\r\nStokes’ mortar bomb weighed about 25 pounds. There were cases where\r\nthey carried these mortars and bombs for miles on their backs, while in\r\nother cases they used pack animals.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.—Setting Up a Smoke Barrage with Smoke Pots.]\r\n\r\nNot expecting the battle to be nearly continuous as it was for three\r\nweeks, the men, as before stated, were all put in the front line\r\nthe morning of the attack. This resulted in their nearly complete\r\nexhaustion the first week, since they fought or marched day and night\r\nduring nearly the whole time. Taking a lesson from this, in later\r\nattacks only half the men were put in the line in the first place, no\r\nmatter if certain sectors had to be omitted. Fully as good results were\r\nobtained because, as the men became worn out, fresh ones were sent\r\nin and the others given a chance to recuperate. Officers relate many\r\ndifferent occurrences showing the discipline and character of these gas\r\ntroops. On one occasion where a battalion of infantry was being held up\r\nby a machine gun nest, volunteers were called for. Only two men, both\r\nfrom the gas regiment, volunteered though they were joined a little\r\nlater by two others from the same regiment, and these four took the\r\nguns. While it was not considered desirable for gas troops to attempt\r\nto take prisoners, yet the regiment took quite a number, due solely\r\nto the fact that they were not only with the advancing infantry but\r\nat times actually in front of it. On another occasion a gas officer,\r\nseeing a machine gun battalion badly shot up and more or less rattled,\r\ntook command and got them into action in fine shape.\r\n\r\nAt this stage the Second Army was formed to the southeast of Verdun\r\nand plans were drawn for a big attack about November 14. The value of\r\ngas troops was appreciated so much that the Second Army asked to have\r\nBritish gas troops assigned to them since no American gas troops were\r\navailable. Accordingly in response to a request made by the American\r\nGeneral Headquarters, the British sent 10 companies of their gas\r\ntroops. These reached the front just before the Armistice, and hence\r\nwere unable to carry out any attacks there.\r\n\r\nThis short history of the operations of the First Gas Regiment\r\ncovers only the high spots in its organization and work. It covers\r\nparticularly its early troubles, as those are felt to be the ones most\r\nimportant to have in mind if ever it be necessary again to organize\r\nC. W. S. troops on an extensive scale. The Regiment engaged in nearly\r\n200 separate actions with poisonous gases, smoke and high explosives,\r\nand took part in every big battle from the second battle of the Marne\r\nto the end of the War. They were the first American troops to train\r\nwith the British, and were undoubtedly the first American troops\r\nto take actual part in fighting the enemy as they aided the British\r\nindividually and as entire units in putting off gas attacks, in\r\nFebruary and March, 1918. It would be a long history itself to recite\r\nthe actions in which the First Gas Regiment took part and in which it\r\nwon distinction.[16]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: Story of the First Gas Regiment, James T. Addison.\r\nHoughton Mifflin Co., 1919.]\r\n\r\nNo better summary of the work of this Regiment can be written than that\r\nof Colonel Atkisson in the four concluding paragraphs of his official\r\nreport written just after the Armistice:\r\n\r\n    “The First Gas Regiment was made up largely of\r\n    volunteers—volunteers for this special service. Little\r\n    was known of its character when the first information\r\n    was sent broadcast over the United States, bringing\r\n    it to the attention of the men of our country. The\r\n    keynote of this information was a desire for keen,\r\n    red-blooded men who wanted to fight. They came into it\r\n    in the spirit of a fighting unit, and were ready, not\r\n    only to develop, but to make a new service. No effort\r\n    was spared to make the organization as useful as the\r\n    strength of the limited personnel allowed.\r\n\r\n    “The first unit to arrive in France moved to the\r\n    forward area within eight weeks of its arrival, and,\r\n    from that time, with the exception of four weeks, was\r\n    continuously in forward areas carrying on operations.\r\n    The third and last unit moved forward within six weeks\r\n    of its arrival in France, and was continuously engaged\r\n    until the signing of the Armistice.\r\n\r\n    “That the regiment entered the fight and carried the\r\n    methods developed into execution where they would be of\r\n    value, is witnessed by the fact that over thirty-five\r\n    percent of the strength of the unit became casualties.\r\n\r\n    “It is only fitting to record the spirit and true\r\n    devotion which prompted the officers and men who\r\n    came from civil life into this Regiment, mastered\r\n    the details of this new service, and, through their\r\n    untiring efforts and utter disregard of self, made\r\n    possible any success which the Regiment may have had.\r\n    It was truly in keeping with the high ideals which have\r\n    prompted our entire Army and Country in this conflict.\r\n    They made the motto of ‘Service,’ a real, living,\r\n    inspiring thing.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSUPPLY\r\n\r\nAs previously stated it was decided early that the Chemical Warfare\r\nService should have a complete supply service including purchase,\r\nmanufacture, storage and issue, and accordingly separate supply depots\r\nwere picked out for the Gas Service early in the fall by Col. Crawford.\r\nWhere practicable these were located in the same area as all other\r\ndepots though in one instance the French forced the Gas Service to\r\nlocate its gas shell and bomb depot some fifteen miles from the general\r\ndepots through an unreasonable fear of the gas.\r\n\r\n=Manufacture of Gases.= Due to the time required and the cost of\r\nmanufacturing gases, an early decision became imperative as to what\r\ngases should be used by the Americans, and into what shells and bombs\r\nthey should be filled. As there was no one else working on the subject\r\nthe sole responsibility fell upon the Chief of the Gas Service. The\r\nwork was further complicated by the fact that the British and French\r\ndid not agree upon what gases should be used. The British condemned\r\nviciously Vincennite (hydrocyanic acid gas with some added ingredients)\r\nof the French, while the French stated that chloropicrin, used by the\r\nBritish principally as a lachrymator, was worthless. Fries felt the\r\ntremendous responsibility that rested upon him and finally after much\r\nthought and before coming to any conclusion, wrote the first draft of\r\na short paper on gas warfare. In that paper he took up the tactical\r\nuses to which gases might be put and then studied the best and most\r\navailable gases to meet those tactical needs.\r\n\r\nWithout stating further details it was decided to recommend the\r\nmanufacture and use of chlorine, phosgene, chloropicrin, bromoacetone\r\nand mustard gas. As the gas service was also charged with handling\r\nsmoke and incendiary materials, smoke was prescribed in the proportion\r\nof 5 per cent of the total chemicals to be furnished. The smoke\r\nmaterial decided upon was white phosphorus.\r\n\r\nThe paper on Gas Warfare was then re-drafted and submitted to the\r\nFrench and British and written up in final form prescribing the gases\r\nabove mentioned on October 26. Following this a cable was drawn and\r\nsubmitted to the General Staff. After many conferences and some delay\r\nthe cable went forward on November 3.\r\n\r\n\r\n              CABLE 268, NOVEMBER 4, 1917\r\n\r\n    Paragraph 12. For chief of Ordnance. With reference to\r\n    paragraph 2 my cablegram 181, desire prompt information\r\n    as to whether recommendation is approved that phosgene,\r\n    chloropicrin, hydrocyanic acid, and chlorine be\r\n    purchased in France or England and filling plants\r\n    established in France for filling shells and bombs with\r\n    those gases.\r\n\r\n    Subparagraph A. Reference to your telegram 253,\r\n    recommend filling approximately 10 per cent all shells\r\n    with gases as given below, but that filling plants\r\n    and gas factories be made capable of filling a total\r\n    of 25 per cent. Unless ordinary name is given, gases\r\n    are designated by numbers in chemical code War Gas\r\n    investigations. Of 75 millimeter shells fill 1 per cent\r\n    Vincennite, 4 per cent phosgene or trichloromethyl\r\n    chloroformate, 2 per cent chloropicrin, 2½ per cent\r\n    mustard gas, ½ per cent with bromoacetone and ½ per\r\n    cent with smoke material. According to French 75\r\n    millimeter steel shells should not be filled with\r\n    Vincennite more than three months before being used.\r\n    No trouble with other gases or other sized shells\r\n    except that bromoacetone must be in glass lined shells.\r\n    Of 4.7 inch shells fill 5 per cent with phosgene\r\n    or trichloromethyl chloroformate, 2 per cent with\r\n    chloropicrin, 2½ per cent with mustard gas, ½ per cent\r\n    with bromoacetone and ½ per cent with smoke material.\r\n    Provide same percentage for all other shells up to and\r\n    including 8 inch caliber as for 4.7 inch shells. 4 inch\r\n    Stokes’ mortar will use same gases and smoke shells and\r\n    in addition thermit. 8 inch projector bombs will use\r\n    the same as the Stokes’ mortar and also oil to break\r\n    into flame on _bursting_. Cloud gas cylinders\r\n    will be filled with 50 or 60 per cent phosgene, mixed\r\n    with 40 to 50 per cent chlorine, or phosgene and some\r\n    other gas. Renew recommendation that filling plants be\r\n    established in France to provide sudden shifts in gas\r\n    warfare of all kinds, as well as for filling all 4 inch\r\n    Stokes’ mortar bombs, 8 inch projector bombs and cloud\r\n    gas cylinders. It is strongly recommended that efforts\r\n    be made to produce white phosphorus on large scale for\r\n    its usefulness both as smoke screens and to produce\r\n    casualties.\r\n\r\n    Subparagraph B. For the Adjutant General of the Army.\r\n    With reference to paragraph 2, my cablegram 181, desire\r\n    information as to whether recommendation is approved\r\n    that an engineer officer assisted by Professor Hulett\r\n    be assigned to Gas Service in Washington to handle all\r\n    orders and correspondence concerning gas.\r\n\r\n    Subparagraph C. For Surgeon General. With reference to\r\n    paragraph 2 your cablegram 205, and paragraph 2, my\r\n    cablegram 181, what is status of chemical laboratory\r\n    for France? Also have the 12 selected Reserve Officers\r\n    for training in gas defense sailed for France?\r\n\r\n    Subparagraph D. With reference to paragraph 17 your\r\n    cablegram 165 and paragraph 2 my cablegram 181,\r\n    Tissot has constructed simpler model of his mask for\r\n    attachment to any box. Have ordered 6 which will be\r\n    completed in two weeks, 3 of which will be forwarded\r\n    at once. A simple type such as this may prove useful\r\n    for large number of troops. Letter of permission to\r\n    manufacture Tissot masks being forwarded.\r\n\r\n    Subparagraph E. With reference to paragraph 8 your\r\n    cablegram 143, and paragraph 4 your cablegram 247, in\r\n    considering charcoal and other fillers for canister of\r\n    box respirator it should be remembered that the front\r\n    is very damp, the air being nearly saturated during\r\n    greater part of winter, fall and spring.\r\n\r\nThis cable is given in full to show that not later than November 4,\r\n1917, it was known in the United States not only what gases would be\r\nrequired but also in what shells, bombs, guns and mortars each would\r\nbe used. While a small quantity of Vincennite was recommended in this\r\ncable, another cable sent within a month requested that no Vincennite\r\nwhatever be manufactured. This decision as to gases and guns in which\r\nthey were to be used, while very progressive, proved entirely sound\r\nand remained unchanged, with slight exceptions due to new discoveries,\r\nuntil the end of the war. Without a thorough understanding of tactics a\r\nproper choice of gases could not have been made. This fact emphasizes\r\nthe necessity of having a trained technical army man at the head of any\r\ngas service.\r\n\r\nDue to the absence of a Chemical Warfare Service in the United States\r\nat this time, a very great deal of the information sent from France,\r\nwhether by cable or by letter, never reached those needing it.\r\n\r\n=Smoke.= About the first of December after a study of results obtained\r\nby the British and the Germans in the use of smoke in artillery shells\r\nfor screening purposes, the Gas Service decided that much more smoke\r\nthan had been stated in cable 268 to the United States was desirable.\r\nThe General Staff, however, refused to authorize any increase, but did\r\nallow to be sent in a cable a statement to the effect that a large\r\nincrease in smoke materials might be advisable for smoke screens, and\r\nthat accordingly the amount of phosphorus needed in a year of war would\r\nprobably be three or four times the one and a half million pounds of\r\nwhite phosphorus stated to have been contracted for by the Ordnance\r\nDepartment in the United States. This advanced position of the Gas\r\nService in regard to smoke proved sound in 1918, when every effort was\r\nmade to increase the quantity of white phosphorus available and to\r\nextend its use in artillery shells including even the 3 inch Stokes’\r\nmortar.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.—Troops Advancing Behind a Smoke Barrage\r\n(Phosphorus).]\r\n\r\n=Overseas Repair Section No. 1.= During the latter part of November,\r\n1917, Overseas Repair Section No. 1, under the command of Captain\r\nMayo-Smith, Sanitary Corps, with four other officers and 130 men,\r\narrived in France. Since mask development and manufacture in the United\r\nStates was still under the Medical Department, this mask repair section\r\nwas organized as a part of the Sanitary Corps. As there were at that\r\ntime no masks to be repaired and no laboratory equipment or buildings\r\nfor that purpose on hand and none likely to be for months to come,\r\nCaptain Mayo-Smith was assigned to duty under Colonel Crawford, Chief\r\nGas Officer with the Line of Communication, in Paris. A site for a mask\r\nrepair plant was located at Châteauroux, and a site for a gas depot at\r\nGievres was investigated. Inasmuch as there was at that time greater\r\nneed for men to learn the handling of poisonous gases than to repair\r\nmasks, some 40 or 50 of the company were put in gas shell filling\r\nplants at Aubervilliers and Vincennes in the suburbs of Paris, while\r\nlater still others were assigned to Pont de Claix near Grenoble. The\r\nremainder of the company were used in the Gas Depot at Gievres and in\r\nthe office in Paris.\r\n\r\nIt was not until the latter part of June, 1918, that the mask repair\r\nplant began operations. In the meantime these men did very valuable\r\nwork in shell filling and in learning the manufacture of gases.\r\nSeveral of them were sent to the United States, some of them remaining\r\nthroughout the war to aid in gas manufacture and in shell filling.\r\n\r\n=Construction Division, Gas Service.= The Construction Division\r\nunder Colonel Crawford in Paris made complete plans for phosgene\r\nmanufacturing plants, for shell filling plants and for the Mask Repair\r\nPlant. These plans included a complete layout of the work for all\r\npersons to be employed in the plants. During this same time a very\r\ncareful study of the possibilities for manufacturing gas for filling\r\nshell in France was made.\r\n\r\nFinally about March 1, in accordance with the strong recommendations\r\nof these men, Fries reported to General Pershing in person that the\r\nmanufacture of gas as well as the filling of shell in France was\r\ninadvisable from every point of view and accordingly he recommended\r\nthat gas manufacture and shell filling in France be given up. General\r\nPershing strongly approved the recommendation and a cablegram was at\r\nonce sent to the United States to that effect. The main reason for\r\nthis action was the lack of chlorine, since chlorine was the principal\r\ningredient of nearly all poisonous gases then in use. Chlorine takes,\r\nbesides salt, electric power and lots of it. Electric power requires\r\ncoal or water power. Neither of the latter sources were available in\r\nFrance. This question was gone into very thoroughly. The only place\r\nwhere power might have been developed was in a remote spot near Spain,\r\nand the outlook there was such that it appeared impossible to begin\r\nthe manufacture of chlorine under two years. On the other hand the\r\nshipment of chlorine from the United States required from 75 per\r\ncent to 100 per cent of the tonnage required to ship the manufactured\r\ngases themselves, to say nothing of the labor, raw materials, and the\r\nmachinery that would have had to be shipped in order to manufacture gas\r\nin France.\r\n\r\n=Mustard Gas.= As previously stated Mustard Gas was first used by the\r\nGermans against the British at Ypres on the nights of July 11 and 12,\r\n1917. It was not used much against the French until more than two\r\nmonths later. Indeed, gas was never used by the Germans to the same\r\nextent against the French as against the English. There are probably\r\ntwo reasons for this; first, the Germans had a deeper hatred for the\r\nBritish than the French; second, the British morale was higher than the\r\nFrench in 1917, and the German thought that if he could break down this\r\nBritish morale, he could win the war.\r\n\r\nThe first attack came as a surprise and accordingly got an unusually\r\nlarge number of casualties. As previously stated the casualties\r\nnumbered about 20,000 in about six weeks. This number was considered\r\nso serious that the beginning of the series of attacks against Ypres\r\nin the fall of 1917, was delayed by the British for 10 days or two\r\nweeks until they could study better how to avoid such great losses from\r\nmustard gas. While the composition of the gas was known within two or\r\nthree days, as well as the laboratory method by which it was first\r\nmanufactured by Victor Meyer in 1886, it took some 11 months to develop\r\nreliable and practical methods of manufacturing it on a large scale.\r\nThe Inter-allied Gas Conference in September, 1917, gave a great deal\r\nof attention to mustard gas and methods of combating it both from the\r\nview point of prevention and of curing those gassed by it.\r\n\r\nJust following the close of that conference a cable was sent to\r\nthe United States asking the possibility of manufacturing ethylene\r\nchlorhydrin, the principal element in the manufacture of mustard gas\r\nby the only process then known. Later, that is about the middle of\r\nOctober, a cablegram was sent urging investigation into the manufacture\r\nof this gas. It is believed a great deal of time might have been saved\r\nhad the policy of undue secrecy not been adopted by the British and\r\nothers before the Americans entered the war. In fact we were only told\r\nin whispers the formula for mustard gas, and where a description of it\r\ncould be found in German chemistries. This was arrant nonsense since if\r\nthe Germans had gotten all mustard gas information then in the hands\r\nof the British they would have received far less information than they\r\nalready possessed on mustard gas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.—“Who Said Gas?”]\r\n\r\nWhether the information sent to the United States on mustard gas\r\nultimately proved of any great value is an open question since the\r\nmethods adopted in the United States were very greatly superior to\r\nthose used in England and in France. It probably helped by suggestion\r\nrather than by actual details of design. Anyhow it all emphasizes the\r\ndifficulties encountered in war when so vital a substance as mustard\r\ngas must be investigated after the enemy has begun using it on a large\r\nscale.\r\n\r\n=Delay of British Masks.= As December 1 approached, and as nothing\r\nfurther had been heard of the order for 300,000 British Respirators\r\nplaced about the middle of October, a telegram was sent to England\r\nasking if deliveries would be made as required in the order for the\r\nmasks. This order required the first 75,000 to be delivered December 1,\r\n1917. In reply it was stated that the British could not furnish these\r\nmasks, and that they understood that the Americans were just beginning\r\na large output of masks in the United States. An exchange of cablegrams\r\nwith the United States showed that no masks could be expected from\r\nthere for 3 to 5 months. Moreover it became increasingly evident that\r\nthe Americans were going into the battle line sooner than at first\r\ncontemplated. Another cablegram was then sent to England urging the\r\ndelivery of these masks. The reply was to the effect that the English\r\nGovernment could not deliver the masks because they did not have enough\r\nfor their own use. This situation was very serious. Unless the order\r\nfor 300,000 masks placed with the British could be filled, we were\r\nfacing the necessity of sending American troops into the front line\r\nwith only the French M-2 mask. While the M-2 mask was then the only\r\nmask used by the French, it was well known to afford practically no\r\nprotection against the high concentrations of phosgene obtained from\r\ncloud or projector attacks. And it was just such attacks as these that\r\nour men would encounter in the front line during training. Accordingly\r\narrangements were made for a hurried trip to England.\r\n\r\nColonel Harrison of the British Royal Engineers was in charge of\r\nthe British manufacture of masks and it is desired here to express\r\nappreciation of his uniform courtesy and great helpfulness. He\r\nexhibited their methods and facilities and assured us they could meet\r\nany requirements of ours for masks up to a half million, or even more\r\nif necessary, provided they were given time to establish additional\r\nfacilities. Finally after a further exchange of cables the masks were\r\nobtained.\r\n\r\nDuring December, 1917 and January, 1918, when every effort was being\r\nmade to hurry a lot of masks from Havre—Havre being the British supply\r\nbase in France from which the masks were issued to the United States,\r\nthe severe cold and snow had so disorganized French traffic that it\r\nwas extremely difficult to get cars moving at all. In an effort to\r\nget the masks, priority of shipment was obtained and two or three\r\nofficers were assigned to convoy the cars. Notwithstanding convoying,\r\none carload of 4,000 masks, mainly threes and fours, became lost and\r\nonly turned up five weeks later. To make matters worse the British were\r\nsending us very many more of the small sized No. 2 masks than we could\r\nuse. The loss of this carload of 4,000 number threes and fours was all\r\nbut a tragedy. Indeed, in order to get the First Brigade of the First\r\nDivision equipped in time it was necessary to take a large number of\r\nmasks already issued to men of the Second Brigade. These masks were\r\nfirst thoroughly washed and disinfected and then re-issued.\r\n\r\nThis all emphasizes the great difficulties that are encountered when\r\na new and vital service must be organized in war 4,000 miles overseas\r\nwithout material, home supplies, or men to draw from. This struggle\r\nto get sufficient masks to keep all men fully equipped remained very\r\nacute until in July, 1918, when the arrival of hundreds of thousands\r\nof masks from the United States made the situation entirely safe. Even\r\nthen the necessity of weakening the elastics and shortening the rubber\r\ntubing of the mouthpieces on some 700,000 masks, doubled up our work\r\ntremendously, and added enormously to our troubles in getting masks to\r\nthe front in time.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these troubles the Chemical Warfare Supply Service\r\nnever failed and finally forged to the very forefront of all American\r\nsupply services. Its method of issuing supplies to troops at the front\r\nhas been adopted as the standard for American field armies of the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL\r\n\r\n=Gas Laboratory in Paris.= Early in January, 1918, the first members\r\nof the Chemical Service Section, National Army, under the command\r\nof Colonel R. F. Bacon, arrived in France and reported for duty.\r\nPreviously, a laboratory site at Puteaux, a suburb of Paris, had been\r\nselected. This plant had been built by a society for investigation\r\ninto tuberculosis. Previous to the arrival of the Chemical Service\r\nSection, information had been requested from the United States by cable\r\nas to the size of the laboratory section to be sent over. The reply\r\nstated that the number would probably total about 100 commissioned\r\nand enlisted. The site at Puteaux was accordingly definitely decided\r\nupon. Just following this decision two cables, one after the other,\r\ncame from the United States recommending certain specified buildings in\r\nParis for the laboratory. It was found upon investigation in both cases\r\nthat the buildings were either absolutely unsuited or unfinished. This\r\nwas another case of trying to fight a war over 4,000 miles of cable.\r\nColonel Bacon was made head of the Technical Division, which position\r\nhe held throughout the war.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.—Shaper for Opening Captured Gas Shell.]\r\n\r\n=Technically Trained Men.= In January, 1918, in response to a cable\r\nfrom the United States a request had been made on the French Government\r\nto send six of their ablest glass blowers to the United States to aid\r\nin making glass lined shells. The French Gas authorities said that it\r\nwould be impossible to send those or indeed any other men trained in\r\nthe manufacture or handling of poisonous gases or gas containers as\r\nthey did not have enough such men for their own work. Accordingly a\r\ncablegram was drafted and sent to the United States, requesting that\r\n50 men experienced in various lines of technical and chemical work be\r\nsent to France. The French authorities said they would put them in any\r\nfactories, laboratories or experimental places that the Chief of the\r\nGas Service desired. A second inquiry about these men was sent but\r\nnevertheless no answer was ever received and no men were sent.\r\n\r\n=Protection Against Particulate Clouds.= Just at this time, about the\r\nfirst of February, 1918, the danger that the Germans might devise some\r\nbetter method of sending over diphenylchloroarsine than by pulverizing\r\nit in high explosive shell was felt to be serious. The British had just\r\nthen perfected protection against diphenylchloroarsine by employing\r\nunsized sulfate wood pulp paper—48 to 60 layers being required. This\r\nnumber of layers was found to be necessary as they are very thin and\r\nporous. The British had developed a method of putting this paper around\r\na canister and yet keeping the canister small enough to fit into the\r\nknapsack by reversing its position therein; that is, putting the\r\ncanister in the compartment of the knapsack made for the face piece\r\nand putting the face piece in the other compartment. Some of our own\r\nofficers and enlisted men were sent to England to work with the British\r\non this and an order given them for 200,000 of the protected canisters.\r\nThey improved on the methods of the British and as it was found that\r\nsulfate paper was very scarce, investigations were made to see if any\r\nof it could be manufactured in France. Very soon thereafter such a\r\nplace was located near the city of Nancy. Following this a cablegram\r\nwas sent to the United States giving complete specifications for making\r\nthis diphenylchloroarsine protection. From this cablegram successful\r\nsamples were made though somewhat more bulky than those developed in\r\nEngland. Very few, however, of these were made in the United States\r\ndue, we were informed, to the poor quality of the sulfate paper. Work\r\nwas however begun energetically in the United States on other methods\r\nof protection against diphenylchloroarsine.\r\n\r\n=Numbers of Chemists Needed.= It was figured that out of a total force\r\nof some 1,400 gas officers there would be needed in the A. E. F.,\r\nexclusive of those in regiments, approximately 200 chemists, i.e.,\r\nabout 15 per cent of the whole. We arranged to have a good chemist on\r\neach Division, Corps and Army Staff, and a certain number with the gas\r\ntroops. It was proposed to put 20 to 40 in the laboratory in Paris and\r\nnot to exceed 20 at the experimental field. This subject of personnel\r\nis touched on for the reason that a few people seem to have the idea\r\nthat the Chemical Warfare Service should be made up of chemists\r\nexclusively. This is very far from being true. It was and is believed\r\nthat the Chemical Warfare Service should be composed of men from every\r\nwalk of life. In three positions out of every four in the field a good\r\npersonality combined with energy, hard work and common sense count for\r\nmore than mere technical training.\r\n\r\n=Hanlon (Experimental) Field.= As early as December 15, 1917, it\r\nwas decided that an experimental field in France was necessary, and\r\na letter was written to the General Staff requesting authority to\r\nestablish one. After considerable delay the authority was granted and\r\nsearch for a site begun. This was no easy task. While the French were\r\nloading millions of gas shells at the edge of Paris, they appeared\r\nunwilling at first to have us establish a gas experimental field\r\nexcept in abandoned or inaccessible spots. Finally a very good site\r\nwas found and agreed to by the French some 7 miles south of General\r\nHeadquarters. Just when we were ready to start work the French\r\ndiscovered that the proposed field included a portion of one of their\r\nartillery firing ranges. They then suggested another site within 3\r\nmiles of General Headquarters. This was a rather fortunate accident as\r\nthe site suggested was a better one than at first picked out. The field\r\nwas roughly rectangular from 7 to 8 miles in length, and 3 to 4 miles\r\nin width. The total area was about 20 square miles. The work of this\r\nexperimental field proved a great success and was rapidly becoming the\r\nreal center of the Gas Service in France.\r\n\r\nThe old saying that the history of a happy country is very brief\r\napplies to this story of the Technical Section of the Gas Service in\r\nFrance. Its work did not begin as early as that of the other sections,\r\nand as considerable of it was of a nature that could be put off without\r\nimmediate fatal effects, the Section was enabled to grow without\r\nthe very serious drawbacks encountered by other Sections of the Gas\r\nService.\r\n\r\nNevertheless its usefulness was very great. Those of the Technical\r\nSection either at the experimental field or at the laboratory were\r\ncharged with the opening of all sorts of known and unknown gas and high\r\nexplosive shells, fuses and similar things to determine their contents\r\nand their poisonous or explosive qualities. This was work of a very\r\ntechnical nature, and at the same time highly dangerous.\r\n\r\nAs stated elsewhere, the determination of the life of the masks became\r\none of the problems which the laboratory was trying to solve. Hundreds\r\nof canisters were tested, and hundreds per month would have continued\r\nto have been tested throughout the remainder of the war had the war\r\ngone into 1919. It was on the Technical Section that devolved the duty\r\nof determining at the earliest possible moment the physical properties\r\nas well as the physiological effects of any new gas.\r\n\r\nAlso on that Section fell the preliminary reports as to the probable\r\nusefulness in war of a new gas whether sent over by the enemy or\r\nsuggested by our own Technical men, or those of our Allies. This\r\nwas indeed a task by itself, as it required a wide knowledge of the\r\nmethods of using gases, methods of manufacturing them, and methods of\r\nprojecting them on the field of battle.\r\n\r\nIn addition, it was the duty of the Technical Section to keep the\r\nChief of the Service fully informed on all the latest developments in\r\ngases and to get that information in shape so that the Chief with his\r\nincreasingly wide range of duties would be enabled to keep track of\r\nthem without reading the enormous amount ordinarily written.\r\n\r\nA much earlier start on technical work would have proved of immense\r\nadvantage. In case of another war, the technical side of chemical\r\nwarfare should be taken up with the very first expedition that proceeds\r\nto the hostile zone. Had that been done in France, we would have had\r\nmasks and gases and proper shells and bombs at least six months before\r\nwe did.\r\n\r\n\r\nINTELLIGENCE\r\n\r\nWhile Intelligence was for a long time under the Training or Technical\r\nDivisions, it finally assumed such importance that it was made a\r\nseparate Division. It was so thoroughly organized that by the time of\r\nthe Armistice the Chief of the Division could go anywhere among the\r\nUnited States forces down to companies and immediately locate the Gas\r\nIntelligence officer.\r\n\r\n=Intelligence Division.= This work was started by Lieutenant\r\nColonel Goss within a month after he reported in October, 1917. The\r\nIntelligence Division developed the publication of numerous occasional\r\npamphlets and also a weekly gas bulletin. So extensive was the work\r\nof this Division that three mimeograph machines were kept constantly\r\ngoing. The weekly bulletin received very flattering notice from the\r\nBritish Assistant Chief of Gas Service in the Field. He stated that it\r\ncontained a great deal of information he was unable to get from any\r\nother source.\r\n\r\nAmong other work undertaken by this Intelligence Division was the\r\ncompilation of a History of the Chemical Warfare Service in France.\r\nThis alone involved a lot of work. In order that this history might\r\nbe truly representative, about three months before the Armistice both\r\nmoving and still pictures were taken of actual battle conditions, as\r\nwell as of numerous works along the Service of Supplies.\r\n\r\nWithout going into further detail it is sufficient to say that when the\r\nArmistice was signed there were available some 200 still pictures, and\r\nsome 8,000 feet of moving picture films. Steps were immediately taken\r\nto have this work continued along definite lines to give a complete and\r\ncontinuous history of the Chemical Warfare Service in France in all its\r\nphases.\r\n\r\nThe intelligence work of the Gas Service, while parallel to a small\r\nextent with the General Intelligence Service of the A. E. F., had to\r\nspread to a far greater extent in order to get the technical details\r\nof research, manufacture, development, proving, and handling poisonous\r\ngases in the field. It included also obtaining information at the\r\nseats of Government of the Allies, as well as from the enemy and other\r\nforeign sources.\r\n\r\nThe most conspicuous intelligence work done along these lines was by\r\nLieutenant Colonel J. E. Zanetti, who was made Chemical Warfare liaison\r\nofficer with the French in October, 1917. He gathered together and\r\nforwarded through the Headquarters of the Chemical Warfare Service\r\nto the United States more information concerning foreign gases, and\r\nforeign methods of manufacturing and handling them, than was sent from\r\nall other sources combined. By his personality, energy and industry\r\nhe obtained the complete confidence of the French and British. This\r\nconfidence was of the utmost importance in enabling him to get\r\ninformation which could have been obtained in no other way. Suffice to\r\nsay that in the 13 months he was liaison officer with the French during\r\nthe war, he prepared over 750 reports, some of them very technical and\r\nof great length.\r\n\r\nAs a whole, the Intelligence Division was one of the most successful\r\nparts of the Chemical Warfare Service. Starting 2½ years after the\r\nBritish and French, the weekly bulletin and occasional papers sent\r\nout by the Chemical Warfare Service on chemical warfare matters came\r\nto be looked upon as the best available source for chemical warfare\r\ninformation, not alone by our own troops but also by the British.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEDICAL\r\n\r\nThe Medical Section of the Chemical Warfare Service was composed of\r\nofficers of the Medical Department of the Army attached to the Chemical\r\nWarfare Service. These were in addition to others who worked as an\r\nintegral part of the Chemical Warfare Service, either at the laboratory\r\nor on the experimental field in carrying out experiments on animals to\r\ndetermine the effectiveness of the gases.\r\n\r\nThe Medical Section was important for the reason that it formed the\r\nconnecting link between the Chemical Warfare Service and the Medical\r\nDepartment. Through this Section, the Medical Department was enabled to\r\nknow the kinds of gases that would probably be handled, both by our own\r\ntroops and by the enemy, and their probable physiological effects.\r\n\r\nColonel H. L. Gilchrist, Medical Department, was the head of this\r\nSection. It was through his efforts that the Medical Department\r\nrealized in time the size of the problem that it had to encounter in\r\ncaring for gas patients. Indeed, records of the war showed that out of\r\n224,089 men, exclusive of Marines, admitted to the hospitals in France,\r\n70,552 were suffering from gas alone. These men received a total of\r\n266,112 wounds, of which 88,980, or 33.4 per cent, were gas. Thus ⅓ of\r\nall wounds received by men admitted to the hospital were gas. While\r\nthe records show that the gas cases did not remain on the average in\r\nthe hospitals quite as long as in the case of other classes of wounds,\r\nyet gas cases became one of the most important features of the Medical\r\nDepartment’s work in the field.\r\n\r\nThe Medical Section, through its intimate knowledge of what was going\r\non in the Chemical Warfare Service as well as what was contemplated\r\nand being experimented with, was enabled to work out methods of\r\nhandling all gas cases far in advance of what could have been done\r\nhad there been no such section. One instance alone illustrates this\r\nfully. It became known fairly early that if a man who had been gassed\r\nwith mustard gas could get a thorough cleansing and an entire change\r\nof clothing within an hour after exposure, the body burns could\r\nbe eliminated or largely decreased in severity. This led to the\r\ndevelopment of degassing units. These consisted of 1,200 gallon tanks\r\non five-ton trucks equipped with a heater. Accompanying this were\r\nsprinkling arrangements whereby a man could be given a shower bath,\r\nhis nose, eyes and ears treated with bicarbonate of soda, and then be\r\ngiven an entire change of clothing. These proved a very great success,\r\nalthough they were not developed in time to be used extensively before\r\nthe war closed.\r\n\r\nThere is an important side to the Medical Section during peace, that\r\nmust be kept in mind. The final decision as to whether a gas should\r\nbe manufactured on a large scale and used extensively on the field of\r\nbattle depends upon its physiological and morale effect upon troops. In\r\nthe case of the most powerful gases, the determination of the relative\r\nvalues of those gases so far as their effects on human beings is\r\nconcerned is a very laborious and exacting job. Such gases have to be\r\nhandled with extreme caution, necessitating many experiments over long\r\nperiods of time in order to arrive at correct decisions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nCHLORINE\r\n\r\n\r\nChlorine is of interest in chemical warfare, not only because it was\r\nthe first poison gas used by the Germans, but also because of its\r\nextensive use in the preparation of other war gases. The fact that,\r\nwhen Germany decided upon her gas program, her chemists selected\r\nchlorine as the first substance to be used, was the direct result of an\r\nanalysis of the requirements of a poison gas.\r\n\r\nTo be of value for this purpose, a chemical must satisfy at least the\r\nfollowing conditions:\r\n\r\n    (1) It must be highly toxic.\r\n    (2) It must be readily manufactured in large quantities.\r\n    (3) It must be readily compressible to a liquid and yet\r\n        be more or less easily volatilized when the pressure\r\n        is released.\r\n    (4) It should have a considerably higher density than\r\n        that of air.\r\n    (5) It should be stable against moisture and other\r\n        chemicals.\r\n\r\nConsidering the properties of chlorine in the light of these\r\nrequirements, we find:\r\n\r\n    (1_a_) Chlorine is fairly toxic, though its lethal\r\n      concentration (2.5 milligrams per liter of air) is\r\n      very high when compared with some of the later gases\r\n      developed. This figure is the concentration necessary\r\n      to kill a dog after an exposure of thirty minutes. Its\r\n      effects during the first gas attack showed that, with\r\n      no protection, the gas was very effective.\r\n\r\n    (2_a_) Chlorine is very readily manufactured by\r\n      the electrolysis of a salt (sodium chloride) solution.\r\n      The operation is described below. In 100-pound\r\n      cylinders, the commercial product sold before the War\r\n      for 5 cents a pound. Therefore on a large scale, it can\r\n      be manufactured at a very much smaller figure.\r\n\r\n    (3_a_) Chlorine is easily liquefied at the\r\n      ordinary temperature by compression, a pressure of 16.5\r\n      atmospheres being required at 18° C. The liquid which\r\n      is formed boils at -33.6° C. at ordinary atmospheric\r\n      pressure, so that it readily vaporizes upon opening\r\n      the valve of the containing cylinder. Such rapid\r\n      evaporation inside would cause a considerable cooling\r\n      of the cylinder, but this is overcome by running\r\n      the outlet pipe to the bottom of the tank, so that\r\n      evaporation takes place at the end of the outlet pipe.\r\n\r\n    (4_a_) Chlorine is 2.5 times as heavy as air,\r\n      and therefore the gas is capable of traveling over a\r\n      considerable distance before it dissipates into the\r\n      atmosphere.\r\n\r\n    (5_a_) The only point in which chlorine does not\r\n      seem to be an ideal gas, is in the fact that it is a\r\n      reactive substance. This is best seen in the success of\r\n      the primitive protection adopted by both the British\r\n      and the French during the days immediately following\r\n      the first gas attack.\r\n\r\nAt first, however, chlorine proved a very effective weapon. During the\r\nfirst six months of its use, its value was maintained by devising new\r\nmethods of attack. When these were exhausted, phosgene was added (see\r\nnext chapter). With the decline in importance of cloud gas attacks, and\r\nthe development of more deadly gases, chlorine was all but discarded as\r\na true war gas, but remained as a highly important ingredient in the\r\nmanufacture of other toxic gases.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANUFACTURE IN THE UNITED STATES\r\n\r\nIt was at first thought that the existing plants might be able to\r\nsupply the government’s need of chlorine. The pre-war production\r\naveraged about 450 tons (900,000 pounds) per day. The greater amount\r\nof this was used in the preparation of bleach, only about 60,000\r\npounds per day being liquefied. Only a few of the plants were capable\r\nof even limited expansion. In an attempt to conserve the supply, the\r\npaper mills agreed to use only half as much bleach during the war,\r\nwhich arrangement added considerably to the supply available for war\r\npurposes. It was soon recognized that even with these accessions, large\r\nadditions would have to be made to the chlorine output of the country\r\nin order to meet the proposed toxic gas requirements.\r\n\r\nAfter a careful consideration of all the factors, the most important\r\nof which was the question of electrical energy, it was decided to\r\nbuild a chlorine plant at Edgewood Arsenal, with a capacity of 100\r\ntons (200,000 pounds) per day. The Nelson cell was selected for use\r\nin the proposed plant. During the process of erection of the plant,\r\nthe Warner-Klipstein Chemical Company, which was operating the Nelson\r\ncell in its plant in Charleston, West Virginia, agreed that men might\r\nbe sent to their plant to acquire the special knowledge required for\r\noperating such a plant. Thus when the plant was ready for operation,\r\ntrained men were at once available.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.—Chlorine Plant, Edgewood Arsenal.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.—Ground Plan of Chlorine Caustic Soda Plant,\r\nEdgewood Arsenal.]\r\n\r\nThe following description of the plant is taken from an article by S.\r\nM. Green in _Chemical and Metallurgical Engineering_ for July 1, 1919:\r\n\r\n“The chlorine plant building, a ground plan of which is shown in\r\nFigure 20, consisted of a salt storage and treating building, two\r\ncell buildings, a rotary converter building, etc. In connection with\r\nthe chlorine plant, there was also constructed a liquefying plant for\r\nchlorine and a sulfur chloride manufacturing and distilling plant.\r\n\r\n“The salt storage and treating building was located on ground much\r\nbelow the cell buildings, which allowed the railroad to enter the\r\nbrine building on the top of the salt storage tanks. These tanks were\r\nconstructed of concrete. There were seven of these tanks, 34 feet long,\r\n28 feet wide and 20 feet deep having a capacity for storing 4,000 tons\r\nof salt. There would have been 200 tons of salt used per day when the\r\nplant was running at full capacity.\r\n\r\n“On the bottom of each tank distributing pipes for dissolving-water\r\nsupply were installed, and at the top of each, at the end next to the\r\nbuilding, there was an overflow trough and skimmer board arranged so\r\nthat the dissolving-water after flowing up through the salt, overflowed\r\ninto this trough and then into a piping system and into either of two\r\ncollecting tanks. The system was so arranged that, if the brine was\r\nnot fully saturated, it could be passed through another storage tank\r\ncontaining a deep body of salt. The saturated brine was pumped from the\r\ncollecting tanks to any one of 24 treating tanks, each of which had a\r\ncapacity of 72,000 gallons.\r\n\r\n“The eighth storage bin was used for the storage of soda ash, used in\r\ntreating the saturated brine. This was delivered from the bin on the\r\nfloor level of the salt building to the soda ash dissolving tanks. From\r\nthese tanks it was pumped to any one of the 24 treating tanks. After\r\nthe brine was treated and settled, the clear saturated brine was drawn\r\nfrom the treating tanks through decanting pipes and delivered by pumps\r\nto any one of the four neutralizing tanks. These were located next\r\nto a platform on the level of the car body. This was to provide easy\r\nhandling of the hydrochloric acid, which was purchased at first, though\r\nlater prepared at the plant from chlorine and hydrogen. The neutralized\r\nbrine was delivered from the tanks by a pump to a tank located at a\r\nheight above the floor so that the brine would flow by gravity to the\r\ncells in the cell building.\r\n\r\n“There were to be two cell buildings, each 541 feet long by 82 feet\r\nwide, and separated by partitions into four sections, containing six\r\ncell circuits of 74 cell units. Each section is a complete unit in\r\nitself, provided with separate gas pump, drying and cooling equipment,\r\nand has a guaranteed capacity of 12.5 tons of chlorine gas per 24 hours.\r\n\r\n“Each Nelson electrolytic cell unit consists of a complete fabricated\r\nsteel tank 13 by 32 by 80 inches, a perforated steel diaphragm spot\r\nwelded to supporting angle irons, plate glass dome, fourteen Acheson\r\ngraphite electrodes 2.5 inches in diameter, 12 inches long and fourteen\r\npieces of graphite 4 by 4 by 17 inches, and various accessories.\r\n(The cell is completely described in _Chemical and Metallurgical\r\nEngineering_, August 1st, 1919.) Each cell is operated by a current\r\nof 340 amperes and 3.8 volts and is guaranteed to produce 60 pounds\r\nof chlorine gas and 65 pounds of caustic soda using not more than 120\r\npounds of salt per 24 hours, the gas to be at least 95 per cent pure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.—Interior View of the Cell Building.]\r\n\r\n“The salt solution from the cell feed tank, located in the salt\r\ntreating building, flows by gravity through a piping system located in\r\na trench running the length of each cell building, and is delivered to\r\neach cell unit through an automatic feeding device which maintains a\r\nconstant liquor level in the cathode compartment.\r\n\r\n“The remaining solution percolates from the cathode compartment through\r\nthe asbestos diaphragm into the anode compartment and flows from the\r\nend of the cell, containing from 8 to 12 per cent caustic soda, admixed\r\nwith 14 to 16 per cent salt, into an open trough and into a pipe in the\r\ntrench and through this pipe by gravity to the weak caustic storage\r\ntanks located near the caustic evaporator building.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.—Nelson Electrolytic Cell, showing the Interior\r\nArrangement of the Cell.]\r\n\r\n“The gas piping from the individual cell units to and including the\r\ndrying equipment is of chemical stoneware. The piping is so designed\r\nthat the gas can be drawn from the cells through the drying equipment\r\nat as near atmospheric pressure as possible in order that the gas can\r\nbe kept nearly free of air. When operating, the suction at the pump was\r\nkept at ¹/₂₀ inch or less. The quality of the gas was maintained at a\r\npurity of 98.5 to 99 per cent. The coolers used were very effective,\r\nthe gas being cooled to within one degree of the temperature of the\r\ncooling water, no refrigeration being necessary. The drying apparatus\r\nconsisted of a stoneware tower of special design containing a large\r\nnumber of plates, and thus giving a very large acid exposure. There\r\nwas practically no loss of vacuum through the drying tower and cooler.\r\nThe gas pumping equipment consisted of two hydroturbine pumps using\r\nsulfuric acid as the compressing medium. The acid was cooled by\r\ncirculation through a double pipe cooler similar to those used in\r\nrefrigerating work. The gas was delivered under about five pounds\r\npressure into large receiving tanks located just outside the pump\r\nrooms, and from these tanks into steel pipe mains which conducted the\r\ngas to the chemical plant.”\r\n\r\nThe purity of the gas was such that it was not found necessary to\r\nliquefy it for the preparation of phosgene.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPERTIES\r\n\r\nChlorine, at ordinary atmospheric pressure and temperature, is a\r\ngreenish yellow gas (giving rise to its name), which has a very\r\nirritating effect upon the membranes of the nose and throat. As\r\nmentioned above, at a pressure of 16.5 atmospheres at 18° C., chlorine\r\nis condensed to a liquid. If the gas is first cooled to 0°, the\r\npressure required for condensation is decreased to 3.7 atmospheres.\r\nThis yellow liquid has a boiling point of -33.6° C. at the ordinary\r\npressure. If very strongly cooled, chlorine will form a pale yellow\r\nsolid (at -102° C.). Chlorine is 2.5 times as heavy as air, one liter\r\nweighing 3.22 grams. 215 volumes of chlorine gas will dissolve in 100\r\nvolumes of water at 20°. It is very slightly soluble in hot water or in\r\na concentrated solution of salt.\r\n\r\nChlorine is a very reactive substance and is found in combination in a\r\nlarge number of compounds. Among the many reactions which have proved\r\nimportant from the standpoint of chemical warfare, the following may be\r\nmentioned:\r\n\r\nChlorine reacts with “hypo” (sodium thiosulfate) with the formation of\r\nsodium chloride. Hypo is able to transform a large amount of chlorine,\r\nso that it proved a very satisfactory impregnating agent for the early\r\ncloth masks.\r\n\r\nWater reacts with chlorine under certain conditions to form\r\nhypochlorous acid, HOCl. In the presence of ethylene, this forms\r\nethylene chlorhydrin, which was the basis for the first method of\r\npreparing mustard gas. In the later method, in which sulfur chloride\r\nwas used, chlorine was used in the manufacture of the chloride.\r\n\r\nChlorine reacts with carbon monoxide, in the sunlight, or in the\r\npresence of a catalyst, to form phosgene, which is one of the most\r\nvaluable of the toxic gases.\r\n\r\nChlorine and acetone react to form chloroacetone, one of the early\r\nlachrymators. The reaction of chlorine with toluene forms benzyl\r\nchloride, an intermediate in the preparation of bromobenzylcyanide.\r\n\r\nIn a similar way, it is found that the greater number of toxic gases\r\nuse chlorine in one phase or another of their preparation. One author\r\nhas estimated that 95 per cent of all the gases used may be made\r\ndirectly or indirectly by the use of chlorine.\r\n\r\nChlorine has been used in connection with ammonia and water vapor\r\nfor the production of smoke clouds. The ammonium chloride cloud thus\r\nproduced is one of the best for screening purposes. In combination\r\nwith silicon or titanium as the tetrachloride it has also been used\r\nextensively for the same purpose.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand one may feel that, whatever bad reputation chlorine\r\nmay have incurred as a poison gas, it has made up for it through the\r\nbeneficial applications to which it has lent itself. Among these we may\r\nmention the sterilization of water and of wounds.\r\n\r\nIn war, where stationary conditions prevail only in a small number\r\nof cases, the use of liquid chlorine for sterilization of water is\r\nimpractical. To meet this condition, an ampoule filled with chlorine\r\nwater of medium concentration has been developed, which furnishes a\r\ngood portable form of chlorine as a sterilizing agent for relatively\r\nsmall quantities of water.\r\n\r\nChlorine has also been applied, in the form of hypochlorite, to the\r\nsterilization of infected wounds. The preparation of the solution and\r\nthe technique of the operation were worked out by Dakin and Carrel.\r\nThis innovation in war surgery has decreased enormously the percentage\r\nof deaths from infected wounds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nPHOSGENE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first cloud attack, in which pure chlorine was used, was very\r\neffective, but only because the troops attacked with it were entirely\r\nunprotected. Later, in spite of the varied methods of attack, the\r\nresults were less and less promising, due to the increased protection\r\nof the men and also to the gas discipline which was gradually being\r\ndeveloped. During this time the Allies had started their gas attacks\r\n(Sept., 1915), and it soon became evident that, if Germany was to keep\r\nher supremacy in gas warfare, new gases or new tactics would have to be\r\nintroduced.\r\n\r\nThe second poison gas was used in December, 1915, when about 20-25\r\nper cent of phosgene was mixed with the chlorine. Here again the\r\nGermans made use of an industry already established. Phosgene is used\r\ncommercially in the preparation of certain dyestuffs, especially methyl\r\nviolet, and was manufactured before and during the war by the Bayer\r\nCompany and the Badische Anilin und Soda Fabrik.\r\n\r\nPhosgene can not be used alone in gas cylinders because of its high\r\nboiling point (8° C.). While this is considerably below ordinary\r\ntemperatures, especially during the summer months, the rate of\r\nevaporation is so slow that a cloud attack could never be made with it\r\nalone. However, when a mixture of 25 per cent phosgene and 75 per cent\r\nchlorine, or 50 per cent phosgene and 50 per cent chlorine is used in\r\nwarm weather there is no difficulty in carrying out gas attacks from\r\ncylinders. At the same time the percentage of phosgene in the mixture\r\nis sufficiently high to secure the advantages which it possesses. These\r\nadvantages are at least three:\r\n\r\n(_a_) Phosgene is more toxic than chlorine. It requires 2.5 milligrams\r\nper liter of chlorine to kill a dog on an exposure of 30 minutes, but\r\n0.3 milligram of phosgene will have the same effect. This of course\r\nmeans that a cloud of phosgene containing one-eighth (by weight) of the\r\nconcentration of a chlorine cloud will have the same lethal properties.\r\n\r\n(_b_) Phosgene is much less reactive than chlorine, so that the matter\r\nof protection becomes more difficult. Fortunately, word was received\r\nby the British of the intended first use of phosgene against them\r\nand consequently they were able to add hexamethylenetetramine to the\r\nimpregnating solution used in the cloth masks.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The third, and a very important, factor in the use of phosgene is\r\nthe so-called delayed effect. In low concentrations, men may breathe\r\nphosgene for some time with apparently no ill effects. Ten or twelve\r\nhours later, or perhaps earlier if they attempt any work, the men\r\nbecome casualties.\r\n\r\nPure phosgene has been used in projector attacks (described in Chapter\r\nII). The substance has also been used in large quantities in shell;\r\nthe Germans also used shell containing mixtures with superpalite\r\n(trichloromethyl chloroformate) or sneezing gas (diphenylchloroarsine).\r\n\r\n\r\nMANUFACTURE\r\n\r\nPhosgene was first prepared by John Davy in 1812, by exposing a\r\nmixture of equal volumes of carbon monoxide and chlorine to sunlight;\r\nDavy coined the name “phosgene” from the part played by light in the\r\nreaction. While phosgene may be prepared in the laboratory by a number\r\nof other reactions, it was quite apparent that the first mentioned\r\nreaction is the most economical of these for large scale production.\r\nThe reaction is a delicate one, however, and its application required\r\nextended investigation.\r\n\r\nThe United States was fortunate in that, for some months previous to\r\nthe war, the Oldbury Electrochemical Company had been working on the\r\nutilization of their waste carbon monoxide in making phosgene. The\r\nresults of these investigations were given to the government and aided\r\nconsiderably in the early work on phosgene at the Edgewood plant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.—Furnace for Generating Carbon Monoxide.]\r\n\r\nOf the raw materials necessary for the manufacture of phosgene, the\r\nchlorine was provided, at first by purchase from private plants, but\r\nlater through the Edgewood chlorine plant. After a sufficient supply of\r\nchlorine was assured the next question was how to obtain an adequate\r\nsupply of carbon monoxide. A method for this gas had not been developed\r\non a large scale because it had never been necessary to make any\r\nconsiderable quantity of it. The French and English passed oxygen up\r\nthrough a gas producer filled with coke; the oxygen combines with the\r\ncarbon, giving carbon monoxide. The oxygen was obtained from liquid\r\nair, for which a Claude liquid air machine may be used. The difficulty\r\nwith this method of preparing carbon monoxide was that the amount of\r\nheat generated was so great that the life of the generators was short.\r\nOur engineers conceived the idea of using a mixture of carbon dioxide\r\nand oxygen. The union of carbon dioxide with carbon to form carbon\r\nmonoxide is a reaction in which heat is absorbed. Therefore by using\r\nthe mixture of the two gases, the heat of the one reaction was absorbed\r\nby the second reaction. In this way a very definite temperature could\r\nbe maintained, and the production of carbon monoxide was greatly\r\nincreased.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.—Catalyzer Boxes Used in the Manufacture of\r\nPhosgene.]\r\n\r\nCarbon dioxide was prepared by the combustion of coke. The gas was\r\nwashed and then passed into a solution of potassium carbonate. Upon\r\nheating, this evolved carbon dioxide.\r\n\r\nPhosgene was then prepared by passing the mixture of carbon monoxide\r\nand chlorine into catalyzer boxes (8 feet long, 2 feet 9 inches deep\r\nand 11 inches wide), which are made of iron, lined with graphite and\r\nfilled with a porous form of carbon. Two sets of these boxes were used.\r\nIn the first the reaction proceeds at room temperature, and is about\r\n80 per cent complete. The second set of boxes were kept immersed in\r\ntanks filled with hot water, and there the reaction is completed.\r\n\r\nThe resulting phosgene was dried with sulfuric acid and then condensed\r\nby passing it through lead pipes surrounded by refrigerated brine.\r\n\r\nThe Germans prepared their phosgene by means of a prepared charcoal\r\n(wood or animal). Carbon monoxide was manufactured by passing carbon\r\ndioxide over wood charcoal contained in gas-fired muffles and was\r\nwashed by passing through sodium hydroxide. This was mixed with\r\nchlorine and the mixture passed downward through a layer of about 20\r\ncm. of prepared charcoal contained in a cast iron vessel 80 cm. in\r\ndiameter and 80 cm. deep. By regulating the mixture so that there was\r\na slight excess of carbon monoxide, the phosgene was obtained with\r\nonly one-quarter of one per cent free chlorine. The charcoal (wood)\r\nwas prepared by washing with hydrochloric and other acids until free\r\nfrom soluble ash; it was then washed with water and dried in vacuum.\r\nThe size of the granules was about one-quarter inch mesh. Their life\r\naveraged about six months.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPERTIES\r\n\r\nPhosgene is a colorless gas at room temperatures, but becomes a liquid\r\nat 8°. The odor of phosgene is suggestive of green corn or musty hay.\r\nOne liter of phosgene vapor weighs 4.4 grams (chlorine weights 3.22\r\ngrams). At 0° C., the liquid is heavier than water, having a specific\r\ngravity of 1.432. At 25°, the vapor exerts a pressure of about 25\r\npounds per square inch. Phosgene is absorbed by solid materials,\r\nsuch as pumice stone and celite. Pumice stone absorbs more than its\r\nown weight of phosgene. Thus 5.7 grams of pumice absorbed 7.4 grams\r\nphosgene, which completely evaporated in 60 minutes. German shell\r\nhave been found which contained such a mixture (phosgene and pumice\r\nstone). While the apparent reason for their use is to prevent the rapid\r\nevaporation of the phosgene, it is a question whether such is the case,\r\nfor a greater surface is really present in the case of pumice stone\r\nthan where the phosgene is simply on the ground. Phosgene is slowly\r\ndecomposed by cold water, rapidly by hot water. This reaction is\r\nimportant because there is always moisture in the air, which would tend\r\nto lower the concentration of the gas.\r\n\r\nPhosgene is absorbed and decomposed by hexamethylenetetramine\r\n(urotropine). This reaction furnished the basis of the first protection\r\nused by the British. Later the catalytic decomposition of phosgene\r\ninto carbon dioxide and hydrochloric acid by the charcoal in the mask\r\nfurnished protection.\r\n\r\nFor most purposes a trace of chlorine in phosgene is not a\r\ndisadvantage; for example, when it is used in cylinders or projectors.\r\nUnder certain conditions, as when used as a solvent for sneezing gas,\r\nthe presence of chlorine must be avoided, since it reacts with the\r\nsubstance in solution, usually producing a harmless material. Chlorine\r\nmay be removed from phosgene by passing the mixture through cotton seed\r\noil.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTECTION\r\n\r\nIt was mentioned above that hexamethylenetetramine (urotropine) was\r\nused in the early pads (black veil and similar masks) and flannel\r\nhelmets. This was found to be satisfactory against chlorine and\r\nphosgene, in the concentrations usually found during a cylinder attack.\r\nThe mixture used consisted of urotropine, sodium thiosulfate (“hypo”),\r\nsodium carbonate and glycerine. The glycerine tended to keep the pads\r\nmoist, while the other chemicals acted as protective agents against the\r\nmixture of phosgene and chlorine.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the Standard Box Respirator with its charcoal-soda\r\nlime filling increased very materially the protection against phosgene.\r\nIn this filling, the charcoal both absorbs the phosgene and catalyzes\r\nthe reaction with the moisture of the air with which the phosgene is\r\nmixed, to form hydrochloric acid and carbon dioxide. Soda-lime absorbs\r\nphosgene but does not catalyze its decomposition. This shows the\r\nadvantage of the mixture, since the hydrochloric acid, which is formed\r\nthrough the action of the charcoal, is absorbed by the soda-lime.\r\nExperiments seem to indicate that it does not matter which material\r\nis placed in the bottom of the canister, but that an intimate mixture\r\nis the best arrangement. Using a concentration of 5,000 parts per\r\nmillion (20.2 mg. per liter) a type _H_ canister (see page 217) will\r\ngive complete protection for about 40 minutes; when the air-gas mixture\r\npasses at the rate of 16 liters per minute the efficiency or life of a\r\ncanister increases with a decrease in temperature, as is seen in the\r\nfollowing table (the concentration was 5,000 parts per million, the\r\nrate of flow 16 liters per minute)\r\n\r\n    Temperature       Efficiency\r\n       ° C.        (Time in minutes)\r\n        -10               223\r\n          0               172\r\n         10               146\r\n         20               130\r\n         30               125\r\n         40                99\r\n\r\nFrom these figures it is seen that at -10° C. the life is about 50 per\r\ncent greater than at summer temperature. As would be expected the life\r\nof a canister is shortened by increasing the concentration of phosgene\r\nin the phosgene air mixture. This is illustrated by the following\r\nfigures:\r\n\r\n    Concentration          Life\r\n       p.p.m.        (Time in minutes)\r\n\r\n        5,000               177\r\n       10,000               112\r\n       15,000                72\r\n       20,000                58\r\n       25,000                25\r\n\r\n    (25,000 p.p.m. is equal to 101.1 mg. per liter.)\r\n\r\nThere is rather a definite relation between the concentration of the\r\ngas and the life of a canister at any given rate of flow. Many of these\r\nrelations have been expressed by formulas of which the following is\r\ntypical. At 32 liters per minute flow, =C⁰˙⁹ × Tb = 101,840=, in which\r\n=C= is the concentration and =T= the time.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHELL FILLING\r\n\r\nThe empty shell, after inspection, are loaded on trucks, together with\r\nthe appropriate number of “boosters,” which screw into the top of the\r\nshell and thereby close them. The trucks are run by an electric storage\r\nbattery locomotive to the filling unit. The shell are transferred by\r\nhand to a conveyor, which carries the shell slowly through a cold room.\r\nDuring this passage of about 30 minutes, the shell are cooled to about\r\n0° F. The cooled shell are transferred to shell trucks, each truck\r\ncarrying 6 shell. These trucks are drawn through the filling tunnel by\r\nmeans of a chain haul operated by an air motor to the filling machine.\r\nHere the liquid phosgene is run into the shell by automatic machines,\r\nso arranged that the 6 shell are at the same time automatically filled\r\nto a constant void. The truck then carries the filled shell forward a\r\nfew feet to a small window, at which point the boosters are inserted\r\ninto the nose of the shell by hand. The final closing of the shell is\r\nthen effected by motors operated by compressed air. The filling and\r\nclosing machines are all operated by workmen on the outside of the\r\nfilling tunnel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.—Filling Livens’ Drums with Phosgene.]\r\n\r\nThe filled shell are conveyed to the shell dump, where they are stored\r\nfor 24 hours, nose down on skids, in order to test for leaks.\r\n\r\n\r\nTACTICAL USE\r\n\r\nPhosgene was first used in cloud attacks in December, 1915. These\r\nattacks continued for about nine months and were then gradually\r\nreplaced, to a large extent, by gas shell attacks. Phosgene was\r\nfirst found in German projectiles in November, 1916. These shell\r\nwere known as the D-shell. Besides pure phosgene, mixtures of\r\nphosgene and chloropicrin, phosgene and superpalite, and phosgene and\r\ndiphenylchloroarsine have been found.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.—Interior of a Shell Dump.]\r\n\r\nThe English introduced the use of projectors in the Spring of 1917.\r\nThey have a decided advantage over shell in that they hold a larger\r\nvolume of gas and readily lend themselves to surprise attacks. As the\r\nGermans say, “the projector combines the advantages of gas clouds and\r\ngas shell. The density is equal to that of gas clouds and the surprise\r\neffect of shell fire is also obtained.”\r\n\r\nToward the close of the war, the Germans made use of a mixture of\r\nphosgene and pumice stone. A captured projector contained about\r\n13 pounds of phosgene and 5½ pounds of pumice. There seems to be\r\nsome question as to the value of such a procedure. Lower initial\r\nconcentrations are secured; this is due, in part of course, to the\r\nsmaller volume of phosgene in the shell containing pumice. Pumice does\r\nseem to keep the booster from scattering the phosgene so high into the\r\nair, and at the same time does not prevent the phosgene from being\r\nliberated in a gaseous condition. This would indicate that pumice gives\r\na more even and uniform dispersion and a more economical use of the gas\r\nactually used.\r\n\r\nOwing to its non-persistent nature (the odor disappears in from one and\r\na half to two hours) and to its general properties, phosgene really\r\nforms an ideal gas to produce casualties.\r\n\r\n\r\nACTION ON MAN\r\n\r\nPhosgene acts both as a direct poison and as a strong lung irritant,\r\ncausing rapid filling of the lungs with liquid. The majority of deaths\r\nare ascribed to the filling up of the lungs and consequently to the\r\nsuffocation of the patients through lack of air. This filling up of\r\nthe lungs is greatly hastened by exercise. Accordingly, all rules\r\nfor the treatment of patients gassed with phosgene require that they\r\nimmediately lie down and remain in that position. They are not even\r\nallowed to walk to a dressing station. The necessity of absolute quiet\r\nfor gassed patients undoubtedly partly accounts for the later habit of\r\ncarrying out a prolonged bombardment after a heavy phosgene gas attack.\r\nThe high explosive causes confusion, forcing the men to move about more\r\nor less and practically prevents the evacuation of the gassed. In the\r\nearly days of phosgene the death rate was unduly high because of lack\r\nof knowledge of this action of the gas. Due to the decreased lung area\r\nfor oxygenizing the air, a fearful burden is thrown on the heart, and\r\naccordingly, those with a heart at all weak are apt to expire suddenly\r\nwhen exercising after being gassed.\r\n\r\nAs an illustration of the delayed action of phosgene, a large scale\r\nraid made by one of the American divisions during its training is\r\nhighly illuminating.\r\n\r\nThis division decided to make a raid on enemy trenches which were\r\nsituated on the opposite slope of a hill across a small valley. Up\r\nstream from both of the lines of trenches was a French village in the\r\nhands of the Germans. When the attack was launched the wind was blowing\r\nprobably six or seven miles per hour directly down stream from the\r\nvillage, i.e., directly toward the trenches to be attacked. The usual\r\nhigh explosive box barrage was put around the trenches it was intended\r\nto capture.\r\n\r\nThree hundred Americans made the attack. During the attack a little\r\nmore than three tons of liquid phosgene was thrown into the village in\r\n75- and 155-millimeter shells. The nearest edge of the village shelled\r\nwith phosgene was less than 700 yards from the nearest attacking\r\ntroops. None of the troops noticed the smell of phosgene, although the\r\nfumes from high explosive were so bad that a few of the men adjusted\r\ntheir respirators. The attack was made about 3 A.M., the men remaining\r\nabout 45 minutes in the vicinity of the German trenches. The men then\r\nreturned to their billets, some five or six kilometers back of the\r\nline. Soon after arriving there, that is in the neighborhood of 9\r\nA.M., the men began to drop, and it was soon discovered that they were\r\nsuffering from gas poisoning. Out of the 300 men making the attack 236\r\nwere gassed, four or five of whom died.\r\n\r\nThe Medical Department was exceedingly prompt and vigorous in the\r\ntreatment of these cases, which probably accounted for the very low\r\nmortality.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most interesting cases of the delayed action that\r\nmay occur in gassing from phosgene. Here the concentration was slight\r\nand there is no doubt its effectiveness was largely due to the severe\r\nexercise taken by the men during and after the gassing.\r\n\r\nIt should be remarked in closing that while gas officers were not\r\nconsulted in the planning of this attack, a general order was shortly\r\nthereafter issued requiring that gas officers be consulted whenever gas\r\nwas to be used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nLACHRYMATORS\r\n\r\n\r\nWithout question the eyes are the most sensitive part of the body so\r\nfar as chemical warfare is concerned. Lachrymators are substances which\r\naffect the eyes, causing involuntary weeping. These substances can\r\nproduce an intolerable atmosphere in concentrations one thousand times\r\nas dilute as that required for the most effective lethal agent. The\r\ngreat military value of these gases has already been mentioned and will\r\nbe discussed more fully later.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of compounds which have some value as lachrymators,\r\nthough a few are very much better than all the others. Practically all\r\nof them have no lethal properties in the concentrations in which they\r\nare efficient lachrymators, though we must not lose sight of the fact\r\nthat many of them have a high lethal value if the concentration is of\r\nthe order of the usual poison gas. The lachrymators are used alone when\r\nit is desired to neutralize a given territory or simply to harrass the\r\nenemy. At other times they are used with lethal gases to force the\r\nimmediate or to prolong the wearing of the mask.\r\n\r\nA large number of the lachrymators contain bromine. In order to\r\nmaintain the gas warfare requirements, it was early decided that the\r\nbromine supply would have to be considerably increased. The most\r\nfavorable source of bromine is the subterranean basin found in the\r\nvicinity of Midland, Michigan. Because of the extensive experience of\r\nthe Dow Chemical Co. in all matters pertaining to the production of\r\nbromine, they were given charge of the sinking of seventeen government\r\nwells, capable of producing 650,000 pounds of bromine per year. While\r\nthe plant was not operated during the War, it was later operated to\r\ncomplete a contract for 500,000 pounds of bromine salts. They will be\r\nheld as a future war asset of the United States.\r\n\r\nThe principal lachrymators used during the War were:\r\n\r\n    Bromoacetone,\r\n    Bromomethylethylketone,\r\n    Benzyl bromide,\r\n    Ethyl iodoacetate,\r\n    Bromobenzyl cyanide,\r\n    Phenyl carbylamine chloride.\r\n\r\nChloropicrin is something of a lachrymator, but it has greater value as\r\na toxic gas.\r\n\r\n\r\nHALOGENATED KETONES\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest lachrymators used was bromoacetone. Because of\r\nthe difficulty of obtaining pure material, the commercial product,\r\ncontaining considerable dibromoacetone and probably higher halogenated\r\nbodies, was used. The presence of these higher bromine derivatives\r\nconsiderably decreased its efficiency as a lachrymator. The preparation\r\nof bromoacetone involved the loss of considerable bromine in the form\r\nof hydrobromic acid. This led the French to study various methods of\r\npreparation, and they finally obtained a product containing 80 per\r\ncent bromoacetone and 20 per cent chloroacetone, which they called\r\n“martonite.” As the war progressed, acetone became scarce, and the\r\nGermans substituted methylethylketone, for which there was little use\r\nin other war activities. This led to the French “homomartonite.”\r\n\r\nVarious other halogen derivatives of ketones have been studied in the\r\nlaboratory, but none have proven of as great value as bromoacetone,\r\neither from the standpoint of toxicity or lachrymatory power.\r\n\r\n_Bromoacetone_ may be prepared by the action of bromine (liquid or\r\nvapor) upon acetone (with or without a solvent). Aqueous solutions of\r\nacetone, or potassium bromide solutions of bromine, have also been used.\r\n\r\nPure bromoacetone is a water clear liquid. There are great differences\r\nin the properties ascribed to this body by different investigators.\r\nThis probably is due to the fact that the monobromo derivative is mixed\r\nwith those containing two or more atoms of bromine. A sample boiling at\r\n126-127° and melting at -54°, had a specific gravity of 1.631 at 0°. It\r\nhas a vapor pressure of 9 mm. of mercury at 20°.\r\n\r\nWhile bromoacetone is a good lachrymator, it possesses the disadvantage\r\nthat it is not very stable. Special shell linings are necessary, and\r\neven then the material may be decomposed before the shell is fired.\r\nThe Germans used a lead-lined shell, while considerable work has been\r\ncarried out in this country with enamel lined shell. Glass lined shell\r\nmay also be used. It is interesting to note that, while bromoacetone\r\ndecomposes upon standing in the shell, it is stable upon detonation.\r\nNo decomposition products are found after the explosion, and even\r\nunchanged liquid is found in the shell. It may be considered as having\r\na low persistency, since the odor entirely disappears from the surface\r\nof the ground in twenty-four hours.\r\n\r\nBromoacetone was also used by the Germans in glass hand grenades\r\n(Hand-a-Stink Kugel) and later in metal grenades. The metal grenades\r\nweighed about two pounds and contained about a pound and a half of the\r\nliquid.\r\n\r\n_Martonite_ was prepared by the French in an attempt more completely\r\nto utilize the bromine in the preparation of bromoacetone. They\r\nregenerated the bromine by the use of sodium chlorate:\r\n\r\n    NaClO₃ + 6HBr = NaCl + 3Br₂ + 3H₂O\r\n\r\nIn practice sulfuric acid is used with the sodium chlorate, so that the\r\nfinal products are sodium acid sulfate and a mixture of 20 per cent\r\nchloroacetone and 80 per cent bromoacetone, according to the reaction:\r\n\r\n    5(CH₃)₂CO + 4Br + H₂SO₄ + NaClO₃ =\r\n\r\n    4CH₂BrCOCH₃ + CH₂ClCO CH₃ + NaHSO₄ + 3H₂O.\r\n\r\nThis product is equally as effective as bromoacetone alone and is very\r\nmuch cheaper to manufacture. In general its properties resemble very\r\nclosely those of bromoacetone.\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMAN MANUFACTURE OF BROMOACETONE AND BROMOMETHYLETHYL KETONE[17]\r\n\r\nThese two products were prepared by identical methods. About two-thirds\r\nof the product produced by the factory was prepared from methylethyl\r\nketone which was obtained from the product resulting from the\r\ndistillation of wood. The method employed was to treat an aqueous\r\nsolution of potassium or sodium chlorate with acetone or methylethyl\r\nketone, and then add slowly the required amount of bromine. The\r\nequation for the reaction in the case of acetone is as follows:\r\n\r\n    CH₃COCH₃ + Br₂ = CH₂BrCOCH₃ + HBr\r\n\r\nTen kg.-mols of acetone or methylethyl ketone were used in a single\r\noperation. About 10 per cent excess of chlorate over that required\r\nto oxidize the hydrobromic acid formed in the reaction was used. The\r\nrelation between the water and the ketone was in the proportion of 2\r\nparts by weight of the former to 1 part by weight of the latter. For 1\r\nkg.-mol. wt. of the ketone, 10 per cent excess over 1 kg. atomic-weight\r\nof bromine was used.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: Norris, J. _Ind. Eng. Chem._, 11, 828 (1919).]\r\n\r\nThe reaction was carried out either in earthenware vessels or in\r\niron kettles lined with earthenware. The kettles were furnished with\r\na stirrer made of wood, and varied in capacity from 4,000 to 5,000\r\nliters. They were set in wooden tanks and cooled by circulating water.\r\nThe chlorate was first dissolved in the water and then the ketone\r\nadded. Into this mixture the bromine was allowed to run slowly while\r\nthe solution was stirred and kept at a temperature of from 30° to 40°\r\nC. The time required for the addition of the bromine was about 48 hrs.\r\nWhen the reaction was complete, the oil was drawn off into an iron\r\nvessel and stirred with magnesium oxide in the presence of a small\r\namount of water in order to neutralize the free acid. It was then\r\nseparated and dried with calcium chloride. At this point a sample of\r\nthe material was taken and tested. The product was distilled to tell\r\nhow much of it boiled over below 130° when methylethyl ketone had been\r\nused. If less than 10 per cent distilled over, the bromination was\r\nconsidered to be satisfactory. If, however, a larger percentage of low\r\nboiling material was obtained, the product was submitted to further\r\nbromination. The material obtained in this way was found on analysis to\r\ncontain slightly less than the theoretical amount of monobromoketone.\r\n\r\nIt was finally transferred by suction or by pressure into tank-wagons.\r\nAt first lead-lined tanks were used, but later it was found that tanks\r\nmade of iron could be substituted. In order to take care of the small\r\namount of hydrobromic acid, which is slowly formed, a small amount of\r\nmagnesium oxide was added to the material. The amount of the oxide used\r\nwas approximately in the proportion of 1 part to 1000 parts of ketone.\r\nWhen the magnesium oxide was used, it was found that the bromoketone\r\nkept without appreciable decomposition for about 2 months. The yield of\r\nthe product from 580 kg. of acetone (10 kg.-mol. wts.) was 1,100 kg.\r\nThe yield from 720 kg. of methylethyl ketone (10 kg.-mol. wts.) was\r\n1,250 kg.\r\n\r\n\r\nHALOGENATED ESTERS\r\n\r\nThe use of ethyl iodoacetate was advocated at a time when the price of\r\nbromine seemed prohibitive. Because of the relative price of bromine\r\nand iodine under ordinary conditions, it is not likely that it would\r\nbe commonly used. However, it is an efficient lachrymator and is more\r\nstable than the halogenated ketones, so that on a smaller scale it\r\nmight be advisable to use it.\r\n\r\nIt is prepared by the reaction of sodium iodide upon an alcoholic\r\nsolution of ethyl chloroacetate. It is a colorless oil, boiling at\r\n178-180° C. (69° C. at 12 mm.) and having a density of about 1.8. It is\r\nvery much less volatile than bromoacetone, having a vapor pressure of\r\n0.54 mm. of mercury at 20° C. Ethyl iodoacetate is about one-third as\r\ntoxic as bromoacetone, but has about the same lachrymatory value.\r\n\r\n\r\nAROMATIC HALIDES\r\n\r\n“Benzyl bromide” was also used during the early part of the war,\r\nusually mixed with bromoacetone. The material was not pure benzyl\r\nbromide, but the reaction product of bromine upon xylene, and should\r\nperhaps be referred to as “xylyl bromide.”\r\n\r\nPure benzyl bromide is a colorless liquid, boiling at 198-199° C., and\r\nhaving an odor reminiscent of water cress and then of mustard oil.\r\nThe war gas is probably a mixture of mono- and dibromo derivatives,\r\nboiling at 210-220° C., and having a density at 20° C. of 1.3. The\r\nmixture of benzyl and xylyl bromides used by the Germans was known as\r\n“T-Stoff,” while the mixture of 88 per cent xylyl bromide and 12 per\r\ncent bromoacetone was called “Green T-Stoff.”\r\n\r\nAs in the case of the halogenated acetones, it is necessary to use lead\r\nlined shell for these compounds. Enamel and glass lined shell may be\r\nused and give good results. While they are difficult of manufacture,\r\nsatisfactory methods were being developed at the close of the war.\r\n\r\n“T-Stoff” may be detected by the nose in concentrations of one part in\r\none hundred million of air, and will cause profuse lachrymation with\r\none part in a million. It is a highly persistent material and may last,\r\nunder favorable circumstances, for several days. While it is relatively\r\nnon-toxic, French troops were rendered unconscious by it during certain\r\nbombardments in the Argonne in the summer of 1915.\r\n\r\nA number of derivatives of the benzyl halides have been tested and\r\nsome have proven to be very good lachrymators. The difficulty of their\r\npreparation on a commercial scale has made it inadvisable to use them,\r\nand especially inasmuch as bromobenzyl cyanide has proven to be such a\r\nvaluable compound.\r\n\r\n\r\nBROMOBENZYL CYANIDE\r\n\r\nBromobenzyl cyanide is, chemically, α-bromo-α-tolunitrile, or\r\nphenyl-bromo-acetonitrile, C₆H₅CHBrCN. It is prepared by the action of\r\nbromine upon benzyl cyanide.\r\n\r\nBenzyl cyanide is prepared by the action of sodium cyanide upon a\r\nmixture of equal parts of 95 per cent alcohol and benzyl chloride. The\r\nbenzyl chloride in turn is obtained by the chlorination of toluene at\r\n100°. The material must be fairly pure in order that the benzyl cyanide\r\nreaction may proceed smoothly. The cyanide is subjected to a fractional\r\ndistillation and that part boiling within 3 degrees (the pure product\r\nboils at 231.7° C.) is treated with bromine vapor mixed with air.\r\nIt has been found necessary to catalyze the reaction by sunlight,\r\nartificial light or the addition of a small amount of bromobenzyl\r\ncyanide.\r\n\r\nThe product obtained from this reaction, if the hydrobromic acid which\r\nis formed is carefully removed by a stream of air, is sufficiently pure\r\nfor use as a lachrymator. It melts from 16 to 22° C., while the pure\r\nproduct melts at 29° C. It cannot be distilled, even in a high vacuum.\r\nIt has a low vapor pressure and thus is a highly persistent lachrymator.\r\n\r\nBromobenzyl cyanide is about as toxic as chlorine, but is many times\r\nas effective a lachrymator as any of the halogenated ketones or\r\naromatic halides studied. It has a pleasant odor and produces a burning\r\nsensation on the mucous membrane.\r\n\r\nLike the other halogen containing compounds, lead or enamel lined shell\r\nare necessary for preserving the material any length of time. In all of\r\nthis work the United States was at a very marked disadvantage. While\r\nthe Allies and the Germans could prepare substances of this nature and\r\nuse them in shell within a month, the United States was sure that shell\r\nfilled at Edgewood Arsenal probably would not be fired within three\r\nmonths. This means that much greater precautions were necessary, both\r\nas to the nature of the shell lining and as to the purity of the “war\r\ngas.”\r\n\r\nThe question of protection against lachrymatory gases was never a\r\nserious one. During the first part of the war this was amply supplied\r\nby goggles. Later, when the Standard Respirator was introduced, it was\r\nfound that ample protection was afforded against all the lachrymators.\r\nTheir principal value is against unprotected troops and in causing men\r\nto wear their masks for long periods of time.\r\n\r\nThe comparative value of the various lachrymators mentioned above is\r\nshown in the following table:\r\n\r\n    Bromobenzyl cyanide     0.0003\r\n    Martonite               0.0012\r\n    Ethyl iodoacetate       0.0014\r\n    Bromoacetone            0.0015\r\n    Xylyl bromide           0.0018\r\n    Benzyl bromide          0.0040\r\n    Bromo ketone            0.011\r\n    Choroacetone            0.018\r\n    Chloropicrin            0.019\r\n\r\nThe figures give the concentration (milligram per liter of air)\r\nnecessary to produce lachrymation. The method used in obtaining these\r\nfigures is given in Chapter XXI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nCHLOROPICRIN\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the spring of 1917, strange reports came from the Italian front\r\nthat the Germans were using a new war gas. This gas, while it did\r\nnot seem to be very poisonous, had the combined property of being a\r\nlachrymator and also of causing vomiting. Large number of casualties\r\nresulted through the men being forced to remove their masks in an\r\natmosphere filled with lethal gases. The gas had the additional and\r\nserious disadvantage of being a very difficult one to remove completely\r\nin the gas mask. The first American masks were very good when chlorine\r\nor phosgene was considered but were of no value when chloropicrin was\r\nused.\r\n\r\nOne of the interesting facts of chemical warfare is that few if any\r\nnew substances were discovered and utilized during the three years of\r\nthis form of fighting. Chlorine and phosgene were well known compounds.\r\nAnd likewise, chloropicrin was an old friend of the organic chemist.\r\nSo much so, indeed, that several organic laboratories prepared the\r\ncompound in their elementary courses.\r\n\r\nChloropicrin was first prepared by the English chemist, Stenhouse,\r\nin 1848, by the action of bleaching powder upon a solution of picric\r\nacid. This was followed by a careful study of its physical and chemical\r\nproperties, few of which have any connection with its use as a poison\r\ngas. The use of picric acid as an explosive made it very desirable that\r\nother raw materials should be used. Chloroform, which is the ideal\r\nsource theoretically (since chloropicrin is nitro-chloroform, Cl₃CNO₂),\r\ngave very poor yields. While it may be prepared from acetone, in fair\r\nyields, acetone was about as valuable during the war as was picric\r\nacid. Practically all the chloropicrin used was prepared from this acid\r\nas the raw material.\r\n\r\n\r\nMANUFACTURE\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of chloropicrin the laboratory method was adopted.\r\nThis consisted simply in passing live steam through a mixture of picric\r\nacid and bleaching powder. The resulting chloropicrin passes out of the\r\nstill with the steam. There was a question at first whether a steam\r\njacketed reaction vessel should be used, and whether stirrers should be\r\nintroduced. Both types were tested, of which the simpler form, without\r\nsteam jacket or stirrer, proved the more efficient.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.—Interior of Chloropicrin Plant.]\r\n\r\nThe early work was undertaken at the plant of the American Synthetic\r\nColor Company at Stamford, Connecticut. Later a large plant was\r\nconstructed at Edgewood Arsenal. At the latter place ten stills, 8 by\r\n18 feet, were erected, together with the necessary accessory equipment.\r\nThe following method of operation was used:\r\n\r\nThe bleach is mixed with water and stirred until a cream is formed.\r\nThis cream is then pumped into the still along with a solution of\r\ncalcium picrate (picric acid neutralized with lime). When the current\r\nof live steam is admitted at the bottom of the still, the temperature\r\ngradually rises, until at 85° C. the reaction begins. The chloropicrin\r\npasses over with the steam and is condensed. Upon standing, the\r\nchloropicrin settles out, and may be drawn off and is then ready for\r\nfilling into the shell. The yield was about 1.6 times the weight of\r\npicric acid used.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPERTIES\r\n\r\nChloropicrin is a colorless oil, which is insoluble in water, and which\r\ncan be removed from the reaction by distillation with steam. It boils\r\nat 112° C. and will solidify at -69° C. At room temperature it has a\r\ndensity of 1.69 and is thus higher than chloroform (1.5) or carbon\r\ntetrachloride (1.59). At room temperature it has a vapor pressure of\r\n24 mm. of mercury. It thus lies, in persistency, between such gases as\r\nphosgene on the one hand, and mustard gas on the other, but so much\r\ncloser to phosgene that it is placed in the phosgene group.\r\n\r\nChloropicrin is a very stable compound and is not decomposed by water,\r\nacids or dilute alkalies. The reaction with potassium or sodium\r\nsulfite, in which all the chlorine is found as potassium or sodium\r\nchloride, has been used as an analytical method for its quantitative\r\ndetermination. The qualitative test usually used consists in passing\r\nthe gas-air mixture through a heated quartz tube, which liberates free\r\nchlorine. The chlorine may be detected by passing through a potassium\r\niodide solution containing starch, or by the use of a heated copper\r\nwire gauze, when the characteristic green color is obtained.\r\n\r\nAn interesting physiological test has also been developed. The eye\r\nhas been found to be very sensitive to chloropicrin. The gas affects\r\nthe eye in such a way that its closing is practically involuntary. A\r\nmeasurable time elapses between the instant of exposure and the time\r\nwhen the eye closes. Below 1 or 2 parts per million, the average eye\r\nwithstands the gas without being closed, though considerable blinking\r\nmay be caused. Above 25 parts, the reaction is so rapid as to render\r\nproper timing out of the question. But with concentrations between 2\r\nand 25 parts, the subject will have an overpowering impulse to close\r\nhis eye within 3 to 30 seconds. The time may be recorded by a stop\r\nwatch and from the values thus determined a calibration curve may be\r\nplotted, using the concentration in parts per million and the time to\r\nzero eye reaction. Typical figures are given below. It will be noted\r\nthat different individuals will vary in their sensitivity, though the\r\norder is the same.\r\n\r\n    +--------+---------+---------+\r\n    | Conc.  |    A    |    B    |\r\n    | p.p.m. | Seconds | Seconds |\r\n    +--------+---------+---------+\r\n    |  20.0  |   4.0   |   5.0   |\r\n    |  15.0  |   5.4   |   5.4   |\r\n    |  10.0  |   7.5   |   7.5   |\r\n    |   7.5  |   9.0   |  10.0   |\r\n    |   5.0  |  13.0   |  15.0   |\r\n    |   2.5  |  18.0   |  30.0   |\r\n    +--------+---------+---------+\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.—Calibration Curve of Eyes for Chloropicrin.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTECTION\r\n\r\nBecause of the stability of chloropicrin, the question of protection\r\nresolves itself into finding an absorbent which is very efficient in\r\nremoving the gas from air mixtures. Fortunately such an agent was found\r\nin the activated charcoal used in the American gas mask. The removal of\r\nthe gas appears to take place in two stages. In the first, the gas is\r\nadsorbed in such a way that the long-continued passage of air does not\r\nremove it. In the second, the gas is absorbed, and this, really excess\r\ngas, is removed by pure air passing over the charcoal. The relation of\r\nthese two factors has an important bearing on the quality of charcoal\r\nto be used in gas masks. It appears that up to a certain point an\r\nincrease of the quality is desirable: beyond this, it is of doubtful\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nUnlike phosgene, chloropicrin is absorbed equally well at all\r\ntemperatures. Moisture on the other hand has a very decided effect.\r\nIt appears that charcoal absorbs roughly equivalent weights of\r\nchloropicrin and of water; the presence of water in the charcoal thus\r\ndisplaces an approximately equal amount of chloropicrin.\r\n\r\nIn the study of canisters it has been found that the efficiency\r\ntime is approximately inversely proportional to the concentration.\r\nFormulas have been calculated to express the relation existing between\r\nconcentration and life of the canister, and also between the rate of\r\nflow of the gas and the life.\r\n\r\nWhile water seems to have a decidedly marked effect upon the life of a\r\ncanister, this is not true of other gases, and the efficiency of the\r\ncanister for each gas is not decreased when used in a binary mixture.\r\n\r\n\r\nTACTICAL USES\r\n\r\nBecause of the high boiling point of chloropicrin it can only be used\r\nin shell. The German shell usually contained a mixture of superpalite\r\n(trichloromethyl chloroformate) and chloropicrin, the relative\r\nproportions being about 75 to 25. These were called Green Cross Shell,\r\nfrom the peculiar marking on the outside of the shell. Mixtures of\r\nphosgene and chloropicrin (50-50) have also been used.\r\n\r\nThe Allies have used a mixture of 80 per cent chloropicrin and 20 per\r\ncent stannic chloride (so-called N. C.). This mixture combines the\r\nadvantages of a gas shell with those of a smoke shell, since the\r\npercentage of stannic chloride is sufficiently high to form a very good\r\ncloud. In addition to this, it is believed that the presence of the\r\nchloride increases the rate of evaporation of the chloropicrin. It has\r\nbeen claimed that the chloride decreases the amount of decomposition\r\nof the chloropicrin upon the bursting of the shell, but careful\r\nexperiments appear to show that this decomposition is negligible and\r\nthat the stannic chloride plays no part in it. This mixture was being\r\nabandoned at the close of the war.\r\n\r\nThis N. C. mixture has also been used in Liven’s projectors and in\r\nhand grenades. The material is particularly fitted for hand grenades,\r\nowing to the low vapor pressure of the chloropicrin, and the consequent\r\nabsence of pressures even on warm days. As a matter of fact, it was the\r\nonly filling used for this purpose, though later the stannic chloride\r\nwas changed, owing to the shortage of tin, to a mixture of silicon and\r\ntitanium chlorides.\r\n\r\nWhile chloropicrin is sufficiently volatile to keep the strata of air\r\nabove it thoroughly poisonous, it is still persistent enough to be\r\ndangerous after five or six hours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nDICHLOROETHYLSULFIDE\r\n\r\n“MUSTARD GAS”\r\n\r\n\r\nThe early idea of gas warfare was that a material, to be of value as a\r\nwar gas, should have a relatively high vapor pressure. This would, of\r\ncourse, provide a concentration sufficiently high to cause casualties\r\nthrough inhalation of the gas-ladened air. The introduction of\r\n“mustard gas” (dichloroethylsulfide) was probably the greatest single\r\ndevelopment of gas warfare, in that it marked a departure from this\r\nearly idea, for mustard gas is a liquid boiling at about 220° C., and\r\nhaving a very low vapor pressure. But mustard gas has, in addition,\r\na characteristic property which, combined with its high persistency,\r\nmakes it the most valuable war gas known at the present time. This\r\npeculiar property is its blistering effect upon the skin. Very low\r\nconcentrations of vapor are capable of “burning” the skin and of\r\nproducing casualties which require from three weeks to three months for\r\nrecovery. The combination of these properties removed the necessity for\r\na surprise attack, or the building up of a high concentration in the\r\nfirst few bursts of fire. A few shell, fired over a given area, were\r\nsufficient to produce casualties hours and even days afterwards.\r\n\r\nMustard gas, chemically, is dichloroethylsulfide (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S. The name\r\noriginated with the British Tommy because the crude material first\r\nused by the Germans was suggestive of mustard or garlic. Various other\r\nnames were given the compound, such as “Yellow Cross,” from the shell\r\nmarkings of the Germans; “Yperite,” a name used by the French, because\r\nthe compound was first used at Ypres; and “blistering gas,” because of\r\nits peculiar effect upon the skin.\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORICAL\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that an impure form of mustard gas was obtained\r\nby Richie (1854) by the action of chlorine upon ethyl sulfide. The\r\nsubstance was first described by Guthrie (1860), who recognized its\r\npeculiar and powerful physiological effects. It is interesting in this\r\nconnection to note that Guthrie studied the effect of ethylene upon\r\nthe sulfur chlorides, since this reaction was the basis of the method\r\nfinally adopted by the Allies.\r\n\r\nThe first careful investigation of mustard gas, which was then only\r\nknown as dichloroethylsulfide, was carried out by Victor Meyer (1886).\r\nMeyer used the reaction between ethylene chlorhydrin and sodium\r\nsulfide, with the subsequent treatment with hydrochloric acid. All the\r\nGerman mustard gas used during 1917 and 1918 was apparently made by\r\nthe use of these reactions, and all the early experimental work of the\r\nAllies was in this direction.\r\n\r\nMustard gas was first used as an offensive agent by the Germans on\r\nJuly 12-13, 1917, at Ypres. According to an English report, the\r\nphysiological properties of mustard gas had been tested by them during\r\nthe summer of 1916. The Anti-Gas Department put forward the suggestion\r\nthat it should be used for chemical warfare, but at that time its\r\nadoption was not approved. This fact enabled the English to quickly and\r\ncorrectly identify the contents of the first Yellow Cross dud received.\r\nIt is not true, as reported by the Germans, that the material was first\r\ndiagnosed as diethylsulfide.\r\n\r\nThe tactical value of mustard gas was immediately recognized by the\r\nGermans and they used tremendous quantities of it. During ten days\r\nof the Fall of 1917, it is calculated that over 1,000,000 shell were\r\nfired, containing about 2,500 tons of mustard gas. Zanetti states that\r\nthe British gas casualties during the month following the introduction\r\nof mustard gas were almost as numerous as all gas casualties incurred\r\nduring the previous years of the war. Pope says that the effects of\r\nmustard gas as a military weapon were indeed so devastating that by the\r\nearly autumn of 1917 the technical advisers of the British, French,\r\nand American Governments were occupied upon large scale installations\r\nfor the manufacture of this material.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARATION AND MANUFACTURE\r\n\r\nThe analysis of the first German shell indicated that the mustard gas\r\ncontained therein had been prepared by the method published by Victor\r\nMeyer (1886) and later used by Clark (1912) in England. It was natural,\r\ntherefore, that attention should be turned to the large scale operation\r\nof this method.\r\n\r\nThe following operations are involved: Ethylene is prepared by the\r\ndehydration of ethyl alcohol. The interaction of hypochlorous acid\r\n(HClO) and ethylene yields ethylene chlorhydrin, ClCH₂CH₂OH. When\r\nthis is treated with sodium sulfide, dihydroxyethyl sulfide forms,\r\nwhich, heated with hydrochloric acid, yields dichloroethyl sulfide.\r\nChemically, the reactions may be written as follows:\r\n\r\n               CH₃CH₂OH = CH₂ : CH₂ + H₂O\r\n       CH₂ : CH₂ + HClO = HOCH₂CH₂Cl\r\n     2HOCH₂CH₂Cl + Na₂S = (HOCH₂CH₂)₂S + 2NaCl\r\n    (HOCH₂CH₂)₂S + 2HCl = (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S + 2H₂O\r\n\r\nWithout going into the chemistry of this reaction, which is thoroughly\r\ndiscussed by Gomberg[18] (see also German Manufacture), it may be\r\nsaid that this “procedure proved to be unsuitable for large scale\r\nproduction” (Dorsey). As Pope remarks, “That he (the German) should\r\nhave been able to produce three hundred tons of mustard gas per month\r\nby the large scale installation of the purely academic method (of\r\nMeyer) constitutes indeed ‘a significant tribute to the potentialities\r\nrepresented by the large German fine chemical factories.’” It is true\r\nthat a great deal of experimental work was carried out by the Allies on\r\nthis method, but further study was dropped as soon as the Pope method\r\nwas discovered.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: J. Am. Chem. Soc. =41=, 1414 (1919).]\r\n\r\nThe first step in advance in the manufacture of mustard gas was the\r\ndiscovery that ethylene would react with sulfur dichloride. While\r\nAmerican chemists were not very successful in their application of this\r\nreaction, either in the laboratory or the plant, it was apparently,\r\naccording to Zanetti, the only method used by the French (the only\r\none of the Allies that manufactured and fired mustard gas). The plant\r\nwas that of the Société Chimique des Usines du Rhone and was started\r\nearly in March, 1918, with a production of two to three tons a day.\r\nIn July it was producing close to twenty tons a day. The plant was\r\nbeing duplicated at the time of the Armistice, so that probably in\r\nDecember, 1918, the production of mustard gas by the dichloride process\r\nwould have reached about 40 tons. Zanetti points out, however, that\r\nthe process involved complicated and costly apparatus and required\r\nconsiderable quantities of carbon tetrachloride as a solvent. It is for\r\nthis reason that the Levinstein process would have been a tremendous\r\ngain, had the war continued.\r\n\r\nAbout the end of January, 1918, Pope and Gibson, in a study of the\r\nreaction originally used by Guthrie, found that the action of ethylene\r\nupon sulfur chloride (S₂Cl₂) at 60° yielded mustard gas and sulfur:\r\n\r\n    2CH₂ : CH₂ + S₂Cl₂ = (CH₂ClCH₂)₂S + S\r\n\r\nThe reaction at this temperature caused the separation of sulfur;\r\nthis occurred after the product stood for some time or immediately\r\nif it was treated with moist ammonia gas. While this process was put\r\ninto commercial operation, both in England and America, it offered\r\nconsiderable difficulty from an operating standpoint. The sulfur would\r\noften separate out and block the inlet tubes (ethylene). While it is\r\ncomparatively easy to remove the mustard gas from the separated sulfur\r\nby decantation, a certain amount always remains with the sulfur. It is\r\nalmost impossible to economically remove this, and its presence adds\r\nto the difficulty of removing the sulfur from the reactors; the men\r\nengaged in this operation almost always become casualties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.—The Levinstein Reactor as Installed at Edgewood\r\nArsenal.]\r\n\r\nIt was especially important, therefore, when Green discovered that, if\r\nthe reaction was carried out at 30°, the sulfur did not settle out but\r\nremained in “pseudo solution” in the mustard gas (Pope) or as a loose\r\nchemical combination of the monosulfide (mustard gas) with an atom of\r\nsulfur (Green). This material has all the physiological activity of the\r\npure monosulfide, while the enormous technical difficulties of handling\r\nseparated sulfur are entirely obviated by this method of manufacture.\r\nTo carry out the reaction Levinstein, Ltd., devised the Levinstein\r\n“reactor.” The apparatus is shown in Fig. 29. The process consists\r\nessentially in bringing together sulfur chloride and very pure ethylene\r\ngas in the presence of crude mustard gas as a solvent at a temperature\r\nranging between 30-35° C. A supply of unchanged monochloride is\r\nconstantly maintained in the reacting liquid until a sufficiently large\r\nbatch is built up. Then the sulfur monochloride feed is discontinued\r\nand the ethylene feed continued until further absorption ceases. By\r\ncontrolling the ratio of mustard gas to uncombined monochloride, the\r\nreaction velocity is so increased that the lower temperature may be\r\nused.\r\n\r\nThe product thus obtained is a pale yellow liquid which deposits no\r\nsulfur and requires no further treatment. It is ready for the shell\r\nfilling plant at once. The obvious advantage of this method led to its\r\nadoption in all American plants started for the manufacture of mustard\r\ngas (Edgewood, Cleveland and Buffalo).\r\n\r\n\r\nETHYLENE\r\n\r\nIt was known from the work of certain French chemists that in the\r\npresence of such a catalyst as kaolin, ethyl alcohol is dehydrated at\r\nan elevated temperature to ethylene. The process as finally developed\r\nby American chemists consisted essentially in introducing mixtures of\r\nalcohol vapor and steam, in the ratio of one to one by weight, into an\r\n8-inch iron tube with a 3-inch core, in contact with clay at 500-600°\r\nC. The use of steam rendered the temperature control more uniform and\r\nthus each unit had a greater capacity of a higher grade product. The\r\ngaseous products were removed through a water-cooled surface condenser.\r\nOne unit of this type had a demonstrated capacity of 400 cubic feet per\r\nhour of ethylene, between 92 and 95 per cent pure, while the conversion\r\nefficiency (alcohol to ethylene) was about 85 per cent. The Edgewood\r\nplant consisted of 40 such units. This would have yielded sufficient\r\nethylene to make 40 tons of mustard gas per 24-hour day.\r\n\r\nThe English procedure consisted in the use of phosphoric acid, absorbed\r\nonto coke. An American furnace was designed and built which gave 2,000\r\ncubic feet per hour of ethylene, with a purity of 98 to 99 per cent.\r\nThis furnace was not used on a large scale, because of the satisfactory\r\nnature of the kaolin furnaces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30.—Experimental Installation for the Production\r\nof Ethylene by Kaolin Procedure. Capacity 400-600 cu. ft. Ethylene per\r\nhr.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSULFUR CHLORIDE\r\n\r\nSince chlorine was prepared at Edgewood, it was logical that some of\r\nthis chlorine should be utilized in the preparation of sulfur chloride.\r\nThe plant constructed consisted of 30 tanks (78 inches in diameter and\r\n35 feet long), each capable of producing 20,000 pounds of monochloride\r\nper day. The tanks are partially filled with sulfur and chlorine passed\r\nin. The reaction proceeds rapidly with sufficient heat to keep the\r\nsulfur in a molten condition. If the chlorine is passed in too rapidly,\r\nthe heat generated may be sufficient to boil off the sulfur chloride\r\nformed. Hence water pipes are provided so that a supply of cold water\r\nmay be sprayed upon the tanks, keeping the temperature within the\r\nproper limits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.—Row of Furnaces for the Preparation of\r\nEthylene.]\r\n\r\nIn the manufacture of one ton of mustard gas, about one ton of sulfur\r\nchloride and a little less than half a ton of ethylene (12,640 cubic\r\nfeet) are required.\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMAN METHOD OF MANUFACTURE[19]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.—Preparation of Ethylene at Badische Anilin und\r\nSoda Fabrik. 60 units.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: Norris, _J. Ind. Eng. Chem._, =11=, 821 (Sept., 1919).]\r\n\r\n    “PREPARATION OF ETHYLENE—The gas was\r\n    prepared by passing alcohol vapor over aluminum oxide\r\n    at a temperature of 380° to 400°. The details of the\r\n    construction of one of the furnaces are given in Figs.\r\n    32 and 33. The furnaces were very small and sixty units\r\n    were needed to furnish the amount of gas required. The\r\n    tubes containing the catalyzer were made of copper and\r\n    were heated in a bath of molten potassium nitrate. It\r\n    was stated that the catalyzer was made according to the\r\n    directions of Ipatieff, and that its life was from 10\r\n    to 20 days. The gas produced was washed in the usual\r\n    form of scrubber. The yield of ethylene was stated to\r\n    be about 90 per cent of the theoretical.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.—Ethylene Production at Badische Anilin und Soda\r\nFabrik. 1 unit.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.—Chlorhydrin reaction kettle at Badische Anilin\r\nund Soda Fabrik. 16 units.]\r\n\r\n    “PREPARATION OF ETHYLENE CHLORHYDRIN—The\r\n    reaction was carried out in a cylindrical tank resting\r\n    on its side. The tank was furnished with a stirrer and\r\n    was insulated by means of cork in order to prevent the\r\n    transfer of heat from the atmosphere to the inside.\r\n    Enough chloride of lime was introduced into the tank to\r\n    furnish 500 kg. of available chlorine, together with 5\r\n    cu. m. of water. At first, about 20 cu. m. of carbon\r\n    dioxide were led into the mixture, next ethylene, and\r\n    later carbon dioxide and ethylene simultaneously. The\r\n    rate of absorption of ethylene was noted and when\r\n    it slackened, more carbon dioxide was added. Fuller\r\n    details as to the addition of the two gases were\r\n    not given as it was stated that it was a matter of\r\n    judgment on the part of the workman who was carrying\r\n    out the operation. The reaction should be carried out\r\n    at as low a temperature as possible, but it was found\r\n    impossible to work below 5° with the apparatus employed\r\n    in this factory. The temperature during the reaction\r\n    varied between 5° and 10°. In order to maintain this\r\n    temperature, the solution was constantly pumped from\r\n    the apparatus through a coil which was cooled by brine.\r\n    When ethylene was no longer absorbed and there was an\r\n    excess of carbon dioxide present, the solution was\r\n    tested for hypochlorous acid. The time required for the\r\n    introduction of ethylene was between 2 and 3 hrs.\r\n\r\n    “The contents of the apparatus were passed through a\r\n    filter press by means of which the calcium carbonate\r\n    was removed. The solution thus obtained contained from\r\n    10 to 12 per cent of ethylene chlorhydrin. It was next\r\n    distilled with steam and a distillate collected which\r\n    contained between 18 and 20 per cent of chlorhydrin.\r\n    The yield of chlorhydrin was from 60 to 80 per cent of\r\n    that calculated from the ethylene used.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.—Mustard Gas Manufacture at Leverkusen. Layout\r\nfor Chlorination of Thiodiglycol.]\r\n\r\n    “PREPARATION OF DIHYDROXYETHYLSULFIDE—To\r\n    prepare the hydroxysulfide, the theoretical quantity\r\n    of sodium sulfide, either in the form of the anhydrous\r\n    salt or as crystals, was added to the 18 to 20 per cent\r\n    solution of chlorhydrin. After the addition of the\r\n    sulfide, the mixture was heated to about 90° to 100°.\r\n    It was then pumped to an evaporator, and heated until\r\n    all the water was driven off. The glycol was next\r\n    filtered from the salt which separated, and distilled\r\n    in a vacuum. The yield of glycol was about 90 per cent\r\n    of the theoretical, calculated from the chlorhydrin.\r\n\r\n    “PREPARATION OF DICHLORETHYLSULFIDE—The\r\n    thiodiglycol was taken from the rail to two large\r\n    storage tanks and thence drawn by vacuum direct to\r\n    the reaction vessel. Each reaction vessel was placed\r\n    in a separate cubicle ventilated both from above and\r\n    below and fitted with glass windows for inspection. The\r\n    vessels themselves were made of 1¼ in. cast iron and\r\n    lined with 10 mm. lead. They were 2.5 m. high and 2.8\r\n    m. in diameter. These tanks were jacketed so that they\r\n    could be heated by water and steam, and the reaction\r\n    was carried out at 50°. The hydrochloric acid coming\r\n    from the main pipe was passed through sulfuric acid so\r\n    that the rate could be observed, and passed in by means\r\n    of 12 glass tubes of about 2 cm. diameter. The rate of\r\n    flow was maintained at as high a rate as possible to\r\n    procure absorption. The vapors from the reaction were\r\n    led from the vessel through a pipe into a collecting\r\n    room, and then through a scrubber containing charcoal\r\n    and water, through a separator, and then, finally,\r\n    into the chimney. These exhaust gases were drawn off\r\n    by means of a fan which was also connected with the\r\n    lower part of the chamber in which the reaction vessels\r\n    were set, so that all the gases had to pass through\r\n    the scrubber before going to the chimney. When the\r\n    reaction was completed, the oil was removed by means\r\n    of a vacuum, induced by a water pump, into a cast iron\r\n    washing vessel.\r\n\r\n    “The hydrochloric acid layer was removed to a stoneware\r\n    receiver, also by vacuum. A glass enabled the operator\r\n    to avoid drawing oil over with the acid. The pan was\r\n    fitted with a thermometer to the interior as well as to\r\n    the jacket. For testing the material during reaction,\r\n    provision was made for drawing some up by vacuum to\r\n    a hydrometer contained in a glass funnel. The final\r\n    test at this point read 126° Tw. Another portion could\r\n    be drawn up to a test glass and hydrochloric acid\r\n    passed through it in full view. A float contained in\r\n    a glass outer tube served to show the level of the\r\n    liquid in the vessel. The pans in which the operation\r\n    is carried on, as well as those employed for washing\r\n    and distilling the product, were of a standard pattern\r\n    employed in many other operations in the works.\r\n\r\n    “The washer consisted of a cast iron vessel, lead\r\n    lined, and was 2.5 m. in diameter, 2 m. deep, and\r\n    fitted with a dome cover and stirring gear. Lead\r\n    pipes served for the introduction of sodium carbonate\r\n    solution and water. Similar pipes were fitted for\r\n    drawing these off by means of a vacuum. A manhole on\r\n    the cover, with a flat top, was fitted with light and\r\n    sight glasses to which were fitted a small steam coil\r\n    for keeping them clear. The washed oil is drawn off\r\n    to a distillation still, which is a cast iron vessel\r\n    homogeneously lead coated, 1.5 m. in diameter and 2 m.\r\n    deep, fitted with a lead heating coil and connected\r\n    through a spiral lead condenser and receiver to a\r\n    vacuum pump. The water is distilled from the oil at\r\n    a pressure of from 62 to 70 mm. absolute pressure.\r\n    When dried, the oil is sent by vacuum to a mixing\r\n    vessel, similar in most respects to the washing vessel,\r\n    in which it is mixed with an appointed quantity\r\n    of solvent, which, in this factory, was usually\r\n    chlorobenzene but occasionally carbon tetrachloride.\r\n    The relative quantities varied with the time of year,\r\n    and instructions were sent from Berlin on this point.\r\n    Thence the mixture was passed to a storage tank and\r\n    into tank-wagons.”\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN METHOD OF MANUFACTURE\r\n\r\nThe Chemical Warfare Service investigated carefully the three methods\r\n(German, French, and English) and finally adopted the Levinstein\r\nprocess. The following discussion is taken from a report originally\r\nmade during construction, Sept., 1918.\r\n\r\nThe Levinstein reactor consisted of a jacketed and lead-lined vessel or\r\nsteel tank, 8 feet 5 inches in diameter and 14 feet tall. The reactor\r\ncontained 1,400 feet of lead pipe (outside diameter 2⅜ inches), made up\r\ninto five coils, giving a total cooling surface of 1,200 square feet.\r\nThe finished charge of such a reactor is 12 tons.\r\n\r\nEthylene was introduced through lead injectors, of which there were 16,\r\neach suspended from its own opening in the top and hanging so that the\r\nend of the injector tube was 12 inches from the bottom of the reactor.\r\nThe nozzle of the injector was ³/₁₆ inch outside diameter and ethylene\r\nwas introduced through it at 40 pounds pressure.\r\n\r\nIn starting the reaction, enough sulfur chloride was introduced into\r\nthe reactor to cover the central nozzles. Ethylene was now introduced,\r\nand as the reaction proceeded sulfur chloride was added in sufficient\r\nquantities to give a high rate of reaction. Brine or cold water was\r\nintroduced through the cooling coils and jacket to keep the reacting\r\ntemperature at 35° C.\r\n\r\nWhen the charge was completed, the ethylene was turned off so that only\r\na small amount bubbled through the nozzles and the charge syphoned\r\noff to the settling tank. These were constructed of iron, 8 feet in\r\ndiameter and 19 feet tall. They were provided with iron coils by which\r\nthe liquid may be cooled down, or the sulfur, which precipitates in the\r\nbottom, melted. The tank was large enough to hold six complete charges\r\nof mustard gas and all the sulfur from these charges was allowed to\r\naccumulate before removal of the sulfur. The supernatant mustard gas\r\nwas drawn off from above this sulfur to storage tanks.\r\n\r\nAmong the factors which influence the reaction are the following:\r\n\r\nA temperature of over 60° C. in lead will decompose the product slowly\r\nwhen sulfur chloride is present.\r\n\r\nThe presence of iron decomposes the product rapidly at a temperature of\r\n50° C. and probably at a considerably lower temperature.\r\n\r\nThe purity of the product is dependent upon the time of reaction. There\r\nis always a slow reaction between the mustard gas and sulfur chloride,\r\nand because of this the charge should be completed in 8 hours.\r\n\r\nIn general the more sulfur that comes out of the solution, the better\r\nis the product. Temperature has a marked effect on the separation of\r\nsulfur. In order to entirely remove the sulfur from the product it was\r\nthe custom to increase the temperature at the close of the reaction\r\nfrom 55° to 70° C. This, however, caused plugging of the lines and the\r\nreactor.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPERTIES\r\n\r\nDichloroethylsulfide (mustard gas) is a colorless, oily liquid, which\r\nhas a faint mustard odor. The pure material is said to have an odor\r\nvery suggestive of that of water cress. While the odor is more or less\r\ncharacteristic, it is possible to have extremely dangerous amounts of\r\nthe gas in a neighborhood without being detected through its odors. It\r\nstill seems to be an open question whether mustard gas paralyzes the\r\nsense of smell. One can find opinions on both sides.\r\n\r\nMustard gas boils at 215°-217° C. at atmospheric pressure, so that\r\nit is at once seen to be a very persistent gas. It distills without\r\ndecomposition at this temperature but is best purified by vacuum\r\ndistillation, or by distillation with steam. A still for the vacuum\r\ndistillation of mustard gas has been described by Streeter.[20]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: _J. Ind. Eng. Chem._, 11, 292 (1919).]\r\n\r\nMustard gas melts, when pure, at 13° to 14° C. (The ordinary summer\r\ntemperature is 20°-25° C.). The ordinary product, as obtained from\r\nthe “reactor,” melts from 9°-10° C. In order that the product in the\r\nshell might be liquid at all temperatures, winter as well as summer,\r\nthe Germans added from 10 to 30 per cent of chlorobenzene, later using\r\na mixture of chlorobenzene and nitrobenzene and still later pure\r\nnitrobenzene. Carbon tetrachloride has also been used as a means of\r\nlowering the melting point. Many other mixtures, such as chloropicrin,\r\nhydrocyanic acid, bromoacetone, etc., were tested, but were not\r\nused. The effect on the melting point of mustard gas is shown in the\r\nfollowing table:\r\n\r\n\r\nMELTING POINT OF MUSTARD GAS MIXTURES\r\n\r\n    ---------+--------------+---------------+---------------\r\n    Per Cent | Chloropicrin | Chlorobenzene |    Carbon\r\n    Added    |              |               | Tetrachloride\r\n    ---------+--------------+---------------+---------------\r\n        0    |   13.4° C.   |   13.4° C.    |   13.4° C.\r\n       10    |    9.8       |    8.4        |    9.8\r\n       20    |    6.3       |    6.4        |    6.6\r\n       30    |    2.6       |   -1.0        |    3.1\r\n    ---------+--------------+---------------+---------------\r\n\r\nThe mustard gas as finally made by the United States contained about\r\n17 to 18 per cent sulfur in solution. The gas was then put in shell\r\nand fired without the addition of any solvent. In actual practice this\r\nimpure product seemed even more powerful in causing casualties than\r\nequal quantities of the pure mustard gas. Accordingly no redistilling\r\nas originally contemplated was actually carried out.\r\n\r\nThe specific gravity of mustard gas at 20° is 1.2741. The solid\r\nmaterial has a slightly higher value, being 1.338 at 13°. Its vapor\r\npressure at room temperature is very low; at 20° this value has been\r\nfound to be about 0.06 mm. of mercury.\r\n\r\nMustard gas is practically insoluble in water, less than 0.1 per cent\r\nforming a saturated solution. The reports that a 1 per cent solution\r\ncould be obtained did not consider the question of hydrolysis. Mustard\r\ngas is freely soluble in all the ordinary organic solvents, such as\r\nligroin, alcohol, ether, chloroform, acetic acid, chlorobenzene, etc.\r\nIn case the solvent is miscible with water, dilution throws out the\r\nproduct as an oil.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL PROPERTIES\r\n\r\nMustard gas is very slowly decomposed by water, owing to its very\r\nslight solubility. The products are dihydroxyethylsulfide and\r\nhydrochloric acid:\r\n\r\n    (ClCH₂CH₂)₂S + 2H₂O = (HOCH₂CH₂)₂S + 2HCl\r\n\r\nCertain sulfonated oils accelerate the rate of hydrolysis, both by\r\nincreasing the rate of solution and the solubility of the mustard gas.\r\nAlkalies also increase the rate of hydrolysis. Oxidizing agents destroy\r\nmustard gas. This reaction was made use of practically in that solid\r\nbleaching powder was early introduced as a means of destroying mustard\r\ngas in the field. (Fig. 9.)\r\n\r\nChlorinating agents (chlorine, sulfur dichloride, etc.) rapidly\r\ntransform mustard gas into an inactive (non-blistering) substance.\r\nSulfur dichloride was a valuable reagent in both laboratory and works\r\nin “cleaning up” mustard gas. This reaction also explains why the\r\nearly attempts to prepare mustard gas by the interaction of ethylene\r\nand sulfur dichloride were unsuccessful. Mustard gas is probably\r\nformed, but is almost immediately chlorinated by the excess of sulfur\r\ndichloride. Sulfur chloride on the other hand has no effect on mustard\r\ngas. Chloramine-T and Dichloramine-T (the valuable therapeutic agents\r\nintroduced by Dakin and Carrel for treatment of wounds) also react\r\nwith mustard gas. For this reason they were advocated as treatment for\r\nmustard gas burns. But as we will see later, they were not altogether\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\n\r\nDETECTION\r\n\r\nAt first the only method of detecting mustard gas was through the sense\r\nof smell. It was then believed that concentrations which could not be\r\ndetected in this way were harmless. Later this proved not to be the\r\ncase, and more delicate methods had to be devised. In the laboratory\r\nand in the field these tests were not very satisfactory, because most\r\nof them depended upon the presence of chlorine, and the majority of the\r\nwar gases contained chlorine or one of the other halogens. The Lantern\r\nTest depended upon the accumulation of the halogen upon a copper\r\ngauze and the subsequent heating of the gauze in a Bunsen flame. This\r\ntest could be made to detect one part of mustard gas in ten million\r\nparts of air. Another field detector devised by the Chemical Warfare\r\nService consisted in the use of selenious acid. Here again the lack of\r\nspecificity is apparent, for while certain halogen compounds did not\r\ngive the test, arsine and organic arsenicals gave a positive reaction\r\nand often in a shorter time than mustard gas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.—Field Detector for Mustard Gas.]\r\n\r\nThe Germans are said to have had plates covered with a yellow\r\ncomposition which had the property of turning black in the presence\r\nof mustard gas. These plates were lowered into the bottom of recently\r\ncaptured trenches and if, after a few minutes, they turned black, the\r\npresence of mustard gas was suspected. It is also stated that the\r\ncharacteristic yellow paint on the olive of the mustard gas shell\r\nhad the same composition, and was useful in detecting leaky shell.\r\nAccording to a deserter’s statement, however, reliance upon this test\r\nresulted in casualties in several instances.\r\n\r\nA white paint has also been reported which turned red in the presence\r\nof mustard gas. This color change was not characteristic, for tests\r\nmade by our Army showed that other oils (aniline, turpentine, linseed)\r\nwere found to produce the same effect.\r\n\r\nThe Chemical Warfare Service was able to develop an enamel and an oil\r\npaint which were very sensitive detectors of mustard gas. Both of these\r\nwere yellow and became dark red in contact with mustard gas. The change\r\nwas practically instantaneous. The enamel consisted of chrome yellow as\r\npigment mixed with oil scarlet and another dye, and a lacquer vehicle,\r\nwhich is essentially a solution of nitrocellulose in amyl acetate.\r\nOne gallon of this enamel will cover 946,500 sq. cm., or a surface\r\nequivalent to a band 3 cm. wide on 12,500 seven cm. shell.\r\n\r\nThe paint was composed of a mixture of 50 per cent raw linseed oil\r\nand 50 per cent Japan drier, with the above dye mixture added to\r\nthe required consistency. In contact with liquid mustard gas, this\r\nchanges to a deep crimson in 4 seconds. Furthermore, in contact with\r\narsenicals, this paint changes to a color varying from deep purple\r\nto dark green, the color change being almost instantaneous and very\r\nsensitive, even to the vapors of these compounds. Other substances have\r\nno effect upon the paint.\r\n\r\nFor field work, however, nothing was found equal to the trained nose,\r\nand it is questionable if any of the mechanical means described will be\r\nused in the field.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSIOLOGICAL ACTION\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting phases of mustard gas is its peculiar\r\nphysiological action. This has been studied extensively, both as\r\nrelates to the toxicity and to the skin or blistering effect.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOXICITY\r\n\r\nWhen one considers the high boiling point of mustard gas, and its\r\nconsequent low vapor pressure, he is likely to conclude that such a\r\nsubstance would be of comparatively little value as a toxic or poison\r\ngas. While it is true that an important part of the military value\r\nof mustard gas has been because of its vesicant properties, the fact\r\nstill remains that it is one of our most toxic war gases. The following\r\ncomparison with a few of the other gases indicates this:\r\n\r\n    -----------------+----------------------\r\n                     |    Mg. per Liter\r\n                     +---------------+------\r\n                     |     Mice      | Dogs\r\n    -----------------+---------------+------\r\n    Mustard gas      |      0.2      | 0.05\r\n    Phosgene         |      0.3      | ···\r\n    Hydrocyanic acid |      0.2      | 0.1\r\n    Chloropicrin     |      1.5      | 0.8\r\n    Chlorine         |      ···      | 3.0\r\n    -----------------+---------------+------\r\n\r\nWhen an animal is exposed to the vapors of mustard gas in high\r\nconcentration, it subsequently shows a complexity of symptoms, which\r\nmay be divided into two classes:\r\n\r\n(1) The local effects on the eyes, skin and respiratory tract.\r\nThese are well recognized and consist mainly of conjunctivitis and\r\nsuperficial necrosis of the cornea; hyperemia, œdema and later,\r\nnecrosis of the skin, leading to a skin lesion of great chronicity; and\r\ncongestion and necrosis of the epithelial lining of the trachea and\r\nbronchi.\r\n\r\n(2) The systemic effects due to the absorption of the substance into\r\nthe blood stream, and its distribution to the various tissues of the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nThe most striking observation about the symptoms of mustard gas\r\npoisoning is the latent period which elapses after exposure before any\r\nserious objective or subjective effects are noted. The developments of\r\nthe effects are then quite slow, unless very high superlethal doses\r\nhave been inhaled.\r\n\r\nAt first it was a very serious question whether or not the temporary\r\nblindness resulting from mustard gas would not be permanent. Later, as\r\nthe depth and seriousness of some of the body burns became well known,\r\nit was a seven-day wonder that no permanent blindness occurred.\r\n\r\nThe reason seems to be largely a mechanical one. The constant winking\r\nof the eyelids apparently washes the mustard gas off the eyeball\r\nand carries it away so that not enough remains to burn to the depth\r\nnecessary to cause permanent blindness.\r\n\r\nDue to the very slight concentrations ordinarily encountered in the\r\nfield, resulting from a very slow rate of evaporation, the death rate\r\nis very low, probably under 1 per cent among the Americans gassed with\r\nmustard during the war.\r\n\r\nIf, on the other hand, the gas be widely and very finely dispersed by\r\na heavy charge of explosive in the shell, the gas is very deadly. In\r\nsuch cases the injured breathe in minute particles of the liquid and\r\nthus get hundreds of times the amount of gas that would be inhaled as\r\nvapor. This so-called “high explosive mustard gas shell” was a German\r\ndevelopment in the very last months of the war. Its effects were great\r\nenough to make it certain that in the future large numbers of these\r\nshell will be used.\r\n\r\nThe similarity of the symptoms and pathological effects after the\r\ninhalation of large amounts of the vapor and those following an\r\ninjection of an olive oil or water solution of mustard gas led Marshall\r\nand his associates to conclude that in high concentrations mustard gas\r\nis absorbed through the lungs. A further bit of evidence consists in\r\nthe isolation of the hydrolysis product, dihydroxyethylsulfide, in the\r\nurine of animals poisoned by inhalation of mustard gas. This product\r\nis not toxic and is not responsible for the effects of mustard gas.\r\nHydrochloric acid, however, does produce very definite effects upon the\r\nanimal and may cause death.\r\n\r\nFrom these facts Marshall[21] has proposed the following mechanism of\r\nthe action of mustard gas:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: Marshall, Lynch and Smith, _J. Pharmacal_, =12=, 291-301\r\n(1918).]\r\n\r\n    “Dichlorethylsulphide is very slightly soluble in water\r\n    and very freely soluble in organic solvents, or has\r\n    a high lipoid solubility or partition coefficient.\r\n    It would, therefore, be expected to penetrate cells\r\n    very readily. Its rapid powers of penetration are\r\n    practically proven by its effects upon the skin.\r\n    Having penetrated within the living cell, it would\r\n    undoubtedly hydrolyze. The liberation of free\r\n    hydrochloric acid _within the cell_ would produce\r\n    serious effects and might account for the actions of\r\n    dichlorethylsulphide. To summarize, then, the mechanism\r\n    of the action of dichlorethylsulphide appears to be as\r\n    follows:\r\n\r\n    “1. Rapid penetration of the substance into the cell by\r\n    virtue of its high lipoid solubility.\r\n\r\n    2. Hydrolysis by the water within the cell, to form\r\n    hydrochloric acid and dihydroxyethylsulphide.\r\n\r\n    3. The destructive effect of hydrochloric acid upon\r\n    some part or mechanism of the cell.\r\n\r\n    “Although hydrochloric acid does not penetrate cells\r\n    readily and is easily neutralized by the buffer action\r\n    of the fluids of the body, we might expect by flooding\r\n    the body with large quantities of acid to produce\r\n    some of the characteristic effects of mustard gas.\r\n    Stimulation of the respiratory center is a well known\r\n    effect of acid. Convulsions and salivation may be\r\n    produced by injection of hydrochloric acid and we have\r\n    been able to produce slowing of the heart by rapid\r\n    injection of this acid.\r\n\r\n    “The delayed action of mustard gas might be explained\r\n    by the formation of some compound with some constituent\r\n    of the blood. However, blood taken from dogs which had\r\n    been poisoned with mustard gas and were exhibiting\r\n    typical symptoms at the time, injected into normal\r\n    dogs produced no effect. Serum treated in vitro with\r\n    mustard gas and allowed to stand and then injected into\r\n    a dog, produced no effect. The fluid which is formed\r\n    in the vesicle and blebs produced by the application\r\n    of mustard gas to the skin produces no mustard gas\r\n    effects.”\r\n\r\nIn studying the toxicity of mustard gas for dogs, it was observed that\r\na concentration of 0.01 mg. per liter could be tolerated indefinitely.\r\nIf this value is considered as a threshold value, and subtracted from\r\nthe toxicity values for varying periods of time, it is found that there\r\nis a definite relation between the toxic concentration and the time of\r\nexposure. This is expressed by the formula\r\n\r\n                           (C - 0.01)_t_ = K\r\nwhere C is the concentration observed for a given time _t_. K has the\r\napproximate value of 1.7, where _t_ varies between 7.5 and 480 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nVESICANT ACTION\r\n\r\nIn addition to its toxicity mustard gas is highly important because\r\nof its peculiar irritating effect upon the skin. Its value is seen\r\nwhen we realize that one part in 14,000,000 is capable of causing\r\nconjunctivitis of the eye and that one part in 3,000,000 and possibly\r\none part in 5,000,000 will cause a skin burn in a sensitive person\r\non prolonged exposure. According to Warthin, the lesions produced by\r\nmustard gas are those of a chemical, not unlike hydrochloric acid, but\r\nof much greater intensity. The pathology of these lesions has been\r\ncarefully studied and fully described by Warthin and Weller in their\r\nbook on The Pathology of Mustard Gas. Our observations will therefore\r\nbe confined to certain striking features of the vesicant action of this\r\nsubstance.\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIATION IN SUSCEPTIBILITY OF THE SKIN\r\n\r\nEvery worker who has worked with mustard gas has noticed that some\r\nindividuals are much more susceptible to skin burns from this substance\r\nthan are others. Marshall made a study of 1282 men at Edgewood Arsenal,\r\nusing a 1 per cent and a 0.01 per cent solution of mustard gas in\r\nparaffin oil. A small drop of these solutions was applied to the skin\r\nof the forearm of the subject and the arm allowed to remain uncovered\r\nfor about 10 minutes. The presence or absence of a positive reaction is\r\nindicated by the appearance or absence of erythema 24 hours later. The\r\nresults were as follows:\r\n\r\n       1%         0.01%       % of Total\r\n    Positive     Positive         3.3\r\n    Positive     Negative        55.3\r\n    Negative     Negative        41.4\r\n\r\nThe test made on 84 negroes gave the following results:\r\n\r\n            1%          0.01%     % of Total\r\n        Positive       Positive       0.0\r\n        Positive       Negative      15.0\r\n        Negative       Negative      78.0\r\n        Questionable   Negative       7.0\r\n\r\n    “It is seen from the above tables that negroes as a\r\n    race, have a much more resistant skin than white men.\r\n    No negro of the 84 examined reacted to the 0.1 per cent\r\n    solution, and of course none would react to a more\r\n    dilute one. About 10 per cent of white men react to\r\n    the 0.1 per cent solution, while 2 to 3 per cent react\r\n    to the 0.01 per cent solution or are hypersensitive.\r\n    About 78 per cent of the negroes fail to react to the 1\r\n    per cent solution, while only 20 to 40 per cent of the\r\n    white race do not show a reaction.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.]\r\n\r\nThe same individual may also show variations in susceptibility and this\r\nhas also been studied by Marshall.\r\n\r\n    “The effect of exercise and sweating was investigated.\r\n    A number of individuals were given vapor burns (one\r\n    to five minutes exposure) and then exercised until in\r\n    a profuse sweat, and then the same exposure to vapors\r\n    made. In all cases the burn produced after exercising\r\n    was more severe. Sweating produced by having the\r\n    subjects place their feet in hot water, produced the\r\n    same increase in susceptibility. That the moisture\r\n    on the skin produced by sweating is at least partly,\r\n    if not entirely, responsible for the increased\r\n    susceptibility, was shown in the following way: An\r\n    area of the forearm was kept moist for a few minutes\r\n    with wet cotton. The sponge was then removed and two\r\n    vapor tests made, one over the moist area and one over\r\n    normal, dry skin. In all cases the moist burn was the\r\n    more severe, in one, producing a blister where the\r\n    control did not.\r\n\r\n    “The skin of different areas of the body is undoubtedly\r\n    somewhat different in its susceptibility. All our\r\n    tests have been applied to the forearm. The hands\r\n    are considerably more resistant than the forearm.\r\n    Tests made by the oil method on the forearm, chest,\r\n    and back, however, indicate very little difference\r\n    in susceptibility of these areas. The skin in the\r\n    neighborhood of old burns has been shown to be more\r\n    susceptible.\r\n\r\n    “In general, the same individual does not become more\r\n    susceptible to skin burns from continued exposure\r\n    to the vapor. The great number of tests which have\r\n    been made on the same individual at different times\r\n    and under the same conditions, indicate a remarkable\r\n    constancy in reaction. A series of men who were tested\r\n    at various times during a period of four months,\r\n    revealed slight changes from time to time in some of\r\n    the men. No man who originally reacted to only the\r\n    1 per cent solution ever reacted to the 0.01, and\r\n    likewise, no man who originally reacted to the 0.01\r\n    ever failed to react to the 0.1 per cent.\r\n\r\n    “_Susceptibility of skin of animals._ The paraffin\r\n    oil test was used on a number of animals and indicated\r\n    that differences in susceptibility exist in different\r\n    species and in different individuals of the same\r\n    species.”\r\n\r\n       -----------+--------+----------------------------\r\n                  |        |    Percentage Positive to\r\n         Species  | Number +-------+---------+----------\r\n                  | Tested | 1 Per | 0.1 Per | 0.01 Per\r\n                  |        | Cent  |  Cent   |  Cent\r\n       -----------+--------+-------+---------+----------\r\n       Horse      |    1   |  100  |   100   |   100\r\n       Dog        |   91   |   83  |    35   |     0\r\n       Goat       |   11   |   55  |    36   |     0\r\n       Rat        |   10   |   30  |    20   |     0\r\n       Mouse      |    7   |   70  |    14   |     0\r\n       Rabbit     |    2   |  100  |     0   |     0\r\n       Guinea-pig |   12   |   33  |     0   |     0\r\n       Monkey     |    9   |   22  |     0   |     0\r\n       -----------+--------+-------+---------+----------\r\n\r\nThe horse appears to be the most sensitive and the monkey and\r\nguinea-pig the most resistant species, while the dog would seem to have\r\na sensitivity as near man as any of the species studied. No animal\r\nhas yet been found which will give a blister from the application of\r\nmustard gas.\r\n\r\nSmith, Clowes and Marshall[22] have studied the mechanism of absorption\r\nby the skin. They find that it is quite evident that the mustard gas\r\nis at first rapidly taken up by some element on, or adjacent to, the\r\nsurface of the skin and for two to three minutes it may be completely\r\nremoved, and for ten to fifteen minutes partially removed by prolonged\r\nwashing With an organic solvent, and to a lesser extent with soap and\r\nwater.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: J. Pharmacol., =13=, 1 (1919).]\r\n\r\nAn interesting phenomenon is observed when the untreated normal skin\r\nof one subject is impressed for five minutes upon an area of skin\r\nof another subject, which has been exposed previously to the vapors\r\nof mustard gas. Under these circumstances both donor and recipient\r\nmay develop burns (due to the transposition of the poison from one\r\nskin to another), the intensity of which will vary according to the\r\ncircumstances and the respective sensitiveness of the participants. The\r\ndegree of transposition is most strikingly observed in the intensity\r\nof the burn on the donor’s arm. If two similar exposures are made on\r\nthe arm of a sensitive man, and one of these burns is treated, so to\r\nspeak, by contact for five minutes, with the skin of a resistant man,\r\nthe treated burn will be markedly less severe than the control, in some\r\ncases being entirely prevented. If, however, the recipient is equally\r\nsensitive to or more sensitive than the donor, the burns on the latter\r\nwill exhibit far less difference. Both treatments may be effected at\r\nonce, using two recipients, one more, and the other less, resistant\r\nthan the donor. In such a case the burn brought into contact with the\r\nmore resistant skin will be the less severe.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, if a sensitive individual impresses his arm alternately\r\nagainst burns of the same concentration and exposure on a resistant\r\nand sensitive man, the recipient receives a more severe burn from the\r\nsensitive than from the resistant man.\r\n\r\nThis indicates that the skin of a resistant individual exhibits a\r\ngreater affinity or capacity for mustard gas than that of a sensitive\r\none. There is an actual partition of the gas between the two skins,\r\nwith an evident tendency to establish an equilibrium in which the\r\nlarger portion of the gas will remain in that skin which possesses the\r\ngreater capacity for it.\r\n\r\n    “A tentative explanation of this phenomenon can be\r\n    made as follows. A three phase system is involved—the\r\n    air over the skin surface constitutes the outer phase;\r\n    some fatty or keratinous elements of the skin, the\r\n    central phase; and a cellular portion of the skin the\r\n    inner phase. The central phase is rich in lipoids and\r\n    poor in water, while the inner phase is rich in water\r\n    and poor in lipoids. After exposure to the vapors\r\n    of dichloroethylsulphide the central phase is the\r\n    absorbing agent and tends to establish equilibrium with\r\n    the other two phases. On account of the lipoid nature\r\n    of the central phase no damage is produced here because\r\n    the compound is not hydrolyzed. On its passage from\r\n    the central to the inner phase hydrolysis takes place\r\n    within the cell and damage results when a sufficient\r\n    concentration of hydrochloric acid is attained. The\r\n    outer phase is constantly being freed from vapor by\r\n    diffusion and convection currents, so more and more can\r\n    evaporate from the central phase. The susceptibility\r\n    of an individual depends on the relative power of\r\n    the central phase to hold the poison in an inactive\r\n    form (not hydrolyzed) and prevent its entry into the\r\n    inner phase at a sufficient velocity to result in the\r\n    formation of a toxic concentration. We do not attempt\r\n    to localize the central or inner phases with any\r\n    definite structure of the skin. As mustard is known to\r\n    penetrate the sebaceous ducts the fat here might form\r\n    one phase and the epithelial lining another.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTACTICAL USE OF MUSTARD GAS\r\n\r\nAs before stated, mustard gas, like most other materials used in war,\r\nwas discovered in peace. Indeed, Victor Meyer in 1886 worked out fairly\r\ncompletely its dangerous characteristics. Like phosgene and chlorine\r\nused before it, the materials for its production were available in\r\nconsiderable quantities through the manufacture of components either\r\nfor dyes or photographic chemicals.\r\n\r\nMustard gas, besides being highly poisonous, has so many other\r\nimportant qualities as to have given it the designation during the\r\nwar of the “king of gases.” That broad distinction it still holds.\r\nIts introduction at Ypres, on the night of July 12, 1917, changed\r\ncompletely the whole aspect of gas warfare and to a considerable extent\r\nthe whole aspect of warfare of every kind. It is highly poisonous,\r\nbeing in that respect one of the most useful of all war gases. It\r\nproduces no immediate discomfort. It has a considerable delay action.\r\nIt burns the body inside or out, wherever there is moisture. Eyes,\r\nlungs and soft parts of the body are readily attacked. It lingers for\r\ntwo or three days in the warmest weather, while in cold, damp weather\r\nit is dangerous for a week or ten days, and in still colder weather\r\nmay be dangerous for a month or longer whenever the weather warms up\r\nsufficient to volatilize the liquid. It is only slowly destroyed in the\r\nearth, making digging around shell holes dangerous for weeks and months\r\nand in some cases possibly a year or more.\r\n\r\nThe Germans first used it simply to get casualties and interfere with\r\nor break up the threatened heavy attacks by the British on the Ypres\r\nsalient. While not stopping the inauguration of these attacks in the\r\nfall of 1917, the German use of mustard gas was so effective as to\r\ndelay the beginning of those attacks for at least two weeks and thus\r\ngain valuable time for the Germans, besides causing serious casualties\r\nwith consequent partial break up of companies, regiments and divisions\r\nin the English Army.\r\n\r\nThe German used his mustard gas throughout the fall of 1917 and the\r\nwinter of 1917 and 1918, as above stated, to produce casualties, to\r\ndestroy morale, to break up units, and to interfere with operations\r\ngenerally. During that time, however, he developed a more scientific\r\nuse and when he started his big offensives in March, April, May and\r\nJune, 1918, he used mustard gas _before_ the battles to cause losses,\r\nbreak up units and destroy morale, and also during the progress of\r\nbattles to completely neutralize strong points which he felt he did\r\nnot want to attempt to take by direct assault. Perhaps the most noted\r\ncase of this was at Armentières in April, when he deluged the city to\r\nsuch an extent that mustard gas is said to have actually run in the\r\nstreets. So effective was this gassing that not only did the British\r\nhave to withdraw from the city but the Germans could not enter it for\r\nmore than two weeks. It, however, enabled the Germans to take the city\r\nwith practically no loss of life. There were numerous other cases on a\r\nsmaller scale where mustard gas was used in the same way.\r\n\r\nOn account of its persistence it has been generally referred to as\r\na defensive gas and for that purpose it is incomparable. The use of\r\nsufficient quantities of mustard gas will almost certainly stop the\r\noccupation of areas by the enemy and probably even stop his crossing\r\nthem. It also enables strong points which it is not desired to attack\r\nto be completely neutralized,—that is, made so unhabitable that the\r\narea must be evacuated.\r\n\r\nA use that was proposed toward the end of the war, and that will\r\nundoubtedly be made of the gas in the future, is to have it planted\r\nin drums in the ground and exploded when an enemy is attempting to\r\nadvance. This would be a highly economic way to distribute great\r\nquantities of the material at the moment and in the place most heeded.\r\nIt has even been proposed, and this would seem entirely feasible, to\r\nsprinkle certain of these areas with mustard gas by means of sprinklers\r\nattached to drums or even tanks mounted on trucks.\r\n\r\nJust before the Armistice the German made another development in the\r\nuse of mustard gas. Instead of the ordinary amount of explosive, which\r\nonly fairly opened up the shell and allowed the liquid to escape, he\r\nfilled nearly 30 per cent of the total space of the shell with high\r\nexplosive. This completely broke up the shell and distributed the\r\ngreater part of the liquid mustard gas in the form of a fine spray.\r\nThis spray, when breathed, proved extremely deadly, as might be\r\nexpected from the fact that when in the form of minute particles one\r\ncan draw into the lungs in a single breath one hundred times or more\r\nthe amount that he would get of pure gas.\r\n\r\nSince mustard gas has such a delay action and is effective in such\r\nsmall concentrations it can be used very effectively in small calibre\r\nguns, as the 75 mm. or 3-inch. Furthermore, since it lasts for two\r\nor three days at the very least, a small number of guns can keep a\r\nvery large area neutralized with the gas. With phosgene and similar\r\nnon-persistent gases that volatilize almost completely upon the\r\nburst of the shell it is necessary to build up a high concentration\r\nimmediately. The exact opposite is true of mustard gas. Mustard gas\r\ncan be fired very slowly with the certain knowledge that all shells\r\nfired at one moment will be effective when the next is fired, though\r\ntwelve hours or more may intervene between the first and last firing.\r\nThus, while with phosgene a large number of guns are needed for a gas\r\nattack, with mustard gas the number can be reduced to one-tenth or even\r\nless. Mustard gas may be in the future and has been in the past used\r\nsafely in hand grenades because of its very low vapor tension, whereby\r\nthe pressure at ordinary temperatures is exceedingly low. This has\r\nan important bearing on cylinders and other containers for shipping\r\nmustard gas, that is, they need be only strong enough to be safe\r\nagainst handling and not to withstand the high pressure encountered\r\nwith phosgene or chlorine cylinders.\r\n\r\nIn the future, mustard gas will be used in all the ways above stated\r\nand undoubtedly in many more. It can be fired in large quantities upon\r\nstrong points to force their evacuation. It can be fired on the flank\r\nof attacking armies for protection against counter-attacks. It can be\r\nfired against the enemy artillery at all times to silence them and stop\r\ntheir firing. It was thus used by the Americans in the Argonne against\r\nthe enemy on the east bank of the Meuse River, this river separating\r\nthe American and German armies. It was extremely effective in stopping\r\nthe enemy’s artillery. The high explosive mustard gas shell, not only\r\nbecause of its persistency but because of its quick deadliness, can be\r\nfired singly and be depended upon to do its work wherever there be men\r\nor animals. One of the greatest uses will be by simple sprinkling from\r\naeroplanes.\r\n\r\nThe future will see mustard gas used at nearly all times with a\r\ncertain quantity of a powerful lachrymator or tear gas. This is for\r\nthe reasons, as stated in the beginning, that mustard gas causes no\r\nimmediate discomfort and has no objectionable smell. Accordingly,\r\nif the battle be critical, men may continue to fight from four to\r\neight hours in a mustard gas atmosphere without masks. It is true the\r\ncasualties will be high with a high death rate. Nevertheless, this\r\nperiod of time might enable the artillery to do such effective work as\r\nto completely stop an attack. If, however, at the instant mustard gas\r\nfiring is begun a number of powerful lachrymatory shells are sent over,\r\nthe immediate wearing of the mask is forced. The enemy is then subject\r\nto all the burning effects of mustard gas as well as the discomfort of\r\nlong wearing of the mask.\r\n\r\nIt may confidently be expected that further developments in the use of\r\nmustard gas will be made, as well as further developments in methods of\r\nthrowing it upon the enemy or of bursting shell containing it in his\r\nmidst.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nARSENIC DERIVATIVES\r\n\r\n\r\nSince arsenic is well known as an insecticide in the form of lead\r\narsenate, arsenic acid etc., and in pharmacy, specially in the form\r\nof salvarsan and neosalvarsan, it is not surprising that the Germans\r\nshould have endeavored to discover an arsenic derivative which would\r\nbe of value from the point of view of chemical warfare. Very early in\r\nthe war persistent rumors were circulated that the Germans were to\r\nuse arsine. These rumors led to the use of sodium permanganate in the\r\ncanister, but as far as is known, no arsine was actually used. Another\r\nsuggestion which received considerable attention from American workers\r\nwas the use of arsenides, which might decompose under the influence of\r\nthe atmospheric moisture with the liberation of arsine. Calculation of\r\nthe amount of arsenide necessary to establish a lethal concentration\r\nof arsine showed, however, that there was no possibility of using the\r\nmaterial on the field.\r\n\r\nBecause of the use of arsenic trichloride in the manufacture of organic\r\narsenic compounds, a method of preparation was developed from arsenic\r\ntrioxide and sulfur chloride or hydrogen chloride. It was also shown\r\nexperimentally that the phosgene of the tail gas of phosgene plants\r\nmight be converted into arsenic trichloride by reaction with arsenic\r\ntrioxide. Charcoal is the catalyzer of this reaction.\r\n\r\nArsenic trichloride is also of interest because it was one of the\r\nconstituents of the mixture vincennite, early used by the French.\r\nThis was a mixture of hydrocyanic acid, stannic chloride, arsenic\r\ntrichloride and chloroform. While extensively used at first, it was\r\ngradually replaced by phosgene.\r\n\r\nArsenic triflouride was also prepared by the action of sulfuric acid\r\nupon a mixture of calcium flouride and arsenic trioxide. The compound\r\nis very easily decomposed by the moisture of the air, and furthermore\r\nis not very toxic.\r\n\r\nOrganic arsenic derivatives are the most important compounds\r\nfrom the military point of view. The first substance used was\r\ndiphylchloroarsine, a white solid, which readily penetrated the\r\ncanister and caused sneezing. This was used alone, and in solution in\r\nphenyl dichloroarsine. Later methyl and ethyl dichloroarsines were\r\nintroduced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 38.—Apparatus for the Manufacture of\r\nMethyldichloroarsine.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHYLDICHLOROARSINE\r\n\r\nThe Germans apparently used ethyldichloroarsine because they had no\r\nsuitable method for the preparation of methyl dichloroarsine, which is\r\na more satisfactory material. The Chemical Warfare Service developed\r\nthe following method of preparation of the methyl derivative. Sodium\r\narsenite (Na₃AsO₃) is prepared by dissolving arsenic trioxide in sodium\r\nhydroxide solution. The action of methyl sulfate at 850 C. gives\r\ndisodium methyl arsenite, Na₂CH₃AsO₃. Sulfur dioxide reduces the\r\narsenite to methyl arsine oxide, CH₃AsO, which is then reacted with\r\nhydrochloric acid to give methyl dichloroarsine. The final product is\r\ndistilled from the mixture and condensed. This material costs from two\r\nto two and a half dollars per pound for chemicals (war prices).\r\n\r\nMethyldichloroarsine is a colorless liquid of powerful burning odor,\r\nwhich boils at 132° C. It is somewhat soluble in water and is soluble\r\nin organic solvents. The specific gravity is 1.838 at 20° C. The vapor\r\npressure at 25° was found to be 10.83 mm. mercury. Not only is the\r\nmaterial toxic but it has remarkable vesicant properties, comparing\r\nfavorably with mustard gas in this respect.\r\n\r\nEthyldichloroarsine, which was used by the Germans, was prepared by\r\nthe method given above, using ethyl sulfate, but the yield was never\r\nover 20 per cent. In general this has properties similar to the methyl\r\nderivative.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIPHENYLCHLOROARSINE\r\n\r\nThe best known of the arsenicals, however, is diphenylchloroarsine or\r\nsneezing gas. Although this is an old compound (having been prepared\r\nby German chemists in 1885), there was no method for its preparation\r\non a large scale when, first introduced into chemical warfare. It\r\nwas finally discovered that the interaction of triphenyl arsine with\r\narsenic trichloride was fairly satisfactory and a plant was erected for\r\nits manufacture.\r\n\r\nWhen pure, diphenylchloroarsine is a colorless solid, melting at 44°.\r\nBecause of this, it was always used in solution in a toxic gas or in\r\na shell which contained a large amount of explosive so that on the\r\nopening of the shell the material would be finely divided and scattered\r\nover a wide territory.\r\n\r\nIts value lay in the fact that the fine particles readily penetrated\r\nthe ordinary mask and caused the irritation of the nose and throat,\r\nwhich resulted in sneezing. This necessitated the perfection of special\r\nsmoke filters to remove the particles, after which the other toxic\r\nmaterials were removed by the absorbent in the canister.\r\n\r\nIt causes sneezing and severe burning sensations in the nose, throat\r\nand lungs in concentrations as slight as 1 part in 10 million. In\r\nhigher concentrations, say 1 in 200 to 500 thousand it causes severe\r\nvomiting. While neither of these effects are dangerous or very lasting,\r\nstill higher concentrations are serious, as in equal concentrations\r\ndiphenylchloroarsine is more poisonous than phosgene.\r\n\r\nVarious other arsenical chemicals were developed in the laboratory,\r\nbut with one or two exceptions they were not as valuable as\r\ndiphenylchloroarsine and methyldichloroarsine and were therefore\r\ndiscarded.\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMAN METHODS FOR MANUFACTURING ARSENICALS[23]\r\n\r\n\r\nDIPHENYLCHLOROARSINE\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: Norris, _J. Ind. Eng. Chem._, =11=, 825 (1919).]\r\n\r\n    “This substance (Blue Cross) was a famous gas of the\r\n    Germans and was made in large quantities. The method\r\n    used by the Germans was different from the one worked\r\n    out by the Allies, and on account of the fact that the\r\n    German method could be carried out without specially\r\n    designed apparatus and required as raw materials\r\n    substances readily obtainable, it was probably\r\n    preferable. It is doubtful, however, whether the Allies\r\n    would have made this gas, for as the result of its\r\n    use no fatalities were reported. The German process\r\n    consisted in preparing phenylarsenic acid by condensing\r\n    benzene diazonium chloride with sodium arsenite.\r\n    The acid was next reduced by sulfur dioxide to\r\n    phenylarsenous acid, which was, in turn, condensed with\r\n    the diazonium compound to form diphenylarsenic acid.\r\n    This acid was reduced to diphenylarsenous oxide, which\r\n    with hydrochloric acid yielded diphenylchloroarsine.\r\n    The chemical equations for the reactions will make\r\n    clearer the steps involved.\r\n\r\n                C₆H₅N₂Cl + Na₃AsO₃ = C₆H₅AsO₃Na₂ + NaCl + N₂\r\n                C₆H₅AsO₃Na₂ + 2HCl = C₆H₅AsO₃H₂ + 2NaCl\r\n              C₆H₅AsO₃H₂ + SO₂+H₂O = C₆H₅AsO₂H₂ + H₂SO₄\r\n            C₆H₅N₂Cl + C₆H₅AsO₂Na₂ = (C₆H₅)₂AsO₂Na + NaCl + N₂\r\n               (C₆H₅)₂AsO₂Na + HCl = (C₆H₅)₂AsO₂H + NaCl\r\n        2(C₆H₅)₂AsO₂H + 2SO₂ + H₂O = [(C₆H₅)₂As]₂O + 2H₂SO₄\r\n              [(C₆H₅)₂As]₂O + 2HCl = 2(C₆H₅)₂AsCl + H₂O.\r\n\r\n    “The entire process was carried out at Höchst. The\r\n    method used at Höchst was as follows: In preparing\r\n    the diazonium solution, 3 kg.-mols of aniline were\r\n    dissolved in 3000 liters of water and the theoretical\r\n    quantity of hydrochloric acid. The temperature of\r\n    the solution was reduced to between 0° and 5° and\r\n    the theoretical amount of sodium nitrite added.\r\n    The reaction was carried out in a wooden tank of\r\n    the usual form for the preparation of diazonium\r\n    compounds. A solution of sodium arsenite was prepared\r\n    which contained 20 per cent excess of oxide over\r\n    that required to react with the aniline used. The\r\n    arsenous oxide was dissolved in sodium carbonate, care\r\n    being taken to have enough of the alkali present to\r\n    neutralize all of the acid present in the solution\r\n    of the diazonium salt. To the solution of the sodium\r\n    arsenite were added 20 kg. of copper sulfate dissolved\r\n    in water, this being the amount required when 3\r\n    kg.-mols of aniline are used. The solution of the\r\n    diazonium compound was allowed to flow slowly into\r\n    the solution of the arsenite while the temperature\r\n    was maintained at 15°. The mixture was constantly\r\n    stirred during the addition which requires about 3\r\n    hrs. After the reaction was complete, the material\r\n    was passed through a filter press in order to remove\r\n    the coupling agent and the tar which had been formed.\r\n    Hydrochloric acid was next added to the clear solution\r\n    to precipitate phenylarsenic acid, the last portions of\r\n    which were removed by the addition of salt.\r\n\r\n    “The phenylarsenic acid was next reduced to\r\n    phenylarsenous acid by means of a solution of sodium\r\n    bisulfite, about 20 per cent excess of the latter\r\n    over the theoretical amount being used. For 100 parts\r\n    of arsenic acid, 400 parts of solution were used.\r\n    The reaction was carried out in a wooden vessel and\r\n    the mixture stirred during the entire operation. A\r\n    temperature of 80° was maintained by means of a steam\r\n    coil. Phenylarsenous acid separated as an oil. The\r\n    aqueous solution was decanted from the oil, which was\r\n    dissolved in a solution of sodium hydroxide, 40° Bé.\r\n    The solution of the sodium salt of phenylarsenous\r\n    acid was treated with water so that the resulting\r\n    solution had a volume of 6 cu. m. when 3 kg.-mols of\r\n    the salt were present. Ice was next added to reduce the\r\n    temperature to 15° and a solution of benzene diazonium\r\n    chloride, prepared in the manner described for the\r\n    first operation, was slowly added. After the coupling,\r\n    diphenylarsenic acid was precipitated by means of\r\n    hydrochloric acid. The acid was removed by means of a\r\n    filter press and dissolved in hydrochloric acid, 20°\r\n    Bé. For one part of diphenylarsenic acid, 3 parts of\r\n    hydrochloric acid were used. Into this solution was\r\n    passed 5 per cent excess of sulfur dioxide over that\r\n    required for the reduction. The sulfur dioxide used was\r\n    obtained from cylinders which contained it in liquid\r\n    condition.\r\n\r\n    “The reduction was carried out in an iron tank lined\r\n    with tiles and a temperature of 80° was maintained.\r\n    About 8 hrs. were required for the reaction. The\r\n    diphenylarsenic acid on reduction by the sulfur dioxide\r\n    was converted into diphenylarsenous oxide which, in\r\n    the presence of the hydrochloric acid, was converted\r\n    into diphenylchloroarsine, which separated as an oil.\r\n    The oil was next removed and heated in the best vacuum\r\n    obtainable until it was dry and free from hydrochloric\r\n    acid. The compound melted at 34°. It was placed in iron\r\n    tanks for shipment. The yield of diphenylchloroarsine\r\n    calculated from the aniline used was from 25 to 30 per\r\n    cent of the theoretical. No marked trouble was observed\r\n    in handling the materials and no serious poisoning\r\n    cases were reported.\r\n\r\nDIPHENYLCYANOARSINE\r\n\r\n“This compound was prepared by treating diphenylchloroarsine with a\r\nsaturated aqueous solution of potassium or sodium cyanide.\r\n\r\n    (C₆H₅)₂AsCl + NaCN = (C₆H₅)₂AsCN + NaCl.\r\n\r\nFive per cent excess of the alkaline cyanide was used. The reaction\r\nwas carried out at 60° with vigorous stirring. The yield was nearly\r\ntheoretical.\r\n\r\n\r\nETHYLDICHLOROARSINE\r\n\r\n“This compound was prepared at Höchst from ethylarsenous oxide which\r\nwas obtained from the Badische Anilin und Soda Fabrik.\r\n\r\n“PREPARATION OF ETHYLARSENOUS OXIDE—The compound was prepared by\r\ntreating sodium arsenite with ethyl chloride under pressure. The\r\nresulting sodium salt of ethylarsenic acid was converted into the free\r\nacid and reduced by sulfur dioxide. The ethylarsenous acid formed in\r\nthis way lost water and was thereby transformed into ethylarsenous\r\noxide. The reactions involved are as follows:\r\n\r\n          C₂H₅Cl + Na₃AsO₃ = C₂H₅AsO₃Na₂ + NaCl\r\n       C₂H₅AsO₃Na₂ + 2 HCl = C₂H₅AsO₃H₂ + 2 NaCl\r\n    C₂H₅AsO₃H₂ + SO₂ + H₂O = C₂H₅AsO₂H₂ + H₂SO₄\r\n               2C₂H₅AsO₂H₂ = (C₂H₅As)₂O + H₂O.\r\n\r\n“The ethyl chloride used in the preparation was in part made in this\r\nfactory, and in part received from other sources. As ethyl chloride\r\nis an important product used in peace time, it is not, therefore,\r\nessentially a war product and its preparation was not described.\r\n\r\n“In preparing the solution of sodium arsenite, one molecular weight\r\nof arsenous oxide was dissolved in a solution containing 8 molecular\r\nweights of sodium hydroxide. The solution of the base was prepared from\r\na 50 per cent solution of sodium hydroxide to which enough solid alkali\r\nwas added to make the solution a 55 per cent one. In one operation 660\r\nkg. of arsenous oxide were used. For 100 parts of arsenous oxide, 130\r\nparts of ethyl chloride were used, this being the theoretical amount of\r\nthe latter.\r\n\r\n“The reaction was carried out in a steel autoclave of about 300 liters\r\ncapacity. The temperature was maintained at between 90° and 95°. The\r\nethyl chloride was pumped in, in 3 or 4 portions, and the pressure\r\nin the autoclave was kept at from 10 to 15 atmospheres. The several\r\nportions of ethyl chloride were introduced at intervals of about 1½\r\nhrs. During the entire reaction, the contents of the autoclave were\r\nvigorously stirred. After all the ethyl chloride had been added, the\r\nmaterial was stirred from 12 to 16 hrs., at the end of which time\r\nthe pressure had fallen to about 6 atmospheres. The excess of ethyl\r\nchloride and the alcohol formed in the reaction were next distilled\r\noff. At this point a sample of the solution was drawn off for testing.\r\nThis was done by determining the amount of arsenite present in the\r\nsolution. If not more than 20 per cent of sodium arsenite had not\r\nreacted, the preparation was considered satisfactory. Water was then\r\nadded to the contents of the autoclave in sufficient amount to dissolve\r\nthe solid material. The product was next drawn over into a tank and\r\nneutralized with sulfuric acid. It was then treated with sulfur dioxide\r\ngas until there was an excess of the latter present. The mixture was\r\nthen heated to about 70° when the ethylarsenous oxide precipitated as\r\na heavy oil. This was readily separated and shipped without further\r\npurification. The yield of ethylarsenous oxide, from arsenic oxide, was\r\nfrom 80 to 82 per cent of a product which contained about 93 per cent\r\nof pure ethylarsenous oxide.\r\n\r\n“PREPARATION OF ETHYLDICHLOROARSINE—The compound was prepared by\r\ntreating ethylarsenous oxide with hydrochloric acid. The reaction is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    C₂H₅AsO + 2HCl = C₂H₅AsCl + H₂O.\r\n\r\nThe operation was carried out in an iron kettle lined with lead, which\r\nwas cooled externally by means of water and which was furnished with\r\na lead covered stirrer. To the kettle, which contained from 500 to\r\n1000 kg. of hydrochloric acid left over from the previous operation,\r\nwere added 4000 kg. of ethylarsenous oxide. The gaseous hydrochloric\r\nacid was next led in. The kettle was kept under slightly diminished\r\npressure in order to assist in the introduction of hydrochloric acid.\r\nThe temperature during the reaction must not rise above 95°. When\r\nthe hydrochloric acid was no longer absorbed and was contained in\r\nappreciable quantities in the issuing gases, the operation was stopped.\r\nThis usually occurred at the end of from one to two days. The product\r\nof the reaction was drawn off by means of a water pump and heated in a\r\nvacuum until drops of oil passed over. The residue was passed over to\r\na measuring tank and finally to tank-wagons made of iron. The yield of\r\nthe product was practically the theoretical.\r\n\r\nOn account of the volatility of the compound and its poisonous\r\ncharacter, the apparatus in which it was prepared was surrounded by\r\nan octagonal box, the sides of which were fitted with glass windows.\r\nThrough this chamber a constant supply of air was drawn. This was led\r\ninto a chimney where the poisonous vapors were burned. The gases given\r\noff during the distillation of the product were passed through a water\r\nscrubber.”\r\n\r\n\r\n“LEWISITE”\r\n\r\nThe one arsenical which created the most discussion during the War, and\r\nabout which many wild stories were circulated, was “Lewisite,” or as\r\nthe press called it, “Methyl.” Its discovery and perfection illustrate\r\nthe possibilities of research as applied to Chemical Warfare, and\r\npoints to the need of a permanent organization to carry on such work\r\nwhen the pressure of the situation does not demand such immediate\r\nresults.\r\n\r\nThe reaction of ethylene and sulfur chloride, which led to the\r\npreparation of mustard gas, naturally led the organic chemists\r\nto investigate the reaction of this gas and other unsaturated\r\nhydrocarbons, such as acetylene, upon other inorganic chlorides, such\r\nas arsenic, antimony and tin. There was little absorption of the\r\ngas, either at atmospheric or higher pressures, and upon distilling\r\nthe reaction product, most of the gas was evolved, showing that no\r\nchemical reaction had taken place. However, when a catalyser, in the\r\nform of aluminium chloride, was added, Capt. Lewis found that there\r\nwas a vigorous reaction and that a highly vesicant product was formed.\r\nThe possibilities of this compound were immediately recognized and\r\nthe greatest secrecy was maintained regarding all the details of\r\npreparation and of the properties of this new product. At the close\r\nof the War, this was considered one of the most valuable of Chemical\r\nWarfare secrets, and therefore publication of the reactions involved\r\nwere withheld. Unfortunately or otherwise, the British later decided\r\nto release the material for publication, and details may be found in\r\nan article by Green and Price in the _Journal of the Chemical Society_\r\nfor April, 1921. It must be emphasized that the credit for this work\r\nbelongs, not to these authors, but to Capt. W. Lee Lewis and the men\r\nwho worked with him at the Catholic University branch of the American\r\nUniversity Division (the Research Division of the C. W. S.).\r\n\r\nOn a laboratory scale, acetylene is bubbled through a mixture of 440\r\ngrams of anhydrous arsenic trichloride and 300 grams of anhydrous\r\naluminium chloride. Absorption is rapid and much heat is developed.\r\nAfter six hours, about 100 grams of acetylene is absorbed. The reaction\r\nproduct was dark colored and viscid, and had developed a very powerful\r\nodor, suggestive of pelargoniums. Attempts to distill this product\r\nalways led to violent explosions. (It may be stated here that Lewis was\r\nable to perfect a method of distillation and separation of the products\r\nformed, so that pure materials could be obtained, with little or no\r\ndanger of explosion.) The English chemists therefore decomposed the\r\nproduct with ice-cold hydrochloric acid solution of constant boiling\r\npoint (this suggestion was the result of work done by Lewis). The\r\nresulting oil was then distilled in a current of vapor obtained from\r\nconstant boiling hydrochloric acid and finally fractionated into three\r\nparts.\r\n\r\nThe first product obtained consist in the addition of one\r\nacetylene to the arsenic trichloride molecule, and, chemically, is\r\nchlorovinyldichloroarsine, CHCl: CH·AsCl₂, a colorless or faintly\r\nyellow liquid, boiling at 93° at a pressure of 26 mm. A small quantity,\r\neven in very dilute solution, applied to the skin causes painful\r\nblistering, its virulence in this respect approaching that of mustard\r\ngas. It is more valuable than mustard gas, however, in that it is\r\nabsorbed through the skin, and as stated on page 23, three drops,\r\nplaced on the abdomen of a rat, will cause death in from one to three\r\nhours. It is also a very powerful respiratory irritant, the mucous\r\nmembrane of the nose being attacked and violent sneezing induced. More\r\nprolonged exposure leads to severe pain in the throat and chest.\r\n\r\nThe second fraction (β, β′-dichlorodivinylchloroarsine) is a product\r\nresulting from the addition of two acetylene molecules to one arsenic\r\ntrichloride, and boils at 130° to 133° at 26 mm. It is much less\r\npowerful as a vesicant than chlorovinyldichloroarsine, but its irritant\r\nproperties on the respiratory system are much more intense.\r\n\r\nThe third fraction, β, β′, β″-trichlorotrivinylarsine, (CHCl: CH)₃As,\r\nis a colorless liquid, boiling at 151° to 155° at 28 mm., which\r\nsolidifies at 3° to 4°. It is neither a strong vesicating agent nor a\r\npowerful respiratory irritant. At the same time, its odor is pungent\r\nand most unpleasant and it induces violent sneezing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nCARBON MONOXIDE\r\n\r\n\r\nCarbon monoxide, because of its cheapness, accessibility and ease of\r\nmanufacture, has been frequently considered as a possible war gas.\r\nActually, it appears never to have been used intentionally for such\r\npurposes. There are several reasons for this. First, its temperature of\r\nliquefaction at atmospheric pressure is -139° C. This means too high a\r\npressure in the bomb or shell at ordinary temperatures. Secondly, the\r\nweight of carbon monoxide is only slightly less than that of air, which\r\nkeeps it from rolling into depressions, dugouts and trenches, as in\r\nthe case of ordinary gases, and also permits of its rather rapid rise\r\nand dissipation into the surrounding atmosphere. A third reason is its\r\ncomparatively low toxic value, which is only about one-fifth that of\r\nphosgene. However, as it can be breathed without any discomfort, and as\r\nit has some delay action, its lack of poisonous properties would not\r\nseriously militate against its use were it not for the other reasons\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nIt is, nevertheless, a source of serious danger both in marine and\r\nland warfare. Defective ventilation in the boiler rooms of ships\r\nand fires below decks, both in and out of action, are especially\r\ndangerous because of the carbon monoxide which is produced. In one of\r\nthe naval engagements between the Germans and the English, defective\r\nhigh explosive shell, after penetrating into enclosed portions of the\r\nship, evolved large quantities of carbon monoxide and thus killed some\r\nhundreds of men. On shore, machine gun fire in enclosed spaces, such\r\nas pill boxes, and in tanks, liberates relatively large quantities of\r\ncarbon monoxide. Similarly, in mining and sapping work, the carbon\r\nmonoxide liberated by the detonation of high explosives constitutes one\r\nof the most serious of the difficulties connected with this work and\r\nnecessitated elaborate equipment and extensive military training in\r\nmine rescue work.\r\n\r\nThe removal of carbon monoxide from the air is difficult because of its\r\nphysical and chemical properties. Its low boiling point and critical\r\ntemperature makes adequate adsorption at ordinary temperatures by the\r\nuse of an active absorbent out of the question. Its known insolubility\r\nin all solvents similarly precludes its removal by physical absorption.\r\n\r\nAfter extensive investigation two absorbents have been found.[24] The\r\nfirst of these consists in a mixture of iodine pentoxide and fuming\r\nsulfuric acid, with pumice stone as a carrier. Using a layer 10 cm.\r\ndeep and passing a 1 per cent carbon monoxide air mixture at the rate\r\nof 500 cc. per minute per sq. cm. cross section, a 100%-90% removal\r\nof the gas could be secured for two hours at room temperature and\r\nalmost as long at 0° C. The reaction is not instantaneous, and a brief\r\ninduction period always occurs. This may be reduced to a minimum by the\r\naddition of a little iodine to the original mixture.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: Complete details of this work may be found in _J. Ind.\r\nEng. Chem._, =12=, 213 (1920).]\r\n\r\nThe sulfur trioxide given off is very irritating to the lungs, but\r\nby the use of a layer of active charcoal beyond the carbon monoxide\r\nabsorbent, this disadvantage was almost completely eliminated. However,\r\nsulfur dioxide is slowly formed as a result of this adsorption and\r\nafter prolonged standing or long-continued use of the canister at a\r\nhigh rate of gas flow gives serious trouble.\r\n\r\nConsiderable heat is given off in the reaction and a cooling attachment\r\nwas required. The most satisfactory device was a metal box filled\r\nwith fused sodium thiosulfate pentahydrate, which absorbed a very\r\nconsiderable amount of the heat.\r\n\r\nStill a further disadvantage was the fact that the adsorbents became\r\nspent by use, even in the absence of carbon monoxide, since it absorbed\r\nenough moisture from the air of average humidity in several hours, to\r\ndestroy its activity.\r\n\r\nThe difficulties mentioned were so troublesome that this absorbent was\r\nfinally supplanted by the more satisfactory oxide absorbent described\r\nbelow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.—Diagram of Carbon Monoxide Canister, CMA3.]\r\n\r\nThe metallic oxide mixture was the direct result of an observation that\r\nspecially precipitated copper oxide with 1 per cent silver oxide was an\r\nefficient catalyst for the oxidation of arsine by oxygen. After a study\r\nof various oxide mixtures, it was found that a mixture of manganese\r\ndioxide and silver oxide, or a three component system containing\r\ncobaltic oxide, manganese dioxide and silver oxide in the proportion of\r\n20:34:46 catalyzed the reaction of carbon monoxide at room temperature.\r\nThe studies were extended and it was soon found that the best catalysts\r\ncontained active manganese dioxide as the chief constituent. This was\r\nprepared by the reaction between potassium permanganate and anhydrous\r\nmanganese sulfate in the presence of fairly concentrated sulfuric acid.\r\nIt also developed that the minimum silver oxide content decreased\r\nprogressively as the number of components increased from 2 to 4. The\r\nstandard catalyst (Hopcalite) finally adopted for production consisted\r\nof 50 per cent manganese dioxide, 30 per cent copper oxide, 15 per cent\r\ncobaltic oxide and 5 per cent silver oxide. The mixture was prepared\r\nby precipitating and washing the first three oxides separately, and\r\nthen precipitating the silver oxide in the mixed sludge. After washing,\r\nthis sludge was run through a filter press, kneaded in a machine, the\r\ncake dried and ground to size. While it is not difficult to obtain a\r\nproduct which is catalytically active, it requires a vigorous control\r\nof all the conditions and operations to assure a product at once\r\nactive, hard, dense and resistant as possible to the deleterious action\r\nof water vapor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.—Tanks and Press for Small Scale Manufacture of\r\nCarbon Monoxide Absorbent.]\r\n\r\nHopcalite acts catalytically and therefore only a layer sufficiently\r\ndeep to insure close contact of all the air with the catalyst is\r\nneeded. One and a half inches (310 gm.) were found ample for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThe normal activity of Hopcalite requires a dry gas mixture. This was\r\nsecured by placing a three-inch layer of dry granular calcium chloride\r\nat the inlet side of the canister.\r\n\r\nBecause of the evolution of heat, a cooling arrangement was also used\r\nin the Hopcalite canisters.\r\n\r\nThe life of this canister was the same irrespective of whether its use\r\nwas continuous or intermittent. The higher the temperature the longer\r\nthe life because Hopcalite is less sensitive to water vapors at higher\r\ntemperatures. Since, if the effluent air was sufficiently dried, the\r\nHopcalite should function indefinitely against any concentration of\r\ncarbon monoxide, the life of the canister is limited solely by the life\r\nof the drier. Therefore the net gain in weight is a sure criterion of\r\nits condition. After many tests it was determined that any canister\r\nwhich had gained more than 35 grams above its original weight should\r\nbe withdrawn. The canisters, at the time of breakdown, showed a gain\r\nin weight varying between 42 and 71 grams, with a average of 54 grams.\r\nIt is really, therefore, the actual humidity of the air in which the\r\ncanister is used that determines its life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.—Navy Head Mask and Canister.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nDEVELOPMENT OF THE GAS MASK\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile in ordinary warfare the best defense against any implement of\r\nwar is a vigorous offense with the same weapon, Chemical Warfare\r\npresents a new point of view. Here it is very important to make use of\r\nall defensive measures against attack. Because of the nature of the\r\nmaterials used, it has been found possible to furnish, not only general\r\nprotection, but also continuous protection during the time the gas is\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nThe first consideration in the protection of troops against a gas\r\nattack is the provision of an efficient individual protective appliance\r\nfor each soldier. The gas attack of April 22, 1915 found the Allies\r\nentirely unprepared and unprotected against poisonous gas. While a few\r\nof the men had the presence of mind to protect themselves by covering\r\ntheir faces with wet cloths, the majority of them became casualties.\r\nImmediately steps were taken to improvise protective devices among\r\nwhich were gags, made with rags soaked in water or washing soda\r\nsolution, handkerchiefs filled with moist earth, etc. One suggestion\r\nwas to use bottles with the bottom knocked off and filled with moist\r\nearth. The breath was to be taken in through the bottle and let out\r\nthrough the nose; but as bottles were scarce and few of them survived\r\nthe attempt to get the bottom broken off, the idea was of no value.\r\n\r\nThe first masks were made by the women of England in response to the\r\nappeal by Lord Kitchener; they consisted of cotton wool wrapped in\r\nmuslin or veiling and were to be kept moist with water, soda solution\r\nor hypo.\r\n\r\n\r\nENGLISH MASKS\r\n\r\n=The Black Veiling Respirator.= The first form of the English mask is\r\nknown as the Black Veiling respirator and consisted of cotton waste\r\nenclosed in a length of black veiling. The waste was soaked in a\r\nsolution of:\r\n\r\n    Sodium thiosulphate     10   lbs.\r\n    Washing soda             2.5 lbs.\r\n    Glycerine                2   lbs.\r\n    Water                    2   gals.\r\n\r\nThe glycerine was put in to keep the respirator moist, thus obviating\r\nthe need for dipping before use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.—Early Gas Protection.]\r\n\r\nThe respirator was adjusted over the mouth and nose, the cotton waste\r\nbeing molded to the shape of the face and the upper edge of the veiling\r\npulled up so as to protect the eyes. These respirators were used in\r\nthe attacks of May 10th and 12th, 1915 and were reasonably efficient\r\nagainst the low concentration of chlorine then used; they were\r\ndifficult to fit exactly to the face, which resulted in leakage. The\r\ncotton waste often became lumpy and had to be shredded out or discarded.\r\n\r\n=The Hypo Helmet.= The next development of the British protection was\r\nthe so-called Hypo helmet. This is said to have resulted from the\r\nsuggestion of a Canadian sergeant that he had seen a German pulling a\r\nbag over his head during a gas attack. It consisted of a flannel bag\r\nsoaked in the same solution as was used for the veiling respirator and\r\nwas fitted with a pane of mica as a window. The helmet was tucked down\r\ninside the jacket which was then buttoned up tightly around the neck.\r\nAs may be seen from Figure 43, this would not prove very satisfactory\r\nwith the American type of uniform.\r\n\r\nThis helmet had many advantages over the veiling respirator but the\r\nwindow often became cracked or broken from the rough treatment in the\r\ntrenches. Later the mica was replaced by celluloid and still later by\r\nglass eyepieces set in metal rings. These were very effective against\r\nchlorine in the field.\r\n\r\n=The P and PH Helmets.= During the summer of 1915 it became evident\r\nthat phosgene-chlorine mixtures would be used in gas attacks and it\r\nwas therefore necessary to provide protection against this. The hypo\r\nhelmet, which offered no protection against phosgene, was soaked in\r\nan alkaline solution of sodium phenolate (carbolic acid) containing\r\nglycerine, and with this new form of impregnation was called the P\r\nhelmet. It protected against 300 parts of phosgene in a million of air.\r\nSince this solution attacks flannel, two layers of flannelette were\r\nused. The helmet was further improved by the addition of an expiratory\r\nvalve, partly to prevent the man from breathing any of his own breath\r\nover again and partly to prevent the deterioration of the alkali of the\r\nmask by the carbon dioxide of the expired air.\r\n\r\nThe protection was later further increased by the addition of\r\nhexamethylenetetramine, and this mask is known as the PH helmet. This\r\nincreased the protection to 1,000 p.p.m.\r\n\r\nThe early types of helmet offered no protection against lachrymators.\r\nFor this purpose goggles were used, the later types of which had glass\r\neyepieces and were fitted around the eyes by means of rubber sponge.\r\nWhile intended for use only after a lachrymatory bombardment, the\r\ntroops frequently used them during and after an ordinary gas attack\r\nwhen the mask should have been worn. Consequently they were withdrawn.\r\n\r\nThe PH helmet was unsatisfactory because of the following reasons:\r\n\r\n    (1) It was warm and stuffy in summer;\r\n    (2) It deteriorated upon exposure to air;\r\n    (3) It was incapable of further development;\r\n    (4) It had a peculiar odor and, when wet, frequently\r\n        burned the foreheads of the men;\r\n    (5) It offered practically no protection against\r\n        lachrymators.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.—Method of Wearing the P. H. Helmet.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.—Early Type of Standard (British) Box Respirator\r\n(S. B. R.)]\r\n\r\n=Box Respirator.= The increasing concentration of gas from cylinder\r\nattacks and the introduction of shell, with such gases as chloropicrin\r\nand superpalite, led, early in 1916, to very definite and constructive\r\nefforts on the part of the British to increase the protection offered\r\nby the mask. The result was a “polyvalent” respirator of the canister\r\ntype (the Standard Box Respirator). This mask was probably the result\r\nof experience with oxygen apparatus in mine rescue work. The lines on\r\nwhich this canister was modeled involved the use of a canister filled\r\nwith highly sensitive absorbent charcoal mixed with or alternating\r\nin layers with oxidizing granules of alkaline permanganate. It was\r\nthe result of innumerable experiments, partly conducted in France\r\nbut mostly in England under the direction of the late Lieut. Col.\r\nHarrison, who was almost entirely responsible for the wonderful\r\nproduction of this respirator.\r\n\r\nThe respirator (Figure 44) consisted of the canister mentioned above,\r\nwhich is attached by a flexible tube to a facepiece or mask. The\r\nfacepiece is made of rubberized fabric and fits the face so that there\r\nis little or no leakage. This is secured by means of tape and elastic\r\nbands which fit over the head. The nose is closed by means of clips,\r\nwhich are wire springs with rubbered jaws covered with gauze (Fig.\r\n45). Breathing is done through a mouthpiece of rubber; the teeth close\r\non the rubber tabs and the rubber flange lies between the teeth and\r\nthe lips. The expired air finds exit through a rubber flutter valve\r\nin an angle tube just outside the mask. This arrangement furnishes a\r\ndouble line of protection; if the face piece is punctured or torn,\r\ngas-containing air cannot be breathed as long as the noseclip and\r\nmouthpiece are in position.\r\n\r\nThe early English canister was packed with 675 cc. of 8-14 mesh war gas\r\nmixture, 40 per cent of which was wood charcoal and 60 per cent reddish\r\nbrown soda-lime granules. The metal dome at the bottom of the can was\r\ncovered with a thin film of cotton. At two-thirds of the distance to\r\nthe top was placed a paper filter and a heavy wire screen which differs\r\nfrom our heavy screen in that it is more loosely woven. The mixture\r\nwas covered with a cotton filter pad and a wire screen, over which was\r\nplaced the wire spring.\r\n\r\nThe use of this mask ensures that all the air breathed must enter the\r\nlungs through the canister. This air passage is entirely independent\r\nof leaks in the facepiece, due either to a poor fit about the face\r\nor to actual leakage (from a cut or tear) of the fabric itself. The\r\nfacepiece is readily cleared of poison gases which may leak in. This is\r\naccomplished by taking a full inspiration, releasing the noseclip, and\r\nexhaling through the nose, which forces the air out around the edges of\r\nthe facepiece.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, this type of mask possesses a number of very obvious\r\ndisadvantages, particularly from a military point of view:\r\n\r\nThe extreme discomfort of the facepiece. This discomfort arises from a\r\nnumber of causes certain of which are inherent in this type of mask,\r\namong them being: (_a_) the noseclip, (_b_) the mouthpiece, and (_c_)\r\nthe lack of ventilation within the facepiece chamber.\r\n\r\nAside from the actual physical discomfort of the noseclip and\r\nmouthpiece, which becomes intense after long periods of wearing, this\r\ncombination forces upon the wearer an unnatural method of respiration\r\nto which it is not only difficult to become accustomed, but which also\r\ncauses extreme dryness of the throat. The mouthpiece greatly increases\r\nsalivation and as swallowing is rather more difficult with the nose\r\nclosed, this adds another extremely objectionable feature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.—Interior of S. B. R., Showing Cotton Wrapped\r\nNoseclips.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.—French M-2 Mask.]\r\n\r\nThe lack of ventilation in the facepiece chamber entraps the heat\r\nradiating from the face and retains the moisture which is constantly\r\nevaporating from the skin. This moisture condenses on the eyepieces,\r\nand even if cleared away by the use of a so-called anti-dimming paste,\r\nusually makes vision nearly impossible.\r\n\r\n\r\nFRENCH MASKS\r\n\r\n=M-2 Mask.= The early protection of the French Army was obtained from a\r\nmask of the type M-2 (Fig. 46).\r\n\r\nThis mask consists of a number of layers of muslin impregnated with\r\nvarious absorbent chemicals. A typical mask was made up of 20 layers of\r\ncheesecloth impregnated with _Greasene_ and 20 layers impregnated with\r\n_Complexene_. These solutions were made up as follows:\r\n\r\n    Complexene:  39.0 lbs.  Hexamethylenetetramine\r\n                 37.5 lbs.  Glycerine\r\n                 27.5 lbs.  Nickel sulfate (NiSO₄.7 H₂O)\r\n                 11.8 lbs.  Sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃)\r\n                            Water\r\n\r\n    Greasene:   107.0 lbs.  Castor oil\r\n                 81.0 lbs.  Alcohol (95%)\r\n                 10.7 lbs.  Glycerine (90%)\r\n                  3.1 lbs.  Sodium hydroxide (NaOH)\r\n\r\nThis mask fits the face tightly and as a consequence the inhaled air\r\ncan be obtained only by drawing it through the pores of the impregnated\r\nfabric. There is no outlet valve. The exhaled air makes its escape\r\nthrough the fabric. The eyepieces are made of a special non-dimming\r\ncelluloid. The mask is protected from rain by a flap of weather proof\r\nfabric, which also protects the absorbent chemicals from deterioration.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the war the United States experimented considerably\r\nwith the French mask. Several modifications of the impregnating\r\nsolutions were suggested, as well as methods of application. One of\r\nthese was to separate the components of the complexene solution and\r\nimpregnate two separate layers of cloth; this would make a three-layer\r\nmask. In view of the phosgene which was in use at that time, the\r\nfollowing arrangement was suggested:\r\n\r\n    20 layers of hexamethylenetetramine,\r\n    10 layers of nickel sulfate-sodium carbonate,\r\n    10 layers of greasene.\r\n\r\nThis arrangement was more effective than the original French mask and\r\noffered the following protection when tested against the following\r\ngases (concentration 1 to 1,000, rate 30 liters per minute):\r\n\r\n    Phosgene           65 minutes\r\n    Hydrocyanic acid   60 minutes\r\n    Chlorine           60 minutes\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.—Interior View of M-2 Mask.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.—French Artillery Mask, Tissot Type.]\r\n\r\n=Tissot Mask.= The French deserve great credit for their development of\r\nthe Tissot type mask. This was first issued to artillerymen, stretcher\r\nbearers, and certain other special classes of soldiers to furnish them\r\nwith protection and yet enable them to work with greater efficiency\r\nbecause of the decrease in resistance to breathing. The mask (Fig.\r\n48) resembles the British box respirator in that it consists of a\r\ncanister and rubber facepiece, but differs in that the mouthpiece and\r\nnoseclip are lacking. The inhaled air enters the mask from two tubes\r\nwhich open directly under the eyepieces and allow the air to sweep\r\nacross them. This removes, by evaporation, the condensed moisture of\r\nthe breath from the eyepieces, which otherwise would obstruct the\r\nvision. The circulation of the fresh air in the mask also removes and\r\ndilutes lachrymatory gases which may filter through the mask. The\r\nexhaled air escapes through a simple outlet valve. This type of mask is\r\nadvantageous because:\r\n\r\n    (1) The facepiece is tight and comfortable.\r\n    (2) The eyepieces do not become dimmed.\r\n    (3) There is no difficulty in speaking.\r\n    (4) Salivation is eliminated because of the absence of the\r\n        mouthpiece.\r\n    (5) It is generally more comfortable than the box respirator.\r\n\r\nThis mask, however, was made of thin rubber of great flexibility which,\r\nwhile affording a perfect fit, did not possess sufficient durability to\r\nrecommend it as the sole defense of the wearer.\r\n\r\nThe canister is markedly different from all other canisters described\r\nin this chapter in that a highly hygroscopic chemical absorbent is\r\nused. An approximate determination showed about 70 per cent sodium\r\nhydroxide. The use of caustic soda in the canister is made possible by\r\nthe intermixing of steel wool with the granules of caustic. A layer of\r\nabsorbent having the appearance of vegetable charcoal is placed at the\r\ntop of the canister.\r\n\r\nThe canister has the shape of a rectangular prism 8 × 6½ × 2½ inches;\r\nand, owing to the use of steel wool, is large in proportion to the\r\nweight of absorbent contained. Valves are supplied which prevent\r\nexhalation through the canister. When not in use the opening in the\r\nbottom of the canister is plugged with a rubber stopper to protect the\r\nabsorbents from moisture. The canister is carried against the body and\r\nis connected to the facepiece with a flexible rubber-fabric tube.\r\n\r\n=A. R. S. Mask (Appareil Respiratoire Special).= One of the latest\r\ntypes of French mask is the so-called A. R. S. mask, which is based\r\nupon, or at least resembles closely, the German mask. This is a frame\r\nmask made from well rubberized balloon material, provided on the inside\r\nwith a lining of oiled or waxed linen and fitted with a drum which\r\nis screwed on. The mask is provided with eyepieces of cellophane,\r\nfastened by metal rings into rubber goggles, which are sewed in the\r\nmask. A metal mouth-ring is tied in the mask with tape. This ring is\r\nplaced somewhat higher than in the German mask, in this way reducing\r\nthe harmful space under the mask. An inlet and outlet valve is placed\r\nin the mouth-ring; the first is of mica while the other, which is in\r\ndirect communication with the interior of the mask, is of rubber. On\r\nthe inside of the mask, in front of the valves, a baffle is sewed in,\r\nwhereby the inhaled air is forced to pass in front of the eyepieces to\r\nprevent dimming and, at the same time, condensed vapor is prevented\r\nfrom entering the valves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.—French A. R. S. Mask.]\r\n\r\nThe mask or head straps are arranged in the same way as on the latest\r\nM-2 mask, i.e., one elastic band is placed across the top of the head\r\nand the other across the back; the two are joined by an elastic. Below\r\nthese two straps is an adjustable elastic neck band. The drum is made\r\nof metal similar in shape to the German drum and fits in the mouth-ring\r\nby means of a thread. It is made tight by a rubber ring as in the\r\nGerman mask. The thread differs from that on the German mask, making\r\nan interchange of canisters impossible. The canister or drum includes\r\na bottom screen, springs and wire screens between the layers. It is\r\nclosed by a perforated bottom. There are three layers. On the top is\r\na thin layer of absorbent cotton. Beneath this is a central layer of\r\ncharcoal, which is a little finer than the German charcoal. The lower\r\nlayer consists of soda-lime, mixed with charcoal and zinc oxide and\r\nmoistened with glycerine.\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMAN MASK\r\n\r\nThe early type of German mask probably served as the model for the\r\nFrench A. R. S. mask. The facepiece was made of rubber, which was later\r\nreplaced by leather because of the shortage of rubber. The following is\r\na good description of a typical German facepiece:\r\n\r\n“The facepiece of the German mask was made of one piece of leather,\r\nwith seams at the chin and at the temples, giving it roughly the shape\r\nof the face. The leather was treated with oil to make it soft and\r\npliable, also to render it impervious to gases. The dressed surface\r\nwas toward the inside of the mask. A circular steel plate, 3 inches\r\nin diameter, was set into the facepiece just opposite the wearer’s\r\nnose and mouth, with a threaded socket into which the drum containing\r\nthe absorbents screwed. A rubber gasket (synthetic?) held in place by\r\na sort of pitch cement, secured a gas-tight joint between the drum\r\nand the facepiece. There were no valves, both inhaled and exhaled air\r\npassing through the canister. The eyepieces were inserted by means\r\nof metal rims with leather washers, and were in two parts: (_a_) a\r\npermanent exterior sheet of transparent material (‘cellon’) resembling\r\ncelluloid, and (_b_) an inner removable disc which functioned as an\r\nanti-dimming device. This latter appeared to be of ‘cellon’ coated on\r\nthe side toward the eye with gelatin, and was held in position by a\r\n‘wheel’ stamped from thin sheet metal, which screwed into the metal\r\nrim of the eyepiece from the inside. The gelatin prevented dimming by\r\nabsorbing the moisture, but wrinkled and blistered and became opaque\r\nafter a few hours’ use, and could not be changed without removing the\r\nmask. The edge of the facepiece all around was provided with a bearing\r\nsurface consisting of a welt of finely woven cloth about one inch wide\r\nsewed to the leather. In some instances this welt was of leather of an\r\ninferior grade. The edge of the facepiece was smoothed over by a coat\r\nof flexible transparent gum, probably a synthetic compound.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.—German Respirator.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.—The German Respirator.]\r\n\r\n     1.

The cylinder is about 10 cm. in diameter and about\r\n5 cm. in length. In the canister are three layers of absorbents of\r\nunequal thickness separated by disks of fine mesh metal screen. The\r\ncanister is shipped in a light sheet iron can 10 cm. in diameter and 8\r\ncm. high. The can is shellacked and is lined with paper packing board.\r\nThe container is made air-tight by sealing with a strip of adhesive\r\ntape.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.—Cross Section of 1917 and 1918 German\r\nCanisters.]\r\n\r\n                      ABSORBENTS.\r\n\r\n     Absorbent.

For ease in assembling\r\nthe sides of the canister have a gentle taper, and are formed so as to\r\nsupply a seat for each of the follower rings. The protrusion or neck\r\nhas about six threads to the inch, the pitch of the screw being 4 mm.\r\nThe lower part of the body is rolled so as to give a finished edge, and\r\nthe upper part of the cylinder is grooved to receive the top support.\r\n\r\nThe first screen is double, consisting of a coarse top screen five to\r\nsix mesh, per linear inch, and immediately below, a finer screen of\r\n30-40 mesh, per linear inch. The top support is a rigid ring of metal\r\nwith two cross arms, which give added, strength to the ring and support\r\nto the screens. It springs into a groove at the top of the body and\r\nforms the support for the contents of the canister. Both screens are\r\nmade of iron wire and the top support is made of iron (probably lightly\r\ntinned).\r\n\r\nThe second screen, which separates the second and third absorbents, is\r\ndouble, consisting of two disks of 30-40 mesh iron screen. Both screens\r\nare held in place by a follower ring.\r\n\r\nThe third screen is single, but otherwise it is exactly similar to the\r\nsecond screen. It serves to keep separate the layers of absorbents No.\r\n1 and No. 2.\r\n\r\nThe fourth screen (30-40 mesh) is made of iron wire and is held to the\r\nbottom support by six cleats which are punched from the body of the\r\nsupport. The bottom support is simply a flanged iron cover for the\r\nbottom of the canister. It is punched with 79 circular holes each 4\r\nmm. in diameter and is painted on the outside to match the body of the\r\ncanister. The screen and the inside of the bottom support or cover are\r\ncoated with a red paint.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMERICAN MASK\r\n\r\nAt the entrance of the United States into the war, three types of masks\r\nwere available: the PH helmet, the British S. B. R. and the French\r\nM-2 masks. Experiments were made on all three of these types, and it\r\nwas soon found that the S. B. R. offered the greatest possibilities,\r\nboth as regards immediate protection and future development. During\r\nthe eighteen months which were devoted to improvement of the American\r\nmask, the facepiece underwent a gradual evolution and the canister\r\npassed through types _A_ to _L_, with many special modifications\r\nfor experimental purposes. The latest development consisted in an\r\nadaptation of the fighting mask to industrial purposes. For this\r\nreason a rather detailed description of the construction of the\r\nfacepiece and of the canister of the respirator in use at the close of\r\nthe war (R. F. K. type) may not be out of place. The mask now adopted\r\nas standard for the U. S. Army and Navy is known as the Model 1919\r\nAmerican mask, with 1920 model carrier, and will be described on page\r\n225.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 53.—Diagrammatic Sketch of Box Respirator Type\r\nMask.]\r\n\r\n=Facepiece.= The facepiece of the R. F. K. type Box Respirator is made\r\nfrom a light weight cotton fabric coated with pure gum rubber, the\r\nfinished fabric having a total thickness of approximately ¹/₁₆ inch.\r\nThe fit of the facepiece is along two lines—first, across the forehead,\r\napproximately from temple to temple; second, from the same temporal\r\npoints down the sides of the face just in front of the ears and under\r\nthe chin as far back as does not interfere with the Adam’s apple. In\r\nsecuring this fit, the piece of stock for the facepiece is died out\r\nof the felt and pleated up around the edges to conform to this line.\r\nAfter this pleating operation, the edges of the fabric are stitched to\r\na binding frame similar to a hat-band made up of felt or velveteen\r\ncovered with rubberized fabric. All the stitching and joints in the\r\nfacepiece are rendered gas-tight by cementing with rubber cement. This\r\nfacepiece is made in five sizes ranging from No. 1 to No. 5, with a\r\nlarge majority of faces fitted by the three intermediate sizes, 2, 3, 4.\r\n\r\n=Harness.= The function of the harness is to hold the mask on the face\r\nin such a way as to insure a gas-tight fit at all points. Because of\r\nthe great variations in the conformation of different heads, this\r\nproblem is not a simple one. Probably, the simplest type of harness, as\r\nwell as the one which is theoretically correct, consists of a harness\r\nin which the line of fit across the forehead is extended into an\r\nelastic band passing around the back of the head, while the line of fit\r\naround the side of the face and chin is similarly extended into another\r\nelastic tape passing over the top of the head; these should be held in\r\nplace by a third tape, preferably non-elastic, attached to the mask at\r\nthe middle of the forehead and to the middle points of the other tapes\r\nat a suitable distance to hold them in their proper positions.\r\n\r\nThe discomfort of the earlier types of harness has been remedied, in\r\na large measure, by the development of a specially woven elastic web\r\nwhich, for a given change in tension, allowed more than double the\r\nstretch of the commercial weaves. There is still much room for valuable\r\nwork in developing a harness which will combine greater comfort and\r\nsafety. The following points should always be observed in harness\r\ndesign:\r\n\r\n(1) The straps should pull in such a direction that as large a\r\ncomponent as possible of the tension of the strap should be available\r\nin actually holding the mask against the face.\r\n\r\n(2) The number of straps should be kept to a minimum in order to\r\navoid tangling and improper positioning when put on in a hurry by an\r\ninexperienced wearer.\r\n\r\n=Eyepieces.= One of the most important parts of the gas mask, from the\r\nmilitary point of view, is the eyepiece. The primary requirement of a\r\ngood eyepiece is that it shall provide a minimum reduction in clarity\r\nof vision with a maximum degree of safety to the wearer. The clarity\r\nof vision may be affected in one of several ways: (1) by abrasion of\r\nthe eyepieces under service conditions; (2) irregularities in the\r\nsurface and thickness of the eyepiece, causing optical dispersion;\r\n(3) absorption of light by the eyepiece itself; (4) dimming of the\r\neyepieces due to condensation of moisture radiating from the face or in\r\nthe exhaled air.\r\n\r\nThree types of eyepieces were used but by the end of the war the first\r\ntwo types had been abandoned.\r\n\r\n(1) Ordinary celluloid.\r\n\r\n(2) Various hygroscopic forms of celluloid, known as non-dimming\r\neyepieces.\r\n\r\n(3) Various combinations of glass and celluloid, known as non-breakable\r\neyepieces.\r\n\r\nCelluloid was used first, due to its freedom from breakage. It is not\r\nsatisfactory because it is rapidly abraded in use, turns yellow, thus\r\nincreasing its light absorption, has relatively uneven optical surfaces\r\nand becomes brittle after service.\r\n\r\nThe various forms of non-dimming lenses function by absorbing the water\r\nwhich condenses on their surfaces, either by combining individual drops\r\ninto a film which does not seriously impair vision, by transmitting\r\nit through the surface and giving it off on the exterior or by a\r\ncombination of these mechanisms. With the exception that they are\r\nnon-dimming, they are open to all the objections of the celluloid\r\neyepiece and, as a matter of fact, were never tried out in the field.\r\n\r\nThe so-called non-breakable eyepieces are formed by cementing together\r\na layer of celluloid between two layers of glass.[25] This results in\r\nan almost perfect eyepiece. Any ordinary blow falling upon such an\r\neyepiece does no more than crack the glass, which remains attached to\r\nthe celluloid coating. Except in extreme cases, the celluloid remains\r\nunbroken and there is relatively slight danger of a cracked eyepiece of\r\nthis sort leaking gas.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25: So-called “Triplex” glass.]\r\n\r\nIn the matter of flying fragments, the type of eyepiece consisting of\r\na single layer of celluloid and glass with the celluloid placed next\r\nto the eye, has probably a slight advantage over the type in which\r\nthere is glass on both sides. However, the superior optical surface of\r\nthe latter type, coupled with its greater freedom from abrasion of the\r\nsurface led to the adoption of this type known as “triplexin” in the\r\nmask produced in the later part of the American manufacturing program.\r\nIt should be pointed out in connection with this type of eyepiece that\r\nit is possible to make it as perfect optically as desired by using the\r\nbetter grades of glass. While the optical properties of these eyepieces\r\nundoubtedly suffer somewhat with age, due to the discoloration of\r\nthe celluloid, it can be safely said that this material, located as\r\nit is between the layers of glass and relatively little exposed to\r\natmospheric conditions, will probably be far less affected in this way\r\nthan is the ordinary celluloid eyepiece.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.—American Box Respirator, Showing Improved\r\nRubber Noseclip.]\r\n\r\nThe position of the eyepiece is very important; the total and the\r\nbinocular fields of vision should be kept at a maximum.\r\n\r\n=noseclip.= The noseclip is probably the most uncomfortable feature\r\nof the types of mask used during the War. While a really comfortable\r\nnose pad is probably impossible, the comfort of the clip was greatly\r\nimproved by using pads of soft rubber and springs giving the minimum\r\ntension necessary to close the nostrils.\r\n\r\n=Mouthpiece.= The design of the mouthpiece should consider the size\r\nand shape of the flange which goes between the lips and teeth; this\r\nshould be such as to prevent leakage of gas into the mouth and should\r\nreduce to a minimum any chafing of the gums. The opening through the\r\nmouthpiece is held distended at its inner end by a metallic bushing\r\nto prevent its collapse, if, under stress of excitement, the jaws\r\nare forced over the flange and closed. Rubber has proved a very\r\nsatisfactory material for this part of the facepiece.\r\n\r\n=Flexible Hose.= The flexible hose leads from the angle tube to the\r\ncanister. This should combine flexibility, freedom from collapse, and\r\nextreme physical ruggedness. These specifications are met successfully\r\nby the stockinette-covered corrugated rubber hose. The angular\r\ncorrugations not only give a high degree of flexibility but are\r\nextremely effective in preventing collapse. The flexibility gained by\r\nthis construction is not only lateral but also longitudinal; a hose\r\nhaving a nominal length of 10 inches functions successfully between\r\nlengths of 8 and 12 inches. The covering of stockinette, which is\r\nvulcanized to the rubber in the manufacturing process, adds materially\r\nto the mechanical strength by preventing incipient tears and breaks.\r\n\r\n=Exhalation Valve.= The exhalation valve allows the exhaled air to pass\r\ndirectly to the outside atmosphere. (This valve is not found on the\r\nGerman mask.) This valve has the following advantages:\r\n\r\n(1) It tends to reduce very materially the dead air space in the mask.\r\n\r\n(2) It prevents deterioration of the absorbent on account of moisture\r\nand carbon dioxide of the expired air.\r\n\r\n(3) It reduces the back pressure against expiration, since it is\r\nunnecessary to breathe out against the resistance of the canister.\r\n\r\nThe disadvantage, which may under certain conditions be very serious,\r\nis that, if for any reason the valve fails to function properly,\r\ninspiration will take place through the valve. It can be readily seen\r\nthat any failure of this nature will allow the poisonous atmosphere to\r\nbe drawn directly into the lungs of the wearer.\r\n\r\nThe type of valve generally used is shown in Fig. 55, which shows one\r\nof these valves mounted and unmounted. While it is rather difficult\r\nto give a clear description of its construction, the valve may be\r\nconsidered as a flattened triangular sack of rubber, whose altitude\r\nis two or three times the base and from which all three corners have\r\nbeen clipped, each giving openings into the interior of the sack. The\r\nopening at the top is slipped over the exhalation passage of the angle\r\ntube, and the air passes out through the other two corners. Closure is\r\nobtained by the combination of two factors,—first, the difference in\r\natmospheric pressure, and second, the tension due to mounting a section\r\nwhich has been cured in the flat over an elliptical opening.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.—American Type Exhale Valve, Mounted and\r\nUnmounted.]\r\n\r\nIn order to protect the flutter valve from injury and from contact with\r\nobjects which might interfere with its proper functioning, the later\r\ntypes of valve were provided with a guard of stamped sheet metal.\r\n\r\n\r\nCANISTERS\r\n\r\nDuring the development of the facepiece, as discussed above, the\r\nAmerican canister underwent changes in design which have been\r\ndesignated as _A_ to _L_. These changes were noted by the different\r\ncolored paints applied to the exterior of the canister.\r\n\r\nType _A_ canister was exactly like the British model then in use,\r\nexcept that it was made one inch longer because it was realized that\r\nthe early absorbents were of poor quality. The canister was made of\r\nbeaded tin plate and was 18 cm. high. The area of the flattened oval\r\nsection was 65 sq. cm. In the bottom was a fine wire dome 3.4 cm. high.\r\nThe valve in the bottom was integral with the bottom of the container,\r\nthere being no removable plug for the insertion of the check valve. The\r\nabsorbents were held in place by a heavy wire screen on top and by two\r\nrectangular springs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56.—American Canister, Type _A_.]\r\n\r\nInhaled air entered through the circular valve at the bottom of the\r\ncanister, passed through the absorbents and through a small nipple at\r\nthe top.\r\n\r\nThe filling consisted of 60 per cent by volume of wood charcoal,\r\ndeveloped by the National Carbon Co., and 40 per cent of green soda\r\nlime, developed and manufactured by the General Chemical Company,\r\nEaston, Pa. The entire volume amounted to 660 cc. The early experiments\r\nwith this volume of absorbent showed that ⅖ soda-lime was the minimum\r\namount that could be used and still furnish adequate protection against\r\nthe then known war gases. It was, therefore, decided to use ⅖ soda-lime\r\nand ⅗ charcoal by volume and this proportion has been adhered to in all\r\nof the later types of canisters. It is interesting to note that these\r\nfigures have been fully substantiated by the later experimental work on\r\ncanister filling.\r\n\r\nThe charcoal and soda-lime were not mixed but arranged in five layers\r\nof equal volume, each layer, therefore, containing 20 per cent of the\r\ntotal volume. The layers were separated by screens of crinoline. At the\r\ntop was inserted a layer of terry cloth, a layer of gray flannel, and\r\ntwo steel wire screens. The cloth kept the fine particles of chemicals\r\nfrom being drawn into the throat of the person wearing the mask.\r\n\r\nThis canister furnished very good protection against chlorine and\r\nhydrocyanic acid and was fairly efficient against phosgene, but it was\r\nuseless against chloropicrin. These canisters were never used at the\r\nfront, but served a very useful purpose as experimental canisters and\r\nin training troops.\r\n\r\nIt was soon found that better protection was obtained if the absorbents\r\nwere mixed before packing in the canister. This procedure also\r\nsimplified the method of packing and was used in canister _B_ and\r\nfollowing types. Among other changes introduced in later types were:\r\nThe integral valve was replaced by a removable check valve plug which\r\nenabled the men in the field to adjust the valve in case it did not\r\nfunction properly. The mixture of charcoal and soda-lime was divided\r\ninto three separate layers and these separated by cotton pads. The pads\r\noffered protection against stannic chloride smokes but not against\r\nsmokes of the type of sneezing gas. The green soda-lime was replaced\r\nby the pink granules. In April, 1918, the mesh of the absorbent was\r\nchanged to 8 to 14 in place of 6 to 14.\r\n\r\nAbout July 1, 1918, the authorities were convinced by the field forces\r\nof the Chemical Warfare Service that the length of life of the chemical\r\nprotection of the standard _H_ canister (the type then in use) was\r\nexcessive and that the resistance was much too high. Type _J_ was\r\ntherefore adopted, July 27, 1918. In this the volume of the absorbent\r\nwas reduced from 450 cc. to 300 cc. It was packed in two layers, ⅔ in\r\nthe bottom and ⅓ in the top. One pad was placed between the layers and\r\none on top. This change gave a lowering of the resistance of 27 per\r\ncent (to 2.5 inches) at a sacrifice of 50 per cent of the length of\r\nlife of the canister, but not of protection during the shortened life.\r\nType _L_ differed from this only in having 325 cc. of absorbent, a\r\nchange made to decrease leakage about the top cotton pad.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57.—U. S. Army Canister, Type _J_.]\r\n\r\nThe following table shows the relative efficiency of various canisters:\r\n\r\n    -----------------+----------+----------+----------+----------+------\r\n                     |          |  U.

Bradley Dewey[26]:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26: _J. Ind. Eng. Chem._, =11=, 185 (1919).]\r\n\r\n“INCOMING INSPECTION—A thorough 100 per cent inspection was made of\r\neach part before sending it to the Assembly Department. The inspectors\r\nwere carefully chosen and were sent to a school for training before\r\nthey were assigned to this important work. Every feature found to\r\nbe essential to the manufacture of a perfect gas mask was carefully\r\nchecked.\r\n\r\n“The incoming inspection of the flexible rubber hose leading from the\r\ncanister to the facepiece can be taken as an illustration. Each piece\r\nof hose was given a visual inspection for buckles or blisters in the\r\nends or in the corrugations; for cuts, air pockets, or other defects\r\non the interior; for loose seams where fabric covering was cemented\r\nto the rubber tube; for weaving defects in the fabric itself; and for\r\ncareless application of the cement. Special tests were conducted for\r\nflexibility, as a stiff hose would produce a strain on the soldier’s\r\nmouth; for permanent set to insure that the hose was properly cured;\r\nfor the adhesion of the fabric covering to the hose; and for kinking\r\nwhen the hose was doubled on the fingers. Finally each piece was\r\nsubjected to a test for leaks under water with a pressure of 5 lbs. per\r\nsq in.\r\n\r\n“Each eyepiece and the three-way metal connection to the facepiece\r\nwere subjected to a vacuum test for leakage. The delicate exhalation\r\nvalve was carefully examined for defects which would be liable to cause\r\nleakage. Fabric for the facepiece was given a high-tension electrical\r\ntest on a special machine developed at the plant to overcome the\r\ndifficulty met in the inspection of this most important material. It\r\nwas of course necessary that the facepiece fabric be free from defects\r\nbut just what constituted a defect was the source of much discussion.\r\nThe electrical test eliminated all personal views and gave an impartial\r\ntest of the fabric. The machine consisted of two steel rolls between\r\nwhich a potential difference of 4,000 volts was maintained; the fabric\r\nwas led through the rolls and wherever there was a pinhole or flaw the\r\ncurrent arced through and burned a clearly visible hole.\r\n\r\n“PRELIMINARY FACEPIECE OPERATIONS—Blanks were died out from the\r\nfacepiece fabric in hydraulic presses. Each face blank was swabbed to\r\nremove bloom and the eye washers were cemented about the eyeholes. The\r\npockets for holding the noseclips were also cemented to the blanks. The\r\nbands which formed a gas-tight seal of the mask about the face were\r\ndied out from rubberized fabric to which a felt backing was attached.\r\nThe harness consisting of elastic and cotton tapes was also sewed\r\ntogether at this point.\r\n\r\n“FACEPIECE OPERATIONS—The sewing machine operations were next\r\nperformed. First the died out blanks were pleated to form the\r\nfacepiece. The operator had to register the various notches in the\r\nblank to an accuracy of ¹/₃₂ in. and to locate the stitches in some\r\ncases as closely as ¹/₆₄ in. The band was next sewed to the periphery\r\nof the facepiece after which the harness was attached. The stitches\r\non the outside of the facepiece were covered with liquid dope, which\r\nfilled the needle holes and made the seams gas-tight.\r\n\r\n“In addition to the inspection of each operation, the completed\r\nfacepiece was submitted to a control inspection to discover any defects\r\nthat might escape the attention of the inspectors on the various\r\noperations.\r\n\r\n“ASSEMBLY OPERATIONS—The facepieces were now ready for assembly and\r\nwere sent for insertion of the eyepieces, which was done in specially\r\ndesigned automatic presses. The eyepieces had to be carefully inserted\r\nso that the facepiece fabric extended evenly around the entire\r\ncircumference.\r\n\r\n“Before manufacture began on a large scale, the most satisfactory\r\nmethod of conducting each assembly operation was worked out and\r\nthe details standardized, so that operators could be quickly and\r\nefficiently trained. No detail was considered too small if it improved\r\nthe quality of the mask. The assembly operations proceeded as follows:\r\n\r\n“The exhalation valve was first joined to the three-way metal tube\r\nwhich formed the connection between the facepiece, flexible hose, and\r\nmouthpiece. Each valve was then tested for leakage under a pressure\r\ndifference of a one inch head of water. No valve was accepted which\r\nshowed leakage in excess of 10 cc. per min. under these conditions.\r\n\r\n“The metal guard to protect the exhalation valve was next assembled,\r\nfollowed by the flexible hose. The three-way tube was then assembled\r\nto the facepiece by means of a threaded connection and the rubber\r\nmouthpiece attached. To illustrate the attention to details the\r\nfollowing operation may be cited:\r\n\r\n    “The contact surfaces between each rubber and metal\r\n    part were coated with rubber cement before the parts\r\n    were assembled. The connection was then tightly wired,\r\n    care being taken that none of the turns of wire should\r\n    cross and finally the wire was covered with adhesive\r\n    tape so that no sharp edges would be exposed.\r\n\r\n    “The masks, completely assembled except for the\r\n    canisters, were inspected and hung on racks on\r\n    specially designed trucks which prevented injury in\r\n    transit, and were delivered to the Finishing Department.\r\n\r\n“CANISTER FILLING—Meanwhile the canisters were being filled, in another\r\nbuilding.\r\n\r\n“The chemicals were first screened in such a way that the fine and\r\ncoarse materials were separated from the correctly sized materials.\r\nThey were then carried on a belt conveyor to the storage bins, whence\r\nthey were fed by gravity through pipes to various mixing machines. A\r\nspecial mixing machine was developed to mix the carbon and granules in\r\nthe proper proportions for use in the canister. The mixed chemicals\r\nwere then led to the canister-filling machines. There was a separate\r\nmixing machine for each filling machine, of which there were eighteen\r\nin all.\r\n\r\n“The can-filling department was laid out in six units. Each unit had a\r\ncapacity of 20,000 cans per day. A system of double belt conveyors was\r\ninstalled to conduct empty canisters to the machines and carry away the\r\nfilled ones.\r\n\r\n“Each filling operation was carefully inspected and special stops were\r\nplaced on the belt conveyors so that a canister could not go to the\r\nnext operation without having been inspected. Operators and inspectors\r\nwere stationed on opposite sides of the belt. The chemicals were placed\r\nin the canister in three equal layers which were separated by pads of\r\ncotton wadding. The first layer was introduced from the filling machine\r\n(which delivered automatically the proper volume of chemicals), the\r\ncanister was shaken to pack the chemicals tightly, the cotton baffle\r\ninserted, the second layer of chemicals introduced and so forth. On top\r\nof the top layer of chemicals were placed a wire screen and a specially\r\ndesigned spring which held the contents of the canister securely in\r\nplace. The metal top was then fitted and securely soldered.\r\n\r\n“Each canister was tested under water for possible leaks in joints or\r\nsoldering, with an air pressure of 5 lbs. per sq. in. A test was also\r\nmade for the resistance which it offered to breathing, a rate of flow\r\nof air through the canister of 85 liters per min. being maintained and\r\nthe resistance being measured in inches of water.\r\n\r\n“The filled canisters were then painted a distinctive color to indicate\r\nthe type of filling.\r\n\r\n“FINISHING DEPARTMENT—In the finishing department, the filled\r\ncanisters, were conducted down the middle of the finishing tables and\r\nassembled to masks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59.]\r\n\r\n“The finished masks were then inspected, placed in unit boxes, ten to a\r\nbox, and returned for the final inspection.\r\n\r\n“FINAL INSPECTION—Final inspection of the completely assembled masks\r\nwas as rigid as could be devised, and was closely supervised by army\r\nrepresentatives. Only the most painstaking, and careful women were\r\nselected for this work and the masks were examined in every detail\r\nto discover any defect that might have escaped previous inspection.\r\nFinally, each mask was inspected over a bright light in a dark booth\r\nfor small pinholes which the ordinary visual inspection might not have\r\ndetected.\r\n\r\n“As a check on the quality on the final inspectors’ work a reinspection\r\nof 5 per cent of the passed masks was conducted. Where it was found\r\nthat a particular inspector was making numerous mistakes, her eyes were\r\nexamined to see whether it was due to faulty eyesight or careless work.\r\nMasks containing known defects were purposely sent to these inspectors\r\nto determine whether they were capable of continuing the inspection\r\nwork. In this way the desired standard was maintained.\r\n\r\n“A daily report of the final inspection was sent back to each of the\r\nassembly departments involved so that defects might be eliminated\r\nimmediately and the percentage of rejects kept as low as possible.\r\n\r\n“After the final inspection the masks were numbered, packed in\r\nknapsacks, and the filled knapsacks placed in packing cases,\r\ntwenty-four to a case.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTISSOT MASK\r\n\r\nThe French, as has already been pointed out, early recognized that\r\ncertain classes of fighting men, as the artillerymen, needed the\r\nmaximum of protection with the minimum decrease in efficiency. The\r\nresult of this was the Tissot Mask. Before the United States entered\r\nthe war, the British standard box respirator had reached a greater\r\ndegree of perfection, with far greater ruggedness and portability. It\r\nwas therefore adopted as the American standard. At the time of the\r\ninvention of the British box respirator and practically up to the time\r\nthe United States entered the war, masks were worn only during the\r\nsporadic gas attacks then occurring and only for a brief period at a\r\ntime. As the war progressed, the men were compelled to wear their masks\r\nfor much longer periods (eight hours was not uncommon). It was then\r\nseen that more comfort was needed, even at the expense of a little\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\nThe principle of the Tissot mask was correct so far as comfort was\r\nconcerned, since it did away with the irritating mouthpiece and\r\nnoseclip, but the chief danger in the French mask arose from the fact\r\nthat the facepiece was made of thin, pure gum rubber. The Research\r\nDivision, together with the Gas Defense Division, developed two\r\ndistinct types of Tissot masks. The first of these was the Akron\r\nTissot, the second the Kops Tissot. The best features of these have\r\nbeen combined in the 1919 Model.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60.—American Tissot Mask, Early Type.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61.—American Tissot Mask, Interior View.]\r\n\r\n\r\n1919 MODEL AMERICAN MASK\r\n\r\n=Facepiece.= This facepiece is made of rubberized stockinet about\r\none-tenth inch in thickness. The stockinet is on the outside only and\r\nis for the purpose of strengthening and protecting the rubber which is\r\nof very high grade. The facepiece is died out as a single flat piece\r\nfrom the stockinet which is furnished in long rolls. The die is of such\r\nshape that when the facepiece is sewed there is but one seam, and that\r\nbetween the angle tube opening and the edge under the chin. This seam\r\nis sewed with a zigzag stitch with the stockinet sides flat together.\r\nThe seam is then stretched over a jig, so as to form a flat butt joint.\r\nThis seam is then cemented with rubber cement and taped, inside and\r\nout, to make it thoroughly gas-proof.\r\n\r\nThe eyepiece openings are of oval shape with the longer axes horizontal\r\nand considerably smaller than the finished eyepieces. The eyepieces\r\nbeing circular, the cloth is stretched to accommodate them, giving the\r\nnecessary bulge to keep the cloth and metal of the eyepieces away from\r\nthe face. The harness has three straps on each side. Instead of the\r\nsingle strap over the top of the head, two straps lead from directly\r\nover the eyes, both being made of elastic the same as the other straps.\r\nAll six straps are brought together around a pad of felt and cloth\r\nabout 2½ × 3½ inches at the back of the head. This pad makes the\r\nharness much more comfortable.\r\n\r\nThe rubberized stockinet is reinforced on the inner or rubber side with\r\nthin bits of cloth at all points where the straps are sewed on. The\r\nstrap across the temples just above the ears is sewed at two points,\r\none about one-half inch from the edge and the other about two inches\r\nfrom the edge. This is for the purpose of helping press the cloth\r\nagainst the temples, thereby adding to the gas-tightness for those\r\nheads that have a tendency to be hollow at the temples. The lower strap\r\nis just above the chin and is for the purpose of giving gas-tightness\r\nin that vicinity. All of the straps except the two over the top of the\r\nhead are attached to the pad with buckles, and are thus capable of\r\nexact adjustment.\r\n\r\nThe eyepieces are of triplex glass in metal rings with rubber gaskets.\r\nIn pressing the rings home, the rubberized stockinet is turned and held\r\nsecurely so that there is no possibility of pulling them out. The angle\r\ntube containing the outlet valve and the connection to the corrugated\r\ntube connecting with the canister is the same as with the latest model\r\nR. F. K. mask. The only difference as regards the corrugated tube is\r\nthat a greater length is needed with the new carrier under the left\r\nshoulder. The total length of the tube for this model is about 24\r\ninches. On the inside of the facepiece and connected to the angle tube\r\ninlet is a butterfly baffle of rubber, so arranged that the incoming\r\nair is thrown upward and over the eyepieces, thus keeping them clear no\r\nmatter how much the exertion or what the temperature, except in certain\r\nrare cases when the temperature is down at zero F. or below.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62.—1919 Model American Mask.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCANISTER\r\n\r\nThe canister is radically different from the canisters used in the\r\nR. F. K. and earlier types. In the first place, it is longer, the\r\ntotal length finished being 8 inches. It has two inlet valves at the\r\ntop end protected by a tin cover instead of the single inlet valve\r\nat the bottom of the earlier types. The two inlet valves are each ⅝\r\ninch in diameter and are made up of square flat valves on the end of a\r\nshort rubber tube. The rubber tube is fitted over a short metal tube.\r\nGas-tightness is obtained both by the pressing of the valve against\r\nthe round edge of the metal tube and by the pressure of the edges\r\nagainst each other. These valves, while delicate, are proving very\r\nsatisfactory, and being simply check valves to prevent the air going\r\nback through the canister, they are not vital. In case of failure, the\r\neyepieces would fog somewhat and the dead air space be increased by\r\nthat held in the inlet tube.\r\n\r\nThe canister consists really of two parts—an outer casing that is\r\nsolid and an inner perforated tin casing. Around the perforated tin is\r\nfitted a filter of wool felt ³/₁₆ of an inch in thickness. This wool\r\nfelt is very securely fastened by turning operations to solid pieces\r\nof tin, top and bottom, so that no air can get into the chemicals\r\nwithout passing through the filter. Thus the air coming through the\r\ninlet valves at the top circulates around the loosely fitting outside\r\ncorrugated case to all parts of the filter and after passing through\r\nthe filter continues through the perforations of the tin into the\r\ncharcoal and soda-lime granules.\r\n\r\nThe chemicals are packed around a central wedge-shaped tube extending\r\nabout two-thirds the length of the can. The wedge is enlarged at the\r\ntop and made circular where it passes through the top of the can to\r\nconnect with the corrugated tube. The wedge-shaped inner piece is made\r\nof perforated tin and is covered with thin cloth to prevent dust from\r\nthe chemicals passing into the tube and thus into the lungs. The cans\r\nare filled from the bottom and are subjected to two mechanical jarring\r\noperations in order to settle the chemicals thoroughly before the\r\nspring which holds them in place is added. The outer tin cap protecting\r\nthe inlet valves has two openings on each side but none at the ends of\r\nthe canister.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63.—1919 Model American Mask after Adjustment.]\r\n\r\nThe carrier is a simple canvas case nearly rectangular, about one foot\r\nwide and 15 inches in length. The width is just sufficient at the back\r\nto hold the canister and the front part to hold the extra length of\r\ncorrugated tube and the facepiece. There are two straps, one passing\r\nover the right shoulder and the other around the body. The one passing\r\nover the right shoulder has two “V” shaped seams at the top so as to\r\nchange the direction of the strap over the shoulder in order that it\r\nwill pull directly downward instead of against the neck. The flap\r\nclosing the case opens outward.\r\n\r\nIt has the usual automobile curtain fasteners. A secondary fastener at\r\nthe top of the opening is arranged so that when the tube is adjusted to\r\nthe proper length and the mask is adjusted to the face of the wearer,\r\nthe flap can be buttoned tightly over the corrugated tube and held\r\ntightly. This prevents water from entering the case.\r\n\r\nFigures 62 and 63 show the position of the carrier both with the\r\nfacepiece in the carrier and after adjustment. It will be noted that\r\nthe carrier does not interfere with the pack nor with anything on the\r\nfront of the body. The left arm hangs almost entirely natural over\r\nthe case. It has been thoroughly tried out by the Infantry, Cavalry,\r\nArtillery and Special Gas Troops and adopted as eminently satisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\nSPECIAL CANISTERS\r\n\r\n=Navy.= The early Navy canister is a drum much like the German\r\ncanister. The container is a slightly tapered metal cylinder, 9 cm.\r\nin diameter at the bottom. The most satisfactory filling for this\r\ndrum consists of two layers, 98 cc. in each, of a standard mixture of\r\ncharcoal and soda-lime, separated by cotton wadding pad. The filling is\r\n6-20 mesh, instead of 8-14 mesh. A later type is shown in Figure 41.\r\n\r\n=Carbon Monoxide.= This canister is discussed in Chapter XI.\r\n\r\n=Ammonia.= Ammonia respirators were needed by the Navy and also by\r\nthe workmen in refrigeration plants. Early protection was obtained by\r\nthe use of pumice stone impregnated with sulfuric acid. This had many\r\ndisadvantages, such as the amount of heat evolved, the caustic fumes\r\nproduced, high resistance and corrosion of the canister. To overcome\r\nthese, the “Kupramite” canister was developed. The filling consists of\r\npumice stone impregnated with copper sulfate. Pumice stone, 8 to 14\r\nmesh, and technical copper sulfate are placed in an evaporating pan\r\nin the ratio of one part by weight CuSO₄·5H₂O to 1.5 parts pumice,\r\nand the whole is covered with sufficient water to dissolve the salt\r\nat boiling temperature. The mixture is then boiled down with constant\r\nstirring until crystallization takes place on the pumice and the\r\ncrystals are nearly dry. The pumice thus treated is then removed from\r\nthe dish, spread out and allowed to dry in the air. The fines are then\r\nscreened out on a 14-mesh sieve. Care must be taken in the evaporating\r\nprocess that the absorbent is still slightly moist when taken from the\r\npan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64.—Early Type Navy Mask. Contains noseclip and\r\nmouthpiece.]\r\n\r\nIn packing the standard Army canister with kupramite a layer of\r\ntoweling is placed on top of the absorbent to filter out any fine\r\nparticles which might be drawn up from the absorbent, and the whole is\r\nheld in place by the usual heavy wire screen and spring. This method of\r\npacking is to be used with the present mouthpiece type of army mask.\r\nIf the new Tissot type mask is used, a modification of the packing is\r\ndesirable in order to eliminate the trouble due to moisture given off\r\nby the absorbent during service condensing on the eyepieces of the mask\r\nand thus impairing the vision of the wearer. To remedy this defect a\r\n1-in. layer of kupramite at the top of the canister is replaced by\r\nactivated charcoal or silica gel, preferably silica gel. This decreases\r\nthe humidity of the effluent air sufficiently to prevent dimming of the\r\neyepieces. If charcoal is used, a 2-8 cotton pad (Eastern Star Furrier\r\nCo., Pawtucket, R. I.) is substituted for the toweling in order to\r\nremove charcoal dust. The canister complete weighs about 1.7 lbs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65.—Ammonia Canister—“Kupramite.”]\r\n\r\nA canister containing 45 cu. in. of this material will protect a man\r\nbreathing at rest for at least 5 hours against 2 per cent ammonia and\r\nfor 2½ hours against 5 per cent ammonia. Its advantages are large\r\ncapacity and activity, negligible heat of absorption, and cheapness.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSIOLOGICAL FEATURES OF THE MASK\r\n\r\nFor some time after the introduction of gas warfare, the gases used\r\nwere of the so-called non-persistent type. Under these conditions it\r\nwas necessary to wear the mask for only relatively short periods,\r\nafter which the cloud dissipated. With the increasing use of gas and\r\nthe introduction of the more persistent gases, particularly mustard\r\ngas, it not only became necessary to wear the mask for long periods of\r\ntime but also to do relatively heavy physical work, such as serving\r\nartillery, when wearing the mask.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66.—Ammonia Mask, Showing Relative Size of\r\nCanister.]\r\n\r\nUnder these conditions, it became evident that the wearing of the\r\nmask caused a very great reduction in the military efficiency of\r\nthe soldier. The reasons for this reduction in efficiency have been\r\nmade the subject of extensive research by a group of the foremost\r\nphysiologists and psychologists of the country. As a result of their\r\nwork, the causes contributing to this reduction in efficiency may be\r\ngrouped about the following main factors:\r\n\r\n(1) The physical discomfort of the mask arising from causes such as\r\npressure on the head and face, due to improperly fitting facepieces and\r\nharness, the noseclip, and the mouthpiece.\r\n\r\n(2) Abnormal conditions of vision, due to poor optical qualities in eye\r\npieces and restrictions of vision, both as to total field and binocular\r\nfield.\r\n\r\n(3) Abnormal conditions of respiration, among them being (_a_) the\r\nunnatural channels of respiration caused by wearing the box respirator,\r\n(_b_) increase in dead air space in respiratory circuit, and (_c_) the\r\nincrease in resistance to both inhalation and exhalation, the last two\r\nmentioned being present to a greater or less degree in all types of\r\nmask.\r\n\r\nOf these general subdivisions the various phases of the first two are\r\nso evident that no further discussion will be given. The effects of\r\nthe changed conditions of respiration are, however, less obvious, and\r\nit may be of interest to present in a general way the results of the\r\nresearch along this line, particularly as regards the harmful effects\r\nof increasing the resistance and dead air space in the respiratory\r\ntract above the normal.\r\n\r\nThe function of respiration is to supply oxygen to and remove carbon\r\ndioxide from the blood as it passes through the lungs. This interchange\r\nof gases takes place in the alveoli, a myriad of thin-walled air sacs\r\nat the end of the respiratory tract where the air is separated by a\r\nvery thin membrane through which the gases readily pass. The volume\r\nand rate, or in other words, the minute-volume, of respiration is\r\nautomatically controlled by the nerve centers in such a way that a\r\nsufficient amount of air is supplied to the lungs to maintain by means\r\nof this interchange a uniform percentage of its various constituents\r\nas it leaves the lungs. It will be readily seen therefore, that\r\nanything which causes a change in the composition of the air presented\r\nto the blood in the alveoli will bring about abnormal conditions of\r\nrespiration.\r\n\r\nInasmuch as the gaseous interchange between the lungs and the blood\r\ntakes place only in the terminal air sacs it follows that, at the end\r\nof each respiration, the rest of the respiratory tract is filled with\r\nair low in oxygen and high in carbon dioxide, which on inspiration\r\nis drawn back into the lungs, diluting the fresh air. The volume of\r\nthese passages holding air which must be re-breathed is known as the\r\nanatomical dead air space.\r\n\r\nSimilarly, when a mask is worn the facepiece chamber and any other\r\nparts of the air passage common to inspiration and expiration become\r\nadditional dead air space contributing a further dilution of oxygen\r\ncontent and contamination by carbon dioxide of the inspired air in\r\naddition to that occasioned by the anatomical dead space, which of\r\ncourse, is always present and is taken care of by the functions\r\nnormally controlling respiration.\r\n\r\nMajor R. G. Pearce who directed a large amount of the research along\r\nthis line, sums up the harmful effects of thus increasing the dead air\r\nspace as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Interpretation from the physiological standpoint:\r\n\r\n(_a_) A larger minute-volume of air is required when breathing through\r\ndead air space. This, interpreted on physiological grounds, means that\r\nthe carbon dioxide content of the arterial blood is higher than normal.\r\nThe level to which the content of carbon dioxide in the arterial blood\r\nmay rise is limited. Anything which wastefully increases the carbon\r\ndioxide level of the blood decreases the reserve so necessary to a\r\nsoldier when he is asked to respond to the demand for exercise which is\r\na part of his daily life.\r\n\r\n(_b_) A larger minute-volume of air must be pulled through the\r\ncanister, which offers resistance proportional to the volume of air\r\npassing through it. If resistance is a factor of harm, dead air space\r\nincreases that harm, since dead air space increases the volume of air\r\npassing through the canister.\r\n\r\n(_c_) As will be noted below, the effect of resistance is a tendency to\r\ndecrease the minute-volume of air breathed. Dead air space increases\r\nthe minute-volume. Accordingly, if breathing is accomplished against\r\nresistance and through a large volume of dead air space, the volume\r\nof air breathed is reduced more in proportion to the actual needs of\r\nthe body than when breathing against resistance without the additional\r\nfactor of dead space; this, again, causes the level of carbon dioxide\r\nin the blood and tissues to be raised to a higher level than normal,\r\nand thus again there is some reserve power wasted.\r\n\r\n2. Interpretation from the standpoint of the canister.\r\n\r\nThe life of the canister depends on the volume of the gas-laden air\r\npassed through it. The dead space increases the minute-volume of air\r\npassed through the canister and, therefore, shortens its life.\r\n\r\nPhysiologically, the reason for the harmful effects of breathing\r\nresistance is more involved:\r\n\r\n    “The importance of resistance to breathing lies in: (1)\r\n    the effect on the circulation of the blood, and (2) the\r\n    changes in the lung tissue, which seriously interfere\r\n    with the gas exchange between the outside air and the\r\n    blood. Data have been presented to draw attention to\r\n    the seriousness of resistance to inspiration. In these\r\n    reports, it was suggested that the deleterious effects\r\n    on the body consist in changes in the blood pressure,\r\n    increased work of the right side of the heart, and an\r\n    increase in the blood and lymph content of the lungs.\r\n    Resistance also decreases the minute-volume of air\r\n    breathed and thereby increases the percentage of carbon\r\n    dioxide in the expired air. The foregoing changes are\r\n    all deleterious.\r\n\r\n    “Although the chief problem of resistance in gas mask\r\n    design concerns inspiration, nevertheless _resistance\r\n    to expiration_ is an important factor. The expired\r\n    air of the lungs contains carbon dioxide for which\r\n    means of escape must be provided. The expiratory act is\r\n    more passive than the inspiratory act, and resistance\r\n    to expiration is, therefore, more keenly felt than\r\n    resistance to inspiration. It is then imperative that\r\n    the exhale valve be so arranged as to allow for the\r\n    escape of the entire amount of air during the time of\r\n    expiration with the least possible resistance. The data\r\n    of the laboratory indicate that seldom, if ever, do\r\n    expiratory rates rise above a velocity of 150 to 175\r\n    per minute. The effect of resistance to exhalation upon\r\n    the vital organs of the body is not dissimilar to that\r\n    of inspiration.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nABSORBENTS[27]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe absorbents used in both the British and American gas mask canister,\r\nwhich afforded a degree of protection far superior to that of any\r\nother allied or enemy nation except Germany, consisted of a mixture\r\nof charcoal and soda-lime, as described in the preceding chapter. In\r\ngeneral, a gas mask absorbent must have certain requirements. These\r\nare: absorptive activity, absorptive capacity, versatility, mechanical\r\nstrength, chemical stability, low breathing resistance, ease of\r\nmanufacture and availability of raw materials.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27: The basis of this chapter is the series of articles by\r\nLamb and co-workers which appeared in the _J. Ind. Eng. Chem._ for\r\n1919.]\r\n\r\n_Absorptive activity_, or a very high rate of absorption, is one of\r\nthe more important properties of a satisfactory absorbent. A normal\r\nman when exercising violently breathes about 60 liters of air per\r\nminute, and since inhalation occupies but slightly more than half of\r\nthe breathing cycle, the actual rate at which gas passes through the\r\ncanister during inhalation is about 100 liters per minute. Calculated\r\non the basis of the regular army canister, this corresponds to an\r\naverage linear air velocity of about 80 cm. per second. On the average,\r\ntherefore, a given small portion of the air remains in contact with\r\nthe gas absorbent for only about 0.1 second. Besides this, the removal\r\nof the toxic material must be surprisingly complete. Though the\r\nconcentration entering the canister may occasionally be as high as one\r\nhalf per cent, even the momentary leakage of 0.001 per cent (ten parts\r\nper million) would cause serious discomfort and the prolonged leakage\r\nof smaller amounts would have serious results in the case of some\r\ngases. The activity of the present gas mask charcoal is shown by the\r\nfact that it will reduce a concentration of 7000 parts per million of\r\nchloropicrin to less than 0.5 part per million in less than 0.03 second.\r\n\r\nOf equal importance is the _absorptive capacity_. That is, the\r\nabsorbent must be able to absorb and hold large amounts of gas per\r\nunit weight of absorbent. Its life must be measured in days against\r\nordinary concentrations of gas. It is further necessary that the gas\r\nbe held firmly and not in any loose combination which might give up\r\nminute traces of gas when air is, for long periods of time, breathed in\r\nthrough a canister which has previously been exposed to gas.\r\n\r\nThe absorbents used must be of a type which can be relied upon to\r\ngive adequate protection against practically any kind of toxic gas\r\n(_versatility_). The need of this is apparent when the difficulty of\r\nhaving separate canisters for various gases is considered, as well\r\nas the difficulty in rapidly and accurately identifying the gases\r\nand the possible introduction of new and unknown gases. Fortunately,\r\npractically all of the toxic gases are very reactive chemically or have\r\nrelatively high boiling points and can therefore be absorbed in large\r\namounts by charcoal.\r\n\r\nAbsorbents must be _mechanically strong_ in order to retain their\r\nstructure and porosity under conditions of transport and field use.\r\nFurther, they must not be subject to abrasion for the production of a\r\nrelatively small amount of fines would tend to plug the canister or to\r\ncause channels through which the gas would pass without being absorbed.\r\n\r\nSince the canister is filled several months before it is first used\r\nin the trenches, and since the canister may be used over a period of\r\nmonths before it is discarded, it is obviously the ultimate activity\r\nand capacity (not the initial efficiency) which determines the value\r\nof an absorbent. It must therefore have a very considerable degree of\r\n_chemical stability_. By this is meant that the absorbent itself is\r\nnot subject to chemical deterioration, that it does not react with\r\ncarbon dioxide, that it does not disintegrate or become deliquescent\r\neven after being used and that it has no corrosive action on the metal\r\ncontainer.\r\n\r\nIn a good general absorbent there must be a proper balance between its\r\nvarious essential qualities, and hence the most suitable mixture will\r\nprobably always be a compromise.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARCOAL\r\n\r\nThe fact that charcoal would condense in its pores or adsorb certain\r\ngases, holding them firmly, had been known for a long time.[28] In\r\ngeneral, it was known that so-called animal charcoal was the best\r\nfor decolorizing sugar solutions, that wood charcoal was the best\r\nfor adsorbing gases and that coke had very little adsorbing or\r\ndecolorizing power. No one knew the reason for these facts and no one\r\ncould write a specification for charcoal. The ordinary charcoal used\r\nin the scientific laboratory was cocoanut charcoal, since Hunter had\r\ndiscovered more than fifty years ago that this was the best charcoal\r\nfor adsorbing gases.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAW MATERIALS[29]\r\n\r\nThe first charcoal designed to offer protection against chlorine and\r\nphosgene was made by carbonizing red cedar. Since this had little value\r\nagainst chloropicrin, attention was turned to cocoanut shell as the\r\nsource of raw material. This charcoal fulfilled the above conditions\r\nfor a satisfactory absorbent better than any other form tested. It must\r\nnot be supposed, however, that investigation of carbon stopped with\r\nthese experiments. In the search for the ideal carbon, practically\r\nalmost every hard vegetable substance known was tested. Next to\r\ncocoanut shells, the fruit pits, several common varieties of nuts\r\nabundant in the United States, and several tropical nuts (especially\r\ncohune nuts), were found to make the best carbon. Pecan nuts, and all\r\nwoods ranging in hardness from iron wood down to ordinary pine and\r\nfir, were found to be in the second class of efficiency. Among other\r\nsubstances tested were almonds, Arabian acorns, grape seeds, Brazil\r\nnut husks, balsa, osage orange, Chinese velvet bean, synthetic carbons\r\n(from coal, lamp-black, etc.), cocoa bean shell, coffee grounds, flint\r\ncorn, corn cobs, cotton seed husks, peanut shells and oil shale. While\r\nmany of these substances might have been used in an emergency, none of\r\nthem would produce carbon as efficient, volume for volume, as that of\r\nthe cocoanut shell and other hard nuts.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: Bancroft (_J. Phys. Chem._ =24=, 127, 201, 342 [1920])\r\ngives a comprehensive review of “Charcoal before the War.”]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 29: Part of this section is quoted from “Armies of Industry,”\r\nby Crowell and Wilson, Yale Univ. Press.]\r\n\r\nSome idea of the scale of charcoal production may be seen from the\r\nrequirement for cocoanut shells. When we first began to build masks our\r\ndemands for carboniferous materials ranged from 40 to 50 tons a day\r\nof raw material; by the end of the war, we were in need of a supply\r\nof 400 tons of cocoanut shells per day. This demand would absorb the\r\nentire cocoanut production of tropical America five times over. (The\r\ntotal production of cocoanuts in Central America, the West Indies and\r\nthe Caribbean Coast of South America amounted to 131,000,000 nuts\r\nannually, equal to a supply of 75 tons of shells daily.) It was equal\r\nto one-tenth of the total production of the Orient, which amounted to\r\n7,450,200,000 nuts annually. This large demand always made a reserve\r\nsupply of charcoal material practically impossible. The “Eat More\r\nCocoanut” campaign started by the Gas Defense more than doubled the\r\nAmerican consumption of cocoanut in a brief space of time and in\r\nOctober, 1918, with the help of importation of shell, we averaged about\r\n150 tons of shells per day, exclusive of the Orient.\r\n\r\nThe first heating of cocoanut shells to make charcoal reduces\r\ntheir weight 75 per cent. It was evident, therefore, that we could\r\nmore economically ship our oriental supply in the form of charcoal\r\nproduced on the other side of the Pacific Ocean. A charcoal plant was\r\nestablished in the Philippine Islands and agents were sent to all parts\r\nof the Oriental countries to purchase enormous supplies of shells.\r\nWhile the work was only gaining momentum when the Armistice was signed,\r\nthe plant actually shipped 300 tons of cocoanut shell carbon to the\r\nUnited States and had over 1000 tons on hand November 11, 1918.\r\n\r\nIn the search for other tropical nuts, it was found that the cohune\r\nor corozo nut was the best. These nuts are the fruit of the manaca\r\npalm tree. They grow in clusters, like bananas or dates, one to four\r\nclusters to a tree, each cluster yielding from 60 to 75 pounds of\r\nnuts. They grow principally on the west coast of Central America in\r\nlow, swampy regions from Mexico to Panama but are also found along the\r\nCaribbean coast. The chief virtue of the cohune nut from the charcoal\r\npoint of view was its extreme thickness of shell; this nut is 3 inches\r\nor more in length and nearly 2 inches in diameter but the kernel is\r\nvery small. Four thousand tons per month were being imported at the\r\ntime of the Armistice. A disadvantage in the use of cohune nuts was\r\nthat their husks contained a considerable amount of acid which rotted\r\nthe jute bags and also caused the heaps of nuts to heat in storage.\r\n\r\nA third source of tropical material was in the ivory nuts used in\r\nconsiderable quantities in this country by the makers of buttons.\r\nThere is a waste of 400-500 tons per month of this material, which was\r\nused after screening out the dust. This material is rather expensive,\r\nbecause it is normally used in the manufacture of lactic acid.\r\n\r\nAnother great branch of activity in securing carbon supplies was\r\nconcerned with the apricot, peach and cherry pits and walnut shells of\r\nthe Pacific Coast. A nation-wide campaign on the part of the American\r\nRed Cross was started on September 13, 1918. Between this time and the\r\nArmistice some 4,000 tons of material were collected. Thus the slogan\r\n“Help us to give him the best gas mask” made its appeal to every person\r\nin the United States.\r\n\r\n\r\nA THEORY OF CHARCOAL ACTION\r\n\r\nIt has been pointed out that the first charcoal was made from red\r\ncedar. While this was very satisfactory when tested against chlorine,\r\nit was of no value against chloropicrin. In order to improve the\r\ncharcoal still further it was desirable to have some theory as to\r\nthe way charcoal acted. It was generally agreed that fine pores were\r\nessential. The functioning of charcoal depends upon its adsorptive\r\npower and this in turn upon its porosity. The greater the ratio of\r\nits surface to its mass, that is, the more highly developed and\r\nfine grained its porosity, the greater its value. Another factor,\r\nhowever, seemed to play a rôle. As a pure hypothesis, at first, Chaney\r\nassumed that an active charcoal could only be secured by removing the\r\nhydrocarbon which he assumed to be present after carbonization. Being\r\ndifficultly volatile, these hydrocarbons prevent the adsorption of\r\nother gases or vapors on the active material. To prove this, red cedar\r\ncharcoal was heated in a bomb connected with a pump which drew air\r\nthrough the bomb. Although the charcoal had been carbonized at 800°,\r\nvarious gases and vapor began to come off at 300°, and when cooled,\r\ncondensed to crystalline plates.\r\n\r\nThis experiment not only proved the existence of components containing\r\nhydrogen in the charcoal, but also showed that one way of removing the\r\nhydrocarbon film on the active carbon was to treat with an oxidizing\r\nagent.\r\n\r\nIn the light of the later experimental work Chaney feels that there are\r\ntwo forms of elementary carbon—“active” and “inactive”; the active form\r\nis characterized by a high specific adsorptive capacity for gas while\r\nthe inactive form lacks this property. In general the temperature of\r\nformation of the active form is below 500-600° C. The form is easily\r\nattacked by oxidizing agents—while the latter is relatively stable.\r\nThe combination of active carbon with an adsorbed layer or layers of\r\nhydrocarbon is known as “primary” carbon. Anthracite and bituminous\r\ncoal are native primary carbons, while coke contains a considerable\r\namount of inactive carbon, resulting from the decomposition of\r\nhydrocarbon during its preparation.\r\n\r\n\r\nPREPARATION OF ACTIVE CHARCOAL\r\n\r\n“On the basis of the above discussion, the preparation of active\r\ncharcoal will evidently involve two steps:\r\n\r\n“First.—The formation of a porous, amorphous base carbon at a\r\nrelatively low temperature.\r\n\r\n“Second.—The removal of the adsorbed hydrocarbons from the primary\r\ncarbon, and the increase of its porosity.\r\n\r\n“The first step presents no very serious difficulties. It involves,\r\nin the case of woods and similar materials, a process of destructive\r\ndistillation at relatively low temperatures. The deposition of\r\ninactive carbon, resulting from the cracking of hydrocarbons at high\r\ntemperatures, must be avoided. The material is therefore charged into\r\nthe retorts in thin layers, so that the contact of the hydrocarbon\r\nvapors with hot charcoal is avoided as much as possible. Furthermore,\r\nmost of the hydrocarbon is removed before dangerous temperatures are\r\nreached. A slight suction is maintained to prevent outward leaks,\r\nbut no activation by oxidation is attempted, as this can be carried\r\non under better control and with less loss of material in a separate\r\ntreatment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67. Dorsey Reactor for Activating Cocoanut Charcoal\r\nwith Steam.]\r\n\r\n“The second step, that is, the removal of the absorbed hydrocarbons\r\nfrom the primary carbon, is a much more difficult matter. Prolonged\r\nheating, at sufficiently high temperatures, is required to remove or\r\nbreak up the hydrocarbon residues. On the other hand, volatilization\r\nand cracking of the hydrocarbons at high temperatures is certain to\r\nproduce an inactive form of carbon more or less like graphite in its\r\nvisible characteristics, which is not only inert and non-adsorbent,\r\nbut is also highly resistant to oxidation. The general method of\r\nprocedure which has yielded the best results, is to remove the\r\nadsorbed hydrocarbons by various processes of combined oxidation\r\nand distillation, whereby the hydrocarbons of high boiling points\r\nare broken down into more volatile substances and removed at lower\r\ntemperatures, or under conditions less likely to result in subsequent\r\ndeposition of inactive carbon. Thin layers of charcoal and rapid gas\r\ncurrents are used so that contact between the volatilized hydrocarbons\r\nand the hot active charcoal may be as brief as possible. In this way\r\ncracking of the hydrocarbons at high temperature, with consequent\r\ndeposition of inactive carbon, is largely avoided.\r\n\r\n“While the removal of the hydrocarbons by oxidation and distillation\r\nis the main object of the activation process, another important\r\naction goes on at the same time, namely, the oxidation of the primary\r\ncarbon itself. This oxidation is doubtless advantageous, up to a\r\ncertain point, for it probably at first enlarges, at the expense of\r\nthe walls of solid carbon, cavities already present in the charcoal,\r\nthus increasing the total surface exposed. Moreover, the outer ends\r\nof the capillary pores and fissures must be somewhat enlarged by this\r\naction and a readier access thus provided to the inner portions of the\r\ncharcoal. However, as soon as the eating away of the carbon wall begins\r\nto unite cavities, it decreases, rather than increases, the surface of\r\nthe charcoal, and a consequent drop in volume activity, that is in the\r\nservice time, of the charcoal, is found to result.\r\n\r\n“It is obvious, therefore, that conditions of activation must be so\r\nchosen and regulated as to oxidize the hydrocarbons rapidly and the\r\nprimary carbon slowly. Such a differential oxidation is not easy\r\nto secure since the hydrocarbons involved have a very low hydrogen\r\ncontent, and are not much more easily oxidized than the primary\r\ncarbon itself. Furthermore, most of the hydrocarbons to be removed\r\nare shut up in the interior of the granule. On the one hand, a high\r\nenough temperature must be maintained to oxidize the hydrocarbons\r\nwith reasonable speed; on the other hand, too high a temperature must\r\nnot be employed, else the primary carbon will be unduly consumed. The\r\npermissible range is a relatively narrow one, only about 50 to 75°.\r\nThe location of the optimum activating temperature depends upon the\r\noxidizing agent employed and upon other variables as well; for air, it\r\nhas been found to lie somewhere between 350 and 450°, and for steam\r\nbetween 800 and 1000°.\r\n\r\n“The air activation process has the advantage of operating at a\r\nconveniently low temperature. It has the disadvantage, that local\r\nheating and an excessive consumption of primary carbon occur, so that a\r\ndrop in volume activity results from that cause before the hydrocarbons\r\nhave been completely eliminated. As a consequence, charcoal of the\r\nhighest activity cannot be obtained by the air activation process.”\r\n\r\nThe steam activation process has the disadvantage that it operates\r\nat so high a temperature that the regulation of temperature becomes\r\ndifficult and other technical difficulties are introduced. It has the\r\nadvantage that local heating is eliminated. The hydrocarbons can,\r\ntherefore, be largely removed without a disproportionate consumption of\r\nprimary carbon. This permits the production of a very active charcoal.\r\n\r\nIt has the further advantage that it worked well with all kinds of\r\ncharcoal. Inferior material, when treated with steam, gave charcoal\r\nnearly as good as the best steam-treated cocoanut charcoal. Because of\r\nthe shortage of cocoanut, this was a very important consideration.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68.—Section of Raw Cocoanut Shell. Magnified 146½\r\ndiameters.]\r\n\r\nThe air, steam and also carbon dioxide-steam activation processes have\r\nall been employed on a large scale by the Chemical Warfare Service for\r\nthe manufacture of gas mask carbon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69.—Section of Carbonized Cocoanut Charcoal.\r\nMagnified 146½ Diameters.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70.—Two-Minute Charcoal not Activated. Magnified\r\n732 Diameters.]\r\n\r\n    “The above considerations are illustrated fairly well\r\n    by the photo-micrographs shown in Figs. 68 to 71. Fig.\r\n    68 shows a section of the original untreated cocoanut\r\n    shell crosswise to the long axis of the shell. In it\r\n    can be seen the closely packed, thick-walled so-called\r\n    ‘stone-cells’ characteristic of all hard and dense nut\r\n    shells. Fig. 69 is a photograph of a similar section\r\n    through the same cocoanut shell after it has been\r\n    carbonized. As these photographs are all taken with\r\n    vertical illumination against a dark background, the\r\n    cavities, or voids, and depressions all appear black,\r\n    while the charcoal itself appears white. It is clear\r\n    from this photograph that much of the original grosser\r\n    structure of the shell persists in the carbonized\r\n    products. Figs. 70 and 71 are more highly magnified\r\n    photographs of a carbonized charcoal before and after\r\n    activation, respectively. As before, all the dark\r\n    areas represent voids of little or no importance in\r\n    the adsorptive activity of the charcoal, while the\r\n    white areas represent the charcoal itself. In Fig. 70\r\n    (unactivated) the charcoal itself between the voids\r\n    it seen to be relatively compact, while in Fig. 71\r\n    (activated) it is decidedly granular. This granular\r\n    structure, just visible at this high magnification\r\n    (1000 diameters), probably represents the grosser\r\n    porous structure on which the adsorption really\r\n    depends. These photographs, therefore, show how the\r\n    porosity is increased by activation.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71.—31-Minute Steam Activated Charcoal. Magnified\r\n732 Diameters.]\r\n\r\nThe great demand for charcoal, and the need for activating other than\r\ncocoanut charcoal led to the development of the Dressler tunnel kiln,\r\nwhich seemed to offer many advantages over the Dorsey type of treater.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72.—Sectional View of Dressler Tunnel Kiln, Adapted\r\nto Activation of Charcoal.]\r\n\r\n    “The Dressler tunnel kiln is a type used in general\r\n    ceramic work. The furnace consists essentially of a\r\n    brick kiln about 190 ft. long, 12 ft. broad, and 9\r\n    ft. high, lined with fire brick. Charcoal is loaded\r\n    in shallow, refractory trays in small tram cars,\r\n    about 120 trays to the car. The cars enter the kiln\r\n    through a double door and the charcoal remains in the\r\n    hot zone at a temperature of about 850° C. for about\r\n    4 hrs., depending upon the nature of the material\r\n    charged. Water is atomized into this kiln, and a\r\n    positive pressure maintained in order to exclude\r\n    entrance of air. The kiln is gas-fired and the charcoal\r\n    is activated by the steam in the presence of the\r\n    combustion gases.\r\n\r\n    “Under such treatment the charcoal is given a high\r\n    degree of activation without the usual accompanying\r\n    high losses. Seemingly the oxidizing medium used,\r\n    together with the operating conditions, produce a\r\n    deep penetration of the charcoal particles without\r\n    increasing the extensive surface combustion experienced\r\n    in the steam activators. The capacity of such a type\r\n    furnace is limited only by the size of the installation.\r\n\r\n“The advantages of this type furnace may be tabulated as follows:\r\n\r\n    1—High quality of product.\r\n    2—Small weight and volume losses.\r\n    3—Large capacity per unit.\r\n    4—Minimum initial cost and maintenance of installation.\r\n    5—Simplicity and cheapness of operation.\r\n    6—Adaptability to activation of all carbon materials.\r\n    7—Availability of furnaces of this general type already constructed.”\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBSTITUTES FOR NUT CHARCOAL\r\n\r\nThe first experiments were made with a special anthracite coal\r\n(non-laminated and having conchoidal fracture). This had a life of 560\r\nminutes as against 360 minutes for air treated cocoanut charcoal and\r\n800-900 minutes for steam-treated charcoal.\r\n\r\nWhen the Gas Defense Service tried to activate anthracite on a large\r\nscale in vertical gas retorts at Derby, Connecticut, the attempt was\r\na failure. They carbonized at 900° and then turned on the steam with\r\nthe result that the steam-treated coal had a slightly greater density\r\nthan the untreated, which was wrong, and had a shiny appearance in\r\nparts with roughened deposits in other parts. When the hydrocarbons\r\nare decomposed at high temperatures, the resulting carbon is somewhat\r\ngraphitic, is itself inactive, is not readily oxidized, and impairs\r\nor prevents the activation of the normal carbon upon which it is\r\ndeposited. This discovery made it possible to treat anthracite\r\nsuccessfully. The conditions must be such as to minimize high\r\ntemperature cracking, to carry off or oxidize the hydrocarbons as fast\r\nas formed, and especially to prevent the gases from cooler portions of\r\nthe treater coming in contact with carbon at a much higher temperature.\r\nWith these facts in mind, a plant was built at Springfield which\r\nproduced 10 tons a day of 150-300 minute charcoal from raw anthracite.\r\nThis was one-third of the total production at that time and was mixed\r\nwith the nut charcoal made at Astoria, thereby preventing an absolute\r\nshortage of canister-filling material in October, 1918.\r\n\r\nIt was next shown that the cocoanut charcoal fines resulting from\r\ngrinding and screening losses and amounting to 50 per cent of the\r\nproduct, could be very finely ground, mixed with a binder, and baked\r\nlike ordinary carbon products. By avoiding gas-treating in the bake,\r\nthe resulting charcoal is nearly as good as that from the original\r\nshell. A recovery plant for treating the cocoanut fines was built at\r\nAstoria. The product was called “Coalite.”\r\n\r\nThe great advantage of cocoanut shell as a source of charcoal is that\r\nit is very dense and consequently it is possible to convert it into a\r\nmass having a large number of fine pores, whereas a less dense wood,\r\nlike cedar, will necessarily give more larger pores, which are of\r\nrelatively little value. The cocoanut charcoal is also pretty resistant\r\nto oxidation which seems to make selective oxidation a more simple\r\nmatter. By briquetting different woods, it is possible to make charcoal\r\nfrom them which is nearly equal to that from cocoanut shell.\r\n\r\nBy heating lamp-black with sulfur and briquetting, it was possible to\r\nmake a charcoal having approximately the same service time as cocoanut\r\ncharcoal. A charcoal was made by emulsifying carbon black with soft\r\npitch, which gave the equivalent of 400 minutes against chloropicrin\r\nbefore it had been steam-treated. This looked so good that the plans\r\nwere drawn for making a thousand pounds or more of this product at\r\nWashington to give it a thorough test. This was not done on account\r\nof the cessation of all research work. The possible advantage of this\r\nproduct was the more uniform distribution of binder.\r\n\r\nInstead of steam-treating anthracite coal direct, it was also\r\npulverized, mixed with a binder, and baked into rods which were then\r\nground and activated with steam. The resulting material, which was\r\nknown as Carbonite, had somewhat less activity than the lamp-black\r\nmixes but was very much cheaper. A plant was built to bake 40 tons a\r\nday of this material, which would yield 10 tons a day of active carbon\r\nafter allowing for grinding losses and steam treatment. The plant was\r\nguaranteed to furnish an absorbent having a life of 600 minutes against\r\nchloropicrin.\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMAN CHARCOAL\r\n\r\nAfter the Armistice was signed, Chaney took up the question of how\r\nthe Germans made their charcoal. The German charcoal was made from\r\nconiferous wood and was reported to be as good as ours, in spite of\r\nthe fact that they were using inferior materials. Inside of a month\r\nChaney had found out how the German charcoal was made, had duplicated\r\ntheir material, and had shown that it was nothing like as good as\r\nour charcoal. The Germans impregnated the wood with zinc chloride,\r\ncarbonized at red heat, and washed out most of the zinc chloride. When\r\nthis zinc chloride was found in the German charcoal, it was assumed\r\nthat it had been added after the charcoal had been made. It was\r\ntherefore dissolved out with hydrochloric acid, thereby improving the\r\ncharcoal against chloropicrin. The German charcoal was then tested as\r\nit stood, including the fines, against American charcoal, 8 to 14 mesh.\r\nThe most serious error, however, was in testing only against a high\r\nconcentration of chloropicrin. The German charcoal contains relatively\r\ncoarse pores which condense gases at high concentrations very well but\r\nwhich do not absorb gases strongly at low concentrations. The result\r\nwas that the German charcoal was rated as being four or five times as\r\ngood as it really was.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: German Charcoal. ×200.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73.—Charcoal from Spruce Wood.]\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPARISON OF CHARCOAL\r\n\r\nThe following table shows a comparison of charcoals from different\r\nsources. The method of activation was identical and the times of\r\ntreatment were those approximately giving the highest service time. The\r\nresults against chloropicrin, therefore, represent roughly the relative\r\nexcellence of the charcoal obtainable from various raw materials, using\r\nthis method of activation:\r\n\r\n       COMPARISON OF VARIOUS ACTIVE CHARCOALS ACTIVATED IN LABORATORY\r\n    -----------------+-----------------+---------------+----------------\r\n                     |                 |               |  Accelerated\r\n                     |    Apparent     |Steam Treatment|  Chloropicrin\r\n                     |     Density     |   at 900°     |  Test Results\r\n      Base Material  +-------+---------+----+----------+--------+-------\r\n                     |Primary|Activated|Time|  Weight  | Weight |Service\r\n                     |Carbon | Carbon  |Min.|   Loss   |Absorbed| Time\r\n                     |       |         |    | Per Cent |Per Cent| Min.\r\n    -----------------+-------+---------+----+----------+--------+-------\r\n    Sycamore         | 0.158 |  0.080  |  18|    53    |   41   |  7.3\r\n    Cedar            | 0.223 |  0.097  |  60|    88    |   78   | 16.0\r\n    Mountain mahogany| 0.420 |  0.236  |  60|    44    |   32   | 16.3\r\n    Ironwood         | 0.465 |  0.331  |  60|    44    |   31   | 20.8\r\n    Brazil nut       | 0.520 |  0.316  | 120|    71    |   46   | 32.2\r\n    Ivory nut        | 0.700 |  0.460  | 120|    70    |   48   | 47.0\r\n    Cohune nut       | 0.659 |  0.502  | 120|    48    |   51   | 53.4\r\n    Babassu nut      | 0.540 |  0.322  | 210|    68    |   85   | 58.7\r\n    Cocoanut         | 0.710 |  0.445  | 120|    60    |   61   | 58.4\r\n    Cocoanut         | 0.710 |  0.417  | 180|    75    |   72   | 64.4\r\n    -----------------+-------+---------+----+----------+--------+-------\r\n\r\n                         BRIQUETTED MATERIALS\r\n    -----------------+-------+---------+----+----------+--------+-------\r\n    Sawdust          | 0.542 |  0.365  | 120|    66    |   53   | 40.0\r\n    Carbon black     | 0.769 |  0.444  | 240|    64.3  |   53   | 50.5\r\n    Bituminous coal  | 0.789 |  0.430  | 165|    61    |   58.3 | 46.8\r\n    Anthracite coal  | 0.830 |  0.371  | 480|    81    |   53   | 40.7\r\n    -----------------+-------+---------+----+----------+--------+-------\r\n\r\n    “In conclusion, it will be of interest to compare\r\n    the charcoals manufactured and used by the principal\r\n    belligerent nations, both with one another and with the\r\n    above mentioned laboratory preparations.

However, in the emergency\r\n    production of this material on a large scale, quantity\r\n    and speed were far more important than the absolute\r\n    excellence of the product. It will be noted, for\r\n    instance, that the cocoanut charcoal manufactured by\r\n    the United States, even in November, 1918, was still\r\n    very much inferior to the laboratory samples made from\r\n    the same raw material. This was not because a very\r\n    active charcoal could not be produced on a large scale,\r\n    for even in May, 1918, the possibility of manufacturing\r\n    a 50-min. charcoal on a large scale had been\r\n    conclusively demonstrated, but this activation would\r\n    have required two or three times as much raw material\r\n    and five times as much apparatus as was then available,\r\n    due to the much longer time of heating, and the greater\r\n    losses of carbon occasioned thereby.\r\n\r\n    “It should furthermore be pointed out that the increase\r\n    in the chloropicrin service time of charcoal from\r\n    18 to 50 min. does not represent anything like a\r\n    proportionate increase in its value under field service\r\n    conditions. This is partly due to the fact that the\r\n    increased absorption on the high concentration tests\r\n    is in reality due to condensation in the capillaries,\r\n    which, as has been pointed out, is not of much real\r\n    value. More important than this, however, is the fact\r\n    that most of the important gases used in warfare are\r\n    not held by adsorption only, but by combined adsorption\r\n    and chemical reaction, for which purpose an 18-min.\r\n    charcoal is, in general, almost as good as a 50-min.\r\n    charcoal.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTYPICAL ABSORPTIVE VALUES OF DIFFERENT CHARCOALS AGAINST VARIOUS GASES\r\n\r\n    LEGEND:\r\n    (A) = H₂O Content, (%)\r\n    (B) = Accel.

To overcome these deficiencies the use of\r\nan alkali oxidizing agent in combination with the charcoal has been\r\nfound advisable. The material actually used for this purpose has been\r\ngranules of soda-lime containing sodium permanganate. Its principal\r\nfunction may be said to be to act as a reservoir of large capacity for\r\nthe permanent fixation of the more volatile acid and oxidizable gases.\r\n\r\nThe development of a satisfactory soda-lime was a difficult problem.\r\nThe principal requirements follow: Its _activity_ is not of vital\r\nimportance, as the charcoal is able to take up gas with extreme\r\nrapidity and then later give it off more slowly to the soda-lime.\r\n_Absorptive capacity_ is of the greatest importance, since the\r\nsoda-lime is relied upon to hold in chemical combination a very\r\nlarge amount of toxic gas. Both _chemical stability_ and _mechanical\r\nstrength_ are difficult to attain. The latter had never been solved\r\nuntil the war made some solution absolutely imperative.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITION OF REGULAR ARMY SODA-LIME\r\n\r\nThe exact composition of the army soda-lime has undergone considerable\r\nmodification from time to time as it has been found desirable to change\r\nthe raw materials or the method of manufacture. A rough average formula\r\nwhich will serve to bring out the interrelation between the different\r\nconstituents is as follows:\r\n\r\n     COMPOSITION OF WET MIX\r\n                                 Per Cent\r\n    Hydrated lime                45\r\n    Cement                       14\r\n    Kieselguhr                    6\r\n    Sodium hydroxide              1\r\n    Water                        33 (approx.)\r\n\r\n        AFTER DRYING\r\n    Moisture content              8 (approx.)\r\n\r\n        AFTER SPRAYING\r\n    Moisture content             13 (approx.)\r\n    Sodium permanganate content   3 (approx.)\r\n\r\nWithin limits, the method of manufacture is more important than the\r\ncomposition or other variables, and has been the subject of a great\r\ndeal of research work even on apparently minor details. The process\r\nfinally adopted consists essentially in making a plastic mass of lime,\r\ncement, kieselguhr, caustic soda, and water, spreading in slabs on\r\nwire-bottomed trays, allowing to set for 2 or 3 days under carefully\r\ncontrolled conditions, drying, grinding, and screening to 8-14 mesh,\r\nand finally spraying with a strong solution of sodium permanganate with\r\na specially designed spray nozzle. The spraying process is a recent\r\ndevelopment, most of the soda-lime having been made by putting the\r\nsodium permanganate into the original wet mix. Many difficulties had to\r\nbe overcome in developing the spraying process, but it eventually gave\r\na better final product, and resulted in a large saving of permanganate\r\nwhich was formerly lost during drying, in fines, etc.\r\n\r\n\r\nFUNCTION OF DIFFERENT COMPONENTS\r\n\r\n=Lime.= The hydrated lime furnishes the backbone of the absorptive\r\nproperties of the soda-lime. It constitutes over 50 per cent of the\r\nfinished dry granule and is responsible in a chemical sense for\r\npractically all the gas absorption.\r\n\r\n=Cement.= Cement furnishes a degree of hardness adequate to withstand\r\nservice conditions. It interferes somewhat with the absorptive\r\nproperties of the soda-lime and it is an open question whether the gain\r\nin hardness produced by its use is valuable enough to compensate for\r\nthe decreased absorption which results.\r\n\r\n=Kieselguhr.= The loss in absorptive capacity due to the presence of\r\ncement is in part counterbalanced by the simultaneous introduction of\r\na relatively small weight though considerable bulk, of kieselguhr.\r\nIn some cases, there seems to be a reaction between the lime and the\r\nkieselguhr, which results in some increase in hardness.\r\n\r\n=Sodium Hydroxide.= Sodium hydroxide has two primary functions in\r\nthe soda-lime granule. In the first place, a small amount serves to\r\ngive the granule considerable more activity. The second function is\r\nto maintain roughly the proper moisture content. This water content\r\n(roughly 13-14 per cent after spraying) is very important, in order\r\nthat the maximum gas absorption may be secured.\r\n\r\n=Sodium Permanganate.= The function of the sodium permanganate is to\r\noxidize certain gases, such as arsine,[30] and to act as an assurance\r\nof protection against possible new gases. The purity of the sodium\r\npermanganate solution used was found to be one of the most important\r\nfactors in making stable soda-lime. It was, therefore, necessary to\r\nwork out special methods for its manufacture. Two such methods were\r\ndeveloped, and successfully put into operation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 30: Which, however, was never used on the battlefield.]\r\n\r\nCareful selection of other material is also necessary, and this phase\r\nof the work contributed greatly to the final development of the form of\r\nsoda-lime.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nTESTING ABSORBENTS AND GAS MASKS\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of the first necessities in the development of absorbents and gas\r\nmasks was a method of testing them and comparing their deficiencies.\r\nWhile the ultimate test of the value of an absorbent, canister or\r\nfacepiece is, of course, the actual man test of the complete mask, the\r\ntime consumed in these tests is so great that more rapid tests were\r\ndevised for the control of these factors and the man test used as a\r\ncheck of the purely mechanical methods.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTING OF ABSORBENTS[31]\r\n\r\nAbsorbents should be tested for moisture, hardness, uniformity of\r\nsample and efficiency against various gases.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: See Fieldner and others, _J. Ind. Eng. Chem._, =11=, 519\r\n(1919).]\r\n\r\n_Moisture_ is simply determined by drying for two hours at 150°. The\r\nloss in weight is called moisture.\r\n\r\nThe _hardness_ or _resistance to abrasion_ is determined by shaking\r\na 50-gram sample with steel ball bearings for 30 minutes on a Ro-tap\r\nshaking machine. The material is then screened and the hardness number\r\nis determined by multiplying the weight of absorbent remaining on the\r\nscreen by two.\r\n\r\nThe _efficiency_ of an absorbent against various gases depends upon a\r\nvariety of factors. Because of this, it is necessary to select standard\r\nconditions for the test. These were chosen as follows:\r\n\r\nThe absorbent under test is filled into a sample tube of specified\r\ndiameter (2 cm.) to a depth of 10 cm. by the standard method for\r\nfilling tubes, and a standard concentration (usually 1,000 or 10,000\r\np.p.m. by volume) of the gas in air of definite (50 per cent) humidity\r\nis passed through the absorbent at a rate of 500 cc. per sq. cm. per\r\nmin. The concentration of the entering gas is determined by analysis.\r\nThe length of time is noted from the instant the gas-air mixture is\r\nstarted through the absorbent to the time the gas or some toxic or\r\nirritating reaction product of the gas begins to come through the\r\nabsorbent, as determined by some qualitative test. Quantitative samples\r\nof the outflowing gas are then taken at known intervals and from the\r\namount of gas found in the sample the per cent efficiency of the\r\nabsorbent at the corresponding time is calculated.\r\n\r\n    Per cent efficiency =\r\n                   p.p.m. entering gas - p.p.m. effluent gas\r\n                   -----------------------------------------  × 100.\r\n                          p.p.m. entering gas\r\n\r\nThese efficiencies are plotted against the minutes elapsed from\r\nthe beginning of the test to the middle of the sampling period\r\ncorresponding to that efficiency point. A smooth curve is drawn through\r\nthese points and the efficiency of the absorbent is reported as so many\r\nminutes to the 100, 99, 95, 90, 80, etc., per cent efficiency points.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus used in carrying out this test is shown in Fig. 74.\r\nDescriptive details may be found in the article by Fieldner in _The\r\nJournal of Industrial and Engineering Chemistry_ for June, 1919.\r\nWith modifications for high and low boiling materials, the apparatus\r\nis adapted to such a variety of gases as chlorine, phosgene,\r\ncarbon dioxide, sulfur dioxide, hydrocyanic acid, benzyl bromide,\r\nchloropicrin, superpalite, etc.\r\n\r\nAs the quality of the charcoal increased, the so-called standard test\r\nrequired so long a period that an accelerated test was devised. In this\r\nthe rate was increased to 1,000 cc. per minute, the relative humidity\r\nof the gas-air mixture was decreased to zero, and the concentration\r\nwas about 7,000 p.p.m. The rate is obtained by using a tube with an\r\ninternal diameter of 1.41 cm. instead of 2.0 cm.\r\n\r\n\r\nCANISTERS\r\n\r\nAfter an absorbent has been developed to a given point, and is\r\nconsidered of sufficient value to be used in a canister, the materials\r\nare assembled as described in Chapter XII. While the final test is\r\nthe actual use of the canister, machine tests have been devised which\r\ngive valuable information regarding the value of the absorbent in the\r\ncanister and the method of filling.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74.—Standard Two-tube Apparatus for Testing\r\nAbsorbents, Showing Arrangement for Gases Stored in Cylinders.]\r\n\r\nThe first test must be that for _leakage_. The canister must show no\r\nsigns of leaking when submitted to an air pressure of 15 inches of\r\nmercury (about half of the normal atmospheric pressure).\r\n\r\nThe second factor tested is the _resistance to air flow_. This is\r\ndetermined at a flow of 85 liters per minute and should not exceed 3\r\ninches. The latest canister design has a much lower resistance (from 2\r\nto 2½ inches).\r\n\r\nThe third test is the _efficiency_ of the canister against various\r\ngases. For routine work, phosgene, chloropicrin and hydrocyanic acid\r\nare used against the standard mixture of charcoal and soda-lime:\r\nChloropicrin is usually used against straight charcoal fillings, while\r\nphosgene and hydrocyanic acid are used against soda-lime.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 75.—Apparatus for Testing Canisters Against\r\nChloropicrin.]\r\n\r\nDifferent types of apparatus are required for these gases. They are\r\nvery complicated, as may be seen from the sketch in Fig. 75, and\r\nyet a man very quickly learns the procedure necessary to carry out\r\na test of this kind. The gas is passed through the canister under\r\ngiven conditions, until at the end of the apparatus a test paper or\r\nsolution indicates that the gas is no longer absorbed but is passing\r\nthrough unchanged. This point is called the “break point,” and the time\r\nrequired to reach this point is known as the life of the canister. This\r\ntime is also the time to 100 per cent efficiency. Other points, such\r\nas 99, 95, 90 and 80 per cent efficiency are determined. These are\r\nused in comparing canisters.\r\n\r\nThe canister tests were of two general classes: continuous and\r\nintermittent. In the first the air-gas mixture was drawn through\r\ncontinuously until the break point was reached. The results obtained\r\nin this way, however, did not give the time measure of the value of\r\na canister in actual use. The intermittent test differs only in that\r\nthe flow of air-gas mixture is intermittent, corresponding to regular\r\nbreathing. Special valves were adapted to this work.\r\n\r\nCanisters must also be tested as to the protection they offer against\r\nsmoke. These methods are discussed in Chapter XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nMAN TESTS\r\n\r\nThe final test of the canister is always carried out by means of the\r\nso-called “man test.” Special man-test laboratories were built at\r\nWashington, Philadelphia and Long Island. These are so constructed\r\nthat, if necessary, a man may enter the chamber containing the gas and\r\nthus test the efficiency of the completed gas mask. In most cases,\r\nhowever, the canister is placed inside or outside the gas-chamber and\r\nthe men breathe through the canister, detecting the break point by\r\nthroat and lung irritation.\r\n\r\nThe following brief description of the man test laboratory at the\r\nAmerican University will give a good idea of the plan and procedure.[32]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: Taken from Fieldner’s article mentioned above.]\r\n\r\nThe man test laboratory is a one-story building, 56 ft. in length and\r\n25 ft. in width. The main part is occupied by three gas chambers,\r\nlaboratory tables, and various devices for putting up and controlling\r\ngas concentrations in the chambers. A small part at one end is used as\r\nan office and storeroom.\r\n\r\nGood ventilation is of great importance in a laboratory of this nature.\r\nThis is secured by means of a 6 ft. fan connected to suitable ducts.\r\nThe fan is mounted on a heavy framework outside and at one end of the\r\nbuilding. The fan is driven at a speed of about 250 r.p.m. by a 10 h.p.\r\nmotor. The main duct is 33 in. square, extending to all parts of the\r\nbuilding. A connection is also made to a small hood used when making\r\nchemical analyses.\r\n\r\nThe gases, fumes, etc., drawn out by the fan, are forced up and out of\r\na stack 30 in. in diameter, extending upward 55 ft. above the ground\r\nlevel.\r\n\r\nThe main features of each of the three gas chambers are identical.\r\nAuxiliary pieces of apparatus are used with each chamber, the type of\r\napparatus being determined by the characteristics of the gas employed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76.—Man Test Laboratory, American University.]\r\n\r\nEach chamber is 10 ft. long, 8 ft. wide and 8½ ft. high, having,\r\ntherefore, a capacity of 680 cu. ft. or 19,257 liters. The floor is\r\nconcrete, and the walls and ceiling are constructed on a framework\r\nof 2 × 4 in. scantling, finished on the outside with wainscoting and\r\non the inside with two layers of Upson board (laid with the joints\r\nlapped) covered with a ½ in. layer of special cement plaster laid upon\r\nexpanded metal lath. The interior finish is completed by two coats of\r\nacid-proof white paint. The single entrance to the chamber is from\r\noutside the laboratory, and is closed by two doors, with a 36 × 40 in.\r\nlock between them. These doors are solid, of 3-ply construction, 2½ in.\r\nthick, with refrigerator handles, which may be operated from either\r\ninside or outside the chamber. The door jambs are lined with ³/₁₆ in.\r\nheavy rubber tubing to secure a tight seal.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the chamber opposite the doors, a pane of ¼ in. wire\r\nplate glass, 36 × 48 in., is set into the wall, and additional\r\nillumination may be secured by 2 headlights, 12 in. square, set into\r\nthe ceiling of the chamber and of the air-lock, respectively, and\r\nprovided with 200 watt Mazda lamps and Holophane reflectors. Openings\r\ninto the chamber, five in number, are spaced across this end beneath\r\nthe window and 9 in. above the table top.\r\n\r\nFans are installed for keeping the concentration uniform.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77.—Details of Canister Holder.]\r\n\r\nVarious devices have been installed for attaching the canister to be\r\ntested (Fig. 77). This arrangement allows the canister to be changed at\r\nwill without any necessity for disturbing the concentration of gas by\r\nentering the chamber.\r\n\r\nArrangements for removing the gas from the chamber consist of a small\r\n“bleeder” which allows a continuous escape of small amounts and a large\r\nblower for rapidly exhausting the entire contents of the chamber.\r\n\r\nOther general features of the equipment deal with the determination\r\nof the physical condition surrounding the tests, often a matter of\r\nconsiderable importance. The temperature of the gas inside the chamber\r\nis easily ascertained by means of a thermometer suspended inside the\r\nwindow in such a position as to be read from the outside. The relative\r\nhumidity of the mixture of air and gas in the chamber is determined by\r\nmeans of a somewhat modified Regnault dew point apparatus mounted on\r\nthe built-in table.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESSURE DROP AND LEAK DETECTING APPARATUS\r\n\r\nAnother piece of apparatus consists of a combined pressure drop machine\r\nand leak tester (Fig. 78) for measuring the resistance of canisters\r\nand testing them for faulty construction. This is mounted on a small\r\ntable, with the motor and air pump installed on a shelf underneath.\r\nThe resistance, or pressure drop, of canisters is measured by the\r\nflow meter _A_ and the water manometer _B_. Air is drawn through the\r\ncanister and the flow meter _A_ at the rate of 85 liters per min.,\r\nthe flow being adjusted by the needle valve. The pressure drop across\r\nthe canister is read on the water manometer _B_, one end of which is\r\nconnected to the suction line, the other open to the air. The reading\r\nis generally made in inches, correction being made for the resistance\r\nof the connecting hose and the apparatus itself.\r\n\r\nCanisters are tested for leaks by the apparatus shown at _D_ in Fig.\r\n78. The canister is clamped down tightly by wing nuts against a piece\r\nof heavy ¼-in. sheet rubber large enough to cover completely the bottom\r\nof the canister and prevent any inflow of air through the valve.\r\nSuction is then applied, and a leak is indicated by a steady flow of\r\nair bubbles through the liquid in the gas-washing cylinder _E_. A\r\nsecond gas-washing cylinder, empty, is inserted in the line between _E_\r\nand the canister as a trap for any liquid drawn back when the suction\r\nis shut off. If a leak is shown, it can be located by applying air\r\npressure to the canister and then immersing it in water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78.—Apparatus for Determining Pressure Drop and for\r\nDetecting Leaks in Canisters.]\r\n\r\n\r\nMETHODS OF CONDUCTING TESTS\r\n\r\nThree general methods of conducting man tests are followed:\r\n\r\n(1) Canisters are placed in the brackets outside the chamber or\r\nfastened to the wall tubes within the chamber. The subjects of the\r\ntest remain outside the chamber, and the facepieces of the masks are\r\nconnected directly to the canisters, in the first case, and to the\r\nwall tubes connecting with the canisters, in the second case. The\r\nconcentration is established and the time noted. Then the men put on\r\nthe masks and breathe until they can detect the gas coming through\r\nthe canisters. Reading matter is provided for the men during the test\r\nperiod. When gas is detected, the time is again noted and the time\r\nrequired for the gas to penetrate the canister is reported as the “time\r\nto break down” or “service time” of the canister. Ten canisters are\r\ntested at one time, and the average of the results for the 10 canisters\r\nis taken for that type of canister. Much less accurate results are\r\nobtained when the final figure is based on a small number of canisters.\r\nThis is largely due to the various breathing rates and sensitiveness of\r\ndifferent men.\r\n\r\n(2) The canisters are placed as in (1), but it is only necessary\r\nto know if they will give perfect protection for a given length of\r\ntime. The procedure is the same as in (1), except that the test is\r\narbitrarily stopped at the end of the indicated time, and the number of\r\ncanisters and the service times of the same noted.\r\n\r\n(3) When the canisters are of such a type that they cannot be properly\r\ntested as in (1), or when it is desired to test the penetrability of\r\nthe facepiece, the men wear the complete mask and enter the chamber.\r\nThey remain until gas penetrates the canister or the facepiece, as\r\nthe case may be, or until it is determined that the desired degree of\r\nprotection is afforded. The service time is computed as in (1).\r\n\r\n(4) Maximum-breathing-rate tests are made either by men in the chamber\r\nor by the men outside, in which they do vigorous work on a bicycle\r\nergometer. In this test the average man will run his breathing rate up\r\nto 60 or 70 liters per min.\r\n\r\nThe concentration of the gas is followed throughout the test by\r\naspirating samples and analyzing them.\r\n\r\n=Type of Masks Used.= In the future the 1919 model will be used for\r\nall tests. In general, during the War, the following procedure held,\r\nalthough variations occurred in special cases:\r\n\r\nWhen men entered a gas-chamber, the full facepiece was, of course,\r\nrequired. The type of facepiece was determined by the nature of the\r\ngas. If the gas was most easily detected by odor or eye irritation, a\r\nmodified Tissot mask was used. If it was most easily detected by throat\r\nirritation, a mouth-breathing mask was employed.\r\n\r\nWhen men were outside the chamber, the choice was made in the\r\nsame manner, except in the case of detection of the gas by throat\r\nirritation. In this case the mouthpiece was attached to two or three\r\nlengths of breathing tubes and a separate noseclip was used. The\r\nfacepiece was not needed and the men were much more comfortable without\r\nit.\r\n\r\n=Disinfection of Masks.= Mouthpieces are disinfected after use by\r\nfirst holding them under a stream of running water and brushing out\r\nthoroughly with a test tube brush; then the latter is dipped into a 2\r\nper cent solution of lysol, and the inner parts of the mouthpiece are\r\nbrushed out well; finally the mouthpiece and exhaling valve are dipped\r\nbodily into the lysol solution and allowed to dry without rinsing.\r\nTissot masks are wiped out with a cloth moistened in alcohol, followed\r\nby another cloth moistened in 2 per cent lysol solution. The flexible\r\ntubes are given periodic rinsings with 95 per cent alcohol.\r\n\r\n=Applicability of Man Tests.= Man tests are applicable to all gases\r\nwhich can be detected by the subject of the test before he breathes a\r\ndangerous amount.\r\n\r\nThe man test laboratory described above provides facilities for\r\nobtaining information concerning the efficiency of canisters,\r\nfacepieces, etc., within very short periods of time, without waiting\r\nfor the construction of special apparatus required for machine tests.\r\nTo get satisfactory results from machine tests, a delicate qualitative\r\nchemical test for the gas is essential. Man tests can be made when such\r\na qualitative test is not known. Further, man tests can be made with\r\nhigher concentrations of some gases than is practicable with machines.\r\nEvolution of excessive amounts of moisture when high concentrations of\r\nsome gases are used causes much more trouble with machine tests than\r\nwith man tests.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, man tests are adversely affected by the varying\r\nsensitiveness and lung capacities of the men, and the humidity of the\r\nair-gas mixture is not subject to as exact control as is the case with\r\nmachine tests.\r\n\r\n\r\nFIELD TESTS\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that all of the above tests are concerned only\r\nwith the efficiency of the absorbent and its packing in the canister.\r\nNo attempt was made to determine the comfort and general “feel” of the\r\nmask. For this purpose field tests were devised, covering periods from\r\ntwo to five hours. The first test was a five-hour continuous wearing\r\ntest. It was assumed that any mask which could be worn for five hours\r\nwithout developing any marked features of discomfort could, if the\r\noccasion demanded it, be worn for a much longer period of time. A\r\ntypical test follows:\r\n\r\n     8:00 to  8:30  Instruction and adjustment of gas mask.\r\n                        Gas-chamber tests\r\n     8:30 to  9:30  Games involving mental and physical activity\r\n     9:30 to 11:30  Cross-country hike with suitable periods of rest\r\n    11:30 to 12:00  Tests of vision\r\n    12:00 to 12:30  Games to test mental condition of subjects\r\n    12:30 to  1:00  Gas-chamber fit test\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79.—Hemispherical Vision Chart.]\r\n\r\nVision was tested by means of a hemispherical chart (Fig. 79). This\r\nchart was 6 ft. in diameter and was constructed of heavy paper laid\r\nover a wire frame. A hinged head rest was provided for holding the\r\nsubject’s head firmly in position with the center directly between the\r\neyes. The subject wearing the mask took up his position, and with one\r\neye closed at a time, indicated how far along the meridian of longitude\r\nhe could see with the other eye. The observer sketched in the limit of\r\nvision by outlining the perimeter of the roughly circular field allowed\r\nby each eyepiece. The intersection of the two fields gave the extent of\r\nbinocular vision possible with the mask.\r\n\r\nVarious other tests were also used, in order that the extent and nature\r\nof the vision could be accurately determined.\r\n\r\nAside from the problems of comfort, protection, vision and other\r\nimportant features of gas mask efficiency, the question arose as to\r\nwhether certain designs of masks or canisters were mechanically able\r\nto withstand the rough treatment they were certain to receive in\r\nactual field service. A test was, therefore, developed to simulate\r\nsuch service as transportation of masks from base depots to the front,\r\ncarrying of supplies and munitions by men wearing masks in the “alert”\r\nposition, exposure to rain and mud, hasty adjustment of masks during\r\ngas alarms and typical mistreatment of masks by the soldiers.\r\n\r\nAll these tests were of great value in the development of a good gas\r\nmask.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nOTHER DEFENSIVE MEASURES\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTECTIVE CLOTHING\r\n\r\nProtective clothing was an additional feature of the general program\r\nof protection. As far as factory protection is concerned, the use of\r\nprotective garments was more or less of a temporary expedient and they\r\nwere abandoned as fast as automatic machinery and standard practice\r\nmade their use less necessary. It is likewise a question regarding\r\ntheir value at the front. It is very certain that the garments\r\ndeveloped needed to be made lighter and more comfortable to be of much\r\nvalue to the fighting unit.\r\n\r\nThe first development of protective clothing was along the lines of\r\nfactory protection. The large number of casualties in connection with\r\nthe manufacture of mustard gas made it imperative that the workmen\r\nbe protected not only from splashes of the liquid mustard gas, but\r\nalso from its vapors. The first suit developed provided protection to\r\nthe entire body. The ordinary clothing materials and even rubberized\r\nfabrics offered little protection but it was found that certain\r\noilcloths were practically impermeable to mustard gas. The suit was a\r\nsingle garment, buttoning in the back, with no openings in the front,\r\nno pockets and with tie-strings at wrists and ankles. The head was\r\nprotected by means of an aluminium helmet, supported by means of a head\r\nband resting on the head like a cap and slung from the inside of the\r\nhelmet; this permitted slight head motions independent of the helmet.\r\nIn order to provide cooling and ventilating and pure air breathing, the\r\nsuit was inflated by pumping a considerable volume of air into the suit\r\nthrough a flexible hose long enough to permit considerable freedom of\r\nmovement.\r\n\r\nThis suit had the very great disadvantage of limiting the range of\r\nmotion to the length of the hose. Because of this, a Tissot type mask\r\nwas used in place of the helmet and hose connections. The hood was made\r\nof the same special oilcloth as the suit, enveloped the head and neck\r\nand extended a short distance down the back and over the chest. The\r\ncanister was slung on the left hip by an oilcloth harness and was kept\r\nfrom swinging by an oilcloth belt around the waist. The canister was\r\nmuch larger than the standard box respirator, had a much longer life\r\nwith lower resistance and weighed about 3.5 lbs.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 80.—Impervious Overall Suit for Mustard Gas.]\r\n\r\nAnother type of impervious overall suit was developed which protected\r\nagainst mustard gas for over 100 minutes. The material was a cotton\r\nsheeting which was impregnated with linseed oil containing a suitable\r\nnon-drying material, which was thoroughly oxidized in the fabric. These\r\nsuits proved to be very uncomfortable, especially in warm weather,\r\nbecause they entirely prevented the escape of perspiration from the\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nSemi-permeable suits were then prepared, in which the cotton sheeting\r\nwas impregnated or coated with a solution of gelatin and glycerine. The\r\nfabric was then “tanned” to render the gelatin insoluble in water. Such\r\na suit is valuable for factory wear, but the impregnating material is\r\neasily leached out and the suit is therefore not recommended for field\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nThis was built with an inside layer of dry cloth together with an\r\noutside layer of treated cloth to afford the necessary chemical\r\nprotection against mustard gas. Work of fabrication consisted in\r\ntreating the cloth with simplexene, cutting the suits to design and\r\nsize, and sewing them together.\r\n\r\nTreatment consisted in passing the fabric through a dye machine, then\r\nthrough the wringer rolls where the excess oil was expressed. The\r\ninner layer of dry cloth was found necessary, since the cloth was cut\r\nas soon as treated. Simplexene does not attain the maximum degree of\r\n“tackiness” for two or three days, owing to the presence in the oil of\r\na small amount of volatile spirits. However, by allowing the cloth to\r\nair for 48 hours before cutting, the inner lining could probably be\r\ndispensed with.\r\n\r\nThe fighting suits were distributed among various detachments using\r\nmustard gas in field tests, and in other places where protection\r\nagainst vapor was needed and where field conditions were approximated.\r\nThe tests showed that the suit gave satisfactory protection for\r\nconsiderable periods against mustard gas vapors. No other suit, equal\r\nboth in porosity and protection, has yet been submitted, although\r\nsamples furnishing better protection with much higher resistance have\r\nbeen examined. The protection of the simplexene suit is about 30\r\nminutes against saturated gas. A large number of these suits were made\r\nand taken abroad for field tests at the front.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTECTIVE GLOVES\r\n\r\nProtective gloves have been made with a variety of impregnating agents.\r\nThe one which was selected for large scale production was impregnated\r\nwith a solution of cellulose nitrate because of the availability of\r\nmaterials and the protection offered by the finished product. The\r\nmaterial is impregnated after being made up. The one finger type of\r\nglove is used. The gloves are placed on wooden forms and dipped into\r\nthe impregnating solution. After draining a few minutes, the gloves\r\nare turned upside down on racks and run through a drying oven. Finally\r\nthey are removed from the forms and conditioned by drying at a moderate\r\ntemperature for several hours. After being properly cured they are\r\nfitted with two straps on the gauntlet of each glove. They should offer\r\nprotection to chloropicrin (standard method of test) for 30 minutes.\r\nWhen subjected to rough work they will last from one to two weeks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 81.—Coated Gloves for Protection against Mustard\r\nGas.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTECTIVE OINTMENTS\r\n\r\nThe extensive use of mustard gas on the field caused the men to be\r\nexposed to low concentrations of the vapors for extended periods of\r\ntime. Since it did not seem feasible to furnish the men with special\r\nfighting suits, which would protect them against these vapors, it was\r\ndesirable to provide protection in the form of an ointment which could\r\nbe applied to the body. In order to be satisfactory an ointment should\r\nhave the following properties:\r\n\r\n    (_a_) It should protect against saturated mustard\r\n       gas during the longest possible exposure.\r\n\r\n    (_b_) Its protective action should last as long\r\n       as possible after the application of the ointment.\r\n       It was felt that the ointment should give protection\r\n       for 24 hours after it is applied, even if the body is\r\n       perspiring freely.\r\n\r\n    (_c_) The material should not be easily rubbed off\r\n       under the clothing.\r\n\r\n    (_d_) It should be non-irritating to the membranes\r\n       of the body.\r\n\r\n    (_e_) There should be no likelihood of toxic\r\n       after-effects on long use.\r\n\r\n    (_f_) It should be of a good consistency under a\r\n       fairly wide temperature range and give a good coating\r\n       at the temperature of the body.\r\n\r\n    (_g_) Its method of manufacture should be simple\r\n       and rapid, and the raw materials required should be\r\n       abundant.\r\n\r\n    (_h_) The cost should not be excessive.\r\n\r\nAn extensive study of this question was made both in the laboratories\r\nand on the field. At first it was believed that successful results\r\ncould be obtained by the use of such ointments. Careful investigation\r\nshowed, however, that while these ointments really did protect against\r\nrather high concentrations of vapor for short times of exposure, they\r\nwere probably not so valuable when used against low concentrations\r\nover an extended period of time. It was further demonstrated that the\r\nprotection furnished by a coating of linseed oil is practically equal\r\nto the best ointment which has been developed. About 150 ointments were\r\nprepared and tested. These consisted of two parts or components, the\r\nmetallic soap or other solid material and the oil or liquid part which\r\nbound and held the solid. The latter is called the base. The best base\r\nis lanolin, containing 30 per cent of water. A solution of wax in olive\r\noil was next best. Of the metallic soaps the oleates and linoleates are\r\nbetter than the stearates. A satisfactory ointment has the following\r\ncomposition:\r\n\r\n    Zinc oxide                  40\r\n    Linseed oil (raw)           20\r\n    Lard                        20\r\n    Lanolin                     20\r\n\r\nA modification of this formula is:\r\n\r\n    Zinc oxide                  45\r\n    Linseed oil                 30\r\n    Lard                        10\r\n    Lanolin                     15\r\n\r\nThe physical properties of this ointment are very good. It forms a\r\nsmooth, even coating on the skin, sticks well enough not to rub off\r\neasily on the clothing and yet is not sticky. Its consistency is\r\nsuch that it can be readily pressed from an ointment tube. A. E. F.\r\nreports indicate that sag paste (zinc stearate and vegetable oil) is as\r\nsatisfactory as any of the preparations tried.\r\n\r\nThe great difficulties of such preparation from a field point of view\r\nare: Extra weight to be carried by the soldiers, necessity for keeping\r\nin tight boxes or tubes, thereby adding to the difficulty of carrying,\r\nand finally, the difficulty encountered when applying it properly to\r\nthe body in the field, where gas contaminated hands may cause harm.\r\n\r\nThe paste was too late a development for thorough field trial. It was\r\nused just enough to cause severe partisan controversies between its\r\nadvocates and those opposed to it. Unquestionably, it proved of decided\r\nvalue in preventing mustard gas burns when properly applied. There are\r\nmany authentic cases where men alongside each other were similarly\r\ngassed except as to burns. The difference in burns arose from the use\r\nor non-use of the paste, and in some cases of poor application. Fries\r\nis of the opinion that had the war lasted another year the use of\r\npastes would have become universal unless some thoroughly successful\r\nsubstance for impregnating the uniform or underclothing had been\r\ndeveloped. This is likewise his belief for the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTECTION OF ANIMALS\r\n\r\n=Horse Mask.= The need of protection for animals (horses and dogs),\r\nalthough not as great as in the case of men, was of sufficient\r\nimportance so that masks and boots were developed for the horse and a\r\nmask for the dog.\r\n\r\nThe German horse mask was the first produced. It was of the nose bag\r\ntype, enveloping the mouth and nose of the animal. It was fitted with a\r\ncomplicated drawstring and with snap hooks fastening it to the harness.\r\nThe interior contains a plate of stiff material to prevent the collapse\r\nof the bag. The mask itself was apparently not impregnated, but was\r\nused wet or with a filling of wet straw or rags to act as the absorbent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 82.—German Respirator for Horses.]\r\n\r\nThe French had two types of horse masks impregnated with a\r\nglycerine-nickel hydroxide mixture. One type had a closed bottom, while\r\nin the other, the bottom was open.\r\n\r\nThe British horse mask has a two-layer flannelette bag, with a canvas\r\nmouth pad and elastic drawstring. It was impregnated with a mixture of\r\nphenol, formaldehyde, ammonia, canister soda and glycerine.\r\n\r\nThe first type of American horse mask was modelled after\r\nthe British and was impregnated with the Komplexene mixture\r\n(hexamethylenetetramine, glycerine, nickel sulfate mixture). This mask\r\nhad too high a resistance and caused complete exhaustion in running\r\nhorses. The second mask was made of a large number of layers of very\r\nopen cheesecloth. It consists of two bags, impregnated with different\r\nmixtures (Komplexene and Simplexene). Horses can run two miles with\r\nthis mask without showing evidences of exhaustion.\r\n\r\nDewey gives the following method of manufacture:\r\n\r\nThe chemical employed consisted of a mixture of hexamethylenetetramine\r\n(to give protection against phosgene), nickel sulfate (to protect\r\nagainst the possible use of hydrocyanic acid), sodium carbonate and\r\nglycerine. This solution was mixed in a heavy steam jacketed mixing\r\nkettle with heavy geared stirrers. The mixture was conducted by pipes\r\nto the impregnating apparatus which consisted of a rotary laundry\r\nwashing machine. The masks were treated in this machine for 15 minutes,\r\nand then placed in a power operated wringer and the solution driven off\r\nto a given weight. Following this operation, they were suspended on\r\nwire supports and conducted through a hot air drying machine and dried\r\nto a definite weight. 378,000 horse masks were produced at the rate of\r\n5,000 per day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 83.—Horse Mask—American Type.]\r\n\r\nTheoretically, horse masks and horse boots are very\r\nvaluable,—practically, they did very little actual good in the field,\r\nnot that they would not protect or that animals would not wear them.\r\nThe trouble was with the riders and drivers. Gas attacks, coming\r\nusually at night, made adjustment of horse masks difficult at best,\r\nwhile in the confusion of bursting shell and smoke, the drivers\r\nabsolutely forgot the horse masks or after putting on their own masks\r\nfeared to try putting masks on the animals. This last was natural as\r\nmost animals fight the adjustment of the mask and in so doing there is\r\ngreat risk that the man’s mask may be torn off and the man gassed. In\r\nthe future, such masks will have even more importance than in the past,\r\nfor the present methods of manufacture of mustard gas coupled with its\r\nall-round effectiveness will cause a use of it ten-fold greater than at\r\nany time in the World War. In such cases, operations will necessarily\r\nbe frequently carried on over large areas thoroughly poisoned with\r\nmustard gas. Here the animals will be masked and booted before entering\r\nthe gassed area, and remain so until they leave it. In the torn and\r\nbroken ground around the front line there will always be need for\r\nanimal transportation,—wagon, cart and horse—as in such places it is\r\nfar better in nearly all cases than motor transport.\r\n\r\n=Dog Mask.= The use of dogs in messenger service and in Red Cross work,\r\nin which gassed areas must be passed, led to the designing of a mask\r\nto give the animals suitable protection. The same materials and method\r\nof impregnation were used as in the horse mask. With eight layers of\r\ncheesecloth, adequate protection against mustard gas was secured with\r\npractically no pressure drop.\r\n\r\nThe eyepieces were made of thin sheets of cellulose acetate bound\r\naround the edge with adhesive tape and sewed directly over openings\r\ncut through the mask fabric. The ear pockets were made round and full\r\nenough to fit pointed or lop-eared animals. The mask is continued to\r\nform a wide neck band which may be drawn up by two adjustable straps.\r\nIt is made sufficiently full to allow a free movement of the dog’s jaws\r\nand yet tight enough around the neck to avoid the possibility of being\r\npawed off. The dog apparently soon became accustomed to wearing the\r\nmask.\r\n\r\n=Horse Boots.= The increasing amount of mustard gas used on the Western\r\nfront made it seem necessary to develop some form of protection for the\r\nhorse’s hoof and fore-leg. It has been found that mustard gas vapors\r\nattack the fleshy portion of the leg, especially around the coronary\r\nband and causes inflammation of the frog of the foot. The problem was\r\nsolved by devising a special hoof pad and a boot. The pad was made of\r\nsheet iron imbedded in a hoof protector (composition rubber) to which\r\nthe shoe is applied. The shoe just overlaps the metal plate on the\r\ninside and provides a solid metal surface for the bottom of the foot.\r\nSuch a pad not only offers protection against gas but against shell\r\nsplinters, barbed wire, etc., and would be useful at all times on the\r\nfront.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 84.—Impervious Boots and Pads to Protect Horses’\r\nLegs and Hoofs against Mustard Gas.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 85.—Protective Gas Outfit—Gas Mask, Gas Suit,\r\nGloves, Boots, Horse Mask, Horse Boots, Horse Pads.]\r\n\r\nThe boot was made of satin, treated so as to be impervious to mustard\r\ngas. It covers all of the foot except the bottom and extends to just\r\nbelow the knee. The boot is held in contact with the hoof by a sewed\r\ncloth strap, which passes around the bottom of the hoof and is held in\r\nposition by projections extending from the spur or toe clip. Special\r\ncare is taken to insure a perfect joint at the rear of the boot since\r\nthe small cavity in the back of the hoof is one of the most sensitive\r\nparts. The boot is wrapped about one and a half times around the leg\r\nand is clipped with five loops through which passes a ¾-inch strap.\r\n\r\n=Dugout Blankets.= Dugout protection is intended to prevent entrance of\r\nany gases, lethal, lachrymatory or irritant, into the enclosed space.\r\nThis has been most efficiently accomplished by means of curtains hung\r\nupon wooden frames and fitting closely against all edges of the opening\r\nto be closed. These curtains have usually been of heavy material and\r\nhave generally been spoken of as dugout blankets. Since they were\r\ndesigned to exclude all toxic gases, they had to be devised upon\r\ngeneral mechanical principles rather than upon principles of chemical\r\naction with specific gases. Permeability to air has not been considered\r\na necessity, it being held that sufficient ventilation is secured by\r\nmeans of the air entering through the soil. For large dugouts and\r\nextended use large air filters were designed to draw pure air into the\r\ndugout with a fan.\r\n\r\nThe qualities aimed at, to which both fabric and treatment should\r\ncontribute, are the following:\r\n\r\n    (_a_) Impermeability to gas.\r\n    (_b_) Flexibility, especially at low temperatures.\r\n    (_c_) Non-inflammability.\r\n    (_d_) Freedom from stickiness and from tendency to lose\r\n                    material by drainage under action of gravity.\r\n    (_e_) Mechanical strength.\r\n    (_f_) Simplicity of manufacture and treatment.\r\n    (_g_) Low cost.\r\n\r\nArmy blankets, both those for men and those for horses, proved suitable\r\nmaterials for curtains, but the scarcity of wool made it desirable to\r\nselect an all cotton fabric.\r\n\r\nA large number of oils were studied as impregnating agents. The most\r\nsatisfactory mixture consisted of 85 per cent of a heavy steam refined\r\ncylinder oil and 15 per cent of linseed oil. This is taken up to the\r\nextent of about 300 per cent increase in weight of the blanket during\r\nimpregnation. It becomes oxidized to some extent upon the surface of\r\nthe blanket, which becomes less oily than the soft, central core.\r\nThe finished blanket possessed the following properties: It resists\r\npenetration of 400-600 p.p.m. of chloropicrin for 8 hours (dugout test)\r\nand mustard gas for 100-400 minutes (machine test). It is sufficiently\r\nflexible after standing for 2 hours at 18° F. to unroll of its own\r\nweight, and may be unrolled by applying a slight force at 6° F.; it is\r\nnot ignited by lighted matches and shows but little loss by drainage.\r\n\r\nTwo types of machines were designed for impregnation, one for use on\r\nlarge scale behind the line, and a field apparatus for use at the\r\nfront.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nSCREENING SMOKES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe intelligent use of screening smokes in modern infantry tactics\r\noffers innumerable advantages through concealment and deception. It\r\nconfers upon daylight operations many of the advantages which were\r\ngained by conducting operations at night with few of the disadvantages\r\nof the latter.\r\n\r\nSmoke screens have been frequently used by the Navy and by Merchantmen;\r\na common method of escape was to shut off the air from the fire with\r\nconsequent incomplete combustion of the fuel, thus causing a cloud of\r\ndense black smoke. This is often mentioned in the blockade runners of\r\nthe days in the Civil War, where wood, high in pitch and rosin, was\r\nfreely introduced into the furnaces, in order that they might escape\r\nunder cover of this smoke.\r\n\r\nEarly in the present war it was found that black smoke had a low\r\nobscuring power, showed frequent rents or holes and were difficult\r\nto standardize. Their production also caused a considerable loss in\r\nthe speed of the vessel. They therefore fell into disuse except for\r\nemergency purposes and today the standard smoke for screening purposes\r\nof all kinds is, without exception, white.[33]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: While it is a well known fact that black smoke is not as\r\nefficient as white smoke for screening purposes, the reason for this\r\nfact is not clear.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPROPERTIES OF SMOKE CLOUD\r\n\r\nThe properties most desired in a screening smoke, apart from low cost,\r\nare: (_a_) _Maximum screening power_, which refers to the question of\r\ndensity, i.e., a relatively thin layer must completely obscure any\r\nobject behind it, and (_b_) _Stability_, which implies, among other\r\nthings, a low rate of settling or dissipation. There is little reason\r\nto doubt that, within limits, the smaller the particles of a smoke\r\ncloud, the more completely will the smoke possess these qualities.\r\nThe screening power of a smoke cloud depends very largely upon the\r\nscattering of the light coming through it, and by analogy with those\r\npeculiar solutions which we call colloidal, we should expect the\r\nscattering to increase as the degree of subdivision increases, within\r\nlimits. The rate of settling is unquestionably an inverse function\r\nof the size of the particles. The chief aim, therefore, in smoke\r\nproduction is to attain as high a degree of subdivision as possible.\r\nMethods may be classified as good or bad, in so far as they satisfy or\r\nfail to satisfy this criterion.\r\n\r\n\r\nRAW MATERIALS FOR SMOKE CLOUDS\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that only gases or substances capable of being brought\r\ninto the vapor state or into a very fine state of subdivision can be\r\nused for producing smoke clouds. The reaction product, of which the\r\nsmoke particles consist, should preferably be:\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Solid._ Otherwise the particles will tend to grow in size by\r\ncondensation of the liquid particles present in the cloud.\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Non-volatile._ If volatile, the particles will disappear by\r\nevaporation as the cloud is diluted by air currents. Larger particles\r\nwill also form at the expense of the smaller ones.\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Non-deliquescent._ If the particles are deliquescent, they will\r\ntend to grow by condensation of water vapor upon them.\r\n\r\n(_d_) _Stable_ towards the usual components of the atmosphere,\r\nespecially moisture.\r\n\r\nWhile it might seem that it would be difficult to fulfill these\r\nconditions, there are several chemical compounds which have been\r\nsuccessfully used as smoke producers. This does not mean that they\r\nfulfill all the conditions, but they represent a compromise between the\r\nvarious requirements.\r\n\r\n=Phosphorus.= One of the earliest materials to be used in smoke clouds\r\nwas phosphorus. This is prepared on a commercial scale by heating\r\nphosphate rock (which contains calcium phosphate) with sand and coke\r\nin an electric furnace. Phosphorus occurs in two forms, white and red.\r\n_White phosphorus_, which is formed when the vapor of the substance\r\nis quickly cooled, is, in the pure state, almost colorless, melts at\r\n44° C., boils at 287° C., is readily soluble in various solvents, and\r\nis luminous in the air, at the same time emitting fumes (the oxidation\r\nproduct, phosphorus pentoxide). On gentle warming in the air, it takes\r\nfire and burns with a brightly luminous flame. _Red phosphorus_ is\r\nobtained by heating white phosphorus out of contact with the air, to a\r\ntemperature of 250° to 300° C. Red crusts then separate out from the\r\ncolorless liquid phosphorus, and almost the entire amount is gradually\r\nconverted into a red, solid mass. If this is freed by suitable solvents\r\nfrom the small amounts of unchanged white phosphorus, a dark red powder\r\nis obtained, which remains unchanged for a long time in the air, does\r\nnot appreciably dissolve in the solvents for white phosphorus, does\r\nnot become luminous, and can be heated to a fairly high temperature\r\nwithout igniting. Further, red phosphorus is not poisonous, while white\r\nphosphorus is highly so.\r\n\r\nEither form burns to phosphorus pentoxide, which is converted by the\r\nmoisture of the air to phosphoric acid,\r\n\r\n        4P + 5O₂ = 2 P₂O₅\r\n    2P₂O₅ + 6H₂O = 4H₃PO₄\r\n\r\nSince one pound of phosphorus takes up 1.33 pounds of oxygen and 0.9\r\npound of water, it is not surprising that phosphorus is one of the best\r\nsmoke producers per pound of material. Comparison of the value of the\r\ntwo forms for shell purposes have invariably pointed to the superiority\r\nof the white variety.\r\n\r\nIn addition to its use as a smoke producer, it is used in incendiary\r\nshell and in tracer bullets. For incendiary purposes a mixture of red\r\nand white phosphorus is superior.\r\n\r\n=Chlorosulfonic Acid.= Chlorosulfonic acid, ClSO₂OH, was first\r\nemployed by the Germans to produce white clouds, both on land and on\r\nsea. For this purpose, they sprayed or dropped it onto quicklime, the\r\nreaction between it and the lime furnishing the heat necessary for\r\nvolatilization, though in this way about 30 per cent of the acid is\r\nwasted.\r\n\r\nChlorosulfonic acid is obtained from sulfur trioxide and hydrogen\r\nchloride, which combine when gently heated:\r\n\r\n    SO₃ + HCl = ClSO₂OH\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 86.—75 mm. White Phosphorus Shell. 2 seconds after\r\nbursting.]\r\n\r\nOn a commercial scale, hydrogen chloride is passed into 20 per cent\r\noleum, until saturation is reached. This is heated in a nitric acid\r\nstill, when the chlorosulfonic acid distills over between 150°-160° C.\r\nWith 30 per cent oleum, the conversion factor is about 42 per cent. The\r\nresidue in the still is about 98 per cent sulfuric acid.\r\n\r\nIt forms a colorless liquid, boiling at 152° C., and having a density\r\nof 1.7.\r\n\r\nChlorosulfonic acid fumes in the air, because reaction with water forms\r\nsulfuric acid and hydrochloric acid.\r\n\r\n    ClSO₂OH + H₂O = H₂SO₄ + HCl\r\n\r\nThis material was not used by the United States since oleum was found\r\nsuperior.\r\n\r\n=Oleum.= Oleum is a solution of 20 to 30 per cent sulfur trioxide\r\n(SO₃) in concentrated sulfuric acid. It has been used by the Germans\r\nto produce clouds on land and sea, by its contact with quicklime, and\r\nby the Americans for screening tanks and aeroplanes. Sulfur trioxide\r\nhas been found to be superior as a shell filling. It is believed that\r\nthe smoke producing power of oleum is due solely to its sulfur trioxide\r\ncontent, the sulfuric acid itself acting only as a solvent. The rather\r\nhigh freezing point of the oleum containing high percentages of sulfur\r\ntrioxide is a disadvantage.\r\n\r\n=Sulfur Trioxide.= Sulfur trioxide, SO₃, is a colorless mobile liquid,\r\nwhich boils at 46° C. and solidifies to a transparent ice-like mass,\r\nmelting at 15° C. It is prepared by passing a mixture of sulfur dioxide\r\nand oxygen over finely divided platinum or other catalysts at a\r\ntemperature between 400 and 450° C. Sulfur trioxide can only be used as\r\na filler for shell and bombs, and is probably the best substitute for\r\nphosphorus.\r\n\r\n=Tin Tetrachloride.= Tin tetrachloride, SnCl₄, is obtained by the\r\naction of chlorine on metallic tin. It is a liquid, boiling at 114° C.,\r\nand having a density of 2.2. It fumes in the air, because it hydrolyzes\r\nto stannic hydroxide:\r\n\r\n    SnCl₄ + H₂O = Sn(OH)₄ + 4 HCl\r\n\r\nIt makes a better and more irritating smoke for shell and hand\r\ngrenades, than either silicon or titanium tetrachlorides. Since there\r\nis practically no tin in this country, the other tetrachlorides were\r\ndeveloped as substitutes.\r\n\r\n=Silicon Tetrachloride.= Silicon tetrachloride, SiCl₄, is prepared from\r\nsilicon or from impure silicon carbide by heating it with chlorine in\r\nan electric furnace. The raw material (silicon carbide) is a by-product\r\nin the manufacture of carborundum. It is a colorless liquid, boiling at\r\nabout 58° C., and fumes in moist air, owing to hydrolysis:\r\n\r\n    SiCl₄ + 4 H₂O = Si(OH)₄ + 4 HCl\r\n\r\nIt is not very valuable in shell, though it is more effective on moist,\r\ncool days than on warm, dry ones. Its greatest use is found in the\r\nsmoke cylinder, combined with ammonia. By the action of the moisture of\r\nthe air, the following reaction takes place:\r\n\r\n    SiCl₄ + 4 NH₃ + 4 H₂O = Si(OH)₄ + 4NH₄Cl\r\n\r\nThe addition of a lachrymator gives a mixture which works well in hand\r\ngrenades for mopping up trenches.\r\n\r\n=Titanium Tetrachloride.= Titanium tetrachloride, TiCl₄, is made from\r\nrutile, TiO₂, by mixing with 30 per cent carbon and heating in an\r\nelectric furnace. A carbonitride is formed, which is said to have the\r\ncomposition Ti₅C₄N₄, but the actual composition may vary from this to\r\nthe carbide TiC. This product is heated to 600-650° C., and chlorine\r\npassed through, giving the tetrachloride. It is a colorless, highly\r\nrefractive liquid, which boils at about 136° C., is stable in dry air\r\nand fumes in moist air. The best smoke is produced by using 5 parts of\r\nwater to one of the tetrachloride, instead of the theoretical 4 parts\r\n[which would form Ti(OH)₄.] Since it is more expensive to manufacture\r\nand not as effective as silicon or tin tetrachloride, it is used only\r\nas an emergency material.\r\n\r\n=Berger Mixture.= One of the most important smoke materials was the\r\nzinc-containing mixture, which was used in the smoke box, the smoke\r\ncandle, certain of the smoke grenades and in various forms of colored\r\nsmokes. The basis of this was the _Berger Mixture_, which had the\r\ncomposition:\r\n\r\n    Zinc                   25\r\n    Carbon tetrachloride   50\r\n    Zinc oxide             20\r\n    Kieselguhr              5\r\n\r\nThis formula produced a light gray carbon smoke, with much carbon in\r\nthe residue. In this mixture the zinc and carbon tetrachloride react to\r\nform zinc chloride and carbon; the kieselguhr keeps the mixture solid\r\nby absorbing the tetrachloride, while the zinc oxide is practically\r\nuseless, as its absorbing power is small.\r\n\r\nIn order to accelerate the reaction and to oxidize the carbon, thereby\r\nchanging the color of the smoke from gray to white, an oxidizing\r\nagent was added. Sodium chlorate was chosen for economic reasons. The\r\nreaction now proved to be too violent, and the zinc oxide was replaced\r\nby ammonium chloride. This cooled the smoke, retarded the rate of\r\nburning and added to the density of the smoke, since the obscuring\r\npower of the ammonium chloride is high. The kieselguhr was replaced by\r\nprecipitated magnesium carbonate, which is as good an absorbent, gives\r\na much smoother burning mixture, and also adds somewhat to the density\r\nof the smoke by virtue of the magnesium mechanically expelled. The\r\nmixture then had the composition:\r\n\r\n    Zinc                    34.6\r\n    Carbon tetrachloride    40.8\r\n    Sodium chlorate          9.3\r\n    Ammonium chloride        7.0\r\n    Magnesium carbonate      8.3\r\n\r\n\r\nSIZE OF SMOKE PARTICLES\r\n\r\nIn the problem of smoke production, the size of the particle is of\r\ngreat importance. Being a physical quantity it can easily be correlated\r\nwith such physical properties as settling, diffusion, coagulation, and\r\nevaporation. These factors are more important in connection with toxic\r\nsmokes, since there the penetration factor must be considered.\r\n\r\nSmoke appears to consist of particles of all sizes from 10⁻³ cm.,\r\nwhich may just be resolved by the unaided eye, to molecular\r\ndimensions, 10⁻⁸ cm. The larger particles settle out most rapidly and\r\nso do not remain long in suspension.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEASUREMENT\r\n\r\nWells and Gerke have developed a form of ultra-microscope which is\r\nwell adapted to the measurement of the size of smoke particles. The\r\nultra-microscope is a low power microscope using intense dark ground\r\nillumination for viewing particles which are too small to be seen\r\nby transmitted light. They are rendered visible in this way, since\r\nany object, no matter how small, which emits enough light to affect\r\nthe retina is visible, provided the background is sufficiently dark.\r\nThus stars are visible at night and dust particles are easily seen\r\nin a sunbeam in a darkened room. The larger particles, viewed in\r\nthis way, do not appear larger but brighter. The apparent size of\r\nthe particles is determined by the diffraction pattern and is thus\r\ndependent only on the optical system used to view them. The more\r\nintense the incident light, the brighter the particles appear. In the\r\nultra-microscope described, the image of an intense source, such as a\r\nconcentrated filament lamp, or an arc, is focused upon the particles in\r\nthe microscopic field, but the axis of the illuminating beam, instead\r\nof coinciding with the axis of the microscope, as ordinarily used,\r\nis perpendicular to it. The beam itself, therefore, never enters the\r\nmicroscope at all, but passes under the objective into a blackened\r\nchamber where it is absorbed. The field of the microscope is made dark\r\nby placing underneath the objective another “black hole” or blackened\r\nchamber with an opening just a little larger than the field.[34]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: This ultra-microscope is described in _J. Am. Chem. Soc._\r\n=41=, 312 (1919).]\r\n\r\nThe method used for measuring the velocity consisted in causing the\r\nparticle to describe a definite stroke many times in succession in an\r\nelectric field. This was accomplished by reversing the direction of the\r\nfield with a rotating commutator. The convection due to the source of\r\nlight is perpendicular to this motion so that a zigzag line is obtained\r\n(see Fig. 88). The amplitude of this oscillation is an accurate measure\r\nof the distance traversed by the particle under the electric force for\r\na definite small interval of time. The speed of the rotating commutator\r\nand the electric field are both susceptible of precise measurement, so\r\nthat the size of a single particle is precisely determined.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 87.—Ultramicroscope for Measuring Size of Smoke\r\nParticles.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 88.—Measurement of Smoke Particles by Use of\r\nUltramicroscope.]\r\n\r\nWhen a sample of smoke is viewed in the ultra-microscope, it appears\r\nlike the starry heavens, except that the stars are dancing violently\r\nabout. At first little distinction is made between the particles, as\r\nthere seems to be no order in their motion, but soon it becomes evident\r\nthat the brighter particles are more sluggish than the dim ones. This\r\nis due to the greater mass of the bright particles, for they are\r\nlarger. The particles are all moving slowly away from the source of\r\nlight and eventually diffuse to the walls of the cell.\r\n\r\nWhen the electric field is turned on, about one-third of the particles\r\nimmediately migrate, about equally in both directions, to the two\r\nelectrodes. If the field is reversed, the direction of migration\r\nis reversed and if the commutator is used the particles oscillate\r\nregularly. Sometimes the particles may be seen to combine and become\r\nneutral, in which case oscillation ceases.\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCENTRATION OF SMOKE\r\n\r\nIn measuring the concentration of smokes, the following terms are\r\nuseful:\r\n\r\n=Density.= The density of a smoke is defined as the reciprocal of the\r\nthickness of the smoke layer in feet necessary to obscure a given\r\nfilament. Thus six inches of a smoke of density 2.0 is required to\r\nobscure an electric light filament, whereas one requiring four feet\r\nwould have a density of 4. Another way to show the significance of this\r\ndefinition is to point out that if a definite weight of a stable smoke\r\nis diluted with air after it is formed, the product of the volume by\r\nthe density always remains constant. Any marked variation in this rule\r\nmay be taken as evidence that the particles of smoke are undergoing a\r\nchange, in most cases due to evaporation.\r\n\r\n=Total Obscuring Power.= The volume of smoke produced per unit weight\r\nof material used is the second factor in determining the value of a\r\nsmoke. The product of this volume per unit weight by the density of the\r\nsmoke is the real measure of effectiveness, and is called the total\r\nobscuring power (T. O. P.) of the smoke. If the volume is expressed in\r\ncubic feet per pound and the density in reciprocal feet, the unit of T.\r\nO. P. is square feet per pound. That is, it expresses the square feet\r\nof a smoke wall, thick enough to completely obscure a light filament\r\nbehind it, which could be produced from a pound of the reacting\r\nsubstances. The total obscuring power of some typical smokes are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n    Phosphorus                   4600\r\n    NH₄Cl(NH₃ + HCl)             2500\r\n    SnCl₄ + NH₃ + H₂O            1590\r\n    Berger Mixture               1250\r\n    SnCl₄ + NH₃                   900\r\n    SO₂ + NH₃                     375\r\n\r\nIn all measurements of density, and therefore of T. O. P., the _rate\r\nof burning_ must be considered. If a slow burning material be compared\r\nwith a rapid one, the former will not reach its true maximum density,\r\nas a great deal of the smoke may settle out during the time of burning.\r\nComparisons of T. O. P. are significant only when made on smoke\r\nmixtures of the same type and in about the same quantities.\r\n\r\n\r\nMEASUREMENT\r\n\r\nTwo methods of measuring the effectiveness of a smoke cloud have\r\nbeen devised, one, the smoke box, which measures the obscuring power\r\ndirectly by observing at what distance a lamp filament is obscured by\r\nintervening smoke, the other, the Tyndall meter, which measures the\r\nintensity of the scattering of the light.\r\n\r\nThe earliest measurements of smoke intensity are perhaps those of\r\nRingelmann (_Revue Technique_, =19=, 286), who devised the well known\r\nchart of that name, intended mainly for measuring intensities of black\r\nsmoke issuing from a chimney at a distance. The first measurements\r\nfor military purposes are probably due to Bertrand, who made numerous\r\ncomparative studies with his “salle opacimetrique.” This was a room\r\n23 × 14 × 3.6 meters, with 7 windows. Two doors, one provided with\r\n3 oculars 2 cm. in diameter, gave access to the room. On the other\r\ndoor, opposite the first, were hung several black signs. Six pairs\r\nof columns were spaced along the room at measured distances. When a\r\nsmoke is produced in the room, the black paper signs first become\r\ninvisible, then the door itself, and finally the columns, pair by\r\npair. They reappear in the reverse order, and as a measure of relative\r\nopacity Bertrand took the time elapsing between the detonation and the\r\nreappearance of the farther door.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 89.—Tyndall Meter.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 90.—Cottrell Precipitation Tube.]\r\n\r\n=Smoke Box.= The smoke box, used by the C. W. S., was constructed of\r\nwood with tight joints, and had a moveable brass rod running through it\r\nto which was attached a small size 25-Watt Mazda lamp. The density of\r\neach smoke introduced in the box is determined by moving this lamp back\r\nand forth until a point is reached when the pattern of the filament\r\ncan just be distinguished by the observer looking in at the glass\r\nwindow, external light being excluded by a black cloth. The thickness\r\nof the smoke layer between the glass window and the light is recorded\r\nas the measure of the smoke density. For field tests, a larger box, 6\r\n× 8 × 8 feet (288 cubic feet) was constructed. The observation light\r\nwas moveable in a line connecting the mid-points of opposite sides of\r\nthe box. To insure uniform distribution of smoke, a fan with 18-inch\r\nblade revolved at any desired speed between 60 and 250 r.p.m. With\r\nthis, results are obtained indicating both the original density and its\r\nstability.\r\n\r\n=Tyndall Meter.= The Tyndall meter was first devised for studying\r\nsmokes and mists. Tolman and Vliet adapted it to Chemical Warfare\r\npurposes, and used it in studying the properties of smokes.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus (Fig. 89) consists eventually of an electric light bulb,\r\na condensing lens giving a beam of parallel light which passes through\r\nthe diaphragm, and a Macbeth illuminometer for measuring the strength\r\nof the Tyndall beam. In case the material is a liquid suspension or\r\nsolution, it is introduced into a cylindrical glass tube, while smokes\r\nand mists are premixed directly through the apparatus. The long closed\r\ntubes are provided, respectively, for absorbing the beam after it has\r\npassed through the disperse system and for giving a dark background for\r\nobserving the Tyndall beam. Methods of standardization are given in the\r\n_Journal of the American Chemical Society_, =41=, 299.\r\n\r\nA third method for analyzing smokes consists in the use of an\r\nelectrical precipitator. This apparatus consists essentially of\r\na modified Cottrell Precipitator, with a central wire as cathode\r\nsurrounded by a cylindrical foil as anode (Fig. 90). The smoke to\r\nbe analyzed is drawn through the apparatus at a known rate, and the\r\nparticles of smoke precipitated on the foil by means of a high voltage,\r\ndirect current. The determination of concentration is made by weighing\r\nthe foil before and after precipitation.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPARATUS FOR SMOKE PRODUCTION\r\n\r\n\r\nSMOKE BOX\r\n\r\nThe smoke box was developed for the Navy for use when it was desirable\r\nto have the smoke screen generated away from the ship. (The smoke\r\nfunnel, described later, was operated on board ship). The float\r\nconsists of an iron container (holding the smoke mixture) surrounded\r\nby an iron float to support the apparatus when it is thrown into the\r\nwater (Fig. 91). The iron container consists of a cylinder 22 inches\r\nhigh and 10 inches in diameter. One inch holes are bored 1½ inches\r\nfrom the top of this cylinder, from which the smoke is emitted. The\r\niron float is about 2 feet in diameter and 8 inches deep. This box\r\nholds approximately 100 pounds of smoke mixture, and is so constructed\r\nthat it will float one hour. When ignited, the mixture burns 9 to 9½\r\nminutes. The smoke produced has a T. O. P. of about 1900. Fig. 92 shows\r\nthe Navy Smoke Box in action.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 91.—Navy Smoke Box.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 92.—Navy Smoke Box in Action.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSMOKE CANDLE\r\n\r\nSmoke candles are used for producing a cloud of smoke for screening\r\npurposes in or behind the lines. They are made by packing about\r\nthree pounds of the modified Berger Mixture in a container (Fig. 93)\r\n(galvanized can 5¼ inches by 3½ inches) and are lighted by means of the\r\nmatch head type of ignition. Smoke is given off at a uniform rate for\r\nabout 4 minutes, forming a dense, fog-like cloud which hangs low (Fig.\r\n94). This smoke is absolutely harmless, and can be breathed without\r\ndiscomfort. The obscuring power is high and, with a favorable wind, a\r\nsmall number of the candles will produce a screen sufficiently dense to\r\nallow operations to be carried out unseen by the enemy.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 93.—B. M. Smoke Candle.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSMOKE GRENADE\r\n\r\nThe smoke grenade is also designed for use in trench and field warfare,\r\nwhere it is desired to produce a dense smoke screen. It is made by\r\npacking 340 grams of the standard smoke mixture in an ordinary light\r\nmetal gas grenade. Around the top of the grenade are vents closed by\r\na zinc strip. The ignition is caused by the standard bouchon when the\r\ngrenade is thrown. The heat of the reaction burns through the zinc\r\nstrip and a dense cloud of smoke is evolved for 45 seconds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 94.—Smoke Cloud from B. M. Candle.]\r\n\r\nStannic chloride has also been used extensively in hand grenades, as\r\nit gives a very disagreeable cloud of smoke upon detonation. Due to\r\nthe high prices and urgent need of tin for other purposes, silicon\r\ntetrachloride was substituted for tin tetrachloride towards the close\r\nof the war. A mixture of silicon tetrachloride and chloropicrin was\r\nalso used. This not only gives a very good smoke cloud, but combines\r\nwith it the toxic properties of the chloropicrin cloud.\r\n\r\nThe method of firing the smoke grenade is the same as that of any\r\ngrenade using the same type of bouchon. Usually the grenade is grasped\r\nin the hand for throwing in such a manner that the handle of the\r\nbouchon is under the fingers. The safety clip is pulled out with the\r\nother hand and the grenade is thrown with an overhand motion. When the\r\ngrenade leaves the hand, the handle of the bouchon flies off, allowing\r\nthe trigger to hit the cap which ignites the fuse.\r\n\r\nThe white phosphorus combined hand and rifle grenade became the\r\nstandard smoke grenade by the end of the war. Stannic chloride was used\r\nto clear out dugouts, but not as a smoke producer.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTOKES’ SMOKE SHELL\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 95.—Stokes’ Smoke Shell.]\r\n\r\nThe Stokes’ smoke shell was perfected to furnish a means of maintaining\r\nthe best possible smoke screen at long ranges by means of an easily\r\nportable gun. The 3-inch Stokes shell, as adapted for combustion\r\nsmokes, weighs about 13 pounds and contains about 4 pounds of standard\r\nsmoke mixture. This shell is designed to produce a continuous screen\r\nover a period of 3 to 4 minutes.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIVENS SMOKE DRUM\r\n\r\nThe Livens smoke drum was designed for use with the 8-inch Livens\r\nprojector, so as to produce a smoke screen of large volume and long\r\nduration at long ranges. The drum, as adapted for combustion smokes,\r\nweighs 17.5 pounds empty and 49 pounds loaded. The smoke-gas mixture\r\nwas specially adapted for use in the Livens drum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 96.—Livens Smoke Bomb.]\r\n\r\nSmoke mixtures in Livens were never used to any considerable extent\r\nin the war and it is questionable if they ever will be. A Livens can\r\nusually only be fired once before resetting, hence Stokes mortars are\r\nused whenever possible.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMOKE FUNNEL\r\n\r\nThe smoke funnel was developed for the production of a white smoke\r\ncloud from the stern of a vessel. The smoke producing materials are\r\nliquid ammonia and silicon tetrachloride, with carbon dioxide as a\r\ncompressing medium. This is the most satisfactory compressing medium,\r\nbecause: (1) The silicon tetrachloride is forced out at nearly constant\r\npressure. (2) The carbon dioxide is easily compressed to a liquid and\r\ncan be handled in this form. Further, it has a vapor pressure of 800\r\npounds at 60° F., and a cylinder can be nearly emptied without loss\r\nin efficiency. (3) Carbon dioxide is sufficiently soluble in silicon\r\ntetrachloride to cause the latter to effervesce and thus materially aid\r\nin its evaporation on spraying. (4) Liquid carbon dioxide, behaving in\r\na manner similar to liquid ammonia, affords a means for the silicon\r\ntetrachloride to “keep pace” with the ammonia, under changes in\r\ntemperature, and thus ensures a more nearly neutral, and therefore the\r\nmost effective, smoke.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 97.—Navy Smoke Funnel.]\r\n\r\nThe smoke funnel proper consists of an open end cylinder, about 2 feet\r\nin diameter and 7 feet long, mounted in a horizontal position on an\r\nangle iron frame. At one end is an 18-inch fan securely fastened to the\r\ncross supports. This fan is operated by hand, through gears giving a\r\nratio of about 30 to 1. The silicon tetrachloride enters the cylinder\r\nthrough a pipe, which terminates in four spray nozzles, while the\r\nammonia enters through a single nozzle. The air forced into the funnel\r\nserves to hydrolyze the silicon tetrachloride and mixes the vapors. The\r\nresulting reaction evolves a dense white cloud of very large volume and\r\nhigh obscuring power. One set of cylinders is capable of maintaining\r\nthis cloud for over 30 minutes. Under normal conditions the discharge\r\nis at the rate of 2 pounds of silicon tetrachloride to 1 pound of\r\nammonia. To stop the smoke, the silicon tetrachloride is closed first,\r\nthe ammonia allowed to run about half a minute, and the fan is shut off\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 98.—Navy Smoke Funnel in Operation.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSMOKE KNAPSACK\r\n\r\nThe smoke knapsack furnishes a portable apparatus for smoke production.\r\nThe gross weight is about 70 pounds; when in operation it gives a dense\r\nwhite smoke for about 15 minutes. The operation may be intermittent\r\nor continuous and the quantity of smoke is sufficient to completely\r\nhide one platoon of men in skirmish formation with a 5-mile per hour\r\nenfilade wind. The apparatus consists of two steel tanks about 26\r\ninches in height and 6 inches in diameter. From the side of each tank,\r\nbut near the bottom, extends a short pipe on which is placed a suitable\r\nvalve. A flexible armored hose connects the valve to a short length of\r\npipe which is equipped with spray nozzle. The cylinders are charged\r\nwith silicon tetrachloride and ammonia under pressure. The valves may\r\nbe operated with the left hand, while the sprayer apparatus is held in\r\nthe right. The release buckles are within easy reach of both hands.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHELL\r\n\r\nWhile many special devices have been developed by means of which the\r\ngas troops and infantry are able to set up smoke clouds on short\r\nnotice, the smoke shell, fired by the artillery, always played an\r\nimportant part in this work. In the same way that a large number of the\r\npoison gases were adapted to artillery use, so were most of the smoke\r\nproducing substances.\r\n\r\nAs a filler for smoke shell, phosphorus easily ranks first, and is\r\napproached only by sulfur trioxide in very humid weather. A rough\r\napproximation to the relative values of some of its rivals is given in\r\nthe following table:\r\n\r\n    White phosphorus      100\r\n    Sulfur trioxide        60-75\r\n    Stannic chloride       40\r\n    Titanium chloride      25-35\r\n    Arsenic chloride       10\r\n\r\nComparison of the value of different forms of phosphorus for shell\r\npurposes has invariably pointed to the superiority of the white\r\nvariety. Mixtures of white and red (2 to 1) have also proved effective.\r\n\r\nA complete barrage over a front of 200 yards can be established in from\r\n40 seconds to 1 minute and maintained by firing a salvo followed by\r\nbattery fire of 3 seconds. Four 4.5-inch howitzers could maintain an\r\neffective barrage over a front of 1000 yards. The influence of sunshine\r\nis very marked, as in moist, cool weather one shell every 15 seconds is\r\nsufficient.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 99.—Smoke Screen for Tanks.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSCREENING TANKS\r\n\r\nTests have demonstrated (see Fig. 99) that successful smoke screens for\r\ntanks may be produced by spraying oleum into the exhaust. On a 7-ton\r\ntank of the Renault type (40 H. P.) 110 cc. per minute produced a large\r\nvolume of smoke, which had excellent covering power, and which could be\r\nmade intermittent or continuous at will.\r\n\r\nThe same method may be applied to aeroplanes, and to ships. It is\r\ncalculated that a cylinder containing 300 pounds of 20 per cent oleum\r\nwill maintain a smoke screen on a ship for a period of 15 minutes,\r\nif oleum is used at the rate of 23.6 pounds per minute. Since the\r\ncylinders may be arranged in batteries, the screen may be continued\r\nfor any period of time. The Tank Corps rather favor phosphorus rifle\r\ngrenades for producing a smoke screen at a distance from the tank.\r\n\r\n\r\nPURPOSE OF SMOKE SCREEN\r\n\r\nSmoke screens may be employed with one or more of the following objects\r\nin view:\r\n\r\n(1) To mask known enemy observation posts and machine gun nests; to\r\nconceal the front and flanks of attacking troops, concentration of guns\r\nand tanks, roads and concentration points; to blind the flashes of\r\nbatteries in action and to hamper aerial observations.\r\n\r\n(2) As a feint to draw the enemy’s attention to a front on which no\r\nattack is being made, so as to hold his troops to their trenches, or to\r\ninduce him to expend ammunition needlessly and to put down a barrage in\r\nthe wrong place.\r\n\r\n(3) To simulate gas and force the enemy to wear his mask. Gas should\r\noccasionally be mixed with smoke, to impress upon him the belief that\r\nit is never safe to remain in a smoke cloud without wearing his mask.\r\n\r\n(4) In rolling or mountainous country, to fill valleys with smoke and\r\nthereby conceal the advance from all observation, including aerial.\r\n\r\n(5) To cover the construction of bridges, trenches, etc., in the face\r\nof the enemy.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TACTICAL VALUE OF SMOKE\r\n\r\nThe pall of smoke that hung over every battlefield of the Civil\r\nWar made a profound impression upon Fries when, as a boy, he first\r\nread of those battles. However, practically every reference made\r\nto smoke treated it as a nuisance. It obscured the field of vision\r\nand interfered with troop movements as well as with the aiming and\r\nfiring of rifles and cannon, though due to their short range this\r\nwas not so serious as it would be nowadays. Nevertheless so deeply\r\nwas this interference appreciated that the most earnest efforts were\r\nmade to discover a smokeless powder. This, as the world well knows,\r\nwas developed with great efficiency during the latter part of the\r\nnineteenth century. With the development of the smokeless powders\r\ncame also a better understanding of the action of powder, whereby the\r\nvelocity of projectiles, and consequently the range and accuracy, were\r\ngreatly increased. This increased range and accuracy of guns forced a\r\nconsideration of protection,—and concealment is one form of protection.\r\n\r\nThe Navy would appear to have been the first branch of the American\r\nforces to realize how valuable a smoke screen may be. Thus Fries, in\r\nAugust, 1913, had the interesting experience of witnessing a week’s\r\nmaneuvers at the eastern entrance to Long Island Sound between the\r\nNavy and the Coast Artillery. During that week the Navy carried out\r\nextensive experiments with smoke screens both by day and by night. The\r\nsmoke in all cases was generated by smothering the fires on destroyers\r\nor other ships, thus causing dense clouds of black smoke to be given\r\nout from the funnels.\r\n\r\nAfter the World War had been in progress some time and particularly\r\nabout the time the United States entered it, a determined search was\r\nbegun for more efficient smokes and more efficient smoke producers.\r\n\r\nIn the Navy, smoke screens were expected to be established by small\r\ncraft behind which larger vessels could maneuver for position and\r\nrange. These screens were also established for the purpose of cutting\r\noff the view of enemy submarines or other vessels, thus allowing\r\nmerchant ships or even warships when injured or outclassed to escape.\r\n\r\nThe Army was much slower to appreciate the value of smoke. In fact,\r\napparently no army really realized the value of a smoke screen until\r\nafter gas warfare became an accomplished fact. As is well known, the\r\nevaporation of the large quantity of liquid used in wave attacks\r\ncaused a cloud of condensed moisture. This is what gave rise to the\r\ndesignation “cloud attack.”\r\n\r\nEnglish regulations for defense against gas in the early days called\r\nfor every man and animal to stand fast upon the approach of a gas cloud\r\nand remain quiet until the cloud had passed. Thus casualties were\r\nreduced to a minimum and the English were fresh to receive the attack\r\nthat was frequently launched immediately after the cloud had passed.\r\nThe Germans finally thought of the plan of sending over a fake gas\r\nattack. In that way they simply produced a smoke cloud that looked like\r\na gas attack. Naturally the English stood fast as before. The Germans\r\nattacking in the fake cloud naturally caught the British at a complete\r\ndisadvantage with consequent disastrous results to the latter.\r\n\r\nBut that was a game at which two could play. About this time the\r\nvalue of white phosphorus for producing a smoke screen was taken up\r\nby the British and large numbers of 4-inch Stokes mortar shells were\r\nfilled for that purpose. All armies then began to experiment with\r\nsmoke producing materials. Most of these were liquid. Of them all, as\r\nhas been stated before, white phosphorus, a solid, proved the best.\r\nToward the close of the war these smoke screens began to be used to\r\na considerable extent for the purposes given above. No one who has\r\nengaged in target practice and encountered a fog, or who has hunted\r\nducks and geese in a fog needs to be told of the difficulty of hitting\r\nan object he cannot see.\r\n\r\nThe First Gas Regiment proved its worth and won everlasting glory by\r\nusing the Stokes’ mortars of the British with their phosphorus bombs\r\nfor attacking machine gun nests. The white phosphorus in that case had\r\na double effect. It made a perfect smoke screen, thereby making the\r\nGerman machine gun shots simply shots in the dark, while at the same\r\ntime the burning phosphorus forced the gunners to abandon their guns\r\nand surrender. Thus phosphorus played and will play in the future the\r\ndouble rôle of forming a defensive screen and of viciously attacking\r\nenemy troops. This phosphorus, which catches fire spontaneously, burns\r\nwet or dry, total immersion in water alone sufficing to put it out.\r\nThis means of extinguishing the flames being almost totally absent on\r\nthe battlefield, it can be truthfully said that burning phosphorus is\r\nunquenchable. The burns are severe and difficult to heal. For these\r\nreasons white phosphorus will be used in enormous quantities in any\r\nfuture war.\r\n\r\nAll armies have begun to realize this value of smoke. In the future it\r\nwill be the infantryman’s defense against all forms of weapons and it\r\nwill be used on every field of battle, by every arm of the service and\r\nat all times, day or night. It is even more effective in shutting out\r\nthe light from searchlights, star bombs and similar illuminants for\r\nuse in night attacks than it is in daylight. With this straight use of\r\nsmoke for protection will go its use along with poisonous gases. Every\r\nsmoke cloud will be poisonous or non-poisonous at the will of the one\r\nproducing the cloud, and this will be true whether it is produced from\r\nartillery shell, mortar bombs, hand grenades, smoke candles or other\r\napparatus. Thus smoke and gas together will afford a field for the\r\nexercise of ingenuity greater than that of all other forms of warfare.\r\nThe only limitation to the use of smoke and gas will be the lack of\r\nvision of commanders and the ignorance of armies.\r\n\r\nProper recognition and aid given to chemical warfare development\r\nand instruction in peace are the only methods of overcoming these\r\nlimitations. In this, as in all other development work, the most\r\nserious obstacle comes from the man who will not see, whether it be\r\nfrom a lack of intelligence, laziness or inbred opposition to all forms\r\nof advancement.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTOXIC SMOKES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe introduction of diphenylchloroarsine as a poison gas really\r\nintroduced the question of toxic smokes. This material, as has\r\nalready been pointed out, is a solid, melting at about 30°. In order\r\nto secure efficient distribution, the material was mixed with a\r\nconsiderable amount of high explosive. When the shell burst, the\r\ndiphenylchloroarsine was finely divided or atomized and produced a\r\ncloud of toxic particles. Since smoke particles are only slightly\r\nremoved by the ordinary mask, this formed a very effective means of\r\nchemical warfare.\r\n\r\nAn analogous result was obtained by the use of poison gases, such\r\nas chloropicrin, in a smoke cloud produced from silicon or stannic\r\nchloride. Here, however, the toxic material was a real gas, and so the\r\nreal result attained consisted in forcing the men to wear their masks\r\nin all kinds of clouds. The true toxic smoke went further in that the\r\nordinary mask offered little protection and thus compelled the warring\r\nnations to develop a special type of smoke filter.\r\n\r\nThese smoke clouds consist of very small particles, which may be\r\nconsidered as a _dispersed_ phase, distributed in the air, which we may\r\ncall the _dispersing medium_. The dispersed phase may be produced by\r\n_mechanical_, _thermal_, or _chemical_ methods.\r\n\r\n_Mechanical dispersion_ consists in the tearing apart of the material\r\ninto a fine state of subdivision. It may be called a hammer and anvil\r\naction. The more powerful the mechanical force, the smaller the\r\nresulting particles. This may be accomplished by the use of a high\r\nexplosive, such as the Germans used in the case of diphenylchloroarsine.\r\n\r\nThe production of smoke by _thermal dispersion_ depends essentially\r\nupon the fact that when a substance of sufficiently low vapor pressure\r\nis volatilized, and the vapors are passed into the air, they\r\nrecondense on the nuclei of the air to form a smoke. Vaporization from\r\nan open container, permitting the vapors to pass directly to the air\r\nwithout being quickly carried away from the surface of evaporation,\r\nproduces smoke having larger particles, because each particle formed\r\nremains for an appreciable period of time in contact with air saturated\r\nwith vapor, and hence grows very rapidly.\r\n\r\nThe easiest way to produce small smoke particles is to mix the toxic\r\nmaterial directly with some fuel which will produce a large amount of\r\nheat and gas upon burning. When this mixture is enclosed in a container\r\nhaving a small orifice, upon burning, the toxic vapor and gas will pass\r\nthrough this orifice at high velocity; it has been demonstrated by Lord\r\nRayleigh that the size of the particles depends upon the velocity of\r\nemission of the gas from a given orifice.\r\n\r\nThe product of _chemical combination_ may include a super-saturated\r\nvapor, which condenses into small particles.\r\n\r\n_Explosive dispersion_ is really a combination of _mechanical\r\ndispersion_ followed by _thermal dispersion_.\r\n\r\n\r\nPENETRATION\r\n\r\nThe fundamental idea underlying all the work on toxic smokes is to\r\nobtain a smoke that has marked penetrating power. Screening power is\r\nnot important here. In addition to penetration, a smoke should be\r\nhighly toxic and have a slow rate of settling.\r\n\r\nPenetration may be tested by the use of a standard filter; a suitable\r\nfilter for this purpose is one which does not remove the smoke to such\r\nan extent that measurement of its concentration becomes difficult,\r\nand one which does not become clogged quickly by the smoke. A filter\r\nconsisting of two pads of felt, placed side by side and arranged so\r\nthat the smoke first comes in contact with the thinner and less dense\r\npad has been found very satisfactory.\r\n\r\nIn testing penetration, smoke is produced by dispersing one gram of the\r\ntoxic substance in a sheet iron box of 1000 liters capacity. After 5\r\nminutes a steady concentration is usually attained and the smoke is\r\nthen forced through a Tyndall meter, (see page 299) after dilution with\r\nair, where the initial concentration is determined. It then passes\r\nthrough the standard filter, and through a second Tyndall meter, where\r\nthe final concentration is measured. The difference of the two readings\r\ngives the amount of smoke retained by the filter. The penetration is\r\nordinarily represented by a series of figures, which decrease from a\r\nmaximum value at the beginning of the test to a minimum at a point\r\nwhere the filter permits the passage of so little smoke that it cannot\r\nbe measured. This decrease is due to decrease in penetrating power and\r\nconcentration of the smoke, and to increase in filtering power of the\r\nfilter as a result of plugging. Usually five degrees of penetration are\r\nrecognized, excellent, good, fair, poor and very poor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 100.—Penetration Apparatus Used to Test Toxic\r\nSmokes.]\r\n\r\nA portable penetration apparatus is shown in Fig. 100. In using the\r\napparatus, the smoke producing material is so placed with reference to\r\nthe apparatus that the sample is taken about 20 feet down the wind, so\r\nthat the smoke is appreciably diluted. One man is stationed at each\r\nTyndall meter and takes readings as fast as his recorder can write\r\nthem, so that the smoke density, before and after the filter, can be\r\nfollowed very closely.\r\n\r\n\r\nPHYSIOLOGICAL ACTION\r\n\r\nIn addition to a high penetrating power a smoke should also possess\r\ngreat toxic, irritant, sternutatory, or lachrymatory power. These\r\nproperties are tested by exposing mice to the smoke in the chamber.\r\nThey are placed in the chamber at the beginning of the run, and exposed\r\nfor 10 minutes to the smoke from 1 gram of the material. While these\r\ntests are only qualitative in character, they give a fairly good notion\r\nof the relative value of different materials.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUANTITATIVE RELATIONSHIPS\r\n\r\nIt has been found that, if the optical readings from the Tyndall meter\r\nare plotted as ordinates against the time _t_ (the time elapsed after\r\ndetonation) as abcissas, and that portion of the curve between _t_ =\r\n0 and _t_ = 30 considered, the curve generally descends sharply at\r\nfirst, from a high point representing the density immediately after the\r\nproduction of the smoke, to a point in the neighborhood of _t_ = 8,\r\nwhere it flattens out and descends much more slowly with a slope that\r\nchanges little. The area under the significant portion of the curve,\r\nthat is, the area circumscribed by the curve from the point _t_₃₀ to\r\n_t_₀, the vertical axis from this point to the origin, the horizontal\r\naxis from the origin to _t_₃₀ and the line perpendicular to this\r\naxis, cutting the curve at _t_₃₀, is a rough measure of the relative\r\nvalues of different smokes. This area is calculated as the sum of two\r\nrectangles, from _t_₀ to _t_₈ and from _t_₈ to _t_₃₀.\r\n\r\nSome results are as follows:\r\n\r\n                                Area 30\r\n    Phenyldichloroarsine          181\r\n    Triphenyldichloroarsine       178\r\n    Diphenylcyanoarsine           137\r\n    Diphenylchloroarsine          101\r\n    Cyanogen bromide               94\r\n    Methyl dichloroarsine          70\r\n    Phenylimidophosgene            69\r\n    Mustard gas                    38\r\n\r\nThe curves in Fig. 101 show the way in which the readings fall off with\r\ntime. Each substance of course has its characteristic curves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 101.—Typical Curves Showing the Decrease in\r\nConcentration of Smoke Cloud with Time.]\r\n\r\n\r\nTOXIC MATERIALS\r\n\r\nThe selection of materials for the production of toxic smokes can only\r\nbe carried out experimentally. A number of very toxic substances have\r\nbeen shown to be valueless as toxic smokes because of low penetration,\r\ndecomposition during the process of smoke production, or for other\r\nreasons.\r\n\r\nArsenic compounds produce smokes distinctly better than the average.\r\nInorganic compounds which have high melting and boiling points are very\r\npoor smoke producers. The only exception to this is magnesium arsenide,\r\nwhich may suffer decomposition. Compounds like mercuric chloride\r\nand arsenic tribromide, which boil or sublime at comparatively low\r\ntemperatures, produce good smokes. Most materials which boil below 130°\r\nC. produce no smoke as they evaporate on dispersion. It is difficult\r\nto set any upper limit for the boiling point beyond which materials do\r\nnot produce good smokes, but in all probability 500° C. is not far from\r\nthe maximum. Liquids and solids are, on the whole, almost equally good\r\nas smoke producers. The physical condition of the material has no great\r\neffect upon the amount of smoke which it will produce. This seems to\r\ndepend only upon the physical and chemical properties of the material.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOXIC SMOKE APPARATUS\r\n\r\nIt has been mentioned above that the Germans used a shell, containing\r\nsolid diphenylchloroarsine and a high explosive. A 10.5 cm. shell\r\n(Blue Cross) was about two-thirds filled with cast trinitrotoluene\r\nand contained a glass bottle with 300-400 grams of toxic material.\r\nDiphenylchloroarsine was also used in shell, in solution, a mixture of\r\nphosgene and diphosgene (superpalite) being the ordinary solvent (Green\r\nCross). Mixtures of diphenylchloroarsine and phenyldichloroarsine were\r\nalso used.\r\n\r\nIn the case of high explosive shell, the use of a separate container\r\nappears to be desirable, because a mixture with the explosive seriously\r\ndecreases its sensitiveness and even its destructive power. There is\r\nalso a question as to the stability of such a mixture. However, 75 mm.\r\nshell containing 30 per cent diphenylchloroarsine mixed with T. N. T.\r\ngave good clouds of toxic smoke.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOXIC SMOKE CANDLE\r\n\r\nTwo toxic smoke candles were developed by the Chemical Warfare Service,\r\nknown as the B-M Toxic Smoke Candle, perfected by the Pyrotechnic\r\nSection of the Research Division, and the Dispersoid Smoke Candle,\r\ndeveloped by the Dispersoid Section.\r\n\r\nThe B-M Toxic Smoke Candle consists of a bottle-shaped sheet steel\r\ntoxic container set into a can, containing smoke mixture. The heat from\r\nthe burning mixture causes the distillation of the toxic material.\r\nThe toxic vapor is discharged through a nipple, screwed into the neck\r\nof the container and extending over the top of the smoke can. Steel\r\nwool is used in the toxic container to reduce the violent boiling and\r\nspattering of the material. A small amount of steel wool, held in place\r\nby a wire screen, is also used in the nipple for the same purpose. The\r\ntoxic container is sealed by a fusible metal plug, melting at 90° C.,\r\ncast into a retainer at the base of the nipple. The fusible plug melts\r\nupon the first application of heat and allows free passage of the vapor\r\ninto the smoke cloud. The ignition of the apparatus is effected by\r\nmeans of a simple match head and an accompanying scratcher.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 102.—Toxic Smoke Cloud from 500 D. M. Candles.]\r\n\r\n    The candles were placed in 5 parallel rows which were\r\n        2 yards apart, each row containing 100 candles on\r\n        a 100 yard front. The total time of active smoke\r\n        emission was 23 minutes.\r\n\r\nThe first evolution of smoke occurs about 10 seconds after the first\r\nappearance of flame. About one minute after ignition the toxic\r\nmaterial will begin to distill into the smoke cloud and this will\r\ncontinue for about four minutes. The burning of the candle should be\r\ncomplete in about six minutes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Dispersoid Candle British Candle\r\n\r\nFIG. 103.—Comparison of Dispersoid and British D. M. Candles.]\r\n\r\nThe Dispersoid Toxic Smoke Candle differs from the B-M candle in that\r\nthe toxic container is not used. A mixture of smokeless powder and the\r\ntoxic material (diphenylchloroarsine or D. M., an arsenical obtained\r\nfrom arsenic trichloride and diphenylamine) is filled directly into\r\nthe container, a cylindrical can 3.5 inches in diameter and 9 inches\r\nhigh made from 27 gauge sheet metal, and packed under a total pressure\r\nof 2,500 pounds. The top of the candle is a metal cover, containing\r\nthe match head scratcher, which is separated from the match head by a\r\nManila paper disc. These are the same as those used in the B-M candle.\r\nThe candle has a total weight of about 4.25 pounds, of which 3.6 pounds\r\nare the smoke mixture, containing about 1.3 pounds of toxic material.\r\n\r\nIn operating the candles, the cover is removed and the match head\r\nignited by friction with the scratcher. The match head burns through\r\nthe cardboard and ignites the powder. The heat and gas produced by the\r\ncombustion of the powder vaporizes the particles of the toxic material\r\nand carries the vapors out through the orifices at a high velocity\r\nwhereupon they recondense to form a smoke. The rapid emission of the\r\nvapors through the orifice prevents any possibility of their ignition.\r\n\r\nThe time before good emission of smoke takes place after the ignition\r\nof the match tip of a candle is 30 seconds. The average time of\r\nvigorous smoke emission is from four to five minutes. The result\r\nof a field test with the dispersoid candle is shown in Fig. 102. A\r\ncomparison of a British and a Dispersoid candle is shown in Fig. 103.\r\nIt should be stated that this may not have been a fair test as only one\r\nBritish candle was available for the comparative test.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nSMOKE FILTERS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first types of the Standard Box Respirator contained cotton pads,\r\nwhich sufficed to remove the ordinary smoke of the battlefield and even\r\nthat from the earlier toxic materials. Improved methods of producing\r\ntoxic smokes, by means of which smaller particles were obtained, led,\r\nearly in 1918, to the recognition of the need of improved protection\r\nagainst these smokes. The first attempts to meet this need consisted\r\nin improving the filtering qualities of these pads. It was soon found,\r\nhowever, that to make better filter pads would greatly increase the\r\ntotal resistance of the canister. This was highly undesirable, since\r\nthe resistance of the ordinary canister was already so high as to be\r\nvery uncomfortable. To overcome this objection, some of the early\r\ndesigns of filter canisters were provided with a mechanical valve,\r\nwhich could be operated by hand, to by-pass the air around the filter\r\nwhen the canister was used against gas alone, or so set as to make the\r\nair pass through the filter when smoke was feared. This introduced a\r\nfactor of uncertainty among the men during a gas attack, since each man\r\nmust decide for himself whether smoke was present. This reason alone\r\nwas sufficient for discarding this design.\r\n\r\nA preliminary study of the situation indicated that any filter for fine\r\nsmoke particles must have a high resistance per unit of area, but that\r\nthe total resistance must be comparatively low. In order to secure\r\nthe large area necessary to bring the total resistance within reason,\r\nthe experimental work was developed along three lines: The formation\r\nof a filter into a bag, cup, or jacket to surround the outside of\r\nthe canister; the use of an arrangement sufficiently compact to go\r\ninside the canister; and the use of a filter as a separate unit, to be\r\nattached to the canister by an air connection.\r\n\r\nA survey of the possible filtering materials indicated that only two\r\noffered promise, namely, paper and felt.\r\n\r\n\r\nPAPER FILTERS\r\n\r\nReports that the British had developed thin, creped, sulfite-cellulose\r\nwood pulp paper for filters led to an intensive study of this material\r\nby the Chemical Warfare Service.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 104.—Crepe Paper Doughnut Filter Canister.]\r\n\r\nIn general we may say that the development of paper filters (in sheet\r\nform) met with little success. Papers affording the required protection\r\ndid not live up to the resistance specifications. The reason for this\r\nprobably is in the method of making paper. The pulp is fed onto the\r\nscreen of a Fourdrinier machine under conditions that do not permit of\r\nuniformity in the distribution of the fibers and consequently there is\r\nno uniformity in the size of pores. In order to eliminate the large\r\nholes, which allow the smoke to pass readily, the paper must be pressed\r\nto reduce these pores to the proper magnitude. This naturally results\r\nin an approximately equal decrease in the size of the small pores, with\r\na consequent increase in the final resistance out of all proportion to\r\nthe protection gained. A very satisfactory paper was finally produced,\r\nbut the resistance was too high and it was necessary to increase the\r\ntotal available filtering area, which resulted in the accordion type\r\nof filter. This filter was incapable of development on a large scale\r\nbecause of the large amount of hand work required in assembling. The\r\nlack of uniformity in a single sheet has been overcome with some\r\nsuccess by making up a filter from 40 to 80 layers of tissue or crepe\r\npaper, trusting that the law of chance would bring the large pores in\r\nsome successive layer. Such a filter was adopted by the British, but\r\nsince it did not give protection comparable with that afforded by felt\r\nfilters, it was rejected in the United States.\r\n\r\nIn the so-called “doughnut” filter use was made of tissue paper.\r\nInstead of seeking for uniformity in a vertical direction through a\r\nblock of tissues, it was sought along the axis horizontal with the\r\nsheet. The effectiveness of such a filter was less than that of felt.\r\nIn addition, serious difficulty was met in cutting the pile of tissue\r\npaper into the proper shape so that eventually it was abandoned as a\r\nproduction possibility.\r\n\r\n\r\nFELT FILTERS\r\n\r\nWork on the felt filters started about June, 1918. Great difficulties\r\nwere met in the beginning, as a felt satisfactory for this purpose must\r\nbe made under carefully controlled conditions and production conditions\r\nduring the war did not readily lend themselves to such control.\r\nHowever, the opportunities afforded in felt making for uniform packing\r\nand arranging of the fibers (the whole process of making a felt, is\r\none of gradual packing of fibers into a relatively small volume) are\r\nsuch as to assure a greater degree of success than is the case in paper\r\nmaking.\r\n\r\nVery successful filters have been obtained with the use of felt. There\r\nare two serious objections to its use, however. The first is the\r\ngreat cost of the filter (this was above one dollar per filter at the\r\nclose of the War); the second is that felt is a valuable industrial\r\ncommodity. It is thus very desirable that a cheaper and a less\r\nimportant industrial material be found.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE 1919 CANISTER\r\n\r\nJust before the Armistice, the Gas Defense Long Island Laboratory\r\nbrought out the so-called “1919 Canister,” which consisted of an oval\r\nsection, perforated metal, war gas material container with a central,\r\nflat, perforated breathing tube connected to a nozzle at one end. (See\r\nalso page 228.) After this inner container is packed with the war gas\r\nchemicals, a filter jacket is slipped over it and the top edge sealed\r\nto the inner container.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 105.—1919 Felt Filter Canister.]\r\n\r\nAttempts were made to put paper filters on this canister by wrapping\r\nit with layers of paper. In some cases, layers of coarse burlap or\r\nmosquito netting were applied between the layers of paper to give\r\nmechanical strength and air space. The fact that many filters gave good\r\nprotection showed that a filter of this type and material is possible,\r\nbut the operations of wrapping and sealing require careful work in\r\nproduction and inspection and even with the greatest skill and care,\r\nimperfections are almost impossible to avoid. This chance of defects,\r\ntogether with the labor involved, makes the process undesirable.\r\n\r\n\r\nA THEORY OF SMOKE FILTERS\r\n\r\nTolman, Wells and Gerke, during the course of their work on toxic\r\nsmokes, developed the following theory of smoke filters.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena occurring in the filtration of smoke are exceedingly\r\ncomplicated, but the general nature of the process may be simply\r\ndescribed in terms of the kinetic properties of the small particles\r\ncomprising the smoke.\r\n\r\nA filter may be regarded as a series of minute capillaries through\r\nwhich the smoke slowly flows. In order that filtration may take place,\r\nit is not necessary to assume that the capillaries of the filter are\r\nsmaller than the particle, for the particles may diffuse to the walls\r\nof the capillaries and it is believed that with typical filters this is\r\nthe actual method of smoke removal for particles less than 10⁻⁴ cm. in\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with this view as to the nature of smoke filtration,\r\nthe important factors involved are (1) the Brownian motion of the\r\nsmoke particles, (2) the area and arrangement of the internal surface\r\npresented by the filter, (3) the flow of the smoke as a whole, and\r\n(4) the attractive forces between the filter surfaces and the smoke\r\nparticles. The first three of these factors determine how many\r\nparticles come within the range of the mutual forces of the particle\r\nand filter surface, and the fourth factor determines the chance or\r\nexpectation that the particle will permanently adhere to the surface of\r\nthe filter.\r\n\r\n\r\nTESTING SMOKE FILTERS\r\n\r\nAll the early tests made on smoke filters used diphenylchloroarsine,\r\nbecause it was felt that the filter must be tested against a toxic\r\nsmoke. A man test was developed as representative as possible of actual\r\nconditions in the field, and the time necessary for a man to detect\r\ndiphenylchloroarsine smoke in the effluent stream when breathing at\r\na normal rate, using a carefully controlled concentration of smoke\r\nproduced by detonation, was used as the criterion of the protection\r\noffered by the canister. This test was subject to extensive individual\r\nvariations, due to the varying physiological resistances of different\r\nmen to diphenylchloroarsine smoke. Further, it was quite inadequate for\r\nrapid testing on a large scale. A testing machine was then developed,\r\nwhich gave results comparable with those obtained in the man test. The\r\nmethod used in detecting the gas was physiological, that is, by smell\r\nor by its irritating action towards the membranes of the eye. While\r\nthese are purely qualitative tests, they are much more sensitive than\r\nany possible chemical tests.\r\n\r\nBecause of the desirability of having a method which could be\r\ncontrolled chemically, other methods were developed.\r\n\r\nAmmonium chloride is a solid smoke, consisting of particles of quite\r\nvariable sizes. It is sensitive to dilution and clogs the pores of the\r\nfiltering medium quite rapidly. For this reason it was used in the\r\nstudy of the rate of plugging or clogging of the filter (the closing of\r\nthe pores of the fabric or other material to the passage of air).\r\n\r\nThe smoke is produced by the reaction of ammonia and hydrogen\r\nchloride-air streams. The smoke thus generated is passed from the\r\nmixing chamber to a larger distribution box and from there through\r\nthe filter, at a standard rate. The concentration of the smoke may\r\nbe accurately determined by chemical means or photometrically, using\r\na Hess-Ives Tint Photometer, the Marten Photometer, or a special\r\nphotometer developed by the Chemical Warfare Service.\r\n\r\nA comparison of a large number of tests with those of other smokes\r\nwould indicate that ammonium chloride smoke offers accurate information\r\nas to protection sought, but is hardly a desirable smoke for testing on\r\na large scale.\r\n\r\nThe third method developed was the sulfuric acid smoke. This smoke was\r\nproduced by passing dry air through a tower of solid pieces of sulfur\r\ntrioxide and then mixing the vapor with a large volume of air at 50 per\r\ncent relative humidity. It is not a clogging smoke and the filtering\r\nefficiency does not change materially in the time of exposure required\r\nfor a test. The smoke lends itself easily to chemical analysis and\r\noffers data as to exact particulate cloud concentrations which will\r\npenetrate canisters; photometric measurements are also applicable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 106.—Tobacco Smoke Apparatus for Testing Canisters.]\r\n\r\nThe fourth method consists in the use of tobacco smoke. This is\r\ngenerated by passing air over ignited sticks of a mixture of tobacco\r\n(63 per cent), rosin (30 per cent) and potassium nitrate (7 per cent).\r\nThis smoke is composed of particles of extreme uniformity in size;\r\nchemically it is relatively inert. It is not a clogging smoke and is\r\nnot sensitive to moisture and dilution. The density of the effluent\r\nsmoke is compared with that of the entering smoke in a Tyndall beam,\r\nand the filtering capacity of the material determined in terms of\r\nthe amount of air necessary to dilute the entering air to the same\r\nconcentration of the effluent air. The method is simple in manipulation\r\nand the test is a rapid one (50 canisters per day). Because of\r\nthe apparent superiority of tobacco smoke as a testing smoke, the\r\naccompanying disadvantages are possibly outweighed.\r\n\r\nFrom the standpoint of inherent chemical properties, the general\r\ndesirability of a suitable testing smoke would decrease in the\r\nfollowing order: tobacco, sulfuric acid, ammonium chloride.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nSIGNAL SMOKES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe success of pyrotechnics in night signalling led, during the\r\nWorld War, to considerable attention being paid to the development\r\nof pyrotechnic signals for day use. This was mainly directed to the\r\nproduction of distinctive smokes, which should have the same long range\r\nvisibility under varying light conditions. Since a gray or white smoke\r\nmight be confused with the smoke produced accidentally by the explosion\r\nof shell, it was necessary to use smoke of definite and unmistakable\r\ncolors, and red, blue, yellow, green and purple smokes were developed.\r\nDuring the early part of the war, only a yellow smoke was in use,\r\nthough others were added later.\r\n\r\n\r\nPRODUCTION OF COLORED SMOKES\r\n\r\nThere are three possible ways of obtaining signal smokes.\r\n\r\n      I. Mechanically dispersing solids.\r\n     II. Chemical Reaction.\r\n    III. Volatilization of colored materials.\r\n\r\nI. The first method, while possible, can never be an efficient method\r\nof producing signals. Some success was met with in dispersing certain\r\ninorganic materials, as rouge, and ultramarine, in projectiles fired\r\nfrom a 3-inch mortar and exploded by a time fuse arrangement at the\r\nheight of their flight. Various mixtures were also tried, such as\r\nantimony oxysulfide and aluminum powder (red), arsenic and antimony\r\ntrichlorides with sodium thiosulfate (yellow), etc., but these\r\ncompositions have the disadvantages of being liable to catch fire if\r\ndispersed by a black powder explosion.\r\n\r\nII. While colored smokes may be produced by chemical reaction, such\r\nas the combination of hydrogen iodide (HI), chlorine and ammonia, the\r\nclouds are not satisfactory as signals. In this particular case, the\r\npurple cloud (to the operator in the aeroplane) appeared white to the\r\nobservers on the ground.\r\n\r\nHigh temperature combustion smokes have also been studied. These are\r\nused in the so-called smoke torches. The _yellow_ arsenic sulfide\r\nsmoke is the most widely used. Most formulas call for some sulfide of\r\narsenic (usually the native realgar, known commercially as “Red Saxony\r\nArsenic”), sulfur, potassium nitrate, and in some cases, a diluent like\r\nground glass or sand. A typical mixture consists of:\r\n\r\n    Red arsenic sulfide   55%\r\n    Sulfur                15%\r\n    Potassium nitrate     30%\r\n\r\nA very similar smoke may be obtained from the following mixture:\r\n\r\n    Sulfur              28.6%\r\n    White arsenic       32.0%\r\n    Potassium nitrate   33.8%\r\n    Powdered glass       6.6%\r\n\r\nThese smokes are not as satisfactory in color as the smoke produced\r\nby a dye smoke mixture, especially when viewed from a distance, with\r\nthe sky as a background. They fade out rather quickly to a very nearly\r\nwhite smoke.\r\n\r\nA _black_ smoke upon first thought might seem to be the easiest of all\r\nsmokes to produce, but actually the production of a black smoke that\r\nwould be satisfactory for signalling purposes was rather a difficult\r\nmatter.\r\n\r\nStarting with the standard smoke mixture, which gives a white or gray\r\nsmoke, hexachloroethane, which is solid, was substituted for the carbon\r\ntetrachloride, in order to avoid a liquid constituent. Naphthalene was\r\nfirst used, until it was found that the mixture of naphthalene and\r\nhexachloroethane melted at temperatures below that of either of the\r\nconstituents. Anthracene was then substituted. The principal reaction\r\nis between the magnesium and the chlorine-containing compound, whereby\r\nmagnesium chloride and carbon are formed. The reaction is very violent,\r\nand a white smoke is produced. The anthracene slows down the reaction\r\nand at the same time colors the smoke black. The speed of the reaction\r\nmay be controlled by varying the anthracene content.\r\n\r\nIn burning this type of smoke mixture in a cylinder, it is essential\r\nthat free burning be allowed. It has been found that if combustion\r\nis at all smothered, and the smoke forced to escape through a\r\ncomparatively small opening, it will be gray instead of dense black.\r\n\r\nIII. Various attempts have been made to utilize the heat evolved when\r\nthe Berger type smoke mixture reacts to volatilize or mechanically\r\ndisperse various colored inorganic substances, and especially iodine.\r\nThese were unsuccessful. Modifications, such as\r\n\r\n    Strontium nitrate   1 part\r\n    Powdered iron       2 parts\r\n    Iodine              3 parts\r\n\r\nwere also tried, but while such mixtures ignited easily, burned freely\r\nand evenly, and gave a continuous heavy purple cloud, they were very\r\nsensitive to moisture and capable of spontaneous ignition.\r\n\r\nThe most satisfactory and successful colored smokes are those produced\r\nby the volatilization of organic dye materials. This practice seems\r\nto have originated with the British, who produced such smokes by\r\nvolatilizing or vaporizing special dyes by igniting mixtures of the\r\ndye, lactose and potassium chlorate and smothering the combustion.\r\n\r\nIn selecting dyestuffs for this purpose it was at once recognized that\r\nonly those compounds can be used which are volatilized or vaporized\r\nwithout decomposition by the heat generated when the mixture is ignited\r\nand the combustion smothered. It was also found that the boiling point\r\nand melting or volatilization point of the colored compound must be\r\nclose enough together so that there is never much liquid dye present.\r\nSince all colored organic compounds are destroyed if subjected to\r\nsufficient heat, the mixture must be so prepared and the ignition\r\nso arranged that the heat generated is not sufficient to cause this\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nThe oxidizing agents used in the combustion mixture may be either\r\npotassium or sodium chlorate. The nitrate is not satisfactory. Lactose\r\nhas proven the best combustible. Powdered orange shellac is fairly\r\nsatisfactory but offers no advantage over lactose.\r\n\r\nThe following dyes have been found to give the best smokes:\r\n\r\n    Red        “Paratoner”\r\n    Yellow     Chrysoidine + Auramine\r\n    Blue       Indigo\r\n    Purple     Indulin (?)\r\n    Green      Auramine Yellow + Indigo\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the war, the only colored smoke used by the United\r\nStates Army was a yellow smoke. The smoke mixture used in all signals,\r\nexcepting the smoke torch, was the old arsenic sulfide mixture. The\r\nfollowing smoke signals were adopted during the World War:\r\n\r\n    Signal Parachute Rocket             Yellow and Red\r\n    V. B. Parachute Cartridge           Yellow\r\n    25 mm. Very Parachute Cartridge     Yellow\r\n    35 mm. Signal Cartridge             Yellow\r\n    35 mm. Signal Cartridge             Red\r\n    35 mm. Signal Pistol\r\n    25 mm. Very Signal Pistol\r\n    V. B. Rifle Discharger Cut\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TACTICAL USE OF SIGNAL SMOKES\r\n\r\nFrom the days when Horatius kept the bridge, down through the centuries\r\nto the World War, all leaders in battle were pictured at the front\r\nand with flaming sword, mounted on magnificent chargers, or otherwise\r\nso prominently dressed that all the world knew they were the leaders.\r\nDuring all these hundreds of years commands on the field of battle\r\nwere by the voice, by the bugle, or by short range signals with arms,\r\nflags, and swords. Even where quite large forces were involved they\r\nwere massed close enough ordinarily so that signalling by such means\r\nsufficed to cover the front of battle. In those cases where they did\r\nnot, reliance was put upon swift couriers on horseback or on foot.\r\n\r\nWith the invention of smokeless powder and the rifled gun battles were\r\nbegun and carried on at greater and greater ranges. Artillery fired\r\nnot only 2,000 to 3,000 yards but up to 5,000 and 10,000 yards, or\r\neven, as in the World War, at 20,000 yards and more. It was then that\r\nother means of signalling became essential. Distant signalling with\r\nflags is known to have been practiced to a certain extent on land for\r\na long time. The extension of the telegraph and telephone through\r\ninsulated wires laid by the Signal Service was the next great step\r\nin advance, and in the World War there came in addition the wireless\r\ntelephone both on land and in aeroplanes and balloons.\r\n\r\nAlong with this development, as mentioned under Screening Smokes, came\r\nthe development of the use of smoke for protection and for cutting off\r\nthe view of observers, thus making observation more and more difficult.\r\nThis use of smoke, coupled with the deadly fire of machine guns and\r\nhigh explosives, forced men to take shelter in deep shell holes, in\r\ndeep trenches and other places that were safe, but which made it nearly\r\nimpossible to see signals along the front of battle.\r\n\r\nEvery man can readily be taught to read a few signals when clearly\r\nindicated by definite, sharply defined colored smokes. At first these\r\nwere designed for use on the ground and will be used to a certain\r\nextent in the future for that purpose, particularly when it is desired\r\nto attract the attention of observers in aeroplanes or balloons. In\r\nsuch cases a considerable volume of smoke is desired. For the man in\r\nthe trench or shell hole some means of getting the signal above the\r\ndust and smoke of the battlefield is needed. It is there that signal\r\nsmokes carried by small parachutes, contained in rockets or bombs, have\r\nproven their worth. These signals floating high above the battlefield\r\nfor a minute or more, giving off brilliantly colored smokes, afford a\r\nmeans of sending signals to soldiers in the dust and smoke of battle\r\nnot afforded by any other method so far invented. As before stated,\r\nevery man can be taught these simple signals, where but very few men\r\ncan be taught to handle even the simplest of wireless telephones.\r\n\r\nThus, smoke has already begun to complicate, and in the future will\r\ncomplicate still more, every phase of fighting. It will be used for\r\ndeception, for concealment, for obscuring vision, for signalling and\r\nto hide deadly gases. The signal rocket will be used to start battles,\r\nchange fronts, order up reserves, and finally to stop fighting.\r\n\r\nThe signal smokes by day will be displaced at night by brilliantly\r\ncolored lights which will have the same meaning as similarly colored\r\nsmokes during the day. Thus, literally, smoke in the future will be the\r\ncloud by day and the pillar of fire by night to guide the bewildered\r\nsoldier on the field of battle with all its terrors and amidst the\r\nconfusion, gas, smoke and dust that will never be absent while battles\r\nlast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nINCENDIARY MATERIALS\r\n\r\n\r\nSince it is generally known that white phosphorus, when exposed to\r\nthe air, takes fire spontaneously, it logically follows that numerous\r\nsuggestions should have been made for using this material in incendiary\r\ndevices. Practice, however, has shown that, while phosphorus is\r\nundoubtedly of value against very easily ignitable materials, such as\r\nhydrogen in Zeppelins, or the gasoline tanks of aeroplanes and dry\r\nbrush or grass, it is of much less value when wood and other materials\r\nare considered. This is partly because of the low temperature of\r\nburning, and partly because the product of combustion (phosphoric\r\nanhydride) is really an excellent fireproofing substance. In view of\r\nthis, phosphorus was used primarily for smoke production.\r\n\r\nA superior incendiary material is found in thermit, a mixture of\r\naluminum and iron oxide. When ignited, it produces an enormous amount\r\nof heat very quickly, and the molten slag that results from the\r\nreaction will prolong the incendiary action upon inflammable materials.\r\nWhen used alone, however, it has the disadvantages that the incendiary\r\naction is confined to a small area and that the heat energy is wasted\r\nbecause of the fact that it is so rapid in its action.\r\n\r\nFor this reason it is customary to add a highly inflammable material,\r\nwhich will become ignited by the thermit and will continue the\r\nconflagration. Petroleum oils, carbon disulfide, wood distillation\r\nproducts and other inflammable liquids were thoroughly tested for this\r\npurpose. The final conclusion was reached that oil, solidified with\r\nsoap (sodium salts of the higher fatty acids) by a special method\r\ndeveloped by the Chemical Warfare Service, was by far the best material\r\nto be used. In certain tests, using a combination of thermit and solid\r\noil, flames fifteen feet high were obtained, which would be very useful\r\nagainst walls, ceilings, etc.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this type of incendiary material, it was desirable to\r\nhave a spontaneously inflammable mixture of oils, which could be used\r\nin Livens’ shell, Stokes’ shell or aeroplane bombs. The basis of these\r\nmixtures is fuel oil and phosphorus. By varying the proportions of\r\nthe constituents it is possible to obtain a mixture that will ignite\r\nimmediately upon exposure to the air, or one that will have a delayed\r\naction of from 30 seconds to two minutes.\r\n\r\nThe incorporation of metallic sodium gives a mixture that will ignite\r\nwhen spread upon water surfaces.\r\n\r\n\r\nINCENDIARY DEVICES\r\n\r\nThe incendiary devices used during the late war included: bombs, shell,\r\ntracer shell and bullets, grenades, and flame throwers.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOMBS\r\n\r\nIncendiary bombs were used almost exclusively by aircraft. The value\r\nof bombs which would cause destruction by starting conflagrations was\r\nearly recognized but their development was rather slow. While the\r\ndesigns were constantly changing, two stand out as the most favored:\r\na small unit, such as the Baby Incendiary Bomb of the English, and a\r\nlarge bomb, such as the French Chenard bomb or the American Mark II\r\nbomb.\r\n\r\nIn general bombs which, when they function upon impact, scatter small\r\nburning units over a considerable area, are not favored. Small unit\r\nbombs can be more effectively used because the scatter can be better\r\nregulated and the incendiary units can be more advantageously placed.\r\n\r\n=German Bombs.= Incendiary bombs were used by the Germans in their\r\nairplane raids, usually in connection with high explosive bombs. A\r\ntypical armament of the later series of German naval airships consisted\r\nof the following:\r\n\r\n     2 660-pound bombs\r\n    10 220-pound bombs\r\n    15 110-pound bombs\r\n    20 Incendiary bombs\r\n\r\nmaking a total weight of about 2½ tons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 107.—Incendiary Devices.\r\n\r\n(From Left to Right). Mark II Bomb, B. I. Bomb, Mark I Dart, Mark II\r\nDart, Mark I Dart, Grenade, Mark I Bomb.]\r\n\r\nA typical German bomb is shown in Fig. 108. It consists essentially of\r\na receiver of white iron (R) composed of a casing and a central tube\r\nof zinc, joined together in such a fashion that, when the whole was\r\ncomplete, it had the appearance of an elongated vessel with a hollow\r\ncenter. Within this central hollow is placed a priming tube (T) of thin\r\nsheet iron, pierced by a number of circular openings. The receiver is\r\nabout 445 mm. (17.5 in.) high and 110 mm. (4.3 in.) at its maximum\r\ndiameter. It is wrapped with strands of tarred cord over nearly its\r\nentire length. The empennage (270 mm. or 10.6 in.—in height) consisted\r\nof three inclined balancing fins, which assured the rotation of the\r\nprojectile during its fall.\r\n\r\nIn the body of the bomb was a viscous mass of benzine hydrocarbons,\r\nwhile the lower part of the receiver contained a mixture of potassium\r\nperchlorate and paraffin. The central tube apparently contained a\r\nmixture of aluminum and sulfur.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 108.—Aerial Incendiary Bomb, November, 1916.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 109.—German Incendiary Bomb, Scatter Type.]\r\n\r\nLater the Germans used a scatter type of bomb (Fig. 109) which was\r\ndesigned to give 46 points of conflagration. Each of these 46 small\r\ncylinders contained 50 grams of an air incendiary material. They were\r\narranged in layers, packed in with very fine gun powder. The bomb\r\nis ignited by a friction lighter which is pulled automatically when\r\nthe bomb is released from the aeroplane. The bomb is constructed to\r\nburst in the air and not on striking the ground. The upper part of the\r\nprojectile consists of a cast iron nose riveted to the sheet iron body\r\nof the bomb. When the explosion occurs, the nose is blown away and the\r\nsmall incendiary cylinders are scattered in the air.\r\n\r\nThe incendiary material appears to be a mixture of barium nitrate and\r\ntar. Its incendiary power is very low because combustion takes the form\r\nof a small flame of very short duration. It should, however, be very\r\nvaluable for firing inflammable materials.\r\n\r\n=British Bombs.= The early British bombs were petrol bombs, which were\r\nused without great success for crop burning. Phosphorus bombs were\r\nthen used for attacking aircraft. But the most successful incendiary\r\nis the so-called “Baby Incendiary Bomb.” This is a 6.5-ounce bomb with\r\nan incendiary charge of special thermit. These small bombs are carried\r\nin containers holding either 144 or 272 bombs. The former container\r\napproximates in size and weight one 50-pound H.E. bomb and the latter\r\none 120-pound H.E. bomb. The bomb contains a cartridge very much like a\r\nshot gun shell which, on impact, sets down on the striker point in the\r\nbase of the body, and causes the ignition of the charge. It is claimed\r\nthat the cartridge of the B.I. bomb burns when totally immersed in any\r\nliquid (water included) and in depths up to two feet the flame breaks\r\nthrough the surface.\r\n\r\n=French Bombs.= The French used three types of incendiary bombs, a\r\nspecial thermit (calonite), the Chenard and the Davidsen. The Chenard\r\nbomb is a true intensive type and is thought to be very successful.\r\nIt functions by means of a time fuse operated by the unscrewing of\r\na propeller, before striking the ground, and reaches its target in\r\nflames. Its chief disadvantage is the small amount of incendiary\r\nmaterial which it carries. The Davidsen bomb expels its charge as a\r\nsingle unit and is not considered as valuable or as successful as the\r\nChenard.\r\n\r\n=American Bombs.= The program of the Chemical Warfare Service included\r\nthree types of bombs:\r\n\r\n    Mark  II  Incendiary drop bomb\r\n    Mark III  Incendiary drop bomb\r\n    Mark   I  Scatter bomb\r\n\r\n=Mark II Bomb.= The incendiary Mark II drop bomb is designed to be\r\ndropped from an aeroplane and is intended for use against buildings,\r\netc., when penetrating effect followed by an intensive incendiary\r\naction is sought.\r\n\r\nThe bomb case consists of two parts: a body and a nose. The body is a\r\ntapering zinc shell which carries the firing mechanism and stabilizing\r\ntail fin at the small end and at the large end a threaded ring which\r\nscrews into the nose. The nose is of drawn steel of such shape as to\r\nhave low end-on resistance and is sufficiently strong to penetrate\r\nframe structures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 110.—Loading Bombs with “Solid” Oil.]\r\n\r\nThe incendiary effect is produced by a thermit charge carried in the\r\nnose of the bomb. This charge is ignited by a booster of “Thermit\r\nIgniter” fired by black powder. The latter is ignited by a flash from\r\nthe discharge of a standard 0.30 caliber service cartridge contained in\r\nthe body of the bomb, and exploded by a firing mechanism of the impact\r\ntype. This method of firing has proven wholly unsatisfactory and will\r\nbe superseded by some more direct-acting mechanism. The body of the\r\nbomb is filled with solidified oil. The molten thermit burns through\r\nthe case of the bomb and liberates the oil which has been partially\r\nliquefied by the heat of the thermit reaction. Additional incendiary\r\neffect is afforded by the sodium nitrate contained in the nose below\r\nthe thermit, and by two sheet lead cylinders filled with sodium and\r\nimbedded in the solid oil. The sodium increases the difficulty of\r\nextinguishing the fire with water.\r\n\r\n=Mark III Bomb.= This bomb is simply a larger size of the Mark II bomb,\r\nits weight being approximately 100 pounds as compared with 40 pounds\r\nfor the Mark II bomb. It is designed to be dropped from an aeroplane\r\nand is intended for use against buildings when marked penetrating\r\neffect is desired. The method of functioning is the same as the Mark II\r\nbomb and it has the same defects in the firing mechanism.\r\n\r\n=Mark I Bomb (Scatter Type).= The Mark I incendiary drop bomb is also\r\ndesigned to be dropped from aeroplanes and is intended for use against\r\ngrain fields, ammunition dumps, light structures or similar objectives\r\nwhen only a low degree of ignition is required. It is of the so-called\r\nscatter type, due to the action of the exploding charge which casts\r\nout incendiary material within a radius of 20 feet from the point of\r\ncontact.\r\n\r\nThe incendiary action is due to the ejection of the various incendiary\r\nunits in the bomb by the explosion of the black powder in the nose. The\r\nflash of this explosion serves to ignite the units. A powder charge in\r\nthe rear of the bomb acts simultaneously with the nose charge, opening\r\nthe bomb casing, and aiding materially in the scatter of the units.\r\nThe bomb is so arranged as to function close to the ground, which is a\r\nfurther factor in the scatter of the units.\r\n\r\nThe incendiary units are waste balls about 2.5 in. in diameter and\r\nhaving an average weight of 2.5 ounces, tied securely with strong\r\ntwine. These are soaked in a special oil mixture. Carbon disulfide and\r\ncrude turpentine, or carbon disulfide, benzene heads and crude kerosene\r\ngave satisfactory results. A later development attempted to replace\r\nthe waste balls by solid oil, but the difficulties of manufacture and\r\nquestions of transportation argued against its adoption.\r\n\r\nThese bombs were not used at the front. Nearly all of the American\r\nincendiary bombs proved too light on the nose and lower half, generally\r\nresulting in deformation upon impact and very poor results. New ones\r\nwill be made stronger.\r\n\r\n\r\nINCENDIARY DARTS\r\n\r\nThe British early recognized the value of a small bomb, and\r\nconsequently adopted their B.I.B. (Baby Incendiary Bomb), weighing\r\nabout 6.5 ounces. These are capable of being dropped in lots of 100\r\nor more and thus literally shower a given territory with fire. The\r\nintensity of fire at any given point is much less than that obtained\r\nwith the larger bombs, but the increased area under bombardment more\r\nthan counter balances this disadvantage. While the British aimed at\r\nthe perfection of a universal bomb, the American service felt that two\r\nclasses should be developed, one to be used against grain fields and\r\nforests, the other against buildings.\r\n\r\nThe first class was called the Mark I Dart. This consisted of an\r\nelongated 12-gauge shot gun shell, filled with incendiary material\r\nand provided with a firing mechanism to ignite the primer as the dart\r\nstrikes the ground. The flash of the primer sets fire to the booster,\r\nwhich, in turn, ignites the main incendiary charge. The latter burns\r\nseveral minutes, with a long flame. A retarding stabilizer attached\r\nto the tail of the dart serves the two-fold purpose of insuring the\r\nfunctioning of the firing mechanism and, by retarding the final\r\nvelocity of the dart, preventing the collapse of the dart body when\r\ndropped from very high altitudes.\r\n\r\nThe incendiary mixture is one which gives a long hot flame, burns for\r\nseveral minutes and leaves very little ash. In general it consists\r\nof an oxidizing agent (barium or sodium chlorate), a reducing agent\r\n(aluminum, or a mixture of iron, aluminum and magnesium), a filler\r\n(rosin, powdered asphaltum or naphthalene) and in some cases a binder\r\n(asphaltum, varnish or boiled linseed oil).\r\n\r\nThe Mark II Dart was developed to furnish a small size penetrating\r\nagent. It consists of a two-inch (diameter) zinc case filled with\r\nthermit and solid oil as the incendiary materials and provided with\r\na cast iron nose for penetration. During the first half minute after\r\nfiring, a pool of molten iron is formed by the thermit, which is very\r\npenetrating and affords a good combustible surface for the oil, which\r\nburns for an additional ten minutes.\r\n\r\nIt has an advantage over the Mark I dart in that it penetrates, and\r\nover the Mark II bomb in that it is smaller and lighter in weight.\r\n\r\n\r\nINCENDIARY SHELL\r\n\r\nIncendiary shell have been successfully used against aircraft and\r\nto some extent in bombardments of inflammable ground targets.\r\nAnti-aircraft shell are of small caliber and are usually\r\ntracer-incendiary. Such shell are filled with pyrotechnic mixtures\r\nwhich ignite at the moment of firing, or by time fuse, and are\r\neffective against highly inflammable material. Shell filled with\r\nthermit which explode and scatter the molten iron have been used\r\nagainst aircraft and ground targets, but with rather poor results.\r\nLarge shell, which burst upon impact and scatter units of burning\r\nmaterials, have been used with some success against ground targets.\r\n\r\nTracer shell contain such mixtures as barium nitrate, magnesium and\r\nshellac, or red lead and magnesium.\r\n\r\n\r\nINCENDIARY BULLETS\r\n\r\nIncendiary bullets are only effective against highly inflammable\r\nmaterial, and are therefore used principally in aerial warfare against\r\naircraft, either for the purpose of igniting the hydrogen of the gas\r\nbag, or the gasoline. The present tendency is towards the use of the\r\nlarge size (11 mm.) bullet, because of its greater incendiary action.\r\n\r\nThe incendiary material is either white phosphorus or a special\r\nincendiary mixture consisting of an oxidizing agent and some\r\ncombustible or mixture of combustibles. The white tracer bullet\r\ncontains a mixture of barium peroxide and magnesium. A red bullet\r\ncontained in addition, strontium nitrate and chloride, or peroxide.\r\n\r\n\r\nINCENDIARY HAND GRENADE\r\n\r\nWhile the use of incendiary grenades and other small incendiary devices\r\nis limited, such armament is considered very valuable in trench\r\nwarfare. They can be used to set fire to inflammable material, either\r\nin offensive or defensive operations.\r\n\r\nPhosphorus grenades, while used principally for producing smoke (see\r\npage 302), have considerable value as an incendiary weapon.\r\n\r\nThermit grenades are very useful in rendering unserviceable guns\r\nand other metallic equipment which must be abandoned. They permit\r\naviators to destroy planes which motor troubles oblige to land in enemy\r\nterritory. They are also used to ignite inflammable liquids, thrown\r\ninto a dugout, or sprayed over an objective by a flame projector.\r\n\r\nThe Mark I hand grenade was developed for burning enemy ammunition\r\ndumps, for clearing away brush or other material in front of trenches\r\nand for use in dugouts. The standard H.E. grenade body was half-filled\r\nwith thermit and half with a celluloid container filled with a\r\nsolidified fuel oil. The grenade is fired by the spit of the fuse of\r\nthe bouchon firing mechanism. This, through the booster, lights the\r\nthermit igniter, which in turn fires the main charge of thermit. The\r\nresulting molten iron readily penetrates the grenade case, at the same\r\ntime igniting the celluloid case and its contents. The oil burns for\r\nabout 3.5 minutes. This grenade was never used since it was considered\r\nthat an all thermit grenade would be of more value.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRENCH MORTAR EQUIPMENT\r\n\r\nSpecial projectiles were designed for use with the Stokes mortar and\r\nthe Livens’ projector. Thermit was used only in Stokes’ projectiles.\r\nThe Livens’ projectile was filled with inflammable units (chlorated\r\njute) immersed in a light oil mixture. Thrown from a projector into\r\nthe enemy’s trench, it explodes, giving a large flash and scattering\r\nthe burning units over an area of forty yards. The Mark II projectile,\r\ndesigned for general incendiary effect against readily inflammable\r\nmaterial, consists of an altered 8-inch Livens’ gas projectile filled\r\nwith chlorated jute units impregnated with solid oil and immersed in\r\na spontaneously inflammable oil. After a short delay, these units\r\nburst into flame and burn vigorously for several minutes. It is almost\r\nimpossible to extinguish them without large quantities of water. Such\r\nbombs have only a very limited use, so that it is questionable if they\r\nare really worth while.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 111.—German 8\" Incendiary Bullet.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 112.—German Incendiary Blue Pencil.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMAN BLUE PENCIL\r\n\r\nA very interesting and curious device was developed by the Germans in\r\nthe form of an incendiary pencil. Similar in appearance to a common\r\nblue pencil, sharpened at one end, they are distinguished only by a\r\nsmall, almost imperceptible, point placed on the outside 11 mm. from\r\nthe unsharpened end. They are 175 mm. long, 11.1 mm. in diameter and\r\nweigh 12 to 13 grams. The interior of the pencil contains a glass\r\nbulb, with two compartments filled with sulfuric acid and a celluloid\r\ntube filled with potassium chlorate. The glass bulb ends in a slender\r\npoint; when this is broken the acid comes into contact with the\r\nchlorate and causes an explosion. The two materials are separated by a\r\nlayer of clay, which causes a delayed action of about 30 minutes. The\r\noperator breaks the point of bulb, buries the pencil vertically in the\r\ninflammable material and then has half an hour in which to get away,\r\nbefore any possibility of a fire. He cuts the pencil with a knife 2\r\ncm. from the point, so that if caught he has the appearance of simply\r\nsharpening a pencil.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLAMING GUN\r\n\r\nAmong the unsuccessful weapons of the late war, the liquid fire gun\r\nor Flammenwerfer, as the German called it, is probably the most\r\ninteresting. Its origin, according to a German story, was due to a\r\nmere accident. A certain officer, during peace maneuvers, was ordered\r\nto hold a fort at all cost. During the sham fight, having employed all\r\nthe means at his disposal, he finally called out the fire brigade and\r\ndirected streams of water upon the attacking force. Afterwards, during\r\nthe criticism of the operations in the presence of the Kaiser, he\r\nclaimed that he had subjected the attackers to streams of burning oil.\r\nThe Kaiser immediately inquired whether such a thing would be possible,\r\nand was assured that it was entirely feasible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Copyright by Kadel and Herbert, N. Y.\r\n\r\nFIG. 113.—Liquid Fire Attack.]\r\n\r\nLong series of experiments were necessary before a satisfactory\r\ncombination of oils was produced, which could be projected as a\r\nflame on the enemy, but they were finally successful. Unlike the\r\nuse of poison gas, however, the flaming liquid gun did not prove to\r\nbe a successful weapon of warfare. True, at first they were rather\r\nsuccessful, but this was before the men learned their real nature. In\r\nthe first attack, the Allies were completely surprised and the troops\r\nwere routed by the flames. Auld tells of one of the early attacks (July\r\n29, 1915) when, without warning, the front line troops were enveloped\r\nin flames. Where the flames came from could not be seen. All that the\r\nmen knew was that they seemed surrounded by fierce, curling flames,\r\nwhich were accompanied by a loud roaring noise, and dense clouds of\r\nblack smoke. Here and there a big blob of burning oil would fall into\r\na trench or saphead. Shouts and yells rent the air as individual men,\r\nrising up in the trenches or attempting to move in the open, felt the\r\nforce of the flames. The only way to safety appeared to be to the rear.\r\nThis direction the men that were left took. For a short space the\r\nflames pursued them and the local retirement became a local rout. After\r\nthe bombardment which followed, only one man is known to have returned.\r\n\r\nAfter a study of the pictures of the liquid fire gun in operation, it\r\nis evident that the men could not be blamed for this retirement. One\r\nhas only to imagine being faced by a spread of flame similar to that\r\nused for the oil burners under the largest boiler, but with a jet\r\nnearly 60 feet in length and capable of being sprayed round as one\r\nmight spray water with a fire hose.\r\n\r\nLater, when the device was better known it was different, though even\r\nthen it was a pretty good test of a man’s nerve. It was found that\r\nthe flames could not follow one to the bottom of a trench as the gas\r\ndid, and that, if a man crouched to the bottom of his trench, his head\r\nmight be very warm for a minute or so but that the danger was soon past\r\nand he then could pick off the man who had so recently made things\r\nuncomfortable for him.\r\n\r\nWhile it is said that Major R., who invented the Flammenwerfer, enjoyed\r\na great popularity among his men, and is familiarly known as the Prince\r\nof Hades, there is no doubt that this was not shared by the Allies.\r\nTheir rule was: “Shoot the man carrying the apparatus before he gets\r\nin his shot, if possible. If this cannot be done, take cover from the\r\nflames and shoot him afterwards.”\r\n\r\nThe German had several types, which may be grouped into the _small_ or\r\n_portable_ and the _large_ Flammenwerfers.\r\n\r\nThe portable Flammenwerfer consisted of a sheet steel cylinder of two\r\ncompartments, one to hold compressed nitrogen, the other to hold the\r\noil. The nitrogen furnished the pressure which forces the oil out\r\nthrough the flexible tube. Air cannot be used, because the oxygen would\r\nform an explosive mixture with the vapors of the oil, and any heating\r\non compression, or back flash from the flame or fuse might make things\r\nvery unpleasant for the operator. A pressure of about 23 atmospheres\r\nis reached when the cylinder is charged. The nitrogen appeared to\r\nbe carried on the field in large containers and the flame projectors\r\nactually charged in the trenches.\r\n\r\nThe oil used in the flame projectors varied from time to time, but\r\nalways contained a mixture of light or easily volatile and heavy and\r\nless volatile fractions of petroleum or mineral oil, very carefully\r\nmixed. In some cases even ordinary commercial ether has been found in\r\nthe cylinders.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 114.—Small Flammenwerfer.]\r\n\r\nThe most interesting part about the flame projector is the lighting\r\ndevice. This is so made that the oil ignites spontaneously the minute\r\nthe jet is turned on, and is kept alight by a fiercely burning mixture\r\nwhich lasts throughout the discharge. This mixture is composed of\r\nbarium nitrate, potassium nitrate, metallic magnesium and charcoal,\r\nwith some resinous material. The priming consists of black powder and\r\nmetallic magnesium.\r\n\r\nWhen the oil rushes out of the jet, it forces up the plunger of a\r\nfriction lighter and ignites this core of fiercely burning mixture.\r\n\r\nThe range of these small projectors is from 14 to 17 meters (17 to 20\r\nyards) but the duration of the flame is rather less than a minute.\r\n\r\nIn a later pattern, it was designed that one nozzle should be issued\r\nto three reservoirs. After the discharge of one, the jet is attached\r\nto the others in succession. This is called the “Wx” Flammenwerfer\r\n(interchangeable). In this way a squad of three men could carry 58\r\npints of inflammable oil. It is a question, though, whether the third\r\nman would live to use his reservoir.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 115.—Boyd Flame Projector.]\r\n\r\nThe fact that the trenches were often very close together during the\r\nearly part of the war, made possible the use of large or stationary\r\nFlammenwerfer. These consisted of a steel reservoir 3⅓ feet in height\r\nand 1⅔ feet in diameter, weighing about 250 pounds, which could be\r\nconnected to two steel cylinders, containing nitrogen under pressure.\r\nThese carried 180 liters (40 gallons) of liquid and operated under a\r\npressure of 15 atmospheres. The discharge nozzle was at the end of a\r\nmetal tube three feet long, and its orifice was about ⁵/₁₆ of an inch\r\nin diameter. The range of this apparatus was from 33 to 40 yards and\r\nthe duration of the flame from one to two minutes. Because of the\r\ncomparatively short range of these guns and the ease with which they\r\ncould be destroyed, if located by the enemy, their use was very limited.\r\n\r\nEven with the portable flammenwerfer, the most difficult thing to do\r\nis to get near enough the target to make the shoot effective. Another\r\nserious disadvantage is its very short duration. It is impossible to\r\ncharge up again on the spot, and the result is that once the flame\r\nstops, the whole game is finished and the operators are at the mercy of\r\nthe enemy.\r\n\r\nWith these facts in mind it is easy to see how service in the flaming\r\ngun regiments is apparently a form of punishment. Men convicted of\r\noffenses in other regiments were transferred either for a time or\r\npermanently and were forced under threat of death in the most hazardous\r\nenterprises and to carry out the most dangerous work. Taken all in\r\nall the flame thrower was one of the greatest failures among the many\r\npromising devices tried out on a large scale in the war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nTHE PHARMACOLOGY OF WAR GASES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pharmacology of war gases plays such an important part in chemical\r\nwarfare that a brief discussion may well be given of the methods\r\nused in the testing of gases for toxicity and other pharmacological\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\nWar gases may be divided into two groups: persistent and\r\nnon-persistent, each of which may include several classes:\r\n\r\n      I. Lethal\r\n     II. Lachrymatory\r\n    III. Sternutatory\r\n     IV. Special\r\n\r\nEach class necessitates special tests in order to determine whether or\r\nnot it is suitable for further development.\r\n\r\n\r\nTOXICITY\r\n\r\nOne of the first points which must be carefully determined in\r\ninvestigating a substance is its toxicity. It is important that this be\r\ndetermined for numerous reasons:\r\n\r\n1. To determine what concentrations are dangerous in the field.\r\n\r\n2. To ascertain how effective protective devices have to be to furnish\r\nsufficient protection against the gas.\r\n\r\n3. To furnish a basis for accurate experimental work on the treatment\r\nof gassed cases.\r\n\r\n4. To decide whether or not the material is worthy of further\r\ndevelopment in the laboratory or in the plant.\r\n\r\nThese considerations necessitate the determination of the toxicity in\r\nthe form of a vapor and not by the ordinary method of administration\r\nby mouth, through the skin (subcutaneously) or through the blood\r\n(intravenously). The simplest method of determining the toxicity of\r\na substance as a vapor would be to place animals in a gas-tight box\r\nand introduce a known amount of the substance in the form of vapor.\r\nBut by this method the concentration is not accurately known unless\r\nchemical analyses of the air are made, and then it is found to be much\r\nless than that calculated from the amount of substance introduced,\r\nbecause of condensation on the walls of the chamber, or absorption of\r\nthe substance by the skin and hair of the animal and in some cases, of\r\ndecomposition of the substance by moisture in the air. Moreover, it is\r\nfound that the concentration decreases markedly with time. Because of\r\nthese factors, the figures used for the concentration are more or less\r\nguess work. To overcome these difficulties, a chamber is used through\r\nwhich a continuous current of air, containing a known and constant\r\namount of the poisonous vapor, is passed. Such an apparatus is shown in\r\nFig. 116.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 116.—Continuous Flow Gassing Chamber for Animals.]\r\n\r\nThe flask _E_ is a 300 cc. Erlenmeyer flask, with a ground glass\r\nstopper. The liquid to be tested is placed in this flask together\r\nwith a sufficient quantity of glass wool to prevent splashing and the\r\ncarrying over mechanically of droplets of the liquid. Air is passed\r\nthrough _A_ and _C_ (calcium chloride drying tubes) and the rate\r\nmeasured by the flow meter _D_. The air and gas are mixed in _F_ before\r\npassing into the chamber _G_. This chamber is made of plate glass, is\r\nof about 100 liters capacity, and is air-tight. The entire flow of air\r\nand gas through the box, kept constant at 250 liters per minute, is\r\nmeasured at _H_. The gas is removed through _K_, which is filled with\r\ncharcoal and soda-lime, in order that little gas may pass into the pump.\r\n\r\nBy weighing the flask _E_, and its contents before and after passing\r\nair through it, and knowing the total volume of the mixture passing\r\nthrough the chamber during the same period, the concentration of the\r\nsubstance can readily be calculated. This concentration, as determined\r\nby the “loss in weight” method, can be checked by chemical analysis\r\n(samples taken at _M_—_M_). The method has been found to give accurate\r\nvalues.\r\n\r\nThe concentration in the chamber reaches its constant level within 30\r\nto 40 seconds after the apparatus is started.\r\n\r\nWith the flow of 250 liters per minute, the difficulties mentioned\r\nabove are reduced to a point where they are practically negligible.\r\n\r\nAll toxicity tests on mice were made with an exposure of ten minutes,\r\nwhile dogs were exposed for thirty minutes. In case death did not occur\r\nduring exposure, the animals were kept under observation for several\r\ndays. Toxicity and all other figures are expressed in milligrams per\r\nliter of air, though parts per million (p.p.m.) was frequently used\r\nduring the early work.\r\n\r\nAnother point of difficulty is the great individual variation in the\r\nsusceptibility of animals. This is probably greater than when the\r\npoison is administered subcutaneously or intravenously. It necessitates\r\nthe use of a large number of animals in making a determination of the\r\ntoxicity of a gas. Again, the toxicity for different species may vary,\r\nand as the ultimate aim is a knowledge of the toxicity for man, a\r\ngreat many different species must be used. If the toxicity is widely\r\ndifferent for different animal species, it is hard to arrive at a\r\ndefinite conclusion as to the toxicity for man.\r\n\r\nWith longer exposures than thirty minutes the lethal concentration\r\nis usually less, there being a cumulative effect. This is not true\r\nfor hydrocyanic acid. If the concentration is not enough to kill at\r\nonce, an animal can stand it almost indefinitely. Whether the action\r\nis cumulative or not depends on the rate at which the system destroys\r\nor eliminates the poison. If the poison is being eliminated as fast\r\nas received the concentration in the tissues cannot increase. It is\r\nstated, for example, that the amount of nicotine in a cigar would\r\nkill a man if taken in one dose. If it is spread over twenty minutes,\r\nthe destruction or elimination of the nicotine is so rapid that no\r\nobviously bad effects are noted.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting thing about the work on poison gases is that in\r\nmost cases a preliminary exposure to less than the lethal concentration\r\ndoes not seem to make the animal either more or less sensitive on a\r\nlater exposure. This is quite unexpected, because we know that with\r\nirritating gases, especially lachrymators, men adapt themselves to\r\nmuch higher concentrations than they could stand at first. In view\r\nof the experiences of arsenic eaters, it is quite possible that the\r\nexperiments, which showed no accustoming to toxic gases, were not\r\ncontinued long enough to give positive results.\r\n\r\nNot only does the susceptibility of different animals of the same\r\nspecies vary greatly for a particular gas, but the susceptibility of\r\ndifferent species varies greatly with different gases. Thus while the\r\neffects of certain gases on mice are quite comparable to the effects on\r\nman, it is very far from being true with other gases.\r\n\r\n\r\nLACHRYMATORS\r\n\r\nWhile one cannot determine the lethal concentrations of poison gases\r\nfor men, it is possible to determine the concentration that will\r\nproduce lachrymation. The threshold value is that at which two-thirds\r\nof the observers experience irritation. The lachrymatory value is\r\nconsiderably higher than the threshold value.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 117.—Aeration Apparatus for Testing Lachrymators.]\r\n\r\nA very satisfactory method for determining lachrymatory values is\r\nshown in Fig. 117. Air is measured at _A_ and bubbled through the\r\nlachrymatory substance in _B_. The air and gas are mixed in _D_ and\r\npass into _E_, a gas-tight, glass-walled chamber of about 150 liters\r\ncapacity. The gas is removed through _Ef_, by suction and the volume of\r\nthe air-gas mixture measured by the flow meter, _F_.\r\n\r\nAfter the apparatus has run a few minutes, and the concentration of\r\nthe gas has become constant, the subject is instructed to adjust the\r\nmask, attached at _H_, and to tell whatever he notices just as soon\r\nas he notices it. The operator stands in such a position that he can\r\nmanipulate the stopcock _H_ without being observed by the subject.\r\nAfter breathing air for a time (_H_ is a two-way cock, connected with\r\nthe air through _J_, and to the chamber through _Eg_) both to become\r\naccustomed to the mask and to eliminate, as far as possible, any\r\n“psychological symptoms,” the subject is allowed to breathe the gas\r\nmixture for a maximum of three minutes. If the expected symptoms are\r\nproduced in less than this time, the test is discontinued as soon as\r\nthey develop.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 118.—Type of Spray Nozzles.]\r\n\r\nFor accurate work, it is necessary to work with a pure sample which is\r\nat least fairly volatile. Mixtures cannot be run by this method. In\r\nthis case it is necessary to volatilize each separately, passing the\r\nvapors simultaneously into the mixing chamber _E_.\r\n\r\nA spray method may also be used with satisfactory results. Types of\r\nsprays are shown in Fig. 118.\r\n\r\n\r\nODORS\r\n\r\nBecause of the great value in detecting low concentrations of gases in\r\nthe field, it is important to know the smallest amount of a gas that\r\ncan be detected by odor. In some cases, this test is more delicate than\r\nany chemical test yet devised.\r\n\r\nOdors may be divided into two classes, true odors, and mild irritation.\r\nBy true odor is meant a definite stimulation of the olfactory nerve,\r\ngiving rise to a sensation which is more or less characteristic for\r\neach substance producing the stimulation. Mild irritation defines\r\nthe sensation which is confused with the sense of smell by untrained\r\nobservers, but which is really a gentle stimulation of the sensory\r\nnerve endings of the nose. This so-called odor of substances producing\r\nthis effect is not characteristic. Higher concentrations of these\r\ncompounds almost invariably cause a definite irritation of the nose.\r\n\r\nExamples of true odors are the mercaptans, mustard gas, bromoacetone,\r\nacrolein, chlorine and ammonia. Substances which cause mild irritation\r\nare chloroacetone, methyl dichloroarsine, ethyl iodoacetate and\r\nchloropicrin.\r\n\r\nIn making the test for odor, the same apparatus is used as for\r\nlachrymators. The time of exposure is shortened to 30 seconds, as the\r\nsubject always detects the odor at the first or second inhalation.\r\n\r\nIn this connection the recent work of Allison and Katz (_J. Ind.\r\nEng. Chem._ =11=, 336, [1919]) is of interest. They have designed an\r\ninstrument, “the odorometer,” for measuring the intensity of odors\r\nin varying concentrations in air. It is based on the principle given\r\nabove. A measured volume of air is passed through the liquid and\r\nthen diluted to a given concentration. The mixture is then passed\r\nthrough a rubber tube with a glass funnel at the open end. Only one\r\ninhalation of the mixture is used to determine the intensity of\r\nthe odor. The position of any strength of odor on the scale depends\r\nupon the sensitiveness and judgment of the operator, but with one\r\nperson conducting the entire test, the results have been found quite\r\nsatisfactory. (See tables on pages 360 and 361.)\r\n\r\n\r\nSKIN IRRITANTS\r\n\r\nSubstances which seem useful for producing skin burns are studied both\r\non animals and on man. Dichloroethyl sulfide (mustard gas) is used as a\r\nbasis of comparison. Several methods are available.\r\n\r\n=Direct Application.= This method consists of the direct application of\r\nthe compound itself to the skin, using a definite quantity (0.005 cc.\r\nor 0.005 mg.) over a definite area (5 square centimeters) of the skin.\r\nWith such a quantity of mustard gas a rather severe burn on animals is\r\nproduced. No precautions are taken to prevent evaporation from the skin\r\nsince it is believed that in this way the test will approximate fairly\r\nclosely the field conditions.\r\n\r\n=Vapor Tests.= Preliminary tests with vapors of volatile compounds are\r\nbest made by placing a small amount of the material on a plug of cotton\r\nin the bottom of a test tube enclosed in a larger test tube which acts\r\nas an air jacket. After about an hour at room temperature the mouth of\r\nthe test tube is applied to the skin. The concentration is not known,\r\nbut one is dealing practically with saturated vapor. If an exposure\r\nof from 30 to 60 minutes produces no effect, one is safe to assume\r\nthat the compound is not sufficiently active to be of value as a skin\r\nirritant.\r\n\r\nIf quantitative results are desired, the apparatus shown in Fig. 119\r\nis used. Dry air is blown through the bubbler, which is connected with\r\na series of glass skin applicators. The concentration is determined\r\nin the usual way. The skin applicator consists of a small cylinder\r\nabout 1.5 to 2 cm. in diameter and about 4 cm. long with a small\r\nglass handle attached on top. The opening is 1 cm. in diameter. When\r\nthe concentration of the gas is constant, the exposure to the skin\r\nis made directly for any desired length of time. The skin irritant\r\nefficiency is judged by comparing the per cent of positive responses to\r\napproximately equal concentrations of the vapors, using mustard gas as\r\na standard.\r\n\r\n

The method is qualitative only.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 119.—Skin Irritant Vapor Apparatus.]\r\n\r\n=Use of Solutions.= Alcohol, kerosene, olive oil, carbon tetrachloride\r\nand other solvents may be used for the purpose of determining\r\nthe lowest effective concentration of a substance, and for the\r\ndetermination of the relative skin irritant efficiencies of various\r\ncompounds. Since the skin irritants were scarcely ever used in\r\nthis form in the field, that is, in solution, the method is not as\r\nsatisfactory as the vapor method.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL WARFARE IN RELATION TO STRATEGY AND TACTICS[43]\r\n\r\n\r\n=Fundamentals of War.= The underlying fundamental principles of\r\nChemical Warfare are the same as for all other arms. Because of this,\r\nit is worth while, and even necessary, to understand the applications\r\nof Chemical Warfare, for us to go back and study the work of the\r\nmasters in war from the dawn of history down to the present. When we\r\ndo that we find that the underlying fundamental principles of war\r\nremain unchanged. They are the same today as they were in the time of\r\nDemosthenes, and as they will be 10,000 years from now. It is an axiom\r\nthat the basis of success in war is the ability to have at the decisive\r\npoint at the decisive moment a more effective force than that of the\r\nenemy. This involves men and materials. It involves courage, fighting\r\nability, and the discrimination and energy of the opposing commanders.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 43: This material is adapted from a lecture by Gen. Fries\r\nbefore the students of the General Staff College, in Washington, May\r\n11, 1921.]\r\n\r\nAnother fundamental is that no success is achieved without positive\r\naction; passive resistance never wins. These are really unchanging\r\nfundamentals. We may also say that the vigor of attack, the speed of\r\nmovement of men and supplies, and the thorough training of men in the\r\nuse of the weapons of war are unchanging requirements, but outside of\r\nthese everything is subject to the universal law of change.\r\n\r\n=Grecian Phalanx and Roman Legion.= The last word in the development\r\nof human strength as a battle weapon was illustrated by the Grecian\r\nphalanx with its sixteen rows of men, the spears of each row being so\r\nadjusted that all reached to the front line. That phalanx could not\r\nbe stopped by any other human formation that met it face to face. To\r\novercome it required a Roman legion that could open up and take the\r\nphalanx in the flank and rear. In the same way, the elephants of the\r\nAfricans and the chariots of the Romans with their great swords swept\r\nall in front of them, until the Roman Legion, opening up into smaller\r\ngroups allowed the elephants and chariots to pass through only to close\r\nin on them from the rear. Then and then only did those engines of war\r\ndisappear forever.\r\n\r\n=Frederick the Great.= Frederick the Great, realizing that rapidity of\r\nfire would win on the fields of battle where he fought, trained his\r\nmen to a precision of movement in close order probably never achieved\r\nby any other troops in the world and then added to their efficiency by\r\nteaching them to load and fire muskets at double the rate of that of\r\nhis adversaries. He was thus enabled to concentrate at the decisive\r\npoints a preponderance of power, which swept all his enemies before him.\r\n\r\n=Napoleon.= Napoleon achieved the same decisive power in a different\r\nway. Realizing that his French troops could not stand the rigorous\r\ntraining that the Prussians underwent, he trained them to fight with\r\ngreat enthusiasm, to travel long distances with unheard of swiftness,\r\nand to strike the enemy where least expected. He added to that a\r\nconcentration of artillery until then not thought of as possible on the\r\nfield of battle. He, of course, had also a genius for organizing and\r\nkeeping up his supply.\r\n\r\n=Grant and Jackson.= Grant at Vicksburg and Stonewall Jackson in\r\nthe Shenandoah Valley and at Chancellorsville, achieved the same\r\nresults in different ways. In every case the fundamental principle of\r\nconcentrating the greatest force at the decisive point at the vital\r\nmoment in the battle remained the same. The methods for achieving that\r\nend change with every age, and every commander of world-wide renown\r\ndeveloped something new or used an old method in a new way. And that\r\nis the fundamental requirement for a successful general. Hannibal,\r\nHasdrubal, Cæsar, Napoleon, Frederick the Great, Scott, Grant, and\r\nJackson were all independent thinkers. Each and every one dared to\r\ndo something that every other general and statesman of his time told\r\nhim could not be done or that would bring about disaster. They had\r\nthe courage of their convictions. They had the courage to think out\r\nnew ideas and to develop them, and then they had the courage to carry\r\nthrough those convictions, not alone against the opposition of the\r\nenemy, but against the opposition of their own people, both in the\r\nfield and at home. And we may be perfectly sure that in each case had\r\nthese men not done the things they did, they would have gone down to\r\noblivion just as has been the case with millions of others who tried\r\nthe usual methods in the usual way.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Warfare Latest Development.= Chemical Warfare is the latest\r\ndevelopment of war. So far as the United States is concerned, it is\r\nconsiderably less than four years old. It is the most scientific of all\r\nmethods of fighting and also the most universally applicable to all\r\nother methods of making war. The use of poisonous and irritating gases\r\nin war is just as fundamental as the introduction of gunpowder. In\r\nfact, they have an even wider application to war than powder itself.\r\n\r\n=Necessity for New Methods.= The idea that has been expressed above\r\nis that the General Staff and the Army commander who sticks to old\r\nand tried methods and who is unwilling to try with all his might new\r\ndevelopments, will never achieve any first class success. The General\r\nStaffs and the generals of the future that win wars will be the ones\r\nwho make the most vigorous and efficient use of Chemical Warfare\r\nmaterials. They cannot confine this use to the artillery, to Aviation,\r\nto Special Gas Troops, or to any other single branch of the war\r\nmachine. They must make use of it in every way.\r\n\r\n=What Is Meant by Gas.= It must be understood that by gases we refer\r\nto materials that injure by being carried to the victim in the air.\r\nThe word “gas” has nothing whatever to do with the condition of the\r\nmaterial when in the shell, or the bombs, or the cylinders before\r\nreleased. In every case, the gases are liquids or solids. When the\r\ncontainers are broken open the liquids are volatilized either by the\r\ngas pressure or by the force of the explosion of the bomb.\r\n\r\n=Groups of Gases.= Chemical Warfare gases are divided into three great\r\ngroups. So far as their actual tactical use on the field of battle is\r\nconcerned, there are only two groups—persistent and non-persistent. The\r\nthird is the irritant group. This group affects the eyes and the lungs\r\nso as to make the victim very uncomfortable if not completely incapable\r\nof action in quantities so small as to cause no injury that lasts more\r\nthan a few hours. The quantities of such gases needed to force the\r\nwearing of the mask is ¹/₁₀₀₀ that needed to cause the same discomfort\r\nby the really poisonous gases, such as phosgene. They, therefore, have\r\na very great economic value in harassing the enemy by forcing him to\r\nwear masks and to take other precautions against gas. And no matter how\r\nperfect gas masks and gas-proof clothing become, their long-continued\r\nuse will cut down physical vigor in an ever increasing ratio until in\r\ntwo or three days an army may be totally incapacitated.\r\n\r\n=Smoke.= In Chemical Warfare materials we have another great group\r\nwhich will probably be equal in the future to the three groups just\r\nmentioned. That is common smoke. Smoke has a variety of uses. By\r\nthe simple term “smoke” is meant smokes that are not poisonous or\r\nirritating. Such smokes offer a perfect screen against enemy vision,\r\nwhether it is the man who sights the machine gun, the observer in the\r\nlookout station, the cannoneer or even the aeroplane observer. Every\r\nshot through impenetrable smoke is a shot in the dark and has a tenth\r\nor even less chance of hitting its mark. Smoke affords a means of\r\ndecreasing the accuracy of firing, much the same as night decreases it,\r\nwithout the inherent difficulties of night action.\r\n\r\n=Peace Strategy.= The strategy of successful war involves the strategy\r\nof peace. This has been true from the days when David with his\r\nsling-shot slew Goliath, down to the present moment. We don’t always\r\nthink of it in connection with war, but back of every successful\r\nwar has been preparation during peace. It may have been incidental\r\npreparation such as the training of men in fighting Indians, and in\r\ncreating public sentiment favorable to an independent nation that\r\npreceded the Revolutionary War. It may, on the other hand, have been a\r\ndeeply studied policy such as that of the Germans prior to the World\r\nWar. They tried and generally quite successfully, to coördinate all\r\npeace activities toward the day when a war should come that would\r\ndecide the future destiny of the German Empire, and it was only because\r\nof that study in peace that Germany almost single-handed was able to\r\nstand out for more than four years against the world. The Allies came\r\nnear losing that war because they did not appreciate that the strategy\r\nof efficient war had to be preceded by the strategy of peace.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Warfare an Example.= Chemical warfare is a particularly good\r\nexample of this fact. Prior to the World War we had acknowledged, and\r\nwithout any misgivings, that Germany led the world in chemistry, that\r\nit produced most of the dyes in the world, and to a large extent the\r\nmedicines of the world. We felt that when American needs showed it to\r\nbe advisable we could take up chemistry and chemical production and\r\nsoon excel the Germans. We had not reckoned on the suddenness of war.\r\n\r\nWe were just getting ready with chemicals, and that included powders\r\nand high explosives, when the war closed. And yet we had had not only\r\neighteen months’ intensive preparation after our own entry into the\r\nWorld War, but also the preparation of great steel institutions and\r\npowder factories for nearly three years in manufacturing supplies for\r\nthe Allies who preceded us in the war.\r\n\r\n=Coal Tar.= The World War opened the eyes of England, France and Japan\r\nas well as the United States. Each of them today is struggling to build\r\nup a great chemical industry as the very foundation of successful war.\r\nFew of us realized prior to the World War that in the black, sticky\r\nmess called coal tar from the coking of coal or the manufacture of gas\r\nfrom coal and oil, was stored up most of the high explosives used in\r\nwar, the majority of the poison gases, a great deal of the medicines of\r\nthe world, and nearly all the dyes of the world. The Germans realized\r\nit and in their control over methods of using this material, together\r\nwith the great commercial plants developed to manufacture it, as well\r\nas with the trained personnel that must go with such plants, were\r\nenabled, when blockaded on land and sea, to furnish the munitions, the\r\nclothing and the food needed for four and one-half years of war.\r\n\r\n=Great Chemical Industries.= Thus it is that our Government today is\r\ngiving most serious heed to the need of building up a great chemical\r\nindustry in the United States. We have the raw materials. We need\r\nonly the factories and the trained men that go with them. We need, of\r\ncourse, in addition to the development of the coal tar industry, a\r\nproduction of heavy chemicals such as chlorine, sulfuric acid and the\r\nlike, all of which, however, are bound together by community interest\r\nin peace as well as in war.\r\n\r\n=Reserves of Chemists.= A part of the strategy of peace is the\r\ncard-indexing of the manpower of a nation divided into special groups.\r\nIn one great group must come those who have a knowledge of chemistry\r\nand the chemical industries. That must be so worked out that if war\r\nshould come on a moment’s notice, within twenty-four hours thereafter\r\nevery chemist could be given his job, jobs extending from the firing\r\nline to the research laboratory. And that is the task of the Chemical\r\nWarfare Service. And right here it is well to know that Congress, among\r\nthe other features of its Army Reorganization Act of June 4, 1920,\r\nprovided for a separate Chemical Warfare Service with these powers:\r\n\r\n\r\nCHEMICAL WARFARE POWERS\r\n\r\n    The Chief of the Chemical Warfare Service under the\r\n    authority of the Secretary of War shall be charged\r\n    with the investigation, development, manufacture,\r\n    or procurement and supply to the Army of all smoke\r\n    and incendiary materials, all toxic gases, and all\r\n    gas defense appliances; the research, design, and\r\n    experimentation connected with chemical warfare and its\r\n    material; and chemical projectile filling plants and\r\n    proving grounds; the supervision of the training of the\r\n    Army in chemical warfare, both offensive and defensive,\r\n    including the necessary schools of instruction; the\r\n    organization, equipment, training, and operation of\r\n    special gas troops, and such other duties as the\r\n    President may from time to time prescribe.\r\n\r\n=Why Power Is Needed.= These rather broad powers indicate that Congress\r\nrealized the unity of effort that must be made from the research\r\nlaboratory to the firing line if America was to keep pace with Germany\r\nor any other nation in chemical warfare. Some have raised the question\r\nas to whether a service should be both supply and combat. Perhaps the\r\nbest answer to that question is that so organized Chemical Warfare\r\nwas a success in the World War. It was a success notwithstanding it\r\nhad to be developed in the field six months after our entry into\r\nthe war and with no precedents, no materials, no literature and no\r\npersonnel. Through its officers on the staffs of commanding generals\r\nof armies, corps and divisions, and through its fighting gas troops in\r\nthe front line, it was enabled to direct its research, development and\r\nmanufacture more quickly along lines shown to be necessary by every\r\nchange in battle conditions, than any other service.\r\n\r\n=Chemical Warfare Troops.= And why should there not be fighting\r\nChemical Warfare troops? They fight under exactly the same orders as\r\nall other troops. They conform to the same general plan of battle. They\r\nbring, however, to that battle experts in a line that it takes a long\r\ntime to master. And where has there been any live commander in the\r\nworld’s history who refused aid from any class of troops that might\r\nhelp him win?\r\n\r\n=Specialists in War.= The wars of the future will become more and more\r\nwars of the specialists. Your Infantry may remain the backbone of the\r\nfighting force, but if it has not the Artillery, the Aviation, the\r\nChemical Warfare, the Engineers, the tanks and other specialists to\r\nback it up, it will be overcome by the army which has such specialists.\r\nIndeed the specialist goes into the very organization of the Infantry\r\nitself with its machine gun battalions, its tank battalions, and as now\r\nproposed, the Infantry light howitzer companies.\r\n\r\n=Duties of Chemical Warfare Staff Officers.= The Chemical Warfare\r\nofficers on the staff of armies, corps and divisions are there for\r\nthe purpose of giving expert advice as to the quantities of chemical\r\nmaterials available, the best conditions for using them, and the best\r\nway of avoiding the effects of enemy gas upon our own troops. The\r\nconditions that must be kept in mind are so many that no other officer\r\ncan be expected to master and keep them if he does his own work well.\r\nThe general staff officers and commanding generals will not have the\r\ntime to even try to remember the actual effects of clouds, wind, rain,\r\ntrees, valleys, villages and plains upon each and every gas. They must\r\ndepend upon the Chemical Warfare officer for accurate information\r\nalong those lines, and if he cannot furnish it they will have to\r\nsecure some one who can. The history of war is filled with the names\r\nof generals who failed because they could not forget how to command a\r\ncompany. These Chemical Warfare officers will also furnish all data\r\nas to supply of chemical warfare materials, and will furnish the best\r\ninformation along lines of training, whether for defensive or offensive\r\nuse of gas.\r\n\r\n=Gas Used by all Arms.= As before stated, we cannot confine the use\r\nof gas to any one arm. We may then ask why, if it is applicable to\r\nall arms, it should need special gas troops. Special gas troops are\r\nfor the purpose of putting off great quantities of chemical warfare\r\nmaterials by special methods that are not applicable to any other\r\nbranch now organized or that any other branch has the time to master.\r\nLong-range firing of gas by the artillery can be done just as well by\r\nthe artillery as by gas troops. Why? Because in the mechanics of firing\r\nchemical ammunition there is no difference whatever from the mechanics\r\nof firing high explosives or shrapnel. The same will be true of gas\r\nrifle grenades and smoke candles in use by the Infantry. The same will\r\nbe true of the dropping of gas bombs and the sprinkling of gas by the\r\naeroplanes. In this connection just remember that all of the army is\r\ntrained in first aid, but in addition we have our ambulance companies,\r\nour hospitals, and our trained medical personnel.\r\n\r\n=Arguments Against Use of Gas.= It has been many times suggested\r\nsince the Armistice that the use of poisonous gas in war may be done\r\naway with by agreement among nations. The arguments against the use\r\nof gas are that it is inhumane and that it might be used against\r\nnon-combatants, especially women and children. The inhumanity of it is\r\nabsolutely disproven by the results of its use in the World War. The\r\ndeath rate from gas alone was less than one-twelfth that from bullets,\r\nhigh explosives and other methods of warfare. The disability rate for\r\ngas patients discharged was only about one-fourth that for the wounded\r\ndischarged for other causes. The permanently injured is likewise\r\napparently very much less than from other causes.\r\n\r\n=Humanity.= No reliable statistics that we can get show that gas in\r\nany way causes tuberculosis any more than a severe attack of bronchitis\r\nor pneumonia causes tuberculosis. Since its principal effects are\r\nupon the lungs and, therefore, hidden from sight, every impostor is\r\nbeginning to claim gassing as the reason for his wanting War Risk\r\nbenefits from the Government. We do not claim there may not be some\r\nwho are suffering permanent injuries from gas, and we are trying very\r\nhard to find out from the manufacturers of poisonous gases and allied\r\nchemicals if they have any authentic records of such cases. So far the\r\nresults indicate that permanent after-effects are very rare.\r\n\r\nAs to non-combatants, certainly we do not contemplate using poisonous\r\ngas against them, no more at least than we propose to use high\r\nexplosives in long-range guns or aeroplanes against them. The use of\r\nthe one against non-combatants is just as damnable as the other and it\r\nis just as easy to refrain from using one as the other.\r\n\r\n=Gas Cannot be Abolished.= As to the abandonment of poison gas, it must\r\nbe remembered that no powerful weapon of war has ever been abandoned\r\nonce it proved its power unless a more powerful weapon was discovered.\r\nPoisonous gas in the World War proved to be one of the most powerful of\r\nall weapons of war. For that reason alone it will never be abandoned.\r\nIt cannot be stopped by agreement, because if you can stop the use\r\nof any one powerful weapon of war by agreement you can stop all war\r\nby agreement. To prepare to use it only in case it is used against\r\nyou is on the same plane as an order that was once upon a time issued\r\nto troops in the Philippine Islands. That order stated in substance\r\nthat no officer or soldier should shoot a savage Moro, even were he\r\napproaching the said officer or soldier with drawn kriss (sword),\r\nunless actually first struck by such savage. Every officer preferred,\r\nif necessary, to face a court-martial for disobedience of such an order\r\nrather than allow a savage Moro with a drawn kriss to get anywhere\r\n_near_, let alone wait until actually struck.\r\n\r\nLet the world know that we propose to use gas against all troops that\r\nmay be engaged against us, and that we propose to use it to the fullest\r\nextent of our ability. We believe that such a proposition will do more\r\nto head off war than all the peace propaganda since time began. It has\r\nbeen said that we should not use gas against those not equipped with\r\ngas. Then why did we use repeating rifles and machine guns against\r\nNegritos and Moros armed only with bows and arrows or poor muskets and\r\nknives. Let us apply the same common sense to the use of gas that we\r\napply to all other weapons of war.\r\n\r\n=Effect on World War Tactics.= A very brief study of the effects of\r\nchemical warfare materials on the strategy of the World War will\r\nindicate its future. It began with clouds of chlorine let loose from\r\nheavy cylinders buried under the firing trench. These took a long time\r\nto install and then a wait, sometimes long, sometimes brief, for a\r\nfavorable wind, but even at that these cloud gas attacks created a new\r\nmethod of fighting and forced new methods of protection. Gas at once\r\nadded a tremendous burden to supply in the field, to manufacture, and\r\nto transportation, and in a short time even made some decided changes\r\nin the tactics of the battle field itself.\r\n\r\n=Cloud Gas.= The fact that the gas cloud looked like smoke is\r\nresponsible for the name “cloud gas.” Really all gases are nearly or\r\nwholly invisible, but those which volatilize suddenly from the liquid\r\nstate so cool the air as to cause clouds of condensed water vapor.\r\nThe cloud obscured everything behind and in front of it. It led the\r\nGerman to put off fake smoke clouds and attack through them, thus\r\ntaking the British at a tremendous disadvantage. Then and there began a\r\nrealization of the value of smoke. Cloud gas was also the real cause of\r\nthe highly organized raid that became common in every army during the\r\nWorld War. The real purpose in the first raids, carried out by means\r\nof the box barrage, was to find out whether or not gas cylinders were\r\nbeing installed in trenches.\r\n\r\nThese raids finally became responsible, in a large measure, for driving\r\nthe old cloud gas off the field of battle. It did not, however, stop\r\nthe British from putting off cloud gas attacks in 1918 by installing\r\ntheir gas cylinders on their light railway cars and then letting the\r\ngas loose from the cylinders while still on the cars. This enabled them\r\nto move their materials to the front and put off gas attacks on a few\r\nhours’ notice when the wind was right.\r\n\r\n=Toxic Smoke Candles.= To-day we have poisonous smokes that exist\r\nin solid form and that are perfectly safe to handle until a fuse is\r\nlighted. The so-called candles will be light enough so that one man can\r\ncarry them. With these, cloud gas can be put off on an hour’s notice\r\nwhen wind and weather conditions are right, no matter how fast the army\r\nmay be moving and whether on the advance or in retreat. Cloud gas will\r\nusually be put off at night because the cloud cannot be seen, because\r\nthen men are tired and sleepy, and all but the most highly trained\r\nbecome panicky. Under those conditions the greatest casualties result.\r\nThe steadiness of wind currents also aids cloud gas attacks at night.\r\n\r\n=Value of Training in Peace.= And this brings up the value of training\r\nin peace. We are frequently asked, “Why do you need training with masks\r\nin peace; why do you need training with actual gas in peace; cannot\r\nthese things be taught on short notice in war?” The answer is, “No!”\r\nNothing will take the place of training in peace.\r\n\r\nAll of us recall that early in the war the Germans spread broadcast\r\ncharges that the Allies were using unfair and inhumane methods of\r\nfighting because they brought the Ghurka with his terrible knife from\r\nAsia and the Moroccan from Africa. And we all know that after a time\r\nthe Germans ceased saying anything about these troops. What was the\r\ncause? They were not efficient. Just as the Negro will follow a white\r\nofficer over the top in daylight and fight with as much energy and\r\ncourage and many times as much efficiency as the white man, he cannot\r\nstand the terrors of the night, and the same was true of the Ghurka and\r\nthe Moroccan.\r\n\r\nAll the Allies soon recognized that fact as shown by their drawing\r\nthose troops almost entirely away from the fighting lines. In some\r\ncases dark-skinned troops were kept only as shock troops to be replaced\r\nby the more highly developed Caucasian when the line had to be held for\r\ndays under the deadly fire of the counter attack. The German idea, and\r\nour own idea prior to the World War, was that semi-savages could stand\r\nthe rigors and terrors of war better than the highly sensitive white\r\nman. War proved that to be utterly false.\r\n\r\n=Familiarity with Gas Necessary.= The same training that makes for\r\nadvancement in science, and success in manufacture in peace, gives the\r\ncontrol of the body that holds the white man to the firing line no\r\nmatter what its terrors. A great deal of this comes because the white\r\nman has had trained out of him nearly all superstition. He has had\r\ndrilled into him for hundreds of years that powder and high explosive\r\ncan do certain things and no more. If the soldier is not to be afraid\r\nof gas we must give him an equal knowledge of it, its dangers, and its\r\nlimitations. The old adage says, “Familiarity breeds contempt.” Perhaps\r\nthat is not quite true, but we all know that it breeds callousness\r\nand forgetfulness; that the man manufacturing dynamite or other more\r\ndangerous explosives takes chances that we who do not engage in such\r\nmanufacture shudder at.\r\n\r\n=Edgewood Chemists Not Afraid.= All of this has direct application\r\nto training with chemical warfare materials in peace. _We believe\r\nthat all opposition to chemical warfare today can be divided into\r\ntwo classes—those who do not understand it and those who are afraid\r\nof it—ignorance and cowardice._ Our chemists at Edgewood Arsenal are\r\nevery day toying with the most powerful chemical compounds; toying with\r\nmixtures they know nothing of, not knowing what instant they may induce\r\nan explosion of some fearful poisonous gas. But they have learned how\r\nto protect themselves. They have learned that if they stop breathing\r\nand get out of that place and on the windward side they are safe. They\r\nhave been at that work long enough to do that automatically.\r\n\r\n=Staff Officers Must Think of Gas in Every Problem.= The staff officer\r\nmust train the army man in peace with all chemical warfare materials\r\nor he will lose his head in war and become a casualty. The general\r\nstaff officers and commanding generals must so familiarize themselves\r\nwith these gases and their general use that they will think them in\r\nall their problems just exactly as they think of the Infantry, or of\r\nthe Cavalry, or of the tanks or of the Artillery in every problem. On\r\nthem rests the responsibility that these gases are used properly in\r\nbattle. If plans before the battle do not include these materials for\r\nevery arm and in the proper quantities of the proper kinds they will\r\nnot be used properly on the field of battle and on them will rest the\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nThey are not expected to know all the details of gases and their uses,\r\nbut they will be expected to consider the use of gas in every phase of\r\npreparing plans and orders and then to appeal to the chemical warfare\r\nofficers for the details that will enable them to use the proper gases\r\nand the proper quantities. They cannot go into those details any more\r\nthan they can go into the details of each company of infantry. If they\r\ntry to do that they are a failure as staff officers.\r\n\r\n=Effect of Masks on Troops.= The very best of masks cause a little\r\ndecrease in vision, a little increase in breathing resistance, and a\r\nlittle added discomfort in warm weather, and hence the soldier must\r\nlearn to use them under all conditions. But above all in the future\r\nhe must be so accustomed to the use of the mask that he will put it\r\non automatically—almost in his sleep as it were. We have tear gases,\r\ntoday, so powerful and so sudden in their action that it is doubtful if\r\none man out of five who has had only a little training can get his mask\r\non if subject to the tear gas alone—that is, with tear gas striking him\r\nwith full force before he is aware of it.\r\n\r\n=Effectiveness of Gas in World War.= In the past war more than 27 out\r\nof every 100 Americans killed and wounded suffered from gas alone. You\r\nmay say that many of the wounds were light. That is true; but those men\r\nwere put out of the battle line for from one to four months—divisions,\r\ncorps and armies almost broken up—and yet the use of gas in that war\r\nwas a child’s game compared to what it will be in the future.\r\n\r\nIt is even said that many of them were malingerers. Perhaps they were,\r\nbut do you not suppose that there were at least as many malingerers\r\namong the enemy as there were in our own ranks? Furthermore, if you can\r\ninduce malingering it is a proper method of waging war, and unless our\r\nboasted ability is all a myth we should have fewer malingerers under\r\nconditions of battle than any other nation.\r\n\r\n=Strategy of Gas at Picardy Plains.= Let us go back now to the strategy\r\nof gas in war. Following the cloud gas came tear gases and poisonous\r\ngases in shells and bombs. A little advance in tactics here and a\r\nlittle there, the idea, though, in the early days being only to produce\r\ncasualties. As usual the Germans awoke first to the fact that gas\r\nmight be used strategically and on a large scale. And thus we find that\r\nten days before he began the battle of Picardy Plains he deluged many\r\nsections of the front with mustard gas. He secured casualties by the\r\nthousands, but he secured something of greater importance. He wore out\r\nthe physical vigor and lowered the morale of division after division,\r\nthus paving the way for the break in the British Army which almost let\r\nhim through to the sea.\r\n\r\nHe used non-persistent gases up to the very moment when his own men\r\nreached the British lines, thereby reducing the efficiency of British\r\nrifle and artillery fire and saving his own men. And this is just a\r\nguide to the future. A recent writer in the _Field Artillery Journal_\r\nstates that gas will probably not be used in the barrage because of its\r\nprobable interference with the movement of our own troops. In making\r\nthat statement he forgot the enemy and you cannot do that if you expect\r\nto win a war.\r\n\r\n=Gas in Barrages.= In the future we must expect the enemy to be in a\r\nmeasure as well prepared in chemical warfare as we are. Let us consider\r\nthe special case of our own men advancing to the attack behind a\r\nrolling barrage. We will consider also that the wind is blowing toward\r\nour own troops. Obviously under those conditions the wind will blow\r\nour own gas back onto our troops. Will we use gas in that barrage? We\r\ncertainly will! Because with the wind blowing toward our own troops\r\nwe have the exact ideal condition that the enemy wants for his use of\r\ngas. He will then be deluging our advancing troops with all the gas he\r\ncan fire, in addition to high explosives and shrapnel. Our men must\r\nwear masks and take every precaution against enemy gas. How foolish\r\nit would be not to fire gas at the enemy under those conditions. If\r\nwe did not fire gas we would leave him entirely free from wearing\r\nmasks, and entirely free from taking every other precaution against\r\ngas while our own troops were subject to all the difficulties of gas.\r\nNo, we will fire gas at him in just as great quantities as we consider\r\nefficient. And that is just a sample of what is coming on every field\r\nof battle—gas used on both sides by every method of putting it over\r\nthat can be devised.\r\n\r\n=World War Lessons Only Guide Posts. Example of Book Worms.= Every\r\nlesson taught by the World War must be taken as a guide-post on the\r\nroad to future success in war. No use of gas or other materials in the\r\npast war must be taken as an exact pattern for use in any battle of\r\nthe future. Too much study, too much attention to the past, may cause\r\nthat very thing to happen. A certain general commanding a brigade in\r\nthe Argonne told me just recently that while the battle was going on a\r\ngeneral staff officer called him on the telephone and asked him what\r\nthe situation was. He gave it to him. The staff officer then asked,\r\n“What are you doing?” and he told him. The staff officer replied, “Why,\r\nthe book doesn’t say to do it that way under such conditions.” There\r\nyou have the absurd side of too much study and too close reliance on\r\ndetails of the past.\r\n\r\nThe battle field is a perfect kaleidoscope. The best we can hope to get\r\nout of books is a guide—something that we will keep in our minds to\r\nhelp us decide the best way to meet certain situations. He who tries\r\nto remember a particular position taught in his school with the idea\r\nof applying that to actual use in battle is laying the foundation for\r\nabsolute failure. Your expert rifleman never thinks back when he goes\r\nto fire a shot as to just what his instructor told him or what the book\r\nsaid. He just concentrates his mind on the object to be attained, using\r\nso far as comes to him facts he has learned from books or teachers.\r\nYour general and your staff must do the same.\r\n\r\n=Infantry Use of Gas.= A few words about how we will use gas in the\r\nfuture. We will start with the Infantry. The Infantry as such will\r\nuse gas in only two or three ways. They will use some gas in rifle\r\ngrenades, and a great deal more smoke. We speak of the rifle grenade\r\nbecause in our opinion the hand grenade is a thing of the past. We do\r\nnot believe there will ever be used in the future any grenade that is\r\nnot applicable to the rifle. The Infantry will probably often carry\r\nlarge quantities of gas in the shape of the toxic smoke candle. These\r\nmaterials being solids may be shot up by rifles or artillery fire, run\r\nover by trucks or tractors, or trampled and still be harmless. It is\r\nonly when the fuses are lighted and the material driven off by heat\r\nthat they are dangerous. In using these candles under these conditions\r\nyou must have sufficient chemical warfare officers and soldiers to get\r\nthe necessary control indicated by the sun, wind, woods, fogs, ravines\r\nand the like.\r\n\r\n=Cavalry Use of Gas.= Next consider the Cavalry. The Cavalry will use\r\ngas practically the same as the Infantry. The chemical warfare troops\r\nwill accompany the Cavalry with Stokes’ mortars or other materials\r\nto fire gases into small enemy strongholds that may be encountered\r\nwhether machine gun nests, mountain tops, woods or villages. They will\r\ndo this either against savages or civilized people. Methods of making\r\nthese materials mobile for that purpose are already well under way. If\r\nagainst savages and one does not want to kill them, use tear gases—no\r\nbetter method of searching out hidden snipers in mountain tops, among\r\nrocks, or villages, in ravines, or in forests was ever invented.\r\n\r\n=Use of Gas by Tanks.= The tanks will employ gas in the same way as\r\nthe Infantry with the possibility, however, that they may be used to\r\ncarry large quantities of gas on caterpillar tractors where otherwise\r\nit would be difficult to move the gas. This is not a certainty, but is\r\na situation promising enough to warrant further study.\r\n\r\n=Artillery Use of Gas.= Your Artillery will fire gas and smoke in every\r\ncaliber of gun. There is a tendency now to limit gas to certain guns\r\nand howitzers and to limit smoke to even a smaller number of guns. This\r\nis a mistake that we are going to recognize. A very careful study of\r\nthe records of the war show that more casualties were produced several\r\ntimes over by a thousand gas shells than by a thousand high explosive\r\nor shrapnel. And that is because gas has an inherent permanence that no\r\nother weapon of war has.\r\n\r\n=Permanency of Gas.= The bullet whistles through the air and does its\r\nwork or misses. The high explosive shell bursts, hurling its fragments\r\nthat in a few seconds settle to earth, and its work is done. The\r\nshrapnel acts in the same way, but when one turns loose a shell of gas\r\nit will kill and injure the same as the high explosive shell and in the\r\nsame length of time and in addition for some minutes thereafter. Even\r\nwith the non-persistent gases, it will continue on its way, causing\r\ndeath or injury to every unprotected animal, man or beast in its path.\r\nWith the persistent gases, the materials from each shell may persist\r\nfor days.\r\n\r\n=Variety of Uses of Gas.= This brings up the point of the great variety\r\nof uses to which gas can be put. The non-persistent gas may be used\r\nat all times where one wants to get rid of it in a few moments—the\r\npersistent gas wherever one wants to keep the enemy under gas for days\r\nat a time. We will use mustard gas on strong points in the advance,\r\non flanks, on distant areas one will not expect to be reached, and as\r\nour own protection of masks and clothing increases toward perfection\r\nwe will use it on the very fields you expect to cross. Why? Because we\r\nwill be firing it at the enemy for days before hand and we will cause\r\nhim trouble all those days while we ourselves will encounter it for a\r\nfew hours at the most. So do not think that mustard gas is only going\r\nto be used in defense in the future.\r\n\r\n=Solid Mustard Gas and Long-Range Guns.= We will come to use chemical\r\nwarfare materials just as high explosives and bullets are used today,\r\neven though at times we do suffer an occasional loss from our own\r\nweapons. Our Artillery in long-range guns where we want destruction\r\nwill fill each shell with say 15 per cent gas and 85 per cent high\r\nexplosive. We have a solid mustard gas that may be so used. We have\r\ntremendously powerful tear gases and irritating gases that may be so\r\nused. Being solids they do not affect the ballistic qualities of the\r\nshell. And what an added danger will mustard gas from every shell bring\r\nagainst railroad centers, rest villages, cantonments, cross-roads and\r\nthe like. The results will be too great for any force to overlook such\r\nuse.\r\n\r\n=Tear Gases in Shrapnel.= We will probably use tear gas in most, if\r\nnot all, of our shrapnel. The general idea now is that we should not\r\nput tear gas in all shrapnel because under certain conditions it will\r\nbe blown back and harass our own troops. But as was said before, we\r\nmust remember that the enemy will be using gas at all times as well\r\nas ourselves, and hence if we limit ourselves in any line we give the\r\nenemy an advantage. This use of gas by the Artillery will extend to all\r\nclasses of guns—seacoast, field, turret and what not.\r\n\r\n=Use of Gas by Air Service.= _Bombs._ Let us next consider the Air\r\nService. We naturally think of dropping gas in bombs when we speak of\r\nthe use of gas by the Air Service. Gas will so be used and it will be\r\nused in bombs of perhaps a thousand pounds or even a ton in weight,\r\nat least 50 per cent of which will be gas. Such gases, however, will\r\nbe of the non-persistent type—phosgene or similar ones. They will be\r\nused against concentration camps and cross-roads, on troops on the road\r\nin columns; against railroad centers and rest areas; in other words,\r\nagainst groups of men or animals.\r\n\r\n_Sprinkling._ But that is not even the beginning of the use of gas by\r\naeroplanes. Mustard gas, which is one-third again as heavy as water,\r\nand which volatilizes far slower than water, may be sprinkled through\r\na small opening such as a bung hole in a tank that simply lets liquid\r\nfloat out. The speed of the aeroplane will atomize it. In this way,\r\ngas can be sprinkled over whole areas that must be crossed in battle.\r\nThe Lewisite, of which we have heard considerable, will be used. It is\r\nless persistent than the mustard gas, but like mustard gas it produces\r\ncasualties by burning. Unlike mustard gas, however, the burns from a\r\nquantity equal to three drops will usually cause death. The material\r\ncan be made up by hundreds, even thousands, of tons per month.\r\n\r\nWe are working on clothing that will keep it out just as we have been\r\nand are working on clothing that will protect against mustard gas.\r\nBut these gases are so powerful that if any opening be left in the\r\nclothing the gas will get through, so that even if we get clothing that\r\nwill protect, it must cover every inch of the skin from head to foot.\r\nBesides the mask must be worn at all times.\r\n\r\nConsider the burden put on any army in the field that would have\r\nto continually wear such complete protection. What a strain on the\r\nmentality of the men! As before said, to endure it at all we must train\r\nour men to think of such conditions, to face them in peace, and in\r\norder to do so we must actually use gas. Just as in the World War the\r\nhighly trained Caucasian outdistanced the savage in endurance, just so\r\nwill the most highly trained men in the future outdistance all others\r\nin endurance.\r\n\r\n=Navy.= We now come to the consideration of the Navy. The Navy will use\r\ngas both in its guns and in smoke clouds, and in some form of candle\r\nthat will float. The toxic smokes that in high enough concentrations\r\nwill kill are extraordinarily irritating in minute quantities—so minute\r\nthey cannot be seen or felt for a few moments. Every human being on a\r\nship must breathe every minute just as every human being everywhere\r\nmust breathe every minute or die. A gas that gets into the ventilating\r\nsystem of a ship will go all through it and the Navy realizes it.\r\n\r\nThe Navy is studying how to keep the gas out of their own ships, and\r\nhow to get it into the enemy’s ships. The toxic smokes may be dropped\r\nfrom aeroplanes or turned loose from under water by submarines. In\r\neither case they will give off smokes over wide areas through which\r\nships must pass. Any defects will let these toxic smokes in and will\r\nforce every man to wear a mask. Aeroplane bombs will come raining\r\ndown on the ship or alongside of it either with toxic smokes or other\r\nterrible gases. White phosphorus that burns and cannot be put out wet\r\nor dry will be rained on ships. Yes, chemical warfare materials will be\r\nused by the Navy.\r\n\r\n=Gas Against Landing Parties.= The use of gas against landing parties\r\nor to aid landing parties has come up in many ways. Our studies to date\r\nindicate that gas is a greater advantage to the defense against landing\r\nparties than to the offense. Mustard gas and the like may be sprinkled\r\nfrom aeroplanes, and while it will not float long on the water, it\r\nwill float long enough to smear any small boats attempting to land. It\r\ncan be sprinkled over all the areas that landing parties must occupy.\r\nMustard gas may be placed in bombs or drums around all areas that are\r\napt to be used as landing places and exploded in the face of advancing\r\ntroops.\r\n\r\n=Storing Reserve Gases in Peace.= And a word here about how long gases\r\nmay be stored. One of the statements made by opponents of chemical\r\nwarfare was that gas is a purely war time project and could not be\r\nstored up in peace. We have today at Edgewood Arsenal some 1,400 tons\r\nof poisonous gases not including chlorine. Those gases have been\r\nmanufactured, practically every ounce of them, for three years, and\r\nare yet in almost perfect condition. Our chemists believe they can be\r\nkept in the future for ten years and perhaps longer. Our gas shells\r\nthen will have the life almost of a modern battleship, while the cost\r\nof a million will be but a fraction of the cost of a battleship. What I\r\nhave just said applies particularly to liquid gases such as phosgene,\r\nchlorpicrin, and mustard gas. We know that many of the solids may be\r\nkept for far longer periods.\r\n\r\n=Storing Gas Masks.= Our masks, too, we believe can be kept for at\r\nleast ten years. Experience to date indicates that rubber deteriorates\r\nmainly through the action of sunlight and moisture that cause oxidation\r\nor other change in the crystalline structure of cured rubber.\r\nAccordingly, we are putting up masks today in hermetically sealed\r\nboxes. It is thus evident that we can store a reserve of masks and\r\ngases in peace the same as other war materials.\r\n\r\n=Use of Gas by Gas Troops.= Now we come to the use of gas by special\r\ngas troops. In the war, Gas Troops used 4-inch Stokes’ mortars and\r\n8-inch Livens’ projectors and in a very short time would have used a\r\nnew portable cylinder for setting off cloud gas, using liquid gases,\r\nsuch as phosgene. They will use these same weapons in future wars.\r\nAll of these are short-range weapons, but since the Livens’ bomb or\r\ndrum contains 50 per cent of its weight in gas while the artillery\r\nshell contains 10 per cent, they have an efficiency away beyond that\r\nof artillery or any other method of discharging gas except cloud gas.\r\nThey will, therefore, produce more casualties than any other method\r\nknown for the amount of material taken to the front. These short-range\r\nweapons were developed by the British for trench use and not for open\r\nwarfare, and yet our troops developed methods with the Stokes’ mortars\r\nthat enabled them to keep up with many of the Infantry divisions.\r\n\r\n=Phosphorus and Thermit Against Machine Gun Nests.= The use of\r\nphosphorus and thermit against German machine gun nests by the Gas\r\nTroops is well known. How effective it was is not known to so many.\r\nPhosphorus and thermit were so used from the early days of the Marne\r\nfight in the latter part of July, 1918, to the very close of the war.\r\nThere is no recorded instance where the Gas Troops failed to silence\r\nmachine gun nests once the machine guns were located. In the future Gas\r\nTroops will put off the majority of all cloud gas attacks even with\r\ntoxic smoke candles.\r\n\r\n=Necessity for Training in Peace.= This is an outline of the subject\r\nof chemical warfare. As stated in the beginning, the fundamental\r\nunderlying principles for the successful use of poisonous gas is\r\nnecessarily the same as for any other war materials. The necessity\r\nfor continuous training in peace is just the same with chemical\r\nwarfare as with the rifle, the machine gun, with field artillery or\r\nany other weapon of war. Indeed it is more so because the use of gas\r\nis so perfectly adaptable to night work. Men must be taught to take\r\nprecautionary measures when so sleepy, tired and worn out that they\r\nwill sleep through the roar of artillery.\r\n\r\n=How Chemical Warfare Should be Considered.= We ask you only to look\r\nat the use of chemical warfare materials as you look at the use of\r\nthe artillery, infantry, cavalry, tanks or aeroplanes. Measure its\r\npossible future use; not simply by its use in the World War, but by\r\nconsidering all possible developments of the future. Remember that its\r\nuse was barely four years old when the war closed, while the machine\r\ngun, the latest type of infantry weapon, had been known for more than\r\none-third of a century. Chemical warfare developments are in the infant\r\nstage. Even those on the inside of chemical warfare when the Armistice\r\nwas signed can see today things that are certain to come that were\r\nundreamed of at that time. This is bound to be so with a new weapon.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, gas is a universal weapon, applicable to every arm and every\r\nsort of action. Since we can choose gases that are either liquid or\r\nsolid, that are irritating only or highly poisonous, that are visible\r\nor invisible, that persist for days or that pass with the wind, we have\r\na weapon applicable to every act of war and for that matter, to every\r\nact of peace. But we must _plan_ its use, remembering there is no\r\nmiddle ground in war, it is success or failure, life or death. Remember\r\nalso that training outruns production in a great war, that 5,000,000\r\nmen can be raised and trained before they can be equipped unless we\r\nwith proper foresight build up our essential industries, keep up our\r\nreserve of supplies, and above all, keep such perfect plans that we\r\ncan turn all the wheels of peace into the wings of war on a moment’s\r\nnotice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nTHE OFFENSIVE USE OF GAS\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT CHEMICAL WARFARE INCLUDES\r\n\r\nChemical Warfare includes all gas, smoke and incendiary materials and\r\nall defensive appliances, of which the mask is the principal item, used\r\nby the Army. Some of the items or materials in both offense and defense\r\nare used by the entire Army, while a few are used only by Chemical\r\nWarfare troops.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TERM “GAS”\r\n\r\nThe term “gas” is now taken to include all materials that are carried\r\nto the enemy by the air, after their liberation from cylinders, bombs\r\nor shell. It is necessary that this broad use of the term “gas” be\r\nthoroughly understood, because some of these materials are solids,\r\nwhile all others are liquids, until liberated from the containers at\r\nthe time of the attack. These containers may be special cylinders for\r\ncloud gas attacks, special bombs for Livens’ projectors and mortars,\r\nor artillery shell, and even aviation bombs. Some of the liquids which\r\nhave a very low boiling point volatilize quickly upon exposure to air,\r\nand hence require only enough explosive to open the shell and allow the\r\nliquid to escape. Practically all solids have to be pulverized by a\r\nlarge amount of high explosive, or driven off as smoke by some heating\r\nmixture.\r\n\r\n\r\nTECHNICAL NATURE\r\n\r\nChemical warfare, besides being the newest, is the most technical and\r\nmost highly specialized Service under the War Department. There is\r\nno class of people in civil life, and no officers or men in the War\r\nDepartment, who can take up chemical warfare successfully until they\r\nhave received training in its use. This applies not only to the use of\r\nmaterials in attack, but to the use of materials for defense. Ten years\r\nfrom now perhaps this will not be true. It is certainly hoped that it\r\nwill not be. By that time the entire Army should be pretty thoroughly\r\ntrained in the general principles and many of the special features\r\nof chemical warfare. If not, chemical warfare cannot be used in the\r\nfield with the efficiency and success with which it deserves to be\r\nused. Furthermore, it is believed that within ten years the knowledge\r\nof the gases used in chemical warfare will be so common through the\r\ndevelopment of the use of these same materials in civil life, that it\r\nwill not be so difficult, as at the present date, to get civilians who\r\nare acquainted with Chemical Warfare Service materials.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFECTIVENESS OF GAS\r\n\r\nChemical warfare materials were used during the war by Chemical Warfare\r\nService troops, by the Artillery and by the Infantry. In the future\r\nthe Air Service and Navy will be added to the above list. Chemical\r\nwarfare, even under the inelastic methods of the Germans, proved one\r\nof the most powerful means of offense with which the American troops\r\nhad to contend. To realize its effectiveness we need only remember\r\nthat more than 27 out of every 100 casualties on the field of battle\r\nwere from gas alone. Unquestionably many of those who died on the\r\nbattlefield from other causes suffered also from gas. No other single\r\nelement of war, unless you call powder a basic element, accounted for\r\nso many casualties among the American troops. Indeed, it is believed\r\nthat a greater number of casualties was not inflicted by any other arm\r\nof the Service, unless possibly the Infantry, and even in that case it\r\nwould be necessary to account for all injured by bullets, the bayonet,\r\nmachine guns and hand grenades. This is true, in spite of the fact\r\nthat the German was so nearly completely out of gas when the Americans\r\nbegan their offensive at St. Mihiel and the Argonne, that practically\r\nno gas casualties occurred during the St. Mihiel offensive, and only a\r\nvery few until after a week of the Argonne fighting. Furthermore, the\r\nGermans knew that an extensive use of mustard gas against the American\r\nlines on the day the attack was made, and also on the line that marked\r\nthe end of the first advance a few days later, would have produced\r\ntremendous casualties. Judging from the results achieved at other times\r\nby an extensive use of mustard gas, it is believed that had the German\r\npossessed this gas and used it as he had used it a few other times,\r\nAmerican casualties in the Argonne would have been doubled. In fact,\r\nthe advance might even have been entirely stopped, thus prolonging the\r\nwar into the year 1919.\r\n\r\n\r\nHUMANITY OF GAS\r\n\r\nA few words right here about the humanity of gas are not out of\r\nplace, notwithstanding the Army and the general public have now so\r\ncompletely indorsed chemical warfare that it is believed the argument\r\nof inhumanity has no weight whatever. There were three great reasons\r\nwhy chemical warfare was first widely advertised throughout the world\r\nas inhumane and horrible. These reasons may be summed up as follows:\r\n\r\nIn the first place, the original gas used at Ypres in 1915 was\r\nchlorine, and chlorine is one of a group of gases known as\r\nsuffocants—gases that cause death generally by suffocating the patient\r\nthrough spasms of the epiglottis and throat. That is the most agonizing\r\neffect produced by any gas.\r\n\r\nThe second reason was unpreparedness. The English had no masks, no\r\ngas-proof dugouts, nor any of the other paraphernalia that was later\r\nemployed to protect against poisonous gas. Consequently, the death rate\r\nin the first gas attack at Ypres was very high, probably 35 per cent.\r\nAs a matter of fact, every man who was close to the front line died.\r\nThe only ones who escaped were those on the edges of the cloud of gas\r\nor so far to the rear that the concentration had decreased below the\r\ndeadly point.\r\n\r\nThe third great reason was simply propaganda. It was good war\r\npropaganda to impress upon everybody the fact that the German was\r\ncapable of using any means that he could develop in order to win a\r\nvictory. He had no respect for previous agreements or ideas concerning\r\nwarfare. This propaganda kept up the morale and fighting spirit of the\r\nAllies, and was thoroughly justifiable upon that score, even when it\r\nled to wild exaggeration.\r\n\r\nThe chlorine used in the first attack by the German is the least\r\npoisonous of the gases now used. Those later introduced, such as\r\nphosgene, mustard gas and diphenylchloroarsine are from five to ten\r\ntimes as effective.\r\n\r\nThe measure of humanity for any form of warfare is the percentage of\r\ndeaths to the total number injured by the particular method of warfare\r\nunder consideration.\r\n\r\n=American Gas Casualties.= The official list of casualties in battle as\r\ncompiled by the Surgeon General’s office covering all cases reported up\r\nto September 1, 1919, is 258,338. Of these 70,752, or 27.4 per cent,\r\nwere gas casualties. Also of the above casualties 46,519 resulted in\r\ndeath, of whom about 1,400 only were due to gas. From these figures it\r\nis readily deduced that while 24.85 per cent of all casualties from\r\nbullets and high explosives resulted in death, only 2 per cent of those\r\nwounded by gas resulted in death. That is, a man wounded on the battle\r\nfield with gas had twelve times as many chances of recovery as the man\r\nwho was wounded with bullets and high explosives.\r\n\r\n\r\nFUNDAMENTALS OF CHEMICAL WARFARE\r\n\r\nBefore taking up in some detail the methods of projecting gas upon the\r\nenemy, it is very desirable to understand the fundamentals of chemical\r\nwarfare, in so far as they pertain to poisonous gases. Following the\r\nfirst use of pure chlorine all the principal nations engaged in the\r\nwar began investigations into a wide range of substances in the hope\r\nof finding others more poisonous, more easily produced, and more\r\nreadily projected upon the enemy. These investigations led to the use\r\nof a large number of gases which seriously complicated manufacture,\r\nsupply, and the actual use of the gases in the field. Gradually a more\r\nrational conception of chemical warfare led both the Allies and the\r\nenemy to restrict the numbers of gases to a comparative few, and still\r\nlater to divide all gases into three groups. Thus the German divided\r\nhis into three groups known as (1) Green Cross, the highly poisonous\r\nnon-persistent gases, (2) Blue Cross, or diphenylchloroarsine,\r\npopularly known as sneezing gas, and (3) Yellow Cross, highly\r\npersistent gases, such as mustard gas. In the American Chemical Warfare\r\nService we have finally divided all gases into two primary groups.\r\nThese groups are known as “Non-persistent” and “Persistent.” The\r\n“Non-persistent” gases are those quickly volatilizing upon exposure\r\nto the air, and hence those that are carried away at once by air\r\ncurrents, or that in a dead calm will be completely dissipated into\r\nthe surrounding air in a few hours. If sufficient high explosive be\r\nused to pulverize solids, they may be used in the same way, and to a\r\nlarge extent certain highly persistent liquid gases may have their\r\npersistency greatly reduced by using a large amount of high explosive,\r\nwhich divides the liquid into a fine spray. The “Persistent” group\r\nconstitutes those gases that are very slowly volatilized upon exposure\r\nto the atmosphere. The principal ones of these now used or proposed are\r\nmustard gas and bromobenzylcyanide. For purposes of economy, and hence\r\nefficiency, certain gases, both persistent and non-persistent, are\r\nplaced in a third group known as the “Irritant Group.” These gases are\r\neffective in extremely low concentrations against the lungs and other\r\nair passages, or the eyes. Diphenylchloroarsine, and some other solids\r\nwhen divided into minute particles by high explosive or heat, irritate\r\nthe nose, throat and lungs to such an extent in a concentration of\r\none part in ten millions of air as to be unbearable in a few minutes.\r\nThe tear gases are equally powerful in their effects on the eyes. The\r\nirritating gases are used to force the wearing of the mask, which in\r\nturn reduces the physical vigor and efficiency of the troops. This\r\nreduction in efficiency, even with the best masks, is probably 25 per\r\ncent for short periods, and much more if prolonged wearing of the mask\r\nis forced.\r\n\r\n\r\nEFFICIENCY OF IRRITANT GASES\r\n\r\nOne pound of the irritant gases is equal to 500 to 1,000 pounds of\r\nother gases when forcing the wearing of the mask alone is desired. The\r\ngreat economy resulting from their use is thus apparent. Due to the\r\nrapid evaporation of the non-persistent gases they are used generally\r\nonly in dense clouds, whether those clouds be produced from cylinders\r\nor from bombs. These gases are used only for producing immediate\r\ncasualties, as the necessary amount of gas to force the enemy to\r\nconstantly wear his mask by the use of non-persistent gases alone could\r\nnot possibly be taken to the front.\r\n\r\nMustard gas, which is highly persistent and also attacks the lungs,\r\neyes and skin of the body, may and will be used to force the wearing\r\nof the mask. It has one disadvantage when it is desired to force\r\nimmediately the wearing of the mask, and that is its delayed action\r\nand the fact that it acts so slowly, and is usually encountered in\r\nsuch slight concentrations that several hours’ exposure are necessary\r\nto produce a severe casualty. For these reasons the enemy may often\r\ntake chances in the heat of battle with mustard gas, and while himself\r\nbecoming a casualty, inflict quite heavy casualties upon opposing\r\ntroops by continuing to operate his guns or rifles without masks. A\r\npowerful tear gas on the other hand forces the immediate wearing of the\r\nmask.\r\n\r\n\r\nMATERIAL OF CHEMICAL WARFARE USED BY C. W. S. TROOPS\r\n\r\nChemical warfare troops, in making gas attacks, use cylinders for the\r\ncloud or wave attack, and the Livens’ projector and the 4-inch Stokes’\r\nmortar for attacks with heavy concentrations of gas projected by bombs\r\nwith ranges up to a mile. This distance will in the future probably\r\nbe increased to 1½ or 1¾ miles. The original cylinders used in wave\r\nattacks were heavy, cumbersome and very laborious to install, and\r\nnotwithstanding the wave attack was known to be the deadliest form of\r\ngas attack used in the war, fell into disrepute after the use of gas\r\nbecame general in artillery shells and in special bombs.\r\n\r\n=Cloud Gas.= The Americans at once concluded that since cloud gas\r\nattacks were so effective, efforts should be made to make these attacks\r\nof frequent occurrence by decreasing the weight of the cylinders, and\r\nby increasing the portability and methods of discharging the cylinders.\r\nAs early as March, 1918, specifications for cylinders weighing not more\r\nthan 65 pounds, filled and completely equipped for firing, were cabled\r\nto the United States. They would have been used in large numbers in\r\nthe campaign of 1919 had the enemy not quit when he did. Toxic smoke\r\ncandles that are filled with solids driven off by heat will probably\r\nbe the actual method in the future for putting off cloud attacks. The\r\ntoxic smoke candle is perfectly safe under all conditions and can\r\nbe made in any size desired. Cloud gas attacks will be common in\r\nthe future, and all plans of defense must be made accordingly. They\r\nwill usually be made at night, when, due to fatigue and the natural\r\nsleepiness which comes at that time, men are careless, lose their way,\r\nor neglect their masks, and are thus caught unprepared. Experience in\r\nthe war proved that a wave attack always produced casualties even, as\r\nseveral times occurred, when the enemy or the Allied troops knew some\r\nhours beforehand that the attack was coming. The English estimated\r\nthese casualties to be 10 or 11 per cent of the troops exposed.\r\n\r\n=Livens’ Projectors.= The second most effective weapon for using gas\r\nby gas troops was and will be the Livens’ projector. This projector is\r\nnothing less than the simplest form of mortar, consisting of a straight\r\ndrawn steel tube and a steel base plate. As used during the World War\r\nby the Allies it did not even have a firing pin or other mechanism in\r\nthe base, the electric wires for firing passing out through the muzzle\r\nand alongside the drum or projectile which was small enough to permit\r\nthat method of firing. These were set by the hundreds, very close\r\nbehind or even in front of the front line trenches. They were all fired\r\nat the same instant, or as nearly at the same instant as watches could\r\nbe synchronized, and firing batteries operated. As discussed on page 18\r\nthese mortars were emplaced deep enough in the ground to bring their\r\nmuzzles practically level with the surface. It usually took several\r\ndays to prepare the attack, and consequently allowed an opportunity\r\nfor the enemy to detect the work by aeroplane photographs or by raids,\r\nand destroy the emplacements by artillery fire. It should be added,\r\nhowever, that notwithstanding this apparent great difficulty, very\r\nfew attacks were broken up in that way. Nevertheless, in line with\r\nthe general policy of the American troops to get away from anything\r\nthat savored of trench warfare, and to make the fighting as nearly\r\ncontinuous as possible with every means available, the American\r\nChemical Warfare Service set at work at once to develop an easy method\r\nof making projector attacks.\r\n\r\nIt was early found, that, if the excavation was made just deep enough\r\nso that the base plate could be set at the proper angle, the drums or\r\nprojectiles were fired as accurately as when the projectors or mortars\r\nwere set so that the muzzles were level with the surface. The time\r\nrequired to emplace a given number of mortars in this way was only\r\nabout one-fifth of that required for digging them completely in.\r\n\r\nCoupled of course with these proposed improvements in methods, studies\r\nwere being made and are still being made to produce lighter mortars,\r\nbetter powder charges, and better gas checks in order to develop the\r\nfull force of the powder. Many improvements along this line can be\r\nmade, all of which will result in greater mobility, more frequent\r\nattacks, and hence greater efficiency.\r\n\r\n=4-Inch Stokes’ Mortar.= The Stokes’ mortar is not different from that\r\nused by the Infantry, except that it is 4-inch, while the Infantry\r\nStokes’ is 3-inch. The 4-inch was chosen by the British for gas, as\r\nit was the largest caliber that could be fired rapidly and yet be\r\nmoderately mobile. Its range of only about 1,100 yards handicapped\r\nit considerably. The poor design of the bomb was partly responsible\r\nfor this. The powder charges also were neither well chosen nor well\r\ndesigned. It is believed that great improvements can be made in the\r\nshape of the bomb and in the powder charge, which will result in much\r\nlonger range and high efficiency, while in no way increasing the weight\r\nof the bomb or decreasing the rate of fire. These last two weapons\r\nwere used during the World War, and will be very extensively used in\r\nthe future for firing high explosive, phosphorus, thermit and similar\r\nmaterials that non-technical troops might handle.\r\n\r\nSince gas has proven without the shadow of a doubt, that it will\r\nproduce more casualties for an equal amount of material transported to\r\nthe front than any other substance yet devised, all troops using short\r\nrange guns or mortars should be trained to fire gas whenever weather\r\nconditions are right. When weather conditions are not right, they\r\nshould fire the other substances mentioned. The Livens’ projector with\r\nits 60 pound bomb, of which 30 pounds will be gas or high explosive,\r\nis a wonderful gun up to the limit of its range. The bomb, not being\r\npointed, does not sink into the ground, and hence upon exploding exerts\r\nthe full force of high explosive upon the surroundings, whether bombs,\r\npill boxes, barbed wire or trenches, to say nothing of personnel.\r\n\r\n=High Explosive in Projectors.= When these are burst by the hundreds on\r\na small area everything movable is blotted out. Thus concrete machine\r\ngun emplacements, lookout stations, bomb-proofs and wire entanglements\r\nare destroyed, trenches filled up, and the personnel annihilated. This\r\nwas amply demonstrated on the few occasions when it was actually used\r\nat the front. The American Infantry, wherever they saw it tried out,\r\nwere wild to have more of it used. The German was apparently equally\r\nanxious to have the use stopped. It is, however, one of the things\r\nthat must be reckoned with in the future. It means practically that No\r\nMan’s Land in the future will be just as wide as the extreme range of\r\nthese crude mortars—and here a word of caution. While efforts have been\r\nmade to increase the range of these mortars, whether of the Livens’\r\nprojector or Stokes’ variety, no further increase will be attempted\r\nwhen that increase reduces the speed of firing or the efficiency of\r\nthe projectile. In other words results depend upon large quantities of\r\nmaterial delivered at the same instant on the point attacked, and if\r\nthis cannot be obtained the method is useless. For this reason these\r\nmortars will never be a competitor of the artillery. The artillery will\r\nhave all that it can do to cover the field within its range—beyond that\r\nreached by the mortars.\r\n\r\n=Phosphorus in 4-Inch Stokes.= Phosphorus will be used largely by gas\r\ntroops, but only in the 4-inch or other Stokes’ mortar that may be\r\nfinally adopted as best. The Livens’ projector carries too great a\r\nquantity, and being essentially a single shot gun, is not adapted to\r\nkeeping up a smoke screen by slow and continued firing, or of being\r\ntransported so as to keep up with the Infantry. Phosphorus has also\r\nvery great value for attacking personnel itself. Any one who has been\r\nburned with phosphorus or has witnessed the ease with which it burns\r\nwhen exposed to air, wet or dry, has a most wholesome fear of it. The\r\nresult of it in the war showed that the enemy machine gunners or other\r\ntroops would not stand up under a bombardment of phosphorus fired from\r\nthe 4-inch Stokes’ mortar—each bomb containing about seven pounds.\r\n\r\n=Thermit.= Thermit is used in the same way, and while the idea of\r\nmolten metal, falling upon men and burning through clothing and even\r\nhelmets, is attractive in theory, it proved absolutely worthless for\r\nthose purposes on the field of battle. It was found impossible to throw\r\nsufficiently large quantities of molten metal on a given spot to cause\r\nany considerable burn. In other words, the rapid spreading out and\r\ncooling of the metal almost entirely ruined its effectiveness, except\r\nits effect on the morale. This latter, however, was considerable, as\r\none might judge from seeing the thermit shells burst in air. For this\r\nreason thermit may find a limited use in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SPREAD OF GAS\r\n\r\n=Height of Gas Cloud.= The height to which gas rises in a gas cloud\r\nis not exactly known, but it is believed to be not much more than\r\nfifty feet, and then only at a considerable distance from the point of\r\ndischarge. Moving pictures taken of gas clouds show this to be true. It\r\nis also indicated by the fact that pigeons, which are very susceptible\r\nto poisonous gas, practically always return to their cages safely when\r\nliberated in a gas cloud. This was a good deal of a mystery until it\r\nwas realized that the pigeon escaped through his rising so quickly\r\nabove the gas. This of course would be expected when it is known that\r\npractically all gases successfully used were two or more times as heavy\r\nas air. Such gases rise only by slow diffusion, or when carried upwards\r\nby rising currents. The absence of these upward currents at night is\r\none of the reasons why gas attacks are more effective at night than\r\nduring the day.\r\n\r\n=Horizontal Spread of Gas.= Another important thing to know in regard\r\nto the behavior of the wave of gas is the horizontal spread of a cloud.\r\nIf gas be emitted from a cylinder the total spread in both directions\r\nfrom that point is from 20° to 30° or an average of 25°. This varies,\r\nof course, with the wind. The higher the wind the less the angle,\r\nthough the variation due to wind is not as great as might be expected.\r\nThis horizontal spread of the gas cloud was measured experimentally,\r\nand the results checked by aeroplane pictures of heavy wave attacks\r\nover the enemy line. In the latter case the path of the gas was very\r\nclosely indicated by the dead vegetation. This vegetation was killed\r\nand bleached so that it readily showed up in aeroplane photographs.\r\nThe visibility of a gas cloud arises from the fact that when a large\r\namount of liquid is suddenly evaporated, the air is cooled and moisture\r\ncondensed, thereby creating a fog. With gases such as mustard gas\r\nand others of slight volatility, a visible cloud is not formed. For\r\npurposes of identification of points struck by shell, smoke substances\r\nare occasionally added, or a few smoke shell fired with the gas shell.\r\nAs future battle fields will be dotted everywhere with smoke clouds, a\r\npoint that will be discussed more fully later, the firing of smoke with\r\ngas shell will probably be the rule and not the exception.\r\n\r\n\r\nREQUIREMENTS OF SUCCESSFUL GAS\r\n\r\nIf we succeed in getting a poisonous gas that has no odor it will be\r\nhighly desirable to fire it so that it will not be visible. In that\r\ncase no smoke will be used. Carbon monoxide is such a gas, but there\r\nare several important reasons why it has not been used in war. (See\r\npage 190). These considerations indicate the general requirements\r\nfor a successful poisonous gas. If non-persistent it must be quickly\r\nvolatilized, or must be capable of being driven off by heat or by other\r\nmeans, which can be readily and safely produced in the field. It must\r\nbe highly poisonous, producing deaths in high concentrations, and more\r\nor less serious injuries when taken into the system in quantities as\r\nsmall as one-tenth of that necessary to produce death. If it has a\r\nslightly delayed action with no intervening discomfort, it is still\r\nbetter than one that produces immediate discomfort and more or less\r\nimmediate action. It must be readily compressed into a liquid and\r\nremain so at ordinary temperatures, with the pressure not much above 25\r\nor 30 pounds per square inch.\r\n\r\nAs a persistent gas it must be effective in extremely low\r\nconcentrations, in addition to having the other qualities mentioned\r\nabove.\r\n\r\nThese general characteristics concerning gases apply whether used by\r\nChemical Warfare troops, the Artillery, the Air Service, the Navy,\r\nor the Infantry. In speaking of these substances being used by the\r\nInfantry, it is understood that an ample number of Chemical Warfare\r\nofficers will be present to insure that the gases may not be turned\r\nloose when weather conditions are such that the gas might drift back\r\nand become a menace to our own troops. This is absolutely essential\r\nsince no troops who have as varied duties to perform as the Infantry,\r\ncan be sufficiently trained in the technical side of chemical warfare\r\nto know when to put it off on a large scale with safety and efficiency.\r\n\r\n\r\nARTILLERY USE OF GAS\r\n\r\nThe Artillery of the future will probably fire more gas than any other\r\none branch of the Army. There are two reasons for this—first, the large\r\nnumber of guns now accompanying every Army, and second, the long range\r\nof many of these guns. As before indicated, the gases are adaptable to\r\nvarious uses, and hence to guns differing both in caliber and range.\r\nThe gas will be fired by practically all guns—from the 75 mm. to the\r\nvery largest in use. It is even possible that if guns smaller than the\r\n75 mm. become generally useful that certain gases will be fired by them.\r\n\r\n=Efficiency of Artillery Gas Shell.= It is well to remember in the\r\nbeginning that all artillery shell so far designed and used, contain\r\nonly about 10 per cent gas, i.e., 10 per cent of the total weight of\r\nshell and gas. It is hoped that gas shell may later be so designed\r\nthat a somewhat greater proportion of the total weight of the shell\r\nwill be gas than is now true. This is very desirable from the point of\r\nefficiency. As stated above the bombs used by Chemical Warfare troops\r\ncontain nearly 50 per cent of their total weight in gas, and hence are\r\nnearly five times as efficient as artillery shell within the limit of\r\nrange of these bombs. This fact alone is enough to warrant the use of\r\ngas troops to their full maximum capacity in order that the artillery\r\nmay not fire gas at the ranges covered.\r\n\r\n\r\nGUNS FIRING PERSISTENT AND NON-PERSISTENT GASES\r\n\r\nConsidering the firing of non-persistent and persistent gases, it may\r\nbe said generally that non-persistent gases will be fired only by the\r\nmedium caliber guns which are available in large numbers. In fact, the\r\nfiring of non-persistent gases will be confined mainly to the 6-inch or\r\n155 mm. Howitzer and gun.\r\n\r\nAs our Army was organized in France, and as it is organized at present,\r\nthe number of 155 mm. guns will be greater than all others put\r\ntogether, except the 75 mm. In order that a non-persistent gas may be\r\nmost effective a high concentration must be built up very quickly. This\r\nnecessitates the use of the largest caliber shell that are available\r\nin large numbers. Of course, a certain percentage of the gas shell of\r\nother calibers may consist of non-persistent gases in order to help out\r\nthe 155 mm. gun. This is in accordance with the present program for\r\nloading gas shell and applies particularly to the 8-inch and 240 mm.\r\nHowitzer.\r\n\r\n=Few Ideally Persistent or Non-Persistent Gases.= Naturally there\r\nwill be very few gases that are ideally non-persistent or ideally\r\npersistent. The groups will merge into one another. Those on the border\r\nline will be arbitrarily assigned to one group or the other. It might\r\nbe said definitely, however, that a gas which will linger more than six\r\nor possibly eight hours under any conditions, except great cold, will\r\nnot be considered non-persistent. For reasons of efficiency and economy\r\npersistent gases will not be chosen unless they will persist under\r\nordinary conditions for two or three days or more. Accordingly, a gas\r\nwhich would persist for one day only would have to be extraordinarily\r\nuseful to lead to its adoption.\r\n\r\n=Firing Non-Persistent Gases.= Of the non-persistent gases phosgene\r\nis the type and the one most used at present. Furthermore, so far as\r\ncan now be foreseen, it will continue to be the non-persistent gas\r\nmost used. It volatilizes very quickly upon the bursting of the shell.\r\nAccordingly, in order that the shell fired at the beginning of a gas\r\n“shoot,” as they are generally referred to in the field, shall still\r\nbe effective when the last shell are fired, it is necessary that the\r\nwhole number be fired within two to three minutes. The temperature\r\nand velocity of the wind both affect this. If it be in a dead calm,\r\nthe time may be considerably extended; if in a considerable wind, it\r\nmust be shortened. Another important consideration requiring the\r\nrapid firing of non-persistent gases is the fact that nearly all\r\nmasks thoroughly protect against phosgene and similar gases. It is\r\naccordingly necessary to take the enemy unawares and gas him before he\r\ncan adjust his mask; otherwise, practically no harm will result. From\r\nthe considerations previously mentioned, these “gas shoots” are usually\r\nmade at night when, as before stated, carelessness, sleepiness and the\r\nresulting confusion of battle conditions always insure more casualties\r\nthan firing gas in the daytime.\r\n\r\n=Firing Persistent Gases.= The persistent gases will be fired by all\r\ncaliber guns, but to a less extent by the 155 mm. than by the other\r\ncalibers. Persistent gases must be sufficiently effective in low\r\nconcentrations to act more or less alone. If it be desirable to fill an\r\natmosphere over a given area with mustard gas, the firing may extend\r\nfor two or three, or even five or six hours and all shell still act\r\ntogether. The same is true of bromobenzylcyanide. This, then, permits\r\nthe minimum number of guns to be used in firing these persistent gases.\r\nInasmuch as they persist and force the wearing of the mask, they are\r\navailable for use in long-range, large-caliber guns for interdiction\r\nfiring on cross-roads, in villages, and on woods that afford hiding\r\nplaces, as well as on other similar concentration points.\r\n\r\n=Firing Irritant Gases.= The irritant gases will be fired by the\r\nvarious caliber guns, in the same manner as the persistent and\r\nnon-persistent gases. We will have non-persistent irritant gases and\r\npersistent irritant gases. They are, however, considered as a group\r\nbecause they are used for harassing purposes, due to their efficiency\r\nin forcing the wearing of the mask.\r\n\r\nBefore the signing of the Armistice, the General Staff, A. E. F., had\r\nauthorized, beginning January 1, 1919, the filling of 25 per cent of\r\nall shell with Chemical Warfare materials. The interpretation there\r\ngiven to shell was that it included both shrapnel and high explosive.\r\n\r\nOf the field guns in use, the 75 mm. will be best, up to the limit of\r\nits range, for persistent gases such as mustard gas, and the tear gas,\r\nbromobenzylcyanide. A considerable number, however, were filled with\r\nnon-persistent gases and probably will continue to be so, since, due to\r\nthe very large number of 75 mm. guns available, they can be used to add\r\ngreatly at times to the amount of non-persistent gas that can be fired\r\nupon a given point.\r\n\r\n\r\nUSE OF GAS BY THE AVIATION SERVICE\r\n\r\nNo gas was used by aeroplanes in the World War. Many rumors were spread\r\nduring the latter part of the war to the effect that the Germans had\r\ndropped gas here or there from aeroplanes. Every such report reaching\r\nthe Chemical Warfare Service Headquarters was run down and in every\r\ncase was found to be incorrect. However, there was absolutely no\r\nreason for not so using gas, except that the German was afraid. In the\r\nearly days of the use of gas he did not have enough gas, nor had he\r\ndeveloped the use of aeroplanes to the point where it would have seemed\r\nadvisable. When, however, he had the aeroplanes the war had not only\r\nbegun to go against him, but he had become particularly fearful of gas\r\nand of aeroplane bombing.\r\n\r\nIt does not seem to be generally known, but it is a fact, that after\r\nthree or four months’ propaganda he made a direct appeal to the Allies\r\nto stop the use of gas sometime during the month of March, 1918. This\r\npropaganda took the form of an appeal by a Professor of Chemistry who\r\nhad access to Switzerland, to prevent the annihilation of the Allied\r\nforces by a German gas that was to make its appearance in 1918. This\r\nGerman professor claimed that, while favoring the Germans winning the\r\nwar, he had too much human sympathy to desire to see the slaughter that\r\nwould be caused by the use of the new gas. The Allies in the field felt\r\nthat this was simply an expression of fear and that he did not have\r\nsuch a gas. The Germans were accordingly informed that the Allies would\r\nnot give up the use of gas. Later events proved these conclusions to be\r\nabsolutely correct. The German evidently felt that the manufacturing\r\npossibilities of the Allies would put them in a more predominant\r\nposition with gas than with anything else. In that he was exactly\r\ncorrect.\r\n\r\nThe use of gas by aeroplanes will not differ from its use in artillery\r\nor by Chemical Warfare Troops. Non-persistent gases may be dropped\r\non the field of battle, upon concentration points, in rest areas, or\r\nother troop encampments to produce immediate casualties. Persistent\r\ngases will be dropped particularly around cross-roads, railroad yards,\r\nconcentration points and encampments that cannot be reached by the\r\nartillery. The sprinkling of persistent gases will be one of the best\r\nways for aeroplanes to distribute gas.\r\n\r\nIt might be said here that the aviation gas bomb will be highly\r\nefficient, inasmuch as it has to be only strong enough to withstand the\r\nlow pressure of the gas and ordinary handling, whereas artillery shell\r\nmust be strong enough to withstand the shock of discharge in the gun.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFANTRY AND GAS WARFARE\r\n\r\nWhen one suggests the possibility of the infantry handling gas, it is\r\nat once argued that the infantry is already overloaded. That is true,\r\nbut in the future, as in the past, the infantryman will increase or\r\ndecrease his load of a given material just as its efficiency warrants.\r\nIf he finds that gas will get casualties and help him win victories\r\nmore readily than an equal weight of any other material, he will carry\r\ngas material. A study of the articles of equipment abandoned by 10,000\r\nstragglers in the British Army picked up during the great German drive\r\ntowards Amiens in March, 1918, illustrates this very clearly. Of the\r\nequipment carried by these stragglers, more than 6,000 had discarded\r\ntheir rifles. The helmets were thrown away to a somewhat less extent,\r\nbut the gas mask had been thrown away by only 800 out of the 10,000.\r\nNow the gas mask is not a particularly easy thing to carry, nor was\r\nthe English type comfortable to wear, but the English soldier had\r\nlearned that in a gas attack he had no chance whatever of escape if his\r\ngas mask failed him. Accordingly, he hung on to the mask when he had\r\ndiscarded nearly everything else in his possession. The same thing will\r\nbe true of any gas equipment if it proves its worth.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMOKE AND INCENDIARY MATERIALS\r\n\r\nSo far nothing has been said in regard to smoke or incendiary\r\nmaterials. This has been due to the fact that their use is not\r\ndependent upon weather conditions to anything near the extent that\r\ngas is. Second, the smokes, not being poisonous, are not a danger to\r\nour own troops, although they may hamper movements and add to the\r\ndifficulty of taking a position, if used improperly. Of the two classes\r\nof materials, smoke and incendiary, smoke materials may be said to be\r\nat least a thousand times as important as the incendiary materials. A\r\nmaterial that will burst into flame when a shell is opened or that will\r\nscatter balls of burning fire appeals to the popular imagination, and\r\nyet actual results achieved by such materials on the field of battle\r\nhave been almost nil. About the only results worth while achieved by\r\nincendiary materials have been in occasionally firing ammunition dumps\r\nand more frequently, setting fire to warehouses and other storage\r\nplaces. This will undoubtedly continue in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nFLAME THROWER\r\n\r\nOf the incendiary materials the least valuable is the flame thrower. In\r\nthe Chemical Warfare Service it has been the habit for a long while not\r\nto mention the flame thrower at all, unless questions were asked about\r\nit. It is mentioned here to forestall the questions. Even the German,\r\nwho invented it and who, during the two years of trench warfare, had\r\nfull opportunity for developing its use, finally came to using it\r\nlargely as a means of executing people that he did not want to shoot\r\nhimself. Men falling in that class were equipped with flame throwers\r\nand sent over the top. The German knew, as did the Allies, that each\r\nman with a flame thrower became a target for every rifle and machine\r\ngun nearby. The flame thrower is very quickly exhausted and then the\r\none equipped with it has no means of offensive action, and in addition,\r\nis saddled with a heavy load, hampering all movements, whether to\r\nescape or to advance.\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLAMMABLE MATERIALS\r\n\r\nThere will probably be some use for materials such as metallic sodium,\r\nspontaneously inflammable oils, etc., that will burst into flame and\r\nburn when exposed to the air, though white phosphorus is probably\r\nequal, and in most cases vastly superior to anything else so far\r\nsuggested. Phosphorus burns with an unquenchable flame when exposed\r\nto the air, whether wet or dry. It is of great value for screening\r\npurposes, and for use against the enemy’s troops. The German did not\r\nuse phosphorus simply because he did not have it, just as he did not\r\nuse helium in his observation balloons because he did not have it.\r\n\r\nThe value of phosphorus was just beginning to be realized slightly when\r\nthe Americans entered the war, while its full value was not appreciated\r\neven by the American troops when the war closed.\r\n\r\nThe work of the First Gas Regiment with phosphorus against machine gun\r\nnests proved how valuable it is against the enemy’s troops. It proved\r\nalso its tremendous value as a screen.\r\n\r\nThe Chemical Warfare Service was prepared to fill a great number of\r\nartillery shell with phosphorus, but due to the failure of our shell\r\nprogram to mature before the Armistice, phosphorus was not used by\r\nAmerican artillery to any appreciable extent.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMOKE USED BY EVERYONE\r\n\r\nSmoke will be used by every fighting arm of the Service in practically\r\nevery battle, both by day and by night. If you have ever tried on\r\na target range to shoot at a target that was just beginning to be\r\nobscured by a fog, you will recognize the difficulty of hitting\r\nanything by firing through an impenetrable smoke screen. It is simply\r\na shot in the dark. Future battles will witness smoke formed by smoke\r\ncandles that are kept in the trenches or carried by the troops, by\r\nsmoke from bursting artillery shell and rifle grenades, by smoke from\r\naeroplane bombs and possibly even from what is known as the smoke\r\nknapsack. The knapsack produces a very dense white smoke and very\r\neconomically, but will probably not be much used. This is because,\r\nnotwithstanding its efficiency, the knapsack cannot be projected to a\r\ndistance, that is, the smoke screen is generated on the person carrying\r\nthe knapsack. On the other hand the great value of phosphorus is that\r\nit can be fired to great distances in rifle grenades or artillery\r\nshell, and dropped from aviation bombs. The smoke screen is thus\r\nestablished in front of the object it is desired to cut off, whether it\r\nbe a battery of artillery, an advancing wave of infantry, or a lookout\r\nstation. Thus smoke, for screening purposes alone, will be used to a\r\ntremendous extent. It will also be used in conjunction with gas.\r\n\r\n\r\nSMOKY APPEARANCE OF GAS CLOUD\r\n\r\nDue to the smoky appearance of an ordinary gas cloud and to the coming\r\nuse of poisonous smokes, no one on the field of battle in the future\r\nwill ever be certain that any given smoke cloud is not also a poisonous\r\ncloud until he has actually tested it. And there lies an opportunity\r\nfor the most intense study and for the greatest use of the proverbial\r\nAmerican ingenuity that war has ever furnished.\r\n\r\nIn the variations that can be played with smoke containing gas, or not\r\ncontaining gas, with smoke hurled long distances by the artillery or\r\ndropped from aeroplanes, the possibilities indeed are unlimited. Every\r\nofficer will need to study the possibilities of smoke, both in its use\r\nagainst him and in his use of it against the enemy. He can probably\r\nsave more casualties among his own troops by the skillful use of smoke\r\nthan by any other one thing at his command. On the other hand, the\r\nunskilled use of smoke on the part of one side in a battle may lead to\r\nvery great casualties in proportion to those of the enemy should the\r\nlatter use his smoke skillfully. This is a subject that deserves deep\r\nand constant study.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTECTION BY SMOKE CLOUDS\r\n\r\nSmoke in the future will be the greatest protective device available\r\nto the soldier. It shuts out not only the view in daylight, but\r\nthe searching of ground at night by searchlights, by star bombs or\r\nother means for illuminating the battlefield. It has already been\r\nused extensively by the Navy and undoubtedly will be used far more\r\nextensively in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nSHELL MARKINGS\r\n\r\nModern artillery shell have distinctive colors for high explosive, for\r\nshrapnel, for incendiary materials, and for gases. A grayish color has\r\nbeen adopted as the general color of the paint on all gas shells, bombs\r\nand cylinders. In addition a system of colored bands has been adopted.\r\nThese bands are white to indicate poisonous non-persistent substances,\r\nand red—persistent. Yellow is used to indicate smoke. With any given\r\ncombination of red and white and yellow bands, the artillery-man at\r\nthe front can tell, at a glance, whether the gas is non-persistent or\r\nwhether it is persistent, and also whether or not it contains smoke.\r\nThere will be secondary markings on each shell which, to the trained\r\nChemical Warfare Service officer, will indicate the particular gas or\r\ngases in the shell. These markings however, will be inconspicuous and\r\nno attempt will be made to give the information to the soldier or even\r\nto the average officer firing gas.\r\n\r\nThese secondary markings are for the purpose of enabling the Chemical\r\nWarfare Service officers in charge to use certain gases for particular\r\nuses in those comparatively rare cases when sufficient gas is on hand\r\nand sufficient time available to enable such a choice to be made.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nDEFENSE AGAINST GAS\r\n\r\n\r\n(From the Field Point of View)\r\n\r\nThe best defense against any implement of war is a vigorous offense\r\nwith the same implement. This is a military axiom that cannot be\r\ntoo often, or too greatly emphasized, though like other axioms it\r\ncannot be applied too literally. It needs a proper interpretation—the\r\ninterpretation varying with time and circumstances. Thus in gas\r\nwarfare, a vigorous offense with gas is the best defense against\r\ngas. This does not mean that the enemy’s gas can be ignored. Indeed,\r\nit is more important to make use of all defensive measures against\r\ngas than it is against any other form of attack. Gas being heavier\r\nthan air, rolls along the ground, filling dugouts, trenches, woods\r\nand valleys—just the places that are safest from bullets and high\r\nexplosives. There it remains for hours after it has blown away in the\r\nopen, and, since the very air itself is poisoned, it is necessary not\r\nonly that protection be general but that it be continuous during the\r\nwhole time the gas is present.\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLIEST PROTECTIVE APPLIANCES\r\n\r\nThe earliest protection against gas was the crudest sort of a mask.\r\nThe first gas used was chlorine and since thousands of people in civil\r\nlife were used to handling it, many knew that certain solutions, as\r\nhyposulfite of soda, would readily destroy it. They also knew that\r\nif the breath could be drawn through material saturated with those\r\nsolutions, the chlorine would be destroyed. Thus it was that the first\r\nmasks were simple cotton, or cotton waste pads, which were dipped into\r\nhyposulfite of soda solutions and applied to the mouth and nose during\r\na gas attack. These pads were awkward, unsanitary, and, due to the long\r\nintervals between gas attacks, were frequently lost, while the solution\r\nitself was often spilled or evaporated. The net result of all this was\r\npoor protection and disgust with the so-called masks.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESIGN OF NEW MASKS\r\n\r\nAfter using these, or similar poor excuses for a mask, for a few weeks,\r\nthe British designed what was known as the PH helmet. In a gas attack\r\nthe sack was pulled over the head and tucked under the blouse around\r\nthe neck, the gas-tight fit being obtained by buttoning the blouse\r\nover the ends of the sack. This PH helmet was quite successful against\r\nchlorine and, to a much less extent, against phosgene, a new gas\r\nintroduced during the spring of 1916.\r\n\r\nBut it was warm and stuffy in summer—the very time when gas is used to\r\nthe greatest extent—while the chemicals in the cloth irritated the face\r\nand eyes, especially when combined with some of the poisonous gases.\r\n\r\nProbably as a result of experience with oxygen apparatus in mine rescue\r\nwork, Colonel Harrison suggested making a mask of which the principal\r\npart was a box filled with chemicals and carried on the chest. A\r\nflexible tube connected the box with a mouthpiece of rubber. Breathing\r\nwas thus through the mouth and in order to insure that no air would be\r\nbreathed in through the nose, a noseclip was added.\r\n\r\nThis, of course, cared for the lungs, but did not protect the eyes.\r\nTheir protection was secured by making a facepiece of rubberized cloth\r\nwith elastics to hold it tight against the face. The efficiency of this\r\nmask depends, then, first upon the ability of the facepiece to keep out\r\nlachrymatory gases which affect the eyes, and, second, upon a proper\r\ncombination of chemicals in the box, to purify the air drawn into the\r\nlungs through the mouthpiece. (Details are given in Chapter XII).\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTECTION AGAINST SMOKE\r\n\r\nWhile the charcoal and soda-lime granules furnished an adequate\r\nprotection against all known true gases, they did not furnish\r\nprotection against certain smokes or against minute particles of\r\nliquid gas. Since certain smokes, as stannic chloride, though not\r\ndeadly, are so highly irritating as to make life unbearable, it early\r\nbecame necessary to devise means for keeping them from going through\r\nthe masks. This was done in the first masks by adding a sufficient\r\nthickness of cotton batting. The cotton was usually placed in three\r\nlayers alternating with the charcoal and granules, as it was thought\r\nthe latter would be held in place better by that means.\r\n\r\nSome time after stannic chloride came into use the Germans started\r\nfiring shells containing a small quantity of diphenylchloroarsine,\r\npopularly known as “Sneezing Gas.” Protection against this is discussed\r\nin Chapter XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHOICE OF MASKS FOR U. S. TROOPS\r\n\r\nWhen it became necessary, with the creation of a Chemical Warfare\r\nService in France in August, 1917, to decide upon a mask for American\r\ntroops, there were available for purchase two types—the British\r\ntype and the French M-2. The French M-2 consisted essentially of 32\r\nlayers of cloth impregnated with various chemicals, through which\r\nthe air was breathed both in and out. This mask was quite effective\r\nagainst ordinary field concentrations of most gases, but was utterly\r\ninadequate to care for the high concentration of phosgene obtained in\r\nthe front line from cloud gas or from projector gas attacks. It was\r\nalso poor against chloropicrin. The M-2 was, however, very light and\r\neasy to carry and moreover was deemed sufficient to protect against\r\nconcentrations of cloud gas even, at points more than five miles\r\ndistant from the front line.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, it was felt desirable at first to have an auxiliary or\r\nemergency mask in addition to the principal one, for use in case\r\nthe principal mask was worn out or damaged. Accordingly both types\r\nof masks were adopted and the day after Fries took charge of the\r\nChemical Warfare Service, A.E.F., on August 22, 1917, 100,000 of each\r\nwere purchased, although there were then only ten or twelve thousand\r\nAmerican troops in France requiring masks. Later additional masks of\r\nboth kinds were purchased to tide over the American troops until a\r\nsufficient quantity of the British type masks could be manufactured in\r\nthe United States. The total of British masks purchased amounted to\r\nabout 700,000.\r\n\r\nHowever, within a comparatively short time after American troops got\r\ninto the front line it was realized that a second mask, inferior in\r\nprotection to the first, was highly undesirable. During a gas attack\r\nmen seemed to acquire an uncontrollable desire to shift from one\r\nmask to the other. This shifting in nearly every case resulted in a\r\ncasualty. We then came rapidly to the conclusion that one mask only\r\nshould be furnished, and that one the best that could be made, and\r\nthen to impress upon the soldier the fact that his life depended upon\r\nthe care he took of his mask. This proved to be an entirely sound\r\nconclusion, as the number of men gassed through injuries to the mask\r\nwas comparatively small. An interesting proof of the value the soldier\r\nplaced upon his mask was shown by the articles of equipment thrown away\r\nby 10,000 British stragglers in the great German offensive of March,\r\n1918. Of the articles thus thrown away the gas mask came at the foot of\r\nthe list, with only 800 missing. The steel helmet is said to have come\r\nnext with about 4,000 missing.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIZES OF FACES FOR MASKS\r\n\r\nWhen adopting the British respirator in August, 1917, it was decided\r\nthat the American face as well as the American stature was probably\r\nlarger than the English. Accordingly inquiry was made in regard to\r\nthe sizes of masks issued to the Canadians as it was thought probable\r\nthey required a greater proportion of the larger size masks than did\r\nthe English. When prescribing the relative quantities of each size\r\nof mask to be furnished Americans, the Canadian requirements were\r\ntaken as a base but with the larger sizes increased slightly over the\r\nCanadian requirements. As a matter of fact even these increases proved\r\nconsiderably too small, so that the numbers in the two sizes above\r\nnormal had to be finally more than doubled.\r\n\r\n\r\nOBJECTIONS TO GERMAN TYPE MASK\r\n\r\nThe American Gas Service felt from the beginning that a design which\r\nattached the box of chemicals to the facepiece was unsound in principle\r\n(this design was used in the German mask and in the French A. R. S.\r\nmasks), since it did not allow proper flexibility for increasing the\r\nsize of the box to care for new gases. Furthermore, the weight of the\r\nbox during movement caused the facepiece to swing slightly from side\r\nto side. This interfered with vision and tended to lift the facepiece\r\naway from the face and allow gas to enter. That the objections of\r\nthe American Gas Service to this type were correct was proved by the\r\ndifficulty encountered toward the end of the war by both the French\r\nand the Germans in trying to provide a suitable filter for protection\r\nagainst particulate clouds and the smokes, such as stannic chloride and\r\ndiphenylchloroarsine.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTRUGGLE BETWEEN MASK AND GAS\r\n\r\nAs between the mask and poisonous gases, we have the old struggle of\r\nthe battleship armor against the armor-piercing projectile. While the\r\narmor-piercing projectile has always had a little the better of the\r\ngame, it is just the reverse with gases. The gas mask has always been\r\njust a little better than the gases, so that very few casualties have\r\noccurred through failure of the mask itself. This margin of safety\r\nhas never been any too great, and that we have had a margin at all\r\nis due to the energy, skill and enthusiasm of those developing and\r\nmanufacturing masks in England, France, and particularly in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nHowever, the mask at the best is uncomfortable, causes some loss of\r\nvigor, and even with the very best American masks there is some loss in\r\nvision. The wearing effect on troops results mostly from the increased\r\nresistance to breathing. Accordingly a tremendous amount of study and\r\neffort was made to decrease this breathing resistance. In the English\r\ntype masks this resistance was equal to the vacuum required to raise\r\na column of water about four and one-half inches. Adding the sulfite\r\npaper to protect against diphenylchloroarsine increased this resistance\r\nby about one inch. This put a heavy burden on the wearer of the mask\r\nwhenever it was necessary for him to do any manual labor while wearing\r\nit. In addition earlier masks left a good deal to be desired in the\r\nway of reducing resistance by proper sized tubes, angles and valves\r\nthrough which the air was drawn. This was much more easily overcome\r\nthan reducing the resistance through the chemicals and charcoal and the\r\nmaterials for protection against diphenylchloroarsine. In the latest\r\ntype canister, devised after long trials for the American forces, this\r\nresistance was brought down to about two inches of water. What this\r\nreduction in resistance means no one knows except one who has worn the\r\nold mask with its mouthpiece and four to six inches’ resistance and has\r\nthen replaced that mask for one through which he breathes naturally\r\nwith only two inches’ resistance.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESIGN OF NEW AMERICAN MASK\r\n\r\nThe American Gas Service felt from the beginning that the mouthpiece\r\nand noseclip must be abandoned and bent every effort toward getting a\r\nmask perfected for that purpose. The English opposed this view fiercely\r\nfor nearly a year. This position on the part of the English was more or\r\nless natural. They developed their mask in the beginning for protection\r\nagainst cloud gas. In those days the opposing trenches were close\r\ntogether. Moreover, front line trenches were quite strongly manned.\r\nThe result was that a large number of men were exposed to a very high\r\nconcentration of gas, but—and highly important—for a short period\r\nonly. Inasmuch as the German feared this cloud gas even more than\r\nthe English there was no danger of his attacking in it. The English\r\nrules of conduct during a gas attack called for all movement to stop\r\nand for every man to stand ready until the cloud passed. Accordingly,\r\nthe man was breathing the easiest possible and hence did not suffer\r\nparticularly from the resistance.\r\n\r\nWith the advent of mustard gas, however, the whole general scheme of\r\nprotection changed. Mustard gas, as is well known, is effective in\r\nextremely low concentrations and has very great persistency. In dry\r\nwarm weather mustard gas, scattered on the ground and shrubbery, will\r\nnot be fully evaporated for two to three days and accordingly will\r\ngive off vapors that not only burn the lungs and eyes but the soft,\r\nmoist parts of the skin as well. In cool, damp weather the gas remains\r\nin dangerous quantity for a week and occasionally longer. Since this\r\ngas, in liquid form, evaporates too slowly for use in gas clouds,\r\nit is used altogether in bombs and shells. Accordingly it could be\r\nexpected to be and actually is fired at all ranges from the front line\r\nto nearly eight miles back of that line. Hence, with the coming of\r\nmustard gas, the need for protection changed from high protection for\r\na short period to moderate protection for very long periods. Indeed,\r\nmustard gas makes it necessary for men to wear masks just as long as\r\nthey remain in an area infected with it. There is still occasional need\r\nfor high protection for short periods, but with the increase in the\r\nefficiency of charcoal alone, it is found that the amount of charcoal\r\nand chemicals in the canister can be very greatly reduced and still\r\nmaintain sufficient protection for the high concentrations encountered\r\nin cloud gas and projector attacks.\r\n\r\n\r\nEXHAUSTION AND MALINGERING\r\n\r\nIt seems physically impossible for the ordinary man to wear the British\r\nmask with its mouthpiece and noseclip more than six to eight hours\r\nand vast numbers are unable to even do that. How many thousands of\r\ncasualties were suffered through men losing their mental balance from\r\nexhaustion and the discomfort of the mouthpiece and noseclip no one\r\nknows. Such men tore off the mask, stating that they would rather\r\ndie than endure the torture of wearing it longer. Furthermore, the\r\npoor vision of this mask led to the habit of taking the facepiece\r\noff while still leaving the mouthpiece and noseclip in place. This\r\ngave protection to the lungs, but exposed the eyes, and as mustard\r\ngas affects the eyes very readily this alone led to thousands of\r\ncasualties. There was another interesting side to this situation. The\r\nmalingerer who wanted to get out of the front line and was willing to\r\ntake any action, however cowardly, to achieve that end, deliberately\r\nremoved the facepiece and thus suffered gassing of the eyes. The effect\r\nof mustard gas soon became so well known that the malingerer knew\r\ngassing of the eyes never resulted in death or permanent loss of sight.\r\nWith the new type of American mask, the protection of eyes and lungs\r\ndepends solely upon the fit around the face and no such playing with\r\nthe mask can be done.\r\n\r\n\r\nWithout going into further details in regard to masks it is sufficient\r\nto state that at the end the Americans had produced a mask thoroughly\r\ncomfortable, giving complete protection against gases and smoke clouds,\r\nand one that was easy to manufacture on the huge scale (fifty to\r\nseventy-five thousand per day) which was necessary to provide masks for\r\nan army of three to four million men in the field.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTECTION IN WAR IS RELATIVE ONLY\r\n\r\nNapoleon is credited with saying “In order to make an omelet, it is\r\nnecessary to break some eggs.” Every student of war realizes that\r\ncasualties cannot be avoided in battle and yet one American Staff\r\nOfficer went so far as to refuse to use gas offensively unless the\r\nChemical Warfare Service could absolutely guarantee that not a single\r\nAmerican casualty could occur under any circumstances. This same\r\nidea early got into the heads of the laboratory workers on masks.\r\nThey seemed to feel that if a single gas casualty occurred through\r\nfailure of the mask, their work would be a failure or at least they\r\nwould be open to severe criticism. Accordingly efforts were made to\r\nperfect masks and to perfect protection regardless of the discomfort\r\nimposed upon the wearer of the mask. This idea was very difficult to\r\neradicate. The laboratory worker who accustoms himself to experiment\r\nwith a particular thing forgets that he develops an ability to endure\r\ndiscomfort, that is not possible of attainment by the ordinary man in\r\nthe time available for his training.\r\n\r\nFurthermore, if the need for such training can be avoided it is of\r\ncourse highly desirable. This applies to the mouthpiece of the British\r\nrespirator; to elastics that cause undue discomfort to the face; to\r\nthe noseclip and to the large boxes that cause too great resistance to\r\nbreathing.\r\n\r\nIt may be taken as a general rule that when protection requires so\r\nmuch effort or becomes so much of a burden that the average man cannot\r\nor will not endure it, it is high time to find out what the average\r\nman will stand and then provide it even if some casualties result.\r\nProtection in battle is always relative. A man who cannot balance\r\nprotection against legitimate risk has no business passing on arms,\r\nequipment or tactics to be used in battle.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRAINING\r\n\r\nBitter experience taught the Allies as well as the Americans that no\r\nmatter how efficient the gas mask and other defensive appliances, they\r\nwould not take the place of thorough and constant training. One of the\r\ngreatest difficulties at first was to get American troops to realize\r\nthat a thing as invisible as gas, with in many cases no offensive smell\r\nand producing no immediate discomfort, could be deadly. Nothing but\r\nconstant drill and constant reiteration of these dangers could get this\r\nfact impressed on them. Indeed it never was impressed sufficiently in\r\nany of the earlier divisions of American troops in the line to prevent\r\ntheir taking such chances that each division suffered heavy loss on one\r\nor more occasions from gas attacks.\r\n\r\nA great deal of emphasis had been placed by the English upon the\r\nadjustment of the mask in the shortest possible time, this time having\r\nbeen officially set at six seconds after the alarm. The Americans\r\nin adopting the mask _in toto_ naturally had to adopt the rules for\r\nadjusting it and wearing it. Experience, however, taught them in a\r\nfew months that the effort to attain too great speed was dangerous.\r\nIt tended to rattle the soldier and to result in poor adjustment of\r\nthe mask, both of which led to casualties. Accordingly in the latest\r\ninstructions for defense against gas all reference to six seconds was\r\neliminated and emphasis placed on the necessity of accurate adjustment\r\nof the mask. Inasmuch as any man, practically without effort or\r\nprevious drill, can hold his breath for twenty seconds, the need for\r\ngreat speed in adjusting the mask is not apparent.\r\n\r\n\r\nHOLDING THE BREATH\r\n\r\nThe first regulations and those in general use up to near the close of\r\nhostilities, prescribed that the soldier should hold his breath and\r\nadjust his mask. It seemed impossible to overcome the natural inference\r\nthat “holding the breath” meant first the drawing of a full breath.\r\nThis was obviously highly dangerous if gas were actually present\r\nbefore the alarm was heard, as was often the case with projector and\r\nartillery gas shell attacks. The change was then made to the phrase\r\n“Stop Breathing and Stay Stopped until the Mask is Carefully and\r\nAccurately Adjusted.”\r\n\r\n\r\nPSYCHOLOGY IN TRAINING\r\n\r\nWhile the importance of impressing upon the soldier the danger of gas\r\nwas early appreciated it was deemed necessary not to make him unduly\r\nafraid of the gas. However, as gas defense training in our Army got\r\na big start over gas offense training, this became a matter of very\r\ngreat importance. In fact, due to a variety of causes, training in\r\nthe offensive use of gas was not available for any troops until after\r\ntheir arrival in France. This resulted in officers and men looking upon\r\nthe gas game, so far as they were individually concerned, as one of\r\ndefense only. Accordingly after their arrival in France it became very\r\ndifficult not only to get some of our officers to take up the offensive\r\nuse of gas but even to get them to permit its use along the front they\r\ncommanded.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all the care taken in training Americans in gas defense\r\nthere arose an undue fear of the gas that had to be overcome in order\r\nto get our troops to attack close enough to their own gas to make it\r\neffective. This applied to the use of gas by artillery as well as\r\nto its use by gas troops. However, it should be said that in every\r\ninstance where gas was once used on an American front all officers in\r\nthe Division, or other unit, affected by it were always thereafter\r\nstrongly in favor of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nGERMAN PROBLEMS IN GAS TRAINING\r\n\r\nThe Germans also had serious troubles of their own over the psychology\r\nof gas training. As stated elsewhere they were using mustard gas nearly\r\neleven months before the Allies began using it. During that time, for\r\npurposes of morale, if not sheer boastfulness, the Germans told their\r\nmen that mustard gas could not be made by the Allies; that it was by\r\nfar the worst thing the war had produced—and in that statement they\r\nwere correct—and that they would win the war with it—in which statement\r\nthey were far from correct. When the Allies began sending it back\r\nto them they had to reverse their teachings and tell their men that\r\nmustard gas was no worse than anything else, that they need not be\r\nafraid of it and that their masks and other protective appliances gave\r\nfull protection against it. They thus had a problem in psychology which\r\nthey never succeeded in fully solving. Indeed there is no question but\r\nthat the growing fear of gas in the minds of the German is one of the\r\nreasons that prompted him to his early capitulation.\r\n\r\n\r\nGAS AT NIGHT\r\n\r\nIn the early days it was very difficult to get officers to realize\r\nthe absolute necessity of night drill in the adjustment of the mask.\r\nFor various reasons, including surprise, gas attacks were probably\r\neighty to ninety per cent of the time carried out at night. Under\r\nsuch conditions confusion in the adjustment of the mask is inevitable\r\nwithout a great deal of practice before hand, especially for duty in\r\ntrenches with narrow spaces and sharp projecting corners. There are\r\nnumerous instances of men waking up and getting excited, who not only\r\ngassed themselves, but in their mad efforts to find their masks, or\r\nto escape from the gas, knocked others down, disarranging their masks\r\nand causing the gassing of from one to three or four additional men.\r\nThe confusion inherent in any gas attack was heightened in the latter\r\nstages of the war by heavy shrapnel and high explosive bombardments\r\nthat accompanied nearly all projector and cloud gas attacks for that\r\nvery purpose. The bombardment was continued for three or four hours to\r\ncause exhaustion and removal of the mask and to prevent the removal of\r\nthe gassed patients from the gassed area.\r\n\r\n\r\nDETECTION OF GASES\r\n\r\nEfforts were made by the enemy and by all the Allies throughout the war\r\nto invent a mechanical detector that would show when gas was present\r\nin dangerous quantities. While scores, perhaps hundreds, of these were\r\ninvented none proved simple, quick, or certain enough in action to make\r\ntheir adoption desirable. In every case it was necessary to rely on\r\nthe sense of smell. Thus it was that as the war wore on, more and more\r\nattention was given to training officers and non-commissioned officers\r\nto detect various kinds of gases in dangerous quantities by the sense\r\nof smell.\r\n\r\nIn the American Gas Defense School for officers this was done wholly by\r\nusing captured German gases. This was because certain gases have quite\r\ndifferent smells, depending upon the impurities in the gas and also\r\nupon the solvents sometimes mixed with them. Thus the German mustard\r\ngas has a mustard smell, while the Allies mustard gas, due to a slight\r\ndifference in the method of manufacture, has a very perfect garlic\r\nodor. Not only must officers and men who handle gas training know the\r\nsmell of the various gases, but they must know when the concentration\r\nof each is high enough to be dangerous. This is not easy to learn\r\nbecause the strength of the various gases in dangerous concentrations\r\nvaries through wide limits. Not only does the strength of the gases\r\nvary and the sharpness of the odors accordingly, but the mingling of\r\npoisonous gases with other gases from high explosive and shrapnel tends\r\nto obscure these odors and make them more difficult of detection.\r\n\r\n\r\nDECEPTIVE GASES\r\n\r\nA great deal of thought was given toward the end of the war to the\r\nsubject of deceptive gases which could by powerful or peculiar odors\r\nmask the dangerous gases. This masking was to deceive the enemy when\r\ndangerous gases were present or to admit an attack without masks while\r\nthe enemy was wearing his through thinking there was a dangerous gas\r\nwhen as a matter of fact none existed.\r\n\r\nIn gas warfare, the German, as well as the Allies, was exercising his\r\ningenuity in devising new and startling methods of making gas attacks.\r\nA well known trick with the German was to fire gases for several days,\r\nparticularly against green troops, in concentrations so slight as to\r\ndo no harm. When he felt that he had lulled those troops to a sense of\r\nthe ineffectiveness of his gas, he sent over a deadly concentration.\r\nIn spite of the warning that this was what was happening, he often\r\nachieved too great a success. Before the war closed, however, the\r\nAmerican was beginning to out-think and out-wit the German in this\r\nmethod of warfare.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSTARD GAS BURNS\r\n\r\nWith the advent of mustard gas which burned the body, a new and serious\r\ndifficulty in protection arose. At first it was thought mustard gas\r\nburned only when the liquid from the bursting shell actually splashed\r\non the clothing or skin. This was unfortunately soon found to be not\r\ntrue. The gas itself rapidly penetrates clothing and burns the skin\r\neven when the concentration of the gas is very low. Probably the\r\nmajority of burns from mustard gas arose from concentrations of gas\r\nconsisting of less than one part of gas to five hundred thousand of\r\nair. Furthermore, the gas is fully fifty per cent cumulative in its\r\neffects, that is, in extremely low concentrations over a period of\r\nhours it will produce more than fifty per cent the effect that a far\r\nhigher concentration would produce in a relatively shorter time.\r\n\r\nThe Allies were not long in discovering that oilcloth afforded very\r\ncomplete protection against mustard gas. The ordinary oilcloth,\r\nhowever, was too thick, too hot and too heavy for general use.\r\nExperiments soon showed that cloth thoroughly impregnated with boiled\r\nlinseed oil would give protection. In order to make this protection\r\nmore perfect a certain amount of paraffin was added. All this made\r\nthe clothing air-tight, rather stiff and always uncomfortable.\r\nNotwithstanding these discomforts, hundreds of thousands of oiled\r\nsuits, and as many pairs of oiled gloves were made and issued to\r\nartillery troops, and to troops especially charged with handling\r\nmustard gas shells, or to those employed in destroying mustard gas in\r\nshell holes by spreading chloride of lime over them.\r\n\r\nThe importance of protection against mustard gas burns led to extensive\r\nresearches being made with a view to finding a cloth which would be\r\ncomfortable and porous and while stopping mustard gas would yet be\r\nsufficiently durable and comfortable to be issued to infantry troops as\r\nwell as to artillery and other special troops. This, it is understood,\r\nhad been achieved, just prior to the Armistice. Still more desirable\r\nwould be the discovery of a chemical substance which could be applied\r\nto all uniforms and Army clothing and thus protect the regulation\r\nclothing against the penetration of mustard gas, and thereby avoid\r\ncarrying extra clothing for that special purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTECTING TROOPS BY MOVING THEM FROM INFECTED AREAS\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was fully realized that mustard gas persisted for\r\nseveral days it was decided to run complete reliefs of men into and\r\nout of areas that had been heavily shelled with mustard gas, or better\r\nstill, where practicable, to completely evacuate the area. Inasmuch\r\nas the gas is dangerous to friend and foe alike, this method was\r\ncomparatively safe and was used to a very considerable extent. With\r\nthe warfare of movement that existed over most of the active front\r\nthroughout the season of 1918, this moving of troops out of infected\r\nareas became highly important and, when skillfully done, often resulted\r\nin a great saving of troops and at the same time prevented the enemy\r\nfrom receiving any particular tactical advantage from his mustard gas\r\nattacks.\r\n\r\nThere was one very excellent example of this a few miles to the\r\nnorthwest of Château-Thierry prior to the counter-offensive of July 18,\r\n1918. At that time the Germans heavily shelled with mustard gas four or\r\nfive small woods and two or three villages. It was necessary for the\r\nmen to stay in these woods during the day, as they afforded the only\r\nprotection obtainable from machine guns, shrapnel and high explosive.\r\nAt the time this occurred American gas officers generally understood\r\nthe necessity of getting troops out of a mustard gas infected area.\r\nAccordingly all began searching for places safe from the mustard gas.\r\nIn one particular instance the gas officer of a regiment discovered\r\nthat a portion of the woods his men were in was free from the gas,\r\nand the regimental commander, promptly following his advice, moved\r\nhis troops into the free area. As a result of this prompt action the\r\nregiment had only four light gas casualties, although all told there\r\nwere several hundred mustard gas casualties in this attack, the number\r\nper thousand generally being from ten to twenty times that of the\r\nthousand men just mentioned.\r\n\r\n\r\nMIXING POISONOUS GASES\r\n\r\nOn this as well as other occasions the Germans fired some diphosgene\r\nand Blue Cross (Sneezing gas), as well as mustard gas. This added to\r\nthe difficulty of determining areas free from the latter. In the future\r\nsuch mixing of poisonous gases may always be expected and, in addition,\r\ngases which have no value other than that of masking the poisonous\r\nones will be fired. While with practically all gases except mustard\r\ngas a man is comparatively safe while breathing a concentration very\r\nnoticeable to the sense of smell, the only safe rule with mustard gas\r\nis to consider as dangerous any concentration that can be smelled.\r\n\r\nFor the reason that this gas persists longer in calm areas, woods are\r\nalways to be avoided, where practicable, and also, since all gases,\r\nbeing heavier than air, tend to roll into depressions and valleys, they\r\nshould be avoided. There have been a number of authentic cases where\r\nbatteries in hollows or valleys suffered severely from mustard gas,\r\nwhile troops on nearby knolls or ridges were comparatively free, though\r\nthe difference in the amount of shelling of the two places was not\r\nnoticeable.\r\n\r\nOf great importance with all gases is the posting of a sufficient\r\nnumber of sentries around men sleeping within the range of gas shell.\r\nThe worst projector gas attack against the Americans was one where the\r\nprojectors were landed among a group of dugouts containing men asleep\r\nwithout sentries. The result was a very heavy casualty list, coupled\r\nwith a high death rate, the men being gassed in their sleep before they\r\nwere awakened.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESTRUCTION OF MUSTARD GAS\r\n\r\nPrior to the introduction of mustard gas all that was necessary to get\r\nrid of gas was to thoroughly ventilate the spot. Thus in trenches and\r\ndugouts, fires were found to be very efficient, simply because they\r\nproduced a circulation of air. In the early days, among the British,\r\nthe Ayrton fan, a sort of canvas scoop, was used to throw the gas out\r\nof the trenches. While this was taken up in the American Service, it\r\ndid not become very important, since it was found that, under ordinary\r\natmospheric conditions, natural ventilation soon carried the gas out of\r\nthe trench proper, while fires in dugouts were far more efficient than\r\nthe fans. Likewise the Ayrton fan smacked too much of trench warfare\r\nwhich had reached a condition of “stalemate”—a condition that never\r\nappealed to the Americans and a condition that it is hoped never will.\r\n\r\nWith mustard gas, however, conditions were entirely changed. This\r\nliquid having a very high boiling point and evaporating very slowly,\r\nremains for days in the earth and on vegetation and other material\r\nsprinkled with it. This was particularly true in shell holes where the\r\nforce of the explosion drove the gas into the earth around the broken\r\nedges of the hole. While many substances were experimented with, that\r\nwhich proved best and most practical under all conditions, was chloride\r\nof lime. This was used to sprinkle in shell holes, on floors of dugouts\r\nand any other places where the liquid might be splashed from bursting\r\nshells. It was also found very desirable to have a small box of this at\r\nthe entrance to each dugout, so that a person who had been exposed to\r\nmustard gas could thoroughly coat his shoes with it and thus kill the\r\nmustard gas that collected in the mud on the bottom and sides of his\r\nshoes.\r\n\r\n\r\nCARRYING MUSTARD GAS ON CLOTHING\r\n\r\nThere are many instances where the occupants of dugouts were gassed\r\nfrom the gas on the shoes and clothing of men entering the dugout.\r\nNot only were occupants of dugouts thus gassed but a number of nurses\r\nand doctors were gassed while working in closed rooms over patients\r\nsuffering from mustard gas poisoning. Even under the conditions of\r\nwarfare existing where the Americans were generally in action, the\r\nquantity of chloride of lime required amounted to several hundred tons\r\nper month which had to be shipped from the United States. Chloride of\r\nlime was also very convenient to have at hand around shell dumps for\r\nthe purpose of covering up leaky shells, though rules for handling\r\nmustard gas shells usually prescribed that they be fired and where that\r\nwas not practicable to bury them at least five feet under the surface\r\nof the ground. This depth was not so much for the purpose of getting\r\nrid of the gas as it was to get the shell so deep into the ground that\r\nit would not be a danger in any cultivation that might later take place.\r\n\r\n\r\nMUSTARD GAS IN COLD WEATHER\r\n\r\nMuch was learned toward the end of the war about ways of getting\r\nthrough or around areas infected with mustard gas. For instance,\r\nif mustard gas be fired when the weather is in the neighborhood of\r\nfreezing or somewhat below, it will remain on the ground at night\r\nwith so little evaporation as not to be dangerous. The same will be\r\ntrue during the day time if the weather is cloudy as well as cold.\r\nIf, however, the days are bright and the nights cold, mustard gassed\r\nareas can be safely crossed by troops at night provided care is taken\r\nin brush and bushes to protect the feet and clothing from the liquid\r\nsplashed on bushes. If the sun comes out warm in the morning such\r\nareas may be quite dangerous for three to four hours following sun-up\r\nand indeed for the greater part of the day. Quite a large number of\r\ncasualties were ascribed to this fact in the heavy attack on the\r\nBritish front west of Cambrai just prior to the great German drive\r\nagainst Amiens, March 21, 1918.\r\n\r\n\r\nDEGASSING UNITS\r\n\r\nSince mustard gas has a greatly delayed action it was found that if men\r\nwho had been exposed to it could be given a thorough bath with soap and\r\nwater within a half hour or even a full hour, the mustard gas burns\r\nwould be prevented or very greatly reduced in severity. Accordingly\r\ndegassing units were developed consisting essentially of a 5 ton truck\r\nwith a 1200 gallon water tank, fitted with an instantaneous heater and\r\npiping to connect it to portable shower baths. Another truck was kept\r\nloaded with extra suits of underclothing and uniforms. These degassing\r\nunits were to be provided at the rate of two per division. Then, in the\r\nevent of a mustard gas attack anywhere in the division, one of these\r\nunits would be rushed to that vicinity and the men brought out of the\r\nline and given a bath and change of clothing as soon as possible. At\r\nthe same time they were given a drink of bicarbonate of soda water and\r\ntheir eyes, ears, mouth and nasal passages washed with the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nPROTECTING FOOD FROM MUSTARD GAS\r\n\r\nIt was very early learned that mustard gas, or minute particles of\r\nthe liquid gas settling on food, caused the stomach to be burned if\r\nthe food were eaten, just as the eyes, lungs and skin of the body are\r\nburned from gas in the air. This made it necessary then to see that\r\nall food liable to exposure to mustard gas attacks was protected, and\r\ntarred paper for box linings or tops was found by the Gas Service to\r\nfurnish one of the cheapest and most available means of doing this.\r\n\r\n\r\nALARM SIGNALS\r\n\r\nNumerous, indeed, were the devices invented at one time or another with\r\nwhich to sound gas alarms. The English early devised the Strombos horn,\r\na sort of trumpet operated by compressed air contained in cylinders\r\ncarried for that purpose. Its note is penetrating and can be heard,\r\nunder good conditions, for three or four miles. When cloud gas attacks,\r\nwhich occurred only at intervals of two to four months, were the only\r\ngas attacks to be feared, it was easy enough to provide for alarm\r\nsignals by methods as cumbersome and as technically delicate as the\r\nStrombos horn.\r\n\r\nWith the advent of shell gas in general, and mustard gas in particular,\r\nthe number of gas attacks increased enormously. This made it not only\r\nimpossible, but inadvisable also, to furnish sufficient Strombos horns\r\nfor all gas alarms, as gas shell attacks are comparatively local. In\r\nsuch cases, if the Strombos horn is used to give warning, it causes\r\ntroops who are long distances out of the area attacked to take\r\nprecautions against gas with consequent interference with their work or\r\nfighting.\r\n\r\nTo meet these local conditions metal shell cases were first hung up\r\nand the alarm sounded on them. Later steel triangles were used in the\r\nsame way. At a still later date the large policeman’s rattle, well\r\nknown in Europe, was adopted and following that the Klaxon horn. As the\r\nwarfare of movement developed the portability of alarm apparatus became\r\nof prime importance. For those reasons the Klaxon horn and the police\r\nrattle were having a race for popularity when the Armistice was signed.\r\n\r\nA recent gas alarm invention that gives promise is a small siren-like\r\nwhistle fired into the air like a bomb. It is fitted with a parachute\r\nwhich keeps it from falling too rapidly when the bomb explodes and\r\nsets it free. Its tone is said to be very penetrating and to be quite\r\neffective over an ample area. Since future gas alarm signals must be\r\nefficient and must be portable, the lighter and more compact they can\r\nbe made the better; hence the desirability of parachute whistles or\r\nsimilar small handy alarms.\r\n\r\n\r\nISSUING NEW MASKS\r\n\r\nOne of the problems that remained unsolved at the end of the war was\r\nhow to determine when to issue new boxes, or canisters, for masks. One\r\nof the first questions asked by the soldier is how long his mask is\r\ngood in gas, and how long when worn in drill where there is no gas.\r\nThis information is of course decidedly important. Obviously, however,\r\nit is impossible to tell how long a canister will last in a gas attack,\r\nunless the concentration of gas is known—that is, the life of the box\r\nis longer or shorter as the concentration of gas is weak or heavy.\r\n\r\nA realization of this need led mask designers to work very hard, long\r\nbefore the necessity for comfort in a mask was as fully realized as\r\nit was at the end of the war, to increase the length of life of the\r\ncanister. To get longer life they increased the chemicals and this\r\nin turn increased the breathing resistance, thereby adding to the\r\ndiscomfort of the soldier when wearing the mask. Finally, however, it\r\nwas found that in the concentration of gas encountered on an average\r\nin the field, the life of the comparatively small American boxes was\r\nsufficient to last from fifty to one hundred hours, which is longer\r\nthan any gas attack or at least gives time to get out of the gassed\r\narea.\r\n\r\nThe British early appreciated the necessity of knowing when boxes\r\nshould be replaced. They accordingly devised the scheme of furnishing\r\nwith each mask a very small booklet tied to the carrying case in which\r\nthe soldier could not only enter a complete statement of the time he\r\nhad worn the mask but also the statement as to whether it was in gas\r\nor for drill purposes only. The soldier was then taught that if he had\r\nworn the mask, say for forty hours, he should get a new box. But the\r\nscheme didn’t work. In fact, it was one of those things which foresight\r\nmight have shown wouldn’t work. Indeed, any man who in the hell of\r\nbattle can keep such a record completely, should be at once awarded a\r\nDistinguished Service Medal.\r\n\r\nAs gas warfare developed not only were all kinds of gas shells sent\r\nover in a bunch but they were accompanied by high explosive, shrapnel\r\nand anything else in the way of trouble that the enemy possessed. A man\r\nnear the front line, under those conditions, had all he could do and\r\nfrequently more than he could do, to get his mask on and keep it on\r\nwhile doing his bit. Consequently he had no time, even if he had the\r\ninclination, to record how long he had the mask in the various gases.\r\n\r\nIn this connection, after the Armistice was signed we in the field were\r\nrequested to obtain for experimental purposes 10,000 canisters that had\r\nbeen used in battle. Each was to be labeled with the length of time it\r\nhad been worn in or out of gas, and if in gas, the name of each gas\r\nand the time the mask was worn in it. This request is just a sample of\r\nwhat is asked by those who do not realize field conditions. One trip to\r\nthe front would have convinced the one making the request of the utter\r\nimpossibility of complying with it, for really no man knows how long\r\nhe wears a mask in gas. With gas as common and as difficult to detect\r\n(when intermingled with high explosive gases and other smells of the\r\nbattle field) as it was at the end of the war, each man wore the mask\r\njust as long as he could, simply as a matter of precaution.\r\n\r\nBefore hostilities ceased we were trying out a method of calling in say\r\nfifty canisters per division once a week for test in the laboratory. If\r\nthe tests showed the life of the canisters to be short new canisters\r\nwould be issued. While we did not have opportunity to try out this\r\nplan, it gave promise of being the best that could be done. With gas\r\nbecoming an every day affair, the only other alternative would seem\r\nto be to make issues of new boxes at stated intervals. On the other\r\nhand there are no definite records of casualties occurring from the\r\nexhaustion of the chemicals in the box. Undoubtedly some did occur, but\r\nthey were very, very few. In nearly all cases the masks got injured, or\r\nthe box became rusted through before the chemicals gave out.\r\n\r\n\r\nTONNAGE AND NUMBER OF MASKS REQUIRED\r\n\r\nIt will probably be a shock to most people to learn that with more than\r\ntwo million men in France we required nearly 1500 tons of gas material\r\nper month. This tonnage was increasing, rather than decreasing, to\r\ncover protective suits, gloves, pastes, and chloride of lime, as well\r\nas masks. The British type respirator was estimated to last from four\r\nto six months. The active part of the war, in which the Americans took\r\npart, was too short to determine whether this was correct or not. The\r\nindications were, however, that it was about right, considering rest\r\nperiods and fighting periods.\r\n\r\nWith the new American mask, with its much stronger and stiffer face\r\nmaterial, the chances are that the life will be considerably increased\r\nalthough the more constant use of the mask will probably offset its\r\ngreater durability. A longer life of mask would of course be a decided\r\nadvantage as it would not only reduce tonnage, but would reduce\r\nmanufacturing and distribution as well. The estimates on which we were\r\nworking at the end looked forward to requiring from the United States\r\nabout one-third pound per man per day for all troops in France, in\r\norder to keep them supplied with gas defense material and with the\r\ngases used offensively by gas troops. All gas shell, hand grenades,\r\netc., used by other than gas troops required tonnage in addition to the\r\nabove.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUMMING UP\r\n\r\nIn summing up then, it is noted that there are several important things\r\nin defense against gas. First, the mask which protects the eyes and the\r\nlungs. Second, the training that teaches the man how to utilize to best\r\nadvantage the means of protection at his disposal, whether he be alone\r\nor among others. Third, protective clothing that protects hands and\r\nfeet and the skin in general. Fourth, a knowledge of gases and their\r\ntactical use that will enable commanders, whenever possible, to move\r\nmen out of gas infected areas. Fifth, training in the offensive use of\r\ngas, as well as in defensive methods, to teach the man that gas has no\r\nuncanny power and that it is simply one element of war that must be\r\nreckoned with, thus preventing stampedes when there is really no danger.\r\n\r\nWhile these are the salient points in defense against gas, above them\r\nand beyond them lies the vigorous offensive use of gas. This involves\r\nnot only the research, development and manufacture of necessary gases\r\nin peace time, but also the necessary training to enable our nation to\r\nhurl upon the enemy on the field of battle chemical warfare materials\r\nin quantities he cannot hope to attain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nPEACE TIME USES OF GAS\r\n\r\n\r\n“Peace hath her victories no less renowned than war.” Thus runs the\r\nold proverb. In ancient times war profited by peace far more than\r\npeace profited by war if indeed the latter ever actually occurred. The\r\nimplements developed for the chase in peace became the weapons of war.\r\nThis was true of David’s sling-shot, of the spear and of the bow. Even\r\npowder itself was probably intended and used for scores of years for\r\ncelebrations and other peaceful events.\r\n\r\nThe World War reversed this story, especially in its later phases.\r\nThe greater part of the war was fought with implements and machines\r\nprepared in peace either for war or for peaceful purposes. Such\r\nimplements were the aeroplane, submarine, truck, automobile and\r\ngasoline motors in general. The first gas attack, which was simply an\r\nadaptation of the peacetime use of the chemical chlorine, inaugurated\r\nthe change. Gas was so new and instantly recognized as so powerful that\r\nthe best brains in research among all the first class powers were put\r\nto work to develop other gases and other means of projecting them upon\r\nthe enemy. The result was that in the short space of three and one-half\r\nyears a number of substances were discovered, or experimented with\r\nanew, that are aiding today and will continue to aid in the future in\r\nthe peaceful life of every nation.\r\n\r\nChlorine is even more valuable than ever as a disinfectant and water\r\npurifier. It is the greatest bleaching material in the world, and\r\nhas innumerable other uses in the laboratory. Chloropicrin, cyanogen\r\nchloride and cyanogen bromide are found to be very well adapted to\r\nthe killing of weevil and other similar insect destroyers of grain.\r\nHydrocyanic acid gas is the greatest destroyer today of insect pests\r\nthat otherwise would ruin the beautiful orange and lemon groves of\r\nCalifornia and the South.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 120.]\r\n\r\nPhosgene, so extensively used in the war both in cloud gas and in\r\nshell, is finding an ever increasing use in the making of brilliant\r\ndyes—pinks, greens, blues and violets. On account of its cheapness\r\nand simplicity of manufacture, it has great possibilities in the\r\ndestruction of rodents such as rats around wharves, warehouses and\r\nsimilar places that are inaccessible to any other means of reaching\r\nthose pests. Since phosgene is highly corrosive of steel, iron, copper\r\nand brass, it cannot be used successfully in places where those metals\r\nare present.\r\n\r\nInstead of phosgene for killing rodents and the like in storehouses and\r\nwarehouses, cyanogen bromide has been developed. This is a solid and\r\ncan be burned like an ordinary sulphur candle. It is much safer for\r\nthe purpose of fumigating rooms and buildings than is hydrocyanic acid\r\ngas when so used. This is for the reason that cyanogen bromide is an\r\nexcellent lachrymator in quantities too minute to cause any injury to\r\nthe lungs. It will thus give warning to anyone attempting to enter a\r\nplace where some of the gas may still linger.\r\n\r\nAmong tear gases, the new chloracetophenone, a solid, is perhaps the\r\ngreatest of all. When driven off by heat it first appears as a light\r\nbluish colored cloud. This cloud is instantly so irritating to the eyes\r\nthat within a second anyone in the path of the cloud is temporarily\r\nblinded. It causes considerable smarting and very profuse tears\r\nwhich even in the smallest amount continue for two to five minutes.\r\nIn greater quantities it would continue longer. So far as can be\r\nascertained, it is absolutely harmless so far as any permanent injuries\r\nare concerned.\r\n\r\nConsidering that it is instantly effective, that minute quantities\r\nare unbearable to the eyes, that it can be put in hand grenades or\r\nother small containers and driven off by a heating mixture which will\r\nnot ignite even a pile of papers, and that it needs no explosion to\r\nburst the grenade (all that is used is a light cap, set off by the\r\naction of the spring, sufficient to ignite the burning charge), the\r\nfuture will see every police department in the land outfitted with\r\nchloracetophenone or other similar grenades. Every sheriff’s office,\r\nevery jail and every penitentiary will have a supply of them. No jail\r\nbreaking, no lynching, no rioting can succeed where these grenades are\r\navailable. Huge crowds can be set to weeping instantly so that no man\r\ncan see and no mob will continue once it is blinded with irritating\r\ntears. More than that, it is an extremely difficult gas to keep out of\r\nmasks, ordinary masks of the World War being entirely useless against\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe same is true of diphenylaminechlorarsine. This is not a tear\r\ngas but it is extraordinarily irritating to the lungs, throat and\r\nnose, where it causes pains and burning sensations, and in higher\r\nconcentrations vomiting. It is hardly poisonous at all so that it\r\nis extremely difficult to get enough to cause danger to life. This\r\nis mentioned because of its possible use for the protection of bank\r\nvaults, safes, and strong rooms generally.\r\n\r\nThere are many other gases that can be used for this same purpose. It\r\nis presumed that gases that are not powerful enough to kill are the\r\nones desired, and there are half a dozen at least that can be so used.\r\nIf desired deadly gases can just as readily be used. Already a number\r\nof inventors are at work on the problem, with some plans practically\r\ncompletely worked out and models made.\r\n\r\nIt has been suggested that one of these gases could be used by trappers\r\nin trapping wild animals. Hydrocyanic acid gas may be so used. It acts\r\nquickly and is very rapidly dissipated. An animal exposed to the fumes\r\nwould die quickly and the trap be safe to approach within two minutes\r\nafter it was sprung. It is said that the loss from animals working\r\ntheir way out of traps by one means or another is nearly 20 per cent.\r\nMore than this, it would meet the objections of the S. P. C. A. in that\r\nthe animal would not suffer from having its limbs torn and lacerated by\r\nthe trap.\r\n\r\nAttempts are being made to attack the locust of the Philippines and the\r\nfar west and the boll weevil of the cotton states of the South. So far\r\nthese tests have not proven more successful than other methods, but\r\ninasmuch as the number of gases available for trial are so great and\r\nthe value of success of so much importance, this research should be\r\ncontinued on a large scale to definitely determine whether poisonous\r\ngas can be used to eradicate these pests—especially the boll weevil.\r\n\r\nAs an interesting application of war materials to peaceful uses,\r\nwe may consider the case of cellulose-acetate, known during the\r\nwar as “aeroplane dope,” the material used to coat the linen\r\ncovering aeroplane wings. With a little further manipulation, this\r\ncellulose-acetate, or aeroplane dope, becomes artificial silk—a silk\r\nthat today is generally equal to the best natural silk—and which\r\npromises in the future to become a standard product better in every way\r\nthan that from the silk worm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 121.]\r\n\r\nThese few examples of the peacetime value of gas are worthy of thought\r\nfrom another standpoint. Being so valuable, their use in peace will\r\nnot be stopped. If they are thus manufactured and used in peace, they\r\nwill always be available for use in war, and as the experience of the\r\nWorld War proved, they certainly will be so used even should anybody be\r\nfoolish enough to try to abolish their use. As for this latter idea,\r\nthe world might as well recognize at once that half-way measures in war\r\nsimply invite disaster.\r\n\r\nThis chapter would not be complete without a brief statement of the\r\nnecessity of a thoroughly developed chemical industry in the United\r\nStates as a vital national necessity if the United States is to have\r\nreal preparedness for a future struggle. As will be indicated a\r\nlittle later, no one branch of the chemical industry can be allowed\r\nto go out of existence without endangering some part of the scheme of\r\npreparedness.\r\n\r\nLet us consider first the coal tar industry. Coal tar is a by-product\r\nof coke ovens or the manufacture of artificial gas from coal. The coal\r\ntar industry is of the utmost importance because in the coal tars\r\nare the bases of nearly all of the modern dyes, a large percentage\r\nof the modern medicines, most of the modern high explosives, a large\r\nproportion of poisonous gases, modern perfumes, and photographic\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\nA consideration of these titles alone shows how vital the coal tar\r\nindustry is. The coal tar as it comes to us as a by-product is\r\ndistilled, giving off at different temperatures a series of compounds\r\ncalled crudes. Ten of these are of very great importance. The first\r\nfive are benzene, toluene, naphthalene, anthracene and phenol (carbolic\r\nacid). The second group comprises xylene, methylanthracene, cresol,\r\ncarbazol and phenanthrene.\r\n\r\nThese, when treated with other chemicals, produce a series of compounds\r\ncalled intermediates, of which there are some 300 now known. From\r\nthese intermediates by different steps are produced either dyes, high\r\nexplosives, poisonous gases, pharmaceuticals, perfumes or photographic\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\nWe have all heard that Germany controlled the dye industry of the world\r\nprior to the World War. A little study of the above brief statement of\r\nwhat is contained in the coal tar industry along with dyes will show in\r\na measure one of the reasons why Germany felt that she could win a war\r\nagainst the world. That she came so desperately close to winning that\r\nwar is proof of the soundness of her view.\r\n\r\nIn many of the processes are needed the heavy chemicals such as\r\nchlorine, sulfuric acid, nitric acid, hydrochloric acid and the like.\r\nThe alcohol industry is also of very great importance. Grain alcohol\r\nis used extensively in nearly all research problems and in very great\r\nquantities in many commercial processes such as the manufacture of\r\nartificial silk and for gasoline engines in addition to its use in\r\ncompounding medicines. It is of very great importance to the Chemical\r\nWarfare Service in that from grain alcohol is obtained ethylene gas,\r\none of the three essentials in the manufacture of mustard gas. While\r\nthis ethylene may be obtained from many sources, the most available\r\nsource, considering ease of transportation and keeping qualities, is in\r\nthe form of grain alcohol.\r\n\r\nAllied to the chemical industries just mentioned is the nitrate\r\nindustry for making nitric acid from the nitrogen of the air. Nitrates\r\nare used in many processes of chemical manufacture and particularly\r\nin those for the production of smokeless powders. The fertilizer\r\nindustry is of large importance because it deals with phosphorus, white\r\nphosphorus being not only one of the best smoke producing materials\r\nbut a material that is, as stated elsewhere, of great use against men\r\nthrough its powerful burning qualities.\r\n\r\nAnother point not mentioned above in connection with these industries\r\nis the training of chemists, chemical engineers and the building up of\r\nplants for the manufacture of chemicals, all of which are necessary\r\nsources of supply for wartime needs. Chemists are needed in the field,\r\nin the laboratory and in manufacturing plants. The greater their\r\nnumber, the more efficiently can these materials be handled, and since\r\nchemicals as such will probably cause more than 50 per cent of all\r\ncasualties in future wars, their value is almost unlimited.\r\n\r\nInstead of trying to ameliorate the ravages of war, let us turn\r\nevery endeavor towards abolishing all war, remembering that the most\r\nscientific nations should be the most highly civilized, and the\r\nones most desirous of abolishing war. If those nations will push\r\nevery scientific development to the point where by the aid of their\r\nscientific achievements they can overcome any lesser scientific\r\npeoples, the end of war should be in sight.\r\n\r\nHowever, we can never be certain that war is abolished until we\r\nconvince at least a majority of the world that war is disastrous to\r\nthe conqueror as well as to the conquered, and that any dispute can be\r\nsettled peacefully if both parties will meet on the common ground of\r\njustice and a square deal.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nTHE FUTURE OF CHEMICAL WARFARE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pioneer, no matter what the line of endeavor, encounters\r\ndifficulties caused by his fellow-men just in proportion as the thing\r\npioneered promises results. If the promise be small, the difficulties\r\nusually encountered are only those necessary to make the venture a\r\nsuccess. If, however, the results promise to be great, and especially\r\nif the rewards to the inventor and those working with him promise to\r\nbe considerable, the difficulties thrown in the way of the venture\r\nbecome greater and greater. Indeed whenever great results are promised,\r\nenvy is engendered in those in other lines whose importance may be\r\ndiminished, or who are so short-sighted as to be always opposed to\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nChemical warfare has had, and is still having, its full share of these\r\ndifficulties. From the very day when chlorine, known to the world as\r\na benign substance highly useful in sanitation, water purification,\r\ngold mining and bleaching was put into use as a poisonous gas, chemical\r\nwarfare has loomed larger and larger as a factor to be considered in\r\nall future wars. Chlorine was first used in the cylinders designed for\r\nshipping it. These cylinders were poorly adapted for warfare, and made\r\nmethods of preparing gas attacks extremely laborious, cumbersome and\r\ntime-consuming.\r\n\r\nIt was not many months, however, until different gases began to appear\r\nin large quantities in shells and bombs, while the close of the war, 3½\r\nyears later, saw the development of gas in solid form whereby it could\r\nbe carried with the utmost safety under all conditions—a solid which\r\ncould become dangerous only when the heating mixture, that freed the\r\ngas, was properly ignited.\r\n\r\nWhile some of the chemicals developed for use in war prior to the\r\nArmistice have been made known to the world, a number of others have\r\nnot. More than this, every nation of first class importance has\r\ncontinued to pursue more or less energetically studies into chemical\r\nwarfare. These studies will continue, and we must expect that new\r\ngases, new methods of turning them loose, and new tactical uses will be\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nAlready it is clearly foreseen that these gases will be used by every\r\nbranch of the Army and the Navy. While chemicals were not used by the\r\nAir Service in the last war, it was even then realized that there was\r\nno material reason why they should not have been so used. That they\r\nwill be used in the future by the Air Service, and probably on a large\r\nscale, is certain. The Navy, too, will use gases, and probably on a\r\nconsiderable scale. Thus chemical materials as such become the most\r\nuniversal of all weapons of war.\r\n\r\nSome of the poisonous gases are so powerful in minute quantities and\r\nevaporate so slowly that their liberation does not produce sufficient\r\ncondensation to cause a cloud. Consequently, we have gases that cannot\r\nbe seen. Others form clouds by themselves, such, for instance, as\r\nthe toxic smoke candle, where the solid is driven off by heating,\r\nwhile still others cause clouds of condensed vapor. This brings the\r\ndiscussion into the realm of ordinary smokes that have no irritating\r\nand no poisonous effects.\r\n\r\nThese smokes are extremely valuable where the purpose is to form a\r\nscreen, whether it be to hide the advance of troops or to cut off the\r\nview of observers. These smokes are equally useful on land and on\r\nsea. So great is the decrease in efficiency of the rifle or machine\r\ngun, and of artillery even when firing at troops that cannot be seen,\r\nthat smoke for screening purposes will be used on every future field\r\nof battle. When firing through a screen of smoke, a man has certainly\r\nless than one-quarter the chance to hit his target that he would have\r\nwere the target in plain view. Since smoke clouds may or may not be\r\npoisonous and since smoke will be used in every battle, there is opened\r\nup an unlimited field for the exercise of ingenuity in making these\r\nsmoke clouds poisonous or non-poisonous at will. It also opens up an\r\nunlimited field for the well-trained chemical warfare officer who can\r\ntell in any smoke cloud whether gas be present and whether, if present,\r\nit is in sufficient concentration to be dangerous.\r\n\r\nAt the risk of repetition, it is again stated that there is no gas\r\nthat will kill or even permanently injure in any quantity that cannot\r\nbe detected. For every gas, there is a certain minimum amount in each\r\ncubic foot of air that is necessary to cause any injury. In nearly all\r\ngases, this minimum amount is sufficient to be readily noticeable by a\r\ntrained chemical warfare officer through the sense of smell.\r\n\r\nIt would be idle to attempt to enumerate the ways and means by\r\nwhich chemicals will be used in the future. In fact, one can hardly\r\nconceive of a situation where gas or smoke will not be employed, for\r\nthese materials may be liquids or solids that either automatically,\r\nupon exposure to the air, turn into gas, or which are pulverized by\r\nhigh explosive, or driven off by heat. This varied character of the\r\nmaterials enables them to be used in every sort of artillery shell,\r\nbomb or other container carried to the field of battle.\r\n\r\nSome of the gases are extremely powerful as irritants to the nose\r\nand throat in very minute quantities, while at the same time being\r\nhighly poisonous in high concentrations. Diphenylchloroarsine,\r\nused extensively by the Germans in high explosive shell, is more\r\npoisonous than phosgene, the most deadly gas in general use in the\r\npast war. In addition, it has the quality of causing an intolerable\r\nburning sensation in the nose, throat, and lungs, in extremely minute\r\nquantities. This material can be kept out of masks only by filters,\r\nwhereas true gases are taken out by charcoal and chemical granules.\r\n\r\nThere is still another quality which helps make chemical warfare the\r\nmost powerful weapon of war. Gas is the only substance used in war\r\nwhich can be counted on to do its work as efficiently at night as in\r\nthe daytime. Indeed, it is often more effective at night than in the\r\ndaytime, because the man who goes to sleep without his mask on, who is\r\ncareless, who loses his mask, or who becomes excited in the darkness\r\nof night, becomes a casualty, and the past war showed that these\r\ncasualties were decidedly numerous even when the troops knew almost to\r\nthe minute the time the gas would arrive.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, chemical warfare is an agency that must not only be\r\nreckoned with by every civilized nation in the future, but is one\r\nwhich civilized nations should not hesitate to use. When properly\r\nsafe-guarded with masks and other safety devices, it gives to the most\r\nscientific and most ingenious people a great advantage over the less\r\nscientific and less ingenious. Then why should the United States or any\r\nother highly civilized country consider giving up chemical warfare?\r\nTo say that its use against savages is not a fair method of fighting,\r\nbecause the savages are not equipped with it, is arrant nonsense. No\r\nnation considers such things today. If they had, our American troops,\r\nwhen fighting the Moros in the Philippine Islands, would have had to\r\nwear the breechclout and use only swords and spears.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the opposition of certain people who, through ignorance\r\nor for other reasons, have fought it, chemical warfare has come to\r\nstay, and just in proportion as the United States gives chemical\r\nwarfare its proper place in its military establishment, just in that\r\nproportion will the United States be ready to meet any or all comers\r\nin the future, for the United States has incomparable resources in the\r\nshape of the crude materials—power, salt, sulfur and the like—that are\r\nnecessary in the manufacture of gases.\r\n\r\nIf, then, there be developed industries for manufacturing these gases\r\nin time of war, and if the training of the army in chemical warfare be\r\nthorough and extensive, the United States will have more than an equal\r\nchance with any other nation or combination of nations in any future\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nIt is just as sportsman-like to fight with chemical warfare materials\r\nas it is to fight with machine guns. The enemy will know more or less\r\naccurately our chemical warfare materials and our methods, and we will\r\nhave the same information about the enemy. It is thus a matching of\r\nwits just as much as in the days when the Knights of the Round Table\r\nfought with swords or with spears on horseback. The American is a pure\r\nsportsman and asks odds of no man. He does ask, though, that he be\r\ngiven a square deal. He is unwilling to agree not to use a powerful\r\nweapon of war when he knows that an outlaw nation would use it against\r\nhim if that outlaw nation could achieve success by so doing. How much\r\nbetter it is to say to the world that we are going to use chemical\r\nwarfare to the greatest extent possible in any future struggle. In\r\nannouncing that we would repeat as always that we are making these\r\npreparations only for defense, and who is there who dares question our\r\nright to do so?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n    Absorbents, Requirements of, 237\r\n      Testing, 259\r\n    Absorptive activity, 237\r\n    Absorptive capacity, 238\r\n    Aeroplane, Smoke screen, 309\r\n    American Tissot mask, 224\r\n    Ammonia canister, 230\r\n    Ammonium chloride smoke, 327\r\n    Animals, Susceptibility to mustard gas, 173\r\n    Anthracite coal, Activation of, 249\r\n    A.
