Each volume is the work of a writer who is\r\naccepted as an authority on his own subject-matter. The books are\r\nnot to be considered as primers, but present thoroughly digested\r\ninformation on the relations borne by each great division of science\r\nto the changes in human ideas and to the intellectual development\r\nof mankind. The monographs explain how the principal scientific\r\ndiscoveries have been arrived at and the names of the workers to whom\r\nsuch discoveries are due.\r\n\r\nThe books will comprise each about 200 pages. Each volume will contain\r\nfrom 12 to 16 illustrations, including portraits of the discoverers and\r\nexplanatory views and diagrams. Each volume contains also a concise but\r\ncomprehensive bibliography of the subject-matter. The following volumes\r\nwill be issued during the course of the autumn of 1909.\r\n\r\n\r\n  =The History of Astronomy.=\r\n\r\n    By GEORGE FORBES, M.A., F.R.S., M. Inst.

The monumental records of Egypt and the\r\naccounts left us by Herodotus and other writers show that the ancient\r\nEgyptians, among the earliest nations of whom we have any records,\r\nhad a considerable knowledge of processes essentially chemical in\r\ntheir nature. Their priests were adepts in certain chemical arts, and\r\nchemical laboratories were occasionally attached to their temples, as\r\nat Thebes, Memphis, and Heliopolis. It is to be supposed, too, that\r\nin a cultured class, as the priesthood undoubtedly was, there would\r\nbe now and again curious and ingenious persons who would speculate on\r\nthe nature and causes of the phenomena which they observed. But there\r\nis no certain evidence that the Egyptians ever pursued chemistry\r\nin the spirit of science, or even in the manner in which they and\r\nthe Chaldæans followed, for example, astronomy or mathematics. The\r\noperations of chemistry as performed by them were of the nature of\r\nmanufacturing processes, empirical in character and utilitarian in\r\nresult. It was comparatively late in the world’s history that men were\r\nfound willing to occupy themselves in chemical pursuits in order to\r\ngain an insight into the nature of chemical change, and to learn the\r\ncauses and conditions of its action.\r\n\r\nAlthough we have cited the ancient Egyptians as practising the chemical\r\narts, there is no proof that these arts actually originated with them.\r\nChina, India, Chaldæa have each in turn been regarded as the birthplace\r\nof the various technical processes from which chemistry may be said to\r\nhave taken its rise. Nevertheless, it is mainly from Egyptian records,\r\nor from writings avowedly based on information from Egyptian sources,\r\nthat such knowledge as we possess of the earliest chemical processes is\r\nderived. It is significant that the word “chemistry” has its origin in\r\n_chemi_, “the black land,” the ancient name for Egypt. The art itself\r\nwas constantly spoken of as the “Egyptian art.”\r\n\r\n“The word _chemistry_,” says Boerhaave in the Prolegomena of his _New\r\nMethod of Chemistry_ (Shaw and Chambers’s translation, London, 1727),\r\n\r\n  in _Greek_ should be wrote χημíα, and in _Latin_ and _English_\r\n  _chemia_ and _chemistry_; not as usual, _chymia_ and _chymistry_.\r\n\r\n  The first author in whom the word is found is _Plutarch_, who\r\n  lived under the Emperors _Domitian_, _Nerva_, and _Trajan_. That\r\n  philosopher, in his treatise of _Isis_ and _Osiris_, takes occasion\r\n  to observe that _Egypt, in the sacred dialect of the country, was\r\n  called by the same name as the_ black _of the eye_—viz., χημíα—by\r\n  which he seems to intimate that the word _chemia_ in the _Egyptian_\r\n  language signified black, and that the country, _Egypt_, might take\r\n  its denomination from the _blackness_ of the soil.\r\n\r\n  But [continues Boerhaave] the etymology and grammatical\r\n  signification of the name is not so easily dispatched. The critics\r\n  and antiquaries, among whom it has been a great subject of inquiry,\r\n  will not let it pass without some further disquisition. Instead of\r\n  _black_, some will have it originally denote _secret_, or _occult_;\r\n  and hence derive it from the _Hebrew_ _chaman_, or _haman_—a\r\n  _mystery_, whose radix is _cham_. And, accordingly, _Plutarch_\r\n  observes that _Egypt_, in the same sacred dialect, is sometimes\r\n  wrote in _Greek_ χαμíα—_chamia_; whence the word is easily deduced\r\n  further from _Cham_, eldest son of Noah, by whom Egypt was first\r\n  peopled after the deluge, and from whom, in the Scripture style,\r\n  it is called the _land of Cham_, or _Chem_. Now, that _chaman_,\r\n  or _haman_, properly signifies _secret_ appears from the same\r\n  _Plutarch_, who, mentioning an ancient author named _Menethes\r\n  Sibonita_, who had asserted that _Ammon_ and _Hammon_ were used\r\n  to denote the god of _Egypt_, _Plutarch_ takes this occasion to\r\n  observe that in the _Egyptian_ language anything secret or occult\r\n  was called by the same name, ἅμμον—_Hammon_.... Lastly, the learned\r\n  _Bochart_, keeping to the same sense of the word, chooses to derive\r\n  it from the _Arabic_ _chema_, or _kema_—to _hide_; adding that\r\n  there is an _Arabic_ book of secrets called by the same name _Kemi_.\r\n\r\nFrom the whole of which Boerhaave gathers that chemistry was thus\r\noriginally denominated because it was considered of old as “not fit to\r\nbe divulged to the populace, but treasured up as a religious _secret_.”\r\n\r\nIf we are to credit Zozimus the Panopolite, who is said to have lived\r\nabout the beginning of the fifth century, there were sound reasons for\r\nthus treasuring up chemistry as a religious secret, since, as it sprang\r\nfrom the _pretium amoris_, its origin was not too reputable. “What the\r\ndivine writings relate is that the angels, enflamed with the desire\r\nof women, instructed ’em in all the works and mysteries of nature.\r\nFor which indiscretion they were excluded heaven, as having taught\r\nmen things unfit for ’em to know.” And Scaliger asserts that “Hermes\r\ntestifies as much; and all our learning, both open and occult, confirms\r\nthe account.” But who Hermes was, adds that author, is hard to say, for\r\nnone of his writings has survived to our age, “that lately published in\r\nItaly under the name of _Hermes Trismegistus_ being a manifest forgery.”\r\n\r\nThis legend of the “feministic” origin of chemistry is in reality much\r\nolder than the fifth century of our era, and is but a variant of that\r\nwhich, according to Jewish writers, led to the expulsion of man from\r\nParadise. A similar myth was current among the Phœnicians, Persians,\r\nGreeks, and Magi. We trace it in the legend of Sibylla, who demanded,\r\nas the price of her favour to Phœbus, not only length of years,\r\nbut a knowledge of the divine _arcanum_. Some of the ecclesiastics\r\nwho elaborated these myths are particular in their accounts of the\r\nmysteries thus imparted. They included the use of charms, a knowledge\r\nof gold and silver and precious stones, the art of dyeing, of painting\r\nthe eyebrows, etc.—the kind of _arcana_, in fact, which women in all\r\nages were presumably most keen to know. It is, however, significant\r\nthat in all allusions to _chemia_, even after the translation of\r\nthe seat of the Roman Empire to Constantinople, it is implied that\r\na knowledge of it was a sacred mystery to be known only to the\r\npriesthood, and jealously guarded by them. It was characteristic of\r\nwriters who had affixed an eternal stigma on Eve to make the sex in\r\ngeneral answerable for an illicit knowledge of “things unfit for men to\r\nknow.”\r\n\r\nFor, in reality, chemistry originated with men, and it was not so much\r\nin the love of women as of wine that it took its rise.\r\n\r\nThe manufacture of _alcohol_ by processes of fermentation is probably\r\nthe oldest of the chemical arts. The word _wine_ means, in fact, a\r\n_product of fermentation_. Mosaic history relates that Noah, soon\r\nafter he got to dry land, “planted a vineyard and drank of the wine,”\r\nwith results that would appear to show that the potency of wine\r\nwas not unfamiliar to him. Diodorus Siculus, who studied Egyptian\r\nantiquities when Egypt was a Roman province, states that the ancient\r\nEgyptians ascribed the origin of wine to Osiris. It was a sacrificial\r\noffering even in the earliest times, as was bread. Wine seems to have\r\nbeen prepared by the Chinese as far back as the time of the Emperor\r\nYü, _circa_ 2220 B.C. Beer was manufactured in Egypt in the time of\r\nSenwosret III. (Sesostris) B.C. 1880.\r\n\r\nThe Egyptians were skilled in dyeing and in the manufacture of\r\nleather, and in the production and working of metals and alloys. They\r\nwere familiar with the methods of tempering iron. They made glass,\r\nartificial gems, and enamels. The oldest known enamel was found as an\r\namulet on the Egyptian Queen Aahotep (1700 B.C.), and glass beads were\r\nmade before the time of Thutmosis III. (1475 B.C.). The Jews knew of\r\ngold, silver, copper, iron, lead, and tin. Indeed, it is through them\r\nand the Phœnicians, who were among the earliest of traders, that Europe\r\nwas gradually made acquainted with many technical products of Eastern\r\norigin.\r\n\r\nThe beginnings of the art of extracting and working of metals are\r\nlost in the mists of antiquity; the chemistry of metals, indeed, has\r\nbeen said to be almost coeval with mankind. Diodorus Siculus found\r\ntraditions in Egypt as to the first inventor of metallurgical processes\r\nidentical with that of the son of Lamech and Zillah, Tubal-cain, or\r\nTuval-cain, of the Hebrews—the Vulcan of the Romans.\r\n\r\n_Gold_ was undoubtedly one of the earliest metals to be made use of by\r\nmen, as it probably was one of the first to be discovered. It occurs\r\nfree in nature, and is met with in many rocks and in the sands of\r\nrivers. Its colour, lustre, and density would early attract attention\r\nto it; and its malleability and ductility and the ease with which it\r\ncould be fashioned, together with its unalterability, would render it\r\nvaluable. Ethiopian and Nubian gold were known from the earliest times,\r\nand quartz crushing and gold washing were practised by the Egyptians.\r\nRepresentations of these processes have been found on Egyptian\r\ntombs dating from 2500 B.C. Gold-wire was used by the Egyptians for\r\nembroidery, and they practised plating, gilding, and inlaying as far\r\nback as 2000 B.C.\r\n\r\n_Silver_ also was employed by them, and appears, like gold, to have\r\nbeen coined into money. It was originally known as “white gold.”\r\nSome of the oldest coins in existence are alloys of silver and gold,\r\nobtained probably by the fusion of naturally occurring argentiferous\r\ngold, such as the pale gold of the Pactolus. Such an alloy was termed\r\n_electrum_, from its resemblance in colour to amber.\r\n\r\n_Copper_ is also found to a limited extent in the metallic state, but\r\nprobably the greater part of that used by the ancients was obtained\r\nfrom its ores, which are comparatively abundant and readily smelted.\r\nIt was also used for coinage by the Egyptians, and was fashioned by\r\nthem into a variety of utensils and implements. The older writers drew\r\nno clear distinction between copper, bronze, and brass, and the terms\r\ndesignating them—_æs_ and χαλκός—are frequently employed; as by Pliny,\r\nindiscriminately. The statement in Deut. viii. 9—“Out of whose hills\r\nthou mayest dig brass”—obviously cannot mean an alloy of copper and\r\nzinc, since this does not occur naturally.\r\n\r\nPure copper is too soft a metal to be used for swords and cutting\r\ninstruments, but copper ores frequently contain associated metals, as,\r\nfor example, tin, which would confer upon the copper the necessary\r\nhardness to enable it to be fashioned into weapons. Such copper would\r\nbe of the character of bronze, and it was known to the early workers\r\nthat the nature of the metal was greatly modified by the selection\r\nof ores from particular localities. It was comparatively late in the\r\nmetallurgical history of copper that bronze was produced by knowingly\r\nadding tin to the metal.\r\n\r\nCopper was largely used by the Romans, who obtained it from Cyprus; it\r\nwas known to them as _æs Cyprium_, and eventually _Cuprum_, whence we\r\nobtain the chemical symbol Cu. What the Romans called _æs_ was found\r\nalso at Chalkis, in Eubœa, whence χαλκός, the Greek word for copper.\r\n\r\n_Aurichalcum_, or golden copper—that is, brass—was well known to the\r\nearly workers in copper, and was made in Pliny’s time by heating\r\ntogether copper, cadmia (calamine), and charcoal.\r\n\r\nBell metal was employed by the Assyrians, and bronze was cast by the\r\nEgyptians for the manufacture of mirrors, vases, shields, etc., as far\r\nback as 2000 B.C. Statuary bronze, largely used by the Romans, usually\r\ncontained more or less lead.\r\n\r\n_Tin_, which was also known to the early Egyptians, would appear to\r\nhave been first obtained from the East Indies, and to have been known\r\nunder the Sanscrit name of _Kastîra_ (_Kâs_, to shine), whence we have\r\nthe Arabic word for tin, _Kàsdir_, and the Greek κασσίτερος, used by\r\nHomer and Hesiod. Tin ores are found in Britain (Cornwall), and were\r\nbrought thence by the Phœnicians. The group of islands, including the\r\nScilly Islands and the larger island to the east (Britain), was known\r\nto the Romans as the _Insulæ Cassiterides_.\r\n\r\nPliny states that the tin is found in grains in alluvial soil, from\r\nwhich it is obtained by washing; but he gives no description of the\r\nmethod of smelting. The Latin word for tin was _stannum_; it was also\r\nknown as _plumbum album_, in contradistinction to lead, which was\r\ncalled _plumbum nigrum_. Tin was used by the Romans for covering the\r\ninside of copper vessels, and was also occasionally employed in the\r\nconstruction of mirrors.\r\n\r\n_Lead_ was well known to the Egyptians. In Pliny’s time it was mainly\r\nprocured from Spain and from Britain (Derbyshire). Leaden pipes were\r\nused by the Romans for the conveyance of water, and sheet lead was\r\nemployed by them for roofing purposes. The Romans were also aware of\r\nalloys of lead and tin. _Argentarium_ was composed of equal parts of\r\nlead and tin; _tertiarium_, used as a solder, consisted of two parts of\r\nlead and one part of tin.\r\n\r\n_Iron_, although now the most important of the common metals, was not\r\nin general use until long after the discovery of gold, silver, and\r\ncopper. This was probably due to the fact that, although its ores\r\nare relatively abundant and widely distributed, its extraction as a\r\nmetal demanded greater skill and more appliances than were possessed\r\nby the earlier races. Metallic iron was, however, well known to the\r\nEgyptians, who employed it in the manufacture of swords, knives,\r\naxes, and stone-chisels, both as malleable iron and as steel. Steel\r\nwas also known to the Chinese as far back as 2220 B.C., and they were\r\nacquainted with the methods of tempering it. The good quality of\r\nChinese steel caused it to be highly prized by Western nations. The\r\nearliest people to smelt iron are supposed to have been the Chalybes, a\r\nnation inhabiting the neighbourhood of the Black Sea; it is from them\r\nthat the ancient name for steel—_chalybs_—is derived, and also our word\r\n“chalybeate.”\r\n\r\n_Mercury_ has long been known, but there is no evidence that the\r\nancient Egyptians were aware of its existence, or it would probably\r\nhave been mentioned by Herodotus. It was familiar to Aristotle, and\r\nits mode of manufacture from cinnabar is described by Theophrastus\r\n(320 B.C.), who terms it “liquid silver.” Processes of amalgamation\r\nwere known to Pliny, who notes the readiness with which mercury\r\ndissolves gold. Pliny appears to distinguish the native metal found\r\nin Spain, which he terms _argentum vivum_ (quicksilver), from that\r\nobtained by sublimation or distillation from cinnabar, which he calls\r\n_hydrargyrum_, from which we get the chemical symbol for mercury Hg.\r\n\r\nA considerable number of metallic compounds were known to the ancients,\r\nand were employed by them as medicines and as pigments. The oxides\r\nof copper, known as _flos æris_, and _scoria æris_, obtained by\r\nheating copper bars to redness and exposing them to air, were used as\r\nescharotics. Verdigris, or _ærugo_, was made by the same methods as\r\nnow. Blue vitriol, or _chalcantum_, is described by Pliny, who says\r\nthat the blue transparent crystals are formed on strings suspended in\r\nits solution.\r\n\r\n_Chrysocolla_, malachite, or copper carbonate, was used as a green\r\npigment. The blue κύανος of the Greeks, or _cœruleum_ of the Romans,\r\nwas obtained by fritting together alkali, sand, and oxide of copper.\r\n_Botryitis_, _placitis_, _onychitis_, _ostracitis_, were varieties of\r\n_cadmia_ or oxide of zinc, obtained by calcining calamine, and were\r\nused in the treatment of ulcers, etc. _Molybdena_, which was the Latin\r\nname for litharge, was employed externally as an astringent and in the\r\nmanufacture of plaster. The lead plaster employed by Roman surgeons was\r\npractically identical in character and mode of preparation with that\r\nin use to-day. _Cerussa_, or white lead, was made as now by exposing\r\nsheets of lead to the fumes of vinegar. It was used in medicine,\r\nas a pigment, and in the preparation of cosmetics. _Cerussa usta_\r\nwas probably red lead. Its present name of _minium_ was originally\r\napplied to cinnabar, the red sulphide of mercury, which was frequently\r\nadulterated with red lead.\r\n\r\n_Cinnabar_, formerly obtained from Africa, and, by the Romans,\r\nfrom Spain, was also used externally in medicine, and was a highly\r\nprized pigment, whose value was known to the Chinese from very early\r\ntimes. The black sulphide of antimony, the _stimmi_ and _stibium_ of\r\nDioscorides and Pliny, was employed by women in Asia, Greece, and\r\nlatterly in Western Europe, and is still so used in the East, for\r\nblackening their eyelashes. Preparations of antimony were used in\r\nmedicine. _Realgar_, the scarlet sulphide of arsenic, the _sandarach_\r\nof Aristotle, and the _arrenichon_ of Theophrastus, was employed as\r\na pigment, and also in medicine, both internally and externally. The\r\nyellow sulphide of arsenic or _auri pigmentum_ (orpiment), was also\r\nused for the same purposes.\r\n\r\nA variety of yellow and red ochres, in addition to the pigments above\r\nmentioned, were used by painters, such as _rubrica_, an iron ochre\r\nof a dark red colour, and _sinopis_, or reddle, obtained from Egypt,\r\nLemnos, and the Balearic Isles. Oxides of manganese were used as brown\r\npigments. The white pigment, _paratonium_, was probably meerschaum.\r\n_Melinum_ was a variety of chalk found in Samos. The ancients were well\r\nacquainted with indigo and madder, and with the method of manufacturing\r\nlakes, which was employed by Grecian artists.\r\n\r\nThe famous _purpurissum_ was chalk or clay stained by immersion in a\r\nsolution of Tyrian purple. _Atramentum_ was lamp-black: ivory-black\r\nwas used by Apelles, and was known as _elephantinum_. The ink of the\r\nancients consisted of lamp-black suspended in a solution of gum or\r\nglue. The _atramentum indicum_, imported from the East, was identical\r\nwith China ink.\r\n\r\nThe ancients were well skilled in the art of dyeing, and even of\r\ncalico printing. The Tyrians produced their famous purple dye as far\r\nback as 1500 B.C. It was obtained from shell-fish, mainly species of\r\nMurex, inhabiting the Mediterranean. Tyrian purple has been shown to\r\nbe dibrom-indigo, and to have been produced by the action of air and\r\nlight upon the juices exuded from the shell-fish. The fine linen of the\r\nOld Testament was probably cotton, for the production of which Egypt\r\nwas long celebrated. That the Egyptians were acquainted with the use of\r\nmordants seems evident from the following passage from Pliny, quoted by\r\nThomson:—\r\n\r\n  There exists in Egypt a wonderful method of dyeing. The white\r\n  cloth is stained in various places, not with dye stuffs, but with\r\n  substances which have the property of absorbing colours; these\r\n  applications are not visible upon the cloth, but when they are\r\n  dipped into a hot caldron of the dye they are drawn out an instant\r\n  after dyed. The remarkable circumstance is that, though there be\r\n  only one dye in the vat, yet different colours appear upon the\r\n  cloth; nor can the colour be afterwards removed.\r\n\r\nThis passage accurately describes the process of madder dyeing on\r\ncotton, whereby a variety of fast colours—reds, browns and purples—can\r\nbe obtained from the same vat by the employment of different mordants,\r\nsuch as alumina, oxide of iron, or oxide of tin, etc.\r\n\r\nGlass has been known from very early times. Representations of\r\nglass-blowing were found on the monuments of Thebes and Beni Hassan,\r\nand large quantities of glass were exported to Greece and Rome from\r\nEgypt, mainly by Phœnicians. Aristophanes mentions it as _hyalos_, and\r\nspeaks of it as the beautiful transparent stone used for kindling fire.\r\nThe Egyptians made use of various metallic oxides in colouring glass.\r\nThe _hæmatinon_ of Pliny was a red glass coloured with cuprous oxide.\r\nCupric oxide was used to colour glass green; and ancient blue glass has\r\nbeen found to contain cobalt. The costly _vasa murrhina_ of the Romans,\r\nobtained from Egypt, probably consisted of fluorspar, identical with\r\nthe Blue John of the Derbyshire mines.\r\n\r\nStoneware has been made from time immemorial, and the Chinese have\r\nmanufactured porcelain from very remote periods. Bricks and tiles were\r\nmade by the Romans, and mortar and stucco were employed by the ancient\r\nEgyptians.\r\n\r\nSoap (_sapo_) is mentioned by Pliny, but its detergent properties were\r\napparently unknown to him. It appears to have been first made by the\r\nGauls, who prepared it from the ashes of the beech and the fat of\r\ngoats, and used it as a pomatum, as did the _jeunesse d’oreé_ of Rome.\r\nWood ashes, as well as natron, were, however, used by the ancients for\r\ntheir cleansing properties.\r\n\r\nStarch, acetic acid, sulphur, alumen or crude sulphate of alumina,\r\nbeeswax, camphor, bitumen, naphtha, asphalt, nitrum (carbonate of\r\nsoda), common salt, and lime, were all known to the Egyptians, and were\r\nused by them for many of the purposes in which they are employed to-day.\r\n\r\nIt will be evident from this brief survey that the ancients possessed a\r\nconsiderable acquaintance with many operations of technical chemistry;\r\nbut, although they must necessarily have accumulated a large amount\r\nof knowledge, very little has come down to us concerning the mode\r\nin which their processes were conducted, or as to the precautions\r\nthey employed to ensure uniform results. Their methods were probably\r\njealously guarded and handed down by successive members of the crafts\r\nas precious secrets. The experienced masters of these crafts must\r\nhave met with many strange and perplexing phenomena in the course of\r\ntheir operations, and a spirit of inquiry must thereby at times have\r\nbeen awakened. But, under the conditions in which their industries\r\nwere prosecuted, the scientific spirit was not free to develop, for\r\nscience depends essentially upon free intercommunication of facts and\r\nthe spread of knowledge of natural phenomena. Moreover, the great\r\nintellects of antiquity, for the most part, had little sympathy with\r\nthe operations of artisans, who, at least among the Greeks and Romans,\r\nwere, for the most part, slaves. Philosophers taught that industrial\r\nwork tended to lower the standard of thought. The priests, in most\r\nages, have looked more or less askance at attempts, on the part of the\r\nlaity, to inquire too closely into the causes of natural phenomena. The\r\ninvestigation of nature in early times was impossible for religious\r\nreasons. There was an outcry in Athens when the thunderbolts of Zeus\r\nwere ascribed to the collision of clouds. Anaxagoras, Diogenes of\r\nApollonia, Plato, Aristotle, Diagoras, and Protagoras were charged by\r\nthe priests with blasphemy and driven into exile. Prodikos, who deified\r\nthe natural forces, as did Empedokles the primal elements, was executed\r\nfor impiety. Sacerdotalism in Athens had no more sympathy with science\r\nthan had the Holy Congregation in Italy when it banned the writings of\r\nCopernicus, Kepler, and Galileo, and sent Giordano Bruno to the stake.\r\nThe educated Greeks had no interest in observing or in explaining the\r\nphenomena of technical processes. However prone they might be to\r\nspeculation, they had no inclination to experiment or to engage in the\r\npatient accumulation of the knowledge of physical facts. “You Greeks,”\r\nsays Plato in one of his Dialogues, “are ever children, having no\r\nknowledge of antiquity, nor antiquity of knowledge!” The influence of\r\na spurious Aristotelianism, which lasted through many centuries and\r\neven beyond the time of Boyle, was wholly opposed to the true methods\r\nof science, and it was only when philosophy had shaken itself free from\r\nscholasticism that chemistry, as a science, was able to develop.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nTHE CHEMICAL PHILOSOPHY OF THE ANCIENTS\r\n\r\n\r\nSpeculations as to the origin and nature of matter, and as to the\r\nconditions and forces which affect it, are to be found, more or less\r\nimperfectly developed, in the oldest systems of philosophy of which\r\nwe have any record. These speculations are not based, in any real\r\nsense, upon the systematic observation of natural phenomena. Still,\r\nas they appealed to human reason, they must be held to be founded\r\nupon experience, or at least not to be consciously inconsistent with\r\nit: All the oldest cosmogonies regarded water as the fundamental\r\nprinciple of things: from Okeanos sprang the gods—themselves deified\r\npersonifications of the “elements” or principles of which the world was\r\nmade.\r\n\r\nIn the course of time this doctrine of the origin and essential nature\r\nof matter came to be more particularly associated with the name of\r\nThales of Miletus, who lived six centuries before our era, and who,\r\naccording to Tertullian, is to be regarded as the first of the race\r\nof the natural philosophers—that is, the first of those who made it\r\ntheir business to inquire after natural causes and phenomena. Thales\r\nis known to have passed some years of his life in Egypt, and to have\r\nbeen instructed in science by the priests of Thebes and Memphis; and it\r\nis therefore possible that he may have been influenced by the Egyptian\r\nteaching in the formulation of his cosmological theories.\r\n\r\nIt is significant of the tenacity with which the mind clings to\r\ndogma and reveres authority that the teaching of Thales should have\r\nsurvived through the space of twenty-four centuries. It can be shown\r\nto have affected the course of chemical inquiry down to the close of\r\nthe eighteenth century. It influenced the experimental labours of\r\nphilosophers so diverse in character as Van Helmont, Boyle, Boerhaave,\r\nPriestley, and Lavoisier—all of whom made attempts to prove or disprove\r\nits adequacy. Van Helmont, indeed, was one of the most strenuous\r\nsupporters of the doctrine of Thales, and sought to establish it by\r\nobservations which, in the absence of all knowledge of the true nature\r\nof air and water, seemed at the time irrefutable. Perhaps the one most\r\nfrequently cited is his observation on the growth of a plant which\r\napparently had no other form of sustenance than water. He describes how\r\nhe planted a willow weighing 5 lbs. in 200 lbs. of earth previously\r\ndried in an oven. The plant was regularly watered, when at the end of\r\nfive years it was found to weigh 169 lbs. 3 oz., whereas the earth,\r\nafter redrying, had lost only 2 oz. in weight. Hence, 164 lbs. of\r\nwoody matter, leaves, roots, etc., had been produced seemingly from\r\nwater alone. More than a century had to elapse before any clue to the\r\ntrue interpretation of Van Helmont’s experiment was gained. It was\r\nfirst furnished by the observations of Ingenhousz and Priestley.\r\n\r\nAlthough the idea of a primal “element” or common principle is to be\r\nfound in every old-world philosophical system, the ancient philosophers\r\nwere by no means in agreement as to its character. Anaximenes, who\r\nlived _circa_ 500 B.C., taught that it was air, Herakleitos of Ephesus\r\nthat it was fire, and Pherekides that it was earth. The supposition\r\nthat a single primordial principle could be made to account for all\r\nforms of matter and all the phenomena and manifestations of the\r\nmaterial world had its difficulties. Attempts to group qualities as\r\nprinciples, and to construct from these principles the universe, were\r\nindeed made even prior to the age of Thales. It was a comparatively\r\nsimple evolutionary step to regard these principles or “elements” as\r\nmutually convertible. Anaximenes’ theory of the formation of rain was\r\nan implicit admission of such convertibility. This philosopher taught\r\nthat rain came by the condensation of clouds, which in their turn\r\nwere formed by the condensation of air. Everything comes from air and\r\neverything returns to air. That water might be converted by fire into\r\nair was surmised from the earliest times. Such a supposition naturally\r\nsprung from the circumstance that water was everywhere recognised to\r\ndisappear or to pass into the air under the influence of fire or solar\r\nheat. The supposition had grown into a fixed belief in the Middle Ages.\r\nEven Priestley, as late as the end of the eighteenth century, imagined\r\nfor a time that he had obtained proof of such a mutual conversion.\r\nThe possibility of the transmutation of water into earth was a belief\r\ncurrent through twenty centuries, and was only definitely and finally\r\ndisproved by Lavoisier in 1770. The conception of fire as the primal\r\nprinciple has its germ in the fire- or sun-worship of the Chaldeans,\r\nScythians, Persians, Parsees, and Hindus, and it is not difficult to\r\ntrace, therefore, how heat came to be regarded either as antecedent\r\nto, or as associated with, the other primal principles. Empedokles,\r\napparently, was the first whose name has come down to us to reintroduce\r\nthe definite conception of four primal elements—fire, air, water,\r\nand earth. These he regarded as distinct, and incapable of being\r\ntransmuted, but as forming all varieties of matter by intermixture\r\nin various proportions. These principles he deified, Zeus being the\r\npersonification of the element of fire, Here of air, Nestis of water,\r\nand Aidoneous of earth.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of the four elements was also adopted by Plato and\r\namplified by Aristotle, with whose name indeed it is commonly\r\nassociated. Aristotle, the greatest scientific thinker among the\r\nGreeks, exercised an authority almost supreme in Europe during\r\nnearly twenty centuries. His influence is to be traced throughout\r\nthe literature of chemistry long after the time of Boyle. It may be\r\ndetected even now. Probably few who write chemical memoirs to-day,\r\nand who follow the time-honoured practice of prefacing their own\r\ncontributions to knowledge by a statement of what is already known\r\non the subject, are aware that in so doing they are obeying the\r\ninjunctions of Aristotle. His theory of the nature of matter is\r\ncontained in his treatise on _Generation and Destruction_. It mainly\r\ndiffered from that of Empedokles in regarding the four “elements” as\r\nmutually convertible. Each “element” or principle was regarded as being\r\npossessed of two qualities, one of which was shared by another element\r\nor principle.\r\n\r\nThus: Fire is hot and dry; air is hot and wet; water is cold and wet;\r\nearth is cold and dry.\r\n\r\nIn each primal “element” one quality prevails. Fire is more hot than\r\ndry; air is more wet than hot; water is more cold than wet; earth is\r\nmore dry than cold. The relative proportion and mutual working of\r\nthese qualities determined the specific character of the “element.”\r\nThus, if the dryness of fire is overcome by the moisture of water,\r\nair is produced; if the heat of air is overcome by the coldness of\r\nearth, water is formed; if the moisture of water is overcome by the\r\ndryness of fire, earth results. Ancient chemical literature contains\r\nmany illustrations or diagrams symbolising the convertibility or mutual\r\nrelations of the four “elements.”\r\n\r\nIt has been frequently stated that the influence of the Peripatetic\r\nphilosophy has been inimical to the development of science. But, in\r\nreality, the founder of that school, a descendant of Esculapius, and\r\nundoubtedly one of the greatest and most enlightened thinkers of\r\nantiquity, was an ideal man of science. This is abundantly evident\r\nfrom such of his works as can be proved to be genuine. Much of what\r\nis called Aristotelianism is entirely foreign to the spirit of the\r\nteaching of Aristotle. The Aristotelians of the Middle Ages were\r\nmainly dialecticians, and almost wholly concerned with the formulæ of\r\nsyllogistic inference, and without real sympathy with, or knowledge\r\nof, his system. Much, too, that was attributed to him, and which was\r\nvenerated accordingly, is undoubtedly spurious. The fame of the Master\r\nhas consequently suffered at the hands of those who, calling themselves\r\nPeripatetics, were in no proper sense followers of his method or\r\ninterpreters of his dogma. Aristotle affirmed that natural science\r\ncan only be founded upon a knowledge of facts, and facts can only be\r\nascertained through observation and experiment. He illustrates this\r\nparticularly by a reference to astronomy, “which,” he says, “is based\r\non the observation of astronomical phenomena, and it is the case with\r\nevery branch of science or art.” It is erroneous and unjust, therefore,\r\nto suppose that Aristotle’s philosophy, as he taught it, is opposed to\r\nthe true methods of science.\r\n\r\nA knowledge of Aristotle’s works was transferred by Byzantine writers\r\nto Egypt; and, when that land was overrun by the Arabs in the seventh\r\ncentury, they adopted his system, spreading it abroad wherever their\r\nconquests extended. In the eighth century they carried it into Spain,\r\nwhere it flourished throughout their occupation of that country.\r\nFrom the ninth to the eleventh century the greater part of Europe\r\nwas in a state of barbarism. The Moslem caliphate in Spain, under\r\nthe beneficent rule of Jusuf and Jaküb, alone preserved science from\r\nextinction. Cordova, Seville, Grenada, and Toledo were the chief seats\r\nof learning in Western Europe; and it was mainly through “the perfect\r\nand most glorious physicist,” the Moslem Ibn-Roshd—better known as\r\nAverroes—(1126–1198), that Christian scholiasts like Roger Bacon\r\nacquired their knowledge of the philosophical system of Aristotle,\r\nand mainly through the Moslems Geber and Avicenna that they gained\r\nacquaintance with the science of the East.\r\n\r\nThe conception that matter is made up of particles or _atoms_, and\r\nthat these particles are in a state of ceaseless motion, is to be met\r\nwith in Hindu and Phœnician philosophy. It was taught by Anaxagoras,\r\nLeukippos, and Demokritos to the Greeks, and by Lucretius to the\r\nRomans. Leukippos and Demokritos explained the creation of the world as\r\ndue solely to physical agencies without the intervention of a creative\r\nintelligence. According to their theories, the atoms are variable, not\r\nonly in size, but in weight. The smallest atoms are also the lightest.\r\nAtoms are impenetrable; no two atoms can simultaneously occupy the same\r\nplace. The collision of the atoms gives them an oscillatory movement,\r\nwhich is communicated to adjacent atoms, and these, in their turn,\r\ntransmit it to the most distant ones. Anaxagoras taught that every\r\natom is a world in miniature, and that the living body is a congeries\r\nof atoms derived from the aliments which sustain it. Plants are living\r\nthings, endowed like animals with respiratory functions, and, like\r\nthem, atomically constituted. This philosopher was so far in advance\r\nof his age that his countrymen accused him of sacrilege, and he only\r\nescaped death by flight. Further, the assumption that these atoms\r\nexert mutual attractions and repulsions is probably as old as the\r\nfundamental conception itself. At least, so far as can be traced, the\r\nconceptions of atoms and atomic motion are indissolubly connected. This\r\nis not the place to develop the subsequent history of the doctrine of\r\nthe atom, nor need we now concern ourselves with the old metaphysical\r\nquibble of its divisibility or indivisibility. It may be, as Lucretius\r\nsaid, that the original atom is very far down. It may be that the\r\nphysical atom is something which _is_ not divided, not something that\r\n_cannot_ be divided. This theory, dimly perceived in the mists of\r\nantiquity, has grown and strengthened with the ages, and in its modern\r\napplication to the facts of chemistry has acquired a precision and\r\nharmony unimagined even by the poets and thinkers of old. We shall\r\nsee later how the whole course of the science has been controlled,\r\nillumined, and vivified by it. It is not too much to say that the\r\nchemistry of to-day is one vast elaboration of this primeval doctrine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nALCHEMY\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the intellectual tendencies of the Hellenic mind were hardly\r\ncalculated to favour the development of chemistry as a science, the\r\nspeculations of the Greeks concerning the essential nature of matter\r\nand the mutual convertibility of the “elements” led incidentally to an\r\nextension of the art of operative chemistry. This extension resulted\r\nfrom attempts to realise what was the logical outcome of the teaching\r\nof their philosophers—viz., the possibility of the transmutation of\r\nmetals. The idea of transmutation has its germ in the oldest systems\r\nof philosophy. It was a plausible doctrine, not wholly unsupported by\r\nthe phenomena of the organic world; and it naturally commended itself\r\nto men who were only too prone to adopt what their cupidity and love of\r\nwealth predisposed them to believe.\r\n\r\nIt has been assumed that alchemy at no time in its history had the\r\nslightest claim to a philosophical foundation, but that its professors\r\nand adepts, even at the outset, consciously traded on the credulity and\r\ngreed of their dupes. Much may be urged against such a partial view.\r\nThe supposition is not consistent with history or with evolutional\r\ntendencies. It may be, as Davy once said, that “analogy is the fruitful\r\nparent of error;” but the idea that metals could be modified—could even\r\nbe changed one into the other—seemed to find support in innumerable\r\nchemical phenomena well known but imperfectly understood. The fact that\r\nalchemy—that is the profession of making gold from other metals—came to\r\nbe practised by rogues is no proof that it never had, and never could\r\nhave had, a philosophical basis.\r\n\r\nThe changes which substances experience under the influence of fire,\r\nair, and water, or as the result of their action on each other, are\r\nfrequently so profound that even the most superficial of the early\r\nobservers of chemical processes could not fail to be impressed by\r\nthem. Many of these changes are, in fact, far more striking as regards\r\nalteration in outward characters—such as colour, lustre, density,\r\netc.—than are the differences between individual metals; say, between\r\nlead and tin, or between tin and silver, or between brass and gold.\r\nThat copper ores, by appropriate treatment with other ores, or that\r\ncopper itself by the addition of another metal, could be made to\r\nfurnish a metallic-looking substance having certain of the attributes\r\nof gold was known to the earliest workers in metals. What is thought\r\nto be the oldest chemical treatise in existence is a papyrus in the\r\npossession of the University of Leyden. It consists of a number of\r\nreceipts for the working of metals and alloys, and describes methods\r\nof imitating and falsifying the noble metals. It explains how, by\r\nmeans of arsenic, a white colour may be given to certain metals, and\r\nhow, by the addition of cadmia, copper acquires the colour of gold.\r\nThe same papyrus describes a method of blackening metals by the use of\r\npreparations of sulphur. The limited knowledge of chemical phenomena\r\nand of chemical processes which these early workers necessarily\r\npossessed, so far from precluding a belief in the possibility of\r\ntransmutation, actually encouraged it. As nothing was known of the\r\ntrue nature of brass or of its exact relation to copper, it was not\r\nunreasonable to suppose that, if this substance could be made to\r\nacquire _some_ of the attributes of gold by a process essentially\r\nchemical, processes of a like nature might cause it to acquire, if\r\nnot _all_, at least so many of them as to enable it to pass for gold\r\nof greater or less fineness. To them, as to us, perfection was, in\r\ntechnical practice, a question of degree: the very language of the\r\nmetallurgists of old was in this respect nowise different from that of\r\nthe metallurgists of to-day.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to suppose that these early attempts were\r\ndeliberately and consciously fraudulent, like those of coiners who\r\nknowingly seek to make an alloy of lead and tin simulate silver. The\r\nfirst alchemists sought in good faith to make something which should\r\nbe of the true nature and essence of gold as they conceived it to be.\r\nIn fact, the idea of transmutation had a rational foundation in a\r\ntheory of the intrinsic nature of metals which may be looked upon as a\r\ndevelopment of the ancient beliefs concerning the essential nature of\r\nall forms of matter.\r\n\r\nJust as the Aristotelian “elements” were qualities which, according to\r\ntheir degree, determined the nature of substances, so, in like manner,\r\nthe specific character of a metal depended upon the relative proportion\r\nof its “sulphur” and “mercury.” These terms had no certain reference\r\nto what we to-day understand by sulphur and mercury. They denoted\r\nsimply qualities. The essence or “element” of mercury conferred lustre,\r\nmalleability, ductility, and fusibility, or, speaking generally,\r\nthe properties which we connote as metallic; while to the essence\r\nor “element” of sulphur was to be attributed the combustibility—or,\r\nspeaking generally, the alterability—of the metal by fire. By modifying\r\nthe relative proportion of these constituent elements, or by purifying\r\nthem from extraneous substances by the operations of chemistry, it\r\nwas conceived that the several metals could be changed one into the\r\nother. To effect this purification it was necessary to add various\r\npreparations known as “medicines,” chief among which was the _Great\r\nElixir_, or _Magisterium_, or the _Philosopher’s Stone_, by which the\r\nfinal transformation into the noblest of the metals could alone be\r\nachieved.\r\n\r\nThe Arabic words _kímyâ_ and _iksír_ were originally synonymous and\r\neach was used to denote the agent by which the baser metals could\r\nbe transmuted into silver and gold. Ultimately the former term\r\nbecame restricted to indicate the art of transmutation (alchemy),\r\nwhereas _iksír_, or _al-iksír_, continued to denote the medium by\r\nwhich the transmutation was effected. By later writers the term\r\nwas used to indicate a liquid preparation—the _quintessence of the\r\nphilosophers_—whence we have the word _elixir_, which always means a\r\nliquid.\r\n\r\nThe alchemistic theory of the compound nature and mutual relations of\r\nthe metals is usually ascribed to Geber; but, although he adopted it,\r\nhe distinctly states that it did not originate with him, but that he\r\nfound it in the writings of his predecessors.\r\n\r\nThe idea of the _stone_, the _philosophical powder_, the _grand\r\nmagisterium_, the _elixir_, the _tincture_, the _quintessence_—by\r\nall of which terms the transmuting medium is known in the literature\r\nof alchemy—is probably connected with another conception respecting\r\nthe origin of metals which can be traced to very early times and was\r\nprevalent throughout the Middle Ages. It was supposed of old that\r\nmetals were _generated_ within the earth, as animals and plants were\r\ngenerated on its surface, and that something akin to a seed, or semen,\r\nwas needed to initiate their formation. The great problem of alchemy\r\nwas to discover this fecundating substance, as upon it depended the\r\ngenesis of the perfect metal. This idea of the conception of metals\r\nruns through the literature of alchemy. It explains many allusions and\r\nmuch of the terminology of its writers. For example, the furnace in\r\nwhich the alchemist makes his projection is constantly spoken of as the\r\n_philosophical egg_.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to say with certainty when and where the art of\r\nalchemy originated. There is no evidence that it has the antiquity\r\nwhich certain of its adepts claimed for it. Oleus Borrichius referred\r\nit to the time of Tubal-cain. The earliest writers on alchemy were\r\nprobably Byzantine ecclesiastics, some of whom professed to ascribe\r\nthe art to Egypt, and eventually to the mythological deity Hermes,\r\nwhose association with chemistry in such terms as “the hermetic art,”\r\n“hermetically sealed,” etc., is thus explained.\r\n\r\nThis much is established—that at some period prior to the tenth century\r\nthere arose a special class of operative chemists, for the most\r\npart more learned in the knowledge of chemical phenomena in general,\r\nand more skilled in chemical manipulation, than the craftsmen and\r\nartisans engaged in the manufacture of technical products. They devoted\r\nthemselves to searching for methods whereby the common and baser metals\r\nmight be converted into silver and gold. The first known definition\r\nof chemistry relates to the aim and operations of this special class.\r\nIt occurs in the lexicon of Suidas, a Greek writer of the eleventh\r\ncentury, who defines chemistry, χημíα as the preparation of silver\r\nand gold. Attempts at the artificial preparation of the noble metals\r\nprobably originated with the Arabians, who followed the Egyptians and\r\nthe Greeks in the cultivation of chemical pursuits.\r\n\r\nNeither Hesiod nor Homer makes mention of the art of producing gold\r\nfrom any other metal, or speaks of the universal medicine. Nor are\r\nthey referred to by Aristotle or by his pupil Theophrastus. Pliny\r\nnowhere speaks of the philosopher’s stone, although he tells the\r\nstory of Caligula, who, tempted by his avarice, sought to make gold\r\nfrom orpiment (_auripigmentum_) by distillation. “The result was that\r\nhe did indeed obtain both, and of the finest kind; but in so small\r\nquantity, and with so much labour and apparatus, that, the profit not\r\ncountervailing the expense, he desisted.”\r\n\r\nAccording to Boerhaave, the first author who mentions _al-chemia_\r\nis Julius Firmicus Maternus, who lived under Constantine the Great,\r\nand who, in his _Mathesis_, c. 15, speaking of the influences of the\r\nheavenly bodies, affirms “that, if the moon be in the house of Saturn\r\nwhen a child is born, he shall be skilled in alchemy.”\r\n\r\nThe first writer who mentions the possibility of transmuting metals\r\nwould appear to be a Greek divine called Æneas Garæus, who lived\r\ntowards the close of the fifth century, and who wrote a commentary on\r\nTheophrastus. He was followed by Anastatius the Sinaite, Syncellus,\r\nStephanus, Olimpiodorus; and, says Boerhaave, “a crowd of no less\r\nthan fifty more, all Greeks, and most or all of them monks.” “The art\r\nseemed now confined to the Greeks, and among them few wrote but the\r\nreligious, who from their great laziness and solitary way of life were\r\nled into vain, enthusiastical speculations, to the great disservice and\r\nadulteration of the art.... They all wrote in the natural style of the\r\nSchoolmen, full of jargon, grimace, and obscurity.”\r\n\r\nExperimental alchemy, as distinguished from industrial chemistry,\r\nmay, as already stated, be said to have originated with the\r\nArabians. At first, alchemy was regarded as a branch of the art of\r\nhealing, and its professors were invariably physicians who occupied\r\nthemselves with the preparation of chemical medicines. In fact, in\r\nthe beginning its true aim was regarded as that which Paracelsus and\r\nthe school of iatro-chemists subsequently defined it to be. Under\r\nthe rule of the Caliphs the study of chemistry made considerable\r\nprogress, and its literature was greatly augmented. The most notable\r\nname in the history of chemistry during the eighth century was\r\n=Abu-Moussah-Dschabir-Al-Sufi=—otherwise =Geber=—(born 702, died 765),\r\nwho is stated to have been either a native of Mesopotamia, or a Greek\r\nand a Christian, who afterwards embraced Mahometanism, went to Asia,\r\nand acquired a knowledge of Arabic. According to Leo Africanus, a Greek\r\nwho wrote of the antiquity of the Arabs, Geber’s book was originally\r\nwritten in Greek and translated thence into Arabic, and he was not\r\nknown by the name Geber, which signifies a _great man_ or a _prince_,\r\ntill after this version. Latin translations of what purported to be his\r\nworks were first published in the early part of the sixteenth century,\r\nand an English rendering appeared in 1678. According to this it would\r\nseem that Geber regarded all the metals as compounds of “sulphur” and\r\n“mercury,” the differences between them depending upon the relative\r\nproportion and degree of purity of these constituents. He is said to\r\nhave distinguished them by the astrological names of the planets: thus\r\ngold became _Sol_, silver _Luna_, copper _Venus_, iron _Mars_, tin\r\n_Jupiter_, and lead _Saturn_. That an occult connection of the metals\r\nwith the stars existed was part of the creed of alchemy, and the\r\ninfluence of that belief is still traceable in chemical, and especially\r\nin pharmaceutical, literature; as, for example, in such terms as _Lunar\r\ncaustic_, _Martian preparations_, _Saturnine solutions_, _etc._\r\n\r\nIt has been held that the idea of a universal medicine had its origin\r\nwith Geber. But this may be due to a misreading of his words, which\r\nin reality may have reference to the transmutation of metals. He\r\ntells of a medicine which cures all lepers. But this may be nothing\r\nbut allegory. By _man_ is probably meant gold, and by _lepers_ the\r\nother metals; and the medicine is the universal solvent or agent\r\nwhich transmutes. Alchemistic literature is full of allegories of\r\nthis character. Berthelot has shown that in reality there were two\r\nGebers—one who is generally considered to be of Arab origin, and\r\nanother whose identity is not established, but who was probably a\r\nWestern European who appears to have lived about the year 1300.[1]\r\n\r\n    [1] There is very little doubt that the work of “Phileletha,”\r\n        which professed to be taken from an “Uhralten MS.”\r\n        preserved in the Vatican Library, entitled _Geberi des\r\n        Königes der Araber_, and published by Hieron. Philipp.\r\n        Nitschel, Frankfurth and Leipzig, in 1710, is spurious.\r\n\r\nOther notable names in the history of Arabian alchemy are =Rhazes=, or\r\n=Abû Bakr Mohammed ibn Zakaráyá el-Rázi=, who lived _circa_ 925, and\r\n=Avicenna=, or in Arabic =Abû Ali el-Hosein ibn-Abdallah ibn-Sina=,\r\nborn 980, died 1037. The former, a Persian, practised medicine at\r\nBaghdad as a follower of Galen and Hippocrates. The latter, one of\r\nthe most eminent of Moslem physicians and a voluminous writer, was a\r\nnative of Bokhara. He is mainly known in the history of science by\r\nhis _Canon of Medicine_, in which he describes the composition and\r\npreparation of remedies. He wrote at least one treatise on alchemy, but\r\nothers attributed to him are probably apocryphal. Of his _Philosophia\r\nOrientalis_, mentioned by Roger Bacon and Averroes, no trace remains.\r\n\r\nAlthough it is reasonably certain that the alchemists of the time\r\nof Geber and of his successors had a considerable acquaintance with\r\nmanipulative chemistry, there were so many impudent literary forgeries\r\nduring the alchemical period that the precise extent of the knowledge\r\npossessed by the early chemists must always remain uncertain.\r\n\r\nA number of the ordinary chemical processes, such as distillation,\r\nsublimation, calcination, filtration, appear to have been known to,\r\nand to have been commonly practised by, the Arabian chemists; and many\r\nsaline substances, such as carbonate of soda, pearlash, sal-ammoniac,\r\nalum, copperas, borax, silver nitrate, cinnabar, and corrosive\r\nsublimate, were prepared by them. They seem to have known of certain\r\nof the mineral acids, and were familiar with the solvent properties of\r\n_aqua regia_.\r\n\r\nAn examination of the literature of alchemy serves to show how its\r\nprinciples and tenets developed. The philosopher’s stone is first heard\r\nof in the twelfth century. Prior to that period the greater number of\r\nthe Greek and Arabian writers contented themselves with affirming the\r\nfact of transmutation, without indicating how it might be accomplished.\r\nThe universal medicine and the elixir of life were the products of a\r\nlater age; no mention of them is known before the thirteenth century.\r\n\r\nAlchemy flourished vigorously during the Middle Ages, and lingered\r\non even until the early part of the nineteenth century. Its history\r\nis simply a long chapter in the history of human credulity. For the\r\nmost part it is a record of self-deception, imposture, and fraud. It\r\nproduced an abundant literature, mainly the work of ecclesiastics,\r\nbetween the seventh and fourteenth centuries; but as regards the\r\nartificial preparation of the noble metals or the discovery of the\r\nuniversal medicine or the elixir of life it was barren of result.\r\n\r\nAlthough no clear line of demarcation is possible, it may be\r\nconvenient, in dealing with the personal history of alchemy, to divide\r\nit into the two periods before and after Paracelsus, since under his\r\ninspiration and example alchemy underwent a great development as\r\nregards its professed objects. These eventually became so extravagant\r\nthat, wide as are the limits of human credulity, its pretensions\r\ngradually brought it into disrepute, and it fell by the weight of its\r\nown absurdities.\r\n\r\nOne of the most reputable of the early Western alchemists was =Albert\r\nGroot=, or =Albertus Magnus=, born at Lauingen in 1193. He was a\r\nDominican monk, who became Bishop of Regensburg, but, resigning his\r\nbishopric, retired to a convent at Cologne, where he devoted himself to\r\nscience until his death in 1282. He is credited with having written a\r\nnumber of chemical tracts, for the most part in clear and intelligible\r\nlanguage, which is more than can be said of the greater portion of\r\nalchemistical literature. He gives an account of the origin and main\r\nproperties of the chemical substances known in his time, and describes\r\nthe apparatus and processes used by chemists, such as the water-bath,\r\nalembics, aludels, and cupels. He speaks of cream of tartar, alum and\r\ncaustic alkali, red lead, liver of sulphur and arsenic, green vitriol\r\nand iron pyrites.\r\n\r\nContemporaneously with him was =Roger Bacon=, _Doctor Mirabilis_,\r\none of the most erudite men of his age, who was born near Ilchester\r\nin Somerset in 1214, and, after studying at Oxford, became a friar,\r\noccupied himself in philosophical pursuits, and wrote numerous tracts\r\non alchemy. He describes what was probably gunpowder, but there is\r\nno certain proof that he invented it. In his _De Secretis Artis et\r\nNaturæ_, written before 1249, he gives instructions for refining\r\nsaltpetre, and in an anagram which Colonel Hime, in his _Gunpowder and\r\nAmmunition_, has interpreted, he states that a mixture “which will\r\nproduce a thundering noise and a bright flash” may be made by taking “7\r\nparts of saltpetre, 5 of young hazel wood, and 5 of sulphur.” He died\r\nin 1285.\r\n\r\n=Raymund Lully=, a friend and scholar of Bacon, was born in Majorca\r\nin 1225 (others say 1235), and was buried there in 1315. A member of\r\nthe Order of Minorites, he had a great reputation as an alchemist; and\r\na number of books on alchemy and chemical processes are ascribed to\r\nhim. He described modes of obtaining nitric acid and aqua regia, and\r\nstudied their action upon metals. He obtained alcohol by distillation,\r\nand knew how to dehydrate it by the aid of carbonate of potash, which\r\nhe obtained by calcining cream of tartar. He prepared various tinctures\r\nand essential oils, and a number of metallic compounds, such as red\r\nand white precipitate. To him is usually ascribed the first idea of a\r\nuniversal medicine.\r\n\r\nThere is some difficulty in believing that all that is ascribed\r\nto Lully was actually the work of his age, for it would appear to\r\nhave been a common practice with the disciples and followers of a\r\nnotable scholar to usher in their performances under their master’s\r\nname—a practice not unknown in later days. “So full are they of\r\nthe experiments and observations which occur in our later writers\r\nthat either the books must be suppositious, or the ancient chemists\r\nmust have been acquainted with a world of things which pass for the\r\ndiscoveries of modern practice” (Boerhaave). The story is that Lully\r\nplunged into the study of chemistry from the desire to cure a maiden of\r\na cancered breast, and that he was stoned to death in Africa, whither\r\nhe had journeyed as a missionary. It has been further alleged that\r\nat one period of his life he made gold in the Tower of London by the\r\nKing’s order, and that he offered Edward III. a supply of six millions\r\nto make war against the infidels. As Boerhaave drily remarks, “the\r\nhistory of this eminent adept is very much imbroiled.”\r\n\r\n=Arnoldus Villanovanus=, or =Arnaud de Villeneuve=, a Frenchman, is\r\nsaid to have been born in 1240, and to have practised medicine in\r\nBarcelona, where he incurred the enmity of the Church by reason of his\r\nheretical opinions, and was obliged to leave Spain. He led a wandering\r\nlife, eventually settling in Sicily, under the protection of Frederick\r\nII., and acquired a great reputation as a physician. Summoned thence by\r\nClement V., who lay sick at Avignon, he lost his life by shipwreck in\r\n1313.\r\n\r\n=Johannes de Rupecissa=, or =Jean de Raquetaillade=, a Franciscan friar\r\nwho lived from about the middle to the end of the fourteenth century,\r\nwrote a number of treatises on alchemy, and described methods of making\r\ncalomel and corrosive sublimate. He was accused of the practice of\r\nmagic, and, by order of Innocent VI., was thrown into prison, where he\r\ndied. He was buried at Villefranche.\r\n\r\n=George Ripley=, an Englishman, Canon of Bridlington, practised alchemy\r\nduring the second half of the fifteenth century. He spent some time\r\nin Italy in the service of Innocent VIII. On his return to England he\r\nbecame a Carmelite, and died in 1490. Like Bacon, he was charged with\r\nmagic. According to Mundanus, he followed alchemy with such success\r\nthat he was able to advance to the knights of St. John of Jerusalem\r\nlarge amounts of gold for the defence of the Isle of Rhodes against the\r\nTurks.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important names in connection with the history of\r\nalchemy is that of =Basil Valentine=. Of his personal history nothing\r\nis known. He was supposed to be a Benedictine monk who lived in Saxony\r\nduring the latter half of the fifteenth century; but there are grounds\r\nfor the belief that the numerous writings attributed to him are in\r\nreality the work of various hands. The attempt made by Maximilian I. to\r\ndiscover the identity of the author was unavailing, nor have subsequent\r\ninquiries had any better result. The collection of books bearing his\r\nname, first published in the beginning of the seventeenth century,\r\nreveals quite a remarkable number of chemical facts up to that time not\r\ngenerally known. The most important of these relate to antimony and its\r\npreparations, such as butter of antimony, powder of algaroth, oxide\r\nof antimony, etc. He seems to have known of arsenic, zinc, bismuth,\r\nand manganese. He described a number of mercurial preparations, and\r\nmany of the salts of lead were known to him. He mentions fulminating\r\ngold, and was aware that iron could be coated with copper by immersion\r\nin a solution of blue vitriol. He knew of green vitriol and the\r\ndouble chloride of iron and ammonium, and gave the modes of making\r\na considerable number of other metallic salts, such as the _sal\r\narmoniacum_, which we now know as sal ammoniac. He also appears to have\r\nprepared ether and the chloride and nitrate of ethyl.\r\n\r\nThere is reason to believe, as stated already, that many of the\r\npublished works ascribed to these learned men are the work of obscure\r\nindividuals who traded on their fame. What may with certainty be\r\ncredited to them serves to show that their theoretical opinions had\r\nmuch in common. They all regarded the transmutation of metals and\r\nthe existence of the philosopher’s stone as facts which could not be\r\ncontroverted. They followed Geber in assuming that all the metals were\r\nessentially compound in their nature, and consisted of the essence or\r\n“element” of mercury, united with different proportions of the essence\r\nor “element” of sulphur.\r\n\r\nThe alchemists were the professional chemists of their time, and many\r\nof them were practising physicians. Indeed, professional chemistry may\r\nbe said to have originated out of the practice of physic. As the number\r\nof chemical products increased and their value in therapeutics became\r\nmore and more appreciated, there arose another school of alchemists,\r\nwhose energies were devoted, not to the transmutation of metals—which,\r\nhowever plausible as a belief, seemed hopeless of achievement—but to\r\nthe more immediate practical benefits which it was recognised must\r\nfollow from the closer association of chemistry and medicine. This\r\nschool came to be known as the iatro-chemists. As their doctrines\r\nexercised a great influence upon the development of chemistry, it\r\nwill be desirable to treat of them and their professors in a special\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nTHE PHILOSOPHER’S STONE\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the fourteenth, fifteenth, and sixteenth centuries the cult of\r\nalchemy attained to the dignity of a religion. Belief in transmutation\r\nand in the virtues and powers of the philosopher’s stone, in the\r\nuniversal medicine, the alkahest, and the elixir of life, formed its\r\narticles of faith. The position it acquired was due to some extent to\r\nthe attitude towards it of the Romish Church. Many reputable bishops\r\nand fathers were professed alchemists; and chemical laboratories, as\r\nin the Egyptian temples, were to be found in monasteries throughout\r\nChristendom. Pope John XXII., who had a laboratory in his palace\r\nat Avignon, is the reputed author of a work, _Ars Transmutatoria_,\r\npublished in 1557. But to a still larger extent it was due to the fact\r\nthat alchemy appealed to some of the strongest of human motives—the\r\nwish for health, the fear of death, and the love of wealth. It was a\r\ncunningly devised system, which exploited the foibles and frailties of\r\nhuman nature. The policy of the Church, however, it should be said, was\r\nnot consistently and uniformly favourable to alchemy. Its practices\r\noccasionally came under the papal ban, although at times, to suit the\r\nexigencies of Christian princes, the interdict was removed. Theosophy\r\nand mysticism were first imported into alchemy, not by Arabs, but by\r\nChristian workers. The intimate association of religion with alchemy\r\nduring the Middle Ages is obvious in the writings of Lully, Albertus\r\nMagnus, Arnaud de Villeneuve, Basil Valentine, and other ecclesiastics.\r\nInvocations to divine authority are freely scattered over their pages.\r\nEven the lay alchemist professed to rule his life and conduct by the\r\nexample and precepts of the good Bishop of Regensburg. He was directed\r\nto be patient, assiduous, and persevering; discreet and silent; to work\r\nalone; to shun the favour of princes and nobles, and to ask the divine\r\nblessing on each operation of trituration, sublimation, fixation,\r\ncalcination, solution, distillation, and coagulation.\r\n\r\nAlthough alchemy, at least in its decadent days, lived for the most\r\npart by its appeal to some of the lowest instincts of mankind, and is\r\nonly worth notice as a transient phase in the history of science, a\r\nfew details concerning the tenets and practices of its professors may\r\nbe of interest to the curious reader. And first as regards the nature\r\nof the philosopher’s stone—the grand magistery, the quintessence.\r\nMany alchemists professed to have seen and handled it. It is usually\r\ndescribed as a red powder. Lully mentions it under the name of\r\n_Carbunculus_. Paracelsus says that it was like a ruby, transparent\r\nand brittle as glass; Berigard de Pisa that it was of the colour of\r\na wild poppy, with the smell of heated sea salt; Van Helmont that it\r\nwas like saffron, with the lustre of glass. Helvetius describes it\r\nas of the colour of sulphur. Lastly, an unknown writer, under the\r\npseudonym of “Kalid,” says that it may be of any colour—white, red,\r\nyellow, sky-blue, or green. As the substance was wholly mythical, a\r\ncertain latitude of description may reasonably be expected. Some of\r\nthe alchemists were of opinion that the magistery was of two kinds—the\r\nfirst, the _grand_ magistery, needed for the production of gold; the\r\nsecond, the _small_ magistery, only capable of ennobling a metal as far\r\nas the stage of silver. Then, as to the amounts required to effect a\r\ntransmutation, accounts are equally discrepant. Arnaud de Villeneuve\r\nand Rupescissa assert that one part of the grand magistery will convert\r\na hundred parts of a base metal into gold; Roger Bacon, a hundred\r\nthousand parts; Isaac of Holland, a million. Raymond Lully states that\r\nphilosopher’s stone is of such power that even the gold produced by\r\nmeans of it will ennoble an infinitely large amount of a base metal.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to state that a preparation of such potency\r\nis capable of effecting anything or everything; and accordingly, as\r\ntime went on, other attributes than that of transmutation came to be\r\nassociated with it. It may be, as Boerhaave surmises, that the idea of\r\na universal medicine had its origin in a too literal interpretation\r\nof Geber’s allegory of the six lepers. Be this as it may, during the\r\nfourteenth and fifteenth centuries the philosopher’s stone was gravely\r\nprescribed as a means of preserving health and prolonging life. In\r\ncase of illness one grain was directed to be dissolved in a sufficient\r\nquantity of good white wine, contained in a silver vessel, the draught\r\nto be taken after midnight. Recovery would follow after an interval\r\ndepending upon the severity and age of the complaint. To keep in good\r\nhealth, the dose was to be repeated at the beginning of spring and\r\nautumn. “By this means,” says Daniel Zacharias, “one may enjoy perfect\r\nhealth until the end of the days assigned to one.” Isaac of Holland\r\nand Basil Valentine are equally explicit, but in their case it is\r\nrecommended that the dose should be taken once a month: thus life would\r\nbe prolonged “until the supreme hour fixed by the king of heaven.”\r\nOther alchemists were not always so prudent in prophecy. Artephius gave\r\nthe limit of human life thus prolonged as a thousand years; Gualdo,\r\na Rosicrucian, was stated to have lived four hundred years. Raymond\r\nLully and Salomon Trismosin, we are told, renewed their youth by means\r\nof it. The advanced age at which Noah begat children could only be\r\ndue, says Vincent de Beauvais, to his use of the philosopher’s stone.\r\nDickinson wrote a learned book to prove that the great age of the\r\npatriarchs was owing to the same secret.\r\n\r\nBut not only were health and length of days the fortunate lot of him\r\nwho possessed the philosopher’s stone; increase of wisdom and virtue\r\nequally followed from its use. As it ennobled metals, so it freed\r\nthe heart from evil. It made men as wise as Aristotle or Avicenna,\r\nsweetened adversity, banished vain-glory, ambition, and vicious\r\ndesires. Adam received it at the hands of God, and it was given also to\r\nSolomon, although the commentators were rather exercised to know why,\r\nas he possessed the philosopher’s stone, he should have sent to Ophir\r\nfor gold.\r\n\r\nIt would serve no good purpose to attempt to describe the recipes\r\ngiven by various alchemists to prepare this precious substance. With\r\nan affectation at times of precision, they were purposely obscure, and\r\nalways enigmatical. As Boyle said of them, they could scarcely keep\r\nthemselves from being confuted except by keeping themselves from being\r\nclearly understood. One example of their recipes must suffice: “To fix\r\nquicksilver.—Of several things take 2, 3 and 3, 1; 1 to 3 is 4; 3, 2\r\nand 1. Between 4 and 3 there is 1; 3 from 4 is 1; then 1 and 1, 3 and\r\n4; 1 from 3 is 2. Between 2 and 3 there is 1, between 3 and 2 there is\r\n1. 1, 1, 1, and 1, 2, 2 and 1, 1 and 1 to 2. Then 1 is 1. I have told\r\nyou all.” No wonder, after an equally luminous explication, a pupil\r\nof Arnaud de Villeneuve should have exclaimed: “But, master, I do not\r\nunderstand.” Upon which the master rejoined that he would be clearer\r\nanother time.\r\n\r\nNor is it necessary to dilate upon the other virtues which were\r\nascribed at various times to the philosophical powder, as, for\r\nexample, its power of making pearls and precious stones, or of its\r\nuse in preparing the _alkahest_, or universal solvent, invented by\r\nParacelsus. In their attempts to fathom the depths of human credulity\r\nthe alchemists at length over-reached themselves. The idea of a\r\nuniversal solvent carried with it, as Kunkel pointed out, its own\r\nrefutation: if it dissolved everything, no vessel could contain it. And\r\nyet, says Boerhaave, a whole library could be filled with writings by\r\nthe school of Paracelsus on the alkahest. From the latter end of the\r\nsixteenth century repeated attempts were made to expose the pretensions\r\nand demonstrate the absurdities of alchemy. Among its adversaries may\r\nbe cited Thomas Erastius, Hermann Conringius, and the Jesuit Kircher.\r\nMany of their dupes, potentates and princes who were powerful enough\r\nto exercise it, occasionally visited with their vengeance those who,\r\nunmindful of the injunctions of Albert the Great, had traded too long\r\nupon their credulity. The Emperor Rudolph II., who earned the title of\r\n“The Hermes of Germany,” was a zealous cultivator of alchemy, and had a\r\nwell-equipped laboratory in his palace at Prague, to which every adept\r\nwas welcome. Ferdinand III. and Leopold I. were also patrons of the\r\nhermetic art, as were Frederick I. and his successor, Frederick II.,\r\nKings of Prussia. Indeed, at one period nearly every Court in Europe\r\nhad its alchemist, with the privileges of the Court fool or the poet\r\nlaureate. The fraud and imposture to which the practice gave rise led\r\noccasionally to the promulgation of stringent laws against it, and at\r\ntimes the pursuit of operative chemistry became well-nigh impossible\r\nin some countries. In the fifth year of the reign of Henry IV. (1404)\r\nit was enacted that “None from henceforth shall use to multiply gold\r\nor silver, or use the craft of multiplication; and if the same do he\r\nshall incur the pain of felony.” According to Watson, the true reason\r\nfor passing this Act was not an apprehension that men should ruin their\r\nfortunes by endeavouring to make gold, but a jealousy lest Government\r\nshould be above asking aid of the subject. At the same time, letters\r\npatent were granted to several persons, permitting them to investigate\r\nthe universal medicine and perform the transmutation of metals.\r\n\r\nAlphonse X., of Castille, the author of the _Key of Wisdom_, practised\r\nalchemy. Henry VI., of England, and Edward IV. had dealings with\r\nadepts. Even Elizabeth Tudor, who was a shrewd enough sovereign,\r\nhad the notorious Dr. Dee in her pay. Charles VII. and Charles IX.,\r\nof France, Christian IV., of Denmark, and Charles XII., of Sweden,\r\nsought to replenish their exhausted treasuries by the aid of the\r\nphilosopher’s stone. If princes eventually learned not to put their\r\ntrust in alchemists, alchemists learned equally to their cost not to\r\nput their trust in princes. Duke Julius, of Brunswick, in 1575, burnt\r\na female alchemist, Marie Ziglerin, who had failed in her promise to\r\nfurnish him with a prescription for the making of gold. David Benther\r\nkilled himself to escape the fury of the Elector Augustus, of Saxony.\r\nBragadino was hanged at Munich in 1590 by the Elector of Bavaria.\r\nLeonard Thurneysser, who gained an evil notoriety in his day as one of\r\nthe most unscrupulous of the followers of Paracelsus, and who amassed\r\nconsiderable wealth by the sale of cosmetics and nostrums, was deprived\r\nof his ill-gotten gains in 1584 by the Elector of Brandenburg, and\r\ndied in misery in the convent. Borri, a Milanese adventurer, who had\r\ndeceived Frederick III., of Denmark, was imprisoned for years by that\r\nmonarch, and died in captivity in 1695. William de Krohnemann was\r\nhanged by the Margrave of Byreuth, who, with grim irony, caused the\r\ninscription to be fixed to his gibbet: “I once knew how to fix mercury,\r\nand now I am myself fixed.” Hector de Klettenberg was beheaded in 1720\r\nby Augustus II., King of Poland.\r\n\r\nAll the followers of Hermes were not so wary or so candid as the\r\nartist who declined an invitation to visit the Court of Rudolph II.,\r\nsaying: “If I am an adept, I have no need of the Emperor; if I am not,\r\nthe Emperor has no need of me.” Well might John Clytemius, Abbot of\r\nWiezenberg, write: “_Vanitas, fraus, dolus, sophisticatio, cupiditas,\r\nfalsitas, mendacium, stultitia, paupertas, desesperatio, fuga,\r\nproscriptio et mendicitas, perdisæque sunt chemiæ_.”\r\n\r\nDespite the attacks of Kunkel, Boerhaave, the elder Geoffroy, Klaproth,\r\nand other chemists of influence and repute, alchemy died hard. It\r\nfound believers in England until near the close of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, and was professed even by a Fellow of the Royal Society—Dr.\r\nJames Price, of Guildford, who, in chagrin at the exposure of his\r\npretensions, put an end to his existence in 1783. Hermetic societies\r\nexisted in Westphalia, at Königsberg, and at Carlsruhe down to the\r\nfirst decade of the nineteenth century. M. Chevreul, who lived well\r\ninto that century, relates that he knew of several persons who were\r\nconvinced of the truth of alchemy, among them “generals, doctors,\r\nmagistrates, and ecclesiastics.” The strange medley of alchemy,\r\ntheosophy, thaumaturgy, and cabalisticism professed by Christian\r\nRosenkreuz is not without its adherents, even in this twentieth century.\r\n\r\nIf the baser metals have not been made to furnish gold, truth at least\r\nhas followed from the practice of error. This is the only transmutation\r\nwhich the art of Hermes has succeeded in effecting. To err is human.\r\nAlthough alchemy is not without its special interest as one of the\r\nmost remarkable aberrations in the history of science, some of its\r\npractitioners, it must be admitted, deceived only themselves: if\r\nmisguided, they were at least honest, and pursued their calling in a\r\nsettled conviction of the soundness of their faith. Although they never\r\nreached their goal—the discovery of the Philosopher’s Stone and the\r\nElixir of Life—their labours were not wholly vain, for many new and\r\nunexpected facts came to light as the result of their assiduity.\r\n\r\n“Credulity in arts and opinions,” wrote Lord Bacon in _De Augmentis\r\nScientiarum_,\r\n\r\n  is likewise of two kinds—viz., when men give too much belief to\r\n  arts themselves, or to certain authors in any art. The sciences\r\n  that sway the imagination more than the reason are principally\r\n  three—viz., astrology, natural magic, and alchemy.... Alchemy may\r\n  be compared to the man who told his sons that he had left them\r\n  gold, buried somewhere in his vineyard; while they by digging found\r\n  no gold, but by turning up the mould about the roots of the vines\r\n  procured a plentiful vintage. So the search and endeavours to make\r\n  gold have brought many useful inventions of light.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nIATRO-CHEMISTRY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe term “iatro-chemistry” denotes a particular phase in the history\r\nof medicine and of chemistry. The iatro-chemists were a school of\r\nphysicians who sought to apply chemical principles to the elucidation\r\nof vital phenomena. According to them, human illnesses result from\r\nabnormal chemical processes within the body, and these could only be\r\ncounteracted by appropriate chemical remedies. Although this idea did\r\nnot originate with him, the chief exponent of this school is commonly\r\nsaid to be Paracelsus.\r\n\r\nA man of violent passions, coarse, drunken, arrogant, and unscrupulous,\r\n=Philippus Aureolus Theophrastus Paracelsus Bombastus von Hohenheim=—to\r\ngive him his full name—would seem to have possessed none of the\r\nattributes needed by the successful leader of an intellectual\r\nrevolution.\r\n\r\nBorn at Etzel in Switzerland in 1493, son of a physician, William\r\nBombast von Hohenheim, who combined the practice of astrology with\r\nthat of alchemy, Paracelsus, even as a youth, became a wanderer,\r\npassing from province to province and cloister to cloister, living\r\nby telling fortunes and practising sometimes as a quack and at other\r\ntimes as an army surgeon, and gaining, as he tells us, much curious\r\ninformation from old women, gipsies, conjurers, and chemists. If we may\r\ntrust his own account of himself, he had, before he was thirty-three,\r\nwandered over the whole of Europe, and even into Africa and Asia,\r\neverywhere performing miraculous cures and constantly getting into\r\ntrouble. In 1526 he secured the appointment of Professor of Physic in\r\nthe University of Basle, and signalised his occupancy of the chair\r\nby a course of lectures—a farrago of confused German and barbarous\r\nLatin—in which he assailed with extraordinary vigour and unexampled\r\ncoarseness the medical system of the school of Galen. Scandalised as\r\nhis professional brethren might be, Paracelsus expressed, intentionally\r\nor unintentionally, the feeling of impatience with which the laity\r\nviewed a system of therapeutics based only on tradition. In this revolt\r\nagainst authority he initiated a movement which, whatever might have\r\nbeen its influence on medicine, served eventually, under the guidance\r\nof worthier men, to emancipate chemistry from the thraldom of alchemy.\r\n\r\nParacelsus did little more than initiate. Although his many tracts\r\nshow that he was familiar with nearly every chemical preparation of\r\nhis time, many of which he used in his practice, he added no new\r\nsubstance to science. A man of great ability and extraordinary talent,\r\nhe squandered his powers in dissipation. His intemperate conduct soon\r\nlost him his chair at Basle; and, after an ignoble quarrel with the\r\nmagistracy, he fled the town, and, resuming his wandering life, died,\r\nunder wretched circumstances, at Salzburg, in his forty-eighth year.\r\n\r\nSpace will not permit of any account of the philosophical opinions\r\nof Paracelsus—of his mysticism, his theosophy, his pantheism, his\r\nextraordinary doctrine of the Archæus and Tartarus, his association of\r\nastrology with medicine. His chief merit lies in his insistence that\r\nthe true function of chemistry was not to make gold artificially, but\r\nto prepare medicines and substances useful to the arts. He thereby made\r\nchemistry indispensable to medicine, and thenceforward chemistry began\r\nto be taught in the universities and in the schools as an essential\r\npart of a medical education.\r\n\r\nParacelsus is usually regarded as a typical alchemist—the kind of\r\nman made familiar to us by the paintings of Teniers, Van Ostade, and\r\nStein—a boorish, maudlin knave, who divided his time between the\r\npothouse and the kitchen in which he prepared his extracts, simples,\r\ntinctures, and the other nostrums which he palmed off upon a credulous\r\nworld, as ignorant and superstitious as himself. There is much in the\r\npersonal history of Paracelsus that serves to justify such a view of\r\nhim. That he was in the main an impudent charlatan, ignorant, vain, and\r\npretentious, there can be little doubt. He had an astonishing audacity\r\nand a boundless effrontery; and it was largely by the exercise of these\r\nqualities that he secured such professional success as he enjoyed.\r\n\r\nTo judge from the number of the published works associated with his\r\nname, he was an active and industrious writer. Considering that during\r\nthe greater part of his waking time he was more or less intoxicated, it\r\nis difficult to conceive what opportunity he had for composing them.\r\nOnly one or two are known to be genuine. These, according to Operinus,\r\nhis publisher, he dictated; and from their incoherence and obscurity,\r\ntheir mystical jargon, and misuse of terms, they read like the ravings\r\nof one whom drunkenness had deprived of reason. Many of the tracts and\r\nlarger works appeared after his death—some of them years after; and\r\nthere is no certain proof that he was the actual author. Even if we\r\nregard them as suppositious, the fact that they should be published\r\nunder his name is significant of the influence and notoriety which this\r\nextraordinary man succeeded in achieving during his short and chequered\r\ncareer.\r\n\r\nThe immediate followers of Paracelsus—among whom may be named\r\nThurneysser, Dorn, Severinus, Duchesne—distinguished themselves only\r\nby the boldness with which they promulgated his doctrines, and the\r\nunscrupulous use which they made of his methods. They were all zealous\r\nanti-Galenists, who professed to believe that the sum and perfection\r\nof human knowledge was to be found in the Cabala, and that the secrets\r\nof magical medicine were contained in the Apocalypse. They adopted\r\npantheism in all its grossness: everything that exists eats, drinks,\r\nand voids excrement; even minerals and liquids assimilate food, and\r\neliminate what they do not incorporate. Sylphs inhabit the air, nymphs\r\nthe water, pigmies the earth, and salamanders the fire. Thus even the\r\nAristotelian elements were animated. Mercury, sulphur, and salt were,\r\naccording to Paracelsus, the primal principles which entered into\r\nthe composition of all things, material and immaterial, visible and\r\ninvisible. The following so-called “harmonies” were essential articles\r\nof faith with a Paracelsian:—\r\n\r\n    Soul       Spirit     Body\r\n    Mercury    Sulphur    Salt\r\n    Water      Air        Earth\r\n\r\nThe laws of the Cabala were held to explain the functions of the body.\r\nThe sun rules the heart, the moon the brain, Jupiter the liver, Saturn\r\nthe spleen, Mercury the lungs, Mars the bile, Venus the kidneys.\r\nGold was a specific against diseases of the heart; the liquor of Luna\r\n(solution of silver) cures diseases of the brain. “The remedies,” said\r\nParacelsus, “are subjected to the will of the stars, and directed by\r\nthem. You ought, therefore, to wait until heaven is favourable before\r\nordering a medicine.”\r\n\r\nThe Paracelsian physicians, for the most part, were a set of dangerous\r\nfanatics, who, in their contempt for the principles of Hippocrates,\r\nGalen, and Avicenna, and in their reckless use of powerful remedies,\r\nmany of them metallic poisons, wrought untold misery and mischief. The\r\ninevitable reaction set in, and certain of the faculties, particularly\r\nthat of Paris, prohibited their licentiates, under severe penalties,\r\nfrom using chemical remedies. It is not to be supposed, however, that\r\nall iatro-chemists were unscrupulous charlatans. Some of them clearly\r\nperceived the significance and true value of the movement which\r\nParacelsus may be credited with having originated.\r\n\r\n=Andreas Libavius=, or Libau, originally a physician, born in Halle,\r\nis best known by his _Alchymia_, published in 1595, which contains an\r\naccount of the main chemical facts known in his time, and is written\r\nin clear and intelligible language, in strong contrast to the mystery\r\nand obscurity of his predecessors. He was the discoverer of stannic\r\nchloride, still known as the fuming liquor of Libavius, and described\r\na method of preparing oil of vitriol in principle identical with that\r\nnow made use of on a manufacturing scale. He died in 1616.\r\n\r\n=John Baptist van Helmont=, a scion of a noble Brabant family, was\r\nborn in Brussels in 1577. After studying philosophy and theology at\r\nthe University of Louvain, he directed his attention to medicine, and\r\nmade himself familiar, in turn, with every system from Hippocrates to\r\nParacelsus. Having spent some time in travel, he settled on his estate\r\nat Vilvorde, and occupied himself with laboratory pursuits until his\r\ndeath in 1644.\r\n\r\nVan Helmont was a scholarly, studious man, and a philosopher. A\r\ntheosophist and prone to mysticism, he had many of the mental\r\ncharacteristics of Paracelsus, without his fanaticism and overweening\r\negotism. He narrowed the number of Aristotle’s elements down to one,\r\nand, like Thales, considered water to be the true principle of all\r\nthings, supporting his theory by ingenious observations on the growth\r\nof plants (see p. 20). He first employed the term _gas_, and was aware\r\nof the existence of various æriform substances, anticipating Hales, who\r\nhas been styled the father of pneumatic chemistry, in the discovery of\r\nmany gaseous phenomena. He gave an accurate description of carbonic\r\nacid gas, which he termed _gas sylvestre_, and showed that it is\r\nproduced from limestone and potashes in the fermentation of wine and\r\nbeer, and that it is formed in the body and in the earth. The doctrines\r\nof the iatro-chemists were further spread by Sylvius in Holland, and by\r\nWillis in England.\r\n\r\n=Francis de le Boë Sylvius=, born at Hanau in 1614, became Professor\r\nof Medicine in the University of Leyden, where he exercised great\r\ninfluence as a teacher until his death in 1672. Medicine he treated\r\nsimply as a branch of applied chemistry, and the vital processes of\r\nthe animal body as purely chemical. He freed the theory of physic from\r\nmuch of the mystical absurdity introduced into it by Paracelsus and\r\nvan Helmont, and by his practice brought chemical remedies once more\r\ninto vogue. He was aware of the distinction between venous and arterial\r\nblood, and that the red colour of the latter was due to the influence\r\nof air. Combustion and respiration he regarded as analogous phenomena.\r\n\r\n=Thomas Willis= was born in Wiltshire in 1621, and while a student at\r\nChristchurch bore arms in the Royalist army when Oxford was garrisoned\r\nfor Charles I. In 1660 he became Sedleian Professor of Natural\r\nPhilosophy, and ultimately settled in London as a physician. He died in\r\n1675, and was buried in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\nWillis imagined that all vital actions were due to different kinds of\r\nfermentation, and that diseases were caused by abnormalities in the\r\nfermentative process. Although a Paracelsian as regards his theory of\r\nthe constitution of matter, he followed Sylvius and his pupil Tachenius\r\nin banishing mysticism from medicine. He was a skilful anatomist, and\r\ngave the first accurate description of the brain and nerves.\r\n\r\nOther notable iatro-chemists were Angelus Sala, Daniel Sennert, Turquet\r\nde Mayerne (who became body physician to James I.), Oswald Croll,\r\nAdrian van Mynsicht, and Thomas Lieber. Croll introduced the use of\r\npotassium sulphate and succinic acid into medicine, and Van Mynsicht\r\nthat of tartar emetic. Various antimonial preparations had previously\r\nbeen employed by chemical physicians since the time of Basil Valentine,\r\ndespite the ban of the Parliament of Paris on their use.\r\n\r\nThe chief service of iatro-chemistry to science consisted in its\r\ninfluence in bringing chemistry within the range of professional study,\r\nwhereby a great extension in its pursuit was effected, with the result\r\nthat a largely increased number of substances was discovered. Moreover,\r\nthis wider experience of chemical processes familiarised workers with\r\nchemical phenomena in general, and thereby contributed to lay the\r\nfoundations of a general theory of chemical action, which a succeeding\r\nage strove to complete.\r\n\r\nDuring the period of iatro-chemistry, which may be said to have\r\nextended from the first quarter of the sixteenth century to the latter\r\nhalf of the seventeenth, chemistry was advanced along practical\r\nlines by the labours of many men, chief of whom were Agricola the\r\nmetallurgist, Palissy the potter, and Glauber the technologist. These\r\nmen were primarily experimental chemists, who took little or no part\r\nin the fruitless polemics of the period, but followed their avocation\r\nin the true spirit of investigators, and thereby enriched science with\r\nmany new and well-ascertained facts.\r\n\r\n=George Agricola=, born at Glauchau in Saxony in 1494, was a\r\ncontemporary of Paracelsus. After studying medicine at Leipzig, he\r\ndevoted himself to metallurgy and mineralogy, first at Joachimsthal,\r\nand published a number of works which were long deservedly regarded as\r\nthe leading treatises on these subjects.\r\n\r\nIn his _Libri_ XII. _de re Metallica_ he gives an account of what was\r\nknown in his time respecting the extraction, preparation, and testing\r\nof ores. He describes the smelting of copper and the recovery of the\r\nsilver which might be associated with it. He also describes methods of\r\nobtaining quicksilver, and of purifying it by treatment with salt and\r\nvinegar. He gives a full description of the method of obtaining gold by\r\namalgamation, and of recovering the mercury by distillation. He gives\r\naccounts of the smelting of lead, tin, iron, bismuth, and antimony,\r\nand describes the manufacture of salt, nitre, alum, and green vitriol.\r\n\r\nThe whole work, which is of folio size, is illustrated by wood-cuts,\r\nwhich give a faithful idea of the nature of the several operations, and\r\nof the character of furnaces, trompes, bellows, and tools employed in\r\nthem. It is by far the most important technical work of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, and it exercised great influence on the art of metallurgy.\r\nThe descriptions—at least as regards European processes—are evidently\r\nthe result of personal observation. Agricola visited the mines, and\r\nfaithfully noted the different methods of sorting and washing the\r\nores, the characters of which he accurately describes. His accounts\r\nof the various smelting operations are so detailed that it is obvious\r\nthey must have been put together after personal inquiry. The study of\r\nmetallurgy, indeed, was the main object of his life; and he devoted to\r\nits pursuit even the pension which had been settled on him by Maurice,\r\nElector of Saxony. He became Mayor of Chemnitz, died there in 1555, and\r\nwas buried at Zeitz.\r\n\r\n=Bernard Palissy= lived throughout the greater portion of the sixteenth\r\ncentury. Although not a professed chemist, nor a follower of any\r\nparticular school, he was an ardent self-taught experimentalist and a\r\nkeen and accurate observer, who greatly enriched ceramic art by his\r\ndiscoveries.\r\n\r\n=Johann Rudolf Glauber= was born at Karlstadt, in Bavaria, in 1604,\r\nand after a restless life died in Amsterdam in his sixty-fourth year.\r\nHe published an encyclopædia of chemical processes, in which he\r\ndescribes the preparation of a great variety of substances of technical\r\nimportance. The greater number of the pharmacopœias of the seventeenth\r\ncentury are indebted to him for their descriptions of the mode of\r\nmanufacture of their official preparations. He discovered sodium\r\nsulphate—his _sal mirabile_, still frequently named after him—and\r\nintroduced it into medicine.\r\n\r\nDuring this period the common mineral acids—sulphuric, hydrochloric,\r\nand nitric—became ordinary articles of commerce, and were used in the\r\nmanufacture of a number of useful products, chiefly inorganic salts.\r\nA considerable number of metallic oxides were also in common use, and\r\nwere applied to a variety of purposes in the arts. The knowledge of\r\ndefinite organic substances was much more limited. Acetic acid had long\r\nbeen known, but was first obtained in a concentrated form during this\r\nperiod by the distillation of verdigris. A number of other acetates\r\nwere also known, as well as certain tartrates—as, for example, salt of\r\nsorrel, Rochelle or seignette salt, and tartar emetic. Succinic and\r\nbenzoic acid were introduced into medicine, and Tachenius discovered\r\none of the characteristic acids of fat and oil (stearic acid). Spirit\r\nof wine was, of course, largely made and used in the preparation of\r\ntinctures and essences. Ether, originally known as _oleum vitrioli\r\ndulce verum_, was first discovered by Valerius Cordus; and a mixture of\r\nit with alcohol, long known as Hoffmann’s drops, appears to have been\r\nemployed as a medicine by Paracelsus.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n“THE SCEPTICAL CHEMIST”: THE DAWN OF SCIENTIFIC CHEMISTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe latter half of the seventeenth century was a remarkable period\r\nin the history of the intellectual development of Europe. At that\r\ntime nearly every department of human knowledge seemed to have become\r\npermeated by an eager spirit of scepticism, inquiry, and reform.\r\nThe foundation of the Royal Society of London for Improving Natural\r\nKnowledge, the Accademia del Cimento of Florence, the Academie Royale\r\nat Paris, the Berlin Academy, all within a few years of each other,\r\nwas significant of the times. Chemistry was no longer to be a sacred\r\nmystery, to be known only to priests, and its secrets jealously\r\nguarded by them. Science had chafed under the domination of the\r\nschoolmen; it was now contemptuous of the dialectics of the Spagyrists.\r\nExperimentarian philosophy became even fashionable; and the purely\r\ndeductive methods of the Peripatetics gradually gave place to the only\r\nsound method of advancing natural knowledge. The supremacy of the\r\nold philosophy may be said to have been first distinctly challenged\r\nby Robert Boyle. The appearance in 1661 of his book, _The Sceptical\r\nChemist_, marks a turning-point in the history of chemistry. The\r\n“Chemico-physical Doubts and Paradoxes” raised by Boyle “touching the\r\nexperiments whereby vulgar Spagyrists are wont to endeavour to evince\r\ntheir Salt, Sulphur, and Mercury to be the true Principles of Things,”\r\neventually sealed the fate of the doctrine of the _tria prima_, and of\r\nthe tenets of the school of Paracelsus.\r\n\r\nIn this treatise Boyle sets out to prove that the number of the\r\nperipatetic elements or principles hitherto assumed by chemists is, to\r\nsay the least, doubtful. The words “element” and “principle” are used\r\nby him as equivalent terms, and signify those primitive and simple\r\nbodies of which compounds may be said to be composed, and into which\r\nthese compounds are ultimately resolvable. He considered that the\r\nmatter of all bodies was originally divided into small particles of\r\ndifferent shapes and sizes, and that these particles might unite into\r\nsmall “parcels,” not easily separable again; that a great variety of\r\ncompounds may arise from a few ingredients; that various substances are\r\nobtainable from bodies by fire; that fire is not the true and genuine\r\nanalyser of bodies, since it does not separate the principles of a\r\nbody, but variously alters its nature; and that some things obtained\r\nfrom a body by fire were not its proper or essential ingredients.\r\nThree is not precisely and universally the number of the distinct\r\nsubstances or elements into which all compound bodies are resolvable\r\nby fire, inasmuch as some bodies afford more than three principles.\r\nEarth and water are as much chemical principles as salt, sulphur, and\r\nmercury. Even the limitation to five chemical principles is too narrow.\r\nSuch is proved to be the case by the mode in which bodies, animals\r\nand vegetable, grow, and by the analysis of minerals and metals. The\r\nchemical theory of “qualities” of the Spagyrists is narrow, defective,\r\nand uncertain; supposes things not proved; is often superfluous, and\r\nfrequently contradicts the phenomena of nature. The “principles” found\r\nin bodies cannot be the cause of their qualities, since contrary\r\nqualities are ascribed to the same body. He concludes, therefore, that\r\nthe Paracelsian elements—their “salt,” “sulphur,” and “mercury”—are not\r\nthe first and most simple principles of bodies; but that these consist,\r\nat most, of concretions of corpuscles or particles more simple than\r\nthey, and possessing the radical and universal properties of volume,\r\nshape, and motion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ROBERT BOYLE.\r\n\r\nFrom a painting by F. Kerseboom in the possession of the Royal Society.]\r\n\r\n=Robert Boyle=, fourteenth child and the seventh and youngest son of\r\nRichard the “Great” Earl of Cork, and Lord High Chancellor of Ireland,\r\nwas born at Lismore in 1626. He was educated at Eton under Sir Henry\r\nWotton, and, after spending some years on the Continent, settled at\r\nStalbridge in Dorset, where he owned a manor. He became a member of\r\nwhat was known as the Invisible College, a small association of men\r\ninterested in the new philosophy, who met at each other’s houses in\r\nLondon, and occasionally at Gresham College, “to discourse and consider\r\nof philosophical inquiries and such as related thereunto.” The meetings\r\nwere subsequently held in Oxford, and Boyle took up his residence there\r\nin 1654. Here—in association with Wilkins; John Wallis and Seth Ward,\r\nthe two Savilian Professors of Geometry and Astronomy; Thomas Willis,\r\nthe physician, then student of Christ Church; Christopher Wren, then\r\nFellow of All Souls’ College; Goddard, Warden of Merton; and Ralph\r\nBathurst, Fellow of Trinity, and afterwards its President—they sought\r\nto cultivate the new philosophy, “being satisfied that there was no\r\ncertain way of arriving at any competent knowledge unless they made a\r\nvariety of experiments upon natural bodies. In order to discover what\r\nphenomena they would produce, they pursued that method by themselves\r\nwith great industry, and then communicated their discoveries to each\r\nother.” The Invisible College eventually grew into the Royal Society,\r\nwhich received its charter in 1663. Boyle removed to London in 1668,\r\nand died there on December 31st, 1691, in the sixty-fifth year of his\r\nage.\r\n\r\nA man of integrity, modest, simple, and unassuming, Boyle was an\r\nassiduous and true student of science, and practically the whole of\r\nhis life was given to its pursuit. His social position, his example,\r\nthe purity of his private life, and the fame of his discoveries made\r\nhis personal influence very considerable, to the great advantage of\r\nscience in this country. His experimental work was of a high order.\r\nHe introduced the air-pump into England, and his “pneumatical engine”\r\nenabled him to discover many of the fundamental properties of a gas,\r\nnotably the relation of its volume to pressure. He also discovered\r\nthe dependence of the boiling point of a liquid upon atmospheric\r\npressure, explained the action of the syphon, the effect of the air\r\non the vibration of a pendulum and on the propagation of sound, and\r\nmade experiments on the nature of flame, and on the relation of air to\r\ncombustion and respiration. In his _History of Fluidity_ he seeks to\r\nshow that a body seems to be fluid by consisting of corpuscles touching\r\none another only in some parts of their surfaces; whence, by reason of\r\nthe numerous spaces between them, they easily glide along each other\r\ntill they meet with some resisting body to whose internal surface they\r\nexquisitely accommodate themselves. He considers the requisites of\r\nfluidity to be chiefly these: The smallness of the component particles,\r\ntheir determinate figure, the vacant spaces between them, and the fact\r\nof their being agitated variously and apart by their own innate motion\r\nor by some thinner substance which tosses them about in its passage\r\nthrough them. His published works contain many well-authenticated\r\nchemical facts, which are commonly held to be the discovery of a\r\nlater time. He prepared acetone by the distillation of the acetates\r\nof lead and lime; and he isolated methyl alcohol from the products of\r\nthe destructive distillation of wood. He was one of the earliest to\r\ninsist on the necessity of studying the forms of crystals. He saw in\r\ntheir formation proof that the internal motions, configuration, and\r\nposition of the integral parts are all that is necessary to account for\r\nalterations and diversities in outward character. Some of the stock\r\nillustrations of our lecture-rooms were of his contrivance. Thus he\r\nillustrated the expansive power of freezing water by bursting a plugged\r\ngun-barrel filled with water by solidifying the water by means of a\r\nmixture of snow and salt—a freezing mixture which he first introduced.\r\n\r\nBoyle was the first to formulate our present conception of an element\r\nin contradistinction to that of the Greeks and the schoolmen who\r\ninfluenced the theories of the iatro-chemists. In the sense understood\r\nby him, the Aristotelian elements were not true elements, nor were the\r\nsalt, sulphur, and mercury of the school of Paracelsus. He was also\r\nthe first to define the relation of an element to a compound, and to\r\ndraw the distinction we still make between compounds and mixtures. He\r\nrevived the atomic hypothesis, and explained chemical combination on\r\nthe basis of affinity. He contended that one of the main objects of\r\nthe chemist was to ascertain the nature of compounds; and thereby he\r\nstimulated the application of analysis to chemistry. Boyle discovered a\r\nnumber of qualitative reactions, and applied them to the detection of\r\nsubstances, either free or in combination.\r\n\r\nBut Boyle’s greatest service to learning consisted in the new spirit\r\nhe introduced into chemistry. Henceforward chemistry was no longer\r\nthe mere helpmeet of medicine. She became an independent science, the\r\nprinciples of which were to be ascertained by experiment; a science\r\nto be studied with the object of discovering the laws regulating the\r\nphenomena with which it is concerned—and hence elucidating truth for\r\ntruth’s sake. The old philosophy of the Greeks had, as we have seen,\r\nbecome merged into the doctrine of the iatro-chemists; and this was now\r\nto be purified from the theosophical mysticism with which Paracelsus\r\nand his followers had enshrouded it. “The dialectical subtleties of\r\nthe schoolmen much more,” says Boyle, “declare the wit of him that\r\nuses them than increase the knowledge or remove the doubts of sober\r\nlovers of truth.... For in such speculative inquiries where the naked\r\nknowledge of the truth is the thing principally aimed at, what does\r\nhe teach me worth thanks, that does not, if he can, make his notion\r\nintelligible to me, but by mystical terms and ambiguous phrases darkens\r\nwhat he should clear up, and makes me add the trouble of guessing at\r\nthe sense of what he equivocally expresses, to that of learning the\r\ntruth of what he seems to deliver.” The influence of the new spirit\r\nthus infused into the science by Boyle is seen in the general style\r\nof chemical literature at the end of the seventeenth century, when\r\ncompared with that of the close of the sixteenth. The mysticism and\r\nobscurity of the alchemists were no longer tolerated.\r\n\r\nBoyle was slender and tall, with a countenance pale and emaciated.\r\nHis constitution was delicate and his body feeble, and it was only\r\nby strict attention to diet and regularity of exercise that he\r\naccomplished what he did. Although he suffered occasionally from an\r\nexcessive lowness of spirits, there was nothing morose or ascetic\r\nin his nature. He was never married, although, says his friend John\r\nEvelyn, “few men were more facetious and agreeable in conversation with\r\nthe ladies whenever he happened to be engaged among them.”\r\n\r\nKindly, courteous, charitable; unaffected, and temperate in his\r\nmanner of life, Boyle enjoyed the respect and esteem of all his\r\ncontemporaries. It was said of him that he was never known to have\r\noffended any person in his whole life by any part of his deportment.\r\nHe allowed himself a great deal of decent cheerfulness, and had about\r\nhim all the tenderness of good nature, as well as all the softness of\r\nfriendship. These gave him a large share of other men’s concerns, for\r\nhe had a quick sense of the miseries of mankind. Although a philosopher\r\nin the broadest sense of that term, his peculiar and favourite study\r\nwas chemistry, “in which,” says Bishop Burnet, “he engaged with none\r\nof those ravenous and ambitious designs that drew many into them. His\r\ndesign was only to find out nature, to see into what principles things\r\nmight be resolved, and of what they were compounded.”\r\n\r\n=John Kunkel=, born in 1630, was the son of an alchemist attached\r\nto the Court of the Duke of Holstein. After serving his father for\r\nsome years, he obtained employment as chemist and pharmacist under\r\nthe Dukes Charles and Henry, of Lauenburg. He subsequently entered\r\nthe laboratory at Dresden of John George II., Elector of Saxony,\r\nand, after teaching chemistry at the University of Wittenburg, then\r\nfamous as a medical school, he accepted an invitation to take charge\r\nof the glass works and laboratory of the Elector of Brandenburg, at\r\nBerlin. The laboratory was burnt down, and then Charles XI. of Sweden\r\ncalled him to Stockholm and ennobled him as Baron von Lowenstiern. He\r\ndied in Stockholm in 1702. Kunkel’s chief work is his _Laboratorium\r\nChymicum_, published after his death. It was written in German. In\r\nit Kunkel relates how he acquired possession of a knowledge of the\r\nmanufacture of Baldwin’s phosphorus, and of the phosphorus discovered\r\nby Brand—perhaps the most important, as it certainly was one of the\r\nmost striking, of the chemical discoveries of the seventeenth century.\r\nKunkel did much to liberate chemical literature from the mysticism and\r\nobscurity of alchemy. He was scornful of the theories of the adepts,\r\nand contemptuous of their _tria prima_.\r\n\r\n  I, old man that I am, who have been occupied with chemistry for\r\n  sixty years, have never yet been able to discover their fixed\r\n  sulphur, or how it enters into the composition of metals....\r\n  Moreover, they are not agreed among themselves respecting the kind\r\n  of sulphur. The sulphur of one is not the sulphur of the other. To\r\n  that one may reply that each is at liberty to baptise his child as\r\n  he likes. I agree: you may even, if you are so disposed, call an\r\n  ass a cow; but you will never make anyone believe that your cow is\r\n  an ass.\r\n\r\nAs to the alkahest he says:—\r\n\r\n  There has been much discussion concerning this grand natural\r\n  solvent. Some derive it from the Latin—_akali est_; others from the\r\n  two German words _all geist_ (all gas); lastly, others say it is\r\n  from _alles est_ (that’s all). As to myself, I do not believe in\r\n  Van Helmont’s universal solvent. I call it by its true name—_alles\r\n  Lügen heist_, or _alles Lügen ist_ (it is all a lie).\r\n\r\nKunkel discovered the secret of the manufacture of aventurine glass\r\nand of ruby glass by means of the purple of Cassius—a product from\r\ngold first obtained by a doctor of medicine of that name in Hamburg.\r\nHe made observations on fermentation and putrefaction—recognised that\r\nalum was a double salt (_salduplicatum_); described the present method\r\nof repairing pure silver, and of parting gold and silver by means\r\nof sulphuric acid. He also described the mode of preparing a number\r\nof essential oils, detected the presence of stearopten in oils, and\r\ndiscovered nitrous ether.\r\n\r\n=John Joachim Becher=, the son of a Lutheran minister, was born at\r\nSpeyer in 1635. Owing to the death of his father and the devastation\r\nof the family property during the Thirty Years’ War, Becher had a\r\nhard struggle with poverty during his youth, and led a restless,\r\nwandering life. In 1666 he was Professor of Medicine in the University\r\nof Mayence. Subsequently he went to Munich as head of the finest\r\nlaboratory in Europe, but, quarrelling with the Chancellor of the\r\nBavarian Court, betook himself to Vienna. After a short stay there, he\r\nquitted Austria for Holland, and established himself in Haarlem. Here\r\nhe proposed to the States-General to extract gold from the sand-dunes;\r\nbut, the project failing, he left for England and visited the Cornish\r\nmines. On the invitation of the Duke of Mecklenburg-Güstrow, he\r\nreturned to Germany. Shortly afterwards (in 1682) he died, in the\r\nforty-seventh year of his age. Becher’s name is remembered mainly in\r\nconnection with his theory of combustion, which, as we shall see,\r\nwas subsequently developed by Stahl into the theory of Phlogiston—a\r\ngeneralisation which dominated chemistry until near the close of the\r\neighteenth century.\r\n\r\n=John Mayow=, born in Cornwall in 1645, was a practising physician,\r\nwhose name chiefly lives by virtue of his clear recognition of the\r\nsubstance or principle in the air which is concerned in combustion,\r\nthe calcination of metals, respiration, and the conversion of venous\r\ninto arterial blood. This substance, which he found to be contained in\r\nsaltpetre, he called _spiritus igno-aëreus_ or _nitro aëreust_. Mayow\r\ndied at the age of thirty-four. Had he been able to follow up his\r\nobservations, he might have influenced very materially the development\r\nof theoretical chemistry. As it was, he was practically overlooked by\r\nhis contemporaries, and the real significance of his work was not\r\nappreciated until long afterwards.\r\n\r\n=Nicolas Lemery=, also born in 1645, wrote a _Cours de Chimie_, one\r\nof the best text-books of the time, which passed through as many as\r\nthirteen editions, and was translated into English, German, Latin,\r\nItalian, and Spanish.\r\n\r\nIn this book he strove, as he says, to express himself clearly, and to\r\navoid the obscurities which were to be found in the authors who had\r\npreceded him.\r\n\r\n  The fine imaginations of other philosophers concerning their\r\n  physical principles may elevate the spirit by their grand ideas,\r\n  but they prove nothing demonstratively. And, as chemistry is a\r\n  science of observation, it can only be based on what is palpable\r\n  and demonstrative.\r\n\r\nNicolas Lemery, who is not to be confounded with his son Louis, also a\r\nchemist, made a considerable number of contributions to pharmaceutical\r\nchemistry; and his _Pharmacopée Universelle_, _Dictionnaire Universel\r\ndes Drogues Simples_, and _Traité de l’Antimoine_ were standard works\r\nin their day.\r\n\r\nLemery was at one time a Protestant, and on the revocation of the Edict\r\nof Nantes fled to England; but, embracing Catholicism, he returned to\r\nParis, re-established his pharmacy, and was elected into the Academy in\r\n1699. He died in 1715.\r\n\r\n=William Homberg=, born in Batavia in 1652, was originally intended\r\nfor the profession of law, but, becoming attached to science, studied\r\nbotany and medicine in Padua, chemistry at Bologna and in London,\r\nmechanics and optics at Rome, and anatomy at Leyden. In the course of\r\nhis travels he visited the mines of Germany, Hungary, Bohemia, and\r\nSweden. In 1682 he was invited to Paris by Colbert, and in 1691 was\r\nmade a member of the Academy and was placed by the Duke of Orleans in\r\ncharge of his laboratory—then one of the finest in Europe. Homberg\r\nmarried the daughter of Dodart, the physician. She became an expert\r\n_préparateur_, and was of great assistance to him in his experimental\r\ninquiries. He first made known the existence of phosphorus in France,\r\ndiscovered by Brand, of Hamburg, and he described the phosphorescent\r\nsalt associated with his name. He made important observations on the\r\nsaturation of alkalis by acids, and was aware that they combined in\r\ndifferent proportions. He was an industrious worker, and, with the\r\nexception of Cassini, was the most active member of the Academy. He\r\ndied on September 24th, 1715.\r\n\r\nNext to Boyle, perhaps the most active agent in emancipating chemistry\r\nfrom the yoke of alchemy was Boerhaave, who, by his teaching as\r\nProfessor of Physic, raised the University of Leyden to the summit of\r\nits fame.\r\n\r\n=Hermann Boerhaave=, the son of a minister, was born near Leyden, in\r\n1668. He occupied himself in turn with theology, classics, mathematics,\r\nchemistry, and botany, when he turned to physic, and, after a course of\r\nstudy at the University of Harderwyk, in Gelderland, began to practise.\r\nIn 1702 he was appointed to a lectureship, and eventually to the Chair\r\nof Medicine, in the University of Leyden, of which he became Rector\r\nin 1714. His reputation as a teacher spread throughout Europe, and\r\nsteadily increased until his death.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HERMANNUS BOERHAAVE\r\n\r\nMedicinæ, Botanices, Chemiæ\r\n\r\n& Collegii practici, in ACAD. LUGD. BAT.\r\n\r\nPROFESSOR ORDINARIUS.\r\n\r\nAfter a painting by T. Wandelaar]\r\n\r\nBoerhaave was one of the most learned men of his age, and singularly\r\nwell cultured, not only in science but in history, poetry, and polite\r\nliterature. He conversed in English, French, and German, and read\r\nItalian and Spanish with facility. “The Latin he spoke extempore in\r\nlectures or conversation was so clear that, with his action, method,\r\nand the aptness of his similes, he could level the most abstruse\r\npoints to the meanest capacities.”[2] He was fond of music, and a good\r\nperformer on several instruments, particularly the lute. He delighted\r\nto welcome musicians to his house. His profession as a physician\r\nbrought him wealth, much of which he spent in horticulture; and the\r\ngarden of his country seat, nearly eight acres in extent, was enriched\r\nwith all the exotic trees he could procure and induce to flourish in\r\nthe climate of Holland.\r\n\r\n    [2] Burton, _Life of Boerhaave_, p. 58 _et seq._\r\n\r\nBoerhaave was of a robust frame and healthy constitution, early inured\r\nto constant exercise and the inclemencies of weather. His stature was\r\nrather tall, and his habit corpulent. He had a large head, short neck,\r\nflorid complexion, light brown curled hair (for he did not wear a wig),\r\nan open countenance, and resembled Socrates in the flatness of his nose\r\nand his natural urbanity. He died at Leyden on September 23rd, 1738, in\r\nthe seventieth year of his age.\r\n\r\nAs a chemist Boerhaave is chiefly known by his _Elementa Chemia_,\r\npublished in 1732—the most complete and most luminous chemical treatise\r\nof its time, translations of which appeared in the chief European\r\nlanguages. The work is divided into three main parts. The first is\r\nconcerned with the origin and progress of the art, and with the\r\npersonal history of its most distinguished cultivators. The second and\r\nlargest part deals with the attempt to form a system of chemistry based\r\non such observational matter as seemed well established. The third\r\nconsists of a collection of chemical processes relating to the analysis\r\nor decomposition of bodies, grouped under the heads of “vegetables,”\r\n“animals,” and “fossils”—the beginnings, in fact, of subdivision of the\r\nscience into organic and inorganic chemistry.\r\n\r\nAs regards his belief in alchemy, Boerhaave was an agnostic: he neither\r\naffirmed nor denied the possibility of transmutation. In this respect\r\nhe resembled Newton and Boyle. Boyle, indeed, was singularly cautious\r\nand reticent in his references to alchemistic matters. As was said of\r\nhim by Shaw, he was too wise to set any bounds to nature: he was not\r\nprone to say that every strange thing must needs be impossible, for\r\nhe saw strange things every day, and was well aware that there are\r\npowerful forces in the world of whose laws and modes of action he knew\r\nnothing. With that wariness which was habitual to him, he was wont to\r\nsay that “those who had seen them might better believe them than those\r\nwho had not”; and he was modest enough to suppose that Paracelsus or\r\nHelmont might conceivably know of agents of which he was ignorant.\r\n\r\nBoerhaave unquestionably spent much time in the study of alchemical\r\nworks, particularly those of Paracelsus and Helmont, which he\r\nrepeatedly read. The _Philosophical Transactions_ of the Royal Society\r\ncontain the results of a laborious but fruitless investigation by\r\nhim on quicksilver, which he undertook in the hope of discovering\r\nthe seminal or engendering matter which, on the old theory of the\r\ngeneration of metals, was supposed to be contained in mercury.\r\nBut although, as he relates, he tortured it by “conquassation,\r\ntrituration, digestion, and by distillation, either alone or\r\namalgamated with lead, tin, or gold, repeating this operation to 511\r\nor even to 877 distillations,” the mercury appeared only “rather more\r\nbright and liquid, without any other variation in its form or virtues,\r\nand acquired very little, if any, increase of its specific gravity.”\r\n\r\n=Stephen Hales= (1677–1761), an ingenious divine—he held the perpetual\r\ncuracy of Teddington, and lived practically the greater part of his\r\nlife there—distinguished as a physiologist and inventor, occupied\r\nhimself in chemical pursuits, and made a number of observations on the\r\nproduction of gaseous substances. His results were communicated to the\r\nRoyal Society and subsequently republished, in a collected form, under\r\nthe title of _Statical Essays_. In these experiments he used methods\r\nvery similar in principle to those subsequently employed by Priestley.\r\nIt is evident from his description of his experiments that he must\r\nhave prepared a considerable number of gaseous substances—hydrogen,\r\ncarbonic acid, carbonic oxide, sulphur dioxide, marsh gas, etc.—but he\r\nseems to have made no systematic attempt to study their properties,\r\nas he considered that they were simply air, modified or “tinctured”\r\nby the presence of substances which he regarded as more or less\r\nfortuitous. Prior to the time of Black all forms of gaseous substance\r\nwere regarded as substantially identical—in fact, as being _air_,\r\nas understood by the Ancients—a simple elementary substance. It was\r\nBlack’s study of carbonic acid which first clearly established that\r\nthere were essentially distinct varieties of gaseous matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nPHLOGISTONISM\r\n\r\n\r\nEven before the appearance of _The Sceptical Chemist_ there was a\r\ngrowing conviction that the old hypotheses as to the essential nature\r\nof matter were inadequate and misleading. We have seen how the four\r\n“elements” of the Peripatetics had become merged into the _tria\r\nprima_—the “salt,” “sulphur,” and “mercury”—of the Paracelsians. As\r\nthe phenomena of chemical action became better known, the latter\r\niatro-chemists—or, rather, that section of them which recognised that\r\nchemistry had wider aims than to minister merely to medicine—felt that\r\nthe conception of the _tria prima_, as understood by Paracelsus and\r\nhis followers, was incapable of being generalised into a theory of\r\nchemistry. Becher, while clinging to the conception of three primordial\r\nsubstances as making up all forms of matter, changed the qualities\r\nhitherto associated with them. According to the new theory, all matter\r\nwas composed of a mercurial, a vitreous, and a combustible substance\r\nor principle, in varying proportions, depending upon the nature of the\r\nparticular form of matter. When a body was burnt or a metal calcined,\r\nthe combustible substance—the _terra pinguis_ of Becher—escaped.\r\n\r\nThis attempt to connect the phenomena of combustion and calcination\r\nwith the general phenomena of chemistry was still further developed\r\nby Stahl, and was eventually extended into a comprehensive theory of\r\nchemistry, which was fairly satisfactory so long as no effort was made\r\nto test its sufficiency by an appeal to the balance.\r\n\r\n=George Ernest Stahl=, who developed Becher’s notion into the theory of\r\n_phlogiston_ (φλογιοτός—burnt), and thereby created a generalisation\r\nwhich first made chemistry a science, was born at Anspach in 1660,\r\nbecame Professor of Medicine and Chemistry at Halle in 1693, physician\r\nto the King of Prussia in 1716, and died in Berlin in 1734.\r\n\r\nStahl contributed little or nothing to practical chemistry; and no new\r\nfact or discovery is associated with his name. His service to science\r\nconsists in the temporary success he achieved in grouping chemical\r\nphenomena, and in explaining them consistently by a comprehensive\r\nhypothesis.\r\n\r\nThe theory of phlogiston was originally broached as a theory of\r\ncombustion. According to this theory, bodies such as coal, charcoal,\r\nwood, oil, fat, etc., burn because they contain a combustible\r\nprinciple, which was assumed to be a material substance and uniform\r\nin character. This substance was known as phlogiston. All combustible\r\nbodies were to be regarded, therefore, as compounds, one of their\r\nconstituents being phlogiston: their different natures depended\r\npartly upon the proportion of phlogiston they contain, and partly\r\nupon the nature and amount of their other constituents. A body, when\r\nburning, was parting with its phlogiston; and all the phenomena of\r\ncombustion—the flame, heat, and light—were caused by the violence\r\nof the expulsion of that substance. Certain metals—as, for example,\r\nzinc—could be caused to burn, and thereby to yield earthy substances,\r\nsometimes white in colour, at other times variously coloured. These\r\nearthy substances were called _calces_, from their general resemblance\r\nto lime. Other metals, like lead and mercury, did not appear to burn;\r\nbut on heating them they gradually lost their metallic appearance, and\r\nbecame converted into calces. This operation was known as calcination.\r\nIn the act of burning or of calcination phlogiston was expelled. Hence\r\nmetals were essentially compound: they consisted of phlogiston and a\r\ncalx, the nature of which determined the character of the metal. By\r\nadding phlogiston to a calx the metal was regenerated. Thus, on heating\r\nthe calx of zinc or of lead with coal, or charcoal, or wood, metallic\r\nzinc or lead was again formed. When a candle burns, its phlogiston\r\nis transferred to the air; if burned in a limited supply of air,\r\ncombustion ceases, because the air becomes saturated with phlogiston.\r\n\r\nRespiration is a kind of combustion whereby the temperature of the body\r\nis maintained. It consists simply in the transference of the phlogiston\r\nof the body to the air. If we attempt to breathe in a confined\r\nspace, the air becomes eventually saturated with the phlogiston, and\r\nrespiration stops. The various manifestations of chemical action, in\r\nlike manner, were attributed to this passing to and fro of phlogiston.\r\nThe colour of a substance is connected with the amount of phlogiston\r\nit contains. Thus, when lead is heated, it yields a yellow substance\r\n(litharge); when still further heated, it yields a red substance (red\r\nlead). These differences in colour were supposed to depend upon the\r\nvarying amount of phlogiston expelled.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of phlogiston was embraced by nearly all Stahl’s German\r\ncontemporaries, notably by Marggraf, Neumann, Eller, and Pott. It\r\nspread into Sweden, and was accepted by Bergman and Scheele; into\r\nFrance, where it was taught by Duhamel, Rouelle, and Macquer; and into\r\nGreat Britain, where its most influential supporters were Priestley and\r\nCavendish. It continued to be the orthodox faith until the last quarter\r\nof the eighteenth century, when, after the discovery of oxygen, it was\r\noverturned by Lavoisier.\r\n\r\nDuring the sway of phlogiston chemistry made many notable advances—not\r\nby its aid, but rather in spite of it. As a matter of fact, until\r\nthe time of Lavoisier few, if any, investigations were made with the\r\nexpress intention of testing it, or of establishing its sufficiency.\r\nWhen new phenomena were observed the attempt was no doubt made to\r\nexplain them by its aid, frequently with no satisfactory result.\r\nIndeed, even in the time of Stahl, facts were known which it was\r\ndifficult or impossible to reconcile with his doctrine; but these\r\nwere either ignored, or their true import explained away. Although,\r\ntherefore, these advances were in no way connected with phlogiston,\r\nit will be convenient to deal with the more important of them now,\r\ninasmuch as they were made during the phlogistic period.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of Marggraf, Stahl’s German contemporaries\r\ncontributed few facts of first-rate importance to chemistry. =Pott=,\r\nwho was born at Halberstadt in 1692 and become Professor of Chemistry\r\nin Berlin in 1737, is chiefly remembered by his work on porcelain,\r\nthe chemical nature and mode of origin of which he first elucidated.\r\n=Marggraf=, born in Berlin in 1709, was one of the best analysts of his\r\nage. He first clearly distinguished between lime and alumina, and was\r\none of the earliest to point out that the vegetable alkali (potash)\r\ndiffered from the mineral alkali (soda). He also showed that gypsum,\r\nheavy spar, and potassium sulphate were analogous in composition.\r\nHe clearly indicated the relation of phosphoric acid to phosphorus,\r\ndescribed a number of methods of preparing that acid, and explained the\r\norigin of the phosphoric acid in urine.\r\n\r\nOf the Swedish chemists of that period, the most notable was Scheele.\r\n\r\n=Carl Wilhelm Scheele= was born in 1742 at Stralsund. When fourteen\r\nyears of age he was apprenticed to an apothecary at Gothenburg, and\r\nbegan the study of experimental chemistry, which he continued to\r\nprosecute as an apothecary at Malmö, Stockholm, Upsala, and eventually\r\nat Köping on Lake Malar, where he died in 1786, in the forty-third year\r\nof his age. During the comparatively short period of his scientific\r\nactivity Scheele made himself the greatest chemical discoverer of his\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CARL WILHELM SCHEELE.\r\n\r\nFrom the statue by Börjeson at Stockholm.]\r\n\r\nHe first isolated chlorine, and determined the individuality of\r\nmanganese and baryta. He was an independent discoverer of oxygen,\r\nammonia, and hydrogen chloride. He discovered also hydrofluoric,\r\nnitro-sulphonic, molybdic, tungstic, and arsenic, among the inorganic\r\nacids; and lactic, gallic, pyrogallic, oxalic, citric, tartaric, malic,\r\nmucic, and uric acids among the organic acids. He isolated glycerine\r\nand milk-sugar; determined the nature of microcosmic salt, borax, and\r\nPrussian blue, and prepared hydrocyanic acid. He demonstrated that\r\ngraphite is a form of carbon. He discovered the chemical nature of\r\nsulphuretted hydrogen, arsenuretted hydrogen, and the green arsenical\r\npigment known by his name. He invented new processes for preparing\r\nether, powder of algaroth, phosphorus, calomel, and _magnesia alba_.\r\nHe first prepared ferrous ammonium sulphate, showed how iron may be\r\nanalytically separated from manganese; and described the method of\r\nbreaking up mineral silicates by fusion with alkaline carbonates.\r\nScheele’s contributions to chemical theory were slight and unimportant,\r\nbut as a discoverer he stands pre-eminent.\r\n\r\nOf the French phlogistians we have space only to mention Duhamel and\r\nMacquer.\r\n\r\n=Henry Louis Duhamel du Monceau= was born at Paris in 1700. He was one\r\nof the earliest to make experiments on ossification, and one of the\r\nfirst to detect the difference between potash and soda.\r\n\r\n=Peter Joseph Macquer= was born in 1718 at Paris. He investigated\r\nthe nature of Prussian blue (discovered by Diesbach, of Berlin, in\r\n1710), worked on platinum, wrote one of the best text-books of his\r\ntime, published a dictionary of chemistry, and was an authority of the\r\nchemistry of dyeing.\r\n\r\nIn addition to those already mentioned, the most notable names as\r\nworkers in chemistry in Great Britain during the eighteenth century are\r\nBlack, Priestley, and Cavendish.\r\n\r\n=Joseph Black= was born in 1728 at Bordeaux, where his father was\r\nengaged in the wine trade. A student of the University of Glasgow, he\r\nbecame its Professor of Chemistry in 1756. In 1766 he was transferred\r\nto the Chemical Chair of the University of Edinburgh, and died in 1799.\r\nBlack published only three papers, the most important of which is\r\nentitled _Experiments upon Magnesia Alba, Quicklime, and Other Alkaline\r\nSubstances_. He proved that magnesia is a peculiar earth differing\r\nin properties from lime. Lime is a pure earth, while limestone is\r\ncarbonate of lime. He showed that magnesia will also combine with\r\ncarbonic acid, and he explained that the difference between the mild\r\nand caustic alkalis is that the former contain carbonic acid, whereas\r\nthe latter do not. He also explained how lime is able to convert the\r\nmild alkalis into caustic alkalis. Simple and well known as these\r\nfacts are to-day, their discovery in 1755 excited great interest, and\r\nmarked an epoch in the history of chemistry. Black’s name is associated\r\nwith the discovery of latent and specific heat, and he made the first\r\ndeterminations of the amount of heat required to convert ice into water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOSEPH PRIESTLEY.\r\n\r\nFrom a mezzotint after Fuseli in the possession of the Royal Society.]\r\n\r\n=Joseph Priestley=, the son of a clothdresser, was born in 1733 at\r\nFieldhead, near Leeds. When seven years of age, on the death of his\r\nmother, he was taken charge of by his aunt, and was educated for\r\nthe Nonconformist ministry, eventually becoming a Unitarian. He was\r\nfirst attracted to science by the study of electricity, of which he\r\ncompiled a history. At Leeds, where he had charge of the Mill Hill\r\ncongregation, he turned his attention to chemistry, mainly from the\r\ncircumstance that he lived near a brewery and had the opportunity\r\nof procuring large quantities of carbonic acid, the properties of\r\nwhich he carefully studied. He abandoned the ministry for a time to\r\nbecome librarian and literary companion to Lord Shelburne, with whom\r\nhe remained seven years. During this time he industriously pursued\r\nchemical inquiry, and discovered a large number of æriform bodies—viz.,\r\nnitric oxide, hydrogen chloride, sulphur dioxide, silicon fluoride,\r\nammonia, nitrous oxide, and, most important of all from the point of\r\nview of chemical theory, oxygen gas. Priestley’s work gave a remarkable\r\nimpetus to the study of pneumatic chemistry. It exercised great\r\ninfluence on the extension of chemical science, and—in other hands\r\nthan his—on the development of chemical theory. The most important of\r\nhis contributions to science are contained in his _Experiments and\r\nObservations on Different Kinds of Air_. This work not only gives an\r\naccount of the methods by which he isolated the gases he discovered,\r\nbut describes a great number of incidental observations, such as the\r\naction of vegetation on respired air, showing that the green parts of\r\nplants are able in sunlight to decompose carbonic acid and to restore\r\noxygen to the atmosphere. He was, in fact, one of the earliest to trace\r\nthe specific action of animals and plants on atmospheric air, and to\r\nshow how these specific actions maintained its purity and constancy of\r\ncomposition. He initiated the art of eudiometry (gas analysis), and\r\nwas the first to establish that the air is not a simple substance,\r\nas imagined by the ancients. Priestley is to be credited with the\r\ninvention of _soda-water_, which he prepared as a remedy for scurvy;\r\nand his name is connected with the so-called _pneumatic trough_—a\r\nsimple enough piece of apparatus, but one which proved to be of the\r\ngreatest service to him in his inquiries.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Lord Shelburne, Priestley removed to Birmingham and\r\nresumed his ministry. His religious and political opinions made him\r\nobnoxious to the Church and State party; and during the riots of\r\n1791 his house was wrecked, his books and apparatus destroyed, and\r\nhis life endangered. Eventually he emigrated to America, and settled\r\nat Northumberland, where he died on February 6th, 1804, in the\r\nseventy-first year of his age.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: From a drawing by Alexander in the Print Room of the\r\nBritish Museum.]\r\n\r\n=Henry Cavendish= was born at Nice in 1731, and died in London in 1810.\r\nHe was a natural philosopher in the widest sense of that term, and\r\noccupied himself in turn with nearly every branch of physical science.\r\nHe was a capable astronomer and an excellent mathematician, and he\r\nwas one of the earliest to work on the subject of specific heat, and\r\nto improve the thermometer and the methods of making thermometric\r\nobservations. He also determined the mean density of the earth. He made\r\naccurate observations on the properties of carbonic acid and hydrogen,\r\ngreatly improved the methods of eudiometry, and first established\r\nthe practical uniformity of the composition of atmospheric air. His\r\ngreatest discovery, however, was his determination of _the composition\r\nof water_. He was the first to prove that water is not a simple or\r\nelementary substance, as supposed by the ancients, but is a compound of\r\nhydrogen and oxygen. In certain of his trials he found that the water\r\nformed by the union of oxygen and hydrogen was acid to the taste; and\r\nthe search for the cause of this acidity led him to the discovery of\r\nthe _composition of nitric acid_. He was the first to make a fairly\r\naccurate analysis of a natural water, and to explain what is known as\r\nthe _hardness of water_.\r\n\r\nPhlogistonism may be said to have dominated chemistry during\r\nthree-fourths of the eighteenth century. Although radically false\r\nas a conception and of little use in the true interpretation of\r\nchemical phenomena, it cannot be said to have actually retarded the\r\npursuit of chemistry. Men went on working and accumulating chemical\r\nfacts uninspired and, for the most part, uninfluenced by it. Even\r\nPriestley, perhaps one of the most conservative of the followers of\r\nStahl, regarded his dogma with a complacent tolerance; and as its\r\ninconsistencies became apparent he was more than once on the point\r\nof renouncing it. Of one thing he was quite convinced, and that was\r\nthat Stahl had greatly erred in his conception of the real nature of\r\nphlogiston. Perhaps the most signal disservice which phlogiston did to\r\nchemistry was to delay the general recognition of Boyle’s views of the\r\nnature of the elements. The alchemists, it will be remembered, regarded\r\nthe metals as essentially compound. Boyle was disposed to believe that\r\nthey were simple. Becher and Stahl and their followers, until the last\r\nquarter of the eighteenth century, also regarded them as compounds,\r\nphlogiston being one of their constituents. On the other hand, what\r\nwe now know to be compounds—such as the calces, the acids, and water\r\nitself—were held by the phlogistians to be simple substances.\r\n\r\nThe discovery, in 1774, of oxygen—the dephlogisticated air of\r\nPriestley—and the recognition of the part it plays in the phenomena\r\nwhich phlogiston was invoked to explain, mark the termination of one\r\nera in chemical history and the beginning of another. Before entering\r\nupon an account of the new era it is desirable to take stock of the\r\nactual condition of chemical knowledge at the end of the phlogistic\r\nperiod, and to show what advances had been made in pure and applied\r\nchemistry during that time.\r\n\r\nDuring the eighteenth century greater insight was gained into the\r\noperations of the form of energy with which chemistry is mainly\r\nconcerned, and views concerning chemical affinity and its causes\r\nbegan to assume more definite shape, chiefly owing to the labours of\r\nBoerhaave, Bergman, Geoffroy, and Rouelle. It was clearly recognised\r\nthat the large group of substances comprised under the term “salts”\r\nwere compound, and made up of two contrasted and, in a sense,\r\nantagonistic constituents, classed generically as acids and bases.\r\n\r\nOn the practical side chemistry made considerable progress. Analysis—a\r\nterm originally applied by Boyle—greatly advanced. It was, of course,\r\nmainly qualitative; but, thanks to the labours of Boyle, Hoffmann,\r\nMarggraf, Scheele, Bergman, Gahn, and Cronstedt, certain reactions\r\nand reagents came to be systematically applied to the recognition of\r\nchemical substances, and the precision with which these reagents were\r\nused led to the detection of hitherto unknown elements. The beginnings\r\nof a quantitative analysis were made even before the time of Boyle,\r\nbut its principles were greatly developed by him, and were further\r\nextended by Homberg, Marggraf, and Bergman. Marggraf accurately\r\ndetermined the amount of silver chloride formed by adding common salt\r\nto a solution of a known weight of silver, and Bergman first pointed\r\nout that estimations of substances might be conveniently made by\r\nweighing them in the form of suitably prepared compounds, which, it\r\nwas implicitly assumed, were of uniform and constant composition. The\r\nfoundations of an accurate system of gaseous analysis were made by\r\nCavendish; and various forms of physical apparatus were applied to the\r\nservice of chemistry.\r\n\r\nTo the elements which were known prior to Boyle’s time, although not\r\nrecognised as such, there were added phosphorus (Brand, 1669), nitrogen\r\n(Rutherford), chlorine (Scheele, 1774), manganese (Gahn, 1774), cobalt\r\n(Brandt, 1742), nickel (Cronstedt, 1750), and platinum (Watson, 1750).\r\nBaryta was discovered by Scheele, and strontia by Crawford. Phosphoric\r\nacid was discovered by Boyle, and its true nature determined by\r\nMarggraf; Cavendish first made known the composition of nitric acid.\r\nAs already stated, Scheele first isolated molybdic and tungstic acids\r\nand determined the existence of a number of the organic acids (p. 75).\r\nOther discoveries—such as the true nature of limestone and _magnesia\r\nalba_ and their relations respectively to lime and magnesia by Black,\r\nthe many gaseous substances by Priestley, and the compound nature of\r\nwater by Cavendish—have already been referred to.\r\n\r\nTechnical chemistry also greatly developed during the eighteenth\r\ncentury, thanks to the efforts of Gahn, Marggraf, Duhamel, Reaumur,\r\nMacquer, Kunkel, and Hellot; and many important industrial\r\nprocesses—such as the manufacture of sulphuric acid by Ward of\r\nRichmond, and subsequently by Roebuck at Birmingham, and the Leblanc\r\nprocess of conversion of common salt into alkali—had their origin\r\nduring this period.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nLAVOISIER AND LA RÉVOLUTION CHIMIQUE\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have seen how chemistry made a new departure during the political\r\nupheaval which occurred in this country about the middle of the\r\nseventeenth century. It acquired a new impetus and took a fresh course\r\nduring the political cataclysm which overwhelmed France and alarmed\r\nEurope towards the close of the eighteenth century. The instigator\r\nand leader of this second revolution in chemistry was Lavoisier, one\r\nof the most distinguished men of his age, and himself a victim of the\r\npolitical fury of his own people.\r\n\r\n=Antoine-Laurent Lavoisier= was born in Paris in 1743. At the Jardin\r\ndu Roi he came under the influence of Rouelle, one of the best\r\nteachers of his time, who eventually shaped his career as a chemist.\r\nIn 1765 he sent to the Academy his first paper on gypsum, which is\r\nnoteworthy as giving for the first time the true explanation of the\r\n“setting” of plaster of Paris, and the reason why overburnt gypsum\r\nwill not rehydrate. Three years later he became a member of the\r\n_Ferme-général_—a company of financiers to whom the State conceded, for\r\na fixed annual sum, the right of collecting the indirect taxes of the\r\ncountry. It was this connection that brought Lavoisier to the scaffold\r\nduring the revolution of 1794. Like Stahl, Lavoisier discovered no new\r\nsubstance; but, also like Stahl, he created a new epoch by destroying\r\nthe philosophical system which Stahl had established.\r\n\r\nIt is commonly stated that the exception is a proof of the rule. The\r\nhistory of science can show many instances whereby the rule has been\r\ndemolished by the exception. Little facts have killed big theories,\r\neven as a pebble has slain a giant. During the reign of phlogiston\r\na few of such facts were not unknown—at least to some of the better\r\ninformed of Stahl’s followers.\r\n\r\nSome of the alchemists had discovered that a metal gained, not lost,\r\nweight by calcination. This was known as far back as the sixteenth\r\ncentury. It had been pointed out by Cardan and by Libavius. Sulzbach\r\nshowed that such was the case with mercury. Boyle proved it in the case\r\nof tin, and Rey in that of lead. Moreover, as knowledge increased it\r\nbecame certain that Stahl’s original conception of the principle of\r\ncombustion as a ponderable substance—he imagined, with Becher, that it\r\nwas of the nature of an earth—was not tenable. The later phlogistians\r\nwere disposed to regard it as probably identical with hydrogen. But\r\neven hydrogen has weight, and facts seemed to require that phlogiston,\r\nif it existed at all, should be devoid of weight.\r\n\r\nTowards the latter half of the eighteenth century clearer views\r\nbegan to be held concerning the relations of atmospheric air to the\r\nphenomena of combustion and of calcination; many half-forgotten facts\r\nrelating to these phenomena were recalled, and the inconsistencies\r\nand insufficiency of phlogiston as a dogma became gradually manifest.\r\nThree cardinal facts conspired to bring about its overthrow—the\r\nisolation of oxygen by Priestley; the recognition by him of the nature\r\nof atmospheric air, and of the fact that one of its constituents\r\nis oxygen; and, lastly, the discovery by Cavendish that water is a\r\ncompound, and that its constituents are oxygen and hydrogen. The\r\nsignificance of these facts was first clearly grasped by Lavoisier, and\r\nto him is due the credit of their true interpretation. By reasoning\r\nand experiment he proved conclusively that all ordinary phenomena of\r\nburning are so many instances of the combination of the oxygen of the\r\nair with the combustible substance; that calcination is a process of\r\ncombination of the oxygen in the air with the metal, which thereby\r\nincreases in weight by the amount of oxygen combined. Water—no longer a\r\nsimple substance—is formed by the union, weight for weight, of oxygen\r\nand hydrogen. Lavoisier’s reasoning was so sound and his experimental\r\nevidence so complete that his views gradually gained acceptance in\r\nFrance. The phlogiston myth was thus exploded. Inspired by Lavoisier,\r\na small band of French chemists—Berthollet, Fourcroy, Guyton de\r\nMorveau—thereupon set to work to remodel the system of chemistry\r\nand to recast its nomenclature so as to eliminate all reference\r\nto phlogiston. The very names “oxygen,” “hydrogen,” “nitrogen,”\r\ncorresponding respectively to the “dephlogisticated air,” “phlogiston,”\r\nand “phlogisticated air” of Priestley, were coined by the new French\r\nschool. For a time _le principe oxygine_ was regarded by this school\r\nin much the same relation as phlogiston was regarded by Stahl and his\r\nfollowers. The one fetich was exchanged for the other. The combustible\r\nprinciple—phlogiston—was renounced for the acidifying principle—oxygen.\r\nThe new chemistry for a time centred itself round oxygen, just as\r\nthe old chemistry had centred itself round phlogiston. The views of\r\nthe French school met with no immediate acceptance in Germany, the\r\nhome of phlogistonism, or in Sweden or England, possibly owing, to\r\nsome extent, to national prejudices. The spirit of revolution, even\r\nalthough it might be an intellectual revolution, had not extended to\r\nthese countries. Priestley, Cavendish, and Scheele could not be induced\r\nto accept the new doctrine. It was, however, accepted by Black, and\r\nits principles taught by him in Edinburgh; and before the end of the\r\ncentury it had practically supplanted phlogistonism in this country.\r\nSome of those who, like Kirwan, had energetically opposed the new\r\ntheory ended by enthusiastically embracing it. Its introduction into\r\nGermany was mainly due to the influence of Klaproth.\r\n\r\nWe further owe to Lavoisier the recognition of the principle which lies\r\nat the basis of chemical science—the principle of the conservation of\r\nmatter. Lavoisier was not the first to introduce the use of the balance\r\ninto chemistry: quantitative chemistry did not actually originate with\r\nhim. Boyle, Black, and Cavendish, as a matter of fact, preceded him in\r\nrecognising the importance of studying the quantitative relations of\r\nsubstances. Nevertheless, no one before him so clearly foreshadowed the\r\ndoctrine of the indestructibility of matter, and it was mainly through\r\nhis teaching that the balance came to be recognised as indispensable to\r\nthe pursuit of chemistry. Before his untimely death he had succeeded\r\nin impressing upon the science the main features which at present\r\ncharacterise it.\r\n\r\nLavoisier was one of the most distinguished men of his age, and his\r\nmerits as a philosopher were recognised throughout Europe. Indeed,\r\nit is not too much to say that at the time of his death he was the\r\ndominant figure in the chemical world of the eighteenth century.\r\nIn addition to his position as a member of the _Ferme-général_ he\r\nwas made by Turgot a commissioner of the _Régie des Poudres_; and\r\nin this capacity he effected improvements in the manufacture and\r\nrefining of saltpetre, and greatly increased the ballistic properties\r\nof gunpowder. He became Secretary of the Committee of Agriculture,\r\nand drew up reports on the cultivation of flax, of the potato, and\r\non the liming of wheat; he prepared a scheme for the establishment\r\nof experimental farms, and for the collection and distribution of\r\nagricultural implements. He introduced the cultivation of the beet root\r\nin the Blesois, and improved the breed of sheep by the importation of\r\nrams and ewes from Spain. He was successively member of the Assembly\r\nof the Orléanais, _Député suppléant_ of the States-General, and of\r\nthe Commune of Paris. In 1791 he was named Secretary and Treasurer of\r\nthe famous Commission of Weights and Measures, out of which grew the\r\ninternational system, based theoretically on a natural unit, known as\r\nthe metric system, and now adopted by most civilised countries in the\r\nworld. He was not only the administrative officer of the Commission:\r\nhe contributed to the nomenclature of the system, and directed the\r\ndetermination of the physical constants on which the measurements\r\nrested, and especially the determination of the weight of the unit\r\nvolume of water on which the value of the standard of mass was based.\r\nLastly he was Treasurer of the French Academy until its suppression in\r\n1793 by the Convention, which shortly afterwards ordered the arrest\r\nof Lavoisier and others of the Fermiers-généraux—twenty-eight in all.\r\nThey were sentenced to be executed within twenty-four hours, and their\r\nproperty confiscated. Coffinhal, who pronounced their doom, declared:\r\n“_La republique n’a pas besoin de savants_.” Thus in the fifty-first\r\nyear of his age, perished the creator of modern chemistry—a victim to\r\nthe senseless, sanguinary fury of the “Friends of the People.” His\r\nrectitude, his public services, the purity of his private life, the\r\nsplendour of his scientific achievements—all were unheeded. As Lagrange\r\nsaid to Delambre: “It required but a moment to strike off this head; a\r\nhundred years may not suffice to reproduce such another.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LAVOISIER AND BERTHOLLET\r\n\r\nin the Laboratory of the Sorbonne, Paris.]\r\n\r\nOf the men who were associated with Lavoisier in the creation of what\r\nwas known at the period as the antiphlogistic chemistry, the most\r\neminent was Berthollet.\r\n\r\n=Claude-Louis Berthollet= was born in Savoy in 1748, and, after a\r\nmedical education, became physician to the Duke of Orleans. Devoting\r\nhimself to chemistry, in 1781 he was made a member of the Academy,\r\nand he became Government Commissary and Director of the Gobelins,\r\nthe chief tinctorial establishment of France. Although in the main\r\nin agreement with Lavoisier, he never wholly subscribed to the idea\r\nthat all acids contained oxygen. He discovered the bleaching power of\r\nchlorine, prepared potassium chlorate, and investigated prussic acid\r\nand fulminating silver.\r\n\r\nIn his _Statique Chimique_, published in 1803, he combated the\r\npartial and imperfect views of Bergman and Geoffroy with regard to\r\nthe operation of chemical affinity, and showed that the direction\r\nof a chemical change is modified by the relative proportion of the\r\nreacting substances and the physical conditions—temperature, pressure,\r\netc.—under which the change is effected. He was one of the first to\r\ndraw attention to a class of phenomena known as reversible reactions,\r\nand gave a number of instances of their occurrence. Berthollet\r\npushed his conclusions so far that he was led to doubt that chemical\r\ncombination took place in fixed and definite proportions; and his views\r\ngave rise to a memorable controversy between him and Proust, in which\r\nthe latter eventually triumphed.\r\n\r\nBerthollet enjoyed a great reputation in his time, and played a\r\nconsiderable part in the political history of his country. It was\r\nlargely to his zeal, sagacity, and skill in developing her internal\r\nresources at a critical period when she was hemmed round by foreign\r\ntroops and her ports blockaded by British ships, that France was\r\nsaved from conquest. His life was more than once in jeopardy when\r\nFrance was governed by a Committee of Public Safety; but his honesty,\r\nsincerity, and courage even impressed Robespierre, and he escaped the\r\nperils of the Great Terror. He was an intimate friend of Napoleon,\r\nand accompanied him to Egypt as a member of the Institute. He died at\r\nArcueil in 1822.\r\n\r\nDavy, who visited him at his country house in 1813, says of him:—\r\n\r\n  Berthollet was a most amiable man; when the friend of Napoleon,\r\n  even, always good, conciliatory, and modest, frank and candid.\r\n  He had no airs, and many graces. In every way below La Place\r\n  in intellectual powers, he appeared superior to him in moral\r\n  qualities. Berthollet had no appearance of a man of genius; but one\r\n  could not look on La Place’s physiognomy without being convinced\r\n  that he was a very extraordinary man.\r\n\r\nOther notable men of this period were Fourcroy, Vauquelin, Klaproth,\r\nand Proust.\r\n\r\n=Antoine-François Fourcroy=, the son of a pharmacist, was born at Paris\r\nin 1755, and started his career as a dramatic author. On the advice\r\nof Vicq d’Azir, the anatomist, he turned to medicine, and in 1784, by\r\nthe influence of Buffon, obtained the chair of Chemistry at the Jardin\r\ndu Roi, in succession to Macquer. He was an excellent teacher—clear,\r\norderly, and methodical. He had, indeed, a talent for oratory. This he\r\nassiduously cultivated, and became one of the most popular lecturers of\r\nhis time in France. Ambitious and time-serving, he became embroiled in\r\nthe turbulent politics of the period, and, after a chequered career,\r\ndied, embittered and disappointed, in the fifty-fourth year of his\r\nage. His chief services to science consisted in his works, _Système\r\ndes Connaissances Chimiques_ and _Philosophie Chimique_. These, no\r\nless than his public lectures, did much to popularise the doctrines of\r\nLavoisier among his countrymen.\r\n\r\n=Louis Nicolas Vauquelin=, the son of a Norman peasant, was born in\r\n1763, and while a boy became assistant to an apothecary in Rouen. In\r\n1780 he came to Paris, and entered Fourcroy’s laboratory. Much of the\r\nexperimental work published in Fourcroy’s name was actually done by\r\nVauquelin. He became a member of the Academy in 1791, Professor of\r\nChemistry at the Mining School, Assayer to the Mint, and subsequently\r\nProfessor of Chemistry at the Jardin des Plantes. On Fourcroy’s\r\ndeath he was made Professor of Chemistry of the Medical Faculty of\r\nParis. Vauquelin was no theorist; he was, however, an excellent\r\npractical chemist, and one of the best analysts of the period. He\r\nmade a large number of mineral analyses, more particularly for Hauy,\r\nthe crystallographer. He discovered the element _chromium_ in the\r\nso-called red-lead ore (lead chromate) from Siberia. He also first made\r\nknown the existence of _glucinum_ in beryl. He described a method of\r\nseparating the platinum metals, and worked upon _iridium_ and _osmium_.\r\nHe investigated the _hyposulphites_, _cyanates_, and _malates_. He\r\ndiscovered the presence of _benzoic acid_ in the urine of animals; with\r\nRobiqet, he first isolated _asparagin_; with Buniva, _allantoic acid_;\r\nand with Bouillon de la Grange, _camphoric acid_.\r\n\r\nVauquelin lived wholly for science, and had no other interests\r\nthan in his laboratory. He was pensioned in 1822, and died at his\r\nbirthplace—St. André d’Héberlot—in the sixty-sixth year of his age.\r\n\r\n=Martin Heinrich Klaproth=, born in 1743 at Wernigerode, in the\r\nHartz, began life, like Vauquelin, as an apothecary’s apprentice at\r\nQuedlinburg. Thence he went to Hanover, and ultimately to Berlin,\r\nwhere he studied under Pott and Marggraf and entered the pharmacy of\r\nValentine Rose, father of Heinrich Rose, the distinguished chemist,\r\nand Gustav Rose, the mineralogist. In 1788 he became a member of the\r\nBerlin Academy, and, on the creation of the Berlin University in 1809,\r\nwas made Professor of Chemistry. As already stated, he was the first\r\nchemist of eminence in Germany to adopt the antiphlogistic theory. He\r\nwas distinguished as an analyst. He discovered _tellurium_, analysed\r\n_pitchblende_ and _uranit_, and first made known the existence of\r\n_uranium_, _zirconium_, and _cerium_, which he termed “ochroita.” He\r\nanalysed _corundum_, and was an independent discoverer of _titanium_\r\nand _glucinum_, termed by him _beryllium_. He made a large number of\r\nanalyses of minerals, such as leucite, chrysoberyl, hyacinth, granite,\r\nolivin, wolfram, malachite, pyromorphite, etc. He continued actively at\r\nwork until his death, in the seventy-fourth year of his age.\r\n\r\nAnalytical chemistry is under great obligations to Klaproth. He\r\nestablished a standard of accuracy never before approached; and much\r\nof his analytical work, both as regards processes and results, is of\r\npermanent value.\r\n\r\n=Joseph Louis Proust=, the son of a pharmacist was born at Angers in\r\n1761. He received his early training in chemistry from his father,\r\nand, after studying under Rouelle in Paris, obtained an appointment\r\nat the Salpetrière. Proust has the credit of being the first chemist\r\nto make a balloon ascent—in a Montgolfier balloon with Pilatre de\r\nRozier. On the invitation of the King of Spain, he went to that\r\ncountry to superintend certain chemical manufacturing processes. He\r\nbecame Professor of Chemistry at the University of Salamanca, and\r\nsubsequently went to Madrid, where he was installed in a well-equipped\r\nlaboratory to enable him to examine the mineral riches of Spain. On\r\nthe breaking out of war his work was interrupted, and he was obliged\r\nto leave Madrid. His laboratory was completely destroyed, and his\r\nvaluable collection of apparatus and specimens dissipated. Through the\r\ngood offices of Berthollet, Proust was offered a considerable sum of\r\nmoney by Napoleon in order to induce him to turn his discovery of grape\r\nsugar to practical account. Proust was, however, too broken in health\r\nto undertake the work of a factory manager, and he retired to Mayence.\r\nOn the restoration of the Monarchy he was made a member of the French\r\nAcademy, his honorarium as an Academician being augmented by a pension\r\nfrom Louis XVIII. He died in 1826, while on a visit to Angers, his\r\nnative place.\r\n\r\nProust is the discoverer of what is now styled “the law of constant\r\nproportion,” which states that the same body is invariably composed\r\nof the same elements, united in the same proportion. He was a skilful\r\nanalyst, and made numerous analyses of minerals; and he was one of the\r\nearliest to undertake a systematic study of metallic salts of organic\r\nacids.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHE ATOMIC THEORY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe opening years of the nineteenth century were made memorable by the\r\npromulgation of the atomic theory by John Dalton. The enunciation of\r\nthis theory, which affords a simple and adequate explanation of the\r\nfundamental laws of chemical combination, marks an epoch in the history\r\nof chemistry.\r\n\r\nIt may be desirable to trace, as briefly as possible, the successive\r\nsteps which led up to the generalisation which more than any other\r\nhas served to stamp chemistry as an exact science. That matter was\r\n_discrete_—that is, that it was not continuous, but was composed of\r\nultimate particles—was, as already stated, imagined by the ancients,\r\nand was part of the philosophy of Leukippus, Demokritus, and\r\nLeucretius. But this supposition, although favoured by Newton and other\r\nthinkers, had little or no scientific basis prior to the middle of the\r\neighteenth century. From that time onward a variety of chemical facts\r\ngradually accumulated, many of which at the time of their discovery\r\nhad no obvious connection with pre-existing facts. It was reserved for\r\nDalton to point out how an extension and more precise definition of\r\nthe old doctrine would suffice to connect and explain them.\r\n\r\nThe first germ of an atomic theory based on chemical fact may be traced\r\nin the observation of =Toburn Bergmann= (b. 1735, d. 1784), Professor\r\nof Chemistry at Upsala, that neutral solutions of certain metals in\r\ncontact with other metals gave a precipitate without the neutrality of\r\nthe solution being disturbed, and without gas being evolved. One metal\r\nhad simply replaced the other in solution. Bergmann thus incidentally\r\ndiscovered the fact of the chemical equivalence of metals. He was\r\nof opinion, however, that the phenomenon meant a transference of\r\nphlogiston from one metal to another, and that the process might be\r\nmade a mode of determining the relative amount of phlogiston in various\r\nmetals. Lavoisier extended Bergmann’s observations, and sought to show,\r\nin effect, that the process afforded a means of determining the amounts\r\nof the several metals which combined with one and the same quantity\r\nof oxygen. But neither Bergmann nor Lavoisier really grasped the idea\r\nof equivalence as we understand it to-day. It began to be appreciated\r\nas the result of the work of =Jeremiah Benjamin Richter= (b. 1762,\r\nd. 1807) and of =G. E. Fischer= on the mutual action of salts in\r\nsolutions, and on the determinations of the amounts of acid and bases\r\nwhich respectively combine with one another. Methods of measurement of\r\nthe proportions in which substances combine were grouped by Richter\r\nunder the term _Stochiometry_.\r\n\r\nHowever desirable it may be in the interests of history to indicate\r\nthe sequence of the surmises and facts which preceded the formulation\r\nof the atomic theory, it is very doubtful whether Dalton was, to any\r\nmaterial extent, influenced by them. A self-educated man of lowly\r\norigin, sturdily independent and highly original, he was accustomed\r\nto rely upon his own faculty of observation and experiment for his\r\nfacts, and upon his own intellectual powers and mental energy for their\r\ninterpretation.\r\n\r\n=John Dalton=, the son of a Quaker hand-loom weaver, was born at\r\nEaglesfield, in Cumberland, in 1766. While still a boy he took to\r\nschool-teaching, and acquired, in his leisure and by his own exertions,\r\na competent knowledge of mathematics and physical science. In 1793 he\r\nwas called to give instruction in mathematics, natural philosophy, and\r\nchemistry at the Manchester New College, the Nonconformist academy—now\r\nmoved from Warrington—in which Priestley had formerly lectured. Here\r\nhe remained six years, leaving the college to take up an independent\r\nposition as a private tutor, so as to enable him the more freely to\r\npursue his scientific inquiries. In 1800 he became Secretary of the\r\nPhilosophical Society of Manchester, and remained connected, as an\r\nofficial, with that institution until his death in 1844. The greater\r\nnumber of his scientific communications were published by that society.\r\nIn the outset of his scientific career he was attracted to meteorology;\r\nand it was probably its problems which led him in the first place to\r\nexperiment, and to speculate on the physical constitution of gases.\r\nIn the course of these observations he was led to the discovery\r\nof the law of thermal expansion of gases, with which his name is\r\nnow generally associated. His speculations concerning the physical\r\nconstitution of gaseous substances, arising from the contemplation of\r\ngaseous phenomena, led him to the conception that a gas is composed\r\nof particles that repel one another with a force decreasing as the\r\ndistance of their centres from each other; and it is probable that in\r\nthis manner he familiarised himself with the idea of the existence of\r\natoms. His first insight into the laws of the chemical combination of\r\nthese atoms seems to have originated from his discovery that, when\r\ntwo substances unite in different proportions, these proportions may\r\nbe expressed in simple multiples of whole numbers. Thus he found,\r\non examining the composition of marsh gas and of ethylene, both\r\nhydrocarbons, that for the same weight of hydrogen there was twice the\r\namount of carbon in ethylene that there was in marsh gas. He then\r\nexamined the oxides of nitrogen, and found a similar regularity to\r\nhold good in these compounds. Some time prior to the autumn of 1803\r\nDalton was led to the supposition that these regularities could be\r\nsatisfactorily explained by the assumption that matter is composed\r\nof atoms having sizes and weights differing with each substance, but\r\nof identical weight and size for any particular substance, and that\r\nchemical combination consists in the approximation of these atoms. This\r\nsimple hypothesis explained all the facts then known. It explained the\r\nconstancy in the chemical composition of substances, which may be said\r\nto have been established by Proust, and which is now formulated as the\r\nLaw of Constant Proportion—that the same body is invariably composed\r\nof the same elements, united in the same proportion. It explained also\r\nthe fact discovered by Dalton that, when an element unites with another\r\nin different proportions, the higher proportions are multiples of the\r\nlowest—now formulated as the Law of Multiple Proportion. It further\r\nexplained the fact, which may be said to have been foreshadowed by\r\nRichter, that when two bodies, A and B, separately combine with a third\r\nbody, C, the proportions of A and B which unite with C are measures or\r\nmultiples of the proportions in which A and B combine together. This\r\nis known as the Law of Reciprocal Proportion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JOHN DALTON.\r\n\r\nFrom a painting by B. R. Faulkner in the possession of the Royal\r\nSociety]\r\n\r\nDalton’s theory was first made generally known by Thomas Thomson, in\r\nthe third edition of his _System of Chemistry_, published in 1807, and\r\nwas employed by Thomson in his paper on “The Oxalates of Strontium,”\r\npublished the same year in the _Philosophical Transactions_. The first\r\nprinted account by Dalton himself is contained in Part I. of his _New\r\nSystem of Chemical Philosophy_, published in 1808, the substance of\r\nwhich had been previously given in a course of lectures at the Royal\r\nInstitution, London, and subsequently repeated in Edinburgh and Glasgow.\r\n\r\nThe statement of his theory is contained in chapter iii. of this work,\r\nunder the heading “Of Chemical Synthesis,” and is accompanied by a\r\nplate and explanation, of which a facsimile is given on pp. 130–1.\r\n\r\nThe facts upon which Dalton based his theory are incontrovertible; but\r\nDalton’s explanation of them was not universally accepted at the time\r\nhe gave it. Davy, who, of course, was familiar with the conception\r\nof atoms as part of the Newtonian philosophy, objected to the term\r\n“atomic weight” introduced by Dalton, and suggested the expression\r\n“combining proportion”; and Wollaston, for similar reasons, proposed\r\nthe term “equivalent,” as denoting the constant quantity with which\r\nbodies went in and out of combination. There is no doubt that the use\r\nof these terms retarded the general acceptance of Dalton’s doctrine,\r\nand, moreover, brought into the science a confusion which was not\r\nfinally dispelled, as we shall see, until during the second half of the\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ELEMENTS\r\n\r\n_Simple_\r\n\r\n_Binary_\r\n\r\n_Ternary_\r\n\r\n_Quaternary_\r\n\r\n_Quinquenary_ & _Sextenary_\r\n\r\n_Septenary_]\r\n\r\n  The illustration on the preceding page contains the arbitrary marks\r\n  or signs chosen to represent the several chemical elements or\r\n  ultimate particles.\r\n\r\n    Fig.\r\n     1.

This arose\r\npartly from inadequate experimental data, and partly from uncertainty\r\nas to the relative number of the constituent atoms which made up a\r\ncompound. Neither Dalton nor his immediate successors had any rational\r\nor consistent method of determining the latter point. The view taken of\r\nthe composition of the compound decided what particular multiples or\r\nsub-multiples of the values of the atomic weights of its constituents\r\nwere to be adopted. As Dalton, in many cases, had no real criterion to\r\nguide him, he made the simplest possible assumptions; but these might\r\nor might not be valid; and subsequent experience showed that in some\r\ncases they were erroneous.\r\n\r\nIt was, however, generally recognised that these atomic weights,\r\ncombining proportions, or equivalents, as they were for a time\r\nindifferently termed, were chemical constants of the highest\r\nimportance, both to the scientific chemist, who, apart from their\r\ntheoretic interest, had need of them in the course of quantitative\r\nanalysis, and to the manufacturing chemist, who required them for\r\nthe intelligent exercise of his operations; and accordingly a number\r\nof chemists, very shortly after the promulgation of Dalton’s theory,\r\nattempted to determine their values with all possible precision. Chief\r\namong these was the Swedish chemist Berzelius, to whom science was\r\nindebted for a series of estimations of atomic weights, which were long\r\nregarded as models of quantitative accuracy, and stamped their author\r\nas the greatest master of determinative chemistry of his age.\r\n\r\n=Jöns Jakob Berzelius=, the son of a schoolmaster, was born near\r\nLinköping, in East Gothland, Sweden, in 1779. Entering Upsala with\r\na view to the profession of medicine, he was attracted, under the\r\ninfluence of Afzelius—or, rather, in spite of it—to the study of\r\nchemistry, and, later, of voltaic electricity, then in its infancy.\r\nWhile holding a number of minor appointments as a teacher of medicine,\r\npharmacy, physics, and chemistry, he was elected, in 1808, a member\r\nof the Swedish Academy of Sciences, of which he became President in\r\n1810. In 1818 he was made permanent Secretary of the Academy, and, by\r\nmeans of a yearly subsidy, was enabled to devote himself wholly to\r\nexperimental science. He was ennobled in 1818, and on the occasion of\r\nhis marriage, in 1835, was created a baron of the Scandinavian kingdom.\r\nHe died in 1848.\r\n\r\nBerzelius occupies a pre-eminent position in the history of chemistry,\r\nand during a considerable portion of his lifetime exercised an almost\r\nunassailable authority as a chemical philosopher. He is distinguished\r\nas an experimenter, as a discoverer, as a critic and interpreter,\r\nand as a lawgiver. His contributions to chemical knowledge range\r\nover every department of the science. He shares with Davy the honour\r\nof having established the fundamental laws of electro-chemistry.\r\nHis experimental work on the atomic weights of the elements—the\r\ngreat work of his life—was of supreme importance at this particular\r\nperiod of the development of chemistry: it served not only to give\r\nprecision to, and enhance the significance and value of, Dalton’s\r\ngeneralisation, but it furnished chemists, for the first time, with\r\na set of constants, ascertained with the highest exactitude of which\r\noperative chemistry was then capable, thereby contributing to the\r\nexpansion of quantitative analysis, and to a more exact knowledge of\r\nthe composition of substances. Berzelius, indeed, was an analyst of the\r\nfirst rank—conscientious, patient, and painstaking; an ingenious and\r\nskilful manipulator; inventive and resourceful. What determinative\r\nchemistry owes to his labours, and not less to his example, is obvious\r\nfrom even the most superficial examination of its literature during the\r\nfirst third of the last century.\r\n\r\nAs a discoverer, Berzelius first made known the existence of _cerium_\r\n(1803), of _selenium_ (1818), and of _thorium_ (1828); and he prepared\r\nand investigated a large number of their combinations. He isolated\r\n_silicon_ (1823), _zirconium_ (1824), _tantalum_ (1824), and studied\r\nthe compounds of _vanadium_, discovered by his countryman Sefström.\r\nHe largely extended our knowledge of groups of substances in which\r\nsulphur replaces oxygen; investigated compounds of fluorine (1824),\r\nplatinum (1828), and tellurium (1831–1833), and made many analyses of\r\nminerals, meteorites, and mineral-waters. He discovered _racemic acid_\r\nand investigated the ferrocyanides. It was his investigation of racemic\r\nacid—which has the same percentage composition as tartaric acid—that\r\nfirst enabled him to grasp the conception of _isomerism_, a term which\r\nwe owe to him, and of _metamerism_ and _polymerism_. He was the first\r\nto study the phenomena of contact-actions, which he comprehended under\r\nthe term _catalysis_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JÖNS JAKOB BERZELIUS.\r\n\r\nFrom a painting by J. G. Sandberg.]\r\n\r\nAs an author his literary activity was astonishing. His new system of\r\nmineralogy marks an epoch in the history of that branch of science. His\r\ntext-book on chemistry was long the leading manual, and went through\r\nmany editions, being constantly revised by him. His annual reports on\r\nthe progress of physics and chemistry extended to twenty-seven volumes\r\nand constitute a monument to his industry, thoroughness, perspicacity,\r\nand critical ability.\r\n\r\nAlthough holding no university appointment, and with a laboratory of\r\nthe most modest dimensions and character, Berzelius, exercised great\r\ninfluence as a teacher. Some of the most notable chemists of the last\r\ncentury, such as Heinrich and Gustav Rose, Dulong, Mitscherlich,\r\nWöhler, Chr. Gmelin, and Mosander, were among his pupils; and many of\r\nthem have testified to his stimulating power as an investigator of\r\nnature, and to his merits as a worthy, genial man.\r\n\r\nThe reasonableness of Dalton’s conjecture received further support\r\nfrom the discovery by Gay Lussac in 1808, that gases always combine\r\nin simple proportions by volume, and that the volume of the gaseous\r\nproduct formed, when measured under comparable conditions of\r\ntemperature and pressure, stands in a simple relation to the volumes\r\nof the constituents. The law of pressure discovered by Boyle, that\r\nof thermal expansion by Dalton, and of volumes by Gay Lussac (which,\r\nit ought to be stated, was previously and independently made by\r\nDalton), are explained on the assumption that equal numbers of the\r\nparticles—either as simple particles or as compound particles—are\r\npresent in the same volume of the gas. This method of explanation was\r\nfirst clearly stated by the Italian physicist =Avogadro= in 1811, but\r\nits significance, as will be seen subsequently, was not appreciated\r\nuntil half a century later.\r\n\r\nAs the values for the atomic weights gradually became more exact,\r\nspeculations arose as to the significance of the numerical relations\r\nwhich were observed to exist among them. In 1815 =William Prout= threw\r\nout the supposition that the atomic weights of the gaseous elements\r\nare multiples by whole numbers of that of hydrogen. Extended into a\r\ngeneralisation, this might be held to indicate that all kinds of matter\r\nare so many forms of a primordial substance. Subsequent inquiry showed\r\nthat Prout’s “Law,” as it is sometimes called, was not tenable in its\r\noriginal form. Certain elements, it was conclusively proved, had atomic\r\nweights which were not whole numbers. Dumas subsequently modified the\r\nlaw, after a redetermination of a large number of atomic weights,\r\nby assuming that the substance common to the so-called elements had\r\na lower atomic weight than unity. Although there are a considerable\r\nnumber of elements whose atomic weights, based upon the most\r\naccurate determinations, are remarkably close to whole numbers, the\r\ninvestigations of Stas and others afford no valid reason for believing\r\nthat Prout’s hypothesis, and the underlying supposition to which it has\r\nbeen held to point, are justified by experimental evidence.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE BEGINNINGS OF ELECTRO-CHEMISTRY\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first year of the nineteenth century is further memorable on\r\naccount of the invention of the voltaic pile, and by reason of its\r\napplication by =William Nicholson= and =Sir Anthony Carlisle= to the\r\nelectrolytic decomposition of water. This mode of resolving water into\r\nits constituents made a great sensation at the time, mainly because\r\nof the extraordinary method by which it was effected. It afforded an\r\nindependent and unlooked-for proof of the compound nature of water\r\nby a method altogether differing in principle from that by which its\r\ncomposition had been previously ascertained. The formation of water by\r\nthe combustion of hydrogen brought no conviction of its real nature\r\nto a confirmed phlogistian like Priestley; and it is even doubtful\r\nwhether Cavendish ever fully realised the true significance of his\r\ngreat discovery. But the fact that the quantitative results of the\r\nanalysis thus effected were identical with those of its synthesis, as\r\nmade by Cavendish and Lavoisier, admitted of only one interpretation.\r\nThis cardinal discovery may be said to have completed the downfall of\r\nphlogiston.\r\n\r\nThe value of the voltaic pile as an analytical agent was nowhere more\r\nquickly appreciated than in England. In the hands of Humphry Davy its\r\napplication to the analysis of the alkalis and alkaline earths led to\r\ndiscoveries of the greatest magnitude.\r\n\r\n=Humphry Davy= was born in Penzance in 1778. In the course of his\r\nstudies for the profession of medicine he was attracted to chemistry;\r\nand he became chemical assistant to Dr. Beddoes, a former teacher of\r\nchemistry at Oxford, but then living at Clifton, near Bristol. While\r\nin the capacity of assistant and operator in Beddoes’s Pneumatical\r\nInstitute, Davy discovered the intoxicating properties of _nitrous\r\noxide_ (so called laughing gas), which brought him into prominence\r\nand led to his engagement by the managers of the newly-created Royal\r\nInstitution in London as lecturer in chemistry in succession to\r\nGarnett. He early began to experiment on galvanism, and soon succeeded\r\nin developing the fundamental laws of electro-chemistry; and in 1807 he\r\neffected the _decomposition of potash and soda_ by the application of\r\nvoltaic electricity—thereby establishing, what indeed had been surmised\r\npreviously, that the alkalis are compound substances. He subsequently\r\nproved that this was also the case with the alkaline earths. Davy thus\r\nadded some five or six metallic elements to those already known.\r\n\r\nThese discoveries, perhaps the most brilliant of their time, afforded\r\nadditional evidence of the invalidity of Lavoisier’s assumption that\r\noxygen, as the name implies, was the “principle of acidity.” The\r\nsurmise, in fact, was already disproved by the case of water—a neutral\r\nsubstance and devoid of all the recognised attributes of an acid. It\r\nwas still further disproved by the cases of potash and soda—strongly\r\nalkaline compounds.\r\n\r\nAdditional evidence was adduced by Davy in demonstrating, in 1810,\r\nthat the so-called _oxymuriatic acid_, the _dephlogisticated\r\nmarine acid_ discovered by Scheele, contained no oxygen, but was\r\na simple, indivisible substance. For the old designation, which\r\nconnoted a compound body, he substituted the name _chlorine_, in\r\nallusion to the characteristic colour of the element. In the course\r\nof his investigation on this substance he discovered the _penta-\r\nand trichloride of phosphorus_, _chlorophosphamide_ and _chlorine\r\nperoxide_. He was also the discoverer of _telluretted hydrogen_ and an\r\nindependent discoverer of _nitrosulphonic acid_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SIR HUMPHRY DAVY.\r\n\r\nFrom a painting by Lawrence in the possession of the Royal Society.]\r\n\r\nHe worked on _iodine_ and the _iodates_, on the _diamond_, on the\r\nso-called _fuming liquor of Cadet_, on _nitrogen chloride_, and on the\r\n_pigments of the ancients_. Lastly, he invented the _miner’s safety\r\nlamp_, with which his name will always be associated, effecting thereby\r\nwhat was practically a revolution in coal-mining. He became President\r\nof the Royal Society in 1820, and died at Geneva on May 29th, 1829, in\r\nthe fifty-first year of his age. Davy was a singularly gifted man, of\r\ngreat mental vigour and imaginative power; quick, lively and ingenious;\r\nan eloquent teacher and a daring and brilliant experimenter.\r\n\r\nAnother noteworthy name in the chemical history of this period is\r\nWollaston. =William Hyde Wollaston=, born at East Dereham, in Norfolk,\r\nin 1766, was educated at Cambridge with a view to the profession of\r\nmedicine, but, failing to secure a practice, he devoted himself to\r\nthe pursuit of science, and especially to optics and chemistry. He\r\ndevised a method of _working platinum_, and was the first to make known\r\nthe existence of _palladium_ and _rhodium_. He was one of the most\r\ningenious and acute analysts of his time, and possessed remarkable\r\ninventive powers. He investigated the nature of _urinary calculi_\r\nand _chalk stones_. His paper on the _oxalates of potash_ was of\r\ngreat service at the time as a demonstration of the law of multiple\r\nproportions. He first drew attention to the existence in the solar\r\nspectrum of what were subsequently termed the _Fraunhofer lines_; and\r\nhe invented the _reflecting goniometer_ and the _camera lucida_, and\r\na _slide rule_ for chemical calculations. He resembled Cavendish in\r\ntemperament and mental habitudes, and, like him, was distinguished\r\nfor the range and exactitude of his scientific knowledge, his habitual\r\ncaution, and his cold and reserved disposition. He died in 1828.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM HYDE WOLLASTON.\r\n\r\nFrom a painting by J. Jackson, R.A., in the possession of the Royal\r\nSociety.]\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately after the publication of Volta’s discovery attempts\r\nwere made—notably by Berzelius in Sweden and by Davy in England—to\r\nprove that electrical and chemical phenomena are correlated and\r\nmutually dependent. This assumption was more fully worked out by\r\nBerzelius in 1812, and it served as the basis of a chemical system\r\nwhich exercised considerable influence on chemical doctrine during the\r\nfirst half of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nBerzelius assumed that electric polarity was an attribute of all\r\natoms—that these were bipolar, in fact, but that in them either\r\npositive or negative electricity predominated. Hence the elements\r\nwere capable of being divided into two classes—that is, positive or\r\nnegative, depending upon the excess of either charge. Which of the\r\nelectricities predominated might be ascertained by determining the\r\nparticular pole at which the element was separated on electrolysis.\r\nCombinations of dissimilar elements—or, in other words, chemical\r\ncompounds—were also endowed with polarity. The chemical affinities of\r\nelements and compounds were related to the excess of either kind of\r\nelectricity resident in them; and chemical combination resulted from,\r\nand was a consequence of, the more or less perfect neutralisation\r\nof the two kinds. From a study of the electrical deportment of the\r\nelements Berzelius sought to arrange them in series, starting with\r\noxygen as the most electro-negative member.\r\n\r\nThese conceptions were employed by him as the basis of a method of\r\nclassification. The attempt is historically interesting as being the\r\nfirst systematic endeavour to gain an insight into the constitution\r\nof chemical compounds—that is, to determine the manner in which the\r\nconstituent atoms are grouped or arranged with respect to one another,\r\nor, in other words, to distinguish between the empirical and the\r\nrational composition of substances, which is the ultimate aim of modern\r\nchemistry.\r\n\r\nA necessary consequence of these views was that every compound was to\r\nbe considered as made up of two parts in electrically different states.\r\nThus baryta, consisted of a combination of the electro-positive barium,\r\ncombined with the electro-negative oxygen; it combined with sulphuric\r\noxide because the preponderating positive electricity it contained met\r\nwith the negative electricity which prevailed in the sulphuric oxide.\r\nGeneralising, it may be said that the basic oxides are invariably\r\nthe positive constituents of salts, whereas the acid oxides are the\r\nnegative constituents, as proved by the mode in which the two kinds of\r\noxides separated at the poles on electrolysis. Barium sulphate, then,\r\nwas to be regarded as made up of two entities—BaO and SO3—and hence was\r\nto be called sulphate of baryta. Berzelius extended this conception\r\nin order to explain the formation of double salts—such, for example,\r\nas potash alum, which he regarded as a binary compound of positive\r\npotassium sulphate and negative aluminium sulphate, each of which,\r\nin its turn, could be resolved into an acidic and a basic oxide of\r\nopposite electricities.\r\n\r\nThe dualistic notions of Berzelius led him to the construction of\r\na system of chemical nomenclature and notation which, in its main\r\nfeatures, has persisted to this day, and is universally current, with\r\ncertain modifications, in modern chemical literature. We owe to him\r\nthe grouping of the elements into metals and metalloids, and also our\r\npresent system of symbolic notation, whereby even complicated chemical\r\nreactions may be expressed in a concise and intelligible manner.\r\nChemical symbols were used by the alchemists; but Berzelius first\r\nsuggested that a chemical symbol should not only represent the element\r\nto which it refers, but also its relative atomic weight. Chemical\r\nequations became quantitative as well as qualitative expressions of\r\nthe facts they denote. Such equations implicitly assumed that, to\r\nuse Davy’s words, chemistry had passed under the dominion of the\r\nmathematical sciences. Professed mathematicians were, however, slow to\r\nrecognise that the phenomena of chemical action were capable of formal\r\nmathematical treatment. Davy relates that on speaking to Laplace of\r\nthe atomic theory in chemistry, and expressing his belief that the\r\nscience would ultimately be referred to mathematical laws similar to\r\nthose he had so profoundly and successfully established with respect\r\nto the mechanical properties of matter, the idea was treated in a tone\r\nbordering on contempt.\r\n\r\nBerzelius’s electro-chemical system, and the dualistic ideas associated\r\nwith it, were of considerable service when applied to the inorganic\r\nbranch of the science; but attempts to fit them to the facts of organic\r\nchemistry, which began to accumulate rapidly after the first quarter of\r\nthe century, failed. Its inadequacy as a comprehensive generalisation\r\nbecame more and more manifest, and it eventually fell. In fact, it may\r\nbe said to have received its death-blow by Davy’s discovery of the\r\nelementary nature of chlorine, and by the recognition of the fact that\r\nthe acids do not necessarily contain oxygen. Davy and, later, Dulong\r\nmade it obvious that, if any one element was to be regarded as the\r\nacidifying principle, it was hydrogen, and not oxygen; and, in a sense,\r\nthis view ultimately prevailed in the recognition of the acids as salts\r\nof hydrogen.\r\n\r\nIn France the study of electro-chemistry was undertaken by Gay Lussac\r\nand Thénard, largely owing to the action of the Emperor Napoleon,\r\nwho furnished the funds for the construction of a powerful galvanic\r\nbattery. The results were published, in 1811, under the title,\r\n_Recherches Physico-Chimiques, faites sur la Pile_, etc. Gay Lussac,\r\nwhose name has already been mentioned as one of the discoverers of\r\nthe Law of Combination of Gases, played a considerable part in the\r\nhistory of chemistry at this period. He was one of the earliest to\r\nappreciate the importance of Dalton’s generalisation, and to point\r\nout the significance of his own discovery in strengthening it. He was\r\nprobably led, in the first instance, to the recognition of the law of\r\ngaseous combination by Berthollet’s work on the volumetric composition\r\nof ammonia gas, and by his own discovery—made in 1805, in conjunction\r\nwith Humboldt, in the course of their analysis of atmospheric air—that\r\none volume of oxygen combined with exactly two volumes of hydrogen to\r\nform water. The regularities thus indicated he found to be general: all\r\ngases which are capable of chemical union combine in simple proportions\r\nby volume, and the volume of the product, if a gas, always stands in\r\nsome simple relation to the volumes of the constituents.\r\n\r\n=Joseph Louis Gay Lussac= was born in 1778, at Saint Leonard, studied\r\nchemistry in Paris, and was associated in chemical inquiry with\r\nBerthollet. As Eleve-Ingenieur in the École Nationale des Ponts et\r\ndes Chaussées he began the experimental work in physics and chemistry\r\nupon which his fame rests. In 1804 he undertook, with Biot, a series\r\nof balloon ascents for the purpose of investigating the physics and\r\nchemistry of the upper regions of the atmosphere. In 1806 he became\r\nProfessor of Chemistry at the École Polytechnique, and in 1832\r\nProfessor at the Jardin des Plantes. He was one of the chief assayers\r\nof the French Mint, and, as member of many commissions, exerted\r\nconsiderable influence in official circles. He died in 1850.\r\n\r\nGay Lussac and Thénard were the first to devise a method of obtaining\r\npotassium and sodium by a purely chemical process, whereby these\r\nmetals could be procured in far larger quantities than was at that\r\ntime possible by electrolytic means. They were thus enabled to make\r\nuse of the strong deoxidising power of these metals to effect a number\r\nof reductions, notably that of boric oxide to _boron_. Gay Lussac and\r\nThénard were also the first to make known the existence of _boron\r\nfluoride_. We further owe to Gay Lussac the discovery of _cyanogen_,\r\nthe first of the so-called compound radicals. He first prepared\r\nethyl iodide, investigated sulphovinic acid and grape sugar, studied\r\netherification and fermentation, etc. We are also indebted to him\r\nfor a method of determining vapour densities which proved of great\r\nservice in ascertaining the molecular weights of substances. He worked\r\non iodine and its compounds, discovered, with Welter, _thiosulphuric_\r\nacid, and investigated fulminic acid in collaboration with Liebig.\r\n\r\nAmong his services to analytical chemistry were his method for the\r\nanalysis of gunpowder, his volumetric estimation of silver (wet silver\r\nassay), chlorometric analysis, alkalimetry, etc. He devised the system\r\nstill in use in France for the estimation of alcohol in spirits of wine.\r\n\r\n=Louis Jacques Thénard= was born in 1777 at Nogent-Sur-Seine, and was\r\na pupil of Vauquelin and of Berthollet. In 1797 he became _repétiteur_\r\nat the Polytechnic School of Paris, and eventually its professor. He\r\nsubsequently occupied the chair of chemistry at the Collège de France,\r\nand of the Faculty of Science of the University of Paris. He was\r\nennobled by Charles X. in 1824, and died at Paris in the eightieth year\r\nof his age.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his work with Gay Lussac already mentioned, we owe\r\nto Thénard the discovery of _hydrogen peroxide_ and _hydrogen\r\npersulphide_. Together with Dulong he studied the catalytic action of\r\nplatinum on mixtures of oxygen and hydrogen. He investigated the fatty\r\nacids, and worked on fermentation and on ether-formation; and he was\r\nthe first to isolate citric and malic acids. He also occupied himself\r\nwith the chemistry of bile, perspiration, albumen, the acids of urine\r\nand milk, and with the theory of mordants.\r\n\r\nIn 1834 Faraday made known the important fact that on passing the same\r\ngalvanic current through a number of electrolytes—water, hydrochloric\r\nacid, solutions of metallic chloride—these were decomposed in such\r\nmanner that definite amounts of hydrogen or metal were separated at the\r\nnegative pole, and corresponding amounts of oxygen or chlorine were\r\nevolved at the positive pole. These observations were comprehended\r\nby Faraday under his “law of definite electrolytic action.” The\r\nelectro-chemical equivalents thus obtained were in some cases identical\r\nwith the atomic weights deduced by Berzelius; in others they were\r\nnot; but, nevertheless, when they differed, they stood in some simple\r\nrelation to the assumed atomic weight. The significance of Faraday’s\r\nobservation was not lost sight of, although his anticipation that the\r\ndetermination of electro-chemical equivalents would be of use in fixing\r\natomic weights was not immediately appreciated. A clear distinction\r\nbetween the _equivalent_, the _atom_, and the _molecule_ was not\r\nthen apprehended. As will be subsequently shown, it was only during\r\nthe latter half of the nineteenth century that the discrepancies and\r\ninconsistencies thus revealed were definitely reconciled and cleared\r\nup.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE FOUNDATIONS OF ORGANIC CHEMISTRY\r\n\r\n\r\nAs the horizon of chemistry widened and its operations extended, it\r\nbecame necessary to treat its subject-matter methodically. Accordingly\r\nattempts were made in the various systematic treatises which began to\r\nappear in the seventeenth century to group its facts into an orderly\r\nand rational arrangement. One of the earliest of such systematic\r\ntreatises was the _Cours de Chimie_ of Nicolas Lemery, published in\r\n1675. Although this work was styled by Boerhaave “a tumultuary mass of\r\npharmaceutical processes, without any certain design or coherence,” it\r\nis noteworthy as being the first of its kind to divide the science into\r\nits present main branches of inorganic and organic chemistry.\r\n\r\nIt may be desirable to indicate, as briefly as possible, the general\r\nstate of knowledge respecting the chemistry of organic substances\r\ndown to the early years of the last century. As already mentioned,\r\nsuch substances as acetic acid, turpentine, starch, sugar, certain\r\ndye stuffs, and oils, had long been known; and such processes as\r\nsaponification and fermentation had been practised from very early\r\ntimes. The alchemists had prepared a variety of essential oils,\r\naliphatic ethers, and esters; and the iatro-chemists had obtained\r\nbenzoic and succinic acids, and acetic acid from wood. Milk sugar\r\nwas first prepared by Fabrizio Bartoletti in 1619. Grape sugar was\r\nfirst mentioned as occurring in honey by Glauber in 1660. Boyle first\r\ndetected the presence of a spirit among the products of the destructive\r\ndistillation of wood. Few of the followers of Stahl occupied themselves\r\nwith organic products; and it was only towards the end of the\r\nphlogistic period that attention was once more directed to products of\r\nanimal and vegetable origin. Scheele isolated glycerin in 1784, and\r\nobtained _ethyl chloride_ by the distillation of a mixture of common\r\nsalt, pyrolusite, oil of vitriol, and alcohol. _Ethyl acetate_ was\r\nfirst prepared by Lauraquais in 1759. Arvidson obtained _ethyl formate_\r\nin 1777. _Oxalic ether_ was first made by Savary in 1773. What was\r\nlong known as _oil of wine_ appears to have been first mentioned by\r\nLibavius, but its true nature was discovered by Hennel in 1826. The\r\nformation of _aldehyde_ was first recognised by Scheele in 1774, and\r\nit was in turn investigated by Fourcroy and Vauquelin, Döbereiner, and\r\nGay Lussac; but it was first definitely isolated in 1835 by Liebig, who\r\ngave it its name.\r\n\r\nThe first organic acid known was vinegar (acetic acid), and for a\r\nlong time all naturally occurring organic acids having a sour taste\r\nwere regarded as identical with or as forms of vinegar. It was only\r\nduring the second half of the eighteenth century that it was clearly\r\nascertained that a variety of organic acids exist, perfectly distinct\r\nfrom acetic acid. _Glacial acetic acid_ was first obtained by Löwiz\r\nin 1789. Acetic acid, as a product of the destructive distillation of\r\nwood, was first obtained by Göttling in 1779. The acetic fermentation\r\nhas been studied from very early times. Surmises as to the mode in\r\nwhich wine was converted into vinegar are to be met with in the works\r\nof Basil Valentine, Becher (1669), Lemery (1675), and Stahl (1667).\r\nPriestley, for a time, held the opinion that vinegar contained a\r\nvegetable acid air, but he subsequently discovered and corrected his\r\nerror. The direct conversion of spirit of wine (ethyl alcohol) into\r\nacetic acid was studied by Lavoisier and Berthollet, who first clearly\r\nrecognised that it was a process of oxidation. The quantitative\r\ncomposition of acetic acid was first established by Berzelius in 1814.\r\nMany of the acetates have been known from early times. _Verdigris_ is\r\nmentioned by Theophrastus, Dioscorides, and Pliny. _Zinc acetate_ was\r\nknown to Geber, and _potassium acetate_ to Pliny, who mentions its use\r\nin medicine. _Ammonium acetate_ was also used in medicine as far back\r\nas the beginning of the seventeenth century, and was particularly\r\nrecommended by the physician, Raymond Minderer. _Sodium acetate_ was\r\nprepared by Duhamel in 1736. _Lead acetate_ was known in the fifteenth\r\ncentury, and was styled by Libavius _saccharum plumbi quintessentiale_,\r\nin allusion to its sweet taste. What was called by the alchemists _lac\r\nvirginis_ was a turbid solution of basic lead acetate, and it was\r\nfrequently used in medicine, more particularly by Goulard in 1760.\r\nWhat we now call _acetone_ was first observed by Libavius, in 1595,\r\nand subsequently by Boyle, during the destructive distillation of lead\r\nacetate: its formation from other acetates was noticed by Trommsdorff,\r\nDerosne, and Chenevix, by whom it was termed pyroacetic spirit. Its\r\ntrue nature and composition were first ascertained by Liebig in 1831.\r\n\r\nThe formation of tartar in the manufacture of wine has been known\r\nfrom the earliest times. It was regarded as, and originally styled,\r\nthe _faex vini_. The word “Tartarus” is first met with in alchemistic\r\nliterature in the eleventh century, and is the Latinised form of an\r\nArabic word. Marggraf, in 1764, recognised that the tartar of wine\r\ncontained potash; but tartaric acid itself was first isolated by\r\nScheele in 1769.\r\n\r\nThe _double tartrate of potash and soda_ was first prepared in 1672\r\nby Peter Seignette, an apothecary of Rochelle, and was used by him\r\nin medicine. _Tartar emetic_ was discovered by Adrian von Mynsicht\r\nin 1631, and its true nature explained by Bergmann in 1773. _Racemic\r\nacid_ was first mentioned by a wine manufacturer named Kestner, and\r\nwas recognised as an acid in 1819. Its relation to tartaric acid, with\r\nwhich it is isomeric, was first explained by Berzelius, who gave it its\r\nname.\r\n\r\nThe naturally occurring oxalates were long considered as identical with\r\ntartar. _Oxalic acid_ was obtained by Scheele in 1776 by means of the\r\naction of nitric acid upon sugar. This acid was further investigated\r\nby Bergmann, who observed its decomposition by heat with the formation\r\nof a gas burning with a blue flame. The identity of the naturally\r\noccurring oxalic acid with that prepared from sugar was established\r\nby Scheele in 1784. The quantitative composition of oxalic acid was\r\nfirst ascertained by Dulong in 1815. _Mucic acid_ was discovered by\r\nScheele in 1780, and was studied by Fourcroy, who gave it the name it\r\nnow bears. _Pyromucic acid_ was also known to Scheele, and was observed\r\nby Hermbstädt and Houton-Labillardière. _Camphoric acid_ was first\r\nrecognised by Bouillon-Lagrange and Vauquelin. _Suberic acid_ was\r\ndiscovered by Brugnatelli in 1787.\r\n\r\nThat gum benzoin yielded a product (_benzoic acid_) by sublimation was\r\nknown in the sixteenth century. It was introduced into medicine by\r\nTurquet de Mayerne as _flowers of benzoin_. Scheele showed how this\r\nacid might be obtained by wet methods from gum-benzoin. It was detected\r\nin Peru-balsam by Lehmann in 1709. Rouelle found it in the urine of the\r\ncow and the camel. Liebig, in 1829, detected the difference between\r\n_hippuric acid_ and benzoic acid. The characteristic acid in amber\r\n(_succinic acid_) was first detected by Pott in 1753.\r\n\r\n_Formic acid_ was first isolated by Wray in 1676. _Lactic acid_ was\r\ndiscovered by Scheele in sour milk in 1780. For a time it was regarded\r\nas impure acetic acid, until it was detected in muscle juice by\r\nBerzelius, and its individuality established. Its true composition was\r\nascertained by Mitscherlich and by Liebig in 1832. _Citric acid_ has\r\nbeen known since the thirteenth century, but it was first definitely\r\nisolated by Scheele in 1784. Apple juice was used in medicine in the\r\nsixteenth century, and the soda salt of its characteristic acid (_malic\r\nacid_) was prepared by Donald Monro in 1767.\r\n\r\nIt was known to the ancients that extract of gall nuts acquired a\r\nblack colour when mixed with a solution of iron vitriol; and Boyle\r\nand Bergmann ascribed this phenomenon to the presence of a peculiar\r\nacid. _Gallic acid_ was first isolated by Scheele in 1785, and its\r\ncomposition established by Berzelius in 1814. _Tannic acid_ was\r\ndefinitely recognised as distinct from gallic acid by Seguin in 1795.\r\n\r\nMellite, or honey-stone, is mentioned in mineralogical treatises in the\r\nsixteenth century. That it consisted of the alumina salt of a special\r\nacid (_mellic acid_) was shown by Klaproth in 1799.\r\n\r\n_Prussian blue_ was accidentally discovered in 1710 by a dyer named\r\nDiesbach. Its mode of manufacture was first made known by Woodward\r\nin 1724. The peculiar reaction by which it was obtained was made the\r\nsubject of investigation by many chemists of the period without any\r\ndecisive result. Scheele observed that, when the salt which occasioned\r\nthe blue colour with vitriol was distilled with sulphuric acid, a\r\nvolatile acid, inflammable and soluble in water, was obtained. This\r\nacid received from Bergmann the name of _acidum cœrulei berolinensis_,\r\nor “Berlin-blue acid,” subsequently shortened by Guyton de Morveau\r\nto _prussic acid_. Scheele also prepared the cyanides of silver and\r\nammonium. That prussic acid was free from oxygen was established\r\nby Berthollet. Anhydrous prussic acid was first obtained by Von\r\nIttner, who first established its highly poisonous nature. Bolim, in\r\n1802, had previously observed the presence of prussic acid in oil\r\nof bitter almonds, the poisonous character of which was known to\r\nDioscorides. Porret first definitely isolated _potassium ferrocyanide_,\r\nand subsequently discovered the _thiocyanates_, the quantitative\r\ncomposition of which was ascertained by Berzelius in 1820. That\r\nprussic acid was a compound of hydrogen and cyanogen was established by\r\nGay Lussac in 1815.\r\n\r\n_Cyanic acid_ was discovered by Wöhler in 1822, in which year also L.\r\nGmelin discovered the _ferricyanides_.\r\n\r\n_Fulminating mercury_ was first prepared by Howard in 1800, and\r\n_fulminating silver_ by Brugnatelli in 1802. These were recognised\r\nby Liebig, in 1822, to contain a peculiar acid, which he termed\r\n_fulminic acid_, and which he showed to have the same composition\r\nas the cyanic acid discovered by Wöhler. _Uric acid_, so named by\r\nFourcroy, was discovered in gall stones by Scheele in 1776. _Urea_ was\r\nfirst definitely isolated by Fourcroy and Vauquelin in 1799, and was\r\nsynthetically prepared by Wöhler in 1828.\r\n\r\nThe bitter principles of plants and their medicinal virtues early\r\nattracted attention, but the first attempt to isolate them was made by\r\nFourcroy and Vauquelin in the case of the Peruvian bark, long known for\r\nits power as a febrifuge. In 1806 Vauquelin obtained _quinic acid_.\r\n_Cinchonine_ was first isolated by Gomes in 1811.\r\n\r\nThe chemical nature of opium was the subject of numerous inquiries in\r\nthe early years of the nineteenth century. In 1805 Sertürner detected\r\nthe existence of _meconic acid_, and in 1817 that of _morphine_, which\r\nhe recognised as an alkaloid. _Narcotine_ was discovered by Robiquet in\r\n1835. The investigation of other bitter substances was undertaken by\r\nPelletier and Caventou, who in 1818 discovered _strychnine_, _brucine_\r\n(1819), and _veratrine_ (1820).\r\n\r\nThe contemporaries and immediate followers of Lavoisier were the\r\nfirst to make a systematic attempt to elucidate the chemical nature\r\nof organic products of animal origin. To this period belongs the work\r\nof Fourcroy and Vauquelin on animal chemistry. Chevreul, a pupil of\r\nFourcroy worked on urine, adipocire, and the animal fats in the first\r\ndecade of the last century. Kirchhoff in 1811, discovered the method\r\nof converting starch into sugar; and Döbereiner, in 1822, described\r\na method of preparing formic acid artificially. Dumas and Boullay,\r\nin 1827–1828, prepared a number of new derivatives of ethyl alcohol;\r\nand in 1834 Dumas and Peligot studied in like manner the chemistry of\r\nmethyl alcohol, and pointed out many analogies which their compounds\r\npossessed, not only among themselves, but also to inorganic substances.\r\n\r\nAlthough a considerable amount of information as to the existence,\r\nmodes of occurrence, and properties of bodies found in the animal\r\nand vegetable kingdoms had been accumulated by the end of the first\r\nquarter of the nineteenth century, no serious attempt was made to\r\nstudy them systematically until after that period. In fact, they\r\nwere not even regarded as coming within the operations of laws\r\nfound to be applicable to the products of the inorganic world, by\r\nthe investigation, of which products, indeed, those laws had been\r\ndiscovered.\r\n\r\nDown to 1828 it was considered that inorganic and organic substances\r\nwere sharply differentiated by the circumstance that, whereas the\r\nformer might be prepared by artificial means, and even built up from\r\ntheir elements by synthetic processes in the laboratory, the latter\r\ncould only be formed in the bodies of animals and plants as the result\r\nof vital force. In that year Wöhler showed that urea, pre-eminently\r\na product of animal metabolism, could be prepared synthetically from\r\ninorganic materials. Other instances of a similar kind were discovered\r\nin rapid succession; and the idea that organic substances could alone\r\nbe formed by vital processes was proved to be invalid. Moreover, large\r\nnumbers of substances of a character analogous to those produced by\r\nphysiological action, but not known to occur in the animal or vegetable\r\nkingdom, were prepared. There is, therefore, no absolute distinction to\r\nbe drawn between the chemistry of the inorganic and organic worlds.\r\n\r\nAt the present day we mean by “organic compounds” simply the compounds\r\nof carbon. These are so numerous, and frequently so complex, that\r\nit is convenient to group them together and study them as a special\r\nsection of the science. At the outset it was supposed that only very\r\nfew elements entered into the composition of organic substances. This,\r\nindeed, was held to be a point of fundamental distinction between\r\norganic and inorganic compounds. Lavoisier was of opinion that all\r\norganic bodies were combinations of carbon, hydrogen, and oxygen.\r\nBerthollet first discovered the presence of nitrogen in a product\r\nof animal origin. Sulphur and phosphorus were detected later. There\r\nis apparently no _à priori_ reason why any element should not be\r\nassociated with carbon, and enter into the composition of an organic\r\ncompound.\r\n\r\nLavoisier was one of the first to devise methods for ascertaining\r\nthe composition of organic (carbon) compounds, and to indicate the\r\ngeneral principles by which the proportion of the elements met with\r\nin these substances can be ascertained. So imperfectly, however, were\r\nthese methods worked out that it was not established until the close\r\nof the first decade of the nineteenth century that organic compounds\r\neven obeyed the law of multiple proportions. Thanks to the efforts\r\nof Berzelius, Gay Lussac, and Thénard, and especially of Liebig, in\r\n1830, methods of organic analysis were so far perfected that it became\r\npossible to ascertain the empirical composition of these compounds\r\nwith certainty. This point reached, the development of this section\r\nof chemistry proceeded with unexampled rapidity. Not only was the\r\ncomposition of numbers of products, such as sugar, starch, the\r\nvegetable acids, certain alkaloids, etc., established, but altogether\r\nunlooked-for facts became manifest. One of the most surprising of these\r\nwas that of _isomerism_.\r\n\r\nUp to the close of the first quarter of the nineteenth century it\r\nseemed self-evident that substances of the same percentage composition\r\nare necessarily identical. In 1823 Liebig showed that the silver\r\ncyanate of Wöhler had the same composition as silver fulminate.\r\nFaraday, in 1825, found a hydrocarbon in oil gas, which had the same\r\ncomposition as olefiant gas, but was otherwise different from it; and\r\nin 1828 Wöhler discovered that urea and ammonium cyanate—perfectly\r\ndissimilar substances—were identical in elementary composition. Lastly,\r\nBerzelius found this to be true of tartaric and racemic acids; and he\r\nthereupon proposed the term _isomerism_ to denote the general fact.\r\nHe further pointed out that the phenomenon could only be explained\r\nby supposing that the relative positions of the atoms in isomeric\r\ncompounds are different.\r\n\r\nBut the influence of molecular or atomic grouping in determining\r\nthe specific character of a substance is not confined to compounds.\r\nThe same phenomenon is observed to occur among the elements. It was\r\nconclusively established by Lavoisier that the diamond and charcoal\r\nare chemically the same thing—both forms of carbon. Scheele showed that\r\ngraphite was a third form of carbon. Phosphorus, sulphur, and oxygen\r\nwere subsequently shown to be each capable of existence in various\r\nmodifications. Instances of this character were grouped together in\r\n1841 by Berzelius under the term _allotropy_.\r\n\r\nThe recognition of the fact of isomerism exerted a great influence\r\non the development of organic chemistry. It ultimately led to the\r\nassumption that particular groups of elements or atomic complexes,\r\nso-called _radicals_, were to be found in organic compounds—a\r\nconception based originally on Gay Lussac’s discovery of _cyanogen_,\r\na combination of carbon and nitrogen, which was found to behave like\r\na simple substance, such as chlorine, and to give rise to compounds\r\nanalogous to the corresponding chlorides. This idea of the existence of\r\ncompound radicals was greatly strengthened by a memorable investigation\r\nby Liebig and Wöhler, in 1832, on oil of bitter almonds and its\r\nderivatives, in which they showed that these substances might be\r\nrepresented as containing a special group or radical termed _benzoyl_,\r\nwhich behaved like an element. The idea of groups of elements going\r\nin and out of combination like a simple substance was not new to\r\nchemists: there was not only the case of cyanogen, discovered by Gay\r\nLussac in 1815. The attempt had been made by Dumas and Boullay in\r\n1828 to classify the derivatives of alcohol and ether as compounds\r\ncontaining a common radical _etherin_. Gay Lussac had pointed out that\r\nthe vapour density of ethyl alcohol seemed to show that it consisted\r\nof equal volumes of ethylene and water. Robiquet had also shown that\r\nethyl chloride might be assumed to be a compound of hydrochloric acid\r\nand ethylene; and Döbereiner had regarded anhydrous oxalic acid as a\r\ncombination of carbonic acid with carbonic oxide.\r\n\r\nBut the investigation of Liebig and Wöhler served to give precision\r\nto the conception. It thereby exercised a profound influence on the\r\ndevelopment of organic chemistry by demonstrating, in effect, that\r\nthis branch of the science might be regarded as the chemistry of the\r\ncompound radicals, in contradistinction to inorganic chemistry—the\r\nchemistry of the simple radicals. Additional support for this view\r\nwas afforded by the remarkable research by Bunsen on the so-called\r\n_alkarsin_, the “fuming liquor of Cadet”—an evil-smelling substance\r\nlong known as being formed when an acetate is heated with arsenious\r\noxide. Bunsen showed that this liquid contained a compound radical\r\nhaving arsenic as a constituent; and he prepared a series of\r\nderivatives, all of which might be formulated as combinations of this\r\nradical, which he termed _cacodyl_. The study of the electrolytic\r\ndecomposition of the acetates by Kolbe and the discovery of\r\n_zinc-ethyl_ by Frankland afforded powerful support to the doctrine of\r\ncombined radicals.\r\n\r\nAlthough there can be no doubt that this doctrine greatly stimulated\r\nthe pursuit of organic chemistry, it was gradually perceived that to\r\nregard inorganic and organic chemistry as the chemistry respectively of\r\nthe simple and of the compound radicals was an imperfect and misleading\r\nconception of the true relations of the two main divisions of the\r\nscience. Facts showed that the properties of a substance depend more\r\non the arrangement of its atoms than on their nature. The doctrine of\r\ncompound radicals was implicitly an attempt to extend the dualistic\r\nconceptions of Berzelius to the facts of organic chemistry; and as such\r\nit was welcomed by the great Swedish chemist. But dualism was found to\r\nhave its limitations, even in inorganic chemistry; and these were still\r\nmore apparent when it was sought to apply it in the other main branch\r\nof the science. Attempts were therefore made—notably by the French\r\nchemists Laurent, Dumas, and Gerhardt—to formulate organic substances\r\nby methods in which the electro-chemical and dualistic conceptions of\r\nBerzelius and his followers had no part. How these attempts developed,\r\nand how they subsequently grew into the organic chemistry of to-day,\r\nwill be shown in the second part of this work.\r\n\r\nIt will be convenient also to delay any account of the personal history\r\nof the creators of the science of organic chemistry—Liebig, Wöhler,\r\nDumas—until we are in a position to give a fuller statement of their\r\nlabours, and of the results which flowed from them. Although the\r\nfoundations of organic chemistry may be said to have been laid during\r\nthe closing years of the first half of the nineteenth century, the\r\nsuperstructure was not erected until the second half.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nTHE RISE OF PHYSICAL CHEMISTRY\r\n\r\n\r\nPhysics and Chemistry are twin sisters—daughters of Natural Philosophy;\r\nlike Juno’s swans, coupled and inseparable. Physics is concerned\r\nwith the forms of energy which affect matter; chemistry with the\r\nstudy of matter so affected. Each, then, is complementary to the\r\nother. Philosophers of old drew no practical distinction between\r\nthem, at least as regards their own studies. Men like Boyle, Black,\r\nCavendish, Lavoisier, Dalton, Faraday, Graham, Bunsen, were pioneers\r\n“on a very broad gauge,” pushing their inquiries into territories\r\ncommon to the two branches as their genius or inclinations directed\r\nthem. Accordingly, it has happened that many so-called physical laws\r\nhave been discovered by men who were professed chemists. It has also\r\nhappened that men who began their scientific career as chemists, like\r\nDalton, Regnault, and Magnus, eventually gave the whole of their\r\nenergies to physical measurements; or, like Black, Faraday, and\r\nGraham, devoted themselves to the elucidation of physical problems. As\r\ncertain of these physical laws and problems have greatly influenced\r\nthe progress of chemistry, it becomes necessary, in any historical\r\ntreatment of the subject, to give some account of their origin, and to\r\nshow how they affected the development of chemical theory.\r\n\r\nThe relations of heat to chemical phenomena are so obvious and so\r\nintimate that the study of their connection necessarily attracted\r\nattention in very early times. But it was only when this study became\r\nquantitative that any important generalisations became possible.\r\nMost quantitative estimations of heat depend eventually upon the\r\nthermometer; and thermometry is indebted to Englishmen in the first\r\ninstance for attempts to render the instrument trustworthy.\r\n\r\nIn this connection may be mentioned the names of Newton and Shuckburgh.\r\nBrooke Taylor, in 1723, made a special study of the mercurial\r\nthermometer as a measurer of temperature. In other words, he sought\r\nto discover whether equal differences of expansion or contraction of\r\nmercury corresponded to equal additions or abstractions of heat. The\r\nresults showed that the principle of the mercurial thermometer is valid\r\nwithin at least the limits of temperature between the boiling and\r\nfreezing-points of water. These experiments were subsequently repeated\r\nand confirmed by Cavendish, and, independently, by Black.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the phenomenon of _latent heat_ by Black some time\r\nprior to 1760 marks an epoch in the history of science. It was then for\r\nthe first time clearly recognised that the state of aggregation of a\r\nsubstance is associated with a definite thermal quantity, and that, in\r\norder to effect a change, a definite amount of energy, in the form of\r\nheat, must be employed. The quantitative connection that exists between\r\nwork and energy was thus foreshadowed.\r\n\r\nThe doctrine of _specific heat_ was taught by Black in his lectures\r\nat Glasgow between 1761 and 1765. The subject was subsequently\r\ninvestigated experimentally by Irvine between 1765 and 1770, and by\r\nCrawford in 1779. A series of determinations was published in 1781 by\r\nWilcke, in the _Transactions_ of the Swedish Academy. In these the\r\nterm _specific caloric_, since changed to _specific heat_, was first\r\nused. About this time the determination of the amount of heat required\r\nto raise substances through a definite interval of temperature was\r\nmade the subject of experiment by many observers, notably by Lavoisier\r\nand Laplace, who greatly improved the calorimetric arrangements. The\r\nvalues they obtained long remained the most trustworthy estimations of\r\nthe specific heats of substances. Their joint research had a further\r\ninfluence on the development of thermo-chemistry by indicating the\r\ngeneral experimental conditions which were needed to ensure accuracy\r\nin such determinations. Lavoisier and Laplace also measured, in\r\n1782–1783, the heat disengaged by the combustion of substances, and\r\nthat evolved during respiration. In 1819 Dulong and Petit pointed out\r\nthat the specific heat of a number of substances, more particularly the\r\nmetals, were inversely proportional to their atomic weights; or, in\r\nother words, the product of the specific heat into the atomic weight\r\nwas a constant. The nature of the relation will be seen from the\r\nfollowing table of certain of the results obtained by Dulong and Petit:—\r\n\r\n    Element.  At. wt.  Spec. heat.  Atomic heat.\r\n\r\n    Bismuth     208      0.0288         6.0\r\n    Lead        207      0.0293         6.0\r\n    Gold        197      0.0298         5.8\r\n    Platinum    195      0.0314         6.1\r\n    Silver      108      0.0570         6.1\r\n    Copper       63      0.0952         6.0\r\n    Iron         56      0.1138         6.4\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that these various elements have an uniform, or nearly\r\nuniform, atomic heat—approximately 6.2 on the average.\r\n\r\nThis would appear to prove that, as Dulong and Petit expressed\r\nit, “the atoms of simple substances have equal capacities for\r\nheat.” The variations from a constant value are due partly to\r\nerrors of observation, but more particularly to the circumstance\r\nthat the substances compared are not all in a strictly comparable\r\ncondition—_e.g._, they are not all equally remote from their melting\r\npoints. It was shown, moreover, that the amount of heat needed to raise\r\na substance through a definite interval of temperature increased with\r\nthe temperature. The range of temperature through which a determination\r\nwas made in a particular instance affected, therefore, the value of\r\nthe specific heat. The most noteworthy departures from a uniform value\r\nwere observed to occur among the metalloids—_e.g._, carbon, the various\r\nmodifications of which had different specific heats—and generally among\r\nelements of low atomic weight, in which the variation of specific heat\r\nwith temperature was particularly rapid.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, the significance of the generalisation discovered by\r\nDulong and Petit, in spite of its limitations, was quickly appreciated,\r\nas it was perceived that a knowledge of the specific heat of an element\r\nmight be of great value in determining its atomic weight. The immediate\r\neffect was that a certain number of the atomic weights fixed by\r\nBerzelius mainly on chemical considerations were required to be halved.\r\nAlthough subsequent experience has proved that the law of Dulong and\r\nPetit is not capable of the simple mathematical expression they gave\r\nit, it has shown itself to be of great value in fixing doubtful atomic\r\nweights.\r\n\r\n=Pierre Louis Dulong= was born in 1785 at Rouen, and, after studying\r\nchemistry and physics at the Polytechnic School at Paris, became its\r\nProfessor of Chemistry and subsequently its Professor of Physics.\r\nIn 1830 he was made its Director of Studies; and in 1832 he became\r\npermanent Secretary of the Academy of Sciences. As a young man he\r\nworked with Berzelius, with whom he made the first approximately\r\naccurate determination of the gravimetric composition of water. In\r\n1811 he discovered the highly explosive _nitrogen chloride_, in the\r\ninvestigation of which he was severely injured, losing an eye and\r\nseveral fingers. He died in 1838. His collaborator, =Alexis Therese\r\nPetit=, was born in 1791 at Vesoul, and died, when holding the position\r\nof Professor of Physics at the Lycée Bonaparte, in 1820.\r\n\r\nThe attempt made by Neumann to extend Dulong and Petit’s “law” to\r\ncompound substances was only partially successful. Nor has any\r\nimportant generalisation followed from our knowledge of the specific\r\nheat of liquids. Almost simultaneously with the publication of Dulong\r\nand Petit’s “law,” Mitscherlich made known the fact that similarity\r\nin chemical constitution is frequently accompanied by identity of\r\ncrystalline form. Boyle, as far back as the middle of the seventeenth\r\ncentury, had insisted upon the importance of the forms of crystals\r\nin throwing light upon the internal structure of bodies. Romé de\r\nl’Isle and Hauy had remarked that many different substances had the\r\nsame crystalline form. It had been observed that a crystal of potash\r\nalum would continue to grow and preserve its shape in a solution of\r\nammonia alum; and similar observations had been shown to occur in\r\nthe case of vitriols. The invention of the reflecting goniometer by\r\nWollaston greatly facilitated the investigation of such phenomena.\r\nMitscherlich showed that the phosphates and arseniates of analogous\r\ncomposition had the same crystalline shape, or, in other words, were\r\nisomorphous. The same fact was observed to occur in the case of the\r\nanalogously constituted sulphates and selenates, and in that of the\r\noxides of magnesium and zinc, etc. The value of isomorphous relations\r\nin determining the group-relationships of the elements and in deducing\r\nthe composition of salts was at once recognised by Berzelius, who\r\nstyled the discovery of isomorphism by his pupil Mitscherlich as “the\r\nmost important since the establishment of the doctrine of chemical\r\nproportions.” The quantities of the isomorphously replacing elements in\r\na compound were regarded by him as a measure of their atomic weights;\r\nand the principle was subsequently constantly employed by him, whenever\r\npossible, as a criterion in fixing their values. Other investigators\r\nhave followed his example in this respect; and isomorphism is still\r\nregarded as an important consideration in establishing the genetic\r\nrelations of an element.\r\n\r\n=Eilhard Mitscherlich=, the son of a minister, was born in 1794 at\r\nNeu Ende, near Jever, in Oldenburg, and, after studying philology\r\nand oriental languages at Heidelberg, went to Paris, and thence to\r\nGöttingen, where he occupied himself with natural science. In 1818\r\nhe repaired to Berlin and commenced to work on the arseniates and\r\nphosphates, the similarity in the crystal-forms of which he was the\r\nfirst to detect. His friend Gustav Rose, the mineralogist, thereupon\r\ninstructed him in the methods of crystallography; to enable him to\r\nverify his discovery and to establish it by goniometric measurements.\r\nIn 1821 he joined Berzelius at Stockholm, where he pursued his\r\ninquiries on the connection between crystal-form and chemical\r\ncomposition. It was at the suggestion of Berzelius that he adopted the\r\nterm “isomorphy” to express this connection—the mechanical consequence\r\nof identity of atomic constitution. In the same year he was appointed\r\nKlaproth’s successor in Berlin, where he died in 1863.\r\n\r\nMitscherlich also worked on the manganates and permanganates, on\r\nselenic acid, on benzene and its derivatives, and on the artificial\r\nproduction of minerals.\r\n\r\nThe study of the physical phenomena of gases, initiated in 1660\r\nby Boyle’s discovery of the law of gaseous pressure, has greatly\r\ncontributed to our knowledge of their intrinsic nature. Boyle himself\r\nonly proved his law in the case of atmospheric air; but the observation\r\nwas subsequently (1676) generalised by Marriotte. Charles, Dalton,\r\nand Gay Lussac independently showed that gases have the same rate of\r\nthermal expansion.\r\n\r\nThat gases are made up of particles possessing an internal movement was\r\nsurmised by the Greeks; but experimental evidence for such a view of\r\ntheir constitution was first presented by Thomas Graham in 1829–1831,\r\nwhen he discovered that gases move, or are diffused, at rates inversely\r\nproportional to the square roots of their densities. Observations of a\r\nlike character, which found their explanation in Graham’s discovery,\r\nhad previously been made by Priestley, Döbereiner, and Saussure. This\r\ninterchange in the position of their particles is a property inherent\r\nin gases. Inequality of density is not essential to diffusion. Graham\r\nproved this by connecting together two vessels, one containing nitrogen\r\nand the other carbonic oxide, which have the same density. After the\r\nexpiration of a certain time both gases were found to be uniformly\r\ndiffused through the vessels.\r\n\r\nHow these laws were found to be interdependent and mutually connected,\r\nand how they led up to a molecular theory of gases which serves\r\nto explain them, as well as certain other gaseous phenomena to be\r\nsubsequently noted, will be shown in the second part of this work.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the period with which we are concerned—that is, the\r\nmiddle of the nineteenth century—a considerable body of information had\r\nbeen accumulated as to the conditions which determine the different\r\nstates of aggregation of matter—that is, the conditions which allow of\r\nthe passage of the gaseous state into that of the liquid, and of the\r\nliquid into that of the solid. That the same substance was capable of\r\nexistence in the three states of gas, liquid, and solid was of course\r\nevident from the case of water. Even the most primitive races must\r\nhave realised that steam, dew, rain, snow, hail, and ice were only\r\nmodifications of one and the same substance. As knowledge increased,\r\nother substances came to be known which resembled water in their\r\ncapacity for existence in various physical states. It was but natural\r\nto assume that this was a general attribute, and that all substances\r\nwould, sooner or later, be found capable of existence in each of the\r\ndifferent conditions of aggregation.\r\n\r\nAttempts were made during the first quarter of the last century to\r\nprove that all the æriform bodies then known were simply vapours\r\nmore or less remote from their point of liquefaction, and still\r\nfurther removed from their point of congelation. Monge and Clouet\r\ncondensed sulphur dioxide some time before 1800; and Northmore,\r\nin 1805, liquefied chlorine. But these observations attracted\r\nlittle attention until Faraday, in 1823, independently effected the\r\nliquefaction of chlorine, and Davy that of hydrochloric acid. Faraday\r\nalmost immediately afterwards liquefied sulphur dioxide, sulphuretted\r\nhydrogen, carbon dioxide, euchlorine, nitrous oxide, cyanogen, and\r\nammonia.\r\n\r\nOther experimenters, among whom may be mentioned Thilorier and\r\nNatterer, greatly improved the mechanical appliances for liquefying\r\nthese gases; liquid carbonic acid and nitrous oxide were obtained\r\nin considerable quantities, and employed in the production of cold.\r\nCertain of the gases—hydrogen, oxygen, nitrogen, nitric oxide, carbonic\r\noxide, etc.—resisted all attempts to liquefy them; and hence gaseous\r\nsubstances came to be classified as _permanent_ and _non-permanent_,\r\ndepending upon whether they could or could not be liquefied. The\r\ndivision was felt to be irrational even at the time it was made. There\r\nseemed no _à priori_ reason why carbon dioxide and nitrous oxide should\r\nbe liquefiable, while carbonic oxide and nitric oxide should resist\r\nall attempts to coerce them into changing their state. The real clue\r\nto the conditions required to effect the liquefaction of a gas was\r\nnot discovered until nearly half a century later, when, as will be\r\nshown subsequently, the arbitrary division of gases into permanent and\r\nnon-permanent was swept away.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of the law of gaseous combination by Gay Lussac, and the\r\nrecognition by Ampère and Avogadro of the relation between the density\r\nof a gas or a vapour and its atomic weight, early led to improvements\r\nin the methods of determining the absolute weights of gases and\r\nvapours, especially by French chemists. Both Gay Lussac and Dumas\r\ndevised processes for determining vapour densities which were in use\r\nuntil late in the century, and which, although now superseded by more\r\nconvenient and more rapid modifications afforded valuable information\r\nconcerning the molecular weights of substances and the phenomena of\r\ngaseous dissociation.\r\n\r\nDuring the first decade of the nineteenth century Dalton and Henry\r\ndiscovered the simple law which connects pressure with the solubility\r\nof a gas in any solvent upon which it exerts no specific action. Dalton\r\nfurther developed the law so as to include the absorption by a solvent\r\nof the several constituents of a gaseous mixture.\r\n\r\nAttempts were made by Schröder, Kopp, and others, to discover\r\nrelations between the weights of unit volumes of liquids and solids\r\nand their chemical nature; but such attempts were only partially\r\nsuccessful, owing to the difficulty of finding valid conditions\r\nof comparison. By comparing the specific gravities of liquids\r\nat their boiling-points Kopp succeeded in detecting a number of\r\nregularities among their specific volumes which seem to indicate that\r\na comprehensive generalisation connecting them may yet be discovered.\r\nKopp has also shown that regularities exist among the boiling-points\r\nof correlated substances, and that there is an interdependence between\r\nthe temperature of their ebullition and the chemical characters of\r\ncompounds.\r\n\r\nThis short summary will suffice to show that attempts to discover\r\nrelations between the physical attributes of substances and their\r\nchemical nature were made more or less sporadically from the time\r\nthat chemistry was pursued in the spirit of science. But it is only\r\nin recent times that any great accession to knowledge has resulted\r\nfrom such efforts. The science of physical chemistry is practically a\r\ncreation of our own period. Its systematic study may be said to date\r\nonly from the last quarter of the nineteenth century, since which time\r\nit has made extraordinary progress. Its broad features will be dealt\r\nwith in the second volume of this work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBIBLIOGRAPHY\r\n\r\nRELATING TO THE PERIOD COVERED BY VOL.
