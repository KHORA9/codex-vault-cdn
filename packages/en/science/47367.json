ROBERT THOMPSON,\r\n                   FOR\r\n  THE IMPORTANT SERVICES HE HAS RENDERED TO THE\r\n           STUDY OF POMOLOGY\r\n                 AND FOR\r\n  HIS UNWEARIED LABORS IN DETERMINING AND ARRANGING\r\n         POMOLOGICAL NOMENCLATURE.\r\n                THIS WORK\r\n      IS DEDICATED BY HIS SINCERE FRIEND,\r\n                THE AUTHOR.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is much to be regretted, that of late years, so little attention has\r\nbeen given in this country, to the study of pomology, and that so few\r\nefforts have been made to encourge a taste for this most important,\r\nmost instructive, and intellectual branch of horticultural science.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the last, and beginning of the present century, when\r\nthe late Mr. Knight was in the full vigor of his scientific pursuits,\r\nthis was the subject which engaged so much of his powerful intellect,\r\nand from which he succeeded in producing such great and beneficial\r\nresults. With Mr. Knight as president, and Mr. Sabine as secretary,\r\nthe Horticultural Society of London did much for the advancement of\r\nthis subject, and in extending a knowledge not only of the fruits of\r\nthis country, but of the most valuable varieties of the continent of\r\nEurope, and America. Through the exertions of these gentlemen, and in\r\nconjunction with the illustrious pomologists, Dr. Diel and Professor\r\nVan Mons, and other eminent continental correspondents, was obtained\r\nthat vast collection of fruits which once existed in the Society’s\r\ngarden; and by means of which that great undertaking of determining and\r\narranging the nomenclature was accomplished. During this period the\r\nSociety’s Transactions teemed with rich, and interesting pomological\r\npapers, and several works of a high character were ushered into\r\nexistence. Of these the most important were the Pomonas of Brookshaw\r\nand Hooker, the Pomological Magazine, and Ronalds’s Pyrus Malus\r\nBrentfordiensis; but these are all of such a class, as from their great\r\ncost to be regarded more as works of art, than of general utility. The\r\nonly one which was at all calculated to be of general benefit was,\r\nLindley’s “Guide to the Orchard;” a work which furnished descriptions\r\nof, and embraced a greater number of varieties than had hitherto been\r\nattempted. This then may be regarded as the most complete work for\r\ngeneral reference, with which pomologists in this country had ever been\r\nfurnished.\r\n\r\nUpwards of twenty years have now elapsed since the “Guide to the\r\nOrchard” issued from the press, and during that period, Knight, Sabine,\r\nand many great patrons of pomology have entered into their rest,\r\nleaving none behind them to prosecute, with the same vigour, that\r\nstudy which they so much loved and adorned. But although there has\r\nbeen no corporate effort to promote and stimulate this study, private\r\nenterprize has not altogether been awanting to keep pace with the rapid\r\nprogression of the Continent and America; but for this, we might yet\r\nhave been in total ignorance of many of the most desirable fruits of\r\nmodern times, and particularly of those valuable varieties, the result\r\nof the later labors of Van Mons, Esperen, and others; together with\r\nseveral of considerable merit, furnished by the fertile pomology of the\r\nNew World.\r\n\r\nSince the publication of Lindley’s “Guide,” therefore, there has\r\nnot only been such additions to our varieties of fruits, but such a\r\ncomplete reformation and arrangement of pomological nomenclature as\r\nto have rendered that book, as a work of reference of considerably\r\nless value; and it was on account of the necessity for a new work,\r\nadapted to the wants of the present day, and embracing the most\r\nrecent information on the subject, that I entered upon the present\r\nundertaking. The facilities I have possessed for carrying it out,\r\nare perhaps greater than fall to the lot of most men. My earliest\r\nassociations were with fruits and fruit trees; the greater part of my\r\nactive life has been engaged in their cultivation and devoted to their\r\nstudy; and for nearly ten years, I had the advantage of making an\r\nannual tour throughout the length and breadth of England and Scotland,\r\nduring which, I allowed no opportunity to escape of making myself\r\nacquainted with the fruits of the various districts, and securing\r\ncorrespondents to whom I could apply, in cases of necessity. With these\r\nadvantages, I some years ago established an orchard, for the purpose of\r\nexamining the distinctive characters and determining the nomenclature\r\nof fruits; and there I have succeeded, in securing all the varieties it\r\nis possible to procure, either in this country or abroad, and thereby\r\nto obtain from personal observation all the information attainable on\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nIn the execution of this work, my object has been, not to give a mere\r\nselection of the best varieties of fruits cultivated in this country,\r\nbut to describe minutely, and at length, all the varieties with their\r\nessential characters, distinguishing those which are, and those which\r\nare not worthy of cultivation. I have endeavoured to embrace all the\r\nfruits which are recorded as existing in Great Britain, and although it\r\ncannot be supposed I have been able to obtain the whole of them, still,\r\nI have secured such a number as will leave but a very small portion\r\nun-noticed. The plan which I have adopted in the general arrangement\r\nwill be found to embrace all matters both descriptive, historical,\r\nand critical, touching the several varieties. The nomenclature I have\r\nfollowed is, except in some instances for reasons given, that of the\r\nLondon Horticultural Society’s Catalogue, a valuable work prepared by\r\nthat patient and indefatigable pomologist, Mr. Robert Thompson. The\r\nadvantage of this identity of nomenclature is evident, as it sets at\r\nrest that mass of confusion, which so long existed as to the correct\r\nnames of fruits. In describing each variety, the approved name, that\r\nis the name which shall serve as a standard by which that variety\r\nshall in future be distinguished, is printed in Roman Capitals; and\r\neither abbreviated, or in full length, is annexed the name of the\r\nauthor who first records or describes it. When the variety is of such\r\nantiquity as not to be identified with any particular author, the\r\nname of the one who first distinctly describes it is given. Following\r\nthe standard name, is the identification or list of works in which the\r\nvariety is identified as being described; the synonymes or names by\r\nwhich it is mentioned in all works on pomology, or known in various\r\ndistricts; and then a list of works in which it is most correctly and\r\nfaithfully figured. Then follow the description, history, and critical\r\nobservations, when such are necessary. I have furnished diagrams, of\r\nthe newest, rarest, and most esteemed varieties; and this mode of\r\nillustration conveys a better idea of the general character of the\r\nfruit, than a fore-shortened drawing, and answers the same purpose as\r\na highly finished engraving, without swelling the price of the work to\r\nsuch an extent, as to render it unavailable for ordinary use. At the\r\nend, I have given lists of the most excellent varieties adapted for\r\nvarious districts of the country, as also such as are suited for being\r\ngrown as Standards, Dwarfs, and for Cyder. The whole work is terminated\r\nby a copious index, which includes all the synonymes, and which of\r\nitself, will afford much valuable assistance, in all matters relating\r\nto pomological nomenclature.\r\n\r\nIt now remains for me to acknowledge the favors I have received from\r\nmany kind friends, who have, by furnishing materials and information,\r\nrendered me much valuable assistance. To Mr. Robert Thompson, already\r\nmentioned, I am particularly indebted for the liberal way in which\r\nhe has always supplied me with any information I required. To the\r\nlate Mr. John Ronalds, of Brentford, for the free use of his valuable\r\ncollection; as also to his excellent and much respected foreman,\r\nMr. William Waring. To Mr. James Lake, nurseryman, of Bridgewater,\r\nfor specimens of, and communications respecting the fruits of the\r\nSomerset, Devon, and West of England orchards. To Mr. William\r\nFairbread, of Green-street, near Sittingbourne, for those of the\r\ngreat orchard districts of Kent. To Mr. Mannington, of Uckfield, and\r\nMr. Henry Barton, of Heathfield, Sussex, for the fruits of these\r\nneighbourhoods. To Mr. J. C. Wheeler, of Gloucester, and the late\r\nMr. Hignell, orchardist, of Tewkesbury. To George Jefferies, Esq.,\r\nof Marlborough Terrace, Kensington, for some of the valuable fruits\r\nof Norfolk; and to the Rev. Henry Manton, of Sleaford. To Mr. Roger\r\nHargreave, of Lancaster, for a complete collection from the Lancashire\r\norchards. To Archibald Turnbull, Esq., of Belwood, near Perth, whose\r\nchoice and extensive collection, was freely placed at my disposal.\r\nTo Mr. A. Gorrie, of Annat, and Robert Mathew, Esq., of Gourdiehill,\r\nin the Carse of Gowrie, for much valuable information, and specimens\r\nof the fruits of that great orchard district of the North. To Mr.\r\nEvans, superintendent of the Caledonian Horticultural Society’s\r\nGarden, Edinburgh, for much valuable assistance derived from a free\r\ninspection of the collection of the Society. To my brother, Mr. Thomas\r\nHogg, of Coldstream, for the fruits of the Tweedside orchards, and to\r\nnumerous nurserymen and private individuals, who have aided me in the\r\nprosecution of this work, I now tender my warmest and heartfelt thanks.\r\n\r\n                                                              R.

ETC.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE APPLE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no fruit, in temperate climates, so universally esteemed,\r\nand so extensively cultivated, nor is there any which is so closely\r\nidentified with the social habits of the human species as the apple.\r\nApart from the many domestic purposes to which it is applicable,\r\nthe facility of its cultivation, and its adaptation to almost every\r\nlatitude, have rendered it, in all ages, an object of special attention\r\nand regard. There is no part of our island where one or other of its\r\nnumerous varieties is not cultivated, and few localities where the\r\nfinest cannot be brought to perfection.\r\n\r\nThe apple is a native of this, as well as almost every other country\r\nin Europe. Its normal form is the Common Wild Crab, the _Pyrus Malus_\r\nof Linnæus, and the numerous varieties with which our gardens and\r\norchards abound, are the result either of the natural tendency of\r\nthat tree to variation, or by its varieties being hybridized with\r\nthe original species, or with each other. It belongs to the natural\r\norder _Rosaceæ_, section _Pomeæ_, and is, by botanists, included in\r\nthe same genus as the pear. The principal difference between apples\r\nand pears, when considered botanically, consists in their stamens and\r\nstyles; the stamens of the apple have their filaments straight, united\r\ntogether at the base, and forming a bundle round the styles, of which\r\nthey conceal the inferior part. All the filaments of the pear on the\r\ncontrary are divergent, disposed almost like the radii of a wheel, and\r\nleave the bases of the styles entirely naked and exposed. The styles\r\nin the apple are united at their base into one body, and are generally\r\nvillous in that part where they adhere to each other: in the pear,\r\nhowever, they are separate at their base. But although the apple and\r\npear very much resemble each other in their botanical characters, they\r\ndiffer very materially in their form, cellular tissue, and specific\r\ngravity. Apples have always the base umbellicate, or hollowed with\r\na deep cavity, in which the stalk is inserted, and are generally\r\nspherical. The pear, on the other hand, is elongated towards the stalk,\r\nand is generally of a pyramidal shape, or nearly so. The cellular\r\ntissue of the apple, according to the microscopical observations\r\nof Turpin, is composed of a great number of agglomerated, distinct\r\nvesicles, each existing independent of the other, varying in size in\r\nthe same fruit, and, in general, larger, as the apple is large and\r\nlight. These vesicles are colorless and transparent, and vary in their\r\nform according to the want of space requisite for their individual\r\ndevelopment. They contain in greater or less abundance, a sugary, acid,\r\nor bitter juice, which is perceivable in the different varieties. The\r\ncellular tissue of the apple possesses no stony concretions, and its\r\nspecific gravity is greater than that of the pear; so much so, that by\r\ntaking a cube of each, of equal size, and throwing them into a vessel\r\nof water, that of the apple will float, while that of the pear will\r\nsink. In its natural or wild state the apple tree is of a small size,\r\nattaining generally about twenty feet in height, of a crooked habit of\r\ngrowth, with small, harsh, and austere fruit, and small thin leaves.\r\nBut when improved by cultivation, it loses much of its original form,\r\nassumes a more free and luxuriant growth, with larger, thicker, and\r\nmore downy leaves, and produces fruit distinguished for its size,\r\ncolor, and richness of flavor.\r\n\r\nSome authors have ascribed the introduction of the apple into this\r\ncountry to the Romans, and others to the Normans; in both cases,\r\nhowever, without any evidence or well grounded authority. Mr. Loudon\r\nsays, “The apple was, in all probability, introduced into Britain\r\nby the Romans, as well as the pear; and like that fruit, perhaps,\r\nre-introduced by the heads of religious houses on their establishment,\r\nafter the introduction of christianity.”[A] It is more probable that\r\nit has existed as an indigenous tree throughout all ages, and that\r\nthe most ancient varieties were accidental variations of the original\r\nspecies, with which the forests abounded. These being cultivated, and\r\nsubjected to the art and industry of man, would give rise to other\r\nvarieties, and thus a gradual amelioration of the fruit would be\r\nobtained. The earliest records make mention of the apple in the most\r\nfamiliar terms. That it was known to the ancient Britons, before the\r\narrival of the Romans is evident from their language. In Celtic, it is\r\ncalled _Abhall_, or _Abhal_; in Welch, _Avall_; in Armoric, _Afall_\r\nand _Avall_; in Cornish, _Aval_ and _Avel_. The word is derived from\r\nthe pure Celtic, _ball_, signifying any round body.[B] The ancient\r\nGlastonbury was called by the Britons Ynys Avallaç, and Ynys Avallon,\r\nwhich signify an apple orchard,[C] and from this its Roman name\r\n_Avallonia_ was derived. The apple must therefore have been known in\r\nBritain before the arrival of the Romans; and that it continued to\r\nexist after they left the island, and before the Norman conquest, is\r\ncertified by William of Malmesbury, who says, that King Edgar in 973,\r\nwhile hunting in a wood was left alone by his associates; in this\r\nsituation he was overcome by an irresistable desire to sleep, and\r\nalighting from his horse he lay down under the shade of a _wild apple\r\ntree_.[D] Shortly after the Norman conquest, the same author writes\r\nwith reference to Gloucestershire. “Cernas tramites publicos vestitos\r\npomiferis arboribus, non insitiva manus industria, sed ipsius solius\r\nhumi natura.” Some writers[E] entertain the popular error that the\r\ncultivation of apples was not a branch of rural economy in England\r\nbefore Richard Harris planted orchards in several parts of Kent, in the\r\nreign of Henry the Eighth; but there is evidence to the contrary. In\r\na bull of Pope Alexander the Third, in the year 1175, confirming the\r\nproperty belonging to the monastery of Winchcombe, in Gloucestershire,\r\nis mentioned, “The town of Twining with all the lands, _orchards_,\r\nmeadows, &c.;”[F] and in a charter of King John, granting property to\r\nthe priory of Lanthony, near Gloucester, is mentioned “the church\r\nof Herdesley, with twelve acres of land, _and an orchard_.”[G] But\r\nits cultivation was not confined to the southern counties, for we\r\nfind there was an extensive manufacture of cider as far north as\r\nRichmond, in Yorkshire, in the early part of the thirteenth century.\r\nIt would be too much to say that all the varieties cultivated at an\r\nearly period, were indigenous to this country; many no doubt, were\r\nintroduced at the Norman conquest, and it is probable that in the\r\nmiddle ages some varieties were introduced from the continent, by\r\nmembers of the different religious houses which then existed, who not\r\nunfrequently had personal intercourse with France, and who devoted\r\nconsiderable attention to horticulture; but there is every reason to\r\nbelieve that the earliest varieties were native productions. The oldest\r\nworks which treat on the cultivation of fruits, afford little or no\r\ninformation as to these early varieties. In some ancient documents of\r\nthe twelfth century, we find the Pearmain[H] and Costard mentioned,\r\nbut the horticultural works of the period are too much occupied with\r\nthe fallacies and nonsense which distinguish those of the Roman\r\nagricultural writers, to convey to us any knowledge of the early\r\npomology of this country. Turner in his Herbal, has no record of any of\r\nthe varieties, and simply states, in reference to the apple, “I nede\r\nnot to descrybe thys tre, because it is knowen well inoughe in all\r\ncountres.” Barnaby Googe mentions as, “Chiefe in price, the Pippin, the\r\nRomet, the Pomeroyall, the Marigold, with a great number of others that\r\nwere too long to speake of.” Leonarde Mascal gives instruction how “to\r\ngraffe the Quyne Apple;” but that is the only variety he mentions. In\r\na note book in the possession of Sir John Trevelyan, of Nettlecombe,\r\nnear Taunton, which was kept by one of his ancestors, from the year\r\n1580 to 1584, is an entry of “The names of Apelles, which I had their\r\ngraffes from Brentmarch, from one Mr. Pace--_Item_, the Appell out\r\nof Essex; Lethercott, or Russet Apell; Lounden Peppen; Kew Goneling,\r\nor the Croke; Glass Appell or Pearmeane; Red Stear; Nemes Appell, or\r\nGrenlinge; Bellabone; Appell out of Dorsettsher; Domine quo Vadis.” In\r\n“The Husbandman’s Fruitfull Orchard,” we have Pippins, Pearemains,\r\nJohn Apples, Winter Russetings, and Leather Coats. Gerard enumerates\r\nand figures “The Pome Water, the Baker’s Ditch, the King of Apples, the\r\nQuining or Queene of Apples, the Sommer Pearemaine,” and “the Winter\r\nPearemaine;” and he says, “I have seene in the pastures and hedgerowes\r\nabout the grounds of a worshippfull gentleman, dwelling two miles from\r\nHereford, called _M. Roger Bednome_, so many trees of all sortes, that\r\nthe seruants drinke for the most part no other drinke, but that which\r\nis made of Apples. The quantitie is such, that by the report of the\r\ngentleman himselfe, the parson hath for tithe many hogsheads of Syder.”\r\n\r\n[A] Arb.

Hartlib mentions one who\r\nhad 200 sorts of apples, and was of opinion that 500 sorts existed.\r\nRea, in his Pomona, enumerates twenty varieties, sixteen of which are\r\nnot mentioned by Parkinson; and Meager gives a list of eighty-three,\r\nwhich were cultivated in the Brompton Park, and some other nurseries\r\nround London, of which fifty-one are not found in the lists of either\r\nParkinson or Rea. Worlidge mentions ninety-two, which are chiefly\r\ncider fruits. The seventy-seven varieties of Ray are much the same as\r\nthose enumerated by Worlidge. During the last century, the writings\r\nof Switzer, Langley, Hitt, Miller, and Abercrombie, added little to\r\nwhat have already been noticed, except that Switzer first mentions\r\nthe Nonpareil; and it is to Forsyth that we are indebted for a more\r\nextended knowledge of the different varieties, then known to exist in\r\nthis country. With Thomas Andrew Knight, Esq., the first President of\r\nthe London Horticultural Society, a new era in the history of pomology\r\ncommenced, and during his lifetime there was more attention devoted to\r\nthis study, than had been since the days of Evelyn and De Quintinye.\r\nIt was with this zealous horticulturist, that a practical application\r\nof the discovery of the sexes of plants, was first systematically\r\ncarried into operation; and the success which attended his labors in\r\nhybridization, is evinced by the many valuable varieties of fruits\r\nwhich he was the means of producing. Through the exertions of this\r\ngentleman, and his illustrious cotemporaries, Sabine, Williams, and\r\nBraddick, the gardens of the Horticultural Society, became a depository\r\nfor all the varieties which could be gathered together from all parts\r\nof Europe and America, and the result has been, that in the last\r\nedition of the Society’s Catalogue, Mr. Thompson has enumerated upwards\r\nof 1400 varieties of the apple alone, the greater portion of which,\r\nhowever, are proved to be unworthy of cultivation for any purpose\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\nThe apple is a very wholesome fruit. In its raw state it is highly\r\nesteemed in the dessert, and when either roasted, boiled, or in pies,\r\nit forms an excellent and nutritious food. Dr. Johnson says he knew a\r\nclergyman, of small income, who brought up a family very reputably,\r\nwhich he chiefly fed on apple dumplings! Administered to invalids it\r\nis cooling, refreshing, and laxative. It is well known as furnishing\r\nan excellent sauce; and apple jelly forms one of the finest preserves.\r\nNorfolk Beefings are that variety of apple baked in ovens, after the\r\nbread is drawn, and flattened to the form in which they are sold in the\r\nshops of the confectioners and fruiterers. In Normandy and America,\r\napples are to a considerable extent dried in the sun, in which state\r\nthey may be preserved for a long period and used at pleasure, when\r\nthey form an excellent dish stewed with sugar, cloves, and other\r\nspices. Those dried in America are cut into quarters, while those of\r\nNormandy are preserved whole. There is a drink with which our ancestors\r\nwere wont to regale themselves called _Lambs-wool_, or more properly\r\n_Lamasool_, a word derived from _La maes Abhal_, which signifies the\r\nday of apple fruit. This drink was composed of ale and the pulp of\r\nroasted apples, with sugar and spice. It is mentioned by Gerard, and in\r\nan old song, called “The King and the Miller,” we find it referred to\r\n\r\n    “A cup of _Lambs-wool_ they drank to him there.”\r\n\r\nBesides these, and many other uses to which the apple is applied, its\r\njuice produces cider, which forms, in many parts of this country, in\r\nNormandy, and the United States, an indispensable beverage. The juice\r\nof the wild species, called crab vinegar, or verjuice, when applied\r\nexternally is good for strains, spasms, and cramps.\r\n\r\nThe chemical composition of the apple is, chlorophylle, sugar, gum,\r\nvegetable fibre, albumen, malic acid, tannin and gallic acid, lime, and\r\na great quantity of water.\r\n\r\nThe apple may be grown on almost any description of soil, provided\r\nit is not absolutely wet. That on which it succeeds best is a humid\r\nsandy loam, or a well-drained strong clay, which if it possesses a\r\ncalcareous, or gravelly subsoil, will be still more advantageous. It\r\nis not requisite that it should be of so great depth as for pears, as\r\nthe apple, having no tap-root, does not penetrate so far into the soil.\r\nFrom eighteen inches to two feet will be found a good depth; but where\r\nthe soil is good, and the subsoil sufficiently humid without being\r\nliterally wet, even a foot to eighteen inches will answer every purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASSIFICATION OF APPLES.\r\n\r\n\r\nA great desideratum in pomological science is, a system of\r\nclassification for the apple, founded on characters which are at once\r\npermanent and well defined. The Germans have been most assiduous\r\nin endeavoring to attain this object, and many systems have been\r\nsuggested, of which those of Manger, Sickler, Christ, and Diel, are\r\nmost generally known. But it is to Diel that the greatest merit is\r\ndue, for having produced a system, which, though far from perfect, is\r\ngreatly in advance of any which had hitherto been produced; and which\r\nhas been universally adopted by all the German pomologists. In 1847,\r\nmy friend Dochnahl, an eminent and assiduous pomologist, published a\r\nsystem, based upon that of Diel, of which it is a modification, and\r\nwhich possesses such advantages over its type, as to be more easily\r\nreduced to practise.\r\n\r\nAs the systems of Diel and Dochnahl, are certainly the best which have\r\nyet appeared, I have introduced them here, for the benefit of those who\r\nmay want a groundwork on which to form an arrangement.\r\n\r\n\r\nDIEL’S CLASSIFICATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS I. RIBBED APPLES.\r\n\r\n1. They are furnished with very prominent, but regular ribs round the\r\neye, extending also over the fruit, but which do not render the shape\r\nirregular.--2. Having wide, open, and very irregular cells.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER I. TRUE CALVILLES.\r\n\r\n1. They taper from about the middle of the fruit towards the eye.--2.\r\nThey are covered with bloom when on the tree.--3. They have, or acquire\r\nby keeping, an unctuous skin.--4. They are not distinctly and purely\r\nstriped.--5. They have light, spongy, delicate flesh.--6. They have a\r\nstrawberry or raspberry flavor.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER II. SCHLOTTERÄPFEL.\r\n\r\n1. The skin does not feel unctuous.--2. They are not covered with\r\nbloom.--3. They are either of a flat, conical, cylindrical, or tapering\r\nform.--4. They have not a balsamic, but mostly a sweetish or sourish\r\nflavor.--5. They have a granulous, loose, and coarse-grained flesh.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER III. GULDERLINGE.\r\n\r\n1. They are not balsamic like Order I., but of an aromatic flavor.--2.\r\nThey have a fine flesh, almost like that of the Reinettes.--3. They are\r\neither of a conical or flat shape.--4. They are most prominently ribbed\r\nround the eye.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS II. ROSENÄPFEL.--ROSE APPLES.\r\n\r\n1. They are covered with blue bloom when on the tree.--2. They have\r\nnot unproportionally large, but often only regular cells.--3. They\r\nemit a pleasant odor when briskly rubbed.--4. The skin does not feel\r\nunctuous.--5. They are handsomely and regularly ribbed round the eye,\r\nand often also over the fruit.--6. They have a tender, loose, spongy,\r\nand mostly fine-grained flesh.--7. They have a fine rose, fennel, or\r\nanise flavor.--8. They are mostly of short duration, and are often only\r\nsummer, or autumn apples.--9. They are mostly striped like a tulip.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER I. FRUIT TAPERING OR OBLONG.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER II. FRUIT ROUND OR FLAT.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS III. RAMBOURS.\r\n\r\n1. They are all large apples, and comprise the largest sorts.--2. They\r\nhave mostly, or almost always, two unequal halves, namely one side\r\nlower than the other.--3. They are constantly furnished with ribs\r\nround the eye, which are broad, rising irregularly the one above the\r\nother, and extending over the fruit, so as to render it irregular in\r\nits shape; they are also compressed and have one side higher than the\r\nother.--4. They are constantly broader than high, and only sometimes\r\nelongated.--5. They have all a loose, coarse-grained, and often very\r\npleasant flesh.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER I. WITH WIDE CELLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER II. WITH NARROW CELLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCLASS IV. REINETTES.\r\n\r\n1. They have a fine-grained, delicate, crisp, firm, or tender\r\nflesh.--2. They are mostly the ideal of a handsome shaped apple; in\r\nthem the convexity or bulge of the middle of the apple, towards the\r\neye, is the same as that towards the stalk, or not much different.--3.\r\nThey are all grey dotted, or have russety patches, or completely\r\ncovered with russet.--4. They have only rarely an unctuous skin.--5.\r\nThey have all the rich, aromatic, sugary, and brisk flavor, which is\r\ncalled the Reinette flavor--6. They decay very readily, and must, of\r\nall apples, hang longest on the tree.--7. The really sweet, and at the\r\nsame time aromatic apples, belong to the Reinettes, only as regards\r\ntheir shape, their russety character, and their fine or firm flesh.--8.\r\nApples with fine, firm, crisp flesh, which cannot of themselves form a\r\nseparate class,--for instance, the Pippins also belong to this class.\r\n\r\n\r\nORDER I.

The period of duration, and the coloring of\r\nfruits, vary to a considerable extent according to circumstances of\r\nsoil, situation, and season; but in the following arrangement, I have\r\nendeavored to embrace those characters which they are most generally\r\nfound to possess.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.

Skin, pale yellow tinged with green,\r\nand covered with delicate russet on the shaded side; but deep yellow\r\ntinged with red, and delicately streaked with livelier red on the side\r\nnext the sun. Eye, small and open, with acute erect segments, set in\r\na narrow, round, and plaited basin. Stalk, varying from half an inch\r\nto an inch long, obliquely inserted in a shallow cavity, and generally\r\nwith a fleshy protuberance on one side of it. Flesh, yellowish, crisp,\r\njuicy, rich, and sugary, with an agreeable and pleasantly perfumed\r\nflavor.\r\n\r\nA dessert apple of first-rate quality; in use from December to\r\nFebruary. It is a large and very handsome variety, and worthy of\r\ngeneral cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe tree is a free and healthy grower, producing long slender shoots,\r\nby which, and its cucullated ovate leaves, it is easily distinguished.\r\nIt is an excellent bearer even in a young state, particularly on the\r\nparadise or doucin stock, and succeeds well as an espalier.\r\n\r\n\r\n3.

Mal. pl. xxxv. f. 1.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFruit, of the largest size, generally about three inches and a half\r\nwide, and from two and three quarters to three inches high; roundish,\r\nand angular on the sides. Skin, greenish yellow on the shaded side,\r\nand tinged with orange next the sun, covered all over with veins, or\r\nreticulations of russet. Eye, open, set in a deep and uneven basin.\r\nStalk, short, inserted in a deep cavity. Flesh, yellowish white, crisp,\r\njuicy, sugary, and briskly flavoured.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the largest and best culinary apples. It comes into use\r\nin the beginning of November and continues till April.\r\n\r\nThe tree is a strong and vigorous grower, very hardy, and an abundant\r\nbearer.\r\n\r\nThis variety is supposed to have been raised by a person of the name\r\nof Shepherd, at Uckfield, in Sussex, and has for many years been\r\nextensively cultivated in that county, under the names of _Shepherd’s\r\nSeedling_, and _Shepherd’s Pippin_, two names by which it is there\r\nmost generally known. Some years ago a Mr. Brooker, of Alfriston,\r\nnear Hailsham, in Sussex, sent specimens of the fruit to the London\r\nHorticultural Society, by whom, being unknown, it was called the\r\n_Alfriston_, a name by which it is now generally known, except in its\r\nnative county. By some it is erroneously called the _Baltimore_ and\r\n_Newtown Pippin_.\r\n\r\n\r\n4. AMERICAN FALL PIPPIN.--H.\r\n\r\n SYNONYME.--Fall Pippin, _Coxe. View_, 109, _Down. Fr.

Skin, yellow tinged with green, and strewed\r\nwith brown dots on the shaded side; but with a tinge of brown, and\r\nnumerous embedded pearly specks on the side next the sun. Eye, large\r\nand open, with broad, flat segments, set in a wide, deep, and rather\r\nangular basin. Stalk, three quarters of an inch long, inserted in a\r\nrather shallow cavity, which is slightly marked with russet. Flesh,\r\nyellowish, slightly tinged with green at the margin, tender, juicy,\r\nsugary, slightly perfumed, and pleasantly flavoured.\r\n\r\nUnlike the majority of American Apples, this comes to great perfection\r\nin this country, and is a valuable and first-rate culinary apple. It is\r\nripe in October and will last till Christmas.\r\n\r\nThis is the true Fall Pippin of the American orchards, and a very\r\ndifferent variety from the Fall Pippin of this country, which is known\r\nby the names of Cobbett’s Fall Pippin, and Reinette Blanche d’Espagne.\r\n\r\n\r\n5.

Skin, thick, smooth, and shining, yellowish green\r\nin the shade, changing to pale yellow as it attains maturity; and deep\r\nglossy red, approaching to crimson, on the side next the sun. Eye,\r\nsmall, set in a rather deep and plaited basin. Stalk, short, and deeply\r\ninserted. Flesh, white, crisp, tender, sweet, very juicy, and slightly\r\nperfumed.\r\n\r\nA beautiful little dessert apple in use from October to April.\r\n\r\nIt should be eaten with the skin on, as it is there that the perfume is\r\ncontained. The skin is very sensitive of shade, and any device may be\r\nformed upon it, by causing pieces of paper, in the form of the design\r\nrequired, to adhere on the side exposed to the sun, before it has\r\nattained its deep red color.\r\n\r\nThe tree is of a pyramidal habit of growth, healthy, and an abundant\r\nbearer. It succeeds well in almost any situation, provided the soil\r\nis rich, loamy, and not too light or dry; and may be grown with equal\r\nsuccess either on the doucin, or crab stock. When worked on the French\r\nparadise it is well adapted for pot culture. The fruit is firmly\r\nattached to the spurs and forcibly resists the effects of high winds.\r\n\r\nIt has been asserted, that this apple was brought from Peloponessus to\r\nRome, by Appius Claudius. Whether this be true or not, there can be no\r\ndoubt it is of great antiquity, as all the oldest authors regard it\r\nas the production of an age prior to their own. Dalechamp and Harduin\r\nare of opinion that it is the Petisia of Pliny; but J. Baptista Porta\r\nconsiders it to be the Appiana of that author, who thus describes it,\r\n“Odor est his cotoneorum magnitudo quæ Claudianis, color rubens.”[I]\r\nFrom this description it is evident that two varieties are referred\r\nto, the Appiana and Claudiana. Such being the case, J. Baptista Porta\r\nsays, “duo sunt apud nos mala, magnitudine, et colore paria, et\r\npreciosa, quorum unum odorem servat cotoneorum, alterum minimè. Quod\r\nodore caret, vulgo dictum _Melo rosa_. Id roseo colore perfusum est,\r\nmira teneritudine et sapore, minimè fugax, pomum magnitudine media,\r\nut facile cum ceteris de principatu certet, nec indignum Claudii\r\nnomine. Hoc Claudianum dicerem.”[J] This Melo Rosa may possibly be the\r\nPomme Rose or Gros Api; and if so, we may infer that the Api is the\r\n_Appiana_, and the Gros Api the _Claudiana_ of Pliny. This, however,\r\nmay be mere conjecture, but as the authority referred to, was a native\r\nof Naples, and may be supposed to know something of the traditionary\r\nassociations of the Roman fruits, I have deemed it advisable to record\r\nhis opinion on the subject. According to Merlet, the Api was first\r\ndiscovered as a wilding in the Forest of Api, in Brittany.\r\n\r\nAlthough mentioned by most of the early continental writers, the Api\r\ndoes not appear to have been known in this country, till towards the\r\nend of the 17th century. It is first mentioned by Worlidge, who calls\r\nit “Pomme Appease, a curious apple, lately propagated; the fruit is\r\nsmall and pleasant, which the Madams of France carry in their pockets,\r\nby reason they yield no unpleasant scent.” Lister, in his “Journey to\r\nParis, 1698,” speaking of this as being one of the apples served up in\r\nthe dessert, says, “Also the Pome d’Apis, which is served here more\r\nfor show than for use; being a small flat apple, very beautiful, and\r\nvery red on one side, and pale or white on the other, and may serve the\r\nladies at their toilets as a pattern to paint by.” De Quintinye calls\r\nit “Une Pomme des Damoiselles et de bonne compagnie.”\r\n\r\nUnder the name of _Lady Apple_, large quantities of the Api are\r\nannually imported to this country from the United States, where it is\r\ngrown to a great extent, and produces a considerable return to the\r\ngrowers, as it always commands the highest price of any other fancy\r\napple in the market. In the winter months, they may be seen encircled\r\nwith various coloured tissue papers, adorning the windows of the\r\nfruiterers in Covent Garden Market.\r\n\r\nThere are other varieties mentioned by J. B. Porta as belonging to the\r\nApi family; one which ripened in August, in size like the Claudiana\r\nalready mentioned, and commonly called _Melo Appio Rosso_, because it\r\nretained the scent of the Api; this is probably the Rother Sommer-api\r\nof Diel. There is another, of which he says, “Assererem tuto esse\r\nMelapium Plinii,” and which was held in such estimation as to give rise\r\nto the proverb--\r\n\r\n    “Omme malum malum præter appium malum.”\r\n\r\n[I] Plinii Hist.

It\r\nis of a deep yellow on the shaded side, and redish orange next the sun.\r\nIt is a well-flavored apple, but only of second-rate quality.

Flesh, yellowish, firm, crisp,\r\njuicy, sugary, rich, and highly aromatic.\r\n\r\nA dessert apple of the very first quality, possessing all the richness\r\nof the Nonpareil, but with a more sugary juice. It comes into use in\r\nNovember, but is in greatest perfection from Christmas till May.\r\n\r\nThe tree is very hardy, an excellent bearer, and will succeed in\r\nsituations unfavorable to the Nonpareil, to which its leaves and shoots\r\nbear such a similarity, as to justify Mr. Lindley in believing it to be\r\na seedling from that variety.\r\n\r\nThis delightful apple was raised at Gloucester, about the beginning of\r\nlast century, by Dr. Ashmead, an eminent physician of that city. The\r\noriginal tree existed within the last few years, in what had originally\r\nbeen Dr. Ashmead’s garden, but was destroyed in consequence of the\r\nground being required for building. It stood on the spot now occupied\r\nby Clarence Street. It is difficult to ascertain the exact period\r\nwhen it was raised; but the late Mr. Hignell, an eminent orchardist\r\nat Tewkesbury, in Gloucestershire, informed me, that the first time\r\nhe ever saw the fruit of Ashmead’s Kernel, was from a tree in the\r\nnursery of Mr. Wheeler, of Gloucester, in the year 1796, and that the\r\ntree in question had been worked from the original, and was at that\r\ntime upwards of thirty years old. From this it may be inferred that\r\nthe original tree had attained some celebrity by the middle of last\r\ncentury. The Ashmead’s Kernel has long been a favorite apple in all\r\nthe gardens of West Gloucestershire, but it does not seem to have\r\nbeen known in other parts of the country. Like the Ribston Pippin\r\nit seems to have remained long in obscurity, before its value was\r\ngenerally appreciated; it is not even enumerated in the catalogue of\r\nthe extensive collection which was cultivated by Miller and Sweet,\r\nof Bristol, in 1790. I find it was cultivated in the Brompton Park\r\nNursery, in 1780, at which time it was received from Mr. Wheeler,\r\nnurseryman, of Gloucester, who was author of “The Botanist’s and\r\nGardener’s Dictionary,” published in 1763, and grandfather of Mr. J.\r\nCheslin Wheeler, the present proprietor of the nursery, to whom I am\r\nindebted for specimens of the fruit, and much valuable information\r\nconnected with the varieties cultivated in that district.\r\n\r\n\r\n12. AUGUSTUS PEARMAIN--Hort.\r\n\r\n IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3. p. 30.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFruit, below medium size; pearmain-shaped, regular and handsome. Skin,\r\nthick and membranous, yellow in the shade, and marked with a few\r\nbroken stripes of red; but red, streaked all over with deeper red on\r\nthe side next the sun; it is dotted with grey dots, and sometimes\r\nmarked with patches of grey-colored russet, which is strewed with\r\nscales of a darker color. Eye, small and closed, with long segments,\r\nset in a narrow and even basin. Stalk, very short, not protruding\r\nbeyond the base, and having the appearance of a knob obliquely\r\nattached. Flesh, tender, juicy, brisk, and vinous, with a pleasant\r\naromatic flavor.\r\n\r\nA dessert apple, generally of only second-rate quality; but in some\r\nseasons it is of a rich flavor and of first-rate quality.\r\n\r\nIt is in use from November to Christmas.\r\n\r\n\r\n13. BACHELOR’S GLORY.--H.\r\n\r\nFruit, large, three inches wide, and two and three quarters high;\r\nroundish and irregularly ribbed, generally higher on one side of the\r\neye than the other. Skin, smooth and shining, striped with deep golden\r\nyellow, and crimson stripes. Eye, closed, with broad flat segments, and\r\nset in a plaited, irregular, and angular basin. Stalk, about half an\r\ninch long, deeply inserted in a funnel-shaped cavity, which is lined\r\nwith rough scaly russet. Flesh, yellow, tender, juicy, and pleasantly\r\nflavored.\r\n\r\nA second-rate fruit, suitable either for the dessert or culinary\r\npurposes; in use from October to November.\r\n\r\nThis is a variety grown in the neighbourhood of Lancaster, where\r\nit is much esteemed, but in the southern districts, where the more\r\nchoice varieties can be brought to perfection, it can only rank as a\r\nsecond-rate fruit.\r\n\r\n\r\n14. BADDOW PIPPIN.--H.\r\n\r\n SYNONYME.--Spring Ribston, _Riv. Cat._ 1848.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFruit, medium sized; roundish or rather oblate, with prominent ribs on\r\nthe sides, which terminate in four, and sometimes five considerable\r\nridges at the crown, very much in the character of the London Pippin.\r\nIt is sometimes of an ovate shape, caused by the stalk being prominent\r\ninstead of depressed, in which case the ribs on the sides, and ridges\r\nround the eye, are less apparent. Skin, deep lively green, changing\r\nas it ripens to yellowish green, on the shaded side; but covered on\r\nthe side next the sun with dull red, which changes to orange where it\r\nblends with the yellow ground; the whole considerably marked with thin\r\nbrown russet, and russety dots. Eye, rather large and open, with short\r\nsegments, and set in an angular basin. Stalk, very short, not more than\r\na quarter of an inch long, and inserted in a shallow cavity. Flesh,\r\ngreenish white, firm, crisp, juicy, sugary, and with a particularly\r\nrich and vinous flavor, partaking somewhat of the Nonpareil and\r\nRibston, but particularly the latter.\r\n\r\nThis is a first-rate dessert apple, in use in November, and possessing\r\nthe desirable property of keeping till April or May.\r\n\r\nThis variety originated in the garden of Mr. John Harris, of\r\nBroomfield, near Chelmsford, and was first introduced to public notice\r\nin the autumn of 1848.\r\n\r\n\r\n15.

Skin, smooth, yellow on the shaded side; and on\r\nthe side next the sun, deep orange, covered with stripes of bright red,\r\nwhich sometimes extend over the whole surface to the shaded side, and\r\nmarked with large russety dots. Eye, closed, set in a deep, narrow,\r\nand plaited basin. Stalk, about an inch long, slender, and inserted in\r\na deep cavity, from which issue ramifying patches of russet. Flesh,\r\nyellowish, crisp, juicy, and pleasantly acid, with a rich and agreeable\r\nflavor.\r\n\r\nA culinary apple, in season from November to March. The tree is\r\nvigorous, and an abundant bearer; but like the generality of the\r\nAmerican sorts, it does not attain the size, or flavor in this country,\r\nwhich it does in its native soil.\r\n\r\nThis is considered one of the finest apples in the Northern States of\r\nAmerica, and is extensively grown in Massachussets, for the supply of\r\nthe Boston Market.\r\n\r\n\r\n16. BANK APPLE.--H.\r\n\r\nFruit, medium sized, two inches and three quarters wide, and about\r\ntwo inches and a half high; roundish-ovate, regularly and handsomely\r\nformed. Skin, greenish yellow, with a blush and faint streaks of\r\nred next the sun, dotted all over with minute dots, and marked with\r\nseveral large spots of rough russet; the base is covered with a\r\ncoating of russet, strewed with silvery scales. Eye, large and open,\r\nset in a shallow and plaited basin. Stalk, half an inch long, obliquely\r\ninserted by the side of a fleshy prominence. Flesh, firm, crisp, brisk,\r\njuicy, and pleasantly acid, resembling the Winter Greening in flavor.\r\n\r\nIt is an excellent culinary apple, in use from November to February;\r\nbut as it has nothing to recommend it, in preference to other varieties\r\nalready in cultivation, it need only be grown in large collections.\r\n\r\nThe original tree was produced from a pip, accidentally sown in the\r\nhome nursery of Messrs. Ronalds, of Brentford, and from growing on a\r\nbank by the side of a ditch, it was called the _Bank Apple_.\r\n\r\n\r\n17. BARCELONA PEARMAIN.--Hort.\r\n\r\n IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Soc.

Eye, small and open, with\r\nerect acuminate segments, and set in a round, even, and pretty deep\r\nbasin. Stalk, about an inch long, slender, inserted in a rather shallow\r\ncavity, which is lined with russet. Flesh, yellowish white, firm,\r\ncrisp, very juicy, and with a rich, vinous, and highly aromatic flavor.\r\n\r\nOne of the best dessert apples, and equally valuable for culinary\r\npurposes. It comes to perfection about the end of November, and\r\ncontinues in use till March.\r\n\r\nThe tree is a free grower, but does not attain the largest size. It is\r\nvery hardy, an abundant bearer, and succeeds well either as a standard\r\nor an espalier.\r\n\r\nIn the third edition of the Horticultural Society’s Catalogue, this is\r\nsaid to be the same as Reinette Rouge. I do not think that it is the\r\nReinette Rouge of the French, which Duhamel describes as being white,\r\nor clear yellow in the shade, having often prominent ribs round the\r\neye, which extend down the sides, so as to render the shape angular; a\r\ncharacter at variance with that of the Barcelona Pearmain. But I have\r\nno doubt of it being the Reinette Rousse of the same author, which is\r\ndescribed at page 302, vol. 1, as a variety of Reinette Franche, and\r\nwhich he says is of an elongated shape, skin marked with a great number\r\nof russety spots, the most part of which are of a longish figure, so\r\nmuch so, when it is ripe, it appears as if variegated with yellow and\r\nred; a character in every way applicable to the Barcelona Pearmain.\r\n\r\n\r\n18.

Eye,\r\nsmall, partially open, with reflexed segments, set in a narrow and\r\nangular basin. Stalk, nearly three quarters of an inch long, inserted\r\nin a narrow and round cavity. Flesh, yellowish white, tender, crisp,\r\nbrittle, very juicy, and when eaten is quite a mouthful of lively,\r\nvinous juice.\r\n\r\nA dessert apple of the highest excellence, in use from October to\r\nFebruary.\r\n\r\nThe tree is a good and healthy grower, attains a considerable size, and\r\nis an excellent bearer.\r\n\r\nThis variety seems to be but little known, and considering its\r\nexcellence rarely cultivated. I am not aware that it exists in any of\r\nthe nurseries, or that it was at any period extensively propagated. The\r\nonly place where I ever met with it was, in the private garden of the\r\nlate Mr. Lee, of Hammersmith, whence I procured grafts from a tree in\r\nthe last stage of decay.\r\n\r\n\r\n19.

Flesh, yellowish, tender, and juicy, with a pleasant sub-acid\r\nflavor.\r\n\r\nA valuable and now well-known culinary apple, in use from October\r\nto February. When well grown the Beauty of Kent is perhaps the most\r\nmagnificent apple in cultivation. Its great size, the beauty of its\r\ncoloring, the tenderness of the flesh, and profusion of delicate\r\nsub-acid juice, constitute it one of our most popular winter apples,\r\nfor culinary purposes, and one of the most desirable and useful, either\r\nfor a small garden, or for more extended cultivation.\r\n\r\nThe tree is a strong and vigorous grower, attains a large size, and is\r\na good bearer; but I have always found it subject to canker when grown\r\non the paradise stock, and in soils which are moist and heavy.\r\n\r\nI have not been able to ascertain the time when, or the place where\r\nthis variety originated. It is first noticed by Forsyth in his Treatise\r\non Fruit Trees, but is not enumerated in any of the nurserymen’s\r\ncatalogues, either of the last, or the early part of the present,\r\ncentury. It was introduced to the Brompton Park Nursery, about the\r\nyear 1820, and is now as extensively cultivated as most other leading\r\nvarieties. In America, Downing says, “the fruit in this climate is one\r\nof the most magnificent of all apples, frequently measuring sixteen or\r\neighteen inches in circumference.”\r\n\r\n\r\n22.

It was known to Parkinson so early\r\nas 1629, and also to Worlidge and Ray. But it is not noticed by any\r\nsubsequent author, or enumerated in any of the nursery catalogues\r\nof the last century, until discovered by George Lindley, growing\r\nin a garden at Gatton, near Norwich, and published by him in the\r\nTransactions of the London Horticultural Society, vol. iv., p. 58. He\r\nseems to be uncertain whether it is the Summer, or Winter Belle Bonne\r\nof these early authors, but Worlidge’s description leaves no doubt as\r\nto its identity. He says “The Summer Belle et Bonne is a good bearer,\r\nbut the fruit is not long lasting. The Winter Belle and Bon is much\r\nto be preferred to the Summer in every respect.” I have no doubt,\r\ntherefore, that the latter is the Belle Bonne of Lindley. Parkinson\r\nsays “they are both fair fruit to look on, being yellow, and of a meane\r\n(medium) bignesse.”\r\n\r\n\r\n24. BELLEDGE PIPPIN.--Hort.\r\n\r\n IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Soc.

Skin, yellow, with a tinge\r\nof dull red next the sun, and streaked with deeper red. Eye, large and\r\nopen, with short stunted segments, placed in a round and rather deep\r\nbasin. Stalk, short and stout, rather deeply inserted, and scarcely\r\nextending beyond the base. Flesh, yellow, crisp, juicy, sweet, and\r\npleasantly acid.\r\n\r\nA very valuable and highly esteemed apple, either for the dessert\r\nor culinary purposes, but, strictly speaking, more suitable for the\r\nlatter. It is in use from November to February.\r\n\r\nThe common complaint against the Blenheim Pippin is, that the tree is\r\na bad bearer. This is undoubtedly the case when it is young, being\r\nof a strong and vigorous habit of growth, and forming a large and\r\nvery beautiful standard; but when it becomes a little aged, it bears\r\nregular and abundant crops. It may be made to produce much earlier, if\r\ngrafted on the paradise stock, and grown either as an open dwarf, or an\r\nespalier.\r\n\r\nThis valuable apple was first discovered at Woodstock, in Oxfordshire,\r\nand received its name from Blenheim, the seat of the Duke of\r\nMarlborough, which is in the immediate neighbourhood. It is not noticed\r\nin any of the nursery catalogues of the last century, nor was it\r\ncultivated in the London nurseries till about the year 1818.\r\n\r\nThe following interesting account of this favorite variety was recently\r\ncommunicated to the Gardener’s Chronicle. “In a somewhat delapidated\r\ncorner of the decaying borough of ancient Woodstock, within ten yards\r\nof the wall of Blenheim Park, stands all that remains of the original\r\nstump of that beautiful and justly celebrated apple, the Blenheim\r\nOrange. It is now entirely dead, and rapidly falling to decay, being a\r\nmere shell about ten feet high, loose in the ground, and having a large\r\nhole in the centre; till within the last three years, it occasionally\r\nsent up long, thin, wiry twigs, but this last sign of vitality has\r\nceased, and what remains will soon be the portion of the woodlouse and\r\nthe worm. Old Grimmett, the basket-maker, against the corner of whose\r\ngarden-wall the venerable relict is supported, has sat looking on it\r\nfrom his workshop window, and while he wove the pliant osier, has\r\nmeditated, for more than fifty successive summers, on the mutability of\r\nall sublunary substances, on juice, and core, and vegetable, as well\r\nas animal, and flesh, and blood. He can remember the time when, fifty\r\nyears ago, he was a boy, and the tree a fine, full-bearing stem, full\r\nof bud, and blossom, and fruit, and thousands thronged from all parts\r\nto gaze on its ruddy, ripening, orange burden; then gardeners came in\r\nthe spring-tide to select the much coveted scions, and to hear the tale\r\nof his horticultural child and sapling, from the lips of the son of the\r\nwhite-haired Kempster. But nearly a century has elapsed since Kempster\r\nfell, like a ripened fruit, and was gathered to his fathers. He lived\r\nin a narrow cottage garden in Old Woodstock, a plain, practical,\r\nlaboring man; and in the midst of his bees and flowers around him, and\r\nin his “glorious pride,” in the midst of his little garden, he realized\r\nVirgil’s dream of the old Corycian:--“Et regum equabat opes animis.”\r\n\r\nThe provincial name for this apple is still “_Kempster’s Pippin_,” a\r\nlasting monumental tribute, and inscription, to him who first planted\r\nthe kernel from whence it sprang.”\r\n\r\n\r\n36.

Skin, shining, pale waxen yellow in the shade, and bright\r\ndeep red next the sun; it is strewed with dots, which are yellowish on\r\nthe sunny side, and brownish in the shade, and marked with veins and\r\nslight traces of delicate, yellowish-grey russet.

Stalk, short and slender, inserted in a narrow, even, and\r\nshallow cavity, which is lined with thin russet. Flesh, white with a\r\nyellowish tinge, crisp and delicate, brisk, juicy, and sugary, and with\r\na rich, vinous, and aromatic flavor.\r\n\r\nA dessert apple of the first quality, in use from November to January.\r\n\r\nThe tree is a free grower and very hardy, not subject to canker, and\r\nattains the largest size. It is very prolific when it has acquired\r\nits full growth, which, in good soil, it will do in fifteen or twenty\r\nyears; and even in a young state it is a good bearer. If grafted on the\r\nparadise stock it may be grown as an open dwarf, or an espalier. The\r\nbloom is very hardy, and withstands the night frosts of spring better\r\nthan most other varieties.\r\n\r\nThis, above all other apples, is the most highly esteemed in Germany.\r\nDiel calls it the Pride of the Germans. It is believed to have\r\noriginated either at a village of Misnia, called Borsdorf, or at a\r\nplace of the same name near Leipsic. According to Forsyth, it was such\r\na favorite with Queen Charlotte, that she had a considerable quantity\r\nof them annually imported from Germany, for her own private use. It\r\nis one of the earliest recorded varieties of the continental authors,\r\nbut does not seem to have been known in this country before the close\r\nof the last century. It was first grown in the Brompton Park Nursery\r\nin 1785. It is mentioned by Cordus, in 1561, as being cultivated in\r\nMisnia; which circumstance has no doubt given rise to the synonyme\r\n“Reinette de Misnie;” he also informs us it is highly esteemed for its\r\nsweet and generous flavor, and the pleasant perfume which it exhales.\r\nWittichius, in his “Methodus Simplicium,” attributes to it the power of\r\ndispelling epidemic fevers and madness!\r\n\r\n\r\n38.

Skin, delicate pale yellow tinged\r\nwith green, becoming bright golden yellow at maturity, washed with deep\r\nred on the side next the sun, and strewed with brown dots, and a few\r\nmarkings of greyish white russet. Eye, small and closed with stout and\r\npointed segments, set in a deep, irregular, five-ribbed basin, which is\r\nsurrounded with knobs.

Flesh, white, delicate, very juicy, and charged with\r\nan agreeable acid.\r\n\r\nA culinary apple of the first quality; in use from January to April,\r\nand “keeps well.” According to the Chartreux Catalogue, “est bonne\r\ncuite pour les malades.”\r\n\r\nThe tree is a very vigorous grower, much more so than the generality of\r\nthe Calvilles; it is very hardy and an abundant bearer, and is better\r\nadapted for being cultivated as a dwarf than an espalier; but it does\r\nnot succeed well on the paradise stock.\r\n\r\nAccording to the French pomologists, this variety seems to have some\r\nconnection with this country, but there is no evidence that it was at\r\nany period grown to any extent in England, or that it was ever known\r\nto any of our early pomologists. It is said by some that the name\r\n_malingre_ is applied to this variety from the fruit becoming meally\r\nor unsound, but from the observation in the Chartreux Catalogue, it is\r\nmore probable that it is so called from being useful to invalids.\r\n\r\n\r\n58.

Skin, tough,\r\nand bitter tasted, red all over; but of a deeper and darker color on\r\nthe side next the sun, and streaked and spotted with paler red on\r\nthe shaded side. Eye open, placed in a wide and deep basin. Stalk,\r\nlong, inserted in a round cavity. Flesh, yellowish white, tender and\r\ndelicate, crisp, sweet, and perfumed.\r\n\r\nThis curious apple has the extraordinary property of producing three\r\ncrops of fruit in one season. The first flowers appear at the usual\r\ntime in April, the second in June, and then for a time it ceases to\r\nproduce any more till the month of August, when it again blooms during\r\nthe whole of that month, September, October, and November, until it is\r\nchecked by the severity of the frosts. The first fruit is generally\r\nripe during August; the second in October, which are about the size of\r\na pigeon’s egg, and quite as good as the first. And so on it continues\r\nuntil retarded by the frosts; but those last produced are rarely fit\r\nfor use.\r\n\r\nThis variety was first brought into notice by M. Thouin, of Paris, who\r\nsays the tree originated on the farm of the Baroness de Micoud, near La\r\nCharité sur Loire, in the department of Nièvre.\r\n\r\n\r\n62.

Flesh,\r\nwhite, tender, crisp, and juicy, with a fine, brisk, and sugary flavor.\r\n\r\nA culinary apple of the first quality, in use from August to December.\r\nIt is one of the most useful as well as one of the best culinary apples\r\nwe have, being fit for use when no larger than a walnut, and after\r\nperfecting their growth continuing in perfection as late as Christmas.\r\nIf blanched in warm water, when used small, the outer rind slips off,\r\nand they may be baked whole; their color is then a transparent green;\r\nand their flavor is exquisite, resembling that of a green apricot.\r\nWhen it is about the size of a large nutmeg, it may be made into apple\r\nmarmalade, or a dried sweetmeat, which rivals the finest Portugal\r\nplum.--_M.C.H.S._\r\n\r\nThe tree is very hardy, a free grower, and an abundant bearer. As it\r\ndoes not attain a great size, it may be grown more closely together\r\nthan most other sorts. It is a dwarf variety of the old English Codlin.\r\n\r\n\r\n63.

Flesh, tender, juicy, and sweet, with a pleasant, acid,\r\nand slightly perfumed flavor.\r\n\r\nOne of our oldest and best culinary apples; it is in use from October\r\nto January.\r\n\r\nThe tree is a strong and vigorous grower, and attains the largest\r\nsize, and though not an abundant bearer during the early period of its\r\ngrowth, it is much more productive as it becomes aged.\r\n\r\nIn the Horticultural Society’s Catalogue of Fruits, and also in\r\nLindley’s “Guide to the Orchard.” This is made synonymous with the\r\nCostard of Ray, which is undoubtedly an error, the Costard being a\r\ndistinct variety.\r\n\r\nThe Catshead is one of our oldest varieties, and was always highly\r\nesteemed for its great size. Phillips, in his poem on Cyder, says--\r\n\r\n    “-------- Why should we sing the Thrift,\r\n    Codling or Pomroy, or of pimpled coat\r\n    The Russet, or the _Cat’s-Head’s_ weighty orb,\r\n    Enormous in its growth, for various use\r\n    Tho’ these are meet, tho’ after full repast,\r\n    Are oft requir’d, and crown the rich dessert.”\r\n\r\nIn Ellis’s “Modern Husbandman,” he says the Catshead is, “a very useful\r\napple to the farmer, because one of them pared and wrapped up in dough,\r\nserves with little trouble for making an apple-dumpling, so much in\r\nrequest with the Kentish farmer, for being part of a ready meal,\r\nthat in the cheapest manner satiates the keen appetite of the hungry\r\nplowman, both at home and in the field, and, therefore, has now got\r\ninto such reputation in Hertfordshire, and some other counties, that it\r\nis become the most common food with a piece of bacon or pickle-pork for\r\nfamilies.”\r\n\r\n\r\n65.

In Langley’s “Pomona,” it is said, “This fruit is\r\noriginally from Ireland, and the cyder much valued in that country.\r\nAbout sixteen or eighteen years since [1727] it was first brought over,\r\nand promoted about Minehead, in Somersetshire. Some gentlemen of that\r\ncounty have got enough of it now to make five, six, or eight hogsheads\r\na year of the cyder; and such as have to spare from their own tables,\r\nsell, I am told, from four to eight pounds a hogshead. The cyder is\r\nof the color of sherry (or rather of French white wine), and every\r\nwhit as fine and clear. I have tasted of it from several orchards in\r\nSomersetshire. It hath a more vinous taste than any cyder I ever drank,\r\nand as the sight might deceive a curious eye for wine, so I believe the\r\ntaste might pass an incurious palate for the same liquor.”\r\n\r\n\r\n74.

It succeeds well, grafted on the paradise\r\nstock, and grown as an espalier or an open dwarf.\r\n\r\nThis valuable apple was brought into notice by Sir Christopher Hawkins,\r\nwho sent it to the London Horticultural Society, in 1813. It was\r\ndiscovered about the beginning of the present century, growing in a\r\ncottager’s garden, near Truro, in Cornwall.\r\n\r\nThe name July-flower is very often applied to this and some other\r\nvarieties of apples, and also to flowers, but it is only a corruption\r\nof the more correct name Gilliflower, which is derived from the French\r\n_Girofle_, signifying a clove, and hence the flower which has the\r\nscent of that spice, is called _Giroflier_, which has been transformed\r\nto _Gilliflower_. In Chaucer’s “Romaunt of the Rose,” he writes it\r\n_Gylofre_.\r\n\r\n    “There was eke wexyng many a spice,\r\n    As Clowe Gylofre and liquorice.”\r\n\r\nTurner writes it _Gelower_ and _Gelyfloure_. The proper name,\r\ntherefore, is Gilliflower, and not July-flower, as if it had some\r\nreference to the month of July.\r\n\r\n\r\n82. COSTARD.--Ray.\r\n\r\n IDENTIFICATION.--Raii Hist. ii. 1447.

Skin, smooth, dull yellowish green, strewed\r\nall over with embedded grey specks. Eye, partially closed with long\r\nacuminate segments, and set in a rather deep and angular basin. Stalk,\r\nabout a quarter of an inch long, inserted in a round, rather shallow,\r\nand narrow cavity. Flesh, greenish-white, tender, juicy, and with a\r\nbrisk, and pleasant sub-acid flavor.\r\n\r\nAn excellent culinary apple of first-rate quality. It is in season from\r\nOctober to Christmas.\r\n\r\nThe tree is hardy, a strong and vigorous grower, with strong downy\r\nshoots, and an abundant bearer.\r\n\r\nThe Costard is one of our oldest English apples. It is mentioned under\r\nthe name of “Poma Costard,” in the fruiterers’ bills of Edward the\r\nFirst, in 1292, at which time it was sold for a shilling a hundred.\r\nThe true Costard is now rarely to be met with, but at an early period\r\nit must have been very extensively grown, for the retailers of it\r\nwere called Costardmongers, an appellation now transformed into\r\nCostermongers. It is mentioned by William Lawson, in 1597, who, in his\r\nquaint style, says, “Of your apple-trees you shall finde difference\r\nin growth. A good Pipping will grow large, and a Costard-tree: stead\r\nthem on the north side of your other apples, thus being placed, the\r\nleast will give sunne to the rest, and the greatest will shroud their\r\nfellowes.”\r\n\r\nModern authors make the Costard synonymous with the Catshead, chiefly,\r\nI think, on the authority of Mr. George Lindley, who has it so in the\r\n“Guide to the Orchard;” but this is evidently an error. All the early\r\nauthors who mention both varieties regard them as distinct. Parkinson\r\ndescribes two varieties of Costard--the “Gray,” and the “Greene.” Of\r\nthe former, he says, “it is a good great apple, somewhat whitish on\r\nthe outside, and abideth the winter. The Green Costard is like the\r\nother, but greener on the outside continually.” Ray describes both the\r\nCatshead and Costard as distinct, and Leonard Meager enumerates three\r\nvarieties of Costard in his list--the white, grey, and red; but which\r\nof these is identical with that described above, it is difficult now to\r\ndetermine.\r\n\r\nSome etymologists, and Dr. Johnson among the number, consider this name\r\nto be derived from _Cost_, a head; but what connection there is between\r\neither the shape or other appearance of this apple, and a head, more\r\nthan any other variety, must puzzle any one to discover. Is it not\r\nmore probable that it is derived from Costatus (_Anglice_, costate, or\r\nribbed), on account of the prominent ribs or angles on its sides? I\r\nthink this a much more likely derivation.\r\n\r\n\r\n83. COUL BLUSH.--Hort.\r\n\r\n IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Trans. vol. vii., p. 340. Hort. Soc. Cat. ed.\r\n 3, n. 184 Mem. Cal. Hort.

It grows well on the paradise stock, producing fruit much\r\nlarger than on the crab, but not of so long duration.\r\n\r\nThis variety is said to have originated at Court of Wick, in\r\nSomersetshire, and to have been raised from a pip of the Golden Pippin.\r\nIt is first mentioned by Forsyth, but I have not been able to discover\r\nany facts relative to its history.\r\n\r\n\r\n85.

Skin,\r\nbright green at first on the shaded side, but changing as it ripens\r\nto clear yellow, marked with traces of russet, and russety dots; but\r\nentirely covered with deep crimson, which is also marked with traces\r\nof russet on the side next the sun, extending even to some portion of\r\nthe shaded side. Eye, open, with short segments, which are reflexed at\r\nthe tips, and set in a wide, even, and deep basin. Stalk, very short,\r\ninserted in a wide and deep cavity, lined with russet, which extends\r\nover a portion of the base. Flesh, yellowish-white, firm, crisp, brisk,\r\nrich, and sugary, with an abundance of vinous and perfumed juice.\r\n\r\nA valuable dessert apple of the first quality; in use from December to\r\nMay.\r\n\r\nThe tree is of small habit of growth, but very hardy and an abundant\r\nbearer. It is well adapted for espalier training when worked on the\r\nparadise stock; and if grafted on the Pomme Paradis of the French, it\r\nmay be grown in pots, in which it forms a beautiful and interesting\r\nobject when laden with its beautiful fruit.\r\n\r\nThe bloom expands later than that of any other variety, and on that\r\naccount is less liable to be injured by spring frosts, hence, according\r\nto Thompson, it has been called the _Wise Apple_.\r\n\r\nThis is not the Capendu of Duhamel, as quoted by Lindley and Downing;\r\nneither is it the Court-pendu of Forsyth and De Quintinye, that variety\r\nbeing the Fenouillet Rouge of Duhamel, _see No. 123_. The Courpendu of\r\nMiller is also a different apple from any of those just mentioned,\r\nand is distinguished by having a long and slender stalk, “so that\r\nthe fruit is always hanging downwards.” The name of this variety is\r\nderived from _Corps pendu_ translated by some _Hanging Body_, whereas\r\nthat of the variety above described, is from _Court pendu_, signifying\r\n_suspended short_, the stalk being so short, that the fruit, sits, as\r\nit were, upon the branch. The name Capendu or Capendua, is mentioned\r\nby the earliest authors, but applied to different varieties of apples.\r\nIt is met with in Ruellius, Tragus, Curtius, and Dalechamp, the latter\r\nconsidering it the _Cestiana_ of Pliny. Curtius applies the name\r\nto a yellow apple, and so also does Ruellius; but Tragus considers\r\nit one of the varieties of Passe-pomme, he says, “Capendua magna\r\nsunt alba et dulcia, in quorum utero semina per maturitatem sonant,\r\nRuellio _Passipoma_ apellantur.” They are also mentioned by J. Bauhin,\r\n“Celeberrimum hoc pomi genus est totius Europæ, sic dicta, quòd ex\r\ncurto admodum pendeant pediculo.”\r\n\r\n\r\n86.

Eye, open, with broad flat segments, and set in a\r\nnarrow, shallow, and regularly plaited basin. Stalk, short, set in a\r\ndeep cavity, which is lined with russet. Flesh, yellow, tender, crisp,\r\njuicy, sugary, and richly flavored.\r\n\r\nAn excellent dessert apple, in use during October and November, after\r\nwhich it becomes dry and meally but does not shrivel.\r\n\r\nThis variety was raised from a seed of the Scarlet Nonpareil, by Mr.\r\nCreed, gardener, at Norton Court, near Faversham, in Kent.\r\n\r\n\r\n89. CREEPER.--H.\r\n\r\nFruit, rather below medium size, two inches and a quarter high, and\r\nabout the same in width; somewhat conical or roundish-ovate. Skin,\r\nsmooth and shining, at first of a fine dark green on the shaded side,\r\nand entirely covered with red, which is thickly marked with broken\r\nstreaks of darker red on the side next the sun; but as it ripens, the\r\nshaded side changes to yellowish-green, and the exposed to crimson.\r\nEye, open, set in a pretty deep basin. Stalk, very short, embedded in\r\na shallow cavity. Flesh, white, tender, juicy, sweet, and pleasantly\r\nflavored, with a slight aroma.\r\n\r\nA very good second-rate summer dessert apple; ripe in September.\r\n\r\nThis variety is very common in the Berkshire orchards.\r\n\r\n\r\n90.

Eye, quite closed, with very\r\nlong tomentose segments, and placed in an undulating and shallow basin,\r\nwhich is sometimes knobbed, and generally lined with thick tomentum.\r\nStalk, about three quarters of an inch long, fleshy at the insertion,\r\ndeeply set in a round and funnel-shaped cavity. Flesh, white tinged\r\nwith green, crisp, brisk, and very juicy, with a rich vinous, and\r\nrefreshing flavor.\r\n\r\nA very valuable and first-rate dessert apple. It ripens on the tree the\r\nfirst week in August, and lasts till the end of September. It is one of\r\nthe earliest summer dessert apples, and at that season, is particularly\r\nrelished, for its fine, cooling, and refreshing, vinous juice.\r\n\r\nThe tree attains a considerable size, it is particularly hardy, and\r\na most prolific bearer. It succeeds well in almost every soil and\r\nsituation, and is admirably adapted for orchard planting. In almost\r\nevery latitude of Great Britain, from Devonshire to the Moray Frith,\r\nI have observed it in perfect health and luxuriance, producing an\r\nabundance of well ripened fruit, which, though not so large, nor so\r\nearly in the northern parts, still possessing the same richness of\r\nflavor as in the south.\r\n\r\nThis is supposed to be a very old variety, but there is no record\r\nof it previous to 1693, when it is mentioned by Ray; and except by\r\nMortimer, it is not noticed by any subsequent writer till within a very\r\nrecent period. It seems to have been unknown to Switzer, Langley, and\r\nMiller; nor do I find that it was grown in any of the London nurseries\r\nbefore the beginning of the present century. The only early catalogue\r\nin which I find it is that of Miller and Sweet, of Bristol, in 1790.\r\n\r\n\r\n93. DR. HELSHAM’S PIPPIN.--Lind.\r\n\r\n IDENTIFICATION.--Lind.

In\r\na letter dated November, 1802, which is in my possession, he writes to\r\nthe late Mr. Forsyth with specimens of these varieties, and of this he\r\nsays, “not in eating till Easter, great bearer, most excellent flavor.”\r\n\r\nThe tree is a free grower, attaining about the middle size, and is an\r\nexcellent bearer.\r\n\r\n\r\n98.

Skin, dull dingy yellow, with a tinge of green, covered\r\nwith patches of thin russet, and large russety dots, particularly\r\nover the base; and mottled with pale red on the side exposed to the\r\nsun. Eye, closed, set in a deep and angular basin. Stalk, about three\r\nquarters of an inch long, inserted in a deep cavity which is lined with\r\nrusset. Flesh, greenish-yellow, firm, crisp, juicy, brisk, and sugary,\r\nwith a rich aromatic flavor.\r\n\r\nThis is a valuable and very excellent apple, suitable either for\r\ndessert use, or culinary purposes. It is in use from December to March.\r\nIn his letter to Mr. Forsyth, referred to above, Mr. Dredge says, “This\r\nis the best apple yet known; in eating from Easter till Midsummer--most\r\nexcellent.”\r\n\r\nThe tree is hardy, a vigorous grower, an early and abundant bearer, but\r\naccording to Rogers, liable to be attacked by the woolly aphis; still\r\nI have never found it more susceptible of that disease than most other\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\nThere are several other varieties mentioned by Forsyth as _seedlings_\r\nof Dredge’s, which I have not met with, as Dredge’s Queen Charlotte,\r\nDredge’s Russet, and Dredge’s Seedling. I have also in my collection,\r\nDredge’s Emperor and Lord Nelson, both of which are grown in the\r\nWest of England, but I have not yet had an opportunity of seeing the\r\nfruit. It is, however, a question whether these are really seedlings\r\nof Dredge’s or not; there are several varieties to which he affixed\r\nhis name, which have been ascertained to be identical with others that\r\nexisted before him, such as Dredge’s White Lily, which is synonymous\r\nwith Devonshire Buckland, and Dredge’s Beauty of Wilts, which is the\r\nsame as Harvey’s Pippin. Such instances tend to weaken our faith in the\r\nhigh encomium passed upon him, by Rogers, of Southampton, in the “Fruit\r\nCultivator,” and induce us to class him with those who not only change\r\nthe name of some varieties, and append their own to others under the\r\npretence of their being new, and seedlings of their own, but dispose\r\nof them at greater prices than they could have procured, had they\r\nbeen sold under their correct names. We have but to glance over the\r\nHorticultural Society’s Catalogue, or the Index to this work, to find\r\nnumerous instances confirmatory of this statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n99.

The young shoots which are long and\r\nstout, are thickly covered with large greyish white dots, which readily\r\ndistinguish this variety from almost every other.\r\n\r\nThis excellent apple was raised by a person of the name of Dumeller,\r\n(pronounced _Dumelow_), a farmer at Shakerstone, a village in\r\nLeicestershire, six miles from Ashby-de-la-Zouch, and is extensively\r\ncultivated in that, and the adjoining counties under the names of\r\nDumelow’s Crab. It was first introduced to the neighbourhood of London,\r\nby Mr. Richard Williams, of the Turnham Green Nursery, who received it\r\nfrom Gopsal Hall, the seat of Earl Howe, and presented specimens of the\r\nfruit to the Horticultural Society in 1820. It was with him that the\r\nname of Wellington Apple originated, and by which only it is now known\r\nin the London markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n102. DUNCAN.--Hort.\r\n\r\n IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Soc.

It is in use from September to December.\r\n\r\nThe tree is a strong and vigorous grower, producing long stout shoots,\r\nis perfectly hardy and a good bearer.\r\n\r\nThis apple was introduced to this country by Mr. Lee, nurseryman\r\nof Hammersmith, in 1817, and was exhibited by him at the London\r\nHorticultural Society; the specimen produced being five inches and a\r\nhalf in diameter, four inches deep, sixteen inches in circumference,\r\nand weighed nineteen ounces. It is generally supposed that this was\r\nits first appearance in England; but there can be little doubt that\r\nit is the _Phœnix Apple_ figured by Brookshaw, whose account of it\r\nin 1808, is as follows:--“It was much grown fifty years back in the\r\nneighbourhood of Twickenham, but was rather lost. The late Mr. Ash,\r\nnurseryman at Strawberry Hill, near Twickenham, preserved it from his\r\nfather, who had an old tree of it. This specimen came from that tree.\r\nThis apple was seen in Russia by an English nobleman, who thought it\r\nso excellent an apple, that he was induced to send some trees of it\r\nto England, and what will appear extraordinary to English gardeners,\r\nthey were taken up in the summer with their leaves on, when they could\r\nnot be less than twelve years old by their appearance, and when they\r\narrived, after being six months before they came to hand, they were\r\nplanted and produced fruit, and are now fine trees. The apple has a\r\nbloom on it like a red plum when on the tree, and is a very excellent\r\nbeautiful apple, ripens in October, and will keep through December. It\r\nis to be had at the late Mr. Ash’s nursery, at Strawberry Hill, near\r\nTwickenham, under the name of Phœnix Apple, from its being lost and\r\nrevived.”\r\n\r\n\r\n112.

In the “Guide to the\r\nOrchard,” he says, “Healthy, robust, and substantial trees are only to\r\nbe obtained by grafting on stocks of the real Sour Hedge Crab; they\r\nthen grow freely, erect, and form very handsome heads, yielding fruit\r\nas superior to those of our old orchards, as the old, and at present\r\ndeteriorated Codlin is to the Crab itself.” This circumstance was\r\nnoticed by Worlidge nearly two hundred years ago--“You may graft them\r\non stocks as you do other fruit, which will accelerate and augment\r\ntheir bearing; but you may save that labor and trouble, if you plant\r\nthe Cions, Slips, or Cuttings of them in the spring-time, a little\r\nbefore their budding; by which means they will prosper very well, and\r\nsoon become Trees; but these are more subject to the canker than those\r\nthat are grafted.”\r\n\r\nThis is one of our oldest English apples, and still deserving of\r\nmore general cultivation than is at present given to it. Formerly it\r\nconstituted one of the principal dishes in English cookery, in the\r\nshape of “Codlings and Cream.” Ray says, “Crudum vix editur ob duritiem\r\net aciditatem, sed coctum vel cum cremore lactis, vel cum aqua rosacea\r\net saccharo comestum inter laudatissima fercula habetur.” The name is\r\nderived from _coddle_, to parboil.\r\n\r\n\r\n113.

Skin, of a fine deep\r\nyellow color, like a Golden Pippin, but almost entirely covered with\r\nrusset, which is brown on the shaded side, and grey where exposed to\r\nthe sun, mixed with a tinge of redish brown. Eye, small and open, set\r\nin a round, wide, and rather deep basin. Stalk, half-an-inch long,\r\ninserted in a rather shallow cavity. Flesh, yellowish-white, tender,\r\ncrisp, rich, sugary, and aromatic, partaking much of the flavor of\r\nAnise--hence the origin of one of the synonymes.\r\n\r\nAn excellent dessert apple, and when well ripened is considered of\r\nfirst-rate quality by those who are partial to its peculiar flavor. It\r\nis in season from December to March, and at an advanced period becomes\r\nwoolly.\r\n\r\nThe tree is a small and slender grower; but an abundant bearer.

Skin, pale greenish-yellow, but so entirely\r\ncovered with dark grey russet as to leave none of the ground color\r\nvisible, except that portion exposed to the sun, which is dark redish\r\nbrown. Eye, large and closed, set in a wide and rather shallow basin.\r\nStalk, about an inch long, sometimes obliquely inserted, by the\r\nside of a fleshy prominence, in a wide and shallow cavity. Flesh,\r\ngreenish-white, firm, rich, sugary, and highly perfumed with the flavor\r\nof anise or fennel.\r\n\r\nAn excellent dessert apple; in use from November to January.\r\n\r\nThe tree is a small grower, but an abundant bearer, and requires a warm\r\nand rich soil to have the fruit in perfection.\r\n\r\n\r\n124. FILL-BASKET.--H.\r\n\r\nFruit, medium sized, two inches and a half wide, and the same in\r\nheight; conical, round at the base, flattened at the apex, and\r\ndistinctly angular on the sides. Skin, pale dull greenish-yellow on the\r\nshaded side, and streaked with broken patches and pencilings of pale\r\nred, where exposed to the sun, the whole covered with russety dots.\r\nEye, closed, as if drawn together or puckered, placed level with the\r\nflat crown, and with a small knob or wart at the base of each segment.\r\nStalk, three quarters of an inch long, thickest at the insertion, and\r\nplaced in a small, round, and shallow cavity, which is surrounded with\r\ndark brown russet. Flesh, greenish-white, tender, juicy, and acid, with\r\na brisk and pleasant flavor.\r\n\r\nAn excellent culinary apple, extensively grown in the neighbourhood of\r\nLancaster, where it is highly esteemed; it is in use from October to\r\nJanuary.\r\n\r\nThis, which may be called the Lancashire Fill-basket, is very different\r\nfrom the Kentish variety of that name.\r\n\r\n\r\n125. FLANDERS PIPPIN.--H.\r\n\r\nFruit, medium sized, three inches wide, and two and a quarter high;\r\noblate, and marked on the sides with ten distinct angles, five of which\r\nare more prominent than the others. Skin, pale green, changing to pale\r\ngreenish-yellow as it ripens, and occasionally tinged with a cloud\r\nof thin dull red on the side exposed to the sun, and thinly strewed\r\nwith a few dots. Eye, closed, with long and downy segments, set in a\r\nnarrow and ribbed basin. Stalk, from half-an-inch to an inch in length,\r\nslender, and inserted in a deep funnel-shaped cavity, which is lined\r\nwith russet. Flesh, white, tender, and marrowy, juicy, and briskly\r\nflavored.\r\n\r\nA culinary apple of second-rate quality; in use during October and\r\nNovember.\r\n\r\nIt is much grown in the Berkshire orchards.\r\n\r\n\r\n126.

Skin, greenish-yellow, thickly strewed\r\nwith green dots on the shaded side; but next the sun, dull red marked\r\nwith patches and streaks of livelier red, and dotted with light grey\r\ndots. Eye, large and open, with broad reflexed segments, and placed\r\nin a large angular basin, which is marked with russet. Stalk, an\r\ninch long, thick and strong, deeply set in an angular cavity. Flesh,\r\ngreenish-white, firm, crisp, and juicy, with a pleasant and briskly\r\nacid flavor.\r\n\r\nA culinary apple of first-rate quality; in use from November to January.\r\n\r\nThe tree is a pretty good bearer, one of the strongest and most\r\nvigorous growers, and consequently more suitable for the orchard than\r\nthe fruit garden.\r\n\r\nThis is a very old variety, being mentioned by Parkinson, Leonard\r\nMeager, and Ray, but there is no notice of it in the works of any\r\nsubsequent writer till the publication of Forsyth’s Treatise.\r\n\r\n\r\n127. FLUSHING SPITZENBURGH.--Down.\r\n\r\n IDENTIFICATION.--Down. Fr. Amer. 139.\r\n\r\nFruit, medium sized; roundish, narrowing towards the eye. Skin,\r\nentirely covered with deep red, which is streaked with deeper red,\r\nexcept on any small portion where it has been shaded, and there it is\r\ngreen, marked with broken streaks and mottles of red, the whole surface\r\nstrewed with light grey russety dots. Eye, small and closed, very\r\nslightly depressed, and surrounded with plaits. Stalk, nearly an inch\r\nlong, inserted in a deep and russety cavity. Flesh, greenish, tender,\r\nsweet, juicy, and without any predominance of acid.\r\n\r\nAn American dessert apple of little value; in use from October to\r\nJanuary.\r\n\r\nIn the Horticultural Society’s Catalogue this is made synonymous with\r\nEsopus Spitzenburgh, but it is quite a different variety.\r\n\r\n\r\n128.

Stalk, very short,\r\ninserted in a shallow cavity. Flesh, firm.\r\n\r\nSpecific gravity of the juice from 1076 to 1081.\r\n\r\nThis is a fine old Gloucestershire cider apple, which is extensively\r\ncultivated on the thin limestone soils of the Forest of Dean. The cider\r\nthat it produces is strong bodied, rich, and highly flavored.\r\n\r\nThe tree produces numerous straight, luxuriant, upward shoots, like\r\na pollard willow; it runs much to wood, and in deep soils attains a\r\nconsiderable size before it becomes fruitful.\r\n\r\n\r\n129. FORGE.--H.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFruit, medium sized; roundish, obscurely ribbed, and sometimes\r\nnarrowing towards the eye, where it is angular. Skin, smooth and\r\nshining, of a fine golden yellow color, strewed with mottles of crimson\r\non the shaded side; and dark red marked with patches of deep crimson\r\non the side exposed to the sun; sometimes when much exposed to the sun\r\nthe yellow assumes a deep orange tinge. Eye, small and closed, set in\r\nan angular basin. Stalk, very short, not a quarter of an inch long,\r\ninserted in a small, round, and shallow cavity, surrounded with thick\r\nrusset. Flesh, yellowish-white, tender, mellow, juicy, sweet, and\r\nfinely perfumed.\r\n\r\nA beautiful and valuable apple, suitable either for the dessert,\r\nculinary use, or for the manufacture of cider. It is in use from\r\nOctober to January.\r\n\r\nThe tree attains about the middle size, is perfectly hardy and healthy,\r\nand quite free from canker and disease. It is a most abundant and\r\nregular bearer.\r\n\r\nI am surprised that this beautiful apple has hitherto escaped the\r\nnotice of pomologists, it being so universally grown, and generally\r\npopular, in the district to which it belongs. In the north-eastern\r\nparts of Sussex, and the adjoining county of Surrey, it is extensively\r\ncultivated, and I believe there is scarcely a cottager’s garden where\r\nit is not to be met with, nor is there a cottager to whom its name\r\nis not as familiar as his own, it being considered to supply all the\r\nqualifications that a valuable apple is supposed to possess; and\r\nalthough this judgment is formed in contrast with the other varieties\r\ngrown in the district, nevertheless, the Forge is a useful and valuable\r\napple, particularly to a cottager, whether we consider its great\r\nproductiveness, its uses as a dessert and excellent cooking apple, or\r\nthe excellent cider which it produces. It is said to have originated at\r\na blacksmith’s forge near East Grinstead.\r\n\r\n\r\n130. FORMAN’S CREW.--Hort.\r\n\r\n IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3, n. 256. Lind. Guide, 69.

In Evelyn’s “Advertisements concerning Cider,” a “person of\r\ngreat experience,” says “Cider for strength and a long lasting drink\r\nis best made of the _Fox-Whelp_ of the _Forest of Dean_, but which\r\ncomes not to be drunk till two or three years old.” By Worlidge it was\r\n“esteemed among the choice cider fruits.”\r\n\r\n\r\n134.

Eye, large, open, and\r\ndeeply set in a wide and slightly furrowed basin. Stalk, short and\r\nstout, inserted in a deep and open cavity, which is lined with rough\r\nrusset. Flesh, white, tender, juicy, and though not highly flavored, is\r\nan excellent culinary apple.\r\n\r\nIt is in use from October to Christmas.\r\n\r\nThis variety is of American origin, but some doubts exist as to where\r\nit was first raised, that honor being claimed by several different\r\nlocalities. The general opinion, however, is, that it originated in\r\nthe garden of a Mr. Smith, in the neighbourhood of Baltimore, and was\r\nfirst brought over to this country by Captain George Hudson, of the\r\nship Belvedere, of Baltimore, in 1817. It was introduced from America\r\ninto France by Comte Lelieur, in 1804. But from the account given in\r\nthe Allgemeines Teutsches Gärtenmagazin, it is doubtful whether it is\r\na native of America, for in the volume of that work for 1805, it is\r\nsaid to have been raised by Herr Künstgartner Maszman, of Hanover. If\r\nthat account is correct, its existence in America is in all probability\r\nowing to its having been taken thither by some Hanoverian emigrants.\r\nAt page 41, vol. iii., Dittrich has confounded the synonymes of the\r\n_Gloria Mundi_ with _Golden Mundi_, which he has described under the\r\nname of _Monstow’s Pepping_.\r\n\r\n\r\n140.

Skin, smooth and shining, yellow, mixed in some\r\nparts with a tinge of green, and washed with thin clear red on the\r\nside next the sun; the whole surface is strewed with minute russety\r\ndots, and several large dark spots, such as are often met with on the\r\nHawthornden. Eye, large, with long segments, and set in an angular\r\nbasin. Stalk, three quarters of an inch long, inserted in a deep\r\ncavity, which is surrounded with a large patch of rough grey russet.\r\nFlesh, yellowish-white, firm but tender, very juicy, with a pleasant,\r\nbrisk, and slightly perfumed flavor.\r\n\r\nA culinary apple of first quality; it is in use the end of October and\r\ncontinues till Christmas.\r\n\r\nThe tree is a strong and vigorous grower, attaining a great size, and\r\nis an excellent bearer.\r\n\r\nI had this variety from Mr. James Lake, of Bridgewater, and it is\r\nevidently identical with the Glory of the West of Diel, a name which,\r\naccording to Lindley, is sometimes applied to the Dutch Codlin.

Stalk, from\r\nhalf-an-inch to an inch in length, inserted in a pretty deep cavity.\r\nFlesh, yellow, firm, crisp, very juicy and sugary, with a brisk,\r\nvinous, and particularly fine flavor.\r\n\r\nOne of the oldest and by far the most highly esteemed of our dessert\r\napples, and neither the Borsdorffer of the Germans, the Reinette of\r\nthe French, nor the Newtown Pippin of the Americans, will ever occupy\r\nin the estimation of the English the place now accorded to the Golden\r\nPippin. It is also an excellent cider apple. The specific gravity of\r\nits juice is 1078.\r\n\r\nIt is in season from November to April.\r\n\r\nThe tree is a free and vigorous grower, but does not attain a great\r\nsize. It is also an excellent bearer.\r\n\r\nWhen and where the Golden Pippin was first discovered, are now matters\r\nof uncertainty; but all writers agree in ascribing to it an English\r\norigin, some supposing it to have originated at Parham Park, near\r\nArundel, in Sussex. Although it is not recorded at so early a period\r\nas some others, there is no doubt it is a very old variety. It is\r\nnot, however, the “Golding Pippin” of Parkinson, for he says “it is\r\nthe _greatest_ and best of all sorts of Pippins.” It was perhaps this\r\ncircumstance that led Mr. Knight to remark, that from the description\r\nParkinson has given of the apples cultivated in his time, it is evident\r\nthat those now known by the same names, are different, and probably\r\nnew varieties. But this is no evidence of such being the case, for I\r\nfind there were two sorts of Golden Pippin, the “Great Golding,” and\r\nthe “Small Golding, or Bayford,” both of which are mentioned by Leonard\r\nMeager, and there is no doubt the “Golding Pippin,” of Parkinson, was\r\nthe “Great Golding.” Whether it was because it was little known, or its\r\nqualities were unappreciated, that the writers of the 17th century were\r\nso restrictive in their praises of the Golden Pippin, it is difficult\r\nto say; but true it is whilst Pearmains, Red Streaks, Codlings, and\r\nCatsheads, are set forth as the desiderata of an orchard, the Golden\r\nPippin is but rarely noticed. Ralph Austin calls it “a very speciall\r\napple and great bearer.” Evelyn certainly states that Lord Clarendon\r\ncultivated it, but it was only as a cider apple: for he says “at\r\nLord Clarendon’s seat at Swallowfield, Berks, there is an orchard of\r\n1000 Golden _and other cider_ Pippins.” In his Treatise on Cider he\r\nfrequently notices it as a cider apple; but never in any place that I\r\ncan recollect of as a dessert fruit. In the Pomona, he says, “About\r\nLondon and the southern tracts, the Pippin, and especially the Golden,\r\nis esteemed for making the most delicious cider, most wholesome, and\r\nmost restorative.” Worlidge merely notices it as “smaller than the\r\nOrange Apple, else much like it in color, taste, and long keeping.”\r\nRay seems the first who fully appreciated it, for after minutely and\r\ncorrectly describing it, he says, “Ad omnes culinæ usus præstantissimum\r\nhabetur, et Pomaceo conficiendo egregium.” De Quintinye’s remarks are\r\nnot at all complimentary. He says it has altogether the character of\r\nthe paradise or some other wild apple, it is extremely yellow and\r\nround, little juice, which is pretty rich, and without bad flavor.\r\nBut the Jardinier Solitaire, more impartial, or with better judgment,\r\nsays, “son eau est tres sucrée; elle a le goût plus relevé que la\r\nReynette; c’est ce que luy donne le mérite d’être reconnuë pour une\r\ntres excellente pomme.” The opinion of Angran de Rueneuve is also worth\r\nrecording.\r\n\r\n“La Pomme d’Or est venuë d’Angleterre; on l’y apelle Goule-Pepin.\r\nJ’estime qu’elle doit être la Reyne des Pommes, et que la Reynette ne\r\ndoit marche qu’aprés elle; car elle est d’un plus fin relief que toutes\r\nles autres Pommes.” Switzer calls it “the most antient, as well as most\r\nexcellent apple that is.” But it is not my intention to record all that\r\nhas been written in praise of the Golden Pippin, for that of itself\r\nwould occupy too much space, my object in making these extracts being\r\nsimply to show the gradual progress of its popularity.\r\n\r\nThe late President of the London Horticultural Society, T. A. Knight,\r\nEsq., considered that the Golden Pippin, and all the old varieties of\r\nEnglish apples, were in the last stage of decay, and that a few years\r\nwould witness their total extinction. This belief he founded upon the\r\ndegenerate state of these varieties in the Herefordshire orchards, and\r\nalso upon his theory that no variety of apple will continue to exist\r\nmore than 200 years. But that illustrious man never fell into a greater\r\nerror. It would be needless to enter into any further discussion upon\r\na subject concerning which so much has already been said and written,\r\nas there is sufficient evidence to confute that theory. The Pearmain,\r\nwhich is the oldest English apple on record, shows no symptoms of\r\ndecay, neither does the Catshead, London Pippin, Winter Quoining, or\r\nany other variety; those only _having been allowed to disappear_ from\r\nour orchards, which were not worth perpetuating, and their places\r\nsupplied by others infinitely superior.\r\n\r\nIt is now considerably upwards of half a century since this doctrine\r\nwas first promulgated, and though the old, exhausted, and diseased\r\ntrees of the Herefordshire orchards, of which Mr. Knight spoke,\r\ntogether with their _diseased_ progeny--now that they have performed\r\ntheir part, and fulfilled the end of their existence--may ere this have\r\npassed away, we have the Golden Pippin still, in all the luxuriance of\r\nearly youth, where it is found in a soil congenial to its growth; and\r\nexhibiting as little symptoms of decay as any of the varieties which\r\nMr. Knight raised to supply the vacancy he expected it to create.\r\n\r\nIn the Brompton Park Nursery, where the same Golden Pippin has been\r\ncultivated for nearly two centuries, and continued from year to year by\r\ngrafts taken from young trees in the nursery quarters, I never saw the\r\nleast disposition to disease, canker, or decay of any kind; but, on the\r\ncontrary, a free, vigorous, and healthy growth.\r\n\r\nBut this alarm of Mr. Knight for the safety of the Golden Pippin, and\r\nhis fear of its extinction, were based upon no new doctrine, for we\r\nfind Mortimer a hundred years before, equally lamenting the Kentish\r\nPippin. After speaking of manures, &c., for the regeneration of fruit\r\ntrees, he says, “I shall be glad if this account may put any upon the\r\ntrial of raising that excellent fruit the Kentish Pippin, which else,\r\nI fear, will be lost. For I find in several orchards, both in Kent,\r\nEssex, and Hertfordshire, old trees of that sort, but I can find no\r\nyoung ones to prosper. A friend of mine tried a great many experiments\r\nin Hertfordshire, about raising them, and could never get them to\r\nthrive, though he had old trees in the same orchard that grew and bore\r\nvery well. I likewise tried several experiments myself, and have had\r\nyoung trees thrive so well, as to make many shoots of a yard long in\r\na year, but these young shoots were always blasted the next year, or\r\ncankered; which makes me think that the ancients had some particular\r\nway of raising them, that we have lost the knowledge of.” Although this\r\nwas written a hundred and fifty years ago, we have the Kentish Pippin\r\nstill, which though not so much cultivated, or so well known now as\r\nthen, is nevertheless where it does exist as vigorous and healthy as\r\never it was.\r\n\r\n\r\n149.

I have, however,\r\nthought it advisable to discontinue that name in connection with this\r\nvariety, because Diel previously possessed and described it under the\r\nname of _Golden Winter Pearmain_, which is much more appropriate; and\r\nthe name of King of the Pippins belongs to another and very distinct\r\nvariety.--_See No. 199_.\r\n\r\n\r\n153.

It has somewhat of a pyramidal habit of growth, and attains a\r\nconsiderable size.\r\n\r\nThough not of recent introduction, this beautiful and excellent apple\r\nis comparatively but little known, otherwise it would be more generally\r\ncultivated. It is one of the favorite apples of Germany, particularly\r\nabout Hamburgh, and in Holstein, where it is said to have originated in\r\nthe garden of the Duke of Augustenberg, at the Castle of Grafenstein.\r\nThe original tree is said to have been in existence about the middle of\r\nthe last century.

When grown against a wall, as it is sometimes in\r\nthe North of England, and border counties, the fruit attains a large\r\nsize, and is particularly handsome and beautiful.\r\n\r\nThis variety was first discovered growing in the garden of a shoemaker,\r\nat Keswick, named Greenup, and was first cultivated and made public by\r\nClarke and Atkinson, nurserymen at that place about fifty years ago.\r\nIt is now much cultivated throughout the border counties, and is a\r\nvaluable apple where the more choice varieties do not attain perfection.\r\n\r\n\r\n160.

It requires,\r\nhowever, to be grown in certain situations; a dry soil with a\r\ncalcareous subsoil, being considered the best adapted for producing its\r\ncider in perfection. Marshall says, “It was raised from seed by Mr.\r\nBellamy, of Hagloe, in Gloucestershire, grandfather of the present Mr.\r\nBellamy, near Ross, in Herefordshire, who draws from it (that is, from\r\ntrees grafted with scions from this parent stock) a liquor, which for\r\nrichness, flavor, and _pure on the spot_, exceeds perhaps every other\r\nfruit liquor which nature and art have produced. He has been offered\r\nsixty guineas for a hogshead (about 110 gallons) of this liquor. He has\r\nlikewise been offered bottle for bottle of wine, or spirituous liquors,\r\nthe best to be produced; and this without freight, duty, or even a mile\r\nof carriage to enhance its original price.”\r\n\r\n\r\n163.

Skin, covered with pale\r\nbrown russet, and where any portion of the ground color is exposed,\r\nit is yellowish-green on the shaded side, and brownish-red next the\r\nsun; but sometimes it is almost free from russet, particularly in hot\r\nseasons, being then of an uniform yellowish-green, mottled with orange\r\nor pale red next the sun. Eye, small and closed, with short segments,\r\nand set in a shallow basin. Stalk, short, about half-an-inch long,\r\ninserted in a round and even cavity. Flesh, yellow, firm, not juicy,\r\nbut very rich, sugary, and highly aromatic.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the richest flavored dessert apples; it is in use from\r\nNovember to April.\r\n\r\nThe tree is a small grower, but healthy, hardy, and an abundant bearer.\r\n\r\nHubbard’s Pearmain was first introduced to public notice by Mr. George\r\nLindley, at a meeting of the London Horticultural Society in 1820.\r\n“This,” says Mr. Lindley, “is a real Norfolk apple, well known in the\r\nNorwich market; and although it may be found elsewhere, its great\r\nexcellence may have caused its removal hence. The merits of Hubbard’s\r\nPearmain as a table apple are unrivalled, and its superior, from the\r\ncommencement of its season to the end, does not, I am of opinion, exist\r\nin this country.”\r\n\r\n\r\n182.

Eye, large, and open, with long, spreading,\r\nacuminate segments, placed in a deep, angular, and irregular basin.\r\nStalk, half-an-inch long, inserted in a deep, oblique cavity, and not\r\nextending beyond the base. Flesh, yellowish-white tinged with green,\r\nfirm and leathery, juicy and sugary, with a rich and highly aromatic\r\nflavor, very similar to, and little inferior to the Ribston Pippin.\r\n\r\nA dessert apple of the first quality, whether as regards its long\r\nduration, or the peculiar richness of its flavor: it is in use from\r\nDecember to March; but according to Mr. Thompson--no mean authority--it\r\nwill keep for two years. It may, however, be a question whether or\r\nnot this is identical with the Hunt’s Deux Ans of the Horticultural\r\nSociety, which Mr. Thompson regards as only a second-rate fruit. If it\r\nis the same, the climate of Somersetshire, whence I had both trees and\r\nspecimens of the fruit, is more adapted for bringing it to perfection\r\nthan that of Chiswick.\r\n\r\n\r\n184.

Skin, almost entirely covered\r\nwith thin russet, except a spot on the shaded side, where it is green;\r\nand where exposed to the sun it is of a redish-brown. Flesh, white\r\ntinged with green, crisp, juicy, and highly flavored.\r\n\r\nA dessert apple of first-rate quality; in use from December to February.\r\n\r\nThis variety was raised from a seed of the old Nonpareil, to which it\r\nbears a strong resemblance, by Dr. Fry of Gloucester, and received the\r\nname it now bears, from being sent to the Horticultural Society of\r\nLondon, by Thomas Hunt Esq., of Stratford-on-Avon, in 1820. Mr. Lindley\r\ngives Hunt’s Nonpariel as a synonyme of Duke of Gloucester; but it is a\r\nvery distinct variety; it was, however, a seedling raised by Mr. Hunt\r\nfrom the Duke of Gloucester, and is a very first-rate variety.\r\n\r\n\r\n185. HUNTHOUSE.--Hort.\r\n\r\n IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3, n. 347. Rog. Fr. Cult. 57.\r\n\r\nFruit, of medium size, two inches and three quarters wide, by two\r\ninches and a half high; conical, ribbed on the sides, and terminated at\r\nthe apex, with rather prominent knobs. Skin, at first grass-green, but\r\nchanging as it ripens to greenish-yellow; where exposed to the sun it\r\nis tinged with red, and marked with small crimson dots and a few short\r\nbroken streaks of the same color; but where shaded it is veined with\r\nthin brown russet, particularly about the eye, and very thinly strewed\r\nwith russety dots. Eye, large, half open, with broad flat segments, set\r\nin a narrow, and deeply furrowed basin. Stalk, an inch long, straight,\r\ninserted in a very shallow cavity, sometimes between two fleshy lips,\r\nbut generally with a fleshy protuberance on one side of it. Flesh,\r\ngreenish-white, firm, tender, and with a brisk, but rather coarse and\r\nrough acid flavor.\r\n\r\nA useful culinary apple; in use from December to March.\r\n\r\nIts chief recommendation is, the immense productiveness of the tree,\r\nwhich is rather small, with pendulous shoots, and extremely hardy; it\r\nsucceeds in exposed situations where many other varieties could not\r\ngrow. Rogers says, “it is a tree of the third class in the orchard,\r\nand will answer well in exposed situations, trained as dwarfs or\r\nhalf-standards, it being equal in hardihood, and very fit to be planted\r\nalong with the Grey Leadington.”\r\n\r\nThis variety was discovered at Whitby, in Yorkshire, where it is\r\nextensively cultivated.\r\n\r\n\r\n186. HUTTON SQUARE.--H.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFruit, large; roundish-ovate, and irregular in its outline, being much\r\nbossed on the sides, and knobbed about the eye and the stalk. Skin,\r\nsmooth, dull greenish-yellow where shaded, and strewed with minute\r\nrussety dots; but washed with dull red next the sun, and dotted with\r\nblack dots. Eye, small and closed, placed in an angular and plaited\r\nbasin. Stalk, short, deeply embedded in an angular cavity. Flesh,\r\nwhite, firm, crisp, sweet, briskly and pleasantly flavored.\r\n\r\nA valuable culinary apple of first-rate quality, and not unsuitable for\r\nthe dessert, where a brisk and poignant flavored apple is preferred; it\r\nis in use from November to March.\r\n\r\nThis variety is extensively grown about Lancaster; and is said to have\r\noriginated at the village of Hutton, in that vicinity.\r\n\r\nThe tree is an excellent bearer.\r\n\r\n\r\n187.

Stalk, short, thick, and fleshy, inserted\r\nin a pretty deep cavity. Flesh, greenish-white, tender, and crisp,\r\nabounding in a rich, brisk, vinous, and aromatic juice, which, at this\r\nseason, is particularly refreshing.\r\n\r\nAn early dessert apple of the finest quality. It is ripe during the\r\nfirst week in August, and lasts all through that month. It is a most\r\nbeautiful, and certainly one of the most excellent summer apples,\r\npossessing all the rich flavor of some of the winter varieties, with\r\nthe abundant and refreshing juice of the summer fruits. Like most of\r\nthe summer apples it is in greatest perfection when eaten from the\r\ntree, which is hardy, vigorous, and an abundant bearer.\r\n\r\n\r\n188. IRISH REINETTE.--H.\r\n\r\nFruit, medium sized, two inches and three quarters wide, by two\r\ninches and a half high; oblong, somewhat five-sided, with five ribs\r\nwhich extend from the base to the apex, where they run into the eye,\r\nforming five prominent ridges. Skin, yellowish-green, strewed with\r\nminute russety dots on the shaded side; but dull brownish-red, almost\r\nentirely covered with large patches of dull leaden colored russet, on\r\nthe side exposed to the sun. Eye, small and closed, placed in a ribbed\r\nand plaited basin. Stalk, short, inserted in a round, deep, and even\r\ncavity. Flesh, greenish-yellow, firm, crisp, and very juicy, with a\r\nbrisk, and poignant acid juice.\r\n\r\nA valuable culinary apple; in use from November to February.\r\n\r\nThis variety is much cultivated about Lancaster, and in the county of\r\nWestmoreland, where it is highly esteemed.\r\n\r\n\r\n189.

According to Mr. Knight, it is by some supposed to have\r\nbeen introduced from Normandy to the Isle of Wight, where it was first\r\nplanted in the garden at Wrexall Cottage, near the Undercliff, where it\r\nwas growing in 1817. There are several other varieties of apples known\r\nby the name of “Orange” and “Orange Pippin,” but they are all very\r\ninferior to this.\r\n\r\nThe tree does not attain a large size, but is hardy, healthy, and an\r\nexcellent bearer.

Skin, smooth and shining,\r\npale yellowish-green in the shade; but clear yellow, with sometimes\r\na faint tinge of red or orange next the sun. Eye, small and closed,\r\nsurrounded with a few small plaits, and set in a very shallow basin.\r\nStalk, an inch long, slender, and inserted in a shallow cavity, which\r\nis lined with delicate russet. Flesh, white, crisp, brisk, and juicy,\r\nwith a vinous and slightly perfumed flavor, but becoming meally and\r\ntasteless, if kept only a few days after being gathered.\r\n\r\nThis is the earliest apple of the year, the first of Pomona’s autumnal\r\nofferings; it is in greatest perfection when gathered off the tree, or\r\nimmediately afterwards, as it very soon becomes dry and meally.\r\n\r\nThe tree does not attain a large size, but is hardy and healthy. It is\r\nnot a great bearer, which may, in a great measure, account for it not\r\nbeing so generally cultivated, as its earliness would recommend it to\r\nbe. If worked on the paradise stock it may be grown in pots, when the\r\nfruit will not only be produced earlier, but in greater abundance than\r\non the crab, or free stock.\r\n\r\nThis is one of our oldest apples, and although generally known and\r\npopular, seems to have escaped the notice of Miller, who does not\r\neven mention it in any of the editions of his dictionary. As I have\r\ndoubts of this being the Geneting of Parkinson--his figure being\r\nevidently intended for the Margaret, which in some districts is called\r\nJoanneting--the first mention we have of this variety is by Rea, in\r\n1665, who describes it as “a small, yellow, red-sided apple, upon a\r\nwall, ripe in the end of June.”\r\n\r\nThe orthography which I have adopted in the nomenclature of this apple\r\nmay, to some, at first sight, seem strange; but I am nevertheless\r\npersuaded it is the correct one. The different forms in which it has\r\nbeen written will be found in the synonymes given above, none of which\r\nafford any assistance as to the derivation or signification of the\r\nname. Abercrombie was the first who wrote it June-eating, as if in\r\nallusion to the period of its maturity, which is, however, not till the\r\nend of July. Dr. Johnson, in his Dictionary, writes it Gineting, and\r\nsays it is a corruption of Janeton (_Fr._) signifying Jane or Janet,\r\nhaving been so called from a person of that name. Ray[K] says, “Pomum\r\nGinettinum, quod unde dictum sit me latet.” Indeed there does not seem\r\never to have been a correct definition given of it.\r\n\r\nIn the middle ages, it was customary to make the festivals of the\r\nchurch, or saint’s days, periods on which occurrences were to take\r\nplace, or from which events were dated. Even in the present day, we\r\nhear the country people talking of some crop to be sown, or some other\r\nto be planted at Michaelmas, St. Martin’s, or Saint Andrew’s-tide. It\r\nwas also the practice, during the reign of Popery in this country,\r\nas is still the case in all Roman Catholic countries, for parents to\r\ndedicate their children to some particular saint, as Jean Baptiste,\r\non the recurrence of whose festival, all who are so named keep it as\r\na holiday. So it was also in regard to fruits, which were named after\r\nthe day about which they came to maturity. Thus, we have the Margaret\r\nApple, so called from being ripe about St. Margaret’s day--the 20th of\r\nJuly. The Magdalene, or Maudlin, from St. Magdalene’s day--the 22nd of\r\nJuly. And in Curtius[L] we find the _Joannina_, so called, “Quod circa\r\ndivi Joannis Baptistæ nativitatem esui sint.” These are also noticed\r\nby J. B. Porta; he says, “Est genus alterum quod quia circa festum\r\nDivi Joannis maturiscit, vulgus _Melo de San Giovanni_ dicitur.” And\r\naccording to Tragus,[M] “Quæ apud nos prima maturantur, Sanct Johans\r\nÖpffel, Latine, Præcocia mala dicuntur.”\r\n\r\nWe see, therefore, that they were called Joannina, because they ripened\r\nabout St. John’s Day. We have also among the old French pears Amiré\r\nJoannet--the Admired, or Wonderful Little John, which Merlet informs us\r\nwas so called, because it ripened about St. John’s Day. If then we add\r\nto Joannet the termination _ing_, so general among our names of apples,\r\nwe have _Joanneting_. There can be no doubt that this is the correct\r\nderivation, and signification of the name of this apple, and although\r\nthe orthography may for a time appear singular, it will in the course\r\nof usage become as familiar as the other forms in which it as been\r\nwritten.\r\n\r\n[K] Hist.

Eye, open, set in a round and\r\nplaited basin. Stalk, very short, imbedded in a rather shallow cavity.\r\nFlesh, yellow, firm, juicy, and sugary, with a particularly rich,\r\nmellow flavor, equal to, and even surpassing that of the Ribston Pippin.\r\n\r\nA delicious dessert apple, of first-rate quality: in use from October\r\nto January, and, under favorable circumstances, will even keep till\r\nMarch.\r\n\r\nThis is an apple which is very little known, and does not seem at all\r\nto be in general cultivation.

It succeeds well in almost every soil and situation, and\r\nwhen grown on the paradise stock, is well suited for espalier training.\r\n\r\nThis excellent apple was first discovered, growing among a quantity of\r\nrubbish, behind a wall at Gleaston Castle, near Ulverstone, and was\r\nfirst brought into notice by one John Sander, a nurseryman at Keswick,\r\nwho having propagated it, sent it out under the name of Keswick Codlin.\r\n\r\nIn the Memoirs of the Caledonian Horticultural Society, Sir John\r\nSinclair says, “the Keswick Codlin tree has never failed to bear a crop\r\nsince it was planted in the Episcopal garden at Rose Castle, Carlisle,\r\ntwenty years ago (1813). It is an apple of fine tartness and flavor,\r\nand may be used early in autumn. The tree is a very copious bearer,\r\nand the fruit is of good size, considerably larger than the Carlisle\r\nCodlin. It flourishes best in a strong soil.”\r\n\r\n\r\n198. KILKENNY PEARMAIN.--Hort.\r\n\r\n IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Soc.

Flesh,\r\nyellowish-white, firm, crisp, tender, and juicy, with a brisk and\r\npleasant flavor.\r\n\r\nAn excellent culinary apple, and serviceable also for the dessert; it\r\nis in use from November to April, when it is perfectly sound and shows\r\nno symptoms of shrivelling.\r\n\r\nThe tree attains about the middle size, is not a strong grower, but\r\nquite hardy, and an excellent bearer.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is no record of this variety in the writings of any\r\npomological author before Mr. Lindley, it is nevertheless a very old\r\nEnglish apple. In an ancient note-book of an ancestor of Sir John\r\nTrevelyan, Bart., of Nettlecombe, in Somersetshire, so early as 1580,\r\nthe “Lounden Peppen” is mentioned among the “names of Apelles which I\r\nhad their graffes from Brentmarch, from one Mr. Pace.” From this we\r\nmay learn, that we are not to take for granted the non-existence of\r\nany variety, simply because there is no notice of it, previous to the\r\nperiod when it may have been first recorded, in works on pomology.\r\n\r\n\r\n212. LONG NOSE.--H.\r\n\r\nFruit, rather below medium size, two inches and a half high, and about\r\nthe same in width at the base; conical, with prominent angles on the\r\nsides. Skin, smooth and shining, grass green, changing to greenish\r\nyellow, with a cloud of bright red on the side exposed to the sun.\r\nEye, closed, set in a shallow basin. Stalk, a quarter of an inch long,\r\nfleshy at the insertion, sometimes with a fleshy protuberance on one\r\nside of it, and inserted in a narrow, shallow, and russety cavity.\r\nFlesh, yellowish-white, crisp, and tender, with a slightly sweet but\r\nrather indifferent flavor.\r\n\r\nAn apple of little merit, being of no value either for culinary\r\npurposes or the dessert; it is in season from October to December, and\r\nis met with in the Berkshire Orchards.\r\n\r\n\r\n213. LONGSTART. H.\r\n\r\n SYNONYME.--Westmoreland Longstart.\r\n\r\nFruit, medium sized; roundish, narrowing towards the eye, somewhat\r\nlike the old Nonpareil in shape. Skin, almost entirely covered with\r\nred, which is streaked with deeper red; except on the shaded side\r\nwhere there is a patch of greenish-yellow, tinged with thin red. Eye,\r\npartially open, with broad, flat segments, and set in a shallow and\r\nplaited basin. Stalk, about an inch long, inserted in a wide cavity,\r\nwhich is lined with russet. Flesh, white, crisp, tender, juicy, with a\r\npleasant sub-acid flavor.\r\n\r\nA very excellent culinary apple; comes into use during October, and\r\nlasts till Christmas.\r\n\r\nThis variety is much grown about Lancaster, and some parts of\r\nWestmoreland, where it is a great favorite among the cottagers.\r\n\r\n\r\n214.

It is no doubt\r\nthe Margaret of Miller, but certainly not of any English author either\r\npreceeding, or subsequent to him. It is to be observed that the lists\r\nof fruits given by Miller in his Dictionary are chiefly taken from the\r\nworks of the French pomologists, while the fruits of his own country\r\nare almost wholly neglected; and the only reason I can assign for him\r\ndescribing this variety for the Margaret is, because our own Margaret\r\nbeing by some authors called the _Magdalene_, he might have thought the\r\ntwo synonymous.--See Margaret.\r\n\r\n\r\n218.

It is ripe\r\nin the beginning of August, and continues in use till November.\r\n\r\nThe tree is very hardy, and healthy, but not a large grower. It is a\r\nvery early and abundant bearer, young trees in the nursery quarters\r\ngenerally producing a considerable quantity of fruit, when only two\r\nyears old from the grafts. It is well suited for planting in exposed\r\nsituations, and succeeds well in shallow soils. It forms a beautiful\r\nlittle tree when grafted on the paradise stock, and is well adapted for\r\nespalier training.\r\n\r\n\r\n220. MANNINGTON’S PEARMAIN.--H.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFruit, medium sized; abrupt pearmain-shaped. Skin, of a rich\r\ngolden-yellow color, covered with thin brown russet, on the shaded\r\nside; but covered with dull brownish-red, on the side next the sun.\r\nEye, partially closed, with broad flat segments, set in a shallow\r\nand plaited basin. Stalk, three quarters of an inch long, obliquely\r\ninserted in a moderately deep cavity, with generally a fleshy\r\nprotuberance on one side of it. Flesh, yellow, firm, crisp, juicy, and\r\nvery sugary; with a brisk and particularly rich flavor.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the best and richest flavored of our dessert apples. It\r\nis only of recent introduction; but will no doubt, ere long, prove one\r\nof the most popular, as it is one of the most valuable varieties in its\r\nclass; not only on account of its excellence, but for the long period\r\nduring which it is in perfection; it comes into use in October and\r\nNovember, and continues in good condition till March.\r\n\r\nA communication of some importance has been forwarded to me by Mr.\r\nCameron of Uckfield, by whom this variety was first propagated. He\r\nsays the fruit should be allowed to hang late on the tree before it is\r\ngathered, so as to secure its peculiar richness of flavor, and long\r\nperiod of duration; for if gathered too soon, it looses much of its\r\nfine richness and is very apt to shrivel.\r\n\r\nThe tree does not attain a large size, but is perfectly hardy, and an\r\nearly and excellent bearer; young trees, only two or three years from\r\nthe graft, producing a considerable crop of handsome, well-grown fruit.\r\n\r\nThis esteemed variety originated about the year 1770, in a garden now\r\nin the possession of Mr. Mannington, a respectable butcher at Uckfield\r\nin Sussex. At the time it was raised the garden belonged to Mr. Turley,\r\na blacksmith, and grandfather of Mr. Mannington. The original tree grew\r\nup at the root of a hedge, where the refuse from a cider press had been\r\nthrown; it never attained any great size, but continued to preserve a\r\nstunted, and diminutive habit of growth, till it died about the year\r\n1820. Previous to this, however, grafts had been freely distributed to\r\npersons in the neighbourhood, many of whom were anxious to possess such\r\na desideratum; but it does not seem to have been known beyond its own\r\nlocality, till the autumn of 1847, when Mr. Mannington caused specimens\r\nof the fruit to be forwarded to the London Horticultural Society,\r\nand by whom it was pronounced to be a dessert fruit of the highest\r\nexcellence. It was designated by Mr. Thompson “Mannington’s Pearmain.”\r\n\r\n\r\n221. MARGARET.--Rea.\r\n\r\n IDENTIFICATION.--Rea. Pom. 209. Raii. Hist. ii. 1447. Lang. Pom. 134,\r\n t. lxxiv. fig. 1. Rog. Fr.

Flesh, greenish-white, brisk, juicy, and vinous,\r\nwith a pleasant and very refreshing flavor.\r\n\r\nA first-rate early dessert apple; it is ripe in the beginning of\r\nAugust, but does not keep long, being very liable to become meally. To\r\nhave it in perfection, it is well to gather it a few days before it\r\nripens on the tree, and thereby secure its juicy, and vinous flavor.\r\n\r\nThe tree does not attain a large size, being rather a small grower.\r\nIt is a good bearer, more so than the Joanneting, and is quite hardy,\r\nexcept in light soils, when it is liable to canker. It is well adapted\r\nfor growing as dwarfs, either for potting or being trained as an\r\nespalier, when grafted on the paradise, or pomme paradis stock.\r\n\r\nThis is a very old English apple. It is without doubt the Margaret\r\nof Rea, Worldige, Ray, and all our early pomologists except Miller;\r\nMr. Lindley, however, is of a different opinion, for he believes the\r\nMargaret of Miller to be identical with that of Ray. That this variety\r\nis the Margaret of Rea, his description is sufficient evidence. “The\r\n_Margaret or Magdelen Apple_ is a fair and beautiful fruit, yellow, and\r\nthick striped with red, early ripe, of a delicate taste, sweet flavor,\r\nand best eaten off the tree.” Ray gives _no description_ of it, but it\r\nis only reasonable to suppose, that it is this variety he refers to,\r\nseeing it is the Margaret of all authors both immediately preceeding,\r\nand subsequent to him. And indeed in no instance is that of Miller\r\nnoticed by any English author, but himself, anterior to Mr. Lindley.\r\n\r\n\r\n222. MARGIL.--Hook.\r\n\r\n IDENTIFICATION.--Hook. Pom. Lond. Hort. Soc.

It\r\nis of a small, and slender habit of growth, and is well adapted for\r\ngrowing as dwarfs, or espaliers, when grafted on the paradise stock.\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no record of this variety before the publication\r\nof the _Pomona Londonensis_, although it was known for many years\r\npreviously. Rogers says, he saw a tree of it growing as an espalier in\r\nthe garden at Sheen, which was planted by Sir William Temple. I find it\r\nwas cultivated to a considerable extent in the Brompton Park nursery,\r\nso early as 1750; it must therefore have been well known at that\r\nperiod; but I cannot discover any trace of its origin. It may have been\r\nintroduced from the continent by George London who was for some years\r\nin the gardens at Versailles under De Quintinye, and afterwards in\r\npartnership with Henry Wise as proprietor of the Brompton Park nursery,\r\nas the name seems to indicate more of French than English origin.\r\n\r\n\r\n223.

From this circumstance\r\nit became generally known by the name of the Nelson Apple.

It\r\nis in use from December to April. This description being taken from an\r\nimported specimen, it must not be expected that fruit grown in this\r\ncountry, will attain the same degree of perfection; for like most of\r\nthe best American apples, it does not succeed in this climate. Even\r\nwith the protection of a wall, and in the most favorable situation, it\r\ndoes not possess that peculiarly rich aroma, which characterizes the\r\nimported fruit.\r\n\r\nThe tree is a slender, and slow grower, and is always distinguished,\r\neven in its young state, by the roughness of its bark. It prefers a\r\nstrong, rich, and genial soil, and, according to Coxe, does not arrive\r\nat maturity till 20 or 25 years old.\r\n\r\nThis is an old American apple. It originated at Newtown, on Long\r\nIsland, U. S., and was introduced to this country about the middle\r\nof the last century. I find it was cultivated in the Brompton Park\r\nnursery so early as 1768, under the name of “Newtown Pippin from New\r\nYork.” Forsyth remarks that it is said to have been originally from\r\nDevonshire, but if it were so, there would still have been some trace\r\nof it left in that county. It is extensively cultivated in New York,\r\nand all the middle states, and particularly on the Hudson, where the\r\nfinest American orchards are. There are immense quantities produced\r\nwhich are packed in barrels and exported to Britain and other parts.\r\nThe month of January, is generally the season they arrive in this\r\ncountry, and then they are the most attractive of all dessert apples in\r\nCovent Garden market; the name serving in many instances, as a decoy\r\nfor the sale of many other and inferior varieties. The Alfriston, in\r\nmany collections, is erroneously cultivated under the name of Newtown\r\nPippin.\r\n\r\n\r\n242. NEWTOWN SPITZENBERG.--Coxe.\r\n\r\n IDENTIFICATION.--Coxe. View. 126. Hort. Soc.

It prefers a light and warm soil,\r\nsucceeds well on the paradise stock, and is well adapted for growing\r\nin pots, when grafted on the pomme paradis of the French. Bradley in\r\none of his tracts records an instance of it being so cultivated. “Mr.\r\nFairchild (of Hoxton) has now (February) one of the Nonpareile apples\r\nupon a small tree, in a pot, which seems capable of holding good till\r\nthe blossoms of this year have ripened their fruit.” In the northern\r\ncounties and in Scotland, it does not succeed as a standard as it does\r\nin the south, and even when grown against a wall, there is a marked\r\ncontrast in the flavor when compared with the standard grown fruit of\r\nthe south.\r\n\r\nIt is generally allowed that the Nonpareil is originally from France.\r\nSwitzer says “It is no stranger in England; though it might have its\r\noriginal from France, yet there are trees of them about the Ashtons in\r\nOxfordshire, of about a hundred years old, which (as they have it by\r\ntradition) was first brought out of France and planted by a Jesuit in\r\nQueen Mary or Queen Elizabeth’s time.” It is strange, however, that an\r\napple of such excellence, and held in such estimation as the Nonpareil\r\nhas always been, should have received so little notice from almost all\r\nthe early continental pomologists. It is not mentioned in the long\r\nlist of the Jardinier François of 1653, nor even by De Quintinye, or\r\nthe Jardinier Solitaire. Schabol enumerates it, but it is not noticed\r\nby Bretonnerie. It is first described by Duhamel and subsequently by\r\nKnoop. In the Chartreux catalogue it is said “elle est forte estimée\r\nen Angleterre”, but, among the writers of our own country, Switzer is\r\nthe first to notice it.

Skin, smooth and shining, deep\r\ngrassy green, strewed with imbedded grey specks, and dotted with brown\r\nrussety dots on the shaded side; but washed with thin brownish-red,\r\nwhich is marked with spots or patches of darker and livelier red,\r\nand strewed with star-like freckles of russet on the side exposed to\r\nthe sun. Eye, small and closed, placed in a rather deep and angular\r\nbasin, which is lined with linear marks of rough russet. Stalk, about\r\nhalf-an-inch long, somewhat obliquely inserted by the side of a fleshy\r\nswelling, which is more or less prominent. Flesh, greenish-white,\r\ntender, crisp, and brittle, abounding in a profusion of rich, brisk,\r\nsugary, and vinous juice, with a finely perfumed and refreshing flavor.\r\n\r\nAn excellent apple, of first-rate quality, and well deserving of more\r\ngeneral cultivation; It is in use from January to May, and keeps well.\r\n\r\nSome thirty years ago, Ord’s apple was brought into public notice\r\nas a variety which was worthy of universal cultivation; and was\r\nconsidered of such importance as to form the subject of a paper in the\r\nHorticultural Society’s Transactions, by A. Salisbury Esq. At that\r\ntime it was received into all the collections in the London nurseries,\r\nand was very generally grown; but in the course of years it was again\r\nlost sight of, and I believe there are now very few places where it\r\nis to be met with. I shall be glad, however, if this notice should\r\ndirect the attention of some lover of a good apple, to rescue this\r\nexcellent variety from the oblivion into which it is likely to fall,\r\nand to restore it to the position it once occupied as one of our finest\r\ndessert apples.\r\n\r\nThis excellent variety originated at Purser’s Cross, near Fulham,\r\nMiddlesex. It was raised in the garden of John Ord, Esq. by his\r\nsister-in-law, Mrs. Anne Simpson, from seed of a Newtown Pippin\r\nimported in 1777. There is another variety called _Simpson’s Seedling_,\r\nraised from the seed of Ord’s apple, to which it is very similar; but\r\nbeing much inferior in quality, its cultivation has been in a great\r\nmeasure discontinued.\r\n\r\n\r\n252.

Skin, thick and\r\nmembranous, of a fine pale yellow color, and thickly strewed with brown\r\ndots; very frequently cracked, forming large and deep sinuosities on\r\nthe fruit. Eye, scarcely at all depressed. Stalk, short and thick,\r\ninserted in a very shallow cavity. Flesh, yellowish, firm, crisp\r\nand juicy, rich and sugary, with a highly aromatic flavor, which is\r\npeculiar to this apple only.\r\n\r\nA dessert apple of the highest excellence; ripe in the end of August,\r\nand continues during September, but does not last long. Nicol says\r\n“this is an excellent apple, as to flavor it is outdone by none but the\r\nNonpareil, over which it has this advantage, that it will ripen in a\r\nworse climate and a worse aspect.”\r\n\r\nThe tree is a free grower, of an upright habit, and an excellent\r\nbearer; but is subject to canker as it grows old. The branches are\r\ngenerally covered with a number of knobs or burrs; and when planted in\r\nthe ground these burrs throw out numerous fibres which take root and\r\nproduce a perfect tree.\r\n\r\nThis is a very old Scotch apple, supposed to have originated at\r\nArbroath; or to have been introduced from France by the monks of the\r\nAbbey which formerly existed at that place. The latter opinion is, in\r\nall probability, the correct one, although the name, or any of the\r\nsynonymes quoted above are not now to be met with in any modern French\r\nlists. But in the “Jardinier François” which was published in 1651, I\r\nfind an apple mentioned under the name of Orgeran, which is so similar\r\nin pronounciation to Orgeline, I think it not unlikely it may be the\r\nsame name with a change of orthography, especially as our ancestors\r\nwere not over particular, in preserving unaltered the names of foreign\r\nintroductions.\r\n\r\n\r\n253.

It was first noticed by Mr. George\r\nLindley whose description of it I have given above. He says “it is\r\nsupposed to have originated at Oxnead, near Norwich, the seat of the\r\nEarl of Yarmouth. It has been known many years in Norfolk, no doubt\r\nprior to the extinction of that Peerage in 1733, and I have never seen\r\nit out of the county.

POMEROY.\r\n\r\nThere are two very distinct varieties of apples, which, in different\r\nparts of the country, are known by the same name of Pomeroy. The one is\r\nthat which is cultivated in Somersetshire and the West of England, and\r\nthe other is peculiar to Lancashire and the Northern counties.\r\n\r\nThe POMEROY _of Somerset_, is medium sized, two inches and three\r\nquarters wide, and the same in height; conical. Skin, greenish-yellow,\r\ncovered with thin grey russet, on the shaded side; but orange, covered\r\nwith stripes of deep red, and marked with patches and spots of russet\r\non the side exposed to the sun, and strewed all over with numerous\r\nlarge, dark russety dots. Eye, open, set in a round and even basin.\r\nStalk, short, not extending beyond the base, inserted in a round, even,\r\nand russety cavity. Flesh, yellow, firm, crisp, juicy, sugary, and\r\nhighly flavored.\r\n\r\nAn excellent dessert apple; in use from October till December.\r\n\r\nThe POMEROY _of Lancashire_, is medium sized, two inches and three\r\nquarters wide, and two inches and a half high; roundish, slightly\r\nribbed at the apex. Skin, smooth, pale yellow on the shaded side, but\r\nclear pale red next the sun, which blends with the yellow towards the\r\nshaded side, so as to form orange; the whole covered with russety dots.\r\nEye, small and closed, placed in a small and shallow basin. Stalk,\r\nshort, imbedded in an angular cavity with a swelling on one side of it,\r\nand from which issue a few ramifications of russet. Flesh, whitish,\r\ntender, crisp, juicy, and with a brisk flavor, a good deal like that of\r\nthe Manks Codlin.\r\n\r\nAn excellent culinary apple; in use during September and October.\r\n\r\nThe tree is healthy, hardy, and an excellent bearer, well adapted for\r\norchard planting, and succeeds well in almost all situations.\r\n\r\nThere are several other varieties which are cultivated under this\r\nappellation, to which local specific names are attached; but as I\r\nhave not seen any of these, they will be found among the “additional\r\nvarieties” at the end of that portion of this work which treats on the\r\napple.\r\n\r\n\r\n275. POMEWATER.--Gerard.\r\n\r\n IDENTIFICATION.--Ger. Herb. Park. Par. 587. Raii. Hist. ii. 1447.\r\n\r\nFruit, medium sized, two inches and three quarters wide, and two inches\r\nand a half high; roundish, and narrowing a little towards the apex,\r\ndistinctly five-sided, and terminating at the crown in five prominent\r\nridges. Skin smooth, yellowish-green, tinged with thin brownish-red\r\nin the shade; but covered with dark dull red on the side next the\r\nsun. Eye, closed, placed in a rather deep and angular basin. Stalk,\r\nstout, an inch long, inserted in a round and even cavity. Flesh,\r\ngreenish-white, firm, crisp, and pleasantly flavored.\r\n\r\nA culinary apple; in use from December to January.\r\n\r\nI think there is little doubt that this is the Pome Water of Gerard. It\r\nis still grown in Lancashire, and on the borders of Cheshire, of which\r\ncounty Gerard was a native, and with the fruits of which, he was, in\r\nall probability, best acquainted.\r\n\r\n\r\n276. PONTO PIPPIN.--Hort.\r\n\r\n IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3, n. 594.\r\n\r\nFruit, medium sized, two inches and a half wide, and the same in\r\nheight; conical, narrow at the eye. Skin, pale greenish-yellow in the\r\nshade; but red on the side next the sun, and strewed all over with\r\nspots and dots of dark russet. Eye, small and closed, set in a narrow\r\nand irregular basin. Stalk, short, set in a wide and shallow cavity.\r\nFlesh, greenish-white, crisp, tender, juicy, sugary, with a brisk and\r\nrich flavor.\r\n\r\nA dessert apple, of good, though not of first-rate quality; it is in\r\nuse from November to February.\r\n\r\n\r\n277. POPE’S APPLE.--H.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFruit, large; ovate, handsomely and regularly formed. Skin, clear\r\nyellow, tinged with greenish patches, and strewed with dark dots;\r\non the side next the sun it is marked with a few faint streaks of\r\ncrimson. Eye, large and open, like that of the Blenheim Pippin, and\r\nset in a wide and plaited basin. Stalk, short, deeply inserted in a\r\nround cavity, which is lined with rough russet, and with an incipient\r\nprotuberance on one side of it. Flesh, yellowish, tender, crisp, sugary\r\nand juicy, with a rich and excellent flavor.\r\n\r\nA very valuable apple either for the dessert or culinary purposes; it\r\nis in use from November to March.\r\n\r\nThis variety has all the properties of the Blenheim Pippin, and is much\r\nsuperior to it, keeps longer, and has the great advantage of being an\r\nearly and abundant bearer.\r\n\r\nThis excellent apple is as yet but little known. I met with it in the\r\nneighbourhood of Sittingbourne, in Kent, where it is greatly esteemed\r\nand now extensively cultivated for the supply of the London markets.\r\nThe account I received of it was, that the original tree grew in the\r\ngarden of a cottager of the name of Pope, at Cellar Hill, in the parish\r\nof Linstead, near Sittingbourne. It was highly prized by its owner, to\r\nwhom the crop afforded a little income, and many were the unsuccessful\r\napplications of his neighbours for grafts of what became generally\r\nknown as _Pope’s Apple_. The proprietor of this cottage built a row\r\nof other dwellings adjoining it, in the gardens of which there were\r\nno fruit trees; for the sake of uniformity, and in spite of Pope’s\r\nimportunities and the offer of twenty shillings annual increase in the\r\nrental, the tree was condemned, and cut down in 1846, at which period\r\nit was between 50 and 60 years old. A few days after it was destroyed,\r\nMr. Fairbeard, a nurseryman at Green Street, procured a number of the\r\ngrafts which he was successful in propagating, and it is to him I am\r\nindebted for this variety.\r\n\r\n\r\n278.

Skin, almost entirely covered\r\nwith pale brown russet; but where any portion of the ground color is\r\nvisible, it is greenish-yellow on the shaded side, and tinged with\r\nbrown where exposed to the sun. Eye, open, placed in a round, even, and\r\nshallow basin. Stalk, about half-an-inch long, inserted in a rather\r\nwide, and shallow cavity. Flesh, yellow, firm, very juicy and sugary,\r\nwith a rich and highly aromatic flavor.\r\n\r\nA dessert apple of the very first quality; it is in use from November\r\nto February.\r\n\r\n\r\n279. PROLIFEROUS REINETTE.--H.\r\n\r\nFruit, medium sized, two inches and three quarters wide, and the same\r\nin height; oval, with ten obscure ribs, extending from the base to the\r\napex, where they form five small crowns. Skin, of a dull yellow ground\r\ncolor, marked with small broken stripes or streaks of crimson, and\r\nthickly covered with small russety specks. Eye, closed, placed in a\r\nshallow, plaited, and knobbed basin. Stalk, from half-an-inch to three\r\nquarters long, deeply inserted the whole of its length in a round and\r\nsmooth cavity. Flesh, yellowish-white, very juicy and sugary, with a\r\nrich and brisk flavor.\r\n\r\nA very fine, briskly flavored dessert apple; in use from October to\r\nDecember.\r\n\r\nI received this variety from the garden at Hammersmith, formerly in the\r\npossession of the late Mr. James Lee.\r\n\r\n\r\n280. QUEEN OF SAUCE.--H.\r\n\r\nFruit, large, three inches and a quarter broad, and two inches and a\r\nhalf high; obtuse-ovate, broad and flat at the base, narrowing towards\r\nthe crown, and angular on the sides. Skin, greenish-yellow on the\r\nshaded side; but on the side exposed to the sun it is flushed with red,\r\nwhich is marked with broken streaks of deeper red; it is strewed all\r\nover with patches of thin delicate russet, and large russety specks,\r\nthose round the eye being linear. Eye, open, set in a deep and angular\r\nbasin, which is russety at the base. Stalk, about a quarter of an inch\r\nlong, deeply inserted in a round cavity, which is lined with coarse\r\nrusset. Flesh, yellowish, firm, crisp, juicy and sugary, with a brisk\r\nand pleasant flavor.\r\n\r\nA culinary apple of first-rate quality, and not unworthy of the\r\ndessert; it is in use from November to January.\r\n\r\n\r\n281. RABINE.--Hort.\r\n\r\nFruit, above medium size, three inches and a quarter wide, and two\r\ninches and a quarter high; roundish, and much flattened, ribbed on the\r\nsides, and undulated round the margin of the basin of the eye. Skin,\r\ngreenish-yellow, marked with a few faint, broken streaks and freckles\r\nof red, and strewed with grey russety dots on the shaded side; but\r\ndark dull red, marked and mottled with stripes of deeper red, on the\r\nside next the sun. Eye, partially open, with broad flat segments,\r\nand placed in an angular basin. Stalk, short, inserted in a deep and\r\nuneven cavity, from which issue a few linear markings of russet. Flesh,\r\nyellowish, tender, crisp, very juicy and sugary, with a brisk and\r\npleasant flavor.\r\n\r\nAn excellent apple, suitable either for culinary purposes or for the\r\ndessert, but more properly for the former; it is in use from October to\r\nChristmas.\r\n\r\n\r\n282.

Prose and verse were both enlisted in its favor.\r\nIt was chiefly by the writings of Evelyn it attained its greatest\r\ncelebrity. Philips, in his poem--_Cyder_, says\r\n\r\n    “Let every tree in every garden own\r\n    The Red Streak as supreme, whose pulpous fruit,\r\n    With gold irradiate, and vermilion, shines\r\n    Tempting, not fatal, as the birth of that\r\n    Primæval, interdicted plant, that won\r\n    Fond Eve, in hapless hour to taste, and die.\r\n    This, of more bounteous influence, inspires\r\n    Poetic raptures, and the lowly muse\r\n    Kindles to loftier strains; even I, perceive\r\n    Her sacred virtue. See! the numbers flow\r\n    Easy, whilst, cheer’d with her nectareous juice,\r\n    Her’s, and my country’s praises, I exalt.”\r\n\r\nbut its reputation began to decline about the beginning of the last\r\ncentury, for we find Nourse saying, “As for the liquor which it yields,\r\nit is highly esteemed for its noble colour and smell; ’tis likewise fat\r\nand oily in the taste, but withal very windy, luscious and fulsome, and\r\nwill sooner clog the stomach than any other cider whatsoever, leaving a\r\nwaterish, raw humour upon it; so that with meals it is no way helpful,\r\nand they who drink it, if I may judge of them by my own palate, will\r\nfind their stomachs pall’d sooner by it, than warm’d and enliven’d.”\r\n\r\nThe Red Streak seems to have originated about the beginning of the 17th\r\ncentury, for Evelyn says “it was within the memory of some now living,\r\nsurnamed the Scudamore’s Crab, and then not much known save in the\r\nneighbourhood.” It was called Scudamore’s Crab, from being extensively\r\nplanted by the first Lord Scudamore, who was son of Sir James\r\nScudamore, from whom Spencer is said to have taken the character of\r\nSir Scudamore in his “Fairie Queen.” He was born in 1600, and created\r\nby Charles I. Baron Dromore and Viscount Scudamore. He was attending\r\nthe Duke of Buckingham when he was stabbed at Portsmouth, and was so\r\naffected at the event that he retired into private life, and devoted\r\nhis attention to planting orchards, of which the Red-Streak formed the\r\nprincipal variety. In 1634 he was sent as ambassador to France, in\r\nwhich capacity he continued for four years. He was a zealous royalist\r\nduring the civil wars, and was taken prisoner by the parliament party,\r\nwhile his property was destroyed, and his estate sequestered. He died\r\nin 1671.\r\n\r\n\r\n289. RED STREAKED RAWLING.--H.\r\n\r\n SYNONYME AND FIGURE.--Rawling’s Fine Redstreak. Ron. Pyr.

Now\r\nwhat I have to inform you of is, _viz._: I have a tree which bears both\r\nsorts in one apple; one side of the apple is altogether sweet, the\r\nother side sour; one side bigger than the other; and when boiled the\r\none side is soft, the other hard, as all sweet and sour apples are.”\r\n\r\n\r\n290.

In all the southern and middle counties of England it\r\nsucceeds well as an open standard; but in the north, and in Scotland,\r\nit requires the protection of a wall to bring it to perfection. Nicol\r\ncalls it “a universal apple for these kingdoms; it will thrive at John\r\nO’Groat’s, while it deserves a place at Exeter or at Cork.”\r\n\r\nThere is no apple which has ever been introduced to this country, or\r\nindigenous to it, which is more generally cultivated, more familiarly\r\nknown, or held in higher popular estimation, than the Ribston Pippin.\r\nIt has long been in existence in this country, but did not become\r\ngenerally known till the end of the last century. It is not mentioned\r\nin any of the editions of Miller’s Dictionary, or by any other author\r\nof that period; neither was it grown in the Brompton Park nursery in\r\n1770. In 1785 I find it was grown to the extent of a quarter of a row,\r\nor about 25 plants; and as this supply seems to have sufficed for three\r\nyears’ demand, its merits must have been but little known. In 1788,\r\nit extended to one row, or about one hundred plants, and three years\r\nlater to two rows; from 1791, it increased one row annually, till 1794,\r\nwhen it reached five rows. From these facts we may pretty well learn\r\nthe rise and progress of its popularity. It is now in the same nursery\r\ncultivated to the extent of about 25 rows, or 2500 plants annually.\r\n\r\nThe original tree was first discovered growing in the garden at Ribston\r\nHall, near Knaresborough, but how, when, or by what means it came\r\nthere, has not been satisfactorily ascertained. One account states\r\nthat about the year 1688, some apple pips were brought from Rouen and\r\nsown at Ribston Hall, near Knaresborough; the trees then produced from\r\nthem were planted in the park, and one turned out to be the variety in\r\nquestion. The original tree stood till 1810, when it was blown down\r\nby a violent gale of wind. It was afterwards supported by stakes in a\r\nhorizontal position, and continued to produce fruit till it lingered\r\nand died in 1835. Since then, a young shoot has been produced about\r\nfour inches below the surface of the ground, which, with proper care,\r\nmay become a tree, and thereby preserve the original of this favorite\r\nold dessert apple. The gardener at Ribston Hall, by whom this apple was\r\nraised, was the father of Lowe, who during the last century was the\r\nfruit tree nurseryman at Hampton Wick.\r\n\r\n\r\n302.

Eye, prominent, not at all depressed, and\r\nclosed with broad flat segments. Stalk, half-an-inch long, stout, and\r\ninserted in a slight depression. Flesh, greenish, tender, crisp, sweet,\r\nand very juicy; with a fine, brisk, poignant, and slightly perfumed\r\nflavor, much resembling that of the Golden Pippin and Nonpareil.\r\n\r\nA very excellent dessert apple of first-rate quality; it is in use from\r\nDecember to February. The fruit is produced in clusters of sometimes\r\neight and ten, at the ends of the branches.\r\n\r\nThe tree is of small size and slender growth, and not a free bearer.\r\nIt is well adapted for dwarf and espalier training when grafted on the\r\ndoucin or paradise stock, in which case it also bears better than on\r\nthe crab stock.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Lindley this variety was grown for many years in the\r\nold kitchen garden at Kew; and Rogers thinks it first originated in the\r\nTurnham Green nursery, which was during a portion of the last century,\r\noccupied by a person of the name of Robinson.\r\n\r\n\r\n303.

It is in use during November and December.\r\n\r\n\r\n322. SCOTCH BRIDGET--H.\r\n\r\nFruit, medium sized, two inches and three quarters wide, and two\r\ninches and a quarter high; roundish, broadest at the base, and\r\nnarrowing towards the apex, where it is rather knobbed, caused by the\r\nterminations of the angles on the sides. Skin, smooth, greenish-yellow,\r\non the shaded side, and almost entirely covered with bright deep red on\r\nthe side next the sun. Eye, closed, set in an angular and warted basin.\r\nStalk, three quarters of an inch long, straight, thick, and stout,\r\ninserted in a very narrow and shallow cavity. Flesh, white, tender,\r\nsoft, juicy, and briskly flavored.\r\n\r\nAn excellent culinary apple, much grown in the neighbourhood of\r\nLancaster; in use from October to January.\r\n\r\n\r\n323. SCREVETON GOLDEN PIPPIN.--Hort.\r\n\r\n IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Trans. iv. 218. Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3, n. 288.\r\n\r\nFruit, larger than the old Golden Pippin, and little, if at all,\r\ninferior to it in flavor. Skin, yellowish, considerably marked with\r\nrusset. Flesh, yellow, and more tender than the old Golden Pippin.\r\n\r\nA dessert apple of first-rate quality; raised in the garden of Sir John\r\nThoroton, Bart., at Screveton, in Nottinghamshire, about the year 1808.\r\nIt is in use from December to April.\r\n\r\n\r\n324. SEEK-NO-FARTHER.--Ronalds.\r\n\r\n IDENTIFICATION & FIGURE.--Ron. Pyr. Mal. 45, pl. xxiii. f. 3.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFruit, medium sized; conical, or pearmain-shaped. Skin,\r\nyellowish-green, streaked with broken patches of crimson, on the shaded\r\nside; and strewed with grey russety dots; but covered with light red,\r\nwhich is marked with crimson streaks, and covered with patches of fine\r\ndelicate russet, and numerous large, square, and stelloid russety\r\nspecks like scales, on the side exposed to the sun. Eye, small and\r\nclosed, with broad, flat, segments, the edges of which fit neatly\r\nto each other, set in a rather deep and plaited basin. Stalk, about\r\nhalf-an-inch long, stout, and inserted in a deep, round, and regular\r\ncavity. Flesh, greenish-yellow, crisp, juicy, rich, sugary, and vinous,\r\ncharged with a pleasant aromatic flavor.\r\n\r\nAn excellent dessert apple of first-rate quality. It is in use from\r\nNovember to January.\r\n\r\nThis is the true old _Seek-no-farther_.\r\n\r\n\r\n325. SELWOOD’S REINETTE.--Rog.\r\n\r\n IDENTIFICATION.--Rog. Fr. Cult. 103.\r\n\r\nFruit, large, three inches wide, and about two inches and a half high;\r\nround and flattened, angular on the sides, and with five prominent\r\nplaits round the eye, which is small, open, and not at all depressed,\r\nbut rather elevated on the surface. Skin, pale green, almost entirely\r\ncovered with red, which is marked with broken stripes of darker red,\r\nthose on the shaded side being paler, and not so numerous as on the\r\nside exposed to the sun. Stalk, about half-an-inch long, very stout,\r\nand inserted the whole of its length in a russety cavity. Flesh,\r\ngreenish-white, tender, brisk, and pleasantly flavored.\r\n\r\nA culinary apple, of good, but not first-rate, quality. It is in use\r\nfrom December to March.\r\n\r\nThe tree is a strong and healthy grower, and an abundant bearer.\r\n\r\nThis is certainly a different variety from the Selwood’s Reinette of\r\nthe Horticultural Society’s Catalogue, which is described as being\r\nsmall, pearmain-shaped, greenish-yellow, and a dessert apple. It is\r\nhowever, identical with the Selwood’s Reinette of Rogers, who, as we\r\nare informed, in his “Fruit Cultivator,” received it upwards of sixty\r\nyears ago from Messrs. Hewitt and Co., of Brompton. The tree now in\r\nmy possession, I procured as a graft from the private garden of the\r\nlate Mr. Lee, of Hammersmith; and as it has proved to be the same as\r\nRogers’s variety, I am induced to think that it is correct, while that\r\nof the Horticultural Society is wrong. It was raised by a person of the\r\nname of Selwood, of Lancaster.\r\n\r\n\r\n326. SHAKESPERE.--M.\r\n\r\n IDENTIFICATION & FIGURE.--Maund Fruit. pl. 71.\r\n\r\nFruit, medium sized, two inches and three quarters wide, and two inches\r\nand a half high; roundish, narrowing a little towards the eye. Skin,\r\ndark green on the shaded side, and brownish-red on the side next the\r\nsun, which is marked with a few broken stripes of darker red; the\r\nwhole strewed with russety dots. Eye, small, and partially open, set\r\nin a narrow and irregular basin, which is ridged round the margin.\r\nStalk, short and slender, inserted in a rather deep cavity. Flesh,\r\ngreenish-yellow, firm, crisp, and juicy, with a brisk vinous flavor.\r\n\r\nAn excellent dessert apple, of first-rate quality. In use from\r\nChristmas to April.\r\n\r\nThis variety was raised by Thomas Hunt, Esq., of Stratford-on-Avon,\r\nfrom the seed of Hunt’s Duke of Gloucester, and named in honor of the\r\npoet Shakespere.\r\n\r\n\r\n327. SHEEP’S NOSE.--Hort.\r\n\r\n SYNONYMES.--Bullock’s Pippin, _Coxe View_, 125. Long Tom, _Ibid._\r\n\r\nFruit, large, about three inches and a half long, and about three\r\ninches wide; conical, narrowing gradually to the crown, which is\r\nconsiderably higher on one side than the other; generally with ten ribs\r\non the sides. Skin, smooth, yellow, and strewed with a few russety\r\ndots. Eye, small, set in a deep, plaited basin. Stalk, short, inserted\r\nin a deep round, and russety cavity. Flesh, yellowish-white, tender,\r\nvery juicy, and sweet.\r\n\r\nA very good variety for culinary purposes; but chiefly used as a cider\r\napple in Somersetshire, where it is much grown for that purpose.\r\n\r\n\r\n328. SHEPHERD’S FAME.--Hort.\r\n\r\nFruit, large, three inches and a quarter wide, and two inches and a\r\nhalf high; obtuse-ovate, broad and flattened at the base, narrowing\r\ntowards the eye, with five prominent ribs on the sides, and in every\r\nrespect, very much resembling a small specimen of Emperor Alexander.\r\nSkin, smooth, pale straw-yellow, marked with faint broken patches\r\nof crimson, on the shaded side; but streaked with yellow and bright\r\ncrimson, on the side next the sun. Eye, open, with short, stunted\r\nsegments, placed in a deep, angular, and plaited basin. Stalk, short,\r\nimbedded in a round, funnel-shaped cavity. Flesh, yellowish, soft, and\r\ntender, transparent, sweet, and briskly flavored, but rather dry.\r\n\r\nAn apple of very ordinary quality, in use from October to March.\r\n\r\n\r\n329. SIBERIAN BITTER SWEET.--Knight.\r\n\r\n IDENTIFICATION.--Pom. Heref. t. 23. Lind. Guide, 111. Down. Fr. Amer.\r\n 146.\r\n\r\nFruit, small, and nearly globular. Eye, small, with short connivent\r\nsegments of the calyx. Stalk, short. Skin, of a bright gold color,\r\ntinged with faint and deeper red on the sunny side. The fruit grows a\r\ngood deal in clusters, on slender wing branches.\r\n\r\nSpecific gravity of the juice, 1091.\r\n\r\nThis remarkable apple was raised by Mr. Knight from the seed of the\r\nYellow Siberian Crab, impregnated with the pollen of the Golden Harvey.\r\nI cannot do better than transcribe from the Transactions of the London\r\nHorticultural Society, Mr. Knight’s own account of this apple. “The\r\nfruit contains much saccharine matter, with scarcely any perceptible\r\nacid; and it in consequence affords a cider, which is perfectly free\r\nfrom the harshness which in that liquid offends the palate of many, and\r\nthe constitution of more; and I believe that there is not any county in\r\nEngland in which it might not be made to afford, at a moderate price,\r\na very wholesome and very palatable cider. This fruit differs from\r\nall others of its species with which I am acquainted, in being always\r\nsweet, and without acidity, even when it is more than half grown.\r\n\r\n“When the juice is pressed from ripe, and somewhat mellow fruit,\r\nit contains a very large portion of saccharine matter; and if a\r\npart of the water it contains be made to evaporate in a moderately\r\nlow temperature, it affords a large quantity of a jelly of intense\r\nsweetness, which to my palate is extremely agreeable; and which may be\r\nemployed for purposes similiar to those to which the inspissated juice\r\nof the grape is applied in France. The jelly of the apple prepared\r\nin the manner above described, is, I believe, capable of being kept\r\nunchanged during a very long period in any climate; the mucilage\r\nbeing preserved by the antiseptic powers of the saccharine matter,\r\nand that being incapable of acquiring, as sugar does, a state of\r\ncrystallization. If the juice be properly filtered, the jelly will be\r\nperfectly transparent.”\r\n\r\nThe tree is a strong and vigorous grower; a most abundant bearer, and a\r\nperfect dreadnought to the woolly aphis.\r\n\r\n\r\n330. SIBERIAN HARVEY.--Knight.\r\n\r\n IDENTIFICATION.--Pom. Heref. t. 23. Lind. Guide, 111. Hort. Soc. Cat.\r\n ed. 3, n. 777.\r\n\r\nFruit, produced in clusters, small; nearly globular. Eye, small, with\r\nshort connivent segments of the calyx. Stalk, short. Skin, of a bright\r\ngold color, tinged with faint and deeper red on the sunny side. Juice\r\nvery sweet. Ripe in October.\r\n\r\nSpecific gravity of the juice, 1091.\r\n\r\nA cider apple raised by T. A. Knight, Esq., and, along with the Foxley,\r\nconsidered by him superior to any other varieties in cultivation. It\r\nwas produced from a seed of the Yellow Siberian Crab, fertilized with\r\nthe pollen of the Golden Harvey, the juice of this variety is most\r\nintensely sweet, and is probably, very nearly what that of the Golden\r\nHarvey would be in a southern climate, the original tree produced its\r\nblossoms in the year 1807, when it first obtained the annual premium of\r\nthe Herefordshire Agricultural Society.\r\n\r\n\r\n331. SIELY’S MIGNONNE.--Lind.\r\n\r\n IDENTIFICATION.--Lind. Guide, 98.\r\n\r\n SYNONYME.--Pride of the Ditches, _acc. Lind. Guide_.\r\n\r\nFruit, rather small, about one inch and three quarters deep, and the\r\nsame in diameter; almost globular, but occasionally flattened on one\r\nside. Eye, small, with a closed calyx, placed somewhat deeply in a\r\nrather irregularly formed narrow basin, surrounded by a few small\r\nplaits. Stalk, half-an-inch long, slender, about one half within the\r\nbase, in a narrow cavity, and occasionally pressed towards one side\r\nby a protuberance on the opposite one. Skin, when clear, of a bright\r\nyellow, but mostly covered with a grey netted russet, rendering the\r\nskin scabrous. Flesh, greenish-yellow, firm, crisp, and tender. Juice,\r\nsaccharine, highly aromatic, and of a most excellent flavor.\r\n\r\nA dessert apple, in use from November to February.\r\n\r\nThis neat and very valuable little apple, was introduced to notice\r\nabout the beginning of the present century, by the late Mr. Andrew\r\nSiely, of Norwich, who had it growing in his garden on the Castle\r\nDitches, and being a favorite with him he always called it the “Pride\r\nof the Ditches.” The tree is a weak grower and somewhat tender. It\r\nis therefore advisable to graft it on the doucin stock, and train it\r\neither as a dwarf or as an espalier in a garden.--_Lindley._\r\n\r\n\r\n332. SIR WILLIAM GIBBON’S.--Hort.\r\n\r\nFruit, very large, three inches and three quarters wide, and three\r\ninches high; calville-shaped, being roundish-oblate, with several\r\nprominent angles, which extend from the base to the apex, where they\r\nterminate in five or six large unequal knobs. Skin, deep yellow, tinged\r\nwith green, and strewed with minute russety dots on the shaded side;\r\nbut deep crimson, streaked with dark red, on the side exposed to the\r\nsun. Eye, open, with short ragged segments, set in a deep, wide, and\r\nirregular basin. Stalk, very short, imbedded in a deep and angular\r\ncavity, which is lined with russet. Flesh, yellowish-white, crisp,\r\njuicy, and slightly acid, with a pleasant vinous flavor.\r\n\r\nA very showy and excellent culinary apple, in use from November to\r\nJanuary.\r\n\r\n\r\n333. SLEEPING BEAUTY.--H.\r\n\r\n SYNONYMES.--Winter Sleeping Beauty. Sleeper.\r\n\r\nFruit, medium sized; roundish, and somewhat flattened, slightly angular\r\non the sides, and undulating round the eye; in some specimens there\r\nis an inclination to an ovate, or conical shape, in which case the\r\napex is narrow and even. Skin, pale straw-colored, smooth and shining,\r\noccasionally washed on one side with delicate lively red, very thinly\r\nsprinkled with minute russety dots. Eye, large, somewhat resembling\r\nthat of Trumpington, with broad, flat, and incurved segments, which\r\ndove-tail, as it were, to each other, and set in a shallow, uneven, and\r\nplaited basin. Stalk, from a quarter to half-an-inch long, slightly\r\nfleshy, inserted in a narrow, round, and rather shallow cavity, which\r\nis tinged with green, and lined with delicate pale brown russet. Flesh,\r\nyellowish-white, crisp, tender, and juicy, with a fine poignant and\r\nagreeably acid flavor.\r\n\r\nA most excellent, and very valuable apple for all culinary purposes;\r\nand particularly for sauce. It is in use from November till the end of\r\nFebruary.\r\n\r\nThe tree is a most excellent bearer, and succeeds well in almost every\r\nsituation.\r\n\r\nThis excellent apple bears such a close resemblance to Dumelow’s\r\nSeedling, that at first sight it may be taken for that variety; from\r\nwhich however, it is perfectly distinct, and may be distinguished\r\nby the want of the characteristic russet dots on the fruit, and the\r\nspots on the young wood of the tree. It is extensively cultivated in\r\nLincolnshire, for the supply of the Boston markets.\r\n\r\n\r\n334. SMALL STALK.--H.\r\n\r\nFruit, medium sized, two inches and a half wide, and two inches high;\r\nroundish, slightly angular on the sides, and knobbed at the apex. Skin,\r\ndull greenish-yellow, with a tinge of orange on the side next the sun,\r\nand thickly covered with redish brown dots. Eye, small, and closed\r\nwith long flat segments, and placed in an angular basin. Stalk, about\r\nan inch long, slender, inserted in a wide and rather shallow cavity.\r\nFlesh, white, tender, juicy, and well flavored.\r\n\r\nA good apple for ordinary purposes, much grown about Lancaster. It is\r\nin use during September and October.\r\n\r\n\r\n335. SOMERSET LASTING.--Hort.\r\n\r\n IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 2, n. 782.\r\n\r\n FIGURE--Ron. Pyr.

Mal. pl. ii. f. 4.\r\n\r\nFruit, rather above medium size, two inches and three quarters broad,\r\nand the same in height; roundish, but narrowing a little towards the\r\neye, and slightly ribbed on the sides. Skin, covered with a delicate\r\nwhite bloom, which when rubbed off exhibits a smooth, shining, and\r\nvarnished rich deep chestnut, almost approaching to black, on the side\r\nexposed to the sun; but on the shaded side, it is of a light orange\r\nred, and where very much shaded quite yellow, the whole strewed with\r\nminute dots. Eye, small, half open, with long, broad, and reflexed\r\nsegments, placed in a round and slightly angular basin. Stalk,\r\nhalf-an-inch long, inserted in a deep funnel-shaped cavity. Flesh, red,\r\nas if sopped in wine, tender, sweet, juicy, and pleasantly flavored.\r\n\r\nA very ancient English culinary and cider apple; but perhaps more\r\nsingular than useful. It is in use from October to February.\r\n\r\nThe tree is vigorous and spreading, very hardy, an excellent bearer,\r\nand not subject to canker.\r\n\r\n\r\n337. SPICE APPLE.--Diel.\r\n\r\n IDENTIFICATION--Diel Kernobst. x. 34.\r\n\r\nFruit, medium sized, two inches and a half broad, and two and a quarter\r\nhigh; roundish, but narrowing towards the eye.

Skin, deep yellow, with an orange tinge on the side exposed to\r\nthe sun, and strewed with large stelloid russety specks. Eye, partially\r\nopen, with long, broad, and erect segments, set in a narrow and shallow\r\nbasin. Stalk, short and stout, inserted in a small narrow cavity.\r\nFlesh, tender, juicy, sweet, and pleasantly flavored.\r\n\r\nAn apple of second-rate quality, in use from November to Christmas.\r\n\r\nThis is the Spitzemberg of the German nurseries.\r\n\r\n\r\n339.

Eye, closed, with broad segments, and set in a narrow,\r\nplaited basin. Stalk, short, inserted in a rather deep cavity. Flesh,\r\ngreenish-yellow, tender, juicy, sugary, brisk, and slightly perfumed.\r\n\r\nA first-rate culinary apple. It may be used for tarts, as soon as\r\nthe fruit are the size of a walnut, and continues in use up to the\r\nbeginning of October. It received the name of Springrove Codlin, from\r\nbeing first introduced by Sir Joseph Banks, Bart., who resided at\r\nSpringrove, near Hounslow, Middlesex.\r\n\r\n\r\n340. SQUIRE’S GREENING.--H.\r\n\r\nFruit, about medium size; roundish and flattened, irregular in its\r\noutline, having sometimes very prominent, unequal, and obtuse angles,\r\non the sides, which terminate in undulations round the eye. Skin, of a\r\nfine clear grass-green color, which it retains till the spring, covered\r\nwith dull brownish-red where exposed to the sun, thinly strewed all\r\nover with minute dots. Eye, small and closed, inserted in a narrow,\r\nirregular, and plaited basin. Stalk, short and slender, inserted in a\r\nround, narrow, and deep cavity, which is lined with rough scaly russet.\r\nFlesh, yellowish-white, firm and crisp, with a brisk, somewhat sugary\r\nand pleasant flavor.\r\n\r\nA good culinary apple, and useful also as a dessert variety. It is in\r\nuse from Christmas till April or May.\r\n\r\nThis variety was raised on the property of Mrs. Squires, of Nigtoft,\r\nnear Sleaford.\r\n\r\n\r\n341.

Stalk, short.\r\nSkin, yellow, a little reticulated with a slight greyish russet, and a\r\nfew small specks intermixed.\r\n\r\nSpecific gravity of the juice, 1074.\r\n\r\nAs a cider apple, this appears to possess great merit, combining\r\na slight degree of astringency, with much sweetness. It ripens in\r\nOctober, and is also a good culinary apple during its season. It was\r\nraised from seed by Daniel Stead, Esq., Brierly, near Leominster,\r\nHerefordshire.--_Knight & Lindley._\r\n\r\n\r\n342. STIRZAKER’S EARLY SQUARE.--H.\r\n\r\nFruit, below medium size; roundish, with prominent ribs which run into\r\nthe eye, forming sharp ridges at the crown. Skin, of an uniform pale\r\nyellow, freckled and mottled, with very thin dingy brown russet on the\r\nshaded side, and, completely covered with the same on the side next\r\nthe sun. Eye, small, half open, set in an irregular and angular basin.\r\nStalk, very short, imbedded in a deep cavity. Flesh, white, tender,\r\njuicy, and pleasantly flavored.\r\n\r\nAn early apple, grown in the neighbourhood of Lancaster. It is ripe in\r\nAugust, and continues in use during September.\r\n\r\n\r\n343. STRIPED BEEFING.--H.\r\n\r\n SYNONYMES.--Striped Beaufin. Lind. Guide, 57.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFruit, of the largest size; beautiful and handsome, roundish, and\r\nsomewhat depressed. Skin, bright lively green, almost entirely covered\r\nwith broken streaks, and patches of fine deep red, and thickly strewed\r\nwith russety dots; in some specimens the color extends almost entirely\r\nround the fruit. Eye, like that of the Blenheim Pippin, large and\r\nopen, with short erect ragged segments, set in a deep, irregular, and\r\nangular basin. Flesh, yellowish, firm, crisp, juicy, and pleasantly\r\nacid.\r\n\r\nOne of the handsomest and best culinary apples in cultivation; for\r\nbaking it is unrivalled. It is in use from October till May.\r\n\r\nThe tree is very hardy, and an excellent bearer.\r\n\r\nThis noble apple was introduced by Mr. George Lindley, who found it\r\ngrowing in 1794, in the garden of William Crowe, Esq., at Lakenham\r\nnear Norwich. He measured a specimen of the fruit, and found it twelve\r\ninches and a half in circumference, and weighing twelve ounces and\r\na half, avoirdupoise. It does not seem ever to have been in general\r\ncultivation, as it is not mentioned in any of the nursery catalogues;\r\nnor is it enumerated in that of the London Horticultural Society.\r\nThrough the kindness of George Jefferies, Esq., of Marlborough Terrace,\r\nKensington, who procured it from his residence in Norfolk, I had the\r\ngood fortune in 1847, to obtain grafts, which when propagated, I\r\ndistributed through several of the principal nurseries of the country,\r\nand by this means I trust, it will become more generally known, and\r\nuniversally cultivated.\r\n\r\n\r\n344.

Eye, small, and closed,\r\nset in a shallow, irregular, and angular basin. Stalk, three quarters\r\nof an inch long, straight, inserted in a round, even, and russety\r\ncavity. Flesh, yellow, firm, crisp, very juicy, with a brisk and rich\r\nsugary flavor.\r\n\r\nThis is perhaps the most valuable dessert apple of its season, it is\r\nof first-rate excellence; and exceedingly desirable both on account\r\nof its delicious flavor, and arriving at perfection, at a period when\r\nthe other favorite varieties are past. It is not fit for use till the\r\nRibston Pippin is nearly gone, and continues long after the Nonpariel.\r\nThe period of its perfection may be fixed from February to June.\r\n\r\nThe Sturmer Pippin, was raised by Mr. Dillistone, a nurseryman at\r\nSturmer, near Haverhill, in Suffolk, and was obtained by impregnating\r\nthe Ribston Pippin, with the pollen of the Nonpareil.\r\n\r\nThe tree is hardy and an excellent bearer, and attains about the middle\r\nsize.\r\n\r\n\r\n346. SUGAR AND BRANDY.--H.\r\n\r\nFruit, medium sized, two inches and three quarters broad at the bulge,\r\nand the same in height; conical, and angular, with a very prominent rib\r\non one side, forming a high ridge at the apex, terminated at the apex,\r\nby a number of knobs which are the continuations of the costal angles.\r\nSkin, deep dull yellow, freckled with pale red on the shaded side,\r\nthe remaining portion entirely covered with bright orange-red. Eye,\r\nsmall and closed, set in a deep and furrowed basin. Stalk, very short,\r\ninserted in a round and shallow cavity, which is lined with rough\r\nrusset. Flesh, deep yellow, spongy, juicy, very sweet, so much so, as\r\nto be sickly.\r\n\r\nAn apple grown about Lancashire, in use during the end of August and\r\nSeptember.\r\n\r\n\r\n347.

Eye, small, with a closed calyx, in a rather narrow basin,\r\nsurrounded by some angular plaits. Stalk, short, slender, deeply\r\ninserted, not protruding beyond the base. Skin, dull yellowish-green,\r\ntinged on the sunny side, with pale dull brown. Flesh, greenish-white,\r\nnot crisp. Juice, sub-acid, with a pretty good flavor.\r\n\r\nA culinary apple in use in October and November. This is an useful\r\nNorfolk apple, and known in the markets by the above name. The trees\r\nare rather small growers, but great bearers.--_Lindley._\r\n\r\nI have never seen the Summer Broad-End, and have therefore here\r\nintroduced the description of Mr. Lindley, for the benefit of those\r\nunder whose observation it may fall.\r\n\r\n\r\n349.

Eye, open, set in a wide, shallow, and slightly\r\nplaited basin. Stalk, thick, a quarter of an inch long, completely\r\nimbedded in a moderately deep cavity, which is lined with russet.\r\nFlesh, yellowish, firm, very juicy, with a rich, vinous, and sugary\r\nflavor.\r\n\r\nThis is one of the most delicious summer apples, and ought to form one\r\nof every collection, however small. It is ripe in the end of August,\r\nand keeps about a fortnight.\r\n\r\nThe tree is a small grower, and attains about the third size. It is an\r\nearly and abundant bearer, and succeeds well when grafted on the doucin\r\nor paradise stock. When grown on the pomme paradis of the French, it\r\nforms a beautiful little tree, which can be successfully cultivated in\r\npots.\r\n\r\n\r\n350.

Flesh, deep yellow, firm, crisp, juicy,\r\nrichly, and highly perfumed.\r\n\r\nAn excellent apple, long cultivated, and generally regarded as one\r\nof the popular varieties of this country, it is suitable either for\r\nculinary purposes, or the dessert, and is in use during September and\r\nOctober.\r\n\r\nThe tree is a good grower, and healthy; of an upright habit of growth,\r\nand forms a fine standard tree of the largest size. It succeeds well\r\ngrafted on the paradise stock, when it forms handsome espaliers, and\r\nopen dwarfs.\r\n\r\nThis is what in many nurseries is cultivated as the _Royal Pearmain_,\r\nbut erroneously. It is one of the oldest English varieties, being\r\nmentioned by Parkinson, in 1629.\r\n\r\n\r\n351.

Eye, very small, half open, with short, flat,\r\novate segments, and set in a small, narrow, and rather shallow basin.\r\nStalk, three quarters of an inch long, inserted in a rather shallow and\r\nrussety cavity. Flesh, greenish-white, firm, crisp, sugary, and with a\r\nvery powerful yet pleasant sub-acid flavor.\r\n\r\nAn excellent culinary apple admirably adapted for sauce; but too acid\r\nfor the dessert. It is in use from January to April.\r\n\r\nThe tree is a vigorous grower, and an excellent bearer.\r\n\r\nThis variety was raised in 1807, by Thomas Netherton Parker, Esq.,\r\nof Sweeny, in Shropshire, and twenty specimens of the fruit, were\r\nexhibited at the London Horticultural Society, in 1820, the aggregate\r\nweight of which, was seven pounds thirteen ounces.\r\n\r\n\r\n354.

Flesh,\r\nyellowish-white, tinged with red under the skin, which is filled with\r\nred juice, leaving a stain on the knife with which it is cut; firm,\r\njuicy, and sugary, with a vinous and pleasant flavor.\r\n\r\nA culinary apple of good, but not first-rate quality; in use from\r\nOctober to March.\r\n\r\nDuhamel, and following him, almost all the French writers on pomology,\r\nattribute the name of this apple to the perfume of violets being found\r\nin the flavor of the fruit; a peculiarity I could never detect. It\r\nis more probable it originated from the fruit being covered with a\r\nbeautiful blue violet bloom, a characteristic which was observed by\r\nRivinius and Moulin, a hundred and fifty years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n371. WADHURST PIPPIN.--Hort.\r\n\r\n IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3, p. 44.\r\n\r\nFruit, above medium size, sometimes very large, but generally averaging\r\nthree inches wide, and two inches and three quarters high; conical, or\r\npearmain-shaped, and angular on the sides. Skin, yellow, tinged with\r\ngreen on the shaded side; and more or less mottled with brownish-red,\r\non the side next the sun, and strewed with minute grey dots. Eye,\r\nclosed, set in a wide, deep, and angular basin. Stalk, a quarter of an\r\ninch long, stout, placed in a shallow cavity. Flesh, yellowish, crisp,\r\njuicy, and briskly flavored.\r\n\r\nA culinary apple of excellent quality; in use from October to February.\r\nIt originated at Wadhurst in Sussex.\r\n\r\n\r\n372.

Skin, pale yellow, assuming a deeper tinge as\r\nit attains maturity, with a faint blush of red where exposed to the\r\nsun, and strewed all over with minute russety dots. Eye, large and\r\nopen, set in a shallow and even basin. Stalk, short, deeply inserted,\r\nand surrounded with rough russet. Flesh, yellowish, tender, juicy,\r\nsweet, and pleasantly flavored, and when cooked assumes a clear pale\r\namber.\r\n\r\nA culinary apple of first-rate quality; in use from September to\r\nChristmas.\r\n\r\nThis apple was raised about the year 1810, by Mr. John Barnard, of\r\nWaltham Abbey, in Essex, and was introduced by him at a meeting of the\r\nLondon Horticultural Society, in 1821.\r\n\r\n\r\n373. WANSTALL.--H.\r\n\r\n SYNONYME.--Green-street Apple.\r\n\r\nFruit, medium sized, two inches and a half wide, and two inches and\r\na quarter high; roundish, but narrowing a little towards the eye,\r\nwith five prominent angles on the sides, which terminate in ridges\r\nround the apex, rendering the shape distinctly five-sided. Skin, deep\r\ngolden-yellow on the shaded side; but red, which is striped and mottled\r\nwith darker red, on the side next the sun; marked with patches and\r\nveins of thin grey russet, and strewed all over with russety dots. Eye,\r\nhalf open, with broad, flat segments, set in an angular and plaited\r\nbasin. Stalk, half-an-inch long, deeply inserted in a round cavity.\r\nFlesh, yellow, firm, crisp, juicy, rich, sugary, and highly flavored.\r\n\r\nA dessert apple of the very first quality; equal in flavor to the\r\nRibston Pippin, and will keep till May and June.\r\n\r\nThis variety was raised at Green-street, near Sittingbourne, in Kent,\r\nby a tailor of the name of Wanstall, about 40 years ago.\r\n\r\n\r\n374. WARNER’S KING.--M.\r\n\r\n IDENTIFICATION AND FIGURE.--Maund. Fruit, pl. 59.\r\n\r\nFruit, very large, four inches wide, and three inches and a half high;\r\novate. Skin, of an uniform clear deep yellow, strewed with russety\r\ndots and patches of pale brown russet. Eye, small and closed, with\r\nlong acuminate segments, and set in a narrow, deep, and slightly\r\nangular basin. Stalk, about half-an-inch long, deeply inserted in a\r\nround, funnel-shaped cavity, which is lined with thin yellowish-brown\r\nrusset. Flesh, white, tender, crisp, and juicy, with a fine, brisk, and\r\nsub-acid flavor.\r\n\r\nA culinary apple of first-rate quality; in use from November to March.\r\n\r\nThe tree is a free and vigorous grower, and a good bearer; very hardy,\r\nand not subject to disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n375. WATSON’S DUMPLING.--Hort.\r\n\r\n IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Soc. Cat. ed. 3, n. 856. Down. Fr. Amer. 142.\r\n\r\nFruit, large; roundish, and regularly formed.

Skin,\r\nlight green, striped and mottled with light red on the side next the\r\nsun; and strewed all over with greyish-white dots, on the exposed,\r\nand brown dots on the shaded side. Eye, open, set in a plaited basin.\r\nStalk, a quarter of an inch long, inserted in a shallow cavity. Flesh,\r\ngreenish-white, soft, tender, juicy, and briskly acid.\r\n\r\nA good second-rate apple for the dessert: in use from November to\r\nApril, and keeps well without shrivelling.\r\n\r\n\r\n377.

Skin, entirely covered with pale yellowish-grey russet;\r\nwith redish-brown where exposed to the sun, strewed with russety\r\nfreckles. Eye, small and closed, with short segments, set in a wide,\r\nand undulated basin. Stalk, from a quarter to half-an-inch long,\r\ninserted in a round, narrow, and deep cavity. Flesh, greenish-white,\r\nfirm, juicy, brisk, and sugary, with a rich, vinous, and aromatic\r\nflavor.\r\n\r\nA valuable, and highly flavored dessert apple of the first quality;\r\nit is in use from November to April; and as Mr. Lindley says, when\r\nripened, and begins to shrivel, it is one of the best russets of its\r\nseason.\r\n\r\nThe tree is a free grower, healthy, and hardy, but does not attain\r\nabove the middle size. It is generally a good bearer, and succeeds well\r\nin almost any soil, provided it be not too moist.\r\n\r\nThis apple was raised by James Wheeler, the founder of the Gloucester\r\nnursery, now in the occupation of his grandson, Mr. J. Cheslin Wheeler.\r\nHe was an intelligent and assiduous man in his profession, and\r\npublished in 1763, “The Botanist’s and Gardener’s New Dictionary.” He\r\ndied about the beginning of the present century, having attained over\r\nninety years of age.\r\n\r\n\r\n378. WHEELER’S EXTREME.--Forsyth.\r\n\r\n IDENTIFICATION.--Fors. Treat. 129.\r\n\r\nFruit, small, nearly two inches wide, and one inch and a quarter high;\r\noblate, much resembling the Api in shape. Skin, pale greenish-yellow,\r\nconsiderably marked with russet, particularly round the eye; and\r\ncovered with fine clear red, which is mottled with deeper red, on the\r\nside next the sun. Eye, small and closed, set in a shallow basin.\r\nStalk, very short, inserted in a small, shallow cavity. Flesh,\r\nyellowish-white, crisp, tender, sweet, and delicately perfumed.\r\n\r\nA pretty little dessert apple, but not of first-rate quality; it is in\r\nuse from November to February.\r\n\r\nThis, as well as the preceding, was raised by James Wheeler, of\r\nGloucester. The original tree is still existing in the nursery of\r\nhis grandson, to whom I am much indebted for several pomological\r\nfavors. The name of “Extreme,” is supposed to have been applied to\r\nthis variety, from the circumstance of producing its fruit on the\r\nextremities of the last year’s shoots.\r\n\r\n\r\n379.

Skin, smooth, pale yellow, with a few\r\nfaint streaks of red next the sun, and covered with a delicate white\r\nbloom. Eye, closed, set in a narrow and plaited basin. Stalk, thick and\r\nshort, inserted in a small and very shallow cavity. Flesh, pure white,\r\nsemi-transparent, with somewhat gelatinous-like blotches, tender,\r\njuicy, with a pleasant and refreshing flavor.\r\n\r\nA dessert apple but not of first-rate quality; ripe in August, and the\r\nearly part of September.\r\n\r\nThe tree is a strong and vigorous grower, and an excellent bearer.\r\n\r\nThe Transparent Apple of Rogers, and the Muscovy Apple of Mortimer,\r\ncannot be identical with this variety, for they are described by\r\nboth as winter apples; may they not be the _Russischer Glasapfel, or\r\nAstracanischer Winterapfel_ of Diel?\r\n\r\nRespecting this apple, a correspondent in the Gardener’s Chronicle, for\r\n1845, has the following remark, “When at Reval many years ago, I made\r\nparticular inquiries as to the mode of cultivation of the Transparent\r\nApple; I learned that the soil of the apple orchards there, is almost a\r\npure sand, but that it is customary to add to it so much stable manure,\r\nthat half the bulk of ground may be said to consist of manure. The\r\nfriend with whom I was staying, had some of these apples at dessert;\r\nthey were transparent, not in blotches, but throughout, so that held\r\nto the light, the pips may be seen from every part; these apples\r\nwere juicy as a peach, about the size of a large one, and of a very\r\nagreeable flavor and texture.”\r\n\r\n\r\n380.

Eye, open, set in a shallow basin. Stalk, an inch long, fleshy\r\nat the insertion; and inserted in an even, round, cavity. Flesh,\r\nyellowish, tender, crisp, juicy, sugary, and pleasantly flavored.\r\n\r\nA second-rate, but beautiful and handsome dessert apple; in perfection\r\nthe beginning of October, but towards the end of the month, becomes dry\r\nand mealy. It is, I believe, a Scotch apple, and much grown in some\r\ndistricts, particularly in Clydesdale, where it is known by the name of\r\n_Egg Apple_, and where the fruit lasts longer, than when grown in the\r\nwarmer climate of the South.\r\n\r\nThe Lady’s Finger of Dittrich, vol. i. p. 505, is a flat apple of a\r\nCalville shape, and must be incorrect.\r\n\r\n\r\n381. WHITE VIRGIN.--H.\r\n\r\n SYNONYME.--Scotch Virgin.\r\n\r\nFruit, medium sized, two inches and three quarters wide, and two inches\r\nhigh; oblate. Skin, smooth and shining, pale yellow, on the shaded\r\nsize; but thin orange red, streaked with deep red, on the side next the\r\nsun, and strewed with dark dots and a few veins of russet.

WHITE WESTLING.--H.\r\n\r\nFruit, rather below medium size, two inches and a half broad at the\r\nmiddle, and two inches and a half high; roundish, inclining to oval,\r\ntowards the eye; angular on the sides, and ribbed round the apex. Skin,\r\nyellow, tinged with green, and strewed with redish-brown dots on the\r\nshaded side; but deep yellow, with large dark-crimson spots, on the\r\nside next the sun, and covered with russet over the base. Eye, small\r\nand closed, set in a narrow and angular basin. Stalk, half-an-inch\r\nlong, very slender, inserted in a deep, narrow, and russety cavity.\r\nFlesh, white, tender, sweet, and briskly flavored.\r\n\r\nAn apple of hardly second-rate quality, grown about the north-eastern\r\nparts of Sussex; it is in use from October to Christmas.\r\n\r\n\r\n383. WHITE WINE.--H.\r\n\r\nFruit, about medium size, two inches and a half broad in the middle,\r\nand two inches and a half high; narrowing towards the apex, conical,\r\nslightly angular on the sides, and ribbed round the eye. Skin,\r\ngreenish-yellow, strewed with russety dots on the shaded side; but\r\ndeep yellow, reticulated with fine russet, and dotted with small\r\nrussety specks on the side exposed to the sun, and with a ray of fine\r\nlilac-purple on the base encircling the stalk. Eye, open, with long\r\nacute segments, set in a deep and ribbed basin. Stalk, five-eights of\r\nan inch long, downy, thick and fleshy, inserted in a round cavity,\r\nwhich is lined with delicate russet. Flesh, white, firm, crisp, and\r\npleasantly acid.\r\n\r\nA culinary apple much grown in the Tweedside orchards, where it is\r\nknown by the name of the _Wine Apple_; it is in use from October to\r\nChristmas.\r\n\r\n\r\n384.

Guide, 84.\r\n\r\nFruit, below medium size, two inches and a quarter wide at the base,\r\nand the same in height, but narrowing towards the apex; conical, and\r\nobtusely angled on the sides. Skin, pale greenish-yellow in the shade;\r\nbut with a beautiful red cheek next the sun, and very sparingly strewed\r\nwith a few minute dots. Eye, closed, set in a narrow and shallow basin.\r\nStalk, about half-an-inch long, inserted in a wide, round, and even\r\ncavity. Flesh, white, tinged with green, tender, juicy, sub-acid, and\r\nslightly sweet.\r\n\r\nA dessert apple of second-rate quality; in use from November to April.\r\n\r\n\r\n385.

Mal. pl. ii. f. 3.\r\n\r\nFruit, below medium size, two inches and a quarter wide at the middle,\r\nand an inch and three quarters high; oblate, handsome, and regularly\r\nformed. Skin, smooth, shining, and glossy, almost entirely covered\r\nwith fine bright crimson, which is marked with broken streaks of\r\ndarker crimson; but on any portion which is shaded, it is of a fine\r\nclear yellow, a little streaked with pale crimson. Eye, scarcely at\r\nall depressed, large, half open, with broad, flat segments, which\r\nfrequently appear as if rent from each other by an over-swelling of the\r\nfruit; and set in a very shallow basin, which is often very russety,\r\nand deeply and coarsely cracked. Stalk, a quarter of an inch long,\r\ninserted in a wide cavity. Flesh, yellowish-white, firm, crisp, and\r\nvery juicy, with a brisk, refreshing, and pleasant flavor.\r\n\r\nA beautiful little summer dessert apple, of first-rate quality; ripe in\r\nAugust. In the south it is but little known, but in Scotland it is to\r\nbe met with in almost every garden and orchard.\r\n\r\nIn all probability the word Thorle is a corruption of Whorle, which is\r\nno doubt the correct name of this apple. The name is supposed to be\r\nderived from its resemblance to the _whorle_, which was the propelling\r\npower, or rather impetus of the spindle, when the distaff and spindle\r\nwas so much in use.\r\n\r\n\r\n386. WICKHAM’S PEARMAIN.--H.\r\n\r\n SYNONYMES.--Wick Pearmain, _Hort. Soc.

Stalk, half-an-inch long, fleshy,\r\ninserted without any depression. Flesh, greenish-yellow, tender, crisp,\r\njuicy, sugary, and highly flavored.\r\n\r\nAn excellent dessert apple; in use from October to December. It was\r\nraised by a Mr. Wickham, of Wick, near Winchester. In the catalogue of\r\nthe London Horticultural Society, it is called “Wick Pearmain,” but as\r\nthe name I have adopted is that by which it is best known in Hampshire,\r\nI prefer retaining it.\r\n\r\n\r\n387. WINTER CODLIN.--Hort.\r\n\r\n IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Soc.

Skin, smooth\r\nand shining, of a dark lively green, strewed with minute russety dots;\r\nand with a blush of dull red where exposed to the sun. Eye, small\r\nand closed, set in a shallow and plaited basin. Stalk, half-an-inch\r\nlong, inserted in a round cavity, which is lined with russet.

Dry sand is a good article to preserve it in.\r\n\r\nThe tree is very hardy, a free and good grower, and an abundant bearer.\r\n\r\nI have not adopted here, the nomenclature of the Horticultural\r\nSociety’s Catalogue, for two reasons. First, because Winter Greening\r\nis the previous name, and, so far as I can find, the original one. It\r\nis also very applicable, and not subject to the same objection which\r\nMr. Lindley has to French Crab. Second, because there is already\r\nin the Horticultural Society’s Catalogue, the “White Easter”--the\r\n“Paasch Appel,” of Knoop--and the two names being so similar, may\r\ntend to confusion, a result of already too frequent occurrence, and\r\nmost desirable to be avoided.

Stalk, three quarters of an inch long, slender,\r\ninserted in a deep and narrow cavity, which is lined with russet.\r\nFlesh, greenish-white, firm, crisp, brisk, and pleasantly flavored.\r\n\r\nA first-rate culinary apple, bearing a considerable resemblance to the\r\nLondon Pippin, but does not change to yellow color by keeping as that\r\nvariety does. It is in use from January to May.\r\n\r\nThis variety is, strictly speaking, a Norfolk apple, where it is much\r\ngrown for the local markets. It was first made public by Mr. George\r\nLindley, who introduced it to the notice of the London Horticultural\r\nSociety. In the “Guide to the Orchard,” it is stated that the Aphis\r\nLanigera or “Meally Bug,” so destructive to most of our old orchard\r\ntrees, seems to be set at defiance by the Majetin. “An old tree now\r\ngrowing in a garden belonging to Mr. William Youngman, of Norwich,\r\nwhich had been grafted about three feet high in the stem, has been for\r\nmany years attacked by this insect below the grafted part, but never\r\nabove it; the limbs and branches being to this day perfectly free,\r\nalthough all the other trees in the same garden have been infested more\r\nor less with it.”\r\n\r\nThe tree is a most abundant bearer.\r\n\r\n\r\n392.

Skin, smooth and shining, at first of a greenish-yellow, marked\r\nwith faint streaks of dull red on the shaded side, and entirely covered\r\nwith deep red on the side next the sun; but changes by keeping to fine\r\ndeep yellow, streaked with flesh color on the shaded side; but of a\r\nbeautiful, clear, deep red or crimson, on the side next the sun, and\r\nstrewed all over with small russety dots. Eye, large and open, with\r\nshort segments, set in a pretty deep, and prominently plaited basin.\r\nStalk, very short, not exceeding a quarter of an inch long, inserted\r\nin a deep, funnel-shaped cavity, which is lined with russet. Flesh,\r\nyellowish, firm, crisp, juicy, and sugary, with a brisk, poignant, and\r\nvery pleasant flavor.\r\n\r\nA highly esteemed old English apple, suitable principally for culinary\r\npurposes, but also valuable for the dessert; it is in use from December\r\nto the end of April.\r\n\r\nThe tree attains about the middle size, is a free and healthy grower,\r\nand an excellent bearer.\r\n\r\nThis is, I believe, the oldest existing English apple on record.\r\nIt is noticed as being cultivated in Norfolk, as early as the year\r\n1200,--what evidence against Mr. Knight’s theory! In Blomefield’s\r\nHistory of Norfolk, there is mention of a tenure in that county by\r\npetty serjeanty, and the payment of two hundred pearmains, and four\r\nhogsheads of cider of pearmains into the Exchequer, at the feast of St.\r\nMichael, yearly. It is the original of all the Pearmains, a name now\r\napplied to a great variety of apples. Much doubt has existed as to the\r\norigin of this word, and in a communication to the Gardener’s Chronicle\r\nfor 1848, I there stated what I conceived to be its meaning. The early\r\nforms in which it was written, will be seen from the synonymes above,\r\nthey were Pearemaine and Peare-maine. In some early historical works\r\nof the same period, I have seen Charlemagne written _Charlemaine_, the\r\nlast portion of the word having the same termination as _Pearemaine_.\r\nNow, Charlemagne being derived from _Carolus magnus_ there is every\r\nprobability that Pearemaine is derived from _Pyrus magnus_. The\r\nsignification therefore of Pearmain is the _Great Pear Apple_, in\r\nallusion no doubt, to the varieties known by that name, bearing a\r\nresemblance to the form of a pear.\r\n\r\n\r\n393.

Skin,\r\npale-green, almost entirely covered with red, which is striped and\r\nmottled with deeper red, and marked on the shaded side with a thin coat\r\nof russet. Eye, small, and closed, set in a narrow and angular cavity.\r\nStalk, about half-an-inch long and slender, deeply inserted in a narrow\r\nand angular cavity. Flesh, greenish-yellow, tender, soft, not very\r\njuicy, sugary, rich, and perfumed.\r\n\r\nA good old English apple, suitable either for the dessert or culinary\r\npurposes; it is in use from November to May.\r\n\r\nThe Winter Quoining, is a very old English apple. I have here adopted\r\nan orthography, different from that usually employed, because I\r\nconceive it to be the most correct. The name is derived from the word\r\nCoin or Quoin, the corner stones of a building, because of the angles\r\nor corners on the sides of the fruit. Thus Rea in his Pomona says,\r\nwhen speaking of this apple, “it succeeds incomparably on the paradise\r\napple, as the Colviele, (Calville) and all other sorts of Queenings\r\ndo,” regarding the Calville also as a Queening from the angularity of\r\nits shape.\r\n\r\n\r\n394.

It is said that\r\nthe name of this apple, is derived from an imagined resemblance in the\r\nform of the fruit, and fruit-stalk, in some instances, to the head\r\nand beak of a woodcock; but Mr. Knight thinks it probable that it was\r\nraised by a person of that name.\r\n\r\n\r\n395.

A. Knight, Esq., and first\r\nbrought into notice in 1811. As a culinary apple it is not to be\r\nsurpassed; and even in the dessert, when well ripened, Mr. Knight\r\nconsidered it closely resembled the Newtown Pippin. The tree is hardy,\r\nhealthy, a free and abundant bearer. It has been found to succeed in\r\nevery latitude of these kingdoms. Even in Rosshire, the late Sir. G.\r\nS. McKenzie, found it to succeed well as an espalier. It ought to be\r\ncultivated in every garden, however small.\r\n\r\n\r\n397. WYKEN PIPPIN.--Hort.\r\n\r\n IDENTIFICATION.--Hort. Soc.

They are either recorded in other works on pomology, or\r\nhave been communicated to me by correspondents. The most of these\r\nhave only a local reputation, and do not possess sufficient merit to\r\nmake them attractive out of their own districts. A great number are\r\ncontinental varieties, which have chiefly been introduced through the\r\ninstrumentality of the London Horticultural Society, in whose garden\r\nthey are only to be found; and many of these are worthy of being more\r\ngenerally known. There are also several varieties which have come under\r\nmy notice, since the preceding part of this work was published; but of\r\nthe greater part enumerated, I have had no opportunity of seeing the\r\nfruit; the descriptions, therefore, are either from the works in which\r\nthey are recorded, or the correspondents with whom I have communicated;\r\nmy object in supplying these additional varieties, being to furnish a\r\ncomplete record of all that are known to exist in Great Britain so far\r\nas that can be ascertained.\r\n\r\n\r\n402.
