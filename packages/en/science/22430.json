ARTHUR THOMSON\r\n\r\n_Professor of Natural History in the University of Aberdeen_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn seeking to discover Darwin's relation to his predecessors it is\r\nuseful to distinguish the various services which he rendered to the\r\ntheory of organic evolution.\r\n\r\n(I) As everyone knows, the general idea of the Doctrine of Descent is\r\nthat the plants and animals of the present day are the lineal\r\ndescendants of ancestors on the whole somewhat simpler, that these\r\nagain are descended from yet simpler forms, and so on backwards\r\ntowards the literal \"Protozoa\" and \"Protophyta\" about which we\r\nunfortunately know nothing. Now no one supposes that Darwin originated\r\nthis idea, which in rudiment at least is as old as Aristotle. What\r\nDarwin did was to make it current intellectual coin. He gave it a form\r\nthat commended itself to the scientific and public intelligence of the\r\nday, and he won widespread conviction by showing with consummate skill\r\nthat it was an effective formula to work with, a key which no lock\r\nrefused. In a scholarly, critical, and pre-eminently fair-minded way,\r\nadmitting difficulties and removing them, foreseeing objections and\r\nforestalling them, he showed that the doctrine of descent supplied a\r\nmodal interpretation of how our present-day fauna and flora have come\r\nto be.\r\n\r\n(II) In the second place, Darwin applied the evolution-idea to\r\nparticular problems, such as the descent of man, and showed what a\r\npowerful organon it is, introducing order into masses of uncorrelated\r\nfacts, interpreting enigmas both of structure and function, both\r\nbodily and mental, and, best of all, stimulating and guiding further\r\ninvestigation. But here again it cannot be claimed that Darwin was\r\noriginal. The problem of the descent or ascent of man, and other\r\nparticular cases of evolution, had attracted not a few naturalists\r\nbefore Darwin's day, though no one [except Herbert Spencer in the\r\npsychological domain (1855)] had come near him in precision and\r\nthoroughness of inquiry.\r\n\r\n(III) In the third place, Darwin contributed largely to a knowledge of\r\nthe factors in the evolution-process, especially by his analysis of\r\nwhat occurs in the case of domestic animals and cultivated plants, and\r\nby his elaboration of the theory of Natural Selection which Alfred\r\nRussel Wallace independently stated at the same time, and of which\r\nthere had been a few previous suggestions of a more or less vague\r\ndescription. It was here that Darwin's originality was greatest, for\r\nhe revealed to naturalists the many different forms--often very\r\nsubtle--which natural selection takes, and with the insight of a\r\ndisciplined scientific imagination he realised what a mighty engine of\r\nprogress it has been and is.\r\n\r\n(IV) As an epoch-marking contribution, not only to Ætiology but to\r\nNatural History in the widest sense, we rank the picture which Darwin\r\ngave to the world of the web of life, that is to say, of the\r\ninter-relations and linkages in Nature. For the Biology of the\r\nindividual--if that be not a contradiction in terms--no idea is more\r\nfundamental than that of the correlation of organs, but Darwin's most\r\ncharacteristic contribution was not less fundamental,--it was the idea\r\nof the correlation of organisms. This, again, was not novel; we find\r\nit in the works of naturalists like Christian Conrad Sprengel,\r\nGilbert White, and Alexander von Humboldt, but the realisation of its\r\nfull import was distinctly Darwinian.\r\n\r\n\r\n_As Regards the General Idea of Organic Evolution_\r\n\r\nWhile it is true, as Prof. H. F. Osborn puts it, that \"'Before and\r\nafter Darwin' will always be the _ante et post urbem conditam_ of\r\nbiological history,\" it is also true that the general idea of organic\r\nevolution is very ancient. In his admirable sketch _From the Greeks to\r\nDarwin_,[1] Prof. Osborn has shown that several of the ancient\r\nphilosophers looked upon Nature as a gradual development and as still\r\nin process of change. In the suggestions of Empedocles, to take the\r\nbest instance, there were \"four sparks of truth,--first, that the\r\ndevelopment of life was a gradual process; second, that plants were\r\nevolved before animals; third, that imperfect forms were gradually\r\nreplaced (not succeeded) by perfect forms; fourth, that the natural\r\ncause of the production of perfect forms was the extinction of the\r\nimperfect.\"[2] But the fundamental idea of one stage giving origin to\r\nanother was absent. As the blue Ægean teemed with treasures of beauty\r\nand threw many upon its shores, so did Nature produce like a fertile\r\nartist what had to be rejected as well as what was able to survive,\r\nbut the idea of one species emerging out of another was not yet\r\nconceived.\r\n\r\nAristotle's views of Nature[3] seem to have been more definitely\r\nevolutionist than those of his predecessors, in this sense, at least,\r\nthat he recognised not only an ascending scale, but a genetic series\r\nfrom polyp to man and an age-long movement towards perfection. \"It is\r\ndue to the resistance of matter to form that Nature can only rise by\r\ndegrees from lower to higher types.\" \"Nature produces those things\r\nwhich, being continually moved by a certain principle contained in\r\nthemselves, arrive at a certain end.\"\r\n\r\nTo discern the outcrop of evolution-doctrine in the long interval\r\nbetween Aristotle and Bacon seems to be very difficult, and some of\r\nthe instances that have been cited strike one as forced. Epicurus and\r\nLucretius, often called poets of evolution, both pictured animals as\r\narising directly out of the earth, very much as Milton's lion long\r\nafterwards pawed its way out. Even when we come to Bruno who wrote\r\nthat \"to the sound of the harp of the Universal Apollo (the World\r\nSpirit), the lower organisms are called by stages to higher, and the\r\nlower stages are connected by intermediate forms with the higher,\"\r\nthere is great room, as Prof. Osborn points out,[4] for difference of\r\nopinion as to how far he was an evolutionist in our sense of the term.\r\n\r\nThe awakening of natural science in the sixteenth century brought the\r\npossibility of a concrete evolution theory nearer, and in the early\r\nseventeenth century we find evidences of a new spirit--in the\r\nembryology of Harvey and the classifications of Ray. Besides sober\r\nnaturalists there were speculative dreamers in the sixteenth and\r\nseventeenth centuries who had at least got beyond static formulae,\r\nbut, as Professor Osborn points out,[5] \"it is a very striking fact,\r\nthat the basis of our modern methods of studying the Evolution problem\r\nwas established not by the early naturalists nor by the speculative\r\nwriters, but by the Philosophers.\" He refers to Bacon, Descartes,\r\nLeibnitz, Hume, Kant, Lessing, Herder, and Schelling. \"They alone were\r\nupon the main track of modern thought. It is evident that they were\r\ngroping in the dark for a working theory of the Evolution of life, and\r\nit is remarkable that they clearly perceived from the outset that the\r\npoint to which observation should be directed was not the past but the\r\npresent mutability of species, and further, that this mutability was\r\nsimply the variation of individuals on an extended scale.\"\r\n\r\nBacon seems to have been one of the first to think definitely about\r\nthe mutability of species, and he was far ahead of his age in his\r\nsuggestion of what we now call a Station of Experimental Evolution.\r\nLeibnitz discusses in so many words how the species of animals may be\r\nchanged and how intermediate species may once have linked those that\r\nnow seem discontinuous. \"All natural orders of beings present but a\r\nsingle chain\".... \"All advances by degrees in Nature, and nothing by\r\nleaps.\" Similar evolutionist statements are to be found in the works\r\nof the other \"philosophers,\" to whom Prof. Osborn refers, who were,\r\nindeed, more scientific than the naturalists of their day. It must be\r\nborne in mind that the general idea of organic evolution--that the\r\npresent is the child of the past--is in great part just the idea of\r\nhuman history projected upon the natural world, differentiated by the\r\nqualification that the continuous \"Becoming\" has been wrought out by\r\nforces inherent in the organisms themselves and in their environment.\r\n\r\nA reference to Kant[6] should come in historical order after Buffon,\r\nwith whose writings he was acquainted, but he seems, along with Herder\r\nand Schelling, to be best regarded as the culmination of the\r\nevolutionist philosophers--of those at least who interested themselves\r\nin scientific problems. In a famous passage he speaks of \"the\r\nagreement of so many kinds of animals in a certain common plan of\r\nstructure\" ... an \"analogy of forms\" which \"strengthens the\r\nsupposition that they have an actual blood-relationship, due to\r\nderivation from a common parent.\" He speaks of \"the great Family of\r\ncreatures, for as a Family we must conceive it, if the above-mentioned\r\ncontinuous and connected relationship has a real foundation.\" Prof.\r\nOsborn alludes to the scientific caution which led Kant, biology being\r\nwhat it was, to refuse to entertain the hope \"that a Newton may one\r\nday arise even to make the production of a blade of grass\r\ncomprehensible, according to natural laws ordained by no intention.\"\r\nAs Prof. Haeckel finely observes, Darwin rose up as Kant's Newton.[7]\r\n\r\nThe scientific renaissance brought a wealth of fresh impressions and\r\nsome freedom from the tyranny of tradition, and the twofold stimulus\r\nstirred the speculative activity of a great variety of men from old\r\nClaude Duret of Moulins, of whose weird transformism (1609) Dr. Henry\r\nde Varigny[8] gives us a glimpse, to Lorenz Oken (1779-1851) whose\r\nwritings are such mixtures of sense and nonsense that some regard him\r\nas a far-seeing prophet and others as a fatuous follower of\r\nintellectual will-o'-the-wisps. Similarly, for De Maillet, Maupertuis,\r\nDiderot, Bonnet, and others, we must agree with Professor Osborn that\r\nthey were not actually in the main Evolution movement. Some have been\r\nincluded in the roll of honour on very slender evidence, Robinet for\r\ninstance, whose evolutionism seems to us extremely dubious.[9]\r\n\r\nThe first naturalist to give a broad and concrete expression to the\r\nevolutionist doctrine of descent was Buffon (1707-1788), but it is\r\ninteresting to recall the fact that his contemporary Linnæus\r\n(1707-1778), protagonist of the counter-doctrine of the fixity of\r\nspecies,[10] went the length of admitting (in 1762) that new species\r\nmight arise by inter-crossing. Buffon's position among the pioneers of\r\nthe evolution-doctrine is weakened by his habit of vacillating between\r\nhis own conclusions and the orthodoxy of the Sorbonne, but there is no\r\ndoubt that he had firm grasp of the general idea of \"l'enchaînment des\r\nêtres.\"\r\n\r\nErasmus Darwin (1731-1802), probably influenced by Buffon, was another\r\nfirm evolutionist, and the outline of his argument in the\r\n_Zoonomia_[11] might serve in part at least to-day. \"When we revolve\r\nin our minds the metamorphoses of animals, as from the tadpole to the\r\nfrog; secondly, the changes produced by artificial cultivation, as in\r\nthe breeds of horses, dogs, and sheep; thirdly, the changes produced\r\nby conditions of climate and of season, as in the sheep of warm\r\nclimates being covered with hair instead of wool, and the hares and\r\npartridges of northern climates becoming white in winter: when,\r\nfurther, we observe the changes of structure produced by habit, as\r\nseen especially in men of different occupations; or the changes\r\nproduced by artificial mutilation and prenatal influences, as in the\r\ncrossing of species and production of monsters; fourth, when we\r\nobserve the essential unity of plan in all warm-blooded animals,--we\r\nare led to conclude that they have been alike produced from a similar\r\nliving filament\".... \"From thus meditating upon the minute portion of\r\ntime in which many of the above changes have been produced, would it\r\nbe too bold to imagine, in the great length of time since the earth\r\nbegan to exist, perhaps millions of years before the commencement of\r\nthe history of mankind, that all warm-blooded animals have arisen from\r\none living filament?\"... \"This idea of the gradual generation of all\r\nthings seems to have been as familiar to the ancient philosophers as\r\nto the modern ones, and to have given rise to the beautiful\r\nhieroglyphic figure of the [Greek: prôton ôon], or first great egg,\r\nproduced by night, that is, whose origin is involved in obscurity, and\r\nanimated by [Greek: Erôs], that is, by Divine Love; from whence\r\nproceeded all things which exist.\"\r\n\r\nLamarck (1744-1829) seems to have become an evolutionist\r\nindependently of Erasmus Darwin's influence, though the parallelism\r\nbetween them is striking. He probably owed something to Buffon, but he\r\ndeveloped his theory along a different line. Whatever view be held in\r\nregard to that theory there is no doubt that Lamarck was a\r\nthorough-going evolutionist. Professor Haeckel speaks of the\r\n_Philosophie Zoologique_ as \"the first connected and thoroughly\r\nlogical exposition of the theory of descent.\"[12]\r\n\r\nBesides the three old masters, as we may call them, Buffon, Erasmus\r\nDarwin, and Lamarck, there were other quite convinced pre-Darwinian\r\nevolutionists. The historian of the theory of descent must take\r\naccount of Treviranus whose _Biology or Philosophy of Animate Nature_\r\nis full of evolutionary suggestions; of Etienne Geoffroy St. Hilaire,\r\nwho in 1830, before the French Academy of Sciences, fought with\r\nCuvier, the fellow-worker of his youth, an intellectual duel on the\r\nquestion of descent; of Goethe, one of the founders of morphology and\r\nthe greatest poet of Evolution--who, in his eighty-first year, heard\r\nthe tidings of Geoffrey St. Hilaire's defeat with an interest which\r\ntranscended the political anxieties of the time; and of many others\r\nwho had gained with more or less confidence and clearness a new\r\noutlook on Nature. It will be remembered that Darwin refers to\r\nthirty-four more or less evolutionist authors in his Historical\r\nSketch, and the list might be added to. Especially when we come near\r\nto 1858 do the numbers increase, and one of the most remarkable, as\r\nalso most independent champions of the evolution-idea before that date\r\nwas Herbert Spencer, who not only marshalled the arguments in a very\r\nforcible way in 1852, but applied the formula in detail in his\r\n_Principles of Psychology_ in 1855.[13]\r\n\r\nIt is right and proper that we should shake ourselves free from all\r\ncreationist appreciations of Darwin, and that we should recognise the\r\nservices of pre-Darwinian evolutionists who helped to make the time\r\nripe, yet one cannot help feeling that the citation of them is apt to\r\nsuggest two fallacies. It may suggest that Darwin simply entered into\r\nthe labours of his predecessors, whereas, as a matter of fact, he knew\r\nvery little about them till after he had been for years at work. To\r\nwrite, as Samuel Butler did, \"Buffon planted, Erasmus Darwin and\r\nLamarck watered, but it was Mr. Darwin who said 'That fruit is ripe,'\r\nand shook it into his lap\" ... seems to us a quite misleading version\r\nof the facts of the case. The second fallacy which the historical\r\ncitation is a little apt to suggest is that the filiation of ideas is\r\na simple problem. On the contrary, the history of an idea, like the\r\npedigree of an organism, is often very intricate, and the evolution of\r\nthe evolution-idea is bound up with the whole progress of the world.\r\nThus in order to interpret Darwin's clear formulation of the idea of\r\norganic evolution and his convincing presentation of it, we have to do\r\nmore than go back to his immediate predecessors, such as Buffon,\r\nErasmus Darwin, and Lamarck; we have to inquire into the acceptance of\r\nevolutionary conceptions in regard to other orders of facts, such as\r\nthe earth and the solar system;[14] we have to realise how the growing\r\nsuccess of scientific interpretation along other lines gave confidence\r\nto those who refused to admit that there was any domain from which\r\nscience could be excluded as a trespasser; we have to take account of\r\nthe development of philosophical thought, and even of theological and\r\nreligious movements; we should also, if we are wise enough, consider\r\nsocial changes. In short, we must abandon the idea that we can\r\nunderstand the history of any science as such, without reference to\r\ncontemporary evolution in other departments of activity.\r\n\r\nWhile there were many evolutionists before Darwin, few of them were\r\nexpert naturalists and few were known outside a small circle; what was\r\nof much more importance was that the genetic view of Nature was\r\ninsinuating itself in regard to other than biological orders of facts,\r\nhere a little and there a little, and that the scientific spirit had\r\nripened since the days when Cuvier laughed Lamarck out of court. How\r\nwas it that Darwin succeeded where others had failed? Because, in the\r\nfirst place, he had clear visions--\"pensées de la jeunesse, executées\r\npar l'âge mûr\"--which a University curriculum had not made impossible,\r\nwhich the _Beagle voyage_ made vivid, which an unrivalled British\r\ndoggedness made real--visions of the web of life, of the fountain of\r\nchange within the organism, of the struggle for existence and its\r\nwinnowing, and of the spreading genealogical tree. Because, in the\r\nsecond place, he put so much grit into the verification of his\r\nvisions, putting them to the proof in an argument which is of its\r\nkind--direct demonstration being out of the question--quite\r\nunequalled. Because, in the third place, he broke down the opposition\r\nwhich the most scientific had felt to the seductive modal formula of\r\nevolution by bringing forward a more plausible theory of the process\r\nthan had been previously suggested. Nor can one forget, since\r\nquestions of this magnitude are human and not merely academic, that he\r\nwrote so that all men could understand.\r\n\r\n\r\n_As Regards the Factors of Evolution_\r\n\r\nIt is admitted by all who are acquainted with the history of biology\r\nthat the general idea of organic evolution as expressed in the\r\nDoctrine of Descent was quite familiar to Darwin's grandfather and to\r\nothers before and after him, as we have briefly indicated. It must\r\nalso be admitted that some of these pioneers of evolutionism did more\r\nthan apply the evolution-idea as a modal formula of becoming, they\r\nbegan to inquire into the factors in the process. Thus there were\r\npre-Darwinian theories of evolution, and to these we must now briefly\r\nrefer.[15]\r\n\r\nIn all biological thinking we have to work with the categories\r\nOrganism--Function--Environment, and theories of evolution may be\r\nclassified in relation to these. To some it has always seemed that the\r\nfundamental fact is the living organism,--a creative agent, a striving\r\nwill, a changeful Proteus, selecting its environment, adjusting itself\r\nto it, self-differentiating and self-adaptive. The necessity of\r\nrecognising the importance of the organism is admitted by all\r\nDarwinians who start with inborn variations, but it is open to\r\nquestion whether the whole truth of what we might call the Goethian\r\nposition is exhausted in the postulate of inherent variability.\r\n\r\nTo others it has always seemed that the emphasis should be laid on\r\nFunction,--on use and disuse, on doing and not doing. Practice makes\r\nperfect; _c'est à force de forger qu'on devient forgeron_. This is one\r\nof the fundamental ideas of Lamarckism; to some extent it met with\r\nDarwin's approval; and it finds many supporters to-day. One of the\r\nablest of these--Mr. Francis Darwin--has recently given strong reasons\r\nfor combining a modernised Lamarckism with what we usually regard as\r\nsound Darwinism.[16]\r\n\r\nTo others it has always seemed that the emphasis should be laid on the\r\nEnvironment, which wakes the organism to action, prompts it to change,\r\nmakes dints upon it, moulds it, prunes it, and finally, perhaps, kills it.\r\nIt is again impossible to doubt that there is truth in this view, for even\r\nif environmentally induced \"modifications\" be not transmissible,\r\nenvironmentally induced \"variations\" are; and even if the direct influence\r\nof the environment be less important than many enthusiastic supporters of\r\nthis view--may we call them Buffonians--think, there remains the indirect\r\ninfluence which Darwinians in part rely on,--the eliminative process. Even\r\nif the extreme view be held that the only form of discriminate elimination\r\nthat counts is inter-organismal competition, this might be included under\r\nthe rubric of the animate environment.\r\n\r\nIn many passages Buffon[17] definitely suggested that environmental\r\ninfluences--especially of climate and food--were directly productive\r\nof changes in organisms, but he did not discuss the question of the\r\ntransmissibility of the modifications so induced, and it is difficult\r\nto gather from his inconsistent writings what extent of transformation\r\nhe really believed in. Prof. Osborn says of Buffon: \"The struggle for\r\nexistence, the elimination of the least-perfected species, the contest\r\nbetween the fecundity of certain species and their constant\r\ndestruction, are all clearly expressed in various passages.\" He quotes\r\ntwo of these:[18]\r\n\r\n\"Le cours ordinaire de la nature vivante, est en général toujours\r\nconstant, toujours le même; son mouvement, toujours régulier, roule\r\nsur deux points inébranlables: l'un, la fécondité sans bornes donnée à\r\ntoutes les espèces; l'autre, les obstacles sans nombre qui réduisent\r\ncette fécondité à une mesure déterminée et ne laissent en tout temps\r\nqu'à peu près la même quantité d'individus de chaque espèce\" ... \"Les\r\nespèces les moins parfaites, les plus délicates, les plus pesantes,\r\nles moins agissantes, les moins armées, etc., ont déjà disparu ou\r\ndisparaîtront.\".\r\n\r\nErasmus Darwin[19] had a firm grip of the \"idea of the gradual\r\nformation and improvement of the Animal world,\" and he had his theory\r\nof the process. No sentence is more characteristic than this: \"All\r\nanimals undergo transformations which are in part produced by their\r\nown exertions, in response to pleasures and pains, and many of these\r\nacquired forms or propensities are transmitted to their posterity.\"\r\nThis is Lamarckism before Lamarck, as his grandson pointed out. His\r\ncentral idea is that wants stimulate efforts and that these result in\r\nimprovements which subsequent generations make better still. He\r\nrealised something of the struggle for existence and even pointed out\r\nthat this advantageously checks the rapid multiplication. \"As Dr.\r\nKrause points out, Darwin just misses the connection between this\r\nstruggle and the Survival of the Fittest.\"[20]\r\n\r\nLamarck[21] (1744-1829) seems to have thought out his theory of\r\nevolution without any knowledge of Erasmus Darwin's which it closely\r\nresembled. The central idea of his theory was the cumulative\r\ninheritance of functional modifications. \"Changes in environment bring\r\nabout changes in the habits of animals. Changes in their wants\r\nnecessarily bring about parallel changes in their habits. If new wants\r\nbecome constant or very lasting, they form new habits, the new habits\r\ninvolve the use of new parts, or a different use of old parts, which\r\nresults finally in the production of new organs and the modification\r\nof old ones.\" He differed from Buffon in not attaching importance, as\r\nfar as animals are concerned, to the direct influence of the\r\nenvironment, \"for environment can effect no direct change whatever\r\nupon the organisation of animals,\" but in regard to plants he agreed\r\nwith Buffon that external conditions directly moulded them.\r\n\r\nTreviranus[22] (1776-1837), whom Huxley ranked beside Lamarck, was on\r\nthe whole Buffonian, attaching chief importance to the influence of a\r\nchangeful environment both in modifying and in eliminating, but he was\r\nalso Goethian, for instance in his idea that species like individuals\r\npass through periods of growth, full bloom, and decline. \"Thus, it is\r\nnot only the great catastrophes of Nature which have caused\r\nextinction, but the completion of cycles of existence, out of which\r\nnew cycles have begun.\" A characteristic sentence is quoted by Prof.\r\nOsborn: \"In every living being there exists a capability of an endless\r\nvariety of form-assumption; each possesses the power to adapt its\r\norganisation to the changes of the outer world, and it is this power,\r\nput into action by the change of the universe, that has raised the\r\nsimple zoophytes of the primitive world to continually higher stages\r\nof organisation, and has introduced a countless variety of species\r\ninto animate Nature.\"\r\n\r\nGoethe[23] (1749-1832), who knew Buffon's work but not Lamarck's, is\r\npeculiarly interesting as one of the first to use the evolution-idea\r\nas a guiding hypothesis, e.g. in the interpretation of vestigial\r\nstructures in man, and to realise that organisms express an attempt to\r\nmake a compromise between specific inertia and individual change. He\r\ngave the finest expression that science has yet known--if it has known\r\nit--of the kernel-idea of what is called \"bathmism,\" the idea of an\r\n\"inherent growth-force\"--and at the same time he held that \"the way of\r\nlife powerfully reacts upon all form\" and that the orderly growth of\r\nform \"yields to change from externally acting causes.\"\r\n\r\nBesides Buffon, Erasmus Darwin, Lamarck, Treviranus, and Goethe,\r\nthere were other \"pioneers of evolution,\" whose views have been often\r\ndiscussed and appraised. Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (1772-1884),\r\nwhose work Goethe so much admired, was on the whole Buffonian,\r\nemphasising the direct action of the changeful _milieu_. \"Species vary\r\nwith their environment, and existing species have descended by\r\nmodification from earlier and somewhat simpler species.\" He had a\r\nglimpse of the selection idea, and believed in mutations or sudden\r\nleaps--induced in the embryonic condition by external influences. The\r\ncomplete history of evolution-theories will include many instances of\r\nguesses at truth which were afterwards substantiated, thus the\r\ngeographer von Buch (1773-1853) detected the importance of the\r\nIsolation factor on which Wagner, Romanes, Gulick and others have laid\r\ngreat stress, but we must content ourselves with recalling one other\r\npioneer, the author of the _Vestiges of Creation_ (1844), a work which\r\npassed through ten editions in nine years and certainly helped to\r\nharrow the soil for Darwin's sowing. As Darwin said, \"it did excellent\r\nservice in this country in calling attention to the subject, in\r\nremoving prejudice, and in thus preparing the ground for the reception\r\nof analogous views.\"[24] Its author, Robert Chambers (1802-1871) was\r\nin part a Buffonian--maintaining that environment moulded organisms\r\nadaptively, and in part a Goethian--believing in an inherent\r\nprogressive impulse which lifted organisms from one grade of\r\norganisation to another.\r\n\r\n\r\n_As Regards Natural Selection_\r\n\r\nThe only thinker to whom Darwin was directly indebted, so far as the\r\ntheory of Natural Selection is concerned, was Malthus, and we may once\r\nmore quote the well-known passage in the Autobiography: \"In October,\r\n1838, that is, fifteen months after I had begun my systematic enquiry,\r\nI happened to read for amusement 'Malthus on Population,' and being\r\nwell prepared to appreciate the struggle for existence which\r\neverywhere goes on from long-continued observation of the habits of\r\nanimals and plants, it at once struck me that under these\r\ncircumstances favourable variations would tend to be preserved, and\r\nunfavourable ones to be destroyed. The result of this would be the\r\nformation of new species.\"[25]\r\n\r\nAlthough Malthus gives no adumbration of the idea of Natural Selection\r\nin his exposition of the eliminative processes which go on in mankind,\r\nthe suggestive value of his essay is undeniable, as is strikingly\r\nborne out by the fact that it gave to Alfred Russel Wallace also \"the\r\nlong-sought clue to the effective agent in the evolution of organic\r\nspecies.\"[26] One day in Ternate when he was resting between fits of\r\nfever, something brought to his recollection the work of Malthus which\r\nhe had read twelve years before. \"I thought of his clear exposition of\r\n'the positive checks to increase'--disease, accidents, war, and\r\nfamine--which keep down the population of savage races to so much\r\nlower an average than that of more civilized peoples. It then occurred\r\nto me that these causes or their equivalents are continually acting in\r\nthe case of animals also; and as animals usually breed much more\r\nrapidly than does mankind, the destruction every year from these\r\ncauses must be enormous in order to keep down the numbers of each\r\nspecies, since they evidently do not increase regularly from year to\r\nyear, as otherwise the world would long ago have been densely crowded\r\nwith those that breed most quickly. Vaguely thinking over the enormous\r\nand constant destruction which this implied, it occurred to me to ask\r\nthe question, Why do some die and some live? And the answer was\r\nclearly, that on the whole the best fitted live. From the effects of\r\ndisease the most healthy escaped; from enemies the strongest, the\r\nswiftest, or the most cunning; from famine the best hunters or those\r\nwith the best digestion; and so on. Then it suddenly flashed upon me\r\nthat this self-acting process would necessarily _improve the race_,\r\nbecause in every generation the inferior would inevitably be killed\r\noff and the superior would remain--that is, _the fittest would\r\nsurvive_.\"[27] We need not apologise for this long quotation, it is a\r\ntribute to Darwin's magnanimous colleague, the Nestor of the\r\nevolutionist camp,--and it probably indicates the line of thought\r\nwhich Darwin himself followed. It is interesting also to recall the\r\nfact that in 1852, when Herbert Spencer wrote his famous _Leader_\r\narticle on \"The Development Hypothesis\" in which he argued powerfully\r\nfor the thesis that the whole animate world is the result of an\r\nage-long process of natural transformation, he wrote for _The\r\nWestminster Review_ another important essay, \"A Theory of Population\r\ndeduced from the General Law of Animal Fertility,\" towards the close\r\nof which he came within an ace of recognising that the struggle for\r\nexistence was a factor in organic evolution. At a time when pressure\r\nof population was practically interesting men's minds, Darwin,\r\nWallace, and Spencer were being independently led from a social\r\nproblem to a biological theory. There could be no better illustration,\r\nas Prof. Patrick Geddes has pointed out, of the Comtian thesis that\r\nscience is a \"social phenomenon.\"\r\n\r\nTherefore, as far more important than any further ferreting out of\r\nvague hints of Natural Selection in books which Darwin never read, we\r\nwould indicate by a quotation the view that the central idea in\r\nDarwinism is correlated with contemporary social evolution. \"The\r\nsubstitution of Darwin for Paley as the chief interpreter of the order\r\nof nature is currently regarded as the displacement of an\r\nanthropomorphic view by a purely scientific one: a little reflection,\r\nhowever, will show that what has actually happened has been merely the\r\nreplacement of the anthropomorphism of the eighteenth century by that\r\nof the nineteenth. For the place vacated by Paley's theological and\r\nmetaphysical explanation has simply been occupied by that suggested to\r\nDarwin and Wallace by Malthus in terms of the prevalent severity of\r\nindustrial competition, and those phenomena of the struggle for\r\nexistence which the light of contemporary economic theory has enabled\r\nus to discern, have thus come to be temporarily exalted into a\r\ncomplete explanation of organic progress.\"[28] It goes without saying\r\nthat the idea suggested by Malthus was developed by Darwin into a\r\nbiological theory which was then painstakingly verified by being used\r\nas an interpretative formula, and that the validity of a theory so\r\nestablished is not affected by what suggested it, but the practical\r\nquestion which this line of thought raises in the mind is this: if\r\nBiology did thus borrow with such splendid results from social theory,\r\nwhy should we not more deliberately repeat the experiment?\r\n\r\nDarwin was characteristically frank and generous in admitting that the\r\nprinciple of Natural Selection had been independently recognised by\r\nDr. W. C. Wells in 1813 and by Mr. Patrick Matthew in 1831, but he had\r\nno knowledge of these anticipations when he published the first\r\nedition of _The Origin of Species_. Wells, whose \"Essay on Dew\" is\r\nstill remembered, read in 1813 before the Royal Society a short paper\r\nentitled \"An Account of a White Female, part of whose skin resembles\r\nthat of a Negro\" (published in 1818). In this communication, as Darwin\r\nsaid, \"he observes, firstly, that all animals tend to vary in some\r\ndegree, and, secondly, that agriculturists improve their domesticated\r\nanimals by selection; and then, he adds, but what is done in this\r\nlatter case 'by art, seems to be done with equal efficacy, though more\r\nslowly, by nature, in the formation of varieties of mankind, fitted\r\nfor the country which they inhabit.'\"[29] Thus Wells had the clear\r\nidea of survival dependent upon a favourable variation, but he makes\r\nno more use of the idea and applies it only to man. There is not in\r\nthe paper the least hint that the author ever thought of generalising\r\nthe remarkable sentence quoted above.\r\n\r\nOf Mr. Patrick Matthew, who buried his treasure in an appendix to a\r\nwork on _Naval Timber and Arboriculture_, Darwin said that \"he clearly\r\nsaw the full force of the principle of natural selection.\" In 1860\r\nDarwin wrote--very characteristically--about this to Lyell: \"Mr.\r\nPatrick Matthew publishes a long extract from his work on _Naval\r\nTimber and Arboriculture_, published in 1831, in which he briefly but\r\ncompletely anticipates the theory of Natural Selection. I have ordered\r\nthe book, as some passages are rather obscure, but it is certainly, I\r\nthink, a complete but not developed anticipation. Erasmus always said\r\nthat surely this would be shown to be the case some day. Anyhow, one\r\nmay be excused in not having discovered the fact in a work on Naval\r\nTimber.\"[30]\r\n\r\nDe Quatrefages and De Varigny have maintained that the botanist Naudin\r\nstated the theory of evolution by natural selection in 1852. He\r\nexplains very clearly the process of artificial selection, and says\r\nthat in the garden we are following Nature's method. \"We do not think\r\nthat Nature has made her species in a different fashion from that in\r\nwhich we proceed ourselves in order to make our variations.\" But, as\r\nDarwin said, \"he does not show how selection acts under nature.\"\r\nSimilarly it must be noted in regard to several pre-Darwinian pictures\r\nof the struggle for existence (such as Herder's, who wrote in 1790\r\n\"All is in struggle ... each one for himself\" and so on), that a\r\nrecognition of this is only the first step in Darwinism.\r\n\r\nProfs. E. Perrier and H. F. Osborn have called attention to a\r\nremarkable anticipation of the selection-idea which is to be found in\r\nthe speculations of Étienne Geoffroy Saint-Hilaire (1825-1828) on the\r\nevolution of modern Crocodilians from the ancient Teleosaurs. Changing\r\nenvironment induced changes in the respiratory system and far-reaching\r\nconsequences followed. The atmosphere, acting upon the pulmonary\r\ncells, brings about \"modifications which are favourable or destructive\r\n('funestes'); these are inherited, and they influence all the rest of\r\nthe organisation of the animal because if these modifications lead to\r\ninjurious effects the animals which exhibit them perish and are\r\nreplaced by others of a somewhat different form, a form changed so as\r\nto be adapted to (à la convenance) the new environment.\"\r\n\r\nProf. E. B. Poulton[31] has shown that the anthropologist James Cowles\r\nPrichard (1786-1848) must be included even in spite of himself among\r\nthe precursors of Darwin. In some passages of the second edition of\r\nhis _Researches into the Physical History of Mankind_ (1826), he\r\ncertainly talks evolution and anticipates Prof. Weismann in denying\r\nthe transmission of acquired characters. He is, however, sadly\r\nself-contradictory and his evolutionism weakens in subsequent\r\neditions--the only ones that Darwin saw. Prof. Poulton finds in\r\nPrichard's work a recognition of the operation of Natural Selection.\r\n\"After inquiring how it is that 'these varieties are developed and\r\npreserved in connexion with particular climates and differences of\r\nlocal situation,' he gives the following very significant answer: 'One\r\ncause which tends to maintain this relation is obvious. Individuals\r\nand families, and even whole colonies perish and disappear in climates\r\nfor which they are, by peculiarity of constitution, not adapted. Of\r\nthis fact proofs have been already mentioned.'\" Mr. Francis Darwin and\r\nProf. A. C. Seward discuss Prichard's \"anticipations\" in _More Letters\r\nof Charles Darwin_, Vol. _I._ p. 43, and come to the conclusion that\r\nthe evolutionary passages are entirely neutralised by others of an\r\nopposite trend. There is the same difficulty with Buffon.\r\n\r\nHints of the idea of Natural Selection have been detected elsewhere.\r\nJames Watt,[32] for instance, has been reported as one of the\r\nanticipators (1851). But we need not prolong the inquiry further,\r\nsince Darwin did not know of any anticipations until after he had\r\npublished the immortal work of 1859, and since none of those who got\r\nhold of the idea made any use of it. What Darwin did was to follow the\r\nclue which Malthus gave him, to realise, first by genius and\r\nafterwards by patience, how the complex and subtle struggle for\r\nexistence works out a natural selection of those organisms which vary\r\nin the direction of fitter adaptation to the conditions of their life.\r\nSo much success attended his application of the Selection-formula that\r\nfor a time he regarded Natural Selection as almost the sole factor in\r\nevolution, variations being pre-supposed; gradually, however, he came\r\nto recognise that there was some validity in the factors which had\r\nbeen emphasised by Lamarck and by Buffon, and in his well known\r\nsumming up in the sixth edition of the _Origin_ he says of the\r\ntransformation of species: \"This has been effected chiefly through the\r\nnatural selection of numerous successive, slight, favourable\r\nvariations; aided in an important manner by the inherited effects of\r\nthe use and disuse of parts; and in an unimportant manner, that is, in\r\nrelation to adaptive structures, whether past or present, by the\r\ndirect action of external conditions, and by variations which seem to\r\nus in our ignorance to arise spontaneously.\"\r\n\r\nTo sum up: the idea of organic evolution, older than Aristotle, slowly\r\ndeveloped from the stage of suggestion to the stage of verification,\r\nand the first convincing verification was Darwin's; from being an _a\r\npriori_ anticipation it has become an interpretation of nature, and\r\nDarwin is still the chief interpreter; from being a modal\r\ninterpretation it has advanced to the rank of a causal theory, the\r\nmost convincing part of which men will never cease to call Darwinism.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Columbia University Biological Series_, Vol. I.

THE IDEA OF SELECTION\r\n\r\nMany and diverse were the discoveries made by Charles Darwin in the\r\ncourse of a long and strenuous life, but none of them has had so\r\nfar-reaching an influence on the science and thought of his time as\r\nthe theory of selection. I do not believe that the theory of evolution\r\nwould have made its way so easily and so quickly after Darwin took up\r\nthe cudgels in favour of it if he had not been able to support it by a\r\nprinciple which was capable of solving, in a simple manner, the\r\ngreatest riddle that living nature presents to us,--I mean the\r\npurposiveness of every living form relative to the conditions of its\r\nlife and its marvellously exact adaptation to these.\r\n\r\nEveryone knows that Darwin was not alone in discovering the principle\r\nof selection, and that the same idea occurred simultaneously and\r\nindependently to Alfred Russel Wallace. At the memorable meeting of\r\nthe Linnean Society on 1st July, 1858, two papers were read\r\n(communicated by Lyell and Hooker) both setting forth the same idea of\r\nselection. One was written by Charles Darwin in Kent, the other by\r\nAlfred Wallace in Ternate, in the Malay Archipelago. It was a splendid\r\nproof of the magnanimity of these two investigators, that they thus in\r\nall friendliness and without envy, united in laying their ideas\r\nbefore a scientific tribunal: their names will always shine side by\r\nside as two of the brightest stars in the scientific sky.\r\n\r\nThe idea of selection set forth by the two naturalists was at the time\r\nabsolutely new, but it was also so simple that Huxley could say of it\r\nlater, \"How extremely stupid not to have thought of that.\" As Darwin\r\nwas led to the general doctrine of descent, not through the labours of\r\nhis predecessors in the early years of the century, but by his own\r\nobservations, so it was in regard to the principle of selection. He\r\nwas struck by the innumerable cases of adaptation, as, for instance,\r\nthat of the woodpeckers and tree-frogs to climbing, or the hooks and\r\nfeather-like appendages of seeds, which aid in the distribution of\r\nplants, and he said to himself that an explanation of adaptations was\r\nthe first thing to be sought for in attempting to formulate a theory\r\nof evolution.\r\n\r\nBut since adaptations point to _changes_ which have been undergone by\r\nthe ancestral forms of existing species, it is necessary, first of\r\nall, to inquire how far species in general are _variable_. Thus\r\nDarwin's attention was directed in the first place to the phenomenon\r\nof variability, and the use man has made of this, from very early\r\ntimes, in the breeding of his domesticated animals and cultivated\r\nplants. He inquired carefully how breeders set to work, when they\r\nwished to modify the structure and appearance of a species to their\r\nown ends, and it was soon clear to him that _selection for breeding\r\npurposes_ played the chief part.\r\n\r\nBut how was it possible that such processes should occur in free\r\nnature? Who is here the breeder, making the selection, choosing out\r\none individual to bring forth offspring and rejecting others? That was\r\nthe problem that for a long time remained a riddle to him.\r\n\r\nDarwin himself relates how illumination suddenly came to him. He had\r\nbeen reading, for his own pleasure, Malthus' book on Population, and,\r\nas he had long known from numerous observations, that every species\r\ngives rise to many more descendants than ever attain to maturity, and\r\nthat, therefore, the greater number of the descendants of a species\r\nperish without reproducing, the idea came to him that the decision as\r\nto which member of a species was to perish and which was to attain to\r\nmaturity and reproduction might not be a matter of chance, but might\r\nbe determined by the constitution of the individuals themselves,\r\naccording as they were more or less fitted for survival. With this\r\nidea the foundation of the theory of selection was laid.\r\n\r\nIn _artificial selection_ the breeder chooses out for pairing only\r\nsuch individuals as possess the character desired by him in a somewhat\r\nhigher degree than the rest of the race. Some of the descendants\r\ninherit this character, often in a still higher degree, and if this\r\nmethod be pursued throughout several generations, the race is\r\ntransformed in respect of that particular character.\r\n\r\n_Natural selection_ depends on the same three factors as _artificial\r\nselection_: on _variability_, _inheritance_, and _selection for\r\nbreeding_, but this last is here carried out not by a breeder but by\r\nwhat Darwin called the \"struggle for existence.\" This last factor is\r\none of the special features of the Darwinian conception of nature.\r\nThat there are carnivorous animals which take heavy toll in every\r\ngeneration of the progeny of the animals on which they prey, and that\r\nthere are herbivores which decimate the plants in every generation had\r\nlong been known, but it is only since Darwin's time that sufficient\r\nattention has been paid to the facts that, in addition to this regular\r\ndestruction, there exists between the members of a species a keen\r\ncompetition for space and food, which limits multiplication, and that\r\nnumerous individuals of each species perish because of unfavourable\r\nclimatic conditions. The \"struggle for existence,\" which Darwin\r\nregarded as taking the place of the human breeder in free nature, is\r\nnot a direct struggle between carnivores and their prey, but is the\r\nassumed competition for survival between individuals _of the same_\r\nspecies, of which, on an average, only those survive to reproduce\r\nwhich have the greatest power of resistance, while the others, less\r\nfavourably constituted, perish early. This struggle is so keen, that,\r\nwithin a limited area, where the conditions of life have long remained\r\nunchanged, of every species, whatever be the degree of fertility, only\r\ntwo, _on an average_, of the descendants of each pair survive; the\r\nothers succumb either to enemies, or to disadvantages of climate, or\r\nto accident. A high degree of fertility is thus not an indication of\r\nthe special success of a species, but of the numerous dangers that\r\nhave attended its evolution. Of the six young brought forth by a pair\r\nof elephants in the course of their lives only two survive in a given\r\narea; similarly, of the millions of eggs which two thread-worms leave\r\nbehind them only two survive. It is thus possible to estimate the\r\ndangers which threaten a species by its ratio of elimination, or,\r\nsince this cannot be done directly, by its fertility.\r\n\r\nAlthough a great number of the descendants of each generation fall\r\nvictims to accident, among those that remain it is still the greater\r\nor less fitness of the organism that determines the \"selection for\r\nbreeding purposes,\" and it would be incomprehensible if, in this\r\ncompetition, it were not ultimately, that is, on an average, the best\r\nequipped which survive, in the sense of living long enough to\r\nreproduce.\r\n\r\nThus the principle of natural selection is _the selection of the best\r\nfor reproduction_, whether the \"best\" refers to the whole\r\nconstitution, to one or more parts of the organism, or to one or more\r\nstages of development. Every organ, every part, every character of an\r\nanimal, fertility and intelligence included, must be improved in this\r\nmanner, and be gradually brought up in the course of generations to\r\nits highest attainable state of perfection. And not only may\r\nimprovement of parts be brought about in this way, but new parts and\r\norgans may arise, since, through the slow and minute steps of\r\nindividual or \"fluctuating\" variations, a part may be added here or\r\ndropped out there, and thus something new is produced.\r\n\r\nThe principle of selection solved the riddle as to how what was\r\npurposive could conceivably be brought about without the intervention\r\nof a directing power, the riddle which animate nature presents to our\r\nintelligence at every turn, and in face of which the mind of a Kant\r\ncould find no way out, for he regarded a solution of it as not to be\r\nhoped for. For, even if we were to assume an evolutionary force that\r\nis continually transforming the most primitive and the simplest forms\r\nof life into ever higher forms, and the homogeneity of primitive times\r\ninto the infinite variety of the present, we should still be unable to\r\ninfer from this alone how each of the numberless forms adapted to\r\nparticular conditions of life should have appeared _precisely at the\r\nright moment in the history of the earth_ to which their adaptations\r\nwere appropriate, and precisely at the proper place in which all the\r\nconditions of life to which they were adapted occurred: the\r\nhumming-birds at the same time as the flowers; the trichina at the\r\nsame time as the pig; the bark-coloured moth at the same time as the\r\noak, and the wasp-like moth at the same time as the wasp which\r\nprotects it. Without processes of selection we should be obliged to\r\nassume a \"pre-established harmony\" after the famous Leibnitzian model,\r\nby means of which the clock of the evolution of organisms is so\r\nregulated as to strike in exact synchronism with that of the history\r\nof the earth! All forms of life are strictly adapted to the conditions\r\nof their life, and can persist under these conditions alone.\r\n\r\nThere must therefore be an intrinsic connection between the conditions\r\nand the structural adaptations of the organism, and, _since the\r\nconditions of life cannot be determined by the animal itself, the\r\nadaptations must be called forth by the conditions_.\r\n\r\nThe selection theory teaches us how this is conceivable, since it\r\nenables us to understand that there is a continual production of what\r\nis non-purposive as well as of what is purposive, but the purposive\r\nalone survives, while the non-purposive perishes in the very act of\r\narising. This is the old wisdom taught long ago by Empedocles.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. THE LAMARCKIAN PRINCIPLE\r\n\r\nLamarck, as is well known, formulated a definite theory of evolution\r\nat the beginning of the nineteenth century, exactly fifty years before\r\nthe Darwin-Wallace principle of selection was given to the world. This\r\nbrilliant investigator also endeavoured to support his theory by\r\ndemonstrating forces which might have brought about the\r\ntransformations of the organic world in the course of the ages. In\r\naddition to other factors, he laid special emphasis on the increased\r\nor diminished use of the parts of the body, assuming that the\r\nstrengthening or weakening which takes place from this cause during\r\nthe individual life, could be handed on to the offspring, and thus\r\nintensified and raised to the rank of a specific character. Darwin\r\nalso regarded this _Lamarckian principle_, as it is now generally\r\ncalled, as a factor in evolution, but he was not fully convinced of\r\nthe transmissibility of acquired characters.\r\n\r\nAs I have here to deal only with the theory of selection, I need not\r\ndiscuss the Lamarckian hypothesis, but I must express my opinion that\r\nthere is room for much doubt as to the coöperation of this principle\r\nin evolution. Not only is it difficult to imagine how the transmission\r\nof functional modifications could take place, but, up to the present\r\ntime, notwithstanding the endeavours of many excellent investigators,\r\nnot a single actual proof of such inheritance has been brought\r\nforward. Semon's experiments on plants are, according to the botanist\r\nPfeffer, not to be relied on, and even the recent, beautiful\r\nexperiments made by Dr. Kammerer on salamanders, cannot, as I hope to\r\nshow elsewhere, be regarded as proof, if only because they do not deal\r\nat all with functional modifications, that is, with modifications\r\nbrought about by use, and it is to these _alone_ that the Lamarckian\r\nprinciple refers.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. OBJECTIONS TO THE THEORY OF SELECTION\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Saltatory evolution_\r\n\r\nThe Darwinian doctrine of evolution depends essentially on _the\r\ncumulative augmentation_ of minute variations in the direction of\r\nutility. But can such minute variations, which are undoubtedly\r\ncontinually appearing among the individuals of the same species,\r\npossess any selection-value; can they determine which individuals are\r\nto survive, and which are to succumb; can they be increased by natural\r\nselection till they attain to the highest development of a purposive\r\nvariation?\r\n\r\nTo many this seems so improbable that they have urged a theory of\r\nevolution by leaps from species to species. Kölliker, in 1872,\r\ncompared the evolution of species with the processes which we can\r\nobserve in the individual life in cases of alternation of generations.\r\nBut a polyp only gives rise to a medusa because it has itself arisen\r\nfrom one, and there can be no question of a medusa ever having arisen\r\nsuddenly and _de novo_ from a polyp-bud, if only because both forms\r\nare adapted in their structure as a whole, and in every detail to the\r\nconditions of their life. A sudden origin, in a natural way, of\r\nnumerous adaptations is inconceivable. Even the degeneration of a\r\nmedusoid from a free-swimming animal to a mere brood-sac (gonophore)\r\nis not sudden and saltatory, but occurs by imperceptible modifications\r\nthroughout hundreds of years, as we can learn from the numerous stages\r\nof the process of degeneration persisting at the same time in\r\ndifferent species.\r\n\r\nIf, then, the degeneration to a simple brood-sac takes place only by\r\nvery slow transitions, each stage of which may last for centuries, how\r\ncould the much more complex _ascending_ evolution possibly have taken\r\nplace by sudden leaps? I regard this argument as capable of further\r\nextension, for wherever in nature we come upon degeneration, it is\r\ntaking place by minute steps and with a slowness that makes it not\r\ndirectly perceptible, and I believe that this in itself justifies us\r\nin concluding that _the same must be true of ascending_ evolution. But\r\nin the latter case the goal can seldom be distinctly recognised while\r\nin cases of degeneration the starting-point of the process can often\r\nbe inferred, because several nearly related species may represent\r\ndifferent stages.\r\n\r\nIn recent years Bateson in particular has championed the idea of\r\nsaltatory, or so-called discontinuous evolution, and has collected a\r\nnumber of cases in which more or less marked variations have suddenly\r\nappeared. These are taken for the most part from among domesticated\r\nanimals which have been bred and crossed for a long time, and it is\r\nhardly to be wondered at that their much mixed and much influenced\r\ngerm-plasm should, under certain conditions, give rise to remarkable\r\nphenomena, often indeed producing forms which are strongly suggestive\r\nof monstrosities, and which would undoubtedly not survive in free\r\nnature, unprotected by man. I should regard such cases as due to an\r\nintensified germinal selection--though this is to anticipate a\r\nlittle--and from this point of view it cannot be denied that they have\r\na special interest. But they seem to me to have no significance as far\r\nas the transformation of species is concerned, if only because of the\r\nextreme rarity of their occurrence.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, many variations which have appeared in a sudden\r\nand saltatory manner, and some of these Darwin pointed out and\r\ndiscussed in detail: the copper beech, the weeping trees, the oak with\r\n\"fern-like leaves,\" certain garden-flowers, etc. But none of them have\r\npersisted in free nature, or evolved into permanent types.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, wherever enduring types have arisen, we find traces\r\nof a gradual origin by successive stages, even if, at first sight,\r\ntheir origin may appear to have been sudden. This is the case with\r\n_seasonal Dimorphism_, the first known cases of which exhibited marked\r\ndifferences between the two generations, the winter and the summer\r\nbrood. Take for instance the much discussed and studied form\r\n_Vanessa_ (_Araschnia_) _levana-prorsa_. Here the differences between\r\nthe two forms are so great and so apparently disconnected, that one\r\nmight almost believe it to be a sudden mutation, were it not that old\r\ntransition-stages can be called forth by particular temperatures, and\r\nwe know other butterflies, as for instance our Garden Whites, in which\r\nthe differences between the two generations are not nearly so marked;\r\nindeed, they are so little apparent that they are scarcely likely to\r\nbe noticed except by experts. Thus here again there are small initial\r\nsteps, some of which, indeed, must be regarded as adaptations, such as\r\nthe green-sprinkled or lightly tinted under-surface which gives them a\r\ndeceptive resemblance to parsley or to Cardamine leaves.\r\n\r\nEven if saltatory variations do occur, we cannot assume that these\r\n_have ever led to forms which are capable of survival under the\r\nconditions of wild life_. Experience has shown that in plants which\r\nhave suddenly varied the power of persistence is diminished.\r\nKorschinsky attributes to them weaknesses of organisation in general;\r\n\"they bloom late, ripen few of their seeds, and show great\r\nsensitiveness to cold.\" These are not the characters which make for\r\nsuccess in the struggle for existence.\r\n\r\nWe must briefly refer here to the views--much discussed in the last\r\ndecade--of H. de Vries, who believes that the roots of transformation\r\nmust be sought for in _saltatory variations arising from internal\r\ncauses_, and distinguishes such _mutations_, as he has called them,\r\nfrom ordinary individual variations, in that they breed true, that is,\r\nwith strict in-breeding they are handed on pure to the next\r\ngeneration. I have elsewhere endeavoured to point out the weaknesses\r\nof this theory,[33] and I am the less inclined to return to it here\r\nthat it now appears[34] that the far-reaching conclusions drawn by de\r\nVries from his observations on the Evening Primrose, _Oenothera\r\nlamarckiana_, rest upon a very insecure foundation. The plant from\r\nwhich de Vries saw numerous \"species\"--his \"mutations\"--arise was not,\r\nas he assumed, a _wild species_ that had been introduced to Europe\r\nfrom America, but was probably a hybrid form which was first\r\ndiscovered in the Jardin des Plantes in Paris, and which does not\r\nappear to exist anywhere in America as a wild species.\r\n\r\nThis gives a severe shock to the \"Mutation theory,\" for the other\r\n_actually wild_ species with which de Vries experimented showed no\r\n\"mutations\" but yielded only negative results.\r\n\r\nThus we come to the conclusion that Darwin[35] was right in regarding\r\ntransformations as taking place by minute steps, which, if useful, are\r\naugmented in the course of innumerable generations, because their\r\npossessors more frequently survive in the struggle for existence.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Selection-value of the initial steps_\r\n\r\nIs it possible that the insignificant deviations which we know as\r\n\"individual variations\" can form the beginning of a process of\r\nselection? Can they decide which is to perish and which to survive? To\r\nuse a phrase of Romanes, can they have _selection-value_?\r\n\r\nDarwin himself answered this question, and brought together many\r\nexcellent examples to show that differences, apparently insignificant\r\nbecause very small, might be of decisive importance for the life of\r\nthe possessor. But it is by no means enough to bring forward cases of\r\nthis kind, for the question is not merely whether finished adaptations\r\nhave selection-value, but whether the first beginnings of these, and\r\nwhether the small, I might almost say minimal increments, which have\r\nled up from these beginnings to the perfect adaptation, have also had\r\nselection-value. To this question even one who, like myself, has been\r\nfor many years a convinced adherent of the theory of selection, can\r\nonly reply: _We must assume so, but we cannot prove it in any case_.\r\nIt is not upon demonstrative evidence that we rely when we champion\r\nthe doctrine of selection as a scientific truth; we base our argument\r\non quite other grounds. Undoubtedly there are many apparently\r\ninsignificant features, which can nevertheless be shown to be\r\nadaptations--for instance, the thickness of the basin-shaped shell of\r\nthe limpets that live among the breakers on the shore. There can be no\r\ndoubt that the thickness of these shells, combined with their flat\r\nforms, protects the animals from the force of the waves breaking upon\r\nthem,--but how have they become so thick? What proportion of thickness\r\nwas sufficient to decide that of two variants of a limpet one should\r\nsurvive, the other be eliminated? We can say nothing more than that we\r\ninfer from the present state of the shell, that it must have varied in\r\nregard to differences in shell-thickness, and that these differences\r\nmust have had selection-value,--no proof therefore, but an assumption\r\nwhich we must show to be convincing.\r\n\r\nFor a long time the marvellously complex _radiate_ and _lattice-work_\r\nskeletons of Radiolarians were regarded as a mere outflow of \"Nature's\r\ninfinite wealth of form,\" as an instance of a purely morphological\r\ncharacter with no biological significance. But recent investigations\r\nhave shown that these, too, have an adaptive significance (Häcker).\r\nThe same thing has been shown by Schütt in regard to the lowly\r\nunicellular plants, the Peridineae, which abound alike on the surface\r\nof the ocean and in its depths. It has been shown that the long\r\nskeletal processes which grow out from these organisms have\r\nsignificance not merely as a supporting skeleton, but also as an\r\nextension of the superficial area, which increases the contact with\r\nthe water-particles, and prevents the floating organisms from sinking.\r\nIt has been established that the processes are considerably shorter in\r\nthe colder layers of the ocean, and that they may be twelve times as\r\nlong[36] in the warmer layers, thus corresponding to the greater or\r\nsmaller amount of friction which takes place in the denser and less\r\ndense layers of the water.\r\n\r\nThe Peridineae of the warmer ocean layers have thus become long-rayed,\r\nthose of the colder layers short-rayed, not through the direct effect\r\nof friction on the protoplasm, but through processes of selection,\r\nwhich favoured the longer rays in warm water, since they kept the\r\norganism afloat, while those with short rays sank and were eliminated.\r\nIf we put the question as to selection-value in this case, and ask how\r\ngreat the variations in the length of processes must be in order to\r\npossess selection-value; what can we answer except that these\r\nvariations must have been minimal, and yet sufficient to prevent too\r\nrapid sinking and consequent elimination? Yet this very case would\r\ngive the ideal opportunity for a mathematical calculation of the\r\nminimal selection-value, although of course it is not feasible from\r\nlack of data to carry out the actual calculation.\r\n\r\nBut even in organisms of more than microscopic size there must\r\nfrequently be minute, even microscopic differences which set going the\r\nprocess of selection, and regulate its progress to the highest\r\npossible perfection.\r\n\r\nMany tropical trees possess thick, leathery leaves, as a protection\r\nagainst the force of the tropical raindrops. The _direct_ influence of\r\nthe rain cannot be the cause of this power of resistance, for the\r\nleaves, while they were still thin, would simply have been torn to\r\npieces. Their toughness must therefore be referred to selection, which\r\nwould favour the trees with slightly thicker leaves, though we cannot\r\ncalculate with any exactness how great the first stages of increase in\r\nthickness must have been. Our hypothesis receives further support from\r\nthe fact that, in many such trees, the leaves are drawn out into a\r\nbeak-like prolongation (Stahl and Haberlandt) which facilitates the\r\nrapid falling off of the rain water, and also from the fact that the\r\nleaves, while they are still young, hang limply down in bunches which\r\noffer the least possible resistance to the rain. Thus there are here\r\nthree adaptations which can only be interpreted as due to selection.\r\nThe initial stages of these adaptations must undoubtedly have had\r\nselection-value.\r\n\r\nBut even in regard to this case we are reasoning in a circle, not\r\ngiving \"proofs,\" and no one who does not wish to believe in the\r\nselection-value of the initial stages can be forced to do so. Among\r\nthe many pieces of presumptive evidence a particularly weighty one\r\nseems to me to be _the smallness of the steps of progress_ which we\r\ncan observe in certain cases, as for instance in leaf-imitation among\r\nbutterflies, and in mimicry generally. The resemblance to a leaf, for\r\ninstance of a particular Kallima, seems to us so close as to be\r\ndeceptive, and yet we find in another individual, or it may be in many\r\nothers, a spot added which increases the resemblance, and which could\r\nnot have become fixed unless the increased deceptiveness so produced\r\nhad frequently led to the overlooking of its much persecuted\r\npossessor. But if we take the selection-value of the initial stages\r\nfor granted, we are confronted with the further question which I\r\nmyself formulated many years ago: How does it happen _that the\r\nnecessary beginnings of a useful variation are always present_? How\r\ncould insects which live upon or among green leaves become all green,\r\nwhile those that live on bark become brown? How have the desert\r\nanimals become yellow and the Arctic animals white? Why were the\r\nnecessary variations always present? How could the green locust lay\r\nbrown eggs, or the privet caterpillar develop white and lilac-coloured\r\nlines on its green skin?\r\n\r\nIt is of no use answering to this that the question is wrongly\r\nformulated[37] and that it is the converse that is true; that the\r\nprocess of selection takes place in accordance with the variations\r\nthat present themselves. This proposition is undeniably true, but so\r\nalso is another, which apparently negatives it: the variation required\r\nhas in the majority of cases actually presented itself. Selection\r\ncannot solve this contradiction; it does not call forth the useful\r\nvariation, but simply works upon it. The ultimate reason why one and\r\nthe same insect should occur in green and in brown, as often happens\r\nin caterpillars and locusts, lies in the fact that variations towards\r\nbrown presented themselves, and so also did variations towards green:\r\n_the kernel of the riddle lies in the varying_, and for the present we\r\ncan only say, that small variations in different directions present\r\nthemselves in every species. Otherwise so many different kinds of\r\nvariations could not have arisen. I have endeavoured to explain this\r\nremarkable fact by means of the intimate processes that must take\r\nplace within the germ-plasm, and I shall return to the problem when\r\ndealing with \"germinal selection.\"\r\n\r\nWe have, however, to make still greater demands on variation, for it\r\nis not enough that the necessary variation should occur in isolated\r\nindividuals, because in that case there would be small prospect of its\r\nbeing preserved, notwithstanding its utility. Darwin at first\r\nbelieved, that even single variations might lead to transformation of\r\nthe species, but later he became convinced that this was impossible,\r\nat least without the coöperation of other factors, such as isolation\r\nand sexual selection.\r\n\r\nIn the case of the _green caterpillars with bright longitudinal\r\nstripes_, numerous individuals exhibiting this useful variation must\r\nhave been produced to start with. In all higher, that is,\r\nmulticellular organisms, the germ-substance is the source of all\r\ntransmissible variations, and this germ-plasm is not a simple\r\nsubstance but is made up of many primary constituents. The question\r\ncan therefore be more precisely stated thus: How does it come about\r\nthat in so many cases the useful variations present themselves in\r\nnumbers just where they are required, the white oblique lines in the\r\nleaf-caterpillar on the under surface of the body, the accompanying\r\ncoloured stripes just above them? And, further, how has it come about\r\nthat in grass caterpillars, not oblique but longitudinal stripes,\r\nwhich are more effective for concealment among grass and plants, have\r\nbeen evolved? And finally, how is it that the same Hawk-moth\r\ncaterpillars, which to-day show oblique stripes, possessed\r\nlongitudinal stripes in Tertiary times? We can read this fact from the\r\nhistory of their development, and I have before attempted to show the\r\nbiological significance of this change of colour.[38]\r\n\r\nFor the present I need only draw the conclusion that one and the same\r\ncaterpillar may exhibit the initial stages of both, and that it\r\ndepends on the manner in which these marking elements are\r\n_intensified_ and _combined_ by natural selection whether whitish\r\nlongitudinal or oblique stripes should result. In this case then the\r\n\"useful variations\" were actually \"always there,\" and we see that in\r\nthe same group of Lepidoptera, e.g. species of Sphingidae, evolution\r\nhas occurred in both directions according to whether the form lived\r\namong grass or on broad leaves with oblique lateral veins, and we can\r\nobserve even now that the species with oblique stripes have\r\nlongitudinal stripes when young, that is to say, while the stripes\r\nhave no biological significance. The white places in the skin which\r\ngave rise, probably first as small spots, to this protective marking\r\ncould be combined in one way or another according to the requirements\r\nof the species. They must therefore either have possessed\r\nselection-value from the first, or, if this was not the case at their\r\nearliest occurrence, there must have been _some other factors_ which\r\nraised them to the point of selection-value. I shall return to this in\r\ndiscussing germinal selection. But the case may be followed still\r\nfarther, and leads us to the same alternative on a still more secure\r\nbasis.\r\n\r\nMany years ago I observed in caterpillars of _Smerinthus populi_ (the\r\npoplar hawk-moth), which also possess white oblique stripes, that\r\ncertain individuals showed _red spots_ above these stripes; these\r\nspots occurred only on certain segments, and never flowed together to\r\nform continuous stripes. In another species (_Smerinthus tiliae_)\r\nsimilar blood-red spots unite to form a line-like coloured seam in the\r\nlast stage of larval life, while in _S. ocellata_ rust-red spots\r\nappear in individual caterpillars, but more rarely than in _S.\r\npopuli_, and they show no tendency to flow together.\r\n\r\nThus we have here the origin of a new character, arising from small\r\nbeginnings, at least in _S. tiliae_, in which species the coloured\r\nstripes are a normal specific character. In the other species, _S.\r\npopuli_ and _S. ocellata_, we find the beginnings of the same\r\nvariation, in one more rarely than in the other, and we can imagine\r\nthat, in the course of time, in these two species, coloured lines over\r\nthe oblique stripes will arise. In any case these spots are the\r\nelements of variation, out of which coloured lines _may_ be evolved,\r\nif they are combined in this direction through the agency of natural\r\nselection. In _S. populi_ the spots are often small, but sometimes it\r\nseems as though several had united to form large spots. Whether a\r\nprocess of selection in this direction will arise in _S. populi_ and\r\n_S. ocellata_, or whether it is now going on cannot be determined,\r\nsince we cannot tell in advance what biological value the marking\r\nmight have for these two species. It is conceivable that the spots may\r\nhave no selection-value as far as these species are concerned, and may\r\ntherefore disappear again in the course of phylogeny, or, on the other\r\nhand, that they may be changed in another direction, for instance\r\ntowards imitation of the rust-red fungoid patches on poplar and willow\r\nleaves. In any case we may regard the smallest spots as the initial\r\nstages of variation, the larger as a cumulative summation of these.\r\nTherefore either these initial stages must already possess\r\nselection-value, or, as I said before: _There must be some other\r\nreason for their cumulative summation_. I should like to give one more\r\nexample, in which we can infer, though we cannot directly observe, the\r\ninitial stages.\r\n\r\nAll the Holothurians or sea-cucumbers have in the skin calcereous\r\nbodies of different forms, usually thick and irregular, which make the\r\nskin tough and resistant. In a small group of them--the species of\r\nSynapta--the calcareous bodies occur in the form of delicate anchors\r\nof microscopic size. Up till 1897 these anchors, like many other\r\ndelicate microscopic structures, were regarded as curiosities, as\r\nnatural marvels. But a Swedish observer, Oestergren, has recently\r\nshown that they have a biological significance: they serve the\r\nfootless Synapta as auxiliary organs of locomotion, since, when the\r\nbody swells up in the act of creeping, they press firmly with their\r\ntips, which are embedded in the skin, against the substratum on which\r\nthe animal creeps, and thus prevent slipping backwards. In other\r\nHolothurians this slipping is made impossible by the fixing of the\r\ntube-feet. The anchors act automatically, sinking their tips towards\r\nthe ground when the corresponding part of the body thickens, and\r\nreturning to the original position at an angle of 45 degrees to the\r\nupper surface when the part becomes thin again. The arms of the anchor\r\ndo not lie in the same plane as the shaft, and thus the curve of the\r\narms forms the outermost part of the anchor, and offers no further\r\nresistance to the gliding of the animal. Every detail of the anchor,\r\nthe curved portion, the little teeth at the head, the arms, etc., can\r\nbe interpreted in the most beautiful way, above all the form of the\r\nanchor itself, for the two arms prevent it from swaying round to the\r\nside. The position of the anchors, too, is definite and significant;\r\nthey lie obliquely to the longitudinal axis of the animal, and\r\ntherefore they act alike whether the animal is creeping backwards or\r\nforwards. Moreover, the tips would pierce through the skin if the\r\nanchors lay in the longitudinal direction. Synapta burrows in the\r\nsand; it first pushes in the thin anterior end, and thickens this\r\nagain, thus enlarging the hole, then the anterior tentacles displace\r\nmore sand, the body is worked in a little farther, and the process\r\nbegins anew. In the first act the anchors are passive, but they begin\r\nto take an active share in the forward movement when the body is\r\ncontracted again. Frequently the animal retains only the posterior end\r\nburied in the sand, and then the anchors keep it in position, and make\r\nrapid withdrawal possible.\r\n\r\nThus we have in these apparently random forms of the calcereous\r\nbodies, complex adaptations in which every little detail as to\r\ndirection, curve, and pointing is exactly determined. That they have\r\nselection-value in their present perfected form is beyond all doubt,\r\nsince the animals are enabled by means of them to bore rapidly into\r\nthe ground and so to escape from enemies. We do not know what the\r\ninitial stages were, but we cannot doubt that the little improvements,\r\nwhich occurred as variations of the originally simple slimy bodies of\r\nthe Holothurians, were preserved because they already possessed\r\nselection-value for the Synaptidae. For such minute microscopic\r\nstructures whose form is so delicately adapted to the rôle they have\r\nto play in the life of the animal, cannot have arisen suddenly and as\r\na whole, and every new variation of the anchor, that is, in the\r\ndirection of the development of the two arms, and every curving of the\r\nshaft which prevented the tips from projecting at the wrong time, in\r\nshort, every little adaptation in the modelling of the anchor must\r\nhave possessed selection-value. And that such minute changes of form\r\nfall within the sphere of fluctuating variations, that is to say,\r\n_that they occur_ is beyond all doubt.\r\n\r\nIn many of the Synaptidae the anchors are replaced by calcareous rods\r\nbent in the form of an S, which are said to act in the same way.\r\nOthers, such as those of the genus Ankyroderma, have anchors which\r\nproject considerably beyond the skin, and, according to Oestergren,\r\nserve \"to catch plant-particles and other substances\" and so mask the\r\nanimal. Thus we see that in the Synaptidae the thick and irregular\r\ncalcareous bodies of the Holothurians have been modified and\r\ntransformed in various ways in adaptation to the footlessness of these\r\nanimals, and to the peculiar conditions of their life, and we must\r\nconclude that the earlier stages of these changes presented themselves\r\nto the processes of selection in the form of microscopic variations.\r\nFor it is as impossible to think of any origin other than through\r\nselection in this case as in the case of the toughness, and the\r\n\"drip-tips\" of tropical leaves. And as these last could not have been\r\nproduced directly by the beating of the heavy raindrops upon them, so\r\nthe calcareous anchors of Synapta cannot have been produced directly\r\nby the friction of the sand and mud at the bottom of the sea, and,\r\nsince they are parts whose function is _passive_ the Lamarckian factor\r\nof use and disuse does not come into question. The conclusion is\r\nunavoidable, that the microscopically small variations of the\r\ncalcareous bodies in the ancestral forms have been intensified and\r\naccumulated in a particular direction, till they have led to the\r\nformation of the anchor. Whether this has taken place by the action of\r\nnatural selection alone, or whether the laws of variation and the\r\nintimate processes within the germ-plasm have coöperated will become\r\nclear in the discussion of germinal selection. This whole process of\r\nadaptation has obviously taken place within the time that has elapsed\r\nsince this group of sea-cucumbers lost their tube-feet, those\r\ncharacteristic organs of locomotion which occur in no group except the\r\nEchinoderms, and yet have totally disappeared in the Synaptidae. And\r\nafter all what would animals that live in sand and mud do with\r\ntube-feet?\r\n\r\n\r\n(_c_) _Coadaptation_\r\n\r\nDarwin pointed out that one of the essential differences between\r\nartificial and natural selection lies in the fact that the former can\r\nmodify only a few characters, usually only one at a time, while Nature\r\npreserves in the struggle for existence all the variations of a\r\nspecies, at the same time and in a purely mechanical way, if they\r\npossess selection-value.\r\n\r\nHerbert Spencer, though himself an adherent of the theory of selection,\r\ndeclared in the beginning of the nineties that in his opinion the range of\r\nthis principle was greatly over-estimated, if the great changes which have\r\ntaken place in so many organisms in the course of ages are to be\r\ninterpreted as due to this process of selection alone, since no\r\ntransformation of any importance can be evolved by itself; it is always\r\naccompanied by a host of secondary changes. He gives the familiar example\r\nof the Giant Stag of the Irish peat, the enormous antlers of which required\r\nnot only a much stronger skull cap, but also greater strength of the\r\nsinews, muscles, nerves and bones of the whole anterior half of the animal,\r\nif their mass was not to weigh down the animal altogether. It is\r\ninconceivable, he says, that so many processes of selection should take\r\nplace _simultaneously_, and we are therefore forced to fall back on the\r\nLamarckian factor of the use and disuse of functional parts. And how, he\r\nasks, could natural selection follow two opposite directions of evolution\r\nin different parts of the body at the same time, as for instance in the\r\ncase of the kangaroo, in which the forelegs must have become shorter, while\r\nthe hind legs and the tail were becoming longer and stronger?\r\n\r\nSpencer's main object was to substantiate the validity of the\r\nLamarckian principle, the coöperation of which with selection had been\r\ndoubted by many. And it does seem as though this principle, if it\r\noperates in nature at all, offers a ready and simple explanation of\r\nall such secondary variations. Not only muscles, but nerves, bones,\r\nsinews, in short all tissues which function actively, increase in\r\nstrength in proportion as they are used, and conversely they decrease\r\nwhen the claims on them diminish. All the parts, therefore, which\r\ndepend on the part that varied first, as for instance the enlarged\r\nantlers of the Irish Elk, must have been increased or decreased in\r\nstrength, in exact proportion to the claims made upon them,--just as\r\nis actually the case.\r\n\r\nBut beautiful as this explanation would be, I regard it as untenable,\r\nbecause it assumes the _transmissibility of functional modifications_\r\n(so-called \"acquired\" characters), and this is not only\r\nundemonstrable, but is scarcely theoretically conceivable, for the\r\nsecondary variations which accompany or follow the first as\r\ncorrelative variations, occur also in cases in which the animals\r\nconcerned are sterile and _therefore cannot transmit anything to their\r\ndescendants_. This is true of _worker bees_, and particularly of\r\n_ants_, and I shall here give a brief survey of the present state of\r\nthe problem as it appears to me.\r\n\r\nMuch has been written on both sides of this question since the\r\npublished controversy on the subject in the nineties between Herbert\r\nSpencer and myself. I should like to return to the matter in detail,\r\nif the space at my disposal permitted, because it seems to me that the\r\narguments I advanced at that time are equally cogent to-day,\r\nnotwithstanding all the objections that have since been urged against\r\nthem. Moreover, the matter is by no means one of subordinate interest;\r\nit is the very kernel of the whole question of the reality and value\r\nof the principle of selection. For if selection alone does not suffice\r\nto explain \"_harmonious adaptation_\" as I have called Spencer's\r\n_Coadaptation_, and if we require to call in the aid of the Lamarckian\r\nfactor it would be questionable whether selection would explain any\r\nadaptations whatever. In this particular case--of worker bees--the\r\nLamarckian factor may be excluded altogether, for it can be\r\ndemonstrated that here at any rate the effects of use and disuse\r\ncannot be transmitted.\r\n\r\nBut if it be asked why we are unwilling to admit the coöperation of\r\nthe Darwinian factor of selection and the Lamarckian factor, since\r\nthis would afford us an easy and satisfactory explanation of the\r\nphenomena, I answer: _Because the Lamarckian principle is fallacious,\r\nand because by accepting it we close the way towards deeper insight_.\r\nIt is not a spirit of combativeness or a desire for self-vindication\r\nthat induces me to take the field once more against the Lamarckian\r\nprinciple, it is the conviction that the progress of our knowledge is\r\nbeing obstructed by the acceptance of this fallacious principle, since\r\nthe facile explanation it apparently affords prevents our seeking\r\nafter a truer explanation and a deeper analysis.\r\n\r\nThe workers in the various species of ants are sterile, that is to\r\nsay, they take no regular part in the reproduction of the species,\r\nalthough individuals among them may occasionally lay eggs. In addition\r\nto this they have lost the wings, and the _receptaculum seminis_, and\r\ntheir compound eyes have degenerated to a few facets. How could this\r\nlast change have come about through disuse, since the eyes of workers\r\nare exposed to light in the same way as are those of the sexual\r\ninsects and thus in this particular case are not liable to \"disuse\" at\r\nall? The same is true of the _receptaculum seminis_, which can only\r\nhave been disused as far as its glandular portion and its stalk are\r\nconcerned, and also of the wings, the nerves tracheae and epidermal\r\ncells of which could not cease to function until the whole wing had\r\ndegenerated, for the chitinous skeleton of the wing does not function\r\nat all in the active sense.\r\n\r\nBut, on the other hand, the workers in all species have undergone\r\nmodifications in a positive direction, as, for instance, the greater\r\ndevelopment of brain. In many species large workers have evolved,--the\r\nso-called _soldiers_, with enormous jaws and teeth, which defend the\r\ncolony,--and in others there are _small_ workers which have taken over\r\nother special functions, such as the rearing of the young Aphides.\r\nThis kind of division of the workers into two castes occurs among\r\nseveral tropical species of ants, but it is also present in the\r\nItalian species, _Colobopsis truncata_. Beautifully as the size of the\r\njaws could be explained as due to the increased use made of them by\r\nthe \"soldiers,\" or the enlarged brain as due to the mental activities\r\nof the workers, the fact of the infertility of these forms is an\r\ninsurmountable obstacle to accepting such an explanation. Neither jaws\r\nnor brain can have been evolved on the Lamarckian principle.\r\n\r\nThe problem of coadaptation is no easier in the case of the ant than\r\nin the case of the Giant Stag. Darwin himself gave a pretty\r\nillustration to show how imposing the difference between the two kinds\r\nof workers in one species would seem if we translated it into human\r\nterms. In regard to the Driver ants (Anomma) we must picture to\r\nourselves a piece of work, \"for instance the building of a house,\r\nbeing carried on by two kinds of workers, of which one group was five\r\nfeet four inches high, the other sixteen feet high.\"[39]\r\n\r\nAlthough the ant is a small animal as compared with man or with the\r\nIrish Elk, the \"soldier\" with its relatively enormous jaws is hardly\r\nless heavily burdened than the Elk with its antlers, and in the ant's\r\ncase, too, a strengthening of the skeleton, of the muscles, the nerves\r\nof the head, and of the legs must have taken place parallel with the\r\nenlargement of the jaws. _Harmonious adaptation_ (coadaptation) has\r\nhere been active in a high degree, and yet these \"soldiers\" are\r\nsterile! There thus remains nothing for it but to refer all their\r\nadaptations, positive and negative alike, to processes of selection\r\nwhich have taken place in the rudiments of the workers within the egg\r\nand sperm-cells of their parents. There is no way out of the\r\ndifficulty except the one Darwin pointed out. He himself did not find\r\nthe solution of the riddle at once. At first he believed that the case\r\nof the workers among social insects presented \"the most serious\r\nspecial difficulty\" in the way of his theory of natural selection; and\r\nit was only after it had become clear to him that it was not the\r\nsterile insects themselves but their parents that were selected,\r\naccording as they produced more or less well adapted workers, that he\r\nwas able to refer to this very case of the conditions among ants \"_in\r\norder to show the power of natural selection_.\"[40] He explains his\r\nview by a simple but interesting illustration. Gardeners have\r\nproduced, by means of long continued artificial selection, a variety\r\nof Stock, which bears entirely double, and therefore infertile\r\nflowers.[41] Nevertheless the variety continues to be reproduced from\r\nseed, because, in addition to the double and infertile flowers, the\r\nseeds always produce a certain number of single, fertile blossoms, and\r\nthese are used to reproduce the double variety. These single and\r\nfertile plants correspond \"to the males and females of an ant-colony,\r\nthe infertile plants, which are regularly produced in large numbers,\r\nto the neuter workers of the colony.\"\r\n\r\nThis illustration is entirely apt, the only difference between the\r\ntwo cases consisting in the fact that the variation in the flower is\r\nnot a useful, but a disadvantageous one, which can only be preserved\r\nby artificial selection on the part of the gardener, while the\r\ntransformations that have taken place parallel with the sterility of\r\nthe ants are useful, since they procure for the colony an advantage in\r\nthe struggle for existence, and they are therefore preserved by\r\nnatural selection. Even the sterility itself in this case is not\r\ndisadvantageous, since the fertility of the true females has at the\r\nsame time considerably increased. We may therefore regard the sterile\r\nforms of ants, which have gradually been adapted in several directions\r\nto varying functions, _as a certain proof_ that selection really takes\r\nplace in the germ-cells of the fathers and mothers of the workers, and\r\nthat _special complexes of primordia_ (_ids_) are present in the\r\nworkers and in the males and females, and these complexes contain the\r\nprimordia of the individual parts (_determinants_). But since all\r\nliving entities vary, the determinants must also vary, now in a\r\nfavourable, now in an unfavourable direction. If a female produces\r\neggs, which contain favourably varying determinants in the worker-ids,\r\nthen these eggs will give rise to workers modified in the favourable\r\ndirection, and if this happens with many females, the colony concerned\r\nwill contain a better kind of worker than other colonies.\r\n\r\nI digress here in order to give an account of the intimate processes,\r\nwhich, according to my view, take place within the germ-plasm, and\r\nwhich I have called \"_germinal selection_.\" These processes are of\r\nimportance since they form the roots of variation, which in its turn\r\nis the root of natural selection. I cannot here do more than give a\r\nbrief outline of the theory in order to show how the Darwin-Wallace\r\ntheory of selection has gained support from it.\r\n\r\nWith others, I regard the minimal amount of substance which is\r\ncontained within the nucleus of the germ-cells, in the form of rods,\r\nbands, or granules, as the _germ-substance_ or _germ-plasm_, and I\r\ncall the individual granules _ids_. There is always a multiplicity of\r\nsuch ids present in the nucleus, either occurring individually, or\r\nunited in the form of rods or bands (chromosomes). Each id contains\r\nthe primary constituents of a _whole_ individual, so that several ids\r\nare concerned in the development of a new individual.\r\n\r\nIn every being of complex structure thousands of primary constituents\r\nmust go to make up a single id; these I call _determinants_, and I\r\nmean by this name very small individual particles, far below the\r\nlimits of microscopic visibility, vital units which feed, grow, and\r\nmultiply by division. These determinants control the parts of the\r\ndeveloping embryo,--in what manner need not here concern us. The\r\ndeterminants differ among themselves, those of a muscle are\r\ndifferently constituted from those of a nerve-cell or a glandular\r\ncell, etc., and every determinant is in its turn made up of minute\r\nvital units, which I call _biophores_, or the bearers of life.\r\nAccording to my view, these determinants not only assimilate, like\r\nevery other living unit, but they _vary_ in the course of their\r\ngrowth, as every living unit does; they may vary qualitatively if the\r\nelements of which they are composed vary, they may grow and divide\r\nmore or less rapidly, and their variations give rise to\r\n_corresponding_ variations of the organ, cell, or cell-group which\r\nthey determine. That they are undergoing ceaseless fluctuations in\r\nregard to size and quality seems to me the inevitable consequence of\r\ntheir unequal nutrition; for although the germ-cell as a whole usually\r\nreceives sufficient nutriment, minute fluctuations in the amount\r\ncarried to different parts within the germ-plasm cannot fail to occur.\r\n\r\nNow, if a determinant, for instance of a sensory cell, receives for a\r\nconsiderable time more abundant nutriment than before, it will grow\r\nmore rapidly--become bigger, and divide more quickly, and, later, when\r\nthe id concerned develops into an embryo, this sensory cell will\r\nbecome stronger than in the parents, possibly even twice as strong.\r\nThis is an instance of a _hereditary individual variation_, arising\r\nfrom the germ.\r\n\r\nThe nutritive stream which, according to our hypothesis, favours the\r\ndeterminant _N_ by chance, that is, for reasons unknown to us, may\r\nremain strong for a considerable time, or may decrease again; but even\r\nin the latter case it is conceivable that the ascending movement of\r\nthe determinant may continue, because the strengthened determinant now\r\n_actively_ nourishes itself more abundantly,--that is to say, it\r\nattracts the nutriment to itself, and to a certain extent withdraws it\r\nfrom its fellow-determinants. In this way, it may--as it seems to\r\nme--get into _permanent upward movement, and attain a degree of\r\nstrength from which there is no falling back_. Then positive or\r\nnegative selection sets in, favouring the variations which are\r\nadvantageous, setting aside those which are disadvantageous.\r\n\r\nIn a similar manner a _downward_ variation of the determinants may\r\ntake place, if its progress be started by a diminished flow of\r\nnutriment. The determinants which are weakened by this diminished flow\r\nwill have less affinity for attracting nutriment because of their\r\ndiminished strength, and they will assimilate more feebly and grow\r\nmore slowly, unless chance streams of nutriment help them to recover\r\nthemselves. But, as will presently be shown, a change of direction\r\ncannot take place at _every_ stage of the degenerative process. If a\r\ncertain critical stage of downward progress be passed, even favourable\r\nconditions of food-supply will no longer suffice permanently to change\r\nthe direction of the variation. Only two cases are conceivable; if the\r\ndeterminant corresponds to a _useful_ organ, only its removal can\r\nbring back the germ-plasm to its former level; therefore personal\r\nselection removes the id in question, with its determinants, from the\r\ngerm-plasm, by causing the elimination of the individual in the\r\nstruggle for existence. But there is another conceivable case; the\r\ndeterminants concerned may be those of an organ which has become\r\n_useless_, and they will then continue unobstructed, but with\r\nexceeding slowness, along the downward path, until the organ becomes\r\nvestigial, and finally disappears altogether.\r\n\r\nThe fluctuations of the determinants hither and thither may thus be\r\ntransformed into a lasting ascending or descending movement; and _this\r\nis the crucial point of these germinal processes_.\r\n\r\nThis is not a fantastic assumption; we can read it in the fact of the\r\ndegeneration of disused parts. _Useless organs are the only ones which\r\nare not helped to ascend again by personal selection, and therefore in\r\ntheir case alone can we form any idea of how the primary constituents\r\nbehave, when they are subject solely to intra-germinal forces_.\r\n\r\nThe whole determinant system of an id, as I conceive it, is in a state\r\nof continual fluctuation upwards and downwards. In most cases the\r\nfluctuations will counteract one another, because the passive streams\r\nof nutriment soon change, but in many cases the limit from which a\r\nreturn is possible will be passed, and then the determinants concerned\r\nwill continue to vary in the same direction, till they attain positive\r\nor negative selection-value. At this stage personal selection\r\nintervenes and sets aside the variation if it is disadvantageous, or\r\nfavours--that is to say, preserves--it if it is advantageous. Only\r\n_the determinant of a useless organ is uninfluenced by personal\r\nselection_, and, as experience shows, it sinks downwards; that is, the\r\norgan that corresponds to it degenerates very slowly but\r\nuninterruptedly till, after what must obviously be an immense stretch\r\nof time, it disappears from the germ-plasm altogether.\r\n\r\nThus we find in the fact of the degeneration of disused parts the\r\nproof that not all the fluctuations of a determinant return to\r\nequilibrium again, but that, when the movement has attained to a\r\ncertain strength, it continues _in the same direction_. We have entire\r\ncertainty in regard to this as far as the downward progress is\r\nconcerned, and we must assume it also in regard to ascending\r\nvariations, as the phenomena of artificial selection certainly justify\r\nus in doing. If the Japanese breeders were able to lengthen the\r\ntail-feathers of the cock to six feet, it can only have been because\r\nthe determinants of the tail-feathers in the germ-plasm had already\r\nstruck out a path of ascending variation, and this movement was taken\r\nadvantage of by the breeder, who continually selected for reproduction\r\nthe individuals in which the ascending variation was most marked. For\r\nall breeding depends upon the unconscious selection of germinal\r\nvariations.\r\n\r\nOf course these germinal processes cannot be proved mathematically,\r\nsince we cannot actually see the play of forces of the passive\r\nfluctuations and their causes. We cannot say how great these\r\nfluctuations are, and how quickly or slowly, how regularly or\r\nirregularly they change. Nor do we know how far a determinant must be\r\nstrengthened by the passive flow of the nutritive stream if it is to\r\nbe beyond the danger of unfavourable variations, or how far it must be\r\nweakened passively before it loses the power of recovering itself by\r\nits own strength. It is no more possible to bring forward actual\r\nproofs in this case than it was in regard to the selection-value of\r\nthe initial stages of an adaptation. But if we consider that all\r\nheritable variations must have their roots in the germ-plasm, and\r\nfurther, that when personal selection does not intervene, that is to\r\nsay, in the case of parts which have become useless, a degeneration of\r\nthe part, and therefore also of its determinant must inevitably take\r\nplace; then we must conclude that processes such as I have assumed are\r\nrunning their course within the germ-plasm, and we can do this with as\r\nmuch certainty as we were able to infer, from the phenomena of\r\nadaptation, the selection-value of their initial stages. The fact of\r\nthe degeneration of disused parts seems to me to afford irrefutable\r\nproof that the fluctuations within the germ-plasm _are the real root\r\nof all hereditary variation_, and the preliminary condition for the\r\noccurrence of the Darwin-Wallace factor of selection. Germinal\r\nselection supplies the stones out of which personal selection builds\r\nher temples and palaces: _adaptations_. The importance for the theory\r\nof the process of degeneration of disused parts cannot be\r\nover-estimated, especially when it occurs in sterile animal forms,\r\nwhere we are free from the doubt as to the alleged _Lamarckian factor_\r\nwhich is apt to confuse our ideas in regard to other cases.\r\n\r\nIf we regard the variation of the many determinants concerned in the\r\ntransformation of the female into the sterile worker as having come\r\nabout through the gradual transformation of the ids into worker-ids,\r\nwe shall see that the germ-plasm of the sexual ants must contain three\r\nkinds of ids, male, female, and worker ids, or if the workers have\r\ndiverged into soldiers and nest-builders, then four kinds. We\r\nunderstand that the worker-ids arose because their determinants struck\r\nout a useful path of variation, whether upward or downward, and that\r\nthey continued in this path until the highest attainable degree of\r\nutility of the parts determined was reached. But in addition to the\r\norgans of positive or negative selection-value, there were some which\r\nwere indifferent as far as the success and especially the functional\r\ncapacity of the workers was concerned: wings, ovarian tubes,\r\n_receptaculum seminis_, a number of the facets of the eye, perhaps\r\neven the whole eye. As to the ovarian tubes it is is possible that\r\ntheir degeneration was an advantage for the workers, in saving energy,\r\nand if so selection would favour the degeneration; but how could the\r\npresence of eyes diminish the usefulness of the workers to the colony?\r\nor the minute _receptaculum seminis_, or even the wings? These parts\r\nhave therefore degenerated _because they were of no further value to\r\nthe insect_. But if selection did not influence the setting aside of\r\nthese parts because they were neither of advantage nor of disadvantage\r\nto the species, then the Darwinian factor of selection is here\r\nconfronted with a puzzle which it cannot solve alone, but which at\r\nonce becomes clear when germinal selection is added. For the\r\ndeterminants of organs that have no further value for the organism,\r\nmust, as we have already explained, embark on a gradual course of\r\nretrograde development.\r\n\r\nIn ants the degeneration has gone so far that there are no\r\nwing-rudiments present in _any_ species, as is the case with so many\r\nbutterflies, flies, and locusts, but in the larvae the imaginable\r\ndiscs of the wings are still laid down. With regard to the ovaries,\r\ndegeneration has reached different levels in different species of\r\nants, as has been shown by the researches of my former pupil,\r\nElizabeth Bickford. In many species there are twelve ovarian tubes,\r\nand they decrease from that number to one; indeed, in one species no\r\novarian tube at all is present. So much at least is certain from what\r\nhas been said, that in this case _everything_ depends on the\r\nfluctuations of the elements of the germ-plasm. Germinal selection,\r\nhere as elsewhere, presents the variations of the determinants, and\r\npersonal selection favours or rejects these, or,--if it be a question\r\nof organs which have become useless,--it does not come into play at\r\nall, and allows the descending variation free course.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that even the problem of _coadaptation in sterile\r\nanimals_ can thus be satisfactorily explained. If the determinants are\r\noscillating upwards and downwards in continual fluctuation, and\r\nvarying more pronouncedly now in one direction now in the other,\r\nuseful variations of every determinant will continually present\r\nthemselves anew, and may, in the course of generations, be combined\r\nwith one another in various ways. But there is one character of the\r\ndeterminants that greatly facilitates this complex process of\r\nselection, that, after a certain limit has been reached, they go on\r\nvarying in the same direction. From this it follows that development\r\nalong a path once struck out may proceed without the continual\r\nintervention of personal selection. This factor only operates, so to\r\nspeak, at the beginning, when it selects the determinants which are\r\nvarying in the right direction, and again at the end, when it is\r\nnecessary to put a check upon further variation. In addition to this,\r\nenormously long periods have been available for all these adaptations,\r\nas the very gradual transition stages between females and workers in\r\nmany species plainly show, and thus this process of transformation\r\nloses the marvellous and mysterious character that seemed at the first\r\nglance to invest it, and takes rank, without any straining, among the\r\nother processes of selection. It seems to me that, from the facts that\r\nsterile animal forms can adapt themselves to new vital functions,\r\ntheir superfluous parts degenerate, and the parts more used adapt\r\nthemselves in an ascending direction, those less used in a descending\r\ndirection, we must draw the conclusion that harmonious adaptation here\r\ncomes about _without the coöperation of the Lamarckian principle_.\r\nThis conclusion once established, however, we have no reason to refer\r\nthe thousands of cases of harmonious adaptation, which occur in\r\nexactly the same way among other animals or plants, to a principle,\r\nthe _active intervention of which in the transformation of species is\r\nnowhere proved. We do not require it to explain the facts, and\r\ntherefore we must not assume it._\r\n\r\nThe fact of coadaptation, which was supposed to furnish the strongest\r\nargument against the principle of selection, in reality yields the\r\nclearest evidence in favour of it. We _must_ assume it, _because no\r\nother possibility of explanation is open to us, and because these\r\nadaptations actually exist, that is to say, have really taken place_.\r\nWith this conviction I attempted, as far back as 1894, when the idea\r\nof germinal selection had not yet occurred to me, to make \"harmonious\r\nadaptation\" (coadaptation) more easily intelligible in some way or\r\nother, and so I was led to the idea, which was subsequently expounded\r\nin detail by Baldwin, and Lloyd Morgan, and also by Osborn, and Gulick\r\nas _Organic Selection_. It seemed to me that it was not necessary that\r\nall the germinal variations required for secondary variations should\r\nhave occurred _simultaneously_, since, for instance, in the case of\r\nthe stag, the bones, muscles, sinews, and nerves would be incited by\r\nthe increasing heaviness of the antlers to greater activity in _the\r\nindividual life_, and so would be strengthened. The antlers can only\r\nhave increased in size by very slow degrees, so that the muscles and\r\nbones may have been able to keep pace with their growth in the\r\nindividual life, until the requisite germinal variations presented\r\nthemselves. In this way a disharmony between the increasing weight of\r\nthe antlers and the parts which support and move them would be\r\navoided, since time would be given for the appropriate germinal\r\nvariations to occur, and so to set agoing the _hereditary_ variation\r\nof the muscles, sinews and bones.[42]\r\n\r\nI still regard this idea as correct, but I attribute less importance\r\nto \"organic selection\" than I did at that time, in so far that I do\r\nnot believe that it _alone_ could effect complex harmonious\r\nadaptations. Germinal selection now seems to me to play the chief part\r\nin bringing about such adaptations. Something the same is true of the\r\nprinciple I have called _Panmixia_. As I became more and more\r\nconvinced, in the course of years, that the _Lamarckian principle_\r\nought not to be called in to explain the dwindling of disused parts, I\r\nbelieved that this process might be simply explained as due to the\r\ncessation of the conservative effect of natural selection. I said to\r\nmyself that, from the moment in which a part ceases to be of use,\r\nnatural selection withdraws its hand from it, and then it must\r\ninevitably fall from the height of its adaptiveness, because inferior\r\nvariants would have as good a chance of persisting as better ones,\r\nsince all grades of fitness of the part in question would be mingled\r\nwith one another indiscriminately. This is undoubtedly true, as\r\nRomanes pointed out ten years before I did, and this mingling of the\r\nbad with the good probably does bring about a deterioration of the\r\npart concerned. But it cannot account for the steady diminution, which\r\nalways occurs when a part is in process of becoming rudimentary, and\r\nwhich goes on until it ultimately disappears altogether. The process\r\nof dwindling cannot therefore be explained as due to panmixia alone:\r\nwe can only find a sufficient explanation in germinal selection.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV. DERIVATIVES OF THE THEORY OF SELECTION\r\n\r\nThe impetus in all directions given by Darwin through his theory of\r\nselection has been an immeasurable one, and its influence is still\r\nfelt. It falls within the province of the historian of science to\r\nenumerate all the ideas which, in the last quarter of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, grew out of Darwin's theories, in the endeavour to penetrate\r\nmore deeply into the problem of the evolution of the organic world.\r\nWithin the narrow limits to which this paper is restricted, I cannot\r\nattempt to discuss any of these.\r\n\r\n\r\nV. ARGUMENTS FOR THE REALITY OF THE PROCESSES OF SELECTION\r\n\r\n\r\n(_a_) _Sexual Selection_\r\n\r\nSexual selection goes hand in hand with natural selection. From the\r\nvery first I have regarded sexual selection as affording an extremely\r\nimportant and interesting corroboration of natural selection, but,\r\nsingularly enough, it is precisely against this theory that an adverse\r\njudgment has been pronounced in so many quarters, and it is only quite\r\nrecently, and probably in proportion as the wealth of facts in proof\r\nof it penetrates into a wider circle, that we seem to be approaching a\r\nmore general recognition of this side of the problem of adaptations.\r\nThus Darwin's words in his preface to the second edition (1874) of his\r\nbook, _The Descent of Man and Sexual Selection_, are being justified:\r\n\"My conviction as to the operation of natural selection remains\r\nunshaken,\" and further, \"If naturalists were to become more familiar\r\nwith the idea of sexual selection, it would, I think, be accepted to a\r\nmuch greater extent, and already it is fully and favourably accepted\r\nby many competent judges.\" Darwin was able to speak thus because he\r\nwas already acquainted with an immense mass of facts, which, taken\r\ntogether, yield overwhelming evidence of the validity of the principle\r\nof sexual selection.\r\n\r\n_Natural selection_ chooses out for reproduction the individuals that\r\nare best equipped for the struggle for existence, and it does so at\r\nevery stage of development; it thus improves the species in all its\r\nstages and forms. _Sexual selection_ operates only on individuals\r\nthat are already capable of reproduction, and does so only in relation\r\nto the attainment of reproduction. It arises from the rivalry of one\r\nsex, usually the male, for the possession of the other, usually the\r\nfemale. Its influence can therefore only _directly_ affect one sex, in\r\nthat it equips it better for attaining possession of the other. But\r\nthe effect may extend indirectly to the female sex, and thus the whole\r\nspecies may be modified, without, however, becoming any more capable\r\nof resistance in the struggle for existence, for sexual selection only\r\ngives rise to adaptations which are likely to give their possessor the\r\nvictory over rivals in the struggle for possession of the female, and\r\nwhich are therefore peculiar to the wooing sex: the manifold\r\n\"secondary sexual characters.\" The diversity of these characters is so\r\ngreat that I cannot here attempt to give anything approaching a\r\ncomplete treatment of them, but I should like to give a sufficient\r\nnumber of examples to make the principle itself, in its various modes\r\nof expression, quite clear.\r\n\r\nOne of the chief preliminary postulates of sexual selection is the\r\nunequal number of individuals in the two sexes, for if every male\r\nimmediately finds his mate there can be no competition for the\r\npossession of the female. Darwin has shown that, for the most part,\r\nthe inequality between the sexes is due simply to the fact that there\r\nare more males than females, and therefore the males must take some\r\npains to secure a mate. But the inequality does not always depend on\r\nthe numerical preponderance of the males, it is often due to polygamy;\r\nfor, if one male claims several females, the number of females in\r\nproportion to the rest of the males will be reduced. Since it is\r\nalmost always the males that are the wooers, we must expect to find\r\nthe occurrence of secondary sexual characters chiefly among them, and\r\nto find it especially frequent in polygamous species. And this is\r\nactually the case.\r\n\r\nIf we were to try to guess--without knowing the facts--what means the\r\nmale animals make use of to overcome their rivals in the struggle for\r\nthe possession of the female, we might name many kinds of means, but\r\nit would be difficult to suggest any which is not actually employed in\r\nsome animal group of other. I begin with the mere difference in\r\nstrength, through which the male of many animals is so sharply\r\ndistinguished from the female, as, for instance, the lion, walrus,\r\n\"sea-elephant,\" and others. Among these the males fight violently for\r\nthe possession of the female, who falls to the victor in the combat.\r\nIn this simple case no one can doubt the operation of selection, and\r\nthere is just as little room for doubt as to the selection-value of\r\nthe initial stages of the variation. Differences in bodily strength\r\nare apparent even among human beings, although in their case the\r\nstruggle for the possession of the female is no longer decided by\r\nbodily strength alone.\r\n\r\nCombats between male animals are often violent and obstinate, and the\r\nemployment of the natural weapons of the species in this way has led\r\nto perfecting of these, e.g. the tusks of the boar, the antlers of the\r\nstag, and the enormous, antler-like jaws of the stag-beetle. Here\r\nagain it is impossible to doubt that variations in these organs\r\npresented themselves, and that these were considerable enough to be\r\ndecisive in combat, and so to lead to the improvement of the weapon.\r\n\r\nAmong many animals, however, the females at first withdraw from the\r\nmales; they are coy, and have to be sought out, and sometimes held by\r\nforce. This tracking and grasping of the females by the males has\r\ngiven rise to many different characters in the latter, as, for\r\ninstance, the larger eyes of the male bee, and especially of the males\r\nof the Ephemerids (May-flies), some species of which show, in addition\r\nto the usual compound eyes, large, so-called turban-eyes, so that the\r\nwhole head is covered with seeing surfaces. In these species the\r\nfemales are very greatly in the minority (1-100), and it is easy to\r\nunderstand that a keen competition for them must take place, and that,\r\nwhen the insects of both sexes are floating freely in the air, an\r\nunusually wide range of vision will carry with it a decided\r\nadvantage. Here again the actual adaptations are in accordance with\r\nthe preliminary postulates of the theory. We do not know the stages\r\nthrough which the eye has passed to its present perfected state, but,\r\nsince the number of simple eyes (facets) has become very much greater\r\nin the male than in the female, we may assume that their increase is\r\ndue to a gradual duplication of the determinants of the ommatidium in\r\nthe germ-plasm, as I have already indicated in regard to sense-organs\r\nin general. In this case, again, the selection-value of the initial\r\nstages hardly admits of doubt; better vision _directly_ secures\r\nreproduction.\r\n\r\nIn many cases _the organ of smell_ shows a similar improvement. Many\r\nlower Crustaceans (Daphnidae) have better developed organs of smell in\r\nthe male sex. The difference is often slight and amounts only to one\r\nor two olfactory filaments, but certain species show a difference of\r\nnearly a hundred of these filaments (Leptodora). The same thing occurs\r\namong insects.\r\n\r\nWe must briefly consider the clasping or grasping organs which have\r\ndeveloped in the males among many lower Crustaceans, but here natural\r\nselection plays its part along with sexual selection, for the union of\r\nthe sexes is an indispensable condition for the maintenance of the\r\nspecies, and as Darwin himself pointed out, in many cases the two\r\nforms of selection merge into each other. This fact has always seemed\r\nto me to be a proof of natural selection, for, in regard to sexual\r\nselection, it is quite obvious that the victory of the best-equipped\r\ncould have brought about the improvement only of the organs concerned,\r\nthe factors in the struggle, such as the eye and the olfactory organ.\r\n\r\nWe come now to the _excitants_; that is, to the group of sexual\r\ncharacters whose origin through processes of selection has been most\r\nfrequently called in question. We may cite the _love-calls_ produced\r\nby many male insects, such as crickets and cicadas. These could only\r\nhave arisen in animal groups in which the female did not rapidly flee\r\nfrom the male, but was inclined to accept his wooing from the first.\r\nThus, notes like the chirping of the male cricket serve to entice the\r\nfemales. At first they were merely the signal which showed the\r\npresence of a male in the neighbourhood, and the female was gradually\r\nenticed nearer and nearer by the continued chirping. The male that\r\ncould make himself heard to the greatest distance would obtain the\r\nlargest following, and would transmit the beginnings, and, later, the\r\nimprovement of his voice to the greatest number of descendants. But\r\nsexual excitement in the female became associated with the hearing of\r\nthe love-call, and then the sound-producing organ of the male began to\r\nimprove, until it attained to the emission of the long-drawn-out soft\r\nnotes of the mole-cricket or the maenad-like cry of the cicadas. I\r\ncannot here follow the process of development in detail, but will call\r\nattention to the fact that the original purpose of the voice, the\r\nannouncing of the male's presence, became subsidiary, and the exciting\r\nof the female became the chief goal to be aimed at. The loudest\r\nsingers awakened the strongest excitement, and the improvement\r\nresulted as a matter of course. I conceive of the origin of bird-song\r\nin a somewhat similar manner, first as a means of enticing, then of\r\nexciting the female.\r\n\r\nOne more kind of secondary sexual character must here be mentioned:\r\nthe odour which emanates from so many animals at the breeding season.\r\nIt is possible that this odour also served at first merely to give\r\nnotice of the presence of individuals of the other sex, but it soon\r\nbecame an excitant, and as the individuals which caused the greatest\r\ndegree of excitement were preferred, it reached as high a pitch of\r\nperfection as was possible to it. I shall confine myself here to the\r\ncomparatively recently discovered fragrance of butterflies. Since\r\nFritz Müller found out that certain Brazilian butterflies gave off\r\nfragrance \"like a flower,\" we have become acquainted with many such\r\ncases, and we now know that in all lands, not only many diurnal\r\nLepidoptera but nocturnal ones also give off a delicate odour, which\r\nis agreeable even to man. The ethereal oil to which this fragrance is\r\ndue is secreted by the skin-cells, usually of the wing, as I showed\r\nsoon after the discovery of the _scent-scales_. This is the case in\r\nthe males; the females have no _special_ scent-scales recognisable as\r\nsuch by their form, but they must, nevertheless, give off an extremely\r\ndelicate fragrance, although our imperfect organ of smell cannot\r\nperceive it, for the males become aware of the presence of a female,\r\neven at night, from a long distance off, and gather round her. We may\r\ntherefore conclude, that both sexes have long given forth a very\r\ndelicate perfume, which announced their presence to others of the same\r\nspecies, and that in many species (_not in all_) these small\r\nbeginnings become, in the males, particularly strong scent-scales of\r\ncharacteristic form (lute, brush, or lyre-shaped). At first these\r\nscales were scattered over the surface of the wing, but gradually they\r\nconcentrated themselves, and formed broad, velvety bands, or strong,\r\nprominent brushes, and they attained their highest pitch of evolution\r\nwhen they became enclosed within pits or folds of the skin, which\r\ncould be opened to let the delicious fragrance stream forth suddenly\r\ntowards the female. Thus in this case also we see that characters, the\r\noriginal use of which was to bring the sexes together, and so to\r\nmaintain the species, have been evolved in the males into means for\r\nexciting the female. And we can hardly doubt, that the females are\r\nmost readily enticed to yield to the butterfly that sends out the\r\nstrongest fragrance,--that is to say, that excites them to the highest\r\ndegree. It is a pity that our organs of smell are not fine enough to\r\nexamine the fragrance of male Lepidoptera in general, and to compare\r\nit with other perfumes which attract these insects.[43] As far as we\r\ncan perceive them they resemble the fragrance of flowers, but there\r\nare Lepidoptera whose scent suggests musk. A smell of musk is also\r\ngiven off by several plants: it is a sexual excitant in the\r\nmusk-deer, the musk-sheep, and the crocodile.\r\n\r\nAs far as we know, then, it is perfumes similar to those of flowers\r\nthat the male Lepidoptera give off in order to entice their mates and\r\nthis is a further indication that animals, like plants, can to a large\r\nextent meet the claims made upon them by life, and produce the\r\nadaptations which are most purposive,--a further proof, too, of my\r\nproposition that the useful variations, so to speak, are _always\r\nthere_. The flowers developed the perfumes which entice their\r\nvisitors, and the male Lepidoptera developed the perfumes which entice\r\nand excite their mates.\r\n\r\nThere are many pretty little problems to be solved in this connection,\r\nfor there are insects, such as some flies, that are attracted by\r\nsmells which are unpleasant to us, like those from decaying flesh and\r\ncarrion. But there are also certain flowers, some orchids for\r\ninstance, which give forth no very agreeable odour, but one which is\r\nto us repulsive and disgusting; and we should therefore expect that\r\nthe males of such insects would give off a smell unpleasant to us, but\r\nthere is no case known to me in which this has been demonstrated.\r\n\r\nIn cases such as we have discussed, it is obvious that there is no\r\npossible explanation except through selection. This brings us to the\r\nlast kind of secondary sexual characters, and the one in regard to\r\nwhich doubt has been most frequently expressed,--decorative colours\r\nand decorative forms, the brilliant plumage of the male pheasant, the\r\nhumming-birds, and the bird of Paradise, as well as the bright colours\r\nof many species of butterfly, from the beautiful blue of our little\r\nLycaenidae to the magnificent azure of the large Morphinae of Brazil.\r\nIn a great many cases, though not by any means in all, the male\r\nbutterflies are \"more beautiful\" than the females, and in the Tropics\r\nin particular they shine and glow in the most superb colours. I really\r\nsee no reason why we should doubt the power of sexual selection, and I\r\nmyself stand wholly on Darwin's side. Even though we certainly cannot\r\nassume that the females exercise a conscious choice of the\r\n\"handsomest\" mate, and deliberate like the judges in a court of\r\njustice over the perfections of their wooers, we have no reason to\r\ndoubt that distinctive forms (decorative feathers), and colours have a\r\nparticularly exciting effect upon the female, just as certain odours\r\nhave among animals of so many different groups, including the\r\nbutterflies. The doubts which existed for a considerable time, as a\r\nresult of fallacious experiments, as to whether the colours of flowers\r\nreally had any influence in attracting butterflies have now been set\r\nat rest through a series of more careful investigations; we now know\r\nthat the colours of flowers are there on account of the butterflies,\r\nas Sprengel first showed, and that the blossoms of Phanerogams are\r\nselected in relation to them, as Darwin pointed out.\r\n\r\nCertainly it is not possible to bring forward any convincing proof of\r\nthe origin of decorative colours through sexual selection, but there\r\nare many weighty arguments in favour of it, and these form a body of\r\npresumptive evidence so strong that it almost amounts to certainty.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, there is the analogy with other secondary sexual\r\ncharacters. If the song of birds and the chirping of the cricket have\r\nbeen evolved through sexual selection, if the penetrating odours of\r\nmale animals,--the crocodile, the musk-deer, the beaver, the\r\ncarnivores, and, finally, the flower-like fragrances of the\r\nbutterflies have been evolved to their present pitch in this way, why\r\nshould decorative colours have arisen in some other way? Why should\r\nthe eye be less sensitive to _specifically male_ colours and other\r\n_visible_ signs _enticing to the female_, than the olfactory sense to\r\nspecifically male odours, or the sense of hearing to specifically male\r\nsounds? Moreover, the decorative feathers of birds are almost always\r\nspread out and displayed before the female during courtship. I have\r\nelsewhere[44] pointed out that decorative colouring and\r\nsweet-scentedness may replace one another in Lepidoptera as well as in\r\nflowers, for just as some modestly coloured flowers (mignonette and\r\nviolet) have often a strong perfume, while strikingly coloured ones\r\nare sometimes quite devoid of fragrance, so we find that the most\r\nbeautiful and gaily-coloured of our native Lepidoptera, the species of\r\nVanessa, have no scent-scales, while these are often markedly\r\ndeveloped in grey nocturnal Lepidoptera. Both attractions may,\r\nhowever, be combined in butterflies, just as in flowers. Of course, we\r\ncannot explain why both means of attraction should exist in one genus,\r\nand only one of them in another, since we do not know the minutest\r\ndetails of the conditions of life of the genera concerned. But from\r\nthe sporadic distribution of scent-scales in Lepidoptera, and from\r\ntheir occurrence or absence in nearly related species, we may conclude\r\nthat fragrance is a relatively _modern_ acquirement, more recent than\r\nbrilliant colouring.\r\n\r\nOne thing in particular that stamps decorative colouring as a product\r\nof selection is _its gradual intensification_ by the addition of new\r\nspots, which we can quite well observe, because in many cases the\r\ncolours have been first acquired by the males, and later transmitted\r\nto the females by inheritance. The scent-scales are never thus\r\ntransmitted, probably for the same reason that the decorative colours\r\nof many birds are often not transmitted to the females: because with\r\nthese they would be exposed to too great elimination by enemies.\r\nWallace was the first to point out that in species with concealed\r\nnests the beautiful feathers of the male occurred in the female also,\r\nas in the parrots, for instance, but this is not the case in species\r\nwhich brood on an exposed nest. In the parrots one can often observe\r\nthat the general brilliant colouring of the male is found in the\r\nfemale, but that certain spots of colour are absent, and these have\r\nprobably been acquired comparatively recently by the male and have not\r\nyet been transmitted to the female.\r\n\r\nIsolation of the group of individuals which is in process of varying\r\nis undoubtedly of great value in sexual selection, for even a solitary\r\nconspicuous variation will become dominant much sooner in a small\r\nisolated colony, than among a large number of members of a species.\r\n\r\nAny one who agrees with me in deriving variations from germinal\r\nselection will regard that process as an essential aid towards\r\nexplaining the selection of distinctive courtship-characters, such as\r\ncoloured spots, decorative feathers, horny outgrowths in birds and\r\nreptiles, combs, feather-tufts, and the like, since the beginnings of\r\nthese would be presented with relative frequency in the struggle\r\nbetween the determinants within the germ-plasm. The process of\r\ntransmission of decorative feathers to the female results, as Darwin\r\npointed out and illustrated by interesting examples, in the\r\n_colour-transformation of a whole species_, and this process, as the\r\nphyletically older colouring of young birds shows, must, in the course\r\nof thousands of years, have repeated itself several times in a line of\r\ndescent.\r\n\r\nIf we survey the wealth of phenomena presented to us by secondary\r\nsexual characters, we can hardly fail to be convinced of the truth of\r\nthe principle of sexual selection. And certainly no one who has\r\naccepted natural selection should reject sexual selection, for, not\r\nonly do the two processes rest upon the same basis, but they merge\r\ninto one another, so that it is often impossible to say how much of a\r\nparticular character depends on one and how much on the other form of\r\nselection.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_b_) _Natural Selection_\r\n\r\nAn actual proof of the theory of sexual selection is out of the\r\nquestion, if only because we cannot tell when a variation attains to\r\nselection-value. It is certain that a delicate sense of smell is of\r\nvalue to the male moth in his search for the female, but whether the\r\npossession of one additional olfactory hair, or of ten, or of twenty\r\nadditional hairs leads to the success of its possessor we are unable\r\nto tell. And we are groping even more in the dark when we discuss the\r\nexcitement caused in the female by agreeable perfumes, or by striking\r\nand beautiful colours. That these do make an impression is beyond\r\ndoubt; but we can only assume that slight intensifications of them\r\ngive any advantage, and we _must_ assume this _since otherwise\r\nsecondary sexual characters remain inexplicable_.\r\n\r\nThe same thing is true in regard to natural selection. It is not\r\npossible to bring forward any actual proof of the selection-value of\r\nthe initial stages, and the stages in the increase of variations, as\r\nhas been already shown. But the selection-value of a finished\r\nadaptation can in many cases be statistically determined. Cesnola and\r\nPoulton have made valuable experiments in this direction. The former\r\nattached forty-five individuals of the green, and sixty-five of the\r\nbrown variety of the praying mantis (_Mantis religiosa_), by a silk\r\nthread to plants, and watched them for seven days. The insects which\r\nwere on a surface of a colour Similar to their own remained uneaten,\r\nwhile twenty-five green insects on brown parts of plants had all\r\ndisappeared in eleven days.\r\n\r\nThe experiments of Poulton and Sanders[45] were made with 600 pupae of\r\n_Vanessa urticae_, the \"tortoise-shell butterfly.\" The pupae were\r\nartificially attached to nettles, tree-trunks, fences, walls, and to\r\nthe ground, some at Oxford, some at St. Helens in the Isle of Wight.\r\nIn the course of a month 93% of the pupae at Oxford were killed,\r\nchiefly by small birds, while at St. Helens 68% perished. The\r\nexperiments showed very clearly that the colour and character of the\r\nsurface on which the pupa rests--and thus its own conspicuousness--are\r\nof the greatest importance. At Oxford only the four pupae which were\r\nfastened to nettles emerged; all the rest--on bark, stones and the\r\nlike--perished. At St. Helens the elimination was as follows: on\r\nfences where the pupae were conspicuous, 92%; on bark, 66%; on walls,\r\n54%; and among nettles, 57%. These interesting experiments confirm our\r\nviews as to protective coloration, and show further, _that the ratio\r\nof elimination in the species is a very high one, and that therefore\r\nselection must be very keen_.\r\n\r\nWe may say that the process of selection follows as a logical\r\nnecessity from the fulfilment of the three preliminary postulates of\r\nthe theory: variability, heredity, and the struggle for existence,\r\nwith its enormous ratio of elimination in all species. To this we must\r\nadd a fourth factor, the _intensification_ of variations which Darwin\r\nestablished as a fact, and which we are now able to account for\r\ntheoretically on the basis of germinal selection. It may be objected\r\nthat there is considerable uncertainty about this _logical_ proof,\r\nbecause of our inability to demonstrate the selection-value of the\r\ninitial stages and the individual stages of increase. We have\r\ntherefore to fall back on _presumptive evidence_. This is to be found\r\nin _the interpretative value of the theory_. Let us consider this\r\npoint in greater detail.\r\n\r\nIn the first place it is necessary to emphasize what is often\r\noverlooked, namely, that the theory not only explains the\r\n_transformations_ of species, it also explains _their remaining the\r\nsame_; in addition to the principle of varying, it contains within\r\nitself that of _persisting_. It is part of the essence of selection,\r\nthat it not only causes a part to _vary_ till it has reached its\r\nhighest pitch of adaptation, but that it _maintains it at this pitch.\r\nThis conserving influence of natural selection_ is of great\r\nimportance, and was early recognised by Darwin; it follows naturally\r\nfrom the principle of the survival of the fittest.\r\n\r\nWe understand from this how it is that a species which has become\r\nfully adapted to certain conditions of life ceases to vary, but\r\nremains \"constant,\" as long as the conditions of life _for_ it remain\r\nunchanged, whether this be for thousands of years, or for whole\r\ngeological epochs. But the most convincing proof of the power of the\r\nprinciple of selection lies in the innumerable multitude of phenomena\r\nwhich cannot be explained in any other way. To this category belong\r\nall structures which are only _passively_ of advantage to the\r\norganism, because none of these can have arisen by the alleged\r\n_Lamarckian principle_. These have been so often discussed that we\r\nneed do no more than indicate them here. Until quite recently the\r\nsympathetic coloration of animals--for instance, the whiteness of\r\nArctic animals--was referred, at least in part, to the _direct_\r\ninfluence of external factors, but the facts can best be explained by\r\nreferring them to the processes of selection, for then it is\r\nunnecessary to make the gratuitous assumption that many species are\r\nsensitive to the stimulus of cold and that others are not. The great\r\nmajority of Arctic land-animals, mammals and birds, are white, and\r\nthis proves that they were all able to present the variation which was\r\nmost useful for them. The sable is brown, but it lives in trees, where\r\nthe brown colouring protects and conceals it more effectively. The\r\nmusk-sheep (_Ovibos moschatus_) is also brown, and contrasts sharply\r\nwith the ice and snow, but it is protected from beasts of prey by its\r\ngregarious habit, and therefore it is of advantage to be visible from\r\nas great a distance as possible. That so many species have been able\r\nto give rise to white varieties does not depend on a special\r\nsensitiveness of the skin to the influence of cold, but to the fact\r\nthat Mammals and Birds have a general tendency to vary towards white.\r\nEven with us, many birds--starlings, blackbirds, swallows,\r\netc.--occasionally produce white individuals, but the white variety\r\ndoes not persist, because it readily falls a victim to the carnivores.\r\nThis is true of white fawns, foxes, deer, etc. The whiteness,\r\ntherefore, arises from internal causes, and only persists when it is\r\nuseful. A great many animals living in a _green environment_ have\r\nbecome clothed in green, especially insects, caterpillars, and\r\nMantidae, both persecuted and persecutors.\r\n\r\nThat it is not the direct effect of the environment which calls forth\r\nthe green colour is shown by the many kinds of caterpillar which rest\r\non leaves and feed on them, but are nevertheless brown. These feed by\r\nnight and betake themselves through the day to the trunk of the tree,\r\nand hide in the furrows of the bark. We cannot, however, conclude\r\nfrom this that they were _unable_ to vary towards green, for there are\r\nArctic animals which are white only in winter and brown in summer\r\n(Alpine hare, and the ptarmigan of the Alps), and there are also green\r\nleaf-insects which remain green only while they are young and\r\ndifficult to see on the leaf, but which become brown again in the last\r\nstage of larval life, when they have outgrown the leaf. They then\r\nconceal themselves by day, sometimes only among withered leaves on the\r\nground, sometimes in the earth itself. It is interesting that in one\r\ngenus, Chaerocampa, one species is brown in the last stage of larval\r\nlife, another becomes brown earlier, and in many species the last\r\nstage is not wholly brown, a part remaining green. Whether this is a\r\ncase of a double adaptation, or whether the green is being gradually\r\ncrowded out by the brown, the fact remains that the same species, even\r\nthe same individual, can exhibit both variations. The case is the same\r\nwith many of the leaf-like Orthoptera, as, for instance, the praying\r\nmantis (_Mantis religiosa_) which we have already mentioned.\r\n\r\nBut the best proofs are furnished by those of ten-cited cases in which\r\nthe insect bears a deceptive resemblance to another object. We now\r\nknow many such cases, such as the numerous imitations of green or\r\nwithered leaves, which are brought about in the most diverse ways,\r\nsometimes by mere variations in the form of the insect and in its\r\ncolour, sometimes by an elaborate marking, like that which occurs in\r\nthe Indian leaf-butterflies, _Kallima inachis_. In the single\r\nbutterfly-genus Anaea, in the woods of South America, there are about\r\na hundred species which are all gaily coloured on the upper surface,\r\nand on the reverse side exhibit the most delicate imitation of the\r\ncolouring and pattern of a leaf, generally without any indication of\r\nthe leaf-ribs, but extremely deceptive nevertheless. Anyone who has\r\nseen only one such butterfly may doubt whether many of the\r\ninsignificant details of the marking can really be of advantage to the\r\ninsect. Such details are for instance the apparent holes and splits\r\nin the apparently dry or half-rotten leaf, which are usually due to\r\nthe fact that the scales are absent on a circular or oval patch so\r\nthat the colourless wing-membrane lies bare, and one can look through\r\nthe spot as through a window. Whether the bird which is seeking or\r\npursuing the butterflies takes these holes for dewdrops, or for the\r\nwork of a devouring insect, does not affect the question; the\r\nmirror-like spot undoubtedly increases the general deceptiveness, for\r\nthe same thing occurs in many leaf-butterflies, though not in all, and\r\nin some cases it is replaced in quite a peculiar manner. In one\r\nspecies of Anaea (_A. divina_), the resting butterfly looks exactly\r\nlike a leaf out of the outer edge of which a large semi-circular piece\r\nhas been eaten, possibly by a caterpillar; but if we look more closely\r\nit is obvious that there is no part of the wing absent, and that the\r\nsemi-circular piece is of a clear, pale yellow colour, while the rest\r\nof the wing is of a strongly contrasted dark brown.\r\n\r\nBut the deceptive resemblance may be caused in quite a different\r\nmanner. I have often speculated as to what advantage the brilliant\r\nwhite C could give to the otherwise dusky-coloured \"Comma butterfly\"\r\n(_Grapta C. album_). Poulton's recent observations[46] have shown that\r\nthis represents the imitation of a crack such as is often seen in dry\r\nleaves, and is very conspicuous because the light shines through it.\r\n\r\nThe utility obviously lies in presenting to the bird the very familiar\r\npicture of a broken leaf with a clear shining slit, and we may\r\nconclude, from the imitation of such small details, that the birds are\r\nvery sharp observers and that the smallest deviation from the usual\r\narrests their attention and incites them to closer investigation. It\r\nis obvious that such detailed--we might almost say such\r\nsubtle--deceptive resemblances could only have come about in the\r\ncourse of long ages through the acquirement from time to time of\r\nsomething new which heightened the already existing resemblance.\r\n\r\nIn face of facts like these there can be no question of chance and no\r\none has succeeded so far in finding any other explanation to replace\r\nthat by selection. For the rest, the apparent leaves are by no means\r\nperfect copies of a leaf; many of them only represent the torn or\r\nbroken piece, or the half or two-thirds of a leaf, but then the leaves\r\nthemselves frequently do not present themselves to the eye as a whole,\r\nbut partially concealed among other leaves. Even those butterflies\r\nwhich, like the species of Kallima and Anaea, represent the whole of a\r\nleaf with stalk, ribs, apex, and the whole breadth, are not actual\r\ncopies which would satisfy a botanist; there is often much wanting. In\r\nKallima the lateral ribs of the leaf are never all included in the\r\nmarkings; there are only two or three on the left side and at more\r\nfour or five on the right, and in many individuals these are rather\r\nobscure, while in others they are comparatively distinct. This\r\nfurnishes us with fresh evidence in favour of their origin through\r\nprocesses of selection, for a botanically perfect picture could not\r\narise in this way; there could only be a fixing of such details as\r\nheightened the deceptive resemblance.\r\n\r\nOur postulate of origin through selection also enables us to\r\nunderstand why the leaf-imitation is on the lower surface of the wing\r\nin the diurnal Lepidoptera, and on the upper surface in the nocturnal\r\nforms, corresponding to the attitude of the wings in the resting\r\nposition of the two groups.\r\n\r\nThe strongest of all proofs of the theory, however, is afforded by\r\ncases of true \"mimicry,\" those adaptations discovered by Bates in\r\n1861, consisting in the imitation of one species by another, which\r\nbecomes more and more like its model. The model is always a species\r\nthat enjoys some special protection from enemies, whether because it\r\nis unpleasant to taste, or because it is in some way dangerous.\r\n\r\nIt is chiefly among insects and especially among butterflies that we\r\nfind the greatest number of such cases. Several of these have been\r\nminutely studied and every detail has been investigated so that it is\r\ndifficult to understand how there can still be disbelief in regard to\r\nthem. If the many and exact observations which have been carefully\r\ncollected and critically discussed for instance by Poulton[47] were\r\nthoroughly studied the arguments which are still frequently urged\r\nagainst mimicry would be found untenable; we can hardly hope to find\r\nmore convincing proof of the actuality of the processes of selection\r\nthan these cases put into our hands. The preliminary postulates of the\r\ntheory of mimicry have been disputed, for instance, that diurnal\r\nbutterflies are persecuted and eaten by birds, but observations\r\nspecially directed towards this point in India, Africa, America and\r\nEurope have placed it beyond all doubt. If it were necessary I could\r\nmyself furnish an account of my own observations on this point.\r\n\r\nIn the same way it has been established by experiment and observation\r\nin the field that in all the great regions of distribution there are\r\nbutterflies which are rejected by birds and lizards, their chief\r\nenemies, on account of their unpleasant smell or taste. These\r\nbutterflies are usually gaily and conspicuously coloured and thus--as\r\nWallace first interpreted it--are furnished with an easily\r\nrecognisable sign: a sign of unpalatableness or _warning colours_. If\r\nthey were not thus recognisable easily and from a distance, they would\r\nfrequently be pecked at by birds, and then rejected because of their\r\nunpleasant taste; but as it is, the insect-eaters recognise them at\r\nonce as unpalatable booty and ignore them. Such _immune_[48] species,\r\nwherever they occur, are imitated by other palatable species, which\r\nthus acquire a certain degree of protection.\r\n\r\nIt is true that this explanation of the bright, conspicuous colours\r\nis only a hypothesis, but its foundations--unpalatableness, and the\r\nliability of other butterflies to be eaten,--are certain, and its\r\nconsequences--the existence of mimetic palatable forms--conform it in\r\nthe most convincing manner. Of the many cases now known I select one,\r\nwhich is especially remarkable, and which has been thoroughly\r\ninvestigated, _Papilla dardanus_ (_merope_), a large, beautiful,\r\ndiurnal butterfly which ranges from Abyssinia throughout the whole of\r\nAfrica to the south coast of Cape Colony.\r\n\r\nThe males of this form are everywhere _almost_ the same in colour and\r\nin form of wings, save for a few variations in the sparse black\r\nmarkings on the pale yellow ground. But the females occur in several\r\nquite different forms and colourings, and one of these only, the\r\nAbyssinian form, is like the male, while the other three or four are\r\n_mimetic_, that is to say, they copy a butterfly of quite a different\r\nfamily the Danaids, which are among the _immune_ forms. In each region\r\nthe females have thus copied two or three different immune species.\r\nThere is much that is interesting to be said in regard to these\r\nspecies, but it would be out of keeping with the general tenor of this\r\npaper to give details of this very complicated case of polymorphism in\r\n_P. Dardanus_. Anyone who is interested in the matter will find a full\r\nand exact statement of the case in as far as we know it, in Poulton's\r\n_Essays on Evolution_ (pp. 373-375[49]). I need only add that three\r\ndifferent mimetic female forms have been reared from the eggs of a\r\nsingle female in South Africa. The resemblance of the forms to their\r\nimmune models goes so far that even the details of the _local_ forms\r\nof the models are copied by the mimetic species.\r\n\r\nIt remains to be said that in Madagascar a butterfly,\r\n\r\n_Papilio meriones_, occurs, of which both sexes are very similar in\r\nform and markings to the non-mimetic male of _P. dardanus_, so that it\r\nprobably represents the ancestor of this latter species.\r\n\r\nIn face of such facts as these every attempt at another explanation\r\nmust fail. Similarly all the other details of the case fulfil the\r\npreliminary postulates of selection, and leave no room for any other\r\ninterpretation. That the males do not take on the protective colouring\r\nis easily explained, because they are in general more numerous, and\r\nthe females are more important for the preservation of the species,\r\nand must also live longer in order to deposit their eggs. We find the\r\nsame state of things in many other species, and in one case (_Elymnias\r\nundularis_) in which the male is also mimetically coloured, it copies\r\nquite a differently coloured immune species from the model followed by\r\nthe female. This is quite intelligible when we consider that if there\r\nwere _too many_ false immune types, the birds would soon discover that\r\nthere were palatable individuals among those with unpalatable warning\r\ncolours. Hence the imitation of different immune species by _Papilio\r\ndardanus_!\r\n\r\nI regret that lack of space prevents my bringing forward more examples\r\nof mimicry and discussing them fully. But from the case of _Papilio\r\ndardanus_ alone there is much to be learnt which is of the highest\r\nimportance for our understanding of transformations. It shows us\r\nchiefly what I once called, somewhat strongly perhaps, _the\r\nomnipotence of natural selection_ in answer to an opponent who had\r\nspoken of its \"inadequacy.\" We here see that one and the same species\r\nis capable of producing four or five different patterns of colouring\r\nand marking; thus the colouring and marking are not, as has often been\r\nsupposed, a necessary outcome of the specific nature of the species,\r\nbut a true adaptation, which cannot arise as a direct effect of\r\nclimatic conditions, but solely through what I may call the sorting\r\nout of the variations produced by the species, according to their\r\nutility. That caterpillars may be either green or brown is already\r\nsomething more than could have been expected according to the old\r\nconception of species, but that one and the same butterfly should be\r\nnow pale yellow, with black; now red with black and pure white; now\r\ndeep black with large, pure white spots; and again black with a large\r\nocheous-yellow spot, and many small white and yellow spots; that in\r\none sub-species it may be tailed like the ancestral form, and in\r\nanother tailless like its Danaid model,--all this shows a far-reaching\r\ncapacity for variation and adaptation that we could never have\r\nexpected if we did not see the facts before us. How it is possible\r\nthat the primary colour-variations should thus be intensified and\r\ncombined remains a puzzle even now; we are reminded of the modern\r\nthree-colour printing,--perhaps similar combinations of the primary\r\ncolours take place in this case; in any case the direction of these\r\nprimary variations is determined by the artist whom we know as natural\r\nselection, for there is no other conceivable way in which the model\r\ncould affect the butterfly that is becoming more and more like it. The\r\nsame climate surrounds all four forms of female; they are subject to\r\nthe same conditions of nutrition. Moreover, _Papilio dardanus_ is by\r\nno means the only species of butterfly which exhibits different kinds\r\nof colour-pattern on its wings. Many species of the Asiatic genus\r\nElymnias have on the upper surface a very good imitation of an immune\r\nEuploeine (Danainae), often with a steel-blue ground-colour, while the\r\nunder surface is well concealed when the butterfly is at rest,--thus\r\nthere are two kinds of protective coloration each with a different\r\nmeaning! The same thing may be observed in many non-mimetic\r\nbutterflies, for instance in all our species of Vanessa, in which the\r\nunder side shows a grey-brown or brownish-black protective coloration,\r\nbut we do not yet know with certainty what may be the biological\r\nsignificance of the gaily coloured upper surface.\r\n\r\nIn general it may be said that mimetic butterflies are comparatively\r\nrare species, but there are exceptions, for instance _Limenitis\r\narchippus_ in North America, of which the immune model (_Danaida\r\nplexippus_) also occurs in enormous numbers.\r\n\r\nIn another mimicry-category the imitators are often more numerous than\r\nthe models, namely in the case of the imitation of _dangerous insects_\r\nby harmless species. Bees and wasps are dreaded for their sting, and\r\nthey are copied by harmless flies of the genera Eristalis and Syrphus,\r\nand these mimics often occur in swarms about flowering plants without\r\ndamage to themselves or to their models; they are feared and are\r\ntherefore left unmolested.\r\n\r\nIn regard also to the _faithfulness of the copy_ the facts are quite\r\nin harmony with the theory, according to which the resemblance must\r\nhave arisen and increased _by degrees_. We can recognise this in many\r\ncases, for even now the mimetic species show very _varying degrees of\r\nresemblance_ to their immune model. If we compare, for instance, the\r\nmany different imitators of _Danaida chrysippus_ we find that, with\r\ntheir brownish-yellow ground-colour, and the position and size, and\r\nmore or less sharp limitation of their clear marginal spots, they have\r\nreached very different degrees of nearness to their model. Or compare\r\nthe female of _Elymnias undularis_ with its model _Danaida genutia_;\r\nthere is a general resemblance, but the marking of the Danaida is very\r\nroughly imitated in Elymnias.\r\n\r\nAnother fact that bears out the theory of mimicry is, that even when\r\nthe resemblance in colour-pattern is very great, the _wing-venation_,\r\nwhich is so constant, and so important in determining the systematic\r\nposition of butterflies, is never affected by the variation. The\r\npursuers of the butterfly have no time to trouble about entomological\r\nintricacies.\r\n\r\nI must not pass over a discovery of Poulton's which is of great\r\ntheoretical importance--that mimetic butterflies may reach the same\r\neffect by very different means.[50] Thus the glass-like transparency\r\nof the wing of a certain Ithomiine (Methona) and its Pierine mimic\r\n(_Dismorphia orise_) depends on a diminution in the size of the\r\nscales; in the Danaine genus Itune it is due to the fewness of the\r\nscales and in a third imitator, a moth (_Castnia linus var.\r\nheliconoides_) the glass-like appearance of the wing is due neither to\r\ndiminution nor to absence of scales, but to their absolute\r\ncolourlessness and transparency, and to the fact that they stand\r\nupright. In another moth mimic (Anthomyza) the arrangement of the\r\ntransparent scales is normal. Thus it is not some unknown external\r\ninfluence that has brought about the transparency of the wing in these\r\nfive forms, as has sometimes been supposed. Nor is it a hypothetical\r\n_internal_ evolutionary tendency, for all three vary in a different\r\nmanner. The cause of this agreement can only lie in selection, which\r\npreserves and intensifies in each species the favourable variations\r\nthat present themselves. The great faithfulness of the copy is\r\nastonishing in these cases, for it is not _the whole_ wing which is\r\ntransparent; certain markings are black in colour, and these contrast\r\nsharply with the glass-like ground. It is obvious that the pursuers of\r\nthese butterflies must be very sharp-sighted, for otherwise the\r\nagreement between the species could never have been pushed so far. The\r\nless the enemies see and observe, the more defective must the\r\nimitation be, and if they had been blind, no visible resemblance\r\nbetween the species which required protection could ever have arisen.\r\n\r\nA seemingly irreconcilable contradiction to the mimicry theory is\r\npresented in the following cases, which were known to Bates, who,\r\nhowever, never succeeded in bringing them into line with the principle\r\nof mimicry.\r\n\r\nIn South America there are, as we have already said, many mimics of\r\nthe immune Ithomiinae (or as Bates called them Heliconidae). Among\r\nthese there occur not merely species which are edible, and thus\r\nrequire the protection of a disguise, but others which are rejected on\r\naccount of their unpalatableness. How could the Ithomiine dress have\r\ndeveloped in their case, and of what use is it, since the species\r\nwould in any case be immune? In Eastern Brazil, for instance, there\r\nare four butterflies, which bear a most confusing resemblance to one\r\nanother in colour, marking, and form of wing, and all four are\r\nunpalatable to birds. They belong to four different genera and three\r\nsub-families, and we have to inquire: Whence came this resemblance and\r\nwhat end does it serve? For a long time no satisfactory answer could\r\nbe found, but Fritz Müller,[51] seventeen years after Bates, offered a\r\nsolution to the riddle, when he pointed out that young birds could not\r\nhave an instinctive knowledge of the unpalatableness of the\r\nIthomiines, but must learn by experience which species were edible and\r\nwhich inedible. Thus each young bird must have tasted at least one\r\nindividual of each inedible species and discovered its unpalatability,\r\nbefore it learnt to avoid, and thus to spare the species. But if the\r\nfour species resemble each other very closely the bird will regard\r\nthem all as of the same kind, and avoid them all. Thus there developed\r\na process of selection which resulted in the survival of the\r\nIthomiine-like individuals, and in so great an increase of resemblance\r\nbetween the four species, that they are difficult to distinguish one\r\nfrom another even in a collection. The advantage for the four species,\r\nliving side by side as they do e.g. in Bahia, lies in the fact that\r\nonly one individual from the _mimicry-ring_ (\"inedible association\")\r\nneed be tasted by a young bird, instead of at least four individuals,\r\nas would otherwise be the case. As the number of young birds is great,\r\nthis makes a considerable difference in the ratio of elimination. The\r\nfour Brazilian species are _Lycorea halia_ (Danainae), _Heliconius\r\nnarcaea_ (_eucrate_) (Heliconinae), _Melinaea ethra_, and _Mechanitis\r\nlysimnia_ (Ithomiinae).\r\n\r\nThese interesting mimicry-rings (trusts), which have much significance\r\nfor the theory, have been the subject of numerous and careful\r\ninvestigations, and at least their essential features are now fully\r\nestablished. Müller took for granted, without making any\r\ninvestigations, that young birds only learn by experience to\r\ndistinguish between different kinds of victims. But Lloyd Morgan's[52]\r\nexperiments with young birds proved that this is really the case, and\r\nat the same time furnished an additional argument against the\r\n_Lamarckian principle_.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the mimicry-rings first observed in South America,\r\nothers have been described from Tropical India by Moore, and by\r\nPoulton and Dixey from Africa, and we may expect to learn many more\r\ninteresting facts in this connection. Here again the preliminary\r\npostulates of the theory are satisfied. And how much more that would\r\nlead to the same conclusion might be added!\r\n\r\nAs in the case of mimicry many species have come to resemble one\r\nanother through processes of selection, so we know whole classes of\r\nphenomena in which plants and animals have become adapted to one\r\nanother, and have thus been modified to a considerable degree. I refer\r\nparticularly to the relation between flowers and insects. Darwin has\r\nshown that the originally inconspicuous blossoms of the phanerogams\r\nwere transformed into flowers through the visits of insects, and that,\r\nconversely, several large orders of insects have been gradually\r\nmodified by their association with flowers, especially as regards the\r\nparts of their body actively concerned. Bees and butterflies in\r\nparticular have become what they are through their relation to\r\nflowers. In this case again all that is apparently contradictory to\r\nthe theory can, on closer investigation, be beautifully interpreted in\r\ncorroboration of it. Selection can give rise only to what is of use to\r\nthe organism actually concerned, never to what is of use to some other\r\norganism, and we must therefore expect to find that in flowers only\r\ncharacters of use to _themselves_ have arisen, never characters which\r\nare of use to insects only, and conversely that in the insects\r\ncharacters useful to them and not merely to the plants would have\r\noriginated. For a long time it seemed as if an exception to this rule\r\nexisted in the case of the fertilisation of the yucca blossoms by a\r\nlittle moth, _Pronuba yuccasella_. This little moth has a\r\nsickle-shaped appendage to its mouth-parts which occurs hi no other\r\nLepidopteron, and which is used for pushing the yellow pollen into the\r\nopening of the pistil, thus fertilising the flower. Thus it appears as\r\nif a new structure, which is useful only to the plant, has arisen in\r\nthe insect. But the difficulty is solved as soon as we learn that the\r\nmoth lays its eggs in the fruit-buds of the Yucca, and that the\r\nlarvae, when they emerge, feed on the developing seeds. In effecting\r\nthe fertilisation of the flower the moth is at the same time making\r\nprovision for its own offspring, since it is only after fertilisation\r\nthat the seeds begin to develop. There is thus nothing to prevent our\r\nreferring this structural adaptation in _Pronuba yuccasella_ to\r\nprocesses of selection, which have gradually transformed the maxillary\r\npalps of the female into the sickle-shaped instrument for collecting\r\nthe pollen, and which have at the same time developed in the insect\r\nthe instinct to press the pollen into the pistil.\r\n\r\nIn this domain, then, the theory of selection finds nothing but\r\ncorroboration, and it would be impossible to substitute for it any\r\nother explanation, which now that the facts are so well known, could\r\nbe regarded as a serious rival to it. That selection is a factor, and\r\na very powerful factor in the evolution of organisms, can no longer be\r\ndoubted. Even although we cannot bring forward formal proofs of it _in\r\ndetail_, cannot calculate definitely the size of the variations which\r\npresent themselves, and their selection-value, cannot, in short,\r\nreduce the whole process to a mathematical formula, yet we must assume\r\nselection, because it is the only possible explanation applicable to\r\nwhole classes of phenomena, and because, on the other hand, it is made\r\nup of factors which we know can be proved actually to exist, and\r\nwhich, _if_ they exist, must of logical necessity coöperate in the\r\nmanner required by the theory. _We must accept it because the\r\nphenomena of evolution and adaptation must have a natural basis, and\r\nbecause it is the only possible explanation of them._[53]\r\n\r\nMany people are willing to admit that selection explains adaptations,\r\nbut they maintain that only a part of the phenomena are thus\r\nexplained, because everything does not depend upon adaptation. They\r\nregard adaptation as, so to speak, a special effort on the part of\r\nNature, which she keeps in readiness to meet particularly difficult\r\nclaims of the external world on organisms. But if we look at the\r\nmatter more carefully we shall find that adaptations are by no means\r\nexceptional, but that they are present everywhere in such enormous\r\nnumbers, that it would be difficult in regard to any structure\r\nwhatever, to prove that adaptation had _not_ played a part in its\r\nevolution.\r\n\r\nHow often has the senseless objection been urged against selection\r\nthat it can create nothing, it can only reject. It is true that it\r\ncannot create either the living substance or the variations of it;\r\nboth must be given. But in rejecting one thing it preserves another,\r\nintensifies it, combines it, and in this way _creates_ what is new.\r\n_Everything_ in organisms depends on adaptation; that is to say,\r\neverything must be admitted through the narrow door of selection,\r\notherwise it can take no part in the building up of the whole. But, it\r\nis asked, what of the direct effect of external conditions,\r\ntemperature, nutrition, climate and the like? Undoubtedly these can\r\ngive rise to variations, but they too must pass through the door of\r\nselection, and if they cannot do this they are rejected, eliminated\r\nfrom the constitution of the species.\r\n\r\nIt may, perhaps, be objected that such external influences are often\r\nof a compelling power, and that every animal must submit to them, and\r\nthat thus selection has no choice and can neither select nor reject.\r\nThere may be such cases; let us assume for instance that the effect\r\nof the cold of the Arctic regions was to make all the mammals become\r\nblack; the result would be that they would all be eliminated by\r\nselection, and that no mammals would be able to live there at all. But\r\nin most cases a certain percentage of animals resists these strong\r\ninfluences, and thus selection secures a foothold on which to work,\r\neliminating the unfavourable variation, and establishing a useful\r\ncolouring, consistent with what is required for the maintenance of the\r\nspecies.\r\n\r\nEverything depends upon adaptation! We have spoken much of adaptation\r\nin colouring, in connection with the examples brought into prominence\r\nby Darwin, because these are conspicuous, easily verified, and at the\r\nsame time convincing for the theory of selection. But is it only\r\ndesert and polar animals whose colouring is determined through\r\nadaptation? Or the leaf-butterflies, and the mimetic species, or the\r\nterrifying markings, and \"warning-colours\" and a thousand other kinds\r\nof sympathetic colouring? It is, indeed, never the colouring alone\r\nwhich makes up the adaptation; the structure of the animal plays a\r\npart, often a very essential part, in the protective disguise, and\r\nthus _many_ variations may cooperate towards _one_ common end. And it\r\nis to be noted that it is by no means only external parts that are\r\nchanged; internal parts are _always_ modified at the same time--for\r\ninstance, the delicate elements of the nervous system on which depend\r\nthe _instinct_ of the insect to hold its wings, when at rest, in a\r\nperfectly definite position, which, in the leaf-butterfly, has the\r\neffect of bringing the two pieces on which the marking occurs on the\r\nanterior and posterior wing into the same direction, and thus\r\ndisplaying as a whole the fine curve of the midrib on the seeming\r\nleaf. But the wing-holding instinct is not regulated in the same way\r\nin all leaf-butterflies; even our indigenous species of Vanessa, with\r\ntheir protective ground-colouring, have quite a distinctive way of\r\nholding their wings so that the greater part of the anterior wing is\r\ncovered by the posterior when the butterfly is at rest. But the\r\nprotective colouring appears on the posterior wing and on the tip of\r\nthe anterior, _to precisely the distance to which it is left\r\nuncovered_. This occurs, as Standfuss has shown, in different degrees\r\nin our two most nearly allied species, the uncovered portion being\r\nsmaller in _V. urticae_ than in _V. polychloros_. In this case, as in\r\nmost leaf-butterflies, the holding of the wing was probably the\r\nprimary character; only after that was thoroughly established did the\r\nprotective marking develop. In any case, the instinctive manner of\r\nholding the wings is associated with the protective colouring, and\r\nmust remain as it is if the latter is to be effective. How greatly\r\ninstincts may change, that is to say, may be adapted, is shown by the\r\ncase of the Noctuid \"shark\" moth, _Xylina vetusta_. This form bears a\r\nmost deceptive resemblance to a piece of rotten wood, and the\r\nappearance is greatly increased by the modification of the innate\r\nimpulse to flight common to so many animals, which has here been\r\ntransformed into an almost contrary instinct. This moth does not fly\r\naway from danger, but \"feigns death,\" that is, it draws antennae, legs\r\nand wings close to the body, and remains perfectly motionless. It may\r\nbe touched, picked up, and thrown down again, and still it does not\r\nmove. This remarkable instinct must surely have developed\r\nsimultaneously with the wood-colouring; at all events, both\r\ncoöperating variations are now present, and prove that both the\r\nexternal and the most minute internal structure have undergone a\r\nprocess of adaptation.\r\n\r\nThe case is the same with all structural variations of animal parts,\r\nwhich are not absolutely insignificant. When the insects acquired\r\nwings they must also have acquired the mechanism with which to move\r\nthem--the musculature, and the nervous apparatus necessary for its\r\nautomatic regulation. All instincts depend upon compound reflex\r\nmechanisms and are just as indispensable as the parts they have to set\r\nin motion, and all may have arisen through processes of selection if\r\nthe reasons which I have elsewhere given for this view are\r\ncorrect.[54]\r\n\r\nThus there is no lack of adaptations within the organism, and\r\nparticularly in its most important and complicated parts, so that we\r\nmay say that there is no actively functional organ that has not\r\nundergone a process of adaptation relative to its function and the\r\nrequirements of the organism. Not only is every gland structurally\r\nadapted, down to the very minutest histological details, to its\r\nfunction, but the function is equally minutely adapted to the needs of\r\nthe body. Every cell in the mucous lining of the intestine is exactly\r\nregulated in its relation to the different nutritive substances, and\r\nbehaves in quite a different way towards the fats, and towards\r\nnitrogenous substances, or peptones.\r\n\r\nI have elsewhere called attention to the many adaptations of the whale\r\nto the surrounding medium, and have pointed out--what has long been\r\nknown, but is not universally admitted, even now--that in it a great\r\nnumber of important organs have been transformed in adaptation to the\r\npeculiar conditions of aquatic life, although the ancestors of the\r\nwhale must have lived, like other hair-covered mammals, on land. I\r\ncited a number of these transformations--the fish-like form of the\r\nbody, the hairlessness of the skin, the transformation of the\r\nfore-limbs to fins, the disappearance of the hind-limbs and the\r\ndevelopment of a tail fin, the layer of blubber under the skin, which\r\naffords the protection from cold necessary to a warm-blooded animal,\r\nthe disappearance of the ear-muscles and the auditory passages, the\r\ndisplacement of the external nares to the forehead for the greater\r\nsecurity of the breathing-hole during the brief appearance at the\r\nsurface, and certain remarkable changes in the respiratory and\r\ncirculatory organs which enable the animal to remain for a long time\r\nunder water. I might have added many more, for the list of adaptations\r\nin the whale to aquatic life is by no means exhausted; they are found\r\nin the histological structure and in the minutest combinations in the\r\nnervous system. For it is obvious that a tail-fin must be used in\r\nquite a different way from a tail, which serves as a fly-brush in\r\nhoofed animals, or as an aid to springing in the kangaroo or as a\r\nclimbing organ; it will require quite different reflex-mechanisms and\r\nnerve combinations in the motor centres.\r\n\r\nI used this example in order to show how unnecessary it is to assume a\r\nspecial internal evolutionary power for the phylogenesis of species,\r\nfor this whole order of whales is, so to speak, _made up of\r\nadaptations_; it deviates in many essential respects from the usual\r\nmammalian type, and all the deviations are adaptations to aquatic\r\nlife. But if precisely the most essential features of the organisation\r\nthus depend upon adaptation, what is left for a phyletic force to do,\r\nsince it is these essential features of the structure it would have to\r\ndetermine? There are few people now who believe in a phyletic\r\nevolutionary power, which is not made up of the forces known to\r\nus--adaptation and heredity--but the conviction that _every_ part of\r\nan organism depends upon adaptation has not yet gained a firm footing.\r\nNevertheless, I must continue to regard this conception as the correct\r\none, as I have long done.\r\n\r\nI may be permitted one more example. The feather of a bird is a\r\nmarvellous structure, and no one will deny that as a whole it depends\r\nupon adaptation. But what part of it _does not_ depend upon\r\nadaptation? The hollow quill, the shaft with its hard, thin, light\r\ncortex, and the spongy substance within it, its square section\r\ncompared with the round section of the quill, the flat barbs, their\r\nshort, hooked barbules which, in the flight-feathers, hook into one\r\nanother with just sufficient firmness to resist the pressure of the\r\nair at each wing-beat, the lightness and firmness of the whole\r\napparatus, the elasticity of the vane, and so on. And yet all this\r\nbelongs to an organ which is only passively functional, and therefore\r\ncan have nothing to do with the _Lamarckian principle_. Nor can the\r\nfeather have arisen through some magical effect of temperature,\r\nmoisture, electricity, or specific nutrition, and thus selection is\r\nagain our only anchor of safety.\r\n\r\nBut--it will be objected--the substance of which the feather consists,\r\nthis peculiar kind of horny substance, did not first arise through\r\nselection in the course of the evolution of the birds, for it formed\r\nthe covering of the scales of their reptilian ancestors. It is quite\r\ntrue that a similar substance covered the scales of the Reptiles, but\r\nwhy should it not have arisen among them through selection? Or in what\r\nother way could it have arisen, since scales are also passively useful\r\nparts? It is true that if we are only to call adaptation what has been\r\nacquired by the species we happen to be considering, there would\r\nremain a great deal that could not be referred to selection; but we\r\nare postulating an evolution which has stretched back through aeons,\r\nand in the course of which innumerable adaptations took place, which\r\nhad not merely ephemeral persistence in a genus, a family or a class,\r\nbut which was continued into whole Phyla of animals, with continual\r\nfresh adaptations to the special conditions of each species, family,\r\nor class, yet with persistence of the fundamental elements. Thus the\r\nfeather, once acquired, persisted in all birds, and the vertebral\r\ncolumn, once gained by adaptation in the lowest forms, has persisted\r\nin all the Vertebrates from Amphioxus upwards, although with constant\r\nreadaptation to the conditions of each particular group. Thus\r\neverything we can see in animals is adaptation, whether of to-day, or\r\nof yesterday, or of ages long gone by; every kind of cell, whether\r\nglandular, muscular, nervous, epidermic, or skeletal, is adapted to\r\nabsolutely definite and specific functions, and every organ which is\r\ncomposed of these different kinds of cells contains them in the proper\r\nproportions, and in the particular arrangement which best serves the\r\nfunction of the organ; it is thus adapted to its function.\r\n\r\nAll parts of the organism are tuned to one another, that is, _they are\r\nadapted to one another_, and in the same way _the organism as a whole\r\nis adapted to the conditions of its life, and it is so at every stage\r\nof its evolution._\r\n\r\nBut all adaptations _can_ be referred to selection; the only point\r\nthat remains doubtful is whether they all _must_ be referred to it.\r\n\r\nHowever that may be, whether the _Lamarckian principle_ is a factor\r\nthat has coöperated with selection in evolution, or whether it is\r\naltogether fallacious, the fact remains, that selection is the cause\r\nof a great part of the phyletic evolution of organisms on our earth.\r\nThose who agree with me in rejecting the _Lamarckian principle_ will\r\nregard selection as the only _guiding_ factor in evolution, which\r\ncreates what is new out of the transmissible variations, by ordering\r\nand arranging these, selecting them in relation to their number and\r\nsize, as the architect does his building-stones so that a particular\r\nstyle must result.[55] But the building-stones themselves, the\r\nvariations, have their basis in the influences which cause variation\r\nin those vital units which are handed on from one generation to\r\nanother, whether, taken together they form the _whole_ organism, as in\r\nBacteria and other low forms of life, or only a germ-substance, as in\r\nunicellular and multicellular organisms.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: _Vorträge über Descendenztheorie_, Jena, 1904, II. 269.\r\nEng.

BATESON, M.A., F.R.S.\r\n\r\n_Professor of Biology in the University of Cambridge_\r\n\r\n\r\nDarwin's work has the property of greatness in that it may be admired\r\nfrom more aspects than one. For some the perception of the principle\r\nof Natural Selection stands out as his most wonderful achievement to\r\nwhich all the rest is subordinate. Others, among whom I would range\r\nmyself, look up to him rather as the first who plainly distinguished,\r\ncollected, and comprehensively studied that new class of evidence from\r\nwhich hereafter a true understanding of the process of Evolution may\r\nbe developed. We each prefer our own standpoint of admiration; but I\r\nthink that it will be in their wider aspect that his labours will most\r\ncommand the veneration of posterity.\r\n\r\nA treatise written to advance knowledge may be read in two moods. The\r\nreader may keep his mind passive, willing merely to receive the\r\nimpress of the writer's thought; or he may read with his attention\r\nstrained and alert, asking at every instant how the new knowledge can\r\nbe used in a further advance, watching continually for fresh footholds\r\nby which to climb higher still. Of Shelley it has been said that he\r\nwas a poet for poets: so Darwin was a naturalist for naturalists. It\r\nis when his writings are used in the critical and more exacting spirit\r\nwith which we test the outfit for our own enterprise that we learn\r\ntheir full value and strength. Whether we glance back and compare his\r\nperformance with the efforts of his predecessors, or look forward\r\nalong the course which modern research is disclosing, we shall honour\r\nmost in him not the rounded merit of finite accomplishment, but the\r\ncreative power by which he inaugurated a line of discovery endless in\r\nvariety and extension. Let us attempt thus to see his work in true\r\nperspective between the past from which it grew, and the present which\r\nis its consequence. Darwin attacked the problem of Evolution by\r\nreference to facts of three classes: Variation; Heredity; Natural\r\nSelection. His work was not as the laity suppose, a sudden and\r\nunheralded revelation, but the first fruit of a long and hitherto\r\nbarren controversy. The occurrence of variation from type, and the\r\nhereditary transmission of such variation had of course been long\r\nfamiliar to practical men, and inferences as to the possible bearing\r\nof those phenomena on the nature of specific difference had been from\r\ntime to time drawn by naturalists. Maupertuis, for example, wrote: \"Ce\r\nqui nous reste à examiner, c'est comment d'un seul individu, il a pu\r\nnaître tant d'espèces si différentes.\" And again: \"La Nature contient\r\nle fonds de toutes ces variétés: mais le hasard ou l'art les mettent\r\nen oeuvre. C'est ainsi que ceux dont l'industrie s'applique à\r\nsatisfaire le goût des curieux, sont, pour ainsi dire, créateurs\r\nd'espèces nouvelles.\"[56]\r\n\r\nSuch passages, of which many (though few so emphatic) can be found in\r\neighteenth century writers, indicate a true perception of the mode of\r\nEvolution. The speculations hinted at by Buffon,[57] developed by\r\nErasmus Darwin, and independently proclaimed above all by Lamarck,\r\ngave to the doctrine of descent a wide renown. The uniformitarian\r\nteaching which Lyell deduced from geological observation had gained\r\nacceptance. The facts of geographical distribution[58] had been shown\r\nto be obviously inconsistent with the Mosaic legend. Prichard, and\r\nLawrence, following the example of Blumenbach, had successfully\r\ndemonstrated that the races of Man could be regarded as different\r\nforms of one species, contrary to the opinion up till then received.\r\nThese treatises all begin, it is true, with a profound obeisance to\r\nthe sons of Noah, but that performed, they continue on strictly modern\r\nlines. The question of the mutability of species was thus prominently\r\nraised.\r\n\r\nThose who rate Lamarck no higher than did Huxley in his contemptuous\r\nphrase \"_buccinator tantum_,\" will scarcely deny that the sound of the\r\ntrumpet had carried far, or that its note was clear. If then there\r\nwere few who had already turned to evolution with positive conviction,\r\nall scientific men must at least have known that such views had been\r\npromulgated; and many must, as Huxley says, have taken up his own\r\nposition of \"critical expectancy.\"[59]\r\n\r\nWhy, then, was it, that Darwin succeeded where the rest had failed?\r\nThe cause of that success was twofold. First, and obviously, in the\r\nprinciple of Natural Selection he had a suggestion which would work.\r\nIt might not go the whole way, but it was true as far as it went.\r\nEvolution could thus in great measure be fairly represented as a\r\nconsequence of demonstrable processes. Darwin seldom endangers the\r\nmechanism he devised by putting on it strains much greater than it can\r\nbear. He at least was under no illusion as to the omnipotence of\r\nSelection; and he introduces none of the forced pleading which in\r\nrecent years has threatened to discredit that principle.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFor example, in the latest text of the _Origin_[60] we find him\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n     \"But as my conclusions have lately been much misrepresented,\r\n     and it has been stated that I attribute the modification of\r\n     species exclusively to natural selection, I may be permitted\r\n     to remark that in the first edition of this work, and\r\n     subsequently, I placed in a most conspicuous\r\n     position--namely, at the close of the Introduction--the\r\n     following words: 'I am convinced that natural selection has\r\n     been the main but not the exclusive means of modification.'\"\r\n\r\nBut apart from the invention of this reasonable hypothesis, which may\r\nwell, as Huxley estimated, \"be the guide of biological and\r\npsychological speculation for the next three or four generations,\"\r\nDarwin made a more significant and imperishable contribution. Not for\r\na few generations, but through all ages he should be remembered as the\r\nfirst who showed clearly that the problems of Heredity and Variation\r\nare soluble by observation, and laid down the course by which we must\r\nproceed to their solution.[61] The moment of inspiration did not come\r\nwith the reading of Malthus, but with the opening of the \"first\r\nnote-book on Transmutation of Species.\"[62] Evolution is a process of\r\nVariation and Heredity. The older writers, though they had some vague\r\nidea that it must be so, did not study Variation and Heredity. Darwin\r\ndid, and so begat not a theory, but a science.\r\n\r\nThe extent to which this is true, the scientific world is only\r\nbeginning to realise. So little was the fact appreciated in Darwin's\r\nown time that the success of his writings was followed by an almost\r\ntotal cessation of work in that special field. Of the causes which led\r\nto these remarkable consequences I have spoken elsewhere. They\r\nproceeded from circumstances peculiar to the time; but whatever the\r\ncauses there is no doubt that this statement of the result is\r\nhistorically exact, and those who make it their business to collect\r\nfacts elucidating the physiology of Heredity and Variation are well\r\naware that they will find little to reward their quest in the leading\r\nscientific Journals of the Darwinian epoch.\r\n\r\nIn those thirty years the original stock of evidence current and in\r\ncirculation even underwent a process of attrition. As in the story of\r\nthe Eastern sage who first wrote the collected learning of the\r\nuniverse for his sons in a thousand volumes and by successive\r\ncompression and burning reduced them to one and from this by further\r\nburning distilled the single ejaculation of the Faith \"There is no god\r\nbut God and Mohammed is the Prophet of God,\" which was all his maturer\r\nwisdom deemed essential:--so in the books of that period do we find\r\nthe _corpus_ of genetic knowledge dwindle to a few prerogative\r\ninstances and these at last to the brief formula of an unquestioned\r\ncreed.\r\n\r\nAnd yet in all else that concerns biological science this period was,\r\nin very truth, our Golden Age, when the natural history of the earth\r\nwas explored as never before; morphology and embryology were\r\nexhaustively ransacked; the physiology of plants and animals began to\r\nrival chemistry and physics in precision of method and in the rapidity\r\nof its advances; and the foundations of pathology were laid.\r\n\r\nIn contrast with this immense activity elsewhere the neglect which\r\nbefel the special physiology of Descent, or Genetics as we now call\r\nit, is astonishing. This may of course be interpreted as meaning that\r\nthe favoured studies seemed to promise a quicker return for effort,\r\nbut it would be more true to say that those who chose these other\r\npursuits did so without making any such comparison; for the idea that\r\nthe physiology of Heredity and Variation was a coherent science,\r\noffering possibilities of extraordinary discovery, was not present to\r\ntheir minds at all. In a word, the existence of such a science was\r\nwell nigh forgotten. It is true that in ancillary periodicals, as for\r\nexample those that treat of entomology or horticulture, or in the\r\nwritings of the already isolated systematists,[63] observations with\r\nthis special bearing were from time to time related, but the class of\r\nfact on which Darwin built his conceptions of Heredity and Variation\r\nwas not seen in the highways of biology. It formed no part of the\r\nofficial curriculum of biological students, and found no place among\r\nthe subjects which their teachers were investigating.\r\n\r\nDuring this period nevertheless one distinct advance was made, that\r\nwith which Weismann's name is prominently connected. In Darwin's\r\ngenetic scheme the hereditary transmission of parental experience and\r\nits consequences played a considerable role. Exactly how great that\r\nrole was supposed to be, he with his habitual caution refrained from\r\nspecifying, for the sufficient reason that he did not know.\r\nNevertheless much of the process of Evolution, especially that by\r\nwhich organs have become degenerate and rudimentary, was certainly\r\nattributed by Darwin to such inheritance, though since belief in the\r\ninheritance of acquired characters fell into dispute, the fact has\r\nbeen a good deal overlooked. The _Origin_ without \"use and disuse\"\r\nwould be a materially different book. A certain vacillation is\r\ndiscernible in Darwin's utterances on this question, and the fact gave\r\nto the astute Butler an opportunity for his most telling attack. The\r\ndiscussion which best illustrates the genetic views of the period\r\narose in regard to the production of the rudimentary condition of the\r\nwings of many beetles in the Madeira group of islands, and by\r\ncomparing passages from the _Origin_[64] Butler convicts Darwin of\r\nsaying first that this condition was in the main the result of\r\nSelection, with disuse aiding, and in another place that the main\r\ncause of degeneration was disuse, but that Selection had aided. To\r\nDarwin however I think the point would have seemed one of dialetics\r\nmerely. To him the one paramount purpose was to show that somehow an\r\nEvolution by means of Variation and Heredity might have brought about\r\nthe facts observed, and whether they had come to pass in the one way\r\nor the other was a matter of subordinate concern.\r\n\r\nTo us moderns the question at issue has a diminished significance. For\r\nover all such debates a change has been brought by Weismann's\r\nchallenge for evidence that use and disuse have any transmitted\r\neffects at all. Hitherto the transmission of many acquired\r\ncharacteristics had seemed to most naturalists so obvious as not to\r\ncall for demonstration.[65] Weismann's demand for facts in support of\r\nthe main proposition revealed at once that none having real cogency\r\ncould be produced. The time-honoured examples were easily shown to be\r\ncapable of different explanations. A few certainly remain which cannot\r\nbe so summarily dismissed, but--though it is manifestly impossible\r\nhere to do justice to such a subject--I think no one will dispute that\r\nthese residual and doubtful phenomena, whatever be their true nature,\r\nare not of a kind to help us much in the interpretation of any of\r\nthose complex cases of adaptation which on the hypothesis of unguided\r\nNatural Selection are especially difficult to understand. Use and\r\ndisuse were invoked expressly to help us over these hard places; but\r\nwhatever changes can be induced in offspring by direct treatment of\r\nthe parents, they are not of a kind to encourage hope of real\r\nassistance from that quarter. It is not to be denied that through the\r\ncollapse of this second line of argument the Selection hypothesis has\r\nhad to take an increased and perilous burden. Various ways of meeting\r\nthe difficulty have been proposed, but these mostly resolve themselves\r\ninto improbable attempts to expand or magnify the powers of Natural\r\nSelection.\r\n\r\nWeismann's interpellation, though negative in purpose, has had a\r\nlasting and beneficial effect, for through his thorough demolition of\r\nthe old loose and distracting notions of inherited experience, the\r\nground has been cleared for the construction of a true knowledge of\r\nheredity based on experimental fact.\r\n\r\nIn another way he made a contribution of a more positive character,\r\nfor his elaborate speculations as to the genetic meaning of\r\ncytological appearances have led to a minute investigation of the\r\nvisible phenomena occurring in those cell-divisions by which\r\ngerm-cells arise. Though the particular views he advocated have very\r\nlargely proved incompatible with the observed facts of heredity, yet\r\nwe must acknowledge that it was chiefly through the stimulus of\r\nWeismann's ideas that those advances in cytology were made; and though\r\nthe doctrine of the continuity of germ-plasm cannot be maintained in\r\nthe form originally propounded, it is in the main true and\r\nilluminating.[66] Nevertheless in the present state of knowledge we\r\nare still as a rule quite unable to connect cytological appearances\r\nwith any genetic consequences and save in one respect (obviously of\r\nextreme importance--to be spoken of later) the two sets of phenomena\r\nmight, for all we can see, be entirely distinct.\r\n\r\nI cannot avoid attaching importance to this want of connection between\r\nthe nuclear phenomena and the features of bodily organisation. All\r\nattempts to investigate Heredity by cytological means lie under the\r\ndisadvantage that it is the nuclear changes which can alone be\r\neffectively observed. Important as they must surely be, I have never\r\nbeen persuaded that the rest of the cell counts for nothing. What we\r\nknow of the behaviour and variability of chromosomes seems in my\r\nopinion quite incompatible with the belief that they alone govern\r\nform, and are the sole agents responsible in heredity.[67]\r\n\r\nIf, then, progress was to be made in Genetics, work of a different\r\nkind was required. To learn the laws of Heredity and Variation there\r\nis no other way than that which Darwin himself followed, the direct\r\nexamination of the phenomena. A beginning could be made by collecting\r\nfortuitous observations of this class, which have often thrown a\r\nsuggestive light, but such evidence can be at best but superficial and\r\nsome more penetrating instrument of research is required. This can\r\nonly be provided by actual experiments in breeding.\r\n\r\nThe truth of these general considerations was becoming gradually clear\r\nto many of us when in 1900 Mendel's work was rediscovered.\r\nSegregation, a phenomenon of the utmost novelty, was thus revealed.\r\nFrom that moment not only in the problem of the origin of species, but\r\nin all the great problems of biology a new era began. So unexpected\r\nwas the discovery that many naturalists were convinced it was untrue,\r\nand at once proclaimed Mendel's conclusions as either altogether\r\nmistaken, or if true, of very limited application. Many fantastic\r\nnotions about the workings of Heredity had been asserted as general\r\nprinciples before: this was probably only another fancy of the same\r\nclass.\r\n\r\nNevertheless those who had a preliminary acquaintance with the facts\r\nof Variation were not wholly unprepared for some such revelation. The\r\nessential deduction from the discovery of segregation was that the\r\ncharacters of living things are dependent on the presence of definite\r\nelements or factors, which are treated as units in the processes of\r\nHeredity. These factors can thus be recombined in various ways. They\r\nact sometimes separately, and sometimes they interact in conduction\r\nwith each other, producing their various effects. All this indicates a\r\ndefiniteness and specific order in heredity, and therefore in\r\nvariation. This order cannot by the nature of the case be dependent on\r\nNatural Selection for its existence, but must be a consequence of the\r\nfundamental chemical and physical nature of living things. The study\r\nof Variation had from the first shown that an orderliness of this kind\r\nwas present. The bodies and the properties of livings things are\r\ncosmic, not chaotic. No matter how low in the scale we go, never do we\r\nfind the slightest hint of a diminution in that all-pervading\r\norderliness, nor can we conceive an organism existing for a moment in\r\nany other state. Moreover not only does this order prevail in normal\r\nforms, but again and again it is to be seen in newly-sprung varieties,\r\nwhich by general consent cannot have been subjected to a prolonged\r\nSelection. The discovery of Mendelian elements admirably coincided\r\nwith and at once gave a rationale of these facts. Genetic Variation is\r\nthen primarily the consequence of additions to, or omissions from, the\r\nstock of elements which the species contains. The further\r\ninvestigation of the species-problem must thus proceed by the\r\nanalytical method which breeding experiments provide.\r\n\r\nIn the nine years which have elapsed since Mendel's clue became\r\ngenerally known, progress has been rapid. We now understand the\r\nprocess by which a polymorphic race maintains its polymorphism. When a\r\nfamily consists of dissimilar members, given the numerical proportions\r\nin which these members are occurring, we can represent their\r\ncomposition symbolically and state what types can be transmitted by\r\nthe various members. The difficulty of the \"swamping effects of\r\ninter-crossing\" is practically at an end. Even the famous puzzle of\r\nsex-limited inheritance is solved, at all events in its more regular\r\nmanifestations, and we know now how it is brought about that the\r\nnormal sisters of a colour-blind man can transmit the colour-blindness\r\nwhile his normal brothers cannot transmit it.\r\n\r\nWe are still only on the fringe of the inquiry. It can be seen\r\nextending and ramifying in many directions. To enumerate these here\r\nwould be impossible. A whole new range of possibilities is being\r\nbrought into view by study of the inter-relations between the simple\r\nfactors. By following up the evidence as to segregation, indications\r\nhave been obtained which can only be interpreted as meaning that when\r\nmany factors are being simultaneously redistributed among the\r\ngerm-cells, certain of them exert what must be described as a\r\nrepulsion upon other factors. We cannot surmise whither this discovery\r\nmay lead.\r\n\r\nIn the new light all the old problems wear a fresh aspect. Upon the\r\nquestion of the nature of Sex, for example, the bearing of Mendelian\r\nevidence is close. Elsewhere I have shown that from several sets of\r\nparallel experiments the conclusion is almost forced upon us that, in\r\nthe types investigated, of the two sexes the female is to be regarded\r\nas heterozygous in sex, containing one unpaired dominant element,\r\nwhile the male is similarly homozygous in the absence of that\r\nelement.[68] It is not a little remarkable that on this point--which\r\nis the only one where observations of the nuclear processes of\r\ngameto-genesis have yet been brought into relation with the visible\r\ncharacteristics of the organisms themselves--there should be\r\ndiametrical opposition between the results of breeding experiments and\r\nthose derived from cytology.\r\n\r\nThose who have followed the researches of the American school will be\r\naware that, after it had been found in certain insects that the\r\nspermatozoa were of two kinds according as they contained or did not\r\ncontain the accessory chromosome, E. B. Wilson succeeded in proving\r\nthat the sperms possessing this accessory body were destined to form\r\n_females_ on fertilisation, while sperms without it form males, the\r\neggs being apparently indifferent. Perhaps the most striking of all\r\nthis series of observations is that lately made by T. H. Morgan,[69]\r\nsince confirmed by von Baehr, that in a Phylloxeran two kinds of\r\nspermatids are formed, respectively with and without an accessory (in\r\nthis case, _double_) chromosome. Of these, only those possessing the\r\naccessory body become functional spermatozoa, the others degenerating.\r\nWe have thus an elucidation of the puzzling fact that in these forms\r\nfertilisation results in the formation of _females_ only. How the\r\nmales are formed--for of course males are eventually produced by the\r\nparthenogenetic females--we do not know.\r\n\r\nIf the accessory body is really to be regarded as bearing the factor\r\nfor femaleness, then in Mendelian terms female is DD and male is DR.\r\nThe eggs are indifferent and the spermatozoa are each male, _or_\r\nfemale. But according to the evidence derived from a study of the\r\nsex-limited descent of certain features in other animals the\r\nconclusion seems equally clear that in them female must be regarded as\r\nDR and male as RR. The eggs are thus each either male or female and\r\nthe spermatozoa are indifferent. How this contradictory evidence is to\r\nbe reconciled we do not yet know. The breeding work concerns fowls,\r\ncanaries, and the Currant moth (_Abraxas grossulariata_). The\r\naccessory chromosome has been now observed in most of the great\r\ndivisions of insects,[70] except, as it happens, Lepidoptera. At first\r\nsight it seems difficult to suppose that a feature apparently so\r\nfundamental as sex should be differently constituted in different\r\nanimals, but that seems at present the least improbable inference. I\r\nmention these two groups of facts as illustrating the nature and\r\nmethods of modern genetic work. We must proceed by minute and specific\r\nanalytical investigation. Wherever we look we find traces of the\r\noperation of precise and specific rules.\r\n\r\nIn the light of present knowledge it is evident that before we can\r\nattack the Species-problem with any hope of success there are vast\r\narrears to be made up. He would be a bold man who would now assert\r\nthat there was no sense in which the term Species might not have a\r\nstrict and concrete meaning in contradistinction to the term Variety.\r\nWe have been taught to regard the difference between species and\r\nvariety as one of degree. I think it unlikely that this conclusion\r\nwill bear the test of further research. To Darwin the question, What\r\nis a variation? presented no difficulties. Any difference between\r\nparent and offspring was a variation. Now we have to be more precise.\r\nFirst we must, as de Vries has shown, distinguish real, genetic,\r\nvariation from _fluctuational_ variations, due to environmental and\r\nother accidents, which cannot be transmitted. Having excluded these\r\nsources of error the variations observed must be expressed in terms of\r\nthe factors to which they are due before their significance can be\r\nunderstood. For example, numbers of the variations seen under\r\ndomestication, and not a few witnessed in nature, are simply the\r\nconsequence of some ingredient being in an unknown way omitted from\r\nthe composition of the varying individual. The variation may on the\r\ncontrary be due to the addition of some new element, but to prove that\r\nit is so is by no means an easy matter. Casual observation is useless,\r\nfor though these latter variations will always be dominants, yet many\r\ndominant characteristics may arise from another cause, namely the\r\nmeeting of complementary factors, and special study of each case in\r\ntwo generations at least is needed before these two phenomena can be\r\ndistinguished.\r\n\r\nWhen such considerations are fully appreciated it will be realised\r\nthat medleys of most dissimilar occurrences are all confused together\r\nunder the term Variation. One of the first objects of genetic analysis\r\nis to disentangle this mass of confusion.\r\n\r\nTo those who have made no study of heredity it sometimes appears that\r\nthe question of the effect of conditions in causing variation is one\r\nwhich we should immediately investigate, but a little thought will\r\nshow that before any critical inquiry into such possibilities can be\r\nattempted, a knowledge of the working of heredity under conditions as\r\nfar as possible uniform must be obtained. At the time when Darwin was\r\nwriting, if a plant brought into cultivation gave off an albino\r\nvariety, such an event was without hesitation ascribed to the change\r\nof life. Now we see that albino _gametes_, germs, that is to say,\r\nwhich are destitute of the pigment-forming factor, may have been\r\noriginally produced by individuals standing an indefinite number of\r\ngenerations back in the ancestry of the actual albino, and it is\r\nindeed almost certain that the variation to which the appearance of\r\nthe albino is due cannot have taken place in a generation later than\r\nthat of the grandparents. It is true that when a new _dominant_\r\nappears we should feel greater confidence that we were witnessing the\r\noriginal variation, but such events are of extreme rarity, and no such\r\ncase has come under the notice of an experimenter in modern times, as\r\nfar as I am aware. That they must have appeared is clear enough.\r\nNothing corresponding to the Brown-breasted Game fowl is known wild,\r\nyet that colour is a most definite dominant, and at some moment since\r\n_Gallus bankiva_ was domesticated, the element on which that special\r\ncolour depends must have at least once been formed in the germ-cell of\r\na fowl; but we need harder evidence than any which has yet been\r\nproduced before we can declare that this novelty came through\r\nover-feeding, or change of climate, or any other disturbance\r\nconsequent on domestication. When we reflect on the intricacies of\r\ngenetic problems as we must now conceive them there come moments when\r\nwe feel almost thankful that the Mendelian principles were unknown to\r\nDarwin. The time called for a bold pronouncement, and he made it, to\r\nour lasting profit and delight. With fuller knowledge we pass once\r\nmore into a period of cautious expectation and reserve.\r\n\r\nIn every arduous enterprise it is pleasanter to look back at\r\ndifficulties overcome than forward to those which still seem\r\ninsurmountable, but in the next stage there is nothing to be stained\r\nby disguising the fact that the attributes of living things are not\r\nwhat we used to suppose. If they are more complex in the sense that\r\nthe properties they display are throughout so regular[71] that the\r\nSelection of minute random variations is an unacceptable account of\r\nthe origin of their diversity, yet by virtue of that very regularity\r\nthe problem is limited in scope and thus simplified.\r\n\r\nTo begin with, we must relegate Selection to its proper place.\r\nSelection permits the viable to continue and decides that the\r\nnon-viable shall perish; just as the temperature of our atmosphere\r\ndecides that no liquid carbon shall be found on the face of the earth:\r\nbut we do not suppose that the form of the diamond has been gradually\r\nachieved by a process of Selection. So again, as the course of descent\r\nbranches in the successive generations, Selection determines along\r\nwhich branch Evolution shall proceed, but it does not decide what\r\nnovelties that branch shall bring forth. \"_La Nature contient le fonds\r\nde toutes ces variétés, mais le hazard ou l'art les mettent en\r\noeuvre_,\" as Maupertuis most truly said.\r\n\r\nNot till knowledge of the genetic properties of organisms has attained\r\nto far greater completeness can evolutionary speculations have more\r\nthan a suggestive value. By genetic experiment, cytology and\r\nphysiological chemistry aiding, we may hope to acquire such knowledge.\r\nIn 1872 Nathusius wrote:[72] \"Das Gesetz der Vererbung ist noch nicht\r\nerkannt; der Apfel ist noch nicht vom Baum der Erkenntniss gefallen,\r\nwelcher, der Sage nach, Newton auf den rechten Weg zur Ergründung der\r\nGravitationsgesetze führte.\" We cannot pretend that the words are not\r\nstill true, but in Mendelian analysis the seeds of that apple-tree at\r\nlast are sown.\r\n\r\nIf we were asked what discovery would do most to forward our inquiry,\r\nwhat one bit of knowledge would more than any other illuminate the\r\nproblem, I think we may give the answer without hesitation. The\r\ngreatest advance that we can foresee will be made when it is found\r\npossible to connect the geometrical phenomena of development with the\r\nchemical. The geometrical symmetry of living things is the key to a\r\nknowledge of their regularity, and the forces which cause it. In the\r\nsymmetry of the dividing cell the basis of that resemblance we call\r\nHeredity is contained. To imitate the morphological phenomena of life\r\nwe have to devise a system which can divide. It must be able to\r\ndivide, and to segment as--grossly--a vibrating plate or rod does, or\r\nas an icicle can do as it becomes ribbed in a continuous stream of\r\nwater; but with this distinction, that the distribution of chemical\r\ndifferences and properties must simultaneously be decided and disposed\r\nin orderly relation to the pattern of the segmentation. Even if a\r\nmodel which would do this could be constructed it might prove to be a\r\nuseful beginning.\r\n\r\nThis may be looking too far ahead. If we had to choose some one piece\r\nof more proximate knowledge which we would more especially like to\r\nacquire, I suppose we should ask for the secret of interracial\r\nsterility. Nothing has yet been discovered to remove the grave\r\ndifficulty, by which Huxley in particular was so much oppressed, that\r\namong the many varieties produced under domestication--which we all\r\nregard as analogous to the species seen in nature--no clear case of\r\ninterracial sterility has been demonstrated. The phenomenon is\r\nprobably the only one to which the domesticated products seem to\r\nafford no parallel. No solution of the difficulty can be offered which\r\nhas positive value, but it is perhaps worth considering the facts in\r\nthe light of modern ideas. It should be observed that we are not\r\ndiscussing incompatibility of two species to produce offspring (a\r\ntotally distinct phenomenon), but the sterility of the offspring which\r\nmany of them do produce.\r\n\r\nWhen two species, both perfectly fertile severally, produce on crossing a\r\nsterile progeny, there is a presumption that the sterility is due to the\r\ndevelopment in the hybrid of some substance which can only be formed by the\r\nmeeting of two complementary factors. That some such account is correct in\r\nessence may be inferred from the well-known observation that if the hybrid\r\nis not totally sterile but only partially so, and thus is able to form some\r\ngood germ-cells which develop into new individuals, the sterility of these\r\ndaughter-individuals is sensibly reduced or may be entirely absent. The\r\nfertility once re-established, the sterility does not return in the later\r\nprogeny, a fact strongly suggestive of segregation. Now if the sterility of\r\nthe cross-bred be really the consequence of the meeting of two\r\ncomplementary factors, we see that the phenomenon could only be produced\r\namong the divergent offspring of one species by the acquisition of at least\r\n_two_ new factors; for if the acquisition of a single factor caused\r\nsterility the line would then end. Moreover each factor must be separately\r\nacquired by distinct individuals, for if both were present together, the\r\npossessors would by hypothesis be sterile. And in order to imitate the case\r\nof species each of these factors must be acquired by distinct breeds. The\r\nfactors need not, and probably would not, produce any other perceptible\r\neffects; they might, like the colour-factors present in white flowers, make\r\nno difference in the form or other characters. Not till the cross was\r\nactually made between the two complementary individuals would either factor\r\ncome into play, and the effects even then might be unobserved until an\r\nattempt was made to breed from the cross-bred.\r\n\r\nNext, if the factors responsible for sterility were acquired, they\r\nwould in all probability be peculiar to certain individuals and would\r\nnot readily be distributed to the whole breed. Any member of the breed\r\nalso into which _both_ the factors were introduced would drop out of\r\nthe pedigree by virtue of its sterility. Hence the evidence that the\r\nvarious domesticated breeds say of dogs or fowls can when mated\r\ntogether produce fertile offspring, is beside the mark. The real\r\nquestion is, Do they ever produce sterile offspring? I think the\r\nevidence is clearly that sometimes they do, oftener perhaps than is\r\ncommonly supposed. These suggestions are quite amenable to\r\nexperimental tests. The most obvious way to begin is to get a pair of\r\nparents which are known to have had any sterile offspring, and to find\r\nthe proportions in which these steriles were produced. If, as I\r\nanticipate, these proportions are found to be definite, the rest is\r\nsimple.\r\n\r\nIn passing, certain other considerations may be referred to. First,\r\nthat there are observations favouring the view that the production of\r\ntotally sterile cross-breds is seldom a universal property of two\r\nspecies, and that it may be a matter of individuals, which is just\r\nwhat on the view here proposed would be expected. Moreover, as we all\r\nknow now, though incompatibility may be dependent to some extent on\r\nthe degree to which the species are dissimilar, no such principle can\r\nbe demonstrated to determine sterility or fertility in general. For\r\nexample, though all our Finches can breed together, the hybrids are\r\nall sterile. Of Ducks some species can breed together without\r\nproducing the slightest sterility; others have totally sterile\r\noffspring, and so on. The hybrids between several _genera_ of Orchids\r\nare perfectly fertile on the female side, and some on the male side\r\nalso, but the hybrids produced between the Turnip (_Brassica napus_)\r\nand the Swede (_Brassica campestris_), which, according to our\r\nestimates of affinity, should be nearly allied forms, are totally\r\nsterile.[73] Lastly, it may be recalled that in sterility we are\r\nalmost certainly considering a meristic phenomenon. _Failure to\r\ndivide_ is, we may feel fairly sure, the immediate \"cause\" of the\r\nsterility. Now, though we know very little about the heredity of\r\nmeristic differences, all that we do know points to the conclusion\r\nthat the less-divided is dominant to the more-divided, and we are thus\r\njustified in supposing that there are factors which can arrest or\r\nprevent cell-division. My conjecture therefore is that in the case of\r\nsterility of cross-breds we see the effect produced by a complementary\r\npair of such factors. This and many similar problems are now open to\r\nour analysis.\r\n\r\nThe question is sometimes asked, Do the new lights on Variation and\r\nHeredity make the process of Evolution easier to understand? On the\r\nwhole the answer may be given that they do. There is some appearance\r\nof loss of simplicity, but the gain is real. As was said above, the\r\ntime is not ripe for the discussion of the origin of species. With\r\nfaith in Evolution unshaken--if indeed the word faith can be used in\r\napplication to that which is certain--we look on the manner and\r\ncausation of adapted differentiation as still wholly mysterious. As\r\nSamuel Butler so truly said: \"To me it seems that the 'Origin of\r\nVariation,' whatever it is, is the only true 'Origin of Species,'\"[74]\r\nand of that Origin not one of us knows anything. But given\r\nVariation--and it is given: assuming further that the variations are\r\nnot guided into paths of adaptation--and both to the Darwinian and to\r\nthe modern school this hypothesis appears to be sound if unproven--an\r\nevolution of species proceeding by definite steps is more, rather than\r\nless, easy to imagine than an evolution proceeding by the accumulation\r\nof indefinite and insensible steps. Those who have lost themselves in\r\ncontemplating the miracles of Adaptation (whether real or spurious)\r\nhave not unnaturally fixed their hopes rather on the indefinite than\r\non the definite changes. The reasons are obvious. By suggesting that\r\nthe steps through which an adaptative mechanism arose were indefinite\r\nand insensible, all further trouble is spared. While it could be said\r\nthat species arise by an insensible and imperceptible process of\r\nvariation, there was clearly no use in tiring ourselves by trying to\r\nperceive that process. This labour-saving counsel found great favour.\r\nAll that had to be done to develop evolution-theory was to discover\r\nthe good in everything, a task which, in the complete absence of any\r\ncontrol or test whereby to check the truth of the discovery, is not\r\nvery onerous. The doctrine \"_que tout est au mieux_\" was therefore\r\npreached with fresh vigour, and examples of that illuminating\r\nprinciple were discovered with a facility that Pangloss himself might\r\nhave envied, till at last even the spectators wearied of such dazzling\r\nperformances.\r\n\r\nBut in all seriousness, why should indefinite and unlimited variation\r\nhave been regarded as a more probable account of the origin of\r\nAdaptation? Only, I think, because the obstacle was shifted one plane\r\nback, and so looked rather less prominent. The abundance of\r\nAdaptation, we all grant, is an immense, almost an unsurpassable\r\ndifficulty in all non-Lamarckian views of Evolution; but if the steps\r\nby which that adaptation arose were fortuitious, to imagine them\r\ninsensible is assuredly no help. In one most important respect indeed,\r\nas has often been observed, it is a multiplication of troubles. For\r\nthe smaller the steps, the less could Natural Selection act upon them.\r\nDefinite variations--and of the occurrence of definite variations in\r\nabundance we have now the most convincing proof--have at least the\r\nobvious merit that they can make and often do make a real difference\r\nin the chances of life.\r\n\r\nThere is another aspect of the Adaptation problem to which I can\r\nallude very briefly. May not our present ideas of the universality and\r\nprecision of Adaptation be greatly exaggerated? The fit of organism to\r\nits environment is not after all so very close--a proposition\r\nunwelcome perhaps, but one which could be illustrated by very copious\r\nevidence. Natural Selection is stern, but she has her tolerant moods.\r\n\r\nWe have now most certain and irrefragable proof that much definiteness\r\nexists in living things apart from Selection, and also much that may\r\nvery well have been preserved and so in a sense constituted by\r\nSelection. Here the matter is likely to rest. There is a passage in\r\nthe sixth edition of the _Origin_ which has I think been overlooked.\r\nOn page 70 Darwin says, \"The tuft of hair on the breast of the wild\r\nturkey-cock cannot be of any use, and it is doubtful whether it can be\r\nornamental in the eyes of the female bird.\" This tuft of hair is a\r\nmost definite and unusual structure, and I am afraid that the remark\r\nthat it \"cannot be of any use\" may have been made inadvertently; but\r\nit may have been intended, for in the first edition the usual\r\nqualification was given and must therefore have been deliberately\r\nexcised. Anyhow I should like to think that Darwin did throw over that\r\ntuft of hair, and that he felt relief when he had done so. Whether\r\nhowever we have his great authority for such a course or not, I feel\r\nquite sure that we shall be rightly interpreting the facts of nature\r\nif we cease to expect to find purposefulness wherever we meet with\r\ndefinite structures or patterns. Such things are, as often as not, I\r\nsuspect rather of the nature of tool-marks, mere incidents of\r\nmanufacture, benefiting their possessor not more than the wire-marks\r\nin a sheet of paper, or the ribbing on the bottom of an oriental plate\r\nrenders those objects more attractive in our eyes.\r\n\r\nIf Variation may be in any way definite, the question once more\r\narises, may it not be definite in direction? The belief that it is has\r\nhad many supporters, from Lamarck onwards, who held that it was guided\r\nby need, and others who, like Nägeli, while laying no emphasis on\r\nneed, yet were convinced that there was guidance of some kind. The\r\nlatter view under the name of \"Orthogenesis,\" devised I believe by\r\nEimer, at the present day commends itself to some naturalists. The\r\nobjection to such a suggestion is of course that no fragment of real\r\nevidence can be produced in its support. On the other hand, with the\r\nexperimental proof that variation consists largely in the unpacking\r\nand repacking of an original complexity, it is not so certain as we\r\nmight like to think that the order of these events is not\r\npredetermined.\r\n\r\nFor instance the original \"pack\" may have been made in such a way that\r\nat the _n_th division of the germ-cells of a Sweet Pea a colour-factor\r\nmight be dropped, and that at the _n_+_n_th division the hooded\r\nvariety be given off, and so on. I see no ground whatever for holding\r\nsuch a view, but in fairness the possibility should not be forgotten,\r\nand in the light of modern research it scarcely looks so absurdly\r\nimprobable as before.\r\n\r\nNo one can survey the work of recent years without perceiving that\r\nevolutionary orthodoxy developed too fast, and that a great deal has\r\ngot to come down; but this satisfaction at least remains, that in the\r\nexperimental methods which Mendel inaugurated, we have means of\r\nreaching certainty in regard to the physiology of Heredity and\r\nVariation upon which a more lasting structure may be built.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 56: _Vénus Physique, contenant deux Dissertations, l'une sur\r\nl'origine des Hommes et des Animaux_; _Et l'autre sur l'origine des\r\nNoirs_, La Haye, 1746, pp. 124 and 129.

I do not clearly understand the sense in\r\nwhich Darwin wrote (Autobiography, _ibid._ I. p. 87): \"It has\r\nsometimes been said that the success of the _Origin_ proved 'that the\r\nsubject was in the air,' or 'that men's minds were prepared for it.' I\r\ndo not think that this is strictly true, for I occasionally sounded\r\nnot a few naturalists, and never happened to come across a single one\r\nwho seemed to doubt about the permanence of species.\" This experience\r\nmay perhaps have been an accident due to Darwin's isolation. The\r\nliterature of the period abounds with indications of \"critical\r\nexpectancy.\" A most interesting expression of that feeling is given in\r\nthe charming account of the \"Early Days of Darwinism\" by Alfred\r\nNewton, _Macmillan's Magazine_, LVII. 1888, p. 241. He tells how in\r\n1858 when spending a dreary summer in Iceland, he and his friend, the\r\nornithologist John Wolley, in default of active occupation, spent\r\ntheir days in discussion. \"Both of us taking a keen interest in\r\nNatural History, it was but reasonable that a question, which in those\r\ndays was always coming up wherever two or more naturalists were\r\ngathered together, should be continually recurring. That question was,\r\n'What is a species?' and connected therewith was the other question,\r\n'How did a species begin?'... Now we were of course fairly well\r\nacquainted with what had been published on these subjects.\" He then\r\nenumerates some of these publications, mentioning among others T.\r\nVernon Wollaston's _Variation of Species_--a work which has in my\r\nopinion never been adequately appreciated. He proceeds: \"Of course we\r\nnever arrived at anything like a solution of these problems, general\r\nor special, but we felt very strongly that a solution ought to be\r\nfound, and that quickly, if the study of Botany and Zoology was to\r\nmake any great advance.\" He then describes how on his return home he\r\nreceived the famous number of the _Linnean Journal_ on a certain\r\nevening. \"I sat up late that night to read it; and never shall I\r\nforget the impression it made upon me. Herein was contained a\r\nperfectly simple solution of all the difficulties which had been\r\ntroubling me for months past.... I went to bed satisfied that a\r\nsolution had been found.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 60: _Origin_, 6th edit. (1882), p. 421.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 61: Whatever be our estimate of the importance of Natural\r\nSelection, in this we all agree. Samuel Butler, the most brilliant,\r\nand by far the most interesting of Darwin's opponents--whose works are\r\nat length emerging from oblivion--in his Preface (1882) to the 2nd\r\nedition of _Evolution, Old and New_, repeats his earlier expression of\r\nhomage to one whom he had come to regard as an enemy: \"To the end of\r\ntime, if the question be asked, 'Who taught people to believe in\r\nEvolution?' the answer must be that it was Mr. Darwin. This is true,\r\nand it is hard to see what palm of higher praise can be awarded to any\r\nphilosopher.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 62: _Life and Letters_, I. pp. 276 and 83.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 63: This isolation of the systematists is the one most\r\nmelancholy sequela of Darwinism. It seems an irony that we should read\r\nin the peroration to the _Origin_ that when the Darwinian view is\r\naccepted \"Systematists will be able to pursue their labours as at\r\npresent; but they will not be incessantly haunted by the shadowy doubt\r\nwhether this or that form be a true species. This, I feel sure, and I\r\nspeak after experience, will be no slight relief.

SCHWALBE\r\n\r\n_Professor of Anatomy in the University of Strassburg_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe problem of the origin of the human race, of the descent of man, is\r\nranked by Huxley in his epoch-making book _Man's Place in Nature_, as\r\nthe deepest with which biology has to concern itself, \"the question of\r\nquestions,\"--the problem which underlies all others. In the same\r\nbrilliant and lucid exposition, which appeared in 1863, soon after the\r\npublication of Darwin's _Origin of Species_, Huxley stated his own\r\nviews in regard to this great problem. He tells us how the idea of a\r\nnatural descent of man gradually grew up in his mind. It was\r\nespecially the assertions of Owen in regard to the total difference\r\nbetween the human and the simian brain that called forth strong\r\ndissent from the great anatomist Huxley, and he easily succeeded in\r\nshowing that Owen's supposed differences had no real existence; he\r\neven established, on the basis of his own anatomical investigations,\r\nthe proposition that the anatomical differences between the Marmoset\r\nand the Chimpanzee are much greater than those between the Chimpanzee\r\nand Man.\r\n\r\nBut why do we thus introduce the study of Darwin's _Descent of Man_,\r\nwhich is to occupy us here, by insisting on the fact that Huxley had\r\ntaken the field in defence of the descent of man in 1863, while\r\nDarwin's book on the subject did not appear till 1871? It is in order\r\nthat we may clearly understand how it happened that from this time\r\nonwards Darwin and Huxley followed the same great aim in the most\r\nintimate association.\r\n\r\nHuxley and Darwin working at the same _Problema maximum_! Huxley\r\nfiery, impetuous, eager for battle, contemptuous of the resistance of\r\na dull world, or energetically triumphing over it. Darwin calm,\r\nweighing every problem slowly, letting it mature thoroughly,--not a\r\nfighter, yet having the greater and more lasting influence by virtue\r\nof his immense mass of critically sifted proofs. Darwin's friend,\r\nHuxley, was the first to do him justice, to understand his nature, and\r\nto find in it the reason why the detailed and carefully considered\r\nbook on the descent of man made its appearance so late. Huxley, always\r\ngenerous, never thought of claiming priority for himself. In\r\nenthusiastic language he tells how Darwin's immortal work, _The Origin\r\nof Species_, first shed light for him on the problem of the descent of\r\nman; the recognition of a _vera causa_ in the transformation of\r\nspecies illuminated his thoughts as with a flash. He was now content\r\nto leave what perplexed him, what he could not yet solve, as he says\r\nhimself, \"in the mighty hands of Darwin.\" Happy in the bustle of\r\nstrife against old and deep-rooted prejudices, against intolerance and\r\nsuperstition, he wielded his sharp weapons on Darwin's behalf; wearing\r\nDarwin's armour he joyously overthrew adversary after adversary.\r\nDarwin spoke of Huxley as his \"general agent.\"[75] Huxley says of\r\nhimself \"I am Darwin's bulldog.\"[76]\r\n\r\nThus Huxley openly acknowledged that it was Darwin's _Origin of\r\nSpecies_ that first set the problem of the descent of man in its true\r\nlight, that made the question of the origin of the human race a\r\npressing one. That this was the logical consequence of his book Darwin\r\nhimself had long felt. He had been reproached with intentionally\r\nshirking the application of his theory to Man. Let us hear what he\r\nsays on this point in his autobiography: \"As soon as I had become, in\r\nthe year 1837 or 1838, convinced that species were mutable\r\nproductions, I could not avoid the belief that man must come under the\r\nsame law. Accordingly I collected notes on the subject for my own\r\nsatisfaction, and not for a long time with any intention of\r\npublishing. Although in the 'Origin of Species' the derivation of any\r\nparticular species is never discussed, yet I thought it best, in order\r\n_that no honourable man should accuse me of concealing my views_,[77]\r\nto add that by the work 'light would be thrown on the origin of man\r\nand his history.' It would have been useless and injurious to the\r\nsuccess of the book to have paraded, without giving any evidence, my\r\nconviction with respect to his origin.\"[78]\r\n\r\nIn a letter written in January, 1860, to the Rev. L. Blomefield,\r\nDarwin expresses himself in similar terms. \"With respect to man, I am\r\nvery far from wishing to obtrude my belief; but I thought it dishonest\r\nto quite conceal my opinion.\"[79]\r\n\r\nThe brief allusion in the _Origin of Species_ is so far from prominent\r\nand so incidental that it was excusable to assume that Darwin had not\r\ntouched upon the descent of man in this work. It was solely the desire\r\nto have his mass of evidence sufficiently complete, solely Darwin's\r\ngreat characteristic of never publishing till he had carefully weighed\r\nall aspects of his subject for years, solely, in short, his most\r\nfastidious scientific conscience that restrained him from challenging\r\nthe world in 1859 with a book in which the theory of the descent of\r\nman was fully set forth. Three years, frequently interrupted by\r\nill-health, were needed for the actual writing of the book:[80] the\r\nfirst edition, which appeared in 1871, was followed in 1874 by a much\r\nimproved second edition, the preparation of which he very reluctantly\r\nundertook.[81]\r\n\r\nThis, briefly, is the history of the work, which, with the _Origin of\r\nSpecies_, marks an epoch in the history of biological sciences--the\r\nwork with which the cautious, peace-loving investigator ventured forth\r\nfrom his contemplative life into the arena of strife and unrest, and\r\nlaid himself open to all the annoyances that deep-rooted belief and\r\nprejudice, and the prevailing tendency of scientific thought at the\r\ntime could devise.\r\n\r\nDarwin did not take this step lightly. Of great interest in this\r\nconnection is a letter written to Wallace on Dec. 22, 1857,[82] in\r\nwhich he says, \"You ask me whether I shall discuss 'man.' I think I\r\nshall avoid the whole subject, as so surrounded with prejudices;\r\nthough I fully admit that it is the highest and most interesting\r\nproblem for the naturalist.\" But his conscientiousness compelled him\r\nto state briefly his opinion on the subject in the _Origin of Species_\r\nin 1859. Nevertheless he did not escape reproaches for having been so\r\nreticent. This is unmistakably apparent from a letter to Fritz Müller\r\ndated Feb. 22 [1869?], in which he says: \"I am thinking of writing a\r\nlittle essay on the Origin of Mankind, as I have been taunted with\r\nconcealing my opinions.\"[83]\r\n\r\nIt might be thought that Darwin behaved thus hesitatingly, and was so\r\nslow in deciding on the full publication of his collected material in\r\nregard to the descent of man, because he had religious difficulties to\r\novercome.\r\n\r\nBut this was not the case, as we can see from his admirable confession\r\nof faith, the publication of which we owe to his son Francis.[84]\r\nWhoever wishes really to understand the lofty character of this great\r\nman should read these immortal lines in which he unfolds to us in\r\nsimple and straightforward words the development of his conception of\r\nthe universe. He describes how, though he was still quite orthodox\r\nduring his voyage round the world on board the _Beagle_, he came\r\ngradually to see, shortly afterwards (1836-1839) that the Old\r\nTestament was no more to be trusted than the Sacred Books of the\r\nHindoos; the miracles by which Christianity is supported, the\r\ndiscrepancies between the accounts in the different Gospels, gradually\r\nled him to disbelieve in Christianity as a divine revelation. \"Thus,\"\r\nhe writes,[85] \"disbelief crept over me at a very slow rate, but was\r\nat last complete. The rate was so slow that I felt no distress.\" But\r\nDarwin was too modest to presume to go beyond the limits laid down by\r\nscience. He wanted nothing more than to be able to go, freely and\r\nunhampered by belief in authority or in the Bible, as far as human\r\nknowledge could lead him. We learn this from the concluding words of\r\nhis chapter on religion \"The mystery of the beginning of all things is\r\ninsoluble by us; and I for one must be content to remain an\r\nAgnostic.\"[86]\r\n\r\nDarwin was always very unwilling to give publicity to his views in\r\nregard to religion. In a letter to Asa Gray on May 22, 1860,[87] he\r\ndeclares that it is always painful to him to have to enter into\r\ndiscussion of religious problems. He had, he said, no intention of\r\nwriting atheistically.\r\n\r\nFinally, let us cite one characteristic sentence from a letter from\r\nDarwin to C. Ridley[88] (Nov. 28, 1878). A clergyman, Dr. Pusey, had\r\nasserted that Darwin had written the _Origin of Species_ with some\r\nrelation to theology. Darwin writes emphatically, \"Many years ago when\r\nI was collecting facts for the 'Origin,' my belief in what is called a\r\npersonal God was as firm as that of Dr. Pusey himself, and as to the\r\neternity of matter I never troubled myself about such insoluble\r\nquestions.\" The expression \"many years ago\" refers to the time of his\r\nvoyage round the world, as has already been pointed out. Darwin means\r\nby this utterance that the views which had gradually developed in his\r\nmind in regard to the origin of species were quite compatible with the\r\nfaith of the Church.\r\n\r\nIf we consider all these utterances of Darwin in regard to religion\r\nand to his outlook on life (Weltanschauung), we shall see at least so\r\nmuch, that religious reflection could in no way have influenced him in\r\nregard to the writing and publishing of his book on _The Descent of\r\nMan_. Darwin had early won for himself freedom of thought, and to this\r\nfreedom he remained true to the end of his life, uninfluenced by the\r\ncustoms and opinions of the world around him.\r\n\r\nDarwin was thus inwardly fortified and armed against the host of\r\ncalumnies, accusations, and attacks called forth by the publication of\r\nthe _Origin of Species_, and to an even greater extent by the\r\nappearance of the _Descent of Man_. But in his defence he could rely\r\non the aid of a band of distinguished auxiliaries of the rarest\r\nability. His faithful confederate, Huxley, was joined by the botanist\r\nHooker, and, after longer resistance, by the famous geologist Lyell,\r\nwhose \"conversion\" afforded Darwin peculiar satisfaction. All three\r\ntook the field with enthusiasm in defence of the natural descent of\r\nman. From Wallace, on the other hand, though he shared with him the\r\nidea of natural selection, Darwin got no support in this matter.\r\nWallace expressed himself in a strange manner. He admitted everything\r\nin regard to the morphological descent of man, but maintained, in a\r\nmystic way, that something else, something of a spiritual nature must\r\nhave been added to what man inherited from his animal ancestors.\r\nDarwin, whose esteem for Wallace was extraordinarily high, could not\r\nunderstand how he could give utterance to such a mystical view in\r\nregard to man; the idea seemed to him so \"incredibly strange\" that he\r\nthought some one else must have added these sentences to Wallace's\r\npaper.\r\n\r\nEven now there are thinkers who, like Wallace, shrink from applying to\r\nman the ultimate consequences of the theory of descent. The idea that\r\nman is derived from ape-like forms is to them unpleasant and\r\nhumiliating.\r\n\r\nSo far I have been depicting the development of Darwin's work on the\r\ndescent of man. In what follows I shall endeavour to give a condensed\r\nsurvey of the contents of the book.\r\n\r\nIt must at once be said that the contents of Darwin's work fall into\r\ntwo parts, dealing with entirely different subjects. _The Descent of\r\nMan_ includes a very detailed investigation in regard to secondary\r\nsexual characters in the animal series, and on this investigation\r\nDarwin founded a new theory, that of sexual selection. With\r\nastonishing patience he gathered together an immense mass of material,\r\nand showed, in regard to Arthropods and Vertebrates, the wide\r\ndistribution of secondary characters, which develop almost exclusively\r\nin the male, and which enable him, on the one hand, to get the better\r\nof his rivals in the struggle for the female by the greater perfection\r\nof his weapons, and, on the other hand, to offer greater allurements\r\nto the female through the higher development of decorative characters,\r\nof song, or of scent-producing glands. The best equipped males will\r\nthus crowd out the less well-equipped in the matter of reproduction,\r\nand thus the relevant characters will be increased and perfected\r\nthrough sexual selection. It is, of course, a necessary assumption\r\nthat these secondary sexual characters may be transmitted to the\r\nfemale, although perhaps in rudimentary form.\r\n\r\nAs we have said, this story of sexual selection takes up a great deal\r\nof space in Darwin's book, and it need only be considered here in so\r\nfar as Darwin applied it to the descent of man. To this latter problem\r\nthe whole of Part I is devoted, while Part III contains a discussion\r\nof sexual selection in relation to man, and a general summary. Part\r\nII treats of sexual selection in general, and may be disregarded in\r\nour present study. Moreover, many interesting details must necessarily\r\nbe passed over in what follows, for want of space.\r\n\r\nThe first part of the _Descent of Man_ begins with an enumeration of\r\nthe proofs of the animal descent of man taken from the structure of\r\nthe human body. Darwin chiefly emphasises the fact that the human body\r\nconsists of the same organs and of the same tissues as those of the\r\nother mammals; he shows also that man is subject to the same diseases\r\nand tormented by the same parasites as the apes. He further dwells on\r\nthe general agreement exhibited by young embryonic forms, and he\r\nillustrates this by two figures placed one above the other, one\r\nrepresenting a human embryo, after Ecker, the other a dog embryo,\r\nafter Bischoff.[89]\r\n\r\nDarwin finds further proofs of the animal origin of man in the reduced\r\nstructures, in themselves extremely variable, which are either\r\nabsolutely useless to their possessors, or of so little use that they\r\ncould never have developed under existing conditions. Of such vestiges\r\nhe enumerates: the defective development of the _panniculus carnosus_\r\n(muscle of the skin) so widely distributed among mammals, the\r\near-muscles, the occasional persistence of the animal ear-point in\r\nman, the rudimentary nictitating membrane (_plica semilunaris_) in the\r\nhuman eye, the slight development of the organ of smell, the general\r\nhairiness of the human body, the frequently defective development or\r\nentire absence of the third molar (the wisdom tooth), the vermiform\r\nappendix, the occasional reappearance of a bony canal (_foramen\r\nsupracondyloideum_) at the lower end of the humerus, the rudimentary\r\ntail of man (the so-called taillessness), and so on. Of these\r\nrudimentary structures the occasional occurrence of the animal\r\near-point in man is most fully discussed. Darwin's attention was\r\ncalled to this interesting structure by the sculptor Woolner. He\r\nfigures such a case observed in man, and also the head of an alleged\r\norang-foetus, the photograph of which he received from Nitsche.\r\n\r\nDarwin's interpretation of Woolner's case as having arisen through a\r\nfolding over of the free edge of a pointed ear has been fully borne\r\nout by my investigations on the external ear.[90] In particular, it\r\nwas established by these investigations that the human foetus, about\r\nthe middle of its embryonic life, possesses a pointed ear somewhat\r\nsimilar to that of the monkey genus Macacus. One of Darwin's\r\nstatements in regard to the head of the orang-foetus must be\r\ncorrected. A _large_ ear with a point is shown in the photograph,[91]\r\nbut it can easily be demonstrated--and Deniker has already pointed\r\nthis out--that the figure is not that of an orang foetus at all, for\r\nthat form has much smaller ears with no point; nor can it be a\r\ngibbon-foetus, as Deniker supposes, for the gibbon ear is also without\r\na point. I myself regard it as that of a Macacus-embryo. But this\r\nmistake, which is due to Nitsche, in no way affects the fact\r\nrecognised by Darwin, that ear-forms showing the point characteristic\r\nof the animal ear occur in man with extraordinary frequency.\r\n\r\nFinally, there is a discussion of those rudimentary structures which\r\noccur only in _one_ sex, such as the rudimentary mammary glands in the\r\nmale, the vesicula prostatica, which corresponds to the uterus of the\r\nfemale, and others. All these facts tell in favour of the common\r\ndescent of man and all other vertebrates. The conclusion of this\r\nsection is characteristic: \"_It is only our natural prejudice, and\r\nthat arrogance which made our forefathers declare that they were\r\ndescended from demi-gods, which leads us to demur to this conclusion.\r\nBut the time will before long come, when it will be thought wonderful\r\nthat naturalists, who were well acquainted with the comparative\r\nstructure and development of man, and other mammals, should have\r\nbelieved that each was the work of a separate act of creation._\"[92]\r\n\r\nIn the second chapter there is a more detailed discussion, again based\r\nupon an extraordinary wealth of facts, of the problem as to the manner\r\nin which, and the causes through which, man evolved from a lower form.\r\nPrecisely the same causes are here suggested for the origin of man, as\r\nfor the origin of species in general. Variability, which is a\r\nnecessary assumption in regard to all transformations, occurs in man\r\nto a high degree. Moreover, the rapid multiplication of the human race\r\ncreates conditions which necessitate an energetic struggle for\r\nexistence, and thus afford scope for the intervention of natural\r\nselection. Of the exercise of _artificial_ selection in the human\r\nrace, there is nothing to be said, unless we cite such cases as the\r\ngrenadiers of Frederick William I, or the population of ancient\r\nSparta. In the passages already referred to and in those which follow,\r\nthe transmission of acquired characters, upon which Darwin does not\r\ndwell, is taken for granted. In man, direct effects of changed\r\nconditions can be demonstrated (for instance in regard to bodily\r\nsize), and there are also proofs of the influence exerted on his\r\nphysical constitution by increased use or disuse. Reference is here\r\nmade to the fact, established by Forbes, that the Quechua Indians of\r\nthe high plateaus of Peru show a striking development of lungs and\r\nthorax, as a result of living constantly at high altitudes.\r\n\r\nSuch special forms of variation as arrests of development\r\n(microcephalism) and reversion to lower forms are next discussed.\r\nDarwin himself felt[93] that these subjects are so nearly related to\r\nthe cases mentioned in the first chapter, that many of them might as\r\nwell have been dealt with there. It seems to me that it would have\r\nbeen better so, for the citation of additional instances of reversion\r\nat this place rather disturbs the logical sequence of his ideas as to\r\nthe conditions which have brought about the evolution of man from\r\nlower forms. The instances of reversion here discussed are\r\nmicrocephalism, which Darwin wrongly interpreted as atavistic,\r\nsupernumerary mammae, supernumerary digits, bicornuate uterus, the\r\ndevelopment of abnormal muscles, and so on. Brief mention is also made\r\nof correlative variations observed in man.\r\n\r\nDarwin next discusses the question as to the manner in which man\r\nattained to the erect position from the state of a climbing quadruped.\r\nHere again he puts the influence of Natural Selection in the first\r\nrank. The immediate progenitors of man had to maintain a struggle for\r\nexistence in which success was to the more intelligent, and to those\r\nwith social instincts. The hand of these climbing ancestors, which had\r\nlittle skill and served mainly for locomotion, could only undergo\r\nfurther development when some early member of the Primate series came\r\nto live more on the ground and less among trees.\r\n\r\nA bipedal existence thus became possible, and with it the liberation\r\nof the hand from locomotion, and the one-sided development of the\r\nhuman foot. The upright position brought about correlated variations\r\nin the bodily structure; with the free use of the hand it became\r\npossible to manufacture weapons and to use them; and this again\r\nresulted in a degeneration of the powerful canine teeth and the jaws,\r\nwhich were then no longer necessary for defence. Above all, however,\r\nthe intelligence immediately increased, and with it skull and brain.\r\nThe nakedness of man, and the absence of a tail (rudimentariness of\r\nthe tail vertebrae) are next discussed. Darwin is inclined to\r\nattribute the nakedness of man, not to the action of natural selection\r\non ancestors who originally inhabited a tropical land, but to sexual\r\nselection, which, for aesthetic reasons, brought about the loss of the\r\nhairy covering in man, or primarily in woman. An interesting\r\ndiscussion of the loss of the tail, which, however, man shares with\r\nthe anthropoid apes, some other monkeys and lemurs, forms the\r\nconclusion of the almost superabundant material which Darwin worked\r\nup in the second chapter. His object was to show that some of the most\r\ndistinctive human characters are in all probability directly or\r\nindirectly due to natural selection. With characteristic modesty he\r\nadds:[94] \"Hence, if I have erred in giving to natural selection great\r\npower, which I am very far from admitting, or in having exaggerated\r\nits power, which is in itself probable, I have at least, as I hope,\r\ndone good service in aiding to overthrow the dogma of separate\r\ncreations.\" At the end of the chapter he touches upon the objection as\r\nto man's helpless and defenceless condition. Against this he urges his\r\nintelligence and social instincts.\r\n\r\nThe two following chapters contain a detailed discussion of the\r\nobjections drawn from the supposed great differences between the\r\nmental powers of men and animals. Darwin at once admits that the\r\ndifferences are enormous, but not that any fundamental difference\r\nbetween the two can be found. Very characteristic of him is the\r\nfollowing passage: \"In what manner the mental powers were first\r\ndeveloped in the lowest organisms, is as hopeless an enquiry as how\r\nlife itself first originated. These are problems for the distant\r\nfuture, if they are ever to be solved by man.\"[95]\r\n\r\nAfter some brief observations on instinct and intelligence, Darwin\r\nbrings forward evidence to show that the greater number of the\r\nemotional states, such as pleasure and pain, happiness and misery,\r\nlove and hate are common to man and the higher animals. He goes on to\r\ngive various examples showing that wonder and curiosity, imitation,\r\nattention, memory and imagination (dreams of animals), can also be\r\nobserved in the higher mammals, especially in apes. In regard even to\r\nreason there are no sharply defined limits. A certain faculty of\r\ndeliberation is characteristic of some animals, and the more\r\nthoroughly we know an animal the more intelligence we are inclined to\r\ncredit it with. Examples are brought forward of the intelligent and\r\ndeliberate actions of apes, dogs and elephants. But although no\r\nsharply defined differences exist between man and animals, there is,\r\nnevertheless, a series of other mental powers which are\r\ncharacteristics usually regarded as absolutely peculiar to man. Some\r\nof these characteristics are examined in detail, and it is shown that\r\nthe arguments drawn from them are not conclusive. Man alone is said to\r\nbe capable of progressive improvement; but against this must be placed\r\nas something analogous in animals, the fact that they learn cunning\r\nand caution through long continued persecution. Even the use of tools\r\nis not in itself peculiar to man (monkeys use sticks, stones and\r\ntwigs), but man alone fashions and uses implements _designed for a\r\nspecial purpose_. In this connection the remarks taken from Lubbock in\r\nregard to the origin and gradual development of the earliest flint\r\nimplements will be read with interest; these are similar to the\r\nobservations on modern eoliths, and their bearing on the development\r\nof the stone industry. It is interesting to learn from a letter to\r\nHooker,[96] that Darwin himself at first doubted whether the stone\r\nimplements discovered by Boucher de Perthes were really of the nature\r\nof tools. With the relentless candour as to himself which\r\ncharacterised him, he writes four years later in a letter to Lyell in\r\nregard to this view of Boucher de Perthes' discoveries: \"I know\r\nsomething about his errors, and looked at his book many years ago, and\r\nam ashamed to think that I concluded the whole was rubbish! Yet he has\r\ndone for man something like what Agassiz did for glaciers.\"[97]\r\n\r\nTo return to Darwin's further comparisons between the higher mental powers\r\nof man and animals; He takes much of the force from the argument that man\r\nalone is capable of abstraction and self-consciousness by his own\r\nobservations on dogs. One of the main differences between man and animals,\r\nspeech, receives detailed treatment. He points out that various animals\r\n(birds, monkeys, dogs) have a large number of different sounds for\r\ndifferent emotions, that, further, man produces in common with animals a\r\nwhole series of inarticulate cries combined with gestures, and that dogs\r\nlearn to understand whole sentences of human speech. In regard to human\r\nlanguage, Darwin expresses a view contrary to that held by Max Müller:[98]\r\n\"I cannot doubt that language owes its origin to the imitation and\r\nmodification of various natural sounds, the voices of other animals, and\r\nman's own instinctive cries, aided by signs and gestures.\" The development\r\nof actual language presupposes a higher degree of intelligence than is\r\nfound in any kind of ape. Darwin remarks on this point:[99] \"The fact of\r\nthe higher apes not using their vocal organs for speech no doubt depends on\r\ntheir intelligence not having been sufficiently advanced.\"\r\n\r\nThe sense of beauty, too, has been alleged to be peculiar to man. In\r\nrefutation of this assertion Darwin points to the decorative colours\r\nof birds, which are used for display. And to the last objection, that\r\nman alone has religion, that he alone has a belief in God, it is\r\nanswered \"that numerous races have existed, and still exist, who have\r\nno idea of one or more gods, and who have no words in their languages\r\nto express such an idea.\"[100]\r\n\r\nThe result of the investigations recorded in this chapter is to show\r\nthat, great as the difference in mental powers between man and the\r\nhigher animals may be, it is undoubtedly only a difference \"of degree\r\nand not of kind.\"[101]\r\n\r\nIn the fourth chapter Darwin deals with the _moral sense_ or\r\n_conscience_, which is the most important of all differences between\r\nman and animals. It is a result of social instincts, which lead to\r\nsympathy for other members of the same society, to non-egoistic\r\nactions for the good of others. Darwin shows that social tendencies\r\nare found among many animals, and that among these love and\r\nkin-sympathy exist, and he gives examples of animals (especially dogs)\r\nwhich may exhibit characters that we should call moral in man (e.g.\r\ndisinterested self-sacrifice for the sake of others). The early\r\nape-like progenitors of the human race were undoubtedly social. With\r\nthe increase of intelligence the moral sense develops farther; with\r\nthe acquisition of speech public opinion arises, and finally, moral\r\nsense becomes habit. The rest of Darwin's detailed discussions on\r\nmoral philosophy may be passed over.\r\n\r\nThe fifth chapter may be very briefly summarised. In it Darwin shows\r\nthat the intellectual and moral faculties are perfected through\r\nnatural selection. He inquires how it can come about that a tribe at a\r\nlow level of evolution attains to a higher, although the best and\r\nbravest among them often pay for their fidelity and courage with their\r\nlives without leaving any descendants. In this case it is the\r\nsentiment of glory, praise and blame, the admiration of others, which\r\nbring about the increase of the better members of the tribe. Property,\r\nfixed dwellings, and the association of families into a community are\r\nalso indispensable requirements for civilisation. In the longer second\r\nsection of the fifth chapter Darwin acts mainly as recorder. On the\r\nbasis of numerous investigations, especially those of Greg, Wallace,\r\nand Galton, he inquires how far the influence of natural selection can\r\nbe demonstrated in regard to civilised nations. In the final section,\r\nwhich deals with the proofs that all civilised nations were once\r\nbarbarians, Darwin again uses the results gained by other\r\ninvestigators, such as Lubbock and Tylor. There are two sets of facts\r\nwhich prove the proposition in question. In the first place, we find\r\ntraces of a former lower state in the customs and beliefs of all\r\ncivilised nations, and in the second place, there are proofs to show\r\nthat savage races are independently able to raise themselves a few\r\nsteps in the scale of civilisation, and that they have thus raised\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nIn the sixth chapter of the work, Morphology comes into the foreground\r\nonce more. Darwin first goes back, however, to the argument based on\r\nthe great difference between the mental powers of the highest animals\r\nand those of man. That this is only quantitative, not qualitative, he\r\nhas already shown. Very instructive in this connection is the\r\nreference to the enormous difference in mental powers in another\r\nclass. No one would draw from the fact that the cochineal insect\r\n(Coccus) and the ant exhibit enormous differences in their mental\r\npowers, the conclusion that the ant should therefore be regarded as\r\nsomething quite distinct, and withdrawn from the class of insects\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nDarwin next attempts to establish the _specific_ genealogical tree of\r\nman, and carefully weighs the differences and resemblances between the\r\ndifferent families of the Primates. The erect position of man is an\r\nadaptive character, just as are the various characters referable to\r\naquatic life in the seals, which, notwithstanding these, are ranked as\r\na mere family of the carnivores. The following utterance is very\r\ncharacteristic of Darwin:[102] \"If man had not been his own\r\nclassifier, he would never have thought of founding a separate order\r\nfor his own reception.\" In numerous characters not mentioned in\r\nsystematic works, in the features of the face, in the form of the\r\nnose, in the structure of the external ear, man resembles the apes.\r\nThe arrangement of the hair in man has also much in common with the\r\napes; as also the occurrence of hair on the forehead of the human\r\nembryo, the beard, the convergence of the hair of the upper and under\r\narm towards the elbow, which occurs not only in the anthropoid apes,\r\nbut also in some American monkeys. Darwin here adopts Wallace's\r\nexplanation of the origin of the ascending direction of the hair in\r\nthe forearm of the orang,--that it has arisen through the habit of\r\nholding the hands over the head in rain. But this explanation cannot\r\nbe maintained when we consider that this disposition of the hair is\r\nwidely distributed among the most different mammals, being found in\r\nthe dog, in the sloth, and in many of the lower monkeys.\r\n\r\nAfter further careful analysis of the anatomical characters Darwin\r\nreaches the conclusion that the New World monkeys (Platyrrhine) may be\r\nexcluded from the genealogical tree altogether, but that man is an\r\noffshoot from the Old World monkeys (Catarrhine) whose progenitors\r\nexisted as far back as the Miocene period. Among these Old World\r\nmonkeys the forms to which man shows the greatest resemblance are the\r\nanthropoid apes, which, like him, possess neither tail nor ischial\r\ncallosities. The platyrrhine and catarrhine monkeys have their\r\nprimitive ancestor among extinct forms of the Lemuridae. Darwin also\r\ntouches on the question of the original home of the human race and\r\nsupposes that it may have been in Africa, because it is there that\r\nman's nearest relatives, the gorilla and the chimpanzee, are found.\r\nBut he regards speculation on this point as useless. It is remarkable\r\nthat, in this connection, Darwin regards the loss of the hair-covering\r\nin man as having some relation to a warm climate, while elsewhere he\r\nis inclined to make sexual selection responsible for it. Darwin\r\nrecognises the great gap between man and his nearest relatives, but\r\nsimilar gaps exist at other parts of the mammalian genealogical tree:\r\nthe allied forms have become extinct. After the extermination of the\r\nlower races of mankind, on the one hand, and of the anthropoid apes on\r\nthe other, which will undoubtedly take place, the gulf will be greater\r\nthan ever, since the baboons will then bound it on the one side, and\r\nthe white races on the other. Little weight need be attached to the\r\nlack of fossil remains to fill up this gap, since the discovery of\r\nthese depends upon chance. The last part of the chapter is devoted to\r\na discussion of the earlier stages in the genealogy of man. Here\r\nDarwin accepts in the main the genealogical tree, which had meantime\r\nbeen published by Haeckel, who traces the pedigree back through\r\nMonotrems, Reptiles, Amphibians, and Fishes, to Amphioxus.\r\n\r\nThen follows an attempt to reconstruct, from the atavistic characters,\r\na picture of our primitive ancestor who was undoubtedly an arboreal\r\nanimal. The occurrence of rudiments of parts in one sex which only\r\ncome to full development in the other is next discussed. This state of\r\nthings Darwin regards as derived from an original hermaphroditism. In\r\nregard to the mammary glands of the male he does not accept the theory\r\nthat they are vestigial, but considers them rather as not fully\r\ndeveloped.\r\n\r\nThe last chapter of Part I deals with the question whether the\r\ndifferent races of man are to be regarded as different species, or as\r\nsub-species of a race of monophyletic origin. The striking differences\r\nbetween the races are first emphasised, and the question of the\r\nfertility or infertility of hybrids is discussed. That fertility is\r\nthe more usual is shown by the excessive fertility of the hybrid\r\npopulation of Brazil. This, and the great variability of the\r\ndistinguishing characters of the different races, as well as the fact\r\nthat all grades of transition stages are found between these, while\r\nconsiderable general agreement exists, tell in favour of the unity of\r\nthe races and lead to the conclusion that they all had a common\r\nprimitive ancestor.\r\n\r\nDarwin therefore classifies all the different races as sub-species of\r\n_one and the same species_. Then follows an interesting inquiry into\r\nthe reasons for the extinction of human races. He recognises as the\r\nultimate reason the injurious effects of a change of the conditions of\r\nlife, which may bring about an increase in infantile mortality, and a\r\ndiminished fertility. It is precisely the reproductive system, among\r\nanimals also, which is most susceptible to changes in the environment.\r\n\r\nThe final section of this chapter deals with the formation of the\r\nraces of mankind. Darwin discusses the question how far the direct\r\neffect of different conditions of life, or the inherited effects of\r\nincreased use or disuse may have brought about the characteristic\r\ndifferences between the different races. Even in regard to the origin\r\nof the colour of the skin he rejects the transmitted effects of an\r\noriginal difference of climate as an explanation. In so doing he is\r\nfollowing his tendency to exclude Lamarckian explanations as far as\r\npossible. But here he makes gratuitous difficulties from which, since\r\nnatural selection fails, there is no escape except by bringing in the\r\nprinciple of sexual selection, to which, he regarded it as possible,\r\nskin-colouring, arrangement of hair, and form of features might be\r\ntraced. But with his characteristic conscientiousness he guards\r\nhimself thus: \"I do not intend to assert that sexual selection will\r\naccount for all the differences between the races.\"[103]\r\n\r\nI may be permitted a remark as to Darwin's attitude towards Lamarck.\r\nWhile, at an earlier stage, when he was engaged in the preliminary\r\nlabours for his immortal work, _The Origin of Species_, Darwin\r\nexpresses himself very forcibly against the views of Lamarck, speaking\r\nof Lamarckian \"nonsense,\"[104] and of Lamarck's \"absurd, though clever\r\nwork\"[105] and expressly declaring, \"I attribute very little to the\r\ndirect action of climate, etc.\"[106] yet in later life he became more\r\nand more convinced of the influence of external conditions. In 1876,\r\nthat is, two years after the appearance of the second edition of _The\r\nDescent of Man_, he writes with his usual candid honesty: \"In my\r\nopinion the greatest error which I have committed, has been not\r\nallowing sufficient weight to the direct action of the environment,\r\ni.e. food, climate, etc. independently of a natural selection.\"[107]\r\nIt is certain from this change of opinion that, if he had been able to\r\nmake up his mind to issue a third edition of _The Descent of Man_, he\r\nwould have ascribed a much greater influence to the effect of\r\nexternal conditions in explaining the different characters of the\r\nraces of man than he did in the second edition. He would also\r\nundoubtedly have attributed less influence to sexual selection as a\r\nfactor in the origin of the different bodily characteristics, if\r\nindeed he would not have excluded it altogether.\r\n\r\nIn Part III of the _Descent_ two additional chapters are devoted to\r\nthe discussion of sexual selection in relation to man. These may be\r\nvery briefly referred to. Darwin here seeks to show that sexual\r\nselection has been operative on man and his primitive progenitor.\r\nSpace fails me to follow out his interesting arguments. I can only\r\nmention that he is inclined to trace back hairlessness, the\r\ndevelopment of the beard in man, and the characteristic colour of the\r\ndifferent human races to sexual selection. Since bareness of the skin\r\ncould be no advantage, but rather a disadvantage, this character\r\ncannot have been brought about by natural selection. Darwin also\r\nrejected a direct influence of climate as a cause of the origin of the\r\nskin-colour. I have already expressed the opinion, based on the\r\ndevelopment of his views as shown in his letters, that in a third\r\nedition Darwin would probably have laid more stress on the influence\r\nof external environment. He himself feels that there are gaps in his\r\nproofs here, and says in self-criticism: \"The views here advanced, on\r\nthe part which sexual selection has played in the history of man, want\r\nscientific precision.\"[108] I need here only point out that it is\r\nimpossible to explain the graduated stages of skin-colour by sexual\r\nselection, since it would have produced races sharply defined by their\r\ncolour and not united to other races by transition stages, and this,\r\nit is well known, is not the case. Moreover, the fact established by\r\nme,[109] that in all races the ventral side of the trunk is paler than\r\nthe dorsal side, and the inner surface of the extremities paler than\r\nthe outer side, cannot be explained by sexual selection in the\r\nDarwinian sense.\r\n\r\nWith this I conclude my brief survey of the rich contents of Darwin's\r\nbook. I may be permitted to conclude by quoting the magnificent final\r\nwords of _The Descent of Man_: \"We must, however, acknowledge, as it\r\nseems to me, that man, with all his noble qualities, with sympathy\r\nwhich feels for the most debased, with benevolence which extends not\r\nonly to other men but to the humblest living creature, with his\r\ngod-like intellect which has penetrated into the movements and\r\nconstitution of the solar system--with all these exalted powers--Man\r\nstill bears in his bodily frame the indelible stamp of his lowly\r\norigin.\"[110]\r\n\r\nWhat has been the fate of Darwin's doctrines since his great\r\nachievement? How have they been received and followed up by the\r\nscientific and lay world? And what do the successors of the mighty\r\nhero and genius think now in regard to the origin of the human race?\r\n\r\nAt the present time we are incomparably more favourably placed than\r\nDarwin was for answering this question of all questions. We have at\r\nour command an incomparably greater wealth of material than he had at\r\nhis disposal. And we are more fortunate than he in this respect, that\r\nwe now know transition-forms which help to fill up the gap, still\r\ngreat, between the lowest human races and the highest apes. Let us\r\nconsider for a little the more essential additions to our knowledge\r\nsince the publication of _The Descent of Man_.\r\n\r\nSince that time our knowledge of animal embryos has increased\r\nenormously. While Darwin was obliged to content himself with comparing\r\na human embryo with that of a dog, there are now available the\r\nyoungest embryos of monkeys of all possible groups (Orang, Gibbon,\r\nSemnopithecus, Macacus), thanks to Selenka's most successful tour in\r\nthe East Indies in search of such material. We can now compare\r\ncorresponding stages of the lower monkeys and of the Anthropoid apes\r\nwith human embryos, and convince ourselves of their great resemblance\r\nto one another, thus strengthening enormously the armour prepared by\r\nDarwin in defence of his view on man's nearest relatives. It may be\r\nsaid that Selenka's material fills up the blanks in Darwin's array of\r\nproofs in the most satisfactory manner.\r\n\r\nThe deepening of our knowledge of comparative anatomy also gives us much\r\nsurer foundations than those on which Darwin was obliged to build. Just of\r\nlate there have been many workers in the domain of the anatomy of apes and\r\nlemurs, and their investigations extend to the most different organs. Our\r\nknowledge of fossil apes and lemurs has also become much wider and more\r\nexact since Darwin's time: the fossil lemurs have been especially worked up\r\nby Cope, Forsyth Major, Ameghino, and others. Darwin knew very little about\r\nfossil monkeys. He mentions two or three anthropoid apes as occurring in\r\nthe Miocene of Europe,[111] but only names _Dryopithecus_, the largest form\r\nfrom the Miocene of France. It was erroneously supposed that this form was\r\nrelated to _Hylobates_. We now know not only a form that actually stands\r\nnear to the gibbon (_Pliopithecus_), and remains of other anthropoids\r\n(_Pliohylobates_ and the fossil chimpanzee, _Palaeopithecus_), but also\r\nseveral lower catarrhine monkeys, of which _Mesopithecus_, a form nearly\r\nrelated to the modern Sacred Monkeys (a species of _Semnopithecus_) and\r\nfound in strata of the Miocene period in Greece, is the most important.\r\nQuite recently, too, Ameghino's investigations have made us acquainted with\r\nfossil monkeys from South America (_Anthropops_, _Homunculus_), which,\r\naccording to their discoverer, are to be regarded as in the line of human\r\ndescent.\r\n\r\nWhat Darwin missed most of all--intermediate forms between apes and\r\nman--has been recently furnished. E. Dubois, as is well known,\r\ndiscovered in 1893, near Trinil in Java, in the alluvial deposits of\r\nthe river Bengawan, an important form represented by a skull-cap, some\r\nmolars, and a femur. His opinion--much disputed as it has been--that\r\nin this form, which he named _Pithecanthropus_, he has found a\r\nlong-desired transition-form is shared by the present writer. And\r\nalthough the geological age of these fossils, which, according to\r\nDubois, belong to the uppermost Tertiary series, the Pliocene has\r\nrecently been fixed at a later date (the older Diluvium), the\r\n_morphological value_ of these interesting remains, that is, the\r\nintermediate position of _Pithecanthropus_, still holds good. Volz\r\nsays with justice,[112] that even if _Pithecanthropus_ is not _the_\r\nmissing link, it is undoubtedly _a_ missing link.\r\n\r\nAs on the one hand there has been found in _Pithecanthropus_ a form\r\nwhich, though intermediate between apes and man, is nevertheless more\r\nclosely allied to the apes, so on the other hand, much progress has\r\nbeen made since Darwin's day in the discovery and description of the\r\noldest human remains. Since the famous roof of a skull and the bones\r\nof the extremities belonging to it were found in 1856 in the\r\nNeandertal near Düsseldorf, the most varied judgments have been\r\nexpressed in regard to the significance of the remains and of the\r\nskull in particular. In Darwin's _Descent of Man_ there is only a\r\npassing allusion to them[113] in connection with the discussion of the\r\nskull-capacity, although the investigations of Schaaffhausen, King,\r\nand Huxley were then known. I believe I have shown, in a series of\r\npapers, that the skull in question belongs to a form different from\r\nany of the races of man now living, and, with King and Cope, I regard\r\nit as at least a different species from living man, and have therefore\r\ndesignated it _Homo primigenius_. The form unquestionably belongs to\r\nthe older Diluvium, and in the later Diluvium human forms already\r\nappear, which agree in all essential points with existing human races.\r\n\r\nAs far back as 1886 the value of the Neandertal skull was greatly\r\nenhanced by Fraipont's discovery of two skulls and skeletons from Spy\r\nin Belgium. These are excellently described by their discoverer,[114]\r\nand are regarded as belonging to the same group of forms as the\r\nNeandertal remains. In 1899 and the following years came the discovery\r\nby Gorjanovic-Kramberger of different skeletal parts of at least\r\nten individuals in a cave near Krapina in Croatia.[115] It is in\r\nparticular the form of the lower jaw which is different from that of\r\nall recent races of man, and which clearly indicates the lowly\r\nposition of _Homo primigenius_, while, on the other hand, the\r\nlong-known skull from Gibraltar, which I[116] have referred to _Homo\r\nprimigenius_, and which has lately been examined in detail by\r\nSollas,[117] has made us acquainted with the surprising shape of the\r\neye-orbit, of the nose, and of the whole upper part of the face.\r\nIsolated lower jaws found at La Naulette in Belgium, and at Malarnaud\r\nin France, increase our material which is now as abundant as could be\r\ndesired. The most recent discovery of all is that of a skull dug up in\r\nAugust of this year [1908] by Klaatsch and Hauser in the lower grotto\r\nof the Le Moustier in Southern France, but this skull has not yet been\r\nfully described. Thus _Homo primigenius_ must also be regarded as\r\noccupying a position in the gap existing between the highest apes and\r\nthe lowest human races, _Pithecanthropus_, standing in the lower part\r\nof it, and _Homo primigenius_ in the higher, near man. In order to\r\nprevent misunderstanding, I should like here to emphasise that in\r\narranging this structural series--anthropoid apes, _Pithecanthropus_,\r\n_Homo primigenius_, _Homo sapiens_--I have no intention of\r\nestablishing it as a direct genealogical series. I shall have\r\nsomething to say in regard to the genetic relations of these forms,\r\none to another, when discussing the different theories of descent\r\ncurrent at the present day.[118]\r\n\r\nIn quite a different domain from that of morphological relationship,\r\nnamely in the physiological study of the blood, results have recently\r\nbeen gained which are of the highest importance to the doctrine of\r\ndescent. Uhlenhuth, Nuttall, and others have established the fact that\r\nthe blood-serum of a rabbit which has previously had human blood\r\ninjected into it, forms a precipitate with human blood. This\r\nbiological reaction was tried with a great variety of mammalian\r\nspecies, and it was found that those far removed from man gave no\r\nprecipitate under these conditions. But as in other cases among\r\nmammals all nearly related forms yield an almost equally marked\r\nprecipitate, so the serum of a rabbit treated with human blood and\r\nthen added to the blood of an anthropoid ape gives _almost_ as marked\r\na precipitate as in human blood; the reaction to the blood of the\r\nlower Eastern monkeys is weaker, that to the Western monkeys weaker\r\nstill; indeed in this last case there is only a slight clouding after\r\na considerable time and no actual precipitate. The blood of the\r\nLemuridae (Nuttall) gives no reaction or an extremely weak one, that\r\nof the other mammals none whatever. We have in this not only a proof\r\nof the literal blood relationship between man and apes, but the degree\r\nof relationship with the different main groups of apes can be\r\ndetermined beyond possibility of mistake.\r\n\r\nFinally, it must be briefly mentioned that in regard to remains of\r\nhuman handicraft also, the material at our disposal has greatly\r\nincreased of late years, that, as a result of this, the opinions of\r\narchaeologists have undergone many changes, and that, in particular,\r\ntheir views in regard to the age of the human race have been greatly\r\ninfluenced. There is a tendency at the present time to refer the\r\norigin of man back to Tertiary times. It is true that no remains of\r\nTertiary man have been found, but flints have been discovered which,\r\naccording to the opinion of most investigators, bear traces either of\r\nuse, or of very primitive workmanship. Since Rutot's time, following\r\nMortillet's example, investigators have called these \"eoliths,\" and\r\nthey have been traced back by Verworn to the Miocene of the Auvergne,\r\nand by Rutot even to the upper Oligocene. Although these eoliths are\r\neven nowadays the subject of many different views, the preoccupation\r\nwith them has kept the problem of the age of the human race\r\ncontinually before us.\r\n\r\nGeology, too, has made great progress since the days of Darwin and\r\nLyell, and has endeavoured with satisfactory results to arrange the\r\nhuman remains of the Diluvial period in chronological order (Penck). I\r\ndo not intend to enter upon the question of the primitive home of the\r\nhuman race; since the space at my disposal will not allow of my\r\ntouching even very briefly upon all the departments of science which\r\nare concerned in the problem of the descent of man. How Darwin would\r\nhave rejoiced over each of the discoveries here briefly outlined! What\r\nuse he would have made of the new and precious material, which would\r\nhave prevented the discouragement from which he suffered when\r\npreparing the second edition of _The Descent of Man_! But it was not\r\ngranted to him to see this progress towards filling up the gaps in his\r\nedifice of which he was so painfully conscious.\r\n\r\nHe did, however, have the satisfaction of seeing his ideas steadily\r\ngaining ground, notwithstanding much hostility and deep-rooted\r\nprejudice. Even in the years between the appearance of _The Origin of\r\nSpecies_ and of the first edition of the _Descent_, the idea of a\r\nnatural descent of man, which was only briefly indicated in the work\r\nof 1859, had been eagerly welcomed in some quarters. It has been\r\nalready pointed out how brilliantly Huxley contributed to the defence\r\nand diffusion of Darwin's doctrines, and how in _Man's Place in\r\nNature_ he has given us a classic work as a foundation for the\r\ndoctrine of the descent of man. As Huxley was Darwin's champion in\r\nEngland, so in Germany Carl Vogt, in particular, made himself master\r\nof the Darwinian ideas. But above all it was Haeckel who, in energy,\r\neagerness for battle, and knowledge may be placed side by side with\r\nHuxley, who took over the leadership in the controversy over the new\r\nconception of the universe. As far back as 1866, in his _Generelle\r\nMorphologie_, he had inquired minutely into the question of the\r\ndescent of man, and not content with urging merely the general theory\r\nof descent from lower animal forms, he drew up for the first time\r\ngenealogical trees showing the close structural relationships of the\r\ndifferent animal groups; the last of these illustrated the\r\nrelationships of Mammals, and among them of all groups of the\r\nPrimates, including man. It was Haeckel's genealogical trees that\r\nformed the basis of the special discussion of the relationships of\r\nman, in the sixth chapter of Darwin's _Descent of Man_.\r\n\r\nIn the last section of this essay I shall return to Haeckel's\r\nconception of the special descent of man, the main features of which\r\nhe still upholds, and rightly so. Haeckel has contributed more than\r\nany one else to the spread of the Darwinian doctrine.\r\n\r\nI can only allow myself a few words as to the spread of the theory of\r\nthe natural descent of man in other countries. The Parisian\r\nanthropological school, founded and guided by the genius of Broca,\r\ntook up the idea of the descent of man, and made many notable\r\ncontributions to it (Broca, Manouvrier, Mahoudeau, Deniker and\r\nothers). In England itself Darwin's work did not die. Huxley took care\r\nof that, for he, with his lofty and unprejudiced mind, dominated and\r\ninspired English biology until his death on June 29, 1895. He had the\r\nsatisfaction shortly before his death of learning of Dubois'\r\ndiscovery, which he illustrated by a humourous sketch.[119] But there\r\nare still many followers in Darwin's footsteps in England. Keane has\r\nworked at the special genealogical tree of the Primates; Keith has\r\ninquired which of the anthropoid apes has the greatest number of\r\ncharacters in common with man; Morris concerns himself with the\r\nevolution of man in general, especially with his acquisition of the\r\nerect position. The recent discoveries of _Pithecanthropus_ and _Homo\r\nprimigenius_ are being vigorously discussed; but the present writer is\r\nnot in a position to form an opinion of the extent to which the idea\r\nof descent has penetrated throughout England generally.\r\n\r\nIn Italy independent work in the domain of the descent of man is being\r\nproduced, especially by Morselli; with him are associated, in the\r\ninvestigation of related problems, Sergi and Giuffrida-Ruggeri. From\r\nthe ranks of American investigators we may single out in particular\r\nthe eminent geologist Cope, who championed with much decision the idea\r\nof the specific difference of _Homo neandertalensis_ (_primigenius_)\r\nand maintained a more direct descent of man from the fossil Lemuridae.\r\nIn South America too, in Argentina, new life is stirring in this\r\ndepartment of science. Ameghino in Buenos Ayres has awakened the\r\nfossil primates of the Pampas formation to new life; he even believes\r\nthat in his _Tetraprothomo_, represented by a femur, he has discovered\r\na direct ancestor of man. Lehmann-Nitsche is working at the other side\r\nof the gulf between apes and man, and he describes a remarkable first\r\ncervical vertebra (atlas) from Monte Hermoso as belonging to a form\r\nwhich may bear the same relation to _Homo sapiens_ in South America as\r\n_Homo primigenius_ does in the Old World. After a minute investigation\r\nhe establishes a human species _Homo neogaeus_, while Ameghino\r\nascribes this atlas vertebra to his _Tetraprothomo_.\r\n\r\nThus throughout the whole scientific world there is arising a new\r\nlife, an eager endeavour to get nearer to Huxley's _problema maximum_,\r\nto penetrate more deeply into the origin of the human race. There are\r\nto-day very few experts in anatomy and zoology who deny the animal\r\ndescent of man in general. Religious considerations, old prejudices,\r\nthe reluctance to accept man, who so far surpasses mentally all other\r\ncreatures, as descended from \"soulless\" animals, prevent a few\r\ninvestigators from giving full adherence to the doctrine. But there\r\nare very few of these who still postulate a special act of creation\r\nfor man. Although the majority of experts in anatomy and zoology\r\naccept unconditionally the descent of man from lower forms, there is\r\nmuch diversity of opinion among them in regard to the special line of\r\ndescent.\r\n\r\nIn trying to establish any special hypothesis of descent, whether by\r\nthe graphic method of drawing up genealogical trees or otherwise, let\r\nus always bear in mind Darwin's words[120] and use them as a critical\r\nguiding line: \"As we have no record of the lines of descent, the\r\npedigree can be discovered only by observing the degrees of\r\nresemblance between the beings which are to be classed.\" Darwin\r\ncarries this further by stating \"that resemblances in several\r\nunimportant structures, in useless and rudimentary organs, or not now\r\nfunctionally active, or in an embryological condition, are by far the\r\nmost serviceable for classification.\"[121] It has also to be\r\nremembered that _numerous_ separate points of agreement are of much\r\ngreater importance than the amount of similarity or dissimilarity in a\r\nfew points.\r\n\r\nThe hypotheses as to descent current at the present day may be divided\r\ninto two main groups. The first group seeks for the roots of the human\r\nrace not among any of the families of the apes--the anatomically\r\nnearest forms--nor among their very similar but less specialised\r\nancestral forms, the fossil representatives of which we can know only\r\nin part, but, setting the monkeys on one side, it seeks for them lower\r\ndown among the fossil Eocene Pseudo-lemuridae or Lemuridae (Cope), or\r\neven among the primitive pentadactylous Eocene forms, which may\r\neither have led directly to the evolution of man (Adloff), or have\r\ngiven rise to an ancestral form common to apes and men (Klaatsch,[122]\r\nGiuffrida-Ruggeri). The common ancestral form, from which man and apes\r\nare thus supposed to have arisen independently, may explain the\r\nnumerous resemblances which actually exist between them. That is to\r\nsay, all the characters upon which the great structural resemblance\r\nbetween apes and man depends must have been present in their common\r\nancestor. Let us take an example of such a common character. The bony\r\nexternal ear-passage is in general as highly developed in the lower\r\nEastern monkeys and the anthropoid apes as in man. This character\r\nmust, therefore, have already been present in the common primitive\r\nform. In that case it is not easy to understand why the Western\r\nmonkeys have not also inherited the character, instead of possessing\r\nonly a tympanic ring. But it becomes more intelligible if we assume\r\nthat forms with a primitive tympanic ring were the original type, and\r\nthat from these were evolved, on the one hand, the existing New World\r\nmonkeys with persistent tympanic ring, and on the other an ancestral\r\nform common to the lower Old World monkeys, the anthropoid apes and\r\nman. For man shares with these the character in question, and it is\r\nalso one of the \"unimportant\" characters required by Darwin. Thus we\r\nhave two divergent lines arising from the ancestral form, the Western\r\nmonkeys (Platyrrhine) on the one hand, and an ancestral form common to\r\nthe lower Eastern monkeys, the anthropoid apes, and man, on the other.\r\nBut considerations similar to those which showed it to be impossible\r\nthat man should have developed from an ancestor common to him and the\r\nmonkeys, yet outside of and parallel with these, may be urged also\r\nagainst the likelihood of a parallel evolution of the lower Eastern\r\nmonkeys, the anthropoid apes, and man. The anthropoid apes have in\r\ncommon with man many characters which are not present in the lower\r\nOld World monkeys. These characters must therefore have been present\r\nin the ancestral form common to the three groups. But here, again, it\r\nis difficult to understand why the lower Eastern monkeys should not\r\nalso have inherited these characters. As this is not the case, there\r\nremains no alternative but to assume divergent evolution from an\r\nindifferent form. The lower Eastern monkeys are carrying on the\r\nevolution in one direction--I might almost say towards a blind\r\nalley--while anthropoids and men have struck out a progressive path,\r\nat first in common, which explains the many points of resemblance\r\nbetween them, without regarding man as derived directly from the\r\nanthropoids. Their many striking points of agreement indicate a common\r\ndescent, and cannot be explained as phenomena of convergence.\r\n\r\nI believe I have shown in the above sketch that a theory which derives\r\nman directly from lower forms without regarding apes as\r\ntransition-types leads _ad absurdum_. The close structural\r\nrelationship between man and monkeys can only be understood if both\r\nare brought into the same line of evolution. To trace man's line of\r\ndescent directly back to the old Eocene mammals, alongside of, but\r\nwith no relation to these very similar forms, is to abandon the method\r\nof exact comparison, which, as Darwin rightly recognised, alone\r\njustifies us in drawing up genealogical trees on the basis of\r\nresemblances and differences. The farther down we go the more does the\r\nground slip from beneath our feet. Even the Lemuridae show very\r\nnumerous divergent conditions, much more so the Eocene mammals\r\n(Creodonta, Condylarthra), the chief resemblance of which to man\r\nconsists in the possession of pentadactylous hands and feet! Thus the\r\nfarther course of the line of descent disappears in the darkness of\r\nthe ancestry of the mammals. With just as much reason we might pass by\r\nthe Vertebrates altogether, and go back to the lower Invertebrates,\r\nbut in that case it would be much easier to say that man has arisen\r\nindependently, and has evolved, without relation to any animals, from\r\nthe lowest primitive form to his present isolated and dominant\r\nposition. But this would be to deny all value to classification, which\r\nmust after all be the ultimate basis of a genealogical tree. We can,\r\nas Darwin rightly observed, only infer the line of descent from the\r\ndegree of resemblance between single forms. If we regard man as\r\ndirectly derived from primitive forms very far back, we have no way of\r\nexplaining the many points of agreement between him and the monkeys in\r\ngeneral, and the anthropoid apes in particular. These must remain an\r\ninexplicable marvel.\r\n\r\nI have thus, I trust, shown that the first class of special theories\r\nof descent, which assumes that man has developed, parallel with the\r\nmonkeys, but without relation to them, from very low primitive forms\r\ncannot be upheld, because it fails to take into account the close\r\nstructural affinity of man and monkeys. I cannot but regard this\r\nhypothesis as lamentably retrograde, for it makes impossible any\r\napplication of the facts that have been discovered in the course of\r\nthe anatomical and embryological study of man and monkeys, and indeed\r\nprejudges investigations of that class as pointless. The whole method\r\nis perverted; an unjustifiable theory of descent is first formulated\r\nwith the aid of the imagination, and then we are asked to declare that\r\nall structural relations between man and monkeys, and between the\r\ndifferent groups of the latter, are valueless,--the fact being that\r\nthey are the only true basis on which a genealogical tree can be\r\nconstructed.\r\n\r\nSo much for this most modern method of classification, which has\r\nprobably found adherents because it would deliver us from the\r\nrelationship to apes which many people so much dislike. In contrast to\r\nit we have the second class of special hypotheses of descent, which\r\nkeeps strictly to the nearest structural relationship. This is the\r\nonly basis that justifies the drawing up of a special hypothesis of\r\ndescent. If this fundamental proposition be recognised, it will be\r\nadmitted that the doctrine of special descent upheld by Haeckel, and\r\nset forth in Darwin's _Descent of Man_, is still valid to-day. In the\r\ngenealogical tree, man's place is quite close to the anthropoid apes;\r\nthese again have as their nearest relatives the lower Old World\r\nmonkeys, and their progenitors must be sought among the less\r\ndifferentiated Platyrrhine monkeys, whose most important characters\r\nhave been handed on to the present day New World monkeys. How the\r\ndifferent genera are to be arranged within the general scheme\r\nindicated depends in the main on the classificatory value attributed\r\nto individual characters. This is particularly true in regard to\r\n_Pithecanthropus_, which I consider as the root of a branch which has\r\nsprung from the anthropoid ape root and has led up to man; the latter\r\nI have designated the family of the Hominidae.\r\n\r\nFor the rest, there are, as we have said, various possible ways of\r\nconstructing the narrower genealogy within the limits of this branch\r\nincluding men and apes, and these methods will probably continue to\r\nchange with the accumulation of new facts. Haeckel himself has\r\nmodified his genealogical tree of the Primates in certain details\r\nsince the publication of his _Generelle Morphologie_ in 1866, but its\r\ngeneral basis remains the same.[123] All the special genealogical\r\ntrees drawn up on the lines laid down by Haeckel and Darwin--and that\r\nof Dubois may be specially mentioned--are based, in general, on the\r\nclose relationship of monkeys and men, although they may vary in\r\ndetail. Various hypotheses have been formulated on these lines, with\r\nspecial reference to the evolution of man. _Pithecanthropus_ is\r\nregarded by some authorities as the direct ancestor of man, by others\r\nas a side-track failure in the attempt at the evolution of man. The\r\nproblem of the monophyletic or polyphyletic origin of the human race\r\nhas also been much discussed. Sergi[124] inclines towards the\r\nassumption of a polyphyletic origin of the three main races of man,\r\nthe African primitive form of which has given rise also to the\r\ngorilla and chimpanzee, the Asiatic to the Orang, the Gibbon, and\r\n_Pithecanthropus_. Kollmann regards existing human races as derived\r\nfrom small primitive races (pigmies), and considers that _Homo\r\nprimigenius_ must have arisen in a secondary and degenerative manner.\r\n\r\nBut this is not the place, nor have I the space to criticise the\r\nvarious special theories of descent. One, however, must receive\r\nparticular notice. According to Ameghino, the South American monkeys\r\n(_Pitheculites_) from the oldest Tertiary of the Pampas are the forms\r\nfrom which have arisen the existing American monkeys on the one hand,\r\nand on the other, the extinct South American Homunculidae, which are\r\nalso small forms. From these last, anthropoid apes and man have, he\r\nbelieves, been evolved. Among the progenitors of man, Ameghino reckons\r\nthe form discovered by him (_Tetraprothomo_), from which a South\r\nAmerican primitive man, _Homo pampaeus_, might be directly evolved,\r\nwhile on the other hand all the lower Old World monkeys may have\r\narisen from older fossil South American forms (Clenialitidae), the\r\ndistribution of which may be explained by the bridge formerly existing\r\nbetween South America and Africa, as may be the derivation of all\r\nexisting human races from _Homo pampaeus_.[125] The fossil forms\r\ndiscovered by Ameghino deserve the most minute investigation, as does\r\nalso the fossil man from South America of which Lehmann-Nitsche[126]\r\nhas made a thorough study.\r\n\r\nIt is obvious that, notwithstanding the necessity for fitting man's\r\nline of descent into the genealogical tree of the Primates, especially\r\nthe apes, opinions in regard to it differ greatly in detail. This\r\ncould not be otherwise, since the different Primate forms, especially\r\nthe fossile forms, are still far from being exhaustively known. But\r\none thing remains certain,--the idea of the close relationship between\r\nman and monkeys set forth in Darwin's _Descent of Man_. Only those who\r\ndeny the many points of agreement, the sole basis of classification,\r\nand thus of a natural genealogical tree, can look upon the position of\r\nDarwin and Haeckel as antiquated, or as standing on an insufficient\r\nfoundation. For such a genealogical tree is nothing more than a\r\nsummarised representation of what is known in regard to the degree of\r\nresemblance between the different forms.\r\n\r\nDarwin's work in regard to the descent of man has not been surpassed;\r\nthe more we immerse ourselves in the study of the structural\r\nrelationships between apes and man, the more is our path illumined by\r\nthe clear light radiating from him, and through his calm and\r\ndeliberate investigation, based on a mass of material in the\r\naccumulation of which he has never had an equal. Darwin's fame will be\r\nbound up for all time with the unprejudiced investigation of the\r\nquestion of all questions, the descent of the human race.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 75: _Life and Letters of Thomas Henry Huxley_, Vol. I. p.\r\n171, London, 1900.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 76: _Ibid._, p. 363.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 77: No italics in original.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 78: _Life and Letters of Charles Darwin_, Vol. I. p. 93.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 79: _Ibid._ Vol. II. p. 263.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 80: _Ibid._ Vol. I. p. 94.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 81: _Life and Letters_, Vol. III. p. 175.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 82: _Ibid._ Vol. II. p. 109.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 83: _Ibid._ Vol. III. p. 112.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 84: _Ibid._ Vol. I. pp. 304-317.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 85: _Life and Letters_, Vol. I. p. 309.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 86: _Loc. cit._ p. 313.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 87: _Ibid._ Vol. II. p. 310.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 88: _Ibid._ Vol. III. p. 236.

No other problem in the whole field of research\r\nis so momentous as that of \"Man's place in nature,\" which was justly\r\ndescribed by Huxley (1863) as the most fundamental of all questions.\r\nYet the scientific solution of this problem was impossible until the\r\ntheory of descent had been established.\r\n\r\nIt is now a hundred years since the great French biologist Jean\r\nLamarck published his _Philosophie Zoologique_. By a remarkable\r\ncoincidence the year in which that work was issued, 1809, was the year\r\nof the birth of his most distinguished successor, Charles Darwin.\r\nLamarck had already recognised that the descent of man from a series\r\nof other Vertebrates--that is, from a series of Ape-like Primates--was\r\nessentially involved in the general theory of transformation which he\r\nhad erected on a broad inductive basis; and he had sufficient\r\npenetration to detect the agencies that had been at work in the\r\nevolution of the erect bimanous man from the arboreal and quadrumanous\r\nape. He had, however, few empirical arguments to advance in support of\r\nhis hypothesis, and it could not be established until the further\r\ndevelopment of the biological sciences--the founding of comparative\r\nembryology by Baer (1828) and of the cell-theory by Schleiden and\r\nSchwann (1838), the advance of physiology under Johannes Müller\r\n(1833), and the enormous progress of palaeontology and comparative\r\nanatomy between 1820 and 1860--provided this necessary foundation.\r\nDarwin was the first to coordinate the ample results of these lines of\r\nresearch. With no less comprehensiveness than discrimination he\r\nconsolidated them as a basis of a modified theory of descent, and\r\nassociated with them his own theory of natural selection, which we\r\ntake to be distinctive of \"Darwinism\" in the stricter sense. The\r\nilluminating truth of these cumulative arguments was so great in every\r\nbranch of biology that, in spite of the most vehement opposition, the\r\nbattle was won within a single decade, and Darwin secured the general\r\nadmiration and recognition that had been denied to his forerunner,\r\nLamarck, up to the hour of his death (1829).\r\n\r\nBefore, however, we consider the momentous influence that Darwinism\r\nhas had in anthropology, we shall find it useful to glance at its\r\nhistory in the course of the last half century, and notice the various\r\ntheories that have contributed to its advance. The first attempt to\r\ngive extensive expression to the reform of biology by Darwin's work\r\nwill be found in my _Generelle Morphologie_ (1866)[127] which was\r\nfollowed by a more popular treatment of the subject in my _Natürliche\r\nSchöpfungsgeschichte_ (1868),[128] a compilation from the earlier\r\nwork. In the first volume of the _Generelle Morphologie_ I endeavoured\r\nto show the great importance of evolution in settling the fundamental\r\nquestions of biological philosophy, especially in regard to\r\ncomparative anatomy. In the second volume I dealt broadly with the\r\nprinciple of evolution, distinguishing ontogeny and phylogeny as its\r\ntwo coordinate main branches, and associating the two in the\r\nBiogenetic Law. The Law may be formulated thus: \"Ontogeny (embryology\r\nor the development of the individual) is a concise and compressed\r\nrecapitulation of phylogeny (the palaeontological or genealogical\r\nseries) conditioned by laws of heredity and adaptation.\" The\r\n\"Systematic introduction to general evolution,\" with which the second\r\nvolume of the _Generelle Morphologie_ opens, was the first attempt to\r\ndraw up a natural system of organisms (in harmony with the principles\r\nof Lamarck and Darwin) in the form of a hypothetical pedigree, and was\r\nprovisionally set forth in eight genealogical tables.\r\n\r\nIn the nineteenth chapter of the _Generelle Morphologie_--a part of\r\nwhich has been republished, without any alteration, after a lapse of\r\nforty years--I made a critical study of Lamarck's theory of descent\r\nand of Darwin's theory of selection, and endeavoured to bring the\r\ncomplex phenomena of heredity and adaptation under definite laws for\r\nthe first time. Heredity I divided into conservative and progressive:\r\nadaptation into indirect (or potential) and direct (or actual). I then\r\nfound it possible to give some explanation of the correlation of the\r\ntwo physiological functions in the struggle for life (selection), and\r\nto indicate the important laws of divergence (or differentiation) and\r\ncomplexity (or division of labor), which are the direct and inevitable\r\noutcome of selection. Finally, I marked off dysteleology as the\r\nscience of the aimless (vestigial, abortive, atrophied, and useless)\r\norgans and parts of the body. In all this I worked from a strictly\r\nmonistic standpoint, and sought to explain all biological phenomena on\r\nthe mechanical and naturalistic lines that had long been recognised in\r\nthe study of inorganic nature. Then (1866), as now, being convinced of\r\nthe unity of nature, the fundamental identity of the agencies at work\r\nin the inorganic and the organic worlds, I discarded vitalism,\r\nteleology, and all hypotheses of a mystic character.\r\n\r\nIt was clear from the first that it was essential, in the monistic\r\nconception of evolution, to distinguish between the laws of\r\nconservative and progressive heredity. Conservative heredity maintains\r\nfrom generation to generation the enduring characters of the species.\r\nEach organism transmits to its descendants a part of the morphological\r\nand physiological qualities that it has received from its parents and\r\nancestors. On the other hand, progressive heredity brings new\r\ncharacters to the species--characters that were not found in preceding\r\ngenerations. Each organism may transmit to its offspring a part of the\r\nmorphological and physiological features that it has itself acquired,\r\nby adaptation, in the course of its individual career, through the use\r\nor disuse of particular organs, the influence of environment, climate,\r\nnutrition, etc. At that time I gave the name of \"progressive heredity\"\r\nto this inheritance of acquired characters, as a short and convenient\r\nexpression, but have since changed the term to \"transformative\r\nheredity\" (as distinguished from conservative). This term is\r\npreferable, as inherited regressive modifications (degeneration,\r\nretrograde metamorphosis, etc.) come under the same head.\r\n\r\nTransformative heredity--or the transmission of acquired\r\ncharacters--is one of the most important principles in evolutionary\r\nscience. Unless we admit it most of the facts of comparative anatomy\r\nand physiology are inexplicable. That was the conviction of Darwin no\r\nless than of Lamarck, of Spencer as well as Virchow, of Huxley as well\r\nas Gegenbaur, indeed of the great majority of speculative biologists.\r\nThis fundamental principle was for the first time called in question\r\nand assailed in 1885 by August Weismann of Freiburg, the eminent\r\nzoologist to whom the theory of evolution owes a great deal of\r\nvaluable support, and who has attained distinction by his extension of\r\nthe theory of selection. In explanation of the phenomena of heredity\r\nhe introduced a new theory, the \"theory of the continuity of the\r\ngerm-plasm.\" According to him the living substance in all organisms\r\nconsists of two quite distinct kinds of plasm, somatic and germinal.\r\nThe permanent germ-plasm, or the active substance of the two\r\ngerm-cells (egg-cell and sperm-cell), passes unchanged through a\r\nseries of generations, and is not affected by environmental\r\ninfluences. The environment modifies only the soma-plasm, the organs\r\nand tissues of the body. The modifications that these parts undergo\r\nthrough the influence of the environment or their own activity (use\r\nand habit), do not affect the germ-plasm, and cannot therefore be\r\ntransmitted.\r\n\r\nThis theory of the continuity of the germ-plasm has been expounded by\r\nWeismann during the last twenty-four years in a number of able\r\nvolumes, and is regarded by many biologists, such as Mr. Francis\r\nGalton, Sir E. Ray Lankester, and Professor J. Arthur Thomson (who has\r\nrecently made a thorough-going defence of it in his important work\r\n_Heredity_),[129] as the most striking advance in evolutionary\r\nscience. On the other hand, the theory has been rejected by Herbert\r\nSpencer, Sir W. Turner, Gegenbaur, Kölliker, Hertwig, and many others.\r\nFor my part I have, with all respect for the distinguished Darwinian,\r\ncontested the theory from the first, because its whole foundation\r\nseems to me erroneous, and its deductions do not seem to be in accord\r\nwith the main facts of comparative morphology and physiology.\r\nWeismann's theory in its entirety is a finely conceived molecular\r\nhypothesis, but it is devoid of empirical basis. The notion of the\r\nabsolute and permanent independence of the germ-plasm, as\r\ndistinguished from the soma-plasm, is purely speculative; as is also\r\nthe theory of germinal selection. The determinants, ids, and idants,\r\nare purely hypothetical elements. The experiments that have been\r\ndevised to demonstrate their existence really prove nothing.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me quite improper to describe this hypothetical structure\r\nas \"Neodarwinism.\" Darwin was just as convinced as Lamarck of the\r\ntransmission of acquired characters and its great importance in the\r\nscheme of evolution. I had the good fortune to visit Darwin at Down\r\nthree times and discuss with him the main principles of his system,\r\nand on each occasion we were fully agreed as to the incalculable\r\nimportance of what I may call transformative inheritance. It is only\r\nproper to point out that Weismann's theory of the germ-plasm is in\r\nexpress contradiction to the fundamental principles of Darwin and\r\nLamarck. Nor is it more acceptable in what one may call its\r\n\"ultradarwinism\"--the idea that the theory of selection explains\r\neverything in the evolution of the organic world. This belief in the\r\n\"omnipotence of natural selection\" was not shared by Darwin himself.\r\nAssuredly, I regard it as of the utmost value, as the process of\r\nnatural selection through the struggle for life affords an explanation\r\nof the mechanical origin of the adapted organisation. It solves the\r\ngreat problem: how could the finely adapted structure of the animal or\r\nplant body be formed unless it was built on a preconceived plan? It\r\nthus enables us to dispense with the teleology of the metaphysician\r\nand the dualist, and to set aside the old mythological and poetic\r\nlegends of creation. The idea had occurred in vague form to the great\r\nEmpedocles 2000 years before the time of Darwin, but it was reserved\r\nfor modern research to give it ample expression. Nevertheless, natural\r\nselection does not of itself give the solution of all our evolutionary\r\nproblems. It has to be taken in conjunction with the transformism of\r\nLamarck, with which it is in complete harmony.\r\n\r\nThe monumental greatness of Charles Darwin, who surpasses every other\r\nstudent of science in the nineteenth century by the loftiness of his\r\nmonistic conception of nature and the progressive influence of his\r\nideas, is perhaps best seen in the fact that not one of his many\r\nsuccessors has succeeded in modifying his theory of descent in any\r\nessential point or in discovering an entirely new standpoint in the\r\ninterpretation of the organic world. Neither Nägeli nor Weismann,\r\nneither De Vries nor Roux, has done this. Nägeli, in his\r\n_Mechanisch-Physiologische Theorie der Abstammungslehre_[130] which is\r\nto a great extent in agreement with Weismann, constructed a theory of\r\nthe idioplasm, that represents it (like the germ-plasm) as developing\r\ncontinuously in a definite direction from internal causes. But his\r\ninternal \"principle of progress\" is at the bottom just as teleological\r\nas the vital force of the Vitalists, and the micella structure of the\r\nidioplasm is just as hypothetical as the \"dominant\" structure of the\r\ngerm-plasm. In 1889 Moritz Wagner sought to explain the origin of\r\nspecies by migration and isolation, and on that basis constructed a\r\nspecial \"migration-theory.\" This, however, is not out of harmony with\r\nthe theory of selection. It merely elevates one single factor in the\r\ntheory to a predominant position. Isolation is only a special case of\r\nselection, as I had pointed out in the fifteenth chapter of my\r\n_Natural history of creation_. The \"mutation-theory\" of De Vries,[131]\r\nthat would explain the origin of species by sudden and saltatory\r\nvariations rather than by gradual modification, is regarded by many\r\nbotanists as a great step in advance, but it is generally rejected by\r\nzoologists. It affords no explanation of the facts of adaptation, and\r\nhas no causal value.\r\n\r\nMuch more important than these theories is that of Wilhelm Roux[132]\r\nof \"the struggle of parts within the organism, a supplementation of\r\nthe theory of mechanical adaptation.\" He explains the functional\r\nautoformation of the purposive structure by a combination of Darwin's\r\nprinciple of selection with Lamarck's idea of transformative heredity,\r\nand applies the two in conjunction to the facts of histology. He lays\r\nstress on the significance of functional adaptation, which I had\r\ndescribed in 1866, under the head of cumulative adaptation, as the\r\nmost important factor in evolution. Pointing out its influence in the\r\ncell-life of the tissues, he puts \"cellular selection\" above \"personal\r\nselection,\" and shows how the finest conceivable adaptations in the\r\nstructure of the tissue may be brought about quite mechanically,\r\nwithout preconceived plan. This \"mechanical teleology\" is a valuable\r\nextension of Darwin's monistic principle of selection to the whole\r\nfield of cellular physiology and histology, and is wholly destructive\r\nof dualistic vitalism.\r\n\r\nThe most important advance that evolution has made since Darwin and\r\nthe most valuable amplification of his theory of selection is, in my\r\nopinion, the work of Richard Semon: _Die Mneme als erhaltendes Prinzip\r\nim Wechsel des organischen Geschehens_.[133] He offers a psychological\r\nexplanation of the facts of heredity by reducing them to a process of\r\n(unconscious) memory. The physiologist Ewald Hering had shown in 1870\r\nthat memory must be regarded as a general function of organic matter,\r\nand that we are quite unable to explain the chief vital phenomena,\r\nespecially those of reproduction and inheritance, unless we admit this\r\nunconscious memory. In my essay _Die Perigenesis der Plastidule_[134]\r\nI elaborated this far-reaching idea, and applied the physical\r\nprinciple of transmitted motion to the plastidules, or active\r\nmolecules of plasm. I concluded that \"heredity is the memory of the\r\nplastidules, and variability their power of comprehension.\" This\r\n\"provisional attempt to give a mechanical explanation of the\r\nelementary processes of evolution\" I afterwards extended by showing\r\nthat sensitiveness is (as Carl Nägeli, Ernst Mach, and Albrecht Rau\r\nexpress it) a general quality of matter. This form of panpsychism\r\nfinds its simplest expression in the \"trinity of substance.\"\r\n\r\nTo the two fundamental attributes that Spinoza ascribed to\r\nsubstance--Extension (matter as occupying space) and Cogitation\r\n(energy, force)--we now add the third fundamental quality of Psychoma\r\n(sensitiveness, soul). I further elaborated this trinitarian\r\nconception of substance in the nineteenth chapter of my _Die\r\nLebenswunder_ (1904),[135] and it seems to me well calculated to\r\nafford a monistic solution of many of the antitheses of philosophy.\r\n\r\nThis important Mneme-theory of Semon and the luminous physiological\r\nexperiments and observations associated with it not only throw\r\nconsiderable light on transformative inheritance, but provide a sound\r\nphysiological foundation for the biogenetic law. I had endeavoured to\r\nshow in 1874, in the first chapter of my _Anthropogenie_,[136] that\r\nthis fundamental law of organic evolution holds good generally, and\r\nthat there is everywhere a direct causal connection between ontogeny\r\nand phylogeny. \"Phylogenesis is the mechanical cause of ontogenesis;\"\r\nin other words, \"The evolution of the stem or race is--in accordance\r\nwith the laws of heredity and adaptation--the real cause of all the\r\nchanges that appear, in a condensed form, in the development of the\r\nindividual organism from the ovum, in either the embryo or the larva.\"\r\n\r\nIt is now fifty years since Charles Darwin pointed out, in the\r\nthirteenth chapter of his epoch-making _Origin of Species_, the\r\nfundamental importance of embryology in connection with his theory of\r\ndescent:\r\n\r\n\"The leading facts in embryology, which are second to none in\r\nimportance, are explained on the principle of variations in the many\r\ndescendants from some one ancient progenitor, having appeared at a not\r\nvery early period of life, and having been inherited at a\r\ncorresponding period.\"[137]\r\n\r\nHe then shows that the striking resemblance of the embryos and larvae\r\nof closely related animals, which in the mature stage belong to widely\r\ndifferent species and genera, can only be explained by their descent\r\nfrom a common progenitor. Fritz Müller made a closer study of these\r\nimportant phenomena in the instructive instance of the Crustacean\r\nlarva, as given in his able work _Für Darwin_[138] (1864). I then, in\r\n1872, extended the range so as to include all animals (with the\r\nexception of the unicellular Protozoa) and showed, by means of the\r\ntheory of the Gastraea, that all multicellular, tissue-forming\r\nanimals--all the Metazoa--develop in essentially the same way from the\r\nprimary germ-layers.\r\n\r\nI conceived the embryonic form, in which the whole structure consists of\r\nonly two layers of cells, and is known as the gastrula, to be the\r\nontogenetic recapitulation, maintained by tenacious heredity, of a\r\nprimitive common progenitor of all the Metazoa, the Gastraea. At a later\r\ndate (1895) Monticelli discovered that this conjectural ancestral form is\r\nstill preserved in certain primitive Coelenterata--Pemmatodiscus,\r\nKunstleria, and the nearly-related Orthonectida.\r\n\r\nThe general application of the biogenetic law to all classes of\r\nanimals and plants has been proved in my _Systematische\r\nPhylogenie_.[139] It has, however, been frequently challenged, both by\r\nbotanists and zoologists, chiefly owing to the fact that many have\r\nfailed to distinguish its two essential elements, palingenesis and\r\ncenogenesis. As early as 1874 I had emphasised, in the first chapter\r\nof my _Evolution of Man_, the importance of discriminating carefully\r\nbetween these two sets of phenomena:\r\n\r\n\"In the evolutionary appreciation of the facts of embryology we must\r\ntake particular care to distinguish sharply and clearly between the\r\nprimary, palingenetic evolutionary processes and the secondary,\r\ncenogenetic processes. The palingenetic phenomena, or embryonic\r\n_recapitulations_, are due to heredity, to the transmission of\r\ncharacters from one generation to another. They enable us to draw\r\ndirect inferences in regard to corresponding structures in the\r\ndevelopment of the species (e.g. the chorda or the branchial arches in\r\nall vertebrate embryos). The cenogenetic phenomena, on the other hand,\r\nor the embryonic _variations_, cannot be traced to inheritance from a\r\nmature ancestor, but are due to the adaption of the embryo or the\r\nlarva to certain conditions of its individual development (e.g. the\r\namnion, the allantois, and the vitelline arteries in the embryos of\r\nthe higher vertebrates). These cenogenetic phenomena are later\r\nadditions; we must not infer from them that there were corresponding\r\nprocesses in the ancestral history, and hence they are apt to\r\nmislead.\"\r\n\r\nThe fundamental importance of these facts of comparative anatomy,\r\natavism, and the rudimentary organs, was pointed out by Darwin in the\r\nfirst part of his classic work, _The Descent of Man and Selection in\r\nRelation to Sex_ (1871).[140] In the \"General summary and conclusion\"\r\n(chap. xxi.) he was able to say, with perfect justice: \"He who is not\r\ncontent to look, like a savage, at the phenomena of nature as\r\ndisconnected, cannot any longer believe that man is the work of a\r\nseparate act of creation. He will be forced to admit that the close\r\nresemblance of the embryo of man to that, for instance, of a dog--the\r\nconstruction of his skull, limbs, and whole frame on the same plan\r\nwith that of other mammals, independently of the uses to which the\r\nparts may be put--the occasional reappearance of various structures,\r\nfor instance of several muscles, which man does not normally possess,\r\nbut which are common to the Quadrumana--and a crowd of analogous\r\nfacts--all point in the plainest manner to the conclusion that man is\r\nthe co-descendant with other mammals of a common progenitor.\"\r\n\r\nThese few lines of Darwin's have a greater scientific value than\r\nhundreds of those so-called \"anthropological treatises,\" which give\r\ndetailed descriptions of single organs, or mathematical tables with\r\nseries of numbers and what are claimed to be \"exact analyses,\" but are\r\ndevoid of synoptic conclusions and a philosophical spirit.\r\n\r\nCharles Darwin is not generally recognised as a great anthropologist,\r\nnor does the school of modern anthropologists regard him as a leading\r\nauthority. In Germany, especially, the great majority of the members\r\nof the anthropological societies took up an attitude of hostility to\r\nhim from the very beginning of the controversy in 1860. _The Descent\r\nof Man_ was not merely rejected, but even the discussion of it was\r\nforbidden on the ground that it was \"unscientific.\"\r\n\r\nThe centre of this inveterate hostility for thirty years--especially\r\nafter 1877--was Rudolph Virchow of Berlin, the leading investigator\r\nin pathological anatomy, who did so much for the reform of medicine by\r\nhis establishment of cellular pathology in 1858. As a prominent\r\nrepresentative of \"exact\" or \"descriptive\" anthropology, and lacking a\r\nbroad equipment in comparative anatomy and ontogeny, he was unable to\r\naccept the theory of descent. In earlier years, and especially during\r\nhis splendid period of activity at Würzburg (1848-1856), he had been a\r\nconsistent free-thinker, and had in a number of able articles\r\n(collected in his _Gesammelte Abhandlungen_)[141] upheld the unity of\r\nhuman nature, the inseparability of body and spirit. In later years at\r\nBerlin, where he was more occupied with political work and sociology\r\n(especially after 1866), he abandoned the positive monistic position\r\nfor one of agnosticism and scepticism, and made concessions to the\r\ndualistic dogma of a spiritual world apart from the material frame.\r\n\r\nIn the course of a Scientific Congress at Munich in 1877 the conflict\r\nof these antithetic views of nature came into sharp relief. At this\r\nmemorable Congress I had undertaken to deliver the first address\r\n(September 18th) on the subject of \"Modern evolution in relation to\r\nthe whole of science.\" I maintained that Darwin's theory not only\r\nsolved the great problem of the origin of species, but that its\r\nimplications, especially in regard to the nature of man, threw\r\nconsiderable light on the whole of science, and on anthropology in\r\nparticular. The discovery of the real origin of man by evolution from\r\na long series of mammal ancestors threw light on his place in nature\r\nin every respect, as Huxley had already shown in his excellent\r\nlectures of 1863. Just as all the organs and tissues of the human body\r\nhad originated from those of the nearest related mammals, certain\r\nape-like forms, so we were bound to conclude that his mental qualities\r\nalso had been derived from those of his extinct primate ancestor.\r\n\r\nThis monistic view of the origin and nature of man, which is now admitted\r\nby nearly all who have the requisite acquaintance with biology, and\r\napproach the subject without prejudice, encountered a sharp opposition at\r\nthat time. The opposition found its strongest expression in an address that\r\nVirchow delivered at Munich four days afterwards (September 22nd), on \"The\r\nfreedom of science in the modern State.\" He spoke of the theory of\r\nevolution as an unproved hypothesis, and declared that it ought not to be\r\ntaught in the schools, because it was dangerous to the State. \"We must\r\nnot,\" he said, \"teach that man has descended from the ape or any other\r\nanimal.\" When Darwin, usually so lenient in his judgment, read the English\r\ntranslation of Virchow's speech, he expressed his disapproval in strong\r\nterms. But the great authority that Virchow had--an authority well founded\r\nin pathology and sociology--and his prestige as president of the German\r\nAnthropological Society, had the effect of preventing any member of the\r\nSociety from raising serious opposition to him for thirty years. Numbers of\r\njournals and treatises repeated his dogmatic statement: \"It is quite\r\ncertain that man has descended neither from the ape nor from any other\r\nanimal.\" In this he persisted till his death in 1902. Since that time the\r\nwhole position of German anthropology has changed. The question is no\r\nlonger whether man was created by a distinct supernatural act or evolved\r\nfrom other mammals, but to which line of the animal hierarchy we must look\r\nfor the actual series of ancestors. The interested reader will find an\r\naccount of this \"battle of Munich\" (1877) in my three Berlin lectures\r\n(April, 1905), _Der Kampf um die Entwickelungs-Gedanken_.[142]\r\n\r\nThe main points in our genealogical tree were clearly recognised by\r\nDarwin in the sixth chapter of the _Descent of Man_. Lowly organised\r\nfishes, like the lancelot (Amphioxus), are descended from lower\r\ninvertebrates resembling the larvae of an existing Tunicate\r\n(Appendicularia). From these primitive fishes were evolved higher\r\nfishes of the ganoid type and others of the type of Lepidosiren\r\n(Dipneusta). It is a very small step from these to the Amphibia:\r\n\r\n\"In the class of animals the steps are not difficult to conceive which\r\nled from the ancient Monotremata to the ancient Marsupials; and from\r\nthese to the early progenitors of the placental mammals. We may thus\r\nascend to the Lemuridae; and the interval is not very wide from these\r\nto the Simiadae. The Simiadae then branched off into two great stems,\r\nthe New World and Old World monkeys; and from the latter, at a remote\r\nperiod, Man, the wonder and glory of the Universe, proceeded.\"[143]\r\n\r\nIn these few lines Darwin clearly indicated the way in which we were\r\nto conceive our ancestral series within the vertebrates. It is fully\r\nconfirmed by all the arguments of comparative anatomy and embryology,\r\nof palaeontology and physiology; and all the research of the\r\nsubsequent forty years have gone to establish it. The deep interest in\r\ngeology which Darwin maintained throughout his life and his complete\r\nknowledge of palaeontology enabled him to grasp the fundamental\r\nimportance of the palaeontological record more clearly than\r\nanthropologists and zoologists usually do.\r\n\r\nThere has been much debate in subsequent decades whether Darwin\r\nhimself maintained that man was descended from the ape, and many\r\nwriters have sought to deny it. But the lines I have quoted _verbatim_\r\nfrom the conclusion of the sixth chapter of the _Descent of Man_\r\n(1871) leave no doubt that he was as firmly convinced of it as was his\r\ngreat precursor Jean Lamarck in 1809. Moreover, Darwin adds, with\r\nparticular explicitness, in the \"general summary and conclusion\"\r\n(chap. xxi.) of that standard work:[144]\r\n\r\n\"By considering the embryological structure of man--the homologies\r\nwhich he presents with the lower animals,--the rudiments which he\r\nretains,--and the reversions to which he is liable, we can partly\r\nrecall in imagination the former condition of our early progenitors;\r\nand can approximately place them in their proper place in the\r\nzoological series. We thus learn that man is descended from a hairy,\r\ntailed quadruped, probably arboreal in its habits, and an inhabitant\r\nof the Old World. This creature, if its whole structure had been\r\nexamined by a naturalist, would have been classed amongst the\r\nQuadrumana, as surely as the still more ancient progenitor of the Old\r\nand New World monkeys.\"\r\n\r\nThese clear and definite lines leave no doubt that Darwin--so critical\r\nand cautious in regard to important conclusions--was quite as firmly\r\nconvinced of the descent of man from the apes (the Catarrhinae, in\r\nparticular) as Lamarck was in 1809 and Huxley in 1863.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted particularly that, in these and other observations\r\non the subject, Darwin decidedly assumes the monophyletic origin of\r\nthe mammals, including man. It is my own conviction that this is of\r\nthe greatest importance. A number of difficult questions in regard to\r\nthe development of man, in respect of anatomy, physiology, psychology,\r\nand embryology, are easily settled if we do not merely extend our\r\n_progonotaxis_ to our nearest relatives, the anthropoid apes and the\r\ntailed monkeys from which these have descended, but go further back\r\nand find an ancestor in the group of the Lemuridae, and still further\r\nback to the Marsupials and Monotremata. The essential identity of all\r\nthe Mammals in point of anatomical structure and embryonic\r\ndevelopment--in spite of their astonishing differences in external\r\nappearance and habits of life--is so palpably significant that modern\r\nzoologists are agreed in the hypothesis that they have all sprung from\r\na common root, and that this root may be sought in the earlier\r\nPalaeozoic Amphibia.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental importance of this comparative morphology of the\r\nMammals, as a sound basis of scientific anthropology, was recognised\r\njust before the beginning of the nineteenth century, when Lamarck\r\nfirst emphasised (1794) the division of the animal kingdom into\r\nVertebrates and Invertebrates. Even thirteen years earlier (1781),\r\nwhen Goethe made a close study of the mammal skeleton in the\r\nAnatomical Institute at Jena, he was intensely interested to find that\r\nthe composition of the skull was the same in man as in the other\r\nmammals. His discovery of the _os inter-maxillare_ in man (1784),\r\nwhich was contradicted by most of the anatomists of the time, and his\r\ningenious \"vertebral theory of the skull,\" were the splendid fruit of\r\nhis morphological studies. They remind us how Germany's greatest\r\nphilosopher and poet was for many years ardently absorbed in the\r\ncomparative anatomy of man and the mammals, and how he divined that\r\ntheir wonderful identity in structure was no mere superficial\r\nresemblance, but pointed to a deep internal connection. In my\r\n_Generelle Morphologie_ (1866), in which I published the first\r\nattempts to construct phylogenetic trees, I have given a number of\r\nremarkable theses of Goethe, which may be called \"phyletic\r\nprophecies.\" They justify us in regarding him as a precursor of\r\nDarwin.\r\n\r\nIn the ensuing forty years I have made many conscientious efforts to\r\npenetrate further along that line of anthropological research that was\r\nopened up by Goethe, Lamarck, and Darwin. I have brought together the many\r\nvaluable results that have constantly been reached in comparative anatomy,\r\nphysiology, ontogeny, and palaeontology, and maintained the effort to\r\nreform the classification of animals and plants in an evolutionary sense.\r\nThe first rough drafts of pedigrees that were published in the _Generelle\r\nMorphologie_ have been improved time after time in the ten editions of my\r\n_Natürlich Schöpfungsgeschichte_ (1868-1902).[145] A sounded basis for my\r\nphyletic hypotheses, derived from a discriminating combination of the three\r\ngreat records--morphology, ontogeny, and palaeontology--was provided in the\r\nthree volumes of my _Systematische Phylogenie_[146] (1894 Protists and\r\nPlants, 1895 Vertebrates, 1896 Invertebrates).\r\n\r\nIn my _Anthropogenie_[147] I endeavoured to employ all the known\r\nfacts of comparative ontogeny (embryology) for the purpose of\r\ncompleting my scheme of human phylogeny (evolution). I attempted to\r\nsketch the historical development of each organ of the body, beginning\r\nwith the most elementary structures in the germ-layers of the\r\nGastraea. At the same time I drew up a corrected statement of the most\r\nimportant steps in the line of our ancestral series.\r\n\r\nAt the fourth International Congress of Zoology at Cambridge (August\r\n26th, 1898) I delivered an address on \"Our present knowledge of the\r\nDescent of Man.\" It was translated into English, enriched with many\r\nvaluable notes and additions, by my friend and pupil in earlier days\r\nDr. Hans Gadow (Cambridge), and published under the title: _The Last\r\nLink: our present knowledge of the Descent of Man_[148] The\r\ndetermination of the chief animal forms that occur in the line of our\r\nancestry is there restricted to thirty types, and these are\r\ndistributed in six main groups.\r\n\r\nThe first half of this \"Progonotaxis hominis,\" which has no support\r\nfrom fossil evidence, comprises three groups: (i) Protista\r\n(unicellular organisms, 1-5): (ii) Invertebrate Metazoa (Coelenteria\r\n6-8, Vermalia 9-11): (iii) Monorrhine Vertebrates (Acrania 12-13,\r\nCyclostoma 14-15). The second half, which is based on fossil records,\r\nalso comprises three groups: (iv) Palaeozoic cold-blooded Craniota\r\n(Fishes 16-18, Amphibia 19, Reptiles 20): (v) Mesozoic Mammals\r\n(Monotrema 21, Marsupialia 22, Mallotheria 23): (vi) Cenozoic Primates\r\n(Lemuridae 24-25, Tailed Apes 26-27, Anthropomorpha 28-30). An\r\nimproved and enlarged edition of this hypothetic \"Progonotaxis\r\nhominis\" was published in 1908, in my essay _Unsere Ahnenreihe_.[149]\r\n\r\nIf I have succeeded in furthering, in some degree, by these\r\nanthropological works, the solution of the great problem of Man's\r\nplace in nature, and particularly in helping to trace the definite\r\nstages in our ancestral series, I owe the success, not merely to the\r\nvast progress that biology has made in the last half century, but\r\nlargely to the luminous example of the great investigators who have\r\napplied themselves to the problem, with so much assiduity and genius,\r\nfor a century and a quarter--I mean Goethe and Lamarck, Gegenbaur and\r\nHuxley, but, above all, Charles Darwin. It was the great genius of\r\nDarwin that first brought together that symmetrical temple of\r\nscientific knowledge, the theory of descent. It was Darwin who put the\r\ncrown on the edifice by his theory of natural selection. Not until\r\nthis broad inductive law was firmly established was it possible to\r\nvindicate the special conclusion, the descent of man from a series of\r\nother Vertebrates. By his illuminating discovery Darwin did more for\r\nanthropology than thousands of those writers, who are more\r\nspecifically titled anthropologists, have done by their technical\r\ntreatises. We may, indeed, say that it is not merely as an exact\r\nobserver and ingenious experimenter, but as a distinguished\r\nanthropologist and far-seeing thinker, that Darwin takes his place\r\namong the greatest men of science of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nTo appreciate fully the immortal merit of Darwin in connection with\r\nanthropology, we must remember that not only did his chief work, _The\r\nOrigin of Species_, which opened up a new era in natural history in\r\n1859, sustain the most virulent and widespread opposition for a\r\nlengthy period, but even thirty years later, when its principles were\r\ngenerally recognised and adopted, the application of them to man was\r\nenergetically contested by many high scientific authorities. Even\r\nAlfred Russel Wallace, who discovered the principle of natural\r\nselection independently in 1858, did not concede that it was\r\napplicable to the higher mental and moral qualities of man. Dr.\r\nWallace still holds a spiritualist and dualist view of the nature of\r\nman, contending that he is composed of a material frame (descended\r\nfrom the apes) and an immortal immaterial soul (infused by a higher\r\npower). This dual conception, moreover, is still predominant in the\r\nwide circles of modern theology and metaphysics, and has the general\r\nand influential adherence of the more conservative classes of society.\r\n\r\nIn strict contradiction to this mystical dualism, which is generally\r\nconnected with teleology and vitalism, Darwin always maintained the\r\ncomplete unity of human nature, and showed convincingly that the\r\npsychological side of man was developed, in the same way as the body,\r\nfrom the less advanced soul of the anthropoid ape, and, at a still\r\nmore remote period, from the cerebral functions of the older\r\nvertebrates. The eighth chapter of the _Origin of Species_, which is\r\ndevoted to instinct, contains weighty evidence that the instincts of\r\nanimals are subject, like all other vital processes, to the general\r\nlaws of historic development. The special instincts of particular\r\nspecies were formed by adaptation, and the modifications thus acquired\r\nwere handed on to posterity by heredity; in their formation and\r\npreservation natural selection plays the same part as in the\r\ntransformation of every other physiological function. The higher moral\r\nqualities of civilised man have been derived from the lower mental\r\nfunctions of the uncultivated barbarians and savages, and these in\r\nturn from the social instincts of the mammals. This natural and\r\nmonistic psychology of Darwin's was afterwards more fully developed by\r\nhis friend George Romanes in his excellent works _Mental Evolution in\r\nAnimals_ and _Mental Evolution in Man_.[150]\r\n\r\nMany valuable and most interesting contributions to this monistic\r\npsychology of man were made by Darwin in his fine work on _The Descent\r\nof Man and Selection in Relation to Sex_, and again in his\r\nsupplementary work, _The Expression of the Emotions in Man and\r\nAnimals_. To understand the historical development of Darwin's\r\nanthropology one must read his life and the introduction to _The\r\nDescent of Man_. From the moment that he was convinced of the truth\r\nof the principle of descent--that is to say, from his thirtieth year,\r\nin 1838--he recognised clearly that man could not be excluded from its\r\nrange. He recognised as a logical necessity the important conclusion\r\nthat \"man is the co-descendant with other species of some ancient,\r\nlower, and extinct form.\" For many years he gathered notes and\r\narguments in support of this thesis, and for the purpose of showing\r\nthe probable line of man's ancestry. But in the first edition of _The\r\nOrigin of Species_ (1859) he restricted himself to the single line,\r\nthat by this work \"light would be thrown on the origin of man and his\r\nhistory.\" In the fifty years that have elapsed since that time the\r\nscience of the origin and nature of man has made astonishing progress,\r\nand we are now fairly agreed in a monistic conception of nature that\r\nregards the whole universe, including man, as a wonderful unity,\r\ngoverned by unalterable and eternal laws. In my philosophical book\r\n_Die Welträtsel_ (1899)[151] and in the supplementary volume _Die\r\nLebenswunder_ (1904)[152] I have endeavoured to show that this pure\r\nmonism is securely established, and that the admission of the\r\nall-powerful rule of the same principle of evolution throughout the\r\nuniverse compels us to formulate a single supreme law--the\r\nall-embracing \"Law of Substance,\" or the united laws of the constancy\r\nof matter and the conservation of energy. We should never have reached\r\nthis supreme general conception if Charles Darwin--a \"monistic\r\nphilosopher\" in the true sense of the word--had not prepared the way\r\nby his theory of descent by natural selection, and crowned the great\r\nwork of his life by the association of this theory with a naturalistic\r\nanthropology.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 127: _Generelle Morphologie der Organismen_, 2 vols.,\r\nBerlin, 1866.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 128: Eng. transl.; _The History of Creation_, London, 1876.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 129: London, 1908.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 130: Munich, 1884.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 131: _Die Mutationstheorie_, Leipzig, 1903.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 132: _Der Kampf der Theile im Organismus_, Leipzig, 1881.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 133: Leipzig, 1904.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 134: Berlin, 1876.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 135: _Wonders of Life_, London and New York, 1904.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 136: Eng. transl.; _The Evolution of Man_, 2 vols., London,\r\n1879 and 1905.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 137: _Origin of Species_ (6th edit.), p. 396.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 138: Eng. transl.; _Facts and Arguments for Darwin_, London,\r\n1869.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 139: 3 vols., Berlin, 1894-96.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 140: _Descent of Man_ (Popular Edit.), p. 927.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 141: _Gesammelte Abhandlungen zur wissenschaftlichen\r\nMedizin_, Berlin, 1856.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 142: Eng. transl.; _Last Words on Evolution_, London, 1906.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 143: _Descent of Man_, (Popular Edit.), p. 255.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 144: _Descent of Man_, p. 930.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 145: Eng. transl.; _The History of Creation_, London, 1876.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 146: Berlin, 1894-96.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 147: Leipzig, 1874, 5th edit. 1905.

LLOYD MORGAN, LLD., F.R.S\r\n\r\n\r\nIn developing his conception of organic evolution Charles Darwin was\r\nof necessity brought into contact with some of the problems of mental\r\nevolution. In _The Origin of Species_ he devoted a chapter to \"the\r\ndiversities of instinct and of the other mental faculties in animals\r\nof the same class.\"[153] When he passed to the detailed consideration\r\nof _The Descent of Man_, it was part of his object to show \"that there\r\nis no fundamental difference between man and the higher mammals in\r\ntheir mental faculties.\"[154] \"If no organic being excepting man,\" he\r\nsaid, \"had possessed any mental power, or if his powers had been of a\r\nwholly different nature, from those of the lower animals, then we\r\nshould never have been able to convince ourselves that our high\r\nfaculties had been gradually developed.\"[155] In his discussion of\r\n_The Expression of the Emotions_ it was important for his purpose\r\n\"fully to recognise that actions readily become associated with other\r\nactions and with various states of the mind.\"[156] His hypothesis of\r\nsexual selection is largely dependent upon the exercise of choice on\r\nthe part of the female and her preference for \"not only the more\r\nattractive but at the same time the more vigourous and vicious\r\nmales.\"[157] Mental processes and physiological processes were for\r\nDarwin closely correlated; and he accepted the conclusion \"that the\r\nnervous system not only regulates most of the existing functions of\r\nthe body, but has indirectly influenced the progressive development of\r\nvarious bodily structures and of certain mental qualities.\"[158]\r\n\r\nThroughout his treatment, mental evolution was for Darwin incidental\r\nto and contributory to organic evolution. For specialised research in\r\ncomparative and genetic psychology, as an independent field of\r\ninvestigation, he had neither the time nor the requisite training.\r\nNone the less his writings and the spirit of his work have exercised a\r\nprofound influence on this department of evolutionary thought. And,\r\nfor those who follow Darwin's lead, mental evolution is still in a\r\nmeasure subservient to organic evolution. Mental processes are the\r\naccompaniments or concomitants of the functional activity of specially\r\ndifferentiated parts of the organism. They are in some way dependent\r\non physiological and physical conditions. But though they are not\r\nphysical in their nature, and though it is difficult or impossible to\r\nconceive that they are physical in their origin, they are, for Darwin\r\nand his followers, factors in the evolutionary process in its physical\r\nor organic aspect. By the physiologist within his special and\r\nwell-defined universe of discourse they may be properly regarded as\r\nepiphenomena; but by the naturalist in his more catholic survey of\r\nnature they cannot be so regarded, and were not so regarded by Darwin.\r\nIntelligence has contributed to evolution of which it is in a sense a\r\nproduct.\r\n\r\nThe facts of observation or of inference which Darwin accepted are\r\nthese: Conscious experience accompanies some of the modes of animal\r\nbehaviour; it is concomitant with certain physiological processes;\r\nthese processes are the outcome of development in the individual and\r\nevolution in the race; the accompanying mental processes undergo a\r\nlike development. Into the subtle philosophical questions which arise\r\nout of the naïve acceptance of such a creed it was not Darwin's\r\nprovince to enter; \"I have nothing to do,\" he said,[159] \"with the\r\norigin of the mental powers, any more than I have with that of life\r\nitself.\" He dealt with the natural history of organisms, including not\r\nonly their structure but their modes of behaviour; with the natural\r\nhistory of the states of consciousness which accompany some of their\r\nactions; and with the relation of behaviour to experience. We will\r\nendeavour to follow Darwin in his modesty and candour in making no\r\npretence to give ultimate explanations. But we must note one of the\r\nimplications of this self-denying ordinance of science. Development\r\nand evolution imply continuity. For Darwin and his followers the\r\ncontinuity is organic through physical heredity. Apart from\r\nspeculative hypothesis, legitimate enough in its proper place but here\r\nout of court, we know nothing of continuity of mental evolution as\r\nsuch: consciousness appears afresh in each succeeding generation.\r\nHence it is that for those who follow Darwin's lead, mental evolution\r\nis and must ever be, within his universe of discourse, subservient to\r\norganic evolution. Only in so far as conscious experience, or its\r\nneural correlate, effects some changes in organic structure can it\r\ninfluence the course of heredity; and conversely only in so far as\r\nchanges in organic structure are transmitted through heredity, is\r\nmental evolution rendered possible. Such is the logical outcome of\r\nDarwin's teaching.\r\n\r\nThose who abide by the cardinal results of this teaching are bound to\r\nregard all behaviour as the expression of the functional activities of\r\nthe living tissues of the organism, and all conscious experience as\r\ncorrelated with such activities. For the purposes of scientific\r\ntreatment, mental processes are one mode of expression of the same\r\nchanges of which the physiological processes accompanying behaviour\r\nare another mode of expression. This is simply accepted as a fact\r\nwhich others may seek to explain. The behaviour itself is the adaptive\r\napplication of the energies of the organism; it is called forth by\r\nsome form of presentation or stimulation brought to bear on the\r\norganism by the environment. This presentation is always an individual\r\nor personal matter. But in order that the organism may be fitted to\r\nrespond to the presentation of the environment it must have undergone\r\nin some way a suitable preparation. According to the theory of\r\nevolution this preparation is primarily racial and is transmitted\r\nthrough heredity. Darwin's main thesis was that the method of\r\npreparation is predominantly by natural selection. Subordinate to\r\nracial preparation, and always dependent thereon, is individual or\r\npersonal preparation through some kind of acquisition; of which the\r\nguidance of behaviour through individually won experience is a typical\r\nexample. We here introduce the mental factor because the facts seem to\r\njustify the inference. Thus there are some modes of behaviour which\r\nare wholly and solely dependent upon inherited racial preparation;\r\nthere are other modes of behaviour which are also dependent, in part\r\nat least, on individual preparation. In the former case the behaviour\r\nis adaptive on the first occurrence of the appropriate presentation;\r\nin the latter case accommodation to circumstances is only reached\r\nafter a greater or less amount of acquired organic modification of\r\nstructure, often accompanied (as we assume) in the higher animals by\r\nacquired experience. Logically and biologically the two classes of\r\nbehaviour are clearly distinguishable: but the analysis of complex\r\ncases of behaviour where the two factors coöperate, is difficult and\r\nrequires careful and critical study of life-history.\r\n\r\nThe foundations of the mental life are laid in the conscious\r\nexperience that accompanies those modes of behaviour, dependent\r\nentirely on racial preparation, which may broadly be described as\r\ninstinctive. In the eighth chapter of _The Origin of Species_ Darwin\r\nsays,[160] \"I will not attempt any definition of instinct.... Every\r\none understands what is meant, when it is said that instinct impels\r\nthe cuckoo to migrate and to lay her eggs in other birds' nests. An\r\naction, which we ourselves require experience to enable us to perform,\r\nwhen performed by an animal, more especially by a very young one,\r\nwithout experience, and when performed by many individuals in the same\r\nway, without their knowing for what purpose it is performed, is\r\nusually said to be instinctive.\" And in the summary at the close of\r\nthe chapter he says,[161] \"I have endeavoured briefly to show that the\r\nmental qualities of our domestic animals vary, and that the variations\r\nare inherited. Still more briefly I have attempted to show that\r\ninstincts vary slightly in a state of nature. No one will dispute that\r\ninstincts are of the highest importance to each animal. Therefore\r\nthere is no real difficulty, under changing conditions of life, in\r\nnatural selection accumulating to any extent slight modifications of\r\ninstinct which are in any way useful. In many cases habit or use and\r\ndisuse have probably come into play.\"\r\n\r\nInto the details of Darwin's treatment there is neither space nor need\r\nto enter. There are some ambiguous passages; but it may be said that\r\nfor him, as for his followers to-day, instinctive behaviour is wholly\r\nthe result of racial preparation transmitted through organic heredity.\r\nFor the performance of the instinctive act no individual preparation\r\nunder the guidance of personal experience is necessary. It is true\r\nthat Darwin quotes with approval Huber's saying that \"a little dose of\r\njudgment or reason often comes into play, even with animals low in the\r\nscale of nature.\"[162] But we may fairly interpret his meaning to be\r\nthat in behaviour, which is commonly called instinctive, some element\r\nof intelligent guidance is often combined. If this be conceded the\r\nstrictly instinctive performance (or part of the performance) is the\r\noutcome of heredity and due to the direct transmission of parental or\r\nancestral aptitudes. Hence the instinctive response as such depends\r\nentirely on how the nervous mechanism has been built up through\r\nheredity; while intelligent behaviour, or the intelligent factor in\r\nbehaviour, depends also on how the nervous mechanism has been modified\r\nand moulded by use during its development and concurrently with the\r\ngrowth of individual experience in the customary situations of daily\r\nlife. Of course it is essential to the Darwinian thesis that what Sir\r\nE. Ray Lankester has termed \"educability,\" not less than instinct, is\r\nhereditary. But it is also essential to the understanding of this\r\nthesis that the differentiae of the hereditary factor should be\r\nclearly grasped.\r\n\r\nFor Darwin there were two modes of racial preparation, (_1_) natural\r\nselection, and (_2_) the establishment of individually acquired habit.\r\nHe showed that instincts are subject to hereditary variation; he saw\r\nthat instincts are also subject to modification through acquisition in\r\nthe course of individual life. He believed that not only the\r\nvariations but also, to some extent, the modifications are inherited.\r\nHe therefore held that some instincts (the greater number) are due to\r\nnatural selection but that others (less numerous) are due, or partly\r\ndue, to the inheritance of acquired habits. The latter involve\r\nLamarckian inheritance, which of late years has been the centre of so\r\nmuch controversy. It is noteworthy however that Darwin laid especial\r\nemphasis on the fact that many of the most typical and also the most\r\ncomplex instincts--those of neuter insects--do not admit of such an\r\ninterpretation. \"I am surprised,\" he says,[163] \"that no one has\r\nhitherto advanced this demonstrative case of neuter insects, against\r\nthe well-known doctrine of inherited habit, as advanced by Lamarck.\"\r\nNone the less Darwin admitted this doctrine as supplementary to that\r\nwhich was more distinctively his own--for example in the case of the\r\ninstincts of domesticated animals. Still, even in such cases, \"it may\r\nbe doubted,\" he says,[164] \"whether any one would have thought of\r\ntraining a dog to point, had not some one dog naturally shown a\r\ntendency in this line ... so that habit and some degree of selection\r\nhave probably concurred in civilising by inheritance our dogs.\" But in\r\nthe interpretation of the instincts of domesticated animals, a more\r\nrecently suggested hypothesis, that of organic selection,[165] may be\r\nhelpful. According to this hypothesis any intelligent modification of\r\nbehaviour which is subject to selection is probably coincident in\r\ndirection with an inherited tendency to behave in this fashion. Hence\r\nin such behaviour there are two factors: (1) an incipient variation in\r\nthe line of such behaviour, and (2) an acquired modification by which\r\nthe behaviour is carried further along the same line. Under natural\r\nselection those organisms in which the two factors coöperate are\r\nlikely to survive. Under artificial selection they are deliberately\r\nchosen out from among the rest.\r\n\r\nOrganic selection has been termed a compromise between the more\r\nstrictly Darwinian and the Lamarckian principles of interpretation.\r\nBut it is not in any sense a compromise. The principle of\r\ninterpretation of that which is instinctive and hereditary is wholly\r\nDarwinian. It is true that some of the facts of observation relied\r\nupon by Lamarckians are introduced. For Lamarckians however the\r\nmodifications which are admittedly factors in survival, are regarded\r\nas the parents of inherited variations; for believers in organic\r\nselection they are only the foster-parents or nurses. It is because\r\norganic selection is the direct outcome of and a natural extension of\r\nDarwin's cardinal thesis that some reference to it here is\r\njustifiable. The matter may be put with the utmost brevity as follows:\r\n(1) Variations (V) occur, some of which are in the direction of\r\nincreased adaptation (+), others in the direction of decreased\r\nadaptation (-).\r\n\r\n(2) Acquired modifications (M) also occur. Some of these are in the\r\ndirection of increased accommodation to circumstances (+), while\r\nothers are in the direction of diminished accommodation (-). Four\r\nmajor combinations are\r\n\r\n   (_b_) + V with - M,      (_c_) - V with + M,\r\n\r\n   (_a_) + V with + M,      (_d_) - V with - M.\r\n\r\nOf these (_d_) must inevitably be eliminated while (_a_) are selected.\r\nThe predominant survival of (_a_) entails the survival of the adaptive\r\nvariations which are inherited. The contributory acquisitions (+ M)\r\nare not inherited; but there are none the less factors in determining\r\nthe survival of the coincident variations. It is surely abundantly\r\nclear that this is Darwinism and has no tincture of Lamarck's\r\nessential principle, the inheritance of acquired characters.\r\n\r\nWhether Darwin himself would have accepted this interpretation of some\r\nat least of the evidence put forward by Lamarckians is unfortunately a\r\nmatter of conjecture. The fact remains that in his interpretation of\r\ninstinct and in allied questions he accepted the inheritance of\r\nindividually acquired modifications of behaviour and structure.\r\n\r\nDarwin was chiefly concerned with instinct from the biological rather\r\nthan from the psychological point of view. Indeed it must be confessed\r\nthat, from the latter standpoint, his conception of instinct as a\r\n\"mental faculty\" which \"impels\" an animal to the performance of\r\ncertain actions, scarcely affords a satisfactory basis for genetic\r\ntreatment. To carry out the spirit of Darwin's teaching it is\r\nnecessary to link more closely biological and psychological evolution.\r\nThe first step towards this is to interpret the phenomena of\r\ninstinctive behaviour in terms of stimulation and response. It may be\r\nwell to take a particular case. Swimming on the part of a duckling is,\r\nfrom the biological point of view, a typical example of instinctive\r\nbehaviour. Gently lower a recently hatched bird into water:\r\ncoordinated movements of the limbs follow in rhythmical sequence. The\r\nbehaviour is new to the individual though it is no doubt closely\r\nrelated to that of walking, which is no less instinctive. There is a\r\ngroup of stimuli afforded by the \"presentation\" which results from\r\npartial immersion: upon this there follows as a complex response an\r\napplication of the functional activities in swimming; the sequence of\r\nadaptive application on the appropriate presentation is determined by\r\nracial preparation. We know, it is true, but little of the\r\nphysiological details of what takes place in the central nervous\r\nsystem; but in broad outline the nature of the organic mechanism and\r\nthe manner of its functioning may at least be provisionally\r\nconjectured in the present state of physiological knowledge. Similarly\r\nin the case of the pecking of newly-hatched chicks; there is a visual\r\npresentation, there is probably a coöperating group of stimuli from\r\nthe alimentary tract in need of food, there is an adaptive application\r\nof the activities in a definite mode of behaviour. Like data are\r\nafforded in a great number of cases of instinctive procedure,\r\nsometimes occurring very early in life, not infrequently deferred\r\nuntil the organism is more fully developed, but all of them dependent\r\nupon racial preparation. No doubt there is some range of variation in\r\nthe behaviour, just such variation as the theory of natural selection\r\ndemands. But there can be no question that the higher animals inherit\r\na bodily organisation and a nervous system, the functional working of\r\nwhich gives rise to those inherited modes of behaviour which are\r\ntermed instinctive.\r\n\r\nIt is to be noted that the term \"instinctive\" is here employed in the\r\nadjectival form as a descriptive heading under which may be grouped\r\nmany and various modes of behaviour due to racial preparation. We\r\nspeak of these as inherited; but in strictness what is transmitted\r\nthrough heredity is the complex of anatomical and physiological\r\nconditions under which, in appropriate circumstances, the organism so\r\nbehaves. So far the term \"instinctive\" has a restricted biological\r\nconnotation in terms of behaviour. But the connecting link between\r\nbiological evolution and psychological evolution is to be sought,--as\r\nDarwin fully realised,--in the phenomena of instinct, broadly\r\nconsidered. The term \"instinctive\" has also a psychological\r\nconnotation. What is that connotation?\r\n\r\nLet us take the case of the swimming duckling or the pecking chick,\r\nand fix our attention on the first instinctive performance. Grant that\r\njust as there is, strictly speaking, no inherited behaviour, but only\r\nthe conditions which render such behaviour under appropriate\r\ncircumstances possible; so too there is no inherited experience, but\r\nonly the conditions which render such experience possible; then the\r\ncerebral conditions in both cases are the same. The biological\r\nbehaviour-complex, including the total stimulation and the total\r\nresponse with the intervening or resultant processes in the sensorium,\r\nis accompanied by an experience-complex including the initial\r\nstimulation-consciousness and resulting response-consciousness. In the\r\nexperience-complex are comprised data which in psychological analysis\r\nare grouped under the headings of cognition, affective tone and\r\nconation. But the complex is probably experienced as an unanalysed\r\nwhole. If then we use the term \"instinctive\" so as to comprise all\r\ncongenital modes of behaviour which contribute to experience, we are\r\nin a position to grasp the view that the net result in consciousness\r\nconstitutes what we may term the primary tissue of experience. To the\r\ndevelopment of this experience each instinctive act contributes. The\r\nnature and manner of organisation of this primary tissue of experience\r\nare dependent on inherited biological aptitudes; but they are from the\r\noutset onwards subject to secondary development dependent on acquired\r\naptitudes. Biological values are supplemented by psychological values\r\nin terms of satisfaction or the reverse.\r\n\r\nIn our study of instinct we have to select some particular phase of\r\nanimal behaviour and isolate it so far as is possible from the life of\r\nwhich it is a part. But the animal is a going concern, restlessly\r\nactive in many ways. Many instinctive performances, as Darwin pointed\r\nout,[166] are serial in their nature. But the whole of active life is\r\na serial and coordinated business. The particular instinctive\r\nperformance is only an episode in a life-history, and every mode of\r\nbehaviour is more or less closely correlated with other modes. This\r\ncoordination of behaviour is accompanied by a correlation of the modes\r\nof primary experience. We may classify the instinctive modes of\r\nbehaviour and their accompanying modes of instinctive experience under\r\nas many heads as may be convenient for our purposes of interpretation,\r\nand label them instincts of self-preservation, of pugnacity, of\r\nacquisition, the reproductive instincts, the parental instincts, and\r\nso forth. An instinct, in this sense of the term (for example the\r\nparental instinct), may be described as a specialised part of the\r\nprimary tissue of experience differentiated in relation to some\r\ndefinite biological end. Under such an instinct will fall a large\r\nnumber of particular and often well-defined modes of behaviour, each\r\nwith its own peculiar mode of experience.\r\n\r\nIt is no doubt exceedingly difficult as a matter of observation and of\r\ninference securely based thereon to distinguish what is primary from\r\nwhat is in part due to secondary acquisition--a fact which Darwin\r\nfully appreciated. Animals are educable in different degrees; but\r\nwhere they are educable they begin to profit by experience from the\r\nfirst. Only, therefore, on the occasion of the first instinctive act\r\nof a given type can the experience gained be regarded as _wholly_\r\nprimary; all subsequent performance is liable to be in some degree,\r\nsometimes more, sometimes less, modified by the acquired disposition\r\nwhich the initial behaviour engenders. But the early stages of\r\nacquisition are always along the lines predetermined by instinctive\r\ndifferentiation. It is the task of comparative psychology to\r\ndistinguish the primary tissue of experience from its secondary and\r\nacquired modifications. We cannot follow up the matter in further\r\ndetail. It must here suffice to suggest that this conception of\r\ninstinct as a primary form of experience lends itself better to\r\nnatural history treatment than Darwin's conception of an impelling\r\nforce, and that it is in line with the main trend of Darwin's thought.\r\n\r\nIn a characteristic work,--characteristic in wealth of detail, in\r\ncloseness and fidelity of observation, in breadth of outlook, in\r\ncandour and modesty,--Darwin dealt with _The Expression of the\r\nEmotions in Man and Animals_. Sir Charles Bell in his _Anatomy of\r\nExpression_ had contended that many of man's facial muscles had been\r\nspecially created for the sole purpose of being instrumental in the\r\nexpression of his emotions. Darwin claimed that a natural explanation,\r\nconsistent with the doctrine of evolution, could in many cases be\r\ngiven and would in other cases be afforded by an extension of the\r\nprinciples he advocated. \"No doubt,\" he said,[167] \"as long as man and\r\nall other animals are viewed as independent creations, an effectual\r\nstop is put to our natural desire to investigate as far as possible\r\nthe causes of Expression. By this doctrine, anything and everything\r\ncan be equally well explained.... With mankind, some expressions ...\r\ncan hardly be understood, except on the belief that man once existed\r\nin a much lower and animal-like condition. The community of certain\r\nexpressions in distinct though allied species ... is rendered somewhat\r\nmore intelligible, if we believe in their descent from a common\r\nprogenitor. He who admits on general grounds that the structure and\r\nhabits of all animals have been gradually evolved, will look at the\r\nwhole subject of Expression in a new and interesting light.\"\r\n\r\nDarwin relied on three principles of explanation. \"The first of these\r\nprinciples is, that movements which are serviceable in gratifying some\r\ndesire, or in relieving some sensation, if often repeated, become so\r\nhabitual that they are performed, whether or not of any service,\r\nwhenever the same desire or sensation is felt, even in a very weak\r\ndegree.\"[168] The modes of expression which fall under this head have\r\nbecome instinctive through the hereditary transmission of acquired\r\nhabit. \"As far as we can judge, only a few expressive movements are\r\nlearnt by each individual; that is, were consciously and voluntarily\r\nperformed during the early years of life for some definite object, or\r\nin imitation of others, and then became habitual. The far greater\r\nnumber of the movements of expression, and all the more important\r\nones, are innate or inherited; and such cannot be said to depend on\r\nthe will of the individual. Nevertheless, all those included under our\r\nfirst principle were at first voluntarily performed for a definite\r\nobject,--namely, to escape some danger, to relieve some distress, or\r\nto gratify some desire.\"[169]\r\n\r\n\"Our second principle is that of antithesis. The habit of voluntarily\r\nperforming opposite movements under opposite impulses has become\r\nfirmly established in us by the practice of our whole lives. Hence, if\r\ncertain actions have been regularly performed, in accordance with our\r\nfirst principle, under a certain frame of mind, there will be a strong\r\nand involuntary tendency to the performance of directly opposite\r\nactions, whether or not these are of any use, under the excitement of\r\nan opposite frame of mind.\"[170] This principle of antithesis has not\r\nbeen widely accepted. Nor is Darwin's own position easy to grasp.\r\n\r\n\"Our third principle,\" he says,[171] \"is the direct action of the\r\nexcited nervous system on the body, independently of the will, and\r\nindependently, in large part, of habit. Experience shows that\r\nnerve-force is generated and set free whenever the cerebro-spinal\r\nsystem is excited. The direction which this nerve-force follows is\r\nnecessarily determined by the lines of connection between the\r\nnerve-cells, with each other and with various parts of the body.\"\r\n\r\nLack of space prevents our following up the details of Darwin's\r\ntreatment of expression. Whether we accept or do not accept his three\r\nprinciples of explanation we must regard his work as a masterpiece of\r\ndescriptive analysis, packed full of observations possessing lasting\r\nvalue. For a further development of the subject it is essential that\r\nthe instinctive factors in expression should be more fully\r\ndistinguished from those which are individually acquired--a difficult\r\ntask--and that the instinctive factors should be rediscussed in the\r\nlight of modern doctrines of heredity, with a view to determining\r\nwhether Lamarckian inheritance, on which Darwin so largely relied, is\r\nnecessary for an interpretation of the facts.\r\n\r\nThe whole subject as Darwin realised is very complex. Even the term\r\n\"expression\" has a certain amount of ambiguity. When the emotion is in\r\nfull flood, the animal fights, flees, or faints. Is this full-tide\r\neffect to be regarded as expression; or are we to restrict the term to\r\nthe premonitory or residual effects--the bared canine when the\r\nfighting mood is being roused, the ruffled fur when reminiscent\r\nrepresentations of the object inducing anger cross the mind? Broadly\r\nconsidered both should be included. The activity of premonitory\r\nexpression as a means of communication was recognised by Darwin; he\r\nmight, perhaps, have emphasised it more strongly in dealing with the\r\nlower animals. Man so largely relies on a special means of\r\ncommunication, that of language, that he sometimes fails to realise\r\nthat for animals with their keen powers of perception, and dependent\r\nas they are on such means of communication, the more strictly\r\nbiological means of expression are full of subtle suggestiveness. Many\r\nmodes of expression, otherwise useless, are signs of behaviour that\r\nmay be anticipated,--signs which stimulate the appropriate attitude of\r\nresponse. This would not, however, serve to account for the utility of\r\nthe organic accompaniments--heart-affection, respiratory changes,\r\nvaso-motor effects and so forth, together with heightened muscular\r\ntone,--on all of which Darwin lays stress[172] under his third\r\nprinciple. The biological value of all this is, however, of great\r\nimportance, though Darwin was hardly in a position to take it fully\r\ninto account.\r\n\r\nHaving regard to the instinctive and hereditary factors of emotional\r\nexpression we may ask whether Darwin's third principle does not alone\r\nsuffice as an explanation. Whether we admit or reject Lamarckian\r\ninheritance it would appear that all hereditary expression must be due\r\nto pre-established connections within the central nervous system and\r\nto a transmitted provision for coordinated response under the\r\nappropriate stimulation. If this be so, Darwin's first and second\r\nprinciples are subordinate and ancillary to the third, an expression,\r\nso far as it is instinctive or heredity, being \"the direct result of\r\nthe constitution of the nervous system.\"\r\n\r\nDarwin accepted the emotions themselves as hereditary or acquired\r\nstates of mind and devoted his attention to their expression. But\r\nthese emotions themselves are genetic products and as such dependent\r\non organic conditions. It remained, therefore, for psychologists who\r\naccepted evolution and sought to build on biological foundations to\r\ntrace the genesis of these modes of animal and human experience. The\r\nsubject has been independently developed by Professors Lange and\r\nJames;[173] and some modification of their view is regarded by many\r\nevolutionists as affording the best explanation of the facts. We must\r\nfix our attention on the lower emotions, such as anger or fear, and on\r\ntheir first occurrence in the life of the individual organism. It is a\r\nmatter of observation that if a group of young birds which have been\r\nhatched in an incubator are frightened by an appropriate presentation,\r\nauditory or visual, they instinctively respond in special ways. If we\r\nspeak of this response as the expression, we find that there are many\r\nfactors. There are certain visible modes of behaviour, crouching at\r\nonce, scattering and then crouching, remaining motionless, the braced\r\nmuscles sustaining an attitude of arrest, and so forth, There are also\r\ncertain visceral or organic effects, such as affections of the heart\r\nand respiration. These can be readily observed by taking the young\r\nbird in the hand. Other effects cannot be readily observed; vaso-motor\r\nchanges, affections of the alimentary canal, the skin and so forth.\r\nNow the essence of the James-Lange view, as applied to these\r\ncongenital effects, is that though we are justified in speaking of\r\nthem as effects of the stimulation, we are not justified, without\r\nfurther evidence, in speaking of them as effects of the emotional\r\nstate. May it not rather be that the emotion as a primary mode of\r\nexperience is the concomitant of the net result of the organic\r\nsituation--the initial presentation, the instinctive mode of\r\nbehaviour, the visceral disturbances?\r\n\r\nAccording to this interpretation the primary tissue of experience of\r\nthe emotional order, felt as an unanalysed complex, is generated by\r\nthe stimulation of the sensorium by afferent or incoming physiological\r\nimpulses from the special senses, from the organs concerned in the\r\nresponsive behaviour, from the viscere and vaso-motor system.\r\n\r\nSome psychologists, however, contend that the emotional experience is\r\ngenerated in the sensorium prior to, and not subsequent to, the\r\nbehaviour-response and the visceral disturbances. It is a direct and\r\nnot an indirect outcome of the presentation to the special senses. Be\r\nthis as it may, there is a growing tendency to bring into the closest\r\npossible relation, or even to identify, instinct and emotion in their\r\nprimary genesis. The central core of all such interpretations is that\r\ninstinctive behaviour and experience, its emotional accompaniments,\r\nand its expression, are but different aspects of the outcome of the\r\nsame organic occurrences. Such emotions are, therefore, only a\r\ndistinguishable aspect of the primary tissue of experience and exhibit\r\na like differentiation. Here again a biological foundation is laid for\r\na psychological doctrine of the mental development of the individual.\r\n\r\nThe intimate relation between emotion as a psychological mode of\r\nexperience and expression as a group of organic conditions has an\r\nimportant bearing on biological interpretation. The emotion, as the\r\npsychological accompaniment of orderly disturbances in the central\r\nnervous system, profoundly influences behaviour and often renders it\r\nmore vigourous and more effective. The utility of the emotions in the\r\nstruggle for existence can, therefore, scarcely be over-estimated.\r\nJust as keenness of perception has survival-value; just as it is\r\nobviously subject to variation; just as it must be enhanced under\r\nnatural selection, whether individually acquired increments are\r\ninherited or not; and just as its value lies not only in this or that\r\nspecial perceptive act but in its importance for life as a whole; so\r\nthe vigourous effectiveness of activity has survival-value; it is\r\nsubject to variation; it must be enhanced under natural selection; and\r\nits importance lies not only in particular modes of behaviour but in\r\nits value for life as a whole. If emotion and its expression as a\r\ncongenital endowment are but different aspects of the same biological\r\noccurrence; and if this is a powerful supplement to vigour\r\neffectiveness and persistency of behaviour, it must on Darwin's\r\nprinciples be subject to natural selection.\r\n\r\nIf we include under the expression of the emotions not only the\r\npremonitory symptoms of the initial phases of the organic and mental\r\nstate, not only the signs or conditions of half-tide emotion, but the\r\nfull-tide manifestation of an emotion which dominates the situation,\r\nwe are naturally led on to the consideration of many of the phenomena\r\nwhich are discussed under the head of sexual selection. The subject is\r\ndifficult and complex, and it was treated by Darwin with all the\r\nstrength he could summon to the task. It can only be dealt with here\r\nfrom a special point of view--that which may serve to illustrate the\r\ninfluence of certain mental factors on the course of evolution. From\r\nthis point of view too much stress can scarcely be laid on the\r\ndominance of emotion during the period of courtship and pairing in the\r\nmore highly organised animals. It is a period of maximum vigour,\r\nmaximum activity, and, correlated with special modes of behaviour and\r\nspecial organic and visceral accompaniments, a period also of maximum\r\nemotional excitement. The combats of males, their dances and aerial\r\nevolutions, their elaborate behaviour and display, or the flood of\r\nsong in birds, are emotional expressions which are at any rate\r\ncoincident in time with sexual periodicity. From the combat of the\r\nmales there follows on Darwin's principles the elimination of those\r\nwhich are deficient in bodily vigour, deficient in special structures,\r\noffensive or protective, which contribute to success, deficient in the\r\nemotional supplement of which persistent and whole-hearted fighting is\r\nthe expression, and deficient in alertness and skill which are the\r\noutcome of the psychological development of the powers of perception.\r\nFew biologists question that we have here a mode of selection of much\r\nimportance, though its influence on psychological evolution often\r\nfails to receive its due emphasis. Mr. Wallace[174] regards it as \"a\r\nform of natural selection\"; \"to it,\" he says, \"we must impute the\r\ndevelopment of the exceptional strength, size, and activity of the\r\nmale, together with the possession of special offensive and defensive\r\nweapons, and of all other characters which arise from the development\r\nof these or are correlated with them.\" So far there is little\r\ndisagreement among the followers of Darwin--for Mr. Wallace, with fine\r\nmagnanimity, has always preferred to be ranked as such,\r\nnotwithstanding his right, on which a smaller man would have\r\nconstantly insisted, to the claim of independent originator of the\r\ndoctrine of natural selection. So far with regard to sexual selection\r\nDarwin and Mr. Wallace are agreed; so far and no farther. For Darwin,\r\nsays Mr. Wallace,[175] \"has extended the principle into a totally\r\ndifferent field of action, which has none of that character of\r\nconstancy and of inevitable result that attaches to natural selection,\r\nincluding male rivalry; for by far the larger portion of the\r\nphenomena, which he endeavours to explain by the direct action of\r\nsexual selection, can only be so explained on the hypothesis that the\r\nimmediate agency is female choice or preference. It is to this that he\r\nimputes the origin of all secondary sexual characters other than\r\nweapons of offence and defence.... In this extension of sexual\r\nselection to include the action of female choice or preference, and in\r\nthe attempt to give to that choice such wide-reaching effects, I am\r\nunable to follow him more than a very little way.\"\r\n\r\nInto the details of Mr. Wallace's criticisms it is impossible to enter\r\nhere. We cannot discuss either the mode of origin of the variations in\r\nstructure which have rendered secondary sexual characters possible or\r\nthe modes of selection other than sexual which have rendered them,\r\nwithin narrow limits, specifically constant. Mendelism and mutation\r\ntheories may have something to say on the subject when these theories\r\nhave been more fully correlated with the basal principles of\r\nselection. It is noteworthy that Mr. Wallace says:[176] \"Besides the\r\nacquisition of weapons by the male for the purpose of fighting with\r\nother males, there are some other sexual characters which may have\r\nbeen produced by natural selection. Such are the various sounds and\r\nodours which are peculiar to the male, and which serve as a call to\r\nthe female or as an indication of his presence. These are evidently a\r\nvaluable addition to the means of recognition of the two sexes, and\r\nare a further indication, that the pairing season has arrived; and the\r\nproduction, intensification, and differentiation of these sounds and\r\nodours are clearly within the power of natural selection. The same\r\nremark will apply to the peculiar calls of birds, and even to the\r\nsinging of the males.\" Why the same remark should not apply to their\r\ncolours and adornments is not obvious. What is obvious is that \"means\r\nof recognition\" and \"indication that the pairing season has arrived\"\r\nare dependent on the perceptive powers of the female who recognises\r\nand for whom the indication has meaning. The hypothesis of female\r\npreference, stripped of the aesthetic surplusage which is\r\npsychologically both unnecessary and unproven, is really only\r\ndifferent in degree from that which Mr. Wallace admits in principle\r\nwhen he says that it is probable that the female is pleased or excited\r\nby the display.\r\n\r\nLet us for our present purpose leave on one side and regard as _sub\r\njudice_ the question whether the specific details of secondary sexual\r\ncharacters are the outcome of female choice. For us the question is\r\nwhether certain psychological accompaniments of the pairing situation\r\nhave influenced the course of evolution and whether these\r\npsychological accompaniments are themselves the outcome of evolution.\r\nAs a matter of observation, specially differentiated modes of\r\nbehaviour, often very elaborate, frequently requiring highly developed\r\nskill, and apparently highly charged with emotional tone, are the\r\nprecursors of pairing. They are generally confined to the males, whose\r\nfierce combats during the period of sexual activity are part of the\r\nemotional manifestation. It is inconceivable that they have no\r\nbiological meaning; and it is difficult to conceive that they have any\r\nother biological end than to evoke in the generally more passive\r\nfemale the pairing impulse. They, are based on instinctive foundations\r\ningrained in the nervous constitution through natural (or may we not\r\nsay sexual?) selection in virtue of their profound utility. They are\r\ncalled into play by a specialised presentation such as the sight or\r\nthe scent of the female at, or a little in advance of, a critical\r\nperiod of the physiological rhythm. There is no necessity that the\r\nmale should have any knowledge of the end to which his strenuous\r\nactivity leads up. In presence of the female there is an elaborate\r\napplication of all the energies of behaviour, just because ages of\r\nracial preparation have made him biologically and emotionally what he\r\nis--a functionally sexual male that must dance or sing or go through\r\nhereditary movements of display, when the appropriate stimulation\r\ncomes. Of course after the first successful courtship his future\r\nbehaviour will be in some degree modified by his previous experience.\r\nNo doubt during his first courtship he is gaining the primary data of\r\na peculiarly rich experience, instinctive and emotional. But the\r\nbiological foundations of the behaviour of courtship are laid in the\r\nhereditary coordinations. It would seem that in some cases, not indeed\r\nin all, perhaps especially in those cases in which secondary sexual\r\nbehaviour is most highly evolved,--correlative with the ardour of the\r\nmale is a certain amount of reluctance in the female. The pairing act\r\non her part only takes place after prolonged stimulation, for\r\naffording which the behaviour of male courtship is the requisite\r\npresentation. The most vigourous, defiant and mettlesome male is\r\npreferred just because he alone affords a contributory stimulation\r\nadequate to evoke the pairing impulse with its attendant emotional\r\ntone.\r\n\r\nIt is true that this places female preference or choice on a much\r\nlower psychological plane than Darwin in some passages seems to\r\ncontemplate where, for example, he says that the female appreciates\r\nthe display of the male and places to her credit a taste for the\r\nbeautiful. But Darwin himself distinctly states[177] that \"it is not\r\nprobable that she consciously deliberates; but she is most excited or\r\nattracted by the most beautiful, or melodious, or gallant males.\" The\r\nview here put forward, which has been developed by Prof. Groos,[178]\r\ntherefore seems to have Darwin's own sanction. The phenomena are not\r\nonly biological; there are psychological elements as well. One can\r\nhardly suppose that the female is unconscious of the male's presence;\r\nthe final yielding must surely be accompanied by heightened emotional\r\ntone. Whether we call it choice or not is merely a matter of\r\ndefinition of terms. The behaviour is in part determined by\r\nsupplementary psychological values. Prof. Groos regards the coyness of\r\nfemales as \"a most efficient means of preventing the too early and too\r\nfrequent yielding to the sexual impulse.\"[179] Be that as it may, it\r\nis, in any case, if we grant the facts, a means through which male\r\nsexual behaviour with all its biological and psychological\r\nimplications, is raised to a level otherwise perhaps unattainable by\r\nnatural means, while in the female it affords opportunities for the\r\ndevelopment in the individual and evolution in the race of what we may\r\nfollow Darwin in calling appreciation, if we empty this word of the\r\naesthetic implications which have gathered round it in the mental life\r\nof man.\r\n\r\nRegarded from this standpoint of sexual selection, broadly considered,\r\nhas probably been of great importance. The psychological\r\naccompaniments of the pairing situation have profoundly influenced the\r\ncourse of biological evolution and are themselves the outcome of that\r\nevolution.\r\n\r\nDarwin makes only passing reference to those modes of behaviour in\r\nanimals which go by the name of play. \"Nothing,\" he says,[180] \"is\r\nmore common than for animals to take pleasure in practising whatever\r\ninstinct they follow at other times for some real good.\" This is one\r\nof the very numerous cases in which a hint of the master has served to\r\nstimulate research in his disciples. It was left to Prof. Groos to\r\ndevelop this subject on evolutionary lines and to elaborate in a\r\nmasterly manner Darwin's suggestion. \"The utility of play,\" he\r\nsays,[181] \"is incalculable. This utility consists in the practice and\r\nexercise it affords for some of the more important duties of\r\nlife,\"--that is to say, for the performance of activities which will\r\nin adult life be essential to survival. He urges[182] that \"the play\r\nof young animals has its origin in the fact that certain very\r\nimportant instincts appear at a time when the animal does not\r\nseriously need them.\" It is, however, questionable whether any\r\ninstincts appear at a time when they are not needed. And it is\r\nquestionable whether the instinctive and emotional attitude of the\r\nplay-fight, to take one example, can be identified with those which\r\naccompany fighting in earnest, though no doubt they are closely\r\nrelated and have some common factors. It is probable that play, as\r\npreparatory behaviour, differs in biological detail (as it almost\r\ncertainly does in emotional attributes) from the earnest of after-life\r\nand that it has been evolved through differentiation and integration\r\nof the primary tissue of experience, as a preparation through which\r\ncertain essential modes of skill may be acquired--those animals in\r\nwhich the preparatory play-propensity was not inherited in due force\r\nand requisite amount being subsequently eliminated in the struggle for\r\nexistence. In any case there is little question that Prof. Groos is\r\nright in basing the play-propensity on instinctive foundations.[183]\r\nNone the less, as he contends, the essential biological value of play\r\nis that it is a means of training the educable nerve-tissue, of\r\ndeveloping that part of the brain which is modified by experience and\r\nwhich thus acquires new characters, of elaborating the secondary\r\ntissue of experience on the predetermined lines of instinctive\r\ndifferentiation and thus furthering the psychological activities which\r\nare included under the comprehensive term \"intelligent.\"\r\n\r\nIn _The Descent of Man_ Darwin dealt at some length with intelligence\r\nand the higher mental faculties.[184] His object, he says, is to show\r\nthat there is no fundamental difference between man and the higher\r\nmammals in their mental faculties; that these faculties are variable\r\nand the variations tend to be inherited; and that under natural\r\nselection beneficial variations of all kinds will have been preserved\r\nand injurious ones eliminated.\r\n\r\nDarwin was too good an observer and too honest a man to minimise the\r\n\"enormous difference\" between the level of mental attainment of\r\ncivilised man and that reached by any animal. His contention was that\r\nthe difference, great as it is, is one of degree and not of kind. He\r\nrealised that, in the development of the mental faculties of man, new\r\nfactors in evolution have supervened--factors which play but a\r\nsubordinate and subsidiary part in animal intelligence.\r\nIntercommunication by means of language, approbation and blame, and\r\nall that arises out of reflective thought, are but foreshadowed in the\r\nmental life of animals. Still he contends that these may be explained\r\non the doctrine of evolution. He urges[185] \"that man is variable in\r\nbody and mind; and that the variations are induced, either directly or\r\nindirectly, by the same general causes, and obey the same general\r\nlaws, as with the lower animals.\" He correlates mental development\r\nwith the evolution of the brain.[186] \"As the various mental faculties\r\ngradually developed themselves, the brain would almost certainly\r\nbecome larger. No one, I presume, doubts that the large proportion\r\nwhich the size of man's brain bears to his body, compared to the same\r\nproportion in the gorilla or orang, is closely connected with his\r\nhigher mental powers.\" \"With respect to the lower animals,\" he\r\nsays,[187] \"M. E. Lartet,[188] by comparing the crania of tertiary and\r\nrecent mammals belonging to the same groups, has come to the\r\nremarkable conclusion that the brain is generally larger and the\r\nconvolutions are more complex in the more recent form.\"\r\n\r\nSir E. Ray Lankester has sought to express in the simplest terms the\r\nimplications of the increase in size of the cerebrum. \"In what,\" he\r\nasks, \"does the advantage of a larger cerebral mass consist?\" \"Man,\"\r\nhe replies, \"is born with fewer ready-made tricks of the\r\nnerve-centres--these performances of an inherited nervous mechanism so\r\noften called by the ill-defined term 'instincts'--than are the monkeys\r\nor any other animal. Correlated with the absence of inherited\r\nready-made mechanism, man has a greater capacity of developing in the\r\ncourse of his individual growth similar nervous mechanisms (similar\r\nto but not identical with those of 'instinct') than any other\r\nanimal.... The power of being educated--'educability' as we may term\r\nit--is what man possesses in excess as compared with the apes. I think\r\nwe are justified in forming the hypothesis that it is this\r\n'educability' which is the correlative of the increased size of the\r\ncerebrum.\" There has been natural selection of the more educable\r\nanimals, for \"the character which we describe as 'educability' can be\r\ntransmitted, it is a congenital character. But the _results_ of\r\neducation can _not_ be transmitted. In each generation they have to be\r\nacquired afresh, and with increased 'educability' they are more\r\nreadily acquired and a larger variety of them.... The fact is that\r\nthere is no community between the mechanisms of instinct and the\r\nmechanisms of intelligence, and that the latter are later in the\r\nhistory of the evolution of the brain than the former and can only\r\ndevelop in proportion as the former become feeble and defective.\"[189]\r\n\r\nIn this statement we have a good example of the further development of\r\nviews which Darwin foreshadowed but did not thoroughly work out. It\r\nstates the biological case clearly and tersely. Plasticity of\r\nbehaviour in special accommodation to special circumstances is of\r\nsurvival value; it depends upon acquired characters; it is correlated\r\nwith increase in size and complexity of the cerebrum; under natural\r\nselection therefore the larger and more complex cerebrum as the organ\r\nof plastic behaviour has been the outcome of natural selection. We\r\nhave thus the biological foundations for a further development of\r\ngenetic psychology.\r\n\r\nThere are diversities of opinion, as Darwin showed, with regard to the\r\nrange of instinct in man and the higher animals as contrasted with\r\nlower types. Darwin himself said[190] that \"Man, perhaps, has somewhat\r\nfewer instincts than those possessed by the animals which come next to\r\nhim in the series.\" On the other hand, Prof. Wm. James says[191] that\r\nman is probably the animal with most instincts. The true position is\r\nthat man and the higher animals have fewer complete and self-sufficing\r\ninstincts than those which stand lower in the scale of mental\r\nevolution, but that they have an equally large or perhaps larger mass\r\nof instinctive raw material which may furnish the stuff to be\r\nelaborated by intelligent processes. There is, perhaps, a greater\r\nabundance of the primary tissue of experience to be refashioned and\r\nintegrated by secondary modification; there is probably the same\r\ndifferentiation in relation to the determining biological ends, but\r\nthere is at the outset less differentiation of the particular and\r\nspecific modes of behaviour. The specialised instinctive performances\r\nand their concomitant experience-complexes are at the outset more\r\nindefinite. Only through acquired connections, correlated with\r\nexperience, do they become definitely organised.\r\n\r\nThe full working-out of the delicate and subtle relationship of\r\ninstinct and educability--that is, of the hereditary and the acquired\r\nfactors in the mental life--is the task which lies before genetic and\r\ncomparative psychology. They interact throughout the whole of life,\r\nand their interactions are very complex. No one can read the chapters\r\nof _The Descent of Man_ which Darwin devotes to a consideration of the\r\nmental characters of man and animals without noticing, on the one\r\nhand, how sedulous he is in his search for hereditary foundations,\r\nand, on the other hand, how fully he realises the importance of\r\nacquired habits of mind. The fact that educability itself has innate\r\ntendencies--is in fact a partially differentiated educability--renders\r\nthe unravelling of the factors of mental progress all the more\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\nIn his comparison of the mental powers of men and animals it was\r\nessential that Darwin should lay stress on points of similarity rather\r\nthan on points of difference. Seeking to establish a doctrine of\r\nevolution, with its basal concept of continuity of process and\r\ncommunity of character, he was bound to render clear and to emphasise\r\nthe contention that the difference in mind between man and the higher\r\nanimals, great as it is, is one of degree and not of kind. To this end\r\nDarwin not only recorded a large number of valuable observations of\r\nhis own, and collected a considerable body of information from\r\nreliable sources, he presented the whole subject in a new light and\r\nshowed that a natural history of mind might be written and that this\r\nmethod of study offered a wide and rich field for investigation. Of\r\ncourse those who regarded the study of mind only as a branch of\r\nmetaphysics smiled at the philosophical ineptitude of the mere man of\r\nscience. But the investigation, on natural history lines, has been\r\nprosecuted with a large measure of success. Much indeed still remains\r\nto be done; for special training is required, and the workers are\r\nstill few. Promise for the future is however afforded by the fact that\r\ninvestigation is prosecuted on experimental lines and that something\r\nlike organised methods of research are taking form. There is now but\r\nlittle reliance on casual observations recorded by those who have not\r\nundergone the necessary discipline in these methods. There is also\r\nsome change of emphasis in formulating conclusions. Now that the\r\ngeneral evolutionary thesis is fully and freely accepted by those who\r\ncarry on such researches, more stress is laid on the differentiation\r\nof the stages of evolutionary advance than on the fact of their\r\nunderlying community of nature. The conceptual intelligence which is\r\nespecially characteristic of the higher mental procedure of man is\r\nmore firmly distinguished from the perceptual intelligence which he\r\nshares with the lower animals--distinguished now as a higher product\r\nof evolution, no longer as differing in origin or different in kind.\r\nSome progress has been made, on the one hand in rendering an account\r\nof intelligent profiting by experience under the guidance of pleasure\r\nand pain in the perceptual field, on lines predetermined by\r\ninstinctive differentiation for biological ends, and on the other hand\r\nin elucidating the method of conceptual thought employed, for\r\nexample, by the investigator himself in interpreting the perceptual\r\nexperience of the lower animals.\r\n\r\nThus there is a growing tendency to realise more fully that there are\r\ntwo orders of educability--first an educability of the perceptual\r\nintelligence based on the biological foundation of instinct, and\r\nsecondly an educability of the conceptual intelligence which\r\nrefashions and rearranges the data afforded by previous inheritance\r\nand acquisition. It is in relation to this second and higher order of\r\neducability that the cerebrum of man shows so large an increase of\r\nmass and a yet larger increase of effective surface through its rich\r\nconvolutions. It is through educability of this order that the human\r\nchild is brought intellectually and affectively into touch with the\r\nideal constructions by means of which man has endeavoured, with more\r\nor less success, to reach an interpretation of nature, and to guide\r\nthe course of the further evolution of his race--ideal constructions\r\nwhich form part of man's environment.\r\n\r\nIt formed no part of Darwin's purpose to consider, save in broad\r\noutline, the methods, or to discuss in any fulness of detail the\r\nresults of the process by which a differentiation of the mental\r\nfaculties of man from those of the lower animals has been brought\r\nabout--a differentiation the existence of which he again and again\r\nacknowledges. His purpose was rather to show that, notwithstanding\r\nthis differentiation, there is basal community in kind. This must be\r\nremembered in considering his treatment of the biological foundations\r\non which man's systems of ethics are built. He definitely stated that\r\nhe approached the subject \"exclusively from the side of natural\r\nhistory.\"[192] His general conclusion is that the moral sense is\r\nfundamentally identical with the social instincts, which have been\r\ndeveloped for the good of the community; and he suggests that the\r\nconcept which thus enables us to interpret the biological ground-plan\r\nof morals also enables us to frame a rational ideal of the moral end.\r\n\"As the social instincts,\" he says,[193] \"both of man and the lower\r\nanimals have no doubt been developed by nearly the same steps, it\r\nwould be advisable, if found practicable, to use the same definition\r\nin both cases, and to take as the standard of morality, the general\r\ngood or welfare of the community, rather than the general happiness.\"\r\nBut the kind of community for the good of which the social instincts\r\nof animals and primitive men were biologically developed may be\r\ndifferent from that which is the product of civilisation, as Darwin no\r\ndoubt realised. Darwin's contention was that conscience is a social\r\ninstinct and has been evolved because it is useful to the tribe in the\r\nstruggle for existence against other tribes. One the other hand J. S.\r\nMill urged that the moral feelings are not innate but acquired, and\r\nBain held the same view, believing that the moral sense is acquired by\r\neach individual during his life-time. Darwin, who notes[194] their\r\nopinion with his usual candour, adds that \"on the general theory of\r\nevolution this is at least extremely improbable.\" It is impossible to\r\nenter into the question here: much turns on the exact connotation of\r\nthe terms \"conscience\" and \"moral sense,\" and on the meaning we attach\r\nto the statement that the moral sense is fundamentally identical with\r\nthe social instincts.\r\n\r\nPresumably the majority of those who approach the subjects discussed\r\nin the third, fourth, and fifth chapters of _The Descent of Man_ in\r\nthe full conviction that mental phenomena, not less than organic\r\nphenomena, have a natural genesis, would, without hesitation, admit\r\nthat the intellectual and moral systems of civilised man are ideal\r\nconstructions, the products of conceptual thought, and that as such\r\nthey are, in their developed form, acquired. The moral sentiments are\r\nthe emotional analogues of highly developed concepts. This does not\r\nhowever imply that they are outside the range of natural history\r\ntreatment. Even though it may be desirable to differentiate the moral\r\nconduct of men from the social behaviour of animals (to which some\r\nsuch term as \"pre-moral\" or \"quasi-moral\" may be applied), still the\r\nfact remains that, as Darwin showed, there is abundant evidence of the\r\noccurrence of such social behaviour--social behaviour which, even\r\ngranted that it is in large part intelligently acquired, and is itself\r\nso far a product of educability, is of survival value. It makes for\r\nthat integration without which no social group could hold together and\r\nescape elimination. Furthermore, even if we grant that such behaviour\r\nis intelligently acquired, that is to say arises through the\r\nmodification of hereditary instincts and emotions, the fact remains\r\nthat only through these instinctive and emotional data is afforded the\r\nprimary tissue of the experience which is susceptible of such\r\nmodification.\r\n\r\nDarwin sought to show, and succeeded in showing, that for the\r\nintellectual and moral life there are instinctive foundations which a\r\nbiological treatment alone can disclose. It is true that he did not in\r\nall cases analytically distinguish the foundations from the\r\nsuperstructure. Even to-day we are scarcely in a position to do so\r\nadequately. But his treatment was of great value in giving an impetus\r\nto further research. This value indeed can scarcely be over-estimated.\r\nAnd when the natural history of the mental operations shall have been\r\nwritten, the cardinal fact will stand forth, that the instinctive and\r\nemotional foundations are the outcome of biological evolution and have\r\nbeen ingrained in the race through natural selection. We shall more\r\nclearly realise that educability itself is a product of natural\r\nselection, though the specific results acquired through cerebral\r\nmodifications are not transmitted through heredity. It will, perhaps,\r\nalso be realised that the instinctive foundations of social behaviour\r\nare, for us, somewhat out of date and have undergone but little change\r\nthroughout the progress of civilisation, because natural selection has\r\nlong since ceased to be the dominant factor in human progress. The\r\nhistory of human progress has been mainly the history of man's higher\r\neducability, the products of which he has projected on to his\r\nenvironment. This educability remains on the average what it was a\r\ndozen generations ago; but the thought-woven tapestry of his\r\nsurroundings is refashioned and improved by each succeeding\r\ngeneration. Few men have in greater measure enriched the\r\nthought-environment with which it is the aim of education to bring\r\neducable human beings into vital contact, than has Charles Darwin. His\r\nspecial field of work was the wide province of biology; but he did\r\nmuch to help us to realise that mental factors have contributed to\r\norganic evolution and that in man, the highest product of Evolution,\r\nthey have reached a position of unquestioned supremacy.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 153: _Origin of Species_ (6th edit.), p. 205.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 154: _Descent of man_ (2nd edit. 1888), Vol. I. p. 99;\r\nPopular edit. p. 99.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 155: _Ibid._ p. 99.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 156: _The Expression of the Emotions_ (2nd edit.), p. 32.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 157: _Descent of Man_, Vol. II. p. 435.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 158: _Ibid._ 437, 438.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 159: _Origin of Species_ (6th edit.), p. 205.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 160: _Origin of Species_ (6th edit.), p. 205.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 161: _Ibid._ p. 233.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 162: _Ibid._ p. 205.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 163: _Origin of Species_ (6th edit.), p. 233.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 164: _Origin of Species_, pp. 210, 211.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 165: Independently suggested, on somewhat different lines,\r\nby Profs.

HÖFFDING\r\n\r\n_Professor of Philosophy in the University of Copenhagen_\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to draw a sharp line between philosophy and natural\r\nscience. The naturalist who introduces a new principle, or\r\ndemonstrates a fact which throws a new light on existence, not only\r\nrenders an important service to philosophy but is himself a\r\nphilosopher in the broader sense of the word. The aim of philosophy in\r\nthe stricter sense is to attain points of view from which the\r\nfundamental phenomena and the principles of the special sciences can\r\nbe seen in their relative importance and connection. But philosophy in\r\nthis stricter sense has always been influenced by philosophy in the\r\nbroader sense. Greek philosophy came under the influence of logic and\r\nmathematics, modern philosophy under the influence of natural science.\r\nThe name of Charles Darwin stands with those of Galileo, Newton, and\r\nRobert Mayer--names which denote new problems and great alterations in\r\nour conception of the universe.\r\n\r\nFirst of all we must lay stress on Darwin's own personality. His deep love\r\nof truth, his indefatigable inquiry, his wide horizon, and his steady\r\nself-criticism make him a scientific model, even if his results and\r\ntheories should eventually come to possess mainly an historical interest.\r\nIn the intellectual domain the primary object is to reach high summits\r\nfrom which wide surveys are possible, to reach them toiling honestly\r\nupwards by the way of experience, and then not to turn dizzy when a summit\r\nis gained. Darwinians have sometimes turned dizzy, but Darwin never. He saw\r\nfrom the first the great importance of his hypothesis, not only because of\r\nits solution of the old problem as to the value of the concept of species,\r\nnot only because of the grand picture of natural evolution which it\r\nunrolls, but also because of the life and inspiration its method would\r\nimpart to the study of comparative anatomy, of instinct and of heredity,\r\nand finally because of the influence it would exert on the whole conception\r\nof existence. He wrote in his note-book in the year 1837: \"My theory would\r\ngive zest to recent and fossil comparative anatomy; it would lead to the\r\nstudy of instinct, heredity, and mind-heredity, whole [of]\r\nmetaphysics.\"[195]\r\n\r\nWe can distinguish four main points in which Darwin's investigations\r\npossess philosophical importance.\r\n\r\nThe evolution hypothesis is much older than Darwin; it is, indeed, one\r\nof the oldest guessings of human thought. In the eighteenth century is\r\nwas put forward by Diderot and Lamettrie and suggested by Kant (1786).\r\nAs we shall see later, it was held also by several philosophers in the\r\nfirst half of the nineteenth century. In his preface to _The Origin of\r\nSpecies_, Darwin mentions the naturalists who were his forerunners.\r\nBut he has set forth the hypothesis of evolution in so energetic and\r\nthorough a manner that it perforce attracts the attention of all\r\nthoughtful men in a much higher degree than it did before the\r\npublication of the _Origin_.\r\n\r\nAnd further, the importance of his teaching rests on the fact that he,\r\nmuch more than his predecessors, even than Lamarck, sought a\r\nfoundation for his hypothesis in definite facts. Modern science began\r\nby demanding--with Kepler and Newton--evidence of _varae causae_; this\r\ndemand Darwin industriously set himself to satisfy--hence the wealth\r\nof material which he collected by his observations and his\r\nexperiments. He not only revived an old hypothesis, but he saw the\r\nnecessity of verifying it by facts. Whether the special cause on which\r\nhe founded the explanation of the origin of species--Natural\r\nSelection--is sufficient, is now a subject of discussion. He himself\r\nhad some doubt in regard to this question, and the criticisms which\r\nare directed against his hypothesis hit Darwinism rather than Darwin.\r\nIn his indefatigable search for empirical evidence he is a model even\r\nfor his antagonists: he has compelled them to approach the problems of\r\nlife along other lines than those which were formerly followed.\r\n\r\nWhether the special cause to which Darwin appealed is sufficient or not, at\r\nleast to it is probably due the greater part of the influence which he has\r\nexerted on the general trend of thought. \"Struggle for existence\" and\r\n\"natural selection\" are principles which have been applied, more or less,\r\nin every department of thought. Recent research, it is true, has discovered\r\ngreater empirical discontinuity--leaps, \"mutations\"--whereas Darwin\r\nbelieved in the importance of small variations slowly accumulated. It has\r\nalso been shown by the experimental method, which in recent biological work\r\nhas succeeded Darwin's more historical method, that types once constituted\r\npossess great permanence, the fluctuations being restricted within clearly\r\ndefined boundaries. The problem has become more precise, both as to\r\nvariation and as to heredity. The inner conditions of life have in both\r\nrespects shown a greater independence than Darwin had supposed in his\r\ntheory, though he always admitted that the cause of variation was to him a\r\ngreat enigma, \"a most perplexing problem,\" and that the struggle for life\r\ncould only occur where variation existed. But, at any rate, it was of the\r\ngreatest importance that Darwin gave a living impression of the struggle\r\nfor life which is everywhere going on, and to which even the highest forms\r\nof existence must be amenable. The philosophical importance of these ideas\r\ndoes not stand or fall with the answer to the question, whether natural\r\nselection is a sufficient explanation of the origin of species or not it\r\nhas an independent, positive value for everyone who will observe life and\r\nreality with an unbiased mind.\r\n\r\nIn accentuating the struggle for life Darwin stands as a\r\ncharacteristically English thinker: he continues a train of ideas\r\nwhich Hobbes and Malthus had already begun. Moreover in his critical\r\nviews as to the conception of species he had English forerunners; in\r\nthe middle ages Occam and Duns Scotus, in the eighteenth century\r\nBerkeley and Hume. In his moral philosophy, as we shall see later, he\r\nis an adherent of the school which is represented by Hutcheson, Home\r\nand Adam Smith. Because he is no philosopher in the stricter sense of\r\nthe term, it is of great interest to see that his attitude of mind is\r\nthat of the great thinkers of his nation.\r\n\r\nIn considering Darwin's influence on philosophy we will begin with an\r\nexamination of the attitude of philosophy to the conception of\r\nevolution at the time when _The Origin of Species_ appeared. We will\r\nthen examine the effects which the theory of evolution, and especially\r\nthe idea of the struggle for life, has had, and naturally must have,\r\non the discussion of philosophical problems.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nWhen _The Origin of Species_ appeared fifty years ago Romantic\r\nspeculation, Schelling's and Hegel's philosophy, still reigned on the\r\ncontinent, while in England Positivism, the philosophy of Comte and\r\nStuart Mill, represented the most important trend of thought. German\r\nspeculation had much to say on evolution, it even pretended to be a\r\nphilosophy of evolution. But then the word \"evolution\" was to be taken\r\nin an ideal, not in a real, sense. To speculative thought the forms\r\nand types of nature formed a system of ideas, within which any form\r\ncould lead us by continuous transitions to any other. It was a\r\nclassificatory system which was regarded as a divine world of thought\r\nor images, within which metamorphoses could go on--a condition\r\ncomparable with that in the mind of the poet when one image follows\r\nanother with imperceptible changes. Goethe's ideas of evolution, as\r\nexpressed in his _Metamorphosen der Pflanzen und der Thiere_, belong\r\nto this category; it is, therefore, incorrect to call him a forerunner\r\nof Darwin. Schelling and Hegel held the same idea; Hegel expressly\r\nrejected the conception of a real evolution in time as coarse and\r\nmaterialistic. \"Nature,\" he says, \"is to be considered as a _system of\r\nstages_, the one necessarily arising from the other, and being the\r\nnearest truth of that from which it proceeds; but not in such a way\r\nthat the one is _naturally_ generated by the other; on the contrary\r\n[their connection lies] in the inner idea which is the ground of\r\nnature. The _metamorphosis_ can be ascribed only to the notion as\r\nsuch, because it alone is evolution.... It has been a clumsy idea in\r\nthe older as well as in the newer philosophy of nature, to regard the\r\ntransformation and the transition from one natural form and sphere to\r\na higher as an outward and actual production.\"[196]\r\n\r\nThe only one of the philosophers of Romanticism who believed in a\r\nreal, historical evolution, a real production of new species, was\r\nOken.[197] Danish philosophers, such as Treschow (1812) and Sibbern\r\n(1846), have also broached the idea of an historical evolution of all\r\nliving beings from the lowest to the highest. Schopenhauer's\r\nphilosophy has a more realistic character than that of Schelling's and\r\nHegel's, his diametrical opposites, although he also belongs to the\r\nromantic school of thought. His philosophical and psychological views\r\nwere greatly influenced by French naturalists and philosophers,\r\nespecially by Cabanis and Lamarck. He praises the \"ever memorable\r\nLamarck,\" because he laid so much stress on the \"will to live.\" But he\r\nrepudiates as a \"wonderful error\" the idea that the organs of animals\r\nshould have reached their present perfection through a development in\r\ntime, during the course of innumerable generations. It was, he said, a\r\nconsequence of the low standard of contemporary French philosophy,\r\nthat Lamarck came to the idea of the construction of living beings in\r\ntime through succession![198]\r\n\r\nThe positivistic stream of thought was not more in favour of a real\r\nevolution than was the Romantic school. Its aim was to adhere to\r\npositive facts: it looked with suspicion on far-reaching speculation.\r\nComte laid great stress on the discontinuity found between the\r\ndifferent kingdoms of nature, as well as within each single kingdom.\r\nAs he regarded as unscientific every attempt to reduce the number of\r\nphysical forces, so he rejected entirely the hypothesis of Lamarck\r\nconcerning the evolution of species; the idea of species would in his\r\neyes absolutely lose its importance if a transition from species to\r\nspecies under the influence of conditions of life were admitted. His\r\ndisciples (Littré, Robin) continued to direct against Darwin the\r\npolemics which their master had employed against Lamarck. Stuart Mill,\r\nwho, in the theory of knowledge, represented the empirical or\r\npositivistic movement in philosophy--like his English forerunners from\r\nLocke to Hume--founded his theory of knowledge and morals on the\r\nexperience of the single individual. He sympathised with the theory of\r\nthe original likeness of all individuals and derived their\r\ndifferences, on which he practically and theoretically laid much\r\nstress, from the influence both of experience and education, and,\r\ngenerally, of physical and social causes. He admitted an individual\r\nevolution, and, in the human species, an evolution based on social\r\nprogress; but no physiological evolution of species. He was afraid\r\nthat the hypothesis of heredity would carry us back to the old theory\r\nof \"innate\" ideas.\r\n\r\nDarwin was more empirical than Comte and Mill; experience disclosed to\r\nhim a deeper continuity than they could find; closer than before the\r\nnature and fate of the single individual were shown to be interwoven\r\nin the great web binding the life of the species with nature as a\r\nwhole. And the continuity which so many idealistic philosophers could\r\nfind only in the world of thought, he showed to be present in the\r\nworld of reality.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nDarwin's energetic renewal of the old idea of evolution has its chief\r\nimportance in strengthening the conviction of this real continuity in\r\nthe world, of continuity in the series of form and events. It was a\r\ngreat support for all those who were prepared to base their conception\r\nof life on scientific grounds. Together with the recently discovered\r\nlaw of the conservation of energy, it helped to produce the great\r\nrealistic movement which characterises the last third of the\r\nnineteenth century. After the decline of the Romantic movement people\r\nwished to have firmer ground under their feet and reality now asserted\r\nitself in a more emphatic manner than in the period of Romanticism. It\r\nwas easy for Hegel to proclaim that \"the real\" was \"the rational,\" and\r\nthat \"the rational\" was \"the real\": reality itself existed for him\r\nonly in the interpretation of ideal reason, and if there was anything\r\nwhich could not be merged in the higher unity of thought, then it was\r\nonly an example of the \"impotence of nature to hold to the idea.\" But\r\nnow concepts are to be founded on nature and not on any system of\r\ncategories too confidently deduced _à priori_. The new devotion to\r\nnature had its recompense in itself, because the new points of view\r\nmade us see that nature could indeed \"hold to ideas,\" though perhaps\r\nnot to those which we had cogitated beforehand.\r\n\r\nA most important question for philosophers to answer was whether the\r\nnew views were compatible with an idealistic conception of life and\r\nexistence. Some proclaimed that we have now no need of any philosophy\r\nbeyond the principles of the conservation of matter and energy and the\r\nprinciple of natural evolution: existence should and could be\r\ndefinitely and completely explained by the laws of material nature.\r\nBut abler thinkers saw that the thing was not so simple. They were\r\nprepared to give the new views their just place and to examine what\r\nalterations the old views must undergo in order to be brought into\r\nharmony with the new data.\r\n\r\nThe realistic character of Darwin's theory was shown not only in the\r\nidea of natural continuity, but also, and not least, in the idea of\r\nthe cause whereby organic life advances step by step. This idea--the\r\nidea of the struggle for life--implied that nothing could persist, if\r\nit had no power to maintain itself under the given conditions. Inner\r\nvalue alone does not decide. Idealism was here put to its hardest\r\ntrial. In continuous evolution it could perhaps still find an analogy\r\nto the inner evolution of ideas in the mind; but in the demand for\r\npower in order to struggle with outward conditions Realism seemed to\r\nannounce itself in its most brutal form. Every form of Idealism had to\r\nask itself seriously how it was going to \"struggle for life\" with this\r\nnew Realism.\r\n\r\nWe will now give a short account of the position which leading\r\nthinkers in different countries have taken up in regard to this\r\nquestion.\r\n\r\nI. Herbert Spencer was the philosopher whose mind was best prepared by his\r\nown previous thinking to admit the theory of Darwin to a place in his\r\nconception of the world. His criticism of the arguments which had been put\r\nforward against the hypothesis of Lamarck, showed that Spencer, as a young\r\nman, was an adherent to the evolution idea. In his _Social Statics_ (1850)\r\nhe applied this idea to human life and moral civilisation. In 1852 he wrote\r\nan essay on _The Development Hypothesis_, in which he definitely stated his\r\nbelief that the differentiation of species, like the differentiation within\r\na single organism, was the result of development. In the first edition of\r\nhis _Psychology_ (1855) he took a step which put him in opposition to the\r\nolder English school (from Locke to Mill): he acknowledged \"innate ideas\"\r\nso far as to admit the tendency of acquired habits to be inherited in the\r\ncourse of generations, so that the nature and functions of the individual\r\nare only to be understood through its connection with the life of the\r\nspecies. In 1857, in his essay on _Progress_, he propounded the law of\r\ndifferentiation as a general law of evolution, verified by examples from\r\nall regions of experience, the evolution of species being only one of these\r\nexamples. On the effect which the appearance of _The Origin of Species_ had\r\non his mind he writes in his _Autobiography_: \"Up to that time ... I held\r\nthat the sole cause of organic evolution is the inheritance of\r\nfunctionally-produced modifications. The _Origin of Species_ made it clear\r\nto me that I was wrong, and that the larger part of the facts cannot be due\r\nto any such cause.... To have the theory of organic evolution justified was\r\nof course to get further support for that theory of evolution at large with\r\nwhich ... all my conceptions were bound up.\"[199] Instead of the\r\nmetaphorical expression \"natural selection,\" Spencer introduced the term\r\n\"survival of the fittest,\" which found favour with Darwin as well as with\r\nWallace.\r\n\r\nIn working out his ideas of evolution, Spencer found that\r\ndifferentiation was not the only form of evolution. In its simplest\r\nform evolution is mainly a concentration, previously scattered\r\nelements being integrated and losing independent movement.\r\nDifferentiation is only forthcoming when minor wholes arise within a\r\ngreater whole. And the highest form of evolution is reached when there\r\nis a harmony between concentration and differentiation, a harmony\r\nwhich Spencer calls equilibration and which he defines as a moving\r\nequilibrium. At the same time this definition enables him to\r\nillustrate the expression \"survival of the fittest.\" \"Every living\r\norganism exhibits such a moving equilibrium--a balanced set of\r\nfunctions constituting its life; and the overthrow of this balanced\r\nset of functions or moving equilibrium is what we call death. Some\r\nindividuals in a species are so constituted that their moving\r\nequilibria are less easily overthrown than those of other\r\nindividuals; and these are the fittest which survive, or, in Mr.\r\nDarwin's language, they are the select which nature preserves.\"[200]\r\nNot only in the domain of organic life, but in all domains, the summit\r\nof evolution is, according to Spencer, characterised by such a\r\nharmony--by a moving equilibrium.\r\n\r\nSpencer's analysis of the concept of evolution, based on a great\r\nvariety of examples, has made this concept clearer and more definite\r\nthan before. It contains the three elements; integration,\r\ndifferentiation and equilibration. It is true that a concept which is\r\nto be valid for all domains of experience must have an abstract\r\ncharacter, and between the several domains there is, strictly\r\nspeaking, only a relation of analogy. So there is only analogy between\r\npsychical and physical evolution. But this is no serious objection,\r\nbecause general concepts do not express more than analogies between\r\nthe phenomena which they represent. Spencer takes his leading forms\r\nfrom the material world in defining evolution (in the simplest form)\r\nas integration of matter and dissipation of movement; but as he--not\r\nalways quite consistently[201]--assumed a correspondence of mind and\r\nmatter, he could very well give these terms an indirect importance for\r\npsychical evolution. Spencer has always, in my opinion with full\r\nright, repudiated the ascription of materialism. He is no more a\r\nmaterialist than Spinoza. In his _Principles of Psychology_ (§ 63) he\r\nexpressed himself very clearly: \"Though it seems easier to translate\r\nso-called matter into so-called spirit, than to translate so-called\r\nspirit into so-called matter--which latter is indeed wholly\r\nimpossible--yet no translation can carry us beyond our symbols.\" These\r\nwords lead us naturally to a group of thinkers whose starting-point\r\nwas psychical evolution. But we have still one aspect of Spencer's\r\nphilosophy to mention.\r\n\r\nSpencer founded his \"laws of evolution\" on an inductive basis, but he\r\nwas convinced that they could be deduced from the law of the\r\nconservation of energy. Such a deduction is, perhaps, possible for the\r\nmore elementary forms of evolution, integration and differentiation;\r\nbut it is not possible for the highest form, the equilibration, which\r\nis a harmony of integration and differentiation. Spencer can no more\r\ndeduce the necessity for the eventual appearance of \"moving\r\nequilibria\" of harmonious totalities than Hegel could guarantee the\r\n\"higher unities\" in which all contradictions should be reconciled. In\r\nSpencer's hands the theory of evolution acquired a more decidedly\r\noptimistic character than in Darwin's; but I shall deal later with the\r\nrelation of Darwin's hypothesis to the opposition of optimism and\r\npessimism.\r\n\r\nII. While the starting-point of Spencer was biological or\r\ncosmological, psychical evolution being conceived as in analogy with\r\nphysical, a group of eminent thinkers--in Germany Wundt, in France\r\nFouillée, in Italy Ardigò--took, each in his own manner, their\r\nstarting-point in psychical evolution as an original fact and as a\r\ntype of all evolution, the hypothesis of Darwin coming in as a\r\ncorroboration and as a special example. They maintain the continuity\r\nof evolution; they find this character most prominent in psychical\r\nevolution, and this is for them a motive to demand a corresponding\r\ncontinuity in the material, especially in the organic domain.\r\n\r\nTo Wundt and Fouillée the concept of will is prominent. They see the\r\ntype of all evolution in the transformation of the life of will from\r\nblind impulse to conscious choice; the theories of Lamarck and Darwin\r\nare used to support the view that there is in nature a tendency to\r\nevolution in steady reciprocity with external conditions. The struggle\r\nfor life is here only a secondary fact. Its apparent prominence is\r\nexplained by the circumstance that the influence of external\r\nconditions is easily made out, while inner conditions can be verified\r\nonly through their effects. For Ardigò the evolution of thought was\r\nthe starting-point and the type: in the evolution of a scientific\r\nhypothesis we see a progress from the indefinite (_indistinto_) to the\r\ndefinite (_distinto_), and this is a characteristic of all evolution,\r\nas Ardigò has pointed out in a series of works. The opposition between\r\n_indistinto_ and _distinto_ corresponds to Spencer's opposition\r\nbetween homogeneity and heterogeneity. The hypothesis of the origin of\r\ndifferences of species from more simple forms is a special example of\r\nthe general law of evolution.\r\n\r\nIn the views of Wundt and Fouillée we find the fundamental idea of\r\nidealism psychical phenomena as expressions of the innermost nature of\r\nexistence. They differ from the older Idealism in the great stress\r\nwhich they lay on evolution as a real, historical process which is\r\ngoing on through steady conflict with external conditions. The\r\nRomantic dread of reality is broken. It is beyond doubt that Darwin's\r\nemphasis on the struggle for life as a necessary condition of\r\nevolution has been a very important factor in carrying philosophy back\r\nto reality from the heaven of pure ideas. The philosophy of Ardigò, on\r\nthe other side, appears more as a continuation and deepening of\r\npositivism, though the Italian thinker arrived at his point of view\r\nindependently of French-English positivism. The idea of continuous\r\nevolution is here maintained in opposition to Comte's and Mill's\r\nphilosophy of discontinuity. From Wundt and Fouillée Ardigò differs in\r\nconceiving psychical evolution not as an immediate revelation of the\r\ninnermost nature of existence, but only as a single, though the most\r\naccessible example, of evolution.\r\n\r\nIII. To the French philosophers Boutroux and Bergson, evolution proper\r\nis continuous and qualitative, while outer experience and physical\r\nscience give us fragments only, sporadic processes and mechanical\r\ncombinations. To Bergson, in his recent work _L'Evolution Créatrice_,\r\nevolution consists in an _élan de vie_ which to our fragmentary\r\nobservation and analytic reflexion appears as broken into a manifold\r\nof elements and processes. The concept of matter in its scientific\r\nform is the result of this breaking asunder, essential for all\r\nscientific reflexion. In these conceptions the strongest opposition\r\nbetween inner and outer conditions of evolution is expressed: in the\r\ndomain of internal conditions spontaneous development of qualitative\r\nforms--in the domain of external conditions discontinuity and\r\nmechanical combination.\r\n\r\nWe see, then, that the theory of evolution has influenced philosophy\r\nin a variety of forms. It has made idealistic thinkers revise their\r\nrelation to the real world; it has led positivistic thinkers to find a\r\ncloser connection between the facts on which they based their views;\r\nit has made us all open our eyes for new possibilities to arise\r\nthrough the _prima facie_ inexplicable \"spontaneous\" variations which\r\nare the condition of all evolution. This last point is one of peculiar\r\ninterest. Deeper than speculative philosophy and mechanical science\r\nsaw in the days of their triumph, we catch sight of new streams, whose\r\nsources and laws we have still to discover. Most sharply does this\r\nappear in the theory of mutation, which is only a stronger\r\naccentuation of a main point in Darwinism. It is interesting to see\r\nthat an analogous problem comes into the foreground in physics through\r\nthe discovery of radioactive phenomena, and in psychology through the\r\nassumption of psychical new formations (as held by Boutroux, William\r\nJames and Bergson). From this side, Darwin's ideas, as well as the\r\nanalogous ideas in other domains, incite us to renewed examination of\r\nour first principles, their rationality and their value. On the other\r\nhand, his theory of the struggle for existence challenges us to\r\nexamine the conditions and discuss the outlook as to the persistence\r\nof human life and society and of the values that belong to them. It is\r\nnot enough to hope (or fear?) the rising of new forms; we have also to\r\ninvestigate the possibility of upholding the forms and ideals which\r\nhave hitherto been the bases of human life. Darwin has here given his\r\nage the most earnest and most impressive lesson. This side of Darwin's\r\ntheory is of peculiar interest to some special philosophical problems\r\nto which I now pass.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nAmong philosophical problems the problem of knowledge has in the last\r\ncentury occupied a foremost place. It is natural, then, to ask how\r\nDarwin and the hypothesis whose most eminent representative he is,\r\nstand to this problem.\r\n\r\nDarwin started an hypothesis. But every hypothesis is won by inference\r\nfrom certain presuppositions, and every inference is based on the\r\ngeneral principles of human thought. The evolution hypothesis\r\npresupposes, then, human thought and its principles. And not only the\r\nabstract logical principles are thus pre-supposed. The evolution\r\nhypothesis purports to be not only a formal arrangement of phenomena,\r\nbut to express also the law of a real process. It supposes, then, that\r\nthe real data--all that in our knowledge which we do not produce\r\nourselves, but which we in the main simply receive--are subject to\r\nlaws which are at least analogous to the logical relations of our\r\nthoughts; in other words, it assumes the validity of the principle of\r\ncausality. If organic species could arise without cause there would be\r\nno use in framing hypotheses. Only if we assume the principle of\r\ncausality, is there a problem to solve.\r\n\r\nThough Darwinism has had a great influence on philosophy considered as\r\na striving after a scientific view of the world, yet here is a point\r\nof view--the epistemological--where philosophy is not only independent\r\nbut reaches beyond any result of natural science. Perhaps it will be\r\nsaid: the powers and functions of organic beings only persist (perhaps\r\nalso only arise) when they correspond sufficiently to the conditions\r\nunder which the struggle of life is to go on. Human thought itself is,\r\nthen, a variation (or a mutation) which has been able to persist and\r\nto survive. Is not, then, the problem of knowledge solved by the\r\nevolution hypothesis? Spencer had given an affirmative answer to this\r\nquestion before the appearance of _The Origin of Species_. For the\r\nindividual, he said, there is an _à priori_, original, basis (or\r\n_Anlage_) for all mental life; but in the species all powers have\r\ndeveloped in reciprocity with extendal conditions. Knowledge is here\r\nconsidered from the practical point of view, as a weapon in the\r\nstruggle for life, as an \"organon\" which has been continuously in use\r\nfor generations. In recent years the economic or pragmatic\r\nepistemology, as developed by Avenarius and Mach in Germany, and by\r\nJames in America, points in the same direction. Science, it is said,\r\nonly maintains those principles and presuppositions which are\r\nnecessary to the simplest and clearest orientation be applied to\r\nexperience and to practical work, will successively be eliminated.\r\n\r\nIn these views a striking and important application is made of the\r\nidea of struggle for life to the development of human thought. Thought\r\nmust, as all other things in the world, struggle for life. But this\r\nwhole consideration belongs to psychology, not to the theory of\r\nknowledge (epistemology), which is concerned only with the validity of\r\nknowledge, not with its historical origin. Every hypothesis to explain\r\nthe origin of knowledge must submit to cross-examination by the theory\r\nof knowledge, because it works with the fundamental forms and\r\nprinciples of human thought. We cannot go further back than these\r\nforms and principles, which it is the aim of epistemology to ascertain\r\nand for which no further reason can be given.[202]\r\n\r\nBut there is another side of the problem which is, perhaps, of more\r\nimportance and which epistemology generally overlooks. If new\r\nvariations can arise, not only in organic but perhaps also in\r\ninorganic nature, new tasks are placed before the human mind. The\r\nquestion is, then, if it has forms in which there is room for the new\r\nmatter? We are here touching a possibility which the great master of\r\nepistemology did not bring to light. Kant supposed confidently that no\r\nother matter of knowledge could stream forth from the dark source\r\nwhich he called \"the thing-in-itself,\" than such as could be\r\nsynthesised in our existing forms of knowledge. He mentions the\r\npossibility of other forms than the human, and warns us against the\r\ndogmatic assumption that the human conception of existence should be\r\nabsolutely adequate. But he seems to be quite sure that the\r\nthing-in-itself works constantly, and consequently always gives us\r\nonly what our powers can master. This assumption was a consequence of\r\nKant's rationalistic tendency, but one for which no warrant can be\r\ngiven. Evolutionism and systematism are opposing tendencies which can\r\nnever be absolutely harmonised one with the other. Evolution may at\r\nany time break some form which the system-monger regards as finally\r\nestablished. Darwin himself felt a great difference in looking at\r\nvariation as an evolutionist and as a systematist. When he was working\r\nat his evolution theory, he was very glad to find variations; but they\r\nwere a hindrance to him when he worked as a systematist, in preparing\r\nhis work on Cirripedia. He says in a letter: \"I had thought the same\r\nparts of the same species more resemble (than they do anyhow in\r\nCirripedia) objects cast in the same mould. Systematic work would be\r\neasy were it not for this confounded variation, which, however, is\r\npleasant to me as a speculatist, though odious to me as a\r\nsystematist.\"[203] He could indeed be angry with variations even as an\r\nevolutionist; but then only because he could not explain them, not\r\nbecause he could not classify them. \"If, as I must think, external\r\nconditions produce little _direct_ effect, what the devil determines\r\neach particular variation?\"[204] What Darwin experienced in this\r\nparticular domain holds good of all knowledge. All knowledge is\r\nsystematic, in so far as it strives to put phenomena in quite definite\r\nrelations, one to another. But the systematisation can never be\r\ncomplete. And here Darwin has contributed much to widen the world, for\r\nus. He has shown us forces and tendencies in nature which make\r\nabsolute systems impossible, at the same time that they give us new\r\nobjects and problems. There is still a place for what Lessing called\r\n\"the unceasing striving after truth,\" while \"absolute truth\" (in the\r\nsense of a closed system) is unattainable so long as life and\r\nexperience are going on.\r\n\r\nThere is here a special remark to be made. As we have seen above,\r\nrecent research has shown that natural selection or struggle for life\r\nis no explanation of variations. Hugo de Vries distinguishes between\r\npartial and embryonal variations, or between variations and mutations,\r\nonly the last-named being heritable, and therefore of importance for\r\nthe origin of new species. But the existence of variations is not only\r\nof interest for the problem of the origin of species; it has also a\r\nmore general interest. An individual does not lose its importance for\r\nknowledge, because its qualities are not heritable. On the contrary,\r\nin higher beings at least, individual peculiarities will become more\r\nand more independent objects of interest. Knowledge takes account of\r\nthe biographies not only of species, but also of individuals: it seeks\r\nto find the law of development of the single individual.[205] As\r\nLeibnitz said long ago, individuality consists in the law of the\r\nchanges of a being: \"La loi du changement fait l'individualité de\r\nchaque substance.\" Here is a world which is almost new for science,\r\nwhich till now has mainly occupied itself with general laws and forms.\r\nBut these are ultimately only means to understand the individual\r\nphenomena, in whose nature and history a manifold of laws and forms\r\nalways coöperate. The importance of this remark will appear in the\r\nsequel.\r\n\r\n\r\nV\r\n\r\nTo many people the Darwinian theory of natural selection or struggle\r\nfor existence seemed to change the whole conception of life, and\r\nparticularly all the conditions on which the validity of ethical ideas\r\ndepends. If only that has persistence which can be adapted to a given\r\ncondition, what will then be the fate of our ideals, of our standards\r\nof good and evil? Blind force seems to reign, and the only thing that\r\ncounts seems to be the most heedless use of power. Darwinism, it was\r\nsaid, has proclaimed brutality. No other difference seems permanent\r\nsave that between the sound, powerful and happy on the one side, the\r\nsick, feeble and unhappy on the other; and every attempt to alleviate\r\nthis difference seems to lead to general enervation. Some of those who\r\ninterpreted Darwinism in this manner felt an aesthetic delight in\r\ncontemplating the heedlessness and energy of the great struggle for\r\nexistence and anticipated the realisation of a higher human type as\r\nthe outcome of it: so Nietzsche and his followers. Others recognising\r\nthe same consequences in Darwinism regarded these as one of the\r\nstrongest objections against it; so Dühring and Kropotkin (in his\r\nearlier works).\r\n\r\nThis interpretation of Darwinism was frequent in the interval between\r\nthe two main works of Darwin--_The Origin of Species_ and _The Descent\r\nof Man_. But even during this interval it was evident to an attentive\r\nreader that Darwin himself did not found his standard of good and evil\r\non the features of the life of nature he had emphasised so strongly.\r\nHe did not justify the ways along which nature reached its ends; he\r\nonly pointed them out. The \"real\" was not to him, as to Hegel, one\r\nwith the \"rational.\" Darwin has, indeed, by his whole conception of\r\nnature, rendered a great service to ethics in making the difference\r\nbetween the life of nature and the ethical life appear in so strong a\r\nlight. The ethical problem could now be stated in a sharper form than\r\nbefore. But this was not the first time that the idea of the struggle\r\nfor life was put in relation to the ethical problem. In the\r\nseventeenth century Thomas Hobbes gave the first impulse to the whole\r\nmodern discussion of ethical principles in his theory of _bellum\r\nomnium contra omnes_. Men, he taught, are in the state of nature\r\nenemies one of another, and they live either in fright or in the glory\r\nof power. But it was not the opinion of Hobbes that this made ethics\r\nimpossible. On the contrary, he found a standard for virtue and vice\r\nin the fact that some qualities and actions have a tendency to bring\r\nus out of the state of war and to secure peace, while other qualities\r\nhave a contrary tendency. In the eighteenth century even Immanuel\r\nKant's ideal ethics had--so far as can be seen--a similar origin.\r\nShortly before the foundation of his definitive ethics, Kant wrote his\r\n_Idee zu einer allgemeinen Weltgeschichte_ (1784), where--in a way\r\nwhich reminds us of Hobbes, and is prophetic of Darwin--he describes\r\nthe forward-driving power of struggle in the human world. It is here\r\nas with the struggle of the trees for light and air, through which\r\nthey compete with one another in height. Anxiety about war can only be\r\nallayed by an ordinance which gives everyone his full liberty under\r\nacknowledgment of the equal liberty of others. And such ordinance and\r\nacknowledgment are also attributes of the content of the moral law, as\r\nKant proclaimed it in the year after the publication of his essay\r\n(1785).[206] Kant really came to his ethics by the way of evolution,\r\nthough he afterwards disavowed it. Similarly the same line of thought\r\nmay be traced in Hegel though it has been disguised in the form of\r\nspeculative dialectics.[207] And in Schopenhauer's theory of the blind\r\nwill to live and its abrogation by the ethical feeling, which is\r\nfounded on universal sympathy, we have a more individualistic form of\r\nthe same idea.\r\n\r\nIt was, then, not entirely a foreign point of view which Darwin\r\nintroduced into ethical thought, even if we take no account of the\r\npoetical character of the word \"struggle\" and of the more direct\r\nadaptation, through the use and non-use of power, which Darwin also\r\nemphasised. In _The Descent of Man_ he has devoted a special\r\nchapter[208] to a discussion of the origin of the ethical\r\nconsciousness. The characteristic expression of this consciousness he\r\nfound, just as Kant did, in the idea of \"ought\"; it was the origin of\r\nthis new idea which should be explained. His hypothesis was that the\r\nethical \"ought\" has its origin in the social and parental instincts,\r\nwhich, as well as other instincts (e.g. the instinct of\r\nself-preservation), lie deeper than pleasure and pain. In many\r\nspecies, not least in the human species, these instincts are fostered\r\nby natural selection; and when the powers of memory and comparison are\r\ndeveloped, so that single acts can be valued according to the claims\r\nof the deep social instinct, then consciousness of duty and remorse\r\nare possible. Blind instinct has developed to conscious ethical will.\r\n\r\nAs already stated, Darwin, as a moral philosopher belongs to the\r\nschool that was founded by Shaftesbury, and was afterwards represented\r\nby Hutcheson, Hume, Adam Smith, Comte and Spencer. His merit is,\r\nfirst, that he has given this tendency of thought a biological\r\nfoundation, and that he has stamped on it a doughty character in\r\nshowing that ethical ideas and sentiments, rightly conceived, are\r\nforces which are at work in the struggle for life.\r\n\r\nThere are still many questions to solve. Not only does the ethical\r\ndevelopment within the human species contain features still\r\nunexplained;[209] but we are confronted by the great problem whether\r\nafter all a genetic historical theory can be of decisive importance\r\nhere. To every consequent ethical consciousness there is a standard of\r\nvalue, a primordial value which determines the single ethical\r\njudgments as their last presupposition, and the \"rightness\" of this\r\nbasis, the \"value\" of this value can as little be discussed as the\r\n\"rationality\" of our logical principles. There is here revealed a\r\npossibility of ethical scepticism which evolutionistic ethics (as well\r\nas intuitive or rationalistic ethics) has overlooked. No demonstration\r\ncan show that the results of the ethical development are definitive\r\nand universal. We meet here again with the important opposition of\r\nsystematisation and evolution. There will, I think, always be an open\r\nquestion here, though comparative ethics, of which we have so far only\r\nthe first attempts, can do much to throw light on it.\r\n\r\nIt would carry us too far to discuss all the philosophical works on\r\nethics, which have been influenced directly or indirectly by\r\nevolutionism. I may, however, here refer to the book of C. M.\r\nWilliams, _A Review of the Systems of Ethics founded on the Theory of\r\nEvolution_,[210] in which, besides Darwin, the following authors are\r\nreviewed: Wallace, Haeckel, Spencer, Fiske, Rolph, Barratt, Stephen,\r\nCarneri, Höffding, Gizycki, Alexander, Rée. As works which criticise\r\nevolutionistic ethics from an intuitive point of view and in an\r\ninstructive way, may be cited: Guyau, _La morale anglaise\r\ncontemporaine_,[211] and Sorley, _Ethics of Naturalism_. I will only\r\nmention some interesting contributions to ethical discussion which can\r\nbe found in Darwinism besides the idea of struggle for life.\r\n\r\nThe attention which Darwin has directed to variations has opened our\r\neyes to the differences in human nature as well as in nature\r\ngenerally. There is here a fact of great importance for ethical\r\nthought, no matter from what ultimate premiss it starts. Only from a\r\nvery abstract point of view can different individuals be treated in\r\nthe same manner. The most eminent ethical thinkers, men such as Jeremy\r\nBentham and Immanuel Kant, who discussed ethical questions from very\r\nopposite standpoints, agreed in regarding all men as equal in respect\r\nof ethical endowment. In regard to Bentham, Leslie Stephen remarks:\r\n\"He is determined to be thoroughly empirical, to take men as he found\r\nthem. But his utilitarianism supposed that men's views of happiness\r\nand utility were uniform and clear, and that all that was wanted was\r\nto show them the means by which their ends could be reached.\"[212] And\r\nKant supposed that every man would find the \"categorical imperative\"\r\nin his consciousness, when he came to sober reflexion, and that all\r\nwould have the same qualifications to follow it. But if continual\r\nvariations, great or small, are going on in human nature, it is the\r\nduty of ethics to make allowance for them, both in making claims, and\r\nin valuing what is done. A new set of ethical problems have their\r\norigin here.[213] It is an interesting fact that Stuart Mill's book\r\n_On Liberty_ appeared in the same year as _The Origin of Species_.\r\nThough Mill agreed with Bentham about the original equality of all\r\nmen's endowments, he regarded individual differences as a necessary\r\nresult of physical and social influences, and he claimed that free\r\nplay shall be allowed to differences of character so far as is\r\npossible without injury to other men. It is a condition of individual\r\nand social progress that a man's mode of action should be determined\r\nby his own character and not by tradition and custom, nor by abstract\r\nrules. This view was to be corroborated by the theory of Darwin.\r\n\r\nBut here we have reached a point of view from which the criticism,\r\nwhich in recent years has often been directed against Darwin--that\r\nsmall variations are of no importance in the struggle for life--is of\r\nno weight. From an ethical standpoint, and particularly from the\r\nethical standpoint of Darwin himself, it is a duty to foster\r\nindividual differences that can be valuable, even though they can\r\nneither be of service for physical preservation nor be physically\r\ninherited. The distinction between variation and mutation is here\r\nwithout importance. It is quite natural that biologists should be\r\nparticularly interested in such variations as can be inherited and\r\nproduce new species. But in the human world there is not only a\r\nphysical, but also a mental and social heredity. When an ideal human\r\ncharacter has taken form, then there is shaped a type, which through\r\nimitation and influence can become an important factor in subsequent\r\ndevelopment, even if it cannot form a species in the biological sense\r\nof the word. Spiritually strong men often succumb in the physical\r\nstruggle for life; but they can nevertheless be victorious through the\r\ntypical influence they exert, perhaps on very distant generations, if\r\nthe remembrance of them is kept alive, be it in legendary or in\r\nhistorical form. Their very failure can show that a type has taken\r\nform which is maintained at all risks, a standard of life which is\r\nadhered to in spite of the strongest opposition. The question \"to be\r\nor not to be\" can be put from very different levels of being: it has\r\ntoo often been considered a consequence of Darwinism that this\r\nquestion is only to be put from the lowest level. When a stage is\r\nreached, where ideal (ethical, intellectual, aesthetic) interests are\r\nconcerned, the struggle for life is a struggle for the preservation of\r\nthis stage. The giving up of a higher standard of life is a sort of\r\ndeath; for there is not only a physical, there is also a spiritual,\r\ndeath.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI\r\n\r\nThe Socratic character of Darwin's mind appears in his wariness in\r\ndrawing the last consequences of his doctrine, in contrast both with\r\nthe audacious theories of so many of his followers and with the\r\nconsequences which his antagonists were busy in drawing. Though he, as\r\nwe have seen, saw from the beginning that his hypothesis would\r\noccasion \"a whole of metaphysics,\" he was himself very reserved as to\r\nthe ultimate questions, and his answers to such questions were\r\nextorted from him.\r\n\r\nAs to the question of optimism and pessimism, Darwin held that though\r\npain and suffering were very often the ways by which animals were led\r\nto pursue that course of action which is most beneficial to the\r\nspecies, yet pleasurable feelings were the most habitual guides. \"We\r\nsee this in the pleasure from exertion, even occasionally from great\r\nexertion of the body or mind, in the pleasure of our daily meals, and\r\nespecially in the pleasure derived from sociability, and from loving\r\nour families.\" But there was to him so much suffering in the world\r\nthat it was a strong argument against the existence of an intelligent\r\nFirst Cause.[214]\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that Darwin was not so clear on another question, that\r\nof the relation between improvement and adaptation. He wrote to Lyell:\r\n\"When you contrast natural selection and 'improvement,' you seem\r\nalways to overlook ... that every step in the natural selection of\r\neach species implies improvement in that species _in relation to its\r\ncondition of life_.... Improvement implies, I suppose, _each form\r\nobtaining many parts or organs_, all excellently adapted for their\r\nfunctions.\" \"All this,\" he adds, \"seems to me quite compatible with\r\ncertain forms fitted for simple conditions, remaining unaltered, or\r\nbeing, degraded.\"[215] But the great question is, if the conditions of\r\nlife will in the long run favour \"improvement\" in the sense of\r\ndifferentiation (or harmony of differentiation and integration). Many\r\nbeings are best adapted to their conditions of life if they have few\r\norgans and few necessities. Pessimism would not only be the\r\nconsequence, if suffering outweighed happiness, but also if the most\r\nelementary forms of happiness were predominant, or if there were a\r\ntendency to reduce the standard of life to the simplest possible, the\r\ncontentment of inertia or stable equilibrium. There are animals which\r\nare very highly differentiated and active in their young state, but\r\nlater lose their complex organisation and concentrate themselves on\r\nthe one function of nutrition. In the human world analogies to this\r\nsort of adaptation are not wanting. Young \"idealists\" very often end\r\nas old \"Philistines.\" Adaptation and progress are not the same.\r\n\r\nAnother question of great importance in respect to human evolution is,\r\nwhether there will be always a possibility for the existence of an\r\nimpulse to progress, an impulse to make great claims on life, to be\r\nactive and to alter the conditions of life instead of adapting to them\r\nin a passive manner. Many people do not develop because they have too\r\nfew necessities, and because they have no power to imagine other\r\nconditions of life than those under which they live. In his remarks on\r\n\"the pleasure from exertion\" Darwin has a point of contact with the\r\npractical idealism of former times--with the ideas of Lessing and\r\nGoethe, of Condorcet and Fichte. The continual striving which was the\r\ncondition of salvation to Faust's soul, is also the condition of\r\nsalvation to mankind. There is a holy fire which we ought to keep\r\nburning, if adaptation is really to be improvement. If, as I have\r\ntried to show in my _Philosophy of Religion_, the innermost core of\r\nall religion is faith in the persistence of value in the world, and if\r\nthe highest values express themselves in the cry \"Excelsior!\" then the\r\ncapital point is, that this cry should always be heard and followed.\r\nWe have here a corollary of the theory of evolution in its application\r\nto human life.\r\n\r\nDarwin declared himself an agnostic, not only because he could not\r\nharmonise the large amount of suffering in the world with the idea of\r\na God as its first cause, but also because he \"was aware that if we\r\nadmit a first cause, the mind still craves to know whence it came and\r\nhow it arose.\"[216] He saw, as Kant had seen before him and expressed\r\nin his _Kritik der Urtheilskraft_, that we cannot accept either of the\r\nonly two possibilities which we are able to conceive: chance (or brute\r\nforce) and design. Neither mechanism nor teleology can give an\r\nabsolute answer to ultimate questions. The universe, and especially\r\nthe organic life in it, can neither be explained as a mere\r\ncombination of absolute elements nor as the effect of a constructing\r\nthought. Darwin concluded, as Kant, and before him Spinoza, that the\r\noppositions and distinctions which our experience presents, cannot\r\nsafely be regarded as valid for existence in itself. And, with Kant\r\nand Fichte, he found his stronghold in the conviction that man has\r\nsomething to do, even if he cannot solve all enigmas. \"The safest\r\nconclusion seems to me that the whole subject is beyond the scope of\r\nman's intellect; but man can do his duty.\"[217]\r\n\r\nIs this the last word of human thought? Does not the possibility, that\r\nman can do his duty, suppose that the conditions of life allow of\r\ncontinuous ethical striving, so that there is a certain harmony\r\nbetween cosmic order and human ideals? Darwin himself has shown how\r\nthe consciousness of duty can arise as a natural result of evolution.\r\nMoreover there are lines of evolution which have their end in ethical\r\nidealism, in a kingdom of values, which must struggle for life as all\r\nthings in the world must do, but a kingdom which has its firm\r\nfoundation in reality.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 195: _Life and Letters of Charles Darwin_, Vol. I. p. 8.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 196: _Encyclopädie der philosophischen Wissenschaften_ (4th\r\nedit.), Berlin, 1845, § 249.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 197: _Lehrbuch der Naturphilosophie_, Jena, 1809.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 198: _Ueber den Willen in der Natur_ (2nd edit.), Frankfurt\r\na.

N. WAGGETT, M.A., S.S.J.E.\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nThe object of this paper is first to point out certain elements of the\r\nDarwinian influence upon Religious thought, and then to show reason\r\nfor the conclusion that it has been, from a Christian point of view,\r\nsatisfactory. I shall not proceed further to urge that the Christian\r\napologetic in relation to biology has been successful. A variety of\r\nopinions may be held on this question, without disturbing the\r\nconclusion that the movements of readjustment have been beneficial to\r\nthose who remain Christians, and this by making them more Christian\r\nand not only more liberal. The theologians may sometimes have\r\nretreated, but there has been an advance of theology. I know that this\r\naccount incurs the charge of optimism. It is not the worst that could\r\nbe made. The influence has been limited in personal range, unequal,\r\neven divergent, in operation, and accompanied by the appearance of\r\nwaste and mischievous products. The estimate which follows requires\r\nfor due balance a full development of many qualifying considerations.\r\nFor this I lack space, but I must at least distinguish my view from\r\nthe popular one that our difficulties about religion and natural\r\nscience have come to an end.\r\n\r\nConcerning the older questions about origins--the origin of the\r\nworld, of species, of man, of reason, conscience, religion--a large\r\nmeasure of understanding has been reached by some thoughtful men. But\r\nmeanwhile new questions have arisen, questions about conduct,\r\nregarding both the reality of morals and the rule of right action for\r\nindividuals and societies. And these problems, still far from\r\nsolution, may also be traced to the influence of Darwin. For they\r\narise from the renewed attention to heredity, brought about by the\r\nsearch for the causes of variation, without which the study of the\r\nselection of variations has no sufficient basis.\r\n\r\nEven the existing understanding about origins is very far from\r\nuniversal. On these points there were always thoughtful men who denied\r\nthe necessity of conflict, and there are still thoughtful men who deny\r\nthe possibility of a truce.\r\n\r\nIt must further be remembered that the earlier discussion now, as I\r\nhope to show, producing favourable results, created also for a time\r\ngrave damage, not only in the disturbance of faith and the loss of\r\nmen--a loss not repaired by a change in the currents of debate--but in\r\nwhat I believe to be a still more serious respect. I mean the\r\nintroduction of a habit of facile and untested hypothesis in religious\r\nas in other departments of thought.\r\n\r\nDarwin is not responsible for this, but he is in part the cause of it.\r\nGreat ideas are dangerous guests in narrow minds; and thus it has\r\nhappened that Darwin--the most patient of scientific workers, in whom\r\nhypothesis waited upon research, or if it provisionally outstepped it\r\ndid so only with the most scrupulously careful acknowledgment--has led\r\nsmaller and less conscientious men in natural science, in history, and\r\nin theology to an over-eager confidence in probable conjecture and a\r\nloose grip upon the facts of experience. It is not too much to say\r\nthat in many quarters the age of materialism was the least\r\nmatter-of-fact age conceivable, and the age of science the age which\r\nshowed least of the patient temper of inquiry.\r\n\r\nI have indicated, as shortly as I could, some losses and dangers\r\nwhich in a balanced account of Darwin's influence would be discussed\r\nat length.\r\n\r\nOne other loss must be mentioned. It is a defect in our thought which,\r\nin some quarters, has by itself almost cancelled all the advantages\r\nsecured. I mean the exaggerated emphasis on uniformity or continuity;\r\nthe unwillingness to rest any part of faith or of our practical\r\nexpectation upon anything that from any point of view can be called\r\nexceptional. The high degree of success reached by naturalists in\r\ntracing, or reasonably conjecturing, the small beginnings of great\r\ndifferences, has led the inconsiderate to believe that anything may in\r\ntime become anything else.\r\n\r\nIt is true that this exaggeration of the belief in uniformity has\r\nproduced in turn its own perilous reaction. From refusing to believe\r\nwhatever can be called exceptional, some have come to believe whatever\r\ncan be called wonderful.\r\n\r\nBut, on the whole, the discontinuous or highly various character of\r\nexperience received for many years too little deliberate attention.\r\nThe conception of uniformity which is a necessity of scientific\r\ndescription has been taken for the substance of history. We have\r\naccepted a postulate of scientific method as if it were a conclusion\r\nof scientific demonstration. In the name of a generalisation which,\r\nhowever just on the lines of a particular method, is the prize of a\r\ndifficult exploit of reflexion, we have discarded the direct\r\nimpressions of experience; or, perhaps it is more true to say, we have\r\nused for the criticism of alleged experiences a doctrine of uniformity\r\nwhich is only valid in the region of abstract science. For every\r\nscience depends for its advance upon limitation of attention, upon the\r\nselection out of the whole content of consciousness of that part or\r\naspect which is measurable by the method of the science. Accordingly\r\nthere is a science of life which rightly displays the unity underlying\r\nall its manifestations. But there is another view of life, equally\r\nvalid, and practically sometimes more important, which recognises the\r\nimmediate and lasting effect of crisis, difference, and revolution.\r\nOur ardour for the demonstration of uniformity of process and of\r\nminute continuous change needs to be balanced by a recognition of the\r\ncatastrophic element in experience, and also by a recognition of the\r\nexceptional significance for us of events which may be perfectly\r\nregular from an impersonal point of view.\r\n\r\nAn exorbitant jealousy of miracle, revelation, and ultimate moral\r\ndistinctions has been imported from evolutionary science into\r\nreligious thought. And it has been a damaging influence, because it\r\nhas taken men's attention from facts, and fixed them upon theories.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nWith this acknowledgment of important drawbacks, requiring many words\r\nfor their proper description, I proceed to indicate certain results of\r\nDarwin's doctrine which I believe to be in the long run wholly\r\nbeneficial to Christian thought. These are:\r\n\r\nThe encouragement in theology of that evolutionary method of\r\nobservation and study, which has shaped all modern research:\r\n\r\nThe recoil of Christian apologetics towards the ground of religious\r\nexperience, a recoil produced by the pressure of scientific criticism\r\nupon other supports of faith:\r\n\r\nThe restatement, or the recovery of ancient forms of statement, of the\r\ndoctrines of Creation and of divine Design in Nature, consequent upon\r\nthe discussion of evolution and of natural selection as its guiding\r\nfactor.\r\n\r\n(1) The first of these is quite possibly the most important of all. It\r\nwas well defined in a notable paper read by Dr. Gore, now Bishop of\r\nBirmingham, to the Church Congress at Shrewsbury in 1896. We have\r\nlearnt a new caution both in ascribing and in denying significance to\r\nitems of evidence, in utterance or in event. There has been, as in\r\nart, a study of values, which secures perspective and solidity in our\r\nrepresentation of facts. On the one hand, a given utterance or event\r\ncannot be drawn into evidence as if all items were of equal\r\nconsequence, like sovereigns in a bag. The question whence and whither\r\nmust be asked, and the particular thing measured as part of a series.\r\nThus measured it is not less truly important, but it may be important\r\nin a lower degree. On the other hand, and for exactly the same reason,\r\nnothing that is real is unimportant. The \"failures\" are not mere\r\nmistakes. We see them, in St. Augustine's words, as \"scholar's faults\r\nwhich men praise in hope of fruit.\"\r\n\r\nWe cannot safely trace the origin of the evolutionistic method to the\r\ninfluence of natural science. The view is tenable that theology led\r\nthe way. Probably this is a case of alternate and reciprocal debt.\r\nQuite certainly the evolutionist method in theology, in Christian\r\nhistory and in the estimate of scripture, has received vast\r\nreinforcement from biology, in which evolution has been the ever\r\npresent and ever victorious conception.\r\n\r\n(2) The second effect named is the new willingness of Christian\r\nthinkers to take definite account of religious experience. This is\r\nrelated to Darwin through the general pressure upon religious faith of\r\nscientific criticism. The great advance of our knowledge of organisms\r\nhas been an important element in the general advance of science. It\r\nhas acted, by the varied requirements of the theory of organisms, upon\r\nall other branches of natural inquiry, and it held for a long time\r\nthat leading place in public attention which is now occupied by\r\nspeculative physics. Consequently it contributed largely to our\r\npresent estimation of science as the supreme judge in all matters of\r\ninquiry,[218] to the supposed destruction of mystery and the\r\ndisparagement of metaphysics which marked the last age, as well as to\r\nthe just recommendation of scientific method in branches of learning\r\nwhere the direct acquisitions of natural science had no place.\r\n\r\nBesides this, the new application of the idea of law and mechanical\r\nregularity to the organic world seemed to rob faith of a kind of\r\nrefuge. The romantics had, as Berthelot[219] shows, appealed to life\r\nto redress the judgments drawn from mechanism. Now, in Spencer,\r\nevolution gave us a vitalist mechanic or mechanical vitalism, and the\r\nappeal seemed cut off. We may return to this point later when we\r\nconsider evolution; at present I only endeavour to indicate that\r\ngeneral pressure of scientific criticism which drove men of faith to\r\nseek the grounds of reassurance in a science of their own; in a method\r\nof experiment, of observation, of hypothesis checked by known facts.\r\nIt is impossible for me to do more than glance across the threshold of\r\nthis subject. But it is necessary to say that the method is in an\r\nelementary stage of revival. The imposing success that belongs to\r\nnatural science is absent: we fall short of the unchallengeable\r\nunanimity of the Biologists on fundamentals. The experimental method\r\nwith its sure repetitions cannot be applied to our subject-matter. But\r\nwe have something like the observational method of palaeontology and\r\ngeographical distribution; and in biology there are still men who\r\nthink that the large examination of varieties by way of geography and\r\nthe search of strata is as truly scientific, uses as genuinely the\r\nlogical method of difference, and is as fruitful in sure conclusions\r\nas the quasi-chemical analysis of Mendelian laboratory work, of which\r\nlast I desire to express my humble admiration. Religion also has its\r\nobservational work in the larger and possibly more arduous manner.\r\n\r\nBut the scientific work in religion makes its way through difficulties\r\nand dangers. We are far from having found the formula of its\r\ncombination with the historical elements of our apologetic. It is\r\nexposed, therefore, to a damaging fire not only from unspiritualist\r\npsychology and pathology but also from the side of scholastic dogma.\r\nIt is hard to admit on equal terms a partner to the old undivided rule\r\nof books and learning. With Charles Lamb, we cry in some distress,\r\n\"must knowledge come to me, if it come at all, by some awkward\r\nexperiment of intuition, and no longer by this familiar process of\r\nreading?\"[220] and we are answered that the old process has an\r\nimperishable value, only we have not yet made clear its connection\r\nwith other contributions. And all the work is young, liable to be\r\ndrawn into unprofitable excursions, side-tracked by self-deceit and\r\npretence; and it fatally attracts, like the older mysticism, the\r\ncuriosity and the expository powers of those least in sympathy with\r\nit, ready writers who, with all the air of extended research, have\r\nbeen content with narrow grounds for induction. There is a danger,\r\nbesides, which accompanies even the most genuine work of this science\r\nand must be provided against by all its serious students. I mean the\r\ndanger of unbalanced introspection both for individuals and for\r\nsocieties; of a preoccupation comparable to our modern social\r\npreoccupation with bodily health; of reflexion upon mental states not\r\naccompanied by exercise and growth of the mental powers; the danger of\r\ncontemplating will and neglecting work, of analysing conviction and\r\nnot criticising evidence.\r\n\r\nStill, in spite of dangers and mistakes, the work remains full of\r\nhopeful indications, and, in the best examples,[221] it is truly\r\nscientific in its determination to know the very truth, to tell what\r\nwe think, not what we think we ought to think,[222] truly scientific\r\nin its employment of hypothesis and verification, and in growing\r\nconviction of the reality of its subject-matter through the repeated\r\nvictories of a mastery which advances, like science, in the Baconian\r\nroad of obedience. It is reasonable to hope that progress in this\r\nrespect will be more rapid and sure when religious study enlists more\r\nmen affected by scientific desire and endowed with scientific\r\ncapacity.\r\n\r\nThe class of investigating minds is a small one, possibly even smaller\r\nthan that of reflecting minds. Very few persons at any period are able\r\nto find out anything whatever. There are few observers, few\r\ndiscoverers, few who even wish to discover truth. In how many\r\nsocieties the problems of philology which face every person who speaks\r\nEnglish are left unattempted! And if the inquiring or the successfully\r\ninquiring class of minds is small, much smaller, of course, is the\r\nclass of those possessing the scientific aptitude in an eminent\r\ndegree. During the last age this most distinguished class was to a\r\nvery great extent absorbed in the study of phenomena, a study which\r\nhad fallen into arrears. For we stood possessed, in rudiment, of means\r\nof observation, means for travelling and acquisition, qualifying men\r\nfor a larger knowledge than had yet been attempted. These were now to\r\nbe directed with new accuracy and ardour upon the fabric and behaviour\r\nof the world of sense. Our debt to the great masters in physical\r\nscience who overtook and almost outstripped the task cannot be\r\nmeasured; and, under the honourable leadership of Ruskin, we may all\r\nwell do penance if we have failed \"in the respect due to their great\r\npowers of thought, or in the admiration due to the far scope of their\r\ndiscovery.\"[223] With what miraculous mental energy and divine good\r\nfortune--as Romans said of their soldiers--did our men of curiosity\r\nface the apparently impenetrable mysteries of nature! And how natural\r\nit was that immense accessions of knowledge, unrelated to the\r\nspiritual facts of life, should discredit Christian faith, by the\r\napparent superiority of the new work to the feeble and unprogressive\r\nknowledge of Christian believers! The day is coming when men of this\r\nmental character and rank, of this curiosity, this energy and this\r\ngood fortune in investigation, will be employed in opening mysteries\r\nof a spiritual nature. They will silence with masterful witness the\r\nover-confident denials of naturalism. They will be in danger of the\r\nwidespread recognition which thirty years ago accompanied every\r\nutterance of Huxley, Tyndall, Spencer. They will contribute, in spite\r\nof adulation, to the advance of sober religious and moral science.\r\n\r\nAnd this result will be due to Darwin, first because by raising the\r\ndignity of natural science, he encouraged the development of the\r\nscientific mind; secondly because he gave to religious students the\r\nexample of patient and ardent investigation; and thirdly because by\r\nthe pressure of naturalistic criticism the religious have been driven\r\nto ascertain the causes of their own convictions, a work in which they\r\nwere not without the sympathy of men of science.[224]\r\n\r\nIn leaving the subject of scientific religious inquiry, I will only\r\nadd that I do not believe it receives any important help--and\r\ncertainly it suffers incidentally much damaging interruption--from the\r\nstudy of abnormal manifestations or abnormal conditions of\r\npersonality.\r\n\r\n(3) Both of the above effects seem to me of high, perhaps the very\r\nhighest, importance to faith and to thought. But, under the third\r\nhead, I name two which are more directly traceable to the personal\r\nwork of Darwin, and more definitely characteristic of the age in which\r\nhis influence was paramount: viz. the influence of the two conceptions\r\nof evolution and natural selection upon the doctrine of creation and\r\nof design respectively.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible here, though it is necessary for a complete sketch of\r\nthe matter, to distinguish the different elements and channels of this\r\nDarwinian influence; in Darwin's own writings, in the vigourous\r\npolemic of Huxley, and strangely enough, but very actually for popular\r\nthought, in the teaching of the definitely anti-Darwinian evolutionist\r\nSpencer.\r\n\r\nUnder the head of the directly and purely Darwinian elements I should\r\nclass as preeminent the work of Wallace and of Bates; for no two sets\r\nof facts have done more to fix in ordinary intelligent minds a belief\r\nin organic evolution and in natural selection as its guiding factor\r\nthan the facts of geographical distribution and of protective colour\r\nand mimicry. The facts of geology were difficult to grasp and the\r\npublic and theologians heard more often of the imperfection than of\r\nthe extent of the geological record. The witness of embryology,\r\ndepending to a great extent upon microscopic work, was and is beyond\r\nthe appreciation of persons occupied in fields of work other than\r\nbiology.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nFrom the influence in religion of scientific modes of thought we pass\r\nto the influence of particular biological conceptions. The former\r\neffect comes by way of analogy, example, encouragement and challenge;\r\ninspiring or provoking kindred or similar modes of thought in the\r\nfield of theology; the latter by a collision of opinions upon matters\r\nof fact or conjecture which seem to concern both science and religion.\r\n\r\nIn the case of Darwinism the story of this collision is familiar, and\r\nfalls under the heads of evolution and natural selection, the doctrine\r\nof descent with modification, and the doctrine of its guidance or\r\ndetermination by the struggle for existence between related varieties.\r\nThese doctrines, though associated and interdependent, and in popular\r\nthought not only combined but confused, must be considered separately.\r\nIt is true that the ancient doctrine of Evolution, in spite of the\r\ningenuity and ardour of Lamarck, remained a dream tantalising the\r\nintellectual ambition of naturalists, until the day when Darwin made\r\nit conceivable by suggesting the machinery of its guidance. And,\r\nfurther, the idea of natural selection has so effectively opened the\r\ndoor of research and stimulated observation in a score of principal\r\ndirections that, even if the Darwinian explanation became one day much\r\nless convincing than, in spite of recent criticism, it now is, yet its\r\npassing, supposing it to pass, would leave the doctrine of Evolution\r\nimmeasurably and permanently strengthened. For in the interests of the\r\ntheory of selection, \"Für Darwin,\" as Müller wrote, facts have been\r\ncollected which remain in any case evidence of the reality of descent\r\nwith modification.\r\n\r\nBut still, though thus united in the modern history of convictions,\r\nthough united and confused in the collision of biological and\r\ntraditional opinion, yet evolution and natural selection must be\r\nseparated in theological no less than in biological estimation.\r\nEvolution seemed inconsistent with Creation; natural selection with\r\nProvidence and Divine design.\r\n\r\nDiscussion was maintained about these points for many years and with\r\nmuch dark heat. It ranged over many particular topics and engaged\r\nminds different in tone, in quality, and in accomplishment. There was\r\nat most times a degree of misconception. Some naturalists attributed\r\nto theologians in general a poverty of thought which belonged really\r\nto men of a particular temper or training. The \"timid theism\"\r\ndiscerned in Darwin by so cautious a theologian as Liddon[225] was\r\nsupposed by many biologists to be the necessary foundation of an\r\nhonest Christianity. It was really more characteristic of devout\r\n_naturalists_ like Philip Henry Gosse, than of religious believers as\r\nsuch.[226] The study of theologians more considerable and even more\r\ntypically conservative than Liddon does not confirm the description of\r\nreligious intolerance given in good faith, but in serious ignorance,\r\nby a disputant so acute, so observant and so candid as Huxley.\r\nSomething hid from each other's knowledge the devoted pilgrims in two\r\ngreat ways of thought. The truth may be, that naturalists took their\r\nview of what creation was from Christian men of science who naturally\r\nlooked in their own special studies for the supports and illustrations\r\nof their religious belief. Of almost every labourious student it may\r\nbe said: \"_Hic ab arte sua non recessit_.\" And both the believing and\r\nthe denying naturalists, confining habitual attention to a part of\r\nexperience, are apt to affirm and deny with trenchant vigour and\r\nsomething of a narrow clearness \"_Qui respiciunt ad pauca, de facili\r\npronunciant_.\"[227]\r\n\r\nNewman says of some secular teachers that \"they persuade the world of\r\nwhat is false by urging upon it what is true.\" Of some early opponents\r\nof Darwin it might be said by a candid friend that, in all sincerity\r\nof devotion to truth, they tried to persuade the world of what is true\r\nby urging upon it what is false. If naturalists took their version of\r\northodoxy from amateurs in theology, some conservative Christians,\r\ninstead of learning what evolution meant to its regular exponents,\r\ntook their view of it from celebrated persons, not of the front rank\r\nin theology or in thought, but eager to take account of public\r\nmovements and able to arrest public attention.\r\n\r\nCleverness and eloquence on both sides certainly had their share in\r\nproducing the very great and general disturbance of men's minds in the\r\nearly days of Darwinian teaching. But by far the greater part of that\r\ndisturbance was due to the practical novelty and the profound\r\nimportance of the teaching itself, and to the fact that the\r\ncontroversy about evolution quickly became much more public than any\r\ncontroversy of equal seriousness had been for many generations.\r\n\r\nWe must not think lightly of that great disturbance because it has, in\r\nsome real sense, done its work, and because it is impossible in days\r\nof more coolness and light, to recover a full sense of its very real\r\ndifficulties.\r\n\r\nThose who would know them better should add to the calm records of\r\nDarwin[228] and to the story of Huxley's impassioned championship, all\r\nthat they can learn of George Romanes.[229] For his life was absorbed\r\nin this very struggle and reproduced its stages. It began in a certain\r\nassured simplicity of biblical interpretation; it went on, through the\r\nglories and adventures of a paladin in Darwin's train, to the darkness\r\nand dismay of a man who saw all his most cherished beliefs rendered,\r\nas he thought, incredible.[230] He lived to find the freer faith for\r\nwhich process and purpose are not irreconcilable, but necessary to one\r\nanother. His development, scientific, intellectual and moral, was\r\nitself of high significance; and its record is of unique value to our\r\nown generation, so near the age of that doubt and yet so far from it;\r\ncertainly still much in need of the caution and courage by which past\r\nendurance prepares men for new emergencies. We have little enough\r\nreason to be sure that in the discussions awaiting us we shall do as\r\nwell as our predecessors in theirs. Remembering their endurance of\r\nmental pain, their ardour in mental labour, the heroic temper and the\r\nhigh sincerity of controversialists on either side, we may well speak\r\nof our fathers in such words of modesty and self-judgment as Drayton\r\nused when he sang the victors of Agincourt. The progress of biblical\r\nstudy, in the departments of Introduction and Exegesis, resulting in\r\nthe recovery of a point of view anciently tolerated if not prevalent,\r\nhas altered some of the conditions of that discussion. In the years\r\nnear 1858, the witness of Scripture was adduced both by Christian\r\nadvocates and their critics as if unmistakably irreconcilable with\r\nEvolution.\r\n\r\nHuxley[231] found the path of the blameless naturalist everywhere\r\nblocked by \"Moses\": the believer in revelation was generally held to\r\nbe forced to a choice between revealed cosmogony and the scientific\r\naccount of origins. It is not clear how far the change in Biblical\r\ninterpretation is due to natural science, and how far to the vital\r\nmovements of theological study which have been quite independent of\r\nthe controversy about species. It belongs to a general renewal of\r\nChristian movement, the recovery of a heritage. \"Special\r\nCreation\"--really a biological rather than a theological\r\nconception,--seems in its rigid form to have been a recent element\r\neven in English biblical orthodoxy.\r\n\r\nThe Middle Ages had no suspicion that religious faith forbad inquiry\r\ninto the natural origination of the different forms of life.\r\nBartholomaeus Anglicus, an English Franciscan of the thirteenth\r\ncentury, was a mutationist in his way, as Aristotle, \"the Philosopher\"\r\nof the Christian Schoolmen, had been in his. So late as the\r\nseventeenth century, as we learn not only from early proceedings of\r\nthe Royal Society, but from a writer so homely and so regularly pious\r\nas Walton, the variation of species and \"spontaneous\" generations had\r\nno theological bearing, except as instances of that various wonder of\r\nthe world which in devout minds is food for devotion.\r\n\r\nIt was in the eighteenth century that the harder statement took shape.\r\nSomething in the preciseness of that age, its exaltation of law, its\r\ncold passion for a stable and measured universe, its cold denial, its\r\ncold affirmation of the power of God, a God of ice, is the occasion of\r\nthat rigidity of religious thought about the living world which Darwin\r\nby accident challenged, or rather by one of those movements of genius\r\nwhich, Goethe[232] declares, are \"elevated above all earthly control.\"\r\n\r\nIf religious thought in the eighteenth century was aimed at a fixed\r\nand nearly finite world of spirit, it followed in all these respects\r\nthe secular and critical lead. \"La philosophie réformatrice du\r\nXVIII^{e} siècle[233] ramenait la nature et la société à des\r\nmécanismes que la pensée réfléchie peut concevoir et récomposer.\" In\r\nfact, religion in a mechanical age is condemned if it takes any but a\r\nmechanical tone. Butler's thought was too moving, too vital, too\r\nevolutionary, for the sceptics of his time. In a rationalist,\r\nencyclopaedic period, religion also must give hard outline to its\r\nfacts, it must be able to display its secret to any sensible man in\r\nthe language used by all sensible men. Milton's prophetic genius\r\nfurnished the eighteenth century, out of the depth of the passionate\r\nage before it, with the theological tone it was to need. In spite of\r\nthe austere magnificence of his devotion, he gives to smaller souls a\r\ndangerous lead. The rigidity of Scripture exegesis belonged to this\r\nstately but imperfectly sensitive mode of thought. It passed away with\r\nthe influence of the older rationalists whose precise denials matched\r\nthe precise and limited affirmations of the static orthodoxy.\r\n\r\nI shall, then, leave the specially biblical aspect of the\r\ndebate--interesting as it is and even useful, as in Huxley's\r\ncorrespondence with the Duke of Argyll and others in 1892[234]--in\r\norder to consider without complication the permanent elements of\r\nChristian thought brought into question by the teaching of evolution.\r\n\r\nSuch permanent elements are the doctrine of God as Creator of the\r\nuniverse, and the doctrine of man as spiritual and unique. Upon both\r\nthe doctrine of evolution seemed to fall with crushing force.\r\n\r\nWith regard to Man I leave out, acknowledging a grave omission, the\r\ndoctrine of the Fall and of Sin. And I do so because these have not\r\nyet, as I believe, been adequately treated: here the fruitful reaction\r\nto the stimulus of evolution is yet to come. The doctrine of sin,\r\nindeed, falls principally within the scope of that discussion which\r\nhas followed or displaced the Darwinian; and without it the Fall\r\ncannot be usefully considered. For the question about the Fall is a\r\nquestion not merely of origins, but of the interpretation of moral\r\nfacts whose moral reality must first be established.\r\n\r\nI confine myself therefore to Creation and the dignity of man.\r\n\r\nThe meaning of evolution, in the most general terms, is that the\r\ndifferentiation of forms is not essentially separate from their\r\nbehaviour and use; that if these are within the scope of study, that\r\nis also; that the world has taken the form we see by movements not\r\nunlike those we now see in progress; that what may be called proximate\r\norigins are continuous in the way of force and matter, continuous in\r\nthe way of life, with actual occurrences and actual characteristics.\r\nAll this has no revolutionary bearing upon the question of ultimate\r\norigins. The whole is a statement about process. It says nothing to\r\nmetaphysicians about cause. It simply brings within the scope of\r\nobservation or conjecture that series of changes which has given their\r\nspecial characters to the different parts of the world we see. In\r\nparticular, evolutionary science aspires to the discovery of the\r\nprocess or order of the appearance of life itself: if it were to\r\nachieve its aim it could say nothing of the cause of this or indeed of\r\nthe most familiar occurrences. We should have become spectators or\r\nconvinced historians of an event which, in respect of its cause and\r\nultimate meaning, would be still impenetrable.\r\n\r\nWith regard to the origin of species, supposing life already\r\nestablished, biological science has the well founded hopes and the\r\nmeasure of success with which we are all familiar. All this has, it\r\nwould seem, little chance of collision with a consistent theism, a\r\ndoctrine which has its own difficulties unconnected with any\r\nparticular view of order or process. But when it was stated that\r\nspecies had arisen by processes through which new species were still\r\nbeing made, evolutionism came into collision with a statement,\r\ntraditionally religious, that species were formed and fixed once for\r\nall and long ago.\r\n\r\nWhat is the theological import of such a statement when it is regarded\r\nas essential to belief in God? Simply that God's activity, with\r\nrespect to the formation of living creatures, ceased at some point in\r\npast time.\r\n\r\n\"God rested\" is made the touchstone of orthodoxy. And when, under the\r\npressure of the evidences, we found ourselves obliged to acknowledge\r\nand assert the present and persistent power of God, in the maintenance\r\nand in the continued formation of \"types,\" what happened was the\r\nabolition of a time-limit. We were forced only to a bolder claim, to\r\na theistic language less halting, more consistent, more thorough in\r\nits own line, as well as better qualified to assimilate and modify\r\nsuch schemes as Von Hartmann's philosophy of the Unconscious--a\r\nphilosophy, by the way, quite intolerant of a merely mechanical\r\nevolution.[235]\r\n\r\nHere was not the retrenchment of an extravagant assertion, but the\r\nexpansion of one which was faltering and inadequate. The traditional\r\nstatement did not need paring down so as to pass the meshes of a new\r\nand exacting criticism. It was itself a net meant to surround and\r\nenclose experience; and we must increase its size and close its mesh\r\nto hold newly disclosed facts of life. The world, which had seemed a\r\nfixed picture or model, gained first perspective and then solidity and\r\nmovement. We had a glimpse of organic _history_; and Christian thought\r\nbecame more living and more assured as it met the larger view of life.\r\n\r\nHowever unsatisfactory the new attitude might be to our critics, to\r\nChristians the reform was positive. What was discarded was a\r\nlimitation, a negation. The movement was essentially conservative,\r\neven actually reconstructive. For the language disused was a language\r\ninconsistent with the definitions of orthodoxy; it set bounds to the\r\ninfinite, and by implication withdrew from the creative rule all such\r\nprocesses as could be brought within the descriptions of research. It\r\nascribed fixity and finality to that \"creature\" in which an apostle\r\ntaught us to recognise the birth-struggles of an unexhausted progress.\r\nIt tended to banish mystery from the world we see, and to confine it\r\nto a remote first age.\r\n\r\nIn the reformed, the restored, language of religion, Creation became\r\nagain not a link in a rational series to complete a circle of the\r\nsciences, but the mysterious and permanent relation between the\r\ninfinite and the finite, between the moving changes we know in part,\r\nand the Power, after the fashion of that observation, unknown, which\r\nis itself \"unmoved all motion's source.\"[236]\r\n\r\nWith regard to man it is hardly necessary, even were it possible, to\r\nillustrate the application of this bolder faith. When the record of\r\nhis high extraction fell under dispute, we were driven to a\r\ncontemplation of the whole of his life, rather than of a part and that\r\npart out of sight. We remembered again, out of Aristotle, that the\r\nresult of a process interprets its beginnings. We were obliged to read\r\nthe title of such dignity as we may claim, in results and still more\r\nin aspirations.\r\n\r\nSome men still measure the value of great present facts in\r\nlife--reason and virtue and sacrifice--by what a self-disparaged\r\nreason can collect of the meaner rudiments of these noble gifts. Mr.\r\nBalfour has admirably displayed the discrepancy, in this view, between\r\nthe alleged origin and the alleged authority of reason. Such an\r\nargument ought to be used not to discredit the confident reason, but\r\nto illuminate and dignify its dark beginnings, and to show that at\r\nevery step in the long course of growth a Power was at work which is\r\nnot included in any term or in all the terms of the series.\r\n\r\nI submit that the more men know of actual Christian teaching, its\r\nfidelity to the past, and its sincerity in face of discovery, the more\r\ncertainly they will judge that the stimulus of the doctrine of\r\nevolution has produced in the long run vigour as well as flexibility\r\nin the doctrine of Creation and of man.\r\n\r\nI pass from Evolution in general to Natural Selection.\r\n\r\nThe character in religious language which I have for short called\r\nmechanical was not absent in the argument from design as stated before\r\nDarwin. It seemed to have reference to a world conceived as fixed. It\r\npointed, not to the plastic capacity and energy of living matter, but\r\nto the fixed adaptation of this and that organ to an unchanging place\r\nor function.\r\n\r\nMr. Hobhouse has given us the valuable phrase \"a niche of organic\r\nopportunity.\" Such a phrase would have borne a different sense in\r\nnon-evolutionary thought. In that thought, the opportunity was an\r\nopportunity for the Creative Power, and Design appeared in the\r\npreparation of the organism to fit the niche. The idea of the niche\r\nand its occupant growing together from simpler to more complex mutual\r\nadjustment was unwelcome to this teleology. If the adaptation was\r\ntraced to the influence, through competition, of the environment, the\r\nold teleology lost an illustration and a proof. For the cogency of the\r\nproof in every instance depended upon the absence of explanation.\r\nWhere the process of adaptation was discerned, the evidence of Purpose\r\nor Design was weak. It was strong only when the natural antecedents\r\nwere not discovered, strongest when they could be declared\r\nundiscoverable.\r\n\r\nPaley's favourite word is \"Contrivance\"; and for him contrivance is\r\nmost certain where production is most obscure. He points out the\r\nphysiological advantage of the _valvulae conniventes_ to man, and the\r\nadvantage for teleology of the fact that they cannot have been formed\r\nby \"action and pressure.\" What is not due to pressure may be\r\nattributed to design, and when a \"mechanical\" process more subtle than\r\npressure was suggested, the case for design was so far weakened. The\r\ncumulative proof from the multitude of instances began to disappear\r\nwhen, in selection, a natural sequence was suggested in which all the\r\nadaptations might be reached by the motive power of life, and\r\nespecially when, as in Darwin's teaching, there was full recognition\r\nof the reactions of life to the stimulus of circumstance. \"The\r\norganism fits the niche,\" said the teleologist, \"because the Creator\r\nformed it so as to fit.\" \"The organism fits the niche,\" said the\r\nnaturalist, \"because unless it fitted it could not exist.\" \"It was\r\nfitted to survive,\" said the theologian. \"It survives because it\r\nfits,\" said the selectionist. The two forms of statement are not\r\nincompatible; but the new statement, by provision of an ideally\r\nuniversal explanation of process, was hostile to a doctrine of purpose\r\nwhich relied upon evidences always exceptional however numerous.\r\nScience persistently presses on to find the universal machinery of\r\nadaptation in this planet; and whether this be found in selection, or\r\nin direct-effect, or in vital reactions resulting in large changes, or\r\nin a combination of these and other factors, it must always be opposed\r\nto the conception of a Divine Power here and there but not everywhere\r\nactive.\r\n\r\nFor science, the Divine must be constant, operative everywhere and in\r\nevery quality and power, in environment and in organism, in stimulus\r\nand in reaction, in variation and in struggle, in hereditary\r\nequilibrium, and in \"the unstable state of species\"; equally present\r\non both sides of every strain, in all pressures and in all\r\nresistances, in short in the general wonder of life and the world. And\r\nthis is exactly what the Divine Power must be for religious faith.\r\n\r\nThe point I wish once more to make is that the necessary readjustment\r\nof teleology, so as to make it depend upon the contemplation of the\r\nwhole instead of a part, is advantageous quite as much to theology as\r\nto science. For the older view failed in courage. Here again our\r\ntheism was not sufficiently theistic.\r\n\r\nWhere results seemed inevitable, it dared not claim them as God-given.\r\nIn the argument from Design it spoke not of God in the sense of\r\ntheology, but of a Contriver, immensely, not infinitely wise and good,\r\nworking within a world, the scene, rather than the ever dependent\r\noutcome, of His Wisdom; working in such emergencies and opportunities\r\nas occurred, by forces not altogether within His control, towards an\r\nend beyond Himself. It gave us, instead of the awful reverence due to\r\nthe Cause of all substance and form, all love and wisdom, a\r\ndangerously detached appreciation of an ingenuity and benevolence\r\nmeritorious in aim and often surprisingly successful in contrivance.\r\n\r\nThe old teleology was more useful to science than to religion, and\r\nthe design-naturalists ought to be gratefully remembered by\r\nBiologists. Their search for evidences led them to an eager study of\r\nadaptations and of minute forms, a study such as we have now an\r\nincentive to in the theory of Natural Selection. One hardly meets with\r\nthe same ardour in microscopical research until we come to modern\r\nworkers. But the argument from Design was never of great importance to\r\nfaith. Still, to rid it of this character was worth all the stress and\r\nanxiety of the gallant old war. If Darwin had done nothing else for\r\nus, we are to-day deeply in his debt for this. The world is not less\r\nvenerable to us now, not less eloquent of the causing mind, rather\r\nmuch more eloquent and sacred. But our wonder is not that \"the\r\nunderjaw of the swine works under the ground\" or in any or all of\r\nthose particular adaptations which Paley collected with so much skill,\r\nbut that a purpose transcending, though resembling, our own purposes,\r\nis everywhere manifest; that what we live in is a whole, mutually\r\nsustaining, eventful and beautiful, where the \"dead\" forces feed the\r\nenergies of life, and life sustains a stranger existence, able in some\r\nreal measure to contemplate the whole, of which, mechanically\r\nconsidered, it is a minor product and a rare ingredient. Here, again,\r\nthe change was altogether positive. It was not the escape of a vessel\r\nin a storm with loss of spars and rigging, not a shortening of sail to\r\nsave the masts and make a port of refuge. It was rather the emergence\r\nfrom narrow channels to an open sea. We had propelled the great ship,\r\nfinding purchase here and there for slow and uncertain movement. Now,\r\nin deep water, we spread large canvas to a favouring breeze.\r\n\r\nThe scattered traces of design might be forgotten or obliterated. But\r\nthe broad impression of Order became plainer when seen at due distance\r\nand in sufficient range of effect, and the evidence of love and wisdom\r\nin the universe could be trusted more securely for the loss of the\r\nparticular calculation of their machinery.\r\n\r\nMany other topics of faith are affected by modern biology. In some of\r\nthese we have learnt at present only a wise caution, a wise\r\nuncertainty. We stand before the newly unfolded spectacle of\r\nsuffering, silenced; with faith not scientifically reassured but still\r\nholding fast certain other clues of conviction. In many important\r\ntopics we are at a loss. But in others, and among them those I have\r\nmentioned, we have passed beyond this negative state and find faith\r\npositively strengthened and more fully expressed.\r\n\r\nWe have gained also a language and a habit of thought more fit for the\r\ngreat and dark problems that remain, less liable to damaging\r\nconflicts, equipped for more rapid assimilation of knowledge. And by\r\nthis change biology itself is a gainer. For, relieved of fruitless\r\nencounters with popular religion, it may advance with surer aim along\r\nthe path of really scientific life-study which was reopened for modern\r\nmen by the publication of _The Origin of Species_.\r\n\r\nCharles Darwin regretted that, in following science, he had not done\r\n\"more direct good\"[237] to his fellow-creatures. He has, in fact,\r\nrendered substantial service to interests bound up with the daily\r\nconduct and hopes of common men; for his work has led to improvements\r\nin the preaching of the Christian faith.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 218: F.

B. BURY, LITT.D., LL.D.\r\n\r\n_Regius Professor of Modern History in the University of Cambridge_\r\n\r\n\r\n1. Evolution, and the principles associated with the Darwinian theory,\r\ncould not fail to exert a considerable influence on the studies\r\nconnected with the history of civilised man. The speculations which\r\nare known as \"philosophy of history,\" as well as the sciences of\r\nanthropology, ethnography, and sociology (sciences which though they\r\nstand on their own feet are for the historian auxiliary), have been\r\ndeeply affected by these principles. Historiographers, indeed, have\r\nwith few exceptions made little attempt to apply them; but the growth\r\nof historical study in the nineteenth century has been determined and\r\ncharacterised by the same general principle which has underlain the\r\nsimultaneous developments of the study of nature, namely the _genetic\r\nidea_. The \"historical\" conception of nature, which has produced the\r\nhistory of the solar system, the story of the earth, the genealogies\r\nof telluric organisms, and has revolutionised natural science, belongs\r\nto the same order of thought as the conception of human history as a\r\ncontinuous, genetic, causal process--a conception which has\r\nrevolutionised historical research and made it scientific. Before\r\nproceeding to consider the application of evolutional principles, it\r\nwill be pertinent to notice the rise of this new view.\r\n\r\n2. With the Greeks and Romans history had been either a descriptive\r\nrecord or had been written in practical interests. The most eminent\r\nof the ancient historians were pragmatical; that is, they regarded\r\nhistory as an instructress in statesmanship, or in the art of war, or\r\nin morals. Their records reached back such a short way, their\r\nexperience was so brief, that they never attained to the conception of\r\ncontinuous process, or realised the significance of time; and they\r\nnever viewed the history of human societies as a phenomenon to be\r\ninvestigated for its own sake. In the middle ages there was still less\r\nchance of the emergence of the ideas of progress and development. Such\r\nnotions were excluded by the fundamental doctrines of the dominant\r\nreligion which bounded and bound men's minds. As the course of history\r\nwas held to be determined from hour to hour by the arbitrary will of\r\nan extra cosmic person, there could be no self-contained causal\r\ndevelopment, only a dispensation imposed from without. And as it was\r\nbelieved that the world was within no great distance from the end of\r\nthis dispensation, there was no motive to take much interest in\r\nunderstanding the temporal, which was to be only temporary.\r\n\r\nThe intellectual movements of the fifteenth and sixteenth centuries\r\nprepared the way for a new conception, but it did not emerge\r\nimmediately. The historians of the Renaissance period simply reverted\r\nto the ancient pragmatical view. For Machiavelli, exactly as for\r\nThucydides and Polybius, the use of studying history was instruction\r\nin the art of politics. The Renaissance itself was the appearance of a\r\nnew culture, different from anything that had gone before; but at the\r\ntime men were not conscious of this; they saw clearly that the\r\ntraditions of classical antiquity had been lost for a long period, and\r\nthey were seeking to revive them, but otherwise they did not perceive\r\nthat the world had moved, and that their own spirit, culture, and\r\nconditions were entirely unlike those of the thirteenth century. It\r\nwas hardly till the seventeenth century that the presence of a new\r\nage, as different from the middle ages as from the ages of Greece and\r\nRome, was fully realised. It was then that the triple division of\r\nancient, medieval, and modern was first applied to the history of\r\nwestern civilisation. Whatever objections may be urged against this\r\ndivision, which has now become almost a category of thought, it marks\r\na most significant advance in man's view of his own past. He has\r\nbecome conscious of the immense changes in civilisation which have\r\ncome about slowly in the course of time, and history confronts him\r\nwith a new aspect. He has to explain how those changes have been\r\nproduced, how the transformations were effected. The appearance of\r\nthis problem was almost simultaneous with the rise of rationalism, and\r\nthe great historians and thinkers of the eighteenth century, such as\r\nMontesquieu, Voltaire, Gibbon, attempted to explain the movement of\r\ncivilisation by purely natural causes. These brilliant writers\r\nprepared the way for the genetic history of the following century. But\r\nin the spirit of the _Aufklärung_, that eighteenth-century\r\nEnlightenment to which they belonged, they were concerned to judge all\r\nphenomena before the tribunal of reason; and the apotheosis of\r\n\"reason\" tended to foster a certain superior _a priori_ attitude,\r\nwhich was not favourable to objective treatment and was incompatible\r\nwith a \"historical sense.\" Moreover the traditions of pragmatical\r\nhistoriography had by no means disappeared.\r\n\r\n3. In the first quarter of the nineteenth century the meaning of\r\ngenetic history was fully realised. \"Genetic\" perhaps is as good a\r\nword as can be found for the conception which in this century was\r\napplied to so many branches of knowledge in the spheres both of nature\r\nand of mind. It does not commit us to the doctrine proper of\r\nevolution, nor yet to any teleological hypothesis such as is implied\r\nin \"progress.\" For history it meant that the present condition of the\r\nhuman race is simply and strictly the result of a causal series (or\r\nset of causal series)--a continuous succession of changes, where each\r\nstate arises causally out of the preceding; and that the business of\r\nhistorians is to trace this genetic process, to explain each change,\r\nand ultimately to grasp' the complete development of the life of\r\nhumanity. Three influential writers, who appeared at this stage and\r\nhelped to initiate a new period of research, may specially be\r\nmentioned. Ranke in 1824 definitely repudiated the pragmatical view\r\nwhich ascribes to history the duties of an instructress, and with no\r\nless decision renounced the function, assumed by the historians of the\r\n_Aufklärung_, to judge the past; it was his business, he said, merely\r\nto show how things really happened. Niebuhr was already working in the\r\nsame spirit and did more than any other writer to establish the\r\nprinciple that historical transactions must be related to the ideas\r\nand conditions of their age. Savigny about the same time founded the\r\n\"historical school\" of law. He sought to show that law was not the\r\ncreation of an enlightened will, but grew out of custom and was\r\ndeveloped by a series of adaptations and rejections, thus applying the\r\nconception of evolution. He helped to diffuse the notion that all the\r\ninstitutions of a society or a nation are as closely interconnected as\r\nthe parts of a living organism.\r\n\r\n4. The conception of the history of man as a causal development meant\r\nthe elevation of historical inquiry to the dignity of a science. Just\r\nas the study of bees cannot become scientific so long as the student's\r\ninterest in them is only to procure honey or to derive moral lessons\r\nfrom the labours of \"the little busy bee,\" so the history of human\r\nsocieties cannot become the object of pure scientific investigation so\r\nlong as man estimates its value in pragmatical scales. Nor can it\r\nbecome a science until it is conceived as lying entirely within a\r\nsphere in which the law of cause and effect has unreserved and\r\nunrestricted dominion. On the other hand, once history is envisaged as\r\na causal process, which contains within itself the explanation of the\r\ndevelopment of man from his primitive state to the point which he has\r\nreached, such a process necessarily becomes the object of scientific\r\ninvestigation and the interest in it is scientific curiosity.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, the instruments were sharpened and refined. Here\r\nWolf, a philologist with historical instinct, was a pioneer. His\r\n_Prolegomena_ to Homer (1795) announced new modes of attack.\r\nHistorical investigation was soon transformed by the elaboration of\r\nnew methods.\r\n\r\n5. \"Progress\" involves a judgment of value, which is not involved in\r\nthe conception of history as a genetic process. It is also an idea\r\ndistinct from that of evolution. Nevertheless it is closely related to\r\nthe ideas which revolutionised history at the beginning of the last\r\ncentury; it swam into men's ken simultaneously; and it helped\r\neffectively to establish the notion of history as a continuous process\r\nand to emphasise the significance of time. Passing over earlier\r\nanticipations, I may point to a _Discours_ of Turgot (1750), where\r\nhistory is presented as a process in which \"the total mass of the\r\nhuman race\" \"marches continually though sometimes slowly to an ever\r\nincreasing perfection.\" That is a clear statement of the conception\r\nwhich Turgot's friend Condorcet elaborated in the famous work,\r\npublished in 1795, _Esquisse d'un tableau historique des progrès de\r\nl'esprit humain_. This work first treated with explicit fulness the\r\nidea to which a leading role was to fall in the ideology of the\r\nnineteenth century. Condorcet's book reflects the triumphs of the\r\n_Tiers état_, whose growing importance had also inspired Turgot; it\r\nwas the political changes in the eighteenth century which led to the\r\ndoctrine, emphatically formulated by Condorcet, that the masses are\r\nthe most important element in the historical process. I dwell on this\r\nbecause, though Condorcet had no idea of evolution, the predominant\r\nimportance of the masses was the assumption which made it possible to\r\napply evolutional principles to history. And it enabled Condorcet\r\nhimself to maintain that the history of civilisation, a progress still\r\nfar from being complete, was a development conditioned by general\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\n6. The assimilation of society to an organism, which was a governing\r\nnotion in the school of Savigny, and the conception of progress,\r\ncombined to produce the idea of an organic development, in which the\r\nhistorian has to determine the central principle or leading character.\r\nThis is illustrated by the apotheosis of democracy in Tocqueville's\r\n_Démocratie en Amérique_, where the theory is maintained that \"the\r\ngradual and progressive development of equality is at once the past\r\nand the future of the history of men.\" The same two principles are\r\ncombined in the doctrine of Spencer (who held that society is an\r\norganism, though he also contemplated its being what he calls a\r\n\"super-organic aggregate\"),[238] that social evolution is a\r\nprogressive change from militarism to industrialism.\r\n\r\n7. The idea of development assumed another form in the speculations of\r\nGerman idealism. Hegel conceived the successive periods of history as\r\ncorresponding to the ascending phases or ideas in the self-evolution\r\nof his Absolute Being. His _Lectures on the Philosophy of History_\r\nwere published in 1837 after his death. His philosophy had a\r\nconsiderable effect, direct and indirect, on the treatment of history\r\nby historians, and although he was superficial and unscientific\r\nhimself in dealing with historical phenomena, he contributed much\r\ntowards making the idea of historical development familiar. Ranke was\r\ninfluenced, if not by Hegel himself, at least by the Idealistic\r\nphilosophies of which Hegel's was the greatest. He was inclined to\r\nconceive the stages in the process of history as marked by\r\nincarnations, as it were, of ideas, and sometimes speaks as if the\r\nideas were independent forces, with hands and feet. But while Hegel\r\ndetermined his ideas by _a priori_ logic, Ranke obtained his by\r\ninduction--by a strict investigation of the phenomena; so that he was\r\nscientific in his method and work, and was influenced by Hegelian\r\nprepossessions only in the kind of significance which he was disposed\r\nto ascribe to his results. It is to be noted that the theory of Hegel\r\nimplied a judgment of value; the movement was a progress towards\r\nperfection.\r\n\r\n8. In France, Comte approached the subject from a different side, and\r\nexercised, outside Germany, a far wider influence than Hegel. The 4th\r\nvolume of his _Cours de philosophie positive_, which appeared in 1839,\r\ncreated sociology and treated history as a part of this new science,\r\nnamely as \"social dynamics.\" Comte sought the key for unfolding\r\nhistorical development, in what he called the social-psychological\r\npoint of view, and he worked out the two ideas which had been\r\nenunciated by Condorcet: that the historian's attention should be\r\ndirected not, as hitherto, principally to eminent individuals, but to\r\nthe collective behaviour of the masses, as being the most important\r\nelement in the process; and that, as in nature, so in history, there\r\nare general laws, necessary and constant, which condition the\r\ndevelopment. The two points are intimately connected, for it is only\r\nwhen the masses are moved into the foreground that regularity,\r\nuniformity, and law can be conceived as applicable. To determine the\r\nsocial-psychological laws which have controlled the development is,\r\naccording to Comte, the task of sociologists and historians.\r\n\r\n9. The hypothesis of general laws operative in history was carried\r\nfurther in a book which appeared in England twenty years later and\r\nexercised an influence in Europe far beyond its intrinsic merit,\r\nBuckle's _History of Civilisation in England_ (1857-61). Buckle owed\r\nmuch to Comte, and followed him, or rather outdid him, in regarding\r\nintellect as the most important factor conditioning the upward\r\ndevelopment of man, so that progress, according to him, consisted in\r\nthe victory of the intellectual over the moral laws.\r\n\r\n10. The tendency of Comte and Buckle to assimilate history to the\r\nsciences of nature by reducing it to general \"laws,\" derived stimulus\r\nand plausibility from the vista offered by the study of statistics,\r\nin which the Belgian Quetelet, whose book _Sur l'homme_ appeared in\r\n1835, discerned endless possibilities. The astonishing uniformities\r\nwhich statistical inquiry disclosed led to the belief that it was only\r\na question of collecting a sufficient amount of statistical material,\r\nto enable us to predict how a given social group will act in a\r\nparticular case. Bourdeau, a disciple of this school, looks forward to\r\nthe time when historical science will become entirely quantitative.\r\nThe actions of prominent individuals, which are generally considered\r\nto have altered or determined the course of things, are obviously not\r\namenable to statistical computation or explicable by general laws.\r\nThinkers like Buckle sought to minimise their importance or explain\r\nthem away.\r\n\r\n11. These indications may suffice to show that the new efforts to\r\ninterpret history which marked the first half of the nineteenth\r\ncentury were governed by conceptions closely related to those which\r\nwere current in the field of natural science and which resulted in the\r\ndoctrine of evolution. The genetic principle, progressive development,\r\ngeneral laws, the significance of time, the conception of society as\r\nan organic aggregate, the metaphysical theory of history as the\r\nself-evolution of spirit,--all these ideas show that historical\r\ninquiry had been advancing independently on somewhat parallel lines to\r\nthe sciences of nature. It was necessary to bring this out in order to\r\nappreciate the influence of Darwinism.\r\n\r\n12. In the course of the dozen years which elapsed between the\r\nappearances of _The Origin of Species_ (observe that the first volume\r\nof Buckle's work was published just two years before) and of _The\r\nDescent of Man_ (1871), the hypothesis of Lamarck that man is the\r\nco-descendant with other species of some lower extinct form was\r\nadmitted to have been raised to the rank of an established fact by\r\nmost thinkers whose brains were not working under the constraint of\r\ntheological authority.\r\n\r\nOne important effect of the discovery of this fact (I am not speaking\r\nnow of the Darwinian explanation) was to assign to history a definite\r\nplace in the coordinated whole of knowledge, and relate it more\r\nclosely to other sciences. It had indeed a defined logical place in\r\nsystems such as Hegel's and Comte's; but Darwinism certified its\r\nstanding convincingly and without more ado. The prevailing doctrine\r\nthat man was created _ex abrupto_ had placed history in an isolated\r\nposition, disconnected with the sciences of nature. Anthropology,\r\nwhich deals with the animal _anthropos_, now comes into line with\r\nzoology, and brings it into relation with history.[239] Man's\r\ncondition at the present day is the result of a series of\r\ntransformations, going back to the most primitive phase of society,\r\nwhich is the ideal (unattainable) beginning of history. But that\r\nbeginning had emerged without any breach of continuity from a\r\ndevelopment which carries us back to a quadrimane ancestor, still\r\nfurther back (according to Darwin's conjecture) to a marine animal of\r\nthe ascidian type, and then through remoter periods to the lowest form\r\nof organism. It is essential in this theory that though links have\r\nbeen lost there was no break in the gradual development; and this\r\nconception of a continuous progress in the evolution of life,\r\nresulting in the appearance of uncivilised Anthropos, helped to\r\nreinforce, and increase a belief in, the conception of the history of\r\ncivilised Anthropos as itself also a continuous progressive\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\n13. Thus the diffusion of the Darwinian theory of the origin of man,\r\nby emphasising the idea of continuity and breaking down the barriers\r\nbetween the human and animal kingdoms, has had an important effect in\r\nestablishing the position of history among the sciences which deal\r\nwith telluric development. The perspective of history is merged in a\r\nlarger perspective of development. As one of the objects of biology is\r\nto find the exact steps in the genealogy of man from the lowest\r\norganic form, so the scope of history is to determine the stages in\r\nthe unique causal series from the most rudimentary to the present\r\nstate of human civilisation.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed that the interest in historical research implied\r\nby this conception need not be that of Comte. In the Positive\r\nPhilosophy history is part of sociology; the interest in it is to\r\ndiscover the sociological laws. In the view of which I have just\r\nspoken, history is permitted to be an end in itself; the\r\nreconstruction of the genetic process is an independent interest. For\r\nthe purpose of the reconstruction, sociology, as well as physical\r\ngeography, biology, psychology, is necessary; the sociologist and the\r\nhistorian play into each other's hands; but the object of the former\r\nis to establish generalisations; the aim of the latter is to trace in\r\ndetail a singular causal sequence.\r\n\r\n14. The success of the evolutional theory helped to discredit the\r\nassumption or at least the invocation of transcendent causes.\r\nPhilosophically of course it is compatible with theism, but historians\r\nhave for the most part desisted from invoking the naive conception of\r\na \"god in history\" to explain historical movements. A historian may be\r\na theist; but, so far as his work is concerned, this particular belief\r\nis otiose. Otherwise indeed (as was remarked above) history could not\r\nbe a science; for with a _deus ex machina_ who can be brought on the\r\nstage to solve difficulties scientific treatment is a farce. The\r\ntranscendent element had appeared in a more subtle form through the\r\ninfluence of German philosophy. I noticed how Ranke is prone to refer\r\nto ideas as if they were transcendent existences manifesting\r\nthemselves in the successive movements of history. It is intelligible\r\nto speak of certain ideas as controlling, in a given period,--for\r\ninstance, the idea of nationality; but from the scientific point of\r\nview, such ideas have no existence outside the minds of individuals\r\nand are purely psychical forces; and a historical \"idea,\" if it does\r\nnot exist in this form, is merely a way of expressing a synthesis of\r\nthe historian himself.\r\n\r\n15. From the more general influence of Darwinism on the place of\r\nhistory in the system of human knowledge, we may turn to the influence\r\nof the principles and methods by which Darwin explained development.\r\nIt had been recognised even by ancient writers (such as Aristotle and\r\nPolybius) that physical circumstances (geography, climate) were\r\nfactors conditioning the character and history of a race or society.\r\nIn the sixteenth century Bodin emphasised these factors, and many\r\nsubsequent writers took them into account. The investigations of\r\nDarwin, which brought them into the foreground, naturally promoted\r\nattempts to discover in them the chief key to the growth of\r\ncivilisation. Comte had expressly denounced the notion that the\r\nbiological methods of Lamarck could be applied to social man. Buckle\r\nhad taken account of natural influences, but had relegated them to a\r\nsecondary plane, compared with psychological factors. But the\r\nDarwinian theory made it tempting to explain the development of\r\ncivilisation in terms of \"adaptation to environment,\" \"struggle for\r\nexistence,\" \"natural selection,\" \"survival of the fittest,\" etc.[240]\r\n\r\nThe operation of these principles cannot be denied. Man is still an\r\nanimal, subject to zoological as well as mechanical laws. The dark\r\ninfluence of heredity continues to be effective; and psychical\r\ndevelopment had begun in lower organic forms,--perhaps with life\r\nitself. The organic and the social struggles for existence are\r\nmanifestations of the same principle. Environment and climatic\r\ninfluence must be called in to explain not only the differentiation of\r\nthe great racial sections of humanity, but also the varieties within\r\nthese sub-species and, it may be, the assimilation of distinct\r\nvarieties. Ritter's _Anthropogeography_ has opened a useful line of\r\nresearch. But on the other hand, it is urged that, in explaining the\r\ncourse of history, these principles do not take us very far, and that\r\nit is chiefly for the primitive ultra-prehistoric period that they can\r\naccount for human development. It may be said that, so far as concerns\r\nthe actions and movements of men which are the subject of recorded\r\nhistory, physical environment has ceased to act mechanically, and in\r\norder to affect their actions must affect their wills first; and that\r\nthis psychical character of the causal relations substantially alters\r\nthe problem. The development of human societies, it may be argued,\r\nderives a completely new character from the dominance of the conscious\r\npsychical element, creating as it does new conditions (inventions,\r\nsocial institutions, etc.) which limit and counteract the operation of\r\nnatural selection, and control and modify the influence of physical\r\nenvironment. Most thinkers agree now that the chief clews to the\r\ngrowth of civilisation must be sought in the psychological sphere.\r\nImitation, for instance, is a principle which is probably more\r\nsignificant for the explanation of human development than natural\r\nselection. Darwin himself was conscious that his principles had only a\r\nvery restricted application in this sphere, as is evident from his\r\ncautious and tentative remarks in the 5th chapter of his _Descent of\r\nMan_. He applied natural selection to the growth of the intellectual\r\nfaculties and of the fundamental social instincts, and also to the\r\ndifferentiation of the great races or \"sub-species\" (Caucasian,\r\nAfrican, etc.) which differ in anthropological character.[241]\r\n\r\n16. But if it is admitted that the governing factors which concern the\r\nstudent of social development are of the psychical order, the\r\npreliminary success of natural science in explaining organic evolution\r\nby general principles encouraged sociologists to hope that social\r\nevolution could be explained on general principles also. The idea of\r\nCondorcet, Buckle, and others, that history could be assimilated to\r\nthe natural sciences was powerfully reinforced, and the notion that\r\nthe actual historical process, and every social movement involved in\r\nit, can be accounted for by sociological generalisations, so-called\r\n\"laws,\" is still entertained by many, in one form or another.\r\nDissentients from this view do not deny that the generalisations at\r\nwhich the sociologist arrives by the comparative method, by the\r\nanalysis of social factors, and by psychological deduction may be an\r\naid to the historian; but they deny that such uniformities are laws or\r\ncontain an explanation of the phenomena. They can point to the element\r\nof chance coincidence. This element must have played a part in the\r\nevents of organic evolution, but it has probably in a larger measure\r\nhelped to determine events in social evolution. The collision of two\r\nunconnected sequences may be fraught with great results. The sudden\r\ndeath of a leader or a marriage without issue, to take simple cases,\r\nhas again and again led to permanent political consequences. More\r\nemphasis is laid on the decisive actions of individuals, which cannot\r\nbe reduced under generalisations and which deflect the course of\r\nevents. If the significance of the individual will had been\r\nexaggerated to the neglect of the collective activity of the social\r\naggregate before Condorcet, his doctrine tended to eliminate as\r\nunimportant the roles of prominent men, and by means of this\r\nelimination it was possible to found sociology. But it may be urged\r\nthat it is patent on the face of history that its course has\r\nconstantly been shaped and modified by the wills of individuals,[242]\r\nwhich are by no means always the expression of the collective will;\r\nand that the appearance of such personalities at the given moments is\r\nnot a necessary outcome of the conditions and cannot be deduced. Nor\r\nis there any proof that, if such and such an individual had not been\r\nborn, some one else would have arisen to do what he did. In some cases\r\nthere is no reason to think that what happened need ever have come to\r\npass. In other cases, it seems evident that the actual change was\r\ninevitable, but in default of the man who initiated and guided it, it\r\nmight have been postponed, and, postponed or not, might have borne a\r\ndifferent cachet. I may illustrate by an instance which has just come\r\nunder my notice. Modern painting was founded by Giotto, and the\r\nItalian expedition of Charles VIII, near the close of the sixteenth\r\ncentury, introduced into France the fashion of imitating Italian\r\npainters. But for Giotto and Charles VIII, French painting might have\r\nbeen very different. It may be said that \"if Giotto had not appeared,\r\nsome other great imitator would have played a role analogous to his,\r\nand that without Charles VIII there would have been the commerce with\r\nItaly, which in the long run would have sufficed to place France in\r\nrelation with Italian artists. But the equivalent of Giotto might have\r\nbeen deferred for a century and probably would have been different;\r\nand commercial relations would have required ages to produce the\r\n_rayonnement imitatif_ of Italian art in France, which the expedition\r\nof the royal adventurer provoked in a few years.\"[243] Instances\r\nfurnished by political history are simply endless. Can we conjecture\r\nhow events would have moved if the son of Philip of Macedon had been\r\nan incompetent? The aggressive action of Prussia which astonished\r\nEurope in 1740 determined the subsequent history of Germany; but that\r\naction was anything but inevitable; it depended entirely on the\r\npersonality of Frederick the Great.\r\n\r\nHence it may be argued that the action of individual wills is a\r\ndetermining and disturbing factor, too significant and effective to\r\nallow history to be grasped by sociological formulae. The types and\r\ngeneral forms of development which the sociologist attempts to\r\ndisengage can only assist the historian in understanding the actual\r\ncourse of events. It is in the special domains of economic history and\r\n_Culturgeschichte_ which have come to the front in modern times that\r\ngeneralisation is most fruitful, but even in these it may be contended\r\nthat it furnishes only partial explanations.\r\n\r\n17. The truth is that Darwinism itself offers the best illustration of\r\nthe insufficiency of general laws to account for historical\r\ndevelopment. The part played by coincidence, and the part played by\r\nindividuals--limited by, and related to, general social\r\nconditions--render it impossible to deduce the course of the past\r\nhistory of man or to predict the future. But it is just the same with\r\norganic development. Darwin (or any other zoologist) could not deduce\r\nthe actual course of evolution from general principles. Given an\r\norganism and its environment, he could not show that it must evolve\r\ninto a more complex organism of a definite predetermined type; knowing\r\nwhat it has evolved into, he could attempt to discover and assign the\r\ndetermining causes. General principles do not account for a particular\r\nsequence; they embody necessary conditions; but there is a chapter of\r\naccidents too. It is the same in the case of history.\r\n\r\n18. Among the evolutional attempts to subsume the course of history under\r\ngeneral syntheses, perhaps the most important is that of Lamprecht, whose\r\n\"kulturhistorische\" attempt to discover and assign the determining causes.\r\nGerman history, exhibits the (indirect) influence of the Comtist school. It\r\nis based upon psychology, which, in his views, holds among the sciences of\r\nmind (_Geisteswissenschaften_) the same place (that of a\r\n_Grundwissenschaft_) which mechanics holds among the sciences of nature.\r\nHistory, by the same comparison, corresponds to biology, and, according to\r\nhim, it can only become scientific if it is reduced to general concepts\r\n(_Begriffe_). Historical movements and events are of a psychical character,\r\nand Lamprecht conceives a given phase of civilisation as \"a collective\r\npsychical condition (_seelischer Gesamtzustand_)\" controlling the period,\r\n\"a diapason which penetrates all psychical phenomena and thereby all\r\nhistorical events of the time.\"[244] He has worked out a series of such\r\nphases, \"ages of changing psychical diapason,\" in his _Deutsche\r\nGeschichte_, with the aim of showing that all the feelings and actions of\r\neach age can be explained by the diapason; and has attempted to prove that\r\nthese diapasons are exhibited in other social developments, and are\r\nconsequently not singular but typical. He maintains further that these ages\r\nsucceed each other in a definite order; the principle being that the\r\ncollective psychical development begins with the homogeneity of all the\r\nindividual members of a society and, through heightened psychical activity,\r\nadvances in the form of a continually increasing differentiation of the\r\nindividuals (this is akin to the Spencerian formula). This process,\r\nevolving psychical freedom from psychical constraint, exhibits a series of\r\npsychical phenomena which define successive periods of civilisation. The\r\nprocess depends on two simple principles, that no idea can disappear\r\nwithout leaving behind it an effect or influence, and that all psychical\r\nlife, whether in a person or a society, means change, the acquisition of\r\nnew mental contents. It follows that the new have to come to terms with the\r\nold, and this leads to a synthesis which determines the character of a new\r\nage. Hence the ages of civilisation are defined as the \"highest concepts\r\nfor subsuming without exception all psychical phenomena of the development\r\nof human societies, that is, of all historical events.\"[245] Lamprecht\r\ndeduces the idea of a special historical science, which might be called\r\n\"historical ethnology,\" dealing with the ages of civilisation, and bearing\r\nthe same relation to (descriptive or narrative) history as ethnology to\r\nethnography. Such a science obviously corresponds to Comte's social\r\ndynamics, and the comparative method, on which Comte laid so much emphasis,\r\nis the principal instrument of Lamprecht.\r\n\r\n19. I have dwelt on the fundamental ideas of Lamprecht, because they\r\nare not yet widely known in England, and because his system is the\r\nablest product of the sociological school of historians. It carries\r\nthe more weight as its author himself is a historical specialist, and\r\nhis historical syntheses deserve the most careful consideration. But\r\nthere is much in the process of development which on such assumptions\r\nis not explained, especially the initiative of individuals. Historical\r\ndevelopment does not proceed in a right line, without the choice of\r\ndiverging. Again and again, several roads are open to it, of which it\r\nchooses one--why? On Lamprecht's method, we may be able to assign the\r\nconditions which limit the psychical activity of men at a particular\r\nstage of evolution, but within those limits the individual has so many\r\noptions, such a wide room for moving, that the definition of those\r\nconditions, the \"psychical diapasons,\" is only part of the explanation\r\nof the particular development. The heel of Achilles in all historical\r\nspeculations of this class has been the role of the individual.\r\n\r\nThe increasing prominence of economic history has tended to encourage\r\nthe view that history can be explained in terms of general concepts or\r\ntypes. Marx and his school based their theory of human development on\r\nthe conditions of production, by which, according to them, all social\r\nmovements and historical changes are entirely controlled. The leading\r\npart which economic factors play in Lamprecht's system is significant,\r\nillustrating the fact that economic changes admit most readily this\r\nkind of treatment, because they have been less subject to direction or\r\ninterference by individual pioneers.\r\n\r\nPerhaps it may be thought that the conception of _social environment_\r\n(essentially psychical), on which Lamprecht's \"psychical diapasons\"\r\ndepend, is the most valuable and fertile conception that the historian\r\nowes to the suggestion of the science of biology--the conception of\r\nall particular historical actions and movements as (1) related to and\r\nconditioned by the social environment, and (2) gradually bringing\r\nabout a transformation of that environment. But no given\r\ntransformation can be proved to be necessary (predetermined). And\r\ntypes of development do not represent laws; their meaning and value\r\nlie in the help they may give to the historian, in investigating a\r\ncertain period of civilisation, to enable him to discover the\r\ninter-relations among the diverse features which it presents. They\r\nare, as some one has said, an instrument of heuretic method.\r\n\r\n20. The man engaged in special historical researches--which have been\r\npursued unremittingly for a century past, according to scientific\r\nmethods of investigating evidence (initiated by Wolf, Niebuhr,\r\nRanke)--have for the most part worked on the assumptions of genetic\r\nhistory or at least followed in the footsteps of those who fully\r\ngrasped the genetic point of view. But their aim has been to collect\r\nand sift evidence, and determine particular facts; comparatively few\r\nhave given serious thought to the lines of research and the\r\nspeculations which have been considered in this paper. They have been\r\nreasonably shy of compromising their work by applying theories which\r\nare still much debated and immature. But historiography cannot\r\npermanently evade the questions raised by these theories. One may\r\nventure to say that no historical change or transformation will be\r\nfully understood until it is explained how social environment acted on\r\nthe individual components of the society (both immediately and by\r\nheredity), and how the individuals reacted upon their environment. The\r\nproblem is psychical, but it is analogous to the main problem of the\r\nbiologist.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 238: A society presents suggestive analogies with an\r\norganism, but it certainly is not an organism, and sociologists who\r\ndraw inferences from the assumption of its organic nature must fall\r\ninto error. A vital organism and a society are radically distinguished\r\nby the fact that the individual components of the former, namely the\r\ncells, are morphologically as well as functionally differentiated,\r\nwhereas the individuals which compose a society are morphologically\r\nhomogeneous and only functionally differentiated. The resemblances and\r\nthe differences are worked out in E. de Majewski's striking book, _La\r\nScience de la Civilisation_. Paris. 1908.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 239: It is to be observed that history is (not only\r\ndifferent in scope but) not co-extensive with anthropology _in time_.\r\nFor it deals only with the development of man in societies, whereas\r\nanthropology includes in its definition the proto-anthropic period\r\nwhen _anthropos_ was still non-social, whether he lived in herds like\r\nthe chimpanzee, or alone like the male ourang-outang. (It has been\r\nwell shown by Majewski that congregations--herds, flocks, packs,\r\n&c.--of animals are not _societies_; the characteristic of a society\r\nis differentiation of function. Bee hives, ant hills, may be called\r\nquasi-societies; but in their case the classes which perform distinct\r\nfunctions are morphologically different.)]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 240: Recently O.

BOUGLÉ\r\n\r\n_Professor of Social Philosophy in the University of Toulouse and\r\nDeputy-Professor at the Sorbonne, Paris_\r\n\r\n\r\nHow has our conception of social phenomena, and of their history, been\r\naffected by Darwin's conception of Nature and the laws of its\r\ntransformation? To what extent and in what particular respects have\r\nthe discoveries and hypotheses of the author of _The Origin of\r\nSpecies_ aided the efforts of those who have sought to construct a\r\nscience of society?\r\n\r\nTo such a question it is certainly not easy to give any brief or\r\nprecise answer. We find traces of Darwinism almost everywhere.\r\nSociological systems differing widely from each other have laid claim\r\nto its authority; while, on the other hand, its influence has often\r\nmade itself felt only in combination with other influences. The\r\nDarwinian thread is worked into a hundred patterns along with other\r\nthreads.\r\n\r\nTo deal with the problem, we must, it seems, first of all distinguish\r\nthe more general conclusions in regard to the evolution of living\r\nbeings, which are the outcome of Darwinism, from the particular\r\nexplanations it offers of the ways and means by which that evolution\r\nis effected. That is to say, we must, as far as possible, estimate\r\nseparately the influence of Darwin as an evolutionist and Darwin as a\r\nselectionist.\r\n\r\nThe nineteenth century, said Cournot, has witnessed a mighty effort to\r\n\"réintégrer l'homme dans la nature.\" From divers quarters there has\r\nbeen a methodical reaction against the persistent dualism of the\r\nCartesian tradition, which was itself the unconscious heir of the\r\nChristian tradition. Even the philosophy of the eighteenth century,\r\nmaterialistic as were for the most part the tendencies of its leaders,\r\nseemed to revere man as a being apart, concerning whom laws might be\r\nformulated _à priori_. To bring him down from his pedestal there was\r\nneeded the marked predominance of positive researches wherein no\r\naccount was taken of the \"pride of man.\" There can be no doubt that\r\nDarwin has done much to familiarise us with this attitude. Take for\r\ninstance the first part of _The Descent of Man_: it is an accumulation\r\nof typical facts, all tending to diminish the distance between us and\r\nour brothers, the lower animals. One might say that the naturalist had\r\nhere taken as his motto, \"Whosoever shall exalt himself shall be\r\nabased; and he that shall humble himself shall be exalted.\" Homologous\r\nstructures, the survival in man of certain organs of animals, the\r\nrudiments in the animal of certain human faculties, a multitude of\r\nfacts of this sort, led Darwin to the conclusion that there is no\r\nground for supposing that the \"king of the universe\" is exempt from\r\nuniversal laws. Thus belief in the _imperium in imperio_ has been, as\r\nit were, whittled away by the progress of the naturalistic spirit,\r\nitself continually strengthened by the conquests of the natural\r\nsciences. The tendency may, indeed, drag the social sciences into\r\noverstrained analogies, such, for instance, as the assimilation of\r\nsocieties to organisms. But it will, at least, have had the merit of\r\nhelping sociology to shake off the pre-conception that the groups\r\nformed by men are artificial, and that history is completely at the\r\nmercy of chance. Some years before the appearance of _The Origin of\r\nSpecies_, August Comte had pointed out the importance, as regards the\r\nunification of positive knowledge, of the conviction that the social\r\nworld, the last refuge of spiritualism, is itself subject to\r\ndeterminism. It cannot be doubted that the movement of thought which\r\nDarwin's discoveries promoted contributed to the spread of this\r\nconviction, by breaking down the traditional barrier which cut man off\r\nfrom Nature.\r\n\r\nBut Nature, according to modern naturalists, is no immutable thing: it\r\nis rather perpetual movement, continual progression. Their discoveries\r\nbatter a breach directly into the Aristotelian notion of species; they\r\nrefuse to see in the animal world a collection of immutable types,\r\ndistinct from all eternity, and corresponding, as Cuvier said, to so\r\nmany particular thoughts of the Creator. Darwin especially\r\ncongratulated himself upon having been able to deal this doctrine the\r\n_coup de grâce_: immutability is, he says, his chief enemy; and he is\r\nconcerned to show--therein following up Lyell's work--that everything\r\nin the organic world, as in the inorganic, is explained by insensible\r\nbut incessant transformations. \"Nature makes no leaps\"--\"Nature knows\r\nno gaps\": these two _dicta_ form, as it were, the two landmarks\r\nbetween which Darwin's idea of transformation is worked out. That is\r\nto say, the development of Darwinism is calculated to further the\r\napplication of the philosophy of Becoming to the study of human\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nThe progress of the natural sciences thus brings unexpected\r\nreinforcements to the revolution which the progress of historical\r\ndiscipline had begun. The first attempt to constitute an actual\r\nscience of social phenomena--that, namely, of the economists--had\r\nresulted in laws which were called natural, and which were believed to\r\nbe eternal and universal, valid for all times and all places. But this\r\nperpetuality, brother, as Knies said, of the immutability of the old\r\nzoology, did not long hold out against the ever-swelling tide of the\r\nhistorical movement. Knowledge of the transformations that had taken\r\nplace in language, of the early phases of the family, of religion, of\r\nproperty, had all favoured the revival of the Heraclitean view:\r\n[Greek: panta rei]. As to the categories of political economy, it was\r\nsoon to be recognised, as by Lasalle, that they too are only\r\nhistorical. The philosophy of history, moreover, gave expression\r\nunder various forms to the same tendency. Hegel declares that \"all\r\nthat is real is rational,\" but at the same time he shows that all that\r\nis real is ephemeral, and that for history there is nothing fixed\r\nbeneath the sun. It is this sense of universal evolution that Darwin\r\ncame with fresh authority to enlarge. It was in the name of biological\r\nfacts themselves that he taught us to see only slow metamorphoses in\r\nthe history of institutions, and to be always on the outlook for\r\nsurvivals side by side with rudimentary forms. Anyone who reads\r\n_Primitive Culture_, by Tylor,--a writer closely connected with\r\nDarwin--will be able to estimate the services which these cardinal\r\nideas were to render to the social sciences when the age of\r\ncomparative research had succeeded to that of _à priori_ construction.\r\n\r\nLet us note, moreover, that the philosophy of Becoming in passing through\r\nthe Darwinian biology became, as it were, filtered; it got rid of those\r\ntraces of finalism, which, under different forms, it had preserved through\r\nall the systems of German Romanticism. Even in Herbert Spencer, it has been\r\nplausibly argued, one can detect something of that sort of mystic\r\nconfidence in forces spontaneously directing life, which forms the very\r\nessence of those systems. But Darwin's observations were precisely\r\ncalculated to render such an hypothesis futile. At first people may have\r\nfailed to see this; and we call to mind the ponderous sarcasms of Flourens\r\nwhen he objected to the theory of Natural Selection that it attributed to\r\nnature a power of free choice. \"Nature endowed with will! That was the\r\nfinal error of last century; but the nineteenth no longer deals in\r\npersonifications.\"[246] In fact Darwin himself put his readers on their\r\nguard against the metaphors he was obliged to use. The processes by which\r\nhe explains the survival of the fittest are far from affording any\r\nindication of the design of some transcendent breeder. Nor, if we look\r\nclosely, do they even imply immanent effort in the animal; the sorting out\r\ncan be brought about mechanically, simply by the action of the environment.\r\nIn this connection Huxley could with good reason maintain that Darwin's\r\noriginality consisted in showing how harmonies which hitherto had been\r\ntaken to imply the agency of intelligence and will could be explained\r\nwithout any such intervention. So, when later on, objective sociology\r\ndeclares that, even when social phenomena are in question, all finalist\r\npreconceptions must be distrusted if a science is to be constituted, it is\r\nto Darwin that its thanks are due; he had long been clearing paths for it\r\nwhich lay well away from the old familiar road trodden by so many theories\r\nof evolution.\r\n\r\nThis anti-finalist doctrine, when fully worked out, was, moreover,\r\ncalculated to aid in the needful dissociation of two notions: that of\r\nevolution and that of progress. In application to society these had\r\nlong been confounded; and, as a consequence, the general idea seemed\r\nto be that only one type of evolution was here possible. Do we not\r\ndetect such a view in Comte's sociology, and perhaps even in Herbert\r\nSpencer's? Whoever, indeed, assumes an end for evolution is naturally\r\ninclined to think that only one road leads to that end. But those\r\nwhose minds the Darwinian theory has enlightened are aware that the\r\ntransformations of living beings depend primarily upon their\r\nconditions, and that it is these conditions which are the agents of\r\nselection from among individual variations. Hence, it immediately\r\nfollows that transformations are not necessarily improvements. Here,\r\nDarwin's thought hesitated. Logically his theory proves, as Ray\r\nLankester pointed out, that the struggle for existence may have as its\r\noutcome degeneration as well as amelioration: evolution may be\r\nregressive as well as progressive. Then, too--and this is especially\r\nto be borne in mind--each species takes its good where it finds it,\r\nseeks its own path and survives as best it can. Apply this notion to\r\nsociety and you arrive at the theory of multilinear evolution.\r\nDivergencies will no longer surprise you. You will be forewarned not\r\nto apply to all civilisations the same measure of progress, and you\r\nwill recognise that types of evolution may differ just as social\r\nspecies themselves differ. Have we not here one of the conceptions\r\nwhich mark off sociology proper from the old philosophy of history?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut if we are to estimate the influence of Darwinism upon sociological\r\nconceptions, we must not dwell only upon the way in which Darwin\r\nimpressed the general notion of evolution upon the minds of thinkers.\r\nWe must go into details. We must consider the influence of the\r\nparticular theories by which he explained the mechanism of this\r\nevolution. The name of the author of _The Origin of Species_ has been\r\nespecially attached, as everyone knows, to the doctrines of \"natural\r\nselection\" and of \"struggle for existence,\" completed by the notion of\r\n\"individual variation.\" These doctrines were turned to account by very\r\ndifferent schools of social philosophy. Pessimistic and optimistic,\r\naristocratic and democratic, individualistic and socialistic systems\r\nwere to war with each other for years by casting scraps of Darwinism\r\nat each other's heads.\r\n\r\nIt was the spectacle of human contrivance that suggested to Darwin his\r\nconception of natural selection. It was in studying the methods of\r\npigeon breeders that he divined the processes by which nature, in the\r\nabsence of design, obtains analogous results in the differentiation of\r\ntypes. As soon as the importance of artificial selection in the\r\ntransformation of species of animals was understood, reflection\r\nnaturally turned to the human species, and the question arose, How far\r\ndo men observe, in connection with themselves, those laws of which\r\nthey make practical application in the case of animals? Here we come\r\nupon one of the ideas which guided the researches of Gallon, Darwin's\r\ncousin. The author of _Inquiries into Human Faculty and its\r\nDevelopment_,[247] has often expressed his surprise that, considering\r\nall the precautions taken, for example, in the breeding of horses,\r\nnone whatever are taken in the breeding of the human species. It seems\r\nto be forgotten that the species suffers when the \"fittest\" are not\r\nable to perpetuate their type. Ritchie, in his _Darwinism and\r\nPolitics_[248] reminds us of Darwin's remark that the institution of\r\nthe peerage might be defended on the ground that peers, owing to the\r\nprestige they enjoy, are enabled to select as wives \"the most\r\nbeautiful and charming women out of the lower ranks.\"[249] But, says\r\nGalton, it is as often as not \"heiresses\" that they pick out, and\r\nbirth statistics seem to show that these are either less robust or\r\nless fecund than others. The truth is that considerations continue to\r\npreside over marriage which are entirely foreign to the improvement of\r\ntype, much as this is a condition of general progress. Hence the\r\nimportance of completing Odin's and De Candolle's statistics which are\r\ndesigned to show how characters are incorporated in organisms, how\r\nthey are transmitted, how lost, and according to what law eugenic,\r\nelements depart from the mean or return to it.\r\n\r\nBut thinkers do not always content themselves with undertaking merely\r\nthe minute researches which the idea of Selection suggests. They are\r\neager to defend this or that thesis. In the name of this idea certain\r\nsocial anthropologists have recast the conception of the process of\r\ncivilisation, and have affirmed that Social Selection generally works\r\nagainst the trend of Natural Selection. Vacher de Lapouge--following\r\nup an observation by Broca on the point--enumerates the various\r\ninstitutions, or customs, such as the celibacy of priests and military\r\nconscription, which cause elimination or sterilisation of the bearers\r\nof certain superior qualities, intellectual or physical. In a more\r\ngeneral way he attacks the democratic movement, a movement, as P.\r\nBourget says, which is \"anti-physical\" and contrary to the natural\r\nlaws of progress; though it has been inspired \"by the dreams of that\r\nmost visionary of all centuries, the eighteenth.\"[250] The \"Equality\"\r\nwhich levels down and mixes (justly condemned, he holds, by the Comte\r\nde Gobineau), prevents the aristocracy of the blond dolichocephales\r\nfrom holding the position and playing the part which, in the interests\r\nof all, should belong to them. Otto Ammon, in his _Natural Selection\r\nin Man_, and in _The Social Order and its Natural Bases_,[251]\r\ndefended analogous doctrines in Germany; setting the curve\r\nrepresenting frequency of talent over against that of income, he\r\nattempted to show that all democratic measures which aim at promoting\r\nthe rise in the social scale of the talented are useless, if not\r\ndangerous; that they only increase the panmixia, to the great\r\ndetriment of the species and of society.\r\n\r\nAmong the aristocratic theories which Darwinism has thus inspired we\r\nmust reckon that of Nietzsche. It is well known that in order to\r\ncomplete his philosophy he added biological studies to his\r\nphilological; and more than once in his remarks upon the _Wille zur\r\nMacht_ he definitely alludes to Darwin; though it must be confessed\r\nthat it is generally in order to proclaim the insufficiency of the\r\nprocesses by which Darwin seeks to explain the genesis of species.\r\nNevertheless, Nietzsche's mind is completely possessed by an ideal of\r\nSelection. He, too, has a horror of panmixia. The naturalists'\r\nconception of \"the fittest\" is joined by him to that of the \"hero\" of\r\nromance to furnish a basis for his doctrine of the Superman. Let us\r\nhasten to add, moreover, that at the very moment when support was\r\nbeing sought in the theory of Selection for the various forms of the\r\naristocratic doctrine, those same forms were being battered down on\r\nanother side by means of that very theory. Attention was drawn to the\r\nfact that by virtue of the laws which Darwin himself had discovered\r\nisolation leads to etiolation. There is a risk that the privilege\r\nwhich withdraws the privileged elements of Society from competition\r\nwill cause them to degenerate. In fact, Jacoby in his _Studies in\r\nSelection, in connexion with Heredity in Man_,[252] concludes that\r\n\"sterility, mental debility, premature death and, finally, the\r\nextinction of the stock were not specially and exclusively the fate of\r\nsovereign dynasties; all privileged classes, all families in\r\nexclusively elevated positions share the fate of reigning families,\r\nalthough in a minor degree and in direct proportion to the loftiness\r\nof their social standing. From the mass of human beings spring\r\nindividuals, families, races, which tend to raise themselves above the\r\ncommon level; painfully they climb the rugged heights, attain the\r\nsummits of power, of wealth, of intelligence, of talent, and then, no\r\nsooner are they there than they topple down and disappear in gulfs of\r\nmental and physical degeneracy.\" The demographical researches of\r\nHansen[253] (following up and completing Dumont's) tended, indeed, to\r\nshow that urban as well as feudal aristocracies, burgher classes as\r\nwell as noble castes, were liable to become effete. Hence it might\r\nwell be concluded that the democratic movement, operating as it does\r\nto break down class barriers, was promoting instead of impeding human\r\nselection.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo we see that, according to the point of view, very different\r\nconclusions have been drawn from the application of the Darwinian idea\r\nof Selection to human society. Darwin's other central idea, closely\r\nbound up with this, that, namely, of the \"struggle for existence\" also\r\nhas been diversely utilised. But discussion has chiefly centered upon\r\nits signification. And while some endeavour to extend its application\r\nto everything, we find others trying to limit its range. The\r\nconception of a \"struggle for existence\" has in the present day been\r\ntaken up into the social sciences from natural science, and adopted.\r\nBut originally it descended from social science to natural. Darwin's\r\nlaw is, as he himself said, only Malthus' law generalised and extended\r\nto the animal world: a growing disproportion between the supply of\r\nfood and the number of the living is the fatal order whence arises the\r\nnecessity of universal struggle, a struggle which, to the great\r\nadvantage of the species, allows only the best equipped individuals to\r\nsurvive. Nature is regarded by Huxley as an immense arena where all\r\nliving beings are gladiators.[254]\r\n\r\nSuch a generalisation was well adapted to feed the stream of\r\npessimistic thought; and it furnished to the apologists of war, in\r\nparticular, new arguments, weighted with all the authority which in\r\nthese days attaches to scientific deliverances. If people no longer\r\nsay, as Bonald did, and Moltke after him, that war is a providential\r\nfact, they yet lay stress on the point that it is a natural fact. To\r\nthe peace party Dragomirov's objection is urged that its attempts are\r\ncontrary to the fundamental laws of nature, and that no sea wall can\r\nhold against breakers that come with such gathered force.\r\n\r\nBut in yet another quarter Darwinism was represented as opposed to\r\nphilanthropic intervention. The defenders of the orthodox political\r\neconomy found in it support for their tenets. Since in the organic\r\nworld universal struggle is the condition of progress, it seemed\r\nobvious that free competition must be allowed to reign unchecked in\r\nthe economic world. Attempts to curb it were in the highest degree\r\nimprudent. The spirit of Liberalism here seemed in conformity with the\r\ntrend of nature: in this respect, at least, contemporary naturalism,\r\noffspring of the discoveries of the nineteenth century, brought\r\nreinforcements to the individualist doctrine, begotten of the\r\nspeculations of the eighteenth: but only, it appeared, to turn mankind\r\naway for ever from humanitarian dreams. Would those whom such\r\nconclusions repelled be content to oppose to nature's imperatives\r\nonly the protests of the heart? There were some who declared, like\r\nBrunetière, that the laws in question, valid though they might be for\r\nthe animal kingdom, were not applicable to the human. And so a return\r\nwas made to the classic dualism. This indeed seems to be the line that\r\nHuxley took, when, for instance, he opposed to the cosmic process an\r\nethical process which was its reverse.\r\n\r\nBut the number of thinkers whom this antithesis does not satisfy grows\r\ndaily. Although the pessimism which claims authorisation from Darwin's\r\ndoctrines is repugnant to them, they still are unable to accept the\r\ndualism which leaves a gulf between man and nature. And their\r\nendeavour is to link the two by showing that while Darwin's laws\r\nobtain in both kingdoms, the conditions of their application are not\r\nthe same: their forms, and, consequently, their results, vary with the\r\nvarying mediums in which the struggle of living beings takes place,\r\nwith the means these beings have at disposal, with the ends even which\r\nthey propose to themselves.\r\n\r\nHere we have the explanation of the fact that among determined\r\nopponents of war partisans of the \"struggle for existence\" can be\r\nfound: there are disciples of Darwin in the peace party. Novicow, for\r\nexample, admits the \"_combat universel_\" of which Le Dantec[255]\r\nspeaks; but he remarks that at different stages of evolution, at\r\ndifferent stages of life the same weapons are not necessarily\r\nemployed. Struggles of brute force, armed hand to hand conflicts, may\r\nhave been a necessity in the early phases of human societies.\r\nNowadays, although competition may remain inevitable and\r\nindispensable, it can assume milder forms. Economic rivalries,\r\nstruggles between intellectual influences, suffice to stimulate\r\nprogress: the processes which these admit are, in the actual state of\r\ncivilisation, the only ones which attain their end without waste, the\r\nonly ones logical. From one end to the other of the ladder of life,\r\nstruggle is the order of the day; but more and more as the higher\r\nrungs are reached, it takes on characters which are proportionately\r\nmore \"humane.\"\r\n\r\nReflections of this kind permit the introduction into the economic\r\norder of limitations to the doctrine of \"laisser faire, laisser\r\npasser.\" This appeals, it is said, to the example of nature where\r\ncreatures, left to themselves, struggle without truce and without\r\nmercy; but the fact is forgotten that upon industrial battlefields the\r\nconditions are different. The competitors here are not left simply to\r\ntheir natural energies: they are variously handicapped. A rich store\r\nof artificial resources exists in which some participate and others do\r\nnot. The sides then are unequal; and as a consequence the result of\r\nthe struggle is falsified. \"In the animal world,\" said De\r\nLaveleye,[256] criticising Spencer, \"the fate of each creature is\r\ndetermined by its individual qualities; whereas in civilised societies\r\na man may obtain the highest position and the most beautiful wife\r\nbecause he is rich and well-born, although he may be ugly, idle or\r\nimprovident; and then it is he who will perpetuate the species. The\r\nwealthy man, ill constituted, incapable, sickly, enjoys his riches and\r\nestablishes his stock under the protection of the laws.\" Haycraft in\r\nEngland and Jentsch in Germany have strongly emphasised these\r\n\"anomalies,\" which nevertheless are the rule. That is to say that even\r\nfrom a Darwinian point of view all social reforms can readily be\r\njustified which aim at diminishing, as Wallace said, inequalities at\r\nthe start.\r\n\r\nBut we can go further still. Whence comes the idea that all measures\r\ninspired by the sentiment of solidarity are contrary to Nature's\r\ntrend? Observe her carefully, and she will not give lessons only in\r\nindividualism. Side by side with the struggle for existence do we not\r\nfind in operation what Lanessan calls \"association for existence.\"\r\nLong ago, Espinas had drawn attention to \"societies of animals,\"\r\ntemporary or permanent, and to the kind of morality that arose in\r\nthem. Since then, naturalists have often insisted upon the importance\r\nof various forms of symbiosis. Kropotkin in _Mutual Aid_ has chosen\r\nto enumerate many examples of altruism furnished by animals to\r\nmankind. Geddes and Thomson went so far as to maintain that \"Each of\r\nthe greater steps of progress is in fact associated with an increased\r\nmeasure of subordination of individual competition to reproductive or\r\nsocial ends, and of interspecific competition to co-operative,\r\nassociation.\"[257] Experience shows, according to Geddes, that the\r\ntypes which are fittest to surmount great obstacles are not so much\r\nthose who engage in the fiercest competitive struggle for existence,\r\nas those who contrive to temper it. From all these observations there\r\nresulted, along with a limitation of Darwinian pessimism, some\r\nencouragement for the aspirations of the collectivists.\r\n\r\nAnd Darwin himself would, doubtless, have subscribed to these\r\nrectifications. He never insisted, like his rival, Wallace, upon the\r\nnecessity of the solitary struggle of creatures in a state of nature,\r\neach for himself and against all. On the contrary, in _The Descent of\r\nMan_, he pointed out the serviceableness of the social instincts, and\r\ncorroborated Bagehot's statements when the latter, applying laws of\r\nphysics to politics, showed the great advantage societies derived from\r\nintercourse and communion. Again, the theory of sexual evolution which\r\nmakes the evolution of types depend increasingly upon preferences,\r\njudgments, mental factors, surely offers something to qualify what\r\nseems hard and brutal in the theory of natural selection.\r\n\r\nBut, as often happens with disciples, the Darwinians had out-Darwined\r\nDarwin. The extravagances of social Darwinism provoked a useful\r\nreaction; and thus people were led to seek, even in the animal\r\nkingdom, for facts of solidarity which would serve to justify humane\r\neffort.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn quite another line, however, an attempt has been made to connect\r\nsocialist tendencies with Darwinian principles. Marx and Darwin have\r\nbeen confronted; and writers have undertaken to show that the work of\r\nthe German philosopher fell readily into line with that of the English\r\nnaturalist and was a development of it. Such has been the endeavour of\r\nFerri in Italy and of Woltmann in Germany, not to mention others. The\r\nfounders of \"scientific socialism\" had, moreover, themselves thought\r\nof this reconciliation. They make more than one allusion to Darwin in\r\nworks which appeared after 1859. And sometimes they use his theory to\r\ndefine by contrast their own ideal. They remark that the capitalist\r\nsystem, by giving free course to individual competition, ends indeed\r\nin a _bellum omnium contra omnes_; and they make it clear that\r\nDarwinism, thus understood, is as repugnant to them as to Dühring.\r\n\r\nBut it is at the scientific and not at the moral point of view that\r\nthey place themselves when they connect their economic history with\r\nDarwin's work. Thanks to this unifying hypothesis, they claim to have\r\nconstructed--as Marx does in his preface to _Das Kapital_--a veritable\r\nnatural history of social evolution. Engels speaks in praise of his\r\nfriend Marx as having discovered the true mainspring of history hidden\r\nunder the veil of idealism and sentimentalism, and as having\r\nproclaimed in the _primum vivere_ the inevitableness of the struggle\r\nfor existence. Marx himself, in _Das Kapital_, indicated another\r\nanalogy when he dwelt upon the importance of a general technology for\r\nthe explanation of this psychology:--a history of tools which would be\r\nto social organs what Darwinism is to the organs of animal species.\r\nAnd the very importance they attach to tools, to apparatus, to\r\nmachines, abundantly proves that neither Marx nor Engels were likely\r\nto forget the special characters which mark off the human world from\r\nthe animal. The former always remains to a great extent an artificial\r\nworld. Inventions change the face of its institutions. New modes of\r\nproduction revolutionise not only modes of government, but modes even\r\nof collective thought. Therefore it is that the evolution of society\r\nis controlled by laws special to it, of which the spectacle of nature\r\noffers no suggestion.\r\n\r\nIf, however, even in this special sphere, it can still be urged that\r\nthe evolution of the material conditions of society is in accord with\r\nDarwin's theory, it is because the influence of the methods of\r\nproduction is itself to be explained by the incessant strife of the\r\nvarious classes with each other. So that in the end Marx, like Darwin,\r\nfinds the source of all progress is in struggle. Both are grandsons of\r\nHeraclitus:--[Greek: polemos patêr pantôn]. It sometimes happens, in\r\nthese days, that the doctrine of revolutionary socialism is contrasted\r\nas rude and healthy with what may seem to be the enervating tendency\r\nof \"solidarist\" philanthropy: the apologists of the doctrine then\r\npride themselves above all upon their faithfulness to Darwinian\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSo far we have been mainly concerned to show the use that social\r\nphilosophies have made of the Darwinian laws for practical purposes:\r\nin order to orientate society towards their ideals each school tries\r\nto show that the authority of natural science is on its side. But even\r\nin the most objective of theories, those which systematically make\r\nabstraction of all political tendencies in order to study the social\r\nreality in itself, traces of Darwinism are readily to be found.\r\n\r\nLet us take for example Durkheim's theory of Division of Labour.[258]\r\nThe conclusions he derives from it are that whenever professional\r\nspecialisation causes multiplication of distinct branches of activity,\r\nwe get organic solidarity--implying differences--substituted for\r\nmechanical solidarity, based upon likenesses. The umbilical cord, as\r\nMarx said, which connects the individual consciousness with the\r\ncollective consciousness is cut. The personality becomes more and more\r\nemancipated. But on what does this phenomenon, so big with\r\nconsequences, itself depend? The author goes to social morphology for\r\nthe answer: it is, he says, the growing density of population which\r\nbrings with it this increasing differentiation of activities. But,\r\nagain, why? Because the greater density, in thrusting men up against\r\neach other, augments the intensity of their competition for the means\r\nof existence; and for the problems which society thus has to face\r\ndifferentiation of functions presents itself as the gentlest solution.\r\n\r\nHere one sees that the writer borrows directly from Darwin.\r\nCompetition is at its maximum between similars, Darwin had declared;\r\ndifferent species, not laying claim to the same food, could more\r\neasily coexist. Here lay the explanation of the fact that upon the\r\nsame oak hundreds of different insects might be found. Other things\r\nbeing equal, the same applies to society. He who finds some unadopted\r\nspecialty possesses a means of his own for getting a living. It is by\r\nthis division of their manifold tasks that men contrive not to crush\r\neach other. Here we obviously have a Darwinian law serving as\r\nintermediary in the explanation of that progress of division of labour\r\nwhich itself explains so much in the social evolution.\r\n\r\nAnd we might take another example, at the other end of the series of\r\nsociological systems. G. Tarde is a sociologist with the most\r\npronounced anti-naturalistic views. He has attempted to show that all\r\napplication of the laws of natural science to society is misleading.\r\nIn his _Opposition Universelle_ he has directly combatted all forms of\r\nsociological Darwinism. According to him the idea that the evolution\r\nof society can be traced on the same plan as the evolution of species\r\nis chimerical. Social evolution is at the mercy of all kinds of\r\ninventions, which by virtue of the laws of imitation modify, through\r\nindividual to individual, through neighbourhood to neighbourhood, the\r\ngeneral state of those beliefs and desires which are the only\r\n\"quantities\" whose variation matters to the sociologist. But, it may\r\nbe rejoined, that however psychical the forces may be, they are none\r\nthe less subject to Darwinian laws. They compete with each other; they\r\nstruggle for the mastery of minds. Between types of ideas, as between\r\norganic forms, selection operates. And though it may be that these\r\ntypes are ushered into the arena by unexpected discoveries, we yet\r\nrecognise in the psychological accidents, which Tarde places at the\r\nbase of everything, near relatives of those small accidental\r\nvariations upon which Darwin builds. Thus, accepting Tarde's own\r\nrepresentations, it is quite possible to express in Darwinian terms,\r\nwith the necessary transpositions, one of the most idealistic\r\nsociologies that have ever been constructed.\r\n\r\nThese few examples suffice. They enable us to estimate the extent of\r\nthe field of influence of Darwinism. It affects sociology not only\r\nthrough the agency of its advocates but through that of its opponents.\r\nThe questions to which it has given rise have proved no less fruitful\r\nthan the solutions it has suggested. In short, few doctrines, in the\r\nhistory of social philosophy, will have produced on their passage a\r\nfiner crop of ideas.\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[Footnote 246: P.
