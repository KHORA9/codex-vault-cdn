Macmillan, informed me that\r\nthe demand for it just, but only just warranted a revised issue. I\r\nshrank from the great trouble of bringing it up to date because it,\r\nor rather many of my memoirs out of which it was built up, had\r\nbecome starting-points for elaborate investigations both in England\r\nand in America, to which it would be difficult and very laborious to\r\ndo justice in a brief compass. So the question of a Second Edition\r\nwas then entirely dropped. Since that time the book has by no means\r\nceased to live, for it continues to be quoted from and sought for,\r\nbut is obtainable only with difficulty, and at much more than its\r\noriginal cost, at sales of second-hand books. Moreover, it became\r\nthe starting point of that recent movement in favour of National\r\nEugenics (see note p. 24 in first edition) which is recognised by\r\nthe University of London, and has its home in University College.\r\n\r\nHaving received a proposal to republish the book in its present\r\nconvenient and inexpensive form, I gladly accepted it, having first\r\nsought and received an obliging assurance from Messrs. Macmillan\r\nthat they would waive all their claims to the contrary in my favour.\r\n\r\nThe following small changes are made in this edition. The\r\nillustrations are for the most part reduced in size to suit the\r\nsmaller form of the volume, the lettering of the composites is\r\nrearranged, and the coloured illustration is reproduced as closely\r\nas circumstances permit. Two chapters are omitted, on \"Theocratic\r\nIntervention\" and on the \"Objective Efficacy of Prayer.\" The earlier\r\npart of the latter was too much abbreviated from the original memoir\r\nin the _Fortnightly Review_, 1872, and gives, as I now perceive, a\r\nsomewhat inexact impression of its object, which was to investigate\r\ncertain views then thought orthodox, but which are growing obsolete.\r\nI could not reinsert these omissions now with advantage, unless\r\nconsiderable additions were made to the references, thus giving more\r\nappearance of personal controversy to the memoirs than is desirable.\r\nAfter all, the omission of these two chapters, in which I find\r\nnothing to recant, improves, as I am told, the general balance of the\r\nbook.

advantage\r\n  of variety; some peculiarities are, however, harmful.\r\n\r\nFEATURES\r\n\r\n  Large number of elements in the human expression; of\r\n  touches in a portrait; difficulty of measuring the separate\r\n  features; or of selecting typical individuals; the typical\r\n  English face; its change at different historical periods;\r\n  colour of hair of modern English; caricatures.\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITE PORTRAITURE\r\n\r\n  (See Appendix for three Memoirs describing successive\r\n  stages of the method).--Object and principle of the process;\r\n  description of the plate--composites of medals; of family\r\n  portraits; of the two sexes and of various ages; of Royal\r\n  Engineers; the latter gives a clue to one direction in which\r\n  the English race might be improved; of criminals; of the\r\n  consumptive; ethnological application of the process.\r\n\r\nBODILY QUALITIES\r\n\r\n  Anthropometric Committee; statistical anomalies in stature\r\n  as dependent on age; town and rural population; athletic\r\n  feats now and formerly; increase of stature of middle classes;\r\n  large number of weakly persons; some appearances of weakness\r\n  may be fallacious; a barrel and a wheel; definition\r\n  of word \"eugenic.\"\r\n\r\nENERGY\r\n\r\n  It is the attribute of high races; useful stimuli to activity;\r\n  fleas, etc.; the preservation of the weakly as exercises for\r\n  pity; that of foxes for sport.\r\n\r\nSENSITIVITY\r\n\r\n  Sensation and pain; range and grades of sensation;\r\n  idiots; men and women; the blind; reading by touch;\r\n  sailors; paucity of words to express gradation.\r\n\r\nSEQUENCE OF TEST WEIGHTS\r\n\r\n  (See also Appendix, p. 248).--Geometric series of\r\n  weights; method of using them; the same principle is\r\n  applicable to other senses; the tests only measure the state\r\n  of faculties at time of trial; cautions in constructing the\r\n  test weights; multiplicity of the usual perceptions.\r\n\r\nWHISTLES FOR AUDIBILITY OF SHRILL NOTES\r\n\r\n  (See also Appendix, p. 252).--Construction of them; loss\r\n  of power of hearing high notes as age advances; trials upon\r\n  animals; sensitivity of cats to high notes; of small dogs and\r\n  ponies.\r\n\r\nANTHROPOMETRIC REGISTERS\r\n\r\n  Want of anthropometric laboratories; of family records;\r\n  opportunities in schools; Admiralty records of life of each\r\n  seaman; family registers (see also 220); autotypes; medical\r\n  value of ancestral life-histories (see also 220); of their\r\n  importance to human eugenics.\r\n\r\nUNCONSCIOUSNESS OF PECULIARITIES\r\n\r\n  Colour blindness usually unsuspected; unconsciousness of\r\n  high intellectual gifts; of peculiarities of mental imagery;\r\n  heredity of colour blindness in Quakers; Young and Dalton.\r\n\r\nSTATISTICAL METHODS\r\n\r\n  Objects of statistical science; constancy and continuity\r\n  of statistical results; groups and sub-groups; augival or\r\n  ogival curves; wide application of the ogival; method;\r\n  example; first method of comparing two ogival groups;\r\n  centesimal grades; example; second method of comparing\r\n  ogival groups; statistical records easily made with a\r\n  pricker.\r\n\r\nCHARACTER\r\n\r\n  Caprice and coyness of females; its cause; observations\r\n  of character at schools; varieties of likings and antipathies;\r\n  horror of snakes is by no means universal; the horror of\r\n  blood among cattle is variable.\r\n\r\nCRIMINALS AND THE INSANE\r\n\r\n  Peculiarities of criminal character; some of them are\r\n  normal and not morbid; their inheritance as in the Jukes\r\n  family; epileptics and their nervous instability; insanity;\r\n  religious rapture; strange views of the insane on individuality;\r\n  their moody segregation; the religious discipline of\r\n  celibacy, fasting and solitude (see also 125); large field of\r\n  study among the insane and idiotic.\r\n\r\nGREGARIOUS AND SLAVISH INSTINCTS\r\n\r\n  Most men shrink from responsibility; study of gregarious\r\n  animals: especially of the cattle of the Damaras; fore-oxen\r\n  to waggon teams; conditions of safety of herds; cow and\r\n  young calf when approached by lions; the most effective\r\n  size of herd; corresponding production of leaders; similarly\r\n  as regards barbarian tribes and their leaders; power of\r\n  tyranny vested in chiefs; political and religious persecutions;\r\n  hence human servility; but society may flourish without\r\n  servility; its corporate actions would then have statistical\r\n  constancy; nations who are guided by successive orators,\r\n  etc., must be inconstant; the romantic side of servility; free\r\n  political life.\r\n\r\nINTELLECTUAL DIFFERENCES\r\n\r\n  Reference to _Hereditary Genius_.\r\n\r\nMENTAL IMAGERY\r\n\r\n  Purport of inquiry; circular of questions (see Appendix\r\n  for this); the first answers were from scientific men,\r\n  and were negative; those from persons in general society\r\n  were quite the reverse; sources of my materials; they are\r\n  mutually corroborative. Analysis of returns from 100\r\n  persons mostly of some eminence; extracts from replies of\r\n  those in whom the visualising faculty is highest; those in\r\n  whom it is mediocre; lowest; conformity between these\r\n  and other sets of haphazard returns; octile, median, etc.,\r\n  values; visualisation of colour; some liability to exaggeration;\r\n  blindfold chess-players; remarkable instances of visualisation;\r\n  the faculty is not necessarily connected with keen sight or\r\n  tendency to dream; comprehensive imagery; the faculty in different\r\n  sexes and ages; is strongly hereditary; seems notable among\r\n  the French; Bushmen; Eskimo; prehistoric men; admits of being\r\n  educated; imagery usually fails in flexibility; special and generic\r\n  images (see also Appendix); use of the faculty.\r\n\r\nNUMBER-FORMS\r\n\r\n  General account of the peculiarity; mutually corroborative\r\n  statements; personal evidence given at the Anthropological\r\n  Institute; specimens of a few descriptions and\r\n  illustrative woodcuts; great variety in the Forms; their\r\n  early origin; directions in which they run; bold conceptions\r\n  of children concerning height and depth; historical\r\n  dates, months, etc.; alphabet; derivation of the Forms\r\n  from the spoken names of numerals; fixity of the Form\r\n  compared to that of the handwriting; of animals working\r\n  in constant patterns; of track of eye when searching for\r\n  lost objects; occasional origin from figures on clock; from\r\n  various other sources; the non-decimal nomenclature of\r\n  numerals; perplexity caused by it. Description of figures\r\n  in Plate I.; Plate II.; Plate III.; Plate IV. Colours\r\n  assigned to numerals (see 105); personal characters; sex;\r\n  frequency with which the various numerals are used in the\r\n  Talmud.\r\n\r\nCOLOUR ASSOCIATIONS\r\n\r\n  (Description of Plate IV. continued) Associations with\r\n  numerals; with words and letters; illustrations by Dr. J.\r\n  Key; the scheme of one seer unintelligible to other seers;\r\n  mental music, etc.\r\n\r\nVISIONARIES\r\n\r\n  Sane persons often see visions; the simpler kinds of\r\n  visions; unconsciousness of seers, at first, of their\r\n  peculiarity; subsequent dislike to speak about it; imagery\r\n  connected with words; that of Mrs. Haweis; automatic changes\r\n  in dark field of eye; my own experiences; those of Rev. G. Henslow;\r\n  visions frequently unlike vivid visualisations; phantasmagoria;\r\n  hallucinations; simile of a seal in a pond; dreams and partial\r\n  sensitiveness of brain; hallucinations and illusions, their causes;\r\n  \"faces in the fire,\" etc.; sub-conscious picture-drawing; visions\r\n  based on patched recollections; on blended recollections; hereditary\r\n  seership; visions caused by fasting, etc.; by spiritual discipline\r\n  (see also 47); star of Napoleon I.; hallucinations of\r\n  great men; seers commoner at some periods than at others;\r\n  reasons why.\r\n\r\nNURTURE AND NATURE\r\n\r\n  Their effects are difficult to separate; the same character\r\n  has many phases; Renaissance; changes owing merely to\r\n  love of change; feminine fashions; periodical sequences of\r\n  changed character in birds; the interaction of nurture and\r\n  nature.\r\n\r\nASSOCIATIONS\r\n\r\n  Derived from experience; especially from childish recollections\r\n  (see 141); abstract ideas; cumulative ideas, like composite\r\n  portraits (see also Appendix, \"Generic Images,\"  p. 229);\r\n  their resemblance even in details.\r\n\r\nPSYCHOMETRIC EXPERIMENTS\r\n\r\n  Difficulty of watching the mind in operation; how it may\r\n  be overcome; irksomeness of the process; tentative experiments;\r\n  method used subsequently; the number of recurrent\r\n  associations; memory; ages at which associations are\r\n  formed; similarity of the associations in persons of the same\r\n  country and class of society; different descriptions of\r\n       associations,\r\n  classified; their relative frequency; abstract ideas are\r\n  slowly formed; multifariousness of sub-conscious operations.\r\n\r\nANTECHAMBER OF CONSCIOUSNESS\r\n\r\n  Act of thinking analysed; automatic mental work; fluency\r\n  of words and of imagery; processes of literary composition;\r\n  fluency of spiritual ideas; visionary races of men; morbid\r\n  ideas of inspiration (see Enthusiasm).\r\n\r\nEARLY SENTIMENTS\r\n\r\n  Accidents of education, religion, country, etc.; deaf-mutes\r\n  and religious ritual; religion in its essentials; all religious\r\n  teachers preach faith and instil prejudices; origin of the\r\n  faculty of conscience; evolution is always behindhand;\r\n  good men of various faiths; the fear of death; terror is\r\n  easily taught; gregarious animals (see also 47); suspiciousness\r\n  in the children of criminals; Dante and contemporary\r\n  artists on the terrors of hell; aversion is easily taught,\r\n  Eastern ideas of clean and unclean acts; the foregoing\r\n  influences affect entire classes.\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF TWINS\r\n\r\n  It supplies means of comparing the effects of nurture and\r\n  nature; physiological signification of twinship; replies to\r\n  a circular of inquiries; eighty cases of close resemblance\r\n  between twins; the points in which their resemblance was\r\n  closest; extracts from the replies; interchangeableness of\r\n  likeness; cases of similar forms of insanity in both twins;\r\n  their tastes and dispositions; causes of growing dissimilarity\r\n  mainly referred to illness; partly to gradual development of\r\n  latent elements of dissimilarity; effect of childish illnesses\r\n  in permanently checking growth of head; parallel lives and\r\n  deaths among twins; necessitarianism; twenty cases of great\r\n  dissimilarity; extracts from the replies; evidence of slight\r\n  exaggeration; education is almost powerless to diminish\r\n  natural difference of character; simile of sticks floating\r\n  down a brook; depth of impressions made in childhood;\r\n  they are partly due to the ease with which parents and\r\n  children understand one another; cuckoos forget the teachings\r\n  of their foster-mothers.\r\n\r\nDOMESTICATION OF ANIMALS\r\n\r\n  Alternative hypotheses of the prehistoric process of\r\n  domestication; savages rear captive animals; instances in\r\n  North America; South America; North Africa; Equatorial\r\n  Africa; South Africa; Australia; New Guinea Group;\r\n  Polynesia; ancient Syria. Sacred animals; menageries\r\n  and shows in amphitheatres; instances in ancient Egypt;\r\n  Assyria; Rome; Mexico; Peru; Syria and Greece.\r\n  Domestication is only possible when the species has certain\r\n  natural faculties, viz.--great hardiness; fondness for man;\r\n  desire of comfort; usefulness to man; fertility; being easy\r\n  to tend. Habitual selection of the tamest to breed from.\r\n  Exceptions; summary.\r\n\r\nTHE OBSERVED ORDER OF EVENTS\r\n\r\n  Steady improvement in the birthright of successive generations;\r\n  our ignorance of the origin and purport of all existence;\r\n  of the outcome of life on this earth; of the conditions\r\n  of consciousness; slow progress of evolution and its\r\n  system of ruthless routine; man is the heir of long bygone\r\n  ages; has great power in expediting the course of evolution;\r\n  he might render its progress less slow and painful;\r\n  does not yet understand that it may be his part to do so.\r\n\r\nSELECTION AND RACE\r\n\r\n  Difference between the best specimens of a poor race and\r\n  the mediocre ones of a high race; typical centres to which\r\n  races tend to revert; delicacy of highly-bred animals; their\r\n  diminished fertility; the misery of rigorous selection; it is\r\n  preferable to replace poor races by better ones; strains of\r\n  emigrant blood; of exiles.\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF MAN UPON RACE\r\n\r\n  Conquest, migrations, etc.; sentiment against extinguishing\r\n  races; is partly unreasonable; the so-called \"aborigines\";\r\n  on the variety and number of different races\r\n  inhabiting the same country; as in Spain; history of the\r\n  Moors; Gypsies; the races in Damara Land; their recent\r\n  changes; races in Siberia; Africa; America; West Indies;\r\n  Australia and New Zealand; wide diffusion of Arabs and\r\n  Chinese; power of man to shape future humanity.\r\n\r\nPOPULATION\r\n\r\n  Over-population; Malthus--the danger of applying his\r\n  prudential check; his originality; his phrase of misery check\r\n  is in many cases too severe; decaying races and the cause\r\n  of decay.\r\n\r\nEARLY AND LATE MARRIAGES\r\n\r\n  Estimate of their relative effects on a population in a few\r\n  generations; example.\r\n\r\nMARKS FOR FAMILY MERIT\r\n\r\n  On the demand for definite proposals how to improve\r\n  race; the demand is not quite fair, and the reasons why;\r\n  nevertheless attempt is made to suggest the outline of one;\r\n  on the signs of superior race; importance of giving weight\r\n  to them when making selections from candidates who are\r\n  personally equal; on families that have thriven; that are\r\n  healthy and long-lived; present rarity of our knowledge\r\n  concerning family antecedents; Mr. F.M. Hollond on the\r\n  superior morality of members of large families; Sir William\r\n  Gull on their superior vigour; claim for importance of\r\n  further inquiries into the family antecedents of those who\r\n  succeed in after life; probable large effect of any system\r\n  by which marks might be conferred on the ground of family\r\n  merit.\r\n\r\nENDOWMENTS\r\n\r\n  These have frequently been made in order to furnish\r\n  marriage portions; they, as well as the adoption of gifted\r\n  children of gifted families, may hereafter become common;\r\n  college statutes enjoining celibacy on Fellows; reverse effect\r\n  to that for which prizes at races were established; the recent\r\n  reform of those statutes and numerous marriages in consequence;\r\n  the English race has yet to be explored for its\r\n  natural wealth; those who are naturally gifted would be\r\n  disinclined to squander their patrimony; social consideration;\r\n  honest pride in goodness of race.\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION\r\n\r\n  Epitome of data; the apparent place of man in nature;\r\n  he should look upon himself as a freeman; he should assist\r\n  in furthering evolution; his present ability to do so; the\r\n  certainty that his ability of doing so will increase; importance\r\n  of life-histories; brief summary.\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nA.

They\r\nmay have appeared desultory when read in the order in which they\r\nappeared, but as they had an underlying connection it seems worth\r\nwhile to bring their substance together in logical sequence into a\r\nsingle volume. I have revised, condensed, largely re-written,\r\ntransposed old matter, and interpolated much that is new; but traces\r\nof the fragmentary origin of the work still remain, and I do not\r\nregret them. They serve to show that the book is intended to be\r\nsuggestive, and renounces all claim to be encyclopedic. I have indeed,\r\nwith that object, avoided going into details in not a few cases\r\nwhere I should otherwise have written with fulness, especially in\r\nthe Anthropometric part. My general object has been to take note of\r\nthe varied hereditary faculties of different men, and of the great\r\ndifferences in different families and races, to learn how far\r\nhistory may have shown the practicability of supplanting inefficient\r\nhuman stock by better strains, and to consider whether it might not\r\nbe our duty to do so by such efforts as may be reasonable, thus\r\nexerting ourselves to further the ends of evolution more rapidly and\r\nwith less distress than if events were left to their own course. The\r\nsubject is, however, so entangled with collateral considerations\r\nthat a straightforward step-by-step inquiry did not seem to be the\r\nmost suitable course. I thought it safer to proceed like the\r\nsurveyor of a new country, and endeavour to fix in the first\r\ninstance as truly as I could the position of several cardinal points.\r\nThe general outline of the results to which I finally arrived became\r\nmore coherent and clear as this process went on; they are brieflv\r\nsummarised in the concluding chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVARIETY OF HUMAN NATURE.\r\n\r\nWe must free our minds of a great deal of prejudice before we can\r\nrightly judge of the direction in which different races need to be\r\nimproved. We must be on our guard against taking our own instincts\r\nof what is best and most seemly, as a criterion for the rest of\r\nmankind. The instincts and faculties of different men and races\r\ndiffer in a variety of ways almost as profoundly as those of animals\r\nin different cages of the Zoological Gardens; and however diverse and\r\nantagonistic they are, each may be good of its kind. It is obviously\r\nso in brutes; the monkey may have a horror at the sight of a snake,\r\nand a repugnance to its ways, but a snake is just as perfect an\r\nanimal as a monkey. The living world does not consist of a\r\nrepetition of similar elements, but of an endless variety of them,\r\nthat have grown, body and soul, through selective influences into\r\nclose adaptation to their contemporaries, and to the physical\r\ncircumstances of the localities they inhabit. The moral and\r\nintellectual wealth of a nation largely consists in the multifarious\r\nvariety of the gifts of the men who compose it, and it would be the\r\nvery reverse of improvement to make all its members assimilate to a\r\ncommon type. However, in every race of domesticated animals, and\r\nespecially in the rapidly-changing race of man, there are elements,\r\nsome ancestral and others the result of degeneration, that are of\r\nlittle or no value, or are positively harmful. We may, of course, be\r\nmistaken about some few of these, and shall find in our fuller\r\nknowledge that they subserve the public good in some indirect manner;\r\nbut, notwithstanding this possibility, we are justified in roundly\r\nasserting that the natural characteristics of every human race admit\r\nof large improvement in many directions easy to specify.\r\n\r\nI do not, however, offer a list of these, but shall confine myself\r\nto directing attention to a very few hereditary characteristics of a\r\nmarked kind, some of which are most desirable and others greatly the\r\nreverse; I shall also describe new methods of appraising and\r\ndefining them. Later on in the book I shall endeavour to define the\r\nplace and duty of man in the furtherance of the great scheme of\r\nevolution, and I shall show that he has already not only adapted\r\ncircumstance to race, but also, in some degree and often\r\nunconsciously, race to circumstance; and that his unused powers in\r\nthe latter direction are more considerable than might have been\r\nthought.\r\n\r\nIt is with the innate moral and intellectual faculties that the book\r\nis chiefly concerned, but they are so closely bound up with the\r\nphysical ones that these must be considered as well. It is, moreover,\r\nconvenient to take them the first, so I will begin with the features.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFEATURES.\r\n\r\nThe differences in human features must be reckoned great, inasmuch\r\nas they enable us to distinguish a single known face among those of\r\nthousands of strangers, though they are mostly too minute for\r\nmeasurement. At the same time, they are exceedingly numerous. The\r\ngeneral expression of a face is the sum of a multitude of small\r\ndetails, which are viewed in such rapid succession that we seem to\r\nperceive them all at a single glance. If any one of them disagrees\r\nwith the recollected traits of a known face, the eye is quick at\r\nobserving it, and it dwells upon the difference. One small\r\ndiscordance overweighs a multitude of similarities and suggests a\r\ngeneral unlikeness; just as a single syllable in a sentence\r\npronounced with a foreign accent makes one cease to look upon the\r\nspeaker as a countryman. If the first rough sketch of a portrait be\r\ncorrect so far as it goes, it may be pronounced an excellent likeness;\r\nbut a rough sketch does not go far; it contains but few traits for\r\ncomparison with the original. It is a suggestion, not a likeness; it\r\nmust be coloured and shaded with many touches before it can really\r\nresemble the face, and whilst this is being done the maintenance of\r\nthe likeness is imperilled at every step. I lately watched an able\r\nartist painting a portrait, and endeavoured to estimate the number\r\nof strokes with his brush, every one of which was thoughtfully and\r\nfirmly given. During fifteen sittings of three working hours\r\neach--that is to say, during forty-five hours, or two thousand four\r\nhundred minutes--he worked at the average rate of ten strokes of the\r\nbrush per minute. There were, therefore, twenty-four thousand\r\nseparate traits in the completed portrait, and in his opinion some,\r\nI do not say equal, but comparably large number of units of\r\nresemblance with the original.\r\n\r\nThe physiognomical difference between different men being so\r\nnumerous and small, it is impossible to measure and compare them\r\neach to each, and to discover by ordinary statistical methods the\r\ntrue physiognomy of a race. The usual way is to select individuals\r\nwho are judged to be representatives of the prevalent type, and to\r\nphotograph them; but this method is not trustworthy, because the\r\njudgment itself is fallacious. It is swayed by exceptional and\r\ngrotesque features more than by ordinary ones, and the portraits\r\nsupposed to be typical are likely to be caricatures. One fine Sunday\r\nafternoon I sat with a friend by the walk in Kensington Gardens that\r\nleads to the bridge, and which on such occasions is thronged by\r\npromenaders. It was agreed between us that whichever first caught\r\nsight of a typical John Bull should call the attention of the other.\r\nWe sat and watched keenly for many minutes, but neither of us found\r\noccasion to utter a word.\r\n\r\nThe prevalent type of English face has greatly changed at different\r\nperiods, for after making large allowance for the fashion in\r\nportrait painting of the day, there remains a great difference\r\nbetween the proportion in which certain casts of features are to be\r\nmet with at different dates. I have spent some time in studying the\r\nphotographs of the various portraits of English worthies that have\r\nbeen exhibited at successive loan collections, or which are now in\r\nthe National Portrait Gallery, and have traced what appear to be\r\nindisputable signs of one predominant type of face supplanting\r\nanother. For instance, the features of the men painted by and about\r\nthe time of Holbein have usually high cheekbones, long upper lips,\r\nthin eyebrows, and lank dark hair. It would be impossible, I think,\r\nfor the majority of modern Englishmen so to dress themselves and\r\nclip and arrange their hair, as to look like the majority of these\r\nportraits.\r\n\r\nEnglishmen are now a fair and reddish race, as may be seen from the\r\nDiagram, taken from the Report of the Anthropometric Committee to\r\nthe British Association in 1880 and which gives the proportion in\r\nwhich the various colours of hair are found among our professional\r\nclasses.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\nI take the professional classes because they correspond with the\r\nclass of English worthies better than any of the others from which\r\nreturns have been collected. The Diagram, however, gives a fair\r\nrepresentation of other classes of the community. For instance, I\r\nhave analysed the official records of the very carefully-selected\r\ncrews of H.M. S. _Alert_ and _Discovery_ in the Arctic Expedition of\r\n1875-6, and find the proportion of various shades of hair to be the\r\nsame among them as is shown in the Diagram. Seven-tenths of the\r\ncrews had complexions described as light, fair, fresh, ruddy or\r\nfreckled, and the same proportion had blue or gray eyes. They would\r\nhave contrasted strongly with Cromwell's regiment of Ironsides, who\r\nwere recruited from the dark-haired men of the fen districts, and\r\nwho are said to have left the impression on contemporary observers\r\nas being men of a peculiar breed. They would also probably have\r\ncontrasted with any body of thoroughgoing Puritan soldiers taken at\r\nhaphazard; for there is a prevalence of dark hair among men of\r\natrabilious and sour temperament.\r\n\r\nIf we may believe caricaturists, the fleshiness and obesity of many\r\nEnglish men and women in the earlier years of this century must have\r\nbeen prodigious. It testifies to the grosser conditions of life in\r\nthose days, and makes it improbable that the types best adapted to\r\nprevail then would be the best adapted to prevail now.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOMPOSITE PORTRAITURE.\r\n\r\nAs a means of getting over the difficulty of procuring really\r\nrepresentative faces, I contrived the method of composite portraiture,\r\nwhich has been explained of late on many occasions, and of which a\r\nfull account will be found in Appendix A. The principle on which the\r\ncomposites are made will best be understood by a description of my\r\nearlier and now discarded method; it was this--(1) I collected\r\nphotographic portraits of different persons, all of whom had been\r\nphotographed in the same aspect (say full face), and under the same\r\nconditions of light and shade (say with the light coming from the\r\nright side). (2) I reduced their portraits photographically to the\r\nsame size, being guided as to scale by the distance between any two\r\nconvenient points of reference in the features; for example, by the\r\nvertical distance between two parallel lines, one of which passed\r\nthrough the middle of the pupils of the eyes and the other between\r\nthe lips. (3) I superimposed the portraits like the successive\r\nleaves of a book, so that the features of each portrait lay as\r\nexactly as the case admitted, in front of those of the one behind it,\r\neye in front of eye and mouth in front of mouth. This I did by\r\nholding them successively to the light and adjusting them, then by\r\nfastening each to the preceding one with a strip of gummed paper\r\nalong one of the edges. Thus I obtained a book, each page of which\r\ncontained a separate portrait, and all the portraits lay exactly in\r\nfront of one another. (4) I fastened the book against the wall in\r\nsuch a way that I could turn over the pages in succession, leaving\r\nin turn each portrait flat and fully exposed. (5) I focused my\r\ncamera on the book fixed it firmly, and put a sensitive plate inside\r\nit. (6) I began photographing, taking one page after the other in\r\nsuccession without moving the camera, but putting on the cap whilst I\r\nwas turning over the pages, so that an image of each of the\r\nportraits in succession was thrown on the same part of the\r\nsensitised plate.\r\n\r\nOnly a fraction of the exposure required to make a good picture was\r\nallowed to each portrait. Suppose that period was twenty seconds,\r\nand that there were ten portraits, then an exposure of two seconds\r\nwould be allowed for each portrait, making twenty seconds in all.\r\nThis is the principle of the process, the details of that which I\r\nnow use are different and complex. They are fully explained in the\r\nAppendix for the use of those who may care to know about them.\r\n\r\nThe effect of composite portraiture is to bring into evidence all\r\nthe traits in which there is agreement, and to leave but a ghost of\r\na trace of individual peculiarities. There are so many traits in\r\ncommon in all faces that the composite picture when made from many\r\ncomponents is far from being a blur; it has altogether the look of\r\nan ideal composition.\r\n\r\nIt may be worth mentioning that when I take any small bundle of\r\nportraits, selected at hazard, I have generally found it easy to\r\nsort them into about five groups, four of which have enough\r\nresemblance among themselves to make as many fairly clear composites,\r\nwhile the fifth consists of faces that are too incongruous to be\r\ngrouped in a single class. In dealing with portraits of brothers and\r\nsisters, I can generally throw most of them into a single group, with\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nIn the small collection of composites given in the Plate facing p. 8,\r\nI have purposely selected many of those that I have previously\r\npublished, and whose originals, on a larger scale, I have at various\r\ntimes exhibited, together with their components, in order to put the\r\ngenuineness of the results beyond doubt. Those who see them for the\r\nfirst time can hardly believe but that one dominant face has\r\noverpowered the rest, and that they are composites only in name. When,\r\nhowever, the details are examined, this objection disappears. It is\r\ntrue that with careless photography one face may be allowed to\r\ndominate, but with the care that ought to be taken, and with the\r\nprecautions described in the Appendix, that does not occur. I have\r\noften been amused when showing composites and their components to\r\nfriends, to hear a strong expression of opinion that the\r\npredominance of one face was evident, and then on asking which face\r\nit was, to discover that they disagreed. I have even known a\r\ncomposite in which one portrait seemed unduly to prevail, to be\r\nremade without the component in question, and the result to be much\r\nthe same as before, showing that the reason of the resemblance was\r\nthat the rejected portrait had a close approximation to the ideal\r\naverage picture of the rest.\r\n\r\nThese small composites give a better notion of the utmost capacity\r\nof the process than the larger ones, from which they are reduced.\r\nIn the latter, the ghosts of individual peculiarities are more\r\nvisible, and usually the equal traces left by every member of a\r\nmoderately-sized group can be made out by careful inspection; but it\r\nis hardly possible to do this in the pictures in the Plate, except\r\nin a good light and in a very few of the cases. On the other hand,\r\nthe larger pictures do not contain more detail of value than the\r\nsmaller ones.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF THE COMPOSITES.\r\n\r\nThe medallion of Alexander the Great was made by combining the\r\nimages of six different medals, with a view of obtaining the type of\r\nfeatures that the makers of those medals concurred in desiring to\r\nascribe to him. The originals were kindly selected for me by Mr. R.\r\nStuart Poole from the collection in the British Museum. This\r\ncomposite was one of the first I ever made, and is printed together\r\nwith its six components in the _Journal of the Royal Institution_,\r\nin illustration of a lecture I gave there in April 1879. It seems to\r\nme that it is possible on this principle to obtain a truer likeness\r\nof a man than in any other way. Every artist makes mistakes; but by\r\ncombining the conscientious works of many artists, their separate\r\nmistakes disappear, and what is common to all of their works remains.\r\nSo as regards different photographs of the same person, those\r\naccidental momentary expressions are got rid of, which an ordinary\r\nphotograph made by a brief exposure cannot help recording. On the\r\nother hand, any happy sudden trait of expression is lost. The\r\ncomposite gives the features in repose.\r\n\r\nThe next pair of composites (full face and profile) on the Plate has\r\nnot been published before. The interest of the pair lies chiefly in\r\ntheir having been made from only two components, and they show how\r\ncuriously even two faces that have a moderate family likeness will\r\nblend into a single one. That neither of these predominated in the\r\npresent case will be learned from the following letter by the father\r\nof the ladies, who is himself a photographer:--\r\n\r\n\"I am exceedingly obliged for the very curious and interesting\r\ncomposite portraits of my two children. Knowing the faces so well,\r\nit caused me quite a surprise when I opened your letter. I put one\r\nof the full faces on the table for the mother to pick up casually.\r\nShe said, 'When did you do this portrait of A? how _like_ she is to B!\r\nOr _is_ it B? I never thought they were so like before.'  It has\r\npuzzled several people to say whether the profile was intended for A\r\nor B. Then I tried one of them on a friend who has not seen the\r\ngirls for years. He said, 'Well, it is one of the family for certain,\r\nbut I don't know which.'\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\nI have made several other family portraits, which to my eye seem\r\ngreat successes, but must candidly own that the persons whose\r\nportraits are blended together seldom seem to care much for the\r\nresult, except as a curiosity. We are all inclined to assert our\r\nindividuality, and to stand on our own basis, and to object to being\r\nmixed up indiscriminately with others. The same feeling finds\r\nexpression when the resident in a suburban street insists on calling\r\nhis house a villa with some fantastic name, and refuses, so long as\r\nhe can, to call it simply Number so and so in the street.\r\n\r\nThe last picture in the upper row shows the easy way in which young\r\nand old, male and female, combine to form an effective picture. The\r\ncomponents consist in this case of the father and mother, two sons,\r\nand two daughters. I exhibited the original of this, together with\r\nthe portraits from which it was taken, at the Loan Photographic\r\nExhibition at the Society of Arts in February 1882. I also sent\r\ncopies of the original of this same composite to several amateur\r\nphotographers, with a circular letter asking them to get from me\r\nfamily groups for the purpose of experiments, to see how far the\r\nprocess was suitable for family portraiture.\r\n\r\nThe middle row of portraits illustrates health, disease, and\r\ncriminality. For health, I have combined the portraits of twelve\r\nofficers of the Royal Engineers with about an equal number of\r\nprivates, which were taken for me by Lieutenant Darwin, R.E. The\r\nindividuals from whom this composite was made, which has not come\r\nout as clearly as I should have liked, differed considerably in\r\nfeature, and they came from various parts of England. The points they\r\nhad in common were the bodily and mental qualifications required for\r\nadmission into their select corps, and their generally British\r\ndescent. The result is a composite having an expression of\r\nconsiderable vigour, resolution, intelligence, and frankness. I have\r\nexhibited both this and others that were made respectively from the\r\nofficers, from the whole collection of privates--thirty-six in\r\nnumber--and from that selected portion of them that is utilised in\r\nthe present instance.\r\n\r\nThis face and the qualities it connotes probably gives a clue to the\r\ndirection in which the stock of the English race might most easily\r\nbe improved. It is the essential notion of a race that there should\r\nbe some ideal typical form from which the individuals may deviate in\r\nall directions, but about which they chiefly cluster, and towards\r\nwhich their descendants will continue to cluster. The easiest\r\ndirection in which a race can be improved is towards that central\r\ntype, because nothing new has to be sought out. It is only necessary\r\nto encourage as far as practicable the breed of those who conform\r\nmost nearly to the central type, and to restrain as far as may be\r\nthe breed of those who deviate widely from it. Now there can hardly\r\nbe a more appropriate method of discovering the central\r\nphysiognomical type of any race or group than that of composite\r\nportraiture.\r\n\r\nAs a contrast to the composite of the Royal Engineers, I give those\r\nof two of the coarse and low types of face found among the criminal\r\nclasses. The photographs from which they were made are taken from\r\ntwo large groups. One are those of men undergoing severe sentences\r\nfor murder and other crimes connected with violence; the other of\r\nthieves. They were reprints from those taken by order of the prison\r\nauthorities for purposes of identification. I was allowed to obtain\r\ncopies for use in my inquiries by the kind permission of Sir Edmund\r\nDu Cane, H.M. Director of Prisons. The originals of these and their\r\ncomponents have frequently been exhibited. It is unhappily a fact\r\nthat fairly distinct types of criminals breeding true to their kind\r\nhave become established, and are one of the saddest disfigurements\r\nof modern civilisation. To this subject I shall recur.\r\n\r\nI have made numerous composites of various groups of convicts, which\r\nare interesting negatively rather than positively. They produce\r\nfaces of a mean description, with no villainy written on them. The\r\nindividual faces are villainous enough, but they are villainous in\r\ndifferent ways, and when they are combined, the individual\r\npeculiarities disappear, and the common humanity of a low type is all\r\nthat is left.\r\n\r\nThe remaining portraits are illustrations of the application of the\r\nprocess to the study of the physiognomy of disease. They were\r\npublished a year ago with many others, together with several of\r\nthe portraits from which they were derived, in a joint memoir by\r\nDr. Mahomed and myself, in vol. xxv. of the _Guy's Hospital Reports_.\r\nThe originals and all the components have been exhibited on several\r\noccasions.\r\n\r\nIn the lower division of the Plate will be found three composites,\r\neach made from a large number of faces, unselected, except on the\r\nground of the disease under which they were suffering. When only few\r\nportraits are used, there must be some moderate resemblance between\r\nthem, or the result would be blurred; but here, dealing with as many\r\nas 56, 100, and 50 cases respectively, the combination of any medley\r\ngroup results in an ideal expression.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that the composite of 56 female faces is made by\r\nthe blending of two other composites, both of which are given. The\r\nhistory was this--I took the 56 portraits and sorted them into two\r\ngroups; in the first of these were 20 portraits that showed a\r\ntendency to thin features, in the other group there were 36 that\r\nshowed a tendency to thickened features. I made composites of each\r\nof them as shown in the Plate. Now it will be remarked that,\r\nnotwithstanding the attempt to make two contrasted groups, the\r\nnumber of mediocre cases was so great that the composities of the\r\ntwo groups are much alike. If I had divided the 56 into two\r\nhaphazard groups, the results would have been closely alike, as I\r\nknow from abundant experience of the kind. The co-composite of the\r\ntwo will be observed to have an intermediate expression. The test\r\nand measure of statistical truth lies in the degree of accordance\r\nbetween results obtained from different batches of instances of the\r\nsame generic class. It will be gathered from these instances that\r\ncomposite portraiture may attain statistical constancy, within\r\nlimits not easily distinguished by the eye, after some 30 haphazard\r\nportraits of the same class have been combined. This at least has\r\nbeen my experience thus far.\r\n\r\nThe two faces illustrative of the same type of tubercular disease\r\nare very striking; the uppermost is photographically interesting as\r\na case of predominance of one peculiarity, happily of no harm to the\r\neffect of the ideal wan face. It is that one of the patients had a\r\nsharply-checked black and white scarf, whose pattern has asserted\r\nitself unduly in the composite. In such cases I ought to throw the\r\ntoo clearly defined picture a little out of focus. The way in which\r\nthe varying brightness of different pictures is reduced to a uniform\r\nstandard of illumination is described in the Appendix.\r\n\r\nIt must be clearly understood that these portraits do not profess to\r\ngive the whole story of the physiognomy of phthisis. I have not room\r\nto give illustrations of other types--namely, that with coarse and\r\nblunted features, or the strumous one, nor any of the intermediates.\r\nThese have been discussed chiefly by Dr. Mahomed in the memoir\r\nalluded to above.\r\n\r\nIn the large experience I have had of sorting photographs, literally\r\nby the thousand, while making experiments with composites, I have\r\nbeen struck by certain general impressions. The consumptive patients\r\nconsisted of many hundred cases, including a considerable proportion\r\nof very ignoble specimens of humanity. Some were scrofulous and\r\nmisshapen, or suffered from various loathsome forms of inherited\r\ndisease; most were ill nourished. Nevertheless, in studying their\r\nportraits the pathetic interest prevailed, and I returned day after\r\nday to my tedious work of classification, with a liking for my\r\nmaterials. It was quite otherwise with the criminals. I did not\r\nadequately appreciate the degradation of their expressions for some\r\ntime; at last the sense of it took firm hold of me, and I cannot now\r\nhandle the portraits without overcoming by an effort the aversion\r\nthey suggest.\r\n\r\nI am sure that the method of composite portraiture opens a fertile\r\nfield of research to ethnologists, but I find it very difficult to\r\ndo much single-handed, on account of the difficulty of obtaining the\r\nnecessary materials. As a rule, the individuals must be specially\r\nphotographed. The portraits made by artists are taken in every\r\nconceivable aspect and variety of light and shade, but for the\r\npurpose in question the aspect and the shade must be the same\r\nthroughout. Group portraits would do to work from, were it not for\r\nthe strong out-of-door light under which they are necessarily taken,\r\nwhich gives an unwonted effect to the expression of the faces. Their\r\nscale also is too small to give a sufficiently clear picture when\r\nenlarged. I may say that the scale of the portraits need not be\r\nuniform, as my apparatus enlarges or reduces as required, at the\r\nsame time that it superposes the images; but the portraits of the\r\nheads should never be less than twice the size of that of the Queen\r\non a halfpenny piece.\r\n\r\nI heartily wish that amateur photographers would seriously take up\r\nthe subject of composite portraiture as applied to different\r\nsub-types of the varying races of men. I have already given more\r\ntime to perfecting the process and experimenting with it than I can\r\nwell spare.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBODILY QUALITIES.\r\n\r\nThe differences in the bodily qualities that are the usual subjects\r\nof anthropometry are easily dealt with, and are becoming widely\r\nregistered in many countries. We are unfortunately destitute of\r\ntrustworthy measurements of Englishmen of past generations to enable\r\nus to compare class with class, and to learn how far the several\r\nsections of the English nation may be improving or deteriorating. We\r\nshall, however, hand useful information concerning our own times to\r\nour successors, thanks principally to the exertions of an\r\nAnthropometric Committee established five years ago by the British\r\nAssociation, who have collected and partly classified and published\r\na large amount of facts, besides having induced several institutions,\r\nsuch as Marlborough College, to undertake a regular system of\r\nanthropometric record. I am not, however, concerned here with the\r\nlabours of this committee, nor with the separate valuable\r\npublications of some of its members, otherwise than in one small\r\nparticular which appears to show that the English population as a\r\nwhole, or perhaps I should say the urban portion of it, is in some\r\nsense deteriorating. It is that the average stature of the older\r\npersons measured by or for the committee has not been found to\r\ndecrease steadily with their age, but sometimes the reverse.[1] This\r\ncontradicts observations made on the heights of the same men at\r\ndifferent periods, whose stature after middle age is invariably\r\nreduced by the shrinking of the cartilages. The explanation offered\r\nwas that the statistical increase of stature with age should be\r\nascribed to the survival of the more stalwart. On reconsideration, I\r\nam inclined to doubt the adequacy of the explanation, and partly to\r\naccount for the fact by a steady, slight deterioration of stature in\r\nsuccessive years; in the urban population owing to the conditions of\r\ntheir lives, and in the rural population owing to the continual\r\ndraining away of the more stalwart of them to the towns.\r\n\r\nIt cannot be doubted that town life is harmful to the town population.\r\nI have myself investigated its effect on fertility (see Appendix B),\r\nand found that taking on the one hand a number of rural parishes,\r\nand on the other hand the inhabitants of a medium town, the former\r\nreared, nearly twice as many adult grandchildren as the latter. The\r\nvital functions are so closely related that an inferiority in the\r\nproduction of healthy children very probably implies a loss of\r\nvigour generally, one sign of which is a diminution of stature.\r\n\r\nThough the bulk of the population may deteriorate, there are many\r\nsigns that the better housed and fed portion of it improves. In the\r\nearlier years of this century the so-called manly sports of boxing\r\nand other feats of strength ranked high among the national amusements.\r\nA man who was [1] successful in these became the hero of a large and\r\ndemonstrative circle of admirers, and it is to be presumed that the\r\nbest boxer, the best pedestrian, and so forth, was the best adapted\r\nto succeed, through his natural physical gifts. If he was not the\r\nmost gifted man in those respects in the whole kingdom, he was\r\ncertainly one of the most gifted of them. It therefore does no\r\ninjustice to the men of that generation to compare the feats of\r\ntheir foremost athletes with those of ours who occupy themselves in\r\nthe same way. The comparison would probably err in their favour,\r\nbecause the interest in the particular feats in which our\r\ngrandfathers and great-grandfathers delighted are not those that\r\nchiefly interest the present generation, and notwithstanding our\r\nincreased population, there are fewer men now who attempt them. In\r\nthe beginning of this century there were many famous walking matches,\r\nand incomparably the best walker was Captain Barclay of Ury. His\r\nparamount feat, which was once very familiar to the elderly men of\r\nthe present time, was that of walking a thousand miles in a thousand\r\nhours, but of late years that feat has been frequently equalled and\r\noverpassed. I am willing to allow much influence to the modern\r\nconditions of walking under shelter and subject to improved methods\r\nof training (Captain Barclay himself originated the first method,\r\nwhich has been greatly improved since his time); still the fact\r\nremains that in executing this particular feat, the athletes of the\r\npresent day are more successful than those who lived some eighty\r\nyears ago. I may be permitted to give an example bearing on the\r\nincreased stature of the better housed and fed portion of the nation,\r\nin a recollection of my own as to the difference in height between\r\nmyself and my fellow-collegians at Trinity College, Cambridge, in\r\n1840-4. My height is 5 feet 9-3/4 inches, and I recollect perfectly\r\nthat among the crowd of undergraduates I stood somewhat taller than\r\nthe majority. I generally looked a little downward when I met their\r\neyes. In later years, whenever I have visited Cambridge, I have\r\nlingered in the ante-chapel and repeated the comparison, and now I\r\nfind myself decidedly shorter than the average of the students. I\r\nhave precisely the same kind of recollection and the same present\r\nexperience of the height of crowds of well-dressed persons. I used\r\nalways to get a fair view of what was going on over or between their\r\nheads; I rarely can do so now.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: _Trans. Brit. Assoc_., 1881, Table V., p. 242; and\r\nremarks by Mr. Roberts, p. 235.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe athletic achievements at school and college are much superior to\r\nwhat they used to be. Part is no doubt due to more skilful methods\r\nof execution, but not all. I cannot doubt that the more wholesome\r\nand abundant food, the moderation in drink, the better cooking, the\r\nwarmer wearing apparel, the airier sleeping rooms, the greater\r\ncleanliness, the more complete change in holidays, and the healthier\r\nlives led by the women in their girlhood, who become mothers\r\nafterwards, have a great influence for good on the favoured portion\r\nof our race.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of weakly and misshapen individuals is not to be\r\nestimated by those whom we meet in the streets; the worst cases are\r\nout of sight. We should parade before our mind's eye the inmates of\r\nthe lunatic, idiot, and pauper asylums, the prisoners, the patients\r\nin hospitals, the sufferers at home, the crippled, and the\r\ncongenitally blind, and that large class of more or less wealthy\r\npersons who flee to the sunnier coasts of England, or expatriate\r\nthemselves for the chance of life. There can hardly be a sadder\r\nsight than the crowd of delicate English men and women with narrow\r\nchests and weak chins, scrofulous, and otherwise gravely affected,\r\nwho are to be found in some of these places. Even this does not tell\r\nthe whole of the story; if there were a conscription in England, we\r\nshould find, as in other countries, that a large fraction of the men\r\nwho earn their living by sedentary occupations are unfit for\r\nmilitary service. Our human civilised stock is far more weakly\r\nthrough congenital imperfection than that of any other species of\r\nanimals, whether wild or domestic.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, by no means the most shapely or the biggest\r\npersonages who endure hardship the best. Some very shabby-looking\r\nmen have extraordinary stamina. Sickly-looking and puny residents in\r\ntowns may have a more suitable constitution for the special\r\nconditions of their lives, and may in some sense be better knit and\r\ndo more work and live longer than much haler men imported to the\r\nsame locality from elsewhere. A wheel and a barrel seem to have the\r\nflimsiest possible constitutions; they consist of numerous separate\r\npieces all oddly shaped, which, when lying in a heap, look\r\nhopelessly unfitted for union; but put them properly together,\r\ncompress them with a tire in the one case and with hoops in the other,\r\nand a remarkably enduring organisation will result. A wheel with a\r\nton weight on the top of it in the waggons of South Africa will jolt\r\nfor thousands of miles over stony, roadless country without\r\nsuffering harm; a keg of water may be strapped on the back of a\r\npack-ox or a mule, and be kicked off and trampled on, and be\r\notherwise misused for years, without giving way.\r\n\r\nI do not propose to enter further into the anthropometric\r\ndifferences of race, for the subject is a very large one, and this\r\nbook does not profess to go into detail. Its intention is to touch\r\non various topics more or less connected with that of the\r\ncultivation of race, or, as we might call it, with \"eugenic\" [1]\r\nquestions, and to present the results of several of my own separate\r\ninvestigations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENERGY.\r\n\r\nEnergy is the capacity for labour. It is consistent with all the\r\nrobust virtues, and makes a large practice of them possible. It is\r\nthe measure of fulness of life; the more energy the more abundance\r\nof it; no energy at all is death; idiots are feeble and listless. In\r\nthe inquiries I made on the antecedents of men of science no points\r\ncame out more strongly than that the leaders of scientific thought\r\nwere generally gifted with remarkable energy, and that they had\r\n[2] inherited the gift of it from their parents and grandparents. I\r\nhave since found the same to be the case in other careers.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: That is, with questions bearing on what is termed in\r\nGreek, _eugenes_, namely, good in stock, hereditarily endowed with\r\nnoble qualities. This, and the allied words, _eugeneia_, etc., are\r\nequally applicable to men, brutes, and plants. We greatly want a\r\nbrief word to express the science of improving stock, which is by no\r\nmeans confined to questions of judicious mating, but which,\r\nespecially in the case of man, takes cognisance of all influences\r\nthat tend in however remote a degree to give to the more suitable\r\nraces or strains of blood a better chance of prevailing speedily\r\nover the less suitable than they otherwise would have had. The word\r\n_eugenics_ would sufficiently express the idea; it is at least a\r\nneater word and a more generalised one than _viriculture_, which I\r\nonce ventured to use.]\r\n\r\nEnergy is an attribute of the higher races, being favoured beyond\r\nall other qualities by natural selection. We are goaded into\r\nactivity by the conditions and struggles of life. They afford\r\nstimuli that oppress and worry the weakly, who complain and bewail,\r\nand it may be succumb to them, but which the energetic man welcomes\r\nwith a good-humoured shrug, and is the better for in the end.\r\n\r\nThe stimuli may be of any description: the only important matter is\r\nthat all the faculties should be kept working to prevent their\r\nperishing by disuse. If the faculties are few, very simple stimuli\r\nwill suffice. Even that of fleas will go a long way. A dog is\r\ncontinually scratching himself, and a bird pluming itself, whenever\r\nthey are not occupied with food, hunting, fighting, or love. In\r\nthose blank times there is very little for them to attend to besides\r\ntheir varied cutaneous irritations. It is a matter of observation\r\nthat well washed and combed domestic pets grow dull; they miss the\r\nstimulus of fleas. If animals did not prosper through the agency of\r\ntheir insect plagues, it seems probable that their races would long\r\nsince have been so modified that their bodies should have ceased to\r\nafford a pasture-ground for parasites.\r\n\r\nIt does not seem to follow that because men are capable of doing\r\nhard work they like it. Some, indeed, fidget and fret if they cannot\r\notherwise work off their superfluous steam; but on the other hand\r\nthere are many big lazy fellows who will not get up their steam to\r\nfull pressure except under compulsion. Again, the character of the\r\nstimulus that induces hard work differs greatly in different persons;\r\nit may be wealth, ambition, or other object of passion. The solitary\r\nhard workers, under no encouragement or compulsion except their\r\nsense of duty to their generation, are unfortunately still rare\r\namong us.\r\n\r\nIt may be objected that if the race were too healthy and energetic\r\nthere would be insufficient call for the exercise of the pitying and\r\nself-denying virtues, and the character of men would grow harder in\r\nconsequence. But it does not seem reasonable to preserve sickly\r\nbreeds for the sole purpose of tending them, as the breed of foxes\r\nis preserved solely for sport and its attendant advantages. There is\r\nlittle fear that misery will ever cease from the land, or that the\r\ncompassionate will fail to find objects for their compassion; but at\r\npresent the supply vastly exceeds the demand: the land is\r\noverstocked and overburdened with the listless and the incapable.\r\n\r\nIn any scheme of eugenics, energy is the most important quality to\r\nfavour; it is, as we have seen, the basis of living action, and it\r\nis eminently transmissible by descent.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSENSITIVITY.\r\n\r\nThe only information that reaches us concerning outward events\r\nappears to pass through the avenue of our senses; and the more\r\nperceptive the senses are of difference, the larger is the field\r\nupon which our judgment and intelligence can act. Sensation mounts\r\nthrough a series of grades of \"just perceptible differences.\" It\r\nstarts from the zero of consciousness, and it becomes more intense\r\nas the stimulus increases (though at a slower rate) up to the point\r\nwhen the stimulus is so strong as to begin to damage the nerve\r\napparatus. It then yields place to pain, which is another form of\r\nsensation, and which continues until the nerve apparatus is destroyed.\r\nTwo persons may be equally able just to hear the same faint sound,\r\nand they may equally begin to be pained by the same loud sound, and\r\nyet they may differ as to the number of intermediate grades of\r\nsensation. The grades will be less numerous as the organisation is\r\nof a lower order, and the keenest sensation possible to it will in\r\nconsequence be less intense. An artist who is capable of\r\ndiscriminating more differences of tint than another man is not\r\nnecessarily more capable of seeing clearly in twilight, or more or\r\nless intolerant of sunshine. A musician is not necessarily able to\r\nhear very faint sounds, nor to be more startled by loud sounds than\r\nothers are. A mechanic who works hard with heavy tools and has rough\r\nand grimy thumbs, insensible to very slight pressures, may yet have\r\na singularly discriminating power of touch in respect to the\r\npressures that he can feel.\r\n\r\nThe discriminative faculty of idiots is curiously low; they hardly\r\ndistinguish between heat and cold, and their sense of pain is so\r\nobtuse that some of the more idiotic seem hardly to know what it is.\r\nIn their dull lives, such pain as can be excited in them may\r\nliterally be accepted with a welcome surprise. During a visit to\r\nEarlswood Asylum I saw two boys whose toe-nails had grown into the\r\nflesh and had been excised by the surgeon. This is a horrible\r\ntorture to ordinary persons, but the idiot lads were said to have\r\nshown no distress during the operation; it was not necessary to hold\r\nthem, and they looked rather interested at what was being done.\r\n[1] I also saw a boy with the scar of a severe wound on his wrist;\r\nthe story being that he had first burned himself slightly by accident,\r\nand, liking the keenness of the new sensation, he took the next\r\nopportunity of repeating the experience, but, idiot-like, he overdid\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe trials I have as yet made on the sensitivity of different\r\npersons confirms the reasonable expectation that it would on the\r\nwhole be highest among the intellectually ablest. At first, owing to\r\nmy confusing the quality of which I am speaking with that of nervous\r\nirritability, I fancied that women of delicate nerves who are\r\ndistressed by noise, sunshine, etc., would have acute powers of\r\ndiscrimination. But this I found not to be the case. In morbidly\r\nsensitive persons both pain and sensation are induced by lower\r\nstimuli than in the healthy, but the number of just perceptible\r\ngrades of sensation between them is not necessarily different.\r\n\r\nI found as a rule that men have more delicate powers of\r\ndiscrimination than women, and the business experience of life seems\r\nto confirm this view. The tuners of pianofortes are men, and so I\r\nunderstand are the tasters of tea and wine, the sorters of wool, and\r\nthe like. These latter occupations are well salaried, because it is\r\nof the first moment to the merchant that he should be rightly advised\r\non the real value of what he is about to purchase or to sell. If the\r\nsensitivity of women were superior to that of men, the self-interest\r\nof merchants would lead to their being [3] always employed; but as\r\nthe reverse is the case, the opposite supposition is likely to be\r\nthe true one.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: See \"Remarks on Idiocy,\" by E.W. Graham, M. D.,\r\n_Medical Journal_, January 16, 1875.]\r\n\r\nLadies rarely distinguish the merits of wine at the dinner-table,\r\nand though custom allows them to preside at the breakfast-table, men\r\nthink them on the whole to be far from successful makers of tea and\r\ncoffee.\r\n\r\nBlind persons are reputed to have acquired in compensation for the\r\nloss of their eyesight an increased acuteness in their other senses;\r\nI was therefore curious to make some trials with my test apparatus,\r\nwhich I will describe in the next chapter. I was permitted to do so\r\non a number of boys at a large educational blind asylum, but found\r\nthat, although they were anxious to do their best, their performances\r\nwere by no means superior to those of other boys. It so happened\r\nthat the blind lads who showed the most delicacy of touch and won\r\nthe little prizes I offered to excite emulation, barely reached the\r\nmediocrity of the various sighted lads of the same age whom I had\r\npreviously tested. I have made not a few observations and inquiries,\r\nand find that the guidance of the blind depends mainly on the\r\nmultitude of collateral indications to which they give much heed,\r\nand not in their superior sensitivity to any one of them. Those who\r\nsee do not care for so many of these collateral indications, and\r\nhabitually overlook and neglect several of them. I am convinced also\r\nthat not a little of the popular belief concerning the sensitivity\r\nof the blind is due to exaggerated claims on their part that have\r\nnot been verified. Two instances of this have fallen within my own\r\nexperience, in both of which the blind persons claimed to have the\r\npower of judging by the echo of their voice and by certain other\r\nfeelings, the one when they were approaching objects, even though\r\nthe object was so small as a handrail, and the other to tell how far\r\nthe door of the room in which he was standing was open. I used all\r\nthe persuasion I could to induce each of these persons to allow me\r\nto put their assertions to the test; but it was of no use. The one\r\nmade excuses, the other positively refused. They had probably the\r\nsame tendency that others would have who happened to be defective in\r\nany faculty that their comrades possessed, to fight bravely against\r\ntheir disadvantage, and at the same time to be betrayed into some\r\novervaunting of their capacities in other directions. They would be\r\na little conscious of this, and would therefore shrink from being\r\ntested.\r\n\r\nThe power of reading by touch is not so very wonderful. A former\r\nLord Chancellor of England, the late Lord Hatherley, when he was\r\nadvanced in years, lost his eyesight for some time owing to a\r\ncataract, which was not ripe to be operated on. He assured me that\r\nhe had then learned and practised reading by touch very rapidly.\r\nThis fact may perhaps also serve as additional evidence of the\r\nsensitivity of able men.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding many travellers' tales, I have thus far been\r\nunsuccessful in obtaining satisfactory evidence of any general large\r\nsuperiority of the senses of savages over those of civilised men. My\r\nown experience, so far as it goes, of Hottentots, Damaras, and some\r\nother wild races, went to show that their sense discrimination was\r\nnot superior to those of white men, even as regards keenness of\r\neyesight. An offhand observer is apt to err by assigning to a single\r\ncause what is partly due to others as well. Thus, as regards eyesight,\r\na savage who is accustomed to watch oxen grazing at a distance\r\nbecomes so familiar with their appearance and habits that he can\r\nidentify particular animals and draw conclusions as to what they are\r\ndoing with an accuracy that may seem to strangers to be wholly\r\ndependent on exceptional acuteness of vision. A sailor has the\r\nreputation of keen sight because he sees a distant coast when a\r\nlandsman cannot make it out; the fact being that the landsman\r\nusually expects a different appearance to what he has really to look\r\nfor, such as a very minute and sharp outline instead of a large,\r\nfaint blur. In a short time a landsman becomes quite as quick as a\r\nsailor, and in some test experiments[1] he was found on the average\r\nto be distinctly the superior. It is not surprising that this should\r\nbe so, as sailors in vessels of moderate size have hardly ever the\r\npractice of focussing their eyes sharply upon objects farther off\r\nthan the length of the vessel or the top of the mast, say at a\r\ndistance of fifty paces. The horizon itself as seen from the deck,\r\n[4] and under the most favourable circumstances, is barely four\r\nmiles off, and there is no sharpness of outline in the intervening\r\nwaves. Besides this, the life of a sailor is very unhealthy, as\r\nshown by his growing old prematurely, and his eyes must be much\r\ntried by foul weather and salt spray.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Gould's _Military and Anthropological Statistics_, p.\r\n530. New York, 1869.]\r\n\r\nWe inherit our language from barbarous ancestors, and it shows\r\ntraces of its origin in the imperfect ways by which grades of\r\ndifference admit of being expressed. Suppose a pedestrian is asked\r\nwhether the knapsack on his back feels heavy. He cannot find a reply\r\nin two words that cover more varieties than (1) very heavy, (2)\r\nrather heavy, (3) moderate, (4) rather light, (5) very light. I once\r\ntook considerable pains in the attempt to draw up verbal scales of\r\nmore than five orders of magnitude, using those expressions only\r\nthat every cultivated person would understand in the same sense; but\r\nI did not succeed. A series that satisfied one person was not\r\ninterpreted in the same sense by another.\r\n\r\nThe general intention of this chapter has been to show that a\r\ndelicate power of sense discrimination is an attribute of a high race,\r\nand that it has not the drawback of being necessarily associated\r\nwith nervous irritability.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSEQUENCE OF TEST WEIGHTS.\r\n\r\nI will now describe an apparatus I have constructed to test the\r\ndelicacy with which weights may be discriminated by handling them. I\r\ndo so because the principle on which it is based may be adopted in\r\napparatus for testing other senses, and its description and the\r\nconditions of its use will illustrate the desiderata and\r\ndifficulties of all such investigations.\r\n\r\nA series of test weights is a simple enough idea--the difficulty\r\nlies in determining the particular sequence of weights that should\r\nbe employed. Mine form a geometric series, for the reason that when\r\nstimuli of all kinds increase by geometric grades the sensations\r\nthey give rise to will increase by arithmetic grades, so long as the\r\nstimulus is neither so weak as to be barely felt, nor so strong as\r\nto excite fatigue. My apparatus, which is explained more fully in the\r\nAppendix, consists of a number of common gun cartridge cases filled\r\nwith alternate layers of shot, wool, and wadding, and then closed in\r\nthe usual way. They are all identical in appearance, and may be said\r\nto differ only in their specific gravities. They are marked in\r\nnumerical sequence with the register numbers, 1, 2, 3, etc., but\r\ntheir weights are proportioned to the numbers of which 1, 2, 3, etc.,\r\nare the logarithms, and consequently run in a geometric series.\r\nHence the numbers of the weights form a scale of equal degrees of\r\nsensitivity. If a person can just distinguish between the weights\r\nnumbered 1 and 3, he can also just distinguish between 2 and 4, 3 and\r\n5, and any other pair of weights of which the register number of\r\nthe one exceeds that of the other by 2. Again, his coarseness of\r\ndiscrimination is exactly double of that of another person who can\r\njust distinguish pairs of weights differing only by 1, such as 1 and\r\n2, 2 and 3, 3 and 4, and so on. The testing is performed by handing\r\npairs of weights to the operatee until his power of discrimination\r\nis approximately made out, and then to proceed more carefully. It is\r\nbest now, for reasons stated in the Appendix, to hand to the\r\noperatee sequences of three weights at a time, after shuffling them.\r\nThese he has to arrange in their proper order, with his eyes shut,\r\nand by the sense of their weight alone. The operator finally records\r\nthe scale interval that the operatee can just appreciate, as being\r\nthe true measure of the coarseness (or the inverse measure of the\r\ndelicacy) of the sensitivity of the operatee.\r\n\r\nIt is somewhat tedious to test many persons in succession, but any\r\none can test his own powers at odd and end times with ease and nicety,\r\nif he happens to have ready access to suitable apparatus.\r\n\r\nThe use of tests, which, objectively speaking, run in a geometric\r\nseries, and subjectively in an arithmetic one, may be applied to\r\ntouch, by the use of wire-work of various degrees of fineness; to\r\ntaste, by stock bottles of solutions of salt, etc., of various\r\nstrengths; to smell, by bottles of attar of rose, etc., in various\r\ndegrees of dilution.\r\n\r\nThe tests show the sensitivity at the time they are made, and give\r\nan approximate measure of the discrimination with which the operatee\r\nhabitually employs his senses. It does not measure his capacity for\r\ndiscrimination, because the discriminative faculty admits of much\r\neducation, and the test results always show increased delicacy after\r\na little practice. However, the requirements of everyday life\r\neducate all our faculties in some degree, and I have not found the\r\nperformances with test weights to improve much after a little\r\nfamiliarity with their use. The weights have, as it were, to be\r\nplayed with at first, then they must be tried carefully on three or\r\nfour separate occasions.\r\n\r\nI did not at first find it at all an easy matter to make test\r\nweights so alike as to differ in no other appreciable respect than\r\nin their specific gravity, and if they differ and become known apart,\r\nthe knowledge so acquired will vitiate future judgments in various\r\nindirect ways. Similarity in outward shape and touch was ensured by\r\nthe use of mechanically-made cartridge cases; dissimilarity through\r\nany external stain was rendered of no hindrance to the experiment by\r\nmaking the operatee handle them in a bag or with his eyes shut. Two\r\nbodies may, however, be alike in weight and outward appearance and\r\nyet behave differently when otherwise mechanically tested, and,\r\nconsequently, when they are handled. For example, take two eggs, one\r\nraw and the other hard boiled, and spin them on the table; press the\r\nfinger for a moment upon either of them whilst it is still spinning:\r\nif it be the hard-boiled egg it will stop as dead as a stone: if it\r\nbe the raw egg, after a little apparent hesitation, it will begin\r\nagain to rotate. The motion of its shell had alone been stopped; the\r\ninternal part was still rotating and this compelled the shell to\r\nfollow it. Owing to this cause, when we handle the two eggs, the one\r\nfeels \"quick\" and the other does not. Similarly with the cartridges,\r\nwhen one is rather more loosely packed than the others the\r\ndifference is perceived on handling them. Or it may have one end\r\nheavier than the other, or else its weight may not be equally\r\ndistributed round its axis, causing it to rest on the table with the\r\nsame part always lowermost; differences due to these causes are also\r\neasily perceived when handling the cartridges. Again, one of two\r\nsimilar cartridges may balance perfectly in all directions, but the\r\nweight of one of them may be disposed too much towards the ends, as\r\nin a dumb-bell, or gathered too much towards the centre. The period\r\nof oscillation will differ widely in the two cases, as may be shown\r\nby suspending the cartridges by strings round their middle so that\r\nthey shall hang horizontally, and then by a slight tap making them\r\nspin to and fro round the string as an axis.\r\n\r\nThe touch is very keen in distinguishing all these peculiarities. I\r\nhave mentioned them, and might have added more, to show that\r\nexperiments on sensitivity have to be made in the midst of pitfalls\r\nwarily to be avoided. Our apparently simplest perceptions are very\r\ncomplex. We hardly ever act on the information given by only one\r\nelement of one sense, and our sensitivity in any desired direction\r\ncannot be rightly determined except by carefully-devised apparatus\r\njudiciously used.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWHISTLES FOR AUDIBILITY OF SHRILL NOTES.\r\n\r\nI contrived a small whistle for conveniently ascertaining the upper\r\nlimits of audible sound in different persons, which Dr. Wollaston\r\nhad shown to vary considerably. He used small pipes, and found much\r\ndifficulty in making them. I made a very small whistle from a brass\r\ntube whose internal diameter was less than one-tenth of an inch in\r\ndiameter. A plug was fitted into the lower end of the tube, which\r\ncould be pulled out or pushed in as much as desired, thereby causing\r\nthe length of the bore of the whistle to be varied at will. When the\r\nbore is long the note is low; when short, it is high. The plug was\r\ngraduated, so that the precise note produced by the whistle could be\r\ndetermined by reading off the graduations and referring to a table.\r\n(See Appendix.)\r\n\r\nOn testing different persons, I found there was a remarkable falling\r\noff in the power of hearing high notes as age advanced. The persons\r\nthemselves were quite unconscious of their deficiency so long as\r\ntheir sense of hearing low notes remained unimpaired. It is an only\r\ntoo amusing experiment to test a party of persons of various ages,\r\nincluding some rather elderly and self-satisfied personages. They\r\nare indignant at being thought deficient in the power of hearing, yet\r\nthe experiment quickly shows that they are absolutely deaf to shrill\r\nnotes which the younger persons hear acutely, and they commonly\r\nbetray much dislike to the discovery. Every one has his limit, and\r\nthe limit at which sounds become too shrill to be audible to any\r\nparticular person can be rapidly determined by this little instrument.\r\nLord Rayleigh and others have found that sensitive flames are\r\npowerfully affected by the vibrations of whistles that are too rapid\r\nto be audible to ordinary ears.\r\n\r\nI have tried experiments with all kinds of animals on their\r\npowers of hearing shrill notes. I have gone through the whole\r\nof the Zoological Gardens, using an apparatus arranged for the\r\npurpose. It consists of one of my little whistles at the end of a\r\nwalking-stick--that is, in reality, a long tube; it has a bit of\r\nindia-rubber pipe under the handle, a sudden squeeze upon which\r\nforces a little air into the whistle and causes it to sound. I hold\r\nit as near as is safe to the ears of the animals, and when they are\r\nquite accustomed to its presence and heedless of it, I make it sound;\r\nthen if they prick their ears it shows that they hear the whistle; if\r\nthey do not, it is probably inaudible to them. Still, it is very\r\npossible that in some cases they hear but do not heed the sound. Of\r\nall creatures, I have found none superior to cats in the power of\r\nhearing shrill sounds; it is perfectly remarkable what a faculty\r\nthey have in this way. Cats, of course, have to deal in the dark\r\nwith mice, and to find them out by their squealing. Many people\r\ncannot hear the shrill squeal of a mouse. Some time ago, singing\r\nmice were exhibited in London, and of the people who went to hear\r\nthem, some could hear nothing, whilst others could hear a little, and\r\nothers again could hear much. Cats are differentiated by natural\r\nselection until they have a power of hearing all the high notes made\r\nby mice and other little creatures that they have to catch. A cat\r\nthat is at a very considerable distance, can be made to turn its ear\r\nround by sounding a note that is too shrill to be audible by almost\r\nany human ear. Small dogs also hear very shrill notes, but large\r\nones do not. I have walked through the streets of a town with an\r\ninstrument like that which I used in the Zoological Gardens, and\r\nmade nearly all the little dogs turn round, but not the large ones.\r\nAt Berne, where there appear to be more large dogs lying idly about\r\nthe streets than in any other town in Europe, I have tried the\r\nwhistle for hours together, on a great many large dogs, but could\r\nnot find one that heard it. Ponies are sometimes able to hear very\r\nhigh notes. I once frightened a pony with one of these whistles in\r\nthe middle of a large field. My attempts on insect hearing have been\r\nfailures.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANTHROPOMETRIC REGISTERS.\r\n\r\nWhen shall we have anthropometric laboratories, where a man may,\r\nwhen he pleases, get himself and his children weighed, measured, and\r\nrightly photographed, and have their bodily faculties tested by the\r\nbest methods known to modern science? The records of growth of\r\nnumerous persons from childhood to age are required before it can be\r\npossible to rightly appraise the effect of external conditions upon\r\ndevelopment, and records of this kind are at present non-existent.\r\nThe various measurements should be accompanied by photographic\r\nstudies of the features in full face and in profile, and on the same\r\nscale, for convenience of comparison.\r\n\r\nWe are all lazy in recording facts bearing on ourselves, but parents\r\nare glad enough to do so in respect to their children, and they\r\nwould probably be inclined to avail themselves of a laboratory where\r\nall that is required could be done easily and at small cost. These\r\ndomestic records would hereafter become of considerable biographical\r\ninterest. Every one of us in his mature age would be glad of a series\r\nof pictures of himself from childhood onwards, accompanied by\r\nphysical records, and arranged consecutively with notes of current\r\nevents by their sides. Much more would he be glad of similar\r\ncollections referring to his father, mother, grandparents, and other\r\nnear relatives. It would be peculiarly grateful to the young to\r\npossess likenesses of their parents and those whom they look upon as\r\nheroes, taken when they were of the same age as themselves. Boys are\r\ntoo apt to think of their parents as having always been elderly men,\r\nbecause they have insufficient data to construct imaginary pictures\r\nof them as they were in their youth.\r\n\r\nThe cost of taking photographs in batches is so small, and the time\r\noccupied is so brief, when the necessary preparations have been made\r\nand the sitters are ready at hand, that a practice of methodically\r\nphotographing schoolboys and members of other large institutions\r\nmight easily be established. I, for one, should dearly prize the\r\nopportunity of visiting the places where I have been educated, and\r\nof turning over pages showing myself and my companions as we were in\r\nthose days. But no such records exist; the institutions last and\r\nflourish, the individuals who pass through them are dispersed and\r\nleave few or no memorials behind. It seems a cruel waste of\r\nopportunity not to make and keep these brief personal records in a\r\nmethodical manner. The fading of ordinary photographic prints is no\r\nreal objection to keeping a register, because they can now be\r\nreproduced at small charge in permanent printers' ink, by the\r\nautotype and other processes.\r\n\r\nI have seen with admiration, and have had an opportunity of availing\r\nmyself of, the newly-established library of well-ordered folios at\r\nthe Admiralty, each containing a thousand pages, and each page\r\ncontaining a brief summary of references to the life of a particular\r\nseaman. There are already 80,000 pages, and owing to the excellent\r\norganisation of the office it is a matter of perfect ease to follow\r\nout any one of these references, and to learn every detail of the\r\nservice of any seaman. A brief register of measurements and events in\r\nthe histories of a large number of persons, previous to their\r\nentering any institution and during their residence in it, need not\r\ntherefore be a difficult matter to those who may take it in hand\r\nseriously and methodically.\r\n\r\nThe recommendation I would venture to make to my readers is to\r\nobtain photographs and ordinary measurements periodically of\r\nthemselves and their children, making it a family custom to do so,\r\nbecause, unless driven by some custom, the act will be postponed\r\nuntil the opportunity is lost. Let those periodical photographs be\r\nfull and side views of the face on an adequate scale, adding any\r\nothers that may be wished, but not omitting these. As the portraits\r\naccumulate have collections of them autotyped. Keep the prints\r\nmethodically in a family register, writing by their side careful\r\nchronicles of illness and all such events as used to find a place on\r\nthe fly-leaf of the Bible of former generations, and inserting other\r\ninteresting personal facts and whatever anthropometric data can be\r\ncollected.\r\n\r\nThose who care to initiate and carry on a family chronicle\r\nillustrated by abundant photographic portraiture, will produce a\r\nwork that they and their children and their descendants in more\r\nremote generations will assuredly be grateful for. The family tie\r\nhas a real as well as a traditional significance. The world is\r\nbeginning to awaken to the fact that the life of the individual is\r\nin some real sense a prolongation of those of his ancestry. His\r\nvigour, his character, and his diseases are principally derived from\r\ntheirs; sometimes his faculties are blends of ancestral qualities;\r\nbut more frequently they are mosaics, patches of resemblance to one\r\nor other of them showing now here and now there. The life-histories\r\nof our relatives are prophetic of our own futures; they are far more\r\ninstructive to us than those of strangers, far more fitted to\r\nencourage and to forewarn us. If there be such a thing as a natural\r\nbirthright, I can conceive of none superior to the right of the\r\nchild to be informed, at first by proxy through his guardians, and\r\nafterwards personally, of the life-history, medical and other, of\r\nhis ancestry. The child is thrust into existence without his having\r\nany voice at all in the matter, and the smallest amend that those\r\nwho brought him here can make, is to furnish him with all the\r\nguidance they can, including the complete life-histories of his near\r\nprogenitors.\r\n\r\nThe investigation of human eugenics--that is, of the conditions\r\nunder which men of a high type are produced--is at present extremely\r\nhampered by the want of full family histories, both medical and\r\ngeneral, extending over three or four generations. There is no such\r\ndifficulty in investigating animal eugenics, because the generations\r\nof horses, cattle, dogs, etc., are brief, and the breeder of any\r\nsuch stock lives long enough to acquire a large amount of experience\r\nfrom his own personal observation. A man, however, can rarely be\r\nfamiliar with more than two or three generations of his\r\ncontemporaries before age has begun to check his powers; his working\r\nexperience must therefore be chiefly based upon records. Believing,\r\nas I do, that human eugenics will become recognised before long as a\r\nstudy of the highest practical importance, it seems to me that no\r\ntime ought to be lost in encouraging and directing a habit of\r\ncompiling personal and family histories. If the necessary materials\r\nbe brought into existence, it will require no more than zeal and\r\npersuasiveness on the part of the future investigator to collect as\r\nlarge a store of them as he may require.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNCONSCIOUSNESS OF PECULIARITIES.\r\n\r\nThe importance of submitting our faculties to measurement lies in\r\nthe curious unconsciousness in which we are apt to live of our\r\npersonal peculiarities, and which our intimate friends often fail to\r\nremark. I have spoken of the ignorance of elderly persons of their\r\ndeafness to high notes, but even the existence of such a peculiarity\r\nas colour blindness was not suspected until the memoir of Dalton in\r\n1794. That one person out of twenty-nine or thereabouts should be\r\nunable to distinguish a red from a green, without knowing that he\r\nhad any deficiency of colour sense, and without betraying his\r\ndeficiency to his friends, seems perfectly incredible to the other\r\ntwenty-eight; yet as a matter of fact he rarely does either the one\r\nor the other. It is hard to convince the colour-blind of their own\r\ninfirmity. I have seen curious instances of this: one was that of a\r\nperson by no means unpractised in physical research, who had been\r\nhimself tested in matching colours. He gave me his own version of\r\nthe result, to the effect that though he might perhaps have fallen a\r\nlittle short of perfection as judged by over-refined tests, his\r\ncolour sense was for all practical purposes quite good. On the other\r\nhand, the operator assured me that when he had toned the intensities\r\nof a pure red and a pure green in a certain proportion, the person\r\nceased to be able to distinguish between them! Colour blindness is\r\noften very difficult to detect, because the test hues and tints may\r\nbe discriminated by other means than by the normal colour sense.\r\nOrdinary pigments are never pure, and the test colours may be\r\ndistinguished by those of their adventitious hues to which the\r\npartly colour-blind man may be sensitive. We do not suspect\r\nourselves to be yellow-blind by candle light, because we enjoy\r\npictures in the evening nearly or perhaps quite as much as in the day\r\ntime; yet we may observe that a yellow primrose laid on the white\r\ntable-cloth wholly loses its colour by candle light, and becomes as\r\nwhite as a snowdrop.\r\n\r\nIn the inquiries I made on the hereditary transmission of capacity,\r\nI was often amused by the naïve remark of men who had easily\r\ndistanced their competitors, that they ascribed their success to\r\ntheir own exertions. They little recognised how much they owed to\r\ntheir natural gifts of exceptional capacity and energy on the one\r\nhand, and of exceptional love for their special work on the other.\r\n\r\nIn future chapters I shall give accounts of persons who have unusual\r\nmental characteristics as regards imagery, visualised numerals,\r\ncolours connected with sounds and special associations of ideas,\r\nbeing unconscious of their peculiarities; but I cannot anticipate\r\nthese subjects here, as they all require explanation. It will be\r\nseen in the end how greatly metaphysicians and psychologists may err,\r\nwho assume their own mental operations, instincts, and axioms to be\r\nidentical with those of the rest of mankind, instead of being\r\nspecial to themselves. The differences between men are profound, and\r\nwe can only be saved from living in blind unconsciousness of our own\r\nmental peculiarities by the habit of informing ourselves as well as\r\nwe can of those of others. Examples of the success with which this\r\ncan be done will be found farther on in the book.\r\n\r\nI may take this opportunity of remarking on the well-known\r\nhereditary character of colour blindness in connection with the fact,\r\nthat it is nearly twice as prevalent among the Quakers as among the\r\nrest of the community, the proportions being as 5.9 to 3.5 per cent.\r\n[1] We might have expected an even larger ratio. Nearly every Quaker\r\nis descended on both sides solely from members of a group of men and\r\nwomen who segregated themselves from the rest of the world five or\r\nsix generations ago; one of their strongest opinions being that the\r\nfine arts were worldly snares, and their most conspicuous practice\r\nbeing to dress in drabs. A born artist could never have consented to\r\nseparate himself from his fellows on such grounds; he would have\r\nfelt the profession of those opinions [5] and their accompanying\r\npractices to be a treason to his aesthetic nature. Consequently few\r\nof the original stock of Quakers are likely to have had the\r\ntemperament that is associated with a love for colour, and it is in\r\nconsequence most reasonable to believe that a larger proportion of\r\ncolour-blind men would have been found among them than among the\r\nrest of the population.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: _Trans. Ophthalmological Soc_., 1881, p. 198.]\r\n\r\nAgain, Quakerism is a decreasing sect, weakened by yearly desertions\r\nand losses, especially as the act of marriage with a person who is\r\nnot a member of the Society is necessarily followed by exclusion\r\nfrom it. It is most probable that a large proportion of the\r\ndeserters would be those who, through reversion to some bygone\r\nancestor, had sufficient artistic taste to make a continuance of\r\nQuaker practices too irksome to be endured. Hence the existing\r\nmembers of the Society of Friends are a race who probably contained\r\nin the first instance an unduly large proportion of colour-blind men,\r\nand from whose descendants many of those who were not born colour\r\nblind have year by year been drafted away. Both causes must have\r\ncombined with the already well-known tendency of colour blindness to\r\nhereditary transmission, to cause it to become a characteristic of\r\ntheir race. Dalton, who first discovered its existence, as a\r\npersonal peculiarity of his own, was a Quaker to his death; Young,\r\nthe discoverer of the undulatory theory of light, and who wrote\r\nspecially on colours, was a Quaker by birth, but he married outside\r\nthe body and so ceased to belong to it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSTATISTICAL METHODS.\r\n\r\nThe object of statistical science is to discover methods of\r\ncondensing information concerning large groups of allied facts into\r\nbrief and compendious expressions suitable for discussion. The\r\npossibility of doing this is based on the constancy and continuity\r\nwith which objects of the same species are found to vary. That is to\r\nsay, we always find, after sorting any large number of such objects\r\nin the order (let us suppose) of their lengths, beginning with the\r\nshortest and ending with the tallest, and setting them side by side\r\nlike a long row of park palings between the same limits, their upper\r\noutline will be identical. Moreover, it will run smoothly and not in\r\nirregular steps. The theoretical interpretation of the smoothness of\r\noutline is that the individual differences in the objects are caused\r\nby different combinations of a large number of minute influences; and\r\nas the difference between any two adjacent objects in a long row\r\nmust depend on the absence in one of them of some single influence,\r\nor of only a few such, that were present in the other, the amount of\r\ndifference will be insensible. Whenever we find on trial that the\r\noutline of the row is not a flowing curve, the presumption is that\r\nthe objects are not all of the same species, but that part are\r\naffected by some large influence from which the others are free;\r\nconsequently there is a confusion of curves. This presumption is\r\nnever found to be belied.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunate for the peace of mind of the statistician that the\r\ninfluences by which the magnitudes, etc., of the objects are\r\ndetermined can seldom if ever be roundly classed into large and small,\r\nwithout intermediates. He is tantalised by the hope of getting hold\r\nof sub-groups of sufficient size that shall contain no individuals\r\nexcept those belonging strictly to the same species, and he is almost\r\nconstantly baffled. In the end he is obliged to exercise his\r\njudgment as to the limit at which he should cease to subdivide. If\r\nhe subdivides very frequently, the groups become too small to have\r\nstatistical value; if less frequently, the groups will be less truly\r\nspecific.\r\n\r\nA species may be defined as a group of objects whose individual\r\ndifferences are wholly due to different combinations of the same set\r\nof minute causes, no one of which is so powerful as to be able by\r\nitself to make any sensible difference in the result. A well-known\r\nmathematical consequence flows from this, which is also universally\r\nobserved as a fact, namely, that in all species the number of\r\nindividuals who differ from the average value, up to any given amount,\r\nis much greater than the number who differ more than that amount,\r\nand up to the double of it. In short, if an assorted series be\r\nrepresented by upright lines arranged side by side along a\r\nhorizontal base at equal distances apart, and of lengths\r\nproportionate to the magnitude of the quality in the corresponding\r\nobjects, then their shape will always resemble that shown in Fig. 1.\r\n\r\nThe form of the bounding curve resembles that which is called in\r\narchitectural language an ogive, from \"augive,\" an old French word\r\nfor a cup, the figure being not unlike the upper half of a cup lying\r\nsideways with its axis horizontal. In consequence of the multitude\r\nof mediocre values, we always find that on either side of the\r\nmiddlemost ordinate _Cc_, which is the median value and may be\r\naccepted as the average, there is a much less rapid change of height\r\nthan elsewhere. If the figure were pulled out sideways to make it\r\naccord with such physical conceptions as that of a row of men\r\nstanding side by side, the middle part of the curve would be\r\napparently horizontal.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\nThe mathematical conception of the curve is best expressed in Fig. 2,\r\nwhere PQ represents any given deviation from the average value, and\r\nthe ratio of PO to AB represents the relative probability of its\r\noccurrence. The equation to the curve and a discussion of its\r\nproperties will be found in the _Proceedings of the Royal Society_,\r\nNo. 198, 1879, by Dr. M'Alister. The title of the paper is the\r\n\"Law of the Geometric Mean,\" and it follows one by myself on\r\n\"The Geometric Mean in Vital and Social Statistics.\"\r\n\r\nWe can lay down the ogive of any quality, physical or mental,\r\nwhenever we are capable of judging which of any two members of the\r\ngroup we are engaged upon has the larger amount of that quality. I\r\nhave called this the method of statistics by intercomparison. There\r\nis no bodily or mental attribute in any race of individuals that can\r\nbe so dealt with, whether our judgment in comparing them be guided\r\nby common-sense observation or by actual measurement, which cannot\r\nbe gripped and consolidated into an ogive with a smooth outline, and\r\nthenceforward be treated in discussion as a single object.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to describe any given ogive which has been based upon\r\nmeasurements, so that it may be drawn from the description with\r\napproximate truth. Divide AB into a convenient number of fractional\r\nparts, and record the height of the ordinates at those parts. In\r\nreproducing the ogive from these data, draw a base line of any\r\nconvenient length, divide it in the same number of fractional parts,\r\nerect ordinates of the stated lengths at those parts, connect their\r\ntops with a flowing line, and the thing is done. The most convenient\r\nfractional parts are the middle (giving the median), the outside\r\nquarters (giving the upper and lower quartiles), and similarly the\r\nupper and lower octiles or deciles. This is sufficient for most\r\npurposes. It leaves only the outer eighths or tenths of the cases\r\nundescribed and undetermined, except so far as may be guessed by,\r\nthe run of the intermediate portion of the curve, and it defines all\r\nof the intermediate portion with as close an, approximation as is\r\nneeded for ordinary or statistical purposes.\r\n\r\nThus the heights of all but the outer tenths of the whole body of\r\nadult males of the English professional classes may be derived from\r\nthe five following ordinates, measured in inches, of which the outer\r\npair are deciles:--\r\n\r\n    67.2; 67.5; 68.8; 70.3; 71.4.\r\n\r\nMany other instances will be found in the Report of the\r\nAnthropometric Committee of the British Association in 1881,\r\npp. 245-257.\r\n\r\nWhen we desire to compare any two large statistical groups, we may\r\ncompare median with median, quartiles with quartiles, and octiles\r\nwith octiles; or we may proceed on the method to be described in the\r\nnext paragraph but one.\r\n\r\nWe are often called upon to define the position of an individual in\r\nhis own series, in which case it is most conformable to usage to\r\ngive his centesimal grade--that is, his place on the base line\r\nAB--supposing it to be graduated from 0° to 100°. In reckoning this,\r\na confusion ought to be avoided between \"graduation\" and \"rank,\"\r\nthough it leads to no sensible error in practice. The first of the\r\n\"park palings\" does not stand at A, which is 0°, nor does the\r\nhundredth stand at B, which is 100°, for that would make 101 of them:\r\nbut they stand at 0°.5 and 99°.5 respectively. Similarly, all\r\nintermediate _ranks_ stand half a degree short of the _graduation_\r\nbearing the same number. When the class is large, the value of half\r\na place becomes extremely small, and the rank and graduation may be\r\ntreated as identical.\r\n\r\nExamples of method of calculating a centesimal position:--\r\n\r\n1. A child A is classed after examination as No. 5 in a class of 27\r\nchildren; what is his centesimal graduation?\r\n\r\n_Answer_.--If AB be divided into 27 graduations, his rank of No. 5\r\nwill correspond to the graduation 4°.5; therefore if AB be graduated\r\nafresh into 100 graduations, his centesimal grade, x, will be found\r\nby the Rule of Three, thus--\r\n\r\nx : 4°.5 :: 100:27; x = 450°/27 = 16°.6.\r\n\r\n2. Another child B is classed No. 13 in a class of 25 _Answer_.--If\r\nAB be divided into 25 graduations, the rank of No. 13 will\r\ncorrespond to graduation 12°.5, whence as before--\r\n\r\nx : 12°.5 :: 100 : 25; x = 1250°/25 = 50°; _i.e._ B is the median.\r\n\r\nThe second method of comparing two statistical groups, to which I\r\nalluded in the last paragraph but one, consists in stating the\r\ncentesimal grade in the one group that corresponds with the median\r\nor any other fractional grade in the other. This, it will be remarked,\r\nis a very simple method of comparison, absolutely independent of any\r\ntheory, and applicable to any statistical groups whatever, whether of\r\nphysical or of mental qualities. Wherever we can sort in order,\r\nthere we can apply this method. Thus, in the above examples, suppose\r\nA and B had been selected because they were equal when compared\r\ntogether, then we can concisely express the relative merits of the\r\ntwo classes to which they respectively belong, by saying that 16°.6\r\nin the one is equal to 50° (the median) in the other.\r\n\r\nI frequently make statistical records of form and feature, in the\r\nstreets or in company, without exciting attention, by means of a\r\nfine pricker and a piece of paper. The pricker is a converted silver\r\npencil-case, with the usual sliding piece; it is a very small one,\r\nand is attached to my watch chain. The pencil part has been taken\r\nout and replaced by a fine short needle, the open mouth of the case\r\nis covered with a hemispherical cap having a hole in the centre, and\r\nthe adjustments are such that when the slide is pushed forward as\r\nfar as it can go, the needle projects no more than one-tenth of an\r\ninch. If I then press it upon a piece of paper, held against the\r\nball of my thumb, the paper is indelibly perforated with a fine hole,\r\nand the thumb is not wounded. The perforations will not be found to\r\nrun into one another unless they are very numerous, and if they\r\nhappen to do so now and then, it is of little consequence in a\r\nstatistical inquiry. The holes are easily counted at leisure, by\r\nholding the paper against the light, and any scrap of paper will\r\nserve the purpose. It will be found that the majority of inquiries\r\ntake the form of \"more,\" \"equal to,\" or \"less,\" so I arrange the\r\npaper in a way to present three distinct compartments to the pricker,\r\nand to permit of its being held in the correct position and used by\r\nthe sense of touch alone. I do so by tearing the paper into the form\r\nof a cross--that is, maimed in one of its arms--and hold it by the\r\nmaimed part between the thumb and finger, the head of the cross\r\npointing upward. The head of the cross receives the pricks referring\r\nto \"more\"; the solitary arm that is not maimed, those meaning\r\n\"the same\"; the long foot of the cross those meaning \"less.\" It is\r\nwell to write the subject of the measurement on the paper before\r\nbeginning to use it, then more than one set of records can be kept\r\nin the pocket at the same time, and be severally added to as occasion\r\nserves, without fear of mistaking one for the other.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHARACTER.\r\n\r\nThe fundamental and intrinsic differences of character that exist in\r\nindividuals are well illustrated by those that distinguish the two\r\nsexes, and which begin to assert themselves even in the nursery,\r\nwhere all the children are treated alike. One notable peculiarity in\r\nthe character of the woman is that she is capricious and coy, and\r\nhas less straightforwardness than the man. It is the same in the\r\nfemale of every sex about the time of pairing, and there can be\r\nlittle doubt as to the origin of the peculiarity. If any race of\r\nanimals existed in whom the sexual passions of the female were as\r\nquickly and as directly stirred as those of the male, each would\r\nmate with the first who approached her, and one essential condition\r\nof sexual selection would be absent. There would be no more call for\r\ncompetition among the males for the favour of each female; no more\r\nfighting for love, in which the strongest male conquers; no more\r\nrival display of personal charms, in which the best-looking or\r\nbest-mannered prevails. The drama of courtship, with its prolonged\r\nstrivings and doubtful success, would be cut quite short, and the\r\nrace would degenerate through the absence of that sexual selection\r\nfor which the protracted preliminaries of love-making give\r\nopportunity. The willy-nilly disposition of the female in matters of\r\nlove is as apparent in the butterfly as in the man, and must have\r\nbeen continuously favoured from the earliest stages of animal\r\nevolution down to the present time. It is the factor in the great\r\ntheory of sexual selection that corresponds to the insistence and\r\ndirectness of the male. Coyness and caprice have in consequence\r\nbecome a heritage of the sex, together with a cohort of allied\r\nweaknesses and petty deceits, that men have come to think venial and\r\neven amiable in women, but which they would not tolerate among\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nVarious forms of natural character and temperament would no doubt be\r\nfound to occur in constant proportions among any large group of\r\npersons of the same race, but what those proportions may be has\r\nnever yet been investigated. It is extremely difficult to estimate\r\nit by observations of adults, owing to their habit of restraining\r\nnatural ill tendencies, and to their long-practised concealment of\r\nthose they do not restrain but desire to hide. The necessary\r\nobservations ought, however, to be easily made on young children in\r\nschools, whose manifestations of character are conspicuous, who are\r\nsimultaneously for months and years under the eye of the same master\r\nor mistress, and who are daily classed according to their various\r\nmerits. I have occasionally asked the opinion of persons well\r\nqualified to form them, and who have had experience of teaching, as\r\nto the most obvious divisions of character to be found among school\r\nchildren. The replies have differed, but those on which most stress\r\nwas laid were connected with energy, sociability, desire to attract\r\nnotice, truthfulness, thoroughness, and refinement.\r\n\r\nThe varieties of the emotional constitution and of likings and\r\nantipathies are very numerous and wide. I may give two instances\r\nwhich I have not seen elsewhere alluded to, merely as examples of\r\nvariation. One of them was often brought to my notice at the time\r\nwhen the public were admitted to see the snakes fed at the\r\nZoological Gardens. Rabbits, birds, and other small animals were\r\ndropped in the different cages, which the snakes, after more or less\r\nserpentine action, finally struck with their poison fangs or crushed\r\nin their folds. I found it a horrible but a fascinating scene. We\r\nlead for the most part such an easy and carpeted existence, screened\r\nfrom the stern realities of life and death, that many of us are\r\nimpelled to draw aside the curtain now and then, and gaze for a\r\nwhile behind it. This exhibition of the snakes at their feeding-time,\r\nwhich gave to me, as it doubtless did to several others, a sense of\r\ncurdling of the blood, had no such effect on many of the visitors. I\r\nhave often seen people--nurses, for instance, and children of all\r\nages--looking unconcernedly and amusedly at the scene. Their\r\nindifference was perhaps the most painful element of the whole\r\ntransaction. Their sympathies were absolutely unawakened. I quote\r\nthis instance, partly because it leads to another very curious fact\r\nthat I have noticed as regards the way with which different persons\r\nand races regard snakes. I myself have a horror of them, and can\r\nonly by great self-control, and under a sense of real agitation,\r\nforce myself to touch one. A considerable proportion of the English\r\nrace would feel much as I do; but the remainder do not. I have\r\nquestioned numbers of persons of both sexes, and have been\r\nastonished at the frequency with which I have been assured that they\r\nhad no shrinking whatever from the sight of the wriggling mysterious\r\nreptile. Some persons, as is well known, make pets of them; moreover,\r\nI am told that there is no passage in Greek or Latin authors\r\nexpressive of that form of horror which I myself feel, and which may\r\nbe compared to what is said to be felt by hydrophobic sufferers at\r\nthe undulating movements of water. There are numerous allusions in\r\nthe classics to the venom fang or the crushing power of snakes, but\r\nnot to an aversion inspired by its form and movement. It was the\r\nGreek symbol of Hippocrates and of healing. There is nothing of the\r\nkind in Hebrew literature, where the snake is figured as an\r\nattractive tempter. In Hindu fables the cobra is the ingenious and\r\nintelligent animal, corresponding to the fox in ours. Serpent worship\r\nwas very widely spread. I therefore doubt whether the antipathy to\r\nthe snake is very common among mankind, notwithstanding the\r\ninstinctive terror that their sight inspires in monkeys.\r\n\r\nThe other instance I may adduce is that of the horror of blood which\r\nis curiously different in animals of the same species and in the\r\nsame animals at different times. I have had a good deal of\r\nexperience of the behaviour of oxen at the sight of blood, and found\r\nit to be by no means uniform. In my South African travels I relied\r\nchiefly on half-wild slaughter oxen to feed my large party, and\r\noccasionally had to shoot one on every second day. Usually the rest\r\nof the drove paid no particular heed to the place of blood, but at\r\nother rare times they seemed maddened and performed a curious sort\r\nof war-dance at the spot, making buck-leaps, brandishing their horns,\r\nand goring at the ground. It was a grotesque proceeding, utterly\r\nunlike the usual behaviour of cattle. I only witnessed it once\r\nelsewhere, and that was in the Pyrenees, where I came on a herd that\r\nwas being driven homewards. Each cow in turn, as it passed a\r\nparticular spot, performed the well-remembered antics. I asked, and\r\nlearned that a cow had been killed there by a bear a few days\r\npreviously. The natural horror at blood, and it may be the\r\nconsequent dislike of red, is common among mankind; but I have seen\r\na well-dressed child of about four years old poking its finger with\r\na pleased innocent look into the bleeding carcase of a sheep hung up\r\nin a butcher's shop, while its nurse was inside.\r\n\r\nThe subject of character deserves more statistical investigation\r\nthan it has yet received, and none have a better chance of doing it\r\nwell than schoolmasters; their opportunities are indeed most enviable.\r\nIt would be necessary to approach the subject wholly without\r\nprejudice, as a pure matter of observation, just as if the children\r\nwere the fauna and flora of hitherto undescribed species in an\r\nentirely new land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCRIMINALS AND THE INSANE.\r\n\r\nCriminality, though not very various in its development, is\r\nextremely complex in its origin; nevertheless certain general\r\nconclusions are arrived at by the best writers on the subject, among\r\nwhom Prosper Despine is one of the most instructive. The ideal\r\ncriminal has marked peculiarities of character: his conscience is\r\nalmost deficient, his instincts are vicious, his power of\r\nself-control is very weak, and he usually detests continuous labour.\r\nThe absence of self-control is due to ungovernable temper, to passion,\r\nor to mere imbecility, and the conditions that determine the\r\nparticular description of crime are the character of the instincts\r\nand of the temptation.\r\n\r\nThe deficiency of conscience in criminals, as shown by the absence\r\nof genuine remorse for their guilt, astonishes all who first become\r\nfamiliar with the details of prison life. Scenes of heartrending\r\ndespair are hardly ever witnessed among prisoners; their sleep is\r\nbroken by no uneasy dreams--on the contrary, it is easy and sound;\r\nthey have also excellent appetites. But hypocrisy is a very common\r\nvice; and all my information agrees as to the utter untruthfulness\r\nof criminals, however plausible their statements may be.\r\n\r\nWe must guard ourselves against looking upon vicious instincts as\r\nperversions, inasmuch as they may be strictly in accordance with the\r\nhealthy nature of the man, and, being transmissible by inheritance,\r\nmay become the normal characteristics of a healthy race, just as the\r\nsheep-dog, the retriever, the pointer, and the bull-dog, have their\r\nseveral instincts. There can be no greater popular error than the\r\nsupposition that natural instinct is a perfectly trustworthy guide,\r\nfor there are striking contradictions to such an opinion in\r\nindividuals of every description of animal. The most that we are\r\nentitled to say in any case is, that the prevalent instincts of each\r\nrace are trustworthy, not those of every individual. But even this\r\nis saying too much, because when the conditions under which the race\r\nis living have recently been changed, some instincts which were\r\nadapted to the old state of things are sure to be fallacious guides\r\nto conduct in the new one. A man who is counted as an atrocious\r\ncriminal in England, and is punished as such by English law in social\r\nself-defence, may nevertheless have acted in strict accordance with\r\ninstincts that are laudable in less civilised societies. The ideal\r\ncriminal is, unhappily for him, deficient in qualities that are\r\ncapable of restraining his unkindly or inconvenient instincts; he\r\nhas neither sympathy for others nor the sense of duty, both of which\r\nlie at the base of conscience; nor has he sufficient self-control to\r\naccommodate himself to the society in which he has to live, and so to\r\npromote his own selfish interests in the long-run. He cannot be\r\npreserved from criminal misadventure, either by altruistic\r\nsentiments or by intelligently egoistic ones.\r\n\r\nThe perpetuation of the criminal class by heredity is a question\r\ndifficult to grapple with on many accounts. Their vagrant habits,\r\ntheir illegitimate unions, and extreme untruthfulness, are among the\r\ndifficulties of the investigation. It is, however, easy to show that\r\nthe criminal nature tends to be inherited; while, on the other hand,\r\nit is impossible that women who spend a large portion of the best\r\nyears of their life in prison can contribute many children to the\r\npopulation. The true state of the case appears to be that the\r\ncriminal population receives steady accessions from those who,\r\nwithout having strongly-marked criminal natures, do nevertheless\r\nbelong to a type of humanity that is exceedingly ill suited to play\r\na respectable part in our modern civilisation, though it is well\r\nsuited to flourish under half-savage conditions, being naturally\r\nboth healthy and prolific. These persons are apt to go to the bad;\r\ntheir daughters consort with criminals and become the parents of\r\ncriminals. An extraordinary example of this is afforded by the\r\nhistory of the infamous Jukes family in America, whose pedigree has\r\nbeen made out, with extraordinary care, during no less than seven\r\ngenerations, and is the subject of an elaborate memoir printed in\r\nthe Thirty-first Annual Report of the Prison Association of New York,\r\n1876. It includes no less than 540 individuals of Jukes blood, of\r\nwhom a frightful number degraded into criminality, pauperism, or\r\ndisease.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to summarise the results in a few plain figures, but\r\nI will state those respecting the fifth generation, through the\r\neldest of the five prolific daughters of the man who is the common\r\nancestor of the race. The total number of these was 123, of whom\r\nthirty-eight came through an illegitimate granddaughter, and\r\neighty-five through legitimate grandchildren. Out of the thirty-eight,\r\nsixteen have been in jail, six of them for heinous offences, one of\r\nthese having been committed no less than nine times; eleven others\r\nled openly disreputable lives or were paupers; four were notoriously\r\nintemperate; the history of three had not been traced, and only four\r\nare known to have done well. The great majority of the women\r\nconsorted with criminals. As to the eighty-five legitimate\r\ndescendants, they were less flagrantly bad, for only five of them\r\nhad been in jail, and only thirteen others had been paupers. Now the\r\nancestor of all this mischief, who was born about the year 1730, is\r\ndescribed as having been a jolly companionable man, a hunter, and a\r\nfisher, averse to steady labour, but working hard and idling by turns,\r\nand who had numerous illegitimate children, whose issue has not been\r\ntraced. He was, in fact, a somewhat good specimen of a half-savage,\r\nwithout any seriously criminal instincts. The girls were apparently\r\nattractive, marrying early and sometimes not badly; but the\r\ngipsy-like character of the race was unsuited to success in a\r\ncivilised country. So the descendants went to the bad, and such\r\nhereditary moral weaknesses as they may have had, rose to the\r\nsurface and worked their mischief without check. Cohabiting with\r\ncriminals, and being extremely prolific, the result was the\r\nproduction of a stock exceeding 500 in number, of a prevalent\r\ncriminal type. Through disease and intemperance the breed is now\r\nrapidly diminishing; the infant mortality has of late been horrible,\r\nbut fortunately the women of the present generation bear usually but\r\nfew children, and many of them are altogether childless.\r\n\r\nThe criminal classes contain a considerable portion of epileptics\r\nand other persons of instable, emotional temperament, subject to\r\nnervous explosions that burst out at intervals and relieve the system.\r\nThe mad outbreaks of women in convict prisons is a most curious\r\nphenomenon. Some of them are apt from time to time to have a\r\ngradually increasing desire that at last becomes irresistible, to\r\n\"break out,\" as it is technically called; that is, to smash and tear\r\neverything they can within reach, and to shriek, curse, and howl. At\r\nlength the fit expends itself; the devil, as it were, leaves them,\r\nand they begin to behave again in their ordinary way. The highest\r\nform of emotional instability exists in confirmed epilepsy, where\r\nits manifestations have often been studied; it is found in a high\r\nbut somewhat less extraordinary degree in the hysterical and allied\r\naffections. In the confirmed epileptic constitution the signs of\r\ngeneral instability of nervous action are muscular convulsions,\r\nirregularities of bodily temperature, mobile intellectual activity,\r\nand extraordinary oscillations between opposed emotional states. I\r\nam assured by excellent authority that instable manifestations of\r\nextreme piety and of extreme vice are almost invariably shown by\r\nepileptics, and should be regarded as a prominent feature of their\r\npeculiar constitution. These unfortunate beings see no incongruity\r\nbetween the pious phrases that they pour out at one moment and their\r\nvile and obscene language in the next; neither do they show\r\nrepentance for past misconduct when they are convicted of crimes,\r\nhowever abominable these may be. They are creatures of the moment,\r\npossessing no inhibitory check upon their desires and emotions, which\r\ndrive them headlong hither and thither.\r\n\r\nMadness is often associated with epilepsy; in all cases it is a\r\nfrightful and hereditary disfigurement of humanity, which appears,\r\nfrom the upshot of various conflicting accounts, to be on the\r\nincrease. The neurotic constitution from which it springs is however\r\nnot without its merits, as has been well pointed out, since a large\r\nproportion of the enthusiastic men and women to whose labour the\r\nworld is largely indebted, have had that constitution, judging from\r\nthe fact that insanity existed in their families.\r\n\r\nThe phases of extreme piety and extreme vice which so rapidly\r\nsucceed one another in the same individual among the epileptics, are\r\nmore widely separated among those who are simply insane. It has been\r\nnoticed that among the morbid organic conditions which accompany the\r\nshow of excessive piety and religious rapture in the insane, none are\r\nso frequent as disorders of the sexual organisation. Conversely, the\r\nfrenzies of religious revivals have not unfrequently ended in gross\r\nprofligacy. The encouragement of celibacy by the fervent leaders of\r\nmost creeds, utilises in an unconscious way the morbid connection\r\nbetween an over-restraint of the sexual desires and impulses towards\r\nextreme devotion.\r\n\r\nAnother remarkable phase among the insane consists in strange views\r\nabout their individuality. They think that their body is made of\r\nglass, or that their brains have literally disappeared, or that\r\nthere are different persons inside them, or that they are somebody\r\nelse, and so forth. It is said that this phase is most commonly\r\nassociated with morbid disturbance of the alimentary organs. So in\r\nmany religions fasting has been used as an agent for detaching the\r\nthoughts from the body and for inducing ecstasy.\r\n\r\nThere is yet a third peculiarity of the insane which is almost\r\nuniversal, that of gloomy segregation. Passengers nearing London by\r\nthe Great Western Railway must have frequently remarked the unusual\r\nappearance of the crowd of lunatics when taking their exercise in\r\nthe large green enclosure in front of Hanwell Asylum. They almost\r\nwithout exception walk apart in moody isolation, each in his own way,\r\nburied in his own thoughts. It is a scene like that fabled in\r\nVathek's hall of Eblis. I am assured that whenever two are seen in\r\ncompany, it is either because their attacks of madness are of an\r\nintermittent and epileptic character and they are temporarily sane,\r\nor otherwise that they are near recovery. Conversely, the curative\r\ninfluence of social habits is fully recognised, and they are promoted\r\nby festivities in the asylums. On the other hand, the great teachers\r\nof all creeds have made seclusion a prominent religious exercise. In\r\nshort, by enforcing celibacy, fasting, and solitude, they have done\r\ntheir best towards making men mad, and they have always largely\r\nsucceeded in inducing morbid mental conditions among their followers.\r\n\r\nFloods of light are thrown upon various incidents of devotee life,\r\nand also upon the disgusting and not otherwise intelligible\r\ncharacter of the sanctimonious scoundrel, by the everyday\r\nexperiences of the madhouse. No professor of metaphysics, psychology,\r\nor religion can claim to know the elements of what he teaches,\r\nunless he is acquainted with the ordinary phenomena of idiocy,\r\nmadness, and epilepsy. He must study the manifestations of disease\r\nand congenital folly, as well as those of sanity and high intellect.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGREGARIOUS AND SLAVISH INSTINCTS.\r\n\r\nI propose in this chapter to discuss a curious and apparently\r\nanomalous group of base moral instincts and intellectual deficiencies,\r\nthat are innate rather than acquired, by tracing their analogies in\r\nthe world of brutes and examining the conditions through which they\r\nhave been evolved. They are the slavish aptitudes from which the\r\nleaders of men are exempt, but which are characteristic elements in\r\nthe disposition of ordinary persons. The vast majority of persons of\r\nour race have a natural tendency to shrink from the responsibility\r\nof standing and acting alone; they exalt the _vox populi_, even when\r\nthey know it to be the utterance of a mob of nobodies, into the\r\n_vox Dei_, and they are willing slaves to tradition, authority,\r\nand custom. The intellectual deficiencies corresponding to these\r\nmoral flaws are shown by the rareness of free and original thought as\r\ncompared with the frequency and readiness with which men accept the\r\nopinions of those in authority as binding on their judgment. I shall\r\nendeavour to prove that the slavish aptitudes in man are a direct\r\nconsequence of his gregarious nature, which itself is a result of\r\nthe conditions both of his primeval barbarism and of the forms of\r\nhis subsequent civilisation. My argument will be, that gregarious\r\nbrute animals possess a want of self-reliance in a marked degree;\r\nthat the conditions of the lives of these animals have made a want\r\nof self-reliance a necessity to them, and that by the law of natural\r\nselection the gregarious instincts and their accompanying slavish\r\naptitudes have gradually become evolved. Then I shall argue that our\r\nremote ancestors have lived under parallel conditions, and that\r\nother causes peculiar to human society have acted up to the present\r\nday in the same direction, and that we have inherited the gregarious\r\ninstincts and slavish aptitudes which have been needed under past\r\ncircumstances, although in our advancing civilisation they are\r\nbecoming of more harm than good to our race.\r\n\r\nIt was my fortune, in earlier life, to gain an intimate knowledge of\r\ncertain classes of gregarious animals. The urgent need of the camel\r\nfor the close companionship of his fellows was a never-exhausted\r\ntopic of curious admiration to me during tedious days of travel\r\nacross many North African deserts. I also happened to hear and read\r\na great deal about the still more marked gregarious instincts of the\r\nllama; but the social animal into whose psychology I am conscious of\r\nhaving penetrated most thoroughly is the ox of the wild parts of\r\nwestern South Africa. It is necessary to insist upon the epithet\r\n\"wild,\" because an ox of tamed parentage has different natural\r\ninstincts; for instance, an English ox is far less gregarious than\r\nthose I am about to describe, and affords a proportionately less\r\nvaluable illustration to my argument. The oxen of which I speak\r\nbelonged to the Damaras, and none of the ancestry of these cattle\r\nhad ever been broken to harness. They were watched from a distance\r\nduring the day, as they roamed about the open country, and at night\r\nthey were driven with cries to enclosures, into which they rushed\r\nmuch like a body of terrified wild animals driven by huntsmen into a\r\ntrap. Their scared temper was such as to make it impossible to lay\r\nhold of them by other means than by driving the whole herd into a\r\nclump, and lassoing the leg of the animal it was desired to seize,\r\nand throwing him to the ground with dexterous force. With oxen and\r\ncows of this description, whose nature is no doubt shared by the\r\nbulls, I spent more than a year in the closest companionship.\r\n\r\nI had nearly a hundred of the beasts broken in for the waggon, for\r\npacks, and for the saddle. I travelled an entire journey of\r\nexploration on the back of one of them, with others by my side,\r\neither labouring at their tasks or walking at leisure; and with\r\nothers again who were wholly unbroken, and who served the purpose of\r\nan itinerant larder. At night, when there had been no time to erect\r\nan enclosure to hold them, I lay down in their midst, and it was\r\ninteresting to observe how readily they then availed themselves of\r\nthe neighbourhood of the camp fire and of man, conscious of the\r\nprotection they afforded from prowling carnivora, whose cries and\r\nroars, now distant, now near, continually broke upon the stillness.\r\nThese opportunities of studying the disposition of such peculiar\r\ncattle were not wasted upon me. I had only too much leisure to think\r\nabout them, and the habits of the animals strongly attracted my\r\ncuriosity. The better I understood them, the more complex and worthy\r\nof study did their minds appear to be. But I am now concerned only\r\nwith their blind gregarious instincts, which are conspicuously\r\ndistinct from the ordinary social desires. In the latter they are\r\ndeficient; thus they are not amiable to one another, but show on the\r\nwhole more expressions of spite and disgust than of forbearance or\r\nfondness. They do not suffer from an ennui, which society can remove,\r\nbecause their coarse feeding and their ruminant habits make them\r\nsomewhat stolid. Neither can they love society, as monkeys do, for\r\nthe opportunities it affords of a fuller and more varied life,\r\nbecause they remain self-absorbed in the middle of their herd, while\r\nthe monkeys revel together in frolics, scrambles, fights, loves, and\r\nchatterings. Yet although the ox has so little affection for, or\r\nindividual interest in, his fellows, he cannot endure even a\r\nmomentary severance from his herd. If he be separated from it by\r\nstratagem or force, he exhibits every sign of mental agony; he\r\nstrives with all his might to get back again, and when he succeeds,\r\nhe plunges into its middle to bathe his whole body with the comfort\r\nof closest companionship. This passionate terror at segregation is a\r\nconvenience to the herdsman, who may rest assured in the darkness or\r\nin the mist that the whole herd is safe whenever he can get a\r\nglimpse of a single ox. It is also the cause of great inconvenience\r\nto the traveller in ox-waggons, who constantly feels himself in a\r\nposition towards his oxen like that of a host to a company of\r\nbashful gentlemen at the time when he is trying to get them to move\r\nfrom the drawing-room to the dinner-table, and no one will go first,\r\nbut every one backs and gives place to his neighbour. The traveller\r\nfinds great difficulty in procuring animals capable of acting the\r\npart of fore-oxen to his team, the ordinary members of the wild herd\r\nbeing wholly unfitted by nature to move in so prominent and isolated\r\na position, even though, as is the custom, a boy is always in front\r\nto persuade or pull them onwards. Therefore, a good fore-ox is an\r\nanimal of an exceptionally independent disposition. Men who break in\r\nwild cattle for harness watch assiduously for those who show a\r\nself-reliant nature, by grazing apart or ahead of the rest, and\r\nthese they break in for fore-oxen. The other cattle may be\r\nindifferently devoted to ordinary harness purposes, or to slaughter;\r\nbut the born leaders are far too rare to be used for any less\r\ndistinguished service than that which they alone are capable of\r\nfulfilling. But a still more exceptional degree of merit may\r\nsometimes be met with among the many thousands of Damara cattle. It\r\nis possible to find an ox who may be ridden, not indeed as freely as\r\na horse, for I have never heard of a feat like that, but at all\r\nevents wholly apart from the companionship of others; and an\r\naccomplished rider will even succeed in urging him out at a trot\r\nfrom the very middle of his fellows. With respect to the negative\r\nside of the scale, though I do not recollect definite instances, I\r\ncan recall general impressions of oxen showing a deficiency from the\r\naverage ox standard of self-reliance, about equal to the excess of\r\nthat quality found in ordinary fore-oxen. Thus I recollect there\r\nwere some cattle of a peculiarly centripetal instinct, who ran more\r\nmadly than the rest into the middle of the herd when they were\r\nfrightened; and I have no reason to doubt from general recollections\r\nthat the law of deviation from an average would be as applicable to\r\nindependence of character among cattle as one might expect it\r\ntheoretically to be. The conclusion to which we are driven is, that\r\nfew of the Damara cattle have enough originality and independence of\r\ndisposition to pass unaided through their daily risks in a tolerably\r\ncomfortable manner. They are essentially slavish, and seek no better\r\nlot than to be led by any one of their number who has enough\r\nself-reliance to accept that position. No ox ever dares to act\r\ncontrary to the rest of the herd, but he accepts their common\r\ndetermination as an authority binding on his conscience.\r\n\r\nAn incapacity of relying on oneself and a faith in others are\r\nprecisely the conditions that compel brutes to congregate and live\r\nin herds; and, again, it is essential to their safety in a country\r\ninfested by large carnivora, that they should keep closely together\r\nin herds. No ox grazing alone could live for many days unless he\r\nwere protected, far more assiduously and closely than is possible to\r\nbarbarians. The Damara owners confide perhaps 200 cattle to a couple\r\nof half-starved youths, who pass their time in dozing or in grubbing\r\nup roots to eat. The owners know that it is hopeless to protect the\r\nherd from lions, so they leave it to take its chance; and as regards\r\nhuman marauders they equally know that the largest number of cattle\r\nwatchers they could spare could make no adequate resistance to an\r\nattack; they therefore do not send more than two, who are enough to\r\nrun home and give the alarm to the whole male population of the\r\ntribe to run in arms on the tracks of their plundered property.\r\nConsequently, as I began by saying, the cattle have to take care of\r\nthemselves against the wild beasts, and they would infallibly be\r\ndestroyed by them if they had not safeguards of their own, which are\r\nnot easily to be appreciated at first sight at their full value. We\r\nshall understand them better by considering the precise nature of\r\nthe danger that an ox runs. When he is alone it is not simply that he\r\nis too defenceless, but that he is easily surprised. A crouching\r\nlion fears cattle who turn boldly upon him, and he does so with\r\nreason. The horns of an ox or antelope are able to make an ugly\r\nwound in the paw or chest of a springing beast when he receives its\r\nthrust in the same way that an over-eager pugilist meets his\r\nadversary's \"counter\" hit. Hence it is that a cow who has calved by\r\nthe wayside, and has been temporarily abandoned by the caravan, is\r\nnever seized by lions. The incident frequently occurs, and as\r\nfrequently are the cow and calf eventually brought safe to the camp;\r\nand yet there is usually evidence in footprints of her having\r\nsustained a regular siege from the wild beasts; but she is so\r\nrestless and eager for the safety of her young that no beast of prey\r\ncan approach her unawares. This state of exaltation is of course\r\nexceptional; cattle are obliged in their ordinary course of life to\r\nspend a considerable part of the day with their heads buried in the\r\ngrass, where they can neither see nor smell what is about them. A\r\nstill larger part of their time must be spent in placid rumination,\r\nduring which they cannot possibly be on the alert. But a herd of\r\nsuch animals, when considered as a whole, is always on the alert; at\r\nalmost every moment some eyes, ears, and noses will command all\r\napproaches, and the start or cry of alarm of a single beast is a\r\nsignal to all his companions. To live gregariously is to become a\r\nfibre in a vast sentient web overspreading many acres; it is to\r\nbecome the possessor of faculties always awake, of eyes that see in\r\nall directions, of ears and nostrils that explore a broad belt of air;\r\nit is also to become the occupier of every bit of vantage ground\r\nwhence the approach of a wild beast might be overlooked. The\r\nprotective senses of each individual who chooses to live in\r\ncompanionship are multiplied by a large factor, and he thereby\r\nreceives a maximum of security at a minimum cost of restlessness.\r\nWhen we isolate an animal who has been accustomed to a gregarious\r\nlife, we take away his sense of protection, for he feels himself\r\nexposed to danger from every part of the circle around him, except\r\nthe one point on which his attention is momentarily fixed; and he\r\nknows that disaster may easily creep up to him from behind.\r\nConsequently his glance is restless and anxious, and is turned in\r\nsuccession to different quarters; his movements are hurried and\r\nagitated, and he becomes a prey to the extremest terror. There can\r\nbe no room for doubt that it is suitable to the well-being of cattle\r\nin a country infested with beasts of prey to live in close\r\ncompanionship, and being suitable, it follows from the law of\r\nnatural selection that the development of gregarious and therefore\r\nof slavish instincts must be favoured in such cattle. It also\r\nfollows from the same law that the degree in which those instincts\r\nare developed is on the whole the most conducive to their safety. If\r\nthey were more gregarious they would crowd so closely as to\r\ninterfere with each other when grazing the scattered pasture of\r\nDamara land; if less gregarious, they would be too widely scattered\r\nto keep a sufficient watch against the wild beasts.\r\n\r\nI now proceed to consider more particularly why the range of\r\ndeviation from the average is such that we find about one ox out of\r\nfifty to possess sufficient independence of character to serve as a\r\npretty good fore-ox. Why is it not one in five or one in five hundred?\r\nThe reason undoubtedly is that natural selection tends to give but\r\none leader to each suitably-sized herd, and to repress superabundant\r\nleaders. There is a certain size of herd most suitable to the\r\ngeographical and other conditions of the country; it must not\r\nbe too large, or the scattered puddles which form their only\r\nwatering-places for a great part of the year would not suffice; and\r\nthere are similar drawbacks in respect to pasture. It must not be\r\ntoo small, or it would be comparatively insecure; thus a troop of\r\nfive animals is far more easy to be approached by a stalking\r\nhuntsman than one of twenty, and the latter than one of a hundred. We\r\nhave seen that it is the oxen who graze apart, as well as those who\r\nlead the herd, who are recognised by the trainers of cattle as\r\ngifted with enough independence of character to become fore-oxen.\r\nThey are even preferred to the actual leaders of the herd; they dare\r\nto move more alone, and therefore their independence is undoubted.\r\nThe leaders are safe enough from lions, because their flanks and rear\r\nare guarded by their followers; but each of those who graze apart,\r\nand who represent the superabundant supply of self-reliant animals,\r\nhave one flank and the rear exposed, and it is precisely these whom\r\nthe lions take. Looking at the matter in a broad way, we may justly\r\nassert that wild beasts trim and prune every herd into compactness,\r\nand tend to reduce it into a closely-united body with a single\r\nwell-protected leader. That the development of independence of\r\ncharacter in cattle is thus suppressed below its otherwise natural\r\nstandard by the influence of wild beasts, is shown by the greater\r\ndisplay of self-reliance among cattle whose ancestry for some\r\ngenerations have not been exposed to such danger.\r\n\r\nWhat has been said about cattle, in relation to wild beasts, applies\r\nwith more or less obvious modifications to barbarians in relation to\r\ntheir neighbours, but I insist on a close resemblance in the\r\nparticular circumstance, that many savages are so unamiable and\r\nmorose as to have hardly any object in associating together, besides\r\nthat of mutual support. If we look at the inhabitants of the very\r\nsame country as the oxen I have described, we shall find them\r\ncongregated into multitudes of tribes, all more or less at war with\r\none another. We shall find that few of these tribes are very small,\r\nand few very large, and that it is precisely those that are\r\nexceptionally large or small whose condition is the least stable. A\r\nvery small tribe is sure to be overthrown, slaughtered, or driven\r\ninto slavery by its more powerful neighbour. A very large tribe\r\nfalls to pieces through its own unwieldiness, because, by the nature\r\nof things, it must be either deficient in centralisation or\r\nstraitened in food, or both. A barbarian population is obliged to\r\nlive dispersedly, since a square mile of land will support only a\r\nfew hunters or shepherds; on the other hand, a barbarian government\r\ncannot be long maintained unless the chief is brought into frequent\r\ncontact with his dependants, and this is geographically impossible\r\nwhen his tribe is so scattered as to cover a great extent of\r\nterritory. The law of selection must discourage every race of\r\nbarbarians which supplies self-reliant individuals in such large\r\nnumbers as to cause tribes of moderate size to lose their blind\r\ndesire of aggregation. It must equally discourage a breed that is\r\nincompetent to supply such men in sufficiently abundant ratio to the\r\nrest of the population to ensure the existence of tribes of not too\r\nlarge a size. It must not be supposed that gregarious instincts are\r\nequally important to all forms of savage life; but I hold, from what\r\nwe know of the clannish fighting habits of our forefathers, that\r\nthey were every whit as applicable to the earlier ancestors of our\r\nEuropean stock as they are still to a large part of the black\r\npopulation of Africa.\r\n\r\nThere is, moreover, an extraordinary power of tyranny invested in\r\nthe chiefs of tribes and nations of men, that so vastly outweighs\r\nthe analogous power possessed by the leaders of animal herds as to\r\nrank as a special attribute of human society, eminently conducive to\r\nslavishness. If any brute in a herd makes itself obnoxious to the\r\nleader, the leader attacks him, and there is a free fight between the\r\ntwo, the other animals looking on the while. But if a man makes\r\nhimself obnoxious to his chief, he is attacked, not by the chief\r\nsingle-handed, but by the overpowering force of his executive. The\r\nrebellious individual has to brave a disciplined host; there are\r\nspies who will report his doings, a local authority who will send a\r\ndetachment of soldiers to drag him to trial; there are prisons ready\r\nbuilt to hold him, civil authorities wielding legal powers of\r\nstripping him of all his possessions, and official executioners\r\nprepared to torture or kill him. The tyrannies under which men have\r\nlived, whether under rude barbarian chiefs, under the great\r\ndespotisms of half-civilised Oriental countries, or under some of\r\nthe more polished but little less severe governments of modern days,\r\nmust have had a frightful influence in eliminating independence of\r\ncharacter from the human race. Think of Austria, of Naples, and even\r\nof France under Napoleon III. It was stated[1] in 1870 that,\r\naccording to papers found at the Tuileries, 26,642 persons had been\r\narrested in France for political offences since 2nd December, 1851,\r\nand that 14,118 had been transported, exiled, or detained in prison.\r\n\r\nI have already spoken in _Hereditary Genius_ of the large effects of\r\nreligious persecution in comparatively recent years, on the natural\r\ncharacter of races, and shall not say more about it here; but it\r\nmust not be omitted from the list of steady influences continuing\r\nthrough ancient historical times down, in some degree, to the\r\npresent day, in destroying the self-reliant, and therefore the\r\nnobler races of men.\r\n\r\nI hold that the blind instincts evolved under these long-continued\r\nconditions have been ingrained into our breed, and that they are a\r\nbar to our enjoying the freedom which the forms of modern\r\ncivilisation are otherwise capable of giving us. A really\r\nintelligent nation might be held together by far stronger forces\r\nthan are derived from the purely gregarious instincts. A nation need\r\nnot be a mob of slaves, clinging to one another through fear, and\r\nfor the most part incapable of self-government, and begging to be led;\r\nbut it might consist of vigorous self-reliant men, knit to one\r\n[6] another by innumerable ties, into a strong, tense, and elastic\r\norganisation.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: _Daily News_, 17th October, 1870.]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe character of the corporate action of a nation in which each man\r\njudges for himself, might be expected to possess statistical\r\nconstancy. It would be the expression of the dominant character of a\r\nlarge number of separate members of the same race, and ought\r\ntherefore to be remarkably uniform. Fickleness of national character\r\nis principally due to the several members of the nation exercising\r\nno independent judgment, but allowing themselves to be led hither and\r\nthither by the successive journalists, orators, and sentimentalists\r\nwho happen for the time to have the chance of directing them.\r\n\r\nOur present natural dispositions make it impossible for us to attain\r\nthe ideal standard of a nation of men all judging soberly for\r\nthemselves, and therefore the slavishness of the mass of our\r\ncountrymen, in morals and intellect, must be an admitted fact in all\r\nschemes of regenerative policy.\r\n\r\nThe hereditary taint due to the primeval barbarism of our race, and\r\nmaintained by later influences, will have to be bred out of it\r\nbefore our descendants can rise to the position of free members of\r\nan intelligent society: and I may add that the most likely nest at\r\nthe present time for self-reliant natures is to be found in States\r\nfounded and maintained by emigrants.\r\n\r\nServility has its romantic side, in the utter devotion of a slave to\r\nthe lightest wishes and the smallest comforts of his master, and in\r\nthat of a loyal subject to those of his sovereign; but such devotion\r\ncannot be called a reasonable self-sacrifice; it is rather an\r\nabnegation of the trust imposed on man to use his best judgment, and\r\nto act in the way he thinks the wisest. Trust in authority is a\r\ntrait of the character of children, of weakly women, and of the sick\r\nand infirm, but it is out of place among members of a thriving\r\nresolute community during the fifty or more years of their middle\r\nlife. Those who have been born in a free country feel the atmosphere\r\nof a paternal government very oppressive. The hearty and earnest\r\npolitical and individual life which is found when every man has a\r\ncontinual sense of public responsibility, and knows that success\r\ndepends on his own right judgment and exertion, is replaced under a\r\ndespotism by an indolent reliance upon what its master may direct,\r\nand by a demoralising conviction that personal advancement is best\r\nsecured by solicitations and favour.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTELLECTUAL DIFFERENCES.\r\n\r\nIt is needless for me to speak here about the differences in\r\nintellectual power between different men and different races, or\r\nabout the convertibility of genius as shown by different members of\r\nthe same gifted family achieving eminence in varied ways, as I have\r\nalready written at length on these subjects in _Hereditary Genius_\r\nand in _Antecedents of English Men of Science_. It is, however, well\r\nto remark that during the fourteen years that have elapsed since the\r\nformer book was published, numerous fresh instances have arisen of\r\ndistinction being attained by members of the gifted families whom I\r\nquoted as instances of heredity, thus strengthening my arguments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMENTAL IMAGERY.\r\n\r\nAnecdotes find their way into print, from time to time, of persons\r\nwhose visual memory is so clear and sharp as to present mental\r\npictures that may be scrutinised with nearly as much ease and\r\nprolonged attention as if they were real objects. I became\r\ninterested in the subject and made a rather extensive inquiry into\r\nthe mode of visual presentation in different persons, so far as\r\ncould be gathered from their respective statements. It seemed to me\r\nthat the results might illustrate the essential differences between\r\nthe mental operations of different men, that they might give some\r\nclue to the origin of visions, and that the course of the inquiry\r\nmight reveal some previously unnoticed facts. It has done all this\r\nmore or less, and I will explain the results in the present and in\r\nthe three following chapters.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to trouble the reader with my earlier tentative\r\nsteps to find out what I desired to learn. After the inquiry had\r\nbeen fairly started it took the form of submitting a certain number\r\nof printed questions to a large number of persons (see Appendix E).\r\nThere is hardly any more difficult task than that of framing\r\nquestions which are not likely to be misunderstood, which admit of\r\neasy reply, and which cover the ground of inquiry. I did my best in\r\nthese respects, without forgetting the most important part of\r\nall--namely, to tempt my correspondents to write freely in fuller\r\nexplanation of their replies, and on cognate topics as well. These\r\nseparate letters have proved more instructive and interesting by far\r\nthan the replies to the set questions.\r\n\r\nThe first group of the rather long series of queries related to the\r\nillumination, definition, and colouring of the mental image, and\r\nwere framed thus:--\r\n\r\n\"Before addressing yourself to any of the Questions on the\r\nopposite page, think of some definite object--suppose it is\r\nyour breakfast-table as you sat down to it this morning--and\r\nconsider carefully the picture that rises before your mind's eye.\"\r\n\r\n1. _Illumination_.--Is the image dim or fairly clear? Is its\r\nbrightness comparable to that of the actual scene?\r\n\r\n2. _Definition_.--Are all the objects pretty well defined at the\r\nsame time, or is the place of sharpest definition at any one moment\r\nmore contracted than it is in a real scene?\r\n\r\n3. _Colouring_.--Are the colours of the china, of the toast,\r\nbread-crust, mustard, meat, parsley, or whatever may have been on\r\nthe table, quite distinct and natural?\r\n\r\nThe earliest results of my inquiry amazed me. I had begun by\r\nquestioning friends in the scientific world, as they were the most\r\nlikely class of men to give accurate answers concerning this faculty\r\nof visualising, to which novelists and poets continually allude,\r\nwhich has left an abiding mark on the vocabularies of every language,\r\nand which supplies the material out of which dreams and the\r\nwell-known hallucinations of sick people are built.\r\n\r\nTo my astonishment, I found that the great majority of the men of\r\nscience to whom I first applied protested that mental imagery was\r\nunknown to them, and they looked on me as fanciful and fantastic in\r\nsupposing that the words \"mental imagery\" really expressed what I\r\nbelieved everybody supposed them to mean. They had no more notion of\r\nits true nature than a colour-blind man, who has not discerned his\r\ndefect, has of the nature of colour. They had a mental deficiency of\r\nwhich they were unaware, and naturally enough supposed that those\r\nwho affirmed they possessed it, were romancing. To illustrate their\r\nmental attitude it will be sufficient to quote a few lines from the\r\nletter of one of my correspondents, who writes:--\r\n\r\n\"These questions presuppose assent to some sort of a proposition\r\nregarding the 'mind's eye,' and the 'images' which it sees.... This\r\npoints to some initial fallacy.... It is only by a figure of speech\r\nthat I can describe my recollection of a scene as a 'mental image'\r\nwhich I can 'see' with my 'mind's eye.' ... I do not see it ... any\r\nmore than a man sees the thousand lines of Sophocles which under due\r\npressure he is ready to repeat. The memory possesses it, etc.\"\r\n\r\nMuch the same result followed inquiries made for me by a friend\r\namong members of the French Institute.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, when I spoke to persons whom I met in general\r\nsociety, I found an entirely different disposition to prevail. Many\r\nmen and a yet larger number of women, and many boys and girls,\r\ndeclared that they habitually saw mental imagery, and that it was\r\nperfectly distinct to them and full of colour. The more I pressed\r\nand cross-questioned them, professing myself to be incredulous, the\r\nmore obvious was the truth of their first assertions. They described\r\ntheir imagery in minute detail, and they spoke in a tone of surprise\r\nat my apparent hesitation in accepting what they said. I felt that I\r\nmyself should have spoken exactly as they did if I had been\r\ndescribing a scene that lay before my eyes, in broad daylight, to a\r\nblind man who persisted in doubting the reality of vision. Reassured\r\nby this happier experience, I recommenced to inquire among\r\nscientific men, and soon found scattered instances of what I sought,\r\nthough in by no means the same abundance as elsewhere. I then\r\ncirculated my questions more generally among my friends and through\r\ntheir hands, and obtained the replies that are the main subject of\r\nthis and of the three next chapters. They were from persons of both\r\nsexes, and of various ages, and in the end from occasional\r\ncorrespondents in nearly every civilised country.\r\n\r\nI have also received batches of answers from various educational\r\nestablishments both in England and America, which were made after\r\nthe masters had fully explained the meaning of the questions, and\r\ninterested the boys in them. These have the merit of returns derived\r\nfrom a general census, which my other data lack, because I cannot\r\nfor a moment suppose that the writers of the latter are a haphazard\r\nproportion of those to whom they were sent. Indeed I know of some who,\r\ndisavowing all possession of the power, and of many others who,\r\npossessing it in too faint a degree to enable them to express what\r\ntheir experiences really were, in a manner satisfactory to themselves,\r\nsent no returns at all. Considerable statistical similarity was,\r\nhowever, observed between the sets of returns furnished by the\r\nschoolboys and those sent by my separate correspondents, and I may\r\nadd that they accord in this respect with the oral information I\r\nhave elsewhere obtained. The conformity of replies from so many\r\ndifferent sources which was clear from the first, the fact of their\r\napparent trustworthiness being on the whole much increased by\r\ncross-examination (though I could give one or two amusing instances\r\nof break-down), and the evident effort made to give accurate answers,\r\nhave convinced me that it is a much easier matter than I had\r\nanticipated to obtain trustworthy replies to psychological questions.\r\nMany persons, especially women and intelligent children, take\r\npleasure in introspection, and strive their very best to explain\r\ntheir mental processes. I think that a delight in self-dissection\r\nmust be a strong ingredient in the pleasure that many are said to\r\ntake in confessing themselves to priests.\r\n\r\nHere, then, are two rather notable results: the one is the proved\r\nfacility of obtaining statistical insight into the processes of\r\nother persons' minds, whatever _à priori_ objection may have been\r\nmade as to its possibility; and the other is that scientific men, as\r\na class, have feeble powers of visual representation. There is no\r\ndoubt whatever on the latter point, however it may be accounted for.\r\nMy own conclusion is, that an over-ready perception of sharp mental\r\npictures is antagonistic to the acquirement of habits of\r\nhighly-generalised and abstract thought, especially when the steps\r\nof reasoning are carried on by words as symbols, and that if the\r\nfaculty of seeing the pictures was ever possessed by men who think\r\nhard, it is very apt to be lost by disuse. The highest minds are\r\nprobably those in which it is not lost, but subordinated, and is\r\nready for use on suitable occasions. I am, however, bound to say,\r\nthat the missing faculty seems to be replaced so serviceably by other\r\nmodes of conception, chiefly, I believe, connected with the\r\nincipient motor sense, not of the eyeballs only but of the muscles\r\ngenerally, that men who declare themselves entirely deficient in the\r\npower of seeing mental pictures can nevertheless give life-like\r\ndescriptions of what they have seen, and can otherwise express\r\nthemselves as if they were gifted with a vivid visual imagination.\r\nThey can also become painters of the rank of Royal Academicians.\r\n\r\nThe facts I am now about to relate are obtained from the returns of\r\n100 adult men, of whom 19 are Fellows of the Royal Society, mostly\r\nof very high repute, and at least twice, and I think I may say three\r\ntimes, as many more are persons of distinction in various kinds of\r\nintellectual work. As already remarked, these returns taken by\r\nthemselves do not profess to be of service in a general statistical\r\nsense, but they are of much importance in showing how men of\r\nexceptional accuracy express themselves when they are speaking of\r\nmental imagery. They also testify to the variety of experiences to\r\nbe met with in a moderately large circle. I will begin by giving a\r\nfew cases of the highest, of the medium, and of the lowest order of\r\nthe faculty of visualising. The hundred returns were first\r\nclassified according to the order of the faculty, as judged to the\r\nbest of my ability from the whole of what was said in them, and of\r\nwhat I knew from other sources of the writers; and the number\r\nprefixed to each quotation shows its place in the class-list.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIVIDNESS OF MENTAL IMAGERY.\r\n\r\n(From returns, furnished by 100 men, at least half of whom are\r\ndistinguished in science or in other fields of intellectual work.)\r\n\r\n_Cases where the faculty is very high_.\r\n\r\n1. Brilliant, distinct, never blotchy.\r\n\r\n2. Quite comparable to the real object. I feel as though I was\r\ndazzled, _e.g._ when recalling the sun to my mental vision.\r\n\r\n3. In some instances quite as bright as an actual scene.\r\n\r\n4. Brightness as in the actual scene.\r\n\r\n5. Thinking of the breakfast-table this morning, all the objects in\r\nmy mental picture are as bright as the actual scene.\r\n\r\n6. The image once seen is perfectly clear and bright.\r\n\r\n7. Brightness at first quite comparable to actual scene.\r\n\r\n8. The mental image appears to correspond in all respects with\r\nreality. I think it is as clear as the actual scene.\r\n\r\n9. The brightness is perfectly comparable to that of the real scene.\r\n\r\n10. I think the illumination of the imaginary image is nearly equal\r\nto that of the real one.\r\n\r\n11. All clear and bright; all the objects seem to me well defined at\r\nthe same time.\r\n\r\n12. I can see my breakfast-table or any equally familiar thing with\r\nmy mind's eye, quite as well in all particulars as I can do if the\r\nreality is before me.\r\n\r\n_Cases where the faculty is mediocre_.\r\n\r\n46. Fairly clear and not incomparable in illumination with that of\r\nthe real scene, especially when I first catch it. Apt to become\r\nfainter when more particularly attended to.\r\n\r\n47. Fairly clear, not quite comparable to that of the actual scene.\r\nSome objects are more sharply defined than others, the more familiar\r\nobjects coming more distinctly in my mind.\r\n\r\n48. Fairly clear as a general image; details rather misty.\r\n\r\n49. Fairly clear, but not equal to the scene. Defined, but not\r\nsharply; not all seen with equal clearness.\r\n\r\n50. Fairly clear. Brightness probably at least one-half to\r\ntwo-thirds of original. [The writer is a physiologist.] Definition\r\nvaries very much, one or two objects being much more distinct than\r\nthe others, but the latter come out clearly if attention be paid to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n51. Image of my breakfast-table fairly clear, but not quite so\r\nbright as the reality. Altogether it is pretty well defined; the\r\npart where I sit and its surroundings are pretty well so.\r\n\r\n52. Fairly clear, but brightness not comparable to that of the\r\nactual scene. The objects are sharply defined; some of them are\r\nsalient, and others insignificant and dim, but by separate efforts I\r\ncan take a visualised inventory of the whole table.\r\n\r\n53. Details of breakfast-table _when the scene is reflected on_ are\r\nfairly defined and complete, but I have had a familiarity of many\r\nyears with my own breakfast-table, and the above would not be the\r\ncase with a table seen casually unless there were some striking\r\npeculiarity in it,\r\n\r\n54. I can recall any single object or group of objects, but not the\r\nwhole table at once. The things recalled are generally clearly\r\ndefined. Our table is a long one; I can in my mind pass my eyes all\r\ndown the table and see the different things distinctly, but not the\r\nwhole table at once.\r\n\r\n_Cases where the faculty is at the lowest_.\r\n\r\n89. Dim and indistinct, yet I can give an account of this morning's\r\nbreakfast-table; split herrings, broiled chickens, bacon, rolls,\r\nrather light-coloured marmalade, faint green plates with stiff pink\r\nflowers, the girls' dresses, etc. etc. I can also tell where all the\r\ndishes were, and where the people sat (I was on a visit). But my\r\nimagination is seldom pictorial except between sleeping and waking,\r\nwhen I sometimes see rather vivid forms.\r\n\r\n90. Dim and not comparable in brightness to the real scene. Badly\r\ndefined with blotches of light; very incomplete.\r\n\r\n91. Dim, poor definition; could not sketch from it. I have a\r\ndifficulty in seeing two images together.\r\n\r\n92. Usually very dim. I cannot speak of its brightness, but only of\r\nits faintness. Not well defined and very incomplete.\r\n\r\n93. Dim, imperfect.\r\n\r\n94. I am very rarely able to recall any object whatever with any\r\nsort of distinctness. Very occasionally an object or image will\r\nrecall itself, but even then it is more like a generalised image\r\nthan an individual image. I seem to be almost destitute of\r\nvisualising power, as under control.\r\n\r\n95. No power of visualising. Between sleeping and waking, in illness\r\nand in health, with eyes closed, some remarkable scenes have\r\noccasionally presented themselves, but I cannot recall them when\r\nawake with eyes open, and by daylight, or under any circumstances\r\nwhatever when a copy could be made of them on paper. I have drawn\r\nboth men and places many days or weeks after seeing them, but it was\r\nby an effort of memory acting on study at the time, and assisted by\r\ntrial and error on the paper or canvas, whether in black, yellow, or\r\ncolour, afterwards.\r\n\r\n96. It is only as a figure of speech that I can describe my\r\nrecollection of a scene as a \"mental image\" which I can \"see\" with\r\nmy \"mind's eye.\" ... The memory possesses it, and the mind can at\r\nwill roam over the whole, or study minutely any part.\r\n\r\n97. No individual objects, only a general idea of a very uncertain\r\nkind.\r\n\r\n98. No. My memory is not of the nature of a spontaneous vision,\r\nthough I remember well where a word occurs in a page, how furniture\r\nlooks in a room, etc. The ideas not felt to be mental pictures, but\r\nrather the symbols of facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n99. Extremely dim. The impressions are in all respects so dim, vague,\r\nand transient, that I doubt whether they can reasonably be called\r\nimages. They are incomparably less than those of dreams.\r\n\r\n100. My powers are zero. To my consciousness there is almost no\r\nassociation of memory with objective visual impressions. I recollect\r\nthe breakfast-table, but do not see it.\r\n\r\nThese quotations clearly show the great variety of natural powers of\r\nvisual representation, and though the returns from which they are\r\ntaken have, as I said, no claim to be those of 100 Englishmen taken\r\nat haphazard, nevertheless, to the best of my judgment, they happen\r\nto differ among themselves in much the same way that such returns\r\nwould have done. I cannot procure a strictly haphazard series for\r\ncomparison, because in any group of persons whom I may question\r\nthere are always many too indolent to reply, or incapable of\r\nexpressing themselves, or who from some fancy of their own are\r\nunwilling to reply. Still, as already mentioned, I have got together\r\nseveral groups that approximate to what is wanted, usually from\r\nschools, and I have analysed them as well as I could, and the general\r\nresult is that the above returns may be accepted as a fair\r\nrepresentation of the visualising powers of Englishmen. Treating\r\nthese according to the method described in the chapter of statistics,\r\nwe have the following results, in which, as a matter of interest, I\r\nhave also recorded the highest and the lowest of the series:--\r\n\r\n_Highest_.--Brilliant, distinct, never blotchy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_First Suboctile_.--The image once seen is perfectly clear and\r\nbright.\r\n\r\n_First Octile_.--I can see my breakfast-table or any equally\r\nfamiliar thing with my mind's eye quite as well in all particulars\r\nas I can do if the reality is before me.\r\n\r\n_First Quartile_--Fairly clear; illumination of actual scene is\r\nfairly represented. Well defined. Parts do not obtrude themselves,\r\nbut attention has to be directed to different points in succession\r\nto call up the whole.\r\n\r\n_Middlemost_.--Fairly clear. Brightness probably at least from\r\none-half to two-thirds of the original. Definition varies very much,\r\none or two objects being much more distinct than the others, but the\r\nlatter come out clearly if attention be paid to them.\r\n\r\n_Last Quartile_.--Dim, certainly not comparable to the actual scene.\r\nI have to think separately of the several things on the table to\r\nbring them clearly before the mind's eye, and when I think of some\r\nthings the others fade away in confusion.\r\n\r\n_Last Octile_.--Dim and not comparable in brightness to the real\r\nscene. Badly defined, with blotches of light; very incomplete; very\r\nlittle of one object is seen at one time.\r\n\r\n_Last Suboctile_.--I am very rarely able to recall any object\r\nwhatever with any sort of distinctness. Very occasionally an object\r\nor image will recall itself, but even then it is more like a\r\ngeneralised image than an individual one. I seem to be almost\r\ndestitute of visualising power as under control.\r\n\r\n_Lowest_.--My powers are zero. To my consciousness there is almost\r\nno association of memory with objective visual impressions. I\r\nrecollect the table, but do not see it.\r\n\r\nI next proceed to colour, as specified in the third of my questions,\r\nand annex a selection from the returns classified on the same\r\nprinciple as in the preceding paragraph.\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLOUR REPRESENTATION.\r\n\r\n_Highest_.--Perfectly distinct, bright, and natural.\r\n\r\n_First Suboctile_.--White cloth, blue china, argand coffee-pot,\r\nbuff stand with sienna drawing, toast--all clear.\r\n\r\n_First Octile_.--All details seen perfectly.\r\n\r\n_First Quartile_.--Colours distinct and natural till I begin to\r\npuzzle over them.\r\n\r\n_Middlemost_.--Fairly distinct, though not certain that they are\r\naccurately recalled.\r\n\r\n_Last Quartile_.--Natural, but very indistinct.\r\n\r\n_Last Octile_.--Faint; can only recall colours by a special effort\r\nfor each.\r\n\r\n_Last Suboctile_.--Power is nil.\r\n\r\n_Lowest_.--Power is nil.\r\n\r\nIt may seem surprising that one out of every sixteen persons who are\r\naccustomed to use accurate expressions should speak of their mental\r\nimagery as perfectly clear and bright; but it is so, and many\r\ndetails are added in various returns emphasising the assertion. One\r\nof the commonest of these is to the effect, \"If I could draw, I am\r\nsure I could draw perfectly from my mental image.\" That some artists,\r\nsuch as Blake, have really done so is beyond dispute, but I have\r\nlittle doubt that there is an unconscious exaggeration in these\r\nreturns. My reason for saying so is that I have also returns from\r\nartists, who say as follows: \"My imagery is so clear, that if I had\r\nbeen unable to draw I should have unhesitatingly said that I could\r\ndraw from it.\" A foremost painter of the present day has used that\r\nexpression. He finds deficiencies and gaps when he tries to draw\r\nfrom his mental vision. There is perhaps some analogy between these\r\nimages and those of \"faces in the fire.\" One may often fancy an\r\nexceedingly well-marked face or other object in the burning coals,\r\nbut probably everybody will find, as I have done, that it is\r\nimpossible to draw it, for as soon as its outlines are seriously\r\nstudied, the fancy flies away.\r\n\r\nMr. Flinders Petrie, a contributor of interesting experiments on\r\nkindred subjects to _Nature_, informs me that he habitually works\r\nout sums by aid of an imaginary sliding rule, which he sets in the\r\ndesired way and reads off mentally. He does not usually visualise\r\nthe whole rule, but only that part of it with which he is at the\r\nmoment concerned (see Plate II. Fig. 34, where, however, the artist\r\nhas not put in the divisions very correctly). I think this is one of\r\nthe most striking cases of accurate visualising power it is possible\r\nto imagine.\r\n\r\nI have a few returns from chess-players who play games blindfolded;\r\nbut the powers of such men to visualise the separate boards with\r\ndifferent sets of men on the different boards, some ivory, some wood,\r\nand so forth, are well known, and I need not repeat them. I will\r\nrather give the following extract from an article in the _Pall Mall\r\nGazette_, 27th June 1882, on the recent chess tournament at Vienna:--\r\n\r\n\"The modern feats of blindfold play (without sight of board) greatly\r\nsurpass those of twenty years ago. Paul Morphy, the American, was\r\nthe first who made an especial study of this kind of display,\r\nplaying some seven or eight games blindfold and simultaneously\r\nagainst various inferior opponents, and making lucrative exhibitions\r\nin this way. His abilities in this line created a scare among other\r\nrivals who had not practised this test of memory. Since his day many\r\nchess-players who are gifted with strong and clear memory and power\r\nof picturing to the mind the ideal board and men, have carried this\r\nbranch of exhibition play far beyond Morphy's pitch; and,\r\ncontemporaneously with this development, it has become acknowledged\r\nthat skill in blindfold play is not an absolute test of similarly\r\nrelative powers over the board: _e.g._ Blackburne and Zukertort can\r\nplay as many as sixteen, or even twenty, blindfold games at a time,\r\nand win about 80 per cent of them at least. Steinitz, who beats them\r\nboth in match play, does not essay more than six blindfold at a time.\r\nMason does not, to our knowledge, make any _spécialité_ at all of\r\nthis sort.\"\r\n\r\nI have many cases of persons mentally reading off scores when\r\nplaying the pianoforte, or manuscript when they are making speeches.\r\nOne statesman has assured me that a certain hesitation in utterance\r\nwhich he has at times, is due to his being plagued by the image of\r\nhis manuscript speech with its original erasures and corrections. He\r\ncannot lay the ghost, and he puzzles in trying to decipher it.\r\n\r\nSome few persons see mentally in print every word that is uttered;\r\nthey attend to the visual equivalent and not to the sound of the\r\nwords, and they read them off usually as from a long imaginary strip\r\nof paper, such as is unwound from telegraphic instruments. The\r\nexperiences differ in detail as to size and kind of type, colour of\r\npaper, and so forth, but are always the same in the same person.\r\n\r\nA well-known frequenter of the Royal Institution tells me that he\r\noften craves for an absence of visual perceptions, they are so\r\nbrilliant and persistent. The Rev. George Henslow speaks of their\r\nextreme restlessness; they oscillate, rotate, and change.\r\n\r\nIt is a mistake to suppose that sharp sight is accompanied by clear\r\nvisual memory. I have not a few instances in which the independence\r\nof the two faculties is emphatically commented on; and I have at\r\nleast one clear case where great interest in outlines and accurate\r\nappreciation of straightness, squareness, and the like, is\r\nunaccompanied by the power of visualising. Neither does the faculty\r\ngo with dreaming. I have cases where it is powerful, and at the same\r\ntime where dreams are rare and faint or altogether absent. One\r\nfriend tells me that his dreams have not the hundredth part of the\r\nvigour of his waking fancies.\r\n\r\nThe visualising and the identifying powers are by no means\r\nnecessarily combined. A distinguished writer on meta-physical topics\r\nassures me that he is exceptionally quick at recognising a face that\r\nhe has seen before, but that he cannot call up a mental image of any\r\nface with clearness.\r\n\r\nSome persons have the power of combining in a single perception more\r\nthan can be seen at any one moment by the two eyes. It is needless\r\nto insist on the fact that all who have two eyes see stereoscopically,\r\nand therefore somewhat round a corner. Children, who can focus their\r\neyes on very near objects, must be able to comprise in a single\r\nmental image much more than a half of any small object they are\r\nexamining. Animals such as hares, whose eyes are set more on the\r\nside of the head than ours, must be able to perceive at one and the\r\nsame instant more of a panorama than we can. I find that a few\r\npersons can, by what they often describe as a kind of touch-sight,\r\nvisualise at the same moment all round the image of a solid body.\r\nMany can do so nearly, but not altogether round that of a\r\nterrestrial globe. An eminent mineralogist assures me that he is\r\nable to imagine simultaneously all the sides of a crystal with which\r\nhe is familiar. I may be allowed to quote a curious faculty of my\r\nown in respect to this. It is exercised only occasionally and in\r\ndreams, or rather in nightmares, but under those circumstances I am\r\nperfectly conscious of embracing an entire sphere in a single\r\nperception. It appears to lie within my mental eyeball, and to be\r\nviewed centripetally.\r\n\r\nThis power of comprehension is practically attained in many cases by\r\nindirect methods. It is a common feat to take in the whole\r\nsurroundings of an imagined room with such a rapid mental sweep as\r\nto leave some doubt whether it has not been viewed simultaneously.\r\nSome persons have the habit of viewing objects as though they were\r\npartly transparent; thus, if they so dispose a globe in their\r\nimagination as to see both its north and south poles at the same time,\r\nthey will not be able to see its equatorial parts. They can also\r\nperceive all the rooms of an imaginary house by a single mental\r\nglance, the walls and floors being as if made of glass. A fourth\r\nclass of persons have the habit of recalling scenes, not from the\r\npoint of view whence they were observed, but from a distance, and\r\nthey visualise their own selves as actors on the mental stage. By\r\none or other of these ways, the power of seeing the whole of an\r\nobject, and not merely one aspect of it, is possessed by many persons.\r\n\r\nThe place where the image appears to lie, differs much. Most persons\r\nsee it in an indefinable sort of way, others see it in front of the\r\neye, others at a distance corresponding to reality. There exists a\r\npower which is rare naturally, but can, I believe, be acquired\r\nwithout much difficulty, of projecting a mental picture upon a piece\r\nof paper, and of holding it fast there, so that it can be outlined\r\nwith a pencil. To this I shall recur.\r\n\r\nImages usually do not become stronger by dwelling on them; the first\r\nidea is commonly the most vigorous, but this is not always the case.\r\nSometimes the mental view of a locality is inseparably connected\r\nwith the sense of its position as regards the points of the compass,\r\nreal or imaginary. I have received full and curious descriptions\r\nfrom very different sources of this strong geographical tendency,\r\nand in one or two cases I have reason to think it allied to a\r\nconsiderable faculty of geographical comprehension.\r\n\r\nThe power of visualising is higher in the female sex than in the male,\r\nand is somewhat, but not much, higher in public schoolboys than in\r\nmen. After maturity is reached, the further advance of age does not\r\nseem to dim the faculty, but rather the reverse, judging from\r\nnumerous statements to that effect; but advancing years are\r\nsometimes accompanied by a growing habit of hard abstract thinking,\r\nand in these cases--not uncommon among those whom I have\r\nquestioned--the faculty undoubtedly becomes impaired. There is\r\nreason to believe that it is very high in some young children, who\r\nseem to spend years of difficulty in distinguishing between the\r\nsubjective and objective world. Language and book-learning certainly\r\ntend to dull it.\r\n\r\nThe visualising faculty is a natural gift, and, like all natural\r\ngifts, has a tendency to be inherited. In this faculty the tendency\r\nto inheritance is exceptionally strong, as I have abundant evidence\r\nto prove, especially in respect to certain rather rare peculiarities,\r\nof which I shall speak in the next chapter, and which, when they\r\nexist at all, are usually found among two, three, or more brothers\r\nand sisters, parents, children, uncles and aunts, and cousins.\r\n\r\nSince families differ so much in respect to this gift, we may\r\nsuppose that races would also differ, and there can be no doubt that\r\nsuch is the case. I hardly like to refer to civilised nations,\r\nbecause their natural faculties are too much modified by education\r\nto allow of their being appraised in an off-hand fashion. I may,\r\nhowever, speak of the French, who appear to possess the visualising\r\nfaculty in a high degree. The peculiar ability they show in\r\nprearranging ceremonials _fêtes_ of all kinds, and their undoubted\r\ngenius for tactics and strategy, show that they are able to foresee\r\neffects with unusual clearness. Their ingenuity in all technical\r\ncontrivances is an additional testimony in the same direction, and\r\nso is their singular clearness of expression. Their phrase,\r\n\"figurez-vous,\" or \"picture to yourself,\" seems to express their\r\ndominant mode of perception. Our equivalent of \"imagine\" is ambiguous.\r\n\r\nIt is among uncivilised races that natural differences in the\r\nvisualising faculty are most conspicuous. Many of them make carvings\r\nand rude illustrations, but only a few have the gift of carrying a\r\npicture in their mind's eye, judging by the completeness and\r\nfirmness of their designs, which show no trace of having been\r\nelaborated in that step-by-step manner which is characteristic of\r\ndraughtsmen who are not natural artists.\r\n\r\nAmong the races who are thus gifted are the commonly despised, but,\r\nas I confidently maintain from personal knowledge of them, the much\r\nunderrated Bushmen of South Africa. They are no doubt deficient in\r\nthe natural instincts necessary to civilisation, for they detest a\r\nregular life, they are inveterate thieves, and are incapable of\r\nwithstanding the temptation of strong drink. On the other hand, they\r\nhave few superiors among barbarians in the ingenious methods by\r\nwhich they supply the wants of a difficult existence, and in the\r\neffectiveness and nattiness of their accoutrements. One of their\r\nhabits is to draw pictures on the walls of caves of men and animals,\r\nand to colour them with ochre. These drawings were once numerous,\r\nbut they have been sadly destroyed by advancing colonisation, and\r\nfew of them, and indeed few wild Bushmen, now exist. Fortunately a\r\nlarge and valuable collection of facsimiles of Bushman art was made\r\nbefore it became too late by Mr. Stow, of the Cape Colony, who has\r\nvery lately sent some specimens of them to this country, in the hope\r\nthat means might be found for the publication of the entire series.\r\nAmong the many pictures of animals in each of the large sheets full\r\nof them, I was particularly struck with one of an eland as giving a\r\njust idea of the precision and purity of their best work. Others,\r\nagain, were exhibited last summer at the Anthropological Institute\r\nby Mr. Hutchinson.\r\n\r\nThe method by which the Bushmen draw is described in the following\r\nextract from a letter written to me by Dr. Mann, the well-known\r\nauthority on South African matters of science. The boy to whom he\r\nrefers belonged to a wild tribe living in caves in the Drakenberg,\r\nwho plundered outlying farms, and were pursued by the neighbouring\r\ncolonists. He was wounded and captured, then sent to hospital, and\r\nsubsequently taken into service. He was under Dr. Mann's observation\r\nin the year 1860, and has recently died, to the great regret of his\r\nemployer, Mr. Proudfoot, to whom he became a valuable servant.\r\n\r\nDr. Mann writes as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"This lad was very skilful in the proverbial Bushman art of\r\ndrawing animal figures, and upon several occasions I induced\r\nhim to show me how this was managed among his people. He\r\ninvariably began by jotting down upon paper or on a slate a\r\nnumber of isolated dots which presented no connection or trace\r\nof outline of any kind to the uninitiated eye, but looked like\r\nthe stars scattered promiscuously in the sky. Having with much\r\ndeliberation satisfied himself of the sufficiency of these dots,\r\nhe forthwith began to run a free bold line from one to the other,\r\nand as he did so the form of an animal--horse, buffalo, elephant,\r\nor some kind of antelope--gradually developed itself. This was\r\ninvariably done with a free hand, and with such unerring accuracy\r\nof touch, that no correction of a line was at any time attempted.\r\nI understood from the lad that this was the plan which was invariably\r\npursued by his kindred in making their clever pictures.\"\r\n\r\nIt is impossible, I think, for a drawing to be made on this method\r\nunless the artist had a clear image in his mind's eye of what he was\r\nabout to draw, and was able, in some degree, to project it on the\r\npaper or slate.\r\n\r\nOther living races have the gift of drawing, but none more so than\r\nthe Eskimo. I will therefore speak of these and not of the\r\nAustralian and Tasmanian pictures, nor of the still ruder\r\nperformances of the old inhabitants of Guiana, nor of those of some\r\nNorth American tribes, as the Iroquois. The Eskimos are geographers\r\nby instinct, and appear to see vast tracts of country mapped out in\r\ntheir heads. From the multitude of illustrations of their\r\nmap-drawing powers, I may mention one of those included in the\r\njournals of Captain Hall, at p. 224, which were published in 1879 by\r\nthe United States Government, under the editorship of Professor J. E.\r\nNourse. It is the facsimile of a chart drawn by an Eskimo who was a\r\nthorough barbarian in the accepted sense of the word; that is to say,\r\nhe spoke no language besides his own uncouth tongue, he was wholly\r\nuneducated according to our modern ideas, and he lived in what we\r\nshould call a savage fashion. This man drew from memory a chart of\r\nthe region over which he had at one time or another gone in his canoe.\r\nIt extended from Pond's Bay, in lat. 73°, to Fort Churchill, in lat.\r\n58°44', over a distance in a straight line of more than 960 nautical,\r\nor 1100 English miles, the coast being so indented by arms of the\r\nsea that its length is six times as great. On comparing this rough\r\nEskimo outline with the Admiralty chart of 1870, their accordance is\r\nremarkable. I have seen many MS. route maps made by travellers a few\r\nyears since, when the scientific exploration of the world was much\r\nless advanced than it is now, and I can confidently say that I have\r\nnever known of any traveller, white or brown, civilised or\r\nuncivilised, in Africa, Asia, or Australia, who, being unprovided\r\nwith surveying instruments, and trusting to his memory alone, has\r\nproduced a chart comparable in extent and accuracy to that of this\r\nbarbarous Eskimo. The aptitude of the Eskimos to draw, is abundantly\r\nshown by the numerous illustrations in Rink's work, all of which\r\nwere made by self-taught men, and are thoroughly realistic.\r\n\r\nSo much for the wild races of the present day; but even the Eskimo\r\nare equalled in their power of drawing by the men of old times. In\r\nages so far gone by, that the interval that separates them from our\r\nown may be measured in perhaps hundreds of thousands of years, when\r\nEurope was mostly icebound, a race who, in the opinion of all\r\nanthropologists, was closely allied to the modern Eskimo, lived in\r\ncaves in the more habitable places. Many broken relics of that race\r\nhave been found; some few of these are of bone engraved with flints\r\nor carved into figures, and among these are representations of the\r\nmammoth, elk, and reindeer, which, if made by an English labourer\r\nwith the much better implements at his command, would certainly\r\nattract local attention and lead to his being properly educated, and\r\nin much likelihood to his becoming a considerable artist if he had\r\nintellectual powers to match.\r\n\r\nIt is not at all improbable that these prehistoric men had the same\r\ngeographical instincts as the modern Eskimo, whom they closely\r\nresemble in every known respect. If so, it is perfectly possible\r\nthat scraps of charts scratched on bone or stone, of prehistoric\r\nEurope, when the distribution of land, sea, and ice was very\r\ndifferent to what it is now, may still exist, buried underground,\r\nand may reward the zeal of some future cave explorer.\r\n\r\nThere is abundant evidence that the visualising faculty admits of\r\nbeing developed by education. The testimony on which I would\r\nlay especial stress is derived from the published experiences of\r\nM. Lecoq de Boisbaudran, late director of the École Nationale de Dessein,\r\nin Paris, which are related in his _Education de la M. émoire\r\nPittoresque_ [1] He trained his pupils with extraordinary success,\r\nbeginning with the simplest figures. They were made to study the\r\nmodels thoroughly before they tried to draw them from memory. One\r\nfavourite expedient was to associate the sight memory with the\r\nmuscular memory, by making his pupils follow at a distance the\r\noutlines of the figures with a pencil held in their hands. After\r\nthree or four months' practice, their visual memory became greatly\r\nstrengthened. They had no difficulty in summoning images at will, in\r\nholding them steady, and in drawing them. Their copies [7] were\r\nexecuted with marvellous fidelity, as attested by a commission of\r\nthe Institute, appointed in 1852 to inquire into the matter, of\r\nwhich the eminent painter Horace Vernet was a member. The present\r\nSlade Professor of Fine Arts at University College, M. Légros, was a\r\npupil of M. de Boisbaudran. He has expressed to me his indebtedness\r\nto the system, and he has assured me of his own success in teaching\r\nothers in a somewhat similar way.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Republished in an 8vo, entitled _Enseignment\r\nArtistique_. Morel et Cie. Paris, 1879.]\r\n\r\nColonel Moncrieff informs me that, when wintering in 1877 near Fort\r\nGarry in North America, young Indians occasionally came to his\r\nquarters, and that he found them much interested in any pictures or\r\nprints that were put before them. On one of these occasions he saw\r\nan Indian tracing the outline of a print from the _Illustrated News_\r\nvery carefully with the point of his knife. The reason he gave for\r\nthis odd manoeuvre was, that he would remember the better how to\r\ncarve it when he returned home.\r\n\r\nI could mention instances within my own experience in which the\r\nvisualising faculty has become strengthened by practice; notably one\r\nof an eminent electrical engineer, who had the power of recalling\r\nform with unusual precision, but not colour. A few weeks after he\r\nhad replied to my questions, he told me that my inquiries had\r\ninduced him to practise his colour memory, and that he had done so\r\nwith such success that he was become quite an adept at it, and that\r\nthe newly-acquired power was a source of much pleasure to him.\r\n\r\nA useful faculty, easily developed by practice, is that of retaining\r\na retinal picture. A scene is flashed upon the eye; the memory of it\r\npersists, and details, which escaped observation during the brief\r\ntime when it was actually seen, may be analysed and studied at\r\nleisure in the subsequent vision.\r\n\r\nThe memories we should aim at acquiring are, however, such as are\r\nbased on a thorough understanding of the objects observed. In no\r\ncase is this more surely effected than in the processes of\r\nmechanical drawing, where the intended structure has to be portrayed\r\nso exactly in plan, elevation, side view, and sections, that the\r\nworkman has simply to copy the drawing in metal, wood, or stone, as\r\nthe case may be. It is undoubtedly the fact that mechanicians,\r\nengineers, and architects usually possess the faculty of seeing\r\nmental images with remarkable clearness and precision.\r\n\r\nA few dots like those used by the Bushmen give great assistance in\r\ncreating an imaginary picture, as proved by our general habit of\r\nworking out ideas by the help of marks and rude lines. The use of\r\ndolls by children also testifies to the value of an objective\r\nsupport in the construction of mental images. The doll serves as a\r\nkind of skeleton for the child to clothe with fantastic attributes,\r\nand the less individuality the doll has, the more it is appreciated\r\nby the child, who can the better utilise it as a lay figure in many\r\ndifferent characters. The chief art of strengthening visual, as well\r\nas every other form of memory, lies in multiplying associations; the\r\nhealthiest memory being that in which all the associations are\r\nlogical, and toward which all the senses concur in their due\r\nproportions. It is wonderful how much the vividness of a\r\nrecollection is increased when two or more lines of association are\r\nsimultaneously excited. Thus the inside of a known house is much\r\nbetter visualised when we are looking at its outside than when we\r\nare away from it, and some chess-players have told me that it is\r\neasier for them to play a game from memory when they have a blank\r\nboard before them than when they have not.\r\n\r\nThere is an absence of flexibility in the mental imagery of most\r\npersons. They find that the first image they have acquired of any\r\nscene is apt to hold its place tenaciously in spite of subsequent\r\nneed of correction. They find a difficulty in shifting their mental\r\nview of an object, and examining it at pleasure in different\r\npositions. If they see an object equally often in many positions the\r\nmemories combine and confuse one another, forming a \"composite\" blur,\r\nwhich they cannot dissect into its components. They are less able to\r\nvisualise the features of intimate friends than those of persons of\r\nwhom they have caught only a single glance. Many such persons have\r\nexpressed to me their grief at finding themselves powerless to\r\nrecall the looks of dear relations whom they had lost, while they\r\nhad no difficulty in recollecting faces that were uninteresting to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nOthers have a complete mastery over their mental images. They can\r\ncall up the figure of a friend and make it sit on a chair or stand\r\nup at will; they can make it turn round and attitudinise in any way,\r\nas by mounting it on a bicycle or compelling it to perform gymnastic\r\nfeats on a trapeze. They are able to build up elaborate geometric\r\nstructures bit by bit in their mind's eye, and add, subtract, or\r\nalter at will and at leisure. This free action of a vivid\r\nvisualising faculty is of much importance in connection with the\r\nhigher processes of generalised thought, though it is commonly put\r\nto no such purpose, as may be easily explained by an example. Suppose\r\na person suddenly to accost another with the following words:--\r\n\"I want to tell you about a boat.\" What is the idea that the word\r\n\"boat\" would be likely to call up? I tried the experiment with this\r\nresult. One person, a young lady, said that she immediately saw the\r\nimage of a rather large boat pushing off from the shore, and that it\r\nwas full of ladies and gentlemen, the ladies being dressed in white\r\nand blue. It is obvious that a tendency to give so specific an\r\ninterpretation to a general word is absolutely opposed to philosophic\r\nthought. Another person, who was accustomed to philosophise, said\r\nthat the word \"boat\" had aroused no definite image, because he had\r\npurposely held his mind in suspense. He had exerted himself not to\r\nlapse into any one of the special ideas that he felt the word boat\r\nwas ready to call up, such as a skiff, wherry, barge, launch, punt,\r\nor dingy. Much more did he refuse to think of any one of these with\r\nany particular freight or from any particular point of view. A habit\r\nof suppressing mental imagery must therefore characterise men who\r\ndeal much with abstract ideas; and as the power of dealing easily\r\nand firmly with these ideas is the surest criterion of a high order\r\nof intellect, we should expect that the visualising faculty would be\r\nstarved by disuse among philosophers, and this is precisely what I\r\nfound on inquiry to be the case.\r\n\r\nBut there is no reason why it should be so, if the faculty is free\r\nin its action, and not tied to reproduce hard and persistent forms;\r\nit may then produce generalised pictures out of its past experiences\r\nquite automatically. It has no difficulty in reducing images to the\r\nsame scale, owing to our constant practice in watching objects as\r\nthey approach or recede, and consequently grow or diminish in\r\napparent size. It readily shifts images to any desired point of the\r\nfield of view, owing to our habit of looking at bodies in motion to\r\nthe right or left, upward or downward. It selects images that\r\npresent the same aspect, either by a simple act of memory or by a\r\nfeat of imagination that forces them into the desired position, and\r\nit has little or no difficulty in reversing them from right to left,\r\nas if seen in a looking-glass. In illustration of these generalised\r\nmental images, let us recur to the boat, and suppose the speaker to\r\ncontinue as follows:--\"The boat was a four-oared racing-boat, it was\r\npassing quickly to the left just in front of me, and the men were\r\nbending forward to take a fresh stroke.\" Now at this point of the\r\nstory the listener ought to have a picture well before his eye. It\r\nought to have the distinctness of a real four-oar going to the left,\r\nat the moment when many of its details still remained unheeded, such\r\nas the dresses of the men and their individual features. It would be\r\nthe generic image of a four-oar formed by the combination into a\r\nsingle picture of a great many sight memories of those boats.\r\n\r\nIn the highest minds a descriptive word is sufficient to evoke\r\ncrowds of shadowy associations, each striving to manifest itself.\r\nWhen they differ so much from one another as to be unfitted for\r\ncombination into a single idea, there will be a conflict, each being\r\nprevented by the rest from obtaining sole possession of the field of\r\nconsciousness. There could, therefore, be no definite imagery so\r\nlong as the aggregate of all the pictures that the word suggested of\r\nobjects presenting similar aspects, reduced to the same size, and\r\naccurately superposed, resulted in a blur; but a picture would\r\ngradually evolve as qualifications were added to the word, and it\r\nwould attain to the distinctness and vividness of a generic image\r\nlong before the word had been so restricted as to be individualised.\r\nIf the intellect be slow, though correct in its operations, the\r\nassociations will be few, and the generalised image based on\r\ninsufficient data. If the visualising power be faint, the\r\ngeneralised image will be indistinct.\r\n\r\nI cannot discover any closer relation between high visualising power\r\nand the intellectual faculties than between verbal memory and those\r\nsame faculties. That it must afford immense help in some professions\r\nstands to reason, but in ordinary social life the possession of a\r\nhigh visualising power, as of a high verbal memory, may pass quite\r\nunobserved. I have to the last failed in anticipating the character\r\nof the answers that my friends would give to my inquiries, judging\r\nfrom my previous knowledge of them; though I am bound to say that,\r\nhaving received their answers, I could usually persuade myself that\r\nthey were justified by my recollections of their previous sayings\r\nand conduct generally.\r\n\r\nThe faculty is undoubtedly useful in a high degree to inventive\r\nmechanicians, and the great majority of those whom I have questioned\r\nhave spoken of their powers as very considerable. They invent their\r\nmachines as they walk, and see them in height, breadth, and depth as\r\nreal objects, and they can also see them in action. In fact, a\r\nperiodic action of any kind appears to be easily recalled. But the\r\npowers of other men are considerably less; thus an engineer officer\r\nwho has himself great power of visual memory, and who has\r\nsuperintended the mathematical education of cadets, doubts if one in\r\nten can visualise an object in three dimensions. I should have\r\nthought the faculty would be common among geometricians, but many of\r\nthe highest seem able somehow to get on without much of it. There is\r\na curious dictum of Napoleon I. quoted in Hume's _Précis of Modern\r\nTactics_, p. 15, of which I can neither find the original authority\r\nnor do I fully understand the meaning. He is reported to have said\r\nthat \"there are some who, from some physical or moral peculiarity of\r\ncharacter, form a picture (_tableau_) of everything. No matter what\r\nknowledge, intellect, courage, or good qualities they may have,\r\nthese men are unfit to command.\" It is possible that \"tableau\"\r\nshould be construed rather in the sense of a pictorial composition,\r\nwhich, like an epigrammatic sentence, may be very complete and\r\neffective, but not altogether true.\r\n\r\nThere can, however, be no doubt as to the utility of the visualising\r\nfaculty when it is duly subordinated to the higher intellectual\r\noperations. A visual image is the most perfect form of mental\r\nrepresentation wherever the shape, position, and relations of\r\nobjects in space are concerned. It is of importance in every\r\nhandicraft and profession where design is required. The best workmen\r\nare those who visualise the whole of what they propose to do, before\r\nthey take a tool in their hands. The village smith and the carpenter\r\nwho are employed on odd jobs employ it no less for their work than\r\nthe mechanician, the engineer, and the architect. The lady's maid\r\nwho arranges a new dress requires it for the same reason as the\r\ndecorator employed on a palace, or the agent who lays out great\r\nestates. Strategists, artists of all denominations, physicists who\r\ncontrive new experiments, and in short all who do not follow routine,\r\nhave need of it. The pleasure its use can afford is immense. I have\r\nmany correspondents who say that the delight of recalling beautiful\r\nscenery and great works of art is the highest that they know; they\r\ncarry whole picture galleries in their minds. Our bookish and wordy\r\neducation tends to repress this valuable gift of nature. A faculty\r\nthat is of importance in all technical and artistic occupations,\r\nthat gives accuracy to our perceptions, and justness to our\r\ngeneralisations, is starved by lazy disuse, instead of being\r\ncultivated judiciously in such a way as will on the whole bring the\r\nbest return. I believe that a serious study of the best method of\r\ndeveloping and utilising this faculty, without prejudice to the\r\npractice of abstract thought in symbols, is one of the many pressing\r\ndesiderata in the yet unformed science of education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNUMBER-FORMS.\r\n\r\nPersons who are imaginative almost invariably think of _numerals_ in\r\nsome form of visual imagery. If the idea of _six_ occurs to them,\r\nthe word \"six\" does not sound in their mental ear, but the figure 6\r\nin a written or printed form rises before their mental eye. The\r\nclearness of the images of numerals, and the number of them that can\r\nbe mentally viewed at the same time, differs greatly in different\r\npersons. The most common case is to see only two or three figures at\r\nonce, and in a position too vague to admit of definition. There are\r\na few persons in whom the visualising faculty is so low that they\r\ncan mentally see neither numerals nor anything else; and again there\r\nare a few in whom it is so high as to give rise to hallucinations.\r\nThose who are able to visualise a numeral with a distinctness\r\ncomparable to reality, and to behold it as if it were before their\r\neyes, and not in some sort of dreamland, will define the direction in\r\nwhich it seems to lie, and the distance at which it appears to be.\r\nIf they were looking at a ship on the horizon at the moment that the\r\nfigure 6 happened to present itself to their minds, they could say\r\nwhether the image lay to the left or right of the ship, and whether\r\nit was above or below the line of the horizon; they could always\r\npoint to a definite spot in space, and say with more or less\r\nprecision that that was the direction in which the image of the\r\nfigure they were thinking of, first appeared.\r\n\r\nNow the strange psychological fact to which I desire to draw\r\nattention, is that among persons who visualise figures clearly there\r\nare many who notice that the image of the same figure invariably\r\nmakes its first appearance in the same direction, and at the same\r\ndistance. Such a person would always see the figure when it first\r\nappeared to him at (we may suppose) one point of the compass to the\r\nleft of the line between his eye and the ship, at the level of the\r\nhorizon, and at twenty feet distance. Again, we may suppose that he\r\nwould see the figure 7 invariably half a point to the left of the\r\nship, at an altitude equal to the sun's diameter above the horizon,\r\nand at thirty feet distance; similarly for all the other figures.\r\nConsequently, when he thinks of the series of numerals 1, 2, 3, 4,\r\netc., they show themselves in a definite pattern that always\r\noccupies an identical position in his field of view with respect to\r\nthe direction in which he is looking.\r\n\r\nThose who do not see figures with the same objectivity, use\r\nnevertheless the same expressions with reference to their mental\r\nfield of view. They can draw what they see in a manner fairly\r\nsatisfactory to themselves, but they do not locate it so strictly in\r\nreference to their axis of sight and to the horizontal plane that\r\npasses through it. It is with them as in dreams, the imagery is\r\nbefore and around, but the eyes during sleep are turned inwards and\r\nupwards.\r\n\r\nThe pattern or \"Form\" in which the numerals are seen is by no means\r\nthe same in different persons, but assumes the most grotesque\r\nvariety of shapes, which run in all sorts of angles, bends, curves,\r\nand zigzags as represented in the various illustrations to this\r\nchapter. The drawings, however, fail in giving the idea of their\r\napparent size to those who see them; they usually occupy a wider\r\nrange than the mental eye can take in at a single glance, and compel\r\nit to wander. Sometimes they are nearly panoramic.\r\n\r\nThese Forms have for the most part certain characteristics in common.\r\nThey are stated in all cases to have been in existence, so far as\r\nthe earlier numbers in the Form are concerned, as long back as the\r\nmemory extends; they come into view quite independently of the will,\r\nand their shape and position, at all events in the mental field of\r\nview, is nearly invariable. They have other points in common to\r\nwhich I shall shortly draw attention, but first I will endeavour to\r\nremove all doubt as to the authenticity and trustworthiness of these\r\nstatements.\r\n\r\nI see no \"Form\" myself, and first ascertained that such a thing\r\nexisted through a letter from Mr. G. Bidder, Q.C., in which he\r\ndescribed his own case as a very curious peculiarity. I was at the\r\ntime making inquiries about the strength of the visualising faculty\r\nin different persons, and among the numerous replies that reached me\r\nI soon collected ten or twelve other cases in which the writers\r\nspoke of their seeing numerals in definite forms. Though the\r\ninformation came from independent sources, the expressions used were\r\nso closely alike that they strongly corroborated one another. Of\r\ncourse I eagerly followed up the inquiry, and when I had collected\r\nenough material to justify publication, I wrote an account which\r\nappeared in _Nature_ on 15th January 1880, with several illustrations.\r\nThis has led to a wide correspondence and to a much-increased store\r\nof information, which enables me to arrive at the following\r\nconclusions. The answers I received whenever I have pushed my\r\nquestions, have been straightforward and precise. I have not\r\nunfrequently procured a second sketch of the Form even after more\r\nthan two years' interval, and found it to agree closely with the\r\nfirst one. I have also questioned many of my own friends in general\r\nterms as to whether they visualise numbers in any particular way.\r\nThe large majority are unable to do so. But every now and then I\r\nmeet with persons who possess the faculty, and I have become\r\nfamiliar with the quick look of intelligence with which they receive\r\nmy question. It is as though some chord had been struck which had\r\nnot been struck before, and the verbal answers they give me are\r\nprecisely of the same type as those written ones of which I have now\r\nso many. I cannot doubt of the authenticity of independent statements\r\nwhich closely confirm one another, nor of the general accuracy of\r\nthe accompanying sketches, because I find now that my collection is\r\nlarge enough for classification, that they might be arranged in an\r\napproximately continuous series. I am often told that the\r\npeculiarity is common to the speaker and to some near relative, and\r\nthat they had found such to be the case by accident. I have the\r\nstrongest evidence of its hereditary character after allowing, and\r\nover-allowing, for all conceivable influences of education and\r\nfamily tradition.\r\n\r\nLast of all, I took advantage of the opportunity afforded by a\r\nmeeting of the Anthropological Institute to read a memoir there on\r\nthe subject, and to bring with me many gentlemen well known in the\r\nscientific world, who have this habit of seeing numerals in Forms,\r\nand whose diagrams were suspended on the walls. Amongst them are\r\nMr. G. Bidder, Q.C., the Rev. Mr. G. Henslow, the botanist;\r\nProf. Schuster, F.R.S., the physicist; Mr. Roget, Mr. Woodd Smith,\r\nand Colonel Yule, C.B., the geographer. These diagrams are given\r\nin Plate I. Figs. 20-24. I wished that some of my foreign\r\ncorrespondents could also have been present, such as M. Antoine\r\nd'Abbadie, the well-known French traveller and Membre de l'Institut,\r\nand Baron v. Osten Sacken, the Russian diplomatist and entomologist,\r\nfor they had given and procured me much information.\r\n\r\nI feel sure that I have now said enough to remove doubts as to the\r\nauthenticity of my data. Their trustworthiness will, I trust, be\r\nstill more apparent as I proceed; it has been abundantly manifest to\r\nmyself from the internal evidences in a large mass of correspondence,\r\nto which I can unfortunately do no adequate justice in a brief memoir.\r\nIt remains to treat the data in the same way as any other scientific\r\nfacts and to extract as much meaning from them as possible.\r\n\r\nThe peculiarity in question is found, speaking very roughly, in about\r\n1 out of every 30 adult males or 15 females. It consists in the\r\nsudden and automatic appearance of a vivid and invariable \"Form\" in\r\nthe mental field of view, whenever a numeral is thought of, in which\r\neach numeral has its own definite place. This Form may consist of a\r\nmere line of any shape, of a peculiarly arranged row or rows of\r\nfigures, or of a shaded space.\r\n\r\nI give woodcuts of representative specimens of these Forms, and very\r\nbrief descriptions of them extracted from the letters of my\r\ncorrespondents. Sixty-three other diagrams on a smaller scale will\r\nbe found in Plates I., II. and III., and two more which are coloured\r\nare given in Plate IV.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\nD.A. \"From the very first I have seen numerals up to nearly 200,\r\nrange themselves always in a particular manner, and in thinking of a\r\nnumber it always takes its place in the figure. The more attention I\r\ngive to the properties of numbers and their interpretations, the\r\nless I am troubled with this clumsy framework for them, but it is\r\nindelible in my mind's eye even when for a long time less\r\nconsciously so. The higher numbers are to me quite abstract and\r\nunconnected with a shape. This rough and untidy [8] production is\r\nthe best I can do towards representing what I see. There was a\r\nlittle difficulty in the performance, because it is only by catching\r\noneself at unawares, so to speak, that one is quite sure that what\r\none sees is not affected by temporary imagination. But it does not\r\nseem much like, chiefly because the mental picture never seems\r\n_on_ the flat but _in_ a thick, dark gray atmosphere deepening in\r\ncertain parts, especially where 1 emerges, and about 20. How I get\r\nfrom 100 to 120 I hardly know, though if I could require these\r\nfigures a few times without thinking of them on purpose, I should\r\nsoon notice. About 200 I lose all framework. I do not see the actual\r\nfigures very distinctly, but what there is of them is distinguished\r\nfrom the dark by a thin whitish tracing. It is the place they take\r\nand the shape they make collectively which is invariable. Nothing\r\nmore definitely takes its place than a person's age. The person is\r\nusually there so long as his age is in mind.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: The engraver took much pains to interpret the meaning\r\nof the rather faint but carefully made drawing, by strengthening\r\nsome of the shades. The result was very very satisfactory, judging\r\nfrom the author's own view of it, which is as follows:--\"Certainly\r\nif the engraver has been as successful with all the other\r\nrepresentations as with that of my shape and its accompaniments,\r\nyour article must be entirely correct.\"]\r\n\r\nT. M. \"The representation I carry in my mind of the numerical series\r\nis quite distinct to me, so much so that I cannot think of any\r\nnumber but I at once see it (as it were) in its peculiar place in\r\nthe diagram. My remembrance of dates is also nearly entirely\r\ndependent on a clear mental vision of their _loci_ in the diagram.\r\nThis, as nearly as I can draw it, is the following:--\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\n\"It is only approximately correct (if the term 'correct' be at all\r\napplicable). The numbers seem to approach more closely as I ascend\r\nfrom 10 to 20, 30, 40, etc. The lines embracing a hundred numbers\r\nalso seem to approach as I go on to 400, 500, to 1000. Beyond 1000 I\r\nhave only the sense of an infinite line in the direction of the arrow,\r\nlosing itself in darkness towards the millions. Any special number\r\nof thousands returns in my mind to its position in the parallel\r\nlines from 1 to 1000. The diagram was present in my mind from early\r\nchildhood; I remember that I learnt the multiplication table by\r\nreference to it at the age of seven or eight. I need hardly say that\r\nthe impression is not that of perfectly straight lines, I have\r\ntherefore used no ruler in drawing it.\"\r\n\r\nJ.S. \"The figures are about a quarter of an inch in length, and in\r\nordinary type. They are black on a white ground. The numeral 200\r\ngenerally takes the place of 100 and obliterates it. There is no\r\nlight or shade, and the picture is invariable.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                           etc.  etc.\r\n                                      120+---------------\r\n                                         |\r\n                                         |\r\n                                         |110\r\n                                         |\r\n      30   40   50   60   70   80   90   |\r\n    /\r\n  20|\r\n    |\r\n    |\r\n  10|\r\n    |\r\n   1|\r\n\r\n\r\nIn some cases, the mental eye has to travel along the faintly-marked\r\nand blank paths of a Form, to the place where the numeral that is\r\nwanted is known to reside, and then the figure starts into sight. In\r\nother cases all the numerals, as far as 100 or more, are faintly\r\nseen at once, but the figure that is wanted grows more vivid than its\r\nneighbours; in one of the cases there is, as it were, a chain, and\r\nthe particular link rises as if an unseen hand had lifted it. The\r\nForms are sometimes variously coloured, occasionally very\r\nbrilliantly (see Plate IV.). In all of these the definition and\r\nillumination vary much in different parts. Usually the Forms fade\r\naway into indistinctness after 100; sometimes they come to a dead\r\nstop. The higher numbers very rarely fill so large a space in the\r\nForms as the lower ones, and the diminution of space occupied by\r\nthem is so increasingly rapid that I thought it not impossible they\r\nmight diminish according to some geometrical law, such as that which\r\ngoverns sensitivity. I took many careful measurements and averaged\r\nthem, but the result did not justify the supposition.\r\n\r\nIt is beyond dispute that these forms originate at an early age;\r\nthey are subsequently often developed in boyhood and youth so as to\r\ninclude the higher numbers, and, among mathematical students, the\r\nnegative values.\r\n\r\nNearly all of my correspondents speak with confidence of their Forms\r\nhaving been in existence as far back as they recollect. One states\r\nthat he knows he possessed it at the age of four; another, that he\r\nlearnt his multiplication table by the aid of the elaborate mental\r\ndiagram he still uses. Not one in ten is able to suggest any clue as\r\nto their origin. They cannot be due to anything written or printed,\r\nbecause they do not simulate what is found in ordinary writings or\r\nbooks.\r\n\r\nAbout one-third of the figures are curved to the left, two-thirds to\r\nthe right; they run more often upward than downward. They do not\r\ncommonly lie in a single plane. Sometimes a Form has twists as well\r\nas bends, sometimes it is turned upside down, sometimes it plunges\r\ninto an abyss of immeasurable depth, or it rises and disappears in\r\nthe sky. My correspondents are often in difficulties when trying to\r\ndraw them in perspective. One sent me a stereoscopic picture\r\nphotographed from a wire that had been bent into the proper shape.\r\nIn one case the Form proceeds at first straightforward, then it\r\nmakes a backward sweep high above head, and finally recurves into\r\nthe pocket, of all places! It is often sloped upwards at a slight\r\ninclination from a little below the level of the eye, just as\r\nobjects on a table would appear to a child whose chin was barely\r\nabove it.\r\n\r\nIt may seem strange that children should have such bold conceptions\r\nas of curves sweeping loftily upward or downward to immeasurable\r\ndepths, but I think it may be accounted for by their much larger\r\npersonal experience of the vertical dimension of space than adults.\r\nThey are lifted, tossed and swung, but adults pass their lives very\r\nmuch on a level, and only judge of heights by inference from the\r\npicture on their retina. Whenever a man first ventures up in a\r\nballoon, or is let, like a gatherer of sea-birds' eggs, over the\r\nface of a precipice, he is conscious of having acquired a much\r\nextended experience of the third dimension of space.\r\n\r\nThe character of the forms under which historical dates are\r\nvisualised contrast strongly with the ordinary Number-Forms. They\r\nare sometimes copied from the numerical ones, but they are more\r\ncommonly based both clearly and consciously on the diagrams used in\r\nthe schoolroom or on some recollected fancy.\r\n\r\nThe months of the year are usually perceived as ovals, and they as\r\noften follow one another in a reverse direction to those of the\r\nfigures on the clock, as in the same direction. It is a common\r\npeculiarity that the months do not occupy equal spaces, but those\r\nthat are most important to the child extend more widely than the rest.\r\nThere are many varieties as to the topmost month; it is by no means\r\nalways January.\r\n\r\nThe Forms of the letters of the alphabet, when imaged, as they\r\nsometimes are, in that way, are equally easy to be accounted for,\r\ntherefore the ordinary Number-Form is the oldest of all, and\r\nconsequently the most interesting. I suppose that it first came into\r\nexistence when the child was learning to count, and was used by him\r\nas a natural mnemonic diagram, to which he referred the spoken words\r\n\"one,\" \"two,\" \"three,\" etc. Also, that as soon as he began to read,\r\nthe visual symbol figures supplanted their verbal sounds, and\r\npermanently established themselves on the Form. It therefore existed\r\nat an earlier date than that at which the child began to learn to\r\nread; it represents his mental processes at a time of which no other\r\nrecord remains; it persists in vigorous activity, and offers itself\r\nfreely to our examination.\r\n\r\nThe teachers of many schools and colleges, some in America, have\r\nkindly questioned their pupils for me; the results are given in the\r\ntwo first columns of Plate I. It appears that the proportion of\r\nyoung people who see numerals in Forms is greater than that of adults.\r\nBut for the most part their Forms are neither well defined nor\r\ncomplicated. I conclude that when they are too faint to be of\r\nservice they are gradually neglected, and become wholly forgotten;\r\nwhile if they are vivid and useful, they increase in vividness and\r\ndefinition by the effect of habitual use. Hence, in adults, the two\r\nclasses of seers and non-seers are rather sharply defined, the\r\nconnecting link of intermediate cases which is observable in\r\nchildhood having disappeared.\r\n\r\nThese Forms are the most remarkable existing instances of what is\r\ncalled \"topical\" memory, the essence of which appears to lie in the\r\nestablishment of a more exact system of division of labour in the\r\ndifferent parts of the brain, than is usually carried on. Topical\r\naids to memory are of the greatest service to many persons, and\r\nteachers of mnemonics make large use of them, as by advising a\r\nspeaker to mentally associate the corners, etc., of a room with the\r\nchief divisions of the speech he is about to deliver. Those who feel\r\nthe advantage of these aids most strongly are the most likely to\r\ncultivate the use of numerical forms. I have read many books on\r\nmnemonics, and cannot doubt their utility to some persons; to myself\r\nthe system is of no avail whatever, but simply a stumbling-block,\r\nnevertheless I am well aware that many of my early associations are\r\nfanciful and silly.\r\n\r\nThe question remains, why do the lines of the Forms run in such\r\nstrange and peculiar ways? the reply is, that different persons have\r\nnatural fancies for different lines and curves. Their handwriting\r\nshows this, for handwriting is by no means solely dependent on the\r\nbalance of the muscles of the hand, causing such and such strokes to\r\nbe made with greater facility than others. Handwriting is greatly\r\nmodified by the fashion of the time. It is in reality a compromise\r\nbetween what the writer most likes to produce, and what he can\r\nproduce with the greatest ease to himself. I am sure, too, that I\r\ncan trace a connection between the general look of the handwritings\r\nof my various correspondents and the lines of their Forms. If a\r\nspider were to visualise numerals, we might expect he would do so in\r\nsome web-shaped fashion, and a bee in hexagons. The definite\r\ndomestic architecture of all animals as seen in their nests and\r\nholes shows the universal tendency of each species to pursue their\r\nwork according to certain definite lines and shapes, which are to\r\nthem instinctive and in no way, we may presume, logical. The same is\r\nseen in the groups and formations of flocks of gregarious animals\r\nand in the flights of gregarious birds, among which the wedge-shaped\r\nphalanx of wild ducks and the huge globe of soaring storks are as\r\nremarkable as any.\r\n\r\nI used to be much amused during past travels in watching the\r\ndifferent lines of search that were pursued by different persons in\r\nlooking for objects lost on the ground, when the encampment was\r\nbeing broken up. Different persons had decided idiosyncracies, so\r\nmuch so that if their travelling line of sight could have scored a\r\nmark on the ground, I think the system of each person would have\r\nbeen as characteristic as his Number-Form.\r\n\r\nChildren learn their figures to some extent by those on the clock. I\r\ncannot, however, trace the influence of the clock on the Forms in\r\nmore than a few cases. In two of them the clock-face actually appears,\r\nin others it has evidently had a strong influence, and in the rest\r\nits influence is indicated, but nothing more. I suppose that the\r\ncomplex Roman numerals in the clock do not fit in sufficiently well\r\nwith the simpler ideas based upon the Arabic ones.\r\n\r\nThe other traces of the origin of the Forms that appear here and\r\nthere, are dominoes, cards, counters, an abacus, the fingers,\r\ncounting by coins, feet and inches (a yellow carpenter's rule\r\nappears in one case with 56 in large figures upon it), the country\r\nsurrounding the child's home, with its hills and dales, objects in\r\nthe garden (one scientific man sees the old garden walk and the\r\nnumeral 7 at a tub sunk in the ground where his father filled his\r\nwatering-pot). Some associations seem connected with the objects\r\nspoken of in the doggerel verses by which children are often taught\r\ntheir numbers.\r\n\r\nBut the paramount influence proceeds from the names of the numerals.\r\nOur nomenclature is perfectly barbarous, and that of other civilised\r\nnations is not better than ours, and frequently worse, as the French\r\n\"quatre-vingt dix-huit,\" or \"four score, ten and eight,\" instead of\r\nninety-eight. We speak of ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, etc., in\r\ndefiance of the beautiful system of decimal notation in which we\r\nwrite those numbers. What we see is one-naught, one-one, one-two, etc.,\r\nand we should pronounce on that principle, with this proviso, that\r\nthe word for the \"one\" having to show both the place and the value,\r\nshould have a sound suggestive of \"one\" but not identical with it.\r\nLet us suppose it to be the letter _o_ pronounced short as in\r\n\"on,\" then instead of ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, etc., we might\r\nsay _on-naught, on-one, on-two, on-three_, etc.\r\n\r\nThe conflict between the two systems creates a perplexity, to which\r\nconclusive testimony is borne by these numerical forms. In most of\r\nthem there is a marked hitch at the 12, and this repeats itself at\r\nthe 120. The run of the lines between 1 and 20 is rarely analogous\r\nto that between 20 and 100, where it usually first becomes regular.\r\nThe 'teens frequently occupy a larger space than their due. It is not\r\neasy to define in words the variety of traces of the difficulty and\r\nannoyance caused by our unscientific nomenclature, that are\r\nportrayed vividly, and, so to speak, painfully in these pictures.\r\nThey are indelible scars that testify to the effort and ingenuity\r\nwith which a sort of compromise was struggled for and has finally\r\nbeen effected between the verbal and decimal systems. I am sure that\r\nthis difficulty is more serious and abiding than has been suspected,\r\nnot only from the persistency of these twists, which would have long\r\nsince been smoothed away if they did not continue to subserve some\r\nuseful purpose, but also from experiments on my own mind. I find I\r\ncan deal mentally with simple sums with much less strain if I\r\naudibly conceive the figures as on-naught, on-one, etc., and I can\r\nboth dictate and write from dictation with much less trouble when\r\nthat system or some similar one is adopted. I have little doubt that\r\nour nomenclature is a serious though unsuspected hindrance to the\r\nready adoption by the public of a decimal system of weights and\r\nmeasures. Three quarters of the Forms bear a duodecimal impress.\r\n\r\nI will now give brief explanations of the Number-Forms drawn in\r\nPlates I., II., and III., and in the two front figures in Plate IV.\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF PLATE I.\r\n\r\nFig. 1 is by Mr. Walter Larden, science-master of Cheltenham College,\r\nwho sent me a very interesting and elaborate account of his own case,\r\nwhich by itself would make a memoir; and he has collected other\r\ninformation for me. The Number-Forms of one of his colleagues and of\r\nthat gentleman's sister are given in Figs. 53, 54, Plate III. I\r\nextract the following from Mr. Larden's letter--it is all for which\r\nI can find space:--\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE I. _Examples of Number-Forms_.]\r\n\r\n\"All numbers are to me as images of figures in general; I see them\r\nin ordinary Arabic type (except in some special cases), and they\r\nhave definite positions in space (as shown in the Fig.). Beyond 100\r\nI am conscious of coming down a dotted line to the position of 1\r\nagain, and of going over the same cycle exactly as before, _e.g._\r\nwith 120 in the place of 20, and so on up to 140 or 150. With higher\r\nnumbers the imagery is less definite; thus, for 1140, I can only say\r\nthat there are no new positions, I do not see the entire number in\r\nthe place of 40; but if I think of it as 11 hundred and 40, I see 40\r\nin its place, 11 in its place, and 100 in its place; the picture is\r\nnot single though the ideas combine. I seem to stand near 1. I have\r\nto turn somewhat to see from 30-40, and more and more to see from\r\n40-100; 100 lies high up to my right and behind me. I see no shading\r\nnor colour in the figures.\"\r\n\r\nFigs. 2 to 6 are from returns collected for me by the Rev. A.D. Hill,\r\nscience-master of Winchester College, who sent me replies from 135\r\nboys of an average age of 14-15. He says, speaking of their replies\r\nto my numerous questions on visualising generally, that they\r\n\"represent fairly those who could answer anything; the boys\r\ncertainly seemed interested in the subject; the others, who had no\r\nsuch faculty either attempting and failing, or not finding any\r\nresponse in their minds, took no interest in the inquiry.\" A very\r\nremarkable case of hereditary colour association was sent to me by\r\nMr. Hill, to which I shall refer later. The only five good cases of\r\nNumber-Forms among the 135 boys are those shown in the Figs. I need\r\nonly describe Fig. 2. The boy says:--\"Numbers, except the first\r\ntwenty, appear in waves; the two crossing-lines, 60-70, 140-150,\r\nnever appear at the _same time_. The first twelve are the image of a\r\nclock, and 13-20 a continuation of them.\"\r\n\r\nFigs. 7, 8, are sent me by Mr. Henry F. Osborn of Princeton in the\r\nUnited States, who has given cordial assistance in obtaining\r\ninformation as regards visualising generally. These two are the only\r\nForms included in sixty returns that he sent, 34 of which were from\r\nPrinceton College, and the remaining 26 from Vassar (female) College.\r\nFigs. 9-19 and Fig. 28 are from returns communicated by Mr. W.H.\r\nPoole, science-master of Charterhouse College, which are very\r\nvaluable to me as regards visualising power generally. He read my\r\nquestions before a meeting of about 60 boys, who all consented to\r\nreply, and he had several subsequent volunteers. All the answers\r\nwere short, straightforward, and often amusing. Subsequently the\r\ninquiry extended, and I have 168 returns from him in all, containing\r\n12 good Number-Forms, shown in Figs. 9-19, and in Fig. 28. The\r\nfirst Fig. is that of Mr. Poole himself; he says, \"The line only\r\nrepresents position; it does not exist in my mind. After 100, I\r\nreturn to my old starting-place, _e.g._ 140 occupies the same\r\nposition as 40.\"\r\n\r\nThe gross statistical result from the schoolboys is as follows:\r\n--Total returns, 337: viz. Winchester 135, Princeton 34, Charterhouse\r\n168; the number of these that contained well-defined Number-Forms\r\nare 5, 1, and 12 respectively, or total 18--that is, one in twenty.\r\nIt may justly be said that the masters should not be counted,\r\nbecause it was owing to the accident of their seeing the Number-Forms\r\nthemselves that they became interested in the inquiry; if this\r\nobjection be allowed, the proportion would become 16 in 337, or one\r\nin twenty-one. Again, some boys who had no visualising faculty at\r\nall could make no sense out of the questions, and wholly refrained\r\nfrom answering; this would again diminish the proportion. The\r\nshyness in some would help in a statistical return to neutralise the\r\ntendency to exaggeration in others, but I do not think there is much\r\nroom for correction on either head. Neither do I think it requisite\r\nto make much allowance for inaccurate answers, as the tone of the\r\nreplies is simple and straightforward. Those from Princeton, where\r\nthe students are older and had been specially warned, are remarkable\r\nfor indications of self-restraint. The result of personal inquiries\r\namong adults, quite independent of and prior to these, gave me the\r\nproportion of 1 in 30 as a provisional result for adults. This is as\r\nwell confirmed by the present returns of 1 in 21 among boys and\r\nyouths as I could have expected.\r\n\r\nI have not a sufficient number of returns from girls for useful\r\ncomparison with the above, though I am much indebted to Miss Lewis\r\nfor 33 reports, to Miss Cooper of Edgbaston for 10 reports from the\r\nfemale teachers at her school, and to a few other schoolmistresses,\r\nsuch as Miss Stones of Carmarthen, whose returns I have utilised in\r\nother ways. The tendency to see Number-Forms is certainly higher in\r\ngirls than in boys.\r\n\r\nFig. 20 is the Form of Mr. George Bidder, Q.C.; it is of much\r\ninterest to myself, because it was, as I have already mentioned,\r\nthrough the receipt of it and an accompanying explanation that my\r\nattention was first drawn to the subject. Mr. G. Bidder is son of\r\nthe late well-known engineer, the famous \"calculating boy\" of the\r\nbygone generation, whose marvellous feats in mental arithmetic were\r\na standing wonder. The faculty is hereditary. Mr. G. Bidder himself\r\nhas multiplied mentally fifteen figures by another fifteen figures,\r\nbut with less facility than his father. It has been again transmitted,\r\nthough in an again reduced degree, to the third generation. He says:\r\n--\r\n\r\n\"One of the most curious peculiarities in my own case is the\r\narrangement of the arithmetical numerals. I have sketched this to\r\nthe best of my ability. Every number (at least within the first\r\nthousand, and afterwards thousands take the place of units) is\r\nalways thought of by me in its own definite place in the series,\r\nwhere it has, if I may say so, a home and an individuality. I should,\r\nhowever, qualify this by saying that when I am multiplying together\r\ntwo large numbers, my mind is engrossed in the operation, and the\r\nidea of locality in the series for the moment sinks out of prominence.\"\r\n\r\nFig. 21 is that of Prof. Schuster, F.R.S., whose visualising powers\r\nare of a very high order, and who has given me valuable information,\r\nbut want of space compels me to extract very briefly. He says to the\r\neffect:--\r\n\r\n\"The diagram of numerals which I usually see has roughly the shape\r\nof a horse-shoe, lying on a slightly inclined plane, with the open\r\nend towards me. It always comes into view in front of me, a little\r\nto the left, so that the right hand branch of the horse-shoe, at the\r\nbottom of which I place 0, is in front of my left eye. When I move\r\nmy eyes without moving my head, the diagram remains fixed in space\r\nand does not follow the movement of my eye. When I move the head the\r\ndiagram unconsciously follows the movement, but I can, by an effort,\r\nkeep it fixed in space as before. I can also shift it from one part\r\nof the field to the other, and even turn it upside down. I use the\r\ndiagram as a resting-place for the memory, placing a number on it\r\nand finding it again when wanted. A remarkable property of the\r\ndiagram is a sort of elasticity which enables me to join the two\r\nends of the horse-shoe together when I want to connect 100 with 0.\r\nThe same elasticity causes me to see that part of the diagram on\r\nwhich I fix my attention larger than the rest.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Schuster makes occasional use of a simpler form of diagram,\r\nwhich is little more than a straight line variously divided, and\r\nwhich I need not describe in detail.\r\n\r\nFig. 22 is by Colonel Yule, C.B.; it is simpler than the others, and\r\nhe has found it to become sensibly weaker in later years; it is now\r\nfaint and hard to fix.\r\n\r\nFig. 23. Mr. Woodd Smith:--\r\n\r\n\"Above 200 the form becomes vague and is soon lost, except that 999\r\nis always in a corner like 99. My own position in regard to it is\r\ngenerally nearly opposite my own age, which is fifty now, at which\r\npoint I can face either towards 7-12, or towards 12-20, or 20-7, but\r\nnever (I think) with my back to 12-20.\"\r\n\r\nFig. 24. Mr. Roget. He writes to the effect that the first twelve\r\nare clearly derived from the spots in dominoes. After 100 there is\r\nnothing clear but 108. The form is so deeply engraven in his mind\r\nthat a strong effort of the will was required to substitute any\r\nartificial arrangement in its place. His father, the late Dr. Roget\r\n(well known for many years as secretary of the Royal Society), had\r\ntrained him in his childhood to the use of the _memoria technica_ of\r\nFeinagle, in which each year has its special place in the walls of a\r\nparticular room, and the rooms of a house represent successive\r\ncenturies, but he never could locate them in that way. They _would_\r\ngo to what seemed their natural homes in the arrangement shown in\r\nthe figure, which had come to him from some unknown source.\r\n\r\nThe remaining Figs., 25-28, in Plate I., sufficiently express\r\nthemselves. The last belongs to one of the Charterhouse boys, the\r\nothers respectively to a musical critic, to a clergyman, and to a\r\ngentleman who is, I believe, now a barrister.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF PLATE II.\r\n\r\nPlate II. contains examples of more complicated Forms, which\r\nseverally require so much minuteness of description that I am in\r\ndespair of being able to do justice to them separately, and must\r\nleave most of them to tell their own story.\r\n\r\nFig. 34 is that of Mr. Flinders Petrie, to which I have already\r\nreferred (p. 66).\r\n\r\nFig. 37 is by Professor Herbert McLeod, F.R.S. I will quote his\r\nletter almost in full, as it is a very good example:--\r\n\r\n\"When your first article on visualised numerals appeared in _Nature_,\r\nI thought of writing to tell you of my own case, of which I had\r\nnever previously spoken to any one, and which I never contemplated\r\nputting on paper. It becomes now a duty to me to do so, for it is a\r\nfourth case of the influence of the clock-face. [In my article I had\r\nspoken of only three cases known to me.--F. G.] The enclosed paper\r\nwill give you a rough notion of the apparent positions of numbers in\r\nmy mind. That it is due to learning the clock is, I think, proved by\r\nmy being able to tell the clock certainly before I was four, and\r\nprobably when little more than three, but my mother cannot tell me\r\nthe exact date. I had a habit of arranging my spoon and fork on my\r\nplate to indicate the positions of the hands, and I well remember\r\nbeing astonished at seeing an old watch of my grandmother's which\r\nhad ordinary numerals in place of Roman ones. All this happened\r\nbefore I could read, and I have no recollection of learning the\r\nnumbers unless it was by seeing numbers stencilled on the barrels in\r\nmy father's brewery.\r\n\r\n\"When learning the numbers from 12 to 20, they appeared to be\r\nvertically above the 12 of the clock, and you will see from the\r\nenclosed sketch that the most prominent numbers which I have\r\nunderlined all occur in the multiplication table. Those doubly\r\nunderlined are the most prominent [the lithographer has not rendered\r\nthese correctly.--F. G.], and just now I caught myself doing what I\r\ndid not anticipate--after doubly underlining some of the numbers, I\r\nfound that all the multiples of 12 except 84 are so marked. In the\r\nsketch I have written in all the numbers up to 30; the others are\r\nnot added merely for want of space; they appear in their\r\ncorresponding positions. You will see that 21 is curiously placed,\r\nprobably to get a fresh start for the next 10. The loops gradually\r\ndiminish in size as the numbers rise, and it seems rather curious\r\nthat the numbers from 100 to 120 resemble in form those from 1 to 20.\r\nBeyond 144 the arrangement is less marked, and beyond 200 they\r\nentirely vanish, although there is some hazy recollection of a\r\nfutile attempt to learn the multiplication table up to 20 times 20.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE II. _Examples of Number Forms_.]\r\n\r\n\"Neither my mother nor my sister is conscious of any mental\r\narrangement of numerals. I have not found any idea of this kind\r\namong any of my colleagues to whom I have spoken on the subject, and\r\nseveral of them have ridiculed the notion, and possibly think me a\r\nlunatic for having any such feeling. I was showing the scheme to G.,\r\nshortly after your first article appeared, on the piece of paper I\r\nenclose, and he changed the diagram to a sea-serpent [most amusingly\r\nand grotesquely drawn.--F. G.], with the remark, 'If you were a rich\r\nman, and I knew I was mentioned in your will, I should destroy that\r\npiece of paper, in case it should be brought forward as an evidence\r\nof insanity!' I mention this in connection with a paragraph in your\r\narticle.\"\r\n\r\nFig. 40 is, I think, the most complicated form I possess. It was\r\ncommunicated to me by Mr. Woodd Smith as that of Miss L. K., a lady\r\nwho was governess in a family, whom he had closely questioned both\r\nwith inquiries of his own and by submitting others subsequently sent\r\nby myself. It is impossible to convey its full meaning briefly, and\r\nI am not sure that I understand much of the principle of it myself.\r\nA shows part only (I have not room for more) of the series 2, 3, 5, 7,\r\n10, 11, 13, 14, 17, 18, 19, each as two sides of a square,--that is,\r\nlarger or smaller according to the magnitude of the number; 1 does\r\nnot appear anywhere. C similarly shows part of the series (all\r\ndivisible by 3) of 6, 9, 15, 21, 27, 30, 33, 39, 60, 63, 66, 69, 90,\r\n93, 96. B shows the way in which most numbers divisible by 4 appear.\r\nD shows the form of the numbers 17, 18, 19, 21, 22, 23, 25, 26, 27,\r\n29, 41, 42-49, 81-83, 85-87, 89, 101-103, 105-107, and 109. E shows\r\nthat of 31, 33-35, 37-39. The other numbers are not clear, viz. 50,\r\n51, 53-55, 57-59. Beyond 100 the arrangement becomes hazy, except\r\nthat the hundreds and thousands go on again in complete, consecutive,\r\nand proportional squares indefinitely. The groups of figures are not\r\nseen together, but one or other starts up as the number is thought of.\r\nThe form has no background, and is always seen _in front_. No Arabic\r\nor other figures are seen with it. Experiments were made as to the\r\ntime required to get these images well in the mental view, by\r\nreading to the lady a series of numbers as fast as she could\r\nvisualise them. The first series consisted of twenty numbers of two\r\nfigures each--thus, 17, 28, 13, 52, etc.; these were gone through on\r\nthe first trial in 22 seconds, on the second in 16, and on the third\r\nin 26. The second series was more varied, containing numbers of one,\r\ntwo, and three figures--thus 121, 117, 345, 187, 13, 6, 25, etc.,\r\nand these were gone through in three trials in 25, 25, and 22 seconds\r\nrespectively, forming a general result of 23 seconds for twenty\r\nnumbers, or 2-1/3 seconds per number. A noticeable feature in this\r\ncase is the strict accordance of the scale of the image with the\r\nmagnitude of the number, and the geometric regularity of the figures.\r\nSome that I drew, and sent for the lady to see, did not at all\r\nsatisfy her eye as to their correctness.\r\n\r\nI should say that not a few mental calculators work by bulks rather\r\nthan by numerals; they arrange concrete magnitudes symmetrically in\r\nrank and file like battalions, and march these about. I have one\r\ncase where each number in a Form seems to bear its own _weight_.\r\n\r\nFig. 45 is a curious instance of a French Member of the Institute,\r\ncommunicated to me by M. Antoine d'Abbadie (whose own Number-Form is\r\nshown in Fig. 44):--\r\n\r\n\"He was asked, why he puts 4 in so conspicuous a place; he replied,\r\n'You see that such a part of my name (which he wishes to withhold)\r\nmeans 4 in the south of France, which is the cradle of my family;\r\nconsequently _quatre est ma raison d'être_.'\"\r\n\r\nSubsequently, in 1880, M. d'Abbadie wrote:--\r\n\r\n\"I mentioned the case of a philosopher whose, 4, 14, 24, etc., all\r\nstep out of the rank in his mind's eye. He had a haze in his mind\r\nfrom 60, I believe [it was 50.--F.G.], up to 80; but latterly 80 has\r\nsprung out, not like the sergeants 4, 14, 24, but like a captain,\r\nfarther out still, and five or six times as large as the privates 1,\r\n2, 3, 5, 6, etc. 'Were I superstitious,' said he, 'I should\r\nconclude that my death would occur in the 80th year of the century.'\r\nThe growth of 80 was _sudden_, and has remained constant ever since.\"\r\n\r\nThis is the only case known to me of a new stage in the development\r\nof a Number-Form being suddenly attained.\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF PLATE III.\r\n\r\nPlate III. is intended to exhibit some instances of heredity. I have\r\nno less than twenty-two families in which this curious tendency is\r\nhereditary, and there may be many more of which I am still ignorant.\r\nI have found it to extend in at least eight of these beyond the near\r\ndegrees of parent and child, and brother and sister. Considering that\r\nthe occurrence is so rare as to exist in only about one in every\r\ntwenty-five or thirty males, these results are very remarkable, and\r\ntheir trustworthiness is increased by the fact that the hereditary\r\ntendency is on the whole the strongest in those cases where the\r\nNumber-Forms are the most defined and elaborate. I give four\r\ninstances in which the hereditary tendency is found, not only in\r\nhaving a Form at all, but also in some degree in the shape of the\r\nForm.\r\n\r\nFigs. 46-49 are those of various members of the Henslow family,\r\nwhere the brothers, sisters, and some children of a sister have the\r\npeculiarity.\r\n\r\nFigs. 53-54 are those of a master of Cheltenham College and his\r\nsister.\r\n\r\nFigs. 55-56 are those of a father and son; 57 and 58 belong to the\r\nsame family.\r\n\r\nFigs. 59-60 are those of a brother and sister.\r\n\r\nThe lower half of the Plate explains itself. The last figure of all,\r\nFig. 65, is of interest, because it was drawn for an intelligent\r\nlittle girl of only 11 years old, after she had been closely\r\nquestioned by the father, and it was accompanied by elaborate\r\ncoloured illustrations of months and days of the week. I thought\r\nthis would be a good test case, so I let the matter drop for two\r\nyears, and then begged the father to question the child casually,\r\nand to send me a fresh account. I asked at the same time if any\r\nnotes had been kept of the previous letter. Nothing could have come\r\nout more satisfactorily. No notes had been kept; the subject\r\nhad passed out of mind, but the imagery remained the same, with some\r\ntrifling and very interesting metamorphoses of details.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLATE III. _Examples of an Hereditary Tendency to see\r\nNumber-Forms_, _4 Instances where the Number Forms in same family\r\nare alike_ _3 Instances where the Number-Forms in same family are\r\nunlike_]\r\n\r\n\r\nDESCRIPTION OF PLATE IV.\r\n\r\nI can find room in Plate IV. for only two instances of coloured\r\nNumber-Forms, though others are described in Plate III. Fig. 64 is\r\nby Miss Rose G. Kingsley, daughter of the late eminent writer the Rev.\r\nCharles Kingsley, and herself an authoress. She says:--\r\n\r\n\"Up to 30 I see the numbers in clear white; to 40 in gray; 40-50 in\r\nflaming orange; 50-60 in green; 60-70 in dark blue; 70 I am not sure\r\nabout; 80 is reddish, I think; and 90 is yellow; but these latter\r\ndivisions are very indistinct in my mind's eye.\"\r\n\r\nShe subsequently writes:--\r\n\r\n\"I now enclose my diagram; it is very roughly done, I am afraid, not\r\nnearly as well as I should have liked to have done it. My great fear,\r\nhas been that in thinking it over I might be led to write down\r\nsomething more than what I actually see, but I hope I have avoided\r\nthis.\"\r\n\r\nFig. 65 is an attempt at reproducing the form sent by Mr. George F.\r\nSmythe of Ohio, an American correspondent who has contributed much\r\nof interest. He says:--\r\n\r\n\"To me the numbers from 1 to 20 lie on a level plane, but from 20\r\nthey slope up to 100 at an angle of about 25°. Beyond 100 they are\r\ngenerally all on a level, but if for any reason I have to think of\r\nthe numbers from 100 to 200, or from 200 to 300, etc., then the\r\nnumbers, between these two hundreds, are arranged just as those from\r\n1 to 100 are. I do not, when thinking of a number, picture to\r\nmyself the figures which represent it, but I do think instantly of\r\nthe place which it occupies along the line. Moreover, in the case of\r\nnumbers from 1 to 20 (and, indistinctly, from 20 up to 28 or 30), I\r\nalways picture the number--not the figures--as occupying a\r\nright-angled parallelogram about twice as long as it is broad. These\r\nnumbers all lie down flat and extend in a straight line from 1 to 12\r\nover an unpleasant, arid, sandy plain. At 12 the line turns abruptly\r\nto the right, passes into a pleasanter region where grass grows, and\r\nso continues up to 20. At 20 the line turns to the left, and passes\r\nup the before-described incline to 100. This figure will help you in\r\nunderstanding my ridiculous notions. The asterisk (*) marks the\r\nplace where I commonly seem to myself to stand and view the line. At\r\ntimes I take other positions, but never any position to the left of\r\nthe (*), nor to the right of the line from 20 upwards. I do not\r\nassociate colours with numbers, but there is a great difference in\r\nthe illumination which different numbers receive. If a traveller\r\nshould start at 1 and walk to 100, he would be in an intolerable\r\nglare of light until near 9 or 10. But at 11 he would go into a land\r\nof darkness and would have to feel his way. At 12 light breaks in\r\nagain, a pleasant sunshine, which continues up to 19 or 20, where\r\nthere is a sort of twilight. From here to 40 the illumination is\r\nfeeble, but still there is considerable light. At 40 things light up,\r\nand until one reaches 56 or 57 there is broad daylight. Indeed the\r\ntract from 48 to 50 is almost as bad as that from 1 to 9. Beyond 60\r\nthere is a fair amount of light up to about 97, From this point to\r\n100 it is rather cloudy.\"\r\n\r\nIn a subsequent letter he adds:--\r\n\r\n\"I enclose a picture in perspective and colour of my 'form.' I have\r\ntaken great pains with this, but am far from satisfied with it. I\r\nknow nothing about drawing, and consequently am unable to put upon\r\nthe paper just what I see. The faults which I find with the picture\r\nare these. The rectangles stand out too distinctly, as something\r\nlying on the plane instead of being, as they ought, a part of the\r\nplane. The view is taken of necessity from an unnatural stand-point,\r\nand some way or other the region 1-12 does not look right. The\r\nlandscape is altogether too distinct in its features. I rather\r\n_know that there is_ grass, and that there are trees in the\r\ndistance, than _see_ them. But the grass within a few feet of the\r\nline I see distinctly. I cannot make the hill at the right slope\r\ndown to the plane as it ought. It is too steep. I have had my poor\r\nsuccess in indicating my notion of the darkness which overhangs the\r\nregion of eleven. In reality it is not a cloud at all, but a darkness.\r\n\r\n\"My sister, a married lady, thirty-eight years of age, sees numerals\r\nmuch as I do, but very indistinctly. She cannot draw a figure which\r\nis not by far too distinct.\"\r\n\r\nMost of those who associate colours with numerals do so in a vague\r\nway, impossible to convey with truth in a painting. Of the few who\r\nsee them with more objectivity, many are unable to paint or are\r\nunwilling to take the trouble required to match the precise colours\r\nof their fancies. A slight error in hue or tint always dissatisfies\r\nthem with their work.\r\n\r\nBefore dismissing the subject of numerals, I would call attention to\r\na few other associations connected with them. They are often\r\npersonified by children, and characters are assigned to them, it may\r\nbe on account of the part they play in the multiplication table, or\r\nowing to some fanciful association with their appearance or their\r\nsound. To the minds of some persons the multiplication table appears\r\ndramatised, and any chance group of figures may afford a plot for a\r\ntale. I have collated six full and trustworthy accounts, and find a\r\ncurious dissimilarity in the personifications and preferences; thus\r\nthe number 3 is described as (1) disliked; (2) a treacherous sneak;\r\n(3) a good old friend; (4) delightful and amusing; (5) a female\r\ncompanion to 2; (6) a feeble edition of 9. In one point alone do I\r\nfind any approach to unanimity, and that is in the respect paid to 12,\r\nas in the following examples:--(1) important and influential;\r\n(2) good and cautious--so good as to be almost noble; (3) a more\r\nbeautiful number than 10, from the many multiples that make it\r\nup--in other words, its kindly relations to so many small numbers;\r\n(4) a great love for 12, a large-hearted motherly person because of\r\nthe number of little ones that it takes, as it were, under its\r\nprotection. The decimal system seemed to me treason against this\r\nmotherly 12.--All this concurs with the importance assigned for\r\nother reasons to the number 12 in the Number-Form.\r\n\r\nThere is no agreement as to the sex of numbers; I myself had\r\nabsurdly enough fancied that _of course_ the even numbers would be\r\ntaken to be of the male sex, and was surprised to find that they\r\nwere not. I mention this as an example of the curious way in which\r\nour minds may be unconsciously prejudiced by the survival of some\r\nforgotten early fancies. I cannot find on inquiring of philologists\r\nany indications of different sexes having been assigned in any\r\nlanguage to different numbers.\r\n\r\nMr. Hershon has published an analysis of the Talmud, on the odd\r\nprinciple of indexing the various passages according to the number\r\nthey may happen to contain; thus such a phrase as \"there were three\r\nmen who,\" etc., would be entered under the number 3. I cannot find\r\nany particular preferences given there to especial numbers; even 7\r\noccurs less often than 1, 2, 3, 4, and 10. Their respective\r\nfrequency being 47, 54, 53, 64, 54, 51; 12 occurs only sixteen times.\r\nGamblers have not unfrequently the silliest ideas concerning numbers,\r\ntheir heads being filled with notions about lucky figures and\r\nbeautiful combinations of them. There is a very amusing chapter in\r\n_Rome Contemporaine_, by E. About, in which he speaks of this in\r\nconnection with the rage for lottery tickets.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLOUR ASSOCIATIONS.\r\n\r\nNumerals are occasionally seen in Arabic or other figures, not\r\ndisposed in any particular Form, but coloured. An instance of this\r\nis represented in Fig. 69 towards the middle part of the column, but\r\nas I shall have shortly to enter at length into the colour\r\nassociations of the author, I will pass over this portion of them,\r\nand will quote in preference from the letter of another correspondent.\r\n\r\nBaron von Osten Sacken, of whom I have already spoken, writes:--\r\n\r\n\"The localisation of numerals, peculiar to certain persons, is\r\nforeign to me. In my mind's eye the figures appear _in front_ of me,\r\nwithin a limited space. My peculiarity, however, consists in the\r\nfact that the numerals from 1 to 9 are differently coloured; (1)\r\nblack, (2) yellow, (3) pale brick red, (4) brown, (5) blackish gray,\r\n(6) reddish brown, (7) green, (8) bluish, (9) reddish brown,\r\nsomewhat like 6. These colours appear very distinctly when I think\r\nof these figures separately; in compound figures they become less\r\napparent. But the most remarkable manifestation of these colours\r\nappears in my recollections of chronology. When I think of the\r\nevents of a given century they invariably appear to me on a\r\nbackground coloured like the principal figure in the dates of that\r\ncentury; thus events of the eighteenth century invariably appear to\r\nme on a greenish ground, from the colour of the figure 7. This habit\r\nclings to me most tenaciously, and the only hypothesis I can form\r\nabout its origin is the following:--My tutor, when I was ten to\r\ntwelve years old, taught me chronology by means of a diagram on\r\nwhich the centuries were represented by squares, subdivided in 100\r\nsmaller squares; the squares representing centuries had _narrow\r\ncoloured borders_; it may be that in this way the recollection of\r\ncertain figures became associated with certain colours. I venture\r\nthis explanation without attaching too much importance to it, because\r\nit seems to me that if it was true, my _direct_ recollection of those\r\ncoloured borders would have been stronger than it is; still, the\r\nstrong association of my chronology with colour seems to plead in\r\nfavour of that explanation.\"\r\n\r\nFigs. 66, 67. These two are selected out of a large collection\r\nof coloured Forms in which the months of the year are visualised.\r\nThey will illustrate the gorgeousness of the mental imagery of\r\nsome favoured persons. Of these Fig. 66 is by the wife of an able\r\nLondon physician, and Fig. 67 is by Mrs. Kempe Welch, whose sister,\r\nMiss Bevington, a well-known and thoughtful writer, also sees\r\ncoloured imagery in connection with dates. This Fig. 67 was one\r\nof my test cases, repeated after the lapse of two years, and quite\r\nsatisfactorily. The first communication was a descriptive account,\r\npartly in writing, partly by word of mouth; the second, on my asking\r\nfor it, was a picture which agreed perfectly with the description,\r\nand explained much that I had not understood at the time. The small\r\nsize of the Fig. in the Plate makes it impossible to do justice to\r\nthe picture, which is elaborate and on a large scale, with a\r\nperspective of similar hills stretching away to the far distance,\r\nand each standing for a separate year. She writes:--\r\n\r\n\"It is rather difficult to give it fully without making it too\r\ndefinite; on each side there is a total blank.\"\r\n\r\nThe instantaneous association of colour with sound characterises a\r\nsmall percentage of adults, and it appears to be rather common,\r\nthough in an ill-developed degree, among children. I can here appeal\r\nnot only to my own collection of facts, but to those of others, for\r\nthe subject has latterly excited some interest in Germany. The first\r\nwidely known case was that of the brothers Nussbaumer, published in\r\n1873 by Professor Bruhl of Vienna, of which the English reader will\r\nfind an account in the last volume of Lewis's _Problems of Life and\r\nMind_ (p. 280). Since then many occasional notices of similar\r\nassociations have appeared. A pamphlet containing numerous cases was\r\npublished in Leipsic in 1881 by two Swiss investigators, Messrs.\r\nBleuler and Lehmann.[9] One of the authors had the faculty very\r\nstrongly, and the other had not; so they worked conjointly with\r\nadvantage. They carefully tabulated the particulars of sixty-two\r\ncases. As my present object is to subordinate details to the general\r\nimpression that I wish to convey of the peculiarities of different\r\nminds, I will simply remark--First, that the persistence of the\r\ncolour association with sounds is fully as remarkable as that of the\r\nNumber-Form with numbers. Secondly, that the vowel sounds chiefly\r\nevoke them. Thirdly, that the seers are invariably most minute in\r\ntheir description of the precise tint and hue of the colour. They\r\nare never satisfied, for instance, with saying \"blue,\" but will take\r\na great deal of trouble to express or to match the particular blue\r\nthey mean. Fourthly, that no two people agree, or hardly ever do so,\r\nas to the colour they associate with the same sound. Lastly, that\r\nthe tendency is very hereditary. The publications just mentioned\r\nabsolve me from the necessity of giving many extracts from the\r\nnumerous letters I have received, but I am particularly anxious to\r\nbring the brilliancy of these colour associations more vividly\r\nbefore the reader than is possible by mere description. I have\r\ntherefore given the elaborately-coloured diagrams in Plate IV., which\r\nwere copied by the artist directly from the original drawings, and\r\nwhich have been printed by the superimposed impressions of different\r\ncolours from different lithographic stones. They have been, on the\r\nwhole, very faithfully executed, and will serve as samples of the\r\nmost striking cases. Usually the sense of colour is much too vague\r\nto enable the seer to reproduce the various tints so definitely as\r\nthose in this Plate. But this is by no means universally the case.\r\n\r\nFig. 68 is an excellent example of the occasional association of\r\ncolours with letters. It is by Miss Stones, the head teacher in a\r\nhigh school for girls, who, as I have already mentioned, obtained\r\nuseful information for me, and has contributed several suggestive\r\nremarks of her own. She says:--\r\n\r\n\"The vowels of the English language always appear to me, when I\r\nthink of them, as possessing certain colours, of which I enclose a\r\ndiagram. Consonants, when thought of by themselves, are of a\r\npurplish black; but when I think of a whole word, the colour of the\r\nconsonants tends towards the colour of the vowels. For example, in\r\nthe word 'Tuesday,' when I think of each letter separately, the\r\nconsonants are purplish-black, _u_ is a light dove colour, _e_ is a\r\npale emerald green, and _a_ is yellow; but when I think of the whole\r\nword together, the first part is a light gray-green, and the latter\r\npart yellow. Each word is a distinct whole. I have always associated\r\nthe same colours with the same letters, and no effort will change\r\nthe colour of one letter, transferring it to another. Thus the word\r\n'red' assumes a light-green tint, while the word 'yellow' is\r\nlight-green at the beginning and red at the end. Occasionally, when\r\nuncertain how a word should be spelt, I have considered what colour\r\nit ought to be, and have decided in that way. I believe this has\r\noften been a great help to me in spelling, both in English and\r\nforeign languages. The colour of the letters is never smeared or\r\nblurred in any way. I cannot recall to mind anything that should\r\nhave first caused me to associate colours with letters, nor can my\r\nmother remember any alphabet or reading-book coloured in the way I\r\nhave described, which I might have used as a child. I do not\r\nassociate any idea of colour with musical notes at all, nor with any\r\nof the other senses.\"\r\n\r\nShe adds:--\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you may be interested in the following account from my\r\nsister of her visual peculiarities: 'When I think of Wednesday I see\r\na kind of oval flat wash of yellow emerald green; for Tuesday, a\r\ngray sky colour; for Thursday, a brown-red irregular polygon; and a\r\ndull yellow smudge for Friday.'\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Zwangmässige Lichtempfindungen durch Schall und\r\nverwandte Erscheinungen, von E. Bleuler und K. Lehmann. Leipsig, Fues'\r\nVerlag (R. Reisland), 1881.]\r\n\r\nThe latter quotation is a sample of many that I have; I give it\r\nmerely as another instance of hereditary tendency.\r\n\r\nI will insert just one description of other coloured letters than\r\nthose represented in the Plate. It is from Mrs. H., the married\r\nsister of a well-known man of science, who writes:--\r\n\r\n\"I do not know how it is with others, but to me the colours of\r\nvowels are so strongly marked that I hardly understand their\r\nappearing of a different colour, or, what is nearly as bad,\r\ncolourless to any one. To me they are and always have been, as long\r\nas I have known them, of the following tints:--\"\r\n\r\nA, pure white, and like china in texture.\r\n\r\nE, red, not transparent; vermilion, with china-white would represent\r\nit.\r\n\r\nI, light bright yellow; gamboge.\r\n\r\nO, black, but transparent; the colour of deep water seen through\r\nthick clear ice.\r\n\r\nU, purple.\r\n\r\nY, a dingier colour than I.\r\n\r\n\"The shorter sounds of the vowels are less vivid and pure in colour.\r\nConsonants are almost or quite colourless to me, though there is\r\nsome blackness about M.\r\n\r\n\"Some association with U in the words blue and purple may account\r\nfor that colour, and possibly the E in red may have to do with that\r\nalso; but I feel as if they were independent of suggestions of the\r\nkind.\r\n\r\n\"My first impulse is to say that the association lies solely in the\r\nsound of the vowels, in which connection I certainly feel it the\r\nmost strongly; but then the thought of the distinct redness of such\r\na [printed or written] word as '_great_' shows me that the relation\r\nmust be visual as well as aural. The meaning of words is so\r\nunavoidably associated with the sight of them, that I think this\r\nassociation rather overrides the primitive impression of the colour\r\nof the vowels, and the word '_violet_' reminds me of its proper\r\ncolour until I look at the word as a mere collection of letters.\r\n\r\n\"Of my two daughters, one sees the colours quite differently from\r\nthis (A, blue; E, white; I, black; O, whity-brownish; U, opaque brown).\r\nThe other is only heterodox on the A and O; A being with her black,\r\nand O white. My sister and I never agreed about these colours, and I\r\ndoubt whether my two brothers feel the chromatic force of the vowels\r\nat all.\"\r\n\r\nI give this instance partly on account of the hereditary interest. I\r\ncould add cases from at least three different families in which the\r\nheredity is quite as strongly marked.\r\n\r\nFig. 69 fills the whole of the middle column of Plate IV., and\r\ncontains specimens from a large series of coloured illustrations,\r\naccompanied by many pages of explanation from a correspondent,\r\nDr. James Key of Montagu, Cape Colony. The pictures will tell their\r\nown tale sufficiently well. I need only string together a few brief\r\nextracts from his letters, as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"I confess my inability to understand visualised numerals; it is\r\notherwise, however, with regard to colour associations with letters.\r\nEver since childhood these have been distinct and unchanging in my\r\nconsciousness; sometimes, although very seldom, I have mentioned them,\r\nto the amazement of my teachers and the scorn of my comrades. A is\r\nbrown. I say it most dogmatically, and nothing will ever have the\r\neffect, I am convinced, of making it appear otherwise! I can imagine\r\nno explanation of this association. [He goes into much detail as to\r\nconceivable reasons connected with his childish life to show that\r\nnone of these would do.] Shades of brown accompany to my mind the\r\nvarious degrees of openness in pronouncing A. I have never been\r\ndestitute in all my conscious existence of a conviction that E is a\r\nclear, cold, light-gray blue. I remember daubing in colours, when\r\nquite a little child, the picture of a jockey, whose shirt received\r\na large share of E, as I said to myself while daubing it with grey.\r\n[He thinks that the letter I may possibly be associated with black\r\nbecause it contains no open space, and O with white because it does.]\r\nThe colour of R has been invariably of a copper colour, in which a\r\nswarthy blackness seems to intervene, visually corresponding to the\r\ntrilled pronunciation of R. This same appearance exists also in J, X,\r\nand Z.\"\r\n\r\nThe upper row of Fig. 69 shows the various shades of brown,\r\nassociated with different pronunciations of the letter A, as in\r\n\"fame,\" \"can,\" \"charm,\" and \"all\" respectively. The second, third\r\nand fourth rows similarly refer to the various pronunciations of the\r\nother vowels. Then follow the letters of the alphabet, grouped\r\naccording to the character of the appearance they suggest. After\r\nthese come the numerals. Then I give three lines of words such as\r\nthey appear to him. The first is my own name, the second is\r\n\"London,\" and the third is \"Visualisation.\" Proceeding conversely,\r\nDr. Key collected scraps of various patterns of wall paper, and sent\r\nthem together with the word that the colour of the several patterns\r\nsuggested to him. Specimens of these are shown in the three bottom\r\nlines of the Fig. I have gone through the whole of them with care,\r\ntogether with his descriptions and reasons, and can quite understand\r\nhis meaning, and how exceedingly complex and refined these\r\nassociations are. The patterns are to him like words in poetry,\r\nwhich call up associations that any substituted word of a like\r\ndictionary meaning would fail to do. It would not, for example, be\r\npossible to print words by the use of counters coloured like those\r\nin Fig. 69, because the tint of each influences that of its\r\nneighbours. It must be understood that my remarks, though based on\r\nDr. Key's diagrams and statements as on a text, do not depend, by\r\nany means, wholly upon them, but on numerous other letters from\r\nvarious quarters to the same effect. At the same time I should say\r\nthat Dr. Key's elaborate drawings and ample explanations, to which I\r\nam totally unable to do justice in a moderate space, are the most\r\nfull and striking of any I have received. His illustrations are on a\r\nlarge scale, and are ingeniously arranged so as to express his\r\nmeaning.\r\n\r\nPersons who have colour associations are unsparingly critical. To\r\nordinary individuals one of these accounts seems just as wild and\r\nlunatic as another, but when the account of one seer is submitted to\r\nanother seer, who is sure to see the colours in a different way, the\r\nlatter is scandalised and almost angry at the heresy of the former.\r\nI submitted this very account of Dr. Key to a lady, the wife of an\r\nex-governor of one of the most important British possessions, who\r\nhas vivid colour associations of her own, and who, I had some reason\r\nto think, might have personal acquaintance with the locality where\r\nDr. Key lives. She could not comprehend his account at all, his\r\ncolours were so entirely different to those that she herself saw.\r\n\r\nI have now completed as much as I propose to say about the quaint\r\nphenomena of Visualised Forms of numbers and of dates, and of\r\ncoloured associations with letters. I shall not extend my remarks to\r\nsuch subjects as a musician hearing mental music, of which I have\r\nmany cases, nor to fancies concerning the other senses, as none of\r\nthese are so noteworthy. I am conscious that the reader may desire\r\neven more assurance of the trustworthiness of the accounts I have\r\ngiven than the space now at my disposal admits, or than I could\r\notherwise afford without wearisome iteration of the same tale, by\r\nmultiplying extracts from my large store of material. I feel, too,\r\nthat it may seem ungracious to many obliging correspondents not to\r\nhave made more evident use of what they have sent than my few and\r\nbrief notices permit. Still their end and mine will have been gained,\r\nif these remarks and illustrations succeed in leaving a just\r\nimpression of the vast variety of mental constitution that exists in\r\nthe world, and how impossible it is for one man to lay his mind\r\nstrictly alongside that of another, except in the rare instances of\r\nclose hereditary resemblance.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVISIONARIES.\r\n\r\nIn the course of my inquiries into visual memory, I was greatly\r\nstruck by the frequency of the replies in which my informants\r\ndescribed themselves as subject to \"visions.\" Those of whom I speak\r\nwere sane and healthy, but were subject notwithstanding to visual\r\npresentations, for which they could not account, and which in a few\r\ncases reached the level of hallucinations. This unexpected\r\nprevalence of a visionary tendency among persons who form a part of\r\nordinary society seems to me suggestive and well worthy of being put\r\non record. The images described by different persons varied greatly\r\nin distinctness, some were so faint and evanescent as to appear\r\nunworthy of serious notice; others left a deep impression, and\r\nothers again were so vivid as actually to deceive the judgment. All\r\nof these belong to the same category, and it is the assurance of\r\ntheir common origin that affords justification for directing\r\nscientific attention to what many may be inclined to contemptuously\r\ndisregard as the silly vagaries of vacant minds.\r\n\r\nThe lowest order of phenomena that admit of being classed as visions\r\nare the \"Number-Forms\" to which I have just drawn attention. They\r\nare in each case absolutely unchangable, except through a gradual\r\ndevelopment in complexity. Their diversity is endless, and the\r\nNumber-Forms of different persons are mutually unintelligible. These\r\nstrange \"visions,\" for such they must be called, are extremely vivid\r\nin some cases, but are almost incredible to the vast majority of\r\nmankind, who would set them down as fantastic nonsense; nevertheless,\r\nthey are familiar parts of the mental furniture of the rest, in\r\nwhose imaginations they have been unconsciously formed, and where\r\nthey remain unmodified and unmodifiable by teaching. I have received\r\nmany touching accounts of their childish experiences from persons\r\nwho see the Number-Forms, and other curious visions of which I have\r\nspoken or shall speak. As is the case with the colour-blind, so with\r\nthese seers. They imagined at first that everybody else had the same\r\nway of regarding things as themselves. Then they betrayed their\r\npeculiarities by some chance remark that called forth a stare of\r\nsurprise, followed by ridicule and a sharp scolding for their\r\nsilliness, so that the poor little things shrank back into themselves,\r\nand never ventured again to allude to their inner world. I will\r\nquote just one of many similar letters as a sample. I received it,\r\ntogether with much interesting information, immediately after a\r\nlecture I gave to the British Association at Swansea, in which I had\r\noccasion to speak of the Number-Forms. The writer says:--\r\n\r\n\"I had no idea for many years that every one did not imagine numbers\r\nin the same positions as those in which they appear to me. One\r\nunfortunate day I spoke of it, and was sharply rebuked for my\r\nabsurdity. Being a very sensitive child I felt this acutely, but\r\nnothing ever shook my belief that, absurd or not, I always saw\r\nnumbers in this particular way. I began to be ashamed of what I\r\nconsidered a peculiarity, and to imagine myself, from this and\r\nvarious other mental beliefs and states, as somewhat isolated and\r\npeculiar. At your lecture the other night, though I am now over\r\ntwenty-nine, the memory of my childish misery at the dread of being\r\npeculiar came over me so strongly that I felt I must thank you for\r\nproving that, in this particular at any rate, my case is most common.\"\r\n\r\nThe next sort of vision that flashes unaccountably into existence is\r\nthe instant association in some persons of colour with sound, which\r\nwas spoken of in the last chapter, and on which I need not say more\r\nnow.\r\n\r\nA third curious and abiding fantasy of certain persons is invariably\r\nto connect visualised pictures with words, the same picture to the\r\nsame word. These are perceived by many in a vague, fleeting, and\r\nvariable way, but to a few they appear strangely vivid and permanent.\r\nI have collected many cases of this peculiarity, and am much\r\nindebted to the authoress, Mrs. Haweis, who sees these pictures, for\r\nher kindness in sketching some of them for me, and for permitting me\r\nto use her name in guarantee of their genuineness. She says:--\r\n\r\n\"Printed words have always had faces to me; they had definite\r\nexpressions, and certain faces made me think of certain words. The\r\nwords had _no_ connection with these except sometimes by accident.\r\nThe instances I give are few and ridiculous. When I think of the\r\nword Beast, it has a face something like a gargoyle. The word Green\r\nhas also a gargoyle face, with the addition of big teeth. The word\r\nBlue blinks and looks silly, and turns to the right. The word\r\nAttention has the eyes greatly turned to the left. It is difficult\r\nto draw them properly because, like Alice's 'Cheshire cat,' which at\r\ntimes became a grin without a cat, these faces have expression\r\nwithout features. The expression of course\" [note the _naïve_ phrase\r\n\"of course.\"--F.G.] \"depends greatly on those of the letters, which\r\nhave likewise their faces and figures. All the little a's turn their\r\neyes to the left, this determines the eyes of Attention. Ant, however,\r\nlooks a little down. Of course these faces are endless as words are,\r\nand it makes my head ache to retain them long enough to draw.\"\r\n\r\nSome of the figures are very quaint. Thus the interrogation\r\n\"what?\" always excites the idea of a fat man cracking a long whip.\r\nThey are not the capricious creations of the fancy of the moment,\r\nbut are the regular concomitants of the words, and have been so as\r\nfar back as the memory is able to recall.\r\n\r\nWhen in perfect darkness, if the field of view be carefully watched,\r\nmany persons will find a perpetual series of changes to be going on\r\nautomatically and wastefully in it. I have much evidence of this. I\r\nwill give my own experience the first, which is striking to me,\r\nbecause I am very unimpressionable in these matters. I visualise\r\nwith effort; I am peculiarly inapt to see \"after-images,\" \"phosphenes,\"\r\n\"light-dust,\" and other phenomena due to weak sight or sensitiveness;\r\nand, again, before I thought of carefully trying, I should have\r\nemphatically declared that my field of view in the dark was\r\nessentially of a uniform black, subject to an occasional\r\nlight-purple cloudiness and other small variations. Now, however,\r\nafter habituating myself to examine it with the same sort of strain\r\nthat one tries to decipher a signpost in the dark, I have found out\r\nthat this is by no means the case, but that a kaleidoscopic change\r\nof patterns and forms is continually going on, but they are too\r\nfugitive and elaborate for me to draw with any approach to truth. I\r\nam astonished at their variety, and cannot guess in the remotest\r\ndegree the cause of them. They disappear out of sight and memory the\r\ninstant I begin to think about anything, and it is curious to me\r\nthat they should often be so certainly present and yet be habitually\r\noverlooked. If they were more vivid, the case would be very different,\r\nand it is most easily conceivable that some very slight\r\nphysiological change, short of a really morbid character, would\r\nenhance their vividness. My own deficiencies, however, are well\r\nsupplied by other drawings in my possession. These are by the Rev.\r\nGeorge Henslow, whose visions are far more vivid than mine. His\r\nexperiences are not unlike those of Goethe, who said, in an\r\noften-quoted passage, that whenever he bent his head and closed his\r\neyes and thought of a rose, a sort of rosette made its appearance,\r\nwhich would not keep its shape steady for a moment, but unfolded\r\nfrom within, throwing out a succession of petals, mostly red but\r\nsometimes green, and that it continued to do so without change in\r\nbrightness and without causing him any fatigue so long as he cared to\r\nwatch it. Mr. Henslow, when he shuts his eyes and waits, is sure in\r\na short time to see before him the clear image of some object or\r\nother, but usually not quite natural in its shape. It then begins to\r\nchange from one form to another, in his case also for as long a time\r\nas he cares to watch it. Mr. Henslow has zealously made repeated\r\nexperiments on himself, and has drawn what he sees. He has also tried\r\nhow far he is able to mould the visions according to his will. In\r\none case, after much effort, he contrived to bring the imagery back\r\nto its starting-point, and thereby to form what he terms a \"visual\r\ncycle.\" The following account is extracted and condensed from his\r\nvery interesting letter, and will explain the illustrations copied\r\nfrom his drawings that are given in Plate IV.\r\n\r\nFig. 70. The first image that spontaneously presented itself was a\r\ncross-bow (1); this was immediately provided with an arrow (2),\r\nremarkable for its pronounced barb and superabundance of feathering.\r\nSome person, but too indistinct to recognise much more of him than\r\nthe hands, appeared to shoot the arrow from the bow. The single\r\narrow was then accompanied by a flight of arrows from right to left,\r\nwhich completely occupied the field of vision. These changed into\r\nfalling stars, then into flakes of a heavy snowstorm; the ground\r\ngradually appeared as a sheet of snow where previously there had\r\nbeen vacant space. Then a well-known rectory, fish-ponds, walls, etc.,\r\nall covered with snow, came into view most vividly and clearly\r\ndefined. This somehow suggested another view, impressed on his mind\r\nin childhood, of a spring morning, brilliant sun, and a bed of red\r\ntulips: the tulips gradually vanished except one, which appeared now\r\nto be isolated and to stand in the usual point of sight. It was a\r\nsingle tulip, but became double. The petals then fell off rapidly in\r\na continuous series until there was nothing left but the pistil\r\n(3), but (as is almost invariably the case with his objects) that\r\npart was greatly exaggerated. The stigmas then changed into three\r\nbranching brown horns (4); then into a knob (5), while the stalk\r\nchanged into a stick. A slight bend in it seems to have suggested a\r\ncentre-bit (6); this passed into a sort of pin passing through a\r\nmetal plate (7), this again into a lock (8), and afterwards into a\r\nnondescript shape (9), distantly suggestive of the original cross-bow.\r\nHere Mr. Henslow endeavoured to force his will upon the visions, and\r\nto reproduce the cross-bow, but the first attempt was an utter\r\nfailure. The figure changed into a leather strap with loops (10), but\r\nwhile he still endeavoured to change it into a bow the strap broke,\r\nthe two ends were separated, but it happened that an imaginary\r\nstring connected them (11). This was the first concession of his\r\nautomatic chain of thoughts to his will. By a continued effort the\r\nbow came (12), and then no difficulty was felt in converting it into\r\nthe cross-bow, and thus returning to the starting-point. Fig. 71.\r\nMr. Henslow writes:--\r\n\r\n\"Though I can usually summon up any object thought of, it not only\r\nis somewhat different from the real thing, but it rapidly changes.\r\nThe changes are in many cases clearly due to a suggestiveness in the\r\narticle of something else, but not always so, as in some cases\r\nhereafter described. It is not at ail necessary to think of any\r\nparticular object at first, as something is sure to come\r\nspontaneously within a minute or two. Some object having once\r\nappeared, the automatism of the brain will rapidly induce the series\r\nof changes. The images are sometimes very numerous, and very rapid\r\nin succession: very frequently of great beauty and highly brilliant.\r\nCut glass (far more elaborate than I am conscious of ever having seen),\r\nhighly chased gold and silver filigree ornaments; gold and silver\r\nflower-stands, etc.; elaborate coloured patterns of carpets in\r\nbrilliant tints are not uncommon.\r\n\r\n\"Another peculiarity resides in the extreme restlessness of my\r\nvisual objects. It is often very difficult to keep them still, as\r\nwell as from changing in character. They will rapidly oscillate or\r\nelse rotate to a most perplexing degree, and when the characters\r\nchange at the same time a critical examination is almost impossible.\r\nWhen the process is in full activity, I feel as if I were a mere\r\nspectator at a diorama of a very eccentric kind, and was in no way\r\nconcerned with the getting up of the performance.\r\n\r\n\"When a succession of images has been passing, I sometimes _determine_\r\nto introduce an object, say a watch. Very often it is next to\r\nimpossible to succeed. There is an evident struggle. The watch,\r\npure and simple, will not come; but some hybrid structure\r\nappears--something round, perhaps--but it lapses into a warming-pan\r\nor other unexpected object.\r\n\r\n\"This practice has brought to my mind very clearly the distinction\r\nbetween at least one form of automatism of the brain and volition;\r\nbut the strength of the former is enormous, for the visual objects,\r\nwhen in full career of the change, are _imperative_ in their refusal\r\nto be interfered with.\r\n\r\n\"I will now describe the cases illustrated. Fig. 71. I thought of a\r\ngun. The _stock_ came into view, the metal plate on the end very\r\ndistinct towards the left (1). The wood was elaborately carved. I\r\ncannot recall the pattern. As I scrutinised it, the stock oscillated\r\nup and down, and _crumpled up_. The metallic plate sank inwards: and\r\nthe stock contracted so that it looked not unlike a tuning-fork\r\n(2). I gave up the stock and proceeded cautiously to examine the lock.\r\nI got it well into view, but no more of the gun. It turned out to be\r\nan old-fashioned flint-lock. It immediately began to nod backwards\r\nand forwards in a manner suggestive of the beak of a bird pecking.\r\nConsequently it forthwith became converted into the head of a bird\r\nwith a long curved beak, the knob on the lock (3) becoming the head\r\nof the bird. I then looked to the right expecting to find the barrel,\r\nbut the snout of a saw-fish with the tip _distinctly_ broken off\r\nappeared instead. I had not thought either of a _flint_-lock or of a\r\nsaw-fish: both came spontaneously.\r\n\r\n\"Fig. 72. I have several times thought of a rosebud, as Goethe is\r\nsaid to have been able to see one at will, and to observe it expand.\r\nThe following are some of the results:--The bud appeared\r\nunexpectedly a moss rosebud. Its only abnormal appearance was the\r\ninordinately elongated sepals (1). I tried to _force_ it to expand.\r\nIt enlarged but only partially opened (2), when all of a sudden it\r\nburst open and the petals became reflexed (3).[10]\r\n\r\n\"Fig. 73. The spontaneous appearance of a poppy capsule (1)\r\ndehiscing as usual by 'pores,' but with inordinately long and\r\narching valves over the pores. These valves were eminently\r\nsuggestive of hooded flowers. Hence they changed to a whorl of\r\n_salvias_ (2). Each blossom now gyrated rapidly in a vertical plane.\r\nConcentrating observation on _one_ rotating flower, it became a\r\n'rotating haze,' as the rapid motion rendered the flower totally\r\nindistinct. The 'haze' now shaped itself into a circle of moss with\r\na deep funnel-like cavity. This was suggestive of a bird's nest. It\r\nbecame lined with _hair_, but the nest was a _deep_, pointed cavity.\r\nA nest was suggestive of eggs. Hence a series appeared (4); the two\r\nrows meeting in one at the apex appears to have arisen from the\r\n_perspective_ view of the nest. The eggs all disappeared but one\r\n(5), which increased in size; the bright point of light now shone\r\nwith great intensity like a star; then it gradually grew dimmer and\r\ndimmer till it disappeared into the usual hazy obscurity into which\r\nall [my] visual objects ultimately vanish.\"\r\n\r\nI have a sufficient variety of cases to prove the continuity between\r\nall the forms of visualisation, beginning with an almost total\r\nabsence of it, and ending with a complete hallucination. The\r\ncontinuity is, however, not simply that of varying degrees of\r\nintensity, but of variations in the character of the process itself,\r\nso that it is by no means uncommon to find two very different forms\r\nof it concurrent in the same person. There are some who visualise\r\nwell, and who also are seers of visions, who declare that the vision\r\nis not a vivid visualisation, but altogether a different phenomenon.\r\nIn short, if we please to call all sensations due to external\r\nimpressions \"_direct\"_ and all others \"_induced_\" then there are\r\nmany channels through which the \"_induction_\" of the latter may\r\ntake place, and the channel of ordinary visualisation in the persons\r\njust mentioned is different from that through which their visions\r\narise.\r\n\r\nThe following is a good instance of this condition. A friend writes:\r\n--\r\n\r\n\"These visions often appear with startling vividness, and so far\r\nfrom depending on any voluntary effort of the mind, [10] they remain\r\nwhen I often wish them very much to depart, and no effort of the\r\nimagination can call them up. I lately saw a framed portrait of a\r\nface which seemed more lovely than any painting I have ever seen,\r\nand again I often see fine landscapes which bear no resemblance to\r\nany scenery I have ever looked upon. I find it difficult to define\r\nthe difference between a waking vision and a mental image, although\r\nthe difference is very apparent to myself. I think I can do it best\r\nin this way. If you go into a theatre and look at a scene--say of a\r\nforest by moonlight--at the back part of the stage you see every\r\nobject distinctly and sufficiently illuminated (being thus unlike a\r\nmere act of memory), but it is nevertheless vague and shadowy, and\r\nyou might have difficulty in telling afterwards all the objects you\r\nhave seen. This resembles a mental image in point of clearness. The\r\nwaking vision is like what one sees in the open street in broad\r\ndaylight, when every object is distinctly impressed on the memory.\r\nThe two kinds of imagery differ also as regards voluntariness, the\r\nimage being entirely subservient to the will, the visions entirely\r\nindependent of it. They differ also in point of suddenness, the\r\nimages being formed comparatively slowly as memory recalls each\r\ndetail, and fading slowly as the mental effort to retain them is\r\nrelaxed, the visions appearing and vanishing in an instant. The\r\nwaking visions seem quite close, filling as it were the whole head,\r\nwhile the mental image seems farther away in some far-off recess of\r\nthe mind.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: The details and illustrations of four other\r\nexperiments with the image of a rosebud have been given me. They all\r\nvary in detail.]\r\n\r\nThe number of sane persons who see visions no less distinctly than\r\nthis correspondent is much greater than I had any idea of when I\r\nbegan this inquiry. I have received an interesting sketch of one,\r\nprefaced by a description of it by Mrs. Haweis. She says:--\r\n\r\n\"All my life long I have had one very constantly-recurring vision, a\r\nsight which came whenever it was dark or darkish, in bed or otherwise.\r\nIt is a flight of pink roses floating in a mass from left to right,\r\nand this cloud or mass of roses is presently effaced by a flight of\r\n'sparks' or gold speckles across them. The sparks totter or vibrate\r\nfrom left to right, but they fly distinctly upwards; they are like\r\ntiny blocks, half gold, half black, rather symmetrically placed\r\nbehind each other, and they are always in a hurry to efface the roses;\r\nsometimes they have come at my call, sometimes by surprise, but they\r\nare always equally pleasing. What interests me most is that, when a\r\nchild under nine, the flight of roses was light, slow, soft, close\r\nto my eyes, roses so large and brilliant and palpable that I tried to\r\ntouch them; the _scent_ was overpowering, the petals perfect, with\r\nleaves peeping here and there, texture and motion all natural. They\r\nwould stay a long time before the sparks came, and they occupied a\r\nlarge area in black space. Then the sparks came slowly flying, and\r\ngenerally, not always, effaced the roses at once, and every effort\r\nto retain the roses failed. Since an early age the flight of roses\r\nhas annually grown smaller, swifter, and farther off, till by the\r\ntime I was grown up my vision had become a speck, so instantaneous\r\nthat I had hardly time to realise that it was there before the\r\nfading sparks showed that it was past. This is how they still come.\r\nThe pleasure of them is past, and it always depresses me to speak of\r\nthem, though I do not now, as I did when a child, connect the vision\r\nwith any elevated spiritual state. But when I read Tennyson's\r\n_Holy Grail_, I wondered whether anybody else had had my vision,\r\n'Rose-red, with beatings in it.' I may add, I was a London child who\r\nnever was in the country but once, and I connect no particular\r\nflowers with that visit. I may almost say that I had never seen a\r\nrose, certainly not a quantity of them together.\"\r\n\r\nA common form of vision is a phantasmagoria, or the appearance of a\r\ncrowd of phantoms, sometimes hurrying past like men in a street. It\r\nis occasionally seen in broad daylight, much more often in the dark;\r\nit may be at the instant of putting out the candle, but it generally\r\ncomes on when the person is in bed, preparing to sleep, but by no\r\nmeans yet asleep. I know no less than three men, eminent in the\r\nscientific world, who have these phantasmagoria in one form or\r\nanother. It will seem curious, but it is a fact that I know of no\r\nless than five editors of very influential newspapers who experience\r\nthese night visitations in a vivid form. Two of them have described\r\nthe phenomena very forcibly in print, but anonymously, and two\r\nothers have written on cognate experiences.\r\n\r\nA near relative of my own saw phantasmagoria very frequently. She\r\nwas eminently sane, and of such good constitution that her faculties\r\nwere hardly impaired until near her death at ninety. She frequently\r\ndescribed them to me. It gave her amusement during an idle hour to\r\nwatch these faces, for their expression was always pleasing, though\r\nnever strikingly beautiful. No two faces were ever alike, and no\r\nface ever resembled that of any acquaintance. When she was not well\r\nthe faces usually came nearer to her, sometimes almost suffocatingly\r\nclose. She never mistook them for reality, although they were very\r\ndistinct. This is quite a typical case, similar in most respects to\r\nmany others that I have.[1]\r\n\r\nA notable proportion of sane persons have had not only visions, but\r\nactual hallucinations of sight, sound, or other sense, at one or\r\nmore periods of their lives. I have a considerable packet of\r\ninstances contributed by my personal friends, besides a large number\r\ncommunicated to me by other correspondents. One lady, a\r\ndistinguished authoress, who was at the time a little fidgeted, but\r\nin no way overwrought or ill, assured me that she once saw the\r\nprincipal character of one of her novels glide through the door\r\nstraight up to her. It was about the size of a large doll, and it\r\ndisappeared as suddenly as it came. Another lady, the daughter of an\r\neminent musician, often imagines she hears her father playing. The\r\nday she told me of it the incident had again occurred. She was\r\nsitting in her room with her maid, and she asked the maid to open\r\nthe door that she might hear the music better. The moment the maid\r\ngot up the hallucination disappeared. Again, another lady,\r\napparently in vigorous health, and belonging to a vigorous family,\r\ntold me that during some past months she had been plagued by voices.\r\nThe words were at first simple nonsense; then the word \"pray\" was\r\nfrequently repeated; this was followed by some more or less coherent\r\nsentences of little import, and finally the voices left her. In short,\r\nthe familiar hallucinations of the insane are to be met with far\r\nmore frequently than is commonly supposed, among people moving in\r\nsociety and in good working health.\r\n\r\nI have now nearly done with my summary of facts; it remains to make\r\na few comments on them.\r\n\r\nThe weirdness of visions lies in their sudden appearance, in their\r\nvividness while present, and in their sudden departure. An incident\r\nin the Zoological Gardens struck me as a helpful simile. I happened\r\nto walk to the seal-pond at a moment when a sheen rested on the\r\nunbroken surface of the water. After waiting a while I became\r\nsuddenly aware of the head of a seal, black, conspicuous, [12] and\r\nmotionless, just as though it had always been there, at a spot on\r\nwhich my eye had rested a moment previously and seen nothing. Again,\r\nafter a while my eye wandered, and on its returning to the spot the\r\nseal was gone. The water had closed in silence over its head without\r\nleaving a ripple, and the sheen on the surface of the pond was as\r\nunbroken as when I first reached it. Where did the seal come from,\r\nand whither did it go? This could easily have been answered if the\r\nglare had not obstructed the view of the movements of the animal\r\nunder water. As it was, a solitary link in a continuous chain of\r\nactions stood isolated from all the rest. So it is with the visions;\r\na single stage in a series of mental processes emerges into the\r\ndomain of consciousness. All that precedes and follows lies outside\r\nof it, and its character can only be inferred. We see in a general\r\nway that a condition of the presentation of visions lies in the\r\nover-sensitiveness of certain tracks or domains of brain action and\r\nthe under-sensitiveness of others, certain stages in a mental\r\nprocess being represented very vividly in consciousness while the\r\nother stages are unfelt; also that individualism is changed to\r\ndividualism.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: See some curious correspondence on this subject in\r\nthe _St. James' Gazette_, Feb. 10, 15, and 20, 1882.]\r\n\r\nI do not recollect seeing it remarked that the ordinary phenomena of\r\ndreaming seem to show that partial sensitiveness is a normal\r\ncondition during sleep. They do so because one of the most marked\r\ncharacteristics of the dreamer is the absence of common sense. He\r\naccepts wildly incongruous visions without the slightest scepticism.\r\nNow common sense consists in the comprehension of a large number of\r\nrelated circumstances, and implies the simultaneous working of many\r\nparts of the brain. On the other hand, the brain is known to be\r\nimperfectly supplied with blood during sleep, and cannot therefore\r\nbe at full work. It is probable enough, from hydraulic analogies,\r\nthat imperfect irrigation would lead to partial irrigation, and\r\ntherefore to suppression of action in some parts of the brain, and\r\nthat this is really the case seems to be proved by the absence of\r\ncommon sense during dreams.\r\n\r\nA convenient distinction is made between hallucinations and illusions.\r\nHallucinations are defined as appearances wholly due to fancy;\r\nillusions, as fanciful perceptions of objects actually seen. There\r\nis also a hybrid case which depends on fanciful visions fancifully\r\nperceived. The problems we have to consider are, on the one hand,\r\nthose connected with \"_induced_\" vision, and, on the other hand,\r\nthose connected with the interpretation of vision, whether the\r\nvision be _direct_ or _induced_.\r\n\r\nIt is probable that much of what passes for hallucination proper\r\nbelongs in reality to the hybrid case, being an illusive\r\ninterpretation of some induced visual cloud or blur. I spoke of the\r\never-varying patterns in the optical field; these, under some slight\r\nfunctional change, may become more consciously present, and be\r\ninterpreted into fantasmal appearances. Many cases could be adduced\r\nto support this view.\r\n\r\nI will begin with illusions. What is the process by which they are\r\nestablished? There is no simpler way of understanding it than by\r\ntrying, as children often do, to see \"faces in the fire,\" and to\r\ncarefully watch the way in which they are first caught. Let us call\r\nto mind at the same time the experience of past illnesses, when the\r\nlistless gaze wandered over the patterns on the wall-paper and the\r\nshadows of the bed-curtains, and slowly evoked the appearances of\r\nfaces and figures that were not easily laid again. The process of\r\nmaking the faces is so rapid in health that it is difficult to\r\nanalyse it without the recollection of what took place more slowly\r\nwhen we were weakened by illness. The first essential element in\r\ntheir construction is, I believe, the smallness of the area covered\r\nby the glance at any instant, so that the eye has to travel over a\r\nlong track before it has visited every part of the object towards\r\nwhich the attention is directed generally. It is as with a plough,\r\nthat must travel many miles before the whole of a small field can be\r\ntilled, but with this important difference--the plough travels\r\nmethodically up and down in parallel furrows; the eye wanders in\r\ndevious curves, with abrupt bends, and the direction of its course\r\nat any instant depends on four causes: (1) on the easiest sequence\r\nof muscular motion, speaking in a general sense, (2) on idiosyncrasy,\r\n(3) on the mood, and (4) on the associations current at the moment.\r\nThe effect of idiosyncrasy ft excellently illustrated by the\r\n\"Number-Forms,\" where we observe that a very special sharply-defined\r\ntrack of mental vision is preferred by each individual who sees them.\r\nThe influence of the mood of the moment is shown in the curves that\r\nare felt appropriate to the various emotions, as the lank drooping\r\nlines of grief, which make the weeping willow so fit an emblem of it.\r\nIn constructing fire-faces it seems to me that the eye in its\r\nwanderings tends to follow a favourite course, and it especially\r\ndwells upon the marks that happen to coincide with that course. It\r\nfeels its way, easily diverted by associations based on what has\r\njust been noticed, until at last, by the unconscious practice of a\r\nsystem of \"trial and error,\" it hits upon a track that will\r\nsuit--one that is easily run over and that strings together\r\naccidental marks in a way that happens to form a well-connected\r\npicture. This fancy picture is then dwelt upon; all that is\r\nincongruous with it becomes disregarded, while all deficiencies in\r\nit are supplied by the fantasy. The latest stages of the process\r\nmight be represented by a diorama. Three lanterns would converge on\r\nthe same screen. The first throws an image of what the imagination\r\nwill discard, the second of that which it will retain, the third of\r\nthat which it will supply. Turn on the first and second, and the\r\npicture on the screen will be identical with that which fell on the\r\nretina. Shut off the first and turn on the third, and the picture\r\nwill be identical with the illusion.\r\n\r\nTurner the painter made frequent use of a practice analogous to that\r\nof looking for fire-faces in the burning coals; he was known to give\r\ncolours to children to daub in play on paper, while he keenly\r\nwatched for suggestive but accidental combinations.\r\n\r\nI have myself had frequent experience of the automatic construction\r\nof fantastic figures, through a practice I have somewhat encouraged\r\nfor the purpose, of allowing my hand to scribble at its own will,\r\nwhile I am giving my best attention to what is being said by others,\r\nas at small committees. It is always a surprise to me to see the\r\nresult whenever I turn my thoughts on what I have been subconsciously\r\ndoing. I can rarely recollect even a few of the steps by which the\r\ndrawings were made; they grew piece-meal, with some almost forgotten\r\nnotice, from time to time, of the sketch as a whole. I can trace no\r\nlikeness between what I draw and the images that present themselves\r\nto me in dreams, and I find that a very trifling accident, such as a\r\nchance dot on the paper, may have great influence on the general\r\ncharacter of any one of these automatic sketches.\r\n\r\nVisions, like dreams, are often mere patchworks built up of bits of\r\nrecollections. The following is one of these:--\r\n\r\n\"When passing a shop in Tottenham Court Road, I went in to order a\r\nDutch cheese, and the proprietor (a bullet-headed man whom I had\r\nnever seen before) rolled a cheese on the marble slab of his counter,\r\nasking me if that one would do. I answered 'Yes,' left the shop, and\r\nthought no more of the incident. The following evening, on closing\r\nmy eyes, I saw a head detached from the body rolling about slightly\r\non a white surface. I recognised the face, but could not remember\r\nwhere I had seen it, and it was only after thinking about it for\r\nsome time that I identified it as that of the cheesemonger who had\r\nsold me the cheese on the previous day. I may mention that I have\r\noften seen the man since, and that I found the vision I saw was\r\nexactly like him, although if I had been asked to describe the man\r\nbefore I saw the vision I should have been unable to do so.\"\r\n\r\nRecollections need not be combined like mosaic work; they may be\r\nblended, on the principle of composite portraiture. I suspect that\r\nthe phantasmagoria may be in some part due to blended memories; the\r\nnumber of possible combinations would be practically endless, and\r\neach combination would give a new face. There would thus be no limit\r\nto the dies in the coinage of the brain.\r\n\r\nI have found that the peculiarities of visualisation, such as the\r\ntendency to see Number-Forms, and the still rarer tendency to\r\nassociate colour with sound, is strongly hereditary, and I should\r\ninfer, what facts seem to confirm, that the tendency to be a seer of\r\nvisions is equally so. Under these circumstances we should expect\r\nthat it would be unequally developed in different races, and that a\r\nlarge natural gift of the visionary faculty might become\r\ncharacteristic not only of certain families, as among the\r\nsecond-sight seers of Scotland, but of certain races, as that of the\r\nGipsies.\r\n\r\nIt happens that the mere acts of fasting, of want of sleep, and of\r\nsolitary musing, are severally conducive to visions. I have myself\r\nbeen told of cases in which persons accidentally long deprived of\r\nfood became for a brief time subject to them. One was of a pleasure\r\nparty driven out to sea, and not being able to reach the coast till\r\nnightfall, at a place where they got shelter but nothing to eat.\r\nThey were mentally at ease and conscious of safety, but all were\r\ntroubled with visions that were half dreams and half hallucinations.\r\nThe cases of visions following protracted wakefulness are well known,\r\nand I have collected a few of them myself. I have already spoken of\r\nthe maddening effect of solitariness: its influence may be inferred\r\nfrom the recognised advantages of social amusements in the treatment\r\nof the insane. It follows that the spiritual discipline undergone\r\nfor purposes of self-control and self-mortification, have also the\r\nincidental effect of producing visions. It is to be expected that\r\nthese should often bear a close relation to the prevalent subjects\r\nof thought, and although they may be really no more than the\r\nproducts of one portion of the brain, which another portion of the\r\nsame brain is engaged in contemplating, they often, through error,\r\nreceive a religious sanction. This is notably the case among\r\nhalf-civilised races.\r\n\r\nThe number of great men who have been once, twice, or more frequently,\r\nsubject to hallucinations is considerable. A list, to which it would\r\nbe easy to make large additions, is given by Brierre de Boismont\r\n(_Hallucinations_, etc., 1862), from whom I translate the following\r\naccount of the star of the first Napoleon, which he heard,\r\nsecond-hand, from General Rapp:--\r\n\r\n\"In 1806 General Rapp, on his return from the siege of Dantzic,\r\nhaving occasion to speak to the Emperor, entered his study without\r\nbeing announced. He found him so absorbed that his entry was\r\nunperceived. The General seeing the Emperor continue motionless,\r\nthought he might be ill, and purposely made a noise. Napoleon\r\nimmediately roused himself, and without any preamble, seizing Rapp\r\nby the arm, said to him, pointing to the sky, 'Look there, up there.'\r\nThe General remained silent, but on being asked a second time, he\r\nanswered that he perceived nothing. 'What!' replied the Emperor,\r\n'you do not see it? It is my star, it is before you, brilliant;'\r\nthen animating by degrees, he cried out, 'it has never abandoned me,\r\nI see it on all great occasions, it commands me to go forward, and\r\nit is a constant sign of good fortune to me.'\"\r\n\r\nNapoleon was no doubt a consummate actor, ready and unscrupulous in\r\nimposing on others, but I see no reason to distrust the genuineness\r\nof this particular outburst, seeing that it is not the only instance\r\nof his referring to the guidance of his star, as a literal vision\r\nand not as a mere phrase, and that his belief in destiny was\r\nnotorious.\r\n\r\nIt appears that stars of this kind, so frequently spoken of in\r\nhistory, and so well known as a metaphor in language, are a common\r\nhallucination of the insane. Brierre de Boismont has a chapter on\r\nthe stars of great men. I cannot doubt that visions of this\r\ndescription were in some cases the basis of that firm belief in\r\nastrology, which not a few persons of eminence formerly entertained.\r\n\r\nThe hallucinations of great men may be accounted for in part by\r\ntheir sharing a tendency which we have seen to be not uncommon in\r\nthe human race, and which, if it happens to be natural to them, is\r\nliable to be developed in their overwrought brains by the isolation\r\nof their lives. A man in the position of the first Napoleon could\r\nhave no intimate associates; a great philosopher who explores ways\r\nof thought far ahead of his contemporaries must have an inner world\r\nin which he passes long and solitary hours. Great men may be even\r\nindebted to touches of madness for their greatness; the ideas by\r\nwhich they are haunted, and to whose pursuit they devote themselves,\r\nand by which they rise to eminence, having much in common with the\r\nmonomania of insanity. Striking instances of great visionaries may\r\nbe mentioned, who had almost beyond doubt those very nervous seizures\r\nwith which the tendency to hallucinations is intimately connected.\r\nTo take a single instance, Socrates, whose _daimon_ was an audible\r\nnot a visual appearance, was, as has been often pointed out, subject\r\nto cataleptic seizure, standing all night through in a rigid attitude.\r\n\r\nIt is remarkable how largely the visionary temperament has\r\nmanifested itself in certain periods of history and epochs of\r\nnational life. My interpretation of the matter, to a certain extent,\r\nis this--That the visionary tendency is much more common among sane\r\npeople than is generally suspected. In early life, it seems to be a\r\nhard lesson to an imaginative child to distinguish between the real\r\nand visionary world. If the fantasies are habitually laughed at and\r\notherwise discouraged, the child soon acquires the power of\r\ndistinguishing them; any incongruity or nonconformity is quickly\r\nnoted, the visions are found out and discredited, and are no further\r\nattended to. In this way the natural tendency to see them is\r\nblunted by repression. Therefore, when popular opinion is of a\r\nmatter-of-fact kind, the seers of visions keep quiet; they do not\r\nlike to be thought fanciful or mad, and they hide their experiences,\r\nwhich only come to light through inquiries such as these that I have\r\nbeen making. But let the tide of opinion change and grow favourable\r\nto supernaturalism, then the seers of visions come to the front. The\r\nfaintly-perceived fantasies of ordinary persons become invested by\r\nthe authority of reverend men with a claim to serious regard; they\r\nare consequently attended to and encouraged, and they increase in\r\ndefinition through being habitually dwelt upon. We need not suppose\r\nthat a faculty previously non-existent has been suddenly evoked, but\r\nthat a faculty long smothered by many in secret has been suddenly\r\nallowed freedom to express itself, and to run into extravagance\r\nowing to the removal of reasonable safeguards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNURTURE AND NATURE.\r\n\r\nMan is so educable an animal that it is difficult to distinguish\r\nbetween that part of his character which has been acquired through\r\neducation and circumstance, and that which was in the original grain\r\nof his constitution. His character is exceedingly complex, even in\r\nmembers of the simplest and purest savage race; much more is it so in\r\ncivilised races, who have long since been exempted from the full\r\nrigour of natural selection, and have become more mongrel in their\r\nbreed than any other animal on the face of the earth. Different\r\naspects of the multifarious character of man respond to different\r\ncalls from without, so that the same individual, and, much more, the\r\nsame race, may behave very differently at different epochs. There\r\nmay have been no fundamental change of character, but a different\r\nphase or mood of it may have been evoked by special circumstances,\r\nor those persons in whom that mood is naturally dominant may through\r\nsome accident have the opportunity of acting for the time as\r\nrepresentatives of the race. The same nation may be seized by a\r\nmilitary fervour at one period, and by a commercial one at another;\r\nthey may be humbly submissive to a monarch, or become outrageous\r\nrepublicans. The love of art, gaiety, adventure, science, religion\r\nmay be severally paramount at different times.\r\n\r\nOne of the most notable changes that can come over a nation is from\r\na state corresponding to that of our past dark ages into one like\r\nthat of the Renaissance. In the first case the minds of men are\r\nwholly taken up with routine work, and in copying what their\r\npredecessors have done; they degrade into servile imitators and\r\nsubmissive slaves to the past. In the second case, some circumstance\r\nor idea has finally discredited the authorities that impeded\r\nintellectual growth, and has unexpectedly revealed new possibilities.\r\nThen the mind of the nation is set free, a direction of research is\r\ngiven to it, and all the exploratory and hunting instincts are\r\nawakened. These sudden eras of great intellectual progress cannot be\r\ndue to any alteration in the natural faculties of the race, because\r\nthere has not been time for that, but to their being directed in\r\nproductive channels. Most of the leisure of the men of every nation\r\nis spent in rounds of reiterated actions; if it could be spent in\r\ncontinuous advance along new lines of research in unexplored regions,\r\nvast progress would be sure to be made. It has been the privilege of\r\nthis generation to have had fresh fields of research pointed out to\r\nthem by Darwin, and to have undergone a new intellectual birth under\r\nthe inspiration of his fertile genius.\r\n\r\nA pure love of change, acting according to some law of contrast as\r\nyet imperfectly understood, especially characterises civilised man.\r\nAfter a long continuance of one mood he wants to throw himself into\r\nanother for the pleasure of setting faculties into action that have\r\nbeen long disused, but not yet paralysed by disuse, and which have\r\nbecome fidgety for employment. He has so many opportunities for\r\nprocuring change, and has so complex a nature that he easily learns\r\nto neglect a more deeply-seated feeling that innovation is wicked,\r\nand which is manifest in children and barbarians. To a civilised man\r\nthe varied interests of civilisation are temptations in as many\r\ndirections; changes in dress and appliances of all kinds are\r\ncomparatively inexpensive to him owing to the cheapness of\r\nmanufactures and their variety; change of scene is easy from the\r\nconveniences of locomotion. But a barbarian has none of these\r\nfacilities: his interests are few; his dress, such as it is, is\r\nintended to stand the wear and tear of years, and all weathers; it\r\nis relatively very costly, and is an investment, one may say, of his\r\ncapital rather than of his income; the invention of his people is\r\nsluggish, and their arts are few, consequently he is perforce taught\r\nto be conservative, his ideas are fixed, and he becomes scandalised\r\neven at the suggestion of change.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of indulging in variety is incomparably greater among\r\nthe rest of the animal world. If a pea-hen should take it into her\r\nhead that bars would be prettier than eyes in the tail of her spouse,\r\nshe could not possibly get what she wanted. It would require\r\nhundreds of generations in which the pea-hens generally concurred in\r\nthe same view before sexual selection could effect the desired\r\nalteration. The feminine delight of indulging her caprice in matters\r\nof ornament is a luxury denied to the females of the brute world,\r\nand the law that rules changes in taste, if studied at all, can only\r\nbe ascertained by observing the alternations of fashion in civilised\r\ncommunities.\r\n\r\nThere are long sequences of changes in character, which, like the\r\ntunes of a musical snuff-box, are regulated by internal mechanism.\r\nThey are such as those of Shakespeare's \"Seven Ages,\" and others due\r\nto the progress of various diseases. The lives of birds are\r\ncharacterised by long chains of these periodic sequences. They are\r\nmostly mute in winter, after that they begin to sing; some species\r\nare seized in the early part of the year with so strong a passion\r\nfor migrating that if confined in a cage they will beat themselves\r\nto death against its bars; then follow courtship and pairing,\r\naccompanied by an access of ferocity among the males and severe\r\nfighting for the females. Next an impulse seizes them to build nests,\r\nthen a desire for incubation, then one for the feeding of their young.\r\nAfter this a newly-arisen tendency to gregariousness groups them\r\ninto large flocks, and finally they fly away to the place whence they\r\ncame, goaded by a similar instinct to that which drove them forth a\r\nfew months previously. These remarkable changes are mainly due to\r\nthe conditions of their natures, because they persist with more or\r\nless regularity under altered circumstances. Nevertheless, they are\r\nnot wholly independent of circumstance, because the period of\r\nmigration, though nearly coincident in successive years, is modified\r\nto some small extent by the weather and condition of the particular\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe interaction of nature and circumstance is very close, and it is\r\nimpossible to separate them with precision. Nurture acts before birth,\r\nduring every stage of embryonic and pre-embryonic existence, causing\r\nthe potential faculties at the time of birth to be in some degree\r\nthe effect of nurture. We need not, however, be hypercritical about\r\ndistinctions; we know that the bulk of the respective provinces of\r\nnature and nurture are totally different, although the frontier\r\nbetween them may be uncertain, and we are perfectly justified in\r\nattempting to appraise their relative importance.\r\n\r\nI shall begin with describing some of the principal influences that\r\nmay safely be ascribed to education or other circumstances, all of\r\nwhich I include under the comprehensive term of Nurture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nASSOCIATIONS.\r\n\r\nThe furniture of a man's mind chiefly consists of his recollections\r\nand the bonds that unite them. As all this is the fruit of experience,\r\nit must differ greatly in different minds according to their\r\nindividual experiences. I have endeavoured to take stock of my own\r\nmental furniture in the way described in the next chapter, in which\r\nit will be seen how large a part consists of childish recollections,\r\ntestifying to the permanent effect of many of the results of early\r\neducation. The same fact has been strongly brought out by the\r\nreplies from correspondents whom I had questioned on their mental\r\nimagery. It was frequently stated that the mental image invariably\r\nevoked by certain words was some event of childish experience or\r\nfancy. Thus one correspondent, of no mean literary and philosophical\r\npower, recollects the left hand by a mental reference to the\r\nrocking-horse which always stood by the side of the nursery wall\r\nwith its head in the same direction, and had to be mounted from the\r\nside next the wall. Another, a politician, historian, and scholar,\r\nrefers all his dates to the mental image of a nursery diagram of the\r\nhistory of the world, which has since developed huge bosses to\r\nsupport his later acquired information.\r\n\r\nOur abstract ideas being mostly drawn from external experiences,\r\ntheir character also must depend upon the events of our individual\r\nhistories. For example, the spoken words house and home must awaken\r\nideas derived from the houses and the homes with which the hearer is,\r\nin one way or other, acquainted, and these could not be the same to\r\npersons of various social positions and places of residence. The\r\ncharacter of our abstract ideas, therefore, depends, to a\r\nconsiderable degree, on our nurture.\r\n\r\nI doubt, however, whether \"abstract idea\" is a correct phrase in\r\nmany of the cases in which it is used, and whether \"cumulative idea\"\r\nwould not be more appropriate. The ideal faces obtained by the\r\nmethod of composite portraiture appear to have a great deal in\r\ncommon with these so-called abstract ideas. The composite portraits\r\nconsist, as was explained, of numerous superimposed pictures,\r\nforming a cumulative result in which the features that are common to\r\nall the likenesses are clearly seen; those that are common to a few\r\nare relatively faint and are more or less overlooked, while those\r\nthat are peculiar to single individuals leave no sensible trace at\r\nall.\r\n\r\nThis analogy, which I pointed out in a Memoir on Generic Images,\r\n[11] has been extended and confirmed by subsequent experience of the\r\nprocess. One objection to my view was that our so-called\r\ngeneralisations are commonly no more than representative cases, our\r\nrecollections being apt to be unduly influenced by particular events,\r\nand not by the totality of what we have seen; that the reason why\r\nsome one recollection has prevailed is that the case was sharply\r\ndefined, or had something unusual about it, or that our frame of\r\nmind was at the time of observation susceptible to that particular\r\nkind of impression. I have had exactly the same difficulties with\r\nthe composites. If one of the individual portraits has sharp outlines,\r\nor if it is unlike the rest, or if the illumination is temporarily\r\nstrong, it will assert itself unduly in the result. The cases seem\r\nto me exactly analogous. I get over my photographic difficulty very\r\neasily by throwing the sharp portrait a little out of focus, by\r\neliminating such portraits as have exceptional features, and by\r\ntoning down the illumination to a standard intensity.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: \"Generic Images,\" _Proc. Royal Institute_, Friday,\r\nApril 25, 1879, partly reprinted in the Appendix.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPSYCHOMETRIC EXPERIMENTS.\r\n\r\nWhen we attempt to trace the first steps in each operation of our\r\nminds, we are usually baulked by the difficulty of keeping watch,\r\nwithout embarrassing the freedom of its action. The difficulty is\r\nmuch more than the common and well-known one of attending to two\r\nthings at once. It is especially due to the fact that the elementary\r\noperations of the mind are exceedingly faint and evanescent, and\r\nthat it requires the utmost painstaking to watch them properly. It\r\nwould seem impossible to give the required attention to the\r\nprocesses of thought, and yet to think as freely as if the mind had\r\nbeen in no way preoccupied. The peculiarity of the experiments I am\r\nabout to describe is that I have succeeded in evading this difficulty.\r\nMy method consists in allowing the mind to play freely for a very\r\nbrief period, until a couple or so of ideas have passed through it,\r\nand then, while the traces or echoes of those ideas are still\r\nlingering in the brain, to turn the attention upon them with a\r\nsudden and complete awakening; to arrest, to scrutinise them, and to\r\nrecord their exact appearance. Afterwards I collate the records at\r\nleisure, and discuss them, and draw conclusions. It must be\r\nunderstood that the second of the two ideas was never derived from\r\nthe first, but always directly from the original object. This was\r\nensured by absolutely withstanding all temptation to reverie. I do\r\nnot mean that the first idea was of necessity a simple elementary\r\nthought; sometimes it was a glance down a familiar line of\r\nassociations, sometimes it was a well-remembered mental attitude or\r\nmode of feeling, but I mean that it was never so far indulged in as\r\nto displace the object that had suggested it from being the primary\r\ntopic of attention.\r\n\r\nI must add, that I found the experiments to be extremely trying and\r\nirksome, and that it required much resolution to go through with them,\r\nusing the scrupulous care they demanded. Nevertheless the results\r\nwell repaid the trouble. They gave me an interesting and unexpected\r\nview of the number of the operations of the mind, and of the obscure\r\ndepths in which they took place, of which I had been little\r\nconscious before. The general impression they have left upon me is\r\nlike that which many of us have experienced when the basement of our\r\nhouse happens to be under thorough sanitary repairs, and we realise\r\nfor the first time the complex system of drains and gas and water\r\npipes, flues, bell-wires, and so forth, upon which our comfort\r\ndepends, but which are usually hidden out of sight, and with whose\r\nexistence, so long as they acted well, we had never troubled\r\nourselves.\r\n\r\nThe first experiments I made were imperfect, but sufficient to\r\ninspire me with keen interest in the matter, and suggested the form\r\nof procedure that I have already partly described. My first\r\nexperiments were these. On several occasions, but notably on one\r\nwhen I felt myself unusually capable of the kind of effort required,\r\nI walked leisurely along Pall Mall, a distance of 450 yards, during\r\nwhich time I scrutinised with attention every successive object that\r\ncaught my eyes, and I allowed my attention to rest on it until one\r\nor two thoughts had arisen through direct association with that\r\nobject; then I took very brief mental note of them, and passed on to\r\nthe next object. I never allowed my mind to ramble. The number of\r\nobjects viewed was, I think, about 300, for I had subsequently\r\nrepeated the same walk under similar conditions and endeavoured to\r\nestimate their number, with that result. It was impossible for me to\r\nrecall in other than the vaguest way the numerous ideas that had\r\npassed through my mind; but of this, at least, I am sure, that\r\nsamples of my whole life had passed before me, that many bygone\r\nincidents, which I never suspected to have formed part of my stock\r\nof thoughts, had been glanced at as objects too familiar to awaken\r\nthe attention. I saw at once that the brain was vastly more active\r\nthan I had previously believed it to be, and I was perfectly amazed\r\nat the unexpected width of the field of its everyday operations.\r\nAfter an interval of some days, during which I kept my mind from\r\ndwelling on my first experiences, in order that it might retain as\r\nmuch freshness as possible for a second experiment, I repeated the\r\nwalk, and was struck just as much as before by the variety of the\r\nideas that presented themselves, and the number of events to which\r\nthey referred, about which I had never consciously occupied myself\r\nof late years. But my admiration at the activity of the mind was\r\nseriously diminished by another observation which I then made, namely,\r\nthat there had been a very great deal of repetition of thought. The\r\nactors in my mental stage were indeed very numerous, but by no means\r\nso numerous as I had imagined. They now seemed to be something like\r\nthe actors in theatres where large processions are represented, who\r\nmarch off one side of the stage, and, going round by the back, come\r\non again at the other. I accordingly cast about for means of laying\r\nhold of these fleeting thoughts, and, submitting them to statistical\r\nanalysis, to find out more about their tendency to repetition and\r\nother matters, and the method I finally adopted was the one already\r\nmentioned. I selected a list of suitable words, and wrote them on\r\ndifferent small sheets of paper. Taking care to dismiss them from my\r\nthoughts when not engaged upon them, and allowing some days to\r\nelapse before I began to use them, I laid one of these sheets with\r\nall due precautions, under a book, but not wholly covered by it, so\r\nthat when I leaned forward I could see one of the words, being\r\npreviously quite ignorant of what the word would be. Also I held a\r\nsmall chronograph, which I started by pressing a spring the moment\r\nthe word caught my eye, and which stopped of itself the instant I\r\nreleased the spring; and this I did so soon as about a couple of\r\nideas in direct association with the word had arisen in my mind. I\r\nfound that I could not manage to recollect more than two ideas with\r\nthe needed precision, at least not in a general way; but sometimes\r\nseveral ideas occurred so nearly together that I was able to record\r\nthree or even four of them, while sometimes I only managed one. The\r\nsecond ideas were, as I have already said, never derived from the\r\nfirst, but always direct from the word itself, for I kept my\r\nattention firmly fixed on the word, and the associated ideas were\r\nseen only by a half glance. When the two ideas had occurred,\r\n\r\nI stopped the chronograph and wrote them down, and the time they\r\noccupied. I soon got into the way of doing all this in a very\r\nmethodical and automatic manner, keeping the mind perfectly calm and\r\nneutral, but intent and, as it were, at full cock and on hair trigger,\r\nbefore displaying the word. There was no disturbance occasioned by\r\nthinking of the forthcoming revulsion of the mind the moment before\r\nthe chronograph was stopped. My feeling before stopping it was\r\nsimply that I had delayed long enough, and this in no way interfered\r\nwith the free action of the mind. I found no trouble in ensuring the\r\ncomplete fairness of the experiment, by using a number of little\r\nprecautions, hardly necessary to describe, that practice quickly\r\nsuggested, but it was a most repugnant and laborious work, and it\r\nwas only by strong self-control that I went through my schedule\r\naccording to programme. The list of words that I finally secured was\r\n75 in number, though I began with more. I went through them on four\r\nseparate occasions, under very different circumstances, in England\r\nand abroad, and at intervals of about a month. In no case were the\r\nassociations governed to any degree worth recording, by remembering\r\nwhat had occurred to me on previous occasions, for I found that the\r\nprocess itself had great influence in discharging the memory of what\r\nit had just been engaged in, and I, of course, took care between the\r\nexperiments never to let my thoughts revert to the words. The\r\nresults seem to me to be as trustworthy as any other statistical\r\nseries that has been collected with equal care.\r\n\r\nOn throwing these results into a common statistical hotch-pot, I\r\nfirst examined into the rate at which these associated ideas were\r\nformed. It took a total time of 660 seconds to form the 505 ideas;\r\nthat is, at about the rate of 50 in a minute, or 3000 in an hour.\r\nThis would be miserably slow work in reverie, or wherever the\r\nthought follows the lead of each association that successively\r\npresents itself. In the present case, much time was lost in mentally\r\ntaking the word in, owing to the quiet unobtrusive way in which I\r\nfound it necessary to bring it into view, so as not to distract the\r\nthoughts. Moreover, a substantive standing by itself is usually the\r\nequivalent of too abstract an idea for us to conceive properly\r\nwithout delay. Thus it is very difficult to get a quick conception\r\nof the word \"carriage,\" because there are so many different\r\nkinds--two-wheeled, four-wheeled, open and closed, and all of them\r\nin so many different possible positions, that the mind possibly\r\nhesitates amidst an obscure sense of many alternatives that cannot\r\nblend together. But limit the idea to say a laudau, and the mental\r\nassociation declares itself more quickly. Say a laudau coming down\r\nthe street to opposite the door, and an image of many blended\r\nlaudaus that have done so forms itself without the least hesitation.\r\n\r\nNext, I found that my list of 75 words gone over 4 times, had given\r\nrise to 505 ideas and 13 cases of puzzle, in which nothing\r\nsufficiently definite to note occurred within the brief maximum\r\nperiod of about 4 seconds, that I allowed myself to any single trial.\r\nOf these 505 only 289 were different The precise proportions in\r\nwhich the 505 were distributed in quadruplets, triplets, doublets,\r\nor singles, is shown in the uppermost lines of Table I. The same\r\nfacts are given under another form in the lower lines of the Table,\r\nwhich show how the 289 different ideas were distributed in cases of\r\nfourfold, treble, double, or single occurrences.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            TABLE I.\r\n                      RECURRENT ASSOCIATIONS.\r\n================+=================================================+\r\nTotal Number of |                                                 |\r\n  Associations. |                   Occurring in                  |\r\n                |-------------------------------------------------+\r\n                | Quadruplets. | Triplets.  | Doublets. | Singles.|\r\n    505         |     116      |    108     |    114    |   167   |\r\n----------------+--------------+------------+-----------+---------+\r\n Per cent . 100 |      23      |     21     |     23    |    33   |\r\n================+==============+============+===========+=========+\r\nTotal Number of |                                                 |\r\n    Different   |                     Occurring                   |\r\n  Associations. +-------------------------------------------------+\r\n                | Four times.  |Three times.|  Twice.   |  Once.  |\r\n----------------+--------------+------------+-----------+---------+\r\n      289       |      29      |     36     |     57    |   167   |\r\n----------------+--------------+------------+-----------+---------+\r\n Per cent . 100 |      10      |     12     |     20    |    58   |\r\n================+==============+============+===========+=========+\r\n\r\n\r\nI was fully prepared to find much iteration in my ideas but had\r\nlittle expected that out of every hundred words twenty-three would\r\ngive rise to exactly the same association in every one of the four\r\ntrials; twenty-one to the same association in three out of the four,\r\nand so on, the experiments having been purposely conducted under\r\nvery different conditions of time and local circumstances. This shows\r\nmuch less variety in the mental stock of ideas than I had expected,\r\nand makes us feel that the roadways of our minds are worn into very\r\ndeep ruts. I conclude from the proved number of faint and barely\r\nconscious thoughts, and from the proved iteration of them, that the\r\nmind is perpetually travelling over familiar ways without our memory\r\nretaining any impression of its excursions. Its footsteps are so\r\nlight and fleeting that it is only by such experiments as I have\r\ndescribed that we can learn anything about them. It is apparently\r\nalways engaged in mumbling over its old stores, and if any one of\r\nthese is wholly neglected for a while, it is apt to be forgotten,\r\nperhaps irrecoverably. It is by no means the keenness of interest\r\nand of the attention when first observing an object, that fixes it\r\nin the recollection. We pore over the pages of a _Bradshaw_, and\r\nstudy the trains for some particular journey with the greatest\r\ninterest; but the event passes by, and the hours and other facts\r\nwhich we once so eagerly considered become absolutely forgotten. So\r\nin games of whist, and in a large number of similar instances. As I\r\nunderstand it, the subject must have a continued living interest in\r\norder to retain an abiding place in the memory. The mind must refer\r\nto it frequently, but whether it does so consciously or\r\nunconsciously is not perhaps a matter of much importance. Otherwise,\r\nas a general rule, the recollection sinks, and appears to be utterly\r\ndrowned in the waters of Lethe.\r\n\r\nThe instances, according to my personal experience, are very rare,\r\nand even those are not very satisfactory, in which some event\r\nrecalls a memory that had lain _absolutely_ dormant for many years.\r\nIn this very series of experiments a recollection which I thought\r\nhad entirely lapsed appeared under no less than three different\r\naspects on different occasions. It was this: when I was a boy, my\r\nfather, who was anxious that I should learn something of physical\r\nscience, which was then never taught at school, arranged with the\r\nowner of a large chemist's shop to let me dabble at chemistry for a\r\nfew days in his laboratory. I had not thought of this fact, so far\r\nas I was aware, for many years; but in scrutinising the fleeting\r\nassociations called up by the various words, I traced two mental\r\nvisual images (an alembic and a particular arrangement of tables and\r\nlight), and one mental sense of smell (chlorine gas) to that very\r\nlaboratory. I recognised that these images appeared familiar to me,\r\nbut I had not thought of their origin. No doubt if some strange\r\nconjunction of circumstances had suddenly recalled those three\r\nassociations at the same time, with perhaps two or three other\r\ncollateral matters which may be still living in my memory, but which\r\nI no not as yet identify, a mental perception of startling vividness\r\nwould be the result, and I should have falsely imagined that it had\r\nsupernaturally, as it were, started into life from an entire\r\noblivion extending over many years. Probably many persons would have\r\nregistered such a case as evidence that things once perceived can\r\nnever wholly vanish from the recollection, but that in the hour\r\nof death, or under some excitement, every event of a past life\r\nmay reappear. To this view I entirely dissent. Forgetfulness\r\nappears absolute in the vast majority of cases, and our supposed\r\nrecollections of a past life are, I believe, no more than that\r\nof a large number of episodes in it, to be reckoned perhaps in\r\nhundreds of thousands, but certainly not in tens of hundreds of\r\nthousands, that have escaped oblivion. Every one of the fleeting,\r\nhalf-conscious thoughts that were the subject of my experiments,\r\nadmitted of being vivified by keen attention, or by some appropriate\r\nassociation, but I strongly suspect that ideas which have long since\r\nceased to fleet through the brain, owing to the absence of current\r\nassociations to call them up, disappear wholly. A comparison of old\r\nmemories with a newly-met friend of one's boyhood, about the events\r\nwe then witnessed together, show how much we had each of us forgotten.\r\nOur recollections do not tally. Actors and incidents that seem to\r\nhave been of primary importance in those events to the one have been\r\nutterly forgotten by the other. The recollection of our earlier\r\nyears are, in truth, very scanty, as any one will find who tries to\r\nenumerate them.\r\n\r\nMy associated ideas were for the most part due to my own unshared\r\nexperiences, and the list of them would necessarily differ widely\r\nfrom that which another person would draw up who might repeat my\r\nexperiments. Therefore one sees clearly, and I may say, one can see\r\n_measurably_, how impossible it is in a general way for two\r\ngrown-up persons to lay their minds side by side together in perfect\r\naccord. The same sentence cannot produce precisely the same effect on\r\nboth, and the first quick impressions that any given word in it may\r\nconvey, will differ widely in the two minds.\r\n\r\nI took pains to determine as far as feasible the dates of my life at\r\nwhich each of the associated ideas was first attached to the word.\r\nThere were 124 cases in which identification was satisfactory, and\r\nthey were distributed as in Table II.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                TABLE  II.\r\n         RELATIVE NUMBER OF ASSOCIATIONS FORMED AT DIFFERENT\r\n                            PERIODS OF LIFE.\r\n==============+==========================================+==============+\r\nTotal number  |            Occurring                     | Whose first  |\r\nof different  |------------------------------------------+ formation    |\r\nAssociations. |  four    | three    |   twice |   once   | was in       |\r\n              |  times.  | times.   |         |          |              |\r\n     +--------|    +-----|    +-----|   +-----|    +-----|              |\r\n     | per    |    |per  |    |per  |   |per  |    |per  |              |\r\n     | cent.  |    |cent.|    |cent.|   |cent.|    |cent.|              |\r\n     +--------|----+-----+----+-----+---+-----+----+-----+--------------+\r\n  48 |   39   | 12 | 10  | 11 |  9  | 9 |  7  | 16 | 13  | boyhood and  |\r\n     |        |    |     |    |     |   |     |    |     |   youth,     |\r\n     |        |    |     |    |     |   |     |    |     |              |\r\n  57 |   46   | 10 |  8  |  8 |  7  | 6 |  5  | 33 | 26  | subsequent   |\r\n     |        |    |     |    |     |   |     |    |     |   manhood,   |\r\n     |        |    |     |    |     |   |     |    |     |              |\r\n  19 |   15   | -- | --  |  4 |  3  | 1 |  1  | 14 | 11  | quite recent |\r\n     |        |    |     |    |     |   |     |    |     |   events.    |\r\n-----+--------|----+-----+----+-----+---+-----+----+-----+--------------+\r\n 124 |  100   | 22 | 18  | 23 | 19  |16 | 13  | 63 | 50  |  Totals.     |\r\n=====+========+=========================================================+\r\n\r\n\r\nIt will be seen from the Table that out of the 48 earliest\r\nassociations no less than 12, or one quarter of them, occurred in\r\neach of the four trials; of the 57 associations first formed in\r\nmanhood, 10, or about one-sixth of them, had a similar recurrence,\r\nbut as to the 19 other associations first formed in quite recent\r\ntimes, not one of them occurred in the whole of the four trials.\r\nHence we may see the greater fixity of the earlier associations, and\r\nmight measurably determine the decrease of fixity as the date of\r\ntheir first formation becomes less remote.\r\n\r\nThe largeness of the number 33 in the middle entry of the last\r\ncolumn but one, which disconcerts the run of the series, is wholly\r\ndue to a visual memory of places seen in manhood. I will not speak\r\nabout this now, as I shall have to refer to it farther on. Neglecting,\r\nfor the moment, this unique class of occurrences, it will be seen\r\nthat one-half of the associations date from the period of life\r\nbefore leaving college; and it may easily be imagined that many of\r\nthese refer to common events in an English education. Nay further, on\r\nlooking through the list of all the associations it was easy to see\r\nhow they are pervaded by purely English ideas, and especially such\r\nas are prevalent in that stratum of English society in which I was\r\nborn and bred, and have subsequently lived. In illustration of this,\r\nI may mention an anecdote of a matter which greatly impressed me at\r\nthe time. I was staying in a country house with a very pleasant\r\nparty of young and old, including persons whose education and\r\nversatility were certainly not below the social average. One evening\r\nwe played at a round game, which consisted in each of us drawing as\r\nabsurd a scrawl as he or she could, representing some historical\r\nevent; the pictures were then shuffled and passed successively from\r\nhand to hand, every one writing down independently their\r\ninterpretation of the picture, as to what the historical event was\r\nthat the artist intended to depict by the scrawl. I was astonished\r\nat the sameness of our ideas. Cases like Canute and the waves, the\r\nBabes in the Tower, and the like, were drawn by two and even three\r\npersons at the same time, quite independently of one another,\r\nshowing how narrowly we are bound by the fetters of our early\r\neducation. If the figures in the above Table may be accepted as\r\nfairly correct for the world generally, it shows, still in a\r\nmeasurable degree, the large effect of early education in fixing our\r\nassociations. It will of course be understood that I make no absurd\r\nprofession of being able by these very few experiments to lay down\r\nstatistical constants of universal application, but that my principal\r\nobject is to show that a large class of mental phenomena, that have\r\nhitherto been too vague to lay hold of, admit of being caught by the\r\nfirm grip of genuine statistical inquiry. The results that I have\r\nthus far given are hotch-pot results. It is necessary to sort the\r\nmaterials somewhat before saying more about them.\r\n\r\nAfter  several trials I  found  that the associated ideas admitted\r\nof being divided into three main groups. First there is the imagined\r\nsound of words, as in verbal quotations or names of persons. This\r\nwas frequently a mere parrot-like memory which acted instantaneously\r\nand in a meaningless way, just as a machine might act. In the next\r\ngroup there was every other kind of sense imagery; the chime of\r\nimagined bells, the shiver of remembered cold, the scent of some\r\nparticular locality, and, much  more frequently than all the rest\r\nput together, visual imagery. The last of the three groups contains\r\nwhat I will venture, for the want of a better name, to call\r\n\"histrionic\" representations. It includes those cases where I either\r\nact a part in imagination, or see in imagination a part acted, or,\r\nmost commonly by far, where I am both spectator and all the actors\r\nat once, in an imaginary mental theatre. Thus I feel a nascent sense\r\nof some muscular action while I simultaneously witness a puppet of\r\nmy brain--a part of myself--perform that action, and I assume a\r\nmental attitude appropriate to the occasion. This, in my case, is a\r\nvery frequent way of generalising, indeed I rarely feel that I have\r\nsecure hold of a general idea until I have translated it somehow\r\ninto this form. Thus the word \"abasement\" presented itself to me, in\r\none of my experiments, by my mentally placing myself in a pantomimic\r\nattitude of humiliation with half-closed eyes, bowed head, and\r\nuplifted palms, while at the same time I was aware of myself as of a\r\nmental puppet, in that position. This same word will serve to\r\nillustrate the other groups also. It so happened in connection with\r\n\"abasement\" that the word \"David\" or \"King David\" occurred to me on\r\none occasion in each of three out of the four trials; also that an\r\naccidental misreading, or perhaps the merely punning association of\r\nthe words \"a basement,\" brought up on all four occasions the image\r\nof the foundations of a house that the builders had begun upon.\r\n\r\nSo much for the character of the association; next as to that of the\r\nwords. I found, after the experiments were over, that the words were\r\ndivisible into three distinct groups. The first contained \"abbey,\"\r\n\"aborigines,\" \"abyss,\" and others that admitted of being presented\r\nunder some mental image. The second group contained \"abasement,\"\r\n\"abhorrence,\" \"ablution,\" etc., which admitted excellently of\r\nhistrionic representation. The third group contained the more\r\nabstract words, such as \"afternoon,\" \"ability,\" \"abnormal,\" which\r\nwere variously and imperfectly dealt with by my mind. I give the\r\nresults in the upper part of Table III., and, in order to save\r\ntrouble, I have reduced them to percentages in the lower lines of\r\nthe Table.\r\n\r\n\r\n                               TABLE III.\r\n    COMPARISON BETWEEN THE QUALITY OF THE WORDS AND THAT OF\r\n         THE IDEAS IN IMMEDIATE ASSOCIATION WITH THEM.\r\n=========================================================================+\r\n Number  |              |         |          |                    |      |\r\nof words |              | Sense   |Histrionic|   Purely Verbal    |      |\r\nin each  |              |Imagery. |          | Names  | Phrases   | Total|\r\nseries.  |              |         |          |   of   |   and     |      |\r\n         |              |         |          |Persons.|Quotations.|      |\r\n         |              |---------+----------+--------+-----------+------+\r\n   26    |\"Abbey\" series|   46    |    12    |   32   |    17     | 107  |\r\n   20    |\"Abasement\" \" |   25    |    26    |   11   |    17     |  79  |\r\n   29    |\"Afternoon\" \" |   23    |    27    |   16   |    38     | 104  |\r\n   75    |              |         |          |        |           | 290  |\r\n         |              |---------+----------+--------+-----------+------+\r\n         |\"Abbey\" series|   43    |    11    |   30   |    16     | 100  |\r\n         |\"Abasement\" \" |   32    |    33    |   13   |    22     | 100  |\r\n         |\"Afternoon\" \" |   22    |    25    |   16   |    37     | 100  |\r\n==========================================================================\r\n\r\n\r\nWe see from this that the associations of the \"abbey\" series are\r\nnearly half of them in sense imagery, and these were almost always\r\nvisual. The names of persons also more frequently occurred in this\r\nseries than in any other. It will be recollected that in Table II. I\r\ndrew attention to the exceptionally large number, 33, in the last\r\ncolumn. It was perhaps 20 in excess of what would have been expected\r\nfrom the general run of the other figures. This was wholly due to\r\nvisual imagery of scenes with which I was first acquainted after\r\nreaching manhood, and shows, I think, that the scenes of childhood\r\nand youth, though vividly impressed on the memory, are by no means\r\nnumerous, and may be quite thrown into the background by the\r\nabundance of after experiences; but this, as we have seen, is not the\r\ncase with the other forms of association. Verbal memories of old date,\r\nsuch as Biblical scraps, family expressions, bits of poetry, and the\r\nlike, are very numerous, and rise to the thoughts so quickly,\r\nwhenever anything suggests them, that they commonly outstrip all\r\ncompetitors. Associations connected with the \"abasement\" series are\r\nstrongly characterised by histrionic ideas, and by sense imagery,\r\nwhich to a great degree merges into a histrionic character. Thus the\r\nword \"abhorrence\" suggested to me, on three out of the four trials,\r\nan image of the attitude of Martha in the famous picture of the\r\nraising of Lazarus by Sebastian del Piombo in the National Gallery.\r\nShe stands with averted head, doubly sheltering her face by her hands\r\nfrom even a sidelong view of the opened grave. Now I could not be\r\nsure how far I saw the picture as such, in my mental view, or how\r\nfar I had thrown my own personality into the picture, and was acting\r\nit as actors might act a mystery play, by the puppets of my own brain,\r\nthat were parts of myself. As a matter of fact, I entered it under\r\nthe heading of sense imagery, but it might very properly have gone\r\nto swell the number of the histrionic entries.\r\n\r\nThe \"afternoon\" series suggested a great preponderance of mere catch\r\nwords, showing how slowly I was able to realise the meaning of\r\nabstractions; the phrases intruded themselves before the thoughts\r\nbecame defined. It occasionally occurred that I puzzled wholly over\r\na word, and made no entry at all; in thirteen cases either this\r\nhappened, or else after one idea had occurred the second was too\r\nconfused and obscure to admit of record, and mention of it had to be\r\nomitted in the foregoing Table. These entries have forcibly shown to\r\nme the great imperfection in my generalising powers; and I am sure\r\nthat most persons would find the same if they made similar trials.\r\nNothing is a surer sign of high intellectual capacity than the power\r\nof quickly seizing and easily manipulating ideas of a very abstract\r\nnature. Commonly we grasp them very imperfectly, and cling to their\r\nskirts with great difficulty.\r\n\r\nIn comparing the order in which the ideas presented themselves, I\r\nfind that a decided precedence is assumed by the histrionic ideas,\r\nwherever they occur; that verbal associations occur first and with\r\ngreat quickness on many occasions, but on the whole that they are\r\nonly a little more likely to occur first than second; and that\r\nimagery is decidedly more likely to be the second than the first of\r\nthe associations called up by a word. In short, gesture-language\r\nappeals the most quickly to my feelings,\r\n\r\nIt would be very instructive to print the actual records at length,\r\nmade by many experimenters, if the records could be clubbed together\r\nand thrown into a statistical form; but it would be too absurd to\r\nprint one's own singly. They lay bare the foundations of a man's\r\nthoughts with curious distinctness, and exhibit his mental anatomy\r\nwith more vividness and truth than he would probably care to publish\r\nto the world.\r\n\r\nIt remains to summarise what has been said in the foregoing memoir.\r\nI have desired to show how whole 1 strata of mental operations that\r\nhave lapsed out of ordinary consciousness, admit of being dragged\r\ninto light, recorded and treated statistically, and how the\r\nobscurity that attends the initial steps of our thoughts can thus be\r\npierced and dissipated. I then showed measurably the rate at which\r\nassociations sprung up, their character, the date of their first\r\nformation, their tendency to recurrence, and their relative\r\nprecedence. Also I gave an instance showing how the phenomenon of a\r\nlong-forgotten scene, suddenly starting into consciousness, admitted\r\nin many cases of being explained. Perhaps the strongest of the\r\nimpressions left by these experiments regards the multifariousness\r\nof the work done by the mind in a state of half-unconsciousness, and\r\nthe valid reason they afford for believing in the existence of still\r\ndeeper strata of mental operations, sunk wholly below the level of\r\nconsciousness, which may account for such mental phenomena as cannot\r\notherwise be explained. We gain an insight by these experiments into\r\nthe marvellous number and nimbleness of our mental associations, and\r\nwe also learn that they are very far indeed from being infinite in\r\ntheir variety. We find that our working stock of ideas is narrowly\r\nlimited and that the mind continually recurs to the same instruments\r\nin conducting its operations, therefore its tracks necessarily\r\nbecome more defined and its flexibility diminished as age advances.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nANTECHAMBER OF CONSCIOUSNESS.\r\n\r\nWhen I am engaged in trying to think anything out, the process of\r\ndoing so appears to me to be this: The ideas that lie at any moment\r\nwithin my full consciousness seem to attract of their own accord the\r\nmost appropriate out of a number of other ideas that are lying close\r\nat hand, but imperfectly within the range of my consciousness. There\r\nseems to be a presence-chamber in my mind where full consciousness\r\nholds court, and where two or three ideas are at the same time in\r\naudience, and an antechamber full of more or less allied ideas,\r\nwhich is situated just beyond the full ken of consciousness. Out of\r\nthis antechamber the ideas most nearly allied to those in the\r\npresence-chamber appear to be summoned in a mechanically logical way,\r\nand to have their turn of audience.\r\n\r\nThe successful progress of thought appears to depend--first, on a\r\nlarge attendance in the antechamber; secondly, on the presence there\r\nof no ideas except such as are strictly germane to the topic under\r\nconsideration; thirdly, on the justness of the logical mechanism\r\nthat issues the summons. The thronging of the antechamber is, I am\r\nconvinced, altogether beyond my control; if the ideas do not appear,\r\nI cannot create them, nor compel them to come. The exclusion of\r\nalien ideas is accompanied by a sense of mental effort and volition\r\nwhenever the topic under consideration is unattractive, otherwise it\r\nproceeds automatically, for if an intruding idea finds nothing to\r\ncling to, it is unable to hold its place in the antechamber, and\r\nslides back again. An animal absorbed in a favourite occupation\r\nshows no sign of painful effort of attention; on the contrary, he\r\nresents interruption that solicits his attention elsewhere. The\r\nconsequence of all this is that the mind frequently does good work\r\nwithout the slightest exertion. In composition it will often produce\r\na better effect than if it acted with effort, because the essence of\r\ngood composition is that the ideas should be connected by the\r\neasiest possible transitions. When a man has been thinking hard and\r\nlong upon a subject, he becomes temporarily familiar with certain\r\nsteps of thought, certain short cuts, and certain far-fetched\r\nassociations, that do not commend themselves to the minds of other\r\npersons, nor indeed to his own at other times; therefore, it is\r\nbetter that his transitory familiarity with them should have come to\r\nan end before he begins to write or speak. When he returns to the\r\nwork after a sufficient pause he is conscious that his ideas have\r\nsettled; that is, they have lost their adventitious relations to one\r\nanother, and stand in those in which they are likely to reside\r\npermanently in his own mind, and to exist in the minds of others.\r\n\r\nAlthough the brain is able to do very fair work fluently in an\r\nautomatic way, and though it will of its own accord strike out\r\nsudden and happy ideas, it is questionable if it is capable of\r\nworking thoroughly and profoundly without past or present effort.\r\nThe character of this effort seems to me chiefly to lie in bringing\r\nthe contents of the antechamber more nearly within the ken of\r\nconsciousness, which then takes comprehensive note of all its\r\ncontents, and compels the logical faculty to test them _seriatim_\r\nbefore selecting the fittest for a summons to the presence-chamber.\r\n\r\nExtreme fluency and a vivid and rapid imagination are gifts\r\nnaturally and healthfully possessed by those who rise to be great\r\norators or literary men, for they could not have become successful\r\nin those careers without it. The curious fact already alluded to of\r\nfive editors of newspapers being known to me as having phantasmagoria,\r\npoints to a connection between two forms of fluency, the literary\r\nand the visual. Fluency may be also a morbid faculty, being markedly\r\nincreased by alcohol (as poets are never tired of telling us), and\r\nby various drugs; and it exists in delirium, insanity, and states of\r\nhigh emotions. The fluency of a vulgar scold is extraordinary.\r\n\r\nIn preparing to write or speak upon a subject of which the details\r\nhave been mastered, I gather, after some inquiry, that the usual\r\nmethod among persons who have the gift of fluency is to think\r\ncursorily on topics connected with it, until what I have called the\r\nantechamber is well filled with cognate ideas. Then, to allow the\r\nideas to link themselves in their own way, breaking the linkage\r\ncontinually and recommencing afresh until some line of thought has\r\nsuggested itself that appears from a rapid and light glance to\r\nthread the chief topics together. After this the connections are\r\nbrought step by step fully into consciousness, they are\r\nshort-circuited here and extended there, as found advisable until a\r\nfirm connection is found to be established between all parts of the\r\nsubject. After this is done the mental effort is over, and the\r\ncomposition may proceed fluently in an automatic way. Though this, I\r\nbelieve, is a usual way, it is by no means universal, for there are\r\nvery great differences in the conditions under which different\r\npersons compose most readily. They seem to afford as good evidence\r\nof the variety of mental and bodily constitutions as can be met with\r\nin any other line of inquiry.\r\n\r\nIt is very reasonable to think that part at least of the inward\r\nresponse to spiritual yearnings is of similar origin to the visions,\r\nthoughts, and phrases that arise automatically when the mind has\r\nprepared itself to receive them. The devout man attunes his mind to\r\nholy ideas, he excludes alien thoughts, and he waits and watches in\r\nstillness. Gradually the darkness is lifted, the silence of the mind\r\nis broken, and the spiritual responses are heard in the way so often\r\ndescribed by devout men of all religions. This seems to me precisely\r\nanalogous to the automatic presentation of ordinary ideas to orators\r\nand literary men, and to the visions of which I spoke in the chapter\r\non that subject. Dividuality replaces individuality, and one portion\r\nof the mind communicates with another portion as with a different\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nSome persons and races are naturally more imaginative than others,\r\nand show their visionary tendency in every one of the respects named.\r\nThey are fanciful, oratorical, poetical, and credulous. The\r\n\"enthusiastic\" faculties all seem to hang together; I shall recur to\r\nthis in the chapter on enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nI have already pointed out the existence of a morbid form of piety:\r\nthere is also a morbid condition of apparent inspiration to which\r\nimaginative women are subject, especially those who suffer more or\r\nless from hysteria. It is accompanied in a very curious way,\r\nfamiliar to medical men, by almost incredible acts of deceit. It is\r\nfound even in ladies of position apparently above the suspicion of\r\nvulgar fraud, and seems associated with a strange secret desire to\r\nattract notice. Ecstatics, seers of visions, and devout fasting\r\ngirls who eat on the sly, often belong to this category.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY SENTIMENTS.\r\n\r\nThe child is passionately attached to his home, then to his school,\r\nhis country, and religion; yet how entirely the particular home,\r\nschool, country, and religion are a matter of accident! He is born\r\nprepared to attach himself as a climbing plant is naturally disposed\r\nto climb, the kind of stick being of little importance. The models\r\nupon whom the child or boy forms himself are the boys or men whom he\r\nhas been thrown amongst, and whom from some incidental cause he may\r\nhave learned to love and respect. The every-day utterances, the\r\nlikes and dislikes of his parents, their social and caste feelings,\r\ntheir religious persuasions are absorbed by him; their views or\r\nthose of his teachers become assimilated and made his own. If a\r\nmixed marriage should have taken place, and the father should die\r\nwhile the children are yet young, and if a question arise between\r\nthe executors of his will and the mother as to the religious\r\neducation of the children, application is made as a matter of course\r\nto the Court of Chancery, who decide that the children shall be\r\nbrought up as Protestants or as Catholics as the case may be, or the\r\nsons one way and the daughters the other; and they are, and usually\r\nremain so afterwards when free to act for themselves.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of note that many of the deaf-mutes who are first\r\ntaught to communicate freely with others after they had passed the\r\nperiod of boyhood, and are asked about their religious feelings up\r\nto that time, are reported to tell the same story. They say that the\r\nmeaning of the church service whither they had accompanied their\r\nparents, and of the kneeling to pray, had been absolutely\r\nunintelligible, and a standing puzzle to them. The ritual touched no\r\nchord in their untaught natures that responded in unison. Very much\r\nof what we fondly look upon as a natural religious sentiment is\r\npurely traditional.\r\n\r\nThe word religion may fairly be applied to any group of sentiments\r\nor persuasions that  are strong  enough  to bind us to do that which\r\nwe intellectually may acknowledge to be our duty, and the possession\r\nof some form of religion in this larger sense of the word is of the\r\nutmost importance to moral stability. The sentiments must be strong\r\nenough to make us ashamed at the mere thought of committing, and\r\ndistressed during the act of committing any untruth, or any\r\nuncharitable act, or of neglecting what we feel to be right, in\r\norder to indulge in laziness or gratify some passing desire. So long\r\nas experience shows the religion to be competent to produce this\r\neffect, it seems reasonable to believe that the particular dogma is\r\ncomparatively of little importance. But  as  the dogma or sentiments,\r\nwhatever they be, if they are not naturally instinctive, must be\r\ningrained in the character to produce their full effect, they should\r\nbe instilled early in life and allowed  to grow unshaken until their\r\nroots are firmly fixed. The consciousness of this fact makes the\r\nform of religious teaching in every church and creed identical in\r\none important particular though its substance may vary in every\r\nrespect. In subjects unconnected with sentiment, the freest inquiry\r\nand the fullest deliberation are required before it is  thought\r\ndecorous to form a final opinion; but wherever sentiment is involved,\r\nand especially in questions of religious dogma, about which there is\r\nmore sentiment and more difference of opinion among wise, virtuous,\r\nand  truth-seeking men than  about any  other  subject  whatever,\r\nfree inquiry is peremptorily discouraged. The religious instructor\r\nin every creed is one who makes it his profession to saturate his\r\npupils with prejudice. A vast and perpetual clamour arises from the\r\npulpits of endless proselytising sects throughout this great empire,\r\nthe priests of all of them crying with one consent, \"This is the way,\r\nshut your ears to the words of those who teach differently; don't\r\nlook at their books, do not even mention their names except to scoff\r\nat  them; they are damnable. Have faith in what I tell you, and save\r\nyour souls!\" In which of these conflicting doctrines are we to place\r\nour faith if we are not to hear all sides, and to rely upon our own\r\njudgment in the end? Are we to understand that it is the duty of man\r\nto be credulous in accepting whatever the priest in whose\r\nneighbourhood he happens to reside may say? Is it to believe\r\nwhatever his parents may have lovingly taught him? There are a vast\r\nnumber of foolish men and women in the world who marry and have\r\nchildren, and because they deal lovingly with their children it does\r\nnot at all follow that they can instruct them wisely. Or is it to\r\nhave faith in what the wisest men of all ages have found peace in\r\nbelieving? The Catholic phrase, \"_quod semper quod ubique quod\r\nomnibus_\"--\"that which has been believed at all times, in all places,\r\nand by all men\"--has indeed a fine rolling sound, but where is the\r\ndogma that satisfies its requirements? Or is it, such and such\r\nreally good and wise men with whom you are acquainted, and whom, it\r\nmay be, you have the privilege of knowing, have lived consistent\r\nlives through the guidance of these dogmas, how can you who are many\r\ngrades their inferior in good works, in capacity and in experience,\r\npresume to set up your opinion against theirs? The reply is, that it\r\nis a matter of history and notoriety that other very good, capable,\r\nand inexperienced men have led and are leading consistent lives\r\nunder the guidance of totally different dogmas, and that some of\r\nthem a few generations back would have probably burned your modern\r\nhero as a heretic if he had lived in their times and they could have\r\ngot hold of him. Also, that men, however eminent in goodness,\r\nintellect, and experience, may be deeply prejudiced, and that their\r\njudgment in matters where their prejudices are involved cannot\r\nthenceforward be trusted. Watches, as electricians know to their cost,\r\nare liable to have their steel work accidentally magnetised, and the\r\nbest chronometer under those conditions can never again be trusted\r\nto keep correct time.\r\n\r\nLastly, we are told to have faith in our conscience? well we know\r\nnow a great deal more about conscience than formerly. Ethnologists\r\nhave studied the manifestations of conscience in different people,\r\nand do not find that they are consistent. Conscience is now known to\r\nbe partly transmitted by inheritance in the way and under the\r\nconditions clearly explained by Mr. Darwin, and partly to be an\r\nunsuspected result of early education. The value of inherited\r\nconscience lies in its being the organised result of the social\r\nexperiences of many generations, but it fails in so far as it\r\nexpresses the experience of generations whose habits differed from\r\nour own. The doctrine of evolution shows that no race can be in\r\nperfect harmony with its surroundings; the latter are continually\r\nchanging, while the organism of the race hobbles after, vainly\r\ntrying to overtake them. Therefore the inherited part of conscience\r\ncannot be an infallible guide, and the acquired part of it may,\r\nunder the influence of dogma, be a very bad one. The history of\r\nfanaticism shows too clearly that this is not only a theory but a\r\nfact. Happy the child, especially in these inquiring days, who has\r\nbeen taught a religion that mainly rests on the moral obligations\r\nbetween man and man in domestic and national life, and which, so far\r\nas it is necessarily dogmatic, rests chiefly upon the proper\r\ninterpretation of facts about which there is no dispute,--namely, on\r\nthose habitual occurrences which are always open to observation, and\r\nwhich form the basis of so-called natural religion.\r\n\r\nIt would be instructive to make a study of the working religion of\r\ngood and able men of all nations, in order to discover the real\r\nmotives by which they were severally animated,--men, I mean, who had\r\nbeen tried by both prosperity and adversity, and had borne the test;\r\nwho, while they led lives full of interest to themselves, were\r\nbeloved by their own family, noted among those with whom they had\r\nbusiness relations for their probity and conciliatory ways, and\r\nhonoured by a wider circle for their unselfish furtherance of the\r\npublic good. Such men exist of many faiths and in many races.\r\n\r\nAnother interesting and cognate inquiry would be into the motives\r\nthat have sufficed to induce men who were leading happy lives, to\r\nmeet death willingly at a time when they were not particularly\r\nexcited. Probably the number of instances to be found, say among\r\nMussulmans, who are firm believers in the joys of Mahomet's Paradise,\r\nwould not be more numerous than among the Zulus, who have no belief\r\nin any paradise at all, but are influenced by martial honour and\r\npatriotism. There is an Oriental phrase, as I have been told, that\r\nthe fear of the inevitable approach of death is a European malady.\r\n\r\nTerror at any object is quickly taught if it is taught consistently,\r\nwhether the terror be reasonable or not. There are few more stupid\r\ncreatures than fish, but they notoriously soon learn to be\r\nfrightened at any newly-introduced method of capture, say by an\r\nartificial fly, which, at first their comrades took greedily. Some\r\none fish may have seen others caught, and have learned to take fright\r\nat the fly. Whenever he saw it again he would betray his terror by\r\nsome instinctive gesture, which would be seen and understood by\r\nothers, and so instruction in distrusting the fly appears to spread.\r\n\r\nAll gregarious animals are extremely quick at learning terrors from\r\none another. It is a condition of their existence that they should\r\ndo so, as was explained at length in a previous chapter. Their\r\nsafety lies in mutual intelligence and support. When most of them\r\nare browsing a few are always watching, and at the least signal of\r\nalarm the whole herd takes fright simultaneously. Gregarious animals\r\nare quickly alive to their mutual signals; it is beautiful to watch\r\ngreat flocks of birds as they wheel in their flight and suddenly\r\nshow the flash of all their wings against the sky, as they\r\nsimultaneously and suddenly change their direction. Much of the\r\ntameness or wildness of an animal's character is probably due to the\r\nplacidity or to the frequent starts of alarm of the mother while she\r\nwas rearing it. I was greatly struck with some evidence I happened\r\nto meet with, of the pervading atmosphere of alarm and suspicion in\r\nwhich the children of criminal parents are brought up, and which, in\r\ncombination with their inherited disposition, makes them, in the\r\nopinion of many observers, so different to other children. The\r\nevidence of which I speak lay in the tone of letters sent by\r\ncriminal parents to their children, who were inmates of the Princess\r\nMary Village Homes, from which I had the opportunity, thanks to the\r\nkindness of the Superintendent, Mrs. Meredith, of hearing and seeing\r\nextracts. They were full of such phrases as \"Mind you do not say\r\nanything about this,\" though the matters referred to were, to all\r\nappearance, unimportant.\r\n\r\nThe writings of Dante on the horrible torments of the damned, and\r\nthe realistic pictures of the same subject in frescoes and other\r\npictures of the same date, showing the flames and the flesh hooks\r\nand the harrows, indicate the transforming effect of those cruel\r\ntimes, fifteen generations ago, upon the disposition of men. Revenge\r\nand torture had been so commonly practised by rulers that they seemed\r\nto be appropriate attributes of every high authority, and the\r\nartists of those days saw no incongruity in supposing that a\r\nsupremely powerful master, however beneficent he might be, would\r\nmake the freest use of them.\r\n\r\nAversion is taught as easily as terror, when the object of it is\r\nneutral and not especially attractive to an unprejudiced taste. I\r\ncan testify in my own person to the somewhat rapidly-acquired and\r\nlong-retained fancies concerning the clean and unclean, upon which\r\nJews and Mussulmans lay such curious stress. It was the result of my\r\nhappening to spend a year in the East, at an age when the brain is\r\nvery receptive of new ideas, and when I happened to be much\r\nimpressed by the nobler aspects of Mussulman civilisation, especially,\r\nI may say, with the manly conformity of their every-day practice to\r\ntheir creed, which contrasts sharply with what we see among most\r\nEuropeans, who profess extreme unworldliness and humiliation on one\r\nday of the week, and act in a worldly and masterful manner during\r\nthe remaining six. Although many years have passed since that time, I\r\nstill find the old feelings in existence--for instance, that of\r\nlooking on the left hand as unclean.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to an untravelled Englishman, who has not had an\r\nopportunity of throwing himself into the spirit of the East, to\r\ncredit the disgust and detestation that numerous every-day acts,\r\nwhich appear perfectly harmless to his countrymen, excite in many\r\nOrientals.\r\n\r\nTo conclude, the power of nurture is very great in implanting\r\nsentiments of a religious nature, of terror and of aversion, and in\r\ngiving a fallacious sense of their being natural instincts. But it\r\nwill be observed that the circumstances from which these influences\r\nproceed, affect large classes simultaneously, forming a kind of\r\natmosphere in which every member of them passes his life. They\r\nproduce the cast of mind that distinguishes an Englishman from a\r\nforeigner, and one class of Englishman from another, but they have\r\nlittle influence in creating the differences that exist between\r\nindividuals of the same class.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHISTORY OF TWINS.\r\n\r\nThe exceedingly close resemblance attributed to twins has been the\r\nsubject of many novels and plays, and most persons have felt a\r\ndesire to know upon what basis of truth those works of fiction may\r\nrest. But twins have a special claim upon our attention; it is, that\r\ntheir history affords means of distinguishing between the effects of\r\ntendencies received at birth, and of those that were imposed by the\r\nspecial circumstances of their after lives. The objection to\r\nstatistical evidence in proof of the inheritance of peculiar\r\nfaculties has always been: \"The persons whom you compare may have\r\nlived under similar social conditions and have had similar\r\nadvantages of education, but such prominent conditions are only a\r\nsmall part of those that determine the future of each man's life. It\r\nis to trifling accidental circumstances that the bent of his\r\ndisposition and his success are mainly due, and these you leave\r\nwholly out of account--in fact, they do not admit of being tabulated,\r\nand therefore your statistics, however plausible at first sight, are\r\nreally of very little use.\" No method of inquiry which I had\r\npreviously been able to carry out--and I have tried many methods--is\r\nwholly free from this objection. I have therefore attacked the\r\nproblem from the opposite side, seeking for some new method by which\r\nit would be possible to weigh in just scales the effects of Nature\r\nand Nurture, and to ascertain their respective shares in framing the\r\ndisposition and intellectual ability of men. The life-history of\r\ntwins supplies what I wanted. We may begin by inquiring about twins\r\nwho were closely alike in boyhood and youth, and who were educated\r\ntogether for many years, and learn whether they subsequently grew\r\nunlike, and, if so, what the main causes were which, in the opinion\r\nof the family, produced the dissimilarity. In this way we can obtain\r\ndirect evidence of the kind we want. Again, we may obtain yet more\r\nvaluable evidence by a converse method. We can inquire into the\r\nhistory of twins who were exceedingly unlike in childhood, and learn\r\nhow far their characters became assimilated under the influence of\r\nidentical nurture, inasmuch as they had the same home, the same\r\nteachers, the same associates, and in every other respect the same\r\nsurroundings.\r\n\r\nMy materials were obtained by sending circulars of inquiry to\r\npersons who were either twins themselves or near relations of twins.\r\nThe printed questions were in thirteen groups; the last of them\r\nasked for the addresses of other twins known to the recipient, who\r\nmight be likely to respond if I wrote to them. This happily led to a\r\ncontinually widening circle of correspondence, which I pursued until\r\nenough material was accumulated for a general reconnaisance of the\r\nsubject.\r\n\r\nThere is a large literature relating to twins in their purely\r\nsurgical and physiological aspect. The reader interested in this\r\nshould consult _Die Lehre von den Zwillingen_, von L. Kleinwächter,\r\nPrag. 1871. It is full of references, but it is also unhappily\r\ndisfigured by a number of numerical misprints, especially in page 26.\r\nI have not found any book that treats of twins from my present point\r\nof view.\r\n\r\nThe reader will easily understand that the word \"twins\" is a vague\r\nexpression, which covers two very dissimilar events--the one\r\ncorresponding to the progeny of animals that usually bear more than\r\none at a birth, each of the progeny being derived from a separate\r\novum, while the other event is due to the development of two\r\ngerminal spots in the same ovum. In the latter case they are\r\nenveloped in the same membrane, and all such twins are found\r\ninvariably to be of the same sex. The consequence of this is, that I\r\nfind a curious discontinuity in my results. One would have expected\r\nthat twins would commonly be found to possess a certain average\r\nlikeness to one another; that a few would greatly exceed that\r\naverage likeness, and a few would greatly fall short of it. But this\r\nis not at all the case. Extreme similarity and extreme dissimilarity\r\nbetween twins of the same sex are nearly as common as moderate\r\nresemblance. When the twins are a boy and a girl, they are never\r\nclosely alike; in fact, their origin is never due to the development\r\nof two germinal spots in the same ovum.\r\n\r\nI received about eighty returns of cases of close similarity,\r\nthirty-five of which entered into many instructive details. In a few\r\nof these not a single point of difference could be specified. In the\r\nremainder, the colour of the hair and eyes were almost always\r\nidentical; the height, weight, and strength were nearly so.\r\nNevertheless, I have a few cases of a notable difference in height,\r\nweight, and strength, although the resemblance was otherwise very\r\nnear. The manner and personal address of the thirty-five pairs of\r\ntwins are usually described as very similar, but accompanied by a\r\nslight difference of expression, familiar to near relatives, though\r\nunperceived by strangers. The intonation of the voice when speaking\r\nis commonly the same, but it frequently happens that the twins sing\r\nin different keys. Most singularly, the one point in which\r\nsimilarity is rare is the handwriting. I cannot account for this,\r\nconsidering how strongly handwriting runs in families, but I am sure\r\nof the fact. I have only one case in which nobody, not even the twins\r\nthemselves, could distinguish their own notes of lectures, etc.;\r\nbarely two or three in which the handwriting was undistinguishable\r\nby others, and only a few in which it was described as closely alike.\r\nOn the other hand, I have many in which it is stated to be unlike,\r\nand some in which it is alluded to as the only point of difference.\r\nIt would appear that the handwriting is a very delicate test of\r\ndifference in organisation--a conclusion which I commend to the\r\nnotice of enthusiasts in the art of discovering character by the\r\nhandwriting.\r\n\r\nOne of my inquiries was for anecdotes regarding mistakes made\r\nbetween the twins by their near relatives. The replies are numerous,\r\nbut not very varied in character. When the twins are children, they\r\nare usually distinguished by ribbons tied round the wrist or neck;\r\nnevertheless the one is sometimes fed, physicked, and whipped by\r\nmistake for the other, and the description of these little domestic\r\ncatastrophes was usually given by the mother, in a phraseology that\r\nis somewhat touching by reason of its seriousness. I have one case\r\nin which a doubt remains whether the children were not changed in\r\ntheir bath, and the presumed A is not really B, and _vice versâ_. In\r\nanother case, an artist was engaged on the portraits of twins who\r\nwere between three and four years of age; he had to lay aside his\r\nwork for three weeks, and, on resuming it, could not tell to which\r\nchild the respective likenesses he had in hand belonged. The\r\nmistakes become less numerous on the part of the mother during the\r\nboyhood and girlhood of the twins, but are almost as frequent as\r\nbefore on the part of strangers. I have many instances of tutors\r\nbeing unable to distinguish their twin pupils. Two girls used\r\nregularly to impose on their music teacher when one of them wanted a\r\nwhole holiday; they had their lessons at separate hours, and the one\r\ngirl sacrificed herself to receive two lessons on the same day,\r\nwhile the other one enjoyed herself from morning to evening. Here is\r\na brief and comprehensive account:--\r\n\r\n\"Exactly alike in all, their schoolmasters never could tell them\r\napart; at dancing parties they constantly changed partners without\r\ndiscovery; their close resemblance is scarcely diminished by age.\"\r\n\r\nThe following is a typical schoolboy anecdote:--\r\n\r\n\"Two twins were fond of playing tricks, and complaints were\r\nfrequently made; but the boys would never own which was the guilty\r\none, and the complainants were never certain which of the two he was.\r\nOne head master used to say he would never flog the innocent for the\r\nguilty, and another used to flog both.\"\r\n\r\nNo less than nine anecdotes have reached me of a twin seeing his or\r\nher reflection in a looking-glass, and addressing it in the belief\r\nit was the other twin in person.\r\n\r\nI have many anecdotes of mistakes when the twins were nearly grown up.\r\nThus:--\r\n\r\n\"Amusing scenes occurred at college when one twin came to visit the\r\nother; the porter on one occasion refusing to let the visitor out of\r\nthe college gates, for, though they stood side by side, he professed\r\nignorance as to which he ought to allow to depart.\"\r\n\r\nChildren are usually quick in distinguishing between their parent\r\nand his or her twin; but I have two cases to the contrary. Thus, the\r\ndaughter of a twin says:--\r\n\r\n\"Such was the marvellous similarity of their features, voice, manner,\r\netc., that I remember, as a child, being very much puzzled, and I\r\nthink, had my aunt lived much with us, I should have ended by\r\nthinking I had two mothers.\"\r\n\r\nIn the other case, a father who was a twin, remarks of himself and\r\nhis brother:--\r\n\r\n\"We were extremely alike, and are so at this moment, so much so that\r\nour children up to five and six years old did not know us apart.\"\r\n\r\nI have four or five instances of doubt during an engagement of\r\nmarriage. Thus:--\r\n\r\n\"A married first, but both twins met the lady together for the first\r\ntime, and fell in love with her there and then. A managed to see her\r\nhome and to gain her affection, though B went sometimes courting in\r\nhis place, and neither the lady nor her parents could tell which was\r\nwhich.\"\r\n\r\nI have also a German letter, written in quaint terms, about twin\r\nbrothers who married sisters, but could not easily be distinguished\r\nby them.[13] In the well-known novel by Mr. Wilkie Collins of\r\n_Poor Miss Finch_, the blind girl distinguishes the twin she loves\r\nby the touch of his hand, which gives her a thrill that the touch of\r\nthe other brother does not. Philosophers have not, I believe, as yet\r\ninvestigated the conditions of such thrills; but I have a case in\r\nwhich Miss Finch's test would have failed. Two persons, both friends\r\nof a certain twin lady, told me that she had frequently remarked to\r\nthem that \"kissing her twin sister was not like kissing her other\r\nsisters, but like kissing herself--her own hand, for example.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be an interesting experiment for twins who were closely\r\nalike to try how far dogs could distinguish them by scent.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: I take this opportunity of withdrawing an anecdote,\r\nhappily of no great importance, published in _Men of Science_, p. 14,\r\nabout a man personating his twin brother for a joke at supper, and\r\nnot being discovered by his wife. It was told me on good authority;\r\nbut I have reason to doubt the fact, as the story is not known to\r\nthe son of one of the twins. However, the twins in question were\r\nextraordinarily alike, and I have many anecdotes about them sent me\r\nby the latter gentleman.]\r\n\r\nI have a few anecdotes of strange mistakes made between twins in\r\nadult life. Thus, an officer writes:--\r\n\r\n\"On one occasion when I returned from foreign service my father\r\nturned to me and said, 'I thought you were in London,' thinking I\r\nwas my brother--yet he had not seen me for nearly four years--our\r\nresemblance was so great.\"\r\n\r\nThe next and last anecdote I shall give is, perhaps, the most\r\nremarkable of those I have; it was sent me by the brother of the\r\ntwins, who were in middle life at the time of its occurrence:--\r\n\r\n\"A was again coming home from India, on leave; the ship did not\r\narrive for some days after it was due; the twin brother B had come\r\nup from his quarters to receive A, and their old mother was very\r\nnervous. One morning A rushed in saying, 'Oh, mother, how are you?'\r\nHer answer was, 'No, B, it's a bad joke; you know how anxious I am!'\r\nand it was a little time before A could persuade her that he was the\r\nreal man.\"\r\n\r\nEnough has been said to prove that an extremely close personal\r\nresemblance frequently exists between twins of the same sex; and that,\r\nalthough the resemblance usually diminishes as they grow into\r\nmanhood and womanhood, some cases occur in which the diminution of\r\nresemblance is hardly perceptible. It must be borne in mind that it\r\nis not necessary to ascribe the divergence of development, when it\r\noccurs, to the effect of different nurtures, but it is quite\r\npossible that it may be due to the late appearance of qualities\r\ninherited at birth, though dormant in early life, like gout. To this\r\nI shall recur.\r\n\r\nThere is a curious feature in the character of the resemblance\r\nbetween twins, which has been alluded to by a few correspondents; it\r\nis well illustrated by the following quotations. A mother of twins\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n\"There seemed to be a sort of interchangeable likeness in expression,\r\nthat often gave to each the effect of being more like his brother\r\nthan himself.\"\r\n\r\nAgain, two twin brothers, writing to me, after analysing their\r\npoints of resemblance, which are close and numerous, and pointing\r\nout certain shades of difference, add--\r\n\r\n\"These seem to have marked us through life, though for a while, when\r\nwe were first separated, the one to go to business, and the other to\r\ncollege, our respective characters were inverted; we both think that\r\nat that time we each ran into the character of the other. The proof\r\nof this consists in our own recollections, in our correspondence by\r\nletter, and in the views which we then took of matters in which we\r\nwere interested.\"\r\n\r\nIn explanation of this apparent interchangeableness, we must\r\nrecollect that no character is simple, and that in twins who\r\nstrongly resemble each other, every expression in the one may be\r\nmatched by a corresponding expression in the other, but it does not\r\nfollow that the same expression should be the prevalent one in both\r\ncases. Now it is by their prevalent expressions that we should\r\ndistinguish between the twins; consequently when one twin has\r\ntemporarily the expression which is the prevalent one in his brother,\r\nhe is apt to be mistaken for him. There are also cases where the\r\ndevelopment of the two twins is not strictly _pari passu_; they\r\nreach the same goal at the same time, but not by identical stages.\r\nThus: A is born the larger, then B overtakes and surpasses A, and is\r\nin his turn overtaken by A, the end being that the twins, on\r\nreaching adult life, are of the same size. This process would aid in\r\ngiving an interchangeable likeness at certain periods of their growth,\r\nand is undoubtedly due to nature more frequently than to nurture.\r\n\r\nAmong my thirty-five detailed cases of close similarity, there are\r\nno less than seven in which both twins suffered from some special\r\nailment or had some exceptional peculiarity. One twin writes that\r\nshe and her sister \"have both the defect of not being able to come\r\ndownstairs quickly, which, however, was not born with them, but came\r\non at the age of twenty.\" Three pairs of twins have peculiarities in\r\ntheir fingers; in one case it consists in a slight congenital\r\nflexure of one of the joints of the little finger; it was inherited\r\nfrom a grandmother, but neither parents, nor brothers, nor sisters\r\nshow the least trace of it. In another case the twins have a\r\npeculiar way of bending the fingers, and there was a faint tendency\r\nto the same peculiarity in the mother, but in her alone of all the\r\nfamily. In a third case, about which I made a few inquiries, which\r\nis given by Mr. Darwin, but is not included in my returns, there was\r\nno known family tendency to the peculiarity which was observed in\r\nthe twins of having a crooked little finger. In another pair of twins,\r\none was born ruptured, and the other became so at six months old.\r\nTwo twins at the age of twenty-three were attacked by toothache, and\r\nthe same tooth had to be extracted in each case. There are curious\r\nand close correspondences mentioned in the falling off of the hair.\r\nTwo cases are mentioned of death from the same disease; one of which\r\nis very affecting. The outline of the story was that the twins were\r\nclosely alike and singularly attached, and had identical tastes;\r\nthey both obtained Government clerkships, and kept house together,\r\nwhen one sickened and died of Bright's disease, and the other also\r\nsickened of the same disease and died seven months later.\r\n\r\nBoth twins were apt to sicken at the same time in no less than nine\r\nout of the thirty-five cases. Either their illnesses, to which I\r\nrefer, were non-contagious, or, if contagious, the twins caught them\r\nsimultaneously; they did not catch them the one from the other. This\r\nimplies so intimate a constitutional resemblance, that it is proper\r\nto give some quotations in evidence. Thus, the father of two twins\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n\"Their general health is closely alike; whenever one of them has an\r\nillness, the other invariably has the same within a day or two, and\r\nthey usually recover in the same order. Such has been the case with\r\nwhooping-cough, chicken-pox, and measles; also with slight bilious\r\nattacks, which they have successively. Latterly, they had a feverish\r\nattack at the same time.\"\r\n\r\nAnother parent of twins says:--\r\n\r\n\"If anything ails one of them, identical symptoms _nearly always_\r\nappear in the other; this has been singularly visible in two\r\ninstances during the last two months. Thus, when in London, one fell\r\nill with a violent attack of dysentery, and within twenty-four hours\r\nthe other had precisely the same symptoms.\"\r\n\r\nA medical man writes of twins with whom he is well acquainted:--\r\n\r\n\"Whilst I knew them, for a period of two years, there was not the\r\nslightest tendency towards a difference in body or mind; external\r\ninfluences seemed powerless to produce any dissimilarity.\"\r\n\r\nThe mother of two other twins, after describing how they were ill\r\nsimultaneously up to the age of fifteen, adds, that they shed their\r\nfirst milk-teeth within a few hours of each other.\r\n\r\nTrousseau has a very remarkable case (in the chapter on Asthma) in\r\nhis important work _Clinique M. édicale_. (In the edition of 1873 it\r\nis in vol. ii. p. 473.) It was quoted at length in the original\r\nFrench, in Mr. Darwin's _Variation under Domestication_, vol. ii. p.\r\n252. The following is a translation:--\r\n\r\n\"I attended twin brothers so extraordinarily alike, that it was\r\nimpossible for me to tell which was which, without seeing them side\r\nby side. But their physical likeness extended still deeper, for they\r\nhad, so to speak, a yet more remarkable pathological resemblance.\r\nThus, one of them, whom I saw at the Néothermes at Paris, suffering\r\nfrom rheumatic ophthalmia, said to me, 'At this instant my brother\r\nmust be having an ophthalmia like mine;' and, as I had exclaimed\r\nagainst such an assertion, he showed me a few days afterwards a\r\nletter just received by him from his brother, who was at that time\r\nat Vienna, and who expressed himself in these words--'I have my\r\nophthalmia; you must be having yours.' However singular this story\r\nmay appear, the fact is none the less exact; it has not been told to\r\nme by others, but I have seen it myself; and I have seen other\r\nanalogous cases in my practice. These twins were also asthmatic, and\r\nasthmatic to a frightful degree. Though born in Marseilles, they\r\nwere never able to stay in that town, where their business affairs\r\nrequired them to go, without having an attack. Still more strange,\r\nit was sufficient for them to get away only as far as Toulon in\r\norder to be cured of the attack caught at Marseilles. They travelled\r\ncontinually, and in all countries, on business affairs, and they\r\nremarked that certain localities were extremely hurtful to them, and\r\nthat in others they were free from all asthmatic symptoms.\"\r\n\r\nI do not like to pass over here a most dramatic tale in the\r\n_Psychologie Morbide_ of Dr. J. Moreau (de Tours), M. édecin de\r\nl'Hospice de Bicêtre. Paris, 1859, p. 172. He speaks \"of two twin\r\nbrothers who had been confined, on account of monomania, at Bicêtre\":--\r\n\r\n\"Physically the two young men are so nearly alike that the one is\r\neasily mistaken for the other. Morally, their resemblance is no less\r\ncomplete, and is most remarkable in its details. Thus, their\r\ndominant ideas are absolutely the same. They both consider\r\nthemselves subject to imaginary persecutions; the same enemies have\r\nsworn their destruction, and employ the same means to effect it.\r\nBoth have hallucinations of hearing. They are both of them\r\nmelancholy and morose; they never address a word to anybody, and\r\nwill hardly answer the questions that others address to them. They\r\nalways keep apart, and never communicate with one another. An\r\nextremely curious fact which has been frequently noted by the\r\nsuperintendents of their section of the hospital, and by myself, is\r\nthis: From time to time, at very irregular intervals of two, three,\r\nand many months, without appreciable cause, and by the purely\r\nspontaneous effect of their illness, a very marked change takes\r\nplace in the condition of the two brothers. Both of them, at the\r\nsame time, and often on the same day, rouse themselves from their\r\nhabitual stupor and prostration; they make the same complaints, and\r\nthey come of their own accord to the physician, with an urgent\r\nrequest to be liberated. I have seen this strange thing occur, even\r\nwhen they were some miles apart, the one being at Bicêtre, and the\r\nother living at Saint-Anne.\"\r\n\r\nI sent a copy of this passage to the principal authorities among the\r\nphysicians to the insane in England, asking if they had ever\r\nwitnessed any similar case. In reply, I have received three\r\nnoteworthy instances, but none to be compared in their exact\r\nparallelism with that just given. The details of these three cases\r\nare painful, and it is not necessary to my general purpose that I\r\nshould further allude to them.\r\n\r\nThere is another curious French case of insanity in twins, which was\r\npointed out to me by Sir James Paget, described by Dr. Baume in the\r\n_Annales M. édico-Psychologiques_, 4 série, vol. i., 1863, p. 312,\r\nof which the following is an abstract. The original contains a few\r\nmore details, but is too long to quote: Francois and Martin, fifty\r\nyears of age, worked as railroad contractors between Quimper and\r\nChâteaulin. Martin had twice slight attacks of insanity. On January 15\r\na box was robbed in which the twins had deposited their savings. On\r\nthe night of January 23-24 both François (who lodged at Quimper) and\r\nMartin (who lived with his wife and children at St. Lorette, two\r\nleagues from Quimper) had the same dream at the same hour, three a.m.,\r\nand both awoke with a violent start, calling out, \"I have caught the\r\nthief! I have caught the thief! they are doing mischief to my brother!\"\r\nThey were both of them extremely agitated, and gave way to similar\r\nextravagances, dancing and leaping.\r\n\r\nMartin sprang on his grandchild, declaring that he was the thief,\r\nand would have strangled him if he had not been prevented; he then\r\nbecame steadily worse, complained of violent pains in his head, went\r\nout of doors on some excuse, and tried to drown himself in the river\r\nSteir, but was forcibly stopped by his son, who had watched and\r\nfollowed him. He was then taken to an asylum by gendarmes, where he\r\ndied in three hours. Francois, on his part, calmed down on the\r\nmorning of the 24th, and employed the day in inquiring about the\r\nrobbery. By a strange chance, he crossed his brother's path at the\r\nmoment when the latter was struggling with the gendarmes; then he\r\nhimself became maddened, giving way to extravagant gestures and using\r\nincoherent language (similar to that of his brother). He then asked\r\nto be bled, which was done, and afterwards, declaring himself to be\r\nbetter, went out on the pretext of executing some commission, but\r\nreally to drown himself in the River Steir, which he actually did,\r\nat the very spot where Martin had attempted to do the same thing a\r\nfew hours previously.\r\n\r\nThe next point which I shall mention in illustration of the\r\nextremely close resemblance between certain twins is the similarity\r\nin the association of their ideas. No less than eleven out of the\r\nthirty-five cases testify to this. They make the same remarks on the\r\nsame occasion, begin singing the same song at the same moment, and\r\nso on; or one would commence a sentence, and the other would finish\r\nit. An observant friend graphically described to me the effect\r\nproduced on her by two such twins whom she had met casually. She said:\r\n\"Their teeth grew alike, they spoke alike and together, and said the\r\nsame things, and seemed just like one person.\" One of the most\r\ncurious anecdotes that I have received concerning this similarity of\r\nideas was that one twin, A, who happened to be at a town in Scotland,\r\nbought a set of champagne glasses which caught his attention, as a\r\nsurprise for his brother B; while, at the same time, B, being in\r\nEngland, bought a similar set of precisely the same pattern as a\r\nsurprise for A. Other anecdotes of a like kind have reached me about\r\nthese twins.\r\n\r\nThe last point to which I shall allude regards the tastes and\r\ndispositions of the thirty-five pairs of twins. In sixteen\r\ncases--that is, in nearly one-half of them--these were described as\r\nclosely similar; in the remaining nineteen they were much alike, but\r\nsubject to certain named differences. These differences belonged\r\nalmost wholly to such groups of qualities as these: The one was the\r\nmore vigorous, fearless, energetic; the other was gentle, clinging,\r\nand timid; or the one was more ardent, the other more calm and placid;\r\nor again, the one was the more independent, original, and\r\nself-contained; the other the more generous, hasty, and vivacious.\r\nIn short, the difference was that of intensity or energy in one or\r\nother of its protean forms; it did not extend more deeply into the\r\nstructure of the characters. The more vivacious might be subdued by\r\nill health, until he assumed the character of the other; or the\r\nlatter might be raised by excellent health to that of the former.\r\nThe difference was in the key-note, not in the melody.\r\n\r\nIt follows from what has been said concerning the similar\r\ndispositions of the twins, the similarity in the associations of\r\ntheir ideas, of their special ailments, and of their illnesses\r\ngenerally, that the resemblances are not superficial, but extremely\r\nintimate. I have only two cases of a strong bodily resemblance being\r\naccompanied by mental diversity, and one case only of the converse\r\nkind. It must be remembered that the conditions which govern extreme\r\nlikeness between twins are not the same as those between ordinary\r\nbrothers and sisters, and that it would be incorrect to conclude\r\nfrom what has just been said about the twins that mental and bodily\r\nlikeness are invariably co-ordinate, such being by no means the case.\r\n\r\nWe are now in a position to understand that the phrase \"close\r\nsimilarity\" is no exaggeration, and to realise the value of the\r\nevidence I am about to adduce. Here are thirty-five cases of twins\r\nwho were \"closely alike\" in body and mind when they were young, and\r\nwho have been reared exactly alike up to their early manhood and\r\nwomanhood. Since then the conditions of their lives have changed;\r\nwhat change of Nurture has produced the most variation?\r\n\r\nIt was with no little interest that I searched the records of the\r\nthirty-five cases for an answer; and they gave an answer that was\r\nnot altogether direct, but it was distinct, and not at all what I\r\nhad expected. They showed me that in some cases the resemblance of\r\nbody and mind had continued unaltered up to old age, notwithstanding\r\nvery different conditions of life; and they showed in the other\r\ncases that the parents ascribed such dissimilarity as there was,\r\nwholly or almost wholly to some form of illness. In four cases it\r\nwas scarlet fever; in a fifth, typhus; in a sixth, a slight effect\r\nwas ascribed to a nervous fever; in a seventh it was the effect of\r\nan Indian climate; in an eighth, an illness (unnamed) of nine\r\nmonths' duration; in a ninth, varicose veins; in a tenth, a bad\r\nfracture of the leg, which prevented all active exercise afterwards;\r\nand there were three additional instances of undefined forms of ill\r\nhealth. It will be sufficient to quote one of the returns; in this\r\nthe father writes:\r\n\r\n\"At birth they were _exactly_ alike, except that one was born with a\r\nbad varicose affection, the effect of which had been to prevent any\r\nviolent exercise, such as dancing or running, and, as she has grown\r\nolder, to make her more serious and thoughtful. Had it not been for\r\nthis infirmity, I think the two would have been as exactly alike as\r\nit is possible for two women to be, both mentally and physically;\r\neven now they are constantly mistaken for one another.\"\r\n\r\nIn only a very few cases is some allusion made to the dissimilarity\r\nbeing partly due to the combined action of many small influences,\r\nand in none of the thirty-five cases is it largely, much less wholly,\r\nascribed to that cause. In not a single instance have I met with a\r\nword about the growing dissimilarity being due to the action of the\r\nfirm free-will of one or both of the twins, which had triumphed over\r\nnatural tendencies; and yet a large proportion of my correspondents\r\nhappen to be clergymen, whose bent of mind is opposed, as I feel\r\nassured from the tone of their letters, to a necessitarian view of\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nIt has been remarked that a growing diversity between twins may be\r\nascribed to the tardy development of naturally diverse qualities;\r\nbut we have a right, upon the evidence I have received, to go\r\nfarther than this. We have seen that a few twins retain their close\r\nresemblance through life; in other words, instances do exist of an\r\napparently thorough similarity of nature, in which such difference\r\nof external circumstances as may be consistent with the ordinary\r\nconditions of the same social rank and country do not create\r\ndissimilarity. Positive evidence, such as this, cannot be outweighed\r\nby any amount of negative evidence. Therefore, in those cases where\r\nthere is a growing diversity, and where no external cause can be\r\nassigned either by the twins themselves or by their family for it,\r\nwe may feel sure that it must be chiefly or altogether due to a want\r\nof thorough similarity in their nature. Nay, further, in some cases\r\nit is distinctly affirmed that the growing dissimilarity can be\r\naccounted for in no other way. We may, therefore, broadly conclude\r\nthat the only circumstance, within the range of those by which\r\npersons of similar conditions of life are affected, that is capable\r\nof producing a marked effect on the character of adults, is illness\r\nor some accident which causes physical infirmity. The twins who\r\nclosely resembled each other in childhood and early youth, and were\r\nreared under not very dissimilar conditions, either grow unlike\r\nthrough the development of natural characteristics which had lain\r\ndormant at first, or else they continue their lives, keeping time\r\nlike two watches, hardly to be thrown out of accord except by some\r\nphysical jar. Nature is far stronger than Nurture within the limited\r\nrange that I have been careful to assign to the latter.\r\n\r\nThe effect of illness, as shown by these replies, is great, and well\r\ndeserves further consideration. It appears that the constitution of\r\nyouth is not so elastic as we are apt to think, but that an attack,\r\nsay of scarlet fever, leaves a permanent mark, easily to be measured\r\nby the present method of comparison. This recalls an impression made\r\nstrongly on my mind several years ago, by the sight of some curves\r\ndrawn by a mathematical friend. He took monthly measurements of the\r\ncircumference of his children's heads during the first few years of\r\ntheir lives, and he laid down the successive measurements on the\r\nsuccessive lines of a piece of ruled paper, by taking the edge of\r\nthe paper as a base. He then joined the free ends of the lines, and\r\nso obtained a curve of growth. These curves had, on the whole, that\r\nregularity of sweep that might have been expected, but each of them\r\nshowed occasional halts, like the landing-places on a long flight of\r\nstairs. The development had been arrested by something, and was not\r\nmade up for by after growth. Now, on the same piece of paper my\r\nfriend had also registered the various infantile illnesses of the\r\nchildren, and corresponding to each illness was one of these halts.\r\nThere remained no doubt in my mind that, if these illnesses had been\r\nwarded off, the development of the children would have been\r\nincreased by almost the precise amount lost in these halts. In other\r\nwords, the disease had drawn largely upon the capital, and not only\r\non the income, of their constitutions. I hope these remarks may\r\ninduce some men of science to repeat similar experiments on their\r\nchildren of the future. They may compress two years of a child's\r\nhistory on one side of a ruled half-sheet of foolscap paper, if they\r\ncause each successive line to stand for a successive month,\r\nbeginning from the birth of the child; and if they economise space\r\nby laying, not the 0-inch division of the tape against the edge of\r\nthe pages, but, say, the 10-inch division.\r\n\r\nThe steady and pitiless march of the hidden weaknesses in our\r\nconstitutions, through illness to death, is painfully revealed by\r\nthese histories of twins. We are too apt to look upon illness and\r\ndeath as capricious events, and there are some who ascribe them to\r\nthe direct effect of supernatural interference, whereas the fact of\r\nthe maladies of two twins being continually alike shows that illness\r\nand death are necessary incidents in a regular sequence of\r\nconstitutional changes beginning at birth, and upon which external\r\ncircumstances have, on the whole, very small effect. In cases where\r\nthe maladies of the twins are continually alike, the clocks of their\r\ntwo lives move regularly on at the same rate, governed by their\r\ninternal mechanism. When the hands approach the hour, there are\r\nsudden clicks, followed by a whirring of wheels; the moment that\r\nthey touch it, the strokes fall. Necessitarians may derive new\r\narguments from the life-histories of twins.\r\n\r\nWe will now consider the converse side of our subject, which appears\r\nto me even the more important of the two. Hitherto we have\r\ninvestigated cases where the similarity at first was close, but\r\nafterwards became less; now we will examine those in which there was\r\ngreat dissimilarity at first, and will see how far an identity of\r\nnurture in childhood and youth tended to assimilate them. As has\r\nbeen already mentioned, there is a large proportion of cases of\r\nsharply-contrasted characteristics, both of body and mind, among\r\ntwins. I have twenty such cases, given with much detail. It is a\r\nfact that extreme dissimilarity, such as existed between Esau and\r\nJacob, is a no less marked peculiarity in twins of the same sex than\r\nextreme similarity. On this curious point, and on much else in the\r\nhistory of twins, I have many remarks to make, but this is not the\r\nplace to make them.\r\n\r\nThe evidence given by the twenty cases above mentioned is absolutely\r\naccordant, so that the character of the whole may be exactly\r\nconveyed by a few quotations.\r\n\r\n(1.) One parent says:--\"They have had _exactly the same nurture_\r\nfrom their birth up to the present time; they are both perfectly\r\nhealthy and strong, yet they are otherwise as dissimilar as two boys\r\ncould be, physically, mentally, and in their emotional nature.\"\r\n\r\n(2.) \"I can answer most decidedly that the twins have been perfectly\r\ndissimilar in character, habits, and likeness from the moment of\r\ntheir birth to the present time, though they were nursed by the same\r\nwoman, went to school together, and were never separated till the\r\nage of fifteen.\"\r\n\r\n(3.) \"They have never been separated, never the least differently\r\ntreated in food, clothing, or education; both teethed at the same\r\ntime, both had measles, whooping-cough, and scarlatina at the same\r\ntime, and neither had had any other serious illness. Both are and\r\nhave been exceedingly healthy, and have good abilities, yet they\r\ndiffer as much from each other in mental cast as any one of my\r\nfamily differs from another.\"\r\n\r\n(4.) \"Very dissimilar in body and mind: the one is quiet, retiring,\r\nand slow but sure; good-tempered, but disposed to be sulky when\r\nprovoked;--the other is quick, vivacious, forward, acquiring easily\r\nand forgetting soon; quick-tempered and choleric, but quickly\r\nforgiving and forgetting. They have been educated together and never\r\nseparated.\"\r\n\r\n(5.) \"They were never alike either in body or mind, and their\r\ndissimilarity increases daily. The external influences have been\r\nidentical; they have never been separated.\"\r\n\r\n(6.) \"The two sisters are very different in ability and disposition.\r\nThe one is retiring, but firm and determined; she has no taste for\r\nmusic or drawing. The other is of an active, excitable temperament:\r\nshe displays an unusual amount of quickness and talent, and is\r\npassionately fond of music and drawing. From infancy, they have been\r\nrarely separated even at school, and as children visiting their\r\nfriends, they always went together.\"\r\n\r\n(7.) \"They have been treated exactly alike  both were brought up by\r\nhand; they have been under the same nurse and governess from their\r\nbirth, and they are very fond of each other. Their increasing\r\ndissimilarity must be ascribed to a natural difference of mind and\r\ncharacter, as there has been nothing in their treatment to account\r\nfor it.\"\r\n\r\n(8.) \"They are as different as possible. [A minute and unsparing\r\nanalysis of the characters of the two twins is given by their father,\r\nmost instructive to read, but impossible to publish without the\r\ncertainty of wounding the feelings of one of the twins, if these\r\npages should chance to fall under his eyes.] They were brought up\r\nentirely by hand, that is, on cow's milk, and treated by one nurse\r\nin precisely the same manner.\"\r\n\r\n(9.) \"The home-training and influence were precisely the same, and\r\ntherefore I consider the dissimilarity to be accounted for almost\r\nentirely by innate disposition and by causes over which we have no\r\ncontrol.\"\r\n\r\n(10.) \"This case is, I should think, somewhat remarkable for\r\ndissimilarity in physique as well as for strong contrast in character.\r\nThey have been unlike in body and mind throughout their lives. Both\r\nwere reared in a country house, and both were at the same schools\r\ntill _aet._ 16.\"\r\n\r\n(11.) \"Singularly unlike in body and mind from babyhood; in looks,\r\ndispositions, and tastes they are quite different. I think I may\r\nsay the dissimilarity was innate, and developed more by time than\r\ncircumstance.\"\r\n\r\n(12.) \"We were never in the least degree alike. I should say my\r\nsister's and my own character are diametrically opposed, and have\r\nbeen utterly different from our birth, though a very strong\r\naffection subsists between us.\"\r\n\r\n(13.) The father remarks:--\"They were curiously different in body\r\nand mind from their birth.\"\r\n\r\nThe surviving twin (a senior wrangler of Cambridge) adds:--\"A fact\r\nstruck all our school contemporaries, that my brother and I were\r\ncomplementary, so to speak, in point of ability and disposition. He\r\nwas contemplative, poetical, and literary to a remarkable degree,\r\nshowing great power in that line. I was practical, mathematical, and\r\nlinguistic. Between us we should have made a very decent sort of a\r\nman.\"\r\n\r\nI could quote others just as strong as these, in some of which the\r\nabove phrase \"complementary\" also appears, while I have not a single\r\ncase in which my correspondents speak of originally dissimilar\r\ncharacters having become assimilated through identity of nurture.\r\nHowever, a somewhat exaggerated estimate of dissimilarity may be due\r\nto the tendency of relatives to dwell unconsciously on distinctive\r\npeculiarities, and to disregard the far more numerous points of\r\nlikeness that would first attract the notice of a stranger. Thus in\r\ncase 11 I find the remark, \"Strangers see a strong likeness between\r\nthem, but none who knows them well can perceive it.\"  Instances are\r\ncommon of slight acquaintances mistaking members, and especially\r\ndaughters of a family, for one another, between whom intimate\r\nfriends can barely discover a resemblance. Still, making reasonable\r\nallowance for unintentional exaggeration, the impression that all\r\nthis evidence leaves on the mind is one of some wonder whether\r\nnurture can do anything at all, beyond giving instruction and\r\nprofessional training. It emphatically corroborates and goes far\r\nbeyond the conclusions to which we had already been driven by the\r\ncases of similarity. In those, the causes of divergence began to act\r\nabout the period of adult life, when the characters had become\r\nsomewhat fixed; but here the causes conducive to assimilation began\r\nto act from the earliest moment of the existence of the twins, when\r\nthe disposition was most pliant, and they were continuous until the\r\nperiod of adult life. There is no escape from the conclusion that\r\nnature prevails enormously over nurture when the differences of\r\nnurture do not exceed what is commonly to be found among persons of\r\nthe same rank of society and in the same country. My fear is, that\r\nmy evidence may seem to prove too much, and be discredited on that\r\naccount, as it appears contrary to all experience that nurture\r\nshould go for so little. But experience is often fallacious in\r\nascribing great effects to trifling circumstances. Many a person has\r\namused himself with throwing bits of stick into a tiny brook and\r\nwatching their progress; how they are arrested, first by one chance\r\nobstacle, then by another; and again, how their onward course is\r\nfacilitated by a combination of circumstances. He might ascribe much\r\nimportance to each of these events, and think how largely the\r\ndestiny of the stick had been governed by a series of trifling\r\naccidents. Nevertheless all the sticks succeed in passing down the\r\ncurrent, and in the long-run, they travel at nearly the same rate. So\r\nit is with life, in respect to the several accidents which seem to\r\nhave had a great effect upon our careers. The one element, that\r\nvaries in different individuals, but is constant in each of them, is\r\nthe natural tendency; it corresponds to the current in the stream,\r\nand inevitably asserts itself.\r\n\r\nMuch stress is laid on the persistence of moral impressions made in\r\nchildhood, and the conclusion is drawn, that the effects of early\r\nteaching must be important in a corresponding degree. I acknowledge\r\nthe fact, so far as has been explained in the chapter on Early\r\nSentiments, but there is a considerable set-off on the other side.\r\nThose teachings that conform to the natural aptitudes of the child\r\nleave much more enduring marks than others. Now both the teachings\r\nand the natural aptitudes of the child are usually derived from its\r\nparents. They are able to understand the ways of one another more\r\nintimately than is possible to persons not of the same blood, and\r\nthe child instinctively assimilates the habits and ways of thought\r\nof its parents. Its disposition is \"educated\" by them, in the true\r\nsense of the word; that is to say, it is evoked, not formed by them.\r\nOn these grounds I ascribe the persistence of many habits that date\r\nfrom early home education, to the peculiarities of the instructors\r\nrather than to the period when the instruction was given. The marks\r\nleft on the memory by the instructions of a foster-mother are soon\r\nsponged clean away. Consider the history of the cuckoo, which is\r\nreared exclusively by foster-mothers. It is probable that nearly\r\nevery young cuckoo, during a series of many hundred generations, has\r\nbeen brought up in a family whose language is a chirp and a twitter.\r\nBut the cuckoo cannot or will not adopt that language, or any other\r\nof the habits of its foster-parents. It leaves its birthplace as\r\nsoon as it is able, and finds out its own kith and kin, and\r\nidentifies itself henceforth with them. So utterly are its earliest\r\ninstructions in an alien bird-language neglected, and so completely\r\nis its new education successful, that the note of the cuckoo tribe\r\nis singularly correct.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDOMESTICATION OF ANIMALS.[14]\r\n\r\n  [Footnote 14: This memoir is reprinted from the _Transactions of\r\n  the Ethnological Society_]\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the subject of Nature and Nurture, I would direct\r\nattention to evidence bearing on the conditions under which animals\r\nappear first to have been domesticated. It clearly shows the small\r\npower of nurture against adverse natural tendencies.\r\n\r\nThe few animals that we now possess in a state of domestication were\r\nfirst reclaimed from wildness in prehistoric times. Our remote\r\nbarbarian ancestors must be credited with having accomplished a very\r\nremarkable feat, which no subsequent generation has rivalled. The\r\nutmost that we of modern times have succeeded in doing, is to\r\nimprove the races of those animals that we received from our\r\nforefathers in an already domesticated condition.\r\n\r\nThere are only two reasonable solutions of this exceedingly curious\r\nfact. The one is, that men of highly original ideas, like the\r\nmythical Prometheus, arose from time to time in the dawn of human\r\nprogress, and left their respective marks on the world by being the\r\nfirst to subjugate the camel, the llama, the reindeer, the horse,\r\nthe ox, the sheep, the hog, the dog, or some other animal to the\r\nservice of man. The other hypothesis is that only a few species of\r\nanimals are fitted by their nature to become domestic, and that\r\nthese were discovered long ago through the exercise of no higher\r\nintelligence than is to be found among barbarous tribes of the\r\npresent day. The failure of civilised man to add to the number of\r\ndomesticated species would on this supposition be due to the fact\r\nthat all the suitable material whence domestic animals could be\r\nderived has been long since worked out.\r\n\r\nI submit that the latter hypothesis is the true one for the reasons\r\nabout to be given; and if so, the finality of the process of\r\ndomestication must be accepted as one of the most striking instances\r\nof the inflexibility of natural disposition, and of the limitations\r\nthereby imposed upon the [15] choice of careers for animals, and by\r\nanalogy for those of men.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: _Transactionsof the Ethnological Society_, 1865,\r\nwith an alteration in the opening and concluding paragraphs, and\r\nwith a few verbal emendations. If I had discussed the subject now\r\nfor the first time I should have given extracts from the and with a\r\nfew verbal emendations. If I had discussed the subject now for the\r\nfirst time I should have given extracts from the works of the\r\ntravellers of the day, but it seemed needless to reopen the inquiry\r\nmerely to give it a more modern air. I have also preferred to let\r\nthe chapter stand as it was written, because considerable portions of\r\nit have been quoted by various authors (_e.g._ Bagehot, _Economic\r\nStudies_, pp. 161 to 166: Longman, 1880), and the original memoir is\r\nnot easily accessible.]\r\n\r\nMy argument will be this:--All savages maintain pet animals, many\r\ntribes have sacred ones, and kings of ancient states have imported\r\ncaptive animals on a vast scale, for purposes of show, from\r\nneighbouring countries. I infer that every animal, of any pretensions,\r\nhas been tamed over and over again, and has had numerous\r\nopportunities of becoming domesticated. But the cases are rare in\r\nwhich these opportunities have led to any result. No animal is\r\nfitted for domestication unless it fulfils certain stringent\r\nconditions, which I will endeavour to state and to discuss. My\r\nconclusion is, that all domesticable animals of any note have long\r\nago fallen under the yoke of man. In short, that the animal creation\r\nhas been pretty thoroughly, though half unconsciously, explored, by\r\nthe every-day habits of rude races and simple civilisations.\r\n\r\nIt is a fact familiar to all travellers, that savages frequently\r\ncapture young animals of various kinds, and rear them as favourites,\r\nand sell or present them as curiosities. Human nature is generally\r\nakin: savages may be brutal, but they are not on that account devoid\r\nof our taste for taming and caressing young animals; nay, it is not\r\nimprobable that some races may possess it in a more marked degree\r\nthan ourselves, because it is a childish taste with us; and the\r\nmotives of an adult barbarian are very similar to those of a\r\ncivilised child.\r\n\r\nIn proving this assertion, I feel embarrassed with the multiplicity\r\nof my facts. I have only space to submit a few typical instances,\r\nand must, therefore, beg it will be borne in mind that the following\r\nlist could be largely reinforced. Yet even if I inserted all I have\r\nthus far been able to collect, I believe insufficient justice would\r\nbe done to the real truth of the case. Captive animals do not\r\ncommonly fall within the observation of travellers, who mostly\r\nconfine themselves to their own encampments, and abstain from\r\nentering the dirty dwellings of the natives; neither do the majority\r\nof travellers think tamed animals worthy of detailed mention.\r\nConsequently the anecdotes of their existence are scattered\r\nsparingly among a large number of volumes. It is when those\r\ntravellers are questioned who have lived long and intimately with\r\nsavage tribes that the plenitude of available instances becomes most\r\napparent.\r\n\r\nI proceed to give anecdotes of animals being tamed in various parts\r\nof the world, at dates when they were severally beyond the reach of\r\ncivilised influences, and where, therefore, the pleasure taken by\r\nthe natives in taming them must be ascribed to their unassisted\r\nmother-wit. It will be inferred that the same rude races who were\r\nobserved to be capable of great fondness towards animals in\r\nparticular instances, would not unfrequently show it in others.\r\n\r\n[North America.]--The traveller Hearne, who wrote towards the end of\r\nthe last century, relates the following story of moose or elks in\r\nthe more northern parts of North America. He says:--\r\n\r\n\"I have repeatedly seen moose at Churchill as tame as sheep and even\r\nmore so.... The same Indian that brought them to the Factory had, in\r\nthe year 1770, two others so tame that when on his passage to Prince\r\nof Wales's Fort in a canoe, the moose always followed him along the\r\nbank of the river; and at night, or on any other occasion when the\r\nIndians landed, the young moose generally came and fondled on them,\r\nas the most domestic animal would have done, and never offered to\r\nstray from the tents.\"\r\n\r\nSir John Richardson, in an obliging answer to my inquiries about the\r\nIndians of North America, after mentioning the bison calves, wolves,\r\nand other animals that they frequently capture and keep, said:--\r\n\r\n\"It is not unusual, I have heard, for the Indians to bring up young\r\nbears, the women giving them milk from their own breasts.\"\r\n\r\nHe mentions that he himself purchased a young bear, and adds:--\r\n\r\n\"The red races are fond of pets and treat them kindly; and in\r\npurchasing them there is always the unwillingness of the women and\r\nchildren to overcome, rather than any dispute about price. My young\r\nbear used to rob the women of the berries, they had gathered, but\r\nthe loss was borne with good nature.\"\r\n\r\nI will again quote Hearne, who is unsurpassed for his minute and\r\naccurate narratives of social scenes among the Indians and Esquimaux.\r\nIn speaking of wolves he says:--\r\n\r\n\"They always burrow underground to bring forth their young, and\r\nthough it is natural to suppose them very fierce at those times, yet\r\nI have frequently seen the Indians go to their dens and take out the\r\nyoung ones and play with them. I never knew a Northern Indian hurt\r\none of them; on the contrary, they always put them carefully into\r\nthe den again; and I have sometimes seen them paint the faces of the\r\nyoung wolves with vermilion or red ochre.\"\r\n\r\n[South America.]--Ulloa, an ancient traveller, says:--\r\n\r\n\"Though the Indian women breed fowl and other domestic animals in\r\ntheir cottages, they never eat them: and even conceive such a\r\nfondness for them, that they will not sell them, much less kill them\r\nwith their own hands. So that if a stranger who is obliged to pass\r\nthe night in one of their cottages, offers ever so much money for a\r\nfowl, they refuse to part with it, and he finds himself under the\r\nnecessity of killing the fowl himself. At this his landlady shrieks,\r\ndissolves into tears, and wrings her hands, as if it had been an\r\nonly son, till seeing the mischief past mending, she wipes her eyes\r\nand quietly takes what the traveller offers her.\"\r\n\r\nThe care of the South American Indians, as Quiloa truly states, is\r\nby no means confined to fowls. Mr. Bates, the distinguished\r\ntraveller and naturalist of the Amazons, has favoured me with a list\r\nof twenty-two species of quadrupeds that he has found tame in the\r\nencampments of the tribes of that valley. It includes the tapir, the\r\nagouti, the guinea-pig, and the peccari. He has also noted five\r\nspecies of quadrupeds that were in captivity, but not tamed. These\r\ninclude the jaguar, the great ant-eater, and the armadillo. His list\r\nof tamed birds is still more extensive.\r\n\r\n[North Africa.]--The ancient Egyptians had a positive passion for\r\ntamed animals, such as antelopes, monkeys, crocodiles, panthers, and\r\nhyenas. Mr. Goodwin, the eminent Egyptologist, informed me that\r\n\"they anticipated our zoological tastes completely,\" and that some\r\nof the pictures referring to tamed animals are among their very\r\nearliest monuments, viz. 2000 or 3000 years B.C. Mr. Mansfield\r\nParkyns, who passed many years in Abyssinia and the countries of the\r\nUpper Nile, writes me word in answer to my inquiries;--\r\n\r\n\"I am sure that negroes often capture and keep alive wild animals. I\r\nhave bought them and received them as presents--wild cats, jackals,\r\npanthers, the wild dog, the two best lions now in the Zoological\r\nGardens, monkeys innumerable and of all sorts, and mongoose. I cannot\r\nsay that I distinctly recollect any pets among the _lowest_ orders\r\nof men that I met with, such as the Denkas, but I am sure they exist,\r\nand in this way. When I was on the White Nile and at Khartoum, very\r\nfew merchants went up the White Nile; none had stations. They were\r\nlittle known to the natives; but none returned without some live\r\nanimal or bird which they had procured from them. While I was at\r\nKhartoum, there came an Italian wild beast showman, after the\r\nWombwell style. He made a tour of the towns up to Doul and Fazogly,\r\nKordofan and the peninsula, and collected a large number of animals.\r\nThus my opinion distinctly is, that negroes do keep wild animals\r\nalive. _I am sure of it_; though I can only vaguely recollect them\r\nin one or two cases. I remember some chief in Abyssinia who had a\r\npet lion which he used to tease, and I have often seen monkeys about\r\nhuts.\"\r\n\r\n[Equatorial Africa.]--The most remarkable instance I have met with\r\nin modern Africa is the account of a menagerie that existed up to\r\nthe beginning of the reign of the present king of the Wahumas, on\r\nthe shores of Lake Nyanza. Suna, the great despot of that country,\r\nreigned till 1857. Captains Burton and Speke were in the\r\nneighbourhood in the following year, and Captain Burton thus\r\ndescribes (_Journal R. G. Soc._, xxix. 282) the report he received\r\nof Suna's collection:--\r\n\r\n\"He had a large menagerie of lions, elephants, leopards, and similar\r\nbeasts of disport; he also kept for amusement fifteen or sixteen\r\nalbinos; and so greedy was he of novelty, that even a cock of\r\npeculiar form or colour would have been forwarded by its owner to\r\nfeed his eyes.\"\r\n\r\nCaptain Speke, in his subsequent journey to the Nile, passed many\r\nmonths at Uganda, as the guest of Suna's youthful successor, M'tese.\r\nThe fame of the old menagerie was fresh when Captain Speke was there.\r\nHe wrote to me as follows concerning it:--\r\n\r\n\"I was told Suna kept buffaloes, antelopes, and animals of all\r\ncolours' (meaning 'sorts'), and in equal quantities.  M'tese, his son,\r\nno sooner came to the throne, than he indulged in shooting them down\r\nbefore his admiring wives, and now he has only one buffalo and a few\r\nparrots left.\"\r\n\r\nIn Kouka, near Lake Tchad, antelopes and ostriches are both kept tame,\r\nas I was informed by Dr. Barth.\r\n\r\n[South Africa.]--The instances are very numerous in South Africa\r\nwhere the Boers and half-castes amuse themselves with rearing zebras,\r\nantelopes, and the like; but I have not found many instances among\r\nthe native races. Those that are best known to us are mostly nomad\r\nand in a chronic state of hunger, and therefore disinclined to\r\nnurture captured animals as pets; nevertheless, some instances can\r\nbe adduced. Livingstone alludes to an extreme fondness for small\r\ntame singing-birds (pp. 324 and 453). Dr. (now Sir John) Kirk, who\r\naccompanied him in later years, mentions guinea-fowl--that do not\r\nbreed in confinement, and are merely kept as pets--in the Shiré\r\nvalley, and Mr. Oswell has furnished me with one similar anecdote. I\r\nfeel, however, satisfied that abundant instances could be found if\r\nproperly sought for. It was the frequency with which I recollect to\r\nhave heard of tamed animals when I myself was in South Africa,\r\nthough I never witnessed any instance, that first suggested to me\r\nthe arguments of the present paper. Sir John Kirk informs me that:\r\n\r\n\"As you approach the coast or Portuguese settlements, pets of all\r\nkinds become very common; but then the opportunity of occasionally\r\nselling them to advantage may help to increase the number; still,\r\nthe more settled life has much to do with it.\"\r\n\r\nIn confirmation of this view, I will quote an early writer,\r\nPigafetta (_Hakluyt Coll._, ii. 562), on the South African kingdom\r\nof Congo, who found a strange medley of animals in captivity, long\r\nbefore the demands of semi-civilisation had begun to prompt their\r\ncollection:--\r\n\r\nThe King of Congo, on being Christianised by the Jesuit missionaries\r\nin the sixteenth century, \"signified that whoever had any idols\r\nshould deliver them to the lieutenants of the country. And within\r\nless than a month all the idols which they worshipped were brought\r\ninto court, and certainly the number of these toys was infinite, for\r\nevery man adored what he liked without any measure or reason at all.\r\nSome kept serpents of horrible figures, some worshipped the greatest\r\ngoats they could get, some leopards, and others monstrous creatures.\r\nSome held in veneration certain unclean fowls, etc. Neither did they\r\ncontent themselves with worshipping the said creatures when alive,\r\nbut also adored the very skins of them when they were dead and\r\nstuffed with straw.\"\r\n\r\n[Australia.]--Mr. Woodfield records the following touching anecdote\r\nin a paper communicated to the Ethnological Society, as occurring in\r\nan unsettled part of West Australia, where the natives rank as the\r\nlowest race upon the earth:--\r\n\r\n\"During the summer of 1858-9 the Murchison river was visited by\r\ngreat numbers of kites, the native country of these birds being\r\nShark's Bay. As other birds were scarce, we shot many of these kites,\r\nmerely for the sake of practice, the natives eagerly devouring them\r\nas fast as they were killed. One day a man and woman, natives of\r\nShark's Bay, came to the Murchison, and the woman immediately\r\nrecognising the birds as coming from her country, assured us that\r\nthe natives there never kill them, and that they are so tame that\r\nthey will perch on the shoulders of the women and eat from their\r\nhands. On seeing one shot she wept bitterly, and not even the offer\r\nof the bird could assuage her grief, for she absolutely refused to\r\neat it. No more kites were shot while she remained among us.\"\r\n\r\nThe Australian women habitually feed the puppies they intend to rear\r\nfrom their own breasts, and show an affection to them equal, if not\r\nexceeding, that to their own infants. Sir Charles Nicholson informs\r\nme that he has known an extraordinary passion for cats to be\r\ndemonstrated by Australian women at Fort Phillip.\r\n\r\n[New Guinea Group.]--Captain Develyn is reported (Bennett,\r\n_Naturalist in Australia_, p. 244) to say of the island of New\r\nBritain, near Australia, that the natives consider cassowaries \"to a\r\ncertain degree sacred, and rear them as pets. They carry them in their\r\narms, and entertain a great affection for them.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Huxley informs me that he has seen sucking-pigs nursed at\r\nthe breasts of women, apparently as pets, in islands of the New\r\nGuinea Group.\r\n\r\n[Polynesia.]--The savage and cannibal Fijians were no exceptions to\r\nthe general rule, for Dr. Seemann wrote me word that they make pets\r\nof the flying fox (bat), the lizard, and parroquet. Captain Wilkes,\r\nin his exploring expedition (ii. 122), says the pigeon in the Samoon\r\nislands \"is commonly kept as a plaything, and particularly by the\r\nchiefs. One of our officers unfortunately on one occasion shot a\r\npigeon, which caused great commotion, for the bird was a king pigeon,\r\nand to kill it was thought as great a crime as to take the life of a\r\nman.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Ellis, writing of these islands (_Polynesian Researches_, ii. 285),\r\nsays:--\r\n\r\n\"Eels are great favourites, and are tamed and fed till they attain\r\nan enormous size. Taoarii had several in different parts of the\r\nisland. These pets were kept in large holes, two or three feet deep,\r\npartially filled with water. I have been several times with the\r\nyoung chief, when he has sat down by the side of the hole, and by\r\ngiving a shrill sort of whistle, has brought out an enormous eel,\r\nwhich has moved about the surface of the water and eaten with\r\nconfidence out of his master's hand.\"\r\n\r\n[Syria.]--I will conclude this branch of my argument by quoting the\r\nmost ancient allusion to a pet that I can discover in writing,\r\nthough some of the Egyptian pictured representations are\r\nconsiderably older. It is the parable spoken by the Prophet Samuel\r\nto King David, that is expressed in the following words:--\r\n\r\n\"The poor man had nothing save one little ewe lamb, which he had\r\nbought and nourished up: and it grew up together with him and with\r\nhis children; it did eat of his own meat, and drank of his own cup,\r\nand lay in his bosom, and was to him as a daughter.\"\r\n\r\nWe will now turn to the next stage of our argument. Not only do\r\nsavages rear animals as pets, but communities maintain them as sacred.\r\nThe ox of India and the brute gods of Egypt occur to us at once; the\r\nsame superstition prevails widely. The quotation already given from\r\nPigafetta is in point; the fact is too well known to readers of\r\ntravel to make it necessary to devote space to its proof. I will\r\ntherefore simply give a graphic account, written by M. Jules Gérard,\r\nof Whydah in West Africa:--\r\n\r\n\"I visited the Temple of Serpents in this town, where thirty of\r\nthese monstrous deities were asleep in various attitudes. Each day\r\nat sunset, a priest brings them a certain number of sheep, goats,\r\nfowls, etc., which are slaughtered in the temple and then divided\r\namong the 'gods.' Subsequently during the night they (? the priests)\r\nspread themselves about the town, entering the houses in various\r\nquarters in search of further offerings. It is forbidden under\r\npenalty of death to kill, wound, or even strike one of these sacred\r\nserpents, or any other of the same species, and only the priests\r\npossess the privilege of taking hold of them, for the purpose of\r\nreinstating them in the temple should they be found elsewhere.\"\r\n\r\nIt would be tedious and unnecessary to adduce more instances of wild\r\nanimals being nurtured in the encampments of savages, either as pets\r\nor as sacred animals. It will be found on inquiry that few travellers\r\nhave failed altogether to observe them. If we consider the small number\r\nof encampments they severally visited in their line of march, compared\r\nwith the vast number that are spread over the whole area, which is or\r\nhas been inhabited by rude races, we may obtain some idea of the\r\nthousands of places at which half-unconscious attempts at domestication\r\nare being made in each year. These thousands must themselves be multiplied\r\nmany thousandfold, if we endeavour to calculate the number of similar\r\nattempts that have been made since men like ourselves began to inhabit\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nMy argument, strong as it is, admits of being considerably\r\nstrengthened by the following consideration:--\r\n\r\nThe natural inclination of barbarians is often powerfully reinforced\r\nby an enormous demand for captured live animals on the part of their\r\nmore civilised neighbours. A desire to create vast hunting-grounds\r\nand menageries and amphitheatrical shows, seems naturally to occur\r\nto the monarchs who preside over early civilisations, and travellers\r\ncontinually remark that, whenever there is a market for live animals,\r\nsavages will supply them in any quantities. The means they employ to\r\ncatch game for their daily food readily admits of their taking them\r\nalive. Pit-falls, stake-nets, and springes do not kill. If the\r\nsavage captures an animal unhurt, and can make more by selling it\r\nalive than dead, he will doubtless do so. He is well fitted by\r\neducation to keep a wild animal in captivity. His mode of pursuing\r\ngame requires a more intimate knowledge of the habits of beasts than\r\nis ever acquired by sportsmen who use more perfect weapons. A savage\r\nis obliged to steal upon his game, and to watch like a jackal for\r\nthe leavings of large beasts of prey. His own mode of life is akin\r\nto that of the creatures he hunts. Consequently, the savage is a\r\ngood gamekeeper; captured animals thrive in his charge, and he finds\r\nit remunerative to take them a long way to market. The demands of\r\nancient Rome appear to have penetrated Northern Africa as far or\r\nfarther than the steps of our modern explorers. The chief centres of\r\nimport of wild animals were Egypt, Assyria (and other Eastern\r\nmonarchies), Rome, Mexico, and Peru. I have not yet been able to\r\nlearn what were the habits of Hindostan or China. The modern\r\nmenagerie of Lucknow is the only considerable native effort in those\r\nparts with which I am acquainted.\r\n\r\n[Egypt.]--The mutilated statistical tablet of Karnak (_Trans. R. Soc.\r\nLit._, 1847, p. 369, and 1863, p. 65) refers to an armed invasion of\r\nArmenia by Thothmes III., and the payment of a large tribute of\r\nantelopes and birds. When Ptolemy Philadelphus feted the\r\nAlexandrians (_Athenoeus_, v.), the Ethiopians brought dogs,\r\nbuffaloes, bears, leopards, lynxes, a giraffe, and a rhinoceros.\r\nDoubtless this description of gifts was common. Live beasts are the\r\none article of curiosity and amusement that barbarians can offer to\r\ncivilised nations.\r\n\r\n[Assyria.]--Mr. Fox Talbot thus translates (_Journal Asiatic Soc._,\r\nxix. 124) part of the inscription on the black obelisk of Ashurakbal\r\nfound in Nineveh and now in the British Museum:--\r\n\r\n\"He caught in hunter's toils (a blank number) of armi, turakhi, nali,\r\nand yadi. Every one of these animals he placed in separate enclosures.\r\nHe brought up their young ones and counted them as carefully as\r\nyoung lambs. As to the creatures called burkish, utrati (dromedaries?),\r\ntishani, and dagari, he wrote for them and they came. The\r\ndromedaries he kept in enclosures, where he brought up their young\r\nones. He entrusted each kind of animal to men of their own country to\r\ntend them. There were also curious animals of the Mediterranean Sea,\r\nwhich the King of Egypt sent as a gift and entrusted to the care of\r\nmen of their own land. The very choicest animals were there in\r\nabundance, and birds of heaven with beautiful wings. It was a\r\nsplendid menagerie, and all the work of his own hands. The names of\r\nthe animals were placed beside them.\"\r\n\r\n[Rome.]--The extravagant demands for the amphitheatre of ancient\r\nRome must have stimulated the capture of wild animals in Asia, Africa,\r\nand the then wild parts of Europe, to an extraordinary extent. I\r\nwill quote one instance from Gibbon:--\r\n\r\n\"By the order of Probus, a vast quantity of large trees torn up by\r\nthe roots were transplanted into the midst of the circus. The\r\nspacious and shady forest was immediately filled with a thousand\r\nostriches, a thousand stags, a thousand fallow-deer, and a thousand\r\nwild boars, and all this variety of game was abandoned to the\r\nriotous impetuosity of the multitude. The tragedy of the succeeding\r\nday consisted in the massacre of a hundred lions, an equal number of\r\nlionesses, two hundred leopards, and three hundred bears.\"\r\n\r\nFarther on we read of a spectacle by the younger Gordian of\r\n\"twenty zebras, ten elks, ten giraffes, thirty African hyenas, ten\r\nIndian tigers, a rhinoceros, an hippopotamus, and thirty-two\r\nelephants.\"\r\n\r\n[Mexico.]--Gomara, the friend and executor of Herman Cortes, states:\r\n--\r\n\r\n\"There were here also many cages made of stout beams, in some of\r\nwhich there were lions (pumas); in others, tigers (jaguars); in\r\nothers, ounces; in others, wolves; nor was there any animal on four\r\nlegs that was not there. They had for their rations deer and other\r\nanimals of the chase. There were also kept in large jars or tanks,\r\nsnakes, alligators, and lizards. In another court there were cages\r\ncontaining every kind of birds of prey, such as vultures, a dozen\r\nsorts of falcons and hawks, eagles, and owls. The large eagles\r\nreceived turkeys for their food. Our Spaniards were astonished at\r\nseeing such a diversity of birds and beasts; nor did they find it\r\npleasant to hear the hissing of the poisonous snakes, the roaring of\r\nthe lions, the shrill cries of the wolves, nor the groans of the\r\nother animals given to them for food.\"\r\n\r\n[Peru.]--Garcilasso de la Vega (_Commentaries Reales_, v. 10), the\r\nson of a Spanish conqueror by an Indian princess, born and bred in\r\nPeru, writes:--\r\n\r\n\"All the strange birds and beasts which the chiefs presented to the\r\nInca were kept at court, both for grandeur and also to please the\r\nIndians who presented them. When I came to Cuzco, I remember there\r\nwere some remains of places where they kept these creatures. One was\r\nthe serpent conservatory, and another where they kept the pumas,\r\njaguars, and bears.\"\r\n\r\n[Syria and Greece.]--I could have said something on Solomon's apes\r\nand peacocks, and could have quoted at length the magnificent order\r\ngiven by Alexander the Great (Pliny, _Nat. Hist._, viii. 16) towards\r\nsupplying material for Aristotle's studies in natural history; but\r\nenough has been said to prove what I maintained, namely, that\r\nnumerous cases occur, year after year, and age after age, in which\r\nevery animal of note is captured and its capabilities of\r\ndomestication unconsciously tested.\r\n\r\nI would accept in a more stringent sense than it was probably\r\nintended to bear, the text of St. James, who wrote at a time when a\r\nvast variety and multitude of animals were constantly being\r\nforwarded to Rome and to Antioch for amphitheatrical shows. He says\r\n(James iii. 7), \"Every kind of beasts, and of birds, and of serpents,\r\nand of things in the sea, is tamed, and hath been tamed of mankind.\"\r\n\r\nI conclude from what I have stated that there is no animal worthy of\r\ndomestication that has not frequently been captured, and might ages\r\nago have established itself as a domestic breed, had it not been\r\ndeficient in certain necessary particulars which I shall proceed to\r\ndiscuss. These are numerous and so stringent as to leave no ground\r\nfor wonder that out of the vast abundance of the animal creation,\r\nonly a few varieties of a few species should have become the\r\ncompanions of man.\r\n\r\nIt by no means follows that because a savage cares to take home a\r\nyoung fawn to amuse himself, his family, and his friends, that he\r\nwill always continue to feed or to look after it. Such attention\r\nwould require a steadiness of purpose foreign to the ordinary\r\ncharacter of a savage. But herein lie two shrewd tests of the\r\neventual destiny of the animal as a domestic species.\r\n\r\n_Hardiness_.--It must be able to shift for itself and to thrive,\r\nalthough it is neglected; since, if it wanted much care, it would\r\nnever be worth its keep.\r\n\r\nThe hardiness of our domestic animals is shown by the rapidity with\r\nwhich they establish themselves in new lands. The goats and hogs\r\nleft on islands by the earlier navigators throve excellently on the\r\nwhole. The horse has taken possession of the Pampas, and the sheep\r\nand ox of Australia. The dog is hardly repressible in the streets of\r\nan Oriental town.\r\n\r\n_Fondness of Man_.--Secondly, it must cling to man, notwithstanding\r\noccasional hard usage and frequent neglect. If the animal had no\r\nnatural attachment to our species, it would fret itself to death, or\r\nescape and revert to wildness. It is easy to find cases where the\r\npartial or total non-fulfilment of this condition is a corresponding\r\nobstacle to domestication. Some kinds of cattle are too precious to\r\nbe discarded, but very troublesome to look after. Such are the\r\nreindeer to the Lapps. Mr. Campbell of Islay informed me that the\r\ntamest of certain herds of them look as if they were wild; they have\r\nto be caught with a lasso to be milked. If they take fright, they\r\nare off to the hills; consequently the Lapps are forced to\r\naccommodate themselves to the habits of their beasts, and to follow\r\nthem from snow to sea and from sea to snow at different seasons. The\r\nNorth American reindeer has never been domesticated, owing, I presume,\r\nto this cause. The Peruvian herdsmen would have had great trouble to\r\nendure had the llama and alpaca not existed, for their cogeners, the\r\nhuanacu and the vicuna, are hardly to be domesticated.\r\n\r\nZebras, speaking broadly, are unmanageable. The Dutch Boers\r\nconstantly endeavour to break them to harness, and though they\r\noccasionally succeed to a degree, the wild mulish nature of the\r\nanimal is always breaking out, and liable to balk them.\r\n\r\nIt is certain that some animals have naturally a greater fondness\r\nfor man than others; and as a proof of this, I will again quote\r\nHearne about the moose, who are considered by him to be the easiest\r\nto tame and domesticate of any of the deer tribe. Formerly the\r\nclosely-allied European elks were domesticated in Sweden, and used\r\nto draw sledges, as they are now occasionally in Canada; but they\r\nhave been obsolete for many years. Hearne says:--\r\n\r\n\"The young ones are so simple that I remember to have seen an Indian\r\npaddle his canoe up to one of them, and take it by the poll, without\r\nexperiencing the least opposition, the poor harmless animal seeming\r\nat the same time as contented alongside the canoe as if swimming by\r\nthe side of its dam, and looking up in our faces with the same\r\nfearless innocence that a house lamb would.\"\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, a young bison will try to dash out its brains\r\nagainst the tree to which it is tied, in terror and hatred of its\r\ncaptors.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note the causes that conduce to a decided\r\nattachment of certain animals to man, or between one kind of animal\r\nand another. It is notorious that attachments and aversions exist in\r\nnature. Swallows, rooks, and storks frequent dwelling houses;\r\nostriches and zebras herd together; so do bisons and elks. On the\r\nother hand, deer and sheep, which are both gregarious, and both eat\r\nthe same food and graze within the same enclosure, avoid one another.\r\nThe spotted Danish dog, the Spitz dog, and the cat, have all a\r\nstrong attachment to horses, and horses seem pleased with their\r\ncompany; but dogs and cats are proverbially discordant. I presume\r\nthat two species of animals do not consider one another companionable,\r\nor clubable, unless their behaviour and their persons are\r\nreciprocally agreeable. A phlegmatic animal would be exceedingly\r\ndisquieted by the close companionship of an excitable one. The\r\nmovements of one beast may have a character that is unpleasing to\r\nthe eyes of another; his cries may sound discordant; his smell may\r\nbe repulsive. Two herds of animals would hardly intermingle, unless\r\ntheir respective languages of action and of voice were mutually\r\nintelligible. The animal which above all others is a companion to\r\nman is the dog, and we observe how readily their proceedings are\r\nintelligible to each other. Every whine or bark of the dog, each of\r\nhis fawning, savage, or timorous movements is the exact counterpart\r\nof what would have been the man's behaviour, had he felt similar\r\nemotions. As the man understands the thoughts of the dog, so the dog\r\nunderstands the thoughts of the man, by attending to his natural\r\nvoice, his countenance, and his actions. A man irritates a dog by an\r\nordinary laugh, he frightens him by an angry look, or he calms him\r\nby a kindly bearing; but he has less spontaneous hold over an ox or a\r\nsheep. He must study their ways and tutor his behaviour before he\r\ncan either understand the feelings of those animals or make his own\r\nintelligible to them. He has no natural power at all over many other\r\ncreatures. Who, for instance, ever succeeded in frowning away a\r\nmosquito, or in pacifying an angry wasp by a smile?\r\n\r\n_Desire of Comfort_.--This is a motive which strongly attaches\r\ncertain animals to human habitations, even though they are unwelcome:\r\nit is a motive which few persons who have not had an opportunity of\r\nstudying animals in savage lands are likely to estimate at its true\r\nvalue. The life of all beasts in their wild state is an exceedingly\r\nanxious one. From my own recollection, I believe that every antelope\r\nin South Africa has to run for its life every one or two days upon\r\nan average, and that he starts or gallops under the influence of a\r\nfalse alarm many times in a day. Those who have crouched at night by\r\nthe side of pools in the desert, in order to have a shot at the\r\nbeasts that frequent them, see strange scenes of animal life; how\r\nthe creatures gambol at one moment and fight at another; how a herd\r\nsuddenly halts in strained attention, and then breaks into a\r\nmaddened rush, as one of them becomes conscious of the stealthy\r\nmovements or rank scent of a beast of prey. Now this hourly\r\nlife-and-death excitement is a keen delight to most wild creatures,\r\nbut must be peculiarly distracting to the comfort-loving temperament\r\nof others. The latter are alone suited to endure the crass habits\r\nand dull routine of domesticated life. Suppose that an animal which\r\nhas been captured and half-tamed, received ill-usage from his captors,\r\neither as punishment or through mere brutality, and that he rushed\r\nindignantly into the forest with his ribs aching from blows and\r\nstones. If a comfort-loving animal, he will probably be no gainer by\r\nthe change, more serious alarms and no less ill-usage awaits him; he\r\nhears the roar of the wild beasts and the headlong gallop of the\r\nfrightened herds, and he finds the buttings and the kicks of other\r\nanimals harder to endure than the blows from which he fled. He has\r\nthe disadvantage of being a stranger, for the herds of his own\r\nspecies which he seeks for companionship constitute so many cliques,\r\ninto which he can only find admission by more fighting with their\r\nstrongest members than he has spirit to undergo. As a set-off\r\nagainst these miseries, the freedom of savage life has no charms for\r\nhis temperament; so the end of it is, that with a heavy heart he\r\nturns back to the habitation he had quitted. When animals thoroughly\r\nenjoy the excitement of wild life, I presume they cannot be\r\ndomesticated, they could only be tamed, for they would never return\r\nfrom the joys of the wilderness after they had once tasted them\r\nthrough some accidental wandering.\r\n\r\nGallinas, or guinea-fowl, have so little care for comfort, or indeed\r\nfor man, that they fall but a short way within the frontier of\r\ndomestication. It is only in inclement seasons that they take\r\ncontentedly to the poultry-yards.\r\n\r\nElephants, from their size and power, are not dependent on man for\r\nprotection; hence, those that have been reared as pets from the time\r\nthey were calves, and have never learned to dread and obey the\r\norders of a driver, are peculiarly apt to revert to wildness if they\r\nonce are allowed to wander and escape to the woods. I believe this\r\ntendency, together with the cost of maintenance and the comparative\r\nuselessness of the beasts, are among the chief causes why Africans\r\nnever tame them now; though they have not wholly lost the practice\r\nof capturing them when full-grown, and of keeping them imprisoned\r\nfor some days alive. Mr. Winwood Reade's account of captured\r\nelephants, seen by himself near Glass Town in Equatorial Western\r\nAfrica, is very curious.\r\n\r\n_Usefulness to Man_.--To proceed with the list of requirements\r\nwhich a captured animal must satisfy before it is possible he could\r\nbe permanently domesticated: there is the very obvious condition\r\nthat he should be useful to man; otherwise, in growing to maturity,\r\nand losing the pleasing youthful ways which had first attracted his\r\ncaptors and caused them to make a pet of him, he would be repelled.\r\nAs an instance in point, I will mention seals. Many years ago I used\r\nto visit Shetland, when those animals were still common, and I heard\r\nmany stories of their being tamed: one will suffice:--A fisherman\r\ncaught a young seal; it was very affectionate, and frequented his hut,\r\nfishing for itself in the sea. At length it grew self-willed and\r\nunwieldy; it used to push the children and snap at strangers, and it\r\nwas voted a nuisance, but the people could not bear to kill it on\r\naccount of its human ways. One day the fisherman took it with him in\r\nhis boat, and dropped it in a stormy sea, far from home; the\r\nstratagem was unsuccessful; in a day or two the well-known scuffling\r\nsound of the seal, as it floundered up to the hut, was again heard;\r\nthe animal had found its way home. Some days after the poor creature\r\nwas shot by a sporting stranger, who saw it basking and did not know\r\nit was tame. Now had the seal been a useful animal and not\r\ntroublesome, the fisherman would doubtless have caught others, and\r\nset a watch over them to protect them; and then, if they bred freely\r\nand were easy to tend, it is likely enough he would have produced a\r\ndomestic breed.\r\n\r\nThe utility of the animals as a store of future food is undoubtedly\r\nthe most durable reason for maintaining them; but I think it was\r\nprobably not so early a motive as the chief's pleasure in possessing\r\nthem. That was the feeling under which the menageries, described\r\nabove, were established. Whatever the despot of savage tribes is\r\npleased with becomes invested with a sort of sacredness. His tame\r\nanimals would be the care of all his people, who would become\r\nskilful herdsmen under the pressure of fear. It would be as much as\r\ntheir lives were worth if one of the creatures were injured through\r\ntheir neglect. I believe that the keeping of a herd of beasts, with\r\nthe sole motive of using them as a reserve for food, or as a means\r\nof barter, is a late idea in the history of civilisation. It has now\r\nbecome established among the pastoral races of South Africa, owing\r\nto the traffickings of the cattle-traders, but it was by no means\r\nprevalent in Damara-Land when I travelled there in 1852. I then was\r\nsurprised to observe the considerations that induced the chiefs to\r\ntake pleasure in their vast herds of cattle. They were valued for\r\ntheir stateliness and colour, far more than for their beef. They\r\nwere as the deer of an English squire, or as the stud of a man who\r\nhas many more horses than he can ride. An ox was almost a sacred\r\nbeast in Damara-Land, not to be killed except on momentous occasions,\r\nand then as a sort of sacrificial feast, in which all bystanders\r\nshared. The payment of two oxen was hush-money for the life of a man.\r\nI was considerably embarrassed by finding that I had the greatest\r\ntrouble in buying oxen for my own use, with the ordinary articles of\r\nbarter. The possessor would hardly part with them for any\r\nremuneration; they would never sell their handsomest beasts.\r\n\r\nOne of the ways in which the value of tamed beasts would be soon\r\nappreciated would be that of giving milk to children. It is\r\nmarvellous how soon goats find out children and tempt them to suckle.\r\nI have had the milk of my goats, when encamping for the night in\r\nAfrican travels, drained dry by small black children, who had not\r\nthe strength to do more than crawl about, but nevertheless came to\r\nsome secret understanding with the goats and fed themselves. The\r\nrecords of many nations have legends like that of Romulus and Remus,\r\nwho are stated to have been suckled by wild beasts. These are\r\nsurprisingly confirmed by General Sleeman's narrative of six cases\r\nwhere children were nurtured for many years by wolves in Oude.\r\n(_Journey through Oude in 1849-50_, i. 206.)\r\n\r\n_Breeding freely_.--Domestic animals must breed freely under\r\nconfinement. This necessity limits very narrowly the number of\r\nspecies which might otherwise have been domesticated. It is one of\r\nthe most important of all the conditions that have to be satisfied.\r\nThe North American turkey, reared from the eggs of the wild bird, is\r\nstated to be unknown in the third generation, in captivity. Our\r\nturkey comes from Mexico, and was abundantly domesticated by the\r\nancient Mexicans.\r\n\r\nThe Indians of the Upper Amazon took turtle and placed them in\r\nlagoons for use in seasons of scarcity. The Spaniards who first saw\r\nthem called these turtle \"Indian cattle.\" They would certainly have\r\nbecome domesticated like cattle, if they had been able to breed in\r\ncaptivity.\r\n\r\n_Easy to tend_.--They must be tended easily. When animals reared\r\nin the house are suffered to run about in the companionship of\r\nothers like themselves, they naturally revert to much of their\r\noriginal wildness. It is therefore essential to domestication that\r\nthey should possess some quality by which large numbers of them may\r\nbe controlled by a few herdsmen. The instinct of gregariousness is\r\nsuch a quality. The herdsman of a vast troop of oxen grazing in a\r\nforest, so long as he is able to see one of them, knows pretty\r\nsurely that they are all within reach. If oxen are frightened and\r\ngallop off, they do not scatter, but remain in a single body. When\r\nanimals are not gregarious, they are to the herdsman like a falling\r\nnecklace of beads whose string is broken, or as a handful of water\r\nescaping between the fingers.\r\n\r\nThe cat is the only non-gregarious domestic animal. It is retained\r\nby its extraordinary adhesion to the comforts of the house in which\r\nit is reared.\r\n\r\nAn animal may be perfectly fitted to be a domestic animal, and be\r\npeculiarly easy to tend in a general way, and yet the circumstances\r\nin which the savages are living may make it too troublesome for them\r\nto maintain a breed. The following account, taken from Mr. Scott\r\nNind's paper on the Natives of King George's Sound in Australia, and\r\nprinted in the first volume of the _Journal of the Geographical\r\nSociety_, is particularly to the point. He says:--\r\n\r\n\"In the chase the hunters are assisted by dogs, which they take when\r\nyoung and domesticate; but they take little pains to train them to\r\nany particular mode of hunting. After finding a litter of young, the\r\nnatives generally carry away one or two to rear; in this case, it\r\noften occurs that the mother will trace and attack them; and, being\r\nlarge and very strong, she is rather formidable. At some periods,\r\nfood is so scanty as to compel the dog to leave his master and\r\nprovide for himself; but in a few days he generally returns.\"\r\n\r\nI have also evidence that this custom is common to the wild natives\r\nof other parts of Australia.\r\n\r\nThe gregariousness of all our domestic species is, I think, the\r\nprimary reason why some of them are extinct in a wild state. The\r\nwild herds would intermingle with the tame ones, some would become\r\nabsorbed, the others would be killed by hunters, who used the tame\r\ncattle as a shelter to approach the wild. Besides this,\r\ncomfort-loving animals would be less suited to fight the battle of\r\nlife with the rest of the brute creation; and it is therefore to be\r\nexpected that those varieties which are best fitted for domestication,\r\nwould be the soonest extinguished in a wild state. For instance, we\r\ncould hardly fancy the camel to endure in a land where there were\r\nlarge wild beasts.\r\n\r\n_Selection_.--The irreclaimably wild members of every flock would\r\nescape and be utterly lost; the wilder of those that remained would\r\nassuredly be selected for slaughter, when ever it was necessary that\r\none of the flock should be killed. The tamest cattle--those that\r\nseldom ran away, that kept the flock together and led them\r\nhomewards--would be preserved alive longer than any of the others.\r\nIt is therefore these that chiefly become the parents of stock, and\r\nbequeath their domestic aptitudes to the future herd. I have\r\nconstantly witnessed this process of selection among the pastoral\r\nsavages of South Africa. I believe it to be a very important one, on\r\naccount of its rigour and its regularity. It must have existed from\r\nthe earliest times, and have been in continuous operation,\r\ngeneration after generation, down to the present day.\r\n\r\n_Exceptions_.--I have already mentioned the African elephant, the\r\nNorth American reindeer, and the apparent, but not real exception of\r\nthe North American turkey. I should add the ducks and geese of North\r\nAmerica, but I cannot consider them in the light of a very strong\r\ncase, for a savage who constantly changes his home is not likely to\r\ncarry aquatic birds along with him. Beyond these few, I know of no\r\nnotable exceptions to my theory.\r\n\r\n_Summary_.\r\n\r\nI see no reason to suppose that the first domestication of any animal,\r\nexcept the elephant, implies a high civilisation among the people\r\nwho established it. I cannot believe it to have been the result of a\r\npreconceived intention, followed by elaborate trials, to administer\r\nto the comfort of man. Neither can I think it arose from one\r\nsuccessful effort made by an individual, who might thereby justly\r\nclaim the title of benefactor to his race; but, on the contrary,\r\nthat a vast number of half-unconscious attempts have been made\r\nthroughout the course of ages, and that ultimately, by slow degrees,\r\nafter many relapses, and continued selection, our several domestic\r\nbreeds became firmly established.\r\n\r\nI will briefly restate what appear to be the conditions under which\r\nwild animals may become domesticated:--1, they should be hardy; 2,\r\nthey should have an inborn liking for man; 3, they should be\r\ncomfort-loving; 4, they should be found useful to the savages; 5,\r\nthey should breed freely; 6, they should be easy to tend. It would\r\nappear that every wild animal has had its chance of being\r\ndomesticated, that those few which fulfilled the above conditions\r\nwere domesticated long ago, but that the large remainder, who fail\r\nsometimes in only one small particular, are destined to perpetual\r\nwildness so long as their race continues. As civilisation extends\r\nthey are doomed to be gradually destroyed off the face of the earth\r\nas useless consumers of cultivated produce. I infer that slight\r\ndifferences in natural dispositions of human races may in one case\r\nlead irresistibly to some particular career, and in another case may\r\nmake that career an impossibility.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OBSERVED ORDER OF EVENTS.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing as yet observed in the order of events to make us\r\ndoubt that the universe is bound together in space and time, as a\r\nsingle entity, and there is a concurrence of many observed facts to\r\ninduce us to accept that view. We may, therefore, not unreasonably\r\nprofess faith in a common and mysterious whole, and of the laborious\r\nadvance, under many restrictions, of that infinitely small part of\r\nit which falls under our observation, but which is in itself\r\nenormously large, and behind which lies the awful mystery of the\r\norigin of all existence.\r\n\r\nThe conditions that direct the order of the whole of the living\r\nworld around us, are marked by their persistence in improving the\r\nbirthright of successive generations. They determine, at much cost\r\nof individual comfort, that each plant and animal shall, on the\r\ngeneral average, be endowed at its birth with more suitable natural\r\nfaculties than those of its representative in the preceding\r\ngeneration. They ensure, in short, that the inborn qualities of the\r\nterrestrial tenantry shall become steadily better adapted to their\r\nhomes and to their mutual needs. This effect, be it understood, is\r\nnot only favourable to the animals who live long enough to become\r\nparents, but is also favourable to those who perish in earlier life,\r\nbecause even they are on the whole better off during their brief\r\ncareer than if they had been born still less adapted to the\r\nconditions of their existence. If we summon before our imagination\r\nin a single mighty host, the whole number of living things from the\r\nearliest date at which terrestrial life can be deemed to have\r\nprobably existed, to the latest future at which we may think it can\r\nprobably continue, and if we cease to dwell on the miscarriages of\r\nindividual lives or of single generations, we shall plainly perceive\r\nthat the actual tenantry of the world progresses in a direction that\r\nmay in some sense be described as the greatest happiness of the\r\ngreatest number.\r\n\r\nWe also remark that while the motives by which individuals in the\r\nlowest stages are influenced are purely self regarding, they broaden\r\nas evolution goes on. The word \"self\" ceases to be wholly personal,\r\nand begins to include subjects of affection and interest, and these\r\nbecome increasingly numerous as intelligence and depth of character\r\ndevelop, and as civilisation extends. The sacrifice of the personal\r\ndesire for repose to the performance of domestic and social duties\r\nis an everyday event with us, and other sacrifices of the smaller to\r\nthe larger self are by no means uncommon. Life in general may be\r\nlooked upon as a republic where the individuals are for the most\r\npart unconscious that while they are working for themselves they are\r\nalso working for the public good.\r\n\r\nWe may freely confess ignorance of the outcome in the far future of\r\nthat personal life to which we each cling passionately in the joyous\r\nmorning of the affections, but which, as these and other interests\r\nfail, does not seem so eminently desirable in itself. We know that\r\norganic life can hardly be expected to flourish on this earth of\r\nours for so long a time as it has already existed, because the sun\r\nwill in all probability have lost too much of its heat and light by\r\nthen, and will have begun to grow dark and therefore cold, as other\r\nstars have done. The conditions of existence here, which are now\r\napparently in their prime, will have become rigorous and\r\nincreasingly so, and there will be retrogression towards lower types,\r\nuntil the simplest form of life shall have wholly disappeared from\r\nthe ice-bound surface. The whole living world will then have waxed\r\nand waned like an individual life.\r\n\r\nNeither can we discover whether organisms here are capable of\r\nattaining the average development of organisms in other of the\r\nplanets that are probably circling round most of the myriads of stars,\r\nwhose physical constitution, where-ever it has as yet been observed\r\nspectroscopically, does not differ much from that of our sun. But we\r\nperceive around us a countless number of abortive seeds and germs; we\r\nfind out of any group of a thousand men selected at random, some who\r\nare crippled, insane, idiotic, and otherwise born incurably\r\nimperfect in body or mind, and it is possible that this world may\r\nrank among other worlds as one of these.\r\n\r\nWe as yet understand nothing of the way in which our conscious\r\nselves are related to the separate lives of the billions of cells of\r\nwhich the body of each of us is composed. We only know that the\r\ncells form a vast nation, some members of which are always dying and\r\nothers growing to supply their places, and that the continual\r\nsequence of these multitudes of little lives has its outcome in the\r\nlarger and conscious life of the man as a whole. Our part in the\r\nuniverse may possibly in some distant way be analogous to that of\r\nthe cells in an organised body, and our personalities may be the\r\ntransient but essential elements of an immortal and cosmic mind.\r\n\r\nOur views of the object of life have to be framed so as not to be\r\ninconsistent with the observed facts from which these various\r\npossibilities are inferred; it is safer that they should not exclude\r\nthe possibilities themselves. We must look on the slow progress of\r\nthe order of evolution, and the system of routine by which it has\r\nthus far advanced, as due to antecedents and to inherent conditions\r\nof which we have not as yet the slightest conception. It is\r\ndifficult to withstand a suspicion that the three dimensions of\r\nspace and the fourth dimension of time may be four independent\r\nvariables of a system that is neither space nor time, but something\r\nelse wholly unconceived by us. Our present enigma as to how a First\r\nCause could itself have been brought into existence--how the\r\ntortoise of the fable, that bears the elephant that bears the world,\r\nis itself supported,--may be wholly due to our necessary\r\nmistranslation of the four or more variables of the universe,\r\nlimited by inherent conditions, into the three unlimited variables\r\nof Space and the one of Time.\r\n\r\nOur ignorance of the goal and purport of human life, and the\r\nmistrust we are apt to feel of the guidance of the spiritual sense,\r\non account of its proved readiness to accept illusions as realities,\r\nwarn us against deductive theories of conduct. Putting these, then,\r\nat least for the moment, to one side, we find ourselves face to face\r\nwith two great and indisputable facts that everywhere force\r\nthemselves on the attention and compel consideration. The one is\r\nthat the whole of the living world moves steadily and continuously\r\ntowards the evolution of races that are progressively more and more\r\nadapted to their complicated mutual needs and to their external\r\ncircumstances. The other is that the process of evolution has been\r\nhitherto apparently carried out with, what we should reckon in our\r\nways of carrying out projects, great waste of opportunity and of life,\r\nand with little if any consideration for individual mischance.\r\nMeasured by our criterion of intelligence and mercy, which consists\r\nin the achievement of result without waste of time or opportunity,\r\nwithout unnecessary pain, and with equitable allowance for pure\r\nmistake, the process of evolution on this earth, so far as we can\r\njudge, has been carried out neither with intelligence nor ruth, but\r\nentirely through the routine of various sequences, commonly called\r\n\"laws,\" established or necessitated we know not how.\r\n\r\nAn incalculable amount of lower life has been certainly passed\r\nthrough before that human organisation was attained, of which we and\r\nour generation are for the time the holders and transmitters. This\r\nis no mean heritage, and I think it should be considered as a sacred\r\ntrust, for, together with man, intelligence of a sufficiently high\r\norder to produce great results appears, so far as we can infer from\r\nthe varied records of the prehistoric past, to have first dawned upon\r\nthe tenantry of the earth. Man has already shown his large power in\r\nthe modifications he has made on the surface of the globe, and in\r\nthe distribution of plants and animals. He has cleared such vast\r\nregions of forest that his work that way in North America alone,\r\nduring the past half century, would be visable to an observer as far\r\noff as the moon. He has dug and drained; he has exterminated plants\r\nand animals that were mischievous to him; he has domesticated those\r\nthat serve his purpose, and transplanted them to great distances\r\nfrom their native places. Now that this new animal man, finds\r\nhimself somehow in existence, endowed with a little power and\r\nintelligence, he ought, I submit, to awake to a fuller knowledge of\r\nhis relatively great position, and begin to assume a deliberate part\r\nin furthering the great work of evolution. He may infer the course\r\nit is bound to pursue, from his observation of that which it has\r\nalready followed, and he might devote his modicum of power,\r\nintelligence, and kindly feeling to render its future progress less\r\nslow and painful. Man has already furthered evolution very\r\nconsiderably, half unconsciously, and for his own personal advantages,\r\nbut he has not yet risen to the conviction that it is his religious\r\nduty to do so deliberately and systematically.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSELECTION AND RACE.\r\n\r\nThe fact of an individual being naturally gifted with high qualities,\r\nmay be due either to his being an exceptionally good specimen of a\r\npoor race, or an average specimen of a high one. The difference of\r\norigin would betray itself in his descendants; they would revert\r\ntowards the typical centre of their race, deteriorating in the first\r\ncase but not in the second. The two cases, though theoretically\r\ndistinct, are confused in reality, owing to the frequency with which\r\nexceptional personal qualities connote the departure of the entire\r\nnature of the individual from his ancestral type, and the formation\r\nof a new strain having its own typical centre. It is hardly\r\nnecessary to add that it is in this indirect way that natural\r\nselection improves a race. The two events of selection and\r\ndifference of race ought, however, to be carefully distinguished in\r\nbroad practical considerations, while the frequency of their\r\nconcurrence is borne in mind and allowed for.\r\n\r\nSo long as the race remains radically the same, the stringent\r\nselection of the best specimens to rear and breed from, can never\r\nlead to any permanent result. The attempt to raise the standard of\r\nsuch a race is like the labour of Sisyphus in rolling his stone\r\nuphill; let the effort be relaxed for a moment, and the stone will\r\nroll back. Whenever a new typical centre appears, it is as though\r\nthere was a facet upon the lower surface of the stone, on which it\r\nis capable of resting without rolling back. It affords a temporary\r\nsticking-point in the forward progress of evolution. The causes that\r\ncheck the unlimited improvement of highly-bred animals, so long as\r\nthe race remains unchanged, are many and absolute.\r\n\r\nIn the first place there is an increasing delicacy of constitution;\r\nthe growing fineness of limb and structure end, after a few\r\ngenerations, in fragility. Overbred animals have little stamina;\r\nthey resemble in this respect the \"weedy\" colts so often reared from\r\nfirst-class racers. One can perhaps see in a general way why this\r\nshould be so. Each individual is the outcome of a vast number of\r\norganic elements of the most various species, just as some nation\r\nmight be the outcome of a vast number of castes of individuals, each\r\ncaste monopolising a special pursuit. Banish a number of the humbler\r\ncastes--the bakers, the bricklayers, and the smiths, and the nation\r\nwould soon come to grief. This is what is done in high breeding;\r\ncertain qualities are bred for, and the rest are diminished as far\r\nas possible, but they cannot be dispensed with entirely.\r\n\r\nThe next difficulty lies in the diminished fertility of highly-bred\r\nanimals. It is not improbable that its cause is of the same\r\ncharacter as that of the delicacy of their constitution. Together\r\nwith infertility is combined some degree of sexual indifference, or\r\nwhen passion is shown, it is not unfrequently for some specimen of a\r\ncoarser type. This is certainly the case with horses and with dogs.\r\n\r\nIt will be easily understood that these difficulties, which are so\r\nformidable in the case of plants and animals, which we can mate as\r\nwe please and destroy when we please, would make the maintenance of\r\na highly-selected breed of men an impossibility.\r\n\r\nWhenever a low race is preserved under conditions of life that exact\r\na high level of efficiency, it must be subjected to rigorous\r\nselection. The few best specimens of that race can alone be allowed\r\nto become parents, and not many of their descendants can be allowed\r\nto live. On the other hand, if a higher race be substituted for the\r\nlow one, all this terrible misery disappears. The most merciful form\r\nof what I ventured to call \"eugenics\" would consist in watching for\r\nthe indications of superior strains or races, and in so favouring\r\nthem that their progeny shall outnumber and gradually replace that\r\nof the old one. Such strains are of no infrequent occurrence. It is\r\neasy to specify families who are characterised by strong resemblances,\r\nand whose features and character are usually prepotent over those of\r\ntheir wives or husbands in their joint offspring, and who are at the\r\nsame time as prolific as the average of their class. These strains\r\ncan be conveniently studied in the families of exiles, which, for\r\nobvious reasons, are easy to trace in their various branches.\r\n\r\nThe debt that most countries owe to the race of men whom they\r\nreceived from one another as immigrants, whether leaving their\r\nnative country of their own free will, or as exiles on political or\r\nreligious grounds, has been often pointed out, and may, I think, be\r\naccounted for as follows:--The fact of a man leaving his compatriots,\r\nor so irritating them that they compel him to go, is fair evidence\r\nthat either he or they, or both, feel that his character is alien to\r\ntheirs. Exiles are also on the whole men of considerable force of\r\ncharacter; a quiet man would endure and succumb, he would not have\r\nenergy to transplant himself or to become so conspicuous as to be an\r\nobject of general attack. We may justly infer from this, that exiles\r\nare on the whole men of exceptional and energetic natures, and it is\r\nespecially from such men as these that new strains of race are likely\r\nto proceed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINFLUENCE OF MAN UPON RACE.\r\n\r\nThe influence of man upon the nature of his own race has already\r\nbeen very large, but it has not been intelligently directed, and has\r\nin many instances done great harm. Its action has been by invasions\r\nand migration of races, by war and massacre, by wholesale\r\ndeportation of population, by emigration, and by many social customs\r\nwhich have a silent but widespread effect.\r\n\r\nThere exists a sentiment, for the most part quite unreasonable,\r\nagainst the gradual extinction of an inferior race. It rests on some\r\nconfusion between the race and the individual, as if the destruction\r\nof a race was equivalent to the destruction of a large number of men.\r\nIt is nothing of the kind when the process of extinction works\r\nsilently and slowly through the earlier marriage of members of the\r\nsuperior race, through their greater vitality under equal stress,\r\nthrough their better chances of getting a livelihood, or through\r\ntheir prepotency in mixed marriages. That the members of an inferior\r\nclass should dislike being elbowed out of the way is another matter;\r\nbut it may be somewhat brutally argued that whenever two individuals\r\nstruggle for a single place, one must yield, and that there will be\r\nno more unhappiness on the whole, if the inferior yield to the\r\nsuperior than conversely, whereas the world will be permanently\r\nenriched by the success of the superior. The conditions of happiness\r\nare, however, too complex to be disposed of by _à priori_ argument;\r\nit is safest to appeal to observation. I think it could be easily\r\nshown that when the differences between the races is not so great as\r\nto divide them into obviously different classes, and where their\r\nlanguage, education, and general interests are the same, the\r\nsubstitution may take place gradually without any unhappiness. Thus\r\nthe movements of commerce have introduced fresh and vigorous blood\r\ninto various parts of England: the new-comers have intermarried with\r\nthe residents, and their characteristics have been prepotent in the\r\ndescendants of the mixed marriages. I have referred in the earlier\r\npart of the book to the changes of type in the English nature that\r\nhave occurred during the last few hundred years. These have been\r\neffected so silently that we only know of them by the results.\r\n\r\nOne of the most misleading of words is that of \"aborigines.\" Its use\r\ndates from the time when the cosmogony was thought to be young and\r\nlife to be of very recent appearance. Its usual meaning seems to be\r\nderived from the supposition that nations disseminated themselves\r\nlike colonists from a common centre about four thousand years, say\r\n120 generations ago, and thenceforward occupied their lands\r\nundisturbed until the very recent historic period with which the\r\nnarrator deals, when some invading host drove out the \"aborigines.\"\r\nThis idyllic view of the march of events is contradicted by ancient\r\nsepulchral remains, by language, and by the habits of those modern\r\nbarbarians whose history we know. There are probably hardly any\r\nspots on the earth that have not, within the last few thousand years,\r\nbeen tenanted by very different races; none hardly that have not\r\nbeen tenanted by very different tribes having the character of at\r\nleast sub-races.\r\n\r\nThe absence of a criterion to distinguish between races and sub-races,\r\nand our ethnological ignorance generally, makes it impossible to\r\noffer more than a very off-hand estimate of the average variety of\r\nraces in the different countries of the world. I have, however,\r\nendeavoured to form one, which I give with much hesitation, knowing\r\nhow very little it is worth. I registered the usually recognised\r\nraces inhabiting each of upwards of twenty countries, and who at the\r\nsame time formed at least half per cent of the population. It was, I\r\nam perfectly aware, a very rough proceeding, so rough that for the\r\nUnited Kingdom I ignored the prehistoric types and accepted only the\r\nthree headings of British, Low Dutch, and Norman-French. Again, as\r\nregards India I registered as follows:--Forest tribes (numerous),\r\nDravidian (three principal divisions), Early Arian, Tartar (numerous,\r\nincluding Afghans), Arab, and lastly European, on account of their\r\npolitical importance, notwithstanding the fewness of their numbers.\r\nProceeding in this off-hand way, and after considering the results,\r\nthe broad conclusion to which I arrived was that on the average at\r\nleast three different recognised races were to be found in every\r\nmoderately-sized district on the earth's surface. The materials were\r\nfar too scanty to enable any idea to be formed of the rate of change\r\nin the relative numbers of the constituent races in each country,\r\nand still less to estimate the secular changes of type in those races.\r\n\r\nIt may be well to take one or two examples of intermixture. Spain\r\nwas occupied in the earliest historic times by at least two races,\r\nof whom we know very little; it was afterwards colonised here and\r\nthere by Phoenicians in its southern ports, and by Greeks in its\r\neastern. In the third century B.C. it was invaded by the\r\nCarthaginians, who conquered and held a large part of it, but were\r\nafterwards supplanted by the Romans, who ruled it more or less\r\ncompletely for 700 years. It was invaded in the fifth century A.D.\r\nby a succession of German tribes, and was finally completely overrun\r\nby the Visigoths, who ruled it for more than 200 years. Then came\r\nthe invasion of the Moors, who rapidly conquered the whole of the\r\nPeninsula up to the mountains of Asturias, where the Goths still held\r\ntheir own, and whence they issued from time to time and ultimately\r\nrecovered the country. The present population consists of the\r\nremnants of one or more tribes of ancient Iberians, of the still\r\nmore ancient Basques, and of relics of all the invaders who have\r\njust been named. There is, besides, a notable proportion of Gypsies\r\nand not a few Jews.\r\n\r\nThis is obviously a most heterogeneous mixture, but to fully\r\nappreciate the diversity of its origin the several elements should\r\nbe traced farther back towards their sources. Thus, the Moors are\r\nprincipally descendants of Arabs, who flooded the northern provinces\r\nof Africa in successive waves of emigration eastwards, both before\r\nand after the Hegira, partly combining with the Berbers as they went,\r\nand partly displacing them from the littoral districts and driving\r\nthem to the oases of the Sahara, whence they in their turn displaced\r\nthe Negro population, whom they drove down to the Soudan. The Gypsies,\r\naccording to Sir Henry Rawlinson,[16] came from the Indo-Scythic\r\ntribes who inhabited the mouths of the Indus, and began to migrate\r\nnorthward, from the fourth century onward. They settled in the\r\nChaldean marshes, assumed independence and defied the caliph. In A.D.\r\n831 the grandson of Haroun al-Raschid sent a large expedition\r\nagainst them, which, after slaughtering ten thousand, deported the\r\nwhole of the remainder first to Baghdad and thence onwards to Persia.\r\nThey continued unmanageable in their new home, and were finally\r\ntransplanted to the Cilician frontier in Asia Minor, and established\r\nthere as a military colony to guard the passes of the Taurus. In A.D.\r\n962 the Greeks, having obtained some temporary successes, drove the\r\nGypsies back more into the interior, whence they gradually moved\r\ntowards the Hellespont under the pressure of the advancing Seljukians,\r\nduring the twelfth and thirteenth centuries. They then crossed over\r\nto Europe and gradually overspread it, where they are now estimated\r\nto number more than three millions.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: _Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society_, vol.\r\ni. This account of the routes of the Gypsies is by no means\r\nuniversally accepted, nor, indeed, was offered as a complete\r\nsolution of the problem of their migration, but it will serve to\r\nshow how complex that problem is.]\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that emigration on a large scale implies\r\neven a moderate degree of civilisation among those who emigrate,\r\nbecause the process has been frequently traced among the more\r\nbarbarous tribes, to say nothing of the evidence largely derived\r\nfrom ancient burial-places. My own impression of the races in South\r\nAfrica was one of a continual state of ferment and change, of the\r\nrapid development of some clan here and of the complete or almost\r\ncomplete suppression of another clan there. The well-known history\r\nof the rise of the Zulus and the destruction of their neighbours is\r\na case in point. In the country with which I myself was familiar the\r\nchanges had been numerous and rapid in the preceding few years, and\r\nthere were undoubted signs of much more important substitutions of\r\nrace in bygone times. The facts were briefly these: Damara Land was\r\ninhabited by pastoral tribes of the brown Bantu race who were in\r\ncontinual war with various alternations of fortune, and the several\r\ntribes had special characteristics that were readily appreciated by\r\nthemselves. On the tops of the escarped hills lived a fugitive black\r\npeople speaking a vile dialect of Hottentot, and families of yellow\r\nBushmen were found in the lowlands wherever the country was unsuited\r\nfor the pastoral Damaras. Lastly, the steadily encroaching Namaquas,\r\na superior Hottentot race, lived on the edge of the district. They\r\nhad very much more civilisation than the Bushmen, and more than the\r\nDamaras, and they contained a large infusion of Dutch blood.\r\n\r\nThe interpretation of all this was obviously that the land had been\r\ntenanted a long time ago by Negroes, that an invasion of Bushmen\r\ndrove the Negroes to the hills, and that the supremacy of these\r\nlasted so long that the Negroes lost their own language and acquired\r\nthat of the Bushmen. Then an invasion of a tribe of Bantu race\r\nsupplanted the Bushmen, and the Bantus, after endless struggles among\r\nthemselves, were being pushed aside at the time I visited them by\r\nthe incoming Namaquas, who themselves are a mixed race. This is\r\nmerely a sample of Africa; everywhere there are evidences of\r\nchanging races.\r\n\r\nThe last 300 or 400 years, say the last ten generations of mankind,\r\nhave witnessed changes of population on the largest scale, by the\r\nextension of races long resident in Europe to the temperate regions\r\nof Asia, Africa, America, and Australasia.\r\n\r\nSiberia was barely known to the Russians of nine generations ago,\r\nbut since that time it has been continuously overspread by their\r\ncolonists, soldiers, political exiles, and transported criminals;\r\nalready some two-thirds of its population are Sclaves.\r\n\r\nIn South Africa the settlement at the Cape of Good Hope is barely\r\nsix generations old, yet during that time a curious and continuous\r\nseries of changes has taken place, resulting in the substitution of\r\nan alien population for the Hottentots in the south and the Bantus\r\nin the north. One-third of it is white, consisting of Dutch, English,\r\ndescendants of French Huguenot refugees, some Germans and Portuguese,\r\nand the remainder is a strange medley of Hottentot, Bantu, Malay,\r\nand Negro elements. In North Africa Egypt has become infiltrated\r\nwith Greeks, Italians, Frenchmen, and Englishmen during the last two\r\ngenerations, and Algeria with Frenchmen.\r\n\r\nIn North America the change has been most striking, from a sparse\r\nIndian population of hunters into that of the present inhabitants of\r\nthe United States and Canada; the former of these, with its total of\r\nfifty millions inhabitants, already contains more than forty-three\r\nmillions of whites, chiefly of English origin; that is more of\r\nEuropean blood than is to be found in any one of the five great\r\nEuropean kingdoms of England, France, Italy, Germany, and Austria,\r\nand less than that of Russia alone. The remainder are chiefly black,\r\nthe descendants of slaves imported from Africa. In the Dominion of\r\nCanada, with its much smaller population of four millions, there has\r\nbeen a less, but still a complete, swamping of the previous Indian\r\nelement by incoming whites.\r\n\r\nIn South America, and thence upwards to Mexico inclusive, the\r\npopulation has been infiltrated in some parts and transformed in\r\nothers, by Spanish blood and by that of the Negroes whom they\r\nintroduced, so that not one half of its population can be reckoned\r\nas of pure Indian descent. The West Indian Islands have had their\r\npopulation absolutely swept away since the time of the Spanish\r\nConquest, except in a few rare instances, and African Negroes have\r\nbeen substituted for them.\r\n\r\nAustralia and New Zealand tell much the same tale as Canada. A\r\nnative population has been almost extinguished in the former and is\r\nswamped in the latter, under the pressure of an immigrant population\r\nof Europeans, which is now twelve times as numerous as the Maories.\r\nThe time during which this great change has been effected is less\r\nthan that covered by three generations.\r\n\r\nTo this brief sketch of changes of population in very recent periods,\r\nI might add the wave of Arab admixture that has extended from Egypt\r\nand the northern provinces of Africa into the Soudan, and that of\r\nthe yellow races of China, who have already made their industrial\r\nand social influence felt in many distant regions, and who bid fair\r\nhereafter, when certain of their peculiar religious fancies shall\r\nhave fallen into decay, to become one of the most effective of the\r\ncolonising nations, and who may, as I trust, extrude hereafter the\r\ncoarse and lazy Negro from at least the metaliferous regions of\r\ntropical Africa.\r\n\r\nIt is clear from what has been said, that men of former generations\r\nhave exercised enormous influence over the human stock of the\r\npresent day, and that the average humanity of the world now and in\r\nfuture years is and will be very different to what it would have\r\nbeen if the action of our forefathers had been different. The power\r\nin man of varying the future human stock vests a great responsibility\r\nin the hands of each fresh generation, which has not yet been\r\nrecognised at its just importance, nor deliberately employed. It is\r\nfoolish to fold the hands and to say that nothing can be done,\r\ninasmuch as social forces and self-interests are too strong to be\r\nresisted. They need not be resisted; they can be guided. It is one\r\nthing to check the course of a huge steam vessel by the shock of a\r\nsudden encounter when she is going at full speed in the wrong\r\ndirection, and another to cause her to change her course slowly and\r\ngently by a slight turn of the helm.\r\n\r\nNay, a ship may be made to describe a half circle, and to end by\r\nfollowing a course exactly opposite to the first, without attracting\r\nthe notice of the passengers.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPOPULATION.\r\n\r\nOver-population and its attendant miseries may not improbably become\r\na more serious subject of consideration than it ever yet has been,\r\nowing to improved sanatation and consequent diminution of the\r\nmortality of children, and to the filling up of the spare places of\r\nthe earth which are still void and able to receive the overflow of\r\nEurope. There are no doubt conflicting possibilities which I need\r\nnot stop to discuss.\r\n\r\nThe check to over-population mainly advocated by Malthus is a\r\nprudential delay in the time of marriage; but the practice of such a\r\ndoctrine would assuredly be limited, and if limited it would be most\r\nprejudicial to the race, as I have pointed out in _Hereditary Genius_,\r\nbut may be permitted to do so again. The doctrine would only be\r\nfollowed by the prudent and self-denying; it would be neglected by\r\nthe impulsive and self-seeking. Those whose race we especially want\r\nto have, would leave few descendants, while those whose race we\r\nespecially want to be quit of, would crowd the vacant space with\r\ntheir progeny, and the strain of population would thenceforward be\r\njust as pressing as before. There would have been a little relief\r\nduring one or two generations, but no permanent increase of the\r\ngeneral happiness, while the race of the nation would have\r\ndeteriorated. The practical application of the doctrine of deferred\r\nmarriage would therefore lead indirectly to most mischievous results,\r\nthat were overlooked owing to the neglect of considerations bearing\r\non race. While criticising the main conclusion to which Malthus came,\r\nI must take the opportunity of paying my humble tribute of admiration\r\nto his great and original work, which seems to me like the rise of\r\na morning star before a day of free social investigation. There is\r\nnothing whatever in his book that would be in the least offensive to\r\nthis generation, but he wrote in advance of his time and consequently\r\nroused virulent attacks, notably from his fellow-clergymen, whose\r\ndoctrinaire notions upon the paternal dispensation of the world were\r\nrudely shocked.\r\n\r\nThe misery check, as Malthus called all those influences that are\r\nnot prudential, is an ugly phrase not fully justified. It no doubt\r\nincludes death through inadequate food and shelter, through\r\npestilence from overcrowding, through war, and the like; but it also\r\nincludes many causes that do not deserve so hard a name. Population\r\ndecays under conditions that cannot be charged to the presence or\r\nabsence of misery, in the common sense of the word. These exist when\r\nnative races disappear before the presence of the incoming white man,\r\nwhen after making the fullest allowances for imported disease, for\r\nbrandy drinking, and other assignable causes, there is always a\r\nlarge residuum of effect not clearly accounted for. It is certainly\r\nnot wholly due to misery, but rather to listlessness, due to\r\ndiscouragement, and acting adversely in many ways.\r\n\r\nOne notable result of dulness and apathy is to make a person\r\nunattractive to the opposite sex and to be unattracted by them. It\r\nis antagonistic to sexual affection, and the result is a diminution\r\nof offspring. There exists strong evidence that the decay of\r\npopulation in some parts of South America under the irksome tyranny\r\nof the Jesuits, which crushed what little vivacity the people\r\npossessed, was due to this very cause. One cannot fairly apply the\r\nterm \"misery\" to apathy; I should rather say that strong affections\r\nrestrained from marriage by prudential considerations more truly\r\ndeserved that name.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEARLY AND LATE MARRIAGES\r\n\r\nIt is important to obtain a just idea of the relative effects of\r\nearly and late marriages. I attempted this in _Hereditary Genius_,\r\nbut I think the following is a better estimate. We are unhappily\r\nstill deficient in collected data as regards the fertility of the\r\nupper and middle classes at different ages; but the facts collected\r\nby Dr. Matthews Duncan as regards the lower orders will serve our\r\npurpose approximately, by furnishing the required _ratios_, though\r\nnot the absolute values. The following are his results,[17] from\r\nreturns kept at the Lying-in Hospital of St. Georges-in-the-East:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  Age of Mother\r\n at her Marriage.   Average Fertility.\r\n      15-19              9.12\r\n      20-24              7.92\r\n      25-29              6.30\r\n      30-34              4.60\r\n\r\n\r\nThe meaning of this Table will be more clearly grasped after a\r\nlittle modification of its contents. We may consider the fertility\r\nof each group to refer to the medium age of that group, as by writing\r\n17 instead of 15-19, and we may slightly smooth the figures, then\r\nwe have--\r\n\r\n\r\nAge of Mother at her         Approximate average\r\n    Marriage.                      Fertility.\r\n       17                       9.00 = 6 × 1.5\r\n       22                       7.50 = 5 × 1.5\r\n       27                       6.00 = 4 × 1.5\r\n       32                       4.50 = 3 × 1.5\r\n\r\n\r\nWhich shows that the relative fertility of mothers married at the\r\nages of 17, 22, 27, and 32 respectively is as 6, 5, 4, and 3\r\napproximately.\r\n\r\nThe increase in population by a habit of early marriages is further\r\naugmented by the greater rapidity with which the generations follow\r\neach other. By the joint effect of these two causes, a large effect\r\nis in time produced.\r\n\r\nLet us compute a single example. Taking a group of 100 mothers\r\nmarried at the age of 20, whom we will designate as A, and another\r\ngroup of 100 mothers married at the age of 29, whom we will call B,\r\nwe shall find by interpolation that the fertility of A and B\r\nrespectively would be about 8.2 and 5.4. We need not, however,\r\nregard their absolute fertility, which would differ in different\r\nclasses of society, but will only consider their relative production\r\nof such female children as may live and become mothers, and we will\r\nsuppose the number of such descendants in the first generation to be\r\nthe same as that of the A and B mothers together[17]--namely, 200.\r\nThen the number of such children in the A and B classes respectively,\r\nbeing in the proportion of 8.2 to 5.4, will be 115 and 85.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: _Fecundity, Fertility, Sterility_, etc.,\r\nby Dr. Matthews Duncan. A. & C. Black: Edinburgh, 1871, p. 143.]\r\n\r\nWe have next to determine the average lengths of the A and B\r\ngenerations, which may be roughly done by basing it on the usual\r\nestimate of an average generation, irrespectively of sex, at a third\r\nof a century, or say of an average female generation at 31.5 years.\r\nWe will further take 20 years as being 4.5 years earlier than the\r\naverage time of marriage, and 29 years as 4.5 years later than it,\r\nso that the length of each generation of the A group will be 27 years,\r\nand that of the B group will be 36 years. All these suppositions\r\nappear to be perfectly fair and reasonable, while it may easily be\r\nshown that any other suppositions within the bounds of probability\r\nwould lead to results of the same general order.\r\n\r\nThe least common multiple of 27 and 36 is 108, at the end of which\r\nterm of years A will have been multiplied four times over by the\r\nfactor 1.5, and B three times over by the factor 0.85. The results\r\nare given in the following Table:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n            Number of Female Descendants who themselves\r\n                            become Mothers.\r\n======================================================================\r\nAfter Number |            A             |          B                 |\r\nof Years     | Of 100 Mothers whose     | Of 100 Mothers whose       |\r\nas below.    | Marriages and those of   | Marriages and those of     |\r\n             | their Daughters all take | their Daughters take       |\r\n             | place at the Age of      | place at the Age of        |\r\n             | 20 Years.                | 29 Years.                  |\r\n             |          ---             |        ----                |\r\n             | (Ratio of Increase in    | (Ratio of Decrease in      |\r\n             |  each successive         | each successive Generation |\r\n             |  Generation being 1.15.) | being 0.85.)               |\r\n-------------+--------------------------+----------------------------|\r\n    108      |            175           |            61              |\r\n    216      |            299           |            38              |\r\n    324      |            535           |            23              |\r\n======================================================================\r\n\r\n\r\nThe general result is that the group B gradually disappears, and the\r\ngroup A more than supplants it. Hence if the races best fitted to\r\noccupy the land are encouraged to marry early, they will breed down\r\nthe others in a very few generations.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMARKS FOR FAMILY MERIT\r\n\r\nIt may seem very reasonable to ask how the result proposed in the\r\nlast paragraph is to be attained, and to add that the difficulty of\r\ncarrying so laudable a proposal into effect lies wholly in the\r\ndetails, and therefore that until some working plan is suggested,\r\nthe consideration of improving the human race is Utopian. But this\r\nrequirement is not altogether fair, because if a persuasion of the\r\nimportance of any end takes possession of men's minds, sooner or\r\nlater means are found by which that end is carried into effect. Some\r\nof the objections offered at first will be discovered to be\r\nsentimental, and of no real importance--the sentiment will change\r\nand they will disappear; others that are genuine are not met, but\r\nare in some way turned or eluded; and lastly, through the ingenuity\r\nof many minds directed for a long time towards the achievement of a\r\ncommon purpose, many happy ideas are sure to be hit upon that would\r\nnot have occurred to a single individual.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis being premised, it will suffice to faintly sketch out some sort\r\nof basis for eugenics, it being now an understanding that we are\r\nprovisionally agreed, for the sake of argument, that the improvement\r\nof race is an object of first-class importance, and that the popular\r\nfeeling has been educated to regard it in that light.\r\n\r\nThe final object would be to devise means for favouring individuals\r\nwho bore the signs of membership of a superior race, the proximate\r\naim would be to ascertain what those signs were, and these we will\r\nconsider first.\r\n\r\nThe indications of superior breed are partly personal, partly\r\nancestral. We need not trouble ourselves about the personal part,\r\nbecause full weight is already given to it in the competitive careers;\r\nenergy, brain, morale, and health being recognised factors of success,\r\nwhile there can hardly be a better evidence of a person being\r\nadapted to his circumstances than that afforded by success. It is\r\nthe ancestral part that is neglected, and which we have yet to\r\nrecognise at its just value. A question that now continually arises\r\nis this: a youth is a candidate for permanent employment, his\r\npresent personal qualifications are known, but how will he turn out\r\nin later years? The objections to competitive examinations are\r\nnotorious, in that they give undue prominence to youths whose\r\nreceptive faculties are quick, and whose intellects are precocious.\r\nThey give no indication of the directions in which the health,\r\ncharacter, and intellect of the youth will change through the\r\ndevelopment, in their due course, of ancestral tendencies that are\r\nlatent in youth, but will manifest themselves in after life.\r\nExaminations deal with the present, not with the future, although it\r\nis in the future of the youth that we are especially interested.\r\nMuch of the needed guidance may be derived from his family history.\r\nI cannot doubt, if two youths were of equal personal merit, of whom\r\none belonged to a thriving and long-lived family, and the other to a\r\ndecaying and short-lived family, that there could be any hesitation\r\nin saying that the chances were greater of the first-mentioned youth\r\nbecoming the more valuable public servant of the two.\r\n\r\nA thriving family may be sufficiently defined or inferred by the\r\nsuccessive occupations of its several male members in the previous\r\ngeneration, and of the two grandfathers. These are patent facts\r\nattainable by almost every youth, which admit of being verified in\r\nhis neighbourhood and attested in a satisfactory manner.\r\n\r\nA healthy and long-lived family may be defined by the patent facts\r\nof ages at death, and number and ages of living relatives, within\r\nthe degrees mentioned above, all of which can be verified and\r\nattested. A knowledge of the existence of longevity in the family\r\nwould testify to the stamina of the candidate, and be an important\r\naddition to the knowledge of his present health in forecasting the\r\nprobability of his performing a large measure of experienced work.\r\n\r\nOwing to absence of data and the want of inquiry of the family\r\nantecedents of those who fail and of those who succeed in life, we\r\nare much more ignorant than we ought to be of their relative\r\nimportance. In connection with this, I may mention some curious\r\nresults published by Mr. F.M. Holland[18] of Boston, U.S., as to the\r\nantecedent family history of persons who were reputed to be more\r\nmoral than the average, and of those who were the reverse. He has\r\n\r\nbeen good enough to reply to questions that I sent to him concerning\r\nhis criterion of morality, and other points connected with the\r\nstatistics, in a way that seems satisfactory, and he has very\r\nobligingly furnished me with additional MS. materials. One of his\r\nconclusions was that morality is more often found among members of\r\nlarge families than among those of small ones. It is reasonable to\r\nexpect this would be the case owing to the internal discipline among\r\nmembers of large families, and to the wholesome sustaining and\r\nrestraining effects of family pride and family criticism. Members of\r\nsmall families are apt to be selfish, and when the smallness of the\r\nfamily is due to the deaths of many of its members at early ages, it\r\nis some evidence either of weakness of the family constitution, or of\r\ndeficiency of common sense or of affection on the part of the\r\nparents in not taking better care of them. Mr. Holland quotes in his\r\nletter to me a piece of advice by Franklin to a young man in search\r\nof a wife, \"to take one out of a bunch of sisters,\" and a popular\r\nsaying that kittens brought up with others make the best pets,\r\nbecause they have learned to play without scratching. Sir William\r\nGull[19] has remarked that those candidates for the Indian Civil\r\nService who are members of large families are on the whole the\r\nstrongest.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: _Index Newspaper_, Boston, U.S. July 27, 1882.]\r\n\r\nFar be it from me to say that any scheme of marks for family merit\r\nwould not require a great deal of preparatory consideration. Careful\r\nstatistical inquiries have yet to be made into the family\r\nantecedents of public servants of mature age in connection with\r\ntheir place in examination lists at the earlier age when they first\r\ngained their appointments. This would be necessary in order to learn\r\nthe amount of marks that should be assigned to various degrees of\r\nfamily merit. I foresee no peculiar difficulty in conducting such an\r\ninquiry; indeed, now that competitive examinations have been in\r\ngeneral use for many years, the time seems ripe for it, but of\r\ncourse its conduct would require much confidential inquiry and a\r\ngreat deal of trouble in verifying returns. Still, it admits of\r\nbeing done, and if the results, derived from different sources,\r\nshould confirm one another, they could be depended on.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 19: _Blue Book C_--1446, 1876. On the Selection and\r\nTraining of Candidates for the Indian Civil Service.]\r\n\r\nLet us now suppose that a way was seen for carrying some such idea\r\nas this into practice, and that family merit, however defined, was\r\nallowed to count, for however little, in competitive examinations.\r\nThe effect would be very great: it would show that ancestral\r\nqualities are of present current value; it would give an impetus to\r\ncollecting family histories; it would open the eyes of every family\r\nand or society at large to the importance of marriage alliance with\r\na good stock; it would introduce the subject of race into a\r\npermanent topic of consideration, which (on the supposition of its\r\n_bonâ fide_ importance that has been assumed for the sake of\r\nargument) experience would show to be amply justified. Any act that\r\nfirst gives a guinea stamp to the sterling guinea's worth of natural\r\nnobility might set a great social avalanche in motion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nENDOWMENTS.\r\n\r\nEndowments and bequests have been freely and largely made for\r\nvarious social purposes, and as a matter of history they have\r\nfrequently been made to portion girls in marriage. It so happens\r\nthat the very day that I am writing this, I notice an account in the\r\nforeign newspapers (September 19, 1882) of an Italian who has\r\nbequeathed a sum to the corporation of London to found small\r\nportions for three poor girls to be selected by lot. And again, a\r\nfew weeks ago I read also in the French papers of a trial, in\r\nreference to the money adjudged to the \"Rosière\" of a certain village.\r\nMany cases in which individuals and states have portioned girls may\r\nbe found in Malthus. It is therefore far from improbable that if the\r\nmerits of good race became widely recognised and its indications\r\nwere rendered more surely intelligible than they now are, that local\r\nendowments, and perhaps adoptions, might be made in favour of those\r\nof both sexes who showed evidences of high race and of belonging to\r\nprolific and thriving families. One cannot forecast their form,\r\nthough we may reckon with some assurance that in one way or another\r\nthey would be made, and that the better races would be given a\r\nbetter chance of marrying early.\r\n\r\nA curious relic of the custom which was universal three or four\r\ncenturies ago, of entrusting education to celibate priests, forbade\r\nFellows of Colleges to marry, under the penalty of losing their\r\nfellowships. It is as though the winning horses at races were\r\nrendered ineligible to become sires, which I need hardly say is the\r\nexact reverse of the practice. Races were established and endowed by\r\n\"Queen's plates\" and otherwise at vast expense, for the purpose of\r\ndiscovering the swiftest horses, who are thenceforward exempted from\r\nlabour and reserved for the sole purpose of propagating their species.\r\nThe horses who do not win races, or who are not otherwise specially\r\nselected for their natural gifts, are prevented from becoming sires.\r\nSimilarly, the mares who win races as fillies, are not allowed to\r\nwaste their strength in being ridden or driven, but are tended under\r\nsanatory conditions for the sole purpose of bearing offspring. It is\r\nbetter economy, in the long-run, to use the best mares as breeders\r\nthan as workers, the loss through their withdrawal from active\r\nservice being more than recouped in the next generation through what\r\nis gained by their progeny.\r\n\r\nThe college statutes to which I referred were very recently relaxed\r\nat Oxford, and have been just reformed at Cambridge. I am told that\r\nnumerous marriages have ensued in consequence, or are ensuing. In\r\n_Hereditary Genius_ I showed that scholastic success runs strongly\r\nin families; therefore, in all seriousness, I have no doubt, that\r\nthe number of Englishmen naturally endowed with high scholastic\r\nfaculties, will be sensibly increased in future generations by the\r\nrepeal of these ancient statutes.\r\n\r\nThe English race has yet to be explored and their now unknown wealth\r\nof hereditary gifts recorded, that those who possess such a\r\npatrimony should know of it. The natural impulses of mankind would\r\nthen be sufficient to ensure that such wealth should no more\r\ncontinue to be neglected than the existence of any other possession\r\nsuddenly made known to a man. Aristocracies seldom make alliances\r\nout of their order, except to gain wealth. Is it less to be expected\r\nthat those who become aware that they are endowed with the power of\r\ntransmitting valuable hereditary gifts should abstain from\r\nsquandering their future children's patrimony by marrying persons of\r\nlower natural stamp? The social consideration that would attach\r\nitself to high races would, it may be hoped, partly neutralise a\r\nsocial cause that is now very adverse to the early marriages of the\r\nmost gifted, namely, the cost of living in cultured and refined\r\nsociety. A young man with a career before him commonly feels it\r\nwould be an act of folly to hamper himself by too early a marriage.\r\nThe doors of society that are freely open to a bachelor are closed\r\nto a married couple with small means, unless they bear patent\r\nrecommendations such as the public recognition of a natural nobility\r\nwould give. The attitude of mind that I should expect to predominate\r\namong those who had undeniable claims to rank as members of an\r\nexceptionally gifted race, would be akin to that of the modern\r\npossessors of ancestral property or hereditary rank. Such persons\r\nfeel it a point of honour not to alienate the old place or make\r\nmisalliances, and they are respected for their honest family pride.\r\nSo a man of good race would shrink from spoiling it by a lower\r\nmarriage, and every one would sympathise with his sentiments.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nIt remains to sketch in outline the principal conclusions to which\r\nwe seem to be driven by the results of the various inquiries\r\ncontained in this volume, and by what we know on allied topics from\r\nthe works of others.\r\n\r\nWe cannot but recognise the vast variety of natural faculty, useful\r\nand harmful, in members of the same race, and much more in the human\r\nfamily at large, all of which tend to be transmitted by inheritance.\r\nNeither can we fail to observe that the faculties of men generally,\r\nare unequal to the requirements of a high and growing civilisation.\r\nThis is principally owing to their entire ancestry having lived up\r\nto recent times under very uncivilised conditions, and to the\r\nsomewhat capricious distribution in late times of inherited wealth,\r\nwhich affords various degrees of immunity from the usual selective\r\nagencies.\r\n\r\nIn solution of the question whether a continual improvement in\r\neducation might not compensate for a stationary or even retrograde\r\ncondition of natural gifts, I made inquiry into the life history of\r\ntwins, which resulted in proving the vastly preponderating effects\r\nof nature over nurture.\r\n\r\nThe fact that the very foundation and outcome of the human mind is\r\ndependent on race, and that the qualities of races vary, and\r\ntherefore that humanity taken as a whole is not fixed but variable,\r\ncompels us to reconsider what may be the true place and function of\r\nman in the order of the world. I have examined this question freely\r\nfrom many points of view, because whatever may be the vehemence with\r\nwhich particular opinions are insisted upon, its solution is\r\nunquestionably doubtful. There is a wide and growing conviction\r\namong truth-seeking, earnest, humble-minded, and thoughtful men,\r\nboth in this country and abroad, that our cosmic relations are by no\r\nmeans so clear and simple as they are popularly supposed to be,\r\nwhile the worthy and intelligent teachers of various creeds, who\r\nhave strong persuasions on the character of those relations, do not\r\nconcur in their several views.\r\n\r\nThe results of the inquiries I have made into certain alleged forms\r\nof our relations with the unseen world do not, so far as they go,\r\nconfirm the common doctrines. One, for example, on the objective\r\nefficacy of prayer[20] was decidedly negative. It showed that while\r\ncontradicting the commonly expressed doctrine, it concurred with the\r\nalmost universal practical opinion of the present day. Another\r\ninquiry into visions showed that, however ill explained they may\r\nstill be, they belong for the most part, if not altogether, to an\r\norder of phenomena which no one dreams in other cases of calling\r\nsupernatural. Many investigations concur in showing the vast\r\nmultiplicity of mental operations that are in simultaneous action,\r\nof which only a minute part falls within the ken of consciousness,\r\nand suggest that much of what passes for supernatural is due to one\r\nportion of our mind being contemplated by another portion of it, as\r\nif it had been that of another person. The term \"individuality\" is\r\nin fact a most misleading word.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 20: Not reprinted in this edition.]\r\n\r\nI do not for a moment wish to imply that the few inquiries published\r\nin this volume exhaust the list of those that might be made, for I\r\ndistinctly hold the contrary, but I refer to them in corroboration\r\nof the previous assertion that our relations with the unseen world\r\nare different to those we are commonly taught to believe.\r\n\r\nIn our doubt as to the character of our mysterious relations with\r\nthe unseen ocean of actual and potential life by which we are\r\nsurrounded, the generally accepted fact of the solidarity of the\r\nuniverse--that is, of the intimate connections between distant parts\r\nthat bind it together as a whole--justifies us, I think, in looking\r\nupon ourselves as members of a vast system which in one of its\r\naspects resembles a cosmic republic.\r\n\r\nOn the one hand, we know that evolution has proceeded during an\r\nenormous time on this earth, under, so far as we can gather, a\r\nsystem of rigorous causation, with no economy of time or of\r\ninstruments, and with no show of special ruth for those who may in\r\npure ignorance have violated the conditions of life.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, while recognising the awful mystery of conscious\r\nexistence and the inscrutable background of evolution, we find that\r\nas the foremost outcome of many and long birth-throes, intelligent\r\nand kindly man finds himself in being. He knows how petty he is, but\r\nhe also perceives that he stands here on this particular earth, at\r\nthis particular time, as the heir of untold ages and in the van of\r\ncircumstance. He ought therefore, I think, to be less diffident than\r\nhe is usually instructed to be, and to rise to the conception that\r\nhe has a considerable function to perform in the order of events,\r\nand that his exertions are needed. It seems to me that he should\r\nlook upon himself more as a freeman, with power of shaping the\r\ncourse of future humanity, and that he should look upon himself less\r\nas the subject of a despotic government, in which case it would be\r\nhis chief merit to depend wholly upon what had been regulated for him,\r\nand to render abject obedience.\r\n\r\nThe question then arises as to the way in which man can assist in\r\nthe order of events. I reply, by furthering the course of evolution.\r\nHe may use his intelligence to discover and expedite the changes\r\nthat are necessary to adapt circumstance to race and race to\r\ncircumstance, and his kindly sympathy will urge him to effect them\r\nmercifully.\r\n\r\nWhen we begin to inquire, with some misgiving perhaps, as to the\r\nevidence that man has present power to influence the quality of\r\nfuture humanity, we soon discover that his past influence in that\r\ndirection has been very large indeed. It has been exerted hitherto\r\nfor other ends than that which is now contemplated, such as for\r\nconquest or emigration, also through social conditions whose effects\r\nupon race were imperfectly foreseen. There can be no doubt that the\r\nhitherto unused means of his influence are also numerous and great.\r\nI have not cared to go much into detail concerning these, but\r\nrestricted myself to a few broad considerations, as by showing how\r\nlargely the balance of population becomes affected by the earlier\r\nmarriages of some of its classes, and by pointing out the great\r\ninfluence that endowments have had in checking the marriage of monks\r\nand scholars, and therefore the yet larger influence they might be\r\nexpected to have if they were directed not to thwart but to\r\nharmonise with natural inclination, by promoting early marriages in\r\nthe classes to be favoured. I also showed that a powerful influence\r\nmight flow from a public recognition in early life of the true value\r\nof the probability of future performance, as based on the past\r\nperformance of the ancestors of the child. It is an element of\r\nforecast, in addition to that of present personal merit, which has\r\nyet to be appraised and recognised. Its recognition would attract\r\nassistance in various ways, impossible now to specify, to the young\r\nfamilies of those who were most likely to stock the world with\r\nhealthy, moral, intelligent, and fair-natured citizens. The stream\r\nof charity is not unlimited, and it is requisite for the speedier\r\nevolution of a more perfect humanity that it should be so\r\ndistributed as to favour the best-adapted races. I have not spoken\r\nof the repression of the rest, believing that it would ensue\r\nindirectly as a matter of course; but I may add that few would\r\ndeserve better of their country than those who determine to live\r\ncelibate lives, through a reasonable conviction that their issue\r\nwould probably be less fitted than the generality to play their part\r\nas citizens.\r\n\r\nIt would be easy to add to the number of possible agencies by which\r\nthe evolution of a higher humanity might be furthered, but it is\r\npremature to do so until the importance of attending to the\r\nimprovement of our race shall have been so well established in the\r\npopular mind that a discussion of them would be likely to receive\r\nserious consideration.\r\n\r\nIt is hardly necessary to insist on the certainty that our present\r\nimperfect knowledge of the limitations and conditions of hereditary\r\ntransmission will be steadily added to; but I would call attention\r\nagain to the serious want of adequate materials for study in the\r\nform of life-histories. It is fortunately the case that many of the\r\nrising medical practitioners of the foremost rank are become strongly\r\nimpressed with the necessity of possessing them, not only for the\r\nbetter knowledge of the theory of disease, but for the personal\r\nadvantage of their patients, whom they now have to treat less\r\nappropriately than they otherwise would, through ignorance of their\r\nhereditary tendencies and of their illnesses in past years, the\r\nmedical details of which are rarely remembered by the patient, even\r\nif he ever knew them. With the help of so powerful a personal motive\r\nfor keeping life-histories, and of so influential a body as the\r\nmedical profession to advocate its being done,[21] and to show how\r\nto do it, there is considerable hope that the want of materials to\r\nwhich I have alluded will gradually be supplied.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 21: See an address on the Collective Investigation of\r\nDisease, by Sir William Gull, _British Medical Journal_, January 27,\r\n1883, p. 143; also the following address by Sir James Paget, p. 144.]\r\n\r\nTo sum up in a few words. The chief result of these Inquiries has\r\nbeen to elicit the religious significance of the doctrine of\r\nevolution. It suggests an alteration in our mental attitude, and\r\nimposes a new moral duty. The new mental attitude is one of a\r\ngreater sense of moral freedom, responsibility, and opportunity; the\r\nnew duty which is supposed to be exercised concurrently with, and\r\nnot in opposition to the old ones upon which the social fabric\r\ndepends, is an endeavour to further evolution, especially that of\r\nthe human race.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\n\r\nA.--COMPOSITE PORTRAITURE.\r\n\r\nThe object and methods of Composite Portraiture will be best\r\nexplained by the following extracts from memoirs describing its\r\nsuccessive stages, published in 1878, 1879, and 1881 respectively:--\r\n\r\nI. COMPOSITE PORTRAITS, MADE BY COMBINING\r\n   THOSE OF MANY DIFFERENT PERSONS INTO A SINGLE RESULTANT FIGURE.\r\n\r\n  [_Extract from Memoir read before the Anthropological Institute,\r\n  in 1878_.]\r\n\r\nI submit to the Anthropological Institute my first results in\r\ncarrying out a process that I suggested last August [1877] in my\r\npresidential address to the Anthropological Subsection of the\r\nBritish Association at Plymouth, in the following words:--\r\n\r\n\"Having obtained drawings or photographs of several persons alike in\r\nmost respects, but differing in minor details, what sure method is\r\nthere of extracting the typical characteristics from them? I may\r\nmention a plan which had occurred both to Mr. Herbert Spencer and\r\nmyself, the principle of which is to superimpose optically the\r\nvarious drawings, and to accept the aggregate result. Mr. Spencer\r\nsuggested to me in conversation that the drawings reduced to the\r\nsame scale might be traced on separate pieces of transparent paper\r\nand secured one upon another, and then held between the eye and the\r\nlight. I have attempted this with some success. My own idea was to\r\nthrow faint images of the several portraits, in succession, upon the\r\nsame sensitised photographic plate. I may add that it is perfectly\r\neasy to superimpose optically two portraits by means of a stereoscope,\r\nand that a person who is used to handle instruments will find a\r\ncommon double eyeglass fitted with stereoscopic lenses to be almost\r\nas effectual and far handier than the boxes sold in shops.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Spencer, as he informed me, had actually devised an instrument,\r\nmany years ago, for tracing mechanically, longitudinal, transverse,\r\nand horizontal sections of heads on transparent paper, intending to\r\nsuperimpose them, and to obtain an average result by transmitted\r\nlight.\r\n\r\nSince my address was published, I have caused trials to be made, and\r\nhave found, as a matter of fact, that the photographic process of\r\nwhich I there spoke enables us to obtain with mechanical precision a\r\ngeneralised picture; one that represents no man in particular, but\r\nportrays an imaginary figure possessing the average features of any\r\ngiven group of men. These ideal faces have a surprising air of\r\nreality. Nobody who glanced at one of them for the first time would\r\ndoubt its being the likeness of a living person, yet, as I have said,\r\nit is no such thing; it is the portrait of a type and not of an\r\nindividual.\r\n\r\nI begin by collecting photographs of the persons with whom I propose\r\nto deal. They must be similar in attitude and size, but no exactness\r\nis necessary in either of these respects. Then, by a simple\r\ncontrivance, I make two pinholes in each of them, to enable me to\r\nhang them up one in front of the other, like a pack of cards, upon\r\nthe same pair of pins, in such a way that the eyes of all the\r\nportraits shall be as nearly as possible superimposed; in which case\r\nthe remainder of the features will also be superimposed nearly enough.\r\nThese pinholes correspond to what are technically known to printers\r\nas \"register marks.\" They are easily made: A slip of brass or card\r\nhas an aperture cut out of its middle, and threads are stretched\r\nfrom opposite sides, making a cross.[22] Two small holes are drilled\r\nin the plate, one on either side of the aperture. The slip of brass\r\nis laid on the portrait with the aperture over its face. It is turned\r\nabout until one of the cross threads cuts the pupils of both the eyes,\r\nand it is further adjusted until the other thread divides the\r\ninterval between the pupils in two equal parts. Then it is held\r\nfirmly, and a prick is made through each of the holes.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 22: I am indebted for the woodcuts to the Editor of\r\n_Nature_, in which journal this memoir first appeared.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\nThe portraits being thus arranged, a photographic camera is directed\r\nupon them. Suppose there are eight portraits in the pack, and\r\nthat under existing circumstances it would require an exposure of\r\neighty seconds to give an exact photographic copy of any one\r\nof them. The general principle of proceeding is this, subject in\r\npractice to some variations of detail, depending on the different\r\nbrightness of the several portraits. We throw the image of each of\r\nthe eight portraits in turn upon the same part of the sensitised\r\nplate for ten seconds. Thus, portrait No. 1 is in the front of the\r\npack; we take the cap off the object glass of the camera for ten\r\nseconds, and afterwards replace it. We then remove No. 1 from the\r\npins, and No. 2 appears in the front; we take off the cap a second\r\ntime for ten seconds, and again replace it. Next we remove No. 2,\r\nand No. 3 appears in the front, which we treat as its predecessors,\r\nand so we go on to the last of the pack. The sensitised plate will\r\nnow have had its total exposure of eighty seconds; it is then\r\ndeveloped, and the print taken from it is the generalised picture of\r\nwhich I speak. It is a composite of eight component portraits. Those\r\nof its outlines are sharpest and darkest that are common to the\r\nlargest number of the components; the purely individual\r\npeculiarities leave little or no visible trace. The latter being\r\nnecessarily disposed equally on both sides of the average, the\r\noutline of the composite is the average of all the components. It is\r\na band and not a fine line, because the outlines of the components\r\nare seldom exactly superimposed. The band will be darkest in its\r\nmiddle whenever the component portraits have the same general type\r\nof features, and its breadth, or amount of blur, will measure the\r\ntendency of the components to deviate from the common type. This is\r\nso for the very same reason that the shot-marks on a target are more\r\nthickly disposed near the bull's-eye than away from it, and in a\r\ngreater degree as the marksmen are more skilful. All that has been\r\nsaid of the outlines is equally true as regards the shadows; the\r\nresult being that the composite represents an averaged figure, whose\r\nlineaments have been softly drawn. The eyes come out with\r\nappropriate distinctness, owing to the mechanical conditions under\r\nwhich the components are hung.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ]\r\n\r\nA composite portrait represents the picture that would rise before\r\nthe mind's eye of a man who had the gift of pictorial imagination in\r\nan exalted degree. But the imaginative power even of the highest\r\nartists is far from precise, and is so apt to be biassed by special\r\ncases that may have struck their fancies, that no two artists agree\r\nin any of their typical forms. The merit of the photographic\r\ncomposite is its mechanical precision, being subject to no errors\r\nbeyond those incidental to all photographic productions.\r\n\r\nI submit several composites made for me by Mr. H. Reynolds. The\r\nfirst set of portraits are those of criminals convicted of murder,\r\nmanslaughter, or robbery accompanied with violence. It will be\r\nobserved that the features of the composites are much better looking\r\nthan those of the components. The special villainous irregularities\r\nin the latter have disappeared, and the common humanity that\r\nunderlies them has prevailed. They represent, not the criminal, but\r\nthe man who is liable to fall into crime. All composites are better\r\nlooking than their components, because the averaged portrait of many\r\npersons is free from the irregularities that variously blemish the\r\nlooks of each of them.\r\n\r\nI selected these for my first trials because I happened to possess a\r\nlarge collection of photographs of criminals, through the kindness\r\nof Sir Edmund Du Cane, the Director-General of Prisons, for the\r\npurpose of investigating criminal types. They were peculiarly\r\nadapted to my present purpose, being all made of about the same size,\r\nand taken in much the same attitudes. It was while endeavouring to\r\nelicit the principal criminal types by methods of optical\r\nsuperimposition of the portraits, such as I had frequently employed\r\nwith maps and meteorological traces,[23] that the idea of composite\r\nfigures first occurred to me.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 23: _Conference at the Loan Exhibition of Scientific\r\nInstruments_, 1878. Chapman and Hall. Physical Geography Section, p.\r\n312, _On Means of Combining Various Data in Maps and Diagrams_, by\r\nFrancis Galton, F.R.S.]\r\n\r\nThe other set of composites are made from pairs of components. They\r\nare selected to show the extraordinary facility of combining almost\r\nany two faces whose proportions are in any way similar.\r\n\r\nIt will, I am sure, surprise most persons to see how well defined\r\nthese composites are. When we deal with faces of the same type, the\r\npoints of similarity far outnumber those of dissimilarity, and there\r\nis a much greater resemblance between faces generally than we who\r\nturn our attention to individual differences are apt to appreciate.\r\nA traveller on his first arrival among people of a race very\r\ndifferent to his own thinks them closely alike, and a Hindu has much\r\ndifficulty in distinguishing one Englishman from another.\r\n\r\nThe fairness with which photographic composites represent their\r\ncomponents is shown by six of the specimens. I wished to learn\r\nwhether the order in which the components were photographed made any\r\nmaterial difference in the result, so I had three of the portraits\r\narranged successively in each of their six possible combinations. It\r\nwill be observed that four at least of the six composites are\r\nclosely alike. I should say that in each of this set (which was made\r\nby the wet process) the last of the three components was always\r\nallowed a longer exposure than the second, and the second than the\r\nfirst, but it is found better to allow an equal time to all of them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The accompanying woodcut is as fair a representation\r\nof one of the composites as is practicable in ordinary printing. It\r\nwas photographically transferred to the wood, and the engraver has\r\nused his best endeavour to translate the shades into line engraving.\r\nThis composite is made out of only three components, and its\r\nthreefold origin is to be traced in the ears, and in the buttons to\r\nthe vest. To the best of my judgment, the original photograph is a\r\nvery exact average of its components; not one feature in it appears\r\nidentical with that of any one of them, but it contains a\r\nresemblance to all, and is not more like to one of them than to\r\nanother. However, the judgment of the wood engraver is different.\r\nHis rendering of the composite has made it exactly like one of its\r\ncomponents, which it must be borne in mind he had never seen. It is\r\njust as though an artist drawing a child had produced a portrait\r\nclosely resembling its deceased father, having overlooked an equally\r\nstrong likeness to its deceased mother, which was apparent to its\r\nrelatives. This is to me a most striking proof that the composite is\r\na true combination.]\r\n\r\nThe stereoscope, as I stated last August in my address at Plymouth,\r\naffords a very easy method of optically superimposing two portraits,\r\nand I have much pleasure in quoting the following letter, pointing\r\nout this fact as well as some other conclusions to which I also had\r\narrived. The letter was kindly forwarded to me by Mr. Darwin; it is\r\ndated last November, and was written to him by Mr. A.L. Austin, from\r\nNew Zealand, thus affording another of the many curious instances of\r\ntwo persons being independently engaged in the same novel inquiry at\r\nnearly the same time, and coming to similar results:--\r\n\r\n\r\n  INVERCARGILL, NEW ZEALAND,\r\n   _November 6th_, 1877.\r\n\r\n  To CHARLES DARWIN, Esq.\r\n\r\n\r\nSIR,--Although a perfect stranger to you, and living on the reverse\r\nside of the globe, I have taken the liberty of writing to you on a\r\nsmall discovery I have made in binocular vision in the stereoscope.\r\nI find by taking two ordinary carre-de-visite photos of two\r\ndifferent persons' faces, the portraits being about the same sizes,\r\nand looking about the same direction, and placing them in a\r\nstereoscope, the faces blend into one in a most remarkable manner,\r\nproducing in the case of some ladies' portraits, in every instance,\r\na _decided improvement_ in beauty. The pictures were not taken in a\r\nbinocular camera, and therefore do not stand out well, but by moving\r\none or both until the eyes coincide in the stereoscope the pictures\r\nblend perfectly. If taken in a binocular camera for the purpose,\r\neach person being taken on one half of the negative, I am sure the\r\nresults would be still more striking. Perhaps something might be\r\nmade of this in regard to the expression of emotions in man and the\r\nlower animals, &c. I have not time or opportunities to make\r\nexperiments, but it seems to me something might be made of this by\r\nphotographing the faces of different animals, different races of\r\nmankind, &c. I think a stereoscopic view of one of the ape tribe and\r\nsome low-caste human face would make a very curious mixture; also in\r\nthe matter of crossing of animals and the resulting offspring. It\r\nseems to me something also might result in photos of husband and\r\nwife and children, &c. In any case, the results are curious, if it\r\nleads to nothing else. Should this come to anything you will no\r\ndoubt acknowledge myself as suggesting the experiment, and perhaps\r\nsend me some of the results. If not likely to come to anything, a\r\nreply would much oblige me.\r\n\r\n Yours very truly,\r\n   A.L. AUSTIN, C.E., F.R.A.S.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. Carpenter informs me that the late Mr. Appold, the mechanician,\r\nused to combine two portraits of himself under the stereoscope. The\r\none had been taken with an assumed stern expression, the other with\r\na smile, and this combination produced a curious and effective\r\nblending of the two.\r\n\r\nConvenient as the stereoscope is, owing to its accessibility, for\r\ndetermining whether any two portraits are suitable in size and\r\nattitude to form a good composite, it is nevertheless a makeshift\r\nand imperfect way of attaining the required result. It cannot of\r\nitself combine two images; it can only place them so that the office\r\nof attempting to combine them may be undertaken by the brain. Now\r\nthe two separate impressions received by the brain through the\r\nstereoscope do not seem to me to be relatively constant in their\r\nvividness, but sometimes the image seen by the left eye prevails\r\nover that seen by the right, and _vice versâ_. All the other\r\ninstruments I am about to describe accomplish that which the\r\nstereoscope fails to do; they create true optical combinations. As\r\nregards other points in Mr. Austin's letter, I cannot think that the\r\nuse of a binocular camera for taking the two portraits intended to\r\nbe combined into one by the stereoscope would be of importance. All\r\nthat is wanted is that the portraits should be nearly of the same\r\nsize. In every other respect I cordially agree with Mr. Austin.\r\n\r\nThe best instrument I have as yet contrived and used for optical\r\nsuperimposition is a \"double-image prism\" of Iceland spar (see Fig.,\r\np. 228), formerly procured for me by the late Mr. Tisley, optician,\r\nBrompton Road. They have a clear aperture of a square, half an inch\r\nin the side, and when held at right angles to the line of sight will\r\nseparate the ordinary and extraordinary images to the amount of two\r\ninches, when the object viewed is held at seventeen inches from the\r\neye. This is quite sufficient for working with carte-de-visite\r\nportraits. One image is quite achromatic, the other shows a little\r\ncolour. The divergence may be varied and adjusted by inclining the\r\nprism to the line of sight. By its means the ordinary image of one\r\ncomponent is thrown upon the extraordinary image of the other, and\r\nthe composite may be viewed by the naked eye, or through a lens of\r\nlong focus, or through an opera-glass (a telescope is not so good)\r\nfitted with a sufficiently long draw-tube to see an object at that\r\nshort distance with distinctness. Portraits of somewhat different\r\nsizes may be combined by placing the larger one farther from the eye,\r\nand a long face may be fitted to a short one by inclining and\r\nforeshortening the former. The slight fault of focus thereby\r\noccasioned produces little or no sensible ill effect on the\r\nappearance of the composite.\r\n\r\nThe front, or the profile, faces of two living persons sitting side\r\nby side or one behind the other, can be easily superimposed by a\r\ndouble-image prism. Two such prisms set one behind the other can be\r\nmade to give four images of equal brightness, occupying the four\r\ncorners of a rhombus whose acute angles are 45°. Three prisms will\r\ngive eight images, but this is practically not a good combination;\r\nthe images fail in distinctness, and are too near together for use.\r\nAgain, each lens of a stereoscope of long focus can have one or a\r\npair of these prisms attached to it, and four or eight images may be\r\nthus combined.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1 shows the simple apparatus which carries the\r\nprism and on which the photograph is mounted. The former is set in a\r\nround box which can be rotated in the ring at the end of the arm and\r\ncan be clamped when adjusted. The arm can be rotated and can also be\r\npulled out or in if desired, and clamped. The floor of the\r\ninstrument is overlaid with cork covered with black cloth, on which\r\nthe components can easily be fixed by drawing-pins. When using it,\r\none portrait is pinned down and the other is moved near to it,\r\noverlapping its margin if necessary, until the eye looking through\r\nthe prism sees the required combination; then the second portrait is\r\npinned down also. It may now receive its register-marks from needles\r\nfixed in a hinged arm, and this is a more generally applicable\r\nmethod than the plan with cross threads, already described, as any\r\ndesired feature--the nose, the ear, or the hand, may thus be\r\nselected for composite purposes. Let A, B, C, ... Y, Z, be the\r\ncomponents. A is pinned down, and B, C, ... Y, Z, are successfully\r\ncombined with A, and registered. Then before removing Z, take away A\r\nand substitute any other of the already registered portraits, say B,\r\nby combining it with Z; lastly, remove Z and substitute A by\r\ncombining it with B, and register it. Fig. 2 shows one of three\r\nsimilarly jointed arms, which clamp on to the vertical covered with\r\ncork and cloth, and the other carries Fig. 3, which is a frame\r\nhaving lenses of different powers set into it, and on which, or on\r\nthe third frame, a small mirror inclined at 45º may be laid. When a\r\nportrait requires foreshortening it can be pinned on one of these\r\nframes and be inclined to the line of sight; when it is smaller than\r\nits fellow it can be brought nearer to the eye and an appropriate\r\nlens interposed; when a right-sided profile has to be combined with a\r\nleft-handed one, it must be pinned on one of the frames and viewed by\r\nreflection from the mirror in the other. The apparatus I have drawn\r\nis roughly made, and being chiefly of wood is rather clumsy, but it\r\nacts well.]\r\n\r\nAnother instrument I have made consists of a piece of glass inclined\r\nat a very acute angle to the line of sight, and of a mirror beyond it,\r\nalso inclined, but in the opposite direction to the line of sight.\r\nTwo rays of light will therefore reach the eye from each point of\r\nthe glass; the one has been reflected from its surface, and the\r\nother has been first reflected from the mirror, and then transmitted\r\nthrough the glass. The glass used should be extremely thin, to avoid\r\nthe blur due to double reflections; it may be a selected piece from\r\nthose made to cover microscopic specimens. The principle of the\r\ninstrument may be yet further developed by interposing additional\r\npieces of glass, successively less inclined to the line of sight,\r\nand each reflecting a different portrait.\r\n\r\nI have tried many other plans; indeed the possible methods of\r\noptically superimposing two or more images are very numerous. Thus I\r\nhave used a sextant (with its telescope attached); also strips of\r\nmirrors placed at different angles, their several reflections being\r\nsimultaneously viewed through a telescope. I have also used a\r\ndivided lens, like two stereoscopic lenses brought close together,\r\nin front of the object glass of a telescope.\r\n\r\n\r\nII. GENERIC IMAGES.\r\n\r\n  [_Extract from Proceedings Royal Institution, 25th April 1879_]\r\n\r\nOur general impressions are founded upon blended memories, and these\r\nlatter will be the chief topic of the present discourse. An analogy\r\nwill be pointed out between these and the blended portraits first\r\ndescribed by myself a year ago under the name of \"Composite Portraits,\"\r\nand specimens of the latter will be exhibited.\r\n\r\nThe physiological basis of memory is simple enough in its broad\r\noutlines. Whenever any group of brain elements has been excited by a\r\nsense impression, it becomes, so to speak, tender, and liable to be\r\neasily thrown again into a similar state of excitement. If the new\r\ncause of excitement differs from the original one, a memory is the\r\nresult. Whenever a single cause throws different groups of brain\r\nelements simultaneously into excitement, the result must be a\r\nblended memory.\r\n\r\nWe are familiar with the fact that faint memories are very apt to\r\nbecome confused. Thus some picture of mountain and lake in a country\r\nwhich we have never visited, often recalls a vague sense of identity\r\nwith much we have seen elsewhere. Our recollections cannot be\r\ndisentangled, though general resemblances are recognised. It is also\r\na fact that the memories of persons who have great powers of\r\nvisualising, that is, of seeing well-defined images in the mind's eye,\r\nare no less capable of being blended together. Artists are, as a\r\nclass, possessed of the visualising power in a high degree, and they\r\nare at the same time pre-eminently distinguished by their gifts of\r\ngeneralisation. They are of all men the most capable of producing\r\nforms that are not copies of any individual, but represent the\r\ncharacteristic features of classes.\r\n\r\nThere is then, no doubt, from whatever side the subject of memory is\r\napproached, whether from the material or from the mental, and, in\r\nthe latter case, whether we examine the experiences of those in whom\r\nthe visualising faculty is faint or in whom it is strong, that the\r\nbrain has the capacity of blending memories together. Neither can\r\nthere be any doubt that general impressions are faint and perhaps\r\nfaulty editions of blended memories. They are subject to errors of\r\ntheir own, and they inherit all those to which the memories are\r\nthemselves liable.\r\n\r\nSpecimens of blended portraits will now be exhibited; these might,\r\nwith more propriety, be named, according to the happy phrase of\r\nProfessor Huxley, \"generic\" portraits. The word generic presupposes\r\na genus, that is to say, a collection of individuals who have much\r\nin common, and among whom medium characteristics are very much more\r\nfrequent than extreme ones. The same idea is sometimes expressed by\r\nthe word \"typical,\" which was much used by Quetelet, who was the\r\nfirst to give it a rigorous interpretation, and whose idea of a type\r\nlies at the basis of his statistical views. No statistician dreams\r\nof combining objects into the same generic group that do not cluster\r\ntowards a common centre; no more should we attempt to compose\r\ngeneric portraits out of heterogeneous elements, for if we do so the\r\nresult is monstrous and meaningless.\r\n\r\nIt might be expected that when many different portraits are fused\r\ninto a single one, the result would be a mere smudge. Such, however,\r\nis by no means the case, under the conditions just laid down, of a\r\ngreat prevalence of the mediocre characteristics over the extreme\r\nones. There are then so many traits in common, to combine and to\r\nreinforce one another, that they prevail to the exclusion of the rest.\r\nAll that is common remains, all that is individual tends to disappear.\r\n\r\nThe first of the composites exhibited on this occasion is made by\r\nconveying the images of three separate portraits by means of three\r\nseparate magic-lanterns upon the same screen. The stands on which\r\nthe lanterns are mounted have been arranged to allow of nice\r\nadjustment. The composite about to be shown is one that strains the\r\npowers of the process somewhat too severely, the portraits combined\r\nbeing those of two brothers and their sister, who have not even been\r\nphotographed in precisely the same attitudes. Nevertheless, the\r\nresult is seen to be the production of a face, neither male nor\r\nfemale, but more regular and handsome than any of the component\r\nportraits, and in which the common family traits are clearly marked.\r\nGhosts of portions of male and female attire, due to the\r\npeculiarities of the separate portraits, are seen about and around\r\nthe composite, but they are not sufficiently vivid to distract the\r\nattention. If the number of combined portraits had been large, these\r\nghostly accessories would have become too faint to be visible.\r\n\r\nThe next step is to compare this portrait of two brothers and their\r\nsister which has been composed by optical means before the eyes of\r\nthe audience, and concerning the truthfulness of which there can be\r\nno doubt, with a photographic composite of the same group. The\r\nlatter is now placed in a fourth magic-lantern with a brighter light\r\nbehind it, and its image is thrown on the screen by the side of the\r\ncomposite produced by direct optical superposition. It will be\r\nobserved that the two processes lead to almost exactly the same\r\nresult, and therefore the fairness of the photographic process may\r\nbe taken for granted. However, two other comparisons will be made\r\nfor the sake of verification, namely, between the optical and\r\nphotographic composites of two children, and again between those of\r\ntwo Roman contadini.\r\n\r\nThe composite portraits that will next be exhibited are made by the\r\nphotographic process, and it will now be understood that they are\r\ntruly composite, notwithstanding their definition and apparent\r\nindividuality. Attention is, however, first directed to a convenient\r\ninstrument not more than 18 inches in length, which is, in fact, a\r\nphotographic camera with six converging lenses and an attached screen,\r\non which six pictures can be adjusted and brilliantly illuminated by\r\nartificial light. The effect of their optical combination can thus\r\nbe easily studied; any errors of adjustment can be rectified, and\r\nthe composite may be photographed at once.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed that any one of the components fails to\r\nleave its due trace in the photographic composite, much less in the\r\noptical one. In order to allay misgivings on the subject, a small\r\napparatus is laid on the table together with some of the results\r\nobtained by it. It is a cardboard frame, with a spring shutter\r\nclosing an aperture of the size of a wafer, that springs open on the\r\npressure of a finger, and shuts again as suddenly when the pressure\r\nis withdrawn. A chronograph is held in the other hand, whose index\r\nbegins to travel the moment the finger presses a spring, and stops\r\ninstantly on lifting the finger. The two instruments are worked\r\nsimultaneously; the chronograph checking the time allowed for each\r\nexposure and summing all the times. It appears from several trials\r\nthat the effect of 1000 brief exposures is practically identical\r\nwith that of a single exposure of 1000 times the duration of any one\r\nof them. Therefore each of a thousand components leaves its due\r\nphotographic trace on the composite, though it is far too faint to\r\nbe visible unless reinforced by many similar traces.\r\n\r\nThe composites now to be exhibited are made from coins or medals,\r\nand in most instances the aim has been to obtain the best likeness\r\nattainable of historical personages, by combining various portraits\r\nof them taken at different periods of their lives, and so to elicit\r\nthe traits that are common to each series. A few of the individual\r\nportraits are placed in the same slide with each composite to give a\r\nbetter idea of the character of these blended representatives. Those\r\nthat are shown are (1) Alexander the Great, from six components;\r\n(2) Antiochus, King of Syria, from six; (3) Demetrius Poliorcetes,\r\nfrom six; (4) Cleopatra, from five. Here the composite is as usual\r\nbetter looking than any of the components, none of which, however,\r\ngive any indication of her reputed beauty; in fact, her features are\r\nnot only plain, but to an ordinary English taste are simply hideous.\r\n(5) Nero, from eleven; (6) A combination of five different Greek\r\nfemale faces; and (7) A singularly beautiful combination of the\r\nfaces of six different Roman ladies, forming a charming ideal profile.\r\n\r\nMy cordial acknowledgment is due to Mr. R. Stuart Poole, the learned\r\ncurator of the coins and gems in the British Museum, for his kind\r\nselection of the most suitable medals, and for procuring casts of\r\nthem for me for the present purpose. These casts were, with one\r\nexception, all photographed to a uniform size of four-tenths of an\r\ninch between the pupils of the eyes and the division between the lips,\r\nwhich experience shows to be the most convenient size on the whole\r\nto work with, regard being paid to many considerations not worth\r\nwhile to specify in detail. When it was necessary the photograph was\r\nreversed. These photographs were made by Mr. H. Reynolds; I then\r\nadjusted and prepared them for taking the photographic composite.\r\n\r\nThe next series to be exhibited consists of composites taken from\r\nthe portraits of criminals convicted of murder, manslaughter, or\r\ncrimes accompanied by violence. There is much interest in the fact\r\nthat two types of features are found much more frequently among\r\nthese than among the population at large. In one, the features are\r\nbroad and massive, like those of Henry VIII., but with a much\r\nsmaller brain. The other, of which five composites are exhibited,\r\neach deduced from a number of different individuals, varying four to\r\nnine, is a face that is weak and certainly not a common English face.\r\nThree of these composites, though taken from entirely different sets\r\nof individuals, are as alike as brothers, and it is found on\r\noptically combining any three out of the five composites, that is on\r\ncombining almost any considerable number of the individuals, the\r\nresult is closely the same. The combination of the three composites\r\njust alluded to will now be effected by means of the three\r\nconverging magic-lanterns, and the result may be accepted as generic\r\nin respect of this particular type of criminals.\r\n\r\nThe process of composite portraiture is one of pictorial statistics.\r\nIt is a familiar fact that the average height of even a dozen men of\r\nthe same race, taken at hazard, varies so little, that for ordinary\r\nstatistical purposes it may be considered constant. The same may be\r\nsaid of the measurement of every separate feature and limb, and of\r\nevery tint, whether of skin, hair, or eyes. Consequently a pictorial\r\ncombination of any one of these separate traits would lead to\r\nresults no less constant than the statistical averages. In a portrait,\r\nthere is another factor to be considered besides the measurement of\r\nthe separate traits, namely, their relative position; but this, too,\r\nin a sufficiently large group, would necessarily have a statistical\r\nconstancy. As a matter of observation, the resemblance between\r\npersons of the same \"genus\" (in the sense of \"generic,\" as already\r\nexplained) is sufficiently great to admit of making good pictorial\r\ncomposites out of even small groups, as has been abundantly shown.\r\n\r\nComposite pictures, are, however, much more than averages; they are\r\nrather the equivalents of those large statistical tables whose totals,\r\ndivided by the number of cases, and entered in the bottom line, are\r\nthe averages. They are real generalisations, because they include\r\nthe whole of the material under consideration. The blur of their\r\noutlines, which is never great in truly generic composites, except\r\nin unimportant details, measures the tendency of individuals to\r\ndeviate from the central type. My argument is, that the generic\r\nimages that arise before the mind's eye, and the general impressions\r\nwhich are faint and faulty editions of them, are the analogues of\r\nthese composite pictures which we have the advantage of examining at\r\nleisure, and whose peculiarities and character we can investigate,\r\nand from which we may draw conclusions that shall throw much light\r\non the nature of certain mental processes which are too mobile and\r\nevanescent to be directly dealt with.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII. COMPOSITE PORTRAITURE.\r\n\r\n  [_Read before the Photographic Society, 24th June, 1881_.]\r\n\r\nI propose to draw attention to-night to the results of recent\r\nexperiments and considerable improvements in a process of which I\r\npublished the principles three years ago, and which I have\r\nsubsequently exhibited more than once.\r\n\r\nI have shown that, if we have the portraits of two or more different\r\npersons, taken in the same aspect and under the same conditions of\r\nlight and shade, and that if we put them into different optical\r\nlanterns converging on the same screen and carefully adjust\r\nthem--first, so as to bring them to the same scale, and, secondly,\r\nso as to superpose them as accurately as the conditions admit--then\r\nthe different faces will blend surprisingly well into a single\r\ncountenance. If they are not very dissimilar, the blended result\r\nwill always have a curious air of individuality, and will be\r\nunexpectedly well defined; it will exactly resemble none of its\r\ncomponents, but it will have a sort of family likeness to all of them,\r\nand it will be an ideal and an averaged portrait. I have also shown\r\nthat the image on the screen might be photographed then and there,\r\nor that the same result may be much more easily obtained by a method\r\nof successive photography, and I have exhibited many specimens made\r\non this principle. Photo-lithographs of some of these will be found\r\nin the _Proceedings of the Royal Institution_, as illustrations of a\r\nlecture I gave there \"On Generic Images\" in 1879.\r\n\r\nThe method I now use is much better than those previously described;\r\nit leads to more accurate results, and is easier to manage. I will\r\nexhibit and explain the apparatus as it stands, and will indicate\r\nsome improvements as I go on. The apparatus is here. I use it by\r\ngaslight, and employ rapid dry plates, which, however, under the\r\nconditions of a particularly small aperture and the character of the\r\nlight, require sixty seconds of total exposure. The apparatus is 4\r\nfeet long and 6-1/2 inches broad; it lies with its side along the\r\nedge of the table at which I sit, and it is sloped towards me, so\r\nthat, by bending my neck slightly, I can bring my eye to an eye-hole,\r\nwhere I watch the effect of the adjustments which my hands are free\r\nto make. The entire management of the whole of these is within an\r\neasy arm's length, and I complete the process without shifting my\r\nseat.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus consists of three parts, A, B, and C. A is rigidly\r\nfixed; it contains the dark slide and the contrivances by which the\r\nposition of the image can be viewed; the eye-hole, _e_, already\r\nmentioned, being part of A. B is a travelling carriage that holds\r\nthe lens, and is connected by bellows-work with A. In my apparatus\r\nit is pushed out and in, and clamped where desired, but it ought to\r\nbe moved altogether by pinion and rack-work.[24] The lens I use is a\r\nI B Dallmeyer. Its focal length is appropriate to the size of the\r\ninstrument, and I find great convenience in a lens of wide aperture\r\nwhen making the adjustments, as I then require plenty of light; but,\r\nas to the photography, the smaller the aperture the better. The hole\r\nin my stop is only two-tenths of an inch in diameter, and I believe\r\none-tenth would be more suitable.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 24: I have since had a more substantial instrument made\r\nwith these and similar improvements.]\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIAGRAM SHOWING THE  ESSENTIAL  PARTS]\r\n\r\n_Side View._\r\n\r\n_End View._\r\n\r\nA The body of the camera, which is fixed.\r\n\r\nB Lens on a carriage, which can be\r\nmoved to and fro.\r\n\r\nC Frame for the transparency, on a carriage\r\nthat also supports the lantern;\r\nthe whole can be moved to and fro.\r\n\r\n_r_ The reflector inside the camera.\r\n\r\n_m_ The arm outside the camera attached\r\nto the axis of the reflector; by\r\nmoving it, the reflector can be\r\nmoved up or down.\r\n\r\n_g_ A ground-glass screen on the roof,\r\nwhich receives the image when the\r\nreflector is turned down, as in the\r\ndiagram.\r\n\r\n_e_ The eye-hole through which the image\r\nis viewed on _g_; a thin piece of\r\nglass immediately below _e_, reflects\r\nthe illuminated fiducial lines in the\r\ntransparency at _f_, and gives them\r\nthe appearance of lying upon _g_,--the\r\ndistances _f e_ and _g e_ being\r\nmade equal, the angle _f e g_ being\r\nmade a right angle, and the plane\r\nof the thin piece of glass being\r\nmade to bisect _f e g_.\r\n\r\n_f_ Framework, adjustable, holding the\r\ntransparency with the fiducial lines\r\non it.\r\n\r\n_t_ Framework, adjustable, holding the\r\ntransparency of the portrait.\r\n\r\nC is a travelling carriage that supports the portraits in turn, from\r\nwhich the composite has to be made. I work directly from the\r\noriginal negatives with transmitted light; but prints can be used\r\nwith light falling on their face. For convenience of description I\r\nwill confine myself to the first instance only, and will therefore\r\nspeak of C as the carriage that supports the frame that holds the\r\nnegative transparencies. C can be pushed along the board and be\r\nclamped anywhere, and it has a rack and pinion adjustment; but it\r\nshould have been made movable by rack and pinion along the whole\r\nlength of the board. The frame for the transparencies has the same\r\nmovements of adjustment as those in the stage of a microscope. It\r\nrotates round a hollow axis, through which a beam of light is thrown,\r\nand independent movements in the plane, at right angles to the axis,\r\ncan be given to it in two directions, at right angles to one another,\r\nby turning two separate screws. The beam of light is furnished by\r\nthree gas-burners, and it passes through a condenser. The gas is\r\nsupplied through a flexible tube that does not interfere with the\r\nmovements of C, and it is governed by a stop-cock in front of the\r\noperator.\r\n\r\nThe apparatus, so far as it has been described with any detail, and\r\nignoring what was said about an eye-hole, is little else than a\r\nmodified copying-camera, by which an image of the transparency could\r\nbe thrown on the ordinary focusing-screen, and be altered in scale\r\nand position until it was adjusted to fiducial lines drawn on the\r\nscreen. It is conceivable that this should be done, and that the\r\nscreen should be replaced by the dark slide, and a brief exposure\r\ngiven to the plate; then, that a fresh transparency should be\r\ninserted, a fresh focusing adjustment made, and a second exposure\r\ngiven, and so on. This, I say, is conceivable, but it would be very\r\ninconvenient. The adjusting screws would be out of reach; the head\r\nof the operator would be in an awkward position; and though these\r\ntwo difficulties might be overcome in some degree, a serious risk of\r\nan occasional shift of the plate during the frequent replacement of\r\nthe dark slide would remain. I avoid all this by making my\r\nadjustments while the plate continues in position with its front open.\r\nI do so through the help of a reflector temporarily interposed\r\nbetween it and the lens. I do not use the ordinary focusing-screen\r\nat all in making my adjustments, but one that is flush, or nearly so,\r\nwith the roof of the camera. When the reflector is interposed, the\r\nimage is wholly cut off from the sensitised plate, and is thrown\r\nupwards against this focusing-screen, _g_. When the reflector is\r\nwithdrawn, the image falls on the plate. It is upon this\r\nfocusing-screen in the roof that I see the fiducial lines by which I\r\nmake all the adjustments. Nothing can be more convenient than the\r\nposition of this focusing-screen for working purposes. I look down\r\non the image as I do upon a book resting on a sloping desk, and all\r\nthe parts of the apparatus are within an easy arm's length.\r\n\r\nMy reflector in my present instrument is, I am a little ashamed to\r\nconfess, nothing better than a piece of looking-glass fixed to an\r\naxle within the camera, near its top left-hand edge. One end of the\r\naxle protrudes, and has a short arm; when I push the arm back, the\r\nmirror is raised; when I push it forward it drops down. I used a\r\nswing-glass because the swing action is very true, and as my\r\napparatus was merely a provisional working model made of soft wood,\r\nI did not like to use sliding arrangements which might not have\r\nacted truly, or I should certainly have employed a slide with a\r\nrectangular glass prism, on account of the perfect reflection it\r\naffords. And let me say, that a prism of 2 inches square in the side\r\nis quite large enough for adjustment purposes, for it is only the\r\nface of the portrait that is wanted to be seen. I chose my\r\nlooking-glass carefully, and selected a piece that was plane and\r\nparallel. It has not too high a polish, and therefore does not give\r\ntroublesome double reflections. In fact, it answers very respectably,\r\nespecially when we consider that perfection of definition is thrown\r\naway on composites. I thought of a mirror silvered on the front of\r\nthe glass, but this would soon tarnish in the gaslight, so I did not\r\ntry it. For safety against the admission of light unintentionally, I\r\nhave a cap to the focusing-screen in the roof, and a slide in the\r\nfixed body of the instrument immediately behind the reflector and\r\nbefore the dark slide. Neither of these would be wanted if the\r\nreflector was replaced by a prism, set into one end of a sliding\r\nblock that had a large horizontal hole at the other end, and a\r\nsufficient length of solid wood between the two to block out the\r\npassage of light both upwards and downwards whenever the block is\r\npassing through the half-way position.\r\n\r\nAs regards the fiducial lines, they might be drawn on the glass\r\nscreen; but black lines are not, I find, the best. It is far easier\r\nto work with illuminated lines; and it is important to be able to\r\ncontrol their brightness. I produce these lines by means of a\r\nvertical transparency, set in an adjustable frame, connected with A,\r\nand having a gas-light behind it. Below the eye-hole _e_, through\r\nwhich I view the glass-screen _g_, is a thin piece of glass set at\r\nan angle of 45°, which reflects the fiducial lines and gives them\r\nthe appearance of lying on the screen, the frame being so adjusted\r\nthat the distance from the thin piece of glass to the transparency\r\nand to the glass-screen _g_ is the same. I thus obtain beautiful\r\nfiducial lines, which I can vary from extreme faintness to extreme\r\nbrilliancy, by turning the gas lower or higher, according to the\r\nbrightness of the image of the portrait, which itself depends on the\r\ndensity of the transparency that I am engaged upon. This arrangement\r\nseems as good as can be. It affords a gauge of the density of the\r\nnegative, and enables me to regulate the burners behind it, until\r\nthe image of the portrait on _g_ is adjusted to a standard degree of\r\nbrightness.\r\n\r\nFor convenience in enlarging or reducing, I take care that the\r\nintersection of the vertical fiducial line with that which passes\r\nthrough the pupils of the eyes shall correspond to the optical axis\r\nof the camera. Then, as I enlarge or reduce, that point in the image\r\nremains fixed. The uppermost horizontal fiducial line continues to\r\nintersect the pupils, and the vertical one continues to divide the\r\nface symmetrically. The mouth has alone to be watched. When the\r\nmouth is adjusted to the lower fiducial line, the scale is exact. It\r\nis a great help having to attend to no more than one varying element.\r\nThe only inconvenience is that the image does not lie in the best\r\nposition on the plate when the point between the eyes occupies its\r\ncentre. This is easily remedied by using a larger back with a\r\nsuitable inner frame. I have a more elaborate contrivance in my\r\napparatus to produce the same result, which I need not stop to\r\nexplain.\r\n\r\nFor success and speed in making composites, the apparatus should be\r\nsolidly made, chiefly of metal, and all the adjustments ought to\r\nwork smoothly and accurately. Good composites cannot be made without\r\nvery careful adjustment in scale and position. An off-hand way of\r\nworking produces nothing but failures.\r\n\r\nI will first exhibit a very simple but instructive composite effect.\r\nI drew on a square card a circle of about 2-1/2 inches in diameter,\r\nand two cross lines through its centre, cutting one another at right\r\nangles. Round each of the four points, 90° apart, where the cross\r\ncuts the circle, I drew small circles of the size of wafers and\r\ngummed upon each a disc of different tint. Finally I made a single\r\nblack dot half-way between two of the arms of the cross. I then made\r\na composite of the four positions of the card, as it was placed\r\nsuccessively with each of its sides downwards. The result is a\r\nphotograph having a sharply-defined cross surrounded by four discs\r\nof precisely uniform tint, and between each pair of arms of the\r\ncross there is a very faint dot. This photograph shows many things.\r\nThe fact of its being a composite is shown by the four faint dots.\r\nThe equality of the successive periods of exposure is shown by the\r\nequal tint of the four dots. The accuracy of adjustment is shown by\r\nthe sharpness of the cross being as great in the composite as in the\r\noriginal card. We see the smallness of the effect produced by any\r\ntrait, such as the dot, when it appears in the same place in only\r\none of the components: if this effect be so small in a series of\r\nonly four components, it would certainly be imperceptible in a much\r\nlarger series. Thirdly, the uniformity of resulting tint in the\r\ncomposite wafer is quite irrespective of the order of exposure. Let\r\nus call the four component wafers A, B, C, D, respectively, and the\r\nfour composite wafers 1, 2, 3, 4; then we see, by the diagram, that\r\nthe order of exposure has differed in each case, yet the result is\r\nidentical. Therefore the order of exposure has no effect on the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\n|----------+------------------------------------|\r\n|Composite.|Successive places of the Components.|\r\n| 1     2  | A    B | D    A | C    D | B    C  |\r\n| 4     3  | D    C | C    B | B    A | A    D  |\r\n|===============================================|\r\n\r\nIn 1 it has been A, D, C, B,\r\n \" 2    \"        B, A, D, C,\r\n \" 3    \"        C, B, A, D,\r\n \" 4    \"        D, C, B, A,\r\n\r\nI will next show a series consisting of two portraits considerably\r\nunlike to one another, and yet not so very discordant as to refuse\r\nto conform, and of two intermediate composites. In making one of the\r\ncomposites I gave two-thirds of the total time of exposure to the\r\nfirst portrait, and one-third to the second portrait. In making the\r\nother composite, I did the converse. It will be seen how good is the\r\nresult in both cases, and how the likeness of the longest exposed\r\nportrait always predominates.\r\n\r\nThe next is a series of four composites. The first consists of 57\r\nhospital patients suffering under one or other of the many forms of\r\nconsumption. I may say that, with the aid of Dr. Mahomed, I am\r\nendeavouring to utilise this process to elicit the physiognomy of\r\ndisease. The composite I now show is what I call a hotch-pot\r\ncomposite; its use is to form a standard whence deviations towards\r\nany particular sub-type may be conveniently gauged. It will be\r\nobserved that the face is strongly marked, and that it is quite\r\nidealised. I claim for composite portraiture, that it affords a\r\nmethod of obtaining _pictorial averages_, which effects\r\nsimultaneously for every point in a picture what a method of numerical\r\naverages would do for each point in the picture separately. It\r\ngives, in short, the average tint of every unit of area in the\r\npicture, measured from the fiducial lines as co-ordinates. Now every\r\nstatistician knows, by experience, that numerical averages usually\r\nbegin to agree pretty fairly when we deal with even twenty or thirty\r\ncases. Therefore we should expect to find that any groups of twenty\r\nor thirty men of the same class would yield composites bearing a\r\nconsiderable likeness to one another. In proof that this is the case,\r\nI exhibit three other composites: the one is made from the first 28\r\nportraits of the 57, the second from the last 27, and the third is\r\nmade from 36 portraits taken indiscriminately out of the 57. It will\r\nbe observed that all the four composites are closely alike.\r\n\r\nI will now show a few typical portraits I selected out of 82 male\r\nportraits of a different series of consumptive male patients; they\r\nwere those that had more or less of a particular wan look, that I\r\nwished to elicit. The selected cases were about 18 in number, and\r\nfrom these I took 12, rejecting about six as having some marked\r\npeculiarity that did not conform well with the remaining 12. The\r\nresult is a very striking face, thoroughly ideal and artistic, and\r\nsingularly beautiful. It is, indeed, most notable how beautiful all\r\ncomposites are. Individual peculiarities are all irregularities, and\r\nthe composite is always regular.\r\n\r\nI show a composite of 15 female faces, also of consumptive patients,\r\nthat gives somewhat the same aspect of the disease; also two others\r\nof only 6 in each, that have in consequence less of an ideal look,\r\nbut which are still typical. I have here several other typical faces\r\nin my collection of composites; they are all serviceable as\r\nillustrations of this memoir, but, medically speaking, they are only\r\nprovisional results.\r\n\r\nI am indebted to Lieutenant Leonard Darwin, R.E., for an interesting\r\nseries of negatives of officers and privates of the Royal Engineers.\r\nHere is a composite of 12 officers; here is one of 30 privates. I\r\nthen thought it better to select from the latter the men that came\r\nfrom the southern counties, and to again make a further selection of\r\n11 from these, on the principle already explained. Here is the\r\nresult. It is very interesting to note the stamp of culture and\r\nrefinement on the composite officer, and the honest and vigorous but\r\nmore homely features of the privates. The combination of these two,\r\nofficers and privates together, gives a very effective physiognomy.\r\n\r\nLet it be borne in mind that existing cartes-de-visite are almost\r\ncertain to be useless. Among dozens of them it is hard to find three\r\nthat fulfil the conditions of similarity of aspect and of shade. The\r\nnegatives have to be made on purpose. I use a repeating back and a\r\nquarter plate, and get two good-sized heads on each plate, and of a\r\nscale that never gives less than four-tenths of an inch between the\r\npupils of the eyes and the mouth. It is only the head that can be\r\nused, as more distant parts, even the ears, become blurred hopelessly.\r\n\r\nIt will be asked, of what use can all this be to ordinary\r\nphotographers, even granting that it may be of scientific value in\r\nethnological research, in inquiries into the physiognomy of disease,\r\nand for other special purposes? I think it can be turned to most\r\ninteresting account in the production of family likenesses. The most\r\nunartistic productions of amateur photography do quite as well for\r\nmaking composites as those of the best professional workers, because\r\ntheir blemishes vanish in the blended result. All that amateurs have\r\nto do is to take negatives of the various members of their families\r\nin precisely the same aspect (I recommend either perfect full-face\r\nor perfect profile), and under precisely the same conditions of\r\nlight and shade, and to send them to a firm provided with proper\r\ninstrumental appliances to make composites from them. The result is\r\nsure to be artistic in expression and flatteringly handsome, and\r\nwould be very interesting to the members of the family. Young and old,\r\nand persons of both sexes can be combined into one ideal face. I can\r\nwell imagine a fashion setting in to have these pictures.\r\n\r\nProfessional skill might be exercised very effectively in retouching\r\ncomposites. It would be easy to obliterate the ghosts of stray\r\nfeatures that are always present when the composite is made from\r\nonly a few portraits, and it would not be difficult to tone down any\r\nirregularity in the features themselves, due to some obtrusive\r\npeculiarity in one of the components. A higher order of artistic\r\nskill might be well bestowed upon the composites that have been made\r\nout of a large number of components. Here the irregularities\r\ndisappear, the features are perfectly regular and idealised, but the\r\nresult is dim. It is like a pencil drawing, where many attempts have\r\nbeen made to obtain the desired effect; such a drawing is smudged\r\nand ineffective; but the artist, under its guidance, draws his final\r\nwork with clear bold touches, and then he rubs out the smudge. On\r\nprecisely the same principle the faint but beautifully idealised\r\nfeatures of these composites are, I believe, capable of forming the\r\nbasis of a very high order of artistic work.\r\n\r\nB.--THE RELATIVE SUPPLIES FROM TOWN AND COUNTRY FAMILIES\r\n    TO THE POPULATION OF FUTURE GENERATIONS.\r\n\r\n  [_Read before the Statistical Society in_ 1873.]\r\n\r\nIt is well known that the population of towns decays, and has to be\r\nrecruited by immigrants from the country, but I am not aware that\r\nany statistical investigation has yet been attempted of the rate of\r\nits decay. The more energetic members of our race, whose breed is\r\nthe most valuable to our nation, are attracted from the country to\r\nour towns. If residence in towns seriously interferes with the\r\nmaintenance of their stock, we should expect the breed of Englishmen\r\nto steadily deteriorate, so far as that particular influence is\r\nconcerned.\r\n\r\nI am well aware that the only perfectly trustworthy way of\r\nconducting the inquiry is by statistics derived from numerous\r\nlife-histories, but I find it very difficult to procure these data.\r\nI therefore have had recourse to an indirect method, based on a\r\nselection from the returns made at the census of 1871, which appears\r\ncalculated to give a fair approximation to the truth. My object is\r\nto find the number of adult male representatives in this generation,\r\nof 1000 adult males in the previous one, of rural and urban\r\npopulations respectively. The principle on which I have proceeded is\r\nthis:--\r\n\r\nI find (A) the number of children of equal numbers of urban and of\r\nrural mothers. The census schedules contain returns of the names and\r\nages of the members of each \"family,\" by which word we are to\r\nunderstand those members who are alive and resident in the same\r\nhouse with their parents. When the mothers are young, the children\r\nare necessarily very young, and nearly always (in at least those\r\nclasses who are unable to send their children to boarding schools)\r\nlive at home. If, therefore, we limit our inquiries to the census\r\n\"families\" of young mothers, the results may be accepted as\r\npractically identical with those we should have obtained if we had\r\ndirect means of ascertaining the number of their living children.\r\nThe limits of age of the mothers which I adopted in my selection were,\r\n24 and 40 years. Had I to begin the work afresh, I should prefer\r\nthe period from 20 to 35, but I have reason to feel pretty well\r\ncontented with my present data. I correct the results thus far\r\nobtained on the following grounds:--(B) the relative mortality of\r\nthe two classes between childhood and maturity; (C) the relative\r\nmortality of the rural and urban mothers during childbearing ages;\r\n(D) their relative celibacy; and (E) the span of a rural and urban\r\ngeneration. It will be shown that B is important, and C noteworthy,\r\nbut that D and E may be disregarded.\r\n\r\nIn deciding on the districts to be investigated, it was important to\r\nchoose well-marked specimens of urban and rural populations. In the\r\nformer, a town was wanted where there were various industries, and\r\nwhere the population was not increasing. A town where only one\r\nindustry was pursued would not be a fair sample, because the\r\nparticular industry might be suspected of having a special influence,\r\nand a town that was increasing would have attracted numerous\r\nimmigrants from the country, who are undistinguishable as such in\r\nthe census returns. Guided by these considerations, I selected\r\nCoventry, where silk weaving, watch-making, and other industries are\r\ncarried on, and whose population had scarcely varied during the\r\ndecade preceding the census of 1871.[25] It is an open town, in\r\nwhich the crowded alleys of larger places are not frequent. Its urban\r\npeculiarities are therefore minimised, and its statistical returns\r\nwould give a picture somewhat too favourable of the average\r\ncondition of life in towns. For specimens of rural districts, I\r\nchose small agricultural parishes in Warwickshire.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 25:  It has greatly changed since this was written.]\r\n\r\nBy the courteous permission of Dr. Farr, I was enabled to procure\r\nextracts from the census returns concerning 1000 \"families\" of\r\nfactory hands at Coventry, in which the age of the mother was\r\nneither less than 24 nor more than 40 years, and concerning another\r\n1000 families of agricultural labourers in rural parishes of\r\nWarwickshire, under the same limitations as to the age of the mother.\r\nWhen these returns were classified (see Table I., p. 246), I found\r\nthe figures to run in such regular sequence as to make it certain\r\nthat the cases were sufficiently numerous to give trustworthy results.\r\nIt appeared that:\r\n\r\n(A) The 1000 families of factory hands comprised 2681 children, and\r\nthe 1000 of agricultural labourers comprised 2911; hence, the\r\nchildren in the urban \"families,\" the mothers being between the ages\r\nof 24 and 40, are on the whole about 8 per cent, less numerous than\r\nthe rural. I see no reason why these numbers should not be accepted\r\nas relatively correct for families, in the ordinary sense of that\r\nword, and for mothers of all ages. An inspection of the table does\r\nindeed show that if the selection had begun at an earlier age than 24,\r\nthere would have been an increased proportion of sterile and of\r\nsmall families among the factory hands, but not sufficient to\r\nintroduce any substantial modification of the above results. It is,\r\nhowever, important to recollect that the small error, whatever its\r\namount may be, is a concession in favour of the towns.\r\n\r\n(B) I next make an allowance for the mortality between childhood and\r\nmaturity, which will diminish the above figures in different\r\nproportions, because the conditions of town life are more fatal to\r\nchildren than those of the country. No life tables exist for\r\nCoventry and Warwickshire; I am therefore obliged to use statistics\r\nfor similarly conditioned localities, to determine the amount of the\r\nallowance that should be made. The life tables of Manchester [26]\r\nwill afford the data for towns, and those of the \"Healthy Districts\"\r\n[27] will suffice for the country. By applying these, we could\r\ncalculate the number of the children of ages specified in the census\r\nreturns who would attain maturity. I regret extremely that when I\r\nhad the copies taken, I did not give instructions to have the ages\r\nof all the children inserted; but I did not, and it is too late now\r\nto remedy the omission. I am therefore obliged to make a very rough,\r\nbut not unfair, estimate. The average age of the children was about\r\n3 years, and 25 years may be taken as representing the age of\r\nmaturity. Now it will be found that 74 per cent. of children in\r\nManchester, of the age of 3, reach the age of 25, while 86 per cent.\r\nof children do so in the \"Healthy Districts.\" Therefore, if my rough\r\nmethod be accepted as approximately fair, the number of adults who\r\nwill be derived from the children of the 1000 factory families\r\nshould be reckoned at (2681 × 74/100) = 1986, and those from the\r\n1000 agricultural at (2911 × 86/100) = 2503.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 26:  \"Seventh Annual Report of Registrar-General.\"]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 27:  Healthy Districts Life Table, by Dr. Farr. _Phil\r\nTrans. Royal Society_, 1859.]\r\n\r\n(C) The comparison we seek is between the total families produced by\r\nan equal number of urban and rural women who had survived the age of\r\n24. Many of these women will not marry at all; I postpone that\r\nconsideration to the next paragraph. Many of the rest will die\r\nbefore they reach the age of 40, and more of them will die in the\r\ntown than in the country. It appears from data furnished by the\r\nabove-mentioned tables, that if 100 women of the age of 24 had\r\nannually been added to a population, the number of those so added,\r\nliving between the ages of 24 and 40 (an interval of seventeen years)\r\nwould be 1539 under the conditions of life in Manchester, and 1585\r\nunder those of the healthy districts. Therefore the small factors to\r\nbe applied respectively to the two cases, on account of this\r\ncorrection, are 1539/(17 × 100) and 1585/(17 × 100).\r\n\r\n(D)  I have no trustworthy data for the relative prevalence of\r\ncelibacy in town and country. All that I have learned from the\r\ncensus returns is, that when searching them for the 1000 families,\r\n131 bachelors were noted between the ages of 24 and 40, among the\r\nfactory hands, and 144 among the agricultural labourers. If these\r\nfigures be accepted as correct guides to the amount of celibacy\r\namong the women, it would follow that I must be considered to have\r\ndiscussed the cases of 1131 factory, and 1144 agricultural women,\r\nwhen dealing with those of 1000 mothers in either class.\r\nConsequently that the respective corrections to be applied, are\r\ngiven by the factors 1000/1131 and 1000/1141 or 88.4/1000 and 87.6/\r\n1000. This difference of less than 1 per cent, is hardly worth\r\napplying, moreover I do not like to apply it, because it seems to me\r\nerroneous and to act in the wrong direction, inasmuch as unmarried\r\nwomen can obtain employment more readily in the town than in the\r\ncountry, and celibacy is therefore more likely to be common in the\r\nformer than in the latter.\r\n\r\n(E) The possible difference in the length of an urban and rural\r\ngeneration must not be forgotten. We, however, have reason to\r\nbelieve that the correction on this ground will be insignificant,\r\nbecause the length of a generation is found to be constant under\r\nvery different circumstances of race, and therefore we should expect\r\nit to be equally constant in the same race under different conditions;\r\nsuch as it is, it would probably tell against the towns.\r\n\r\nLet us now sum up the results.

Its interest lies in the\r\naccordance of the successive test values with the successive\r\ngraduations of a true scale of sensitivity, in the ease with which\r\nthe tests are applied, and the fact that the same principle can be\r\nmade use of in testing the delicacy of smell and taste.\r\n\r\nI use test-weights that mount in a series of \"just perceptible\r\ndifferences\" to an imaginary person of extreme delicacy of perception,\r\ntheir values being calculated according to Weber's law. The lowest\r\nweight is heavy enough to give a decided sense of weight to the hand\r\nwhen handling it, and the heaviest weight can be handled without any\r\nsense of fatigue. They therefore conform with close approximation to\r\na geometric series; thus--\r\n    _WR0, WR1, WR2, WR3_, etc.,\r\nand they bear as register-marks the values of the successive indices,\r\n0, 1, 2, 3, etc. It follows that if a person can just distinguish\r\nbetween any particular pair of weights, he can also just distinguish\r\nbetween any other pair of weights whose register-marks differ by the\r\nsame amount. Example: suppose A can just distinguish between the\r\nweights bearing the register-marks 2 and 4, then it follows from the\r\nconstruction of the apparatus that he can just distinguish between\r\nthose bearing the register-marks 1 and 3, or 3 and 5, or 4 and 6, etc.;\r\nthe difference being 2 in each case.\r\n\r\nThere can be but one interpretation of the phrase that the dulness\r\nof muscular sense in any person, B, is twice as great as in that of\r\nanother person, A. It is that B is only capable of perceiving one\r\ngrade of difference where A can perceive two. We may, of course,\r\nstate the same fact inversely, and say that the delicacy of muscular\r\nsense is in that case twice as great in A as in B. Similarly in all\r\nother cases of the kind. Conversely, if having known nothing\r\npreviously about either A or B, we discover on trial that A can just\r\ndistinguish between two weights such as those bearing the\r\nregister-marks 5 and 7, and that B can just distinguish between\r\nanother pair, say, bearing the register-marks 2 and 6; then since\r\nthe difference between the marks in the latter case is twice as\r\ngreat as in the former, we know that the dulness of the muscular\r\nsense of B is exactly twice that of A. Their relative dulness, or if\r\nwe prefer to speak in inverse terms, and say their relative\r\nsensitivity, is determined quite independently of the particular\r\npair of weights used in testing them.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that the conversion of results obtained by the\r\nuse of one series of test-weights into what would have been given\r\nby another series, is a piece of simple arithmetic, the fact\r\nultimately obtained by any apparatus of this kind being the \"just\r\ndistinguishable\" fraction of real weight. In my own apparatus the\r\nunit of weight is 2 per cent.; that is, the register-mark 1 means 2\r\nper cent.; but I introduce weights in the earlier part of the scale\r\nthat deal with half units; that is, with differences of 1 per cent.\r\nIn another apparatus the unit of weight might be 3 per cent., then\r\nthree grades of mine would be equal to two of the other, and mine\r\nwould be converted to that scale by multiplying them by 2/3. Thus\r\nthe results obtained by different apparatus are strictly comparable.\r\n\r\nA sufficient number of test-weights must be used, or trials made, to\r\neliminate the influence of chance. It might perhaps be thought that\r\nby using a series of only five weights, and requiring them to be\r\nsorted into their proper order by the sense of touch alone, the\r\nchance of accidental success would be too small to be worth\r\nconsideration. It might be said that there are 5 × 4 × 3 × 2, or 120\r\ndifferent ways in which five weights can be arranged, and as only\r\none is right, it must be 120 to 1 against a lucky hit. But this is\r\nmany fold too high an estimate, because the 119 possible mistakes\r\nare by no means equally probable. When a person is tested, an\r\napproximate value for his grade of sensitivity is rapidly found, and\r\nthe inquiry becomes narrowed to finding out whether he can surely\r\npass a particular mistake. He is little likely to make a mistake of\r\ndouble the amount in question, and it is almost certain that he will\r\nnot make a mistake of treble the amount. In other words, he would\r\nnever be likely to put one of the test-weights more than one step\r\nout of its proper place. If he had three weights to arrange in their\r\nconsecutive order, 1, 2, 3, there are 3×2 = 6 ways of arranging them;\r\nof these, he would be liable to the errors of 1, 3, 2, and of 2, 1, 3,\r\nbut he would hardly be liable to such gross errors as 2, 3, 1, or 3,\r\n2, 1, or 3, 1, 2. Therefore of the six permutations in which three\r\nweights may be arranged three have to be dismissed from consideration,\r\nleaving three cases only to be dealt with, of which two are wrong\r\nand one is right. For the same reason there are only four reasonable\r\nchances of error in arranging four weights, and only six in\r\narranging five weights, instead of the 119 that were originally\r\nsupposed. These are--\r\n\r\n12354        13245        13254\r\n21345        21354        21435\r\n\r\nBut exception might be taken to two even of these, namely, those\r\nthat appear in the third column, where 5 is found in juxtaposition\r\nwith 2 in the first case, and 4 with 1 in the second. So great a\r\ndifference between two adjacent weights would be almost sure to\r\nattract the notice of the person who was being tested, and make him\r\ndissatisfied with the arrangement. Considering all this, together\r\nwith the convenience of carriage and manipulation, I prefer to use\r\ntrays, each containing only three weights, the trials being made\r\nthree or four times in succession. In each trial there are three\r\npossibilities and only one success, therefore in three trials the\r\nprobabilities against uniform success are as 27 to 1, and in four\r\ntrials at 81 to 1.\r\n\r\n_Values of the Weights_.--After preparatory trials, I adopted 1000\r\ngrains as the value of _W_ and 1020 as that of _R_, but I am now\r\ninclined to think that 1010 would have been better. I made the\r\nweights by filling blank cartridges with shot, wool, and wads, so as\r\nto distribute the weight equally, and I closed the cartridges with a\r\nwad, turning the edges over it with the instrument well known to\r\nsportsmen. I wrote the corresponding value of the index of _R_ on\r\nthe wad by which each of them was closed, to serve as a register\r\nnumber. Thus the cartridge whose weight was _WR4_ was marked 4'. The\r\nvalues were so selected that there should be as few varieties as\r\npossible. There are thirty weights in all, but only ten varieties,\r\nwhose Register Numbers are respectively 0, 1, 2, 3, 3-1/2, 4-1/2, 5,\r\n6, 7, 9, 12. The reason of this limitation of varieties was to\r\nenable the weights to be interchanged whenever there became reason\r\nto suspect that the eye had begun to recognise the appearance of any\r\none of them, and that the judgment might be influenced by that\r\nrecognition, and cease to be wholly guided by the sense of weight.\r\n\r\nWe are so accustomed to deal with concurrent impressions that it is\r\nexceedingly difficult, even with the best intention of good faith,\r\nto ignore the influence of any corroborative impression that may be\r\npresent. It is therefore right to take precautions against this\r\npossible cause of inaccuracy. The most perfect way would be to drop\r\nthe weights, each in a little bag or sheath of light material, so\r\nthat the operatee could not see the weights, while the ratio between\r\nthe weights would not be sensibly changed by the additional weight\r\nof the bags. I keep little bags for this purpose, inside the box\r\nthat holds the weights.\r\n\r\n_Arrangement of the Weights_.--The weights are placed in sets of\r\nthrees, each set in a separate shallow tray, and the trays lie in\r\ntwo rows in a box. Each tray bears the register-marks of each of the\r\nweights it contains. It is also marked boldly with a Roman numeral\r\nshowing the difference between the register-marks of the adjacent\r\nweights. This difference indicates the grade of sensitivity that the\r\nweights in the tray are designed to test. Thus the tray containing\r\nthe weights _WR0_, _WR3_, _WR6_ is marked as in Fig. 1, and that\r\nwhich contains _WR2_, _WR7_, _WR12_ is marked as in Fig. 2.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2.]\r\n\r\nThe following is the arrangement of the trays in the box. The\r\ntriplets they contain suffice for ordinary purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\n|=========================================|\r\n| Just        |             |             |\r\n| perceptible | Grade of    | Sequences   |\r\n| Ratio.      | Sensitivity | of Weights  |\r\n|-------------+-------------+-------------|\r\n| 1.020       |    I.       |  1, 2, 3    |\r\n| 1.030       |   I.1/2     | 2, 3-1/2, 5 |\r\n| 1.040       |    II.      |  3, 5, 7    |\r\n| 1.050       |   II.1/2    | 2, 4-1/2, 7 |\r\n| 1.061       |    III.     |  0, 3, 6    |\r\n| 1.071       |  III.1/2    | 0, 3-1/2, 7 |\r\n| 1.082       |    IV.      |  1, 5, 9    |\r\n| 1.082       |   IV.1/2    | 0, 4-1/2, 9 |\r\n| 1.104       |     V.      |  2, 5, 7    |\r\n| 1.127       |    VI.      |  0, 6, 12   |\r\n|=========================================|\r\n\r\nBut it will be observed that sequences of 1/2 can also be obtained,\r\nand again, that it is easy to select doublets of weights for coarser\r\ntests, up to a maximum difference of XII., which may be useful in\r\ncases of morbidly diminished sensitivity.\r\n\r\n_Manipulation_.--A tray is taken out, the three weights that it\r\ncontains is shuffled by the operator who then passes them on to the\r\nexperimenter. The latter sits at ease with his hand in an\r\nunconstrained position, and lifts the weights in turn between his\r\nfinger and thumb, the finger pressing against the top, the thumb\r\nagainst the bottom of the cartridge. Guided by the touch alone, he\r\narranges them in the tray in what he conceives to be their proper\r\nsequence; he then returns the tray to the operator, who notes the\r\nresult, the operator then reshuffles the weights and repeats the\r\ntrial. It is necessary to begin with coarse preparatory tests, to\r\naccustom the operatee to the character of the work. After a minute\r\nor two the operator may begin to record results, and the testing may\r\ngo for several minutes, until the hand begins to tire, the judgment\r\nto be confused, and blunders to arise. Practice does not seem to\r\nincrease the delicacy of perception after the first few trials, so\r\nmuch as might be expected.\r\n\r\nD.--WHISTLES FOR TESTING THE UPPER LIMITS OF AUDIBLE SOUND IN\r\nDIFFERENT INDIVIDUALS.\r\n\r\nThe base of the inner tube of the whistle is the foremost end of a\r\nplug, that admits of being advanced or withdrawn by screwing it out\r\nor in; thus the depth of the inner tube of the whistle can be varied\r\nat pleasure. The more nearly the plug is screwed home, the less is\r\nthe depth of the whistle and the more shrill does its note become,\r\nuntil a point is reached at which, although the air that proceeds\r\nfrom it vibrates as violently as before, as shown by its effect on a\r\nsensitive flame, the note ceases to be audible.\r\n\r\nThe number of vibrations per second in the note of a whistle or\r\nother \"closed pipe\" depends on its depth. The theory of acoustics\r\nshows that the length of each complete vibration is four times that\r\nof the depth of the closed pipe, and since experience proves that\r\nall sound, whatever may be its pitch, is propagated at the same rate,\r\nwhich under ordinary conditions of temperature and barometric\r\npressure may be taken at 1120 feet, or 13,440 inches per second,--it\r\nfollows that the number of vibrations in the note of a whistle may\r\nbe found by dividing 13,440 by four times the depth, measured in\r\ninches, of the inner tube of the whistle. This rule, however,\r\nsupposes the vibrations of the air in the tube to be strictly\r\nlongitudinal, and ceases to apply when the depth of the tube is less\r\nthan about one and a half times its diameter. When the tube is\r\nreduced to a shallow pan, a note may still be produced by it, but\r\nthat note has reference rather to the diameter of the whistle than\r\nto its depth, being sometimes apparently unaltered by a further\r\ndecrease of depth. The necessity of preserving a fair proportion\r\nbetween the diameter and the depth of a whistle is the reason why\r\nthese instruments, having necessarily little depth, require to be\r\nmade with very small bores.\r\n\r\nThe depth of the inner tube of the whistle at any moment is shown by\r\nthe graduations on the outside of the instrument. The lower portion\r\nof the instrument as formerly made for me by the late Mr. Tisley,\r\noptician, Brompton Road,[28] is a cap that surrounds the body of the\r\nwhistle, and is itself fixed to the screw that forms the plug. One\r\ncomplete turn of the cap increases or diminishes the depth of the whistle,\r\nby an amount equal to the interval between two adjacent threads of the\r\nscrew. For mechanical convenience, a screw is used whose pitch is 25 to\r\nthe inch; therefore one turn of the cap moves the plug one twenty-fifth\r\nof an inch, or ten two-hundred-and-fiftieths. The edge of the cap is\r\ndivided into ten parts, each of which corresponds to the tenth of a\r\ncomplete turn; and, therefore, to one two-hundred-and-fiftieth of an\r\ninch. Hence in reading off the graduations the tens are shown on the\r\nbody of the whistle, and the units are shown on the edge of the cap.\r\n\r\nThe scale of the instrument having for its unit the two-hundred-and-\r\nfiftieth part of an inch, it follows that the number of vibrations\r\nin the note of the whistle is to be found by dividing (13440 x 250)/4\r\nor 84,000, by the graduations read off on its scale.\r\n\r\nA short table is annexed, giving the number of vibrations calculated\r\nby this formula, for different depths, bearing in mind that the\r\nearlier entries cannot be relied upon unless the whistle has a very\r\nminute bore, and consequently a very feeble note.\r\n\r\n===================================\r\n| Scale Readings |  Corresponding |\r\n| (one division  |  Number of     |\r\n|  = 1/250       |  Vibrations    |\r\n|  of an inch).  |  per Second    |\r\n|----------------+----------------|\r\n|      10        |      84,000    |\r\n|      15        |      56,000    |\r\n|      20        |      42,000    |\r\n|      25        |      33,600    |\r\n|      30        |      28,000    |\r\n|      35        |      24,000    |\r\n|      40        |      21,000    |\r\n|      45        |      28,666    |\r\n|      50        |      16,800    |\r\n|      55        |      15,273    |\r\n|      60        |      14,000    |\r\n|      65        |      12,923    |\r\n|      70        |      12,000    |\r\n|      75        |      11,200    |\r\n|      80        |      10,500    |\r\n|      85        |       9,882    |\r\n|      90        |       9,333    |\r\n|      95        |       8,842    |\r\n|     100        |       8,400    |\r\n|     105        |       8,000    |\r\n|     110        |       7,591    |\r\n|     115        |       7,305    |\r\n|     120        |       7,000    |\r\n|     125        |       6,720    |\r\n|     130        |       6,461    |\r\n===================================\r\n\r\n[Footnote 28: Mr. Hawksley, surgical instrument maker 307 Oxford\r\nStreet also makes these.]\r\n\r\nThe largest whistles suitable for experiments on the human ear, have\r\nan inner tube of about 0.16 inches in diameter, which is equal to 40\r\nunits of the scale. Consequently in these instruments the theory of\r\nclosed pipes ceases to be trustworthy when the depth of the whistle\r\nis less than about 60 units. In short, we cannot be sure of sounding\r\nwith them a higher note than one of 14,000 vibrations to the second,\r\nunless we use tubes of still smaller bore. In some of my experiments\r\nI was driven to use very fine tubes indeed, not wider than those\r\nlittle glass tubes that hold the smallest leads for Mordan's pencils.\r\nI have tried without much success to produce a note that should be\r\nboth shrill and powerful, and correspond to a battery of small\r\nwhistles, by flattening a piece of brass tube, and passing another\r\nsheet of brass up it, and thus forming a whistle the whole width of\r\nthe sheet, but of very small diameter from front to back. It made a\r\npowerful note, but not a very pure one. I also constructed an\r\nannular whistle by means of three cylinders, one sliding within the\r\nother two, and graduated as before.\r\n\r\nWhen the limits of audibility are approached, the sound becomes much\r\nfainter, and when that limit is reached, the sound usually gives\r\nplace to a peculiar sensation, which is not sound but more like\r\ndizziness, and which some persons experience to a high degree. Young\r\npeople hear shriller sounds than older people, and I am told there\r\nis a proverb in Dorsetshire, that no agricultural labourer who is\r\nmore than forty years old, can hear a bat squeak. The power of\r\nhearing shrill notes has nothing to do with sharpness of hearing,\r\nany more than a wide range of the key-board of a piano has to do\r\nwith the sound of the individual strings. We all have our limits,\r\nand that limit may be quickly found by these whistles in every case.\r\nThe facility of hearing shrill sounds depends in some degree on the\r\nposition of the whistle, for it is highest when it is held exactly\r\nopposite the opening of the ear. Any roughness of the lining of the\r\nauditory canal appears to have a marked effect in checking the\r\ntransmission of rapid vibrations when they strike the ear obliquely.\r\nI myself feel this in a marked degree, and I have long noted the\r\nfact in respect to the buzz of a mosquito. I do not hear the\r\nmosquito much as it flies about, but when it passes close by my ear\r\nI hear a \"ping,\" the suddenness of which is very striking. Mr. Dalby,\r\nthe aurist, to whom I gave one of these instruments, tells me he\r\nuses it for diagnoses. When the power of hearing high notes is\r\nwholly lost, the loss is commonly owing to failure in the nerves,\r\nbut when very deaf people are still able to hear high notes if they\r\nare sounded with force, the nerves are usually all right, and the\r\nfault lies in the lining of the auditory canal.\r\n\r\nE.--QUESTIONS ON VISUALISING AND OTHER ALLIED FACULTIES.\r\n\r\nThe Questions that I circulated were as follows; there was an\r\nearlier and uncomplete form, which I need not reproduce here.\r\n\r\nThe object of these Questions is to elicit the degree in which\r\ndifferent persons possess the power of seeing images in their mind's\r\neye, and of reviving past sensations.\r\n\r\nFrom inquiries I have already made, it appears that remarkable\r\nvariations exist both in the strength and in the quality of these\r\nfaculties, and it is highly probable that a statistical inquiry into\r\nthem will throw light upon more than one psychological problem.\r\n\r\nBefore addressing yourself to any of the Questions on the opposite\r\npage, think of some definite object--suppose it is your\r\nbreakfast-table as you sat down to it this morning--and consider\r\ncarefully the picture that rises before your mind's eye.\r\n\r\n1. _Illumination_.--Is the image dim or fairly clear? Is its\r\nbrightness comparable to that of the actual scene?\r\n\r\n2. _Definition_.--Are all the objects pretty well defined at the\r\nsame time, or is the place of sharpest definition at any one moment\r\nmore contracted than it is in a real scene?\r\n\r\n3. _Colouring_.--Are the colours of the china, of the toast, bread\r\ncrust, mustard, meat, parsley, or whatever may have been on the table,\r\nquite distinct and natural?\r\n\r\n4. _Extent of field of view_.--Call up the image of some panoramic\r\nview (the walls of your room might suffice), can you force yourself\r\nto see mentally a wider range of it than could be taken in by any\r\nsingle glance of the eyes? Can you mentally see more than three\r\nfaces of a die, or more than one hemisphere of a globe at the same\r\ninstant of time?\r\n\r\n5. _Distance of images_.--Where do mental images appear to be\r\nsituated? within the head, within the eye-ball, just in front of the\r\neyes, or at a distance corresponding to reality?   Can you project\r\nan image upon a piece of paper?\r\n\r\n6. _Command over images_.--Can you retain a mental picture steadily\r\nbefore the eyes? When you do so, does it grow brighter or dimmer?\r\nWhen the act of retaining it becomes wearisome, in what part of the\r\nhead or eye-ball is the fatigue felt?\r\n\r\n7. _Persons_.--Can you recall with distinctness the features of all\r\nnear relations and many other persons?    Can you at will cause your\r\nmental image of any or most of them to sit, stand, or turn slowly\r\nround?   Can you deliberately seat the image of a well-known person\r\nin a chair and see it with enough distinctness to enable you to\r\nsketch it leisurely (supposing yourself able to draw)?\r\n\r\n8. _Scenery_.--Do you preserve the recollection of scenery with much\r\nprecision of detail, and do you find pleasure in dwelling on it? Can\r\nyou easily form mental pictures from the descriptions of scenery\r\nthat are so frequently met with in novels and books of travel?\r\n\r\n9. _Comparison with reality_.--What difference do you perceive\r\nbetween a very vivid mental picture called up in the dark, and a\r\nreal scene? Have you ever mistaken a mental image for a reality when\r\nin health and wide awake?\r\n\r\n10. _Numerals and dates_.--Are these invariably associated in your\r\nmind with any peculiar mental imagery, whether of written or printed\r\nfigures, diagrams, or colours? If so, explain fully, and say if you\r\ncan account for the association?\r\n\r\n11.--_Specialities_.--If you happen to have special aptitudes for\r\nmechanics, mathematics (either geometry of three dimensions or pure\r\nanalysis), mental arithmetic, or chess-playing blindfold, please\r\nexplain fully how far your processes depend on the use of visual\r\nimages, and how far otherwise?\r\n\r\n12. Call up before your imagination the objects specified in the six\r\nfollowing paragraphs, numbered A to F, and consider carefully\r\nwhether your mental representation of them generally, is in each\r\ngroup very faint, faint, fair, good, or vivid and comparable to the\r\nactual sensation:--\r\n\r\n  A. _Light and colour_.--An evenly clouded sky (omitting all landscape),\r\n   first bright, then gloomy. A thick surrounding haze, first white,\r\n   then successively blue, yellow, green, and red.\r\n\r\n  B. _Sound_.--The beat of rain against the window panes, the crack of\r\n   a whip, a church bell, the hum of bees, the whistle of a railway,\r\n   the clinking of tea-spoons and saucers, the slam of a door.\r\n\r\n  C. _Smells_.--Tar, roses, an oil-lamp blown out, hay, violets, a fur\r\n   coat, gas, tobacco.\r\n\r\n  D. _Tastes_.--Salt,  sugar, lemon juice,   raisins,  chocolate,\r\n   currant jelly.\r\n\r\n  E. _Touch_.--Velvet, silk, soap, gum, sand, dough, a crisp dead leaf,\r\n   the prick of a pin.\r\n\r\n  F. _Other sensations_.--Heat, hunger, cold, thirst, fatigue, fever,\r\n   drowsiness, a bad cold.\r\n\r\n13. _Music_.--Have you any aptitude for mentally recalling music, or\r\nfor imagining it?\r\n\r\n14. _At different ages_.--Do you recollect what your powers of\r\nvisualising, etc., were in childhood? Have they varied much within\r\nyour recollection?\r\n\r\n_General remarks_.--Supplementary information written here, or on\r\na separate piece of paper, will be acceptable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n  _For an analysis of the several chapters, see Table of Contents._\r\n\r\nAbbadie, A. d'\r\nAborigines\r\nAbout, E.\r\nAbstract ideas,\r\n  like composite portraits;\r\n  are formed with difficulty\r\nAdmiralty, records of lives of sailors\r\nAdoption\r\nAfrica,\r\n  oxen;\r\n  captive animals;\r\n  races of men\r\n_Alert_, H.M.S.,\r\n  the crew of\r\nAlexander the Great,\r\n  medals of;\r\n  his help to Aristotle\r\nAmerica,\r\n  captive animals;\r\n  change of population\r\nAnimals and birds,\r\n  their attachments and aversions\r\nANTECHAMBER OF CONSCIOUSNESS\r\nANTHROPOMETRIC REGISTERS;\r\n  anthropometric committee;\r\n  laboratories\r\nAppold, Mr.\r\nArabs,\r\n  their migrations\r\nAshurakbal,\r\n  his menagerie\r\nASSOCIATIONS\r\n  (_see also_ Psychometric experiments)\r\nAssyria,\r\n  captive animals\r\nAthletic feats in present and past generations\r\nAugive, or ogive\r\nAustin, A.L.\r\nAustralia,\r\n  tame kites;\r\n  change of population\r\nAutomatic thought\r\nAversion\r\n\r\nBarclay, Capt.,\r\n  of Uri\r\nBarrel\r\nBarth, Dr.\r\nBates, W.H.\r\nBaume, Dr.\r\nBelief (_ie_ Faith)\r\nBevington, Miss L.\r\nBible, family\r\nBidder, G.\r\nBlackburne, Mr.\r\nBlake, the artist\r\nBleuler and Lehman\r\nBlind, the\r\nBlood, terror at\r\nBODILY QUALITIES\r\nBoisbaudran, Lecoq de\r\nBreaking out (violent passion)\r\nBrierre de Boismont\r\nBruhl, Prof.\r\nBurton, Capt.\r\nBushmen,\r\n  their skill in drawing;\r\n  in Damara Land\r\n\r\nCampbell, J.
