The explorations of these\r\nsixteen years have added eighty-nine species of trees and many recently\r\ndistinguished varieties of formerly imperfectly understood species to\r\nthe silva of the United States, and made available much additional\r\ninformation in regard to the geographical distribution of American\r\ntrees. Further studies have made the reduction of seven species of the\r\nfirst edition to varieties of other species seem desirable; and two\r\nspecies, _Amelanchier obovalis_ and _Cercocarpus parvifolius_, which\r\nwere formerly considered trees, but are more properly shrubs, are\r\nomitted. The genus Anamomis is now united with Eugenia; and the Arizona\r\n_Pinus strobiformis_ Sarg. (not Engelm.) is now referred to _Pinus\r\nflexilis_ James.\r\n\r\nRepresentatives of four Families and sixteen Genera which did not appear\r\nin the first edition are described in the new edition in which will be\r\nfound an account of seven hundred and seventeen species of trees in one\r\nhundred and eighty-five genera, illustrated by seven hundred and\r\neighty-three figures, or one hundred and forty-one figures in addition\r\nto those which appeared in the first edition.\r\n\r\nAn International Congress of Botanists which assembled in Vienna in\r\n1905, and again in Brussels in 1910, adopted rules of nomenclature which\r\nthe world, with a few American exceptions, has now generally adopted.\r\nThe names used in this new _Manual_ are based on the rules of this\r\nInternational Congress. These are the names used by the largest number\r\nof the students of plants, and it is unfortunate that the confusion in\r\nthe names of American trees must continue as long as the Department of\r\nAgriculture, including the Forest Service of the United States, uses\r\nanother and now generally unrecognized system.\r\n\r\nThe new illustrations in this edition are partly from drawings made by\r\nCharles Edward Faxon, who died before his work was finished; it was\r\ncontinued by the skillful pencil of Mary W. Gill, of Washington, to whom\r\nI am grateful for her intelligent coöperation.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to name here all the men and women who have in the last\r\nsixteen years contributed to this account of American trees, and I will\r\nnow only mention Mr. T. G. Harbison and Mr. E. J. Palmer, who as agents\r\nof the Arboretum have studied for years the trees of the Southeastern\r\nStates and of the Missouri-Texas region, Professor R. S. Cocks, of\r\nTulane University, who has explored carefully and critically the forests\r\nof Louisiana, and Miss Alice Eastwood, head of the Botanical Department\r\nof the California Academy of Sciences, who has made special journeys in\r\nAlaska and New Mexico in the interest of this _Manual_. Mr. Alfred\r\nRehder, Curator of the Herbarium of the Arboretum, has added to the\r\nknowledge of our trees in several Southern journeys; and to him I am\r\nspecially indebted for assistance and advice in the preparation of the\r\nkeys to the different groups of plants found in this volume.\r\n\r\nThis new edition of the _Manual_ contains the results of forty-four\r\nyears of my continuous study of the trees of North America carried on in\r\nevery part of the United States and in many foreign countries. If these\r\nstudies in any way serve to increase the knowledge and the love of trees\r\nI shall feel that these years have not been misspent.\r\n\r\n                                                          C. S. Sargent.\r\nArnold Arboretum\r\n   September, 1921\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                PREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn this volume I have tried to bring into convenient form for the use of\r\nstudents the information concerning the trees of North America which has\r\nbeen gathered at the Arnold Arboretum during the last thirty years and\r\nhas been largely elaborated in my _Silva of North America_.\r\n\r\nThe indigenous trees of no other region of equal extent are, perhaps, so\r\nwell known as those that grow naturally in North America. There is,\r\nhowever, still much to be learned about them. In the southern states,\r\none of the most remarkable extratropical regions in the world in the\r\nrichness of its arborescent flora, several species are still imperfectly\r\nknown, while it is not improbable that a few may have escaped entirely\r\nthe notice of botanists; and in the northern states are several forms of\r\nCratægus which, in the absence of sufficient information, it has been\r\nfound impracticable to include in this volume. Little is known as yet of\r\nthe silvicultural value and requirements of North American trees, or of\r\nthe diseases that affect them; and one of the objects of this volume is\r\nto stimulate further investigation of their characters and needs.\r\n\r\nThe arrangement of families and genera adopted in this volume is that of\r\nEngler & Prantl’s _Die Natürlichen Pflanzenfamilien_, in which the\r\nprocession is from a simpler to a more complex structure. The\r\nnomenclature is that of _The Silva of North America_. Descriptions of a\r\nfew species of Cratægus are now first published, and investigations made\r\nsince the publication of the last volume of _The Silva of North\r\nAmerica_, in December, 1902, have necessitated the introduction of a few\r\nadditional trees described by other authors, and occasional changes of\r\nnames.\r\n\r\nAn analytical key to the families, based on the arrangement and\r\ncharacter of the leaves, will lead the reader first to the family to\r\nwhich any tree belongs; a conspectus of the genera, embodying the\r\nimportant and easily discovered contrasting characters of each genus and\r\nfollowing the description of each family represented by more than one\r\ngenus, will lead him to the genus he is trying to determine; and a\r\nsimilar conspectus of the species, following the description of the\r\ngenus, will finally bring him to the species for which he is looking.\r\nFurther to facilitate the determination, one or more letters, attached\r\nto the name of the species in the conspectus following the description\r\nof the genus, indicate in which of the eight regions into which the\r\ncountry is divided according to the prevailing character of the\r\narborescent vegetation that species grows (see map forming frontispiece\r\nof the volume). For example, the northeastern part of the country,\r\nincluding the high Appalachian Mountains in the southern states which\r\nhave chiefly a northern flora, is represented by (A), and a person\r\nwishing to learn the name of a Pine-tree or of an Oak in that region\r\nneed occupy himself only with those species which in the conspectus of\r\nthe genus Quercus or Pinus are followed by the letter (A), while a\r\nperson wishing to determine an Oak or a Pine-tree in Oregon or\r\nCalifornia may pass over all species which are not followed by (G), the\r\nletter which represents the Pacific coast region south of the state of\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nThe sign of degrees (°) is used in this work to represent feet, and the\r\nsign of minutes (′) inches.\r\n\r\nThe illustrations which accompany each species and important variety are\r\none half the size of nature, except in the case of a few of the large\r\nPine cones, the flowers of some of the Magnolias, and the leaves and\r\nflower-clusters of the Palms. These are represented as less than half\r\nthe size of nature in order to make the illustrations of uniform size.\r\nThese illustrations are from drawings by Mr. Faxon, in which he has\r\nshown his usual skill and experience as a botanical draftsman in\r\nbringing out the most important characters of each species, and in them\r\nwill be found the chief value of this Manual. For aid in its preparation\r\nI am indebted to him and to my other associates, Mr. Alfred Rehder and\r\nMr. George R. Shaw, who have helped me in compiling the most difficult\r\nof the keys.\r\n\r\n                                                          C. S.

Salix.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                         1. POPULUS L. Poplar.\r\n\r\n\r\nLarge fast-growing trees, with pale furrowed bark, terete or angled\r\nbranchlets, resinous winter-buds covered by several thin scales, those\r\nof the first pair small and opposite, the others imbricated, increasing\r\nin size from below upward, accrescent and marking the base of the\r\nbranchlet with persistent ring-like scars, and thick roots. Leaves\r\ninvolute in the bud, usually ovate or ovate-lanceolate, entire, dentate\r\nwith usually glandular teeth, or lobed, penniveined, turning yellow in\r\nthe autumn; petioles long, often laterally compressed, sometimes\r\nfurnished at the apex on the upper side with 2 nectariferous glands,\r\nleaving in falling oblong often obcordate, elliptic, arcuate, or\r\nshield-shaped leaf-scars displaying the ends of 3 nearly equidistant\r\nfibro-vascular bundles; stipules caducous, those of the first leaves\r\nresembling the bud-scales, smaller higher on the branch, and\r\nlinear-lanceolate and scarious on the last leaves. Flowers in pendulous\r\nstalked aments, the pistillate lengthening and rarely becoming erect\r\nbefore maturity; scales obovate, gradually narrowed into slender stipes,\r\ndilated and lobed, palmately cleft or fimbriate at apex, membranaceous,\r\nglabrous or villose, more crowded on the staminate than on the\r\npistillate ament, usually caducous; disk of the flower broadly\r\ncup-shaped, often oblique, entire, dentate or irregularly lobed, fleshy\r\nor membranaceous, stipitate, usually persistent under the fruit; stamens\r\n4—12 or 12—60 or more, inserted on the disk, their filaments free,\r\nshort, light yellow; anthers ovoid or oblong, purple or red; ovary\r\nsessile in the bottom of the disk, oblong-conical subglobose or\r\novoid-oblong, cylindric or slightly lobed, with 2 or 3 or rarely 4\r\nplacentas; styles usually short; stigmas as many as the placentas,\r\ndivided into filiform lobes or broad, dilated, 2-parted or lobed. Fruit\r\nripening before the full growth of the leaves, greenish, reddish brown,\r\nor buff color, oblong-conic, subglobose or ovoid-oblong, separating at\r\nmaturity into 2—4 recurved valves. Seeds broadly obovoid or ovoid,\r\nrounded or acute at the apex, light chestnut-brown; cotyledons elliptic.\r\n\r\nPopulus in the extreme north often forms great forests, and is common on\r\nthe alluvial bottom-lands of streams and on high mountain slopes,\r\nranging from the Arctic Circle to northern Mexico and Lower California\r\nand from the Atlantic to the Pacific in the New World, and to northern\r\nAfrica, the southern slopes of the Himalayas, central China, and Japan\r\nin the Old World. Of the thirty-four species now generally recognized\r\nfifteen are found in North America. The wood of many of the American\r\nspecies is employed in large quantities for paper-making, and several\r\nspecies furnish wood used in construction and in the manufacture of\r\nsmall articles of wooden ware. The bark contains tannic acid and is used\r\nin tanning leather and occasionally as a tonic, and the fragrant balsam\r\ncontained in the buds of some species is occasionally used in medicine.\r\nThe rapidity of their growth, their hardiness and the ease with which\r\nthey can be propagated by cuttings, make many of the species useful as\r\nornamental trees or in wind-breaks, although planted trees often suffer\r\nseverely from the attacks of insects boring into the trunks and\r\nbranches. Of the exotic species, the Abele, or White Poplar, _Populus\r\nalba_ L., of Europe and western Asia, and its fastigiate form, and the\r\nso-called Lombardy Poplar, a tree of pyramidal habit and a form of the\r\nEuropean and Asiatic _Populus nigra_ L., and one of its hybrids, have\r\nbeen largely planted in the United States.\r\n\r\n_Populus_, of obscure derivation, is the classical name of the Poplar.\r\n\r\n\r\n               CONSPECTUS OF THE NORTH AMERICAN SPECIES.\r\n\r\n  Stigmas 2, 2-lobed, their lobes filiform; leaf stalks elongated,\r\n        laterally compressed; buds slightly resinous.\r\n    Leaves finely serrate; winter-buds glabrous.\r\n                                         1.

Leaves\r\nconvolute in the bud, ovate, acute, coarsely serrate, except at the\r\nbase, with thin veins running to the points of the slender glandular\r\nteeth, deciduous; petioles leaving in falling small elevated semioval\r\nleaf-scars marked by an irregular marginal row of minute fibro-vascular\r\nbundle-scars; stipules ovate to linear-lanceolate, acute, scarious,\r\ninfolding the leaf in the bud, caducous. Flowers opening in early\r\nsummer, unisexual, strong-smelling; the staminate, in 3—7-flowered\r\ncymes, in the axils of minute ovate bracts, in elongated simple\r\ndeciduous aments first appearing with the unfolding of the leaves from\r\nthe inner scales of the terminal bud and from the axils of the lower\r\nleaves of the year, composed of a pale straw-colored slightly puberulous\r\ncalyx deeply divided into 6 ovate rounded segments imbricated in the\r\nbud, and 10—20 stamens inserted on the slightly thickened torus, with\r\nfiliform filaments incurved in the bud, becoming elongated and exserted,\r\nand ovoid or globose pale yellow anthers; the pistillate scattered or\r\nspicate at the base of the shorter persistent androgynous aments from\r\nthe axils of later leaves, sessile, 2 or 3 together or solitary within a\r\nshort-stemmed or sessile involucre of closely imbricated oblong acute\r\nbright green bracts scurfy-pubescent or tomentose below the middle,\r\nsubtended by a bract and 2 lateral bractlets, each flower composed of an\r\nurn-shaped calyx, with a short limb divided into 6 obtuse lobes, minute\r\nsterile stamens shorter than the calyx-lobes, an ovary 6-celled after\r\nfecundation, with 6 linear spreading white styles hairy below the middle\r\nand tipped by minute acute stigmas, and 2 ovules in each cell, attached\r\non its inner angle, descending, semianatropous. Fruit maturing in one\r\nseason, its involucre inclosing 1—3 nuts, globose or short-oblong,\r\npubescent or tomentose and spiny on the outer surface, with elongated\r\nridged bright green ultimately brown branched spines fascicled between\r\nthe deciduous scales, coated on the inner surface with lustrous\r\npubescence, splitting at maturity into 2—4 valves; nut ovoid, acute,\r\ncrowned by the remnants of the style, bright chestnut-brown and\r\nlustrous, tomentose or pubescent at apex, cylindrical, or when more than\r\n1 flattened, marked at the broad base by a large conspicuous pale\r\ncircular or oval thickened scar, its shell lined with rufous or hoary\r\ntomentum. Seed usually solitary by abortion, dark chestnut-brown, marked\r\nat apex by the abortive ovules, with thick and fleshy more or less\r\nundulate ruminate sweet farinaceous cotyledons.\r\n\r\nCastanea is confined to the northern hemisphere, and is widely\r\ndistributed through eastern North America, southern Europe, northern\r\nAfrica, southwestern Asia, and central and northern China, Korea, and\r\nJapan. Seven species are distinguished. In the countries of the\r\nMediterranean Basin much attention has been given to improving the fruit\r\nof the native species _Castanea sativa_ Mill., which is occasionally\r\nplanted in the middle United States; in Japan the seeds of _Castanea\r\ncrenata_ S. & Zucc. in many varieties and in China those of _Castanea\r\nmollissima_ Bl. are important articles of food. Castanea produces\r\ncoarse-grained wood very durable in contact with the soil, and rich in\r\ntannin. Chestnut-trees suffer in the eastern United States from the\r\nattacks of a fungus, _Endothia parasitica_ Anders. which has nearly\r\nexterminated them in many parts of the country.\r\n\r\n_Castanea_ is the classical name of the Chestnut-tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n               CONSPECTUS OF THE NORTH AMERICAN SPECIES.\r\n\r\n  Involucre of the fruit containing 2 or 3 flattened nuts.\r\n                                                   1.

Winter-buds clustered at the ends of the\r\nbranchlets, with numerous membranaceous chestnut-brown slightly\r\naccrescent caducous scales closely imbricated in 5 ranks, in falling\r\nmarking the base of the branchlet with ring-like scars. Leaves 5-ranked,\r\nlobed, dentate or entire, often variable on the same branch,\r\nmembranaceous or coriaceous, the primary veins prominent and extending\r\nto the margins or united within them and connected by more or less\r\nreticulate veinlets, deciduous in the autumn or persistent until spring\r\nor until their third or fourth year; petioles in falling leaving\r\nslightly elevated semiorbicular more or less obcordate leaf-scars\r\nbroader than high, marked by the ends of numerous scattered\r\nfibro-vascular bundles; stipules obovate to lanceolate, scarious,\r\ncaducous, or those of upper leaves occasionally persistent through the\r\nseason. Flowers vernal with or after the unfolding of the leaves;\r\nstaminate solitary in the axils of lanceolate acute caducous bracts, or\r\nwithout bracts, in graceful pendulous clustered aments, from separate or\r\nleaf-buds in the axils of leaves of the previous year, or from the axils\r\nof the inner scales of the terminal bud or from those of the leaves of\r\nthe year; calyx campanulate, lobed or divided to the base into 4—7,\r\nusually 6, membranaceous lobes; stamens 4—6, rarely 2, or 10—12,\r\ninserted on the slightly thickened torus, with free filiform exserted\r\nfilaments and ovate-oblong or subglobose glabrous or rarely hairy\r\n2-celled usually yellow anthers; pistillate solitary, subtended by a\r\ncaducous bract and 2 bractlets, in short or elongated few-flowered\r\nspikes from the axils of leaves of the year; calyx urn-shaped, with a\r\nshort campanulate 6-lobed limb, the tube adnate to the incompletely 3 or\r\nrarely 4 or 5-celled ovary inclosed more or less completely by an\r\naccrescent involucre of imbricated scales, becoming the cup of the\r\nfruit; styles as many as the cells of the ovary, short or elongated,\r\nerect or incurved, dilated above, stigmatic on the inner face or at apex\r\nonly, generally persistent on the fruit; ovules anatropous or\r\nsemianatropous, 2 in each cell. Fruit a nut (_acorn_) maturing in one or\r\nin two years, ovoid, subglobose, or turbinate, short-pointed at apex,\r\n1-seeded by abortion, marked at base by a large conspicuous circular\r\nscar, with a thick shell, glabrous or coated on the inner surface with\r\npale tomentum, more or less surrounded or inclosed in the accrescent\r\ncupular involucre of the flower (_cup_), its scales thin or thickened,\r\nloosely or closely imbricated. Seed marked at base or at apex or rarely\r\non the side by the abortive ovules; cotyledons thick and fleshy, usually\r\nplano-convex and entire.\r\n\r\nQuercus inhabits the temperate regions of the northern hemisphere and\r\nhigh altitudes within the tropics, ranging in the New World southward to\r\nthe mountains of Colombia and in the Old World to the Indian\r\nArchipelago. Two hundred and seventy-five species have been described;\r\nof the North American species fifty-four are large or small trees. Of\r\nexotic species, the European _Quercus Robur_ L., and _Quercus\r\nsessiliflora_ Salisb., have been frequently cultivated as ornamental\r\ntrees in the eastern United States, where, however, they are usually\r\nshort-lived and unsatisfactory. Many of the species are important\r\ntimber-trees; their bark is often rich in tannin and is used for tanning\r\nleather, and all produce wood valuable for fuel and in the manufacture\r\nof charcoal.\r\n\r\n_Quercus_ is the classical name of the Oak-tree.\r\n\r\n\r\n         CONSPECTUS OF THE NORTH AMERICAN ARBORESCENT SPECIES.\r\n\r\n  Fruit maturing at the end of the second season (except 22); shell of\r\n        the nut silky tomentose on the inner surface; leaves or their\r\n        lobes bristle-tipped.

Flowers polygamo-monœcious or rarely monœcious, appearing\r\nsoon after the unfolding of the leaves, minute, pedicellate, on branches\r\nof the year, the staminate cymose or fascicled at their base, the\r\npistillate solitary or in few-flowered fascicles from the axils of upper\r\nleaves; calyx divided nearly to the base into 4 or 5 lobes, greenish\r\nyellow, deciduous; stamens inserted on the margin of the discoid torus;\r\nfilaments subulate, incurved in the bud, those of the sterile flower\r\nstraightening themselves abruptly and becoming erect and exserted,\r\nshorter and remaining incurved in the perfect flower; anthers ovoid,\r\nattached on the back just above the emarginate base; ovary ovoid,\r\nsessile, green and lustrous, crowned with a short sessile style divided\r\ninto diverging elongated reflexed acuminate entire lobes\r\npapillo-stigmatic on the inner face and mature before the anthers of the\r\nsterile flower, deciduous; minute and rudimentary in the staminate\r\nflower; ovule anatropous. Fruit an ovoid or globose drupe tipped with\r\nthe remnants of the style, with thin flesh covered by a thick firm skin,\r\nand a thick-walled bony nutlet, reticulate-pitted in the American\r\nspecies. Seed filling the seminal cavity; albumen scanty, gelatinous,\r\nnearly inclosed between the folds of the cotyledons, or 0; testa\r\nmembranaceous, of 2 confluent coats; chalaza colored, close to the\r\nminute hilum; embryo curved; cotyledons broad, foliaceous, conduplicate\r\nor rarely flat, variously folded, corrugate, incumbent, or inclosing the\r\nshort superior ascending radicle.\r\n\r\nCeltis is widely distributed through the temperate and tropical regions\r\nof the world, fifty or sixty species being distinguished.\r\n\r\nTrees of the American species are often disfigured by gall-making\r\ninsects which distort the buds and cause the production of dark\r\nbroom-like clusters of short slender branchlets at the end of the\r\nbranches.\r\n\r\n_Celtis_ was the classical name of a species of Lotus.\r\n\r\n\r\n               CONSPECTUS OF THE NORTH AMERICAN SPECIES.\r\n\r\n  Fruit on pedicels much longer than the petioles.\r\n    Leaves not covered below with conspicuous reticulate veinlets, green\r\n          on both surfaces, smooth or rough above; fruit dark purple.\r\n                                                     1.

Leaves conduplicate in the bud, simple,\r\ngenerally serrate, sometimes 3-nerved, often more or less lobed,\r\nespecially on vigorous leading branchlets, membranaceous to coriaceous,\r\npetiolate, deciduous; stipules often glandular-serrate, linear,\r\nacuminate, frequently bright-colored, deciduous, or on vigorous\r\nbranchlets often foliaceous, coarsely serrate, usually lunate and\r\nstalked and mostly persistent until autumn. Flowers pedicellate, in few\r\nor many-flowered simple or compound cymose corymbs terminal on short\r\nlateral leafy branchlets, with linear usually bright-colored often\r\nglandular caducous bracts and bractlets leaving prominent gland-like\r\nscars, the lower branches of compound corymbs usually from the axils of\r\nupper leaves; branches of the inflorescence mostly 3-flowered, the\r\ncentral flower opening before the others; calyx-tube usually obconic,\r\n5-lobed, the lobes acute or acuminate and usually gland-tipped, rarely\r\nfoliaceous, glandular-serrate or entire, green or reddish toward the\r\napex, reflexed after the flowers open, persistent and often enlarged on\r\nthe fruit, or deciduous; disk thin or fleshy, entire, lobed or slightly\r\nsulcate, concave or somewhat convex; petals imbricated in the bud,\r\norbicular, entire or somewhat erose or rarely toothed at apex, white or\r\nrarely rose color, spreading, soon deciduous; stamens often variable in\r\nnumber in the same species by imperfect development, but normally 5 in 1\r\nrow and alternate with the petals, or 10 in 5 pairs in 1 row alternate\r\nwith the petals, or 15 in 2 rows, those of the outer row in 5 pairs\r\nopposite the sepals and alternate with and rather longer than those of\r\nthe inner row, or 20 in 3 rows, those of the inner row shorter and\r\nalternate with those of the 2d row, or 25 in 4 rows, those of the 4th\r\nrow alternate with those of the 3d row; filaments broad at base,\r\nsubulate, incurved, often persistent on the fruit; anthers pale yellow\r\nto nearly white, or pink to light or dark rose color or purple; ovary\r\ncomposed of 1—5 carpels inserted in the bottom of the calyx-tube and\r\nunited with it; styles free, with dilated truncate stigmas, persistent\r\non the mature carpels; ovules ascending; raphe dorsal; micropyle\r\ninferior. Fruit subglobose, ovoid or short-oblong, scarlet,\r\norange-colored, red, yellow, blue, or black, generally open and concave\r\nat apex; flesh usually dry and mealy; nutlets 1—5; united below, more or\r\nless free and slightly spreading above the middle, thick-walled,\r\nrounded, acute, or acuminate at apex, full and rounded or narrowed at\r\nbase, rounded or conspicuously ridged and grooved on the back,\r\nflattened, or nearly round when only 1, their ventral faces plane or\r\nplano-convex, in some species penetrated by longitudinal cavities or\r\nhollows, and marked by a more or less conspicuous hypostyle sometimes\r\nextending to below the middle or nearly to the base of the nutlet. Seed\r\nsolitary by abortion, erect, compressed, acute, with a membranaceous\r\nlight chestnut-brown coat; embryo filling the cavity of the seed;\r\ncotyledons plano-convex, radicle short, inferior.\r\n\r\nCratægus is most abundant in eastern North America, where it is\r\ndistributed from Newfoundland to the mountains of northern Mexico, and\r\nis represented by a large number of arborescent and shrubby species. A\r\nfew species occur in the Rocky Mountains and Pacific-coast regions, and\r\nin China, Japan, Siberia, central and southwestern Asia, and in Europe.\r\nThe genus is still very imperfectly known in North America, and in the\r\nabsence of sufficient information concerning them several arborescent\r\nspecies are necessarily excluded from the following enumeration. The\r\nbeautiful and abundant flowers and showy fruits make many of the species\r\ndesirable ornaments of parks and gardens, and several are cultivated. Of\r\nexotic species, the Old World _Cratægus Oxyacantha_ L., and _C.\r\nmonogyna_ Jacq., early introduced into the United States as hedge\r\nplants, have now become naturalized in many places in the northeastern\r\nand middle states. Cratægus produces heavy hard tough close-grained\r\nred-brown heartwood and thick lighter colored usually pale sapwood;\r\nuseful for the handles of tools, mallets, and other small articles.\r\n\r\nThe number of the stamens, although it differs on the same species\r\nwithin certain usually constant limits, and the color of the anthers,\r\nwhich appears to be specifically constant with one exception, afford the\r\nmost satisfactory characters for distinguishing the species in the\r\ndifferent groups.\r\n\r\n_Cratægus_, from κράτος, is in reference to the strength of the wood of\r\nthese trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n   CONSPECTUS OF THE NATURAL GROUPS OF THE NORTH AMERICAN ARBORESCENT\r\n                                SPECIES.\r\n\r\n  1.

Linden.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrees, with terete moderately stout branchlets, without a terminal bud,\r\nlarge compressed acute axillary buds, with numerous imbricated scales,\r\nthose of the inner rank accrescent, mucilaginous juice, and tough\r\nfibrous inner bark. Leaves conduplicate in the bud, long-petiolate,\r\n2-ranked, cordate or truncate at the oblique base, acute or acuminate,\r\nserrate, deciduous, their petioles in falling leaving large elevated\r\nhorizontal leaf-scars displaying the ends of numerous fibro-vascular\r\nbundles; stipules ligulate, membranaceous, caducous. Flowers\r\nnectariferous, fragrant, on slender clavate pedicels, in axillary or\r\nterminal cymes, with minute caducous bracts at the base of the branches,\r\ntheir peduncle more or less connate with the axis of a large\r\nmembranaceous light green ligulate often obovate persistent\r\nconspicuously reticulate-veined bract; sepals 5, distinct; petals 5,\r\nimbricated in the bud, alternate with the sepals, sometimes thickened\r\nand glandular at the narrow base, creamy white or yellow, deciduous;\r\nstamens inserted on a short hypogynous receptacle; filaments filiform,\r\nforked near the apex, collected into 5 clusters and united at base with\r\neach other and (in the American species) with a spatulate petaloid scale\r\n(_staminodium_) placed opposite each petal, the branches of the filament\r\nbearing oblong extrorse half anthers; ovary sessile, tomentose,\r\n5-celled, the cells opposite the sepals; style erect, dilated at apex\r\ninto 5 spreading stigmatic lobes; ovules 2 in each cell, ascending from\r\nthe middle of its inner angle, semianatropous, the micropyle\r\ncentripetal-inferior. Fruit nut-like, woody, subglobose to short-oblong\r\nor ovoid, sometimes ribbed, tomentose, 1-celled by the obliteration of\r\nthe partitions, 1 or 2-seeded. Seeds obovoid, amphitropous, ascending;\r\nseed-coat cartilaginous, light reddish brown; embryo large, often\r\ncurved, in fleshy albumen; cotyledons reniform or cordate, palmately\r\n5-lobed, the margins irregularly involute or crumpled; radicle inferior.\r\n\r\nTilia with some thirty species is widely distributed in the temperate\r\nregions of the northern hemisphere with the exception of western\r\nAmerica, central Asia, and the Himalayas. Tilia produces soft\r\nstraight-grained pale-colored light wood, largely used for the interior\r\nfinish of buildings, in cabinet-making, for the sounding-boards of\r\npianos, wood-carving and wooden ware, and in the manufacture of paper.\r\nThe tough inner bark is largely manufactured into mats, cords,\r\nfish-nets, coarse cloths, and shoes. Lime-flower oil, obtained by\r\ndistilling the flowers of the European species, is used in perfumery.\r\nThe flowers yield large quantities of nectar, and honey made near\r\nforests of Tilia is unsurpassed in flavor and delicacy. Many of the\r\nspecies are planted as shade and ornamental trees, and some of the\r\nEuropean species are now common in the gardens and parks of the eastern\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n\r\n            CONSPECTUS OF THE SPECIES OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n  Surface of the leaves glabrous at maturity.\r\n    Leaves glabrous or almost glabrous when they unfold, coarsely\r\n          serrate.\r\n      Leaves furnished with conspicuous tufts of axillary hairs, their\r\n            lower surface light green and lustrous; pedicels glabrous or\r\n            nearly glabrous.\r\n                                                       1.

Leaves ovate or elliptic, glabrous, petiolate; stipules\r\nelongated, acuminate, infolding the bud, caducous. Flowers perfect,\r\nyellow or creamy white, sessile or pedicellate, bibracteolate, the\r\nbractlets united into an involucral cup, in pedunculate dichotomously or\r\ntrichotomously branched clusters, the base of their branches surrounded\r\nby an involucre of 2 ovate 3-lobed persistent bracts, or 1-flowered;\r\ncalyx 4-lobed, the lobes acute, coriaceous, ribbed on the inner surface\r\nand thickened on the margins, two or three times longer than the\r\nturbinate globose tube, reflexed at maturity, persistent; petals 4,\r\ninduplicate in the bud, alternate with and longer than the calyx-lobes,\r\ninserted on a fleshy disk-like ring in the mouth of the calyx-tube,\r\ninvolute on the margins, coated on the inner surface with long pale\r\nhairs, or flat and naked, caducous; stamens 8—12; filaments short or 0;\r\nanthers attached at the base, introrse, elongated, connivent, areolate;\r\novary partly inferior, conic, 2-celled, contracted into two subulate\r\nspreading styles stigmatic at apex. Fruit a conic coriaceous berry\r\nsurrounded by the reflexed calyx-lobes and perforated at the apex by the\r\ngerminating embryo. Seed germinating in the fruit before falling, the\r\napex surrounded by a thin albuminous cup-like aril; seed-coat thick and\r\nfleshy; embryo surrounded by a thin layer of albumen; cotyledons dark\r\npurple; radicle elongated, clavate, and when fully grown separating from\r\nthe narrow exserted woody tube inclosing the plumule and developed from\r\nthe cotyledons after the ripening of the fruit.\r\n\r\nRhizophora with three species is widely and generally distributed on the\r\nshores of tidal marshes in the tropical regions of the two hemispheres,\r\none specie reaching those of southern Florida. It possesses astringent\r\nproperties; the bark has been used in tanning leather, in dyeing, and as\r\na febrifuge. The wood is hard, durable, and dark-colored. By means of\r\nthe aerial germination of its seeds and in its power to develop roots\r\nfrom trunks and branches, Rhizophora is especially adapted to maintain\r\nitself on low tidal shores and is an important factor in protecting and\r\nextending them into the ocean. Roots springing from the stems at a\r\nconsiderable distance above the ground and arching outward descend into\r\nthe water and fix themselves in the mud beneath, while roots growing\r\ndown from the branches enter the ground and gradually thicken into\r\nstems. The fully grown radicle ready to put forth roots and leaves, and\r\noften 10′—12′ long, is thicker and heavier at the root end than at the\r\nother, and in detaching itself from the cotyledons and in falling the\r\nheavy end sticks in the mud, while the plumule at the other end, held\r\nabove the shallow surface of the water, soon unfolds its leaves.\r\n\r\nThe generic name, from ῥίζα and φέρειν, was used by early authors to\r\ndesignate various climbing plants with thickened roots.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        1.

AVICENNIA L.\r\n\r\n\r\nTrees, with coriaceous persistent leaves, stout pithy branches thickened\r\nat the nodes and marked by interpetiolar lines, and long thick\r\nhorizontal roots producing numerous short vertical thick and fleshy\r\nleafless stems rising above the surface of the soil. Flowers opposite,\r\ncymose, in centripetal pedunculate spikes or heads, closely invested by\r\na bract and 2 bractlets, the peduncles solitary or in pairs in the axils\r\nof upper leaves and ternate on the end of the branches, their bracts and\r\nbractlets concave, acute, apiculate, keeled on the back, scarious,\r\nslightly ciliate on the margins, shorter than the corolla, persistent\r\nunder the fruit; calyx cup-shaped, coated like the bracts and bractlets\r\nwith canescent pubescence, divided nearly to the base into 5 concave\r\novate rounded lobes imbricated in the bud; corolla campanulate, white,\r\nwith a straight cylindric tube shorter than the glabrous or tomentose\r\nspreading 4-lobed limb, the posterior lobe usually larger than the\r\nothers; stamens exserted; filaments short, filiform, slightly thickened\r\nat base; anthers ovoid; ovary ovoid, pubescent, 1-celled, gradually\r\nnarrowed into an elongated slender style divided at apex into 2 lobes\r\nstigmatic on their inner face; ovules 4, suspended from the summit of a\r\nfree central placenta, orthotropous, naked.

Avicennia produces hard strong wood. The bark is\r\nrich in tannic acid, and is used for tanning leather. The chief value of\r\nthese trees is in their ability to live on low tidal shores by the\r\nstructure of the embryo, which is growing and ready to take root as soon\r\nas it falls into the soft mud, and in the long horizontal roots\r\nfurnished with short vertical fleshy leafless branches or aerating\r\nroots, forming a close network which holds the soil together and\r\nprevents it from being washed away by outflowing tides, and extends the\r\ngrowth of the tree by numerous stems which soon form dense thickets.\r\n\r\nThe generic name is in honor of the illustrious physician of the Orient,\r\nAvicenna of Bokhara (980—1036).\r\n\r\n\r\n               1.

Seeds filling the\r\ncavity of the nutlets, pale brown; cotyledons ovoid.\r\n\r\nSambucus with about twenty species is widely and generally distributed\r\nthrough the temperate parts of North America, Europe, and Asia, and\r\ninhabits high mountain ranges within the tropics, and in Australia,\r\nTasmania, and New Zealand. Of the nine or ten North American species\r\nthree are arborescent. Sambucus possesses cathartic and emetic\r\nproperties in the bark; the flowers are excitant and sudorific, and the\r\njuice of the fruit is alterative and laxative. The dried flowers of the\r\nEuropean _Sambucus nigra_ L., are used in the preparation of an aromatic\r\ndistilled water and in flavoring lard, and the hard and compact wood is\r\nmade into combs and mathematical instruments. The large pithy shoots of\r\nSambucus furnish children with pop-guns, pipes, and whistles; and the\r\nfruit of some of the species is cooked and eaten.\r\n\r\n_Sambucus_, the name of the Elder-tree, is believed to have been derived\r\nfrom σαµβύκη, a musical instrument, probably in allusion to the use of\r\nthe pithy stems.\r\n\r\n\r\n      CONSPECTUS OF THE ARBORESCENT SPECIES OF THE UNITED STATES.\r\n\r\n  Cymes flat-topped; pith usually white; fruit black; nutlets rugose.\r\n    Fruit lustrous.\r\n                                                    1.
