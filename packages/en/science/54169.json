In former classifications they headed the Class of\r\nBirds, being honored with this position in consequence of their powerful\r\norganization, large size, and predatory habits. But it being now known\r\nthat in structure they are less perfectly organized than the _Passeres_\r\nand _Strisores_, birds generally far more delicate in organization,\r\nas well as smaller in size, they occupy a place in the more recent\r\narrangements nearly at the end of the Terrestrial forms.\r\n\r\nThe complete definition of the order _Raptores_, and of its\r\nsubdivisions, requires the enumeration of a great many characters; and\r\nthat their distinguishing features may be more easily recognized by\r\nthe student, I give first a brief diagnosis, including their simplest\r\ncharacters, to be followed by a more detailed account hereafter.\r\n\r\nCOMMON CHARACTERS. Bill hooked, the upper mandible furnished at the base\r\nwith a soft skin, or “cere,” in which the nostrils are situated. Toes,\r\nthree before and one behind. _Raptores._\r\n\r\n  =Strigidæ.= Eyes directed forwards, and surrounded by radiating\r\n  feathers, which are bounded, except anteriorly, by a circle or rim of\r\n  differently formed, stiffer feathers. Outer toe reversible. Claws much\r\n  hooked and very sharp. Legs and toes usually feathered, or, at least,\r\n  coated with bristles. _The Owls._\r\n\r\n  =Falconidæ.= Eyes lateral, and not surrounded by radiating feathers.\r\n  Outer toe not reversible (except in _Pandion_). Claws usually hooked\r\n  and sharp, but variable. Head more or less completely feathered. _The\r\n  Hawks._\r\n\r\n  =Cathartidæ.= Eyes lateral; whole head naked. Outer toe not\r\n  reversible; claws slightly curved, blunt. _The Vultures._\r\n\r\nThe preceding characters, though purely artificial, may nevertheless\r\nserve to distinguish the three families of _Raptores_ belonging to\r\nthe North American _Ornis_; a more scientific diagnosis, embracing\r\na sufficient number of osteological, and accompanying anatomical\r\ncharacters, will be found further on.\r\n\r\nThe birds of prey—named _Accipitres_ by some authors, and _Raptores_\r\nor _Rapaces_ by others, and very appropriately designated as the\r\n_Ætomorphæ_ by Professor Huxley—form one of the most strongly\r\ncharacterized and sharply limited of the higher divisions of the Class\r\nof Birds. It is only recently, however, that their place in a systematic\r\nclassification and the proper number and relation of their subdivisions\r\nhave been properly understood. Professor Huxley’s views will probably\r\nform the basis for a permanent classification, as they certainly point\r\nthe way to one eminently natural. In his important paper entitled\r\n“On the Classification of Birds, and on the Taxonomic Value of the\r\nModifications of certain Cranial Bones observable in that Class,”[2]\r\nthis gentleman has dealt concisely upon the affinities of the order\r\n_Raptores_, and the distinguishing features of its subdivisions. In the\r\nfollowing diagnoses the osteological characters are mainly borrowed\r\nfrom Professor Huxley’s work referred to. Nitzsch’s “Pterylography”[3]\r\nsupplies such characters as are afforded by the plumage, most of which\r\nconfirm the arrangement based upon the osteological structure; while\r\nimportant suggestions have been derived from McGillivray’s “History of\r\nBritish Birds.”[4] The Monographs of the _Strigidæ_ and _Falconidæ_, by\r\nDr. J. J. Kaup,[5] contain much valuable information, and were they not\r\ndisfigured by a very eccentric system of arrangement they would approach\r\nnearer to a natural classification of the subfamilies, genera, and\r\nsubgenera, than any arrangement of the lesser groups which I have yet\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nThe species of this group are spread over the whole world, tropical\r\nregions having the greatest variety of forms and number of species.\r\nThe _Strigidæ_ are cosmopolitan, most of the genera belonging to both\r\ncontinents. The _Falconidæ_ are also found the world over, but each\r\ncontinent has subfamilies peculiar to it. The _Cathartidæ_ are peculiar\r\nto America, having analogous representatives in the Old World in the\r\nsubfamily _Vulturinæ_ belonging to the _Falconidæ_, The _Gypogeranidæ_\r\nare found only in South Africa, where a single species, _Gypogeranus\r\nserpentarius_ (GMEL.), sole representative of the family, is found.\r\n\r\nAs regards the comparative number of species of this order in the two\r\ncontinents, the Old World is considerably ahead of the New World, which\r\nmight be expected from its far greater land area. 581 species are given\r\nin Gray’s Hand List,[6] of which certainly not more than 500, probably\r\nnot more than 450, are valid species, the others ranking as geographical\r\nraces, or are synonymous with others; of this number about 350 nominal\r\nspecies are accredited to the Old World. America, however, possesses\r\nthe greatest variety of forms, and the great bulk of the Old World\r\nRaptorial fauna is made up chiefly by a large array of species of a few\r\ngenera which are represented in America by but one or two, or at most\r\nhalf a dozen, species. The genera _Aquila_, _Spizætus_, _Accipiter_,\r\n_Haliætus_, _Falco_, _Circus_, _Athene_, _Strix_, and _Buteo_, are\r\nstriking examples. As regards the number of peculiar forms, America is\r\nconsiderably ahead.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY STRIGIDÆ.—THE OWLS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAR. Eyes directed forward, and surrounded by a radiating system of\r\nfeathers, which is bounded, except anteriorly, by a ruff of stiff,\r\ncompactly webbed, differently formed, and somewhat recurved feathers;\r\nloral feathers antrorse, long, and dense. Plumage very soft and lax,\r\nof a fine downy texture, the feathers destitute of an after-shaft.\r\nOil-gland without the usual circlet of feathers. Outer webs of the\r\nquills with the points of the fibres recurved. Feathers on the sides\r\nof the forehead frequently elongated into ear-like tufts; tarsus\r\nusually, and toes frequently, densely feathered. Ear-opening very\r\nlarge, sometimes covered by a lappet. Œsophagus destitute of a dilated\r\ncrop; cœca large. Maxillo-palatines thick and spongy, and encroaching\r\nupon the intervening valley; basipterygoid processes always present.\r\nOuter toe reversible; posterior toe only about half as long as the\r\nouter. Posterior margin of the sternum doubly indented; clavicle weak\r\nand nearly cylindrical, about equal in length to the sternum. Anterior\r\nprocess of the coracoid projected forward so as to meet the clavicle,\r\nbeneath the basal process of the scapula. Eggs variable in shape,\r\nusually nearly spherical, always immaculate, pure white.\r\n\r\nThe Owls constitute a very natural and sharply limited family, and\r\nthough the species vary almost infinitely in the details of their\r\nstructure, they all seem to fall within the limits of a single\r\nsubfamily.\r\n\r\nThey have never yet been satisfactorily classified, and all the\r\narrangements which have been either proposed or adopted are refuted by\r\nthe facts developed upon a close study into the true relationship of\r\nthe many genera. The divisions of “Night Owls,” “Day Owls,” “Horned\r\nOwls,” etc., are purely artificial. This family is much more homogeneous\r\nthan that of the _Falconidæ_, since none of the many genera which I\r\nhave examined seem to depart in their structure from the model of\r\na single subfamily, though a few of them are somewhat aberrant as\r\nregards peculiarities in the detail of external form, or, less often,\r\nto a slight extent, in their osteological characters, though I have\r\nexamined critically only the American and European species; and there\r\nmay be some Asiatic, African, or Australian genera which depart so far\r\nfrom the normal standard of structure as to necessitate a modification\r\nof this view. In the structure of the sternum there is scarcely the\r\nleast noticeable deviation in any genus[7] from the typical form. The\r\nappreciable differences appear to be only of generic value, such as a\r\ndifferent proportionate length of the coracoid bones and the sternum,\r\nand width of the sternum in proportion to its length, or the height\r\nof its keel. The crania present a greater range of variation, and, if\r\nclosely studied, may afford a clew to a more natural arrangement than\r\nthe one which is here presented. The chief differences in the skulls of\r\ndifferent genera consist in the degree of pneumaticity of the bones,\r\nin the form of the auricular bones, the comparative length and breadth\r\nof the palatines, and very great contrasts in the contour. As a rule,\r\nwe find that those skulls which have the greatest pneumaticity (e.g.\r\n_Strix_ and _Otus_) are most depressed anteriorly, have the orbital\r\nseptum thicker, the palatines longer and narrower, and a deeper\r\nlongitudinal median valley on the superior surface, and _vice versa_.\r\n\r\nThe following classification is based chiefly upon external characters;\r\nbut these are in most instances known to be accompanied by osteological\r\npeculiarities, which point to nearly the same arrangement. It is\r\nintended merely as an artificial table of the North American genera,\r\nand may be subjected to considerable modification in its plan if exotic\r\ngenera are introduced.[8]\r\n\r\n\r\nGenera and Subgenera.\r\n\r\n  =A.= Inner toe equal to the middle in length; inner edge of middle\r\n  claw pectinated.

All the northern\r\ngenera (_Nyctea_, _Surnia_, _Nyctale_, and _Scotiaptex_), and the\r\nmajority of their species, are circumpolar. The genus _Glaucidium_ is\r\nmost largely developed within the tropics, and has numerous species\r\nin both hemispheres. _Otus brachyotus_ and _Strix flammea_ are the\r\nonly two species which are found all over the world,—the former,\r\nhowever, being apparently absent in Australia. _Gymnoglaux_, _Speotyto_,\r\n_Micrathene_, and _Lophostrix_ are about the only well-characterized\r\ngenera peculiar to America. _Athene_, _Ketupa_, and _Phodilus_ are\r\npeculiar to the Old World. The approximate number of known species\r\n(see Gray’s Hand List of Birds, I, 1869) is about two hundred, of\r\nwhich two, as stated, are cosmopolitan; six others (_Surnia ulula_,\r\n_Nyctea scandiaca_, _Glaucidium passerinum_, _Syrnium cinereum_, _Otus\r\nvulgaris_, and _Nyctale tengmalmi_) are found in both halves of the\r\nNorthern Hemisphere; of the remainder there are about an equal number\r\npeculiar to America and the Old World.\r\n\r\nAs regards the distribution of the Owls in the Nearctic Realm, a\r\nprominent feature is the number of the species (eighteen, not including\r\nraces) belonging to it, of which six (_Micrathene whitneyi_, _Nyctale\r\nacadica_, _Syrnium nebulosum_, _S. occidentale_, _Scops asio_, and\r\n_S. flammeola_) are found nowhere else. _Speotyto cunicularia_\r\nand _Bubo virginianus_ are peculiarly American species found both\r\nnorth and south of the equator, but in the two regions represented\r\nby different geographical races. _Glaucidium ferrugineum_ and _G.\r\ninfuscatum_ (var. _gnoma_) are tropical species which overreach\r\nthe bounds of the Neotropical Realm,—the former extending into the\r\nUnited States, the latter reaching to, and probably also within,\r\nour borders. Of the eighteen North American species, about nine, or\r\none half (_Strix flammea_ var. _pratincola_, _Otus brachyotus_, _O.\r\nvulgaris_ var. _wilsonianus_, _Syrnium cinereum_, _Nyctale acadica_,\r\n_Bubo virginianus_, and _Scops asio_, with certainty, and _Nyctea\r\nscandiaca_ var. _arctica_, and _Surnia ulula_ var. _hudsonia_, in\r\nall probability), are found entirely across the continent. _Nyctale\r\ntengmalmi_, var. _richardsoni_, and _Syrnium nebulosum_, appear to be\r\npeculiar to the eastern portion,—the former to the northern regions,\r\nthe latter to the southern. _Athene cunicularia_ var. _hypugaea_,\r\n_Micrathene whitneyi_, _Glaucidium passerinum_ var. _californicum_,\r\n_Syrnium occidentale_, and _Scops flammeola_, are exclusively western,\r\nall belonging to the southern portion of the Middle Province and Rocky\r\nMountain region, and the adjacent parts of Mexico, excepting the more\r\ngenerally distributed _Speotyto cunicularia_, var. _hypogæa_, before\r\nmentioned. Anomalies in regard to the distribution of some of the\r\nspecies common to both continents, are the restriction of the American\r\nrepresentative of _Glaucidium passerinum_ to the western regions,[9]\r\nand of _Strix flammea_ to the very southern and maritime portions of\r\nthe United States, the European representatives of both species being\r\ngenerally distributed throughout that continent. On the other hand, the\r\nnorthwest-coast race of our _Scops asio_ (_S. kennicotti_) seems to be\r\nnearly identical with the Japanese _S. semitorques_ (Schlegel), which is\r\nundoubtedly referrible to the same species.\r\n\r\nAs regards their plumage, the Owls differ most remarkably from the\r\nHawks in the fact that the sexes are invariably colored alike, while\r\nfrom the nest to perfect maturity there are no well-marked progressive\r\nstages distinguishing the different ages of a species. The nestling, or\r\ndowny, plumage, however, of many species, has the intricate pencilling\r\nof the adult dress replaced by a simple transverse barring upon the\r\nimperfect downy covering. The downy young of _Nyctea scandiaca_ is plain\r\nsooty-brown, and that of _Strix flammea_ immaculate white.\r\n\r\nIn many species the adult dress is characterized by a mottling of\r\nvarious shades of grayish mixed with ochraceous or fulvous, this\r\nornamented by a variable, often very intricate, pencilling of dusky, and\r\nmore or less mixed with white. As a consequence of the mixed or mottled\r\ncharacter of the markings, the plumage of the Owls is, as a rule,\r\ndifficult to describe.\r\n\r\nIn the variations of plumage, size, etc., with differences of habitat,\r\nthere is a wide range, the usually recognized laws[10] applying to most\r\nof those species which are generally distributed and resident where\r\nbreeding. Of the eight species common to the Palæarctic and Nearctic\r\nRealms, all but one (_Otus brachyotus_) are modified so as to form\r\nrepresentative geographical races on the two continents. In each of\r\nthese cases the American bird is much darker than the European, the\r\nbrown areas and markings being not only more extended, but deeper in\r\ntint. The difference in this respect is so tangible that an experienced\r\nornithologist can instantly decide to which continent any specimen\r\nbelongs. Of the two cosmopolitan species one, _Otus brachyotus_, is\r\nidentical throughout; the other is modified into geographical races in\r\nnearly every well-marked province of its habitat. Thus in the Palæarctic\r\nRealm it is typical _Strix flammea_; in the Nearctic Realm it is var.\r\n_pratincola_; while Tropical America has at least three well-marked\r\ngeographical races, the species being represented in Middle America\r\nby the var. _guatemalæ_, in South America by var. _perlata_, and in\r\nthe West Indies by the var. _furcata_. The Old World has also numerous\r\nrepresentative races, of which we have, however, seen only two, namely,\r\nvar. _javanica_ (Gm.), of Java, India, and Eastern Africa, and var.\r\n_delicatula_ (Gould) of Australia, both of which we unhesitatingly refer\r\nto _S. flammea_.[11]\r\n\r\nOn the North American continent the only widely distributed species\r\nwhich do not vary perceptibly with the region are _Otus brachyotus_ and\r\n_O. vulgaris_ (var. _wilsonianus_). _Bubo virginianus_, _Scops asio_,\r\nand _Syrnium nebulosum_ all bear the impress of special laws in the\r\nseveral regions of their habitat. Starting with the Eastern Province,\r\nand tracing either of these three species southward, we find it becoming\r\ngradually smaller, the colors deeper and more rufous, and the toes\r\nmore scantily feathered. _Scops asio_ reaches its minimum of size and\r\nmaximum depth of color in Florida (var. _floridana_) and in Mexico (var.\r\n_enano_).\r\n\r\nOf the other two I have not seen Florida specimens, but examples of\r\nboth from other Southern States and the Lower Mississippi Valley region\r\nare much more rufous, and—the _S. nebulosum_ especially—smaller, with\r\nmore naked toes. The latter species is darkest in Eastern Mexico (var.\r\n_sartori_), and most rufescent, and smallest, in Guatemala (var.\r\n_fulvescens_). In the middle region of the United States, _Scops asio_\r\n(var. _maccalli_) and _Bubo virginianus_ (var. _arcticus_) are more\r\ngrayish and more delicately pencilled than from other portions. In the\r\nnorthwest coast region they become larger and much more darkly colored,\r\nassuming the clove-brown or sooty tints peculiar to the region. The var.\r\n_kennicotti_ represents _S. asio_ in this region, and var. _pacificus_\r\nthe _B. virginianus_. The latter species also extends its range around\r\nthe Arctic Coast to Labrador, and forms a northern _littoral_ race, the\r\nvery opposite extreme in color from the nearly albinescent examples of\r\nvar. _arcticus_ found in the interior of Arctic America.\r\n\r\nA very remarkable characteristic of the Owls is the fact that many\r\nof the species exist in a sort of _dimorphic_ condition, or that two\r\nplumages sufficiently unlike to be of specific importance in other\r\ncases belong to one species. It was long thought that these two phases\r\nrepresented two distinct species; afterwards it was maintained that\r\nthey depended on age, sex, or season, different authors or observers\r\nentertaining various opinions on the subject; but it is now generally\r\nbelieved that every individual retains through life the plumage which it\r\nfirst acquires, and that young birds of both forms are often found in\r\nthe same nest, their parents being either both of one form, or both of\r\nthe other, or the two styles paired together.[12] The normal plumage,\r\nin these instances, appears to be grayish, the pattern distinct, the\r\nmarkings sharply defined, and the general appearance much like that\r\nof species which do not have the other plumage. The other plumage is\r\na replacing of the grayish tints by a bright lateritious-rufous, the\r\npencillings being at the same time less well defined, and the pattern of\r\nthe smaller markings often changed. This condition seems to be somewhat\r\nanalogous to _melanism_ in certain _Falconidæ_, and appears to be more\r\ncommon in the genera _Scops_ and _Glaucidium_ (in which it affects\r\nmainly the tropical species), and occurs also in the European _Syrnium\r\naluco_. As studied with relation to our North American species, we find\r\nit only in _Scops asio_ and _Glaucidium ferrugineum_. The latter, being\r\nstrictly tropical in its habitat, is similarly affected throughout\r\nits range; but in the former we find that this condition depends much\r\nupon the region. Thus neither Dr. Cooper nor I have ever seen a red\r\nspecimen from the Pacific coast, nor do I find any record of such an\r\noccurrence. The normal gray plumage, however, is as common throughout\r\nthat region as in the Atlantic States. In the New England and Middle\r\nStates the red plumage seems to be more rare in most places than the\r\ngray one, while toward the south the red predominates greatly. Of over\r\ntwenty specimens obtained in Southern Illinois (Mt. Carmel) in the\r\ncourse of one winter, only one was of the gray plumage; and of the total\r\nnumber of specimens seen and secured at other times during a series of\r\nyears, we can remember but one other gray one. As a parallel example\r\namong mammals, Professor Baird suggests the case of the Red-bellied\r\nSquirrels and Foxes of the Southern States, whose relationships to the\r\nmore grayish northern and western forms appear to be about the same as\r\nin the present instance.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS STRIX, SAVIGNY.\r\n\r\n  _Strix_, SAVIGNY, 1809 (_nec_ LINN. 1735).

Each feather of the mottled\r\nsurface (excepting the secondaries and primaries) has a medial dash of\r\nblack, enclosing a roundish or cordate spot of white near the end of the\r\nfeather; on the secondaries and primaries, the mottling is condensed\r\ninto obsolete transverse bands, which are about four in number on the\r\nformer and five on the latter; primary coverts deeper orange-rufous\r\nthan the other portions, the mottling principally at their ends. Tail\r\norange-ochraceous, finely mottled—most densely terminally—with dusky,\r\nfading into whitish at the tip, and crossed by about five distinct bands\r\nof mottled dusky. Face white, tinged with wine-red; an ante-orbital spot\r\nof dark claret-brown, this narrowly surrounding the eye; facial circle,\r\nfrom forehead down to the ears (behind which it is white for an inch or\r\nso) soft orange-ochraceous, similar to the ground-color of the upper\r\nparts; the lower half (from ears across the throat) deeper ochraceous,\r\nthe tips of the feathers blackish, the latter sometimes predominating.\r\nLower parts snowy-white, but this more or less overlaid with a tinge\r\nof fine orange-ochraceous, lighter than the tint of the upper parts;\r\nand, excepting on the jugulum, anal region, and crissum, with numerous\r\nminute but distinct specks of black; under surface of wings delicate\r\nyellowish-white, the lining sparsely sprinkled with black dots; inner\r\nwebs of primaries with transverse bars of mottled dusky near their ends.\r\n\r\n_Extreme plumages._ Darkest (No. 6,884, ♂, Tejon Valley, Cal.;\r\n“R. S. W.” Dr. Heermann): There is no white whatever on the plumage, the\r\nlower parts being continuous light ochraceous; the tibiæ have numerous\r\nround spots of blackish. Lightest (No. 6,885, same locality): Face and\r\nentire lower parts immaculate snowy-white; facial circle white, with the\r\ntips of the feathers orange; the secondaries, primaries, and tail show\r\nno bars, their surface being uniformly and finely mottled.\r\n\r\n_Measurements_ (♂, 6,884, Tejon Valley, Cal.; Dr. Heermann). Wing,\r\n13.00; tail, 5.70; culmen, .90; tarsus, 2.50; middle toe, 1.25.\r\nWing-formula, 2, 1–3. Among the very numerous specimens in the\r\ncollection, there is not one marked ♀. The extremes of a large series\r\nare as follows: Wing, 12.50–14.00; tail, 5.70–7.50; culmen, .90–1.10;\r\ntarsus, 2.55–3.00.\r\n\r\nHAB. More southern portions of North America, especially near the\r\nsea-coast, from the Middle States southward, and along the southern\r\nborder to California; whole of Mexico. In Central America appreciably\r\nmodified into var. _guatemalæ_. In South America replaced by var.\r\n_perlata_, and in the West Indies by the quite different var. _furcata_.\r\n\r\nLocalities: Oaxaca (SCL. P. Z. S. 1859, 390); Texas (DRESSER, Ibis,\r\n1865, 330); Arizona (COUES, P. A. N. S. 1866, 49); ? Bahamas (BRYANT,\r\nPr. Bost. Soc. 1867, 65). Kansas (SNOW, List of B. Kansas); Iowa (ALLEN,\r\nIowa Geol. Report, II, 424).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =6885= ½ NAT. SIZE.\r\n\r\n_Strix pratincola._]\r\n\r\nThe variations of plumage noted above appear to be of a purely\r\nindividual nature, since they do not depend upon the locality; nor, as\r\nfar as we can learn, to any considerable extent, upon age or sex.\r\n\r\nHABITS. On the Atlantic coast this bird very rarely occurs north of\r\nPennsylvania. It is given by Mr. Lawrence as very rare in the vicinity\r\nof New York, and in three instances, at least, it has been detected in\r\nNew England. An individual is said, by Rev. J. H. Linsley, to have been\r\ntaken in 1843, in Stratford, Conn.; another was shot at Sachem’s Head in\r\nthe same State, October 28, 1865; and a third was killed in May, 1868,\r\nnear Springfield, Mass.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of Philadelphia the Barn Owl is not very rare, but is\r\nmore common in spring and autumn than in the summer. Its nests have been\r\nfound in hollow trees near marshy meadows. Southward it is more or less\r\ncommon as far as South Carolina, where it becomes more abundant, and its\r\nrange then extends south and west as far as the Pacific. It is quite\r\nplentiful in Texas and New Mexico, and is one of the most abundant birds\r\nof California. It was not met with by Dr. Woodhouse in the expedition\r\nto the Zuñi River, but this may be attributed to the desolate character\r\nof the country through which he passed, as it is chiefly found about\r\nhabitations, and is never met with in wooded or wild regions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Strix flammea._]\r\n\r\nDr. Heermann and Dr. Gambel, who visited California before the present\r\nincrease in population, speak of its favorite resort as being in the\r\nneighborhood of the Missions, and of its nesting under the tiled roofs\r\nof the houses. The latter also refers to his finding numbers under\r\none roof, and states that they showed no fear when approached. The\r\npropensity of the California bird to drink the sacred oil from the\r\nconsecrated lamps about the altars of the Missions was frequently\r\nreferred to by the priests, whenever any allusion was made to this Owl.\r\nDr. Gambel also found it about farm-houses, and occasionally in the\r\nprairie valleys, where it obtains an abundance of food, such as mice and\r\nother small animals.\r\n\r\nDr. Heermann, in a subsequent visit to the State, mentions it as being\r\na very common bird in all parts of California. They were once quite\r\nnumerous among the hollow trees in the vicinity of Sacramento, but have\r\ngradually disappeared, as their old haunts were one by one destroyed\r\nto make way for the gradual development and growth of that city. Dr.\r\nHeermann found a large number in the winter, sheltered during the day\r\namong the reeds of Suisun Valley. They were still abundant in the old\r\nCatholic Missions, where they frequented the ruined walls and towers,\r\nand constructed their nests in the crevices and nooks of those once\r\nstately buildings, now falling to decay. These ruins were also a shelter\r\nfor innumerable bats, reptiles, and vermin, which formed an additional\r\nattraction to the Owls.\r\n\r\nDr. Cooper speaks of finding this Owl abundant throughout Southern\r\nCalifornia, especially near the coast, and Dr. Newberry frequently met\r\nwith it about San Francisco, San Diego, and Monterey, where it was\r\nmore common than any other species. He met with it on San Pablo Bay,\r\ninhabiting holes in the perpendicular cliffs bordering the south shore.\r\nIt was also found in the Klamath Basin, but not in great numbers.\r\n\r\nMr. J. H. Clark found the Barn Owl nesting, in May, in holes burrowed\r\ninto the bluff banks of the Rio Frio, in Texas. These burrows were\r\nnearly horizontal, with a considerable excavation near the back end,\r\nwhere the eggs were deposited. These were three or four in number,\r\nand of a dirty white. The parent bird allowed the eggs to be handled\r\nwithout manifesting any concern. There was no lining or nest whatever.\r\nLieutenant Couch found them common on the Lower Rio Grande, but rare\r\nnear Monterey, Mexico. They were frequently met with living in the sides\r\nof large deep wells.\r\n\r\nDr. Coues speaks of it as a common resident species in Arizona. It was\r\none of the most abundant Owls of the Territory, and was not unfrequently\r\nto be observed at midday. On one occasion he found it preying upon\r\nBlackbirds, in the middle of a small open reed swamp.\r\n\r\nIt is not uncommon in the vicinity of Washington, and after the partial\r\ndestruction of the Smithsonian Building by fire, for one or two years\r\na pair nested in the top of the tower. It is quite probable that the\r\ncomparative rarity of the species in the Eastern States is owing to\r\ntheir thoughtless destruction, the result of a short-sighted and\r\nmistaken prejudice that drives away one of our most useful birds, and\r\none which rarely does any mischief among domesticated birds, but is, on\r\nthe contrary, most destructive to rats, mice, and other mischievous and\r\ninjurious vermin.\r\n\r\nMr. Audubon mentions two of these birds which had been kept in\r\nconfinement in Charleston, S. C., where their cries in the night never\r\nfailed to attract others of the species. He regards them as altogether\r\ncrepuscular in habits, and states that when disturbed in broad daylight\r\nthey always fly in an irregular and bewildered manner. Mr. Audubon\r\nalso states that so far as his observations go, they feed entirely on\r\nsmall quadrupeds, as he has never found the remains of any feathers or\r\nportions of birds in their stomachs or about their nests. In confinement\r\nit partakes freely of any kind of flesh.\r\n\r\nThe Cuban race (var. _furcata_), also found in other West India islands,\r\nis hardly distinguishable from our own bird, and its habits may be\r\npresumed to be essentially the same. Mr. Gosse found the breeding-place\r\nof the Jamaica Owl at the bottom of a deep limestone pit, in the middle\r\nof October; there was one young bird with several eggs. There was not\r\nthe least vestige of a nest; the bird reposed on a mass of half-digested\r\nhair mingled with bones. At a little distance were three eggs, at\r\nleast six inches apart. On the 12th of the next month he found in the\r\nsame place the old bird sitting on four eggs, this time placed close\r\ntogether. There was still no nest. The eggs were advanced towards\r\nhatching, but in very different degrees, and an egg ready for deposition\r\nwas found in the oviduct of the old bird.\r\n\r\nAn egg of this Owl, taken in Louisiana by Dr. Trudeau, measured 1.69\r\ninches in length by 1.38 in breadth. Another, obtained in New Mexico,\r\nmeasures 1.69 by 1.25. Its color is a dirty yellowish-white, its shape\r\nan oblong oval, hardly more pointed at the smaller than at the larger\r\nend.\r\n\r\nAn egg from Monterey, California, collected by Dr. Canfield, measures\r\n1.70 inches in length by 1.25 in breadth, of an oblong-oval shape, and\r\nnearly equally obtuse at either end. It is of a uniform bluish-white.\r\nAnother from the Rio Grande is of a soiled or yellowish white, and of\r\nthe same size and shape.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS OTUS, CUVIER.\r\n\r\n  _Otus_, CUV. Reg.

Primary coverts dusky, with transverse series of dark\r\nmottled grayish spots, these becoming somewhat ochraceous basally;\r\nground-color of the primaries grayish, this especially prevalent on the\r\ninner quills; the basal third (or less) of all are ochraceous, this\r\ndecreasing in extent on inner feathers; the grayish tint is everywhere\r\nfinely mottled transversely with dusky, but the ochraceous is plain;\r\nprimaries crossed by a series of about seven quadrate blackish-brown\r\nspots, these anteriorly about as wide as the intervening yellowish or\r\nmottled grayish; the interval between the primary coverts to the first\r\nof these spots is about .80 to 1.00 inch on the fourth quill,—the\r\nspots on the inner and outer feathers approaching the coverts, or even\r\nunderlying them; the inner primaries—or, in fact, the general exposed\r\ngrayish surface—has much narrower bars of dusky. Ground-color of the\r\nwings like the back, this growing paler on the outer feathers, and\r\nbecoming ochraceous basally; the tip approaching whitish; secondaries\r\ncrossed by nine or ten narrow bands of dusky.\r\n\r\nEar-tufts, with the lateral portion of each web, ochraceous; this\r\nbecoming white, somewhat variegated with black, toward the end\r\nof the inner webs, on which the ochraceous is broadest; medial\r\nportion clear, unvariegated black.

S. 1866, 50).\r\n\r\nThe American Long-eared Owl is quite different in coloration from the\r\n_Otus vulgaris_ of Europe. In the latter, ochraceous prevails over the\r\nwhole surface, even above, where the transverse dusky mottling does\r\nnot approach the uniformity that it does in the American bird; in the\r\nEuropean bird, each feather above has a conspicuous medial longitudinal\r\nstripe of dark brownish: these markings are found everywhere except\r\non the rump and upper tail-coverts, where the ochraceous is deepest,\r\nand transversely clouded with dusky mottling; in the American bird, no\r\nlongitudinal stripes are visible on the upper surface. The ochraceous\r\nof the lower surface is, in the _vulgaris_, varied only (to any\r\nconsiderable degree) by the sharply defined medial longitudinal stripes\r\nto the feathers, the transverse bars being few and inconspicuous; in\r\n_wilsonianus_, white overlies the ochraceous below, and the longitudinal\r\nare less conspicuous than the transverse markings; the former on the\r\nbreast are broader than in _vulgaris_, in which, also, the ochraceous\r\nat the bases of the primaries occupies a greater extent. Comparing\r\nthese very appreciable differences with the close resemblance of other\r\nrepresentative styles of the two continents (differences founded on\r\nshade or depth of tints alone), we were almost inclined to recognize in\r\nthe American Long-eared Owl a specific value to these discrepancies.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Otus vulgaris._]\r\n\r\nThe _Otus stygius_, Wagl., of South America and Mexico, is entirely\r\ndistinct, as will be seen from the foregoing synoptical table.\r\n\r\nHABITS. This species appears to be one of the most numerous of the\r\nOwls of North America, and to be pretty generally distributed. Its\r\nstrictly nocturnal habits have caused it to be temporarily overlooked in\r\nlocalities where it is now known to be present and not rare. Dr. William\r\nGambel and Dr. Heermann both omit it from their lists of the birds of\r\nCalifornia, though Dr. J. G. Cooper has since found it quite common. It\r\nwas once supposed not to breed farther south than New Jersey, but it\r\nis now known to be resident in South Carolina and in Arizona, and is\r\nprobably distributed through all the intervening country. Donald Gunn\r\nwrites that to his knowledge this solitary bird hunts in the night, both\r\nsummer and winter, in the Red River region. It there takes possession of\r\nthe deserted nests of crows, and lays four white eggs. He found it as\r\nfar as the shores of Hudson’s Bay. Richardson states it to be plentiful\r\nin the woods skirting the plains of the Saskatchewan, frequenting the\r\ncoast of the bay in the summer, and retiring into the interior in the\r\nwinter. He met with it as high as the 16th parallel of latitude, and\r\nbelieved it to occur as far as the forests extend.\r\n\r\nDr. Cooper met with this species on the banks of the Columbia, east of\r\nthe Dalles. The region was desolate and barren, and several species\r\nof Owls appeared to have been drawn there by the abundance of hares\r\nand mice. Dr. Suckley also met with it on a branch of Milk River, in\r\nNebraska. It has likewise been taken in different parts of California,\r\nin New Mexico, among the Rocky Mountains, in the valley of the Rio\r\nGrande, at Fort Benton, and at Cape Florida, in the last-named place by\r\nMr. Würdemann.\r\n\r\nDr. Cooper found this Owl quite common near San Diego, and in March\r\nobserved them sitting in pairs in the evergreen oaks, apparently not\r\nmuch troubled by the light. On the 27th of March he found a nest,\r\nprobably that of a Crow, built in a low evergreen oak, in which a female\r\nOwl was sitting on five eggs, then partly hatched. The bird was quite\r\nbold, flew round him, snapping her bill at him, and tried to draw him\r\naway from the nest; the female imitating the cries of wounded birds with\r\nremarkable accuracy, showing a power of voice not supposed to exist in\r\nOwls, but more in the manner of a Parrot. He took one of the eggs, and\r\non the 23d of April, on revisiting the nest, he found that the others\r\nhad hatched. The egg measured 1.60 by 1.36 inches. Dr. Cooper also\r\nstates that he has found this Owl wandering into the barren treeless\r\ndeserts east of the Sierra Nevada, where it was frequently to be met\r\nwith in the autumn, hiding in the thickets along the streams. It also\r\nresorts to caves, where any are to be found.\r\n\r\nDr. Kennerly met with this bird in the cañons west of the Aztec\r\nMountains, where they find good places for their nests, which\r\nthey build, in common with Crows and Hawks, among the precipitous\r\ncliffs,—places unapproachable by the wolf and lynx.\r\n\r\nOn the Atlantic coast the Long-eared Owl occurs in more or less\r\nabundance from Nova Scotia to Florida. It is found in the vicinity of\r\nHalifax, according to Mr. Downes, and about Calais according to Mr.\r\nBoardman, though not abundantly in either region. In Western Maine, and\r\nin the rest of New England, it is more common. It has been known to\r\nbreed at least as far south as Maryland, Mr. W. M. McLean finding it in\r\nRockville. Mr. C. N. Holden, Jr., during his residence at Sherman, in\r\nWyoming Territory, met with a single specimen of this bird. A number of\r\nMagpies were in the same bush, but did not seem either to molest or to\r\nbe afraid of it.\r\n\r\nThe food of this bird consists chiefly of small quadrupeds, insects,\r\nand, to some extent, of small birds of various kinds. Audubon mentions\r\nfinding the stomach of one stuffed with feathers, hair, and bones.\r\n\r\nThe Long-eared Owl appears to nest for the most part in trees, and also\r\nfrequently to make use of the nests of other birds, such as Crows,\r\nHawks, or Herons. Occasionally, however, they construct nests for\r\nthemselves. Audubon speaks of finding such a one near the Juniata\r\nRiver, in Pennsylvania. This was composed of green twigs with the\r\nleaflets adhering, and lined with fresh grass and sheep’s wool, but\r\nwithout feathers. Mr. Kennicott sent me from Illinois an egg of this\r\nbird, that had been taken from a nest on the ground; and, according\r\nto Richardson, in the fur regions it sometimes lays its eggs in that\r\nmanner, at other times in the deserted nests of other birds, on low\r\nbushes. Mr. Hutchins speaks of its depositing them as early as April.\r\nRichardson received one found in May; and another nest was observed, in\r\nthe same neighborhood, which contained three eggs on the 5th of July.\r\nWilson speaks of this Owl as having been abundant in his day in the\r\nvicinity of Philadelphia, and of six or seven having been found in a\r\nsingle tree. He also mentions it as there breeding among the branches of\r\ntall trees, and in one particular instance as having taken possession\r\nof the nest of a Qua Bird (_Nyctiardea gardeni_), where Wilson found it\r\nsitting on four eggs, while one of the Herons had her own nest on the\r\nsame tree. Audubon states that it usually accommodates itself by making\r\nuse of the abandoned nests of other birds, whether these are built high\r\nor low. It also makes use of the fissures of rocks, or builds on the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nAs this Owl is known to breed early in April, and as numerous instances\r\nare given of their eggs being taken in July, it is probable they have\r\ntwo broods in a season. Mr. J. S. Brandigee, of Berlin, Conn., found\r\na nest early in April, in a hemlock-tree, situated in a thick dark\r\nevergreen woods. The nest was flat, made of coarse sticks, and contained\r\nfour fresh eggs when the parent was shot.\r\n\r\nMr. Ridgway found this Owl to be very abundant in the Sacramento Valley,\r\nas well as throughout the Great Basin, in both regions inhabiting dense\r\nwillow copses near the streams. In the interior it generally lays its\r\neggs in the deserted nests of the Magpie.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of this Owl, when fresh, are of a brilliant white color, with a\r\nslight pinkish tinge, which they preserve even after having been blown,\r\nif kept from the light. They are of a rounded-oval shape, and obtuse\r\nat either end. They vary considerably in size, measuring from 1.65 to\r\n1.50 inches in length, and from 1.30 to 1.35 inches in breadth. Two\r\neggs, taken from the same nest by Rev. C. M. Jones, have the following\r\nmeasurements: one 1.60 by 1.34 inches, the other 1.50 by 1.30 inches.\r\n\r\n\r\nOtus (Brachyotus) brachyotus, STEPH.\r\n\r\nSHORT-EARED OWL; MARSH OWL.\r\n\r\n  _Strix brachyotus_, GMEL.

The flanks, legs, anal region, and lower tail-coverts\r\nare always perfectly immaculate; the legs most deeply ochraceous, the\r\nlower tail-coverts nearly pure white. The rump has obsolete crescentic\r\nmarks of brownish. The wings are variegated with the general dusky and\r\nochraceous tints, but the markings are more irregular; the yellowish in\r\nform of indentations or confluent spots, approaching the shafts from\r\nthe edge,—broadest on the outer webs. Secondaries crossed by about\r\nfive bands of ochraceous, the last terminal; primary coverts plain\r\nblackish-brown, with one or two poorly defined transverse series of\r\nochraceous spots on the basal portion. Primaries ochraceous on the basal\r\ntwo-thirds, the terminal portion clear dark brown, the tips (broadly)\r\npale brownish-yellowish, this becoming obsolete on the longest; the\r\ndusky extends toward the bases, in three to five irregularly transverse\r\nseries of quadrate spots on the outer webs, leaving, however, a large\r\nbasal area of plain ochraceous,—this somewhat more whitish anteriorly.\r\nThe ground-color of the tail is ochraceous,—this becoming whitish\r\nexteriorly and terminally,—crossed by five broad bands (about equalling\r\nthe ochraceous, but becoming narrower toward outer feathers) of\r\nblackish-brown; on the middle feathers, the ochraceous spots enclose\r\nsmaller, central transverse spots of blackish; the terminal ochraceous\r\nband is broadest.\r\n\r\nEyebrows, lores, chin, and throat soiled white, the loral bristles with\r\nblack shafts; face dingy ochraceous-white, feathers with darker shafts;\r\neye broadly encircled with black.

I.).\r\n\r\nIn view of the untangible nature of the differences between the American\r\nand European Short-eared Owls (seldom at all appreciable, and when\r\nappreciable not constant), we cannot admit a difference even of race\r\nbetween them. In fact, this species seems to be the only one of the\r\nOwls common to the two continents in which an American specimen cannot\r\nbe distinguished from the European. The average plumage of the American\r\nrepresentative is a shade or two darker than that of European examples;\r\nbut the lightest specimens I have seen are several from the Yukon region\r\nin Alaska, and one from California (No. 6,888, Suisun Valley).\r\n\r\nNot only am I unable to appreciate any tangible differences between\r\nEuropean and North American examples, but I fail to detect characters\r\nof the least importance whereby these may be distinguished from South\r\nAmerican and Sandwich Island specimens (“_galopagoensis_, Gould,” and\r\n“_sandwichensis_, Blox.”). Only two specimens, among a great many\r\nfrom South America (Paraguay, Buenos Ayres, Brazil, etc.), are at all\r\ndistinguishable from Northern American. These two (Nos. 13,887 and\r\n13,883, Chile) are somewhat darker than others, but not so dark as No.\r\n16,029, ♀, from Fort Crook, California. A specimen from the Sandwich\r\nIslands (No. 13,890) is nearly identical with these Chilean birds, the\r\nonly observable difference consisting in a more blackish forehead, and\r\nin having just noticeable dark shaft-lines on the lower tail-coverts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Otus brachyotus._]\r\n\r\nIn the geographical variations of this species it is seen that the\r\naverage plumage of North American specimens is just appreciably darker\r\nthan that of European, while tropical specimens have a tendency to be\r\nstill darker. I know of no bird so widely distributed which varies\r\nso little in the different parts of its habitat, unless it be the\r\n_Cotyle riparia_, which, however, is not found so far to the south. The\r\ndifference, in this case, between the American and European birds, does\r\nnot correspond at all to that between the two easily distinguished races\r\nof _Otus vulgaris_, _Nyctale tengmalmi_, _Surnia ulula_, and _Syrnium\r\ncinereum_.\r\n\r\nA specimen from Porto Rico (No. 39,643) is somewhat remarkable on\r\naccount of the prevalence of the dusky of the upper parts, the unusually\r\nfew and narrow stripes of the same on the lower parts, the roundish\r\nochraceous spots on the wings, and in having the primaries barred to the\r\nbase. Should all other specimens from the same region agree in these\r\ncharacters, they might form a diagnosable race. The plumage has an\r\nabnormal appearance, however, and I much doubt whether others like it\r\nwill ever be taken.\r\n\r\nHABITS. The Short-eared Owl appears to be distributed, in varying\r\nfrequency, throughout North America, more abundant in the Arctic regions\r\nduring the summer, and more frequently met with in the United States\r\nduring the winter months. Richardson met with it throughout the fur\r\ncountries as far to the north as the 67th parallel. Professor Holböll\r\ngives it as a bird of Greenland, and it was met with in considerable\r\nabundance by MacFarlane in the Anderson River district. Mr. Murray\r\nmentions a specimen received from the wooded district between Hudson’s\r\nBay and Lake Winnipeg. Captain Blakiston met with it on the coast of\r\nHudson’s Bay, and Mr. Bernard Ross on the Mackenzie River.\r\n\r\nMr. Dresser speaks of it as common at times near San Antonio during the\r\nwinter months, keeping itself in the tall weeds and grass. It is given\r\nby Dr. Gundlach as an occasional visitant of Cuba.\r\n\r\nDr. Newberry met with it throughout Oregon and California, and found\r\nit especially common in the Klamath Basin. On the level meadow-like\r\nprairies of the Upper Pitt River it was seen associating with the Marsh\r\nHawk in considerable numbers. It was generally concealed in the grass,\r\nand rose as the party approached. He afterwards met with this bird on\r\nthe shores of Klamath Lake, and in the Des Chutes Basin, among grass\r\nand sage-bushes, in those localities associated with the Burrowing Owl\r\n(_A. hypogæa_). In Washington Territory it was found by Dr. Cooper on\r\nthe great Spokane Plain, where, as elsewhere, it was commonly found in\r\nthe long grass during the day. In fall and winter it appeared in large\r\nnumbers on the low prairies of the coast, but was not gregarious. Though\r\nproperly nocturnal, it was met with, hunting on cloudy days, flying low\r\nover the meadows, in the manner of the Marsh Hawk. He did not meet with\r\nit in summer in the Territory.\r\n\r\nDr. Heermann found it abundant in the Suisun and Napa valleys of\r\nCalifornia, in equal numbers with the _Strix pratincola_. It sought\r\nshelter during the day on the ground among the reeds, and, when startled\r\nfrom its hiding-place, would fly but a few yards and alight again upon\r\nthe ground. It did not seem wild or shy. He afterwards met with the same\r\nspecies on the desert between the Tejon Pass and the Mohave River, and\r\nagain saw it on the banks of the latter. Richardson gives it as a summer\r\nvisitant only in the fur countries, where it arrives as soon as the snow\r\ndisappears, and departs again in September. A female was killed May 20\r\nwith eggs nearly ready for exclusion. The bird was by no means rare,\r\nand, as it frequently hunted for its prey in the daytime, was often\r\nseen. Its principal haunts appeared to be dense thickets of young pines,\r\nor dark and entangled willow-clumps, where it would sit on a low branch,\r\nwatching assiduously for mice. When disturbed, it would fly low for a\r\nshort distance, and then hide itself in a bush, from whence it was not\r\neasily driven. Its nest was said to be on the ground, in a dry place,\r\nand formed of withered grass. Hutchins is quoted as giving the number of\r\nits eggs as ten or twelve, and describing them as round. The latter is\r\nnot correct, and seven appears to be their maximum number.\r\n\r\nMr. Downes speaks of it as very rare in Nova Scotia, but Elliott Cabot\r\ngives it as breeding among the islands in the Bay of Fundy, off the\r\ncoast, where he found several nests. It was not met with by Professor\r\nVerrill in Western Maine, but is found in other parts of the State. It\r\nis not uncommon in Eastern Massachusetts, where specimens are frequently\r\nkilled and brought to market for sale, and where it also breeds in\r\nfavorable localities on the coast. Mr. William Brewster met with it on\r\nMuskeget, near Nantucket, where it had been breeding, and where it was\r\nevidently a resident, its plumage having become bleached by exposure\r\nto the sun, and the reflected light of the white sand of that treeless\r\nisland. It is not so common in the interior, though Mr. Allen gives it\r\nas resident, and rather common, near Springfield. Dr. Wood found it\r\nbreeding in Connecticut, within a few miles of Hartford.\r\n\r\nDr. Coues gives it as a resident species in South Carolina, and Mr.\r\nAllen also mentions it, on the authority of Mr. Boardman, as quite\r\ncommon among the marshes of Florida. Mr. Audubon also speaks of finding\r\nit so plentiful in Florida that on one occasion he shot seven in a\r\nsingle morning. They were to be found in the open prairies of that\r\ncountry, rising from the tall grass in a hurried manner, and moving in\r\na zigzag manner, as if suddenly wakened from a sound sleep, and then\r\nsailing to some distance in a direct course, and dropping among the\r\nthickest herbage. Occasionally the Owl would enter a thicket of tangled\r\npalmettoes, where with a cautious approach it could be taken alive. He\r\nnever found two of these birds close together, but always singly, at\r\ndistances of from twenty to a hundred yards; and when two or more were\r\nstarted at once, they never flew towards each other.\r\n\r\nMr. Audubon met with a nest of this Owl on one of the mountain ridges\r\nin the great pine forest of Pennsylvania, containing four eggs nearly\r\nready to be hatched. They were bluish-white, of an elongated form, and\r\nmeasured 1.50 inches in length and 1.12 in breadth. The nest, made in\r\na slovenly manner with dry grasses, was under a low bush, and covered\r\nover with tall grass, through which the bird had made a path. The parent\r\nbird betrayed her presence by making a clicking noise with her bill as\r\nhe passed by; and he nearly put his hand on her before she would move,\r\nand then she hopped away, and would not fly, returning to her nest as\r\nsoon as he left the spot. The pellets disgorged by the Owl, and found\r\nnear her nest, were found to consist of the bones of small quadrupeds\r\nmixed with hair, and the wings of several kinds of coleopterous insects.\r\n\r\nThis bird was found breeding near the coast of New Jersey by Mr. Krider;\r\nand at Hamilton, Canada, on the western shore of Lake Ontario; Mr.\r\nMcIlwraith speaks of its being more common than any other Owl.\r\n\r\nA nest found by Mr. Cabot was in the midst of a dry peaty bog. It was\r\nbuilt on the ground, in a very slovenly manner, of small sticks and a\r\nfew feathers, and presented hardly any excavation. It contained four\r\neggs on the point of being hatched. A young bird the size of a Robin was\r\nalso found lying dead on a tussock of grass in another similar locality.\r\n\r\nThe notes of Mr. MacFarlane supply memoranda of twelve nests found by\r\nhim in the Anderson River country. They were all placed on the ground,\r\nin various situations. One was in a small clump of dwarf willows, on the\r\nground, and composed of a few decayed leaves. Another nest was in a very\r\nsmall hole, lined with a little hay and some decayed leaves. This was on\r\na barren plain of some extent, fifty miles east of Fort Anderson, and on\r\nthe edge of the wooded country. A third was in a clump of Labrador Tea,\r\nand was similar to the preceding, except that the nest contained a few\r\nfeathers. This nest contained seven eggs,—the largest number found, and\r\nonly in this case. A fourth was in an artificial depression, evidently\r\nscratched out by the parent bird. Feathers seem to have been noticed in\r\nabout half the nests, and in all cases to have been taken by the parent\r\nfrom her own breast. Nearly all the nests were in depressions made for\r\nthe purpose.\r\n\r\nMr. Dall noticed the Short-eared Owl on the Yukon and at Nulato,\r\nand Mr. Bannister observed it at St. Michael’s, where it was a not\r\nunfrequent visitor. In his recent Notes on the Avi-fauna of the Aleutian\r\nIslands, (Pr. Cal. Academy, 1873,) Dall informs us that it is resident\r\non Unalashka, and that it excavates a hole horizontally for its\r\nnesting-place,—usually to a distance of about two feet, the farther end\r\na little the higher. The extremity is lined with dry grass and feathers.\r\nAs there are no trees in the island, the bird was often seen sitting\r\non the ground, near the mouth of its burrow, even in the daytime. Mr.\r\nRidgway found this bird in winter in California, but never met with\r\nit at any season in the interior, where the _O. wilsonianus_ was so\r\nabundant.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of this Owl are of a uniform dull white color, which in\r\nthe unblown egg is said to have a bluish tinge; they are in form an\r\nelliptical ovoid. The eggs obtained by Mr. Cabot measured 1.56 inches in\r\nlength and 1.25 in breadth. The smallest egg collected by Mr. MacFarlane\r\nmeasured 1.50 by 1.22 inches. The largest taken by Mr. B. R. Ross, at\r\nFort Simpson, measures 1.60 by 1.30 inches; their average measurement is\r\n1.57 by 1.28 inches. An egg of the European bird measures 1.55 by 1.30\r\ninches.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS SYRNIUM, SAVIGNY.\r\n\r\n  _Syrnium_, SAVIGNY, Nat. Hist. Egypt, I, 112; 1809.

CHAR. _Adult._ Ground-color of the upper surface dark vandyke-brown,\r\nbut this relieved by a transverse mottling (on the edges of the\r\nfeathers) of white, the medial portions of the feathers being scarcely\r\nvariegated, causing an appearance of obsolete longitudinal dark\r\nstripes, these most conspicuous on the scapulars and back. The anterior\r\nportions above are more regularly barred transversely; the white bars\r\ninterrupted, however, by the brown medial stripe. On the rump and\r\nupper tail-coverts the mottling is more profuse, causing a grayish\r\nappearance. On the wing-coverts the outer webs are most variegated by\r\nthe white mottling. The alula and primary coverts have very obsolete\r\nbands of paler; the secondaries are crossed by nine (last terminal, and\r\nthree concealed by coverts) bands of pale grayish-brown, inclining to\r\nwhite at the borders of the spots; primaries crossed by nine transverse\r\nseries of quadrate spots of mottled pale brownish-gray on the outer\r\nwebs, those beyond the emargination obscure,—the terminal crescentic\r\nbar distinct, however; upper secondaries and middle tail-feathers with\r\ncoarse transverse mottling, almost forming bars. Tail with about nine\r\npaler bands, these merely marked off by parallel, nearly white bars,\r\nenclosing a plain grayish-brown, sometimes slightly mottled space, just\r\nperceptibly darker than the ground-color; basally the feathers become\r\nprofusely mottled, so that the bands are confused; the last band is\r\nterminal. Beneath with the ground-color grayish-white, each feather of\r\nthe neck, breast, and abdomen with a broad, longitudinal ragged stripe\r\nof dark brown, like the ground-color of the upper parts; sides, flanks,\r\ncrissum, and lower tail-coverts with regular transverse narrow bands;\r\nlegs with finer, more irregular, transverse bars of dusky. “Eyebrows,”\r\nlores, and chin grayish-white, a dusky space at anterior angle of\r\nthe eye; face grayish-white, with distinct concentric semicircles of\r\nblackish-brown; facial circle dark brown, becoming white across the\r\nforeneck, where it is divided medially by a spot of brownish-black,\r\ncovering the throat.\r\n\r\n♂ (32,306, Moose Factory, Hudson Bay Territory; J.

In winter extending into\r\nnorthern borders of United States (Massachusetts, MAYNARD).\r\n\r\nThe relationship between the _Syrnium cinereum_ and the _S. lapponicum_\r\nis exactly parallel to that between the _Otus vulgaris_, var.\r\n_wilsonianus_, and var. _vulgaris_, _Surnia ulula_, var. _hudsonia_, and\r\nthe var. _ulula_, and _Nyctale tengmalmi_, var. _richardsoni_, and the\r\nvar. _tengmalmi_. In conformity to the general rule among the species\r\nwhich belong to the two continents, the American race of the present\r\nbird is very decidedly darker than the European one, which has the\r\nwhitish mottling much more prevalent, giving the plumage a lighter and\r\nmore grayish aspect. The white predominates on the outer webs of the\r\nscapulars. On the head and neck the white equals the dusky in extent,\r\nwhile on the lower parts it largely prevails. The longitudinal stripes\r\nof the dorsal region are much more conspicuous in _lapponicum_ than in\r\n_cinereum_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Syrnium cinereum._]\r\n\r\nA specimen in the Schlütter collection, labelled as from “Nord-Europa,”\r\nis not distinguishable from North American examples, and is so very\r\nunlike the usual Lapland style that we doubt its being a European\r\nspecimen at all.\r\n\r\nHABITS. The Great Gray or Cinereous Owl appears to be confined to the\r\nmore northern portions of North America. It is rarely met with in any\r\npart of the United States, and only in winter, with the exception of\r\nWashington Territory, where it is presumed to be a resident. It is also\r\nsaid to be a resident in Canada, and to be found in the vicinity of\r\nMontreal. Mr. Lawrence does not include this bird in his list of the\r\nbirds of New York, but Mr. Turnbull states that several have been taken\r\nas far south as New Jersey. Throughout New England it is occasional in\r\nthe winter, but comparatively rare. Mr. Allen did not hear of any having\r\nbeen taken near Springfield. On the coast of Massachusetts they are of\r\ninfrequent occurrence, and are held at high prices. A fine specimen\r\nwas shot in Lynn in the winter of 1872, and is now in the collection\r\nof my nephew, W. S. Brewer. On the Pacific coast it is resident as far\r\nsouth as the mouth of the Columbia, and is found in winter in Northern\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nDr. Richardson met with this Owl in the fur regions, where it seemed to\r\nbe by no means rare. He mentions it as an inhabitant of all the wooded\r\ndistricts which lie between Lake Superior and latitude 67° and 68°,\r\nand between Hudson’s Bay and the Pacific. It was common on the borders\r\nof Great Bear Lake, in which region, as well as in a higher parallel\r\nof latitude, it pursues its prey during the summer months by daylight.\r\nIt was observed to keep constantly within the woods, and was not seen\r\nto frequent the barren grounds, in the manner of the Snowy Owl, nor\r\nwas it so often met with in broad daylight as the Hawk Owl, apparently\r\npreferring to hunt when the sun was low and the recesses of the woods\r\ndeeply shadowed, when the hares and other smaller quadrupeds, upon which\r\nit chiefly feeds, were most abundant.\r\n\r\nOn the 23d of May, Dr. Richardson discovered a nest of this Owl, built\r\non the top of a lofty balsam-poplar, composed of sticks, with a lining\r\nof feathers. It contained three young birds, covered with a whitish\r\ndown, to secure which it was necessary to cut down the tree. While this\r\nwas going on, the parent birds flew in circles around the tree, keeping\r\nout of gun-shot, and apparently undisturbed by the light. The young\r\nbirds were kept alive for several weeks, but finally escaped. They had\r\nthe habit, when any one entered the room in which they were kept, of\r\nthrowing themselves back and making a loud snapping noise with their\r\nbills.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1831, as Audubon was informed, a fine specimen of one\r\nof these Owls was taken alive in Marblehead, Mass., having been seen\r\nperched upon a woodpile early in the morning. It was obtained by Mr.\r\nIves, of Salem, by whom it was kept several months. It was fed on fish\r\nand small birds, and ate its food readily. It would at times utter a\r\ntremulous cry, not unlike that of the common Screech-Owl (_Scops asio_),\r\nand manifested the greatest antipathy to cats and dogs.\r\n\r\nDr. Cooper found this bird near the mouth of the Columbia River, in a\r\nbrackish meadow partially covered with small spruce-trees, where they\r\nsat concealed during the day, or made short flights from one to another.\r\nDr. Cooper procured a specimen there in June, and has no doubt that\r\nthe bird is resident and breeds in that neighborhood. He regards it as\r\nsomewhat diurnal in its habits, and states that it is especially active\r\ntoward sunset.\r\n\r\nDr. Newberry speaks of this Owl as one generally distributed over the\r\nwestern part of the continent, he having met with it in the Sacramento\r\nValley, in the Cascade Mountains, in the Des Chutes Basin, and in\r\nOregon, on the Columbia River. Mr. Robert MacFarlane found it in great\r\nabundance in the Anderson River region. On the 19th of July, as we\r\nfind in one of his memoranda, he met with a nest of this species near\r\nLockhart River, on the route to Fort Good Hope. The nest was on the top\r\nof a pine-tree, twenty feet from the ground. It contained two eggs and\r\ntwo young, both of which were dead. The nest was composed of sticks and\r\nmosses, and was lined thinly with down. The female was sitting on the\r\nnest, but left it at his approach, and flew to a tree at some distance,\r\nwhere she was shot.\r\n\r\nMr. Donald Gunn writes that the Cinereous Owl is to be found both in\r\nsummer and in winter throughout all the country commonly known as the\r\nHudson Bay Territory. He states that it hunts by night, preys upon\r\nrabbits and mice, and nests in tall poplar-trees, usually quite early in\r\nthe season.\r\n\r\nA single specimen of this Owl was taken at Sitka by Bischoff, and\r\non the 20th of April Mr. Dall obtained a female that had been shot\r\nat Takitesky, about twenty miles east of the Yukon, near Nulato. He\r\nsubsequently obtained several specimens in that region. Mr. Dall\r\ndescribes it as very stupid, and easy to be caught by the hand during\r\nthe daytime. From its awkward motions its Indian name of _nūhl-tūhl_,\r\nsignifying “heavy walker,” is derived. So far as observed by Mr. Dall,\r\nthis Owl appeared to feed principally upon small birds, and he took no\r\nless than thirteen crania and other remains of _Ægiothus linaria_ from\r\nthe crop of a single bird.\r\n\r\nSpecimens of this Owl have also been received by the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution, collected by Mr. Kennicott, from Fort Yukon and from\r\nNulato; from Mr. J. McKenzie, Moose Factory; from J. Lockhart, obtained\r\nat Fort Resolution and at Fort Yukon; from J. Flett, at La Pierre\r\nHouse; from B. R. Ross, at Big Island; and from Mr. S. Jones and Mr. J.\r\nMcDougall, at Fort Yukon. These were all taken between February 11 and\r\nJuly 19.\r\n\r\nOne of the eggs of this Owl, referred to above in Mr. MacFarlane’s note,\r\nis in my cabinet. It is small for the size of the bird, and is of a\r\ndull soiled-white color, oblong in shape, and decidedly more pointed at\r\none end than at the other. It measures 2.25 inches in length by 1.78 in\r\nbreadth. The drawing of an egg of this species, made by Mr. Audubon from\r\na supposed specimen of an egg of this species, referred to in the “North\r\nAmerican Oölogy,” and which measured 2.44 by 2.00 inches, was probably a\r\nsketch of the egg of the Snowy Owl.\r\n\r\n\r\nSyrnium nebulosum, GRAY.\r\n\r\nBARRED OWL; “HOOT OWL.”\r\n\r\n  _Strix nebulosa_, FORST.

CHAR. _Adult._ Head, neck, breast, back, scapulars, and rump with\r\nbroad regular transverse bars of ochraceous-white and deep umber-brown,\r\nthe latter color always terminal; on the upper surface the brown\r\nsomewhat exceeds the whitish in width, but on the neck and breast the\r\nwhite rather predominates. The lower third of the breast is somewhat\r\ndifferently marked from the upper portion, the brown bars being\r\nconnected along the shaft of the feather, throwing the white into pairs\r\nof spots on opposite webs. Each feather of the abdomen, sides, flanks,\r\nand lower tail-coverts has a broad medial longitudinal stripe of brown\r\nsomewhat deeper in tint than the transverse bars on the upper parts; the\r\nanal region is plain, more ochraceous, white; the legs have numerous,\r\nbut rather faint, transverse spots of brown. Ground-color of the\r\nwings and tail brown, like the bars of the back; middle and secondary\r\nwing-coverts with roundish transverse spots of nearly pure white on\r\nlower webs; lesser coverts plain rich brown; secondaries crossed by\r\nsix bands of pale grayish-brown, passing into paler on the edge of\r\neach feather,—the last is terminal, passing narrowly into whitish;\r\nprimary coverts with four bands of darker ochraceous-brown; primaries\r\nwith transverse series of quadrate pale-brown spots on the outer webs\r\n(growing deeper in tint on inner quills), the last terminal; on the\r\nlongest are about eight. Tail like the wings, crossed with six or seven\r\nsharply defined bands of pale brown, the last terminal.\r\n\r\nFace grayish-white, with concentric semicircular bars of brown; eyebrows\r\nand lores with black shafts; a narrow crescent of black against anterior\r\nangle of the eye. Facial circle of blackish-brown and creamy-white bars,\r\nthe former prevailing along the anterior edge, the latter more distinct\r\nposteriorly, and prevailing across the neck in front, where the brown\r\nforms disconnected transverse spots.\r\n\r\n♀ (752, Carlisle, Penn.). Wing-formula, 4–3, 5–2, 6; 1=9. Wing, 13.00;\r\ntail, 9.00; culmen, 1.05; tarsus, 1.90; middle toe, 1.50.\r\n\r\n♂. A little smaller. (No specimen marked ♂ in the collection.)\r\n\r\n_Hab._ Eastern North America, west to the Missouri; Rio Grande region.\r\n\r\nA female (?) from Calais, Me., (4,966; G. A. Boardman,) is somewhat\r\nlighter-colored than the type, owing to the clearer white of the bars.\r\nIt measures, wing, 13.50; tail, 9.80.\r\n\r\nA specimen (4,357, January) from Washington, D. C., is quite remarkable\r\nfor the very dark tints of plumage and the unusual prevalence of the\r\nbrown; this is of a more reddish cast than in all other specimens,\r\nbecoming somewhat blackish on the head and neck; anteriorly it prevails\r\nso as to almost completely hide the pale bars of the back and nape.\r\nThe tail has no bars except three or four very obsolete ones near the\r\nend; beneath, the ochraceous tinge is quite deep. The toes, except\r\ntheir first joint, are perfectly naked; the middle one, however, has a\r\nnarrow strip of feathering running along the outer side as far as the\r\nlast joint. The darker shades of color, and more naked toes, seem to be\r\ndistinguishing features of southern examples.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Syrnium nebulosum._]\r\n\r\nHABITS. The Barred Owl has an extended range, having been met with\r\nnearly throughout North America, from about latitude 50° to Texas.\r\nMinnesota is the most western point to which, so far as I am aware,\r\nit has been traced. It is more abundant in the Southern States than\r\nelsewhere, and in the more northern portions of North America is\r\nsomewhat rare. Richardson did not encounter it in the more arctic\r\nportion of the fur countries, nor has it, so far as I can learn, been\r\nobserved on the Pacific coast. It is said to be of accidental occurrence\r\nin northern Europe.\r\n\r\nIn Louisiana, as Mr. Audubon states, it is more abundant than anywhere\r\nelse; and Dr. Woodhouse speaks of it as very common in the Indian\r\nTerritories, and also in Texas and New Mexico, especially in the\r\ntimbered lands bordering the streams and ponds of that region. In July,\r\n1846, while in pursuit of shore birds in the island of Muskeget, near\r\nNantucket, in the middle of a bright day, I was surprised by meeting one\r\nof these birds, which, uninvited, joined us in the hunt, and when shot\r\nproved to be a fine male adult specimen.\r\n\r\nThe Barred Owl was found in great abundance in Florida by Mr. J. A.\r\nAllen, the only species of Owl at all common, and where its ludicrous\r\nnotes were heard at night everywhere, and even occasionally in the\r\ndaytime. At night they not unfrequently startle the traveller by their\r\nstrange utterances from the trees directly over his head.\r\n\r\nMr. Dresser speaks of it as very abundant at all seasons of the year in\r\nthe wooded parts of Texas. He was not able to find its nest, but was\r\ntold by the hunters that they build in hollow trees, near the banks of\r\nthe rivers.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Downes, this Owl is common throughout Nova Scotia,\r\nwhere it is resident, and never leaves its particular neighborhood.\r\nIt breeds in the woods throughout all parts of that colony, and was\r\nobserved by him to feed on hares, spruce and ruffed grouse, and other\r\nbirds. It is said to be a quite common event for this bird to make its\r\nappearance at midnight about the camp-fires of the moose-hunter and\r\nthe lumberer, and to disturb their slumbers with its cries, as with a\r\ndemoniacal expression it peers into the glare of the embers. Distending\r\nits throat and pushing its head forward, it gives utterance to unearthly\r\nsounds that to the superstitious are quite appalling.\r\n\r\nMr. Wilson regarded this species as one of the most common of the Owls\r\nin the lower parts of Pennsylvania, where it was particularly numerous\r\nin winter, among the woods that border the extensive meadows of the\r\nSchuylkill and the Delaware River. He frequently observed it flying\r\nduring the day, when it seemed to be able to see quite distinctly. He\r\nmet with more than forty of these birds in one spring, either flying\r\nor sitting exposed in the daytime, and once discovered one of its\r\nnests situated in the crotch of a white oak, among thick foliage, and\r\ncontaining three young. It was rudely put together, made outwardly\r\nof sticks, intermixed with dry grasses and leaves, and lined with\r\nsmaller twigs. He adds that this Owl screams in the day in the manner\r\nof a Hawk. Nuttall characterizes their peculiar hooting as a loud\r\nguttural call, which he expresses by _’koh-’koh-’ko-’ko-’ho_, or as\r\n_’whah-’whah-’whah-’whah-aa_, heard occasionally both by day and by\r\nnight. It is a note of recognition, and may be easily imitated, and can\r\nbe used as a means to decoy the birds. Nuttall received a specimen that\r\nhad been shot in November, hovering, in the daytime, over a covey of\r\nQuail.\r\n\r\nMr. Audubon speaks of the peculiar hooting cries of this species as\r\nstrangely ludicrous in sound, and as suggestive of an affected burst of\r\nlaughter. He adds that he has frequently seen this nocturnal marauder\r\nalight within a few yards of his camp-fire, exposing its whole body to\r\nthe glare of the light, and eying him in a very curious manner, and\r\nwith a noticeable liveliness and oddness of motion. In Louisiana, where\r\nhe found them more abundant than anywhere else, Mr. Audubon states\r\nthat, should the weather be lowering, and indicative of the approach of\r\nrain, their cries are so multiplied during the day, and especially in\r\nthe evening, and they respond to each other in tones so strange, that\r\none might imagine some extraordinary _fête_ was about to take place\r\namong them. At this time their gesticulations are said to be of a very\r\nextraordinary nature.\r\n\r\nThe flight of this Owl is described as remarkably smooth, light,\r\nnoiseless, and capable of being greatly protracted. So very lightly\r\ndo they fly, that Mr. Audubon states he has frequently discovered one\r\npassing over him, and only a few yards distant, by first seeing its\r\nshadow on the ground, in the bright moonlight, when not the faintest\r\nrustling of its wings could be heard.\r\n\r\nThis Owl has the reputation of being very destructive to poultry,\r\nespecially to half-grown chickens. In Louisiana they are said to nest in\r\nMarch, laying their eggs about the middle of the month. Audubon states\r\nthat they nest in hollow trees on the dust of the decomposed wood, and\r\nat other times take possession of the deserted nest of a crow, or of a\r\nRed-tailed Hawk. In New England I think they construct their own nest.\r\nMr. William Street, of Easthampton, Mass., has twice found the nest of\r\nthis Owl. On one occasion it had young, unfledged. Upon returning to get\r\nthem, a few days later, they had disappeared, and as he conjectures, had\r\nbeen removed by their parents. Another time he found a nest in a lofty\r\npine, and at a height of sixty feet. He saw and shot the old bird. He\r\nhas often found them hiding themselves by day in a thick hemlock. In\r\nthe winter of 1869, Mr. Street witnessed a singular contest between a\r\nBarred Owl and a Goshawk over a Grouse which the latter had killed, but\r\nof which the Owl contested the possession. The Hawk had decidedly the\r\nadvantage in the fight, when the contest was arrested by shooting the\r\nOwl. He has noticed a pair of Barred Owls in his neighborhood for the\r\npast four years, and has never known them to hoot from the time they\r\nhave reared their young to the 14th of February. They then begin about\r\nan hour after dark, and their hooting continues to increase until about\r\nthe 8th of April, when they mate, at which time their hooting may be\r\nheard both day and night. There is a very great difference observable\r\nbetween the cries of the female and the utterances of the male. The\r\nlatter seldom hoots, and there is as much difference between his voice\r\nand that of the female as between the crowing of a young bird and of the\r\nold cock.\r\n\r\nIn two instances I have known well-developed eggs of this Owl taken from\r\nthe oviduct of the female in February. One of these cases occurred near\r\nNiagara Falls in the spring of 1852. The other, in 1854, was noticed by\r\nProfessor William Hopkins, then of Auburn, N. Y., to whose kindness I\r\nwas indebted for the egg the parentage of which is so unquestionable.\r\nIt is purely white, almost globular, and, except in shape, hardly\r\ndistinguishable from the egg of the domestic Hen. It is 2.00 inches in\r\nlength, and 1.69 in breadth.\r\n\r\n\r\nSyrnium occidentale, XANTUS.\r\n\r\nWESTERN BARRED OWL; SPOTTED OWL.\r\n\r\n  _Syrnium occidentale_, XANTUS, P. A. N. S.

Eyebrows and face\r\ngrayish-white; lores and eyelids blackish. Lower parts white, becoming\r\npale ochraceous on the legs; sides of the breast, sides, flanks, and\r\nlower tail-coverts with daubs of brown (slightly lighter and more\r\nreddish than on the back), those of the breast somewhat transverse, but\r\nposteriorly they are decidedly longitudinal; front of tarsus clouded\r\nwith brown.

The colors of the European bird are very much paler; the legs\r\nare white, scarcely variegated, instead of ochraceous, thickly spotted;\r\nthe lower tail-coverts have merely shaft-streaks of brown, instead of\r\nbroad stripes. Very perfect specimens from Europe enable me to make a\r\nsatisfactory comparison.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Nyctale richardsoni._]\r\n\r\nFrom an article by Mr. D. G. Elliot in Ibis (1872, p. 48), it would\r\nappear that the young of _N. tengmalmi_ is very different from the\r\nadult in being darker and without spots; a stripe from the eye over\r\nthe nostrils, and a patch under the eye at the base of bill, white. It\r\nis probable, therefore, that the American race has a similar plumage,\r\nwhich, however, has as yet escaped the honor of a name; more fortunate\r\nthan the young of _N. acadica_, which boasts a similar plumage. This\r\n(_N. albifrons_) Mr. Elliot erroneously refers to the _N. tengmalmi_,\r\njudging from specimens examined by him from the Alps, from Russia, and\r\nfrom Norway. The most striking difference, judging from the description,\r\napart from that of size, appears to be in the whiter bill of the\r\n_tengmalmi_.\r\n\r\nHABITS. This race is an exclusively northern bird, peculiar to North\r\nAmerica, and rarely met with in the limits of the United States. A few\r\nspecimens only have been obtained in Massachusetts. Dr. Hoy mentions\r\nit as a bird of Wisconsin, and on the Pacific Dr. Townsend met with it\r\nas far south as Oregon, where it seems to be more abundant than on the\r\neastern coast.\r\n\r\nMr. Boardman thinks that this Owl is probably a resident in the vicinity\r\nof Calais, where, however, it is not common. It was not taken by\r\nProfessor Verrill at Norway, Maine. Mr. J. A. Allen regards it as a very\r\nrare winter visitant in Western Massachusetts, but obtained a specimen\r\nnear Springfield in December, 1859. In the same winter another was\r\nshot near Boston, and one by Dr. Wood, near Hartford, Conn. Mr. Allen\r\nsubsequently records the capture of a specimen in Lynn, Mass., by Mr. J.\r\nSouthwick, in the winter of 1863, and mentions two other specimens, also\r\ntaken within the limits of the State. It is not mentioned by Dr. Cooper\r\nas among the birds of California.\r\n\r\nSpecimens of this Owl were taken at Fort Simpson in May, and at Fort\r\nResolution by Mr. B. R. Ross, at Big Island by Mr. J. Reid, at Fort\r\nRae by Mr. L. Clarke, and at Fort Yukon by Mr. J. Lockhart and Mr. J.\r\nMcDougall, and at Selkirk Settlement, in February and March, by Mr.\r\nDonald Gunn.\r\n\r\nMr. B. R. Ross states that though no specimens of this Owl were received\r\nfrom north of Fort Simpson, yet he is quite certain that it ranges to\r\nthe Arctic Circle. He says it is a fierce bird, and creates great havoc\r\namong the flocks of Linnets and other small birds. Its nest is built on\r\ntrees, and the eggs are three or four in number, of a pure white color\r\nand nearly round shape. It sometimes seizes on the deserted hole of a\r\nWoodpecker for a habitation.\r\n\r\nMr. Dall obtained a female specimen of this Owl at Nulato, April 28,\r\nwhere it was not uncommon. It was often heard crying in the evenings,\r\nalmost like a human being, and was quite fearless. It could be readily\r\ntaken in the hand without its making any attempt to fly away, but it\r\nhad a habit of biting viciously. It was frequently seen in the daytime\r\nsitting on trees. According to the Indians, it generally nests in holes\r\nin dead trees, and lays six spherical white eggs. Richardson informs us\r\nthat it inhabits all the wooded country from Great Slave Lake to the\r\nUnited States, and is very common on the banks of the Saskatchewan. It\r\nwas obtained in Canada by the Countess of Dalhousie, but at what season\r\nthe bird was met with is not stated; the Smithsonian Institution also\r\npossesses specimens from the vicinity of Montreal. It probably does not\r\nbreed so far south as that place, or, if so, very rarely. Mr. Audubon\r\nprocured a specimen near Bangor, Maine, in September, the only one he\r\never met with.\r\n\r\nThis Owl, according to Mr. Hutchins, builds a nest of grass half-way up\r\na pine-tree, and lays two eggs in the month of May.\r\n\r\nA drawing, taken by Mr. Audubon from a specimen in an English cabinet,\r\nrepresents a nearly spherical egg, the color of which is white with a\r\nslight tinge of yellowish, and which measures 1.18 inches in length by\r\none inch in breadth.\r\n\r\nThe only authenticated eggs of this variety which have come under my\r\nnotice are three collected at Fort Simpson, May 4, 1861, by B. R. Ross.\r\nOne of these measures 1.28 by 1.06 inches.\r\n\r\n\r\nNyctale acadica, BONAP.\r\n\r\nSAW-WHET OWL; WHITE-FRONTED OWL; KIRTLAND’S OWL.\r\n\r\n  _Strix acadica_, GMEL. Syst.

Upper surface plain soft reddish-olive, almost exactly as in\r\n_N. richardsoni_; forehead, anterior part of the crown, and the facial\r\ncircle, with each feather with a short medial line of white; feathers\r\nof the neck white beneath the surface, forming a collar of blotches;\r\nlower webs of scapulars white bordered with brown; wing-coverts with a\r\nfew rounded white spots; alula with the outer feathers broadly edged\r\nwith white. Primary coverts and secondaries perfectly plain; five\r\nouter primaries with semi-rounded white spots on the outer webs, these\r\ndecreasing toward the ends of the feathers, leaving but about four\r\nseries well defined. Tail crossed with three widely separated narrow\r\nbands of white, formed of spots not touching the shaft on either web;\r\nthe last band is terminal. “Eyebrow” and sides of the throat white;\r\nlores with a blackish suffusion, this more concentrated around the eye;\r\nface dirty white, feathers indistinctly edged with brownish, causing\r\nan obsoletely streaked appearance; the facial circle in its extension\r\nacross the throat is converted into reddish-umber spots. Lower parts,\r\ngenerally, silky-white, becoming fine ochraceous on the tibiæ and tarsi;\r\nsides of the breast like the back, but of a more reddish or burnt-sienna\r\ntint; sides and flanks with longitudinal daubs of the same; jugulum,\r\nabdomen, lower tail-coverts, tarsi, and tibiæ, immaculate. Wing formula,\r\n4–3=5–1=8. Wing, 5.40; tail, 2.80; culmen, .50; tarsus, .80; middle toe,\r\n.60.\r\n\r\nSeven specimens before me vary from, wing, 5.25 to 5.80; tail, 2.60 to\r\n3.00 (♀). The largest specimen is 12,053 (♀, Fort Tejon, California; J.\r\nXantus). This differs from the specimen described in whiter face, more\r\nconspicuous white streaks on forehead, smaller, less numerous, red spots\r\nbelow, and in having a fourth white band on the tail; this, however, is\r\nvery inconspicuous. 32,301 (Moose Factory; J. McKenzie), 9,152 (Fort\r\nVancouver, February; Dr. J. G. Cooper), and 11,793 (Simiahmoo, October;\r\nDr. C. B. Kennedy) are exactly like the type. There are no authentic\r\nmales before me, though only two are marked as females; the extremes of\r\nthe series probably represent the sexual discrepancy in size.\r\n\r\n_Young_ (♂, 12,814, Racine, Wisconsin, July, 1859; Dr. R. P. Hoy). Upper\r\nsurface continuous plain dark sepia-olive; face darker, approaching\r\nfuliginous-vandyke,—perfectly uniform; around the edge of the forehead,\r\na few shaft-lines of white; scapulars with a concealed spot of pale\r\nochraceous on lower web; lower feathers of wing-coverts with a few\r\nwhite spots; outer feather of the alula scalloped with white; primary\r\ncoverts perfectly plain; five outer primaries with white spots on outer\r\nwebs, these diminishing toward the end of the feathers, leaving only\r\ntwo or three series well defined; tail darker than the wings, with\r\nthree narrow bands composed of white spots, these not touching the\r\nshaft on either web. “Eyebrows” immaculate white; lores more dusky;\r\nface and eyelids dark vandyke-brown; sides of the chin white. Throat\r\nand whole breast like the back, but the latter paler medially, becoming\r\nhere more fulvous; rest of the lower parts plain fulvous-ochraceous,\r\ngrowing gradually paler posteriorly,—immaculate. Lining of the wing\r\nplain dull white; under surface of primaries with dusky prevailing, but\r\nthis crossed by bands of large whitish spots; the three outer feathers,\r\nhowever, present a nearly uniformly dusky aspect, being varied only\r\nbasally. Wing formula, 3, 4–2=5 6–7, 1. Wing, 5.50; tail, 2.80; culmen,\r\n.45; tarsus, .80; middle toe, .65.\r\n\r\nHAB. North America generally. Cold temperate portions in the\r\nbreeding-season, migrating southward in winter. Mexico (Oaxaca, SCLATER,\r\nP. Z. S. 1858, 295); California (DR. COOPER); Cantonment Burgwyn, New\r\nMexico (DR. ANDERSON); Washington Territory (DR. KENNERLY).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Nyctale acadica._ Young.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Nyctale acadica._ Adult.]\r\n\r\nA specimen (15,917, ♂, Dr. C. B. Kennerly, Camp Skagitt, September\r\n29, 1859) from Washington Territory is exactly similar to the young\r\ndescribed above. No. 10,702 (Fort Burgwyn, New Mexico; Dr. Anderson)\r\nis much like it, but the facial circle is quite conspicuous, the\r\nfeathers having medial white lines; the reddish-olive of the breast\r\nand the fulvous of the belly are paler, also, than in the type. No.\r\n12,866, United States, (Professor Baird’s collection, from Audubon,) is\r\nperfectly similar to the last.\r\n\r\nMy reasons for considering the _N. albifrons_ as the young of _N.\r\nacadica_ are the following (see American Naturalist, May, 1872):—\r\n\r\n1st. All specimens examined (including Hoy’s type of _N. kirtlandi_)\r\nare young birds, as is unmistakably apparent from the texture of their\r\nplumage.\r\n\r\n2d. All specimens examined of the _N. acadica_ are adults. I have seen\r\nno description of the young.\r\n\r\n3d. The geographical distribution, the size and proportions, the pattern\r\nof coloration (except that of the head and body, which in all Owls is\r\nmore or less different in the young and adult stages), and the shades\r\nof colors on the general upper plumage, are the same in both. The white\r\n“scalloping” on the outer web of the alula, the number of white spots on\r\nthe primaries, and the precise number and position of the white bars on\r\nthe tail, are features common to the two.\r\n\r\n4th. The most extreme example of _albifrons_ has the facial circle\r\nuniform brown, like the neck, has no spots on the forehead, and the face\r\nis entirely uniform dark brown; but,\r\n\r\n5th. Three out of the four specimens in the collection have the facial\r\ncircle composed of white and brown streaks (adult feathers), precisely\r\nas in _acadica_, and the forehead similarly streaked (with adult\r\nfeathers). Two of them have new feathers appearing upon the sides of the\r\nbreast (beneath the brown patch), as well as upon the face; these new\r\nfeathers are, in the most minute respects, like the common (adult) dress\r\nof _N. acadica_.\r\n\r\nThe above facts point conclusively to the identity of the _Nyctale\r\n“albifrons”_ and _N. acadica_. This species is easily distinguishable\r\nfrom the _N. tengmalmi_, which belongs to both continents, though\r\nthe North American and European specimens are readily separable, and\r\ntherefore should be recognized as geographical races.\r\n\r\nSince the above was published in the American Naturalist for May, 1872,\r\nDr. J. W. Velie, of Chicago, writing under date of November 20, 1872,\r\nfurnishes the following proof of the identity of _N. “albifrons”_ and\r\n_N. acadica_: “In 1868, I kept a fine specimen of “_Nyctale albifrons_”\r\nuntil it moulted and became a fine specimen of _Nyctale acadica_. I had,\r\nuntil the fire, all the notes about this interesting little species, and\r\nphotographs in the different stages of moulting.”\r\n\r\nHABITS. The Little Acadian or Saw-Whet Owl, as this bird is more\r\ngenerally denominated, appears to have a widespread distribution over\r\ntemperate North America. It is not known to be anywhere very abundant,\r\nthough its nocturnal and secluded habits tend to prevent any intimate\r\nacquaintance either with its habits or its numbers in any particular\r\nlocality. It is rarely found in the daytime out of its hiding-places. It\r\nwas not met with by Richardson in the fur regions, yet it is generally\r\nsupposed to be a somewhat northern species, occurring only in winter\r\nsouth of Pennsylvania, but for this impression there does not seem to be\r\nany assignable reason or any confirmatory evidence. It has been said to\r\nbreed near Cleveland, Ohio, and its nest and eggs to have been secured.\r\nThe taking of Kirtland’s Owl, which is now known to be the immature bird\r\nof this species, near that city, as well as in Racine, and at Hamilton,\r\nCanada, is also suggestive that this Owl may breed in those localities.\r\n\r\nDr. Townsend is said to have found this Owl in Oregon, Dr. Gambel met\r\nwith it in California, Mr. Audubon has taken it both in Kentucky and\r\nin Louisiana, Mr. Wilson met with it in New Jersey, Mr. McCulloch in\r\nNova Scotia, and Dr. Hoy in Wisconsin. Dr. Newberry met with this\r\nbird in Oregon, but saw none in California. Dr. Suckley obtained it\r\nat the Dalles, on the north side of the Columbia, in December. This\r\nwas several miles from the timbered region, and the bird was supposed\r\nto be living in the basaltic cliffs of the vicinity. Dr. Cooper found\r\none at Vancouver in February. It was dead, and had apparently died of\r\nstarvation. Professor Snow speaks of it as rare in Kansas. Mr. Boardman\r\nand Professor Verrill both give it as resident and as common in Maine.\r\nIt is rather occasional and rare in Eastern Massachusetts, and Mr. Allen\r\ndid not find it common near Springfield. On one occasion I found one of\r\nthese birds in April, at Nahant. It was apparently migrating, and had\r\nsought shelter in the rocky cliffs of that peninsula. It was greatly\r\nbewildered by the light, and was several times almost on the point of\r\nbeing captured by hand.\r\n\r\nThis Owl is not unfrequently kept in confinement. It seems easily\r\nreconciled to captivity, becomes quite tame, suffers itself to be\r\nhandled by strangers without resenting the familiarity, but is greatly\r\nexcited at the sight of mice or rats. Captain Bland had one of these\r\nbirds in captivity at Halifax, which he put into the same room with a\r\nrat. The bird immediately attacked and killed the rat, but died soon\r\nafter of exhaustion.\r\n\r\nThe notes of this Owl, during the breeding-season, are said to resemble\r\nthe noise made by the filing of a saw, and it is known in certain\r\nlocalities as the Saw-Whet. Mr. Audubon, on one occasion, hearing these\r\nnotes in a forest, and unaware of their source, imagined he was in the\r\nvicinity of a saw-mill.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Audubon, this Owl breeds in hollow trees, or in the\r\ndeserted nests of other birds; and lays from four to six glossy-white\r\neggs, which are almost spherical. He states, also, that he found near\r\nNatchez a nest in the broken stump of a small decayed tree not more than\r\nfour feet high. He also mentions the occasional occurrence of one of\r\nthese Owls in the midst of one of our crowded cities. One of them was\r\nthus taken in Cincinnati, where it was found resting on the edge of a\r\nchild’s cradle. Mr. McCulloch, quoted by Audubon, gives an interesting\r\naccount of the notes and the ventriloquial powers of this bird. On one\r\noccasion he heard what seemed to him to be the faint notes of a distant\r\nbell. Upon approaching the place from which these sounds proceeded, they\r\nappeared at one time to be in front of him, then behind him, now on his\r\nright hand, now on his left, again at a great distance, and then close\r\nbehind him. At last he discovered the bird at the entrance of a small\r\nhole in a birch-tree, where it was calling to its mate. As he stood\r\nat the foot of the tree, in full sight of the bird, he observed the\r\nsingular power it possessed of altering its voice, making it seem near\r\nor remote,—a faculty which he had never noticed in any other bird.\r\n\r\nAn egg given me by Mr. Rufus E. Winslow as one of this bird, and figured\r\nin the North American Oölogy, was undoubtedly that of a Woodpecker.\r\nIt is of a crystalline whiteness, nearly spherical, and measures 1.13\r\ninches in length by .87 of an inch in breadth.\r\n\r\nA well-identified egg in the collection of the Smithsonian Institution,\r\ntaken by Mr. R. Christ at Nazareth, Penn., (No. 14,538, S. I.,) measures\r\n.95 of an inch by .88. The two ends are exactly similar or symmetrical.\r\nThe egg is white, and is marked as having been collected April 25, 1867.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS SCOPS, SAVIGNY.\r\n\r\n  _Scops_, SAVIGNY, 1809.

CHAR. _Adult._ Ground-color above brownish-cinereous, palest on\r\nthe head, purest ashy on the wings, minutely mottled with fine zigzag\r\ntransverse bars of black, each feather with a medial ragged stripe\r\nof the same along the shaft. Inner webs of ear-tufts, outer webs of\r\nscapulars, and oval spots occupying most of the outer webs of the two or\r\nthree lower feathers of the middle and secondary wing-coverts, white,\r\nforming (except on the first) conspicuous spots, those of the scapulars\r\nbordered with black. Secondaries crossed with about seven regular paler\r\nbands, each enclosing a more irregular dusky one; the ground-color,\r\nhowever, is so mottled with grayish, and the pale bands with dusky,\r\nthat they are by no means sharply defined or conspicuous, though they\r\nare very regular; alula and primary coverts more sharply barred with\r\ncream-colored spots, those on the former nearly white; primaries with\r\nbroad quadrate spots of creamy-white on outer webs, these forming from\r\nseven (♂) to eight (♀) transverse bands, the last of which is not\r\nterminal. Tail more irregularly mottled than the wings, and crossed by\r\nseven (♂) to eight (♀) narrow, obsolete, but continuous, pale bands.\r\n\r\nEyebrows white, the feathers bordered with dusky (most broadly so in\r\n♂); cheeks, ear-coverts, and lower throat dull white, with transverse\r\nbars of blackish (most numerous in the ♂); chin immaculate; upper eyelid\r\ndark brown; facial circle black; neck and jugulum like the cheeks, but\r\nmore strongly barred, and with blackish along the shaft. Ground-color\r\nof the lower parts white, each feather with a medial stripe of black,\r\nthis throwing off distinct bars to the edge of the feather; the medial\r\nblack is largest on sides of the breast, where it expands into very\r\nlarge conspicuous spots, having a slight rusty exterior suffusion; the\r\nabdomen medially, the anal region, and the lower tail-coverts, are\r\nalmost unvaried white. Tibiæ and tarsi in the male dull white, much\r\nbarred transversely with blackish; in the female, pale ochraceous, more\r\nsparsely barred with dark brownish. Lining of the wing creamy-white,\r\nvaried only along the edge; light bars on under surface of primaries\r\nvery obsolete.\r\n\r\n♂ (16,027, Fort Crook, North California; John Feilner). Wing, 6.70;\r\ntail, 3.80; culmen, .61; tarsus, 1.35; middle toe, .72; ear-tufts, 1.00;\r\nwing-formula, 3=4, 5–2, 6, 1=9. “Length, 9.50; extent, 23.75.”\r\n\r\n♀ (18,299, Hellgate, Montana; Jno. Pearsall). Wing, 7.80; tail, 4.10;\r\nculmen, .70; tarsus, 1.70; middle toe, .80; ear-tufts, 1.00.\r\n\r\n_Young_ ♂ (No. 29,738, Wood’s Hole, Mass., July 25, 1863; S. F. Baird.\r\n“Parent gray”). Secondaries, primaries, and tail, as in the adult,\r\ngray plumage; but the latter more mottled, the bands confused. Rest of\r\nthe plumage everywhere grayish-white, with numerous transverse bars of\r\ndusky-brown; eyebrows and lores scarcely variegated dull white; facial\r\ncircle obsolete.\r\n\r\n♀ (41,891, Philadelphia, Penn.; J. Krider). Whole head, neck, back,\r\nrump, and entire lower parts transversely barred with dark brown and\r\ngrayish-white, the bands of the former on the upper parts rather\r\nexceeding the white in width, but on the lower surface much narrower;\r\nscapulars with large transverse spots of white on the outer webs. Wings\r\nand tail as in the adult. Facial disk conspicuous. (More advanced in age\r\nthan the preceding.)\r\n\r\n\r\n_b._ _Rufescent plumage._\r\n\r\n_Adult._ General pattern of the preceding; but the grayish tints\r\nreplaced by lateritious-rufous, very fine and bright, with a slight\r\nvinaceous cast: this is uniform, and shows no trace of the transverse\r\ndark mottling; there are, however, black shaft-lines to the feathers\r\n(these most conspicuous on the head above, and scapulars, and narrower\r\nand more sharply defined than in the gray plumage). The inner webs\r\nof the ear-tufts, outer webs of scapulars, and lower secondary and\r\nmiddle wing-coverts, are white, as in the gray plumage; those of the\r\nscapulars are also bordered with black. The secondaries, primaries,\r\nand tail are less bright rufous than the other portions, the markings\r\nas in the gray plumage, only the tints being different. The upper\r\neyelid, and, in fact, all round the eye, fine light rufous; cheeks and\r\near-coverts paler, scarcely variegated; black facial circle rather\r\nnarrower than in the gray plumage. Lower parts without the transverse\r\nbars of the gray plumage, but in their place an irregular clouding of\r\nfine light red, like the back; the lower parts medially (very broadly)\r\nimmaculate snowy-white; most of the feathers having the red spotting\r\nshow black shaft-stripes, but the pectoral spots are not near so large\r\nor conspicuous as in the gray bird. Tibiæ fine pale ochraceous-rufous;\r\ntarsi the same posteriorly, in front white with cuneate specks of\r\nrufous; lower tail-coverts each with a medial transversely cordate spot\r\nof dilute rufous, the shaft black. Lining of the wing with numerous\r\nrufous spots.\r\n\r\n♂ (12,045, Washington, D. C., January). Wing, 6.30; tail, 3.00.\r\n\r\n♀ (22,512, Maryland; R. G. Campbell). Wing, 6.70; tail, 3.50.\r\n\r\n_Young_ (29,792, Peoria, Illinois; Ferd. Bischoff). Wings and tail as in\r\nadult; markings on head and body as in the young gray bird, but white\r\nbars more reddish, and dark ones more brown.\r\n\r\nHAB. Temperate North America, from the South Atlantic States to Oregon,\r\nand from the northern United States to Texas. Replaced in the southern\r\nMiddle Province and Southern California by var. _maccalli_, in Florida\r\nby var. _floridana_, and on the northwestern coast region by var.\r\n_kennicotti_.\r\n\r\nLocalities: (?) Cuba (CABANIS, Journ. III, 465).\r\n\r\nThe above stages of plumage have caused ornithologists a great deal of\r\nperplexity; and it is only very recently that they have become correctly\r\nunderstood. Even yet many persist in regarding the red plumage as being\r\nthat of the young bird.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Scops asio._]\r\n\r\nThat these two very different plumages are entirely independent of\r\nage, sex, or season, and that they are purely individual, there can\r\nbe no doubt; since in one nest there may often be found both red and\r\ngray young ones, while their parents may be either both red or both\r\ngray, the male red and the female gray, or _vice versa_. Occasionally\r\nspecimens (such as No. 39,093, ♂, Neosho Falls, Kansas, April 13; parent\r\nof five eggs, and captured on the nest with a gray male) are exactly\r\nintermediate between these two plumages, it being difficult to decide\r\nwhich predominates; the combination is not only of the tints, but of the\r\nmarkings, of the two stages.\r\n\r\nHABITS.

The species is represented in the\r\ncollection by but four specimens, two adult and two young. I have not\r\nseen the red plumage as described by Cassin.\r\n\r\nThe characters of this race, as given in the diagnosis, appear to be\r\nreally constant; and there is not a specimen in the series of those from\r\nthe west which may not readily be referred to one or the other.\r\n\r\nThe gray adult _maccalli_ differs from that of _asio_ in the much\r\nfiner mottling of the general plumage; the medial black stripes of the\r\nfeathers above being more sharply defined, and more distinct from the\r\ntransverse zigzags. Below, the transverse dark bars are much finer, and\r\nnearer together. The face, neck, and jugulum more finely and uniformly\r\nbarred. The white scapular spots have not the black border seen in\r\n_asio_. The size is smaller.\r\n\r\nThe young of _maccalli_ differs from that of _asio_ in much finer bars\r\nabove, the dusky rather prevailing; below, also, the bars are finer and\r\nnearer together.\r\n\r\nIt is not necessary to compare this bird with any other than the _S.\r\nasio_, since it is not at all related to _choliba_, or any other\r\nsouthern species.\r\n\r\n_Scops maccalli_ is entirely distinct from the _S. trichopsis_, Wagler,\r\nnotwithstanding the statement in the Ibis, for April, 1872 (p. 6),\r\nthat “the name” is “really synonymous with _S. trichopsis_ of Wagler,\r\nthe bird being quite distinct from _S. asio_, as has been pointed out\r\nelsewhere.” (P.

Above umber-brown, with a reddish cast;\r\nfeathers confusedly mottled transversely with dusky, and showing rounded\r\nspots of rufous, most conspicuous on the nape; each feather with a\r\nconspicuous medial broad ragged stripe of black, these stripes most\r\nconspicuous on the forehead and scapulars; outer webs of scapulars\r\nlight rufous, bordered terminally with black. Wings of a more grayish\r\ncast than the back, but similarly variegated; lower feathers of the\r\nmiddle and secondary wing-coverts, each with a large oval pale rufous\r\nspot, covering most of the lower web. Secondaries crossed by six narrow\r\nobscure bands of pale rufous; primaries with seven somewhat rounded,\r\nquadrate spots of the same on the outer webs, forming as many transverse\r\nseries; each light spot with a central dusky mottling. Tail more finely\r\nand confusedly mottled than the wings; the bands, though present, are so\r\nobsolete as to be scarcely traceable, and so irregular or badly defined\r\nas to be of uncertain number. The ear-tufts are black and rusty, the\r\nformer along the shafts, and in transverse spots; on the outer webs the\r\nblack predominates, on the inner the rusty.\r\n\r\nThe lores and basal half of the frontal bristles are white, the terminal\r\nhalf abruptly black; eyebrows about equally blackish and paler, the\r\nformer bordering the feathers; eye surrounded by dark snuff-brown;\r\ncheeks and ear-coverts pale rusty, transversely barred with deeper\r\nrusty; facial circle not well defined, black.

Wing-formula the\r\nsame as in type.\r\n\r\nHAB. Northwestern coast of North America, from Columbia River,\r\nnorthward; Idaho (Dr. Whitehead).\r\n\r\nNo. 4,530 (Washington Territory; Dr. Geo. Suckley) is just intermediate\r\nin all respects between typical _kennicotti_ and _asio_, being\r\nreferrible to either with equal propriety, though perhaps inclining most\r\nto the former.\r\n\r\nThis well-marked form is, according to recognized laws, properly to be\r\nregarded as only an extremely dark northwestern form of _Scops asio_.\r\nThere is no deviation from the specific pattern of coloration, the\r\ndifference being merely in the tints; while in this it corresponds in\r\nevery way with other species as modified in the northwest coast region;\r\nthe somewhat greater size, too, merely results from its more northern\r\nhabitat.\r\n\r\nThe only characters which we find in _kennicotti_ which cannot be\r\nrecognized in _asio_ are the smaller, more quadrate, and more rufous\r\nspots on the primaries, and more obsolete bands on the tail; but this is\r\nmerely the consequence of the greater extension of the brown markings,\r\nthus necessarily contrasting the lighter spots. In these respects only\r\ndoes the Washington Territory specimen differ from the two typical\r\nexamples before us, having the larger, more whitish, spots on primaries,\r\nand more distinct tail-bands, of _asio_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Scops asio_, var. _kennicotti_.]\r\n\r\nThe _Scops kennicotti_ must, however, be recognized as a well-marked\r\ngeographical race, and, not taking into consideration any natural laws\r\nwhich influence changes in species, it would be very proper to recognize\r\nthe validity of the present bird. If, however, the rule of which we\r\nspeak will apply to others, as indeed it does to a majority of the\r\nbirds of the region inhabited by the _Scops kennicotti_, the extreme\r\nconditions of some species of which are even more widely different than\r\nin the present instance, and which have been referred to their lighter\r\nrepresentatives in consequence of the applicability of this law, we\r\ncannot possibly do otherwise with it.\r\n\r\nIn general appearance, size, and proportions, as well as in pattern and\r\ntints of coloration, except in their details, there is a wonderfully\r\nclose resemblance in this race of _S. asio_ to the _S. semitorques_,\r\nSchlegel, of Japan. Indeed, it is probable that the latter is also a\r\nmere geographical form of the same species. The only tangible points of\r\ndifference are that in _semitorques_ the jugulum is distinctly white\r\ncentrally, there is a quite well-defined lighter nuchal band, with a\r\nmore indistinct occipital one above it, and the pencillings on the\r\nlower parts are more delicate. The size and proportions are essentially\r\nthe same; the shades of color are identical, while the markings differ\r\nonly in minute detail, their pattern being essentially the same. In\r\n_kennicotti_ the light nuchal collars are indicated, though they do not\r\napproach the distinctness shown by them in _semitorques_. Should they\r\nbe considered as races of one species (_S. asio_), their differential\r\ncharacters may be expressed as follows:—\r\n\r\n  Var. _semitorques_.[26] A well-defined nuchal collar, of mottled pale\r\n  ochraceous; jugulum immaculate white centrally. Feathers of the lower\r\n  parts with their transverse pencillings growing fainter towards the\r\n  middle line, which is unvariegated white, from the central jugular\r\n  spot to the anal region. Wing, 6.60–7.10; tail, 3.60–3.70; culmen,\r\n  .60; tarsus, 1.25–1.40; middle toe, .80–.90. (Two specimens.) _Hab._\r\n  Japan.\r\n\r\n  Var. _kennicotti_. No well-defined nuchal band; jugulum closely\r\n  barred centrally; feathers of the lower parts with their transverse\r\n  pencillings not growing fainter toward the middle line, which\r\n  is unvariegated white only on the abdominal portion; the medial\r\n  black streaks to the feathers of the lower surface much broader,\r\n  and transverse pencillings rather coarser. Wing, 6.90–7.30; tail,\r\n  3.50–4.50; culmen, .60–.65; tarsus, 1.35–1.45; middle toe, .80–.90.\r\n  (Three specimens.) _Hab._ North Pacific coast of North America from\r\n  Sitka to Washington Territory, and Western Idaho.\r\n\r\nThe zoölogical characters of the different varieties of the _Scops asio_\r\nhaving been thus indicated, we proceed to consider the species as a\r\nwhole, and to point out the more important features of its habits and\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nHABITS. The common Mottled Owl has an extended distribution throughout\r\nthe temperate portion of North America. It is also the most numerous of\r\nthis family wherever found. It does not appear to have been detected\r\nin any part of the Arctic regions. Although given on the authority of\r\nFabricius as a bird of Greenland, it is not retained in the list of\r\nReinhardt. It was not met with by Richardson, nor is any reference made\r\nto it in any of the Arctic notes furnished by Mr. MacFarlane or others.\r\nIt is quite common throughout New England, as well as in the Central,\r\nthe Western, and some of the Southern States. Mr. Boardman gives it as\r\nresident, but not very common, near Calais, where it breeds. It is found\r\nnear Hamilton, Canada, according to McIlwraith, but it is not common,\r\nalthough Dr. Hall found it quite numerous in the vicinity of Montreal.\r\nMr. Downes does not mention its occurrence in Nova Scotia. It was found\r\nbreeding by Dr. Lincecum, at Long Point, Texas. It occurs in California,\r\nand as _Scops kennicotti_ as far to the northwest as Sitka.\r\n\r\nThe Mottled Owl is nocturnal in its habits, never appearing abroad in\r\nthe daylight except when driven out by the attacks of hostile birds that\r\nhave discovered it in its retreat. Its eyes cannot endure the light,\r\nand it experiences great inconvenience from such an exposure. During\r\nthe day it hides in hollow trees, in dark recesses in the forests, or\r\nin dark corners of barns, and comes out from its retreat just before\r\ndark. During the night it utters a very peculiar wailing cry, not unlike\r\nthe half-whining, half-barking complaints of a young puppy, alternating\r\nfrom high to low, intermingled with deep guttural trills. These cries,\r\nwhich are sometimes prolonged until after midnight, usually elicit\r\nan answer from its mate or companions, and would seem to be uttered\r\nas a call soliciting a reply from some lost associate. When kept in\r\nconfinement the Mottled Owl soon becomes familiarized to its new mode\r\nof life, and rarely attempts to injure its captors, though it will at\r\nfirst snap its bill in a threatening manner and manifest considerable\r\nirritation on being approached or handled. In the daytime they keep\r\nsecluded, appear sleepy or stupid, with half-closed eyes, but, as night\r\napproaches, become quite lively and eager for their food. They utter\r\ntheir nocturnal cries in confinement, the doleful sounds of which are in\r\nsingular contrast with the lively and excited air of the birds as they\r\nutter them. Their flight is noiseless and gliding, and they move in a\r\nmanner so nearly silent as to be hardly perceptible. They are excellent\r\nmousers, and swallow their food whole, ejecting the indigestible parts,\r\nsuch as hair, bones, feathers, etc.\r\n\r\nWilson caught an adult bird, and kept it in confinement some time. At\r\nfirst it was restless and attempted to escape, beating against the glass\r\nof the window repeatedly, and several times with so much violence as\r\nto stun itself. In a few days it was reconciled to its situation, and\r\nbecame quite tame and familiar, and in the evening was very lively,\r\nsprightly, and active.\r\n\r\nThe food of the Screech-Owl is chiefly small quadrupeds, insects, and\r\noccasionally, when they have young, small birds. They destroy a vast\r\nnumber of mice, beetles, and vermin, and are of great service to the\r\nagriculturist, although their services are not appreciated, and they are\r\neverywhere persecuted and hunted down without mercy or justice.\r\n\r\nThe nest of this species is usually constructed in hollow trees or\r\nstumps, most frequently in orchards in the vicinity of farm-houses, and\r\nnot more than six or seven feet from the ground. Mr. Audubon states,\r\nhowever, that he has sometimes found them at the height of thirty or\r\nforty. To show the provident habits of this Owl in procuring for its\r\nyoung a great superabundance of food, Mr. Nuttall mentions finding in\r\nthe hollow stump of an apple-tree, which contained a single brood of\r\nthese young Owls, several Bluebirds, Blackbirds, and Song-Sparrows.\r\n\r\nDr. Cooper, on the other hand, relates an instance where one of these\r\nOwls resided as an inmate in a dove-cot, where it was not known to do\r\nany injury to its inmates.\r\n\r\nThe Screech-Owl can hardly be said to construct any nest, but lines the\r\nhollow in which it rears its young with a few loose leaves, dry grasses,\r\nand feathers. The eggs are usually five or six in number; they are pure\r\nwhite, and nearly round. Their average measurement is 1.38 inches in\r\nlength by 1.19 in breadth.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the distinctive peculiarities of var. _maccalli_, we are\r\nin possession of but little information. Its habits probably do not\r\nessentially vary from those of the common _Scops asio_, which it so\r\nclosely resembles in other respects, and of which it is to be regarded\r\nas a geographical race. It was first taken by Mr. E. S. Holden, near\r\nSacramento, and described by Mr. Lawrence as the _Ephialtes choliba_\r\nof Vieillot. It has since been found in other parts of California,\r\nin Northern Mexico, Arizona, and on the Rio Grande. It was obtained\r\nin Tamaulipas—where it is evidently rather common—by the late Dr.\r\nBerlandier, who had also procured its eggs. A single specimen of this\r\nOwl was obtained by Mr. A. Schott in Texas, and Mr. Dresser also\r\nobtained two small Owls which he doubtfully refers to this variety,—one\r\nnear San Antonio, and the other in Bandera County. Lieutenant Bendire\r\nwrites that it is quite common in the vicinity of Tucson, Arizona,\r\nthough Dr. Coues did not meet with it. Dr. Kennerly observed it on\r\nBill Williams Fork, in New Mexico. It was there found living in the\r\nlarge _Cereus giganteus_ so common in that region, where it occupied\r\nthe deserted holes of various kinds of Woodpeckers. It rarely made its\r\nappearance during the day, and then only to show its head from the hole,\r\nready at any moment to disappear at the approach of danger. On one\r\noccasion it was observed among some very thick bushes near the water.\r\nIt does not appear to have been met with by Dr. Cooper in California,\r\nwhere he refers all the Owls of this genus to the common _asio_. A\r\nsingle individual, referred doubtfully to this bird, was taken by\r\nMr. Skinner in Guatemala. The eggs of this bird, taken in Tamaulipas\r\nby Dr. Berlandier, are of nearly globular shape, of a clear, almost\r\ncrystal-white color, and measure 1.13 inches in length by 0.93 of an\r\ninch in breadth. As compared with the eggs of _Scops asio_ they are much\r\nsmaller, their relative capacity being only as five to eight.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of the var. _asio_ vary greatly in size according to their\r\nlocality. Those taken in Florida are so much smaller than those from\r\nMassachusetts as almost to be suggestive of specific differences. An egg\r\nfrom Hudson, Mass., taken by Mr. Jillson in April, 1870, measures 1.50\r\nby 1.30 inches, while one from Monticello, Fla., taken by Mr. Samuel\r\nPasco, measures 1.30 by 1.15 inches. Mr. T. H. Jackson, of Westchester,\r\nPenn., informs me that he has found a nest of this Owl containing six\r\nfresh eggs, on the 5th of April.\r\n\r\n\r\nScops flammeola, LICHT.\r\n\r\nFEILNER’S OWL.\r\n\r\n  _Scops flammeola_, LICHT.

IX, 132).\r\n\r\nSpecimens from the regions indicated vary but little, the only two\r\npossessing differences of any note being one (58,747,[30] ♂) from\r\nSouthern Illinois, and one (33,218, San Jose; J. Carmiol) from Costa\r\nRica. The first differs from all those from the eastern United States\r\nin much deeper and darker shades of color, the rufous predominant\r\nbelow, the legs and crissum being of quite a deep shade of this color;\r\nthe transverse bars beneath are also very broad and pure black. This\r\nspecimen is more like Audubon’s figure than any other, and may possibly\r\nrepresent the peculiar style of the Lower Mississippi region. The Costa\r\nRica bird is remarkable for the predominance of the rufous on all\r\nparts of the plumage; the legs, however, are whitish, as in specimens\r\nfrom the Atlantic coast of the United States. These specimens cannot,\r\nhowever, be considered as anything else than merely local styles of the\r\n_virginianus_, var. _virginianus_.\r\n\r\n\r\nBubo virginianus, var. arcticus, SWAINS.\r\n\r\nWESTERN GREAT HORNED OWL.\r\n\r\n  _?

The _B. arcticus_ of Swainson was founded upon a\r\nspecimen of this kind, and it is our strong opinion that the Wapecuthu\r\nOwl of Pennant (_Strix wapecuthu_, Gmel.) was nothing else than a\r\nsimilar individual, which had accidentally lost the ear-tufts, since\r\nthere is no other discrepancy in the original description.

Pacific coast north of the Columbia; Labrador. A northern littoral\r\nform.\r\n\r\nA specimen from Labrador (34,958, Fort Niscopec, H. Connolly) is an\r\nextreme example of this well-marked variety. In this the rufous is\r\nentirely absent, the plumage consisting wholly of brownish-black and\r\nwhite, the former predominating; the jugulum and the abdomen medially\r\nare conspicuously snowy-white; the black bars beneath are broad, and\r\ntowards the end of each feather they become coalesced into a prevalent\r\nmottling, forming a spotted appearance.\r\n\r\nAnother (11,792, Simiahmoo, Dr. C. B. Kennerly) from Washington\r\nTerritory has the black even more prevalent than in the last, being\r\nalmost continuously uniform on the scapulars and lesser wing-coverts;\r\nbeneath the black bars are much suffused. In this specimen the rufous\r\ntinge is present, as it is in all except the Labrador skin.\r\n\r\nHABITS. The Great Horned Owl has an extended distribution throughout at\r\nleast the whole of North America from ocean to ocean, and from Central\r\nAmerica to the Arctic regions. Throughout this widely extended area it\r\nis everywhere more or less abundant, except where it has been driven out\r\nby the increase of population. In this wide distribution the species\r\nnaturally assumes varying forms and exhibits considerable diversities of\r\ncoloring. These are provided with distinctive names to mark the races,\r\nbut should all be regarded as belonging to one species, as they do not\r\npresent any distinctive variation in habit.\r\n\r\nSir John Richardson speaks of it as not uncommon in the Arctic regions.\r\nIt is abundant in Canada, and throughout all parts of the United States.\r\nDr. Gambel met with it also in large numbers in the wooded regions of\r\nUpper California. Dr. Heermann found it very common around Sacramento in\r\n1849, but afterwards, owing to the increase in population, it had become\r\ncomparatively rare. Dr. Woodhouse met with it in the Indian Territory,\r\nthough not abundantly. Lieutenant Couch obtained specimens in Mexico,\r\nand Mr. Schott in Texas.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Bubo virginianus._]\r\n\r\nIn the regions northwest of the Yukon River, Mr. Robert Kennicott\r\nfound a pair of these birds breeding on the 10th of April. The female\r\nwas procured, and proved to be of a dark plumage. The nest, formed\r\nof dry spruce branches retaining their leaves, was placed near the\r\ntop of a large green spruce, in thick woods. It was large, measuring\r\nthree or four feet across at base. The eggs were placed in a shallow\r\ndepression, which was lined with a few feathers. Two more eggs were\r\nfound in the ovary of the female,—one broken, the other not larger than\r\na musket-ball. The eggs were frozen on their way to the fort. Mr. Ross\r\nstates that he found this Owl very abundant around Great Slave Lake,\r\nbut that it became less common as they proceeded farther north. It was\r\nremarkably plentiful in the marshes around Fort Resolution. Its food\r\nconsisted of shrews and _Arvicolæ_, which are very abundant there. It is\r\nvery tame and easily approached, and the Chipewyan Indians are said to\r\neat with great relish the flesh, which is generally fat.\r\n\r\nMr. Gunn writes that this Owl is found over all the woody regions of the\r\nHudson Bay Territory. In the summer it visits the shores of the bay, but\r\nretires to some distance inland on the approach of winter. It hunts in\r\nthe dark, preying on rabbits, mice, muskrats, partridges, and any other\r\nfowls that it can find. With its bill it breaks the bones of hares into\r\nsmall pieces, which its stomach is able to digest. They pair in March,\r\nthe only time at which they seem to enjoy each other’s society. The nest\r\nis usually made of twigs in the fork of some large poplar, where the\r\nfemale lays from three to six pale-white eggs. It is easily approached\r\nin clear sunny weather, but sees very well when the sky is clouded. It\r\nis not mentioned by Mr. MacFarlane as found near Anderson River. Mr.\r\nDall caught alive several young birds not fully fledged, June 18, on the\r\nYukon River, below the fort. He also met with it at Nulato, where it was\r\nnot common, but was more plentiful farther up the river.\r\n\r\nMr. Salvin found this species in August at Duenas and at San Geronimo,\r\nin Guatemala. At Duenas it was said to be resident, and is so probably\r\nthroughout the whole country. It was not uncommon, and its favorite\r\nlocality was one of the hillsides near that village, well covered with\r\nlow trees and shrubs, and with here and there a rocky precipice. They\r\nwere frequently to be met with on afternoons, and at all hours of the\r\nnight they made their proximity known by their deep cry.\r\n\r\nDr. Kennerly found it in Texas in the cañon of Devil River, and he\r\nadds that it seemed to live indifferently among the trees and the high\r\nand precipitous cliffs. It was found throughout Texas and New Mexico,\r\nwherever there are either large trees or deep cañons that afforded\r\na hiding-place during the day. Attracted by the camp-fires of Dr.\r\nKennerly’s party, this Owl would occasionally sweep around their heads\r\nfor a while, and then disappear in the darkness, to resume its dismal\r\nnotes. Sometimes, frightened by the reverberating report of a gun, they\r\nwould creep among the rocks, attempting to conceal themselves, and be\r\nthus taken alive.\r\n\r\nThough frequently kept in captivity, the Great Horned Owl, even when\r\ntaken young, is fierce and untamable, resenting all attempts at\r\nfamiliarity. It has no affection for its mate, this being especially\r\ntrue of the female. Mr. Downes mentions an instance within his\r\nknowledge, in which a female of this species, in confinement, killed\r\nand ate the male. Excepting during the brief period of mating, they are\r\nnever seen in pairs.\r\n\r\nIts flight is rapid and graceful, and more like that of an eagle\r\nthan one of this family. It sails easily and in large circles. It is\r\nnocturnal in its habits, and is very rarely seen abroad in the day, and\r\nthen only in cloudy weather or late in the afternoon. When detected in\r\nits hiding-place by the Jay, Crow, or King-bird, and driven forth by\r\ntheir annoyances, it labors under great disadvantages, and flies at\r\nrandom in a hesitating flight, until twilight enables it to retaliate\r\nupon its tormentors. The hooting and nocturnal cries of the Great Horned\r\nOwl are a remarkable feature in its habits. These are chiefly during\r\nits breeding-season, especially the peculiar loud and vociferous cries\r\nknown as its hooting. At times it will utter a single shriek, sounding\r\nlike the yell of some unearthly being, while again it barks incessantly\r\nlike a dog, and the resemblance is so natural as to provoke a rejoinder\r\nfrom its canine prototype. Occasionally it utters sounds resembling\r\nthe half-choking cries of a person nearly strangled, and, attracted\r\nby the watchfire of a camp, fly over it, shrieking a cry resembling\r\n_waugh-hōō_. It is not surprising that with all these combinations and\r\nvariations of unearthly cries these birds should have been held in awe\r\nby the aborigines, their cries being sufficiently fearful to startle\r\neven the least timid.\r\n\r\nIt is one of the most destructive of the depredators upon the\r\npoultry-yard, far surpassing in this respect any of our Hawks. All its\r\nmischief is done at night, when it is almost impossible to detect and\r\npunish it. Whole plantations are often thus stripped in a single season.\r\n\r\nThe mating of this bird appears to have little or no reference to the\r\nseason. A pair has been known to select a site for their nest, and begin\r\nto construct a new one, or seize upon that of a Red-tailed Hawk, and\r\nrepair it, in September or October, keeping in its vicinity through the\r\nwinter, and making their presence known by their continued hooting.\r\nMr. Jillson found a female sitting on two eggs in February, in Hudson,\r\nMass.; and Mr. William Street, of Easthampton, in the spring of 1869,\r\nfound one of their nests on the 3d of March, the eggs in which had\r\nbeen incubated at least a week. If one nest is broken up, the pair\r\nimmediately seek another, and make a renewed attempt to raise a brood.\r\nThey rarely go more than a mile from their usual abode, and then only\r\nfor food. Mr. Street’s observations have led him to conclude that they\r\nmate about February 20, and deposit their eggs from the 25th to the\r\n28th. They cease to hoot in the vicinity of their nest from the time of\r\ntheir mating until their young have left them in June. On the 19th of\r\nMarch, 1872, Mr. Street found two of their eggs containing young nearly\r\nready to hatch.\r\n\r\nMr. Street’s observations satisfied him that the period of incubation of\r\nthis Owl is about three weeks. When they have young and are hard pressed\r\nfor food, they hunt by day as well as by night, and at this time they\r\nhoot a good deal. The young are ready to leave their nest about six\r\nweeks after hatching. At this time their feathers are nearly all grown,\r\nexcept their head-feathers, which have hardly started. In the spring of\r\n1872 Mr. Street found a young bird that had fallen from its nest. Though\r\nvery small it was untamable, and not to be softened by any attentions.\r\nIts savage disposition seemed to increase with age. It readily devoured\r\nall kinds of animal food, and was especially fond of fish and snakes. It\r\nwas remarkable for its cowardice, being always ridiculously fearful of\r\nthe smallest dog, the near approach of one always causing extravagant\r\nmanifestations of alarm. He was therefore led to conclude that it does\r\nnot prey upon quadrupeds larger than a hare, that it rarely is able to\r\nseize small birds, and that reptiles and fish form no inconsiderable\r\nportion of its food. The young Owl in question assumed its full plumage\r\nin November, when less than eight months old. It was of full size in all\r\nrespects except in the length of its claws, which were hardly half the\r\nusual size.\r\n\r\nMr. T. H. Jackson, of West Chester, Penn., has met with fresh eggs of\r\nthis Owl, February 13, 22, and 28, and has found young birds in their\r\nnests from the 2d of March to the 28th.\r\n\r\nMr. Audubon states that while the Great Horned Owl usually nests in\r\nlarge hollows of decayed trees, he has twice found the eggs in the\r\nfissures of rocks. In all these cases, little preparation had been made\r\nprevious to the laying of the eggs, the bed consisting of only a few\r\ngrasses and feathers. Wilson, who found them breeding in the swamps of\r\nNew Jersey, states that the nest was generally constructed in the fork\r\nof a tall tree, but sometimes in a smaller tree. They begin to build\r\ntowards the close of winter, and, even in the Arctic regions, Sir John\r\nRichardson speaks of their hatching their eggs as early as March. The\r\nshape of the egg is very nearly exactly spherical, and its color is a\r\ndull white with a slightly yellowish tinge. An egg formerly in the old\r\nPeale’s Museum of Philadelphia, taken in New Jersey by Alexander Wilson\r\nthe ornithologist, and bearing his autograph upon its shell, measures\r\n2.31 inches in length by 2.00 in breadth. Another, obtained in the\r\nvicinity of Salem, Mass., measures 2.25 inches in length by 1.88 in\r\nbreadth. In the latter instance the nest was constructed on a tall and\r\ninaccessible tree in a somewhat exposed locality. The female was shot on\r\nthe nest, and, as she fell, she clutched one of the eggs in a convulsive\r\ngrasp, and brought it in her claws to the ground. An egg obtained in\r\nTamaulipas, Mexico, on the Rio Grande, by Dr. Berlandier, measures 2.18\r\ninches in length by 1.81 in breadth.\r\n\r\nAn egg from Wisconsin, taken by Mr. B. F. Goss, may be considered as\r\nabout the average in size and color. It is nearly spherical, of a clear\r\nbluish-white, and measures 2.30 by 2.00 inches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =38256= ⅓\r\n\r\n_Otus wilsonianus._]\r\n\r\n\r\nNyctea scandiaca, var. arctica, GRAY.\r\n\r\nAMERICAN SNOWY OWL.\r\n\r\n  _Strix arctica_, BARTRAM, Trav. in Carolina, 1792, p. 285.\r\n  _Strix nyctea_, (not of LINN.!)

Not only are the\r\ndusky bars darker, but they are usually broader, and more extended over\r\nthe general surface.\r\n\r\nHABITS. This is an exclusively northern species, and is chiefly confined\r\nto the Arctic Circle and the adjacent portions of the temperate zone.\r\nIt is met with in the United States only in midwinter, and is much more\r\nabundant in some years than in others. Individual specimens have been\r\noccasionally noticed as far south as South Carolina, but very rarely. It\r\nhas also been observed in Kentucky, Ohio, the Bermuda Islands, and in\r\nnearly every part of the United States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Nyctea scandiaca._]\r\n\r\nIn the Arctic regions of North America and in Greenland it is quite\r\nabundant, and has been observed as far to the north as Arctic voyagers\r\nhave yet reached. Professor Reinhardt states that it is much more\r\nnumerous in the northern than in the southern part of Greenland. Sir\r\nJohn Richardson, who, during seven years’ residence in the Arctic\r\nregions, enjoyed unusual opportunities for studying the habits of this\r\nOwl, says that it hunts its prey in the daytime. It is generally found\r\non the Barren Grounds, but is always so wary as to be approached with\r\ndifficulty. In the wooded districts it is less cautious.\r\n\r\nMr. Downes states that this Owl is very abundant in Nova Scotia in\r\nwinter, and that it is known to breed in the neighboring province of\r\nNewfoundland. In some years it appears to traverse the country in large\r\nflocks. In the winter of 1861–62, he adds, these birds made their\r\nappearance in Canada in large numbers.\r\n\r\nMr. Boardman states that they are present in winter in the vicinity of\r\nCalais, but that they are not common. A pair was noticed in the spring\r\nof 1862 as late as the last of May, and, in Mr. Boardman’s opinion,\r\nwere breeding in that neighborhood. In the western part of Maine Mr.\r\nVerrill found it also rather rare, and met with it only in winter. He\r\nstates that it differs greatly in disposition from the Great Horned\r\nOwl, being naturally very gentle, and becoming very readily quite tame\r\nin confinement, differing very much in this respect from most large\r\n_Raptores_.\r\n\r\nIt makes its appearance in Massachusetts about the middle or last of\r\nNovember, and in some seasons is quite common, though never present\r\nin very large numbers. It is bold, but rather wary; coming into\r\nthick groves of trees in close proximity to cities, which indeed it\r\nfrequently enters, but keeping a sharp lookout, and never suffering a\r\nnear approach. It hunts by daylight, and appears to distinguish objects\r\nwithout difficulty. Its flight is noiseless, graceful, easy, and at\r\ntimes quite rapid. In some seasons it appears to wander over the whole\r\nof the United States east of the Rocky Mountains, Dr. Heermann having\r\nobtained a specimen of it near San Antonio, Texas, in the winter of\r\n1857.\r\n\r\nIt is more abundant, in winter, near the coast, than in the interior,\r\nand in the latter keeps in the neighborhood of rivers and streams,\r\nwatching by the open places for opportunities to catch fish. Mr. Audubon\r\ndescribes it as very expert and cunning in fishing, crouching on the\r\nedges of air-holes in the ice, and instantly seizing any fish that\r\nmay come to the surface. It also feeds on hares, squirrels, rats, and\r\nother small animals. It watches the traps set for animals, especially\r\nmuskrats, and devours them when caught. In the stomach of one Mr.\r\nAudubon found the whole of a large house-rat. Its own flesh, Mr. Audubon\r\naffirms, is fine and delicate, and furnishes very good eating. It is\r\ndescribed as a very silent bird, and Mr. Audubon has never known it to\r\nutter a note or to make any sound.\r\n\r\nRichardson states that a few remain in the Arctic regions even in\r\nmidwinter, but usually in the more sheltered districts, whither it has\r\nfollowed the Ptarmigan, on which it feeds. When seen on the Barren\r\nGrounds, it was generally squatting on the earth, and, if disturbed,\r\nalighted again after a short flight. In the more wooded districts it is\r\nsaid to be bolder, and is even known to watch the Grouse-shooters, and\r\nto share in their spoils, skimming from its perch on a high tree, and\r\ncarrying off the bird before the sportsman can get near it.\r\n\r\nMr. MacFarlane writes from Fort Anderson that he did not find this\r\nspecies abundant in that quarter, and that its eggs were unknown to him.\r\nMr. B. R. Ross speaks of this Owl as widely distributed, but not common.\r\nHe found it a winter resident, and has repeatedly seen it at that season\r\nnear Fort Resolution, and it has been shot in February at Fort Norman.\r\nIt is very destructive to the snares set by the Indians, eating the\r\nhares and breaking the snares, in which they are sometimes caught. The\r\nIndians are said to attract these birds near enough to be shot at, by\r\ntying a mouse or a piece of hare’s skin to a line, and letting it drag\r\nbehind them.\r\n\r\nMr. Donald Gunn writes that the Snowy Owl is merely a visitor in the\r\ndistricts to the west of Lake Winnepeg, but is a constant inhabitant\r\nof the country surrounding Hudson Bay. There they hatch their young,\r\nfrom three to five in number, making their nests in the forks of some\r\ntall poplar-tree. They lay their eggs very early in the spring, and have\r\nhatched their young before other birds begin to nest. This account of\r\ntheir breeding differs from all other statements I have seen, and, if\r\ncorrect, is probably exceptional.\r\n\r\nAlthough a bird of great vigilance, seldom permitting the hunter to\r\nget within range of shot, and equally careful in keeping at a distance\r\nfrom its foe in its flight, it is, Mr. Gunn states, readily deceived\r\nand decoyed within easy range by tying a bundle of dark rags to a piece\r\nof stout twine, and letting this drag from the end of the hunter’s\r\nsnow-shoe. The hungry Owl pounces upon the bait, and the hunter turns\r\nand shoots it. These birds are sometimes quite fat, and are much prized\r\nfor food by the Indians. At times they migrate from the more northern\r\nregions to the more inland districts. An instance of this took place\r\nin the winter of 1855–56. These birds made their appearance about the\r\nRed River Settlement in October, and before the latter end of December\r\nbecame very numerous, especially on the plains, where they were to be\r\nseen flying at any time of the day. In March all left that vicinity and\r\ndisappeared. A few pass the summer near Lake Winnepeg, as occasional\r\nbirds are seen there in the spring and fall. These migrations are\r\nsupposed to be caused by unusual snow-falls and the scarcity of the\r\nanimals on which they feed.\r\n\r\nMr. Dall found them rather rare in the valley of the Lower Yukon, and he\r\nhas noticed them occasionally flying over the ice in the winter season.\r\n\r\nMr. Hutchins, in his manuscript observations on the birds of Hudson Bay\r\nTerritory, speaking of this Owl as the _Wapacuthu_, states that it makes\r\nits nest in the moss on the dry ground, and lays from five to ten eggs\r\nin May. Professor Alfred Newton (Proc. Zoöl. Soc. 1861, p. 395) thinks\r\nthere can be no doubt he refers to this Owl. Richardson states, as the\r\nresult of his own inquiries, that it breeds on the ground, which the\r\nobservations of Mr. Hearne confirm. Professor Lilljeborg (Naumannia,\r\n1854, p. 78) found, June 3, 1843, on the Dovrefjeld, a nest of this\r\nspecies which contained seven eggs. It was placed on a little shelf, on\r\nthe top of a bare mountain, far from the forest, and easy of access.\r\nProfessor Nilsson was informed, on good authority, that in East Fiarmark\r\nthe Snowy Owl is said by the Lapps to lay from eight to ten eggs in a\r\nlittle depression of the bare ground on the high mountains. Mr. John\r\nWolley received similar information, and was told that the old birds\r\nsometimes attack persons that approach their nests. The 16th to the\r\n24th of May is said to be the time when they usually breed. I received\r\nin 1860 an egg of this Owl from Herr Möschler. It had been taken near\r\nOkkak, a missionary station of the Moravians, in Labrador, and collected\r\nby the Esquimaux. The accounts given by these collectors confirm the\r\nstatement that this bird always breeds on the ground in open places, and\r\nfrequently lays quite a large number of eggs. This specimen measures\r\n2.50 inches in length and 1.88 in breadth. It is oblong-oval in shape,\r\nequally rounded at either end, and of a dull soiled white. The egg is\r\nmuch discolored, apparently by its contact with the ground.\r\n\r\nMr. H. S. Hawkins (Ibis, 1870, p. 298) gives an account of the nest\r\nand eggs of this species, derived from a correspondent at one of the\r\nMoravian missionary stations on the coast of Labrador. The nest is said\r\nto consist of only a few feathers, and to be placed generally on a ledge\r\nof rocks where there is a slight hollow, sufficient to prevent the eggs\r\nfrom rolling out, but sometimes on the ground. The usual number of eggs\r\nis eight; these are not all laid and brooded at one time, but the first\r\ntwo are often hatched by the time the last is laid, so that you may find\r\nin one nest young birds, fresh eggs, and others more or less incubated.\r\n\r\nHerr von Heuglin, in his Notes on the birds of Novaja Zemlia (Ibis,\r\n1872, p. 61), mentions meeting with this Owl in Seal’s Bay, on Matthew’s\r\nStrait, in the Sea of Kara, where he found three nests with two young\r\nbirds covered with down. The nest was formed of a shallow depression\r\nin the turf, without any lining. The food of the Snowy Owl, in Novaja\r\nZemlia, during the summer time, consisted exclusively of a species of\r\n_Myodes_, which were very numerous. The down of the young is plain\r\nbrownish-gray. They were easily tamed, and their comical gestures and\r\nvivacity are said to have been very amusing.\r\n\r\nCaptain C. F. Hall, the celebrated Arctic voyager, during one of his\r\nexpeditions found a nest and four eggs of this species on the bare\r\nground. These were packed up in an old moccasin, and sent, without\r\nemptying, to the Smithsonian Institution, where, after an interval of\r\nseveral months, they were successfully emptied, and are now among the\r\nchoice treasures of the national museum.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS SURNIA, DUMÉRIL.\r\n\r\n  _Surnia_, DUMÉRIL, Zoöl.

CHAR. _Adult._ Above rich dark vandyke-brown, darker anteriorly,\r\nless intense and more grayish on tail. A narrow streak of brownish-black\r\noriginating over the middle of eye, and extending backward above the\r\nupper edge of the ear-coverts, where it forms an elbow passing downward\r\nin a broad stripe over the ends of the ear-coverts; confluent with\r\nthis, at about the middle of the vertical stripe, is another of similar\r\ntint, which passes more broadly down the side of the nape; between\r\nthe last stripes (those of opposite sides) is another or medial one\r\nof less pure black, extending from the occiput down the nape. Every\r\nfeather of the forehead, crown, and occiput with a central ovate dot\r\nof white; those anterior more circular, on the occiput less numerous\r\nand more linear. Between the lateral and posterior nuchal stripes the\r\nwhite prevails, the brown forming irregular terminal and transverse or\r\nmedial spots; these grow more linear toward the back. Interscapulars\r\nplain; posterior scapulars variegated with partially concealed large\r\ntransverse spots of white, the lower feathers with nearly the whole\r\nouter webs white, their confluence causing a conspicuous elongated patch\r\nabove the wing. Rump with sparse, irregular, but generally transverse,\r\nspots of white; upper tail-coverts with broader, more regular bars\r\nof the same, these about equal to the brown in width. Lower feathers\r\nof the middle and secondary wing-coverts each with an ovoid spot of\r\nwhite on the outer web; secondaries crossed by about three transverse\r\nseries of longitudinally ovoid white spots (situated on the edge of the\r\nfeather), and very narrowly tipped with the same; primary coverts with\r\none or two less continuous transverse series of spots, these found only\r\non the outer feathers; primaries with about seven transverse series\r\nof white spots, these obsolete except on the five outer feathers, on\r\nwhich those anterior to the emargination are most conspicuous; all the\r\nprimaries are very narrowly bordered with white at the ends. Tail with\r\nseven or eight very narrow bands of white, those on the middle feathers\r\npurely so, becoming obsolete exteriorly; the last is terminal. Eyebrows,\r\nlores, and face grayish-white, the grayish appearance caused by the\r\nblackish shafts of the feathers; that of the face continues (contracting\r\nconsiderably) across the lower part of the throat, separating a large\r\nspace of dark brown, which covers nearly the whole throat, from an\r\nindistinct collar of the same extending across the jugulum,—this collar\r\nuniting the lower ends of the auricular and cervical dusky bands, the\r\nspace between which is nearly clear white. Ground-color of the lower\r\nparts white, but everywhere with numerous very regular transverse bars\r\nof deep brown, of a tint more reddish than the back, the brown bars\r\nrather more than half as wide as the white ones; across the upper part\r\nof the breast (beneath the dark gular collar) the white invades very\r\nmuch and reduces the brown, forming a broad lighter belt across the\r\njugulum; below this the brown bars increase in width, their aggregation\r\ntending somewhat to a suffusion, giving the white jugular belt better\r\ndefinition. On the legs and toes the bars are narrower, more distant,\r\nand less regular.\r\n\r\nThe whole lining of the wing is barred just like the sides. The dark\r\nbrown prevails on the under surface of the primaries, etc.; the former\r\nhaving transverse, irregular, elliptical spots of white, these touching\r\nneither the shaft nor the edge: on the longest quill are seven of these\r\nspots; on all they are anterior to the emargination.\r\n\r\n♂ (49,808, Nulato, Alaska, April 21, 1867; W.

HOY); Massachusetts (DR. BREWER; MAYNARD); Dakota and\r\nMontana (Mus. S. I.).\r\n\r\nThe Hawk Owl of North America is to be distinguished from that of\r\nEurope and Siberia by the same characters which distinguish the\r\nAmerican Sparrow Owl from the European, namely, much darker shade of\r\nthe brown and its greater prevalence. Three perfect specimens of the\r\nOld World bird (a pair from Lapland, and a specimen from Kamtschatka,\r\nPetropawloosk, W. H. Dall) agree in prevalence of the white over the\r\nhead above, the confluence of the spots on the scapulars forming a\r\nlarger, more conspicuous patch, and very broad and almost immaculate\r\njugular belt; the brown bars beneath are very much narrower than in the\r\nAmerican bird, and the tint is not different from that of the back. The\r\nlegs and toes are scarcely variegated. While acknowledging the identity\r\nof the two representative forms, the differences are such as to entitle\r\nthem to separation as races.\r\n\r\nHABITS. The American form of the Hawk Owl inhabits the northern portions\r\nof both continents, and is common in the Arctic portions. On the\r\nAtlantic coast of this continent it has been found as far south as\r\nPhiladelphia and the State of New Jersey, but its presence south of\r\nlatitude 45° is probably only occasional and rather rare. The European\r\nform, according to Mr. Dresser, has not been known to exist in the\r\nBritish Islands, but several instances are quoted of the occurrence\r\nof the American form in Great Britain. One was taken off the coast of\r\nCornwall in March, 1830; another was shot near Yatton, in Somersetshire,\r\non a sunny afternoon in August, 1847; a third had previously been taken\r\nat Maryhill, near Glasgow, in December, 1863. On the Pacific coast\r\nit has not been taken farther south than Alaska, though it is quite\r\nprobable it may yet be found to be an occasional visitant in Washington\r\nTerritory and Oregon, and even the northern portions of California. It\r\nremains all the winter in high northern latitudes, and the instances of\r\nits having been taken even in Massachusetts, so far as is now known, are\r\nnot many. Wilson only met with two specimens. Audubon and Nuttall never\r\nmet with one of these birds alive.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Surnia ulula._]\r\n\r\nMr. Downes states that the Hawk Owl is very abundant in Nova Scotia\r\nin the winter time in some years, but may not be seen again for four\r\nor five seasons. It is common in Newfoundland, where it breeds in\r\nthe Caribou districts. Mr. Downes often kept living specimens in\r\nconfinement, which had been taken on board the Cunard steamers off the\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nMr. Boardman gives this species as resident, though rare, in the\r\nneighborhood of Calais, being occasionally found there in the\r\nbreeding-season. In Oxford County, Maine, Professor A. E. Verrill says\r\nit is a common autumnal and winter visitant, and that it is quite\r\nabundant from the first of November to the middle of March, but not\r\nfound there in the summer. Mr. Allen has never met with it in Western\r\nMassachusetts. Near Boston, in some seasons, it is not uncommon, though\r\nnever occurring with any frequency, and only singly. It is found\r\nthroughout the State, and is probably more common late in November than\r\nat any other time; several having been taken in Westfield, and also\r\nin Berkshire County, among the Green Mountains. I am not aware that\r\nany have been taken farther south than Philadelphia, near which city\r\nMr. Edward Harris obtained one specimen, while another was shot at\r\nHaddington in 1866. Mr. McIlwraith calls it a rare winter visitant near\r\nHamilton, Canada.\r\n\r\nRichardson states that it is a common species throughout the fur\r\ncountries from Hudson Bay to the Pacific, where it is killed by the\r\nhunters more frequently than any other, which may be attributed to\r\nits boldness and to its diurnal habits. During the summer season it\r\nfeeds principally upon mice and insects, but in the regions in which\r\nit is found in winter, where the snow is very deep, and where this\r\nfood is not procurable, it must depend on the Ptarmigan, and, indeed,\r\nis found a constant attendant upon the flocks of these birds in their\r\nspring migrations. When the hunters are shooting Grouse, it is said to\r\nbe occasionally attracted by the report of the gun, and is often bold\r\nenough, when a bird has been killed, to pounce down upon it, although it\r\nis unable, from its inferior size, to carry it off. It is also said to\r\noccasionally hover round the fires made by the Indians at night.\r\n\r\nTo this account of its habits Richardson adds that it builds its nest\r\non a tree, of sticks, grass, and feathers, and lays two white eggs. In\r\nregard to the number of eggs, he is now known to be inaccurate. Mr.\r\nMacFarlane met with this bird in considerable numbers in the region\r\nof Anderson River, where he found several nests, and all of which he\r\nmade any record were built in pine-trees at considerable height from\r\nthe ground. One nest is said to have been on the top of a pine about\r\ntwenty feet in height, and was composed of small sticks and twigs,\r\nlined with moss. Both parents were obtained. This nest contained two\r\nyoung birds—one of which was about ten days old, the other about three\r\nweeks—and an addled egg. This nest was found on the 20th of June,\r\nshowing that the bird began to incubate early in May.\r\n\r\nAnother nest, taken on the 28th of April, was found to contain six\r\neggs. It was built in the top crotch of a tall pine, was composed of\r\ndry sticks, and lined with hay and a few feathers. A third nest also\r\ncontained six eggs, and was lined with green mosses and deer’s hair. One\r\nnest contained as many as seven eggs, and all but one had as many as\r\nsix. Mr. MacFarlane speaks of it as a winter resident.\r\n\r\nMr. B. R. Ross states that he found this bird throughout the Great Slave\r\nLake district, but not plentiful. It winters in even the northernmost\r\nparts of the wooded country. It is said to build its nest not only on\r\ntrees, but also on cliffs, and to lay as early as the last of March or\r\nthe first of April. He states that the eggs are usually four in number,\r\nand describes them as of a dead white, of an oblong-oval shape, and as\r\nmeasuring 1.39 inches by 1.21. He received three eggs with the parent\r\nbird, taken at Lapierre’s House, and another parent, with nest and four\r\neggs, from Salt River.\r\n\r\nMr. Dall found this the most common species of Owl about Nulato. Many\r\nof both sexes were obtained, and on the 16th of April he took from the\r\novary of a female an egg ready for laying. On the 5th of May Mr. Dall\r\nobtained six eggs which were laid on the top of an old birch stump, and\r\nfifteen feet from the ground. There was no nest other than that the\r\nrotten wood was somewhat hollowed out, and the eggs laid directly upon\r\nit. As he was climbing to the nest, the male bird which had been sitting\r\non the nest attacked Mr. Dall, and knocked off his cap. The female did\r\nnot appear.\r\n\r\nMr. Donald Gunn states that these Owls hunt in the daytime, and feed\r\nchiefly upon mice; and Mr. Dall seldom found anything but mice in their\r\ncrops, and adds that it is very fond of flying, towards dusk, from the\r\ntop of one tall spruce to another, apparently swinging or balancing\r\nitself, calling to its mate at intervals, while chasing or being chased\r\nby it.\r\n\r\nCaptain Drummond states, in “Contributions to Ornithology” (p. 37), that\r\nhe noticed a bird of this species, on the wing, within a few yards of\r\nhim, in the Bermudas.\r\n\r\nMr. Dresser, who had ample opportunities of observing the Hawk Owl in\r\nNew Brunswick, where he found it by no means uncommon, describes it\r\nas a true day Owl. It was often seen by him hawking after prey in the\r\nstrongest sunshine, or seated quietly blinking on the top of an old\r\nblasted tree, apparently undisturbed by the glare of the sun. In its\r\ngeneral appearance, and particularly in its flight, it appeared to him\r\nto have considerable affinity to the Sparrow Hawk. In New Brunswick\r\nit affected the open plains or so-called blueberry barrens, where the\r\nopen country is covered with low bushes and an occasional scathed tree.\r\nIt would sit on one of these trees for hours in an upright hawk-like\r\nposition, occasionally hunting over the ground, like the Kestrel of\r\nEurope, in search of small field-mice. It showed but little fear, and\r\ncould be easily approached within gun-shot. When shot at and missed,\r\nit would take a short flight and return to its former perch. On one\r\noccasion Mr. Dresser, firing at one with a rifle, cut the branch close\r\nunder the bird, which returned almost immediately to another branch, was\r\na second time missed, and finally fell under a third shot.\r\n\r\nIts note is said to be a shrill cry, similar to the call of the European\r\nKestrel, and generally uttered on the wing. The stomach was generally\r\nfound filled with small field-mice, and rarely contained any remains\r\nof small birds. They appeared to hunt after food chiefly early in the\r\nforenoon and in the evening. During the day they rested on some elevated\r\nperch. In the night they retired to rest like other diurnal _Raptores_.\r\n\r\nAn egg of this Owl, taken from the oviduct of its parent by Mr. B. R.\r\nRoss, April 16, at Fort Simpson, measures 1.50 inches in length by 1.20\r\nin breadth. It is of oval shape, and of a dull-white color. Another\r\negg measures 1.62 by 1.30 inches, is of a rounded oval, equally obtuse\r\nat either end, and of a yellowish-white color. It was taken by Mr.\r\nMacFarlane at Fort Anderson.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Genus_ GLAUCIDIUM, BOIE.\r\n\r\n  _Glaucidium_, BOIE, Isis, 1826, 970. _Microptynx_, KAUP.

Size very small; head rather small; bill and feet very strong\r\nand robust; no ear-tufts; tail long, about three fourths as long as the\r\nwing, rounded. Nostrils circular, opening in the middle of the inflated\r\ncere-membrane (except in _G. siju_). Tarsus about equal to the middle\r\ntoe, densely feathered; toes haired.

They are the most robustly organized\r\nof all Owls, and, for their size, are very predatory, as in the next\r\ngenus (_Micrathene_), though themselves hardly larger than a Sparrow,\r\nthey frequently feed upon small birds, and, no doubt, often destroy the\r\npasserine species of nearly their own size. Like the most of the group\r\nto which this genus belongs, they are diurnal in their habits, and fly\r\nabout during the brightest sunshine. They inhabit chiefly dense forests,\r\nand for this reason, are less well known than the more easily accessible\r\nOwls.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =36874=\r\n\r\n_Glaucidium californicum._]\r\n\r\nThe following synopsis includes only the North American and Mexican\r\nspecies of _Glaucidium_.

Above, including the auriculars, umber-brown, with a\r\nfaint reddish cast; this tinge most apparent in a sharply defined band\r\nacross the throat. The continuity of the brown above is interrupted by a\r\nscarcely observable collar round the nape of concealed whitish; this is\r\ndiscernible only laterally, where there is also an inconspicuous black\r\nspace. Whole head above, and neck behind, with numerous small circular\r\nspots of reddish-white; back, scapulars, and wings more sparsely and\r\nmore minutely marked with the same; the two or three lower feathers\r\nof the secondary coverts have each a terminal, somewhat oval, larger\r\nspot of pure white. Secondaries crossed by three (exposed) bands of\r\npure white, and narrowly tipped with the same; the bands formed by\r\nsemicircular spots on the outer webs. Primaries almost plain, but\r\nshowing faintly defined obsolete bands,—the third, fourth, and fifth\r\nwith two or three conspicuous white spots on outer webs, beyond their\r\nemargination; primary coverts perfectly plain. Tail considerably darker\r\nthan the wings, and purer umber; crossed with seven narrow bands of\r\npure white, the last of which is terminal and not well defined,—these\r\nbands are formed by transverse spots, not touching the shaft on either\r\nweb. Lores, sides of the forehead, sides of the throat (beneath the\r\ncheeks and ear-coverts), and lower parts in general, pure white; the\r\nante-orbital white continuing back over the eye to its middle, but not\r\nbeyond it. Lateral portion of the neck and breast (confluent with the\r\ngular belt), and sides, umber, like the back, but more numerously,\r\nthough more obsoletely, speckled, the spots rather larger and more\r\nlongitudinal on the sides. Breast, abdomen, anal region, and lower\r\ntail-coverts with narrow longitudinal stripes of nearly pure black.\r\nJugulum immaculate. Tarsi mottled on the outside with brown. Lining\r\nof the wing white; a transverse patch of blackish across the ends of\r\nthe under primary coverts, formed by the terminal deltoid spot of each\r\nfeather; a blackish stripe, formed of blended streaks (parallel with the\r\nedge of the wing), running from the bend to the primary coverts. Under\r\nsurface of primaries dusky, with transverse spots of white anterior to\r\nthe emargination; these white spots on the longest quill are eight in\r\nnumber. Axillars plain white.\r\n\r\nWing, 3.60; tail, 2.60; culmen, .45; tarsus, .60; middle toe, .55.\r\nWing-formula, 4, 3, 5–2, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 1.\r\n\r\n♀ (36,874, Fort Whipple, near Prescott, Arizona, October 11, 1864; Dr.\r\nCoues). In general appearance scarcely different from the male. Upper\r\nsurface more ashy, the specks of whitish less numerous, being confined\r\nchiefly to the head; those on the scapulars, however, are large, though\r\nvery sparse. The middle wing-coverts have each a conspicuous roundish\r\nwhite spot near the end of the outer web; the secondary coverts are\r\nsimilarly marked, forming a band across the wing. The primaries and tail\r\nare as in the male, except that the latter has eight, instead of seven,\r\nwhite bands. The brown of the gular band extends upward over the throat\r\nto the recurved feathers of the chin; the white dots in the brown of the\r\nsides are considerably larger and (though very irregular) more circular\r\nthan in the male; the stripes on the abdomen, etc., are rather broader\r\nand less deeply black than in the male.

Pacific Province of North America, from Vancouver Island southward;\r\nArizona (Fort Whipple); Colorado (El Paso Co., AIKEN); Table-lands of\r\nMexico (Coll., G. N. LAWRENCE). Perhaps whole of the Western Province,\r\nfrom the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific.\r\n\r\nOne specimen in the collection (59,069) differs from those described\r\nin much darker colors. The original label is lost, but it was probably\r\nreceived from the northwest coast, as the darker, more reddish colors\r\nbear about the same relation to the paler gray tints of the southern\r\nbirds that the dark northwest coast style of _Scops asio_ (var.\r\n_kennicotti_) does to the true _asio_. The stripes beneath are nearly\r\npure black, the general tint above being a reddish sepia-brown. Wing,\r\n3.65; tail, 2.70.\r\n\r\nThe _Glaucidium californicum_ requires comparison only with the _G.\r\npasserinum_ of Europe, to which it is quite closely related, though\r\neasily distinguishable by the characters pointed out in the diagnoses;\r\nit is not at all like _gnoma_, nor indeed any other American species,\r\nwith which it has been confounded by nearly all ornithologists, even by\r\nCabanis, in his excellent paper above cited.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Glaucidium californicum._]\r\n\r\nI have seen only one Mexican specimen of this species, which is one in\r\nMr. Lawrence’s collection; the locality is not given, but it is probably\r\nfrom the higher regions of the interior. It differs in no respect,\r\nexcept in size, from North American examples; it measures, wing, 3.40;\r\ntail, 2.60.\r\n\r\nHABITS. This species, one of the smallest of our North American Owls,\r\nwas first obtained on the Columbia River by Dr. Townsend, near Fort\r\nVancouver; and subsequently, Dr. Merideth Gairdner procured several\r\nothers from the same locality, which were sent to the Edinburgh Museum.\r\nDr. Townsend’s specimen was said to have been taken on the wing at\r\nmidday.\r\n\r\nDr. Cooper met with a single specimen in Washington Territory early in\r\nNovember, 1854. He observed it among a flock of Sparrows, that did not\r\nseem at all disturbed by its presence. At first he mistook it for one of\r\nthese birds. Its stomach was found to contain only insects.\r\n\r\nDr. Suckley obtained two specimens at Puget Sound, where he found it\r\nmoderately abundant. It seemed to be diurnal in its habits, gliding\r\nabout in shady situations in pursuit of its prey. He saw one about\r\nmidday in a shady alder-swamp near Nisqually. It flitted noiselessly\r\npast him several times, alighting near by, on a low branch, as if to\r\nexamine the intruder.\r\n\r\nNear a small lake in the neighborhood of Fort Steilacoom, Dr. Suckley\r\nfrequently heard the voice of a diminutive Owl, which he supposed to\r\ncome from one of these birds, as this is the only small species of the\r\nfamily he ever saw in that neighborhood. The notes were subdued and\r\nclear, like the soft, low notes of a flute.\r\n\r\nDr. Newberry procured specimens of the Pigmy Owl on the Cascade\r\nMountains, in Oregon, where, however, it was not common. It occurs\r\nalso in California, as he saw several individuals in San Francisco\r\nthat had been obtained in that State, but he did not meet with any in\r\nthe Sacramento Valley. It was apparently confined to wooded districts,\r\nwhich is probably the reason why it is not more frequent in the open\r\ncountry of California. He adds that it flies about with great freedom\r\nand activity by day, pursuing the small birds upon which it subsists,\r\napparently as little incommoded by the light as they are. It is,\r\nhowever, doubtful whether it subsists, to any large extent, on small\r\nbirds. So far as observed it appears to feed almost exclusively on\r\ninsects, although the Owl taken by Townsend is said to have had the\r\nentire body of a _Regulus_ in its stomach.\r\n\r\nDr. Cooper speaks of this Owl as not uncommon in the middle part of\r\nCalifornia, though he did not meet with it in the southern part of the\r\nState. It is probable that it is occasional in Southern California, as\r\nit has been found in Mexico, where however, it is undoubtedly rare, as\r\nMr. Ridgway informs me that only a single specimen of this Owl, among a\r\nhundred others from Mexico, has ever been seen by him.\r\n\r\nDr. Heermann met with this beautiful little species among the\r\nmountainous districts of the mining regions of California, where it\r\nwas by no means rare. It was, however, seldom captured by him, and\r\nhe regarded its flying by night as the reason; but this view is not\r\ncorroborated by the observations of others. In 1852 he procured three\r\nspecimens on the borders of the Calaveras River, others were taken on\r\nthe Cosumnes River, and Mr. J. G. Bell, of New York, met with it on the\r\nAmerican River, thus demonstrating its wide and general distribution\r\nthroughout the State.\r\n\r\nMr. John K. Lord met with a pair on Vancouver Island. He characterizes\r\nthe bird as of shy and solitary habits, always hiding among the thick\r\nfoliage of the oak or pine, except when feeding. Early one spring,\r\nwhile collecting specimens of the smaller migrant birds, he was favored\r\nwith unusual opportunities for watching their habits. The pair had made\r\ntheir home in the hollow of an oak-tree that stood in an open patch of\r\ngravelly ground near a small lake. The remains of an Indian lodge which\r\nwas close to the place enabled Mr. Lord to watch closely the habits\r\nof this interesting pair. In the first morning twilight the Owls were\r\nup and in motion, hungry after a whole night’s fasting. Their flight\r\nwas short, quick, and jerking, similar to that of the Sparrow Hawk,\r\nbut wholly unlike the muffled, noiseless flap of the Night Owls. Their\r\nfood was found to be entirely insectivorous, chiefly grasshoppers and\r\nfield-crickets, with an occasional beetle or butterfly. When in pursuit\r\nof food, they perch on a small branch near the ground, and sit bolt\r\nupright in an indolent drowsy manner until their quick eye detects an\r\ninsect, when they suddenly pounce upon it, hold it down with their\r\nsmall but powerful claws, and with their sharp beaks tear it to pieces.\r\nOnly the soft abdominal parts are thus eaten. As soon as their hunger\r\nis satiated they return to the tree, cuddling close together, and doze\r\naway the greater part of the day. In the evening twilight the Owls again\r\ncome out of their hole and take erratic flights around their abode,\r\nchasing each other up and down the plain, and performing all kinds of\r\ninexplicable manœuvres. Occasionally they settle on the ground, but\r\nnever long at a time.\r\n\r\nMr. Lord never observed them to capture an insect while on the wing, and\r\na very small quantity of food seemed to supply their wants. As soon as\r\nit became dark they retired to their nest, and there apparently passed\r\nthe night.\r\n\r\nTo this account Mr. Lord adds, that early in May two small eggs were\r\nlaid, white in color, round and very rough on their surface, a large\r\nknot-hole in the branch of the tree having been selected as the\r\nnesting-place. Nothing of any kind was used as a lining, the eggs being\r\ndeposited on the bare wood. The length of time occupied in incubation\r\nMr. Lord was not able to ascertain in consequence of the shortness of\r\nhis stay.\r\n\r\n\r\nGlaucidium ferrugineum, KAUP.\r\n\r\nTHE RED-TAILED OWL.\r\n\r\n  _Strix ferruginea_, MAX.

Beneath the longitudinal blotches\r\ndo not appear, but the rusty rufous covers nearly the whole surface,\r\nleaving the medial portion only white, and this not well defined; the\r\nrusty shows ragged minute transverse bars of blackish. The whitish\r\ncollar round the nape is also better defined than in the type. Wing,\r\n4.20; tail, 2.10. Wing-formula, 4, 3=5–6, 2–7, 8, 9, 10, 1. Length,\r\n5.20; extent, 14.25.\r\n\r\nAnother specimen, 50,765, from the same locality, also apparently\r\nimmature, is just like the preceding in plumage. It measures, wing,\r\n4.00; tail, 1.90.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Micrathene whitneyi._]\r\n\r\nHABITS. The type specimen of this diminutive species was shot at Fort\r\nMohave, in the Colorado Valley, latitude 35°, April 26, 1861, and two\r\nothers have since been taken on the Socorro Islands, off the western\r\ncoast of Mexico, by Colonel Grayson. It is smaller even than the little\r\nCalifornia Pygmy Owl, and is therefore the smallest known to inhabit\r\nNorth America. It resembles that species in its colors, but is thought\r\nby Dr. Cooper to be more similar to the burrowing Owls in its generic\r\ncharacters. It was found in a dense thicket, on a very windy morning,\r\nand where it may have taken only a temporary refuge, after having been\r\nblown down from some of the caverns in the barren mountains surrounding\r\nthe valley. In its stomach were found the remains of insects and the\r\nfeathers of small birds. Several specimens of this Owl were taken in\r\nArizona by Captain Bendire, one of which is now in the collection of the\r\nBoston Society of Natural History. Captain Bendire also found one of\r\ntheir nests, with two fully fledged young ones, in a hole of a mesquite\r\nstump.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS SPEOTYTO, GLOGER.\r\n\r\n  _Speotyto_, “GLOGER, 1842.” (Type, _Strix cunicularia_, MOL.)\r\n  “_Pholeoptynx_, KAUP, 1848.” (Same type.)\r\n\r\nGEN.

Anteriorly they become more longitudinal (nearly linear),\r\nand medial; on the rump and upper tail-coverts, they are nearly\r\nobsolete. Secondaries crossed by four distinct bands of dull white,\r\nthe last terminal; primaries with five to six transverse series of\r\nsemi-rounded spots of ochraceous-white on their outer webs; primary\r\ncoverts with about three transverse series of whitish spots. Tail\r\nwith five to six bands of dull white, or pale ochraceous (the last\r\nterminal), composed of transverse oval spots, those on the middle pair\r\nof feathers not touching either the shaft or the edge.

Western Province of United States, from the Plains to the Pacific,\r\nand from the Rio Grande to Cape St. Lucas; Mexico.\r\n\r\nLocalities: Xalapa (SCL. 1857, 290); Texas (DRESSER, Ibis, 1865, 330;\r\nresident).\r\n\r\nSpecimens never vary in the pattern of coloration, and but little in\r\nthe relative amount of the brown and white spotting; the shade of the\r\nbrown and the depth of the ochraceous tinge vary considerably, however,\r\nin different individuals,—but irrespective of locality,—the brown\r\nbeing paler and the white purer in summer than in fall and winter,\r\nafter the new dress is freshly assumed. The brown on the breast varies\r\nconsiderably in quantity, being sometimes nearly uniform, thereby\r\nabruptly contrasting with the white jugular band, and again frequently\r\nwith the brown hardly greater in amount than the white, the two colors\r\nbeing in regular bars, as on the sides and flanks.\r\n\r\nThere is certainly but one species, or even race, of Burrowing Owl in\r\nNorth America. This is represented in the Smithsonian collection by\r\nover fifty specimens, including examples from all parts of its range.\r\nUpon a close inspection of all the specimens in this extensive series,\r\nI was very much surprised to find so little variation; indeed, all the\r\nspecimens are so much alike that a detailed description of the colors of\r\none would answer for almost any individual. The shade of color varies\r\nmainly according to the age of the feathers, those newly acquired having\r\na darkness of tint and a softness of texture not seen in those more worn\r\n(as in midsummer dress), which have a bleached or faded appearance. I\r\nfail entirely to detect the different styles of plumage which Mr. Cassin\r\nhas described, and his diagnoses of two supposed species will not at all\r\nhold good when applied to specimens from either of the two regions which\r\nthey were considered to characterize.\r\n\r\nExamining critically the large series at my command, I find that the\r\nprincipal discrepancy among individuals is the amount of feathering on\r\nthe tarsus; this extending to the toes was supposed to characterize the\r\n_A. cunicularia_ of North America the habitat of which was considered\r\nas restricted in North America to the west of the Rocky Mountains (see\r\nCassin, Birds of North America, as cited above); the nearly naked tarsus\r\nwas believed to be characteristic of the _A. hypogæa_, as restricted,\r\nand the habitat assigned to this was “from the Mississippi River to the\r\nRocky Mountains.” Now, dividing the series under examination into two\r\nsets, according to this feature, we have, first, _cunicularia_ from\r\nthe following localities: from the Rio Grande, all specimens but one;\r\nTongue River, Montana; and Petaluma, Santa Clara, and San Francisco,\r\nCalifornia. Next, _hypogæa_ represents the following localities,\r\nbesides places within the range ascribed to it: Utah; Lower California,\r\nincluding Cape St. Lucas, all specimens; San Diego, California, several\r\nspecimens; Santa Barbara, San Francisco, Sacramento, and Fort Tejon,\r\nCalifornia; and Tamaulipas, Mexico.\r\n\r\nThough we have but one species or form in North America, the South\r\nAmerican bird is different: this is the true _cunicularia_ of Molina,\r\nand though not specifically distinct from our bird, is nevertheless an\r\neasily recognized geographical race. It is larger, the wing measuring\r\nfrom 7.00 to 7.50, instead of 6.40 to 7.00; the brown of the plumage\r\nis appreciably darker than that of most specimens of _hypogæa_, but\r\nless extended; on the outer web of the primaries the white spots are\r\nlarger,—sometimes confluent along the edge,—and on their inner webs the\r\nwhite largely prevails, the dusky bars appearing only towards the ends;\r\nthe outer tail-feather is almost wholly white, instead of having brown\r\nbars, broader than the white ones. Of the var. _cunicularia_ there are\r\neight specimens in the collection (chiefly from Paraguay, Buenos Ayres,\r\nand Chile), while numerous others, in various collections, have been\r\nexamined besides. All the American forms of this subgenus seem clearly\r\nreferrible to one species, as being at the most but geographical races.\r\n\r\nHABITS. The Burrowing Owl of North America inhabits the country between\r\nthe Pacific coast and the Mississippi River, especially in the lower\r\nplains in Nebraska and in Kansas, as well as in particular districts\r\nin Utah, Arkansas, New Mexico, the Indian Territory, Texas, Arizona,\r\nCalifornia, and Mexico. They are usually very abundant, congregating\r\ntogether in large communities, and differing from most members of their\r\nfamily by living and breeding in burrows in the ground. Their habits are\r\npeculiar and interesting.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Speotyto hypogæa._]\r\n\r\nThomas Say, during Colonel Long’s expedition to the Rocky Mountains, was\r\nthe first of American naturalists to meet with this bird. He encountered\r\nit in our trans-Mississippian Territories, where he described it\r\nas residing exclusively in the villages of the prairie-dog, whose\r\nexcavations are so commodious as to make it unnecessary for the bird to\r\ndig for itself, which it is able to do when occasion requires. These\r\nvillages are very numerous, and variable in their extent, sometimes\r\ncovering only a few acres, and at others spreading over the surface of\r\nthe country for miles together. They are composed of slightly elevated\r\nmounds, having the form of a truncated cone, about two feet in width at\r\nbase, and seldom rising as high as eighteen inches above the surface.\r\nThe entrance is at the top or on the side. From the entrance the passage\r\ndescends vertically one or two feet, and thence it continues obliquely\r\ndownward until it terminates in the snug apartment where these animals\r\nenjoy their winter’s sleep, and where they and the Owls are common, but\r\nunfriendly, occupants.\r\n\r\nMr. Dresser noticed this bird at all seasons, in the prairie country of\r\nTexas. They were rather common near the Rio Leon and Medina, and in one\r\nplace he found they had taken possession of some deserted rat-holes.\r\nHe obtained several specimens near San Antonio and at Eagle Pass. In\r\nthe latter place he found them quite common on the sand plains near the\r\ntown. The stomachs of those he shot were found to contain coleopterous\r\ninsects and field-mice.\r\n\r\nDr. Newberry states that he found this species in Northern California,\r\nin several places between San Francisco and Fort Reading, and again at\r\nthe Klamath Basin, though less frequently at the northward than in the\r\nSacramento Valley. There they occupied the burrows made by the Beechey’s\r\nand the Douglass’s Spermophile. He usually saw them standing at the\r\nentrance to these burrows, often permitting him to approach within\r\ngun-shot, and before taking to flight twisting their heads about and\r\nbowing with many ludicrous gestures, apparently in order to aid their\r\nimperfect sight, and to get a better view of the intruder. When shot\r\nat or otherwise alarmed, they fly with an irregular jerking motion,\r\ndropping down much like a Woodcock.\r\n\r\nDr. Suckley obtained a specimen near Fort Benton, on the Upper Missouri,\r\nin Dakotah, and Dr. Cooper procured others thirty-five miles west of\r\nFort Kearney, in Nebraska, in August. He saw them in great numbers on\r\nthe plains of Nebraska, and did not observe any difference in habits\r\nbetween them and the birds of California.\r\n\r\nThis species was found in Texas, near Fort Davis, and also at El Paso,\r\nby Mr. J. H. Clark. It was taken in Tamaulipas, Mexico, by Lieutenant\r\nCouch. Mr. Clark remarks that they were seen by him only in the\r\nprairie-dog towns, and were found in conjunction with the rattlesnake,\r\nand accuses them of feeding upon the young of the prairie-dog; but\r\nthis ungrateful requital of the hospitality given them in the burrows\r\nof this marmot is discredited by Dr. Kennerly and others, who regard\r\nthe apparent harmony in which the two dwell together as altogether\r\nincompatible with this habit.\r\n\r\nThis species is also found on our Pacific coast, west of the Rocky\r\nMountains, as far north as British Columbia. Mr. Lord met with it\r\nalong the entire course of the boundary-line. It was not by any means\r\nplentiful, but pairs of them were occasionally seen. While in camp\r\nat the Dalles he dug out several squirrel-holes. In one he found\r\ntwo eggs of this species, the female bird, a racer-snake, and a\r\nfemale ground-squirrel (_Spermophilus douglassi_). The Owl he found\r\nto be strictly of diurnal habits, feeding principally on crickets,\r\ngrasshoppers, large beetles, and larvæ. He thinks it never captures\r\nsmall animals or birds, and regards it as a peaceful and harmless bird.\r\n\r\nDr. Kennerly met with this species near Los Angeles, California. At any\r\nhour of the day they might be seen seated upon the mounds erected around\r\nthe holes of the marmot, or else with head protruding from its orifice,\r\ndisappearing immediately when approached. When molested, they commence\r\nbowing and chattering in a somewhat ludicrous manner at the intruder, or\r\nfly swiftly away, keeping near the earth and alighting suddenly in the\r\nvicinity of a burrow to renew these amusing motions. He found it very\r\nabundant in the valley of the San Gabriel River, where it associated\r\nwith the large ground-squirrel of that region.\r\n\r\nDr. Heermann, who found them common on the extensive open prairies,\r\nspeaks of its sight as very clear by day, and adds that it will not\r\nallow the hunter on foot to approach within shooting distance; but\r\nthat, if approached on a horse or a mule, it may be easily shot. The\r\nnests he found were formed of a few straws carelessly thrown together\r\nat the bottom of its tortuous burrow, which is from six to eight feet\r\nin length. The eggs were usually four in number, and are described as\r\nnearly spherical, and as pure white.\r\n\r\nDr. Townsend states that this Owl resorts to the forsaken burrows of\r\nmarmots and badgers, but never lives on terms of intimacy with either.\r\nThe nest he describes as of fine grass, and placed at the extremity of\r\nthe hole. The eggs are uniformly four in number, pale white, and about\r\nthe size of those of the common House Pigeon.\r\n\r\nDr. Gambel, who observed this bird in California, states that he has\r\noccasionally found it in solitary burrows, and also that it often makes\r\nuse of the holes dug by the _Spermophilus beecheyi_. They occasionally\r\ndig their own burrows, and live in scattered companies of four or\r\nfive. Dr. Gambel also states that the bird is a resident of California\r\nthroughout the year.\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin, in the Zoölogy of the Beagle, met with the var.\r\n_cunicularia_ in crossing the pampas of South America. In Banda\r\nOriental, he says, it is its own workman, and excavates its burrows\r\non any level spot of sandy soil; but in the pampas, or wherever the\r\nBizcacha is found, it uses those made by that animal. It usually preys\r\non mice and reptiles. Lieutenant Gilliss gives a similar account of it,\r\nfrom observations made in Chile.\r\n\r\nMr. Nathaniel H. Bishop met with _cunicularia_ on the banks of the river\r\nSan Juan, in Banda Oriental, where a few pairs were seen, devouring\r\nmice and insects. After crossing the river Las Vacas, and coming upon\r\na sandy waste covered with scattered trees and low bushes, he again\r\nencountered it. Upon the pampas of the Argentine Republic they were\r\nfound in great numbers, from a few miles west of Rosario to the vicinity\r\nof San Luis, where the pampas end. On these immense plains of grass\r\nit lives in company with the Bizcacha (_Lagostomus trichodactylus_),\r\ndwelling with it in perfect harmony, and during the day, while the\r\nanimal is sleeping, a pair of Owls stand a few inches within the main\r\nentrance of the burrow, and at the first sound, be it near or distant,\r\nleave their station and remain outside the hole, or upon the mound\r\nthat forms the roof of their domicile. At the approach of man, both\r\nbirds, with their irides dilated, mount above him in the air, and keep\r\nup an alarm-note until he passes. Then they quietly settle down in the\r\ngrass, or return to their former place. On the pampas Mr. Bishop did\r\nnot observe them taking their prey during the daytime, but as soon as\r\nthe sun had set, the Bizcacha and Owls both leave their holes in search\r\nof food, the young of the former playing about the birds as they alight\r\nnear them. They do not associate in companies, there being but one pair\r\nto a hole. Each couple keep separate from their neighbors, and at night\r\ndo not stray from their homes.\r\n\r\nIt is both diurnal and nocturnal, and feeds at all hours. Outside the\r\ntown of San Juan, which lies upon the eastern base of the Andes, Mr.\r\nBishop had a fine opportunity to watch their habits in a locality\r\ndiffering entirely from the pampas. The country around San Juan is a\r\ndreary desert, covered with low thorn-trees, and over this waste a few\r\nOwls are found, principally near the town itself, in the vicinity of the\r\npastures that are cultivated by irrigation. They mate in September and\r\nOctober. “One evening,” Mr. Bishop writes, “I was attracted by a strange\r\nsound that I supposed proceeded from a frog, but it proved to be the\r\nlove-note of a little _Athene cunicularia_, and which was answered by\r\nits mate. It alighted upon a post, and commenced turning around upon it,\r\nwith throat dilated, and emitting a guttural sound. These antics were\r\ncontinued for more than a minute, it occasionally bowing its head in a\r\nmysterious manner. The female soon after joined it, and they flew away.\r\nEach night it perched upon a tall flagstaff and uttered its love-note.\r\nClose by the house was a lagoon, the borders of which were swampy, and\r\nover this a pair often hovered in search of food. I watched one that\r\nkept on the wing for nearly two hours, some fifty feet from the ground,\r\nand during that time did not change its position in any other way than\r\nby rising or falling a few feet. A boy brought me a female with five\r\neggs, that had been taken from a burrow five feet from the mouth. The\r\nbird was very fierce, and fought me with her wings and beak, uttering\r\nall the while a long shrill note, resembling a file drawn across the\r\nteeth of a saw. I supplied her with eleven full-grown mice, which she\r\ndevoured during the first thirty-six hours of her confinement. It is\r\nsaid to place a small nest of feathers at the end of the hole, in which\r\nare deposited five white eggs.”\r\n\r\nThe eggs of the var. _cunicularia_ are of a rounded-oval shape, more\r\nobtuse at one end than at the other, measure 1.30 inches in length by\r\n1.05 in breadth, and are of a uniform white color, with a slightly\r\nbluish tinge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =6885= ½ NAT. SIZE.\r\n\r\n_Strix pratincola._ (See page 10.)]\r\n\r\nThe egg of the _A. hypogæa_ is of a rounded-oval shape, equally obtuse\r\nat either end, and averages 1.35 inches in length by 1.13 in breadth,\r\nand is of a uniform clear white color. This description is taken from an\r\negg obtained by Mr. E. S. Holden near Stockton in California. Captain\r\nBendire writes that he has found as many as nine, and once even ten,\r\neggs in the nest of the North American species.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nThe crania of the Owls present many features of interest, which may\r\nserve a good purpose in the definition of the sections and the genera,\r\nand to which attention has been occasionally called in the preceding\r\npages. The tendency to asymmetry is especially marked in some species,\r\nand the better to illustrate this and other features we append several\r\nplates, in which the corresponding views are placed side by side.[39]\r\nThe figures and accompanying lettering tell their own story, without any\r\nnecessity of a labored description.\r\n\r\nR.

Eyes directed laterally, and eyelids provided with lashes. Toes\r\ninvariably naked, and tarsus usually naked and scutellate (feathered\r\nonly in _Aquila_ and _Archibuteo_). Outer toe not reversible (except in\r\n_Pandion_). Head never with ear-tufts, and never wholly naked (except in\r\nthe _Vulturinæ_, of the Old World).\r\n\r\nThe above characters are about the only readily observable points in the\r\nexternal anatomy in which the _Falconidæ_ differ strikingly from the\r\n_Strigidæ_ and _Cathartidæ_, and may serve to distinguish the birds of\r\nthis family from those of the two others. The osteological characters,\r\nhowever, as expressed on page 1328, are more decided and important in\r\na taxonomic point of view, and serve to separate the Hawk family as a\r\nwell-defined group.\r\n\r\nIn the following treatment of the North American _Falconidæ_, I confine\r\nthat part relating to the systematic arrangement strictly to the species\r\nembraced within the province of our work, for the reason that in a\r\nforthcoming monograph of all the American species I hope to present a\r\nsystematic classification based upon the species of the whole world.\r\nAll preliminary details regarding the general characteristics and\r\ndistinctive peculiarities of the family, as well as all discussions and\r\ngeneralizations upon the subject, will therefore be omitted here.\r\n\r\nThe following synopsis of the North American genera is intended as an\r\nartificial arrangement which may enable the student to identify, by\r\nsimple and readily understood characters, the forms belonging to this\r\ncountry.[40]\r\n\r\n\r\nGenera.\r\n\r\n  =A.= Nasal bones almost completely ossified, the nostril being a small\r\n  orifice, with a conspicuous central bony tubercle; its form nearly or\r\n  quite circular, or linear and oblique (in Polyborus), with its upper\r\n  end the posterior one …\r\n\r\n                                                            _Falconinæ._\r\n\r\n        1. =Falco.= Nostril circular.

These slight specific differences\r\nare illustrated by the figures on page 1430. The same difference is\r\nobservable in many birds whose habitat extends through a great range of\r\nlatitude, as, for instance, the _Pediocætes phasianellus_, the northern\r\nrace of which has the feathers covering the base of the toes so long as\r\nto reach beyond the claws and nearly conceal them, while in the southern\r\nform (var. _columbianus_) the toes are almost completely naked.\r\n\r\nMy determination of the number and character of the geographical races\r\nof _F. gyrfalco_ is the result of a very careful critical examination of\r\nover sixty specimens, aided by the important conclusions of Mr. Hancock\r\n(Annals and Magazine of Natural History, 2d ser., XIII, 110; London,\r\n1834), Schlegel (_Falcones_, Muséum d’Histoire Naturelle des Pays-Bas,\r\n1862), Pelzeln (Uebersicht der Geier und Falken der Kaiserlichen\r\nornithologischen Sammlung, April, 1863), and Alfred Newton (History of\r\nBritish Birds, revised ed., part 1, June, 1871, pp. 36–52, and Proc.\r\nAcad. Nat. Sc. Philadelphia, July, 1871, pp. 94, 95), in their important\r\npapers bearing upon this subject, which, though they each express the\r\npeculiar individual views of the writer, together clear up pretty\r\nsatisfactorily the problem of the number, character, and habitats of the\r\nseveral races, as well as the different phases of variation to which\r\neach is subject.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =43139=, ♀. ½\r\n\r\n_Falco sacer._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =43139=, ♀. ¼]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =5482=, ♀. ½\r\n\r\n_Falco polyagrus._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =43139=, ♀. ½]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =5482=, ♀. ½]\r\n\r\nIn studying the _F. lanarius_, I have experienced most discouraging\r\ndifficulties from the want of sufficient series of the Old World races,\r\nand from the unsatisfactory character of most descriptions and figures\r\nof them, besides being much perplexed by the confusion of their synonymy\r\nby different authors. In consequence of this, my diagnoses of the four\r\nraces of which alone I have seen examples may be very unsatisfactory as\r\nregards the characters by which they may be most readily distinguished.\r\nHaving seen the adult of only a single one of these four races, I am\r\ntherefore compelled to base my differential characters upon the immature\r\nstages.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the four races of _F. lanarius_ characterized above,\r\nthere are several geographical forms belonging to the Old World, chiefly\r\nintertropical Asia and Africa. These are the var. _babylonicus_, Scl.\r\nand Irby, (Gray’s Hand List, I, p. 20, No. 173,) of Southeastern\r\nEurope and Western Asia; var. _barbarus_, L. (Gray’s Hand List, p. 20,\r\nNo. 174), of Northern Africa; and var. _tanypterus_, Licht. (Gray’s\r\nHand List, No. 175), of both the preceding regions, which Mr. Gurney\r\nwrites me “is simply the intertropical race of _F. lanarius_, from\r\nwhich it only differs in being of a darker shade throughout.” The _F.\r\nsaker_, Schleg. (Gray’s Hand List, No. 176), seems, to judge from the\r\ndescriptions and figures which I have seen, to be also merely a form of\r\nthe same species, but I have seen no specimens of it.\r\n\r\n\r\nFalco (Hierofalco) gyrfalco, LINN.\r\n\r\nVar. =candicans=, GMELIN.\r\n\r\nWHITE GERFALCON.\r\n\r\n  _Accipiter falco freti hudsonis_, BRIS.

Primaries crossed at regular intervals with quadrate spots\r\nof the same tint, these becoming fused toward ends of quills, forming\r\na terminal dusky space of two or three inches in extent; tips of all\r\nthe quills narrowly white; the black bars do not extend quite to the\r\nprimary coverts, and decrease both in extent and regularity toward the\r\nbase. Middle tail-feathers crossed with seven or eight imperfect bars\r\nof dusky, the shafts of the feathers blackish; rest of tail immaculate,\r\nthe shafts pure white.

Head above, occiput,\r\nnape, and upper half of ear-coverts, with sparse shaft-streaks of\r\nblack, these most numerous on the latter region; primaries barred to\r\nthe coverts. Tail entirely crossed by eleven plumbeous bars. Bars above\r\nclearer plumbeous. The snowy-white beneath is relieved by a few minute\r\nvariable flecks of dusky upon the lower part of the abdomen, becoming\r\nlarger as they approach the sides. Wing-formula, 2–3–1. Wing, 16.70;\r\ntail, 9.30.\r\n\r\n_Juv. transition stage?_ (♂ 56,047, “Hoher Norden”; Schlüter\r\nCollection). Markings above quite different from those of the two\r\npreceding; each feather has a large central longitudinal sagittate spot\r\nof dusky, leaving only the borders (of the exposed portion) white; on\r\nthe primaries the dusky is almost confined to the terminal portion;\r\nthe rump and upper tail-coverts have each feathers with a medial\r\nlongitudinal stripe of dusky. The tail is immaculate, but the shafts of\r\nthe middle feathers are dusky. The neck, breast, abdomen, and sides have\r\nnumerous cuneate marks of dusky, one near the end of each feather. The\r\nlining of the wing, even, has a few narrow streaks. Wing, 14.75; tail,\r\n9.40.\r\n\r\nNo. 56,049 (♀, Greenland, Schl.

Beneath the lanceolate\r\nspots or streaks cover the whole surface, except the anal region, lower\r\ntail-coverts, and throat. On the lining of the wing the streaks are less\r\nsparse than in the preceding, though they are by no means numerous.\r\nWing, 15.75; tail, 9.50.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Falco candicans._]\r\n\r\n_Juv. first plumage_ (♀, 56,053, Greenland; Schlüter Coll.). All the\r\nmarkings are longitudinal, instead of directly the reverse. The upper\r\nparts have longitudinal tear-shaped stripes, a medial one on each\r\nfeather; they are sparse, however, on the wings; the rump has narrow\r\nshaft-lines of dusky. The tail and upper coverts are immaculate, but\r\nthe shafts of all the feathers are nearly pure black. The bars on the\r\nprimaries are found only immediately next the dusky terminal space. The\r\nstreaks beneath are not very numerous, and are found only on the breast,\r\nupper part of abdomen, and on the sides; the nape and sides of the neck\r\nare, however, thickly streaked.\r\n\r\n(No. 17,966, ♀, Moose Factory, Hudson Bay Territory.) In character of\r\nmarkings resembling the last, but the stripes are fainter and narrower;\r\nthey are also less numerous. On the under parts they are wanting.\r\nUnfortunately, the tail of this specimen, which is the only North\r\nAmerican one in the collection, is missing.\r\n\r\nIn all specimens the anal region and lower tail-coverts are immaculate.\r\n\r\nHAB.

Tail tipped with white, and\r\ncrossed with equal continuous bands of hoary-plumbeous and ashy-white;\r\nthe latter eleven in number, and finely sprinkled with deeper ash.\r\nPrimaries brownish-plumbeous, plain past the middle portion, but on the\r\nanterior half with quadrate spots of creamy white on the outer web.\r\nHead above brownish-plumbeous, this prevailing; but along the median\r\nline the feathers are edged with buffy white; forehead dull white, this\r\ncontinuing back in a streaked superciliary stripe to the occiput; cheeks\r\nvery thinly marked with fine streaks of dusky, this prevailing along\r\nthe upper border of the ear-coverts; a deeper dusky suffusion beneath\r\nthe anterior angle of the eye. Lower surface pure white; chin and\r\nthroat, only, immaculate; jugulum with very sparse, narrow longitudinal\r\nstreaks of blackish; sides with scattered cordate or nearly circular\r\nspots, these larger and transverse on the flanks and tibiæ; abdomen\r\nwith scattered minute elliptical spots; lower tail-coverts with minute\r\nirregular sagittate or transverse spots of dusky. Under surface of\r\nthe wing white; each feather of the lining with a medial tear-shaped\r\nstreak of dusky; primaries crossed with narrow bars of dusky, fifteen in\r\nnumber on the longest. Wing-formula, 2–3–4–1–5. Wing, 13.50; tail, 8.60;\r\nculmen, .90; tarsus, 2.15; middle toe, 1.87.\r\n\r\n♀ (43,139, Fort Anderson, May 24, 1864, “♀ and two eggs”; R.\r\nMacFarlane). Generally similar to the male. Head above conspicuously\r\nstreaked, but the dusky prevailing. Above the transverse bands are less\r\nregular and continuous, anteriorly the plumbeous largely prevailing;\r\nposterior portions, however, as in the male, but on the rump the bands\r\nare more distinct. Beneath, the markings are more numerous, larger, and\r\nbroader; those on the jugulum linear; those of the abdomen medially\r\nelliptical; laterally they are transversely cordate, and on the flanks\r\nin form of broad transverse spots, or broad bars; on the tibiæ and lower\r\ntail-coverts they form regular transverse bars,—on the latter, quite\r\ndistant. Wing-formula, 2–3–4, 1. Wing, 15.50; tail, 9.50; tarsus, 2.15\r\nand .80; middle toe, 1.95.\r\n\r\n_Juv._ (♂, 55,400, Alaska, Nulato, February 10, 1868; W. H. Dall).\r\nAbove plumbeous-umber, precisely as in young of _islandicus_, but on\r\nthe rump having a decided ashy cast. No white edges to the feathers,\r\nas in _islandicus_, but, instead, numerous irregular transverse spots\r\nor obsolete ragged bars of cream-color or pale ochraceous-buff; the\r\nwhole upper surface is quite thickly variegated with these irregular\r\nmarkings. Tail crossed with thirteen narrow bands of creamy-white, these\r\nso thickly mottled with dusky on the outer webs as to be obscure, but on\r\ninner webs they are regular and sharply defined; the last is terminal.\r\nPrimaries plain dusky, skirted obscurely with paler, and marked toward\r\nbases with obsolete mottled spots of cream-color. Head streaked with\r\ndusky and creamy-white, the former predominating on upper surface,\r\nalong upper edge of ear-coverts, and across the cheeks, on the latter\r\nforming a mustache; the white prevails over the ear-coverts in a broad\r\nsupra-oral stripe, and on the forehead and lores. Beneath, soft dull\r\nwhite; chin and upper part of throat, only, immaculate; each feather\r\nwith a broad medial stripe of clear dark plumbeous-brown, on the flanks\r\nand tibiæ prevailing, the whitish assuming the form of roundish spots;\r\nlining of the wing similarly marked; prevailing aspect of under surface\r\nof primaries white, crossed with narrow bars of ashy, fifteen in number\r\non the longest. Wing-formula, 2, 3–1=4. Wing, 14.00; tail, 8.40.\r\n\r\nHAB. Interior regions of Arctic America; Anderson River, McKenzie,\r\nYukon, and Severn River regions. Breeding abundantly in the former\r\ndistrict, whence numerous specimens of skins and eggs have been received\r\nby the Smithsonian Institution.\r\n\r\nIn the young specimen described, there are one or two new feathers\r\nappearing on the rump and upper tail-coverts, precisely as in the blue\r\nplumage, and proving conclusively their relationship. The species is as\r\ndifferent from the Iceland bird in the young stage as in the mature.\r\nThe most readily apparent differences are, lack of sharp white edges of\r\nfeathers above, and in their stead numerous ragged transverse spots of\r\nyellowish; dark aspect of head above, etc.\r\n\r\nSpecimens vary considerably in the shades of color and distribution of\r\nthe markings, but the types of the above descriptions are the lightest\r\nof the series. The darkest example is No. 43,144½ (“♀ and eggs”),\r\nFort Anderson, May 22, 1864. In this the whole head and neck (except\r\nunderneath) are continuous blackish-plumbeous, only the middle of the\r\nauriculars being faintly streaked; the back is nearly plain dusky, and\r\neven on the wings the bars are very obscure and much reduced in width.\r\nThe rump is plain ashy-blue, the darker bars being nearly obsolete.\r\nThe longitudinal markings on the pectoral region are enlarged into\r\nconspicuous stripes, while on the sides and flanks the transverse bars\r\nform heavy spots. The transverse bars on the tibiæ are ashy-blue; those\r\non the crissum clear plumbeous, and regularly transverse. Wing, 15.75;\r\ntail, 9.30. Upon comparing this specimen with the figures of a pair of\r\nvar. _gyrfalco_, by Wolf, in Newton’s Oötheca Wolleyana, I can discover\r\nno difference at all; thus it would seem that our bird occasionally\r\nclosely approaches in tints and markings this race of Continental\r\nEurope, of which I have seen only one immature example, and no adults.\r\n\r\nI cannot agree with Mr. Newton in considering the Gerfalcons of the\r\ninterior of Arctic America as identical with the Iceland form, though\r\nthat distinguished ornithologist considers them so in his paper in the\r\nProceedings of the Philadelphia Academy for July, 1871, basing his\r\nconclusion upon the specimens from which the above descriptions were\r\ntaken, which had been sent over to England for comparison. I have never\r\nyet seen a specimen of _islandicus_ which could not be distinguished,\r\nby the characters given in my synopsis, from these examples, while they\r\ncan be separated from that race by the characters which Mr. Newton\r\nhimself gives, in his diagnostic table in the paper above cited, for\r\ndistinguishing the adults of _islandicus_ and _gyrfalco_.\r\n\r\nThe var. _sacer_ is evidently separable from both _islandicus_ and\r\n_gyrfalco_, and about as much related to one as to the other; combining\r\nthe size and proportions of the former with the colors of the latter,\r\nwhile in the wide amount of individual variation of plumage its lighter\r\nextreme approaches one, while its darkest phase approximates as closely\r\nto the average plumage of the other.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF SPECIMENS EXAMINED.\r\n\r\nNational Museum, 6.\r\n\r\n_Measurements._\r\n\r\n +----+-----------+-----------+---------+---------+-----------+----------+\r\n |Sex.|   Wing.   |   Tail.   | Culmen. | Tarsus. |Middle Toe.|Specimens.|\r\n +----+-----------+-----------+---------+---------+-----------+----------+\r\n | ♂  |13.35–14.25|  8.50–9.00|  .86–.93|2.15–2.40|  1.80–1.95|    3     |\r\n +----+-----------+-----------+---------+---------+-----------+----------+\r\n | ♀  |15.50–16.00|10.00–10.50| 1.00–.00|2.35–2.55|  2.00–2.15|    3     |\r\n +----+-----------+-----------+---------+---------+-----------+----------+\r\n\r\n\r\nVar. labradora, AUDUBON.\r\n\r\nBLACK GERFALCON.\r\n\r\n  _Falco labradora_, AUD.

The upper\r\ntail-coverts also show faintly indicated spots, and the former specimen\r\nhas the wing-coverts with very narrow irregular spots on the edge of the\r\nfeathers. In this specimen there is also one feather in the scapulars\r\nwhich has broader white edges; it also has the white below about equal\r\nto the black in amount; the anal region, however, in all, is unvaried\r\nblackish, and the transverse oblique bands on the lower tail-coverts are\r\na constant feature.\r\n\r\nNo. 41,185 (♀, Fort Nescopec, Labrador; H.

In treating of the general habits of the Gerfalcons of North\r\nAmerica it will not be necessary, nor will it be possible, to give the\r\ndistinctive peculiarities belonging to the several forms in which these\r\nFalcons occur. Whether, on account of their variations of plumage, we\r\nconsider them as races or as specifically distinct, does not affect\r\ntheir history in this respect. There is no good reason for presuming\r\nthat they have any very noticeable variations as to any of their habits,\r\nalthough certain writers claim for some of them certain well-marked\r\npeculiarities of character.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of geographical distribution they are all, for the most\r\npart, rarely seen, even in midwinter, south of the 50th parallel of\r\nnorth latitude, and are found in the summer as far north as the Arctic\r\nOcean. The Gerfalcon of the McKenzie River region, occurring from the\r\nSlave Lake to Anderson River and the Yukon, is the form elsewhere\r\ngiven as the _F. sacer_. Along our eastern coast region occurs another\r\nform, the _F. labradora_, which is the bird met with in Labrador, and\r\ndescribed by Mr. Audubon. The _F. candicans_ or _grœnlandicus_ is a form\r\npeculiar to Greenland, visiting also, in the winter, the Hudson’s Bay\r\nregion; while the _F. islandicus_, a well-known European form, occurs in\r\nGreenland also, and occasionally farther south.\r\n\r\nHolböll, in his account of the birds of Greenland (Isis, 1845), appears\r\nto recognize but one species of Gerfalcon as occurring there, to which\r\nhe gives the name of _islandicus_. This is, he states, the most abundant\r\nFalcon in Greenland, and is equally common in the northern and in\r\nthe southern parts. Their great variations in color he regarded as\r\nindicative of differences in ages to only a very limited extent, and as\r\nin no respect specific. These differences in color were found among both\r\nnestlings and breeding birds, white and dark birds being found together\r\nin both circumstances. The white birds were more numerous in Northern\r\nGreenland, and the dark ones oftener seen in the southern portion.\r\n\r\nHe found the young birds moulting throughout the winter. On the 4th of\r\nJanuary, 1840, he shot a young female that showed signs of moulting\r\nabout the head and neck, with a striped white appearance from the\r\nsprouting feathers. The ovaries were quite well developed, and it was\r\nevident that the birds of this species breed in the first season after\r\ntheir birth. Holböll adds that they breed in January, that their eggs\r\nare of nearly the same color as those of the Ptarmigan, but are twice as\r\nlarge. They nest usually in inaccessible cliffs. They prey chiefly upon\r\nwater-fowl and Ptarmigans, and usually build near “bird rocks,” from\r\nwhich they obtain the young without much trouble. He mentions having\r\nonce seen one with a young _Larus tridactylus_ in each foot, and another\r\nwith two _Tringa maritima_ carried in the same manner. Its rapidity\r\nof flight Holböll did not regard as very great. He had for years kept\r\npigeons, and only lost two young birds, which were seized when at rest.\r\nAlmost every day, especially in October and November, these Falcons\r\nwould chase the old Pigeons unsuccessfully, and were often shot when\r\nthey followed them too near the house. They were not particularly shy,\r\nand were occasionally decoyed and killed by throwing a dead bird towards\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer they are most numerous along the bays, especially\r\nwhere there are “bird-rocks” near. In September they go southerly along\r\nthe coast, and also in October and November. At this time they are\r\nnot rare, and approach the houses of the Danes, near which they are\r\noften seen fighting with the Ravens. Their spring migrations are not so\r\nregular as they are in the autumn, or perhaps at this time they do not\r\napproach the houses so frequently. When they are near the settlements,\r\nit is noticed that in the morning they fly towards the south, and in the\r\nevening towards the north.\r\n\r\nRichardson speaks of the Gerfalcon as a constant resident in the Hudson\r\nBay territory, where it is known as the Speckled Partridge-Hawk, and\r\nalso as the Winterer. Its southern limit he could not give, but he\r\nnever met with it south of 52°. He traced it northward to the coast of\r\nthe Arctic Sea, and probably to the most northern Georgian islands.\r\nHe cites Captain Sabine as authority for its occurring as far north\r\nas latitude 74° on the west coast of Greenland. Richardson often met\r\nwith it during his journeys over the Barren Grounds, where its habitual\r\nprey was the Ptarmigan, and where it also destroyed Plover, Ducks, and\r\nGeese. He relates that in the middle of June, 1821, a pair of these\r\nbirds attacked him as he was climbing to the vicinity of their nest,\r\nwhich was built on a lofty precipice on the borders of Point Lake, in\r\nlatitude 65° 30′. The bird flew in circles, uttering loud and harsh\r\nscreams, stooping alternately with such velocity that their motions\r\nthrough the air produced a loud rushing noise. They struck their claws\r\nwithin an inch or two of his head. Keeping the barrel of his gun close\r\nto his cheek, and suddenly elevating its muzzle when they were in the\r\nact of striking, he found that they invariably rose above the obstacle\r\nwith the rapidity of thought, showing equal power of motion. They bore\r\nconsiderable resemblance to the Snowy Owl, but their flight was much\r\nmore rapid.\r\n\r\nMr. MacFarlane, in the memoranda of his collections in the neighborhood\r\nof Anderson River and Fort Anderson, furnishes notes of eighteen\r\nnests of the Gerfalcon obtained by him in that region. With only two\r\nexceptions, these were placed near the tops of pines, or other trees, at\r\ndistances from the ground varying from ten to twenty-five feet. In some\r\ninstances the nest was placed on the very top of the tree, in others on\r\na lower limb against the trunk. They were composed of twigs and small\r\nbranches, and lined with mosses, hay, deer’s hair, feathers, and other\r\nsubstances. The parents were always very much excited whenever their\r\nnests were approached, making a great noise, and not unfrequently their\r\nloud screams drew attention to nests that would otherwise have escaped\r\nnotice. In one instance a nest had been built on a ledge of rocks thirty\r\nmiles northwest of Fort Anderson. It was composed of a few withered\r\ntwigs, and lined with mosses and hay. It was found on the 27th of May,\r\nand contained two eggs nearly fresh, and two in a state of greater\r\ndevelopment. One nest, placed on a broad branch of a tree, near the\r\ntrunk, was of considerable size. Another nest was on the ground, on the\r\nside of a steep and high hill. The earliest date of finding these nests\r\nis given as the 10th of May. The eggs then found were fresh. The ground\r\nat that time was still thickly covered with snow, and the weather was\r\nvery cold. In a nest found five days later the eggs contained partially\r\ndeveloped embryos. In nearly every instance the eggs seem to have been\r\nin different stages of development in the same nest. In some, young\r\nbirds were in the same nest with eggs only partially developed, and in\r\nanother an egg perfectly fresh was in the same nest with others nearly\r\nready to hatch. A nest found July 3 contained young about two days old;\r\nanother, on May 27, had eggs with large embryos; and one, on June 25,\r\nhad young nearly ready to fly.\r\n\r\nMr. Donald Gunn claims that this Falcon is the only Hawk that is\r\nresident in the Arctic regions throughout the year. It is known to the\r\nIndians by the name of Pepunesu, and this name is applied to it because\r\nit passes the winter with them. It is a very powerful bird, and commits\r\ngreat havoc among the Partridges, so much so that in former times the\r\nHudson Bay Company gave a reward of a quart of rum to every hunter who\r\nbrought in the head of one of these Falcons. All the other Hawks are\r\nonly summer visitors.\r\n\r\nMr. Bannister was informed by the residents of St. Michaels that a Hawk,\r\npresumed to be this species, is not unfrequent there, though he did not\r\nhappen to meet with it. On his voyage home, on the 21st of October,\r\n1866, when off the coast of Kamtschatka, north of Behring’s Island, one\r\nalighted in the rigging of the ship, and continued with them for several\r\nhours.\r\n\r\nAlthough very rare in any part of the United States, occasional\r\nindividuals have been taken in different localities, and in one instance\r\na pair was known to breed for several successive seasons in Vermont.\r\nThis information I have from Mr. Clarence King, who, when a lad at\r\nschool in the town of Dummerston, observed a pair nesting among some\r\nhigh cliffs, and informed me of the fact at the time of the occurrence.\r\nOne of these birds is recorded by Mr. Lawrence as having been taken on\r\nLong Island in the winter of 1856.\r\n\r\nMr. Boardman gives it as occurring near Calais in winter, but very rare.\r\nProfessor Verrill found them not uncommon in Oxford County, Me., where\r\nthey were frequently seen during winter, flying about the extensive\r\nmeadows near Norway; but they were very shy and watchful, and it was\r\nhardly possible to procure a specimen. It is very unusual in Eastern\r\nMassachusetts, and only very rarely and occasionally have specimens been\r\ntaken. Mr. Jillson obtained a specimen, in 1840, at Seekonk. One was\r\nshot, in 1864, near Providence, R. I., by Mr. Newton Dexter.\r\n\r\nMr. Audubon relates that, August 6, 1833, his son, John W. Audubon,\r\nfound a nest of this Falcon among some rocky cliffs near Bras d’Or,\r\nLabrador, containing four young birds ready to fly, two of which\r\nwere procured. The nest was placed among the rocks, about fifty feet\r\nfrom their summit and more than a hundred from their base. It was\r\ninaccessible, but, having been examined from above, was seen to be\r\nempty. It was composed of sticks, sea-weeds, and mosses, was about two\r\nfeet in diameter, and was almost flat. Its edges were strewed with the\r\nremains of their food, and beneath the nest was an accumulation of the\r\nwings of Ptarmigans, Mormons, Uriæ, etc., mingled with large pellets of\r\nfur, bones, and various substances.\r\n\r\nTheir flight is spoken of as similar to that of the Peregrine Falcon,\r\nbut more elevated, majestic, and rapid. Their cries were also like those\r\nof that Falcon, being very loud, shrill, and piercing. Occasionally this\r\nbird was seen to alight on one of the high stakes placed on the shore.\r\nThere it would stand, in the position of a Tern, for a few moments, and\r\nthen would pounce upon a Puffin, as the latter bird was standing at the\r\nentrance of its burrow, unaware of the approach of its enemy. The weight\r\nof the Puffin seemed to form no impediment to the Hawk in its flight.\r\n\r\nThe European Gerfalcons are said to seldom appear south of the 52d\r\nparallel of latitude, or north of 74°. They are nowhere numerous, and\r\nwere formerly much sought for, and purchased, at immense prices, for\r\npurposes of falconry. Great differences were supposed to exist in regard\r\nto the habits and other peculiarities of the several races. The Iceland\r\nFalcons commanded the highest prices, and were regarded as a species\r\nquite distinct from the _F. gyrfalco_. The former was much the more\r\nvaluable, both as more rare, and as a bird of higher courage and of a\r\nmore rapid and bolder flight, and a bird that could, on that account, be\r\n“flown” successfully at larger game.\r\n\r\nThe Gerfalcons, in Europe, build on the rocky coasts of Norway and\r\nIceland, and are said to defend their young with great courage and\r\ndetermination. They are comparatively rare in the British Islands,\r\nespecially the more southern portions. Even in the Orkneys it is only an\r\noccasional visitor.\r\n\r\nAll the eggs of the several forms of Gerfalcon that I have seen present\r\ncommon characteristics, and do not differ from each other more than\r\neggs known to belong to the same species of Hawk are frequently found\r\nto vary. One from Greenland, presumed to belong to the _candicans_,\r\nmeasures 2.37 inches in length by 1.71 in breadth. The predominant color\r\nof its markings is a deep reddish-brown, very generally and nearly\r\nequally diffused over its surface, concealing the ground-color, which is\r\nlighter and of a yellowish-brown shade.\r\n\r\nAn egg of the _islandicus_, from Iceland, has the same measurements, but\r\nis so slightly yet uniformly marked with light yellowish-brown as to\r\nseem to be of one color only,—a light brown, shaded with yellow.\r\n\r\nAn egg from Norway, of the form _gyrfalco_, is 2.42 inches in length,\r\n1.71 in breadth, has a ground-color of a dirty yellowish-white, and is\r\nmarked with spots, dottings, and confluent blotches of yellowish-brown,\r\nmore so about the larger end.\r\n\r\nThe series of eggs of _Falco sacer_ in the Smithsonian Collection\r\nexhibits the following range of variation in size, color, and markings:\r\nlength, from 2.30 to 2.45 inches; breadth, 1.60 to 1.90 inches;\r\nground-color usually a light reddish-ochre, varying to pinkish on the\r\none hand, and to rufous on the other. They are usually sprinkled all\r\nover with small spots, which are sometimes not distinguishable from\r\nthe ground-color when this is very deep, and again larger and quite\r\nconspicuous.\r\n\r\nAn egg of the variety _candicans_, from Greenland (No. 2,606, S. I.),\r\nmeasures 2.25 inches by 1.80. In color and in markings it is like the\r\naverage eggs of variety _sacer_, namely, pale rufous, sprinkled over\r\nwith a slightly deeper shade.\r\n\r\n\r\nFalco lanarius.\r\n\r\nVar. =polyagrus=, CASSIN.\r\n\r\nAMERICAN LANNER; PRAIRIE FALCON.\r\n\r\n  _Falco polyagrus_, CASSIN, B.

Above cinereous-drab, becoming\r\ngradually paler and more bluish posteriorly, barred, indistinctly,\r\neverywhere with a more dusky tint, the shafts of all the feathers\r\nblackish; anteriorly the darker shade predominates, while posteriorly\r\nthe bluish prevails; on the anterior portions the light bars are much\r\nrestricted in width, and of a more ochraceous tint. Tail plain, very\r\npale ashy-drab, narrowly tipped with reddish-white, this changing to\r\npale rusty on the middle pair; the concealed portion of the feathers\r\noutside the shaft show obsolete, or faint traces of, darker bars, which\r\non the middle pair are apparently about eleven in number. On the inner\r\nwebs the paler bars become broader than the darker ones, and incline\r\nto ochraceous in tint, the lateral feather being edged externally with\r\nthis color. Primaries plain ashy-drab, with a hoary tinge, growing\r\ninsensibly darker terminally, and with a slightly paler apical margin.\r\nHead and neck above, dark umber-brown, with conspicuous shaft-streaks\r\nof black. Lores, a broad superciliary stripe (somewhat interrupted\r\nabove the eyes), white, finely and sparsely streaked, the two stripes\r\nconfluent across the occiput; a broad heavy “mustache” from the lores\r\nand rictus downward and obliquely backwards, across the maxilla, and a\r\nwider postocular stripe, like the crown. Beneath continuous white, with\r\na faint ochraceous tinge on the abdomen and crissum; abdomen and sides\r\nof the breast with a few scattered, small, ovate spots of vandyke-brown;\r\nsides transversely spotted with vandyke-brown, the spots coalesced into\r\na broken patch on the flanks; outside of the tibiæ with transverse spots\r\nof the same. Axillars plain, clear vandyke-brown, with a few nearly\r\nobsolete rusty specks near their ends; lining of the wing clear white,\r\nthe feathers with central spaces of dusky-brown, which toward the edge\r\nbecome aggregated into a longitudinal patch; inner webs of the primaries\r\nwith broad transverse spots of white, which reach nearly to the shaft;\r\nthey are about thirteen in number on the longest quill. Feet yellow;\r\nbase of the bill tinged with the same. Wing-formula, 2, 3–1, 4. Wing,\r\n12.00; tail, 7.50; tarsus, 1.90; middle toe, 1.70; outer, 1.22; inner,\r\n1.12; posterior, .77.\r\n\r\n♀ (not _adult?_ 18,258, Fort Buchanan, New Mexico; Dr. Irwin). Above\r\ncontinuous umber-drab, growing gradually lighter posteriorly, the tail\r\nbeing pale drab; no transverse bars (except a few concealed obsolete\r\nones on back and secondaries), but all the feathers faintly bordered\r\nwith paler rusty-brown, these edgings being on upper tail-coverts almost\r\nwhite. Tail tipped with creamy-white, and with many transverse spots or\r\nbroad bars of the same on inner webs, outer feather irregularly skirted\r\nwith the same, and all decidedly paler than the ground-color along\r\ntheir edges. Head as in the male, but forehead white, and superciliary\r\nstripe more continuous. Breast and abdomen with longitudinal lanceolate\r\nor cuneate streaks of dark vandyke-brown; patch of same on flanks\r\nmore continuous than in the male; axillars unvariegated clear dark\r\nvandyke-brown; longest primary with eleven transverse spots of white;\r\nposterior outer face of tibiæ with sagittate spots of dark brown.\r\nWing-formula, 2, 3–1, 4.

Above darker umber than the last, each feather distinctly\r\nbordered terminally with rusty-ochraceous. Beneath with a deeper\r\ncream-colored tinge, streaks blacker; flank-patch more conspicuous and\r\nuniform; axillars unvariegated dusky. Wing-formula, 2, 3–1=4. Wing,\r\n13.25; tail, 7.25.\r\n\r\nHAB. Western division of North America, eastward to Illinois; Oregon to\r\nLower California, and Texas. Localities: Texas, San Antonio and Eagle\r\nPass (DRESSER); Arizona (COUES).\r\n\r\nThe different stages of plumage are in this by no means so well defined\r\nas in other species, there being nearly the same general appearance in\r\nall. There is, also, very little variation in different specimens of\r\nthe same age. No. 8,504, (♀, Dalles, Oregon; Dr. George Suckley) has\r\nthe black markings on the sides of the breast more circular, and the\r\nvandyke-black of the axillars with a few circular white spots on the\r\nedges of the feathers. Wing, 14.50; tail, 8.40. Nos. 17,204 (♀, San\r\nJosé, Lower California; John Xantus, January, 1860) and 18,258 (♂ ? Fort\r\nBuchanan, N. M.) have the upper surface almost perfectly continuous\r\ngrayish-drab, the first absolutely unvariegated by markings, though the\r\nfeathers fade a little on edges. Beneath, the white is very pure; the\r\nstreaks are numerous, sharply defined and longitudinal. Wing, 13.25;\r\ntail, 7.50 (17,204).\r\n\r\nThe American Lanner Falcon is so very closely related to the Lanners\r\nof Europe and Asia (var. _lanarius_ and var. _jugger_) that it is very\r\ndifficult to indicate the differences which separate them. The two Old\r\nWorld forms above named are more unlike each other than they are from\r\nthe two American races; the var. _jugger_ differing from _mexicanus_\r\napparently only in larger size; and the var. _lanarius_, more like\r\n_polyagrus_ than it is like either _jugger_ or _mexicanus_, differs\r\nfrom _polyagrus_ mainly in the greater amount of white on the plumage,\r\nthis imparting a lighter aspect to the pileum, and causing a greater\r\ndevelopment of the light spots on the outer webs of the primaries and\r\nrectrices.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Falco polyagrus._]\r\n\r\nThe var. _polyagrus_, compared with var. _lanarius_, is much darker,\r\nhaving, at all ages, the crown uniformly brown, with darker streaks,\r\ninstead of having these streaks upon a white ground. The “mustache” is\r\nmore distinct in the American bird, while in the European the bands on\r\nthe tail are much more distinct, and the spots forming them are on the\r\nouter webs, as well as on the inner, instead of on the latter alone; the\r\ndark bars between the light spots are in the American bird much narrower\r\nand more numerous, and in the young the light ones come to the edge of\r\nthe web, instead of being enclosed within the dark color. Two very young\r\nbirds (i.e. in first perfect plumage) appear almost identical until\r\nclosely examined, the chief differences being a lighter tint to the\r\ncrown in the European, and heavier dark stripes on the breast, besides\r\nthe peculiar character of the tail-spots, which are always distinctive.\r\nIn shades of color, there is not the slightest difference.\r\n\r\nI have seen no specimen of any of the Old World forms in the plumage\r\ncorresponding to that transversely barred above, described here as the\r\nadult, though figures of the adult _lanarius_ indicate a very similar\r\nplumage. The series of the latter race at my command is unfortunately\r\nlimited to a very few immature specimens. One marked “ad.” (56,051,\r\nHungary; Schlüter Coll.) measures as follows: Wing, 14.50; tail, 8.00;\r\nculmen, .83; tarsus, 1.90; middle toe, 1.80. Its colors are as described\r\nin the synopsis (p. 1429) for the young bird.\r\n\r\nThe var. _mexicanus_ and var. _jugger_, which are both much darker, and\r\nmore uniform in the coloring of the upper parts, than var. _polyagrus_,\r\nare more nearly alike; in fact, the only tangible difference that I\r\ncan find between a specimen of the former in the Museum of the Boston\r\nSociety of Natural History (No. 1,438, ♂, Juv. Lafr. Collection;\r\n“Mexico”) and two examples of the latter in the New York Museum,\r\nconsist in the larger size of the var. _jugger_ (see synopsis),\r\nbesides its whiter cheeks and more isolated and distinct “mustache.”\r\nA direct comparison of these two races may show other tangible points\r\nof distinction, or, on the contrary, may show even these slight\r\ndistinguishing features to be inconstant. The former result is, however,\r\nmost reasonably to be expected.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF SPECIMENS EXAMINED.\r\n\r\nNational Museum, 9; Boston Society, 2; Philadelphia Academy, 4; Museum\r\nComp.

This is an exclusively western species, occurring from the\r\nvalley of the Mississippi to the Pacific coast. Specimens have been\r\nobtained as far east as Illinois. Several others have been taken on the\r\nUpper Missouri and the Yellowstone Rivers, in Nebraska, at Fort Thorne,\r\nNew Mexico, and on the Little Colorado River. A specimen was shot by\r\nDr. Heermann on the Farallones, on the California coast; but Dr. Cooper\r\nthinks it rarely visits the coast border, though he several times saw,\r\nnear San Diego, a bird which he supposed to belong to this species. At\r\nMartinez, in December, 1863, he succeeded in shooting one as it flew\r\nfrom its perch at the approach of the wagon in which he was riding.\r\n\r\nIt is said to extend its migrations in summer to the Upper Columbia,\r\navoiding the densely forest-clad regions. Dr. Heermann saw a young\r\nunfledged individual at San Francisco, from which it may be inferred\r\nthat a few may breed within the State.\r\n\r\nThe first individual of this species was taken by Dr. Townsend during\r\nhis trip across the continent, in 1834. It was obtained among the\r\nmountainous regions of Oregon, near the sources of the Platte River.\r\nMr. Cassin states that Dr. Heermann procured several specimens in the\r\nSacramento Valley.\r\n\r\nMr. Cassin remarks that this species, except in its greatly superior\r\nsize and strength, bears a very close resemblance to the well-known\r\nJugger Falcon of India, a bird much used for the purposes of falconry.\r\n\r\nDr. Kennerly, who procured a single specimen of this species while his\r\nparty was encamped on the Little Colorado, found it busily engaged in\r\nseeking its prey among the bushes that grew along the river-bank. It was\r\nshy, and was procured with difficulty.\r\n\r\nDr. Suckley speaks of this Hawk as not at all rare in Oregon. He\r\nprocured a specimen of it at Fort Dalles, in the beginning of the winter\r\nof 1854–55, which had been killed in the act of carrying off a barn-yard\r\nfowl of about its own weight, and which it had just seized near the\r\ndoor of a dwelling-house,—an act demonstrative of a union of courage,\r\nferocity, and strength inferior to none of its congeners.\r\n\r\nDr. Cooper characterizes this as one of the shyest of Hawks, as it is\r\nalso one of the swiftest, flying with rapid flappings of the wings. It\r\nseems to prefer the borders of prairies, where it catches hares, quails,\r\nand even larger game.\r\n\r\nMr. Ridgway informs me that this Hawk was seen by him in Southern\r\nIllinois, near Mt. Carmel, September 27, 1871. It had been obtained once\r\nbefore within the limits of Illinois, but in the northwestern part of\r\nthe State, at Rock Island, by I. Dickenson Sergeant, of Philadelphia,\r\nand presented by him to the Academy of Natural Science.\r\n\r\nIts nest and eggs were taken in Utah by Mr. Ricksecker. I have no notes\r\nin regard to the former. A finely marked specimen of one of the eggs\r\nprocured by him is in my cabinet. It measures 2.15 inches in length\r\nby 1.65 in breadth. It is of a somewhat less rounded-oval shape than\r\nare the eggs of the _anatum_. The ground-color is a rich cream, with\r\na slightly pinkish tinge, and is beautifully marked with blotches of\r\nvarious sizes, shapes, and shades of a red-brown tinged with chestnut,\r\nand with occasional shadings of purplish. These are confluent about one\r\nend, which in the specimen before me chances to be the smaller one. It\r\nvery closely resembles the eggs of the European _F. lanarius_.\r\n\r\nAn egg in the Smithsonian Collection (15,596), taken at Gilmer, Wyoming\r\nTerritory, May 13, 1870, by Mr. H. R. Durkee, has a ground-color of\r\npinkish-white, varying in two eggs to diluted vinaceous, thickly spotted\r\nand minutely freckled with a single shade of a purplish-rufous. In shape\r\nthey are nearly elliptical, the smaller end being scarcely more pointed\r\nthan the larger. They measure 2.27 by 1.60 to 1.65 inches. The nest was\r\nbuilt on the edge of a cliff. Its eggs were also taken by Dr. Hayden\r\nwhile with Captain Raynolds, at Gros Vent Fork, June 8, 1860.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBGENUS FALCO, MŒHRING.\r\n\r\n  _Falco_, MŒHRING, 1752.

Upper parts dark bluish-plumbeous, approaching black\r\nanteriorly, but on rump and upper tail-coverts becoming fine bluish\r\nplumbeous-ash. On the head and neck the continuous plumbeous-black\r\ncovers all the former except the chin and throat, and the back portion\r\nof the latter; an invasion or indentation of the white of lower parts\r\nup behind the ear-coverts separating that of the cheeks from the\r\nposterior black, throwing the former into a prominent angular patch;\r\nforehead and lores grayish. All the feathers above (posterior to the\r\nnape) with transverse bars of plumbeous-black, these most sharply\r\ndefined posteriorly, where the plumbeous is lightest. Tail black, more\r\nplumbeous basally, very faintly paler at the tip, and showing ten\r\nor eleven transverse narrow bands of plumbeous, these most distinct\r\nanteriorly; the bars are clearest on inner webs. Alula, primary and\r\nsecondary coverts, secondaries and primaries, uniform plumbeous-black,\r\nnarrowly whitish on terminal margin, most observable on secondaries and\r\ninner primaries. Lower parts white, tinged with delicate cream-color,\r\nthis deepest on the abdomen; sides and tibiæ tinged with bluish.\r\nChin, throat, and jugulum immaculate; the breast, however, with faint\r\nlongitudinal shaft-streaks of black; sides, flanks, and tibiæ distinctly\r\nbarred transversely with black, about four bars being on each feather;\r\non the lower tail-coverts they are narrower and more distant; on\r\nthe abdomen the markings are in the form of circular spots; anal\r\nregion barred transversely. Lining of the wing (including all the\r\nunder coverts) white tinged with blue, and barred like the sides;\r\nunder surface of primaries slaty, with elliptical spots or bars of\r\ncreamy-white on inner webs, twelve on the longest.

Leconte). Like the\r\nmale, but ochraceous tinge beneath deeper; no ashy wash; bands on\r\nthe tail more sharply defined, about ten dark ones being indicated;\r\nouter surface of primaries and secondaries with bands apparent;\r\ntail distinctly tipped with ochraceous-white. Inner web of longest\r\nprimary with thirteen, more reddish, transverse spots. White of neck\r\nextending obliquely upward and forward toward the eye, giving the\r\nblack cheek-patch more prominence. Markings beneath as in the male.\r\nWing-formula the same. Wing, 14.50; tail, 7.00; tarsus, 1.95; middle\r\ntoe, 2.10; culmen, .95.\r\n\r\n_Juv._ (♂, 53,193, Truckee River, Nevada, July 24, 1867; R. Ridgway:\r\nfirst plumage). Above plumbeous-black, tail more slaty. Every feather\r\nbroadly bordered terminally with dull cinnamon; these crescentic bars\r\nbecoming gradually broader posteriorly, narrower and more obsolete on\r\nthe head above. Tail distinctly tipped with pale cinnamon, the inner\r\nwebs of feathers with obsolete transverse spots of the same, these\r\ntouching neither the edge nor the shaft; scarcely apparent indications\r\nof corresponding spots on outer webs. Region round the eye, and broad\r\n“mustache” across the cheeks, pure black, the latter more conspicuous\r\nthan in the older stages, being cut off posteriorly by the extension of\r\nthe cream-color of the neck nearly to the eye. A broad stripe of pale\r\nochraceous running from above the ear-coverts back to the occiput, where\r\nthe two of opposite sides nearly meet. Lower parts purplish cream-color,\r\nor rosy ochraceous-white, deepest posteriorly; jugulum, breast, sides,\r\nflanks, and tibiæ with longitudinal stripes of plumbeous-black, these\r\nbroadest on flanks and abdomen, and somewhat sagittate on the tibiæ;\r\nlower tail-coverts with distant transverse bars. Lining of the wing\r\nlike the sides, but the markings more transverse; inner web of longest\r\nprimary with nine transverse purplish-ochre spots. Wing-formula, 2–1, 3.\r\nWing, 12.50; tail, 7.00. Length, 16.50; expanse, 39.25. Weight, 1½ lbs.\r\nBasal half of bill pale bluish-white, cere rather darker; terminal half\r\n(rather abruptly) slate-color, the tip deepening into black; iris very\r\ndark vivid vandyke-brown; naked orbital space pale bluish-white, with a\r\nslight greenish tint; tarsi and toes lemon-yellow, with a slight green\r\ncast; claws jet-black.\r\n\r\nHAB. Entire continent of America, and neighboring islands.\r\n\r\nLocalities: Guatemala (SCL. Ibis I, 219); Veragua (SALV. P. Z. S. 1867,\r\n158); Sta. Cruz (NEWTON, Ibis, I, 63); Trinidad (TAYLOR, Ibis, 1864,\r\n80); Bahamas (BRYANT, Pr. Bost. Soc. 1859, VII); Cuba (CAB. Journ.\r\nII, lxxxiii); (GUNDL. Repert. 1865, 225); Jamaica, (GOSSE, B. Jam.\r\n16; MARCH, Pr. Ac. N. S. 1863, 304, et Mus. S. I.); Tierra del Fuego\r\n(SHARPE, Ann. & Mag. N. H.; “_F. cassini_, SHARPE”).\r\n\r\nThe young plumage above described corresponds exactly with that of\r\nyoung _peregrinus_ from Europe, a comparison of the specimen above\r\ndescribed with one of the same age from Germany (54,064, Schlüter Col.)\r\nshowing no differences that can be expressed. Many American specimens in\r\nthis plumage (as 19,397, Fort Simpson) show a wash of whitish over the\r\nforehead and anterior part of the crown; having before us but the one\r\nspecimen, we cannot say whether or not this is ever seen in the European\r\nbird. Specimens more advanced in season—perhaps in second year—are\r\ncolored as follows: The black above is more brownish, the feathers\r\nmargined with pale brown,—these margins broader, and approaching to\r\nwhite, on the upper tail-coverts; the tail shows the ochraceous bars\r\nonly on inner webs. The supraoral stripe of the youngest plumage is also\r\nquite apparent.\r\n\r\nA still younger one from the same locality (No. 37,397) has the upper\r\nplumage similar to the last, the pale edges to the feathers, however,\r\nmore distinct; tail with conspicuous spots. White beneath clearer, and\r\ninvading the dusky of the head above as far back as the middle of the\r\ncrown; the supraoral stripe is distinct, scarcely interrupted across the\r\nnape.\r\n\r\nIn the adult plumage the principal variation is in the extent and\r\ndisposition of the bars beneath. In most individuals they are regularly\r\ntransverse only laterally and posteriorly, those on the belly being\r\nsomewhat broken into more irregular cordate spots, though always\r\ntransverse; in no American specimen, however, are they as continuously\r\ntransverse as in a male (No. 18,804) from Europe, which, however, in\r\nthis respect, we think, forms an exception to most European examples,\r\nat least to those in the Smithsonian Collection. All variations in\r\nthe form, thickness, and continuity of the markings below, and in the\r\ndistinctness of the bars above, are individual.\r\n\r\nVery old males (as 49,790, Fort Yukon; 27,188, Moose Factory (type of\r\nElliott’s figure of _F. peregrinus_, in Birds of America); and 42,997,\r\nSpanishtown, Jamaica) lack almost entirely the reddish tinge beneath,\r\nand have the lateral and posterior portions strongly tinged with blue;\r\nthe latter feature is especially noticeable in the specimen from\r\nJamaica, in which also the bars are almost utterly wanting medially.\r\nImmature birds from this island also lack to a great degree the\r\nochraceous tinge, leaving the whitish everywhere purer.\r\n\r\nA female adult European bird differs from the average of North American\r\nexamples in the conspicuous longitudinal streaks on the jugulum; but in\r\na male these are hardly more distinct than in 13,077, ♀, Liberty Co.,\r\nGeorgia; 11,983, “United States”; 35,456, Peel’s River; 35,449, ♀, and\r\n35,445, ♀, Fort Yukon, Alaska; 35,452, La Pierre’s Hous., H. B. Ter.;\r\n35,459 ♂, Fort Anderson; and 28,099 ♀, Hartford, Conn. In none of these,\r\nhowever, are they so numerous and conspicuous as in a European female\r\nfrom the Schlüter Collection, which, however, differs in these respects\r\nonly from North American specimens.\r\n\r\nA somewhat melanistic individual (in second year? 32,735, Chicago,\r\nIll.; Robert Kennicott) differs as follows: Above continuously pure\r\nblack; upper tail-coverts and longer scapulars bordered terminally\r\nwith rusty-whitish. Tail distinctly tipped with white; the inner webs\r\nof feathers with eight elliptical transverse bars of pale ochraceous,\r\nand indications of corresponding spots of the same on outer webs,\r\nforming as many inconspicuous bands. Beneath ochraceous-white; the neck,\r\nbreast, and abdomen thickly marked with broad longitudinal stripes\r\nof clear black,—those on the jugulum cuneate, and on the breast and\r\nabdomen broadly sagittate; the tibiæ with numerous cordate spots, and\r\nsides marked more transversely; lower tail-coverts with narrow distant\r\ntransverse bars. On the chin and throat only, the whitish is immaculate,\r\non the other portions being somewhat exceeded in amount by the black.\r\nInner web of longest primary with seven transverse elliptical bars of\r\ncream-color. Wing, 12.20; tail, 9.40.\r\n\r\nWhether the North American and European Peregrine Falcons are or are not\r\ndistinct has been a question undecided up to the present day; almost\r\nevery ornithologist having his own peculiar views upon the relationship\r\nof the different forms which have been from time to time characterized.\r\nThe most favorably received opinion, however, seems to be that there\r\nare two species on the American continent, and that one of these, the\r\nnorthern one, is identical with the European bird. Both these views\r\nI hold to be entirely erroneous; for after examining and comparing\r\ncritically a series of more than one hundred specimens of these birds,\r\nfrom every portion of America (except eastern South America), including\r\nnearly all the West India Islands, as well as numbers of localities\r\nthroughout continental North and South America, I find that, with\r\nthe exception of the melanistic littoral race of the northwest coast\r\n(var. _pealei_), they all fall under one race, which, though itself\r\nexceedingly variable, yet possesses characters whereby it may always be\r\ndistinguished from the Peregrine of all portions of the Old World.\r\n\r\nThere is such a great amount of variability, in size, colors, and\r\nmarkings, that the _F. nigriceps_, Cassin, must be entirely ignored\r\nas being based upon specimens not distinguishable in any respect from\r\ntypical _anatum_. Judging from the characters assigned to the _F.\r\ncassini_ by its describer (who evidently had a very small series of\r\nAmerican specimens at his command), the latter name must also most\r\nprobably fall into the list of synonymes of _anatum_.\r\n\r\nSlight as are the characters which separate the Peregrines of the\r\nNew and Old World, i.e. the immaculate jugulum of the former and the\r\nstreaked one of the latter, they are yet sufficiently constant to\r\nwarrant their separation as geographical races of one species; along\r\nwith which the _F. melanogenys_, Gould (Australia), _F. minor_, Bonap.\r\n(South Africa), _F. orientalis_, Gmel. (E. Asia), and _F. calidus_,\r\nLath. (Southern India and East Indies), must also rank as simple\r\ngeographical races of the same species. Whether the _F. calidus_ is\r\ntenable, I am unable to state, for I have not seen it; but the others\r\nappear to be all sufficiently differentiated. The _F. radama_, Verreaux\r\n(Gray’s Hand List, p. 19, No. 170), Mr. Gurney writes me, is the young\r\nfemale of var. _minor_. Whether the _F. peregrinator_, Sundevall (Gray’s\r\nHand List, No. 169), is another of the regional forms of _F. communis_,\r\nor a distinct species, I am not able at present to say, not having\r\nspecimens accessible to me for examination.\r\n\r\nMr. Cassin’s type of “_nigriceps_” (13,856, ♂, July), from Chile, is\r\nbefore me, and upon comparison with adult males from Arctic America\r\npresents no tangible differences beyond its smaller size; the wing\r\nis a little more than half an inch, and the middle toe less than the\r\neighth of an inch, shorter than in the smallest of the North American\r\nseries,—a discrepancy slight indeed, and of little value as the sole\r\nspecific character; the plumage being almost precisely similar to that\r\nof the specimen selected for the type of the description at the head of\r\nthis article. In order to show the little consequence to be attached\r\nto the small size of the individual just mentioned, I would state that\r\nthere is before me a young bird, received from the National Museum of\r\nChile, and obtained in the vicinity of Santiago, which is precisely\r\nsimilar in plumage to the Nevada specimen described, and in size is even\r\nconsiderably larger, though it is but just to say that it is a female;\r\nthe wing measures 13.25, instead of 12.50, and the middle toe, 2.00,\r\ninstead of 1.85. No. 37,336, Tres Marias Islands, Western Mexico,—a\r\nyoung male in second year,—has the wing just the same length as in\r\nthe smallest North American example, while in plumage it is precisely\r\nsimilar to 26,785, of the same age, from Jamaica. No. 4,367, from\r\nPuget’s Sound, Washington Territory,—also a young male,—has the wing of\r\nthe same length as in the largest northern specimen, while the plumage\r\nis as usual.\r\n\r\nTwo adult females from Connecticut (Nos. 28,099 and 32,507, Talcott Mt.)\r\nare remarkable for their very deep colors, in which they differ from all\r\nother North American examples which I have seen, and answer in every\r\nparticular to the description of _F. cassini_, Sharpe, above cited.\r\nThe upper surface is plumbeous-black, becoming deep black anteriorly,\r\nthe head without a single light feather in the black portions; the\r\nplumbeous bars are distinct only on the rump, upper tail-coverts, and\r\ntail, and are just perceptible on the secondaries. The lower parts are\r\nof a very deep reddish-ochraceous, deepest on the breast and abdomen,\r\nwhere it approaches a cinnamon tint,—the markings, however, as in other\r\nexamples. They measure, wing, 14.75; tail, 7.50; culmen, 1.05–1.15;\r\ntarsus, 2.00; middle toe, 2.30. They were obtained from the nest, and\r\nkept in confinement three years, when they were sacrificed to science.\r\nThe unusual size of the bill of these specimens (see measurements) is\r\nundoubtedly due to the influence of confinement, or the result of a\r\nmodified mode of feeding. The specimens were presented by Dr. S. S.\r\nMoses, of Hartford.\r\n\r\nAn adult male (No. 8,501) from Shoal-water Bay, Washington Territory,\r\nis exactly of the size of the male described. In this specimen there\r\nis not the slightest creamy tinge beneath, while the blue tinge on the\r\nlower parts laterally and posteriorly is very strong. No. 52,818, an\r\nadult female from Mazatlan, Western Mexico, has the wing three quarters\r\nof an inch shorter than in the largest of four northern females,\r\nand of the same length as in the smallest; there is nothing unusual\r\nabout its plumage, except that the bars beneath are sparse, and the\r\nochraceous tinge quite deep. No. 27,057, Fort Good Hope, H. B. T., is,\r\nhowever, exactly similar, in these respects, and the wing is but half\r\nan inch longer. In No. 47,588, ♂, from the Farallones Islands, near San\r\nFrancisco, California, the wing is the same length as in the average of\r\nnorthern and eastern specimens, while the streaks on the jugulum are\r\nnearly as conspicuous as in a male from Europe.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I would say that the sole distinguishing character\r\nbetween the Peregrines from America and those from Europe, that can be\r\nrelied on, appears to be found in the markings on the breast in the\r\nadult plumage; in all the specimens and figures of var. _communis_ that\r\nI have seen, the breast has the longitudinal dashes very conspicuous;\r\nwhile, as a general rule, in _anatum_ these markings are entirely\r\nabsent, though sometimes present, and occasionally nearly as distinct as\r\nin European examples. Therefore, if this conspicuous streaking of the\r\nbreast is found in all European specimens, the American bird is entitled\r\nto separation as a variety; but if the breast is ever immaculate in\r\nEuropean examples, then _anatum_ must sink into a pure synonyme of\r\n_communis_. The var. _melanogenys_ is distinguished from both _communis_\r\nand _anatum_ by the black auriculars, or by a greater amount of black\r\non the side of the neck, and by more numerous and narrower bars on\r\nthe under surface. In the former feature examples of _anatum_ from\r\nthe southern extremity of South America approach quite closely to the\r\nAustralian form, as might be expected from the relative geographical\r\nposition of the two regions. The var. _minor_ is merely the smaller\r\nintertropical race of the Old World, perhaps better characterized\r\nthan the tropical American form named _F. nigriceps_ by Cassin, the\r\ncharacters of which are so unimportant, and withal so inconstant, as to\r\nforbid our recognizing it as a race of the same rank with the others.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF SPECIMENS EXAMINED.\r\n\r\nNational Museum, 45; Boston Society, 4; Philadelphia Academy, 22; Museum\r\nComp.

Northwest coast of North America, from Oregon to Sitka.\r\n\r\nThis curious race of _Falco communis_ is a good illustration of the\r\nclimatic peculiarity of the northwest coast region, to which I have\r\noften referred before; the same melanistic tendency being apparent in\r\nbirds of other species from the same region, as an example of which I\r\nmay mention the Black Merlin (_Falco æsalon_, var. _suckleyi_), which is\r\na perfect miniature of the present bird.\r\n\r\nHABITS. The Great-footed Hawk of North America is very closely allied\r\nto the well-known Peregrine Falcon of Europe, and so closely resembles\r\nit that by many writers, even at the present day, it is regarded as\r\nidentical with it. Without doubt, the habits of the two races are very\r\nnearly the same, though the peculiarities of the North American bird are\r\nnot so well known as are those of the European. In its distribution it\r\nis somewhat erratic, for the most part confined to the rocky sea-coast,\r\nthe river-banks, and the high ground of the northeastern parts of\r\nAmerica. It is known to breed in a few isolated rocky crags in various\r\nparts of the country, even as far to the south as Pennsylvania, and it\r\noccurs probably both as migrant and resident in several of the West\r\nIndia Islands, in Central and in South America. A single specimen was\r\ntaken by Dr. Woodhouse in the Creek country of the Indian Territory. Two\r\nindividuals are reported by Von Pelzeln as having been taken in Brazil.\r\nThe Newtons met with it in St. Croix. Mr. Gosse found it in Jamaica, and\r\nDr. Gundlach gives it as a bird of Cuba. Jardine states it to be a bird\r\nof Bermuda, and also that it has been taken in the Straits of Magellan.\r\nA single specimen was taken at Dueñas, Guatemala, in February, by Mr.\r\nSalvin.\r\n\r\nOn the Pacific coast this Falcon has been traced as far south as the\r\nlimit of the land. Dr. Cooper met with only two pairs, in March, 1854,\r\nfrequenting a high wooded cliff at Shoal-water Bay. Dr. Suckley procured\r\na single specimen from Steilacoom. Dr. Cooper states that the habits\r\nof these corresponded with those described for the _F. anatum_ and _F.\r\nperegrinus_, and that, like these Falcons, it is a terror to all land\r\nanimals weaker than itself. It is said to breed on the rocky cliffs of\r\nthe Pacific.\r\n\r\nAn individual of this bird was taken by Colonel Grayson at the Tres\r\nMarias Islands. When shot, it was endeavoring to capture a Sparrow-hawk,\r\nindicating its indifference as to the game it pursues. He adds that\r\nthis bird attacks with vigor everything it sees, from the size of a\r\nMallard Duck down, and is the terror of all small birds. Its range must\r\nbe very great, as it often ventures far out to sea. On his passage from\r\nMazatlan to San Francisco, in 1858, on the bark Carlota, one of these\r\nFalcons came on board more than a hundred miles off the coast of Lower\r\nCalifornia, and took up its quarters on the main-top yard, where it\r\nremained two days, during which time it captured several Dusky Petrels.\r\nIt would dart headlong upon these unsuspecting birds, seldom missing\r\nits aim. It would then return to its resting-place and partly devour\r\nits prize. At other times it dropped its victims into the sea in wanton\r\nsport. Finally, as if tired of this kind of game, it made several wide\r\ncircles around the ship, ascended to a considerable height, and departed\r\nin the direction of the Mexican shore.\r\n\r\nThis Falcon is found along the Atlantic coast from Maine to the extreme\r\nnorthern portion, breeding on the high rocky cliffs of Grand Menan and\r\nin various favorable situations thence northward. A few breed on Mount\r\nTom, near the Connecticut River in Massachusetts, on Talcott Mountain in\r\nConnecticut, in Pennsylvania, and near Harper’s Ferry, in Maryland.\r\n\r\nMr. Boardman has several times taken their eggs from the cliffs of Grand\r\nMenan, where they breed in April, or early in May. In one instance he\r\nfound the nest in close proximity to that of a pair of Ravens, the two\r\nfamilies being apparently on terms of amity or mutual tolerance.\r\n\r\nFor several years two or more pairs of these birds have been known to\r\nbreed regularly on Mount Tom, near Northampton. The nests were placed\r\non the edges of precipitous rocks very early in the spring, the young\r\nhaving been fully grown by the last of June. Their young and their eggs\r\nhave been taken year after year, yet at the last accounts they still\r\ncontinued to nest in that locality. Dr. W. Wood has also found this\r\nspecies breeding on Talcott Mountain, near Hartford. Four young were\r\nfound, nearly fledged, June 1. In one instance four eggs were taken\r\nfrom a nest on Mount Tom, by Mr. C. W. Bennett, as early as April 19.\r\nThis was in 1864. Several times since he has taken their eggs from the\r\nsame eyrie, though the Hawks have at times deserted it and sought other\r\nretreats. In one year a pair was twice robbed, and, as is supposed,\r\nmade a third nest, and had unfledged young as late as August. Mr. Allen\r\nstates that these Hawks repair to Mount Tom very early in the spring,\r\nand carefully watch and defend their eyrie, manifesting even more alarm\r\nat this early period, when it is approached, than they evince later,\r\nwhen it contains eggs or young. Mr. Bennett speaks of the nest as a mere\r\napology for one.\r\n\r\nThis Hawk formerly nested on a high cliff near the house of Professor\r\nS. S. Haldeman, Columbia, Penn., who several times procured young birds\r\nwhich had fallen from the nest. The birds remained about this cliff\r\nten or eleven months of the year, only disappearing during the coldest\r\nweather, and returning with the first favorable change. They bred\r\nearly in spring, the young leaving the nest perhaps in May. Professor\r\nHaldeman was of the opinion that but a single pair remained, the young\r\ndisappearing in the course of the season.\r\n\r\nSir John Richardson, in his Arctic expedition in 1845, while descending\r\nthe Mackenzie River, latitude 65°, noticed what he presumed to be a nest\r\nof this species, placed on the cliff of a sandstone rock. This Falcon\r\nwas rare on that river.\r\n\r\nMr. MacFarlane found this species not uncommon on the banks of Lockhart\r\nand Anderson Rivers, in the Arctic regions. In one instance he mentions\r\nfinding a nest on a cliff thirty feet from the ground. There were four\r\neggs lying on a ledge of the shale of which the cliff was composed.\r\nBoth parents were present, and kept up a continued screaming, though at\r\ntoo great a distance for him to shoot either. He adds that this bird is\r\nby no means scarce on Lockhart River, and he was informed that it also\r\nnests along the ramparts and other steep banks of the Upper Anderson,\r\nthough he has not been able to learn that it has been found north of\r\nFort Anderson. In another instance the nest was on a ledge of clayey\r\nmud,—the eggs, in fact, lying on the bare ground, and nothing resembling\r\na nest to be seen. A third nest was found on a ledge of crumbling\r\nshale, along the banks of the Anderson River, near the outlet of the\r\nLockhart. This Hawk, he remarks, so far as he was able to observe,\r\nconstructs no nest whatever. At least, on the Anderson River, where he\r\nfound it tolerably abundant, it was found to invariably lay its eggs on\r\na ledge of rock or shale, without making use of any accessory lining or\r\nprotection, always availing itself of the most inaccessible ledges. He\r\nwas of the opinion that they do not breed to the northward of the 68th\r\nparallel. They were also to be found nesting in occasional pairs along\r\nthe lime and sandstone banks of the Mackenzie, where early in August,\r\nfor several successive years, he noticed the young of the season fully\r\nfledged, though still attended by the parent birds.\r\n\r\nIn subsequent notes, Mr. MacFarlane repeats his observations that this\r\nspecies constructs no nest, merely laying its eggs on a ledge of shale\r\nor other rock. Both parents were invariably seen about the spot. In some\r\ninstances the eggs found were much larger than in others.\r\n\r\nMr. Dall mentions shooting a pair near Nuk´koh, on the Yukon River, that\r\nhad a nest on a dead spruce. The young, on the 1st of June, were nearly\r\nready to fly. It was not a common species, but was found from Nulato to\r\nSitka and Kodiak.\r\n\r\nIn regard to general characteristics of this Falcon, they do not\r\napparently differ in any essential respects from those of the\r\nbetter-known _Falco communis_ of the Old World. It flies with immense\r\nrapidity, rarely sails in the manner of other Hawks, and then only for\r\nbrief periods and when disappointed in some attempt upon its prey.\r\nIn such cases, Mr. Audubon states, it merely rises in a broad spiral\r\ncircuit, in order to reconnoitre a space below. It then flies swiftly\r\noff in quest of plunder. These flights are made in the manner of the\r\nWild Pigeon. When it perceives its object, it increases the flappings of\r\nits wings, and pursues its victim with a surprising rapidity. It turns,\r\nand winds, and follows every change of motion of the object of pursuit\r\nwith instantaneous quickness. Occasionally it seizes a bird too heavy to\r\nbe managed, and if this be over the water it drops it, if the distance\r\nto land be too great, and flies off in pursuit of another. Mr. Audubon\r\nhas known one of this species to come at the report of a gun, and carry\r\noff a Teal not thirty steps distant from the sportsman who had killed\r\nit. This daring conduct is a characteristic trait.\r\n\r\nThis bird is noted for its predatory attacks upon water-fowl, but it\r\ndoes not confine itself to such prey. In the interior, Richardson states\r\nthat it preys upon the Wild Pigeon, and upon smaller birds. In one\r\ninstance Audubon has known one to follow a tame Pigeon to its house,\r\nentering it at one hole and instantly flying out at the other. The same\r\nwriter states that he has seen this bird feeding on dead fish that had\r\nfloated to the banks of the Mississippi. Occasionally it alights on the\r\ndead branch of a tree in the neighborhood of marshy ground, and watches,\r\napparently surveying, piece by piece, every portion of the territory. As\r\nsoon as it perceives a suitable victim, it darts upon it like an arrow.\r\nWhile feeding, it is said to be very cleanly, tearing the flesh, after\r\nremoving the feathers, into small pieces, and swallowing them one by\r\none.\r\n\r\nThe European species, as is well known, was once largely trained for the\r\nchase, and even to this day is occasionally used for this purpose; its\r\ndocility in confinement, and its wonderful powers of flight, rendering\r\nit an efficient assistant to the huntsman. We have no reason to doubt\r\nthat our own bird might be made equally serviceable.\r\n\r\nExcepting during the breeding-season, it is a solitary bird. It mates\r\nearly in February, and even earlier in the winter. Early in the fall\r\nthe families separate, and each bird seems to keep to itself until the\r\nperiod of reproduction returns.\r\n\r\nIn confinement, birds of this family become quite tame, can be trained\r\nto habits of wonderful docility and obedience, and evince even an\r\naffection for the one who cares for their wants.\r\n\r\nThis species appears to nest almost exclusively on cliffs, and rarely,\r\nif ever, to make any nests in other situations. In a few rare and\r\nexceptional cases this Falcon has been known to construct a nest in\r\ntrees. Mr. Ord speaks of its thus nesting among the cedar swamps of New\r\nJersey; but this fact has been discredited, and there has been no recent\r\nevidence of its thus breeding in that State. Mr. Dall found its nest in\r\na tree in Alaska, but makes no mention of its peculiarities.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of this species are of a rounded-oval shape, and range from\r\n2.00 to 2.22 inches in length, and from 1.60 to 1.90 in width. Five\r\neggs, from Anderson River, have an average size of 2.09 by 1.65 inches.\r\nAn egg from Mount Tom, Mass., is larger than any other I have seen,\r\nmeasuring 2.22 inches in length by 1.70 in breadth, and differs in the\r\nbrighter coloring and a larger proportion of red in its markings. The\r\nground is a deep cream-color, but is rarely visible, being generally\r\nso entirely overlaid by markings as nowhere to appear. In many the\r\nground-color appears to have a reddish tinge, probably due to the brown\r\nmarkings which so nearly conceal it. In others, nothing appears but a\r\ndeep coating of dark ferruginous or chocolate-brown, not homogeneous,\r\nbut of varying depth of coloring, and here and there deepening into\r\nalmost blackness. In one egg, from Anderson River, the cream-colored\r\nground is very apparent, and only sparingly marked with blotches of a\r\nlight brown, with a shading of bronze. An egg from the cabinet of Mr.\r\nDickinson, of Springfield, taken on Mount Tom, Massachusetts, is boldly\r\nblotched with markings of a bright chestnut-brown, varying greatly in\r\nits shadings.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Subgenus_ ÆSALON, KAUP.\r\n\r\n  _Æsalon_, KAUP, 1829.

CHAR. _Adult male._ Above cinereous, varying in shade, but generally\r\nof a slaty-bluish cast; each feather with a distinct shaft-streak of\r\nblack, these lines most conspicuous on the head above. Tail with a\r\nvery broad subterminal band of black, about one inch in width; there\r\nare indications of three other bands, their continuity and distinction\r\nvarying with the individual, but generally quite conspicuous, and each\r\nabout half the width of the terminal one; the subterminal black band\r\nis succeeded by a terminal one of white, of about three-sixteenths of\r\nan inch in width, sometimes broader; on the lateral feathers the black\r\nbands are always conspicuous, being in form of transverse oblong spots,\r\ncrossing the shaft, but less extended on the outer web, which is often\r\nimmaculate except at the end, the broad terminal band always extending\r\nto the edge of the feather. Primaries dusky-black, margined terminally\r\nmore or less distinctly with whitish (sometimes fading on the edge\r\nonly); on the inner web is a series of about eight transverse oval\r\nspots of white, and generally corresponding to these are indications of\r\nbluish-ashy spots on the outer web. Beneath white, this purest on the\r\nthroat, which is immaculate: there is generally a more or less strong\r\ntinge of fulvous beneath, this always prevalent on the tibiæ, and on a\r\ndistinct collar extending round the nape, interrupting the blue above;\r\nthe tibiæ frequently incline to ochraceous-rufous. Lateral portions of\r\nthe head with fine streaks of dusky, these thickest on upper edge of\r\nthe ear-coverts, leaving a distinct whitish superciliary streak, those\r\nof opposite sides meeting on the forehead. Breast, upper part of the\r\nabdomen, sides, and flanks, with longitudinal stripes of umber, each\r\nwith a shaft-streak of black; on the flanks their shape is modified,\r\nhere taking the form of spots running in chain-like series; tibiæ with\r\nnarrower and darker streaks; lower tail-coverts with narrow central\r\nstreaks like those on the tibiæ. Frequently there is a strong bluish\r\nshade on flanks and lower tail-coverts, sometimes replacing the brown\r\nof the spots on the former, and clouding in a similar form the latter.\r\nLength, 11.00; extent, 23.75; wing, 7.75.\r\n\r\n_Adult female._ Pattern of coloration as in the male, but the colors\r\ndifferent. The blue above replaced by dark umber-brown with a plumbeous\r\ncast, and showing more or less distinct darker shaft-lines; these on\r\nthe head above very broad, giving a streaked appearance; white spots\r\non inner webs of primaries more ochraceous than in the male. Tail dark\r\nplumbeous-brown, shading into blackish toward end, with five rather\r\nnarrow ochraceous or soiled white bars, the first of which is concealed\r\nby the upper coverts, the last terminal. White beneath, less tinged\r\nwith reddish than in the male, the tibiæ not different from the other\r\nportions; markings beneath as in the male.\r\n\r\n_Juv._ Above plumbeous-brown, tinged with fulvous on head, and more\r\nor less washed with the same on the rump; frequently the feathers\r\nof the back, rump, scapulars, and wings pass into a reddish tinge\r\nat the edge; this color is, however, always prevalent on the head,\r\nwhich is conspicuously streaked with dusky. Tail plumbeous-dusky,\r\ndarker terminally, with five regular light bars, those toward the base\r\nashy, as they approach the end becoming more ochraceous; these bars\r\nare more continuous and regular than in the adult female, and are\r\neven conspicuous on the middle feathers. Primaries dusky, passing on\r\nedge (terminally) into lighter; spots on the inner webs broader than\r\nin the female, and pinkish-ochre; outer webs with less conspicuous\r\ncorresponding spots of the same. Beneath soft ochraceous; spots as in\r\nadult female, but less sharply defined; tibiæ not darker than abdomen.\r\n\r\nHAB.

The upper tail-coverts are tipped with white; the tail is\r\na quarter of an inch longer than in any North American specimen, one\r\nhalf-inch longer than the average; the wing, however, is about the same.\r\n\r\nA specimen from Santa Clara, California (4,475, Dr. J. G. Cooper), like\r\nmost of those from the Pacific coast, has the cinereous very dark above,\r\nwhile beneath the ochraceous is everywhere prevalent; the flanks are\r\nstrongly tinged with blue; the black bars of the tail are much broken\r\nand irregular. A specimen from Jamaica (24,309, Spanish Town; W. T.\r\nMarch), however, is even darker than this one, the stripes beneath being\r\nalmost pure black; on the tail black prevails, although the bands are\r\nvery regular. Nos. 27,061, Fort Good Hope, British America, 43,136, Fort\r\nYukon, Alaska, and 51,305, Mazatlan, Mexico, have the streaks beneath\r\nnarrow and linear; the ochraceous confined to the tibiæ, which are of a\r\ndeep shade of this color.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Falco columbarius._]\r\n\r\nA specimen from Nicaragua (No. 40,957, Chinandega) is like North\r\nAmerican examples, but the reddish tinge beneath is scarcely\r\ndiscernible, and confined to the tibiæ, which are but faintly\r\nochraceous; the markings beneath are broad and deep umber, the black\r\nshaft-streak distinct.\r\n\r\nIn the adult female there is as little variation as in the male in\r\nplumage, the shade of brown above varying slightly, also the yellowish\r\ntinge beneath; the bars on the tail differ in continuity and tint in\r\nvarious specimens, although they are always five in number,—the first\r\nconcealed by the coverts, the last terminal. In 19,382, Fort Simpson,\r\nBritish America, and 2,706, Yukon, R. Am. (probably very old birds), the\r\nlight bars are continuous and pale dull ashy.\r\n\r\nThe young vary about the same as adults. Nos. 19,381, Big Island,\r\nGreat Slave Lake; 5,483, Petaluma, California; and 3,760, Racine,\r\nWisconsin,—are young males moulting, scattered feathers appearing on the\r\nupper parts indicating the future blue plumage.\r\n\r\n\r\nVar. suckleyi, RIDGWAY.\r\n\r\nBLACK MERLIN.\r\n\r\nSP.

Above, uniform\r\nfuliginous-black, the secondaries and tail-feathers very narrowly but\r\nsharply tipped with white, and the primaries passing into whitish\r\non their terminal margin; nuchal region with concealed spotting of\r\npale rusty or dingy whitish. Beneath, longitudinally striped with\r\nfuliginous-black, or dark sooty-brown, and pale ochraceous; the former\r\npredominating on the breast, the latter prevailing on the throat and\r\nanal region. Sides and flanks nearly uniform dusky, with roundish white\r\nspots on both webs; lower tail-coverts with a broad sagittate spot of\r\ndusky on each feather. Lining of the wing fuliginous-dusky, with sparse,\r\nsmall roundish spots of white. Inner webs of primaries plain dusky,\r\nwithout spots, or else with them only faintly indicated.

Puget Sound, Steilacoom,\r\nYreka, California (Oct.), and Shoalwater Bay (_National Museum_).\r\n\r\nThe plumage of this race is the chief point wherein it differs from the\r\nother forms of the species; and in its peculiarities we find just what\r\nshould be expected from the Oregon region, merely representing as it\r\ndoes the melanistic condition so frequently observable in birds from the\r\nnorthwest coast.\r\n\r\nThe upper parts are unicolored, being continuous blackish-plumbeous\r\nfrom head to tail. The tail is tipped with white, but the bars are very\r\nfaintly indicated, being in No. 4,499 altogether wanting, while in\r\n21,333 they can scarcely be discovered, and only four are indicated;\r\nin the others there is the usual number, but they are very obsolete.\r\nIn No. 4,499, the most extreme example, the spots on the inner webs of\r\nthe primaries are also wanting; the sides of the head are very thickly\r\nstreaked, the black predominating, leaving the superciliary stripe\r\nill-defined; the throat is streaked, and the other dark markings beneath\r\nare so exaggerated that they cover all portions, and give the prevailing\r\ncolor; the under tail-coverts have broad central cordate black spots.\r\n\r\nAnother specimen from this region (4,476, Puget Sound) is similar, but\r\nthe spots on primaries are conspicuous, as in examples of the typical\r\nstyle; indeed, except in the most extreme cases, these spots will always\r\nbe found indicated, leading us to the unavoidable conclusion that the\r\nspecimens in question represent merely the fuliginous condition of\r\nthe common species; not the condition of _melanism_, but the peculiar\r\ndarkened plumage characteristic of many birds of the northwest coast,\r\nthe habitat of the present bird; it should then be considered as rather\r\na geographical race, co-equal to the _Falco gyrfalco_, var. _labradora_,\r\n_F. peregrinus_, var. _pealei_, and other forms, and not confounded with\r\nthe individual condition of _melanism_, as seen in certain species of\r\n_Buteones_.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF SPECIMENS EXAMINED.\r\n\r\nNational Museum, 6.\r\n\r\n_Measurements._\r\n\r\n +----+-----------+-----------+---------+---------+-----------+----------+\r\n |Sex.|   Wing.   |   Tail.   | Culmen. | Tarsus. |Middle Toe.|Specimens.|\r\n +----+-----------+-----------+---------+---------+-----------+----------+\r\n | ♂  |  7.35–7.70|  5.25–5.60|  .48–.50|1.30–1.45|  1.20–0.00|    3     |\r\n +----+-----------+-----------+---------+---------+-----------+----------+\r\n | ♀  |  8.25–8.50|  5.70–5.80|  .55–.60|1.50–1.60|  1.35–1.40|    3     |\r\n +----+-----------+-----------+---------+---------+-----------+----------+\r\n\r\nSecond quill longest; first quill equal to, a little shorter than, or a\r\nlittle longer than, the fourth.\r\n\r\n\r\nVar. richardsoni, RIDGWAY.\r\n\r\nRICHARDSON’S MERLIN.\r\n\r\n  _Falco æsalon_, RICH. & SWAINS.

Upper\r\nplumage dull earth-brown, each feather grayish-umber centrally, and\r\nwith a conspicuous black shaft-line. Head above approaching ashy-white\r\nanteriorly, the black shaft-streaks being very conspicuous. Secondaries,\r\nprimary coverts, and primaries margined terminally with dull white; the\r\nprimary coverts with two transverse series of pale ochraceous spots;\r\nouter webs of primaries with spots of the same, corresponding with those\r\non the inner webs. Upper tail-coverts tipped, and spotted beneath the\r\nsurface, with white. Tail clear drab, much lighter than the primaries,\r\nbut growing darker terminally, having basally a slightly ashy cast;\r\ncrossed with six sharply defined, perfectly continuous bands (the last\r\nterminal) of ashy-white. Head, frontally, laterally, and beneath,—a\r\ncollar around the nape (interrupting the brown above),—and the entire\r\nlower parts, white, somewhat ochraceous, this most perceptible on the\r\ntibiæ; cheeks and ear-coverts with sparse, fine hair-like streaks of\r\nblack; nuchal collar, jugulum, breast, abdomen, sides, and flanks with\r\na medial linear stripe of clear ochre-brown on each feather; these\r\nstripes broadest on the flanks; each stripe with a conspicuously black\r\nshaft-streak; tibiæ and lower tail-coverts with fine shaft-streaks of\r\nbrown, like the broader stripes of the other portions. Chin and throat,\r\nonly, immaculate. Lining of the wing spotted with ochraceous-white\r\nand brown, in about equal amount, the former in spots approaching the\r\nshaft.

Now, however, I incline strongly\r\nto the theory that it represents merely the light form of the central\r\nprairie regions, of the common species; since its characters seem to\r\nbe so analogous to those of the races of _Buteo borealis_ and _Bubo\r\nvirginianus_ of the same country. It is doubtful whether some very\r\nlight-colored adult males, supposed to belong to _columbarius_, as\r\nrestricted, should not in reality be referred to this race, as the adult\r\nplumage of the male. But having seen no adult males from the region\r\ninhabited by the present bird obtained in the breeding-season, I am\r\nstill in doubt whether the present form ever assumes the blue plumage.\r\n\r\nAs regards the climatic or regional modifications experienced by the\r\n_Falco lithofalco_ on the American continent, the following summary\r\nof facts expresses my present views upon the subject. First: examples\r\nidentical in all respects, or at least presenting no variations beyond\r\nthose of an individual character, may be found from very widely\r\nseparated localities; but the theory of explanation is, that individuals\r\nof one race may become scattered during their migrations, or wander off\r\nfrom their breeding-places. Second: the Atlantic region, the region of\r\nthe plains, and the region of the northwest coast, have each a peculiar\r\nrace, characterized by features which are also distinctive of races\r\nof other birds of the same region, namely, very dark—the dark tints\r\nintensified, and their area extended—in the northwest coast region; very\r\nlight—the light markings extended and multiplied—in the middle region;\r\nand intermediate in the Atlantic region.\r\n\r\nHABITS. The distribution of the well-known Pigeon Hawk is very nearly\r\ncoextensive with the whole of North America. It is found in the\r\nbreeding-season as far to the north as Fort Anderson, on the Anderson\r\nand McKenzie rivers, ranging even to the Arctic coast. Specimens were\r\ntaken by Mr. Ross at Lapierre House and at Fort Good Hope. Several\r\nspecimens were taken by Mr. Dall at Nulato, where, he states, it is\r\nfound all the year round. They were also taken by Bischoff at Kodiak.\r\nDuring the breeding-season it is found as far south as Nova Scotia, New\r\nBrunswick, and the northern portions of Maine, and probably Vermont and\r\nNew York. It is abundant on the Pacific coast.\r\n\r\nIn the winter months it is to be met with throughout the more temperate\r\nportions of North America, in Mexico, Central America, and Northern\r\nSouth America. Dr. Woodhouse mentions finding this species very abundant\r\nespecially among the wooded banks of watercourses throughout Texas, New\r\nMexico, and the Indian Territory.\r\n\r\nMr. March states that this Hawk is a permanent resident in the island\r\nof Jamaica, more frequently found among the hills than on the plains,\r\nand has been known to breed there. It is a visitant of Cuba. Dr. Cooper\r\nthinks they are not very common in Washington Territory, though, as they\r\nare found there throughout the summer, they undoubtedly breed there. In\r\nAugust, 1855, Dr. Cooper shot one of a small family of young that had\r\nbut recently left their nest. They migrate southward in winter, and are\r\nabundant in California in October and November.\r\n\r\nDr. Suckley found them abundant about Fort Steilacoom early in August.\r\nNear Puget Sound this species is thought to breed in the recesses of\r\nthe Cascade Mountains, only coming down upon the open plains late in\r\nthe summer. Dr. Newberry found it paired and nesting about the Klamath\r\nLakes, and states that it also occupies all the region south of the\r\nColumbia, in Oregon. Mr. Dresser states that he found this Falcon common\r\nabout Bexar and the adjoining counties during the entire year, and that\r\nthey occasionally breed near the Medina River. I have been unable to\r\nfind any satisfactory evidence that this Hawk ever breeds in any part\r\nof Massachusetts, or anywhere south of the 44th parallel in the Eastern\r\nStates, except, perhaps, in mountainous regions.\r\n\r\nThis Hawk is remarkable for its rapid flight, and its courage and its\r\nenterprise in attacking birds as large as or even larger than itself,\r\nthough generally it only preys upon smaller birds, such as Grakles,\r\nRed-winged Blackbirds, Robins, and Pigeons. Dr. Cooper states that\r\nhaving been attracted by an unusual screaming of some bird close to the\r\nhouse, he was surprised to find that one of these Hawks had just seized\r\nupon a Flicker, a bird as large as itself, the weight of which had\r\nbrought it to the ground, and which it continued to hold in its claws\r\neven after it had been mortally wounded. Dr. Heermann once found one\r\nof these birds just preparing to feed on a large and plump California\r\nPartridge.\r\n\r\nIn Tamaulipas, Mexico, where Lieutenant Couch found it quite common,\r\nhe speaks of it as being very quiet, flying but little, and generally\r\nwatching for its quarry from the limb of a dry tree. Mr. Audubon makes\r\nno mention of any peculiarities of habits. Mr. Nuttall was evidently\r\nunfamiliar with it, stating it to be unknown in New England, and a\r\nresident of the Southern States only.\r\n\r\nIn Nova Scotia, Mr. Downes speaks of it as common, breeding in all the\r\nwooded parts of the country. It is said to be not troublesome to the\r\nfarmer, but to feed upon the smaller birds. He mentions that once, on\r\nhis voyage to Boston, one of these birds flew aboard and allowed itself\r\nto be captured, and was kept alive and fed readily, but soon after\r\nescaped.\r\n\r\nMr. B. R. Ross, in his notes on the birds and nests obtained by him\r\nin the country about Fort Resolution, Lapierre House, and Good Hope,\r\nmentions this bird as the most common of the true Falcons in that\r\ndistrict, where it ranges to the Arctic coast. Its nest is said to be\r\ncomposed of sticks, grass, and moss, and to be built generally in a\r\nthick tree, at no great elevation. The eggs, he adds, are from five\r\nto seven in number, 1.60 inches in length by 1.20 in breadth. Their\r\nground-color he describes as a light reddish-buff, clouded with deep\r\nchocolate and reddish-brown blotches, more thickly spread at the larger\r\nend of the egg, where the under tint is almost entirely concealed by\r\nthem. This description is given from three eggs procured with their\r\nparent at Fort Resolution.\r\n\r\nFrom Mr. MacFarlane’s notes, made from his observations in the Anderson\r\nRiver country, we gather that one nest was found on the ledge of a cliff\r\nof shaly mud on the banks of the Anderson River; another nest was on a\r\npine-tree, eight or nine feet from the ground, and composed of a few dry\r\nwillow-twigs and some half-decayed hay, etc. It was within two hundred\r\nyards of the river-bank. A third nest was in the midst of a small bushy\r\nbranch of a pine-tree, and was ten feet from the ground. It was composed\r\nof coarse hay, lined with some of a finer quality, but was far from\r\nbeing well arranged. Mr. MacFarlane was confident that it had never been\r\nused before by a Crow or by any other bird. The oviduct of the female\r\ncontained an egg ready to be laid. It was colored like the others, but\r\nthe shell was still soft, and adhered to the fingers on being touched.\r\nIn another instance the eggs were found on a ledge of shale in a cliff\r\non the bank, without anything under them in the way of lining. He adds\r\nthat they are even more abundant along the banks of the McKenzie than on\r\nthe Anderson River.\r\n\r\nMr. MacFarlane narrates that on the 25th of May an Indian in his employ\r\nfound a nest placed in the midst of a pine branch, six feet from the\r\nground, loosely made of a few dry sticks and a small quantity of coarse\r\nhay. It then contained two eggs. Both parents were seen, but when fired\r\nat were missed. On the 31st he revisited the nest, which still contained\r\nonly two eggs, and again missed the birds. He again went to the nest,\r\nseveral days after, to secure the parents, and was much surprised to\r\nfind that the eggs were gone. His first supposition was that some other\r\nperson had taken them, but, after looking carefully about, he perceived\r\nboth birds at a short distance; and this caused him to institute a\r\nsearch, which soon resulted in his finding that the eggs had been\r\nremoved by them to the face of a muddy bank at least forty yards distant\r\nfrom the original nest. A few decayed leaves had been placed under them,\r\nbut nothing else in the way of protection. A third egg had been added\r\nsince his previous examination. These facts Mr. MacFarlane carefully\r\ninvestigated, and vouches for their entire accuracy.\r\n\r\nAnother nest, containing four eggs, was on the ledge of a shaly cliff,\r\nand was composed of a very few decayed leaves placed under the eggs.\r\n\r\nMr. R. Kennicott found a nest, June 2, 1860, in which incubation had\r\nalready commenced. It was about a foot in diameter, was built against\r\nthe trunk of a poplar, and its base was composed of sticks, the upper\r\nparts consisting of mosses and fragments of bark.\r\n\r\nMr. Audubon mentions finding three nests of this bird in Labrador,\r\nin each of which there were five eggs. These nests were placed on\r\nthe top branches of the low firs peculiar to that country, composed\r\nof sticks, and slightly lined with moss and a few feathers. He\r\ndescribes the eggs as 1.75 inches long, and 1.25 broad, with a dull\r\nyellowish-brown ground-color, thickly clouded with irregular blotches\r\nof dark reddish-brown. One was found in the beginning of July, just\r\nready to hatch. The young are at first covered with a yellowish down.\r\nThe old birds are said to evince great concern respecting their eggs\r\nor young, remaining about them and manifesting all the tokens of anger\r\nand vexation of the most courageous species. A nest of this Hawk (S. I.\r\n7,127) was taken at St. Stephen, N. B., by Mr. W. F. Hall; and another\r\n(S. I. 15,546) in the Wahsatch Mountains, by Mr. Ricksecker. The latter\r\npossibly belonged to the var. _richardsoni_.\r\n\r\nThe nest of this bird found in Jamaica by Mr. March was constructed\r\non a lofty tree, screened by thick foliage, and was a mere platform\r\nof sticks and grass, matted with soft materials, such as leaves and\r\ngrasses. It contained four eggs, described as “round-oval or spherical”\r\nin shape, measuring “1.38 by 1.13 inches, of a dull clayish-white,\r\nmarked with sepia and burnt umber, confluent dashes and splashes,\r\nirregularly distributed, principally about the middle and the larger\r\nend.” Four others, taken from a nest in the St. Johns Mountains, were\r\noblong-oval, about the same size and nearly covered with chocolate and\r\number blotches. Mr. March thinks they belong to different species.\r\n\r\nMr. Hutchins, in his notes on the birds of Hudson’s Bay, states that\r\nthis species nests on rocks or in hollow trees; that the nest consists\r\nof sticks and grass, lined with feathers; and describes the eggs as\r\nwhite, thinly marked with red spots. In the oviduct of a Hawk which Dr.\r\nRichardson gives as _Falco æsalon_, were found “several full-sized white\r\neggs, clouded at one end by a few bronze-colored spots.” A nest was\r\nfound by Mr. Cheney at Grand Menan, from which he shot what he presumed\r\nto be the parent bird of this species. Its four eggs agreed with the\r\ndescriptions given by Hutchins and Richardson much more nearly than\r\nwith the eggs of this species. The eggs found by Mr. Cheney may have\r\nbeen very small eggs of _A. cooperi_, in which case the presence of the\r\n_columbarius_ on the nest cannot be so easily explained.\r\n\r\nThree eggs, two from Anderson River and one from Great Slave Lake, range\r\nfrom 1.53 to 1.60 inches in length, and from 1.20 to 1.22 in breadth,\r\ntheir average measurements being 1.56 by 1.21. They have a ground-color\r\nof a rich reddish-cream, very generally covered with blotches and finer\r\nmarkings of reddish-brown, deepening in places almost into blackness,\r\nand varying greatly in the depth of its shading, with a few lines of\r\nblack. In one the red-brown is largely replaced by very fine markings of\r\na yellowish sepia-brown, so generally diffused as to conceal the ground\r\nand give to it the appearance of a light buff. Mr. Ridgway, after a\r\ncareful analysis of the varying markings and sizes of twenty-one eggs,\r\nhas kindly given the following:—\r\n\r\n“Extremes of twenty-one eggs (mainly from Forts Yukon, Anderson,\r\nResolution, and MacKenzie rivers): largest (10,687, Yukon, June),\r\n1.75 × 1.28; smallest (8,808, Anderson River, June), 1.55 × 1.20. The\r\nground-color varies from creamy-white to deep purplish-rufous, there\r\nbeing one egg (4,090, Great Slave Lake, June 6, 1860) entirely and\r\nuniformly of the latter color; the lightest egg (normally marked, 2,663,\r\nSaskatchewan) is creamy-white, thickly sprinkled with dilute and deep\r\nshades of sepia-brown, thickly on large end, and sparsely, as well as\r\nmore finely, on the smaller end. The markings vary in color from dilute\r\nindian-red to blackish-chestnut.\r\n\r\n“_H. richardsoni_ is larger than _columbarius_, and probably has a\r\nlarger egg. There are no eggs such as Richardson describes in the series\r\nof _columbarius_ in the Smithsonian Collection.”\r\n\r\nThe var. _richardsoni_ was recognized by Richardson as distinct from\r\nthe more common _columbarius_; and a single specimen, killed at Carlton\r\nHouse, and submitted to Swainson, was pronounced by him, beyond doubt,\r\nidentical with the common Merlin of Europe. Other specimens have since\r\nbeen procured, and are now in the Smithsonian Collection. They are\r\nrecognized by Mr. Ridgway as identical with Richardson’s bird, but\r\nquite distinct from the _Æsalon_ of authors. He has named the species\r\nin honor of its first discoverer. Of its history and habits little is\r\nknown. A single pair were seen by Richardson in the neighborhood of\r\nCarlton House, in May, 1827, and the female was shot. In the oviduct\r\nthere were several full-sized white eggs, clouded at one end with a few\r\nbronze-colored spots. Another specimen, probably also a female, was shot\r\nat the Sault St. Marie, between Lakes Huron and Superior, but this was\r\nnot preserved.\r\n\r\nMr. Hutchins, in his notes on the Hudson’s Bay birds, states that\r\nthe Pigeon Hawk “makes its nest on the rocks and in hollow trees, of\r\nsticks and grass, lined with feathers, laying from two to four white\r\neggs, thinly marked with red spots.” As Hutchins has been found to be\r\ngenerally quite accurate in his statements, and as this description does\r\nnot at all apply either to the nest or the eggs of the _columbarius_,\r\nit is quite possible that he may have mistaken this species for the\r\nPigeon Hawk, and that this description of eggs and nests belongs not to\r\n_columbarius_, but to _richardsoni_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBGENUS RHYNCHOFALCO, RIDGWAY.\r\n\r\nSpecies.\r\n\r\n  =F. femoralis.= Wing, 9.30–11.60; tail, 6.30–8.80; culmen, .60–.80;\r\n  tarsus, 1.62–2.00; middle toe, 1.35–1.70.

CHAR. _Adult_ (sexes similar). Above uniform plumbeous, secondaries\r\nbroadly whitish at ends; tail with continuous narrow bands of white. A\r\npostocular, broad stripe (changing to reddish on nape, where the two of\r\nopposite sides are confluent), middle area of auriculars, and entire\r\nthroat and jugulum, white, unvariegated. Sides entirely uniform blackish\r\n(confluent on middle of abdomen), with narrow bars of white; posterior\r\nlower parts light ochraceous, immaculate. ♂. Wing, 9.90; tail, 6.70;\r\ntarsus, 1.62; middle toe, 1.45. ♀. Wing, 11.30; tail, 7.80; tarsus,\r\n1.70; middle toe, 1.55.\r\n\r\n_Young._ Similar to the adult, but with broad longitudinal stripes of\r\nblackish on the breast.\r\n\r\n_Adult male_ (No. 30,896, Mirador, E. Mexico; Dr. C. Sartorius). Above\r\nbrownish-slate, becoming gradually darker anteriorly, the head above\r\nbeing pure dark plumbeous; on the rump and upper tail-coverts the tint\r\ninclines to fine cinereous. Secondaries passing very conspicuously into\r\nwhite terminally; primaries plumbeous-dusky, their inner webs with\r\n(the longest with twelve) very regular, narrow, transverse bars of\r\nwhite (the outer web plain). Lining of the wing white (becoming more\r\nochraceous toward the edge); under coverts barred and serrated with\r\ndusky, the white, however, predominating. Tail black, basally with a\r\nperceptible plumbeous cast; crossed with eight narrow, transverse bands\r\nof white,—the first two of which are concealed by the coverts, the last\r\nterminal and about .27 of an inch in width; the rest are narrower,\r\ndiminishing in width as they approach the base. Upper tail-coverts\r\nbordered terminally with ashy-white, the longer with one or two\r\ntransverse bars of the same. Forehead (narrowly) white, this extending\r\ndown across the lores to the angle of the mouth; a broad, conspicuous\r\nsupraoral stripe, originating above the middle of the eye, and running\r\nback above the ear-coverts to the occiput (where the two of opposite\r\nsides are confluent), white, more fulvous-orange on the occiput; a\r\nbroad dark plumbeous stripe running from the posterior angle of the\r\neye back over upper edge of ear-coverts, and continuing (broadly) down\r\nthe side of the neck; another, but much smaller one, of similar color,\r\nstarting at lower border of bare suborbital space, passing downward\r\nacross the cheeks, forming a “mustache,” leaving the middle area of the\r\near-coverts, the chin, throat, and whole breast, white, the pectoral\r\nportion defined with a semicircular outline posteriorly. Broad area\r\ncovering the sides of the breast, sides, and flanks (meeting rather\r\nnarrowly across the upper part of the abdomen), black, with narrow,\r\nrather indistinct, transverse bars of white. Femorals, tibiæ, abdomen,\r\nanal region, and lower tail-coverts fine ochraceous-rufous, palest\r\nposteriorly, the whole region immaculate. Wing-formula, 3, 2–4–1, 5.\r\nWing, 9.90; tail, 6.70; tarsus, 1.62; middle toe, 1.45.\r\n\r\n_Adult_ ♀ (42,076. Mirador; Sartorius). Similar to the male in almost\r\nevery respect. Plumbeous above rather darker and more uniform, although\r\nthe difference is scarcely perceptible. Secondaries more broadly tipped\r\nwith white, and upper tail-coverts more conspicuously barred with the\r\nsame. White bars of the black areas beneath scarcely observable. Tail\r\nwith eight white bars, as in the male longest primary with fourteen\r\nwhite bars on inner web of longest. Wing-formula, 3, 2–4–5=1. Wing,\r\n11.30; tail, 7.80; tarsus, 1.70; middle toe, 1.55.\r\n\r\n_Juv. a_ (_intermediate stage_). ♂ (37,334, Mazatlan, W. Mexico; Col.\r\nA. J. Grayson). Plumbeous above darker and more brownish, uniform from\r\nrump to head, the former strongly tinged with rusty, this bordering\r\nthe feathers. Tail darker and more brownish; white bars ten in number,\r\ninstead of eight, narrower, and tinged with brownish; longest primary\r\nwith thirteen bars of white on inner web. Lining of the wing black,\r\nleaving only a broad ochraceous stripe along the edge; feathers of\r\nthe black portion with small circular white spots along their edges.\r\nBreast strongly tinged with ochraceous, and with large longitudinal\r\nblotches of black of cuneate form, and so crowded as to give almost the\r\npredominating color; the black patches lack entirely the white bars.\r\nWing-formula, 3=2–4–1–5. Wing, 10.00; tail, 7.20.\r\n\r\n♀ (55,019, Mazatlan, Grayson). Similar to the last, but lacking the\r\nrusty tinge on the rump; tail with eight white bars, as in the adult;\r\npectoral stripes narrower and less numerous than in the preceding, and\r\nwhite bars distinguishable on the black areas. Wing-formula, 3, 2–4–1–5.\r\nWing, 11.30; tail, 8.20.\r\n\r\n_b_ (_first plumage_). ♂ (45,693 and 49,508, Buenos Ayres, Conchitas;\r\nWilliam H. Hudson). Similar to immature male (37,334). Above dull\r\number-drab, darker on the head; feathers of back, scapular, rump, and\r\nwings fading on edges; rump much tinged with rusty, this bordering the\r\nfeathers. Tail with nine very obsolete, narrow, dull white bars, these\r\nnot touching the edge of the feather on either web. Longest primary with\r\nten transverse white bars on inner web. Beneath pale ochraceous, almost\r\nas deep anteriorly as posteriorly; dark areas restricted to a large\r\npatch on each side, and dull dark brown (very similar to the wings),\r\ninstead of black, and scarcely varied; breast and upper part of abdomen\r\n(between the blackish lateral patches) with large longitudinal cuneate\r\nblotches of the same. “Winter visitor.”\r\n\r\nHAB. Whole of South America; northward through Central America and\r\nMexico, across the Rio Grande, into Texas and New Mexico.\r\n\r\nLocalities: Guatemala (SCL. Ibis, I, 219); Cathagena (CASSIN, Pr.

Peru (SCL. & SALV. 1858, 570; 1869,\r\n155); Venezuela (SCL. & SALV. 1869, 252).\r\n\r\nA specimen from Paraguay (58,738, ♂ ? Capt. T. J. Page, U. S. N.)\r\nhas the slaty above lighter than in the Mirador male, approaching to\r\nash. The white bars on the black side-patches are very numerous and\r\nregular; the white of the forehead is more sharply defined, and the deep\r\nrufescent-ochre of the posterior portion of the postocular stripe is\r\neven deeper than that of the tibiæ, etc.; the breast has a few narrow\r\nblackish streaks. The bars on wings and tail, however, are as in Mexican\r\nexamples. This specimen probably denotes greater age than any other in\r\nthe series.\r\n\r\nAnother specimen (29,809, ♀, Mirador), perhaps very young, is rather\r\ndifferent from the others in the coloration of the lower parts; the\r\nrufous of the posterior portions is very deep, and the anterior light\r\nplaces are much tinged with ochraceous, the supraloral stripe being\r\ntinged throughout with the same; across the breast is a series of small\r\ntear-shaped spots of black, forming an imperfect band; there are,\r\nhowever, no other differences.\r\n\r\nNos. 29,520 (♀, Chile, Berlin Museum) and 29,521 (♂, Venezuela) differ\r\nfrom the rest only in a deeper tinge of ochraceous anteriorly beneath,\r\nthe occipital stripes being very red.\r\n\r\nNo. 18,497 (♂, from the Rio Pecos, Texas) is in the plumage described\r\nas that of the young male, having the rusty tinge on rump, and more\r\nnumerous bands on tail; the breast is almost as deeply ochraceous as the\r\ntibiæ, and the broad black patches of the sides scarcely meet across the\r\nabdomen, being there broken into streaks.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Falco femoralis._]\r\n\r\nA female, nearly adult, from Buenos Ayres (45,692, Conchitas; W. H.\r\nHudson), has the feathers of the upper parts faintly edged with white;\r\nthe rump and upper tail-coverts conspicuously barred with the same.\r\nThe head above is decidedly more bluish than in northern examples,\r\neach feather with a shaft-line of black. The tail has only seven white\r\nbars,—these, however, very sharply defined, and very pure white; the\r\nlongest primary has eleven white bars. The lower plumage is similar to\r\nthat of the immature male from the Rio Pecos, Texas (No. 18,497). This\r\nspecimen has the second and third quills equal.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF SPECIMENS EXAMINED.\r\n\r\nNational Museum, 14; Boston Society, 5; Philadelphia Academy, 2; New\r\nYork Museum, 1; G. N.

Only two specimens of this Hawk have been taken within the\r\nlimits of the United States. One was obtained by Dr. Heermann on the\r\nvast plains of New Mexico, near the United States boundary-line. It\r\nappeared to be flying over the prairies in search of small birds and\r\nmice, at times hovering in the manner of the common Sparrow Hawk\r\n(_Tinnunculus sparverius_). It appears to be resident throughout a large\r\npart of Mexico, and in Central and South America. The other is from the\r\nRio Pecos of Texas, collected by Dr. W. W. Anderson.\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin, in his Zoölogy of the Voyage of the Beagle, mentions\r\nobtaining one specimen in a small valley on the plains of Patagonia, at\r\nPort Desire, in latitude 47° 44′ south. M. D’Orbigny supposed latitude\r\n34° to be the extreme southern limit of the species. Lieutenant Gilliss\r\nbrought specimens from Chile.\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin states that the _F. femoralis_ nests in low bushes, this\r\ncorresponding with the observations of Mr. Bishop. He found the\r\nfemale sitting on her eggs in the beginning of January. According to\r\nM. D’Orbigny, it prefers a dry, open country with scattered bushes,\r\nwhich Mr. Darwin confirms. Mr. Bishop informs me that he met with this\r\nHawk in the greatest abundance upon those vast plains of South America\r\nknown as the Pampas, in which no trees except the ombû are found, and\r\nthat it there nests exclusively on the tops of low bushes, hardly\r\nmore than a foot or two from the ground. The bird was not at all shy,\r\nlike most Hawks, but was easily approached so nearly as to be readily\r\nrecognized.\r\n\r\nMr. Bridges states, in the Proceedings of the London Zoölogical Society\r\n(1843, p. 109), that the _H. femoralis_ is trained in some parts of\r\nSouth America for the pursuit of smaller gallinaceous birds, and that\r\nit is highly esteemed by the Chilian falconers. It very soon becomes\r\nquite docile, and will even follow its master within a few weeks of its\r\ncapture.\r\n\r\nI am indebted to Mr. N. H. Bishop for specimens of the eggs of this\r\nHawk obtained by him on the Pampas. The nest contained but two, and was\r\nbuilt on the top of a low bush or stunted tree, hardly two feet from the\r\nground. It was constructed, with some pains and elaboration, of withered\r\ngrasses and dry leaves.\r\n\r\nThe eggs measure, one 1.81 inches in length by 1.69 in breadth, the\r\nother 1.78 by 1.63. This does not materially vary from the measurement\r\ngiven by Darwin. The ground-color of the egg is white. This, however,\r\nis so thickly and so generally studded with fine brown markings, that\r\nthe white ground to the eye has a rusty appearance, and its real\r\nhue is hardly distinguishable. Over the entire surface of the egg\r\nis distributed an infinite number of fine dottings, of a color most\r\nnearly approaching a raw terra-sienna brown. Over this again are larger\r\nblotches, lines, and splashes of a handsome shade of vandyke-brown. In\r\none egg these larger markings are much more frequent than in the other.\r\nThe latter is chiefly marked with the finer rusty dottings, and has a\r\nmore dingy appearance.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBGENUS TINNUNCULUS, VIEILLOT.\r\n\r\n  _Tinnunculus_, VIEILL. 1807. (Type, _Falco tinnunculus_, LINN.\r\n  _Tinnunculus alaudarius_, GMEL.)\r\n  _? Tichornis_, KAUP, 1844. (Type, _Falco cenchris_, NAUM.)\r\n  _Pœcilornis_, KAUP, 1844. (Type, _Falco sparverius_, LINN.)\r\n\r\nThe characters of this subgenus have been sufficiently defined in the\r\ndiagnosis on page 1427, so that it will be necessary for me only to add\r\na few less important ones.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  =53198=, ♀.\r\n  =53198=, ♀. ½\r\n  =53198=, ♀.\r\n  =53198=, ♀. ½\r\n\r\n_Tinnunculus sparverius._]\r\n\r\nThe subgenus _Tinnunculus_ is one which is well characterized by\r\npeculiarities of manners and habits as well as by features of structure.\r\nThe species are the most arboreal of the Falcons, and their curious\r\nhabit of poising in a fixed position as they hover over some object of\r\nfood which they are watching is probably peculiar to them, and has been\r\nremarked of the Old World as well as of the American species. In their\r\nstructure they are the most aberrant members of the subfamily belonging\r\nto the Northern Hemisphere and in their weak bill and feet, lengthened\r\ntarsi, obtusely tipped quills, more rounded wings, and more lengthened\r\ntail, exhibit a decided step toward _Hieracidea_, an Australian genus\r\nwhich is almost exactly intermediate in all the characters of its\r\nexternal structure between the true Falcons and the South American genus\r\n_Milvago_, of the Polyborine group.\r\n\r\nThe subgenus is most largely developed in the Old World, where are found\r\nabout a dozen nominal species, of which perhaps one half must be reduced\r\nto the rank of geographical races. America possesses three species,\r\ntwo of which are restricted to the West India islands, while the other\r\nextends over the entire continent.\r\n\r\nThere is no reason whatever for separating the American species from\r\nthose of the Old World, and the subgenus _Pœcilornis_, established upon\r\nthese by Kaup, is not tenable.\r\n\r\nSince the publication of my first paper upon the American forms of\r\n_Tinnunculus_,[59] a large amount of additional material has fallen\r\nunder my observation; the total number of examples critically examined\r\nand compared together amounting to over three hundred and fifty skins of\r\nwhich I have kept a record, besides many others which have come casually\r\nto my notice. This abundant material merely confirms the views I first\r\nexpressed, in the paper alluded to, regarding the number and definition\r\nof the forms; their comparative relation to each other being the only\r\nrespect in which I have reason to modify my arrangement.\r\n\r\nIn my first paper on the American _Tinnunculi_, three distinct\r\nspecies were recognized; one (_sparverius_) belonging to the whole\r\nof Continental America and the Lesser Antilles, one (_leucophrys_,\r\nRidgway) to Cuba and Hayti, and one (_sparveroides_, Vig.) peculiar\r\nto Cuba. The first is one modified in different climatic regions into\r\nseveral geographical races, as follows: Var. _sparverius_, L., North\r\nand Middle America, exclusive of the gulf and Caribbean coast region;\r\nvar. _isabellinus_, Swains., the eastern coast region of Tropical\r\nAmerica, from Guiana to Florida; var. _dominicensis_, Gmel. (Lesser\r\nAntilles); var. _australis_, Ridgw. (South America in general); and\r\nvar. _cinnamominus_, Swains. (Chile and Western Brazil). That each of\r\nthese races is well characterized, the evidence of a series abundantly\r\nsufficient to determine this point enables me to assert without reserve;\r\nfor I find in each instance that the characters diagnosed in my synopsis\r\nhold good as well with a large series as with a few specimens.\r\n\r\nThe following synopsis, essentially the same as that before published,\r\nmay, to most persons, explain satisfactorily my reasons for recognizing\r\nso many races of _T. sparverius_,—a proceeding which, I am sorry to\r\nsay, does not meet with favor with all ornithologists.[60] Though\r\nthere are at the present time three well-characterized or permanently\r\ndifferentiated species of _Tinnunculus_ on the American continent,\r\nyet it is, to my mind, certain that these have all descended from a\r\ncommon ancestral stock, for evidence in proof of this is found in many\r\nspecimens which I consider at least strongly “suggestive” of this fact;\r\nsome specimens of var. _isabellinus_ from Florida having blue feathers\r\ninterspersed over the rump, thereby showing an approximation toward the\r\nuniformly blue upper surface of the adult male of _T. sparveroides_ of\r\nthe neighboring island of Cuba; while in the latter bird the embryonic\r\nplumage of the male is very similar to the permanent condition of the\r\nmale of _sparverius_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSynopsis of the American Species.\r\n\r\n  =A.= Back always entirely rufous (with or without black bars.) Lower\r\n  parts white, or only tinged with ochraceous; front and auriculars\r\n  distinctly whitish.\r\n\r\n    _a._ Inner webs of primaries barred entirely across, with white and\r\n    dusky; “mustache” across the cheeks conspicuous; no conspicuous\r\n    superciliary stripe of white.\r\n\r\n      1. =T. sparverius.=[61] Crown bluish, with or without a patch\r\n      of rufous. ♂. Wings and upper part of head slaty, or ashy-blue;\r\n      scapulars, back, rump, and tail reddish-rufous; primaries, basal\r\n      half of the secondaries, and a broad subterminal zone across the\r\n      tail, black. ♀. The bluish, except that of the head, replaced by\r\n      rufous, which is everywhere barred with blackish, and of a less\r\n      reddish cast. _Hab._ Entire continent of America, also Lesser\r\n      Antilles, north to St. Thomas.\r\n\r\n    _b._ Inner webs of primaries white, merely serrated along the\r\n    shaft with dusky; “mustache” obsolete or wanting; a conspicuous\r\n    superciliary stripe of white.\r\n\r\n      2. =T. leucophrys.=[62] Similar to _sparverius_, except as\r\n      characterized above. _Hab._ Cuba and Hayti.\r\n\r\n  =B.= Back rufous only in the ♀. Lower parts deep ferruginous-rufous;\r\n  front and auriculars dusky.\r\n\r\n      3. =T. sparveroides.=[63] ♂. Above, except the tail, entirely dark\r\n      plumbeous, with a blackish nuchal collar; primaries and edges\r\n      and subterminal portion of tail-feathers, black. Beneath deep\r\n      rufous (like the back of _sparverius_ and _leucophrys_), with a\r\n      wash of plumbeous across the jugulum; throat grayish-white. Inner\r\n      webs of primaries slaty, with transverse cloudings of darker. ♀.\r\n      Differing from that of the above species in dark rufous lower\r\n      parts and dusky, mottled inner webs of primaries. Second and third\r\n      quills longest; first shorter than or equal to fourth. _Hab._ Cuba\r\n      (only?).\r\n\r\nThe distinguishing characters of _F. sparverius_ having been given in\r\nthe foregoing synopsis, I will here consider this species in regard\r\nto the modifications it experiences in the different regions of its\r\ngeographical distribution.\r\n\r\nThe whole of continental America, from the Arctic regions to almost the\r\nextreme of South America, and from ocean to ocean, is inhabited, so far\r\nas known, by but this one species of _Tinnunculus_. But in different\r\nportions of this vast extent of territory the species experiences\r\nmodifications under the influence of certain climatic and other local\r\nconditions, which are here characterized as geographical races; these,\r\nlet me say, present their distinctive characteristics with great\r\nuniformity and constancy, although the differences from the typical\r\nor restricted _sparverius_ are not very great. The _F. sparverius_ as\r\nrestricted, or what is more properly termed var. _sparverius_, inhabits\r\nthe whole of North and Middle America (both coasts included, except\r\nthose of the Gulf of Mexico and Caribbean Sea), south to the Isthmus of\r\nPanama. Throughout this whole region it is everywhere nearly the same\r\nbird. This variety appears to represent the species in its greatest\r\npurity, being a sort of central form from which the others radiate.\r\nThe most typical examples of the var. _sparverius_ are the specimens\r\nin the large series from the elevated regions or plateau of Mexico and\r\nGuatemala. In these the rufous of the crown is most extended (in none is\r\nit at all restricted), and the ashy portions are of the finest or bluest\r\nand lightest tint.\r\n\r\nAll specimens, of quite a large series, from the peninsula of Lower\r\nCalifornia, are considerably smaller than any others, the smallest\r\n(1,693 ♂ ad. San José; J. Xantus) measuring, wing, 6.50; tail, 4.20,\r\nand tarsus, 1.30; the dwarfed size of these, however, is their only\r\ndistinguishing feature. Two specimens (50,199, ♂, Cape Florida, and\r\n10,345, ♀, Indian Key) from Florida differ from others in the unusual\r\ndevelopment of the bill, which toward the end is more suddenly curved,\r\nand the point considerably lengthened; these specimens have, also, only\r\na tinge of rufous on the crown, thus showing a proximity to the var.\r\n_isabellinus_. The large bill, however, is no more than would be looked\r\nfor in specimens from that region.\r\n\r\nAlong the Gulf border of the United States, and the Caribbean and North\r\nAtlantic coasts of South America (probably the whole Atlantic coast of\r\ntropical and subtropical America), the true _sparverius_ is changed into\r\nwhat Swainson has called “_Falco isabellinus_,” which differs from the\r\nformer only in having the cinereous of the crown and wings considerably\r\ndarker (as well as less bluish), approaching plumbeous; the rufous of\r\nthe crown is totally absent, or only present in faint touches; the lower\r\nparts are of a deeper ochraceous, and the black spots on the breast and\r\nsides sparse.\r\n\r\nAllied to the last in tints of coloration, and apparently a direct\r\noffshoot from it, is the _dominicensis_ of Gmelin (based upon\r\ndescription by Brisson), which inhabits the Lesser Antilles, from\r\nTrinidad northward to Porto Rico. Although I consider this (var.\r\n_dominicensis_) as a modified form of the var. _isabellinus_, yet it is\r\nthe one of all the varieties referrible to _sparverius_ which deviates\r\nmost widely from the typical or original style. The characters of this\r\nare, tints those of var. _isabellinus_, but, in addition, the tail has\r\nnumerous more or less complete black bands, while those of the back and\r\nscapulars are very broad and numerous; also, the crown has a decided\r\nrufous patch; the bill, too, is larger than in any other American member\r\nof the genus. A style of considerable uniformity spreads over the whole\r\nof South America, including both coasts, from Bogota to the Parana,\r\nexcepting the northeastern coast region, before mentioned as inhabited\r\nby the var. _isabellinus_. It differs from all the other styles, except\r\nthe _cinnamominus_ of Chile, in having the lower parts continuously dull\r\nwhite, any ochraceous tinge being scarcely perceptible; there is seldom\r\na trace of rufous on the crown, which has the light bluish tint seen\r\nin var. _sparverius_, and the black zone of the tail is scarcely more\r\nthan half as wide as in the northern races. In size, also, it somewhat\r\nexceeds the others. Swainson named this “_Falco gracilis_”; but the _F._\r\n(_Tinnunculus_) _gracilis_ of Lesson being a different species, and the\r\nname as applied to it of prior date, I have bestowed upon the present\r\nbird the name var. _australis_.\r\n\r\nIn Chile and Brazil (Western ?) we find a form resembling the last in\r\nsome respects, but differing in points of almost specific value. It\r\ndiffers from all the other American members of the genus in having\r\nthe tail continuously rufous to the extreme tip, the black zone being\r\nconsiderably narrower than the terminal rufous, the lateral tail-feather\r\nimmaculate rufous, etc. The grayish of the head is much darker and more\r\nslaty than in the var. _australis_. This is, without doubt, the _Falco\r\ncinnamominus_ of Swainson, the specimens in the collection corresponding\r\nexactly with the description by that author.\r\n\r\nThe rufous patch on the crown must not be too much considered, as it\r\nis of all characters perhaps the most treacherous, though its presence\r\nor absence is in a measure characteristic of the several varieties.\r\nNeither does the exact number of spots on the lateral tail-feather\r\nprove sufficiently constant to serve as a character in which the least\r\nreliance can be placed, though Swainson attaches considerable value to\r\nit. I have found that, besides varying almost with the individual, in\r\nsome specimens the feathers of opposite sides did not correspond.\r\n\r\nAbout two hundred and fifty specimens form the basis of the following\r\nsynopsis.\r\n\r\n  =A.= Tail tipped with white; outer tail-feathers (one or more)\r\n  variegated.\r\n\r\n    _a._ ♂. Head above, and wings, fine bluish-ash; usually one\r\n    tail-feather only (the outer) variegated.\r\n\r\n      1. Vertex with a conspicuous patch of rufous. ♂. Black zone of the\r\n      tail 1.00 in width; breast strongly tinged with ochraceous; spots\r\n      of black on the breast or sides circular. ♀. Above fulvous-rufous,\r\n      the whole breast and sides with longitudinal dashes of a lighter\r\n      tint of the same. _Hab._ Continent of North America north of\r\n      Panama (except Caribbean and Gulf coast) …\r\n\r\n                                                      var. _sparverius_.\r\n\r\n      2. Vertex with only a trace of rufous, or none at all. ♂. Black\r\n      zone of tail only .60 in width; breast nearly pure white;\r\n      spots of black usually only on the sides, elliptical. ♀. Above\r\n      vinaceous-rufous; longitudinal markings beneath deeper brown.\r\n      _Hab._ Continent of South America (except North Atlantic and\r\n      Caribbean coast) …\r\n\r\n                                                   var. _australis_.[64]\r\n\r\n    _b._ ♂. Head above, and wings, dark bluish-plumbeous; several outer\r\n    tail-feathers variegated.\r\n\r\n      3. Vertex without any rufous. ♂. Anterior portions beneath deep\r\n      ochraceous, without spots. Tail without indication of bars\r\n      anterior to the subterminal one; black bars above confined to\r\n      larger scapulars. ♀. Above ferruginous, with the black bars\r\n      broader and blacker than in either of the preceding. _Hab._ Gulf,\r\n      Caribbean, and Atlantic coasts of tropical continental America\r\n      (Florida to Cayenne) …\r\n\r\n                                                     var. _isabellinus_.\r\n\r\n      4. Vertex with a patch of rufous. ♂. Black spots beneath numerous,\r\n      large and circular. Tail with more or less complete black bars\r\n      anterior to the subterminal band, sometimes regularly barred\r\n      to the base; black bars above covering entire rufous surface.\r\n      ♀. Similar to that of _isabellinus_, but markings beneath more\r\n      numerous, and pure black instead of brown. _Hab._ Lesser Antilles,\r\n      north to St. Thomas …\r\n\r\n                                                var. _dominicensis_.[65]\r\n\r\n  =B.= Tail tipped with deep rufous; outer tail-feather unvariegated.\r\n\r\n      5. Head above dark slaty-plumbeous, without any rufous. ♂. Tail\r\n      continuous rufous to the extreme tip, the subterminal black\r\n      band narrower than the terminal rufous one, and not continuous;\r\n      the outer feather entirely rufous, without any black. In other\r\n      respects much like var. _australis_. (♀ not seen.) _Hab._ Chile\r\n      and Western Brazil …\r\n\r\n                                                var. _cinnamominus_.[66]\r\n\r\n\r\nFalco (Tinnunculus) sparverius, LINN.\r\n\r\nVar. =sparverius=, LINNÆUS.\r\n\r\nAMERICAN SPARROW HAWK; AMERICAN KESTREL.\r\n\r\n  _Accipiter_ (_Æsalon_) _carolinensis_, BRISS.

Wallace).\r\nForehead, lateral and posterior, regions of the vertex, occiput, and\r\nwings, bluish-ash. Vertex, nape, scapulars, interscapulars, rump, upper\r\ntail-coverts, and tail, fine cinnamon-rufous; scapulars and back barred\r\nwith black, the bars broadest and most conspicuous posteriorly. Tail\r\ntipped with white, and with a broad sharply defined subterminal zone\r\nof black, about one inch in width; lateral feather, with outer web and\r\nterminal half of inner, ashy-white, the latter with one or two distinct\r\ntransverse spots anterior to the subterminal one. Wing-coverts with more\r\nor less conspicuous cordate spots of black, rather sparsely distributed;\r\nbasal two-thirds of secondaries and whole of primaries deep black; the\r\nlatter whitish around the terminal margin and with nine transverse bands\r\nof white on inner web of longest (second), the white rather exceeding\r\nthe black, the points of which do not reach the edge of the feather;\r\nlining of the wing white with conspicuous cordate spots of black. Front\r\nand superciliary region more hoary than the forehead, almost approaching\r\nwhite. Whole lateral region of the head, with chin, throat, and lower\r\nparts, white; the neck, breast, and sides, however, with a deep tinge\r\nof ochraceous, the tint hardly approaching the depth of color seen on\r\nthe nape. On the head there are (considering both sides) seven black\r\nspots; the first originating in front of the bare anteorbital space\r\n(leaving the lores white), and extending in a stripe downward across the\r\nmaxillæ, forming a conspicuous “mustache”; the second crosses the tips\r\nof the ear-coverts, in form of an oblong transverse spot; the third is\r\nsmaller, situated as far behind the last as this, and is posterior to\r\nthe “mustache,” crossing the side of the neck; the last is an odd nuchal\r\nspot separating the ash of the occiput from the rufous of the nape.\r\nBreast and sides with circular or cordate spots of pure black; these\r\nvarying in size, but generally larger on the sides. Other lower parts\r\nimmaculate. Wing-formula, 2=3–4, 1. Wing, 7.10; tail, 4.50; tarsus,\r\n1.32; middle toe, .98; culmen, .45.\r\n\r\n_Adult female_ (10,751, Fort Bridger, Utah; C. Drexler). Blue above\r\nconfined to the head, which shows the rufous patch as in the male;\r\nentire upper parts rufous, lighter and less purplish than in the male,\r\neverywhere barred with black. Tail with twelve sharply defined narrow\r\nbars of black; the subterminal broadest, and about three eighths of an\r\ninch in width. Longest primary with eleven transverse spaces of pale\r\nrufous, nearly twice as wide as the dusky ones, which scarcely touch the\r\nedge. Beneath yellowish-white, paler than in the male, breast and sides\r\nwith rusty longitudinal spots. Head as in the male. Wing, 7.60; tail,\r\n5.20; tarsus, 1.50; middle toe, .90; bill, .50. Wing-formula, 2=3–4–1.\r\n\r\n_Young male_ (5,581, Medicine Bow Creek, Nebraska, August 7, 1856;\r\nW. S. Wood). Exactly like the adult male, but with the rufous darker,\r\napproaching to chestnut; spots beneath inclining to a tear-shaped form,\r\nand, though more numerous, are not so well defined as in the adult; also\r\nrufescent tinge beneath more general; blue of the wings with scarcely\r\nany spots; white terminal band of tail tinged with rufous. Sometimes the\r\ntwo or three outer feathers are clouded with ash, and possess indication\r\nof bars, formed of irregular black spots.\r\n\r\n_Young female_ (40,520, Fort Rice, Dacota; S. M. Rothhammer). Generally\r\nlike the adult, but with rufous above darker, approaching ferruginous;\r\nthe bars everywhere broader, and purer black; rufous vertical patch\r\nstreaked centrally with black; spots beneath larger, darker, approaching\r\nreddish umber.\r\n\r\nHAB. Continental North America (only), across to both coasts, and from\r\nArctic regions to Isthmus of Panama; not in West Indies.\r\n\r\nThis form ranges over the whole of continental North America, from\r\nPanama northward into the British Provinces, and from the Atlantic\r\nto the Pacific. Throughout the whole of this extensive area the\r\nbird exhibits very little variation, in fact, none not of an almost\r\nindividual character, consisting mainly in the varying amount of\r\nashy-white and black on the lateral tail-feather, and also, to a\r\nless extent, in the depth of the ochraceous tint on the breast, and\r\nthe abundance and size of the black spots on the sides or flanks. In\r\nthe Gulf region of the United States it passes gradually into var.\r\n_isabellinus_ through intermediate specimens. We have seen Florida skins\r\n(kindly lent to us by Mr. J. A. Allen) from Miami (♂, January 29, 1872),\r\nCedar Keys (♂, February 28, 1871), and Florida Keys (♂, February 14,\r\n1871). Of these, only the first (No. 14,491) deviates noticeably from\r\nthe typical style; it inclines toward var. _isabellinus_ in sparsity\r\nof black spots on flanks and restricted rufous on the crown, but in\r\nthe pure light ash of the crown and wings, and faint ochraceous of the\r\nbreast, it resembles more the var. _sparverius_. Wing, 6.50; tail, 4.70.\r\nThe two other specimens measure as follows: No. 14,487, Florida Keys,\r\nwing, 6.90; tail, 5.00. No. 14,492, Cedar Keys, wing, 6.90; tail, 5.00.\r\nThe former is peculiar in having some of the upper tail-coverts either\r\npartly or entirely ashy.\r\n\r\nMexican specimens represent the race in the greatest purity or\r\nexaggeration of its characteristic features, in pure and light\r\nbluish-ash of wings and crown, greatest extent of rufous on crown, etc.\r\nCalifornia specimens often exhibit what I have not noticed in eastern\r\nexamples, though possibly occurring in them; that is, in adult males the\r\ncere and feet are of a deep orange-red—almost vermilion color.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF SPECIMENS EXAMINED.\r\n\r\nNational Museum, 104; Boston Society, 26; Philadelphia Academy, 7; Mus.\r\nComp.

Much like var. _sparverius_, but considerably darker in\r\ncolors; plumbeous, crown dark with no rufous on vertex, nor darker\r\nshaft-lines. Rufous above more purplish-castaneous; cinereous of wings\r\nmuch darker; neck, jugulum, breast, and sides deep soft ochraceous,\r\nspots very few, and restricted to the sides. Wing, 7.00; tail, 4.70;\r\ntarsus, 1.25; middle toe, .90; culmen, .50. Wing-formula, 2, 3–4, 1.\r\n\r\n_Adult female_ (58,339, Jacksonville, Fla., June 10, 1869; C. J.\r\nMaynard). Differing from the female of var. _sparverius_ in much darker\r\ncolors, the rufous inclining to castaneous; bars broader, more sharply\r\ndefined, pure black. Head above pure dark plumbeous, conspicuously\r\ndifferent from the fine light ash of var. _sparverius_; vertex with\r\ntouches only of rufous; markings beneath narrower, and nearly pure\r\nblack, upon a deeper ochraceous ground. Wing, 7.20; tail, 4.50; tarsus,\r\n1.20; middle toe, .83; culmen, .42. Primaries, 2, 3–1, 4.\r\n\r\nHAB. North Atlantic and Caribbean coasts of South America, from Demerara\r\nnorthward, along the Gulf coast of Mexico and United States, through\r\nTexas and Louisiana to Florida.\r\n\r\nThis form, though quite different in its extreme condition from true\r\n_sparverius_, gradually grades into it. Few, if any, other specimens\r\npossess in so exaggerated a degree all the distinctive characters of\r\nthose described, though all from the regions indicated agree in having\r\ndarker colors and less rufous on the crown than specimens from the\r\ninterior of North and Middle America.\r\n\r\nA series of six adult male Sparrow Hawks from Florida, kindly loaned me\r\nfor examination by Mr. J. A. Allen, includes three typical examples of\r\nthis littoral race of subtropical continental America. They all agree\r\nin very deep dark colors, entire absence or merely slight indication of\r\nrufous on the vertex, and deeply ochraceous breast, with few markings.\r\nNo. 14,499 (Miami, Fla., June 19, 1871) is remarkable for lacking\r\nentirely the black spots on wings and flanks, and bars on the back\r\nor longer scapulars; the three outer tail-feathers are almost wholly\r\nashy-white, with about five transverse spots of black; the terminal\r\nwhite band is strongly tinged with ash; there is no trace of rufous on\r\nthe crown. Wing, 6.80; tail, 4.80.\r\n\r\nIn the unspotted wings and sides and unbarred scapulars there is a\r\nresemblance in this specimen to _F. leucophrys_; which, however, has the\r\nash very much lighter, the black “mustache” obsolete or wanting, the\r\nlower breast pure white instead of deep ochraceous; the under surface\r\nof the primaries plain white, with shallow dusky serrations along the\r\nshaft, instead of being heavily barred with dusky; always has a patch\r\nof rufous on the crown, a conspicuous frontal and superciliary stripe\r\nof white, and an entirely differently marked tail. In its much barred\r\ntail it also resembles the var. _dominicensis_ to a slight extent; but\r\nthe latter has the middle feathers also barred, and always has the\r\nscapulars, generally the entire dorsal region, heavily barred with\r\nblack, and the wings, breast, and sides heavily spotted; the bill is\r\nlarger, and there is always more or less rufous on the crown. The other\r\ntwo specimens are more like the average; they both have a mere trace\r\nof rufous on the crown, conspicuous bars on the scapulars, and spots\r\non the wings. No. 5,188 (Hibernia, Fla., February 3, 1869) has only a\r\nfew black specks on the flanks; the outer tail-feather ashy-white, with\r\nseven transverse black spots across inner web. Wing, 6.80; tail, 4.80.\r\nNo. 5,373 (Hawkinsville, Fla., March 12, 1869) is similar, but has the\r\nflanks distinctly spotted with black, and the outer tail-feather with\r\ninner web plain pale rufous, with only the subterminal large black spot.\r\nWing, 6.80; tail, 4.80.\r\n\r\nA series of ten specimens (five males and five females) from Florida,\r\nkindly sent me for examination by Mr. C. J. Maynard, contains nothing\r\nbut var. _sparverius_, with a few individuals inclining slightly toward\r\nvar. _isabellinus_. The extreme are measurements of the series as\r\nfollows: ♂. Wing, 6.60–6.90; tail, 4.50–4.70. ♀. Wing, 6.90–7.50;\r\ntail, 4.80–5.10. Four out of the five males have the deeply ochraceous\r\nunspotted breast of var. _isabellinus_, but all have more or less\r\nrufous on the crown, while the ash is of that light shade seen in var.\r\n_sparverius_. No. 476 has the upper tail-coverts mixed with feathers\r\nwhich are either wholly or partially ash, while the light bands of the\r\nouter tail-feathers are much tinged with the same; the scapulars are\r\nalmost wholly fine ash, like the wings, and with heavy black bars. The\r\nfemales likewise all incline toward var. _isabellinus_, all having the\r\ndark bars above equal to or broader than the rufous ones. No. 6,441\r\nis transversely spotted on the flanks with heavy black bars, and is\r\nscarcely distinguishable from females of var. _dominicensis_.\r\n\r\nAn adult male labelled as coming from Cuba, but probably from the\r\nsoutheastern United States, in the collection of the Boston Society,\r\nis so deeply colored as to strongly resemble the young male of _T.\r\nsparveroides_. There is not a trace of rufous on the crown, which\r\nis dark plumbeous; the lower parts are entirely deep rufous, except\r\nthe throat, inclining more to ochraceous on the tibiæ and crissum;\r\nthe whole lower surface entirely free from spots of any kind. The\r\ntail is very uniformly marked, being wholly rufous, except the usual\r\nnarrow terminal band, or the outer web of lateral feathers, which\r\nare white,—the latter with a few indications of black spots near the\r\nshaft,—and the usual subterminal zone of black, which is very regular\r\nand continuous. Though in these respects so closely resembling the\r\nyoung ♂ of _T. sparveroides_, it may be distinguished from it by the\r\nsharp definition of the black markings on the side of the head and\r\non the wing-coverts, and of the black bars on the inner webs of the\r\nprimaries. We have every reason to doubt whether this specimen was\r\nactually collected in Cuba, since so many of the specimens in the\r\nLafresnaye Collection are incorrectly labelled as regards locality.\r\n\r\nA young ♂ from Georgia, in the same collection, is somewhat similar, but\r\ndiffers in the following respects. The rufous beneath is confined to the\r\nbreast, sides, and abdomen, but is as deep (i.e. only a shade or two\r\nlighter than that on the back); the two outer pairs of tail-feathers are\r\nmostly ashy-white, with large spots of black.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF SPECIMENS EXAMINED.\r\n\r\nNational Museum, 4; Boston Society, 2; Mus.

The common Sparrow Hawk of America has an extended distribution\r\nthroughout the greater portion of North America, although it was not\r\nobserved by Mr. MacFarlane, nor by any other collectors in the higher\r\nArctic regions, nor was it met with by Mr. Dall in Alaska. Mr. Kennicott\r\nfound it nesting at Fort Resolution (lat. 62°), on Great Slave Lake, and\r\nMr. Clark at Fort Rae. These are the highest points to which we have any\r\nknowledge of its having been traced.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Tinnunculus sparverius._]\r\n\r\nSir John Richardson speaks of it as abundant on the banks of the\r\nSaskatchewan, in the neighborhood of Carlton House. It probably breeds\r\nthroughout North America, from Hudson’s Bay to Mexico, and from Maine\r\nto California, though it is rare in a large portion of the New England\r\nStates. It is, however, quite abundant in the vicinity of Calais,\r\nMe., in New Brunswick, and in Nova Scotia, though less abundant about\r\nHalifax. It has not been taken, or if so only very rarely, in Eastern\r\nMassachusetts, though it has been known to breed in Williamstown and\r\nAmherst, in the western part of the State. It is equally rare in Rhode\r\nIsland and in Connecticut. Dr. Woods, of East Hartford, knew of a pair\r\nwhich entered a dove-cot in that place, destroyed its inmates, and\r\nlaid four eggs. They committed so many depredations on the neighbors’\r\nchickens that they were shot.\r\n\r\nMr. Ridgway found this species exceedingly abundant in all portions of\r\nthe West. In the cañons of the East Humboldt Mountains it was observed\r\nto have nests in holes on the faces of the limestone cliffs.\r\n\r\nThe Sparrow Hawk is a bird of irregular flight, now momentarily hovering\r\nover a particular spot, suspending itself in the air, and then shooting\r\noff in another direction. At other times it may be seen perched on\r\nthe top of a dead tree, or on a projecting branch, sitting there in\r\nan almost perpendicular position for an hour or more at a time. It\r\nfrequently jerks its tail, and appears to be reconnoitring the ground\r\nbelow for small birds, mice, or lizards, on which it chiefly preys. When\r\nit alights, it closes its long wings so suddenly that, according to\r\nWilson, they seem to disappear. It often approaches the farm-house early\r\nin the morning, skulking about the barnyard in pursuit of mice, and\r\noccasionally of young chickens. Frequently it plunges into a thicket,\r\nas if at random, but always with an object in view, and with a sure and\r\nfatal aim.\r\n\r\nWilson once observed one of this species perched on the highest top of\r\na large poplar, and, just as he was about to take aim, it swept down\r\nwith the rapidity of an arrow into a thicket of briers, where he shot\r\nit, and found a small Field Sparrow quivering in its grasp. It is said\r\nto be fond of watching along hedge-rows and in orchards, where small\r\nbirds usually resort. When grasshoppers are plentiful, they form the\r\nprincipal part of its food. The young are fed with the usual food of the\r\nparents,—mice, small birds, grasshoppers, etc. It also feeds upon small\r\nsnakes, but rarely, if ever, touches anything that it has not itself\r\nkilled, and has been known to reject its prey when, after having been\r\nkilled, it proved to be in unsuitable condition for food.\r\n\r\nMr. Audubon states that the flight of this species is never protracted.\r\nIt seldom flies far at a time; a few hundred yards are all the distance\r\nit usually goes before alighting. It rarely sails long on the wing at\r\na time; a half-hour is its utmost extent. In pursuing a bird, it flies\r\nwith great rapidity, but never with the speed of the Sharp-shinned and\r\nother Hawks. Its cry is so similar to that of the Kestrel of Europe that\r\nit might be readily mistaken for it but for its stronger intonation. At\r\ntimes it gives out these notes as it perches, but they are principally\r\nuttered while on the wing. Mr. Audubon has heard them imitate the\r\nfeeble cries of their offspring, when these have left the nest and are\r\nfollowing their parents.\r\n\r\nThe young birds, when they first appear, are covered with a white down.\r\nThey grow with great rapidity, and are soon able to leave their nest,\r\nand are well provided for by their parents until they are able to take\r\ncare of themselves. They feed at first on grasshoppers and crickets.\r\n\r\nAt Denysville, Me., these Hawks were observed to attack the Cliff\r\nSwallows, while sitting on their eggs, deliberately tearing open their\r\ncovered nests, and seizing their occupants for their prey.\r\n\r\nIn winter, these birds, for the most part, desert the Northern and\r\nMiddle States, but are resident south of Virginia. They can be readily\r\ntamed, especially when reared from the nest. Mr Audubon raised a young\r\nHawk of this species, which continued to keep about the house, and\r\neven to fly to it for shelter when attacked by some of its wilder\r\nkindred, and never failed to return at night to roost on its favorite\r\nwindow-shutter. It was finally killed by an enraged hen, whose chickens\r\nit attempted to seize.\r\n\r\nThis Hawk constructs no nest, but makes use of hollow trees, the\r\ndeserted hole of a Woodpecker, or even an old Crow’s nest. Its eggs\r\nare usually as many as five in number, and Mr. Audubon once even met\r\nwith seven in a single nest. The ground of the eggs is usually a dark\r\ncream-color or a light buff. In their markings they vary considerably.\r\nFive from a nest in Maryland were covered throughout the entire surface\r\nwith small blotches and dottings of a light brown, at times confluent,\r\nand, except in a single instance, not more frequent at the larger end\r\nthan the smaller. The contents of a nest obtained by Mr. Audubon on the\r\nYellowstone River had a ground-color of a light buff, nearly unspotted,\r\nexcept at the larger end, with only a few large blotches and splashes of\r\na deep chocolate. In others, interspersed with the light-brown markings\r\nare a few of a much deeper shade. In some, the eggs are covered with\r\nfine markings of buff, nearly uniform in size and color; and others\r\nagain are marked with lines and bolder dashes of brown, of a distinctly\r\nreddish shade, over their entire surface, and often so thickly as nearly\r\nto conceal the ground. The eggs are nearly spherical. The average length\r\nis 1.38 inches by a breadth of 1.13. They are subject to variation in\r\nsize, but are uniform as to shape. They range in length from 1.48 to\r\n1.32 inches, and in breadth from 1.08 to 1.20 inches.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of _Tinnunculus sparveroides_, from Cuba, and of var.\r\n_cinnamominus_ from Chile, differ in size and markings from those of\r\nNorth American birds. Their ground-color is much whiter, is freer\r\nfrom markings which have hardly any tinge of rufous, but are more of\r\na yellowish-brown. The Cuban egg measures 1.28 by 1.08 inches; the\r\nChilian, 1.25 by 1.08.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS POLYBORUS, VIEILLOT.\r\n\r\n  _Polyborus_, VIEILL. 1816.

The Caracara Eagle, as this bird is called, though it seems to\r\npossess, to a large degree, the characteristics of a Vulture, and hardly\r\nany of the true aquiline nature, is found in all the extreme southern\r\nportions of the country, in Florida, Texas, Southern Arizona, and\r\nCalifornia. Audubon met with it abundantly in Florida in the winter of\r\n1831. Mr. Boardman has seen it quite common at Enterprise, associating\r\nwith the Vultures. Dr. Woodhouse, while encamped on the Rio Saltado,\r\nnear San Antonio, in Texas, frequently saw the Caracaras, and always\r\nin company with the Vultures, which he says they greatly resemble in\r\ntheir habits, excepting that they were much more shy. He could, however,\r\nreadily approach them when on horseback. Mr. Dresser also frequently\r\nencountered it in Texas in the vicinity of San Antonio, and speaks of\r\nit as abundant from the Rio Grande to the Guadaloupe, but never noticed\r\nany farther east. In Arizona, Dr. Coues says, it is not a rare bird in\r\nthe southern and western portions of that Territory. Lieutenant Couch\r\nlikewise describes them as exceedingly abundant from the Rio Grande\r\nto the Sierra Madre. He speaks of killing a male bird on the nest,\r\nwhich was in a low tree and composed of sticks. He adds that this bird\r\ndestroys the Texas field-rats (_Sigmodon berlandieri_) in large numbers.\r\n\r\nDr. Heermann met with this species on the Colorado River, near Fort\r\nYuma, in company with the _Cathartes aura_. He found it so shy that it\r\nwas impossible to procure a specimen. He found it along the Gila River,\r\nand again met with it in Texas wherever there were settlements. At San\r\nAntonio, wherever there were slaughter-houses, he met with them in great\r\nnumbers, twenty or thirty being often seen at a time.\r\n\r\nGrayson gives the _Caracara_ as quite abundant in the Tres Marias.\r\nAlthough it subsists mainly on dead animals and other offal, it is said\r\nto sometimes capture young birds, lizards, snakes, and land-crabs. It\r\ngenerally carries its prey in its beak; but Colonel Grayson states\r\nthat he has seen it also bear off its food in its claws, as Hawks do.\r\nIt walks with facility on the ground, and was often met with in the\r\nthick woods, walking about in search of snakes. Mr. Xantus found it\r\nnesting at Cape San Lucas, placing its nest on the top of the _Cereus\r\ngiganteus_. It occurs also in the West Indies, especially in the island\r\nof Cuba, where it is known to breed. Eggs were obtained and identified\r\nby the late Dr. Berlandier, of Matamoras, in Northern Mexico, on the Rio\r\nGrande, in considerable numbers.\r\n\r\nMr. Salvin (Ibis, I, 214) says the _Caracara_ is universal in its\r\ndistribution in Central America, appearing equally abundant everywhere.\r\nAt Duenas it was a constant resident, breeding on the surrounding\r\nhills. Its food seemed to consist largely of the ticks that infested\r\nthe animals. In Honduras Mr. G. C. Taylor found them very common, quite\r\ntame, and easily shot. They feed on carrion and offal, were often seen\r\nscratching among the half-dry cow-dung, and are “a very low caste bird.”\r\nMr. E. C. Taylor (Ibis, VI, 79) frequently saw this bird on the shores\r\nof the Orinoco. It was very tame, and generally allowed a near approach,\r\nand when disturbed did not fly far. He did not meet with it in Trinidad.\r\n\r\nOn the Rio Grande the popular name of this species is _Totache_, while\r\nin Chile the _P. tharus_ is called _Traro_, but its more common name\r\nthroughout South America is _Carrancha_.\r\n\r\nAccording to Audubon, the flight of this bird is at great heights,\r\nis more graceful than that of the Vulture, and consists of alternate\r\nflapping and sailing. It often sails in large circles, gliding in a very\r\nelegant manner, now and then diving downwards and then rising again.\r\n\r\nThese birds feed on frogs, insects, worms, young alligators, carrion,\r\nand various other forms of animal food. Mr. Audubon states that he has\r\nseen them walk about in the water in search of food, catching frogs,\r\nyoung alligators, etc. It is harmless and inoffensive, and in the\r\ndestruction of vermin renders valuable services. It builds a coarse,\r\nflat nest, composed of flags, reeds, and grass, usually on the tops of\r\ntrees, but occasionally, according to Darwin, on a low cliff, or even on\r\na bush.\r\n\r\nMr. R. Owen, who found this bird breeding near San Geronimo, Guatemala,\r\nApril 2 (Ibis, 1861, p. 67), states that the nest was built on the very\r\ncrown of a high tree in the plain. It was made of small branches twisted\r\ntogether, and had a slight lining of coarse grass. It was shallow, and\r\nformed a mass of considerable size. The eggs were four in number, and\r\nare described as measuring 2.15 inches by 1.60, having a light red\r\nground-color, and spotted and blotched all over with several shades of a\r\ndarker red.\r\n\r\nDr. Heermann found the nest of this species on the Medina River. It\r\nwas built in an oak, and constructed of coarse twigs and lined with\r\nleaves and roots. It was quite recently finished, and contained no\r\neggs. Mr. Dresser states that it breeds all over the country about San\r\nAntonio, building a large bulky nest of sticks, lined with small roots\r\nand grass, generally placed in a low mesquite or oak tree, and laying\r\nthree or four roundish eggs, similar to those of the Honey Buzzard of\r\nEurope. He found several nests in April and through May, and was told\r\nby the _rancheros_ that its eggs are found as late as June. The nests\r\nfound in the collection of Dr. Berlandier, of Matamoras, were coarse\r\nflat structures, composed of flags, reeds, and grass. The nests, though\r\nusually built on the tops of trees, are occasionally found, according\r\nto Darwin, on a low cliff, or even on a bush. The number of the eggs\r\nis rarely, if ever, more than three or four. Four eggs, taken by Dr.\r\nBerlandier near the Rio Grande, exhibit a maximum length of 2.44 inches;\r\nleast length, 2.25; average, 2.41. The diameter of the smallest egg\r\nis 1.75 inches; that of the largest, 1.88; average, 1.81. These eggs\r\nnot only present the great and unusual variation in their length of\r\nnearly eight per cent, but very striking and anomalous deviations from\r\nuniformity are also noticeable in their ground-color and markings. The\r\nground-color varies from a nearly pure white to a very deep russet or\r\ntan-color, and the markings, though all of sepia-brown, differ greatly\r\nin their shades. In some, the ground-color is nearly pure white with\r\na slight pinkish tinge, nearly unspotted at the smaller end, and only\r\nmarked by a few light blotches of a sepia-brown. These markings increase\r\nboth in size and frequency, and become of a deeper shade, as they are\r\nnearer the larger end, until they become almost black, and around this\r\nextremity they form a large confluent ring of blotches and dashes of\r\na dark sepia. Others have a ground-color of light russet, or rather\r\nwhite with a very slight wash of russet, and are marked over the entire\r\nsurface, in about equal proportion, with irregular lines and broad\r\ndashes of dark sepia. Again, in others the ground is of the deepest\r\nrusset or tan-color, and is marked with deep blotches of a dark sepia,\r\nalmost black. The eggs are much more oblong than those of most birds\r\nof prey, and in this respect also show their relation to the Vultures,\r\nrather than to the Hawks or Eagles. They are pyriform, the smaller end\r\ntapers quite abruptly, and varies much more, in its proportions, from\r\nthe larger extremity, than the eggs of most true Hawks.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Gilliss found the South American race exceedingly numerous\r\nthroughout Central and Southern Chile. It was constantly met with along\r\nthe roads, and wherever there was a chance of obtaining a particle of\r\nflesh or offal. At the annual slaughtering of cattle they congregate by\r\nhundreds, and remain without the corral, awaiting their share of the\r\nrejected parts. It was so tame, from not being molested, that it could\r\nbe taken with the lasso, but when thus captured, it fights desperately,\r\nand no amount of attention or kindness can reconcile it to the loss of\r\nliberty.\r\n\r\nThroughout South America it is one of the most abundant species, its\r\ngeographical range extending even to Cape Horn. Mr. Darwin found the\r\n_Polyborus_ nowhere so common as on the grassy savannas of the La Plata,\r\nand says that it is also found on the most desert plains of Patagonia,\r\neven to the rocky and barren shores of the Pacific.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS PANDION, SAVIGNY.\r\n\r\n  _Pandion_, SAVIGN. 1809.

Orn. Bras.\r\nI, 4).\r\n\r\nIn eight out of twelve North American adult specimens, there is but the\r\nslightest amount of spotting on the breast; in two of these (4,366,\r\nPuget Sound, and 12,014, Oregon), none whatever; in 17,228 (♂, Cape St.\r\nLucas), 2,512 (♂ S. F. B. Carlisle, Pa.), 34,065 (♀, Realejo, Central\r\nAmerica), and 5,837 (Fort Steilacoom), there is just a trace of these\r\nspots.\r\n\r\nThe specimens described are those having the breast most distinctly\r\nspotted. Specimens vary, in length of wing, from 17.50 to 20.50. There\r\nappears to be no sexual difference in size.\r\n\r\nThe distinctness or identity of the European and North American Ospreys\r\ncan only be determined by the comparison of a very large series; this we\r\nhave not been able to do, and although it is our belief that they should\r\nnot be separated, the impressions received from a close inspection of\r\nthe specimens before us (twenty-seven American and eighteen European)\r\nseem to indicate the propriety of distinguishing them as races.\r\n\r\nThe male of the pair described appears to be perfectly identical, in all\r\nrespects except size, with a very perfect, finely mounted European male;\r\nindeed, the only discrepancy is in the size, the wing of the European\r\nbird being only nineteen inches, instead of twenty inches as in the\r\nAmerican. The female, however, differs from European females in having\r\nthe brown on the breast in the form of detached faint spots, instead of\r\na continuous grayish-brown wash, more or less continuous.\r\n\r\nThe types of our descriptions are the only specimens of the American\r\nseries which show even an approach to the amount of spotting on the\r\nbreast constant in birds from Europe.\r\n\r\nThe American bird, as indicated by the series before us, would seem to\r\nbe rather the larger; for the European specimens measure uniformly about\r\nan inch less than the American in length of the wing.\r\n\r\nIn all the American specimens, of both sexes, the shafts of the\r\ntail-feathers are continuously white, while in the European they are\r\nclear white only at the roots or for the basal half.\r\n\r\nWhile, in consideration of the above facts, I am for the present\r\ncompelled to recognize the American _Pandion_ under the distinctive name\r\nof _carolinensis_, I may say, that, if any European birds occur with the\r\nbreast immaculate,—no matter what the proportion of specimens,—I shall\r\nat once waive all claims to distinctness for the American bird.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF SPECIMENS EXAMINED.\r\n\r\nNational Museum, 7; Philadelphia Academy, 3; New York Museum, 1\r\n(Brazil); Boston Society, 6; Museum Cambridge, 9; Cab.

The Fish Hawk of North America, whether we regard it as a\r\nrace or a distinct species from that of the Old World fauna, is found\r\nthroughout the continent, from the fur regions around Hudson’s Bay\r\nto Central America. According to Mr. Hill, it is seen occasionally\r\nin Jamaica, and, as I learn by letter from Dr. Gundlach, is also\r\noccasionally met with in the island of Cuba; but it is not known to\r\nbreed in either place. Dr. Woodhouse, in his report of the expedition\r\nto the Zuñi River, speaks of this Hawk as common along the coasts of\r\nTexas and California. Dr. Heermann mentions it as common on the borders\r\nof all the large rivers of California in summer; and Dr. Gambel also\r\nrefers to it as abundant along the coast of that State, and on its rocky\r\nislands, in which latter localities it breeds. I am not aware that it\r\nhas ever been found farther south than Texas, on the eastern coast. On\r\nthe Pacific coast it appears to have a more extended distribution both\r\nnorth and south, but nowhere to be so abundant as on certain parts of\r\nthe Atlantic coast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Pandion haliætus_ (European specimen).]\r\n\r\nMr. Bischoff obtained this species about Sitka, where he found it\r\nbreeding, and took its eggs; and Mr. Dall procured several specimens\r\nnear Nulato in May, 1867, and in 1868. They were not uncommon,\r\nfrequenting the small streams, and were summer visitors, returning to\r\nthe same nest each season. Colonel Grayson found it breeding as far\r\nsouth as the islands of the Tres Marias, in latitude 31° 30′ north.\r\nThe nest was on the top of a giant cactus. Mr. Xantus describes it as\r\nbreeding on the ground at Cape St. Lucas.\r\n\r\nIn the interior it was met with by Richardson, but its migrations do\r\nnot appear to reach the extreme northern limits of the continent. That\r\nobserving naturalist saw nothing of this bird when he was coasting\r\nalong the shores of the Arctic Sea, nor did Mr. Hearne find it on the\r\nbarren grounds north of Fort Churchill. Its eggs were collected on the\r\nMackenzie River by Mr. Ross, and on the Yukon by Messrs. Lockhart,\r\nSibbiston, McDougal, and Jones. At Fort Yukon, Mr. Lockhart found it\r\nnesting on a high tree (S. I. 15,676).\r\n\r\nOn the Atlantic coast it is found from Labrador to Florida, with the\r\nexception of a portion of Massachusetts around Boston, where it does not\r\nbreed, and where it is very rarely met with. It is most abundant from\r\nLong Island to the Chesapeake, and throughout this long extent of coast\r\nis very numerous, often breeding in large communities, to the number of\r\nseveral hundred pairs. Away from the coast it is much less frequent, but\r\nis occasionally met with on the banks of the larger rivers and lakes,\r\nand in such instances usually in solitary pairs. Dr. Hayden found it\r\nnesting in the Wind River Mountains on the top of a large cottonwood\r\ntree.\r\n\r\nMr. Allen reports this species as abundant everywhere in Florida, and\r\nas especially so around the lakes of the Upper St. Johns, where it\r\ncommences nesting in January. At Lake Monroe he counted six nests from a\r\nsingle point of view. It is said by fishermen to occur on the coast of\r\nLabrador, but it is not cited as found there by Mr. Audubon, nor is it\r\nso given by Dr. Coues. It is, however, very common on the coast of Nova\r\nScotia, breeding in the vicinity of most of the harbors. It is given by\r\nMr. Boardman as common near Calais, where it arrives about the 10th of\r\nApril, and remains until the middle of September. It is found along the\r\nwhole coast more or less abundantly, especially near the heads of the\r\nnumerous estuaries.\r\n\r\nIn Central America it is cited by Salvin as occurring abundantly on both\r\nthe coast regions, and is particularly common about Belize, where it is\r\nbelieved to breed. It is said by Mr. Newton to be found on the island of\r\nSt. Croix at all times except during the breeding-season. It was also\r\noccasionally seen at Trinidad by Mr. E. C. Taylor.\r\n\r\nThe Fish Hawk appears to subsist wholly on the fish which it takes\r\nby its own active exertions, plunging for them in the open deep, or\r\ncatching them in the shallows of rivers where the depth does not permit\r\na plunge. Its abundance is measured somewhat by its supply of food; and\r\nin some parts of the country it is hardly found, in others it appears in\r\nsolitary pairs, and again in a few districts it is quite gregarious.\r\n\r\nThe American Fish Hawk is migratory in its habits, leaving our coasts\r\nearly in the fall of the year, and returning soon after the close of the\r\nwinter. Sir John Richardson states that the time of its arrival in the\r\nfur regions is as early as April, and on the coast it has been noticed\r\nin the middle of March. It breeds on the coast of Nova Scotia late in\r\nJune, on that of Maine earlier in the same month, in New Jersey and\r\nMaryland in May, and still earlier in California.\r\n\r\nIt is said to arrive on the New Jersey coast with great regularity\r\nabout the 21st of March, and to be rarely seen there after the 22d\r\nof September. It not unfrequently finds, on its first arrival, the\r\nponds, bays, and estuaries ice-bound, and experiences some difficulty\r\nin procuring food. Yet I can find no instance on record where our Fish\r\nHawk has been known to molest any other bird or land-animal, to feed on\r\nthem, though their swiftness of flight, and their strength of wing and\r\nclaws, would seem to render such attacks quite easy. On their arrival\r\nthe Fish Hawks are said to combine, and to wage a determined war upon\r\nthe White-headed Eagles, often succeeding by their numbers and courage\r\nin driving them temporarily from their haunts. But they never attack\r\nthem singly.\r\n\r\nThe Fish Hawk nests almost invariably on the tops of trees, and this\r\nhabit has been noticed in all parts of the country. It is not without\r\nexceptions, but these are quite rare. William H. Edwards, Esq., found\r\none of their nests constructed near West Point, New York, on a high\r\ncliff overhanging the Hudson River. The trees on which their nests are\r\nbuilt are not unfrequently killed by their excrement or the saline\r\ncharacter of their food and the materials of their nest. The bird is\r\nbold and confiding, often constructing its nest near a frequented path,\r\nor even upon a highway. Near the eastern extremity of the Wiscasset\r\n(Me.) bridge, and directly upon the stage-road, a nest of this Hawk was\r\noccupied several years. It was upon the top of a low pine-tree, was\r\nreadily accessible, the tree being easily climbed, and was so near the\r\nroad that, in passing, the young birds could frequently be heard in\r\ntheir nest, uttering their usual cries for food.\r\n\r\nThe nests are usually composed externally of large sticks, often\r\npiled to the height of five feet, with a diameter of three. In a nest\r\ndescribed by Wilson, he found, intermixed with a mass of sticks,\r\ncorn-stalks, sea-weed, wet turf, mullein-stalks, etc., the whole lined\r\nwith dry sea-grass (_Zostera marina_), and large enough to fill a cart\r\nand be no inconsiderable load for a horse.\r\n\r\nWhen the nest of this Hawk is visited, especially if it contain young,\r\nthe male bird will frequently make violent, and sometimes dangerous,\r\nattacks upon the intruder. In one instance, in Maine, the talons of\r\none of these Hawks penetrated through a thick cloth cap, and laid bare\r\nthe scalp of a lad who had climbed to its nest, and very nearly hurled\r\nhim to the ground. A correspondent quoted by Wilson narrates a nearly\r\nsimilar instance of courageous and desperate defence of the young. They\r\nare very devoted in their attentions to their mates, and supply them\r\nwith food while on the nest. Wilson relates a touching instance of this\r\ndevotion, where a female that had lost one leg, and was unable to fish\r\nfor herself, was abundantly supplied by her mate.\r\n\r\nIn some localities the Fish Hawk nests in large communities, as many as\r\nthree hundred pairs having been observed nesting on one small island.\r\nWhen a new nest is to be constructed, the whole community has been known\r\nto take part in its completion. They are remarkably tolerant towards\r\nsmaller birds, and permit the Purple Grakle (_Quiscalus purpureus_) to\r\nconstruct its nests in the interstices of their own. Wilson observed no\r\nless than four of these nests thus clustered in a single Fish Hawk’s\r\nnest, with a fifth on an adjoining branch.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of the Fish-Hawk are usually three in number, often only two,\r\nand more rarely four. They are subject to great variations as to their\r\nground-color, the number, shade, and distribution of the blotches of\r\nsecondary coloring with which they are marked, and also as to their size\r\nand shape. Their ground-color is most frequently a creamy-white, with a\r\nvery perceptible tinge of red. This varies, however, from an almost pure\r\nshade of cream, without any admixture, to so deep a shade of red that\r\nwhite ceases to be noticeable. Their markings are combinations of an\r\nalmost endless variation of shades of umber-brown, a light claret-brown,\r\nan intermingling of both these shades, with occasional intermixtures of\r\npurplish-brown. They vary in length from 2.56 to 2.24 inches, and in\r\nbreadth from 1.88 to 1.69 inches. It would be impossible to describe\r\nwith any degree of preciseness the innumerable variations in size,\r\nshape, ground-color, or shades of markings, these eggs present. They\r\nall have a certain nameless phase of resemblance, and may be readily\r\ndistinguished from any other eggs except those of their kindred. There\r\nare, however, certain shades of wine-colored markings in the eggs of the\r\nFish Hawk of Europe, and also in that of Australia, that I have never\r\nnoticed in any eggs of the American bird; but that this peculiarity is\r\nuniversal I am not able to say. The smallest egg of the _carolinensis_\r\nmeasures 2.31 by 1.62 inches; the largest, 2.56 by 1.88.\r\n\r\nThe European egg is smaller than the American, is often, but not always,\r\nmore spherical, and is less pointed at the smaller end. Among its\r\nvarieties is one which is quite common, and is very different from any I\r\nhave ever observed among at least five hundred specimens of the American\r\nwhich I have examined.\r\n\r\nAn Osprey’s egg in my collection, taken near Aarhuus, in Denmark, by\r\nRev. H. B. Tristram, of Castle Eden, England, measures only 2.12 inches\r\nin length,—shorter by a fourth of an inch than the smallest American,—in\r\nbreadth 1.62 inches; its ground-color is a rich cream, with a slight\r\ntinge of claret, and it is marked over its whole surface with large\r\nblotches of a beautifully deep shade of chocolate.\r\n\r\nIn their habits the European and the American birds seem to present\r\nother decided differences. The American is a very social bird, often\r\nliving in large communities during the breeding-season. The European is\r\nfound almost invariably in solitary pairs, and frequents fresh water\r\nalmost exclusively. The American, though found also on large rivers and\r\nlakes, is much the most abundant on the sea-shore. The European bird\r\nrarely builds on trees, the American almost always. The latter rarely\r\nresorts to rocky cliffs to breed, the European almost uniformly do so.\r\nThere is no instance on record of the American species attacking smaller\r\nbirds or inferior land animals with intent to feed on them. The European\r\nspecies is said to prey on Ducks and other wild-fowl.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS NAUCLERUS, VIGORS.\r\n\r\n  _Nauclerus_, VIG. 1825.

The Swallow-tailed Hawk has an extended distribution in the\r\neastern portion of North America. It is irregularly distributed; in\r\na large part of the country it occurs only occasionally and in small\r\nnumbers, and is probably nowhere abundant except in the southwestern\r\nGulf States, or along the rivers and inland waters. On the Atlantic\r\ncoast it has been traced, according to Mr. Lawrence, as far north as\r\nNew York City. According to Mr. Nuttall, individuals have been seen\r\non the Mississippi as far as St. Anthony’s Falls, in latitude 44°.\r\nIt is found more or less common along the tributaries of the Ohio\r\nand Mississippi, where it is essentially a prairie bird, and breeds\r\nin Southern Wisconsin, in Iowa, Nebraska, and Kansas, and throughout\r\nIllinois. It has been taken in Cuba, and occasionally also in Jamaica.\r\nIt is found in Central America, and in South America to Northern Brazil,\r\nBuenos Ayres, and, according to Vieillot, to Peru. It nests in South\r\nCarolina and in all the States that border on the Gulf of Mexico,\r\nfrequenting the banks of rivers, but is not found near the seaboard.\r\n\r\nMr. Thure Kumlien noticed a pair of these Hawks in the neighborhood of\r\nFort Atkinson, Wis., in the summer of 1854, and had no doubt they were\r\nbreeding, though he was not able to find their nest.\r\n\r\nMr. Osbert Salvin, in a letter from San Geronimo, in the Vera Paz (Ibis,\r\n1860, p. 195), states that he has positive information that this Hawk\r\nbreeds in the mountains about Coban, his chief collector having found a\r\nnest there with young the previous year. Specimens had been before that\r\nreceived by Mr. Sclater, forwarded by Mr. Skinner, from the neighborhood\r\nof Cajabon, Guatemala. It was said to be more numerous at Belize.\r\n\r\nMr. Dresser informs us that he was so fortunate as to find this graceful\r\nbird very abundant in some parts of Texas, and he had a good opportunity\r\nof observing and admiring it in its true home. It was occasional about\r\nSan Antonio de Bexar, where it was usually seen late in July before\r\nheavy rains. Near the Rio Grande or in Texas he did not see it at all.\r\nAt Peach Creek and near Gonzales he found it not unfrequent; and on\r\nthe Colorado, Brazos, and Trinity Rivers it was one of the most common\r\nbirds. It only remains there during the summer months, arriving early\r\nin April, and breeding later than the other birds of prey. On the 26th\r\nof May he found them very abundant on a creek near the Colorado, but\r\nnone had commenced breeding. They were preparing their nests; and, from\r\nthe number he saw about one large grove, he judged that they breed in\r\nsociety. On his wounding one of them, the rest came flying over his head\r\nin the manner of Seagulls, uttering harsh cries; and he counted forty or\r\nfifty over him at one time. He was informed that these Kites build high\r\nup in oak, sycamore, or cottonwood trees, sometimes quite far from the\r\ncreeks.\r\n\r\nMr. Dresser describes this bird as exhibiting a singularly pleasing\r\nappearance on the wing, gliding in large circles, without apparent\r\neffort, in very rapid flight. The tail is widely spread, and when\r\nsailing in circles the wings are almost motionless. One was noticed\r\nas it was hunting after grasshoppers. It went over the ground as\r\ncarefully as a well-trained pointer, every now and then stooping to\r\npick up a grasshopper, the feet and bill seeming to touch the insect\r\nsimultaneously. They were very fond of wasp grubs, and would carry a\r\nnest to a high perch, hold it in one claw, and sit there picking out the\r\ngrubs. Their stomachs were found to contain beetles and grasshoppers.\r\n\r\nDr. Woodhouse speaks of this Hawk as common in Texas, and also in the\r\ncountry of the Creek and Cherokee nations. He confirms the accounts\r\nwhich have been received of its fondness for the neighborhood of\r\nstreams, and adds that along the Arkansas and its tributaries it was\r\nvery abundant.\r\n\r\nMr. Ridgway states that this Hawk arrives in Richland County, Ill., in\r\nMay, and lives during the summer on the small prairies, feeding there\r\nupon small snakes, particularly the little green snake (_Leptophis\r\næstivus_) and the different species of _Eutænia_. It builds its\r\nnest there among the oak or hickory trees which border the streams\r\nintersecting the prairies. Towards the latter part of summer it becomes\r\nvery abundant on the prairies, being attracted by the abundance of\r\nfood, which at that season consists very largely of insects, especially\r\n_Neuroptera_. It is most abundant in August, and in bright weather\r\ndozens of them may be seen at a time sailing round in pursuit of\r\ninsects.\r\n\r\nMr. Audubon speaks of the movements of this bird in flight as\r\nastonishingly rapid, the deep curves they describe, their sudden\r\ndoublings and crossings, and the extreme ease with which they seem\r\nto cleave the air, never failing to excite admiration. In the States\r\nof Louisiana and Mississippi, where, he adds, these birds are very\r\nabundant, they arrive in large companies in the beginning of April, and\r\nutter a sharp and plaintive note. They all come from the westward; and\r\nhe has counted upwards of a hundred, in the space of an hour, passing\r\nover him in an easterly direction. They feed on the wing, and their\r\nprincipal food is said to be grasshoppers, caterpillars, small snakes,\r\nlizards, and frogs. They sweep over the fields, and seem to alight for\r\na moment to secure a snake or some other object. They also frequent the\r\ncreeks, to pick up water-snakes basking on the floating logs.\r\n\r\nOn the ground their movements are said to be awkward in the extreme.\r\nWhen wounded, they rarely strike with their talons, or offer serious\r\nresistance. They never attack other birds or quadrupeds to prey upon\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThis Hawk is a great wanderer, and a number of instances are on record\r\nof its having been taken in Europe. One of these was in Scotland, in\r\n1772; another in England, in 1805.\r\n\r\nMr. R. Owen (Ibis, 1860, p. 241), while travelling from Coban to San\r\nGeronimo, in Guatemala, among the mountains, came suddenly upon a large\r\nflock of two or three hundred of these Hawks, which were pursuing and\r\npreying upon a swarm of bees. At times they passed within four or five\r\nyards of him. Every now and then the neck was observed to be bent slowly\r\nand gracefully, bringing the head quite under the body. At the same time\r\nthe foot, with the talons contracted as if grasping some object, would\r\nbe brought forward to meet the beak. The beak was then seen to open and\r\nto close again, and then the head was again raised and the foot thrown\r\nback. This movement was repeatedly observed, and it was quite clear to\r\nhim that the birds were preying upon the bees.\r\n\r\nThis Hawk constructs its nest on tall trees, usually overhanging or\r\nnear running water. The nest is like that of the Crow in its general\r\nappearance. It is constructed externally of dry twigs and sticks,\r\nintermixed with which are great quantities of the long Spanish moss\r\npeculiar to the Southern States, and lined with dry grasses, leaves, and\r\nfeathers. One found by Dr. C. Kollock, of Cheraw, S. C., in May, 1855,\r\ncontaining young, was on a large tree, not near the trunk, but on one of\r\nthe projecting branches, and difficult of approach.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are described by Mr. Audubon as from four to six in number,\r\nof a greenish-white color, with a few irregular blotches of dark brown\r\nat the larger end. The drawing of an egg, obtained by Dr. Trudeau\r\nin Louisiana, and which was made by that gentleman, is very nearly\r\nspheroidal, and its measurements are, length 1.75 inches, breadth 1.56.\r\nIt corresponds with Mr. Audubon’s description of the egg of this Hawk.\r\n\r\nAn egg in the collection of the Smithsonian Institution, taken in Iowa\r\nby Mr. Krider, does not correspond very well with the description and\r\nfigure mentioned. It measures 1.80 in length by 1.40 in breadth; its\r\nform is very regularly oval, both ends being of nearly the same shape.\r\nThe ground-color is a creamy white, one end (the smaller) splashed\r\nwith large confluent blotches of ferruginous, and the remainder of the\r\nsurface more sparsely spotted with the same; these rusty blotches are\r\nrelieved by smaller, sparser spots of very dark brown.\r\n\r\nDr. Cooper, in a letter dated Sioux City, May 21, 1860, mentions finding\r\nthe nest of this Hawk in a high tree in Northwestern Iowa, latitude 41°\r\n30′. The bird had not begun to lay.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ELANUS, SAVIGNY.\r\n\r\n  _Elanus_, SAV. 1809. (Type, _Falco melanopterus_, DAUDIN.)\r\n  _Milans_, BOIE, 1822.\r\n\r\nGEN. CHAR.

CHAR. _Adult._ Upper surface, including occiput, nape,\r\ninterscapulars, scapulars, rump, upper tail-coverts, and wings\r\n(except lesser and middle coverts), soft, delicate, rather light\r\nbluish-cinereous, becoming gradually white on anterior portion of the\r\nhead above. Rest of the head, with the tail, lining of the wing, and\r\nentire lower parts, pure white, sometimes with a very faint tinge of\r\npale pearl-blue, laterally beneath; two middle tail-feathers ashy, but\r\nmuch lighter than the rump; shafts of tail-feathers black, except toward\r\nends. Bristly loral feathers (forming ante-orbital spot, extending\r\nnarrowly above the eye), a very large patch on the shoulder, covering\r\nlesser and middle wing-coverts, and large quadrate spot on under side\r\nof wing (on first row of primary coverts), deep black. Under side of\r\nprimaries deep cinereous (darker than outer surface); under surface of\r\nsecondaries nearly white. Second quill longest; third scarcely shorter\r\n(sometimes equal, or even longest); first longer than fourth. Tail\r\nslightly emarginated, the longest feather (next to outer) being about\r\n.50 longer than the middle, and .60 (or more) longer than the lateral,\r\nwhich is shortest.\r\n\r\n_Male._ Wing, 12.50; tail, 7.10; tarsus, 1.20; middle toe, 1.15.\r\n\r\n_Female._ Wing, 12.80; tail, 7.10; tarsus, 1.45; middle toe, 1.35.\r\n\r\nSpecimens not perfectly adult have the primary coverts, secondaries, and\r\ninner primaries, slightly tipped with white.\r\n\r\nStill younger individuals have these white tips broader, the tail more\r\nashy, and the upper parts with numerous feathers dull brown, tipped\r\nnarrowly with white; the breast with sparse longitudinal touches of\r\nbrownish.\r\n\r\n_Young_ (♀, 48,826, Santiago, Chile, May, 1866; Dr. Philippi). Occiput\r\nand nape thickly marked with broad streaks of dusky, tinged with rusty;\r\nscapulars umber-brown, tipped with rusty; all the feathers of wings\r\nnarrowly tipped with white; tail-feathers with a subterminal irregular\r\nbar of dark ashy; breast tinged with rufous, and with badly defined\r\ncuneate spots of deeper rusty. Wing, 12.25; tail, 7.50. (Perhaps not the\r\nyoungest stage.)\r\n\r\nHAB. Tropical and warm temperate America (except the West Indies), from\r\nChile and Buenos Ayres to Florida, South Carolina, Southern Illinois,\r\nand California; winter resident in latter State.\r\n\r\nLocalities: Xalapa (SCL. 1857, 201); Guatemala (SCL. Ibis, I, 220);\r\nBrazil (PELZ. Orn. Bras. I, 6); Buenos Ayres (SCL. & SALV. 1869, 160);\r\nVenezuela (SCL. & SALV. 1869, 252).\r\n\r\nSpecimens are from Santa Clara, California, Fort Arbuckle, Mirador and\r\nOrizaba, Mexico, Chile, and Buenos Ayres; from all points the same bird.\r\n\r\nThis species presents a very close resemblance to the _E. melanopterus_\r\nof Europe, and the most evident specific difference can only be detected\r\nby raising the wing, the under side of which is quite different in the\r\ntwo, there being in the European bird no trace whatever of the black\r\npatch so conspicuous in the American species. The primaries, also, on\r\nboth webs are lighter ash, while the ash of the upper parts in general\r\nis darker than in _leucurus_ and invades more the head above, the\r\nforehead merely approaching white. The tail is more deeply emarginated,\r\nand the proportions of the primaries are quite different, the second\r\nbeing much longer than the third, and the first nearly as long as the\r\nsecond, far exceeding the third, instead of being about equal to the\r\nfourth. In the _melanopterus_, too, the black borders the eye all round,\r\nextending back in a short streak from the posterior angle, instead\r\nof being restricted to the anterior region and upper eyelid, as in\r\n_leucurus_.\r\n\r\nA specimen of “_E. axillaris_” from Australia (13,844, T. R. Peale)\r\nappears, except upon close examination, to be absolutely identical\r\nin all the minutiæ of coloration, and in the wing-formula, with _E.\r\nleucurus_; and differs only very slightly in the measurements of bill\r\nand feet, having these proportionally larger, as will be seen from the\r\ntable. Another (32,577, H. Mactier Warfield) has the upper parts so pale\r\nas to be nearly white.\r\n\r\nA young specimen of _E. axillaris_ differs from that of _E. leucurus_ as\r\nfollows: the occiput, nape, and dorsal region are stained or overlaid by\r\ndull ashy-rufous, instead of dark brownish-ashy; more blackish on the\r\nhead. No other differences are appreciable.\r\n\r\nA very characteristic distinction between _leucurus_ and _axillaris_\r\nis seen in the coloration of the inner webs of the secondaries: in the\r\nformer, they are abruptly lighter than the outer webs, often pure white,\r\nin very striking contrast to the deep ash of the outer surface; in the\r\nlatter, both webs are of about the same shade of ash, which is much\r\npaler than in the other race. Occasional specimens of _leucurus_ occur,\r\nhowever, in which there is little difference in tint between the two\r\nwebs.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF SPECIMENS EXAMINED.\r\n\r\nNational Museum, 10; Philadelphia Academy, 2; New York Museum, 2; Boston\r\nSociety, 4; Cambridge Museum, 2; Cab.

The Black-shouldered Hawk is a southern, western, and South\r\nAmerican species. On the Pacific it is found to occupy a much more\r\nnorthern range of locality than in the eastern States, where it is not\r\nfound above South Carolina and Southern Illinois. Specimens have been\r\ntaken near San Francisco in midwinter.\r\n\r\nSeveral individuals of this species, precisely identical with others\r\nfrom the United States, were taken by Lieutenant Gilliss, in the\r\nastronomical expedition to Chile. Its range in South America does\r\nnot appear to be confined, as was supposed, to the western coast,\r\nas specimens are recorded by Von Pelzeln as having been obtained by\r\nNatterer in Brazil, at Ytarare, Irisanga, and San Joaquin, on the Rio\r\nBranco, in August, February, and January. These were taken on the\r\nheights. They are also found in the countries of Mexico and Central\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Elanus leucurus._]\r\n\r\nThis species has been met with in South Carolina, Georgia, Florida,\r\nAlabama, Mississippi, Louisiana, and Texas, and probably occurs also\r\nin New Mexico and Arizona. Dr. Gambel describes them as very abundant\r\nin California, where they are said to be familiar in their habits, and\r\nbreed in clumps of oaks, in the immediate vicinity of habitations. Dr.\r\nHeermann also speaks of them as common in that State. But neither of\r\nthese naturalists appears to have met with their nests or eggs. It is\r\nnot mentioned either as a bird of Cuba or Jamaica by Mr. Lembeye, Dr.\r\nGundlach, Mr. Gosse, or Mr. March.\r\n\r\nDr. Cooper speaks of this bird as a beautiful and harmless species,\r\nquite abundant in the middle districts of California, remaining in\r\nlarge numbers, during winter, among the extensive tulé marshes of the\r\nSacramento and other valleys. He did not meet with any during winter at\r\nFort Mohave, nor do they seem to have been collected by any one in the\r\ndry interior of that State, nor in the southern part of California. He\r\nhas met with them as far north as Baulines Bay, and near Monterey, but\r\nalways about streams or marshes. Their food consisted entirely of mice,\r\ngophers, small birds, and snakes, and they were not known to attack the\r\ninmates of the poultry-yard.\r\n\r\nBonaparte, who first introduced the species into our fauna, received his\r\nspecimen from East Florida. The late Dr. Ravenel obtained one living\r\nnear Charleston, S. C., which he kept several days without being able to\r\ninduce it to eat. Mr. Audubon received another, taken forty miles west\r\nof Charleston by Mr. Francis Lee. This gentleman, as quoted by Audubon,\r\nmentioned its sailing very beautifully, and quite high in the air, over\r\na wet meadow, in pursuit of snipe. It would poise itself in the manner\r\nof the common Sparrow Hawk, and, suddenly closing its wings, plunge\r\ntowards its prey with great velocity, making a peculiar sound with its\r\nwings as it passed through the air. Its cries on being wounded resembled\r\nthose of the Mississippi Kite. It was so shy that Mr. Lee was only able\r\nto approach it on horseback.\r\n\r\nAudubon states that Mr. Ward, his assistant, found this species breeding\r\non the Santee River early in the month of March. Their nests were\r\nsaid to be placed on low trees near the margin of the river, and to\r\nbe not unlike those of the common Crow, but without the substantial\r\nlining of its nests. Mr. Ward also mentioned seeing them flying over\r\nthe cane-brakes, in pursuit of large insects, in the manner of the\r\nMississippi Kite, and finding the birds very shy.\r\n\r\nIn Southern Illinois it has been known to occur as far north as Mount\r\nCarmel, where Mr. Ridgway saw a pair in July, flying about among the\r\ndead trees bordering a lagoon near the Wabash River.\r\n\r\nMr. Audubon, in his visit to Texas, saw several of these birds flying at\r\na small elevation over the large marshes, and coursing in search of its\r\nprey in the manner of the common Marsh Harrier.\r\n\r\nDr. Heermann found the extensive marshes of Suisun, Napa, and Sacramento\r\nValleys the favorite resorts of these birds, especially during the\r\nwinter, and there they seemed to find a plentiful supply of insects and\r\nmice. They ranged over their feeding-grounds in small flocks from a\r\nsingle pair up to six or seven. He fell in with an isolated couple in\r\nthe mountains between Elizabeth Lake and Williamson’s Pass, hovering\r\nover a small freshwater marsh. In July and August the young were quite\r\nabundant, from which Dr. Heermann inferred that it does not migrate for\r\nthe purposes of incubation. Dr. Gambel, who procured his specimens at\r\nthe Mission of St. John, near Monterey, describes it as flying low and\r\ncircling over the plains in the manner of a _Circus_, and as feeding\r\non the small birds. It was easy of approach when perched on trees, and\r\nuttered a loud shrill cry when wounded, and fought viciously.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Gilliss, who found them in Chile, describes the nest as\r\ncomposed of small sticks, and states that the number of the eggs is from\r\nfour to six, and that they are of a dirty yellowish-white with brownish\r\nspots. The common name of this Hawk in Chile is _Bailarin_ (from the\r\nverb _bailar_, to dance or balance), from the graceful and easy manner\r\nin which it seems almost to float upward or to sink in the air.\r\n\r\nAn egg of this species, in the collection of the Boston Society of\r\nNatural History, measures 1.64 inches in length by 1.48 in breadth. In\r\nshape it is very nearly spherical, and equally obtuse at either end. The\r\nground-color, though nowhere very distinctly apparent, appears to be of\r\na dull white, strongly tinged with a reddish hue. Distributed over the\r\nentire egg are broad deep flashes of a dark mahogany-brown, intermingled\r\nwith others of a similar color, but lighter in shading. These cover the\r\negg more or less completely, in the greater portion of its surface. This\r\negg was taken near Fort Arbuckle, Indian Territory, May 9, 1861, by\r\nJ. H. Clark, Esq., and sent to the Smithsonian Institution.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ICTINIA, VIEILLOT.\r\n\r\n  _Ictinia_, VIEILL. 1816. (Type, _Falco mississippiensis_, WILSON.)\r\n  _Nertus_, BOIE, 1826.

Form falcon-like; the neck short, wings long, and pointed,\r\nthe primaries and rectrices strong and stiff, and the organization\r\nrobust. Bill short and deep, the commissure irregularly toothed, and\r\nnotched; gonys very convex, ascending terminally; cere narrow; nostril\r\nvery small, nearly circular; feet small, but robust; tarsus about equal\r\nto middle toe, with a distinct frontal series of broad transverse\r\nscutellæ; claws rather short, but strongly curved, slightly grooved\r\nbeneath, their edges sharp. Third quill longest; first of variable\r\nproportion with the rest. Tail moderate, the feathers wide, broader\r\nterminally, and emarginated.\r\n\r\nThis genus is peculiar to America, the two most closely related genera\r\nbeing _Elanus_ on the one hand and _Harpagus_ on the other. Its species\r\nbelong to the tropical and subtropical regions, one of them (_I.\r\nplumbea_) generally distributed throughout the intertropical portions,\r\nthe other (_I. mississippiensis_) peculiar to Mexico and the southern\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nIn their habits, they are very aerial, like the genus _Nauclerus_,\r\nsailing for the greater time in broad circles overhead, occasionally\r\nperforming graceful evolutions as they gyrate about. Like _Nauclerus_,\r\nthey are also partially gregarious, and, like it, feed chiefly on\r\ninsects and small reptiles, which they eat while flying.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecies.\r\n\r\n  COMMON CHARACTERS. _Adult._ Uniform plumbeous, becoming lighter\r\n  (whitish) on the head, and darker (blackish) on the primaries and\r\n  tail.

This Hawk appears to be confined to the extreme southern and\r\nsouthwestern portion of the Gulf States. It is not known to occur\r\nfarther north than South Carolina on the Atlantic, though on the\r\nMississippi it has been traced much farther north. It is most abundant\r\nabout the Mississippi. It was first discovered by Wilson near Natchez,\r\nwhere he found it quite abundant. Mr. Say afterwards observed it far\r\nup the Mississippi, at one of Major Long’s cantonments. On Captain\r\nSitgreave’s expedition to the Zuñi and Colorado Rivers, it was found\r\nto be exceedingly abundant in Eastern Texas, as well as in the Indian\r\nTerritory, more particularly on the Arkansas River and its tributaries.\r\n\r\nDresser states that he found this Hawk by no means an unfrequent bird\r\nin Texas, and generally in the same localities with the _Nauclerus\r\nforficatus_. It was not very common near San Antonio, but was\r\noccasionally found, and even breeds there, as he procured both the old\r\nand the young birds during the summer. In travelling eastward in the\r\nmonth of May, he first noticed them near the Rio Colorado, and was told\r\nby the negroes on one of the plantations that they were then nesting. On\r\nthe 20th of May he shot a female on the banks of that river, from which\r\nhe extracted a fully formed egg. It was almost round, and rather large\r\nfor the size of the bird. Eastward from the Colorado he also saw this\r\nHawk quite often.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Ictinia mississippiensis._]\r\n\r\nThough the species, no doubt, occurs in Mexico, Mr. Sclater states\r\nthat all the Mexican _Ictiniæ_ which he has seen, collected by Sallè,\r\nBoucard, and others, have belonged to _I. plumbea_ (Ibis, 1860, p. 104).\r\nA single specimen from Coban, Central America, was obtained by Mr.\r\nSalvin, but _I. plumbea_ was by far the most common species of _Ictinia_\r\nin Vera Paz.\r\n\r\nThis species was first discovered within the territory of the United\r\nStates by Wilson, in his visit to Natchez. He had noticed the bird\r\nsailing about in easy circles, and at a considerable height in the air,\r\ngenerally in company with the Turkey Buzzards, whose manner of flight\r\nit almost exactly imitated, so much so as to make it appear either a\r\nminiature of that species, or like one of them at a great distance, both\r\nbeing observed to soar at great heights previous to a storm. Wilson\r\nconjectures that this apparent similarity of manner of flight may be\r\nattributable to their pursuit of their respective kinds of food,—the\r\nBuzzard on the lookout for carrion, and the birds of the present species\r\nin search of those large beetles that are known to fly in the higher\r\nregions of the air, and which, in the three individuals dissected by\r\nhim, were the only substances found in their stomachs. For several\r\nmiles, as he passed near Bayou Manahak, the trees were swarming with\r\na kind of _Cicada_, or locust, that made a deafening noise. He there\r\nobserved a number of these birds sweeping about among the trees in the\r\nmanner of Swallows, evidently in pursuit of the insects, which proved\r\nindeed, on dissection, to be their principal food.\r\n\r\nOne of these Hawks was slightly wounded by Wilson, and though disabled\r\nand precipitated from a great height exhibited evidence of great\r\nstrength and an almost unconquerable spirit. As he approached to pick\r\nit up, the bird instantly gave battle, striking rapidly with its claws,\r\nwheeling round and round, and defending itself with great vigilance\r\nand dexterity, while its dark red eye sparkled with rage. His captor\r\nwished to preserve it alive, but, notwithstanding all his precautions in\r\nseizing it, the Hawk struck one of its claws into his hand with great\r\nforce, and this could only be disengaged by Wilson’s dividing the sinew\r\nof the heel with a pen-knife. As long as the bird afterwards lived with\r\nWilson, it seemed to watch every movement, erecting the feathers of the\r\nback of its head, and eying him with a savage fierceness. Wilson was\r\nmuch struck with its great strength, its extent of wing, its energy of\r\ncharacter, and its ease and rapidity of flight.\r\n\r\nAudubon regards this species as remarkable for its devotion to its\r\nyoung, and narrates that in one instance he saw the female bird lift up\r\nand attempt to carry out of his reach one of her fledglings. She carried\r\nit in her claws the distance of thirty yards or more.\r\n\r\nHe also describes their flight as graceful, vigorous, and protracted.\r\nAt times the bird seems to float in the air as if motionless, or sails\r\nin broad and regular circles, then, suddenly closing its wings, is\r\nseen to slide along to some distance, and then renews its curves. At\r\nother times it sweeps in long undulations with the swiftness of an\r\narrow, passing within touching distance of a branch on which it seeks an\r\ninsect. Sometimes it is said to fly in hurried zigzags, and at others to\r\nturn over and over in the manner of a Tumbler Pigeon. Audubon has often\r\nobserved it make a dash at the Turkey Buzzard, and give it chase, as if\r\nin sport, and so annoy this bird as to drive it to a distance. It feeds\r\non the wing with great ease and dexterity. It rarely, if ever, alights\r\non the earth; and, when wounded, its movements on the ground are very\r\nawkward. It is never known to attack birds or quadrupeds of any kind,\r\nthough it will pursue and annoy foxes and Crows, and drive them to seek\r\nshelter from its attacks. The Mississippi Kite is said to be by no means\r\na shy bird, and may be easily approached when alight, yet it usually\r\nperches so high that it is not always easy to shoot it.\r\n\r\nIn Southern Illinois, Mr. Ridgway found this Kite to be a very abundant\r\nsummer bird on the prairies. There it is found from May till near\r\nthe end of September, and always associated with the Swallowtail\r\n(_Nauclerus forficatus_.) It breeds in the timber which borders the\r\nstreams intersecting the prairies; but it is not until the hottest\r\nweather of July and August that it becomes very abundant, at this\r\ntime feeding chiefly upon the large insects which swarm among the\r\nrank prairie herbage. Its particular food is a very large species of\r\n_Cicada_, though grasshoppers, and occasionally small snakes (as the\r\nspecies of _Eutænia_, _Leptophis æstivus_, etc.), also form part of its\r\nfood. Its prey is captured by sweeping over the object and picking it\r\nup in passing over, both the bill and feet being used in grasping it;\r\nthe food is eaten as the bird sails, in broad circles, overhead. Mr.\r\nRidgway describes the flight of this Kite as powerful and graceful in\r\nthe extreme, and accompanied by beautiful and unusual evolutions.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Audubon, the nest of this species is always placed in\r\nthe upper branches of the tallest trees. It resembles a dilapidated\r\nCrow’s nest, and is constructed of sticks slightly put together, Spanish\r\nmoss, strips of pine bark, and dry leaves. The eggs are three in number,\r\nnearly globular, and are described by Mr. Audubon as of a light greenish\r\ntint, blotched thickly over with deep chocolate-brown and black; but the\r\neggs thus described are those of some totally different species.\r\n\r\nThe same writer mentions that a pair of these Hawks, whose nest was\r\nvisited by a negro sailor, manifested the greatest displeasure, and\r\ncontinued flying with remarkable velocity close to the man’s head,\r\nscreaming, and displaying the utmost rage.\r\n\r\nThe description given by Mr. Audubon of the egg of this species, and\r\nalso that in my North American Oölogy, of the drawing of an egg said to\r\nbe of this bird, taken in Louisiana by Dr. Trudeau, do not correspond\r\nwith an egg in the cabinet of the Boston Society of Natural History,\r\nformerly in that of the late Dr. Henry Bryant. This egg measures 1.50\r\ninches in length by 1.32 in breadth, is very nearly globular, but is\r\nalso much more rounded at one end, and tapering at the other. It is\r\nentirely unspotted and of a uniform chalky whiteness, with an underlying\r\ntinge of a bluish green. It was found by Mr. C. S. McCarthy in the\r\nIndian Territory, on the north fork of the Canadian River, June 25,\r\n1861. The nest was made of a few sticks, and was in the fork of a\r\nhorizontal branch, fifteen feet from the ground. There were two eggs in\r\nthe nest.\r\n\r\nIt was also found breeding by Mr. J. H. Clark at Trout Creek, Indian\r\nTerritory, June 21, and by Dr. E. Palmer at the Kiowa Agency (S. I.\r\n13,534).\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ROSTRHAMUS, LESSON.\r\n\r\n  _Rostrhamus_, LESS. 1831.

The Black Kite is a Central and South American species, well\r\nknown in that section, but having no other claim to be regarded as\r\na bird of North America than its presence in a restricted portion\r\nof Florida, where it is, in the extreme southern section, not very\r\nuncommon, and where it is also known to breed. It was first taken in\r\nthat peninsula by Mr. Edward Harris, and subsequently by Dr. Heermann.\r\nIt was supposed by Mr. Harris to breed in Florida, from his meeting with\r\nyoung birds; and this supposition has been confirmed by Mr. Maynard, who\r\nhas since found them nesting, and procured their eggs.\r\n\r\nMr. Salvin met with what he presumed to be this species in Central\r\nAmerica, ascribing the immense flights of Hawks seen by him in the month\r\nof March, in the Pacific Coast region, migrating in a northwesterly\r\ndirection, to this Kite. The bird was well known to the Spaniards under\r\nthe name of _Asacuani_,—a term that has become proverbial for a person\r\nwho is constantly wandering from place to place. Mr. Leyland obtained\r\na single specimen of the _Rostrhamus_ near the Lake of Peten. In the\r\nspring of 1870, Mr. Maynard met with several individuals of this species\r\namong the Florida everglades. He first observed one on February 18,\r\nbut was not able to secure it. Visiting the same spot ten days later,\r\nwith Mr. Henshaw, three birds of this species were shot, and the nest\r\nof one was discovered. It was at that time only partly completed, was\r\nsmall, flat, and composed of sticks somewhat carelessly arranged. It was\r\nbuilt upon the top of some tall saw-grass, by which it was supported.\r\nThis grass was so luxuriant and thick that it bore Mr. Maynard up as he\r\nsought to reach the nest, which did not contain any eggs. On the 24th\r\nof March, Mr. Maynard discovered another nest of this species. It was\r\nbuilt in a bush of the _Magnolia glauca_, and was about four feet from\r\nthe water. It contained one egg. It was about one foot in diameter, was\r\nquite flat, and was composed of sticks carelessly arranged, and lined\r\nwith a few dry heads of the saw-grass. The female was shot, and found to\r\ncontain an egg nearly ready for exclusion, but as yet unspotted. Other\r\neggs were subsequently procured through the aid of Seminole Indians, by\r\nwhom this Hawk is called _So-for-funi-kar_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Rostrhamus sociabilis_ (young).]\r\n\r\nThe usual number of eggs laid by this Kite is supposed to be two, as\r\nin three instances no more were found, and this was said to be their\r\ncomplement by the Indians. It also appeared to be somewhat irregular in\r\nthe time of depositing its eggs.\r\n\r\nThis Hawk is described as very sociable in its habits, unlike, in\r\nthis respect, most other birds of prey. Six or eight specimens were\r\nfrequently seen flying together, at one time, over the marshes, or\r\nsitting in company on the same bush. In their flight they resemble the\r\ncommon Marsh Hawk, are very unsuspicious, and may be quite readily\r\napproached. The dissection of the specimens showed that this bird feeds\r\nlargely on a species of freshwater shell (_Pomus depressa_ of Say).\r\n\r\nThe egg of this species taken in Florida by Mr. Maynard is of a rounded\r\noval shape, equally obtuse at either end, and measures 1.70 inches\r\nin length by 1.45 in breadth. The ground-color is a dingy white,\r\nirregularly, and in some parts profusely, blotched with groups of\r\nmarkings of a yellowish brown, shading from a light olive-brown to a\r\nmuch duller color, almost to a black hue. These markings in the specimen\r\nseen are not grouped around either end, but form a confluent belt around\r\nthe central portions of the egg. The following description is given by\r\nMr. Maynard of the other specimens taken by him.\r\n\r\n_Egg No. 1._ Ground-color bluish-white, spotted and blotched everywhere\r\nwith brown and umber. Dimensions, 1.72 × 1.45. _No. 2._ Ground-color\r\nsame as No. 1. Two large irregular blotches of dark brown and umber\r\non the larger end, with smaller confluent blotches and streaks of the\r\nsame, covering nearly the entire surface of that end; smaller end much\r\nmore sparsely spotted with the same. Dimensions, 1.76 × 1.40. _No. 3._\r\nGround-color dirty brown. The entire egg, except the small end, covered\r\nwith a washing of dark brown, which forms dark irregular blotches at\r\nvarious points, as if the egg had been painted and then taken in the\r\nfingers before drying.

Form very slender, the wings and tail very long, the head\r\nsmall, bill weak, and feet slender. Face surrounded by a ruff of stiff,\r\ncompact feathers, as in the Owls (nearly obsolete in some species). Bill\r\nweak, much compressed; the upper outline of the cere greatly ascending\r\nbasally, and arched posteriorly, the commissure with a faint lobe;\r\nnostril oval, horizontal. Loral bristles fine and elongated, curving\r\nupwards, their ends reaching above the top of the cere. Superciliary\r\nshield small, but prominent. Tarsus more than twice the middle toe,\r\nslender, and with perfect frontal and posterior continuous series of\r\nregular transverse scutellæ; toes slender, the outer longer than the\r\ninner; claws strongly curved, very acute. Wings very long, the third or\r\nfourth quills longest; first shorter than the sixth; outer three to five\r\nwith inner webs sinuated. Tail very long, about two thirds the wing;\r\nrounded.\r\n\r\nThe relationships of this well-marked genus are, to _Accipiter_ on the\r\none hand, and _Elanus_ on the other; nearest the former, though it is\r\nnot very intimately allied to either. I cannot admit the subgenera\r\nproposed by various authors (see synonomy above), as I consider\r\nthe characters upon which they are based to be merely of specific\r\nimportance, scarcely two species being exactly alike in the minute\r\ndetails of their form.\r\n\r\nThe species are quite numerous, numbering about twenty, of which only\r\nabout four (including the climatic sub-species, or geographical races)\r\nare American. North America possesses but one (_C. hudsonius_, Linn.),\r\nand this, with the _C. cinereus_, Vieill., of South America, I consider\r\nto be a geographical race of _C. cyaneus_ of Europe.\r\n\r\nThe birds of this genus frequent open, generally marshy, localities,\r\nwhere they course over the meadows, moors, or marshes, with a steady,\r\ngliding flight, seldom flapping, in pursuit of their food, which\r\nconsists mainly of mice, small birds, and reptiles. Their assault upon\r\nthe latter is sudden and determined, like the “Swift Hawks,” or the\r\nspecies of _Accipiter_.\r\n\r\nIn the following synopsis, I include only the three forms of _C.\r\ncyaneus_, giving the characters of the European race along with those of\r\nthe two American ones.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecies and Races.\r\n\r\n  =C. cyaneus.= Wing, 12.50–16.00; tail, 9.00–10.70; culmen, .60–.80;\r\n  tarsus, 2.42–3.25; middle toe, 1.10–1.55.

The Marsh Hawk is one of the most widely distributed birds of\r\nNorth America, breeding from the fur regions around Hudson’s Bay to\r\nTexas, and from Nova Scotia to Oregon and California. It is abundant\r\neverywhere, excepting in the southeastern portion of the United States.\r\nSir John Richardson speaks of it as so common on the plains of the\r\nSaskatchewan that seldom less than five or six are in sight at a time\r\n(in latitude 55°). Mr. Townsend found it on the plains of the Columbia\r\nRiver and on the prairies bordering on the Missouri. The Vincennes\r\nExploring Expedition obtained specimens in Oregon. Dr. Gambel and Dr.\r\nHeermann found it abundant in California. Dr. Suckley’s party obtained\r\nspecimens in Minnesota; Captain Beckwith’s, in Utah; Captain Pope,\r\nLieutenant Whipple, and Dr. Henry, in New Mexico; and Lieutenant Couch,\r\nin Tamaulipas, Mexico. Dr. Woodhouse met with it abundantly from the\r\nMississippi River to the Pacific Ocean, throughout the summer, showing\r\nconclusively that it breeds in those different sections of country. De\r\nla Sagra, Lembeye, and Dr. Gundlach, all give it as a bird of Cuba, but\r\nnot as breeding there.\r\n\r\nDall records it as very rare on the Yukon, and an occasional summer\r\nvisitor only at St. Michael’s, where an individual was killed as late\r\nas November. Donald Gunn states that it makes its appearance in the\r\nfur countries about the opening of the rivers, and departs about the\r\nbeginning of November. It preys upon small birds and mice, is very slow\r\non the wing, flies very low, and in a manner very different from all\r\nother kinds of Hawks.\r\n\r\nIn Nova Scotia it is very abundant, and is very destructive of young\r\ngame. Mr. Downes regards it as an indiscriminating feeder upon fish,\r\nsnakes, and even worms. He took two green snakes from the stomach of one\r\nof them.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Circus hudsonius_ (male and female).]\r\n\r\nMr. Dresser found them abundant throughout the whole country east of\r\nthe Rio Nueces at all seasons of the year. They were more abundant in\r\nfull blue plumage than elsewhere. Near San Antonio he met with them on\r\nthe prairies, where they feed on the small green lizards which abound\r\nthere, and which they are very expert in catching. Dr. Coues mentions\r\nthem as very abundant in Arizona. Dr. Kennerly met with them on both\r\nsides of the Rio Grande wherever there was a marsh of any extent. Flying\r\nnear the surface, just above the weeds and canes, they round their\r\nuntiring circles hour after hour, darting after small birds as they rise\r\nfrom cover. Pressed by hunger, they will attack even wild Ducks. Dr.\r\nKennerly also observed them equally abundant in the same localities in\r\nNew Mexico. Dr. Newberry mentions finding this Hawk abundant beyond all\r\nparallel on the plains of Upper Pitt River. He saw several hundred in a\r\nsingle day’s march.\r\n\r\nIn Washington Territory both Dr. Suckley and Dr. Cooper found this Hawk\r\nabundant throughout the open districts, and especially so in winter. Dr.\r\nCooper found it no less common in California, and among several hundreds\r\nsaw but two birds in the blue plumage. Near Fort Laramie he found it no\r\nless common, but there, at least one half were in the blue plumage. From\r\nthis he infers that the older birds seek the far interior in preference\r\nto the seaboard.\r\n\r\nMr. Allen mentions it as common in winter about the savannas in Florida,\r\nand Mr. Salvin states that it is a migratory species in Guatemala. It\r\noccurred in the Pacific Coast Region, and examples were also received\r\nfrom Vera Paz.\r\n\r\nIn evidence of the nomadic character of the Marsh Hawk it may be\r\nmentioned that specimens asserted to be of this species are in the\r\nLeyden Museum that were received from the Philippines and from\r\nKamtschatka.\r\n\r\nIn Wilson’s time this Hawk was quite numerous in the marshes of New\r\nJersey, Pennsylvania, and Delaware, where it swept over the low grounds,\r\nsailing near the earth, in search of a kind of mouse very common in\r\nsuch situations, and was there very generally known as the Mouse Hawk.\r\nIt is also said to be very serviceable in the Southern rice-fields in\r\ninterrupting the devastations made by the swarms of Bobolinks. As it\r\nsails low and swiftly over the fields, it keeps the flocks in perpetual\r\nfluctuation, and greatly interrupts their depredations. Wilson states\r\nthat one Marsh Hawk was considered by the planters equal to several\r\nnegroes for alarming the Rice-birds. Audubon, however, controverts this\r\nstatement, and quotes Dr. Bachman to the effect that no Marsh Hawks are\r\nseen in the rice-fields until after the Bobolinks are gone. Dr. Coues,\r\non the other hand, gives this Hawk as resident throughout the year in\r\nSouth Carolina.\r\n\r\nAccording to Audubon, the Marsh Hawk rarely pursues birds on the wing,\r\nnor does it often carry its prey to any distance before it alights and\r\ndevours it. While engaged in feeding, it may be readily approached,\r\nsurprised, and shot. When wounded, it endeavors to make off by long\r\nleaps; and when overtaken, it throws itself on the back and fights\r\nfuriously. In winter its notes while on the wing are sharp, and are said\r\nto resemble the syllables _pee-pee-pee_. The love-notes are similar to\r\nthose of the _columbarius_.\r\n\r\nMr. Audubon has found this Hawk nesting not only in lowlands near\r\nthe sea-shore, but also in the barrens of Kentucky and on the\r\ncleared table-lands of the Alleghanies, and once in the high covered\r\npine-barrens of Florida.\r\n\r\nAfter having paired, the Marsh Hawks invariably keep together, and labor\r\nconjointly in the construction of the nest, in sitting upon the eggs,\r\nand in feeding the young. Their nests are variously constructed as to\r\nmaterials, usually chiefly of hay somewhat clumsily wrought together\r\ninto the form of a nest, but never very nicely interwoven; occasionally,\r\nin more northern localities, they are lined with feathers, in some cases\r\nwith pine-needles and small twigs.\r\n\r\nRichardson states that all the nests of this Hawk observed by him\r\nwere built on the ground by the side of small lakes, of moss, grass,\r\nfeathers, and hair, and contained from three to five eggs, of a\r\nbluish-white color, and unspotted. The latter measured 1.75 inches in\r\nlength, and were an inch across where widest. The position and manner of\r\nconstructing the nest correspond with my own experience, but the size of\r\nthe eggs does not. The nests have been invariably on the ground, near\r\nwater, built of dry grass, and lined with softer materials.\r\n\r\nMr. Audubon gives a very minute account of a nest which he found on\r\nGalveston Island, Texas. It was about a hundred yards from a pond, on\r\na ridge just raised above the marsh, and was made of dry grass; the\r\ninternal diameter was eight, and the external twelve inches, with the\r\ndepth of two and a half. No feathers were found. This absence of a warm\r\nlining in Texas really proves nothing. A warm lining may be required in\r\nlatitude 65° north, and the same necessity not found in one of 29°. A\r\nnest observed in Concord, Mass., by Dr. H. R Storer, was on the edge of\r\na pond, and was warmly lined with feathers and fine grasses. Many other\r\ninstances might be named.\r\n\r\nThe eggs found in the Galveston nest were four in number, smooth,\r\nconsiderably rounded or broadly elliptical, bluish-white, 1.75 inches\r\nin length, and 1.25 in breadth. Another nest, found under a low bush\r\non the Alleghanies, was constructed in a similar manner, but was more\r\nbulky; the bed being four inches above the earth, and the egg slightly\r\nsprinkled with small marks of pale reddish-brown.\r\n\r\nThe prevalent impression that the eggs of this Hawk are generally\r\nunspotted, so far as I am aware, is not correct. All that I have ever\r\nseen, except the eggs above referred to from Texas, and a few others,\r\nhave been more or less marked with light-brown blotches. These markings\r\nare not always very distinct, but, as far as my present experience goes,\r\nthey are to be found, if carefully sought. In 1856 I received from Dr.\r\nDixon, of Damariscotta, a nest with six eggs of a Hawk of this species.\r\nThe female had been shot as she flew from the nest. With a single\r\nexception, all the eggs were very distinctly blotched and spotted. In\r\nshape they were of a rather oblong-oval, rounded at both ends, the\r\nsmaller end well defined. They varied in length from 2.00 to 1.87\r\ninches, and in breadth from 1.44 to 1.38 inches. Their ground-color was\r\na dirty bluish-white, which in one was nearly unspotted, the markings so\r\nfaint as to be hardly perceptible, and only upon a close inspection. In\r\nall the others, spots and blotches of a light shade of purplish-brown\r\noccured, in a greater or less degree, over their entire surface. In two,\r\nthe blotches were large and well marked; in the others, less strongly\r\ntraced, but quite distinct.\r\n\r\nThe nest was found in a tract of low land, covered with clumps of sedge,\r\non one of which it had been constructed. It is described as about the\r\nsize of a peck basket, circular, and composed entirely of small dry\r\nsticks, “finished off or topped out with small bunches of pine boughs.”\r\nThere was very little depth to the nest, or not enough to cover the\r\neggs from view in taking a sight across it. “No feathers were found in\r\nor about it. It was simply made of small dry sticks, about six inches\r\nthick, with about one inch of pine boughs for finishing off the nest.”\r\nThe eggs were found about the 20th of May. They contained young at least\r\ntwo weeks advanced, showing that the bird began to lay in the latter\r\npart of April, and to sit upon her eggs early in the following month.\r\n\r\nIt will be thus seen that the eggs of this Hawk vary greatly in size and\r\nshape, and in the presence or absence of marking, varying in length from\r\n1.75 to 2.00 inches, and in breadth from 1.25 to 1.50, and in shape from\r\nan almost globular egg to an elongated oval. Some are wholly spotless,\r\nand others are very strongly and generally blotched with well-defined\r\npurplish-brown.\r\n\r\nThis Hawk was found breeding in the Humboldt Valley by Mr. C. S.\r\nM‘Carthy, on the Yellowstone by Mr. Hayden, at Fort Benton by Lieutenant\r\nMullan, at Fort Resolution by Mr. Kennicott, at Fort Rae and at Fort\r\nSimpson by Mr. Ross, at La Pierre House by Lockhart, and on the Lower\r\nAnderson by Mr. MacFarlane.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS NISUS, CUVIER.\r\n\r\n  _Accipiter_, BRISS. 1760.

That too many\r\ngenera and subgenera have been recognized is my final conclusion, after\r\ncritically examining and comparing forty of the fifty-seven species of\r\nGray’s catalogue (Hand List of Birds, I, 1869, pp. 29–35). The variation\r\nof almost every character ranges between great extremes; but when all\r\nthe species are compared, it is found that, taking each character\r\nseparately, they do not all correspond, and cross and re-cross each\r\nother in the series in such a manner that it is almost impossible to\r\narrange the species into well-defined groups. From this genus I exclude\r\n_Lophospiza_, Kaup (type, _L. trivirgatus_); _Asturina_, Vieill. (type,\r\n_A. nitida_); _Rupornis_, Kaup (type, _R. magnirostris_); _Buteola_,\r\nDubus (= _Buteo_, type, _B. brachyura_, Vieill.); included by Gray under\r\n_Astur_, as subgenera, and _Tachyspiza_, Kaup (type, _T. soloensis_);\r\nand _Scelospiza_, Kaup (type, _S. francesii_); which are given by\r\nGray as subgenera of _Micronisus_, Gray (type, _Accipiter gabar_),\r\nthe species of the typical subgenus of which, as arranged in Gray’s\r\nHand List, I refer to _Nisus_. All these excluded names I consider as\r\nrepresenting distinct genera.\r\n\r\nThe species of this genus are noted for their very predatory\r\ndisposition, exceeding the Falcons in their daring, and in the quickness\r\nof their assault upon their prey, which consists chiefly of small birds.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBGENUS NISUS, CUVIER.\r\n\r\n  _Accipiter_, BRISSON, 1760.[81]\r\n  _Nisus_, CUVIER, 1799.

The largest\r\nare 4,198, ♀, San Francisco, Cal., winter, 16,957, ♀, Hudson’s Bay\r\nTerritory, and 55,016, ♀, Mazatlan, Mexico, in which the wing ranges\r\nfrom 8.40 to 8.50, the tail 7.00. The smallest females are 45,826,\r\nSitka, Alaska, and 11,791, Simiahmoo, W. T., in which the wing measures\r\nabout 7.80. A female (32,499) from Orizaba, Mexico, one (8,513) from\r\nFort Yuma, Cal., and one (17,210) from San Nicholas, Lower California,\r\nhave the wing 8.00, which is about the average. The largest males are\r\n54,336, Nulato, Alaska, 58,137, Kodiak, Alaska, 27,067, Yukon, mouth\r\nof Porcupine, and 55,017, Mazatlan, Mexico, in which the wing measures\r\n7.00, the tail 5.60. The smallest males are 5,990, Orange, N. J.,\r\n8,514, Shoalwater Bay, W. T., 21,338, Siskiyou Co., Cal., 37,428,\r\nOrizaba, Mexico, and 5,584, Bridger’s Pass, Utah; in this series the\r\nwing measures 6.50–6.70, the tail 5.40–5.60. A specimen from Costa\r\nRica measures: wing 6.70, tail 5.35. Thus the variation in size will\r\nbe seen to be an individual difference, rather than characteristic of\r\nany region. Some immature specimens from the northwest coast of North\r\nAmerica (as 45,828, ♂, Sitka, Rus. Am., 5,845, ♂, Fort Steilacoom,\r\nW. T., 11,791, Simiahmoo, Puget Sound, and 8,514, Shoalwater Bay,\r\nW. T.) are much darker than others, the brown above inclining to\r\nblackish-sepia; no other differences, however, are observable. An adult\r\nfrom the Yukon (54,337, ♀) has the rufous bars beneath remarkably faint,\r\nalthough well defined; another (19,384, ♀, Fort Resolution), in immature\r\nplumage, has the longitudinal markings beneath so faint that they are\r\nscarcely discernible, and the plumage generally has a very worn and\r\nfaded appearance. A male in fine plumage (10,759, Fort Bridger, Utah)\r\nhas the delicate reddish-rufous beneath so extended as to prevail, and\r\nwith scarcely any variegation on the sides and tibiæ; the bars on the\r\ntail, also, are quite obsolete.\r\n\r\nHABITS. This species is one of the most common Hawks of North America,\r\nand its geographical range covers the entire continent, from Hudson’s\r\nBay to Mexico. Sir John Richardson mentions its having been met with\r\nas far to the north as latitude 51°. Drs. Gambel and Heermann, and\r\nothers, speak of it as abundant throughout California. Audubon found it\r\nvery plentiful as far north as the southern shore of the Gulf of St.\r\nLawrence. It has been obtained in New Mexico by Mr. McCall, in Mexico\r\nby Mr. Pease, in Washington Territory by Dr. Cooper and Dr. Suckley,\r\nin Alaska by Mr. Dall, at Fort Resolution by Mr. Kennicott, at Fort\r\nSimpson by Mr. B. R. Ross, etc. Messrs. Sclater and Salvin give it\r\nas a rare visitant of Guatemala. It has been ascertained to breed in\r\nMassachusetts, New Jersey, Wisconsin, California, and Pennsylvania, and\r\nit probably does so not only in the intervening States and Territories,\r\nbut also in all, not excepting the most southern, Florida, where its\r\nnest was found by Mr. Wurdemann.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Nisus fuscus._]\r\n\r\nDr. Woodhouse, who frequently observed this bird skimming over the\r\nprairies while in search of its prey, states that its flight is so\r\npeculiar that there is no difficulty in recognizing it, when taken in\r\nconnection with its form, short wings, and long tail, being very swift\r\nand irregular in its movements, first high in the air, then close to the\r\nground, suddenly disappearing among the grass when it has seized the\r\nobject of which it was in pursuit.\r\n\r\nMr. Dresser met with this Hawk in Texas, but nowhere south or west of\r\nSan Antonio, where it remains through the breeding-season, nesting in\r\nthe dense cedar-thickets.\r\n\r\nMr. Audubon regarded it as the very miniature of the Goshawk, in its\r\nirregular, swift, vigorous, varied, and yet often undecided, manner of\r\nflight, and on occasion greatly protracted. When in search of its prey,\r\nit is said to pass over the country, now at a moderate height, now close\r\nover the land, and with a surprising swiftness. It advances by sudden\r\ndashes, and pounces upon the object of its pursuit so suddenly as to\r\nrender hopeless any attempt to escape. It has frequently been known\r\nto seize and kill a bird so large that it was unable to carry it, and\r\nhad to drop to the ground with it. In one instance Mr. Audubon saw it\r\nstrike a Brown Thrush, which it had darted into a thicket of briers to\r\nseize, emerging at the opposite side. As Mr. Audubon ran up, the Hawk\r\nattempted twice to rise with its prey, but was unable to carry it off,\r\nand relinquished it. The Thrush was quite dead, and had evidently been\r\nkilled instantly.\r\n\r\nMr. Downes, of Halifax, who speaks of this Hawk as common in Nova\r\nScotia, breeding all over that province, adds that it does not molest\r\nthe poultry-yards, being too weak to attack large prey. But this is not\r\nuniversally the case. They are frequently destructive both to dove-cots\r\nand to the younger inhabitants of the poultry-yard. Mr. Nuttall narrates\r\nthat in the thinly settled parts of Alabama and Georgia it seemed to\r\nabound, and was very destructive to young chickens, a single one having\r\nbeen known to come regularly every day until it had carried off twenty\r\nor thirty. He was eyewitness to one of its acts of robbery, where, at\r\nnoonday and in the near presence of the farmer, the Hawk descended and\r\ncarried off one of the chickens. In another instance the same writer\r\nmentions that one of these Hawks, descending with blind eagerness upon\r\nits prey, broke through the glass of the greenhouse at the Cambridge\r\nBotanic Garden, fearlessly passed through a second glass partition, and\r\nwas only brought up by a third, when it was caught, though very little\r\ninjured.\r\n\r\nAt times this Hawk is seen to fly high, in a desultory manner, with\r\nquick but irregular movements of the wings, now moving in short and\r\nunequal circles, pausing to examine the objects below, and then again\r\ndescending rapidly and following a course only a few feet from the\r\nground, carefully examining each patch of small bushes in search of\r\nsmall birds.\r\n\r\nBesides the smaller birds, young chickens, and pigeons, this Hawk has\r\nbeen known to occasionally feed on small reptiles and insects, as also\r\nupon the smaller quadrupeds.\r\n\r\nMr. Audubon speaks of having met with three nests of this species,\r\nand all in different situations. One was in a hole in a rock on the\r\nbanks of the Ohio River; another was in the hollow of a broken branch,\r\nnear Louisville, Ky., and the third in the forks of a low oak, near\r\nHenderson, Ky. In the first case, the nest was slight, and simply\r\nconstructed of a few sticks and some grasses, carelessly interwoven, and\r\nabout two feet from the entrance of the hole. In the second instance\r\nthere was no nest whatever, but in the third the birds were engaged\r\nin the construction of an elaborate nest. The number of the eggs was\r\nfour in one instance, and five in another. He describes them as almost\r\nequally rounded at both ends; their ground-color white, with a livid\r\ntinge, but scarcely discernible amid the numerous markings and blotches\r\nof reddish-chocolate with which they were irregularly covered. In\r\na nest which was large and elaborately constructed of sticks, and\r\ncontained five eggs, found by Dr. H. R. Storer in Concord, Mass.,\r\nthere was a single egg which nearly corresponds with this description.\r\nIt is, however, the only one among many specimens that at all agrees\r\nwith it. This specimen is a little more than usually elongate, and its\r\nground-color, which is a purplish-white, is nearly concealed by its\r\nblotches of various shades of sepia-brown. In every other instance the\r\negg is very nearly spherical, the ground-color white, and beautifully\r\nmarked with large confluent blotches of sepia, varying in depth from\r\nquite a light to a very dark shade. In one, these confluent markings\r\nform a broad belt around the centre of the egg. In others, they are\r\nchiefly distributed about the larger end. The contrast between the white\r\nground and the dark confluent dashes of brown is very striking. Except\r\nin size, the eggs of this bird bear a marked resemblance to those of the\r\nSparrow Hawk of Europe. In a few instances, the brown markings have an\r\nintermixture of red and purple. The egg measures 1.35 by 1.15 inches.\r\n\r\nIn nearly every instance the nest of this Hawk has been constructed in\r\ntrees. It is usually large in proportion to the size of the bird, and\r\nits materials are somewhat elaborately put together; it is composed\r\nchiefly of large sticks and twigs, and the whole platform is covered\r\nwith a thin lining of dry leaves, mosses, grass, etc. Mr. John Krider,\r\nof Philadelphia, found a nest in New Jersey, in the vicinity of that\r\ncity, which was built on the edge of a high rock.\r\n\r\nMr. Robert Kennicott met with the nest of this species at Fort\r\nResolution. It was composed entirely of small dry spruce twigs, with the\r\nexception of a half-dozen small flat bits of the scaly outer bark of the\r\nspruce, laid in the bottom, and forming a sort of lining. No feathers or\r\nother softer materials were used. The nest was shallow and broad. The\r\nbase was about eighteen inches in diameter, and was about eight feet\r\nfrom the ground. It was in a small spruce in a thick wood and on high\r\nground. When disturbed, the female flew off a short distance; but on Mr.\r\nKennicott’s hiding himself returned and flew near the nest, continually\r\nuttering a harsh rapid note. Near the nest were marks indicating the\r\nplace where the male passed the nights perched on a dry stick near the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nMr. B. R. Ross observed these birds nesting thickly along the cliffs of\r\nthe Upper Slave River. They were more rare northward of Fort Simpson\r\nthan _F. columbarius_.\r\n\r\nMr. William Street, of Easthampton, informs me that he has found this\r\nHawk nesting on Mount Tom, where he has known of six of their nests in\r\none season. In the spring of 1872 he found three nests, on the 24th\r\nand 25th of May. They contained two eggs each. One of these, on the\r\n27th contained three eggs, of which he took one; on the 3d of June two\r\nmore eggs had been laid. Two of these were taken, after which the birds\r\ndeserted the nest and resorted to an old squirrel’s nest, where they had\r\nfour more eggs, depositing one every third day. They arrive at Mount Tom\r\nabout the 1st of May. Their nests are made entirely of sticks, larger on\r\nthe outside, and smaller within. They usually build in a hemlock-tree,\r\nselecting a thick clump. They are very noisy when they are at work\r\nbuilding their nest, and often betray their presence by their cries.\r\nThe younger the pair the more noisy they are. This Hawk appears to live\r\nnearly altogether on small birds. Mr. Street mentions having found ten\r\nor twelve skeletons in a single nest of this species.\r\n\r\n\r\nNisus cooperi (BONAP.).\r\n\r\n=Var. cooperi=, BONAP.\r\n\r\nCOOPER’S HAWK.\r\n\r\n  _Falco cooperi_, BONAP.

This common Hawk appears to have a very general distribution\r\nover the United States, from South Carolina to New Brunswick, on the\r\nAtlantic; from Texas, New Mexico, and Arizona, in the interior, to the\r\nSaskatchewan, and from Southern California to Washington Territory, on\r\nthe Pacific. Mr. Boardman mentions it as found near Calais, but rare.\r\nMr. Verrill cites it as occurring in Western Maine, but not common.\r\nI have received its eggs from South Carolina, where it is resident\r\nthroughout the year. Mr. Dresser met with it not uncommon near San\r\nAntonio, and found it breeding on the Altascosa and Medina Rivers. Dr.\r\nCoues says it is generally distributed throughout the Territory of\r\nArizona. Dr. Newberry found it common about San Francisco, and extending\r\nnorth of the Columbia River. Mr. A. Schott obtained a specimen on the\r\nColorado River in Southern California, and Dr. Gambel and Dr. A. L.\r\nHeermann speak of it as common throughout that State, while Dr. Cooper\r\nand Dr. Suckley mention it as frequent both in Oregon and in Washington\r\nTerritory. A single specimen was taken by Mr. Salvin in Guatemala. Dr.\r\nCooper states that this Hawk is often killed about the farm-yards of\r\nWashington Territory, where it seizes on chickens before the very eyes\r\nof the owner, darting down like lightning, and disappearing again before\r\nhe can see what has caused the disturbance. It is said to be a constant\r\nresident, and to breed within the Territory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Nisus cooperi._]\r\n\r\nMr. Audubon describes the flight of this Hawk as rapid, protracted, and\r\neven, and as performed at a short distance from the ground, or over the\r\nforest. It is said to move along in a silent gliding manner, and with\r\na swiftness even superior to that of the Wild Pigeon, rarely deviating\r\nfrom a straight course except to seize its prey, and seldom mounting\r\nin the air in circles. It is very bold and daring, Mr. Audubon having\r\nknown one to attack and kill a cock much larger and heavier than itself.\r\nIt frequently attacks and kills the common Ruffed Grouse. It breeds in\r\nespecial abundance in the Middle States, and particularly along the\r\nbanks of the Potomac River. I have received reliable information of its\r\nnesting in Vermont, Massachusetts, Ohio, Illinois, Wisconsin, Maryland,\r\nVirginia, and South Carolina, and probably nearly all of the States. Mr.\r\nGosse did not meet with it in Jamaica.\r\n\r\nMr. Audubon states that he found its nest usually placed in the forks of\r\nthe branch of an oak-tree, towards its extremity. In general appearance\r\nit resembles that of the common Crow, being composed externally of\r\nnumerous crooked sticks, and having a slight lining of grasses and\r\na few feathers. The eggs he describes as three or four in number,\r\nalmost globular, large for the size of the bird, of a dull white color,\r\ngranulated and rough to the touch.\r\n\r\nDr. Hoy, in a communication to the Boston Natural History Society,\r\nmentions finding four nests of this Hawk in a single season, and his\r\ncareful observations of the habits of the parent birds enabled him to\r\nascertain that in each instance the birds began to sit constantly upon\r\ntheir nest as soon as a single egg had been deposited, and that, as a\r\nconsequence, the eggs having been deposited at varying intervals, each\r\none was found in a different stage of incubation from the other. In not\r\na single instance did he visit a nest without finding the parent bird\r\noccupying it.\r\n\r\nThese nests were all composed of sticks, rudely lined with strips of\r\nbark and a few bunches of _Usnea barbata_. The nests were quite shallow\r\nand small for a Hawk. Most of the eggs were sparingly sprinkled with\r\number-brown. One set of these eggs was blotched with bluish-green,\r\nwhich soon faded out. While the nests were being molested, the parent\r\nHawk would fly from tree to tree, uttering, in rapid succession,\r\n_quick-quick-quick-quick_.\r\n\r\nDr. Hoy states that the male of this species, during the nesting-season,\r\nmay frequently be seen flying high in the air, sporting, vaulting, and\r\nturning somersaults on the wing, which habit has given to it the name\r\nof Tumbler-Hawk. No Hawk is harder to shoot, and none commits greater\r\nhavoc among barn-yard fowls than this species. He has seen one strike a\r\nlarge hen while she was flying wildly for safety, and kill her on the\r\nspot, though it was obliged to abandon the game, as it proved too heavy\r\nto carry off.\r\n\r\nI have specimens of its eggs from South Carolina, obtained by the\r\nyoung sons of Rev. M. A. Curtis, of Society Hill. Mr. Curtis, Sen.,\r\nfurnished me with the following description of its nest: “The nest of\r\nthe Cooper’s Hawk was built in the triple fork of a tall black gum\r\n(_Nyssa multiflora_), near the top of the tree, which stood in a swamp.\r\nIt was formed of a layer of small sticks, ⅓ to ½ inch in diameter. Its\r\nexternal diameter varied from 1½ to 2 feet. This layer was ⅞ of an inch\r\nin thickness, with only a slight depression in the centre, hardly enough\r\nto keep the eggs from rolling out. A few thin pieces of pine bark formed\r\nthe bed for the eggs.”\r\n\r\nAnother nest, obtained in Randolph, Vt., by Charles S. Paine, Esq.,\r\nis thus described by him: “The nest was built of hemlock twigs, and\r\nlined with small, thin pieces of hemlock bark, such as hang loosely on\r\nthe tree. The Hawk, when the nest was approached, did not whistle, as\r\nsome others of that family do, but uttered a cry of _ge! ge! ge! ge!_\r\nThis was repeated several times, with great rapidity, by both male and\r\nfemale.”\r\n\r\nThe average size of the eggs of this bird is 1.56 by 1.94 inches. The\r\ncolor is usually a uniform dull white, but is occasionally tinged with\r\nas light bluish shade. They are nearly spherical, though not more so\r\nthan the eggs of several species, and are equal at either end. Their\r\nsurface is slightly granulated. The number of the eggs varies from three\r\nto four, though occasionally there are five in a nest.\r\n\r\nThe maximum length of the egg of this species is 2.00 inches, the\r\nminimum 1.85; the maximum breadth 1.60, the minimum 1.50 inches. In\r\noccasional instances I have known the eggs of this species more or less\r\ndistinctly marked, especially about the larger end, with blotches of a\r\nlight yellowish-brown. Those most distinctly marked in this manner were\r\ntaken and identified by Mr. Paine.\r\n\r\nA nest of this Hawk, found by Dr. J. W. Velie, was built on a\r\npoplar-tree, about forty feet from the ground, and was composed of\r\nsticks and lined with moss and leaves. There was a small cleared space\r\nof three or four rods in extent, in the middle of which the tree stood,\r\nand about a quarter of a mile from the main channel of the Mississippi\r\nRiver, on Rock Island.\r\n\r\nThe Cooper Hawk was found on Mount Tom by Mr. William Street, nesting\r\nfor the most part in pine or hemlock trees, usually choosing one in\r\na thick clump. They begin to lay about the first of May, usually\r\ndepositing four eggs. They are very shy, and it is almost impossible to\r\nget within shot of them, even when they have young. They rarely molest\r\nthe poultry-yard, but seem to live chiefly on small birds and animals.\r\nThey leave their nest at once whenever it is approached, and will not\r\nreturn until the intruder has gone.\r\n\r\nThe var. _mexicanus_, originally described by Mr. Swainson from Mexican\r\nspecimens obtained near Real del Monte, has been ascertained to cross\r\nour boundaries, and is found in all the territory between the Rocky\r\nMountains and the Pacific, as far north as Washington Territory. Dr.\r\nCooper has never met with this Hawk, but supposes its general habits,\r\nand especially those regulating its migrations, closely resemble those\r\nof _A. cooperi_, to which the bird itself, in all but size, is so\r\nsimilar. Dr. Coues speaks of it as a common resident species in Arizona.\r\nHe states that he has seen young birds of this species, reared by the\r\nhand from the nest, become so thoroughly domesticated as to come to\r\ntheir master on being whistled for, and perch on his shoulder, or follow\r\nhim when shooting small birds for their food. They were allowed their\r\nentire liberty. Their ordinary note was a shrill and harsh scream. A\r\nlow, plaintive, lisping whistle was indicative of hunger.\r\n\r\nDr. Suckley, who met with this bird on Puget Sound, where a specimen was\r\nshot on a salt marsh, states that, while soaring about, it resembled in\r\nits motions the common Marsh Hawk, or Hen Harrier (_Circus hudsonius_).\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBGENUS ASTUR, LACEPEDE.\r\n\r\n  _Astur_, LACÉP. 1800.

Wing-formula,\r\n4, 5, 3–6, 2–7–8–9–10=1. Wing, 13.00; tail, 10.80; tarsus, 2.80; middle\r\ntoe, 1.80.\r\n\r\n_Young female_ (first year, No. 49,662, Calais, Me.; G. A. Boardman).\r\nDiffers from the female in the second year (No. 26,921) as follows: On\r\nthe wings and upper tail-coverts the yellowish-white spots are less\r\nconcealed, or, in fact, this forms the ground-color; secondary coverts\r\nochraceous-white, with two very distant transverse spots of dark brown,\r\nrather narrower than the white spaces; tips of feathers broadly white;\r\nsecondaries grayish-brown, tipped with white, more mottled with the\r\nsame toward bases, and crossed by five bands of dark brown, the first\r\ntwo of which are concealed by the coverts, the last quite a distance\r\nfrom the end of the feathers; upper tail-coverts white, mottled on\r\ninner webs with brown, each with two transverse broad bars, and a\r\nsubterminal cordate spot of dark brown, the last not touching the edge\r\nof the feather, and the anterior bars both concealed by the overlaying\r\nfeather. Tail grayish-brown, tipped with white, and with six bands\r\nof blackish-brown; these bordered with white as in the older stage.\r\nMarkings beneath as in the older stage, but those on the sides more\r\ncordate. Wing-formula, 4, 5, 3–6–7–2–8–9, 1, 10. Wing, 14.00; tail,\r\n11.50.\r\n\r\nIn regard to the form indicated in the above descriptions as “var.\r\n_striatulus_, Ridgway,” I am as yet undecided whether to recognize it\r\nas a geographical race, or to merely consider the two adult plumages as\r\nrepresenting different ages of the same form. Certain it is that there\r\nis a decided difference in the young plumage, between the birds of this\r\nspecies from the eastern portion of North America and those from the\r\nwestern regions; these differences consisting in the very much darker\r\ncolors of the western individuals, as shown by the above descriptions.\r\nMy first impression in regard to the adult dress, after making the\r\nfirst critical examination of the series at my command, was, that the\r\ncoarsely mottled specimens were confined to the east, and that those\r\nfinely mottled beneath were peculiar to the west; and this view I am not\r\nyet prepared to yield. I have never seen an adult bird from any western\r\nlocality which agrees with the eastern ones described above; all partake\r\nof the same characters as those described, in being finely and faintly\r\nmottled beneath, with sharp black shaft-streaks, producing the effect\r\nof a nearly uniform bluish ground, the black streaks in conspicuous\r\ncontrast, the tail-bands nearly obsolete, etc. But occasional, not\r\nto say frequent, individuals obtained in the eastern States, which\r\nagree in these respects with the western style, rather disfavor the\r\nview that these differences are regional, unless we consider that\r\nthese troublesome individuals, being, of course, winter migrants, have\r\nstrayed eastward from the countries where they were bred. The Colorado\r\nfemale described above exhibits a rather suspicious feature in having a\r\nsingle feather, on the lower parts, which is coarsely barred, as in the\r\neastern style, while all the rest are finely waved and marbled as in\r\nthe western. If this would suggest that the differences supposed to be\r\nclimatic or geographical are in reality only dependent on age, it would\r\nalso indicate that the finely mottled individuals are the older ones.\r\n\r\nIf future investigations should substantiate this suggestion as to the\r\nexistence of an eastern and a western race of Goshawk in North America,\r\nthey would be distinguished by the following characters:—\r\n\r\n  Var. =atricapillus=. _Adult._ Markings of the lower surface coarse and\r\n  ragged; feathers of the pectoral region with broad medial longitudinal\r\n  streaks of the same slaty tint as the transverse bars, and with only\r\n  the shafts black. Tail-bands distinct. _Young._ Pale ochraceous\r\n  markings prevailing in extent over the darker (clear grayish-umber)\r\n  spotting. Stripes beneath narrow, clear brownish; those on the flanks\r\n  linear. Wing, 12.25–14.25; tail, 10.00–12.75; culmen, .80–1.00;\r\n  tarsus, 2.90–3.15; middle toe, 1.70–1.95. _Hab._ Eastern region of\r\n  North America.\r\n\r\n  Var. =striatulus=. _Adult._ Markings of the lower parts fine and\r\n  delicate, and so dense as to present the appearance of a nearly\r\n  uniform bluish-ashy surface; feathers of the pectoral region without\r\n  the medial stripes of slaty, but with broad shaft-streaks of deep\r\n  black, contrasting very conspicuously with the finely mottled general\r\n  surface. Tail-bands obsolete. _Young._ Darker (brownish-black)\r\n  markings prevailing in extent over the lighter (nearly clear white)\r\n  ones. Stripes beneath broad, brownish-black; those on the flanks\r\n  cordate and transverse. Wing, 12.00–13.60; tail, 9.50–12.20; culmen,\r\n  .85–1.00; tarsus, 2.70–3.15; middle toe, 1.70–.185. _Hab._ Western\r\n  region of North America.\r\n\r\n\r\nLIST OF SPECIMENS EXAMINED.\r\n\r\nVar. _atricapillus_.\r\n\r\nNational Museum, 8; Philadelphia Academy, 7; New York Museum, 3; Boston\r\nSociety, 2; G.

The dreaded Blue Hen Hawk, as our Goshawk is usually called in\r\nNew England, is a bird of somewhat irregular occurrence south of the\r\n44th parallel. It occurs in the vicinity of Boston from November to\r\nMarch, but is never very common. In other parts of the State it is at\r\ntimes not uncommon at this season. It is common throughout Nova Scotia,\r\nNew Brunswick, and Northern Maine, and may undoubtedly be found breeding\r\nin the northern portions of New Hampshire, Vermont, and New York. In the\r\nsummer of 1872, Mr. George Baxter, of Danville, Vt., procured a nest\r\ncontaining three young birds, which were sent to the New York Central\r\nPark. Mr. Downes speaks of it as “far too common” in the vicinity of\r\nHalifax, where it is very destructive to Ducks, Pigeons, and poultry.\r\nMr. Boardman gives it as common near Calais, where it breeds, and where\r\nhe has taken its eggs. Mr. Verrill mentions it as resident in Western\r\nMaine, where it is one of the most common Hawks. Mr. Allen found it\r\nusually rare near Springfield, but remarkably common during the winter\r\nof 1859–60. He afterwards mentions that since then, and for the last ten\r\nwinters, he has known them to be quite common during several seasons.\r\nMr. C. J. Maynard is confident that this species occasionally breed\r\nin Massachusetts. He once observed a pair at a locality in Weston,\r\nuntil the latter part of May. It was found breeding in Iowa by Mr.\r\nS. N. Marston. Mr. Victor Brooke records in the Ibis, 1870, p. 538, the\r\noccurrence, in Ireland, of an example of this species. It was shot in\r\nthe Galtee Mountains, in February, 1870. The bird was a mature female,\r\nwith the ovary somewhat enlarged. The stomach contained the remains of a\r\nrabbit.\r\n\r\nOn the Pacific coast it is comparatively rare in California, though much\r\nmore abundant farther north, in Oregon and in Washington Territory.\r\nDr. Cooper noticed several in the dense spruce forests of Washington\r\nTerritory, and regarded it as a special frequenter of dark woods, where\r\nother Hawks are rarely seen. Dr. Suckley also obtained several specimens\r\nof this bird both at Fort Dalles and at Fort Steilacoom.\r\n\r\nSir John Richardson met with this Hawk and procured several specimens in\r\nthe Arctic regions, and Captain Blakiston also met with it in the valley\r\nof the Saskatchewan. He states that it ranges throughout the interior\r\nfrom Hudson’s Bay to the Rocky Mountains and Mackenzie River. He found\r\nit breeding on the Saskatchewan, and one of his specimens was shot on\r\nits nest. The Goshawk was obtained at Sitka by Bischoff; and a pair was\r\ntaken by Mr. Dall, April 24, 1867, within a few miles of Nulato Fort,\r\non the Yukon River. The nest was on a large poplar, thirty feet above\r\nthe ground, and made of small sticks. No eggs had been laid, but several\r\nnearly mature were found in the ovary of the female. The nest was on a\r\nsmall island in a thick grove of poplars, a situation which this species\r\nseemed to prefer. Mr. Dall adds that this was the most common Hawk in\r\nthe valley of the Yukon, where it feeds largely on the White Ptarmigan\r\n(_Lagopus albus_), tearing off the skin and feathers, and eating only\r\nthe flesh. Mr. Dall received skins from the Kuskoquim River, where it\r\nwas said to be a resident species.\r\n\r\nDr. Suckley speaks of this Hawk as bold, swift, and strong, never\r\nhesitating to sweep into a poultry-yard, catch up a chicken, and make\r\noff with it almost in a breath. Its manner of seizing its prey was by a\r\nhorizontal approach for a short distance, elevated but a few feet from\r\nthe ground, a sudden downward sweep, and then, without stopping its\r\nflight, making its way to a neighboring tree with the struggling victim\r\nsecurely fastened in its talons. For strength, intrepidity, and fury,\r\nDr. Suckley adds, it cannot be surpassed. It seems to display great\r\ncunning, seizing very opportune moments for its attacks. In one instance\r\nit was several days before he was able to have one of these birds\r\nkilled, although men were constantly on the watch for it. So adroit\r\nwas it in seizing opportunities to make its attacks, that it regularly\r\nvisited the poultry-yard three times a day, and yet always contrived to\r\nescape unmolested. He found these birds much more plentiful during some\r\nmonths than at other times, and attributed it to their breeding in the\r\nretired recesses of the mountains, remaining there until their young\r\nwere well able to fly, and then all descending to the open plains, where\r\nthey obtain a more abundant supply of food.\r\n\r\nMr. Audubon states that in Maine the Goshawk was said to prey upon\r\nhares, the Canada and Ruffed Grouse, and upon Wild Ducks. They were so\r\ndaring as to come to the very door of the farm-house, and carry off\r\ntheir prey with such rapidity as to baffle all endeavors to shoot them.\r\nMr. Audubon found this Hawk preying upon the Wild Ducks in Canoe Creek,\r\nnear Henderson, Ky., during a severe winter; as the banks were steep and\r\nhigh, he had them at a disadvantage, and secured a large number of them.\r\nThey caught the Mallards with great ease, and, after killing them, tore\r\noff the feathers with great deliberation and neatness, eating only the\r\nflesh of the breast.\r\n\r\nThe flight of this bird he describes as both rapid and protracted,\r\nsweeping along with such speed as to enable it to seize its prey with\r\nonly a slight deviation from its course, and making great use of its\r\nlong tail in regulating both the direction and the rapidity of its\r\ncourse. It generally flies high, with a constant beat of the wings,\r\nrarely moving in large circles in the manner of other Hawks. It is\r\ndescribed as a restless bird, vigilant and industrious, and seldom\r\nalighting except to devour its prey. When perching, it keeps itself more\r\nupright than most other Hawks.\r\n\r\nAudubon narrates that he once observed one of these birds give chase\r\nto a large flock of the Purple Grakles, then crossing the Ohio River.\r\nThe Hawk came upon them with the swiftness of an arrow; the Blackbirds,\r\nin their fright, rushing together in a compact mass. On overtaking\r\nthem, it seized first one, and then another and another, giving each a\r\ndeath-squeeze, and then dropping it into the water. In this manner it\r\nprocured five before the poor birds could reach the shelter of a wood;\r\nand then, giving up the chase, swept over the waters, picking up the\r\nfruits of its industry, and carrying each bird singly to the shore.\r\n\r\nMr. Audubon, who observed these Hawks in the Great Pine Forest of\r\nPennsylvania, and on the banks of the Niagara River, near the Falls,\r\ndescribes a nest as placed on the branches of a tree, and near the\r\ntrunk. It was of great size, and resembled that of a Crow in the manner\r\nof its construction, but was much flatter. It was made of withered twigs\r\nand coarse grass, with a lining of fibrous strips of plants resembling\r\nhemp. Another, found by Mr. Audubon in the month of April, contained\r\nthree eggs ready to be hatched. In another the number was four.\r\n\r\nMr. Dall states that the eggs are usually four in number, of a\r\ngreenish-white color, and were usually all laid by the first of\r\nMay. An egg of this bird, obtained by Mr. Dall at Nulato, April 27,\r\n1858, measures 2.28 inches in length and 1.90 in breadth. It is of a\r\nrounded-oval shape, and is of a uniform dead-white color, with hardly\r\na tinge of green. Another, obtained by Mr. Charles Pease near the\r\nhead-waters of the Unalakleet River, measures 2.32 by 1.80 inches, and\r\nthe ground-color is more distinctly greenish-white. A few small spots of\r\na bronze-brown are scattered in isolated marking irregularly over the\r\negg. Lieutenant Bendire writes that he has found the eggs of this Hawk\r\nin Montana; that their number in a set is usually two, and an unspotted\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ASTURINA, VIEILLOT.\r\n\r\n  _Asturina_, VIEILL. 1816.

The species of _Rupornis_,\r\nKaup (_R. magnirostris_ and _R. leucorrhoa_), have been associated with\r\nthe species of the present genus, but they are very distinct. The genera\r\n(or, more properly, subgenera) most nearly related to _Asturina_ are\r\n_Leucoptrinis_, Kaup, of tropical America, and _Kaupifalco_, Bonap.,\r\nof Western Africa. The former differs mainly in more or less rounded,\r\ninstead of emarginated, tail, and in having the old and young plumages\r\nsimilar; the latter in having the posterior face of the tarsus without a\r\nwell-defined row of transverse scutellæ.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecies and Races.\r\n\r\n  =A. nitida.= Wing, 9.80–11.50; tail, 6.70–8.00; culmen, .80–1.00;\r\n  tarsus, 2.50–2.90; middle toe, 1.40–1.75. _Adult._ Above clear\r\n  ash, paler on the head and darker on the rump; the general surface\r\n  with more or less appreciable transverse bars, or indications of\r\n  bars, of a paler shade, and with darker shafts.

This is a Mexican and Central American Hawk, which occasionally\r\ncrosses the borders of the United States, having been seen by Mr.\r\nRidgway in Southern Illinois, and found breeding, by Captain Bendire,\r\nin Arizona, near Tucson. It has been found in the State of New Leon,\r\none of the most northern provinces of Mexico, by Lieutenant Couch, who\r\nhas, however, supplied no notes as to any peculiarities in its habits.\r\nIt was said to breed in the tops of lofty trees, and to have eggs of a\r\ngreenish-white, resembling those of _Astur atricapillus_. In Central\r\nAmerica it is said by Salvin to be abundant in the hot country on both\r\ncoast regions of the Republic of Guatemala, but it is not found in the\r\ntemperate regions. Its food consists of lizards, and its flesh is in\r\nconsequence very rank.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Asturina plagiata._]\r\n\r\nMr. Robert Ridgway has met with this Hawk as far to the north as\r\nSouthern Illinois. It was seen and twice shot at on the 19th of August,\r\n1871, on Fox Prairie, in Richland County. Mr. Ridgway came across it\r\nwhile hunting Swallow-tail and Mississippi Kites. The bird, while being\r\nannoyed by these Hawks, was well seen, and there cannot be the slightest\r\ndoubt as to its identity.\r\n\r\nMr. Robert Owen found this Hawk, known in Guatemala by the local name of\r\n_Gavilan_, a common name for the whole race of birds of prey, breeding\r\nat San Geronimo, April 3, 1860. The nests are usually found in the\r\nhigh trees which are scattered over the plain, and not unfrequently\r\nwithin a few yards of the Indian ranchos. Two eggs seemed to be the\r\ncomplement laid by one bird. These eggs are described by Mr. Owen as all\r\nwhite, without any natural coloring. The inner coating of the shell is\r\nsea-green, seeming to confirm the apparently close connection between\r\nthe genera of _Astur_ and _Asturina_.\r\n\r\nMr. G. C. Taylor met what he presumed to be this Hawk in great abundance\r\nat Comayagua, Honduras, in January. He saw a pair making their nest on\r\nthe top of a lofty cotton-tree.\r\n\r\nCaptain Bendire found this species not uncommon and breeding in the\r\nvicinity of Tucson, in Arizona. He found two nests, one of which was\r\ntaken June 6, the other a few days later. They were very slightly built\r\nof sticks and strips of bark, and placed in low trees on the banks of\r\nReledo Creek. The nest contained two eggs. These are of a rounded oval\r\nshape, are quite tapering at one end and rounded at the other. They are\r\nof a uniform bluish-white color and unspotted, and measure 2.00 inches\r\nin length by 1.60 inches in breadth.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ANTENOR, RIDGWAY.\r\n\r\n  _Antenor_, RIDGWAY.

The genus _Craxirex_ of Gould having been founded upon\r\n_Buteo galapagoensis_, a species strictly congeneric with _B. borealis_,\r\nit is necessary that a new generic name should be instituted for the\r\npresent species, since it so well merits separation to that rank.

This Hawk has a very limited range within the United States,\r\nand Mr. Audubon, who was the first to meet with it there, obtained only\r\na single specimen from Louisiana. Supposing it to be an undescribed\r\nspecies, he named it in honor of his friend, Mr. Edward Harris.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Parabuteo harrisi._]\r\n\r\nThis species is occasionally found in the lower portions of the States\r\nof Mississippi and Louisiana, but becomes much more abundant in the\r\nsouthwestern sections of the latter State, and in Texas is common,\r\nespecially about the mouth of the Rio Grande. In one variety or the\r\nother it is frequently met with throughout Mexico, and Central America,\r\nand is also said to be an occasional visitant of Cuba and Jamaica.\r\n\r\nMr. Dresser found this Hawk common throughout Texas to the Colorado\r\nRiver, beyond which he noticed but few. It was the only Hawk he noticed\r\nat Matamoras in the summer. He describes it as a heavy, sluggish bird,\r\nseldom seen on the wing, and subsisting, so far as he could see,\r\nentirely on carrion. All along the road from Brownsville to San Antonio,\r\nhe noticed it either perched on some tree by the roadside, or busy, in\r\ncompany with Vultures and Caracaras, regaling on some offensive carrion.\r\nHe found it breeding in the neighborhood of San Antonio, Medina, and\r\nAltascosa Rivers, having eggs in the month of May. A nest found on the\r\n4th of May, near the Medina River, was built of sticks, very slightly\r\nlined, and was placed in a low hackberry-tree. The eggs were four\r\nin number, and described as white, with a faint bluish tinge, very\r\nsparingly spotted and blotched with red.\r\n\r\nOther writers also agree in representing this Hawk as heavy and\r\nsluggish in habit, and as frequenting streams of water, and its food as\r\nconsisting chiefly of the reptiles and smaller animals which frequent\r\nthe banks of rivers and creeks. It builds its nests on low trees,\r\nin the immediate vicinity of its hunting-ground, and often over the\r\nwater, constructing them of coarse flags and water-plants. The nests\r\nare usually not very large for the birds, are flattened or with very\r\nslight depressions, and the materials are very loosely put together.\r\nThe eggs are from three to five in number, usually white and unspotted,\r\noccasionally with more or less of a yellowish or tawny tinge. In some\r\ninstances they are faintly marked with light dashes or stains of a\r\nyellowish-brown, and, more rarely, are also marked with small blotches\r\nof sepia-brown, and with smaller dottings of purplish-drab. Their\r\naverage measurement is, length 2.13, breadth 1.69 inches.\r\n\r\nOur knowledge of the eggs of these Hawks is derived from the collection\r\nof the late Dr. Berlandier, of Matamoras, in the Province of Tamaulipas,\r\nMexico. In the cabinet of that gentleman were several varieties, now in\r\nthe possession of the Smithsonian Institution, and presented to it by\r\nLieutenant Couch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Onychotes gruberi, Type,_ (=41703.= _California._)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =41703= ¼ ½\r\n\r\n_Onychotes gruberi._]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ONYCHOTES, RIDGWAY.\r\n\r\n  _Onychotes_, RIDGWAY, P. A. N. S. Philad. Dec. 1870, 142. (Type, _O.\r\n  gruberi_, nov. sp.)\r\n\r\nGEN. CHAR. Bill short, the tip remarkably short and obtuse, and only\r\ngradually bent; cere on top about equal to the culmen, very broad\r\nbasally in its transverse diameter, and ascending, in its lateral\r\noutline, on a line with the culmen; commissure only faintly lobed.\r\nNostril nearly circular, with a conspicuous (but not central or bony)\r\ntubercle; cere densely bristled below the nostril, almost to its\r\nanterior edge; orbital region finely bristled. Tarsus very long and\r\nslender, nearly twice the length of the middle toe; toes moderate, the\r\nouter one decidedly longer than the inner; claws very long, strong, and\r\nsharp, and curved in about one quarter the circumference of a circle.\r\nTibial feathers short and close, the plumes scarcely reaching below the\r\njoint. Feathers of the forehead, gular region, sides, and tibiæ, with\r\nwhite filamentous attachments to the end of the shafts. Wing very short,\r\nmuch rounded, and very concave beneath; fourth quill longest; first\r\nshorter than ninth; four primaries emarginated, and one sinuated, on\r\ninner webs; five sinuated on outer webs. Tail about two thirds as long\r\nas wing, rounded. Outstretched feet reaching beyond end of tail.\r\n\r\nThis genus has no very near relatives among the American _Falconidæ_,\r\nnor, indeed, among those of other portions of the world. It is, perhaps,\r\nmost closely related to the genus _Rupornis_, of South America, from\r\nwhich, however, it is very distinct. It is represented by a single\r\nspecies, the type of which, supposed to have come from California, still\r\nremains unique.\r\n\r\nThe elongated legs, reaching considerably beyond the rather short tail,\r\nthe close thigh-plumes, the long and extremely acute claws (somewhat\r\nlike those of _Rostrhamus_), with the short, rounded, and very concave\r\nwing, are its most striking peculiarities. Besides these distinguishing\r\nfeatures, the short, thick bill, very deep through the base, and the\r\nfilamentous attachments to the shafts of the feathers of certain parts\r\nof the body, are also very characteristic. The latter feature may\r\npossibly be a mark of immaturity, but I have seen nothing like it in\r\nother _Raptores_, and it seems to be more analogous to the nuptial\r\nornaments seen in the Cormorants (_Phalocrocoracidæ_).\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecies.\r\n\r\n  =O. gruberi.= Wing, 10.10; tail, 6.50; culmen, about .80; tarsus,\r\n  2.70; middle toe, 1.45; posterior claw, 1.00, its digit .80.\r\n  _Immature_ (?).

About\r\nthirty nominal species are known, of which about fifteen distinct\r\nspecies, not including geographical races, belong to America. A single\r\nspecies, _B. solitarius_ (_Pandion solitarius_, Peale), (Gray’s Hand\r\nList, I, 15, No. 136,) belongs to the Sandwich Islands.

CHAR. _Adult._ Upper surface dark umber-brown, the feathers\r\ngradually paler toward edges; on the back, the feathers more uniformly\r\ndusky, causing a prevalent blackish appearance. Rump and upper\r\ntail-coverts blackish vandyke-brown; the latter tipped with pure white,\r\nand with a concealed bar of same, about the middle of each feather. Tail\r\ndull black, with an obscure terminal band of dull brown, this fading\r\nterminally into whitish; across the middle of the tail a broad band of\r\ndull light umber (in some individuals approaching dull white) about ¾\r\nof an inch in width; about as far anterior to the main band as this\r\nis from the tip is another much narrower and more obscure band of the\r\nsame color, crossing just beyond the ends of the coverts, or concealed\r\nby them. Primaries uniform brownish-black, fading on terminal edge\r\ninto pale brown. Head above, and broad but inconspicuous “mustache,”\r\nrunning from beneath the lore downward across the cheek, dull black;\r\nthe crown posteriorly, with the occiput and nape, having the dull black\r\nmuch broken, caused by the lateral streaks of dull rufous on all the\r\nfeathers; this dull rufous tint prevails on the rest of the head and\r\nneck, as well as the breast, leaving the lores and chin and lateral\r\nportion of frontlet alone whitish; throat streaked with blackish.\r\nBeneath dull brownish-rufous; that of the breast almost unvaried;\r\nmedially, however, are roundish spots of white on opposite webs, but\r\nthese are not confluent; posteriorly these spots become gradually more\r\nnumerous and more transverse, forming on the flanks transverse bands,\r\nalmost continuous; on the tibiæ the white prevails, the rufous bars\r\nbeing more distant, and connected only by a brown shaft-line; lower\r\ntail-coverts less numerous, transverse spots of dull rufous. Lining\r\nof the wing ochraceous-white, with sparse, rather small, irregularly\r\ndeltoid spots of dull rufous; under surface of the primaries unvaried\r\nwhite, as far as their emargination, beyond which they are black. Fourth\r\nquill longest; third a little shorter; second intermediate between fifth\r\nand sixth; first about equal to the ninth. _Female_ (extremes 30,969,\r\nBrookline, Mass., and 30,895, Mirador, Mexico; the latter the larger.)\r\nWing, 11.00–11.30; tail, 6.80–7.10; tarsus, 2.30; middle toe, 1.30.\r\n_Male_ (32,309, Moose Factory, Hudson’s Bay Territory). Wing, 10.50;\r\ntail, 6.30; tarsus, 2.30; middle toe, 1.20.\r\n\r\n_Young male_, second year? (39,106, Remedios, Cuba, June; N. H. Bishop).\r\nUpper parts similar to adult, but a reddish tint appreciably washing\r\nthe edges of the interscapulars and (less noticeably so) the scapulars.\r\nBands on tail nearly as in adult; but very near the base is a fourth,\r\nvery narrow and faintly defined, pale band, while the bases of all\r\nthe feathers are much mottled with white. Dull rufous of the breast\r\nnot continuous, but in the form of large longitudinal broad spots,\r\noccupying the greater middle portion of each feather; abdomen, sides,\r\nand tibiæ with smaller and more cordate spots of dull rufous; the lower\r\ntail-coverts immaculate; the decided ochraceous tinge beneath, deepest\r\nposteriorly.\r\n\r\n_Young_, first year (11,984, Washington, D. C.). The blackish above\r\nis much variegated, being broken by the narrow rusty borders to\r\ninterscapulars, rump, and lesser wing-coverts; the broader and more\r\nochraceous borders to scapulars and greater wing-coverts, and partially\r\nconcealed whitish spotting on the former. Upper tail-coverts white, with\r\nbroad bars of blackish-brown; secondaries and primaries edged terminally\r\nwith whitish. Tail dull umber-brown, growing darker terminally; narrowly\r\ntipped with white, and crossed with six obscure, narrow bands of dusky,\r\nthe (concealed) bases of all the feathers white. Superciliary region,\r\ncheeks, chin, throat, and entire lower parts, delicate pale ochraceous,\r\nor whitish cream-color; a conspicuous “mustache,” a medial longitudinal\r\nseries of streaks on the throat, with large longitudinal ovate spots on\r\nsides of breast, cordate spots on sides and flanks, and sagittate spots\r\non tibiæ, clear blackish-brown. The ochraceous deepest on the abdomen\r\nand crissum. Wing beneath as in adult.\r\n\r\nA very young bird, scarcely fledged (33,598, Milltown, Me.; G. A.\r\nBoardman), differs from the last in a much more continuous black shade\r\nabove, the deeper ochraceous beneath, and larger, as well as more\r\nnumerous, blackish spots beneath.\r\n\r\nIn the adult plumage of this species, the principal variation is in the\r\ncontinuity or distinctness of the anterior light band on the tail, and\r\nthe extent and depth of shade of the brown beneath. The first feature\r\nis characteristic of most specimens, only one (55,980, ♂, Costa Rica)\r\nbeing without it; it is broadest and most conspicuous, as well as less\r\nconcealed by the coverts, in the females, and this appears to be the\r\nprincipal sexual difference. The dull brownish-rufous of the under\r\nparts is most prevalent in a specimen from Mirador, Mexico (30,895, ♀\r\n?

In the Costa-Rican\r\nspecimen (the one lacking the anterior tail-band), the brown beneath\r\nis quite different from that of the others, being of a much more ashy\r\nshade; the lower tail-coverts are also immaculate.

The Broad-winged Hawk appears to be distributed over eastern\r\nNorth America, somewhat irregularly, as far north as the British\r\nProvinces, and as far west at least as the Mississippi. It has been\r\nfound in Florida by Mr. Wurdemann, where it was said to be not uncommon.\r\nIt is a resident in Cuba, where it breeds; but it has not been taken\r\nin Jamaica. It has also been detected in Guatemala by Mr. Skinner.\r\nAudubon states that he never met with it in Louisiana, but Mr. Dresser\r\nfound it not uncommon from the Nueces eastward. In September he noticed\r\nseveral near the Mission of San Patricio, and during the winter obtained\r\nseveral specimens near San Antonio. In May he shot a young bird on\r\nthe Medina River, and early in June he found a nest containing young\r\non the Colorado. It was on a high cottonwood-tree, and in an almost\r\ninaccessible position.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Buteo pennsylvanicus._]\r\n\r\nIt is not mentioned by Mr. Downes as occurring in Nova Scotia, though I\r\nthink it quite probable it may be found there; but it is quite common\r\nnear Calais, both in Eastern Maine and in New Brunswick. Professor\r\nVerrill gives it as a common summer visitant in Oxford County, Me.,\r\nnear Norway, and as still more abundant near the Umbagog Lakes, and\r\napparently the most common Hawk in that vicinity. He found its nest,\r\nJune 12, containing two eggs nearly hatched. It is to be met with\r\nthroughout Massachusetts, having been found breeding near Williamstown,\r\nSpringfield, and also in the vicinity of Boston. Its nest was also met\r\nwith in Middlebury, Vt., by the late Professor Adams. Mr. McIlwraith, of\r\nHamilton, Canada, has noted extensive migrations of this Hawk in March\r\nof different years, as many as twenty or thirty being in view at one\r\ntime, passing at a considerable height, and moving in circles towards\r\nthe northwest. Others, that appeared to be stragglers from the main\r\nbody, were met with in the woods. Dr. Hoy states it to be rather common\r\nnear Racine, and Mr. Kumlien has obtained it in the vicinity of Lake\r\nKoskonong. From all these data it may naturally be inferred that this\r\nHawk has a pretty general distribution from Florida to Texas, and from\r\nNew Brunswick to the Mississippi Valley, probably extending northward\r\ninto the Saskatchewan Valley and south-westerly to Central America.\r\n\r\nThe Broad-winged Hawk was first described by Wilson, who shot a single\r\nspecimen that had been feeding on a meadow-mouse. On his approach it\r\nuttered a whining whistle and flew to another tree. Another of the same\r\nspecies was observed, and its movements were in wide circles, with\r\nunmoving wings. Nuttall never met with it, and regarded it as very rare.\r\n\r\nAudubon characterizes this Hawk as spiritless, inactive, and deficient\r\nin courage, seldom chasing other birds of prey, but itself frequently\r\nannoyed by the little Sparrow-Hawk, the Kingbird, and the Martin. It\r\nonly attacks birds of a weak nature, young chickens, and ducklings,\r\nand feeds on small animals and insects. It is usually found singly, is\r\neasily approached, and when wounded throws itself on its back, erects\r\nits top feathers, utters a hissing sound, and attempts to defend itself\r\nwith its talons.\r\n\r\nA nest of this bird, found by Mr. Audubon, is said to have been about\r\nthe size of that of the Crow, and to have been placed in the larger\r\nbranches of a tree, near the trunk. It was composed externally of dry\r\nsticks and briers; internally, of small roots, and lined with numerous\r\nlarge feathers. The nest found by Professor Adams, near Middlebury, Vt.,\r\nwas quite large, and was coarsely constructed of sticks, and lined only\r\nwith fibrous roots and fine grass. In this instance the eggs were three.\r\nThis is the more usual number, though occasionally four or five are\r\nfound.\r\n\r\nMr. Boardman informs me that Mr. Audubon’s account of the spiritless\r\nmanner in which one of these Hawks suffered him to capture it on its\r\nnest does not at all correspond with his own experience. He has, on\r\nthe contrary, found it one of the most courageous and spirited of its\r\nfamily. On one occasion, when a man employed by him was ascending to a\r\nnest, a parent bird assailed the disturber with great fury, tore his\r\ncap from his head, and would have done the man serious injury had it\r\nnot been shot. In another instance one of these birds attacked a boy\r\nclimbing to its nest, and fastened its talons in his arm, and could not\r\nbe removed until it was beaten off and killed with a club.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of this Hawk have an average length of 2.09 inches, and an\r\naverage breadth of 1.61. The smallest egg measures 1.94 by 1.50 inches,\r\nand the largest 2.11 by 1.72 inches, showing considerable variation\r\nin their relative capacity, but not so much as is found among the\r\neggs of other species. In shape, the eggs are of a slightly rounded\r\noval, one end a little less obtuse than the other. The ground-color\r\nis of a grayish or dirty white, occasionally with a slightly silvery\r\nshading. These are marked, usually over the entire egg, in irregular\r\ndistribution, with varying shades of brown. The more common is a\r\nlight tawny or reddish-brown. Intermingled with these blotches are\r\noften found a peculiar faint purplish-brown, dull shading of a light\r\nyellowish-brown, and a deep rich shade of purplish-brown, approaching\r\noccasionally almost in intensity to black. These may occur separately,\r\nor they may all be found blended in the same egg. The size, shape,\r\nand peculiar coloring of the eggs of this Hawk make them readily\r\nrecognizable, though not readily permitting a satisfactory description.\r\n\r\nA nest of this Hawk, taken by Mr. J. P. Ritchie, May 18, 1863,—the\r\nparent female of which was secured also,—is described as having been\r\nmade of large sticks, very loosely put together, lined with a few pieces\r\nof bark. It was placed in the crotch of a tree, close to the trunk, and\r\ntwenty feet from the ground, and contained two eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\nButeo swainsoni, BONAP.\r\n\r\nVar. =swainsoni=, BONAP.\r\n\r\nSWAINSON’S HAWK; BAIRD’S HAWK.\r\n\r\n  _Buteo swainsoni_, BONAP.

Texas (DRESSER, Ibis, 1865, 324); Arizona (COUES?);\r\nGuatemala (SCL. Ibis, I, 216, “_insignatus_”).\r\n\r\nThe young plumage described above is the _Buteo bairdi_, Hoy, of\r\nauthors. The melanistic plumage is _B. insignatus_, Cassin.\r\n\r\nThe young birds of this species are as variable as the adults; thus,\r\nNo. 53,210, ♂, has the fine ochraceous of the lower parts entirely free\r\nfrom spots, except across the breast; on the upper parts the ochraceous\r\nspotting is so extended as to almost prevail, while another, from the\r\nsame nest, has the black beneath exceeding the ochraceous, the tibiæ\r\nbeing thickly spotted, and the lower tail-coverts barred. Both these\r\nspecimens belong to a brood of four, which were hardly able to fly, and\r\nwere shot, with their parents, the male of which is the one described,\r\nwhile the female (No. 53,206) is a very dark example of _insignatus_,\r\nCassin.\r\n\r\nThe type of _bairdi_, and another Wisconsin specimen, are in the\r\ncollection of the Philadelphia Academy. In plumage, they are unlike\r\nany others I have seen, though there is as little resemblance between\r\nthese two as between any I have compared. Dr. Hoy’s type (Racine,\r\nWisc., January, 1854) differs from others, in exceedingly pale colors;\r\nthe cream-color beneath is scarcely spotted, there being only a few\r\ntriangular spots and shaft-lines of black on the sides; the lining\r\nof the wing is entirely immaculate. Above, the black is unusually\r\ncontinuous; the under surface of the primaries is unusually white. Wing,\r\n15.00; tail, 8.00.\r\n\r\nThe other specimen (Menonomee Marsh, Milwaukee, Wisc., spring of 1851)\r\nis just the opposite extreme in plumage, being unusually dark, for a\r\nyoung bird. Beneath, the black spots are so large as to nearly cover\r\nthe whole surface, while the continuity of the black of the upper part\r\nis almost unbroken. The head above, and nape, and broad “mustache”\r\nstripe from angle of mouth down to the jugulum, with nearly the whole\r\npectoral area, unbroken black, leaving the gular region and side of the\r\nhead pale, but thickly streaked. Wing, 15.00; tail, 8.80; tarsus, 2.35;\r\nmiddle toe, 1.50. These specimens may be said to form about the extremes\r\nof the young plumage. An Iowa skin (No. 59,052; Ricksecker) is like the\r\naverage of far-western examples.\r\n\r\nThe melanistic condition bears to the normal plumage of _swainsoni_\r\nprecisely the same relation that the black _calurus_, Cassin, does to\r\nthe usual style of the western variety of _borealis_ (_borealis_ var.\r\n_calurus_ = _montanus_, Cassin); the variable series, connecting these\r\ntwo extremes, and designated by the name _borealis_ var. _calurus_,\r\nwhich covers the whole, finds an exact parallel in the present species.\r\n\r\nA specimen from the Platte (5,576, ♂, August; W. S. Wood) is entirely\r\ndark rufous-brown beneath (excepting the lower tail-coverts), with the\r\nshafts of the feathers black.\r\n\r\nThis species is entirely distinct specifically from the _B. vulgaris_\r\nof Europe. The latter has four, instead of only three, outer primaries\r\ndeeply emarginated, and is very dissimilar in every stage of plumage.\r\n\r\n\r\nVar. oxypterus, CASSIN.\r\n\r\nSHARP-WINGED HAWK.\r\n\r\n\r\n(_Normal young plumage._)\r\n\r\n  _Buteo oxypterus_, CASS.

The whole forehead very broadly\r\nimmaculate dull white, this continuing back to the occiput in a broad\r\nunstreaked superciliary stripe; along the upper edge of the ear-coverts\r\nis a rusty suffusion, with condensed, fine dusky streaks, forming an\r\nindistinct stripe separating the wholly white ear-coverts from the\r\nsupraoral stripe; the “mustache” is very conspicuous; the breast has a\r\nfew large tear-shaped spots of clear blackish-brown, and the sides have\r\nvery sparse, irregular, and more sagittate spots of the same; the whole\r\nposterior parts are immaculate. The upper parts are more variegated\r\nwith paler, the wing-coverts and rump having the feathers irregularly\r\nbordered with whitish. The upper tail-coverts are white, barred with\r\ndark brown. Tail, hoary brown, crossed by nine or ten nearly obsolete,\r\nnarrow bands of dusky. Whole lining of the wings immaculate, except the\r\nconspicuous patch on the primary coverts. The whole under surface of the\r\nprimaries is uniform slaty, gradually deepening into black towards ends.\r\nWing-formula, 3–4–2–5–6–7, 1. Wing, 15.00; tail, 8.00; tarsus, 2.45;\r\nmiddle toe, 1.55. Primaries project beyond secondaries, 6.00.\r\n\r\nHAB. Tropical America, from the southern border of the United States to\r\nBuenos Ayres.\r\n\r\nThe melanistic specimen described above agrees perfectly with Mr.\r\nSclater’s excellent figure of his _B. fuliginosus_ above cited, and\r\nthe only discrepancy in the description is in the measurements,—those\r\ngiven for the _B. fuliginosus_ being, wing 12.00, tail 6.50, and\r\ntarsus 2.60. This difference—certainly not great—very likely indicates\r\nthe proportions of the sexes, while the discrepancy as regards the\r\nlength of the tarsus, it is probable, results from a different mode of\r\nmeasurement.\r\n\r\nThe present form is very nearly related to the true _B. swainsoni_,\r\nand, though distinguishable, we find it difficult to express points\r\nof absolute difference. The essential distinctions, however, are the\r\nlonger primaries and lighter colors of the present bird, there being\r\nin the immature plumage of _oxypterus_ no approach to the deep, fine\r\nochraceous, the characteristic and prevalent tint of the young _B.\r\nswainsoni_. The spots beneath are more sparse, and there does not appear\r\nto be that tendency to their aggregation on the sides of the breast as\r\ngenerally seen in _swainsoni_.\r\n\r\nBoth agree, however,—and differ from all other species,—in the unbarred\r\nslate-color of the under surface of primaries, the plain black of the\r\nouter surface, conspicuous “mustache,” obscurely barred gray tail, etc.\r\nIn fact, the general pattern is almost exactly the same, while there is\r\nlittle difference in relative proportions.\r\n\r\nIn view of the very appreciable, though rather indefinite, differences\r\nabove indicated, and the obscure history of the present bird, we prefer,\r\nat least until more familiar with its different stages, to recognize it\r\nunder the above name.\r\n\r\nA third specimen, from Buenos Ayres (Conchitas; William H.\r\nHudson),—exactly similar, in all particulars, to the two specimens\r\ndescribed,—was labelled by Mr. Sclater, _B. albicaudatus_, Vieill.,\r\nwhich is usually placed as a synonyme under B. pterocles, an exclusively\r\nSouth American species; though belonging strictly to the same section\r\nof the genus with the present bird and _B. swainsoni_, it is quite\r\ndistinct, the Smithsonian Collection containing numerous examples\r\nillustrating the several stages of plumage.\r\n\r\nHABITS. Taking the two varieties together, this species appears to range\r\nover the entire continent of America, from the Arctic regions to the\r\ncold-temperate portion of South America. In Arctic America it appears to\r\nhave a western distribution, though extending far to the north during\r\nthe breeding-season, and being more or less nomadic during the winter. A\r\nsingle well-marked specimen was taken by Mr. Brewster, in the winter of\r\n1871–72, in the eastern part of Massachusetts. It was first noticed by\r\nDr. Richardson, and was by him supposed to be identical with the common\r\nBuzzard of Europe. It was met with in the fur country, where it was\r\nmigratory, arriving there early in April, and departing again about the\r\nend of September. It frequented the low alluvial points of land which\r\nstretch out under the high banks of rivers, where it might be observed\r\nsitting for a long while motionless on the bough of a tree, waiting\r\npatiently for some small birds or quadrupeds to pass within its reach.\r\nAs soon as it perceived anything of the kind, it would glide silently\r\ninto the air and sweep easily but rapidly down upon its prey. One of Dr.\r\nRichardson’s specimens was found to have two whole toads in its stomach.\r\n\r\nDr. Richardson states that this Buzzard builds its nest on a tree, of\r\nshort sticks, lining it sparingly with deer’s hair. The eggs, from three\r\nto five in number, are described as equalling in size those of the\r\ndomestic fowl, and as having a greenish-white color, with a few large\r\ndark brown blotches at the larger end. It was seen by the doctor as far\r\nto the north as the 57th parallel.\r\n\r\nMr. Audubon’s drawing and description of this bird were taken from a\r\nspecimen obtained by Dr. Townsend from the Columbia River. A number\r\nof specimens have been obtained by the various government exploring\r\nexpeditions. A single specimen was taken by Mr. Dresser near San\r\nAntonio, in Texas.\r\n\r\nCaptain Blakiston (Ibis, 1861, p. 317) obtained several specimens of\r\nthis Buzzard at the forks of the Saskatchewan River, in the stomach\r\nof one of which he found three toads. He states that it was quite\r\nabundant in that neighborhood. He adds that Mr. Bourgeau procured\r\nseveral specimens of the eggs, identified by also obtaining the parents.\r\nThese eggs are said to have been white, more or less blotched with red.\r\nMr. Bernard Ross also obtained this bird on the Mackenzie River, where\r\nit was rare.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Buteo swainsoni_ (adult).]\r\n\r\nThis Hawk was observed by Mr. Dall, in Alaska, a skin having been\r\nobtained at Koyukuk, May 26, from an Indian. Mr. Dall states that it\r\nprefers the thickets and woody places, is not so often seen as some of\r\nthe other species. It generally builds a very large nest of sticks, and\r\nbegins to lay about the last of April. The young are hatched out about\r\nthe 30th of May. It was only a summer visitor. He found not only the\r\nbones of rabbits, squirrels, and mice about its nest, but also those of\r\nducks, and in one instance part of a white-fish.\r\n\r\nDr. Heermann obtained an egg of this species in Northern California,\r\nwhich had a yellowish-white ground-color, marked with obscure cloudings\r\nof a purplish-gray, and irregular patches of a light tone of umber\r\nbrown. It measured 2.31 inches in length, and 1.84 in breadth.\r\n\r\nWe are indebted to Dr. W. J. Hoffmann for the following interesting\r\nnote in relation to the nesting of this species: “On the 28th of May,\r\n1871, we encamped on Antelope Creek, forty miles north of the Central\r\nPacific Railroad Station, Argenta, Nevada. The stream of water, which\r\nis small, is fringed with willows, averaging about twelve feet in\r\nheight. Strolling along the underbrush, I came to the nest of the\r\n_Buteo swainsoni_, which was built on the top of a willow, and in its\r\nconstruction took in several distinct limbs, so as to give better\r\nsupport. The nest, about two feet across and one foot in thickness,\r\nwas constructed of thin sticks and fragments of roots. The inside was\r\nlined with leaves of tule and grass. The nest contained two eggs. Only\r\neight feet from this nest, on the same bush, and at the same height, a\r\nfemale of _Icterus bullocki_ was on her nest. These birds appeared to be\r\nliving together in harmony, having been in constant sight of each other\r\nfor several weeks, as the condition of the eggs proved. I deem this\r\nremarkable only as showing a rapacious and an insectivorous bird living\r\nso closely together that one might at any time have been made the prey\r\nof the other by a single spread of the wings.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Buteo swainsoni_ (young).]\r\n\r\nDr. Gideon Lincecum, of Washington County, Texas, speaks of this species\r\nas one of the common Hawks of the Texan prairies. He states that it\r\nnests on the ground in the prairie; lays six eggs, sometimes on tall\r\ntrees,—when it chooses to rear its young in the forest. It is apt to\r\npounce on a brood of young poultry when it sees them, but being rather\r\ntimid does not like to go about the houses. Its principal food is\r\ngrasshoppers, prairie rats and mice, and small birds. Dr. Lincecum has\r\noften seen it when the grass on the prairie was burning, in the spring\r\nof the year, constantly on the wing, in front of the fire, catching the\r\ngrasshoppers, rats, mice, and any small game that is driven out of the\r\ngrass by the crackling fire; and it will keep in the smoke so close\r\nto the fire that it soon becomes almost as black as soot. He further\r\nremarks that, “when any one approaches their nest on the prairie, they\r\nwill make a pretty bold attempt to frighten or decoy him away from it.\r\nIt first tries to lead the intruder off, by alighting in the grass near\r\nby, and screeching loudly as if something was greatly the matter; you\r\napproach him, and with much seeming difficulty it makes out to move off\r\na little farther, still screeching louder than before, and this piece\r\nof deception it will repeat time after time, improving a little in its\r\npowers of locomotion as it gets you farther from the nest, until it\r\njudges it is far enough,—that you have lost the place in the unmarked\r\nsea of grass,—when it seems to fly as well as ever; it circles round\r\nonce or twice, going still farther off, and settles silently down in\r\nthe deep grass. This last performance is to induce the belief that it\r\nhas returned to the nest. But if you refuse to be led astray by these\r\nmanœuvres, and remain about its nest, it will make a good fight. One\r\ncame very near knocking off my hat one day when I did not know I was\r\nintruding on its premises.”\r\n\r\nThe _Buteo bairdi_ of Hoy is now ascertained to be only an immature\r\nform. It was first met with in Wisconsin, and since then has been taken\r\nin various western localities.\r\n\r\nA pair of these birds was found by Mr. Ricksecker, breeding in this\r\nplumage, in Utah. The nest was built in a young aspen-tree. The egg is\r\nmarked with larger and more deeply marked blotches than usual, and is\r\nnearly of an exact oval shape, measuring 2.30 inches in length by 1.75\r\nin breadth. The ground-color is white, with a slight tinge of rufous,\r\nover which are diffused, over the whole surface, fine markings of a\r\nreddish, rust-tinged brown. Besides these the larger end, and some other\r\nportions of the surface, are boldly dashed with large blotches of the\r\nsame color, but of a deeper shade.\r\n\r\nA black Buzzard, originally described as _Buteo insignatus_, is now\r\nknown to be only an individual melanistic condition of the species.\r\nIt was first met with in the vicinity of Montreal, and the specimen\r\nbelonging to the Natural History Society of that city was described as\r\nnew by Mr. John Cassin. A similar specimen was taken by Mr. Macfarlane\r\nat Fort Anderson, where it was breeding. It was met with rather\r\nabundantly by Dr. Heermann on the San Joaquin River, in California, and\r\nseen along his route for a considerable distance. He described it as\r\nsluggish in its habits, perching for hours in a quiescent state on some\r\ntall tree, and permitting the hunter to approach without showing any\r\nsigns of fear.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Buteo swainsoni_, var. _oxypterus_ (young).]\r\n\r\nDr. Cooper found this bird pretty common in the vicinity of San Diego,\r\nin March, 1862, when they were apparently migrating northward. In their\r\nhabits they appeared to resemble the larger varieties of Buzzards. Mr.\r\nSalvin obtained a single specimen of a Hawk at Duenas, which is referred\r\nby Mr. Gurney to this variety (Ibis, I, 216).\r\n\r\nThe variety _oxypterus_, of this species, was first described from an\r\nimmature specimen obtained at Fort Fillmore, New Mexico. It ranges\r\nsouthward throughout tropical America to Buenos Ayres.\r\n\r\n\r\nButeo zonocercus, SCLATER.\r\n\r\nBAND-TAIL HAWK.\r\n\r\n  _?? Buteo albonotatus_, G. R.

Entirely carbonaceous black; forehead pure white, and\r\nfeathers of occiput, neck, and breast the same beneath the surface; this\r\non under parts, showing as transverse, ovate spots on webs of feathers,\r\npartially exposed. Tail black, faintly tipped with pale ashy, crossed\r\n(about 1¾ inches from the end) by a band of hoary plumbeous, nearly an\r\ninch in width; about half an inch anterior to this is another plumbeous\r\nband, about as broad as the black one which separates it from the last;\r\nand about the same distance, near the base, is another, much narrower,\r\nand less continuous ashy band. The outlines of these bands are rather\r\nirregular; and on the inner webs the plumbeous is replaced by snowy\r\nwhite, which, not exactly corresponding to the plumbeous of outer webs,\r\nis rather more extended, as well as more sharply defined, forming three\r\nvery conspicuous transverse zones (decreasing in width towards the base\r\nlike those on outer webs), observable only when the tail is spread,\r\nor from below. On the two middle feathers both webs are plumbeous and\r\nblack; and on the lateral feathers, the white prevails on the inner web,\r\nthe black bands being broken up into narrow zigzags. Primaries less\r\nintensely black than the back, and showing obscure transverse bands of\r\ndeeper black; lining of the wing unvariegated black; under surface of\r\nprimaries pale plumbeous, passing into hoary white on edges, and crossed\r\nfrom base to ends with very irregular, transverse bars of blackish,\r\nthese breaking up into a mottling, or blended speckling, along the edges\r\nof the feathers. Owing to moulting stage, the wing-formula cannot be\r\nascertained.

Total, 4.\r\n\r\nThere can be but little doubt that this plumage denotes a younger\r\nstage of the same species as the _B. zonocercus_ of Sclater. The adult\r\nbird described above is moulting, and two tail-feathers of the old\r\nplumage, which have not yet been cast, are precisely like those of this\r\nspecimen, the new ones being entirely different, as will be seen by\r\nthe description. Taking with this the exact similarity of the pattern\r\nof under side of primaries, as well as the plumage in general, and the\r\nsameness of proportions, one cannot but be convinced of their identity.\r\nThe localities of the two specimens are also so near that it is scarcely\r\npossible they are distinct.\r\n\r\nThe plumage of this stage is parallel, in its relation to the adult,\r\nwith that of the young of _B. albifrons_ var. _minutus_, both differing\r\nfrom the mature stage in nearly the same particulars, the more numerous\r\nbands on the tail distinguishing the young of nearly all _Buteos_ from\r\nadults of the same species.\r\n\r\nAn adult specimen from Mexico, in the collection of the Philadelphia\r\nAcademy (without number or other indications on the label), though\r\nresembling the two specimens described, in all essential points, differs\r\nfrom them in regard to the coloration of the tail. The main differences\r\nare as follows: Tail deep black basally and subterminally, the tip (very\r\nnarrowly) and a middle zone about 2.00 inches broad, and 1.80 from the\r\ntip, being duller and more brownish-black, this irregularly defined\r\nanteriorly, but of sharp regular definition along the posterior border;\r\nthe subterminal black band is very precisely defined on the inner webs,\r\nand anterior to this nearly the whole inner web is white, irregularly\r\nblotched with black towards the base, however; the markings of somewhat\r\nlongitudinal direction; the outer webs are black to the very base. Wing,\r\n16.50; tail, 9.00; tarsus, 2.70; middle toe, 1.80. Wing-formula, 4,\r\n3–5–2–6–7, 1.\r\n\r\nWhether this is a progressive stage of plumage or a mere individual\r\npeculiarity, I do not feel certain, but am inclined to the latter\r\nopinion. Both this specimen and the immature one described are labelled\r\n_B. albonotatus_, Gray; I have been unable to refer to Gray’s original\r\ndescription; if there is no doubt of its being pertinent to the immature\r\nstage described, then this will be the name of the species, as it has\r\npriority; I should much regret, however, to discard the very appropriate\r\nand characteristic name _zonocercus_, for the other, as Mr. Sclater’s\r\nspecies is so satisfactorily described and accurately figured, while the\r\noriginal description of _albonotatus_ is very meagre and difficult of\r\nreference.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Buteo zonocercus_ (adult).]\r\n\r\nHABITS. This Hawk is a Mexican and Guatemalan species which occasionally\r\nstrays into our borders in Arizona and in Southern California. Dr.\r\nCooper was the first of our naturalists to meet with this species within\r\nthe United States, shooting an individual on the 23d of February, 1862,\r\nthirty miles north of San Diego, and within five of the coast. It was\r\nassociating with specimens of _B. insignatus_ and other Hawks wintering\r\nthere, and seemed rather sluggish and tame. He saw no other Black Hawks\r\nin that neighborhood. Two years afterwards, September 24, 1864, Dr.\r\nCoues also procured a single specimen on the Gila River. He regards the\r\nspecies as restricted, within our borders, to the warm valley of the\r\nGila and the Lower Colorado. We possess no information in regard to\r\nany distinctive specific habits it may possess. This species was first\r\ndescribed by Dr. Sclater from a Guatemalan specimen.\r\n\r\nThe bird described as _B. albonotatus_ is presumed to be identical with\r\nthis species. It was observed by Mr. Salvin on the southern slope of the\r\nCordillera, in Guatemala, which appears to be the true habitat of this\r\nspecies, but even there it cannot be said to be common. He states that,\r\nlike many others of its class, it is a feeder on beetles and locusts.\r\n\r\n\r\nButeo lineatus, GMELIN.\r\n\r\nVar. =lineatus=, GMELIN.\r\n\r\nRED-SHOULDERED HAWK.\r\n\r\n  _Falco lineatus_, GMEL.

Head, neck,\r\nand interscapulars deep rufous (above becoming darker posteriorly),\r\neach feather with a medial stripe of blackish-brown. Throat and cheeks\r\nalmost destitute of rufous tinge, the ground being dull white,—the\r\ndusky forming an indistinct “mustache,” and an imperfect, obsolete\r\ncollar (formed by confluent, or suffused streaks), across the throat.\r\nBreast, sides, abdomen, and tibiæ rather light rufous, becoming paler\r\nposteriorly; breast with shaft-streaks of blackish; the rufous of\r\nsides of breast almost unvaried; abdomen, sides, and middle of the\r\nbreast, with transverse bars of ochraceous white; tibiæ uniform pale\r\nochraceous; anal region and lower tail-coverts, immaculate white.\r\nLesser wing-coverts chestnut-rufous, feathers with black shaft-streaks,\r\nthese becoming larger posteriorly; scapulars and middle wing-coverts\r\nedged broadly with rufous, and obsoletely spotted on inner webs with\r\nwhite.—this somewhat exposed; secondaries dark clear brown, tipped and\r\ncrossed with two (exposed) bands of white; primaries black, fading at\r\ntips into dilute grayish-brown, and with quadrate spots of white on\r\nouter webs. Rump uniform blackish-brown; upper tail-coverts tipped\r\nand banded with black. Tail clear brownish-black, crossed with six\r\nsharply defined narrow bands of white, the last of which is terminal,\r\nand the first two concealed by the upper coverts. Lining of the wing\r\nnearly uniform pale rufous, with very sparse, deeper rufous, somewhat\r\ntransverse spots; under surface of primaries silvery white, crossed\r\nby broad bands, these where the white is clearest being pale rufous,\r\nbordered with dusky, but as the white grows more silvery they darken\r\ninto black; the longest (fourth) has eight of these spots, including\r\nthe subterminal, very broad one. Fourth quill longest; fifth, just\r\nperceptibly shorter; third, a little shorter; second, considerably\r\nlonger than sixth; first equal to ninth.

C., February) is as strongly barred\r\nbeneath as described in the female; thus it would appear that any\r\ndifferences in plumage in the sexes are nothing more than individual\r\ndiscrepancies.\r\n\r\nThe yellowish outer webs of the primaries constitute a feature which\r\nwill serve to distinguish the young of the _Buteo lineatus_ from that of\r\nevery other North American species.\r\n\r\nA series of twelve specimens from Florida, in the Museum of Comparative\r\nZoölogy, at Cambridge, shows that the birds of this species from that\r\npeninsula are very much smaller than northern ones; and though that of\r\nthe adults does not differ appreciably, the plumage of the young birds\r\nis considerably darker than in northern specimens, and occasionally\r\napproaches quite nearly to that of the young of var. _elegans_, the\r\nmarkings on the lower parts, including the tibiæ, being often in the\r\nform of transverse spots.\r\n\r\nThe extreme measurements of this series are as follows: Wing,\r\n10.90–12.75; tail, 7.70–8.50; culmen, .80–.90; tarsus, 2.90–3.20; middle\r\ntoe, 1.25–1.45.

Head, neck, interscapulars, anterior scapulars,\r\nlesser wing-coverts, lining of the wing, and entire lower parts, dark\r\nlateritious-rufous, inclining to chestnut on the shoulders. The upper\r\nparts so colored have each feathers with a medial-ovate space of dull\r\nblack, giving a striped appearance; the lesser wing-coverts, however,\r\nhave each only a narrow shaft-line of black, these growing larger as\r\nthey approach the middle coverts. There is a strong black suffusion\r\nover the cheeks, forming an obscure “mustache”; orbit blackish,\r\nthroat streaked with the same. The dark lateritious-rufous of the\r\njugulum and breast is perfectly continuous and uniform, varied only\r\nby the obsoletely darker shafts of the feathers; sides and flanks\r\ntransversely barred with white; lining of the wing, and tibiæ, with very\r\nill-defined bars of paler rufous; anal region and lower tail-coverts\r\nwith broader and more sharply defined bars of the same. Scapulars and\r\nmiddle wing-coverts brownish-black, narrowly tipped, and irregularly\r\nspotted transversely, with pure white; secondaries and greater coverts\r\nbrownish-black, tinged with rufous, and broadly tipped and crossed, with\r\nsharply defined bands of pure white, of which there are on secondaries\r\nabout six exposed (including the terminal band); primaries and their\r\ncoverts deep black (tinged anterior to their emargination with rufous),\r\ntipped with pure white, and having spots of white on outer webs. Rump\r\nand upper tail-coverts brownish-black, with indistinct transverse\r\nbands of white, the latter sharply tipped with the same. Tail clear\r\nbrownish-black sharply tipped with white, and with about five sharply\r\ndefined bands of the same, about .30 of an inch in width. Under surface\r\nof secondaries and primaries white to near the ends, where they are\r\nblack; the tips, however, again white; the white portion crossed by\r\nregular transverse bands, those where the white is purest being light\r\nrufous, but as the white shades toward the black they become dusky; the\r\nrufous bars are, however, bordered with dusky. Fifth quill longest;\r\nthird and fourth longer than sixth; second a little shorter than sixth;\r\nfirst intermediate between ninth and tenth. Wing, 12.50; tail, 8.00;\r\ntarsus, 2.90; middle toe, 1.40.\r\n\r\n_Young._ Predominating color, blackish-brown; this existing on under\r\nparts in large, confluent sagittate spots, which are longitudinal on\r\nthroat and jugulum, and more transverse on sides, abdomen, tibiæ,\r\nand lower tail-coverts, the ground-color of lower parts being dull\r\nochraceous. The head and neck, all around, presenting a uniform,\r\nstreaked appearance, the edges of the feathers being ochraceous, but\r\nthe black far exceeding this in amount. Interscapulars and scapulars\r\nbordered with rusty rufous; wing-coverts more broadly bordered with\r\nochraceous, and with much concealed dull white spotting; lesser\r\nwing-coverts, with a strong wash of rich dark rufous; secondaries tipped\r\nwith white, and crossed by two or three (exposed) broad bands of dull\r\nashy; primaries brownish-black, narrowly tipped with white, and with\r\nill-defined restricted spots of the same on outer webs. Rump uniform\r\nblackish-brown, feathers faintly bordered with rusty; upper tail-coverts\r\ntipped and barred with white. Tail brownish-black tipped with white, and\r\ncrossed with five narrow bands of dull light ashy. Lining of wing dull,\r\ndingy ochraceous, with numerous transverse bars of brown; fourth quill\r\nlongest; third shorter than fifth; second longer than sixth; first equal\r\nto ninth.

Total, 11.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Measurements._\r\n\r\nWing, 12.00–13.00; tail, 8.75–9.50; culmen, .78–.90; tarsus, 3.00–3.12;\r\nmiddle toe, 1.40–1.50.\r\n\r\nThe young of the _Buteo elegans_ differs most remarkably from that of\r\n_B. lineatus_; the pattern of coloration appears scarcely the same,\r\nfor the ochraceous on outer webs of primaries, anterior to their\r\nemargination,—which is a feature distinguishing the immature _lineatus_\r\nfrom all other _Buteos_,—is in the present bird almost obliterated by\r\nthe extension of the dusky.\r\n\r\nHABITS. The Red-shouldered Hawk has an extended distribution, being\r\nfound more or less abundant from Florida to Nova Scotia, and from the\r\nAtlantic to the Pacific coast it is replaced by the _Buteo elegans_.\r\nMr. J. A. Allen found it by far the most abundant of this family in\r\nFlorida. In Texas the two races, _lineatus_ and _elegans_, appear to\r\noccur together, Mr. Dresser having met with both near San Antonio. The\r\nRed-shouldered Hawk was noticed by this writer from the river Neuces\r\neastward. He found it breeding in the heavily wooded river bottoms of\r\nthe Medina, and several others of the rivers of Texas, but did not\r\nsucceed in procuring the eggs. It breeds abundantly in Florida, and\r\nthence throughout the United States as far north as Northern Vermont,\r\nNova Scotia, and New Brunswick. Lieutenant Bland notices it as a common\r\nand migratory species in Nova Scotia, but Mr. Downes speaks of it as\r\nrare near Halifax, where he only met with two specimens. Mr. Boardman\r\ngives it as quite common near Calais, breeding there and probably\r\nresident. In Western Maine Mr. Verrill regarded the species as a not\r\nvery common summer resident, where it was also known to breed, as he\r\nmet with its nest and eggs May 24, 1860. It is quite common in Eastern\r\nMassachusetts, where it is found all the year, but where it is more\r\nabundant in the fall, from the addition of northern migrants, than at\r\nany other time. A few are found throughout the winter, keeping about\r\nopen springs and in sheltered situations. Mr. Allen also speaks of it as\r\nnot uncommon in the western part of the same State. It was not taken or\r\nseen by Richardson in northern regions, nor does it appear to have been\r\nobserved in any of the West India Islands.\r\n\r\nThe history and habits of this very common Hawk seem to have been\r\ninvolved, among earlier writers, in a confusion that seems hardly\r\nexplicable. Wilson described and always regarded the young and old as\r\ntwo distinct species, calling the former _hyemalis_, giving to it a\r\nnorthern residence, and the mature bird _lineatus_. Mr. Audubon repeated\r\nthis error at first, and sought to demonstrate its correctness by giving\r\nto the two forms very dissimilar habits. Bonaparte believed these\r\nforms to be identical, and Nuttall did the same, but was altogether\r\nin error as to its distribution. He was not aware of its presence in\r\nMassachusetts, where it is at times the most abundant of the raptorial\r\nbirds. This writer only met with it in the Southern States, where he\r\nfound it very common in swampy situations. He speaks of its having a\r\nquailing cry of mutual recognition, which is a plaintive echoing note,\r\nlike _keé-oó_, which is continued with little intermission for nearly\r\ntwenty minutes. He describes the species as not shy, and as very easily\r\napproached. These Hawks remain mated throughout the year, and their\r\naffectionate treatment of each other is in striking contrast with the\r\nselfish indifference of the Red-tail species when their breeding-season\r\nis ended.\r\n\r\nNuttall observed it feeding on frogs, cray-fish, and even insects,\r\nand rarely troubling larger game. In only one instance did he see one\r\ndescend upon a Plover. Wilson saw them attack Plover, Sand-pipers,\r\nLarks, and even Hawks; but the last is very rare and exceptional. I have\r\nnever known one of this species to molest the poultry-yard. From 1828 to\r\n1838, during my stay in Roxbury, a pair of these Hawks were residents\r\nwithin a few hundred yards of the house, where, as they never molested\r\nthe tenants of the barn-yard, they were not allowed to be disturbed.\r\nTheir breeding-place we could not find, but they kept about an open\r\nspring during the winter, feeding upon small game, and were not at all\r\nshy. One of them unfortunately was wounded, and was kept in confinement\r\nseveral days. It was the male bird, in full adult plumage, and was by\r\nno means wild, feeding readily upon what was given to it, even with\r\nour near presence. It would not tolerate a too great familiarity, but\r\nmanifested great irritation if we attempted to approach it. Its wing\r\nhad been badly shattered, and it finally died from mortification of the\r\nwound. It would never submit to be handled, and fought desperately when\r\nwe sought to have its limb bound up. After we gave up this attempt as\r\nimpossible it became rather more familiar, and would even at last greet\r\nme with a welcome cry of recognition, and take its food from my hand.\r\n\r\nWilson, in speaking of the adult bird, states that this Hawk has a high\r\nand very irregular flight, and is quite different from that of species\r\nwith longer wings. In his account of the immature plumage, he notes\r\nits arrival in Pennsylvania early in November, and its departure in\r\nMarch. He speaks of it as a dexterous catcher of frogs, and adds that it\r\nsometimes so stuffs itself that it can fly with difficulty. He has found\r\nthe remains of ten frogs in the stomach of a single individual.\r\n\r\nThe Red-shouldered Hawk constructs a large nest, not unlike that\r\nof the Crow, in the forked branches of a high tree. It is composed\r\nexternally of sticks, and is lined with moss and soft leaves. The eggs\r\nare four in number, and occasionally three or two. When the nest is\r\napproached, the bird utters loud, frequent, and peculiar cries of alarm\r\nand resentment, not unlike _keé-oó!_ rapidly repeated, but makes no\r\nattempt at resistance. The pair return year after year to the same nest,\r\neven when it has been robbed the previous season.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of this Hawk are of a very uniform spheroidal-oval shape,\r\nbut slightly pointed at one end, and exhibit certain very general\r\ncharacteristics in the colors of their markings, but vary greatly in\r\ntheir size. The length varies from 2.20 to 2.00, and the breadth from\r\n1.81 to 1.56. The ground-color is usually a dingy white, rarely pure\r\nwhite, and frequently with decidedly brownish tinge. The blotches are\r\nmost frequently of a yellowish umber color; sometimes blotches of\r\nsienna-brown, slate-drab, and more obscure shades of brown are present,\r\nand these colors are not unfrequently confusedly mingled. An egg from\r\nCheraw, S. C., has a ground-color of a light drab, tinged with slate and\r\nwithout any blotches whatever. It is not uncommon to find these nearly\r\nunspotted eggs in the same nest with others very boldly and profusely\r\nblotched. The Cheraw egg measures 2.00 by 1.56 inches; an egg from\r\nMassachusetts, 2.20 by 1.81: their relative capacity being nearly as\r\nthree to four. They average about 2.10 by 1.68 inches.\r\n\r\nMr. L. Heiligbrodt found the nest of this Hawk near Austin, Texas. One\r\negg was taken from the nest, and in a few days after a second was found\r\nto have been deposited (S. I. 15,894).\r\n\r\nThe handsome variety known as _B. elegans_ is generally spoken of by all\r\nfamiliar with its habits, as well as with its appearance, as the almost\r\nexact counterpart of the Red-shouldered Hawk, replacing that form on the\r\nwest coast.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Buteo elegans._]\r\n\r\nIn regard to its distinctive specific habits but little is as yet known,\r\nbut it is probable they are not essentially different from those of\r\nthe _lineatus_, Dr. Cooper bearing positive testimony to this fact. He\r\nfound this Hawk common in the southern part of the State, especially\r\nnear San Diego, but he did not meet with any in the Colorado Valley.\r\nOn his approach to one of them, it would always fly off from its usual\r\nperch, circling up high into the air, and uttering short shrill screams\r\nin rapid succession in the manner of the _lineatus_. He noticed a pair\r\nconstantly at one place near a ranch, and supposed they were about\r\nbuilding there, but was not able to find the nest.\r\n\r\nAmong the memoranda of Mr. Xantus, made at Fort Tejon, Cal., is one\r\ndated May 9, mentioning the finding the nest of this species. It\r\ncontained four eggs, was built in an old decayed tree, in a swamp, and\r\nwas about fifteen feet from the ground. The nest was large and made of\r\nsticks.\r\n\r\n\r\nButeo borealis (GMEL.).\r\n\r\nRED-TAILED HAWK.\r\n\r\nSP. CHAR.

CHAR. _Adult._ Upper parts rich blackish-brown, approaching black\r\non the back; scapulars and middle wing-coverts edged and barred beneath\r\nthe surface with dull white, and tinged along edges with ochraceous.\r\nWings generally of a paler shade than the back; secondaries fading into\r\nnearly white at tips, and, with the greater coverts, obscurely barred\r\nwith darker; primaries nearly black, tips edged with pale brown, this\r\npassing into whitish. Rump uniform blackish-brown, feathers obscurely\r\nbordered with rusty. Upper tail-coverts ochraceous-white, nearly pure\r\nterminally, and with about two distinct transverse bars of deep rufous.\r\nTail rich uniform lateritious-rufous, passing narrowly into white at\r\nthe tip, and about an inch (or less) from the end crossed by a narrow\r\nband of black. Head and neck with the feathers medially blackish-brown,\r\ntheir edges rusty-rufous, causing a streaked appearance; the rufous\r\nprevailing on the sides of the occiput, the ear-coverts, and neck.

Total, 50.\r\n\r\nThe true _Buteo borealis_, as restricted, may always be distinguished\r\nfrom the var. _calurus_, its western representative, by its having the\r\nposterior lower parts (tibiæ and lower tail-coverts) entirely free\r\nfrom transverse bars, and by lacking indications of transverse bars on\r\nthe tail, anterior to the conspicuous subterminal one. It differs from\r\nthe var. _costaricensis_, in having the head and neck conspicuously\r\nstriped with rufous, and the throat thickly striped with black, almost\r\nobliterating the white; in the conspicuous abdominal belt of large black\r\nspots, and in having the tibiæ lighter ochraceous than the breast;\r\nfrom the var. _lucasanus_ and var. _krideri_, it is distinguished by\r\nhaving the black tail-band, more spotted under parts, and in the upper\r\ntail-coverts being white, banded with rufous, instead of plain white, or\r\ndeep rufous, uniform with the tail.\r\n\r\nA specimen (No. 1,750, Carlisle, Pa.; S. F. Baird) appears at first\r\nsight much like the var. _calurus_, being very dark; the tibiæ, anal\r\nregion, and the lower tail-coverts are, however, not barred as in this,\r\nand the tail possesses but the subterminal band.\r\n\r\nAn immature specimen (No. 21,488; John Krider) from Philadelphia has the\r\ntibiæ quite distinctly barred, but less conspicuously so than in young\r\nof var. _calurus_.\r\n\r\n\r\nVar. krideri, HOOPES.\r\n\r\nWHITE-BELLIED RED-TAIL.\r\n\r\n  _Buteo krideri_, HOOPES, P.

CHAR. _Adult._ Similar to var. _borealis_, but beneath continuous\r\npure white, without rufous tinge, and without distinct spots across\r\nthe abdomen, or lacking them entirely; above much lighter, the brown,\r\nlight rufous, and white being about equal in amount. Upper tail-coverts\r\nimmaculate white; tail pale rufous, the shafts pure white, and the webs\r\nmixed with white along their edges, its amount increasing toward the\r\nbase; no trace of a dusky subterminal bar, or else only indicated by\r\nbadly defined spots.\r\n\r\n_Young._ Differing from that of var. _borealis_ in the immaculate,\r\nsnowy-white lower parts, nearly equal extent of the white and dusky on\r\nthe upper parts, and whitish cast of the tail.\r\n\r\nTwo females (one shot from nest of two eggs, near Alexandria, Minn.,\r\nMay 8, 1872,[87] and the other, also shot from nest of two eggs, near\r\nPelican Lake, Minn., May 21, 1872[88]) are entirely absolutely pure\r\nwhite beneath, there being but the faintest indications of markings in\r\nthe region of the usual abdominal belt; even the whole under side of the\r\nwing is almost immaculate. The ground-color of the upper parts is pale\r\ngrayish-brown, about equally variegated transversely, on the scapulars\r\nand tertials, with white. In one of them, the sides of the head and neck\r\nare pale fawn-color, the “mustache” from the rictus brownish-black in\r\nconspicuous contrast; the upper parts are nearly equally variegated with\r\nbrown, light rufous, and white, the latter predominating posteriorly.\r\nThe upper tail-coverts are immaculate white. The tail-feathers are light\r\nrufous, with pure white shafts, considerably mixed with white along the\r\nedges of the feathers, the white considerably increasing towards the\r\nbase of the tail. Of the subterminal dusky band there is no trace in one\r\nspecimen, while in the other it is indicated by transverse spots, while\r\nthe inner webs along the shafts are much variegated with transverse\r\ndusky spots. The male specimen (shot at Chippewa Lake, Minn., from nest\r\n(!) of two eggs May 19, 1872[89]) is considerably darker, nearly like\r\nthe average plumage of eastern var. _borealis_. Still the white of the\r\nlower parts is remarkably pure, being of an almost snowy clearness,\r\nwithout any trace whatever of an ochraceous tinge.\r\n\r\nNo. 8,532, Devil’s River, Texas (Nov. 1855; Dr. C.

Peninsula of Lower California.\r\n\r\nAll adult specimens from the peninsula of Lower California agree with\r\nthat described above, in the peculiar features which I consider as\r\ncharacterizing a well-marked local race. The present form is most nearly\r\nrelated, in its adult dress, to the var. _krideri_ of the plains, in its\r\nunbarred tail and immaculate lower plumage, but differs from this in\r\nhaving the upper parts nearly black instead of almost white, the upper\r\ntail-coverts deep rufous, like the tail, instead of white, and the lower\r\nparts rufous instead of white; in the rufous lower plumage and very dark\r\nupper parts, it closely resembles var. _costaricensis_[90] of Central\r\nAmerica and Southern Mexico, but the latter has a barred tail, entirely\r\ncontinuous black above, plain white throat patch, and other minor\r\ndifferences, besides having a quite different young plumage. As to the\r\nyoung plumage of var. _lucasanus_, I cannot find any character by which\r\nit can with certainty be distinguished from that of var. _calurus_.\r\n\r\n\r\nVar. calurus, CASSIN.\r\n\r\nWESTERN RED-TAIL; BLACK RED-TAIL.\r\n\r\n  _Buteo calurus_, CASSIN, Proc.

The lightest styles as distinguished from var.\r\n_borealis_ always have the tibiæ barred with rufous; the crissum, also,\r\nis generally barred, on the throat the blackish-brown predominates, and\r\nthe tail has more or less perfect bars to the roots of the feathers;\r\ngenerally, however, these are merely indicated by projections from the\r\nshafts.\r\n\r\nThe extreme condition of this is the melanistic form which Mr. Cassin\r\ndescribed as “_Buteo calurus_”; the darkest example of which (5,481,\r\nPetaluma, Cal.; E. Samuels) is entirely blackish-brown, wings and\r\nscapulars with feathers somewhat paler at tips; breast inclining to dark\r\nsepia-brown, the feathers with black shaft-streaks; tibial feathers\r\nfaintly tipped with pale grayish-brown; lower tail-coverts tipped and\r\nbarred with rufous; upper tail-coverts deep rufous barred with black;\r\ntail deep chestnut-rufous, the subterminal black band very broad, and\r\nanterior to this are nine or ten imperfect narrower black bands.\r\n\r\nThese fuliginous examples have always a more or less appreciably lighter\r\npectoral area, corresponding to the white of this region seen in the\r\nlighter styles.\r\n\r\nOf this race, almost each individual has its own characteristic\r\nmarkings, and scarcely two are to be found alike in a very large series\r\nfrom Western North America. All the specimens from the Rocky Mountains\r\nto the Pacific, and from the table-lands of Mexico, as well as from Cuba\r\nand Jamaica, are referrible to this variety, although we are not aware\r\nthat in the latter region the bird ever becomes black. In the latter\r\nisland this species (as is also the case with many other birds) seems to\r\nbe remarkably subject to albinism. In the peninsula of Lower California\r\nit is replaced by the var. _lucasanus_, and in Central America by\r\nthe very different var. _costaricensis_; from both of which it may\r\nbe distinguished by the numerous transverse rufous bars crossing the\r\nposterior under parts, which character serves also to distinguish the\r\nlightest examples from the eastern typical _borealis_.\r\n\r\nA specimen (50,761; Colonel Grayson) from the Socorro Island, S. W.\r\nMexico, is like some Fort Tejon specimens.\r\n\r\nNo. 41,759 (immature), Merida, Yucatan (Dr. Schott), is remarkably\r\nlight colored, or, rather, is unusually variegated with whitish above;\r\nthe tail, also, is almost white; the bands, however, very conspicuous.\r\nThe lower parts are as thickly spotted as in specimens from Washington\r\nTerritory.\r\n\r\nThe young bird of this western style is as different from that of the\r\neastern as is the adult, and the essential differences are about the\r\nsame,—i.e. darker colors, or a predominance, or, rather, increase in\r\nsize, of the dark markings. The numerous heavy transverse spots on\r\nthe tibia constitute a persistent feature of the young of the var.\r\n_calurus_, as compared with the almost, or perfectly, immaculate white\r\nof those in var. _borealis_.\r\n\r\nIt being certain that the _Buteo montanus_ of Nuttall is really the _B.\r\nswainsoni_, and not the variety of _borealis_ so called by Mr. Cassin,\r\nit becomes necessary to drop this name in connection with the present\r\nbird, and transfer it as a synonyme to _swainsoni_. In its place, Mr.\r\nCassin’s name _calurus_ must be substituted, under which was described\r\nthe melanistic condition of the present variety of _borealis_.\r\n\r\nIn describing his _B. montanus_, Nuttall cites Audubon’s plate of\r\n“_Falco buteo_,” which, of course, is a name by which the _B. swainsoni_\r\nwas first designated before it was distinguished from the _B. vulgaris_\r\nof Europe. Audubon’s plate represents, unmistakably, the adult female of\r\nthe _Buteo swainsoni_.\r\n\r\nHABITS. The well-known Red-tailed Hawk is widely distributed throughout\r\nNorth America from the West Indies and Central America to the Arctic\r\nregions, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific.\r\n\r\nAccording to Sir John Richardson, it is common in the fur countries,\r\nwhich it visits in summer, and where a few are known to breed. Specimens\r\nwere taken by his party on the Rocky Mountains, the plains of the\r\nSaskatchewan, and at the York factory. These were all between the 53d\r\nand the 57th parallels of latitude.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Buteo borealis_ (adult).]\r\n\r\nMr. Salvin cites it as generally and plentifully distributed throughout\r\nGuatemala, from whence numerous examples in all stages of plumage, from\r\nthe young to the adult, were transmitted by Mr. Skinner. It was also\r\nfound at Dueñas by him. Mr. Swainson states that this Hawk was taken on\r\nthe plains of Mexico by Mr. Taylor. A single specimen was received by\r\nMr. Lawrence from Panama. Mr. Gosse states that it is the most common\r\nbird of this family in Jamaica, where it is a resident, and where it\r\nbreeds. Mr. Lembeye and Dr. Gundlach both include it in their lists of\r\nthe birds of Cuba, and the latter marks it as breeding in that island.\r\nIt has been observed in Florida by Mr. Allen, and is not uncommon in all\r\nthe New England States, where it is resident throughout the year. In the\r\nSouthern States it is most abundant in the winter months.\r\n\r\nSpecimens of this bird are recorded in the government reports as\r\nobtained from the Yellowstone, from the Pecos River in Texas, and from\r\nFort Fillmore in New Mexico. Mr. Dresser found it common throughout\r\nall of Texas in all seasons of the year, breeding in all parts, but\r\npreferring the heavily timbered country. He obtained its eggs from\r\nSysterdale and from the Medina River.\r\n\r\nThis Hawk is a strong and powerful bird, with a firm, steady, and\r\nprotracted flight, frequently at a great elevation, and often moving\r\nquite a distance without any apparent motion of the wings. It is said\r\nto generally descend upon its prey from some fixed position, as the\r\nbranch of a tree, and rarely to dart upon it when flying. It is a\r\ncautious bird, and rarely ventures near a house for poultry except when\r\nthe dwelling is isolated and near its own haunts. It preys chiefly upon\r\nsmall quadrupeds, small birds, and reptiles. It usually darts upon a\r\nsnake from the branch of a tree, and seizing it near the head bears it\r\nwrithing through the air. In the valley of the Saskatchewan, Richardson\r\nstates that it watches for the marmots, and when one imprudently\r\nventures from its burrow, darts upon it, bears it a short distance off,\r\nand tears it to pieces.\r\n\r\nAs they fly, these birds utter a very peculiar and unpleasantly harsh\r\ncry or scream, which they repeat very frequently. Capt. Blakiston\r\nobserved this at the Red River settlement, and speaks of it as the\r\nSquealing Hawk.\r\n\r\nThough said to be thus generally cautious in exposing itself to danger\r\nin approaching a poultry-yard, it is not always thus cautious. Mr.\r\nDownes mentions an instance where one of these birds entered a garden in\r\nHalifax to pounce upon a tame Crow, and was captured alive by the owner.\r\n\r\nMr. Audubon states that after rearing their young they no longer\r\nremain mated, but separate and evince rather jealous hostility to each\r\nother than good-will. When one has taken any prey in sight of another,\r\nthe latter will pursue and struggle with it for possession of the\r\nplunder. In these fights they scream vociferously while struggling for\r\npossession.\r\n\r\nIn the Southern States these Hawks begin to build in February; in the\r\nMiddle States, from March the 24th to April 15th; and in New England\r\nusually from April to May. They construct a large nest, composed\r\nexternally of coarse sticks and twigs, and lined with dried grasses,\r\nmoss, and leaves, built for the most part in the fork of a lofty tree.\r\nThe eggs are usually four in number.\r\n\r\nMr. Augustus Fowler of Danvers, who is familiar with the habits of this\r\nbird, writes me that in Massachusetts they usually begin to build their\r\nnests about the first of April, selecting some tall tree near the middle\r\nof the woods, the branches of which form a crotch near its trunk. To\r\nthis chosen spot the female carries a sufficient quantity of sticks for\r\nits outside (the male taking no very active part in the matter), and for\r\nits inside she uses the bark from the dead branches of the chestnut,\r\nwhich she beats and pecks to pieces with her bill, making it soft and\r\npliable, or gathers the fallen leaves of the pine, or some other soft\r\nmaterial, which she finds conveniently, as a lining, which is about one\r\ninch in thickness. It is thirteen inches in diameter from outside to\r\noutside, and seven inches in diameter on the inside, while its depth\r\nis two and a half inches. The female usually lays five eggs, which are\r\nspherical, of a dirty-white color, and marked with large blotches of\r\nbrown; on some they cover almost the whole egg, while others are marked\r\nmostly on the large end, and some even of the same nest are so faintly\r\nmarked as to appear almost wholly white. They are 2.12 inches in length\r\nand 1.95 in diameter.\r\n\r\nIn Jamaica, according to Mr. March, these Hawks do not confine\r\nthemselves to any particular mode or place for breeding, height seeming\r\nto be their chief object. He has found their nest in a quite accessible\r\ntree, not more than twenty feet from the ground, and near a frequented\r\npath. In another instance a pair nested for several years on the roof\r\nof the turret of the belfry of the Spanishtown Cathedral church. The\r\nnest he describes as a platform of dry sticks, more than a foot across\r\nand two or three inches thick. The bed of the nest is about six inches\r\nacross and two deep, of fine inner bark, grass, and leaves, containing\r\nfour or five eggs, nearly spherical, measuring 2.25 by 2.75 inches, of a\r\ndirty or clayish white, dashed with blotches and spots of vandyke-brown\r\nand umber, often running with a light shade into the ground-color.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of the Red-tail exhibit great variations in nearly every\r\nrespect except their shape, which is pretty uniformly a spheroidal-oval.\r\nTheir ground-color varies from white to a dingy rusty drab, their\r\nmarkings vary greatly in colors, shades, size, frequency, and\r\ndistribution. In some the markings are small, few, and light, and the\r\negg appears to be of an almost homogeneous brownish-white. In others\r\nthe ground is completely concealed by large and confluent blotches of\r\ndeep and dark purplish-brown, burnt umber, and a peculiar shade known as\r\nDutch umber. In some the markings are distributed in fine and frequent\r\ngranulations, diffused over the entire surface of the egg, producing\r\nthe effect of a color of uniform umber brown, through which the ground\r\nof yellowish-white can only be traced by a magnifying-glass. Four eggs\r\nin my cabinet average 2.22 inches in length by 1.72 in breadth. The\r\nlargest egg measures 2.55 by 1.90 inches; the smallest, 2.10 by 1.70.\r\nThe capacity of the largest to the smallest is nearly as five to four.\r\n\r\nThe season in which this Hawk deposits its eggs varies considerably. Mr.\r\nJackson of West Chester, Penn., gives March 24 the earliest, and April\r\n15 the latest, in which he has met with its fresh eggs.\r\n\r\nMr. Ridgway obtained two eggs of this Hawk at Mount Carmel, Ill., on\r\nthe 6th of March, the nest having been commenced early in February. It\r\nwas placed on the summit of a black-gum tree (_Nyssa multiflora_), and\r\nrested upon the topmost branches, about ninety feet from the ground.\r\nIt was lined with corn-husks, gathered from a field close by. The eggs\r\n(No. 12,740, S. I. Collection) measure, respectively, 2.45 and 2.50 in\r\nlength, by 1.95 and 2.00 in breadth. Their color is plain bluish-white,\r\nentirely free from markings of any kind.\r\n\r\nIn California, the var. _calurus_ is stated to be common in all parts\r\nof the State not destitute of trees, and to reside permanently wherever\r\nfound, pairing only during the breeding-season. They prey upon hares\r\nand other small quadrupeds, upon smaller birds, and upon reptiles.\r\nDr. Cooper states that at times, when food is plenty, they become\r\nexcessively fat. They are known to occasionally seize a fowl from the\r\nfarm-yard. During the middle of the day, in the cold weather, they are\r\nsaid to soar very high in the air, and occasionally to disappear also in\r\nthe manner of their eastern relatives, the _Buteo borealis_. They are\r\nsaid to be abundant and resident species in Washington Territory, having\r\nbeen found by Dr. Suckley quite numerous at Puget Sound, but scarcer\r\non the Upper Columbia, east of the Cascade Mountains. It seems to be\r\nmore daring than is common with the _borealis_, for Dr. Suckley states\r\nthat while he was stationed at Fort Steilacoom he noticed that the\r\npoultry-yards were as much harassed by this Hawk as by the Goshawk, not\r\nhesitating to seize poultry from the very doors of the dwelling-houses.\r\n\r\nDr. Kennerly states that this Hawk was met with by him between the coast\r\nof Texas at Indianola, and the Rio Grande at El Paso del Norte. It\r\nseemed to feed indifferently upon reptiles, particularly lizards, and\r\nthe smaller quadrupeds and birds.\r\n\r\nDr. Cooper states that the nests of this species are numerous in the\r\nvalleys and on the lower mountains of California. They are generally\r\nbuilt in the forks of a sycamore or other large trees, and formed of\r\ntwigs pretty finely constructed, and with a very distinct cavity. Eggs,\r\ntaken by Dr. Cooper near San Diego, were laid about the 20th of March,\r\nand were three in number. They measured 2.28 by 1.76 inches, were\r\nof a dull yellowish-white, with faint brown spots. While Dr. Cooper\r\nwas climbing to the nest, the old birds darted towards him from a\r\nneighboring bluff, but when within a few feet of his head they turned\r\naway and did not attempt to make an assault.\r\n\r\nTwo eggs belonging to the variety _calurus_ were obtained by Mr. E.\r\nSamuels near Petaluma, Cal., in 1856; measure 2.31 inches in length by\r\n1.87 in breadth. The shape of one egg is an almost exact ovoid, slightly\r\ntending to a spheroid, one end being hardly perceptibly larger than the\r\nother. Its ground-color is a very light buff, the spottings and markings\r\ngiving to it the effect of a yellowish-white. It is marked over the\r\nentire surface with blotches, dashes, and lines of a light tint of a\r\nbrown tending to vandyke. These are mixed with markings of a lighter\r\npurplish-brown. The markings, of both shades, are chiefly oblong in\r\nshape, and run with the length of the egg. They bear no resemblance to\r\nany eggs of the _B. borealis_ that I have ever seen, and are unlike\r\nthose of other Hawks so far as I am aware. It was built on the top of\r\na large evergreen-oak, at least seventy feet from the ground, and was\r\nconstructed entirely of large, coarse sticks, lined with a few stray\r\nfeathers. The male bird was shot as it flew from the nest, which was so\r\nhidden by the thick branches that it would have escaped detection.\r\n\r\nThe black form of this species was first described by Mr. Cassin as\r\n_Buteo calurus_, in 1855, from a specimen procured by Dr. Henry near\r\nFort Webster, New Mexico. In this plumage it was afterwards met with\r\nby Mr. Emanuel Samuels, near Petaluma, in California, who found it\r\nbreeding, and was fortunate enough to secure the parent bird on its\r\nnest.\r\n\r\nThe nest was built near the top of an evergreen-oak, at the height of\r\nabout sixty feet from the ground, and contained two eggs just on the\r\npoint of hatching. It was constructed of sticks, and was lined with\r\nmoss. Both birds were about the spot. The male bird, manifesting much\r\nmore courage than his mate in resistance to the intruders, was shot. The\r\nfemale was wounded, but escaped.\r\n\r\nOne of these eggs measures 2.25 inches in length by 1.79 in breadth.\r\nIts capacity is considerably less than that of the specimens just\r\ndescribed; its shape is a much more oblong-oval; one end is evidently\r\nmore pointed than the other. Its ground-color is a dirty cream-white,\r\ncovered, chiefly at the larger end, with blotches and smaller markings\r\nof a dark shade of a brown almost exactly corresponding with that known\r\nas vandyke-brown, with smaller markings and spottings of a lighter shade\r\nof the same. The latter are distributed at intervals over its entire\r\nsurface.\r\n\r\nA nest, found by Mr. Xantus near Fort Tejon, is stated by him to have\r\nbeen found in a swamp. It was built in a water-oak, was about fifteen\r\nfeet from the ground. The nest was very large and was built of coarse\r\nsticks. It contained four eggs.\r\n\r\n\r\nButeo harlani (AUDUBON).\r\n\r\nHARLAN’S HAWK; “BLACK WARRIOR.”\r\n\r\n  _Falco harlani_, AUD. B. Am. 1831, pl. xxxvi; IB. Orn. Biog.

S. 1866, 43).\r\n\r\nThere is not a doubt in my mind as to the propriety of separating this\r\nbird from any close relationship to the _B. borealis_, nor of the\r\ncorrectness of considering it the _B. harlani_ of Audubon. It only can\r\nbe referred to Audubon’s plate and description, both of which agree\r\nperfectly with the younger plumage described.\r\n\r\nThe specimens Mr. Cassin describes as the “adult” _B. harlani_ are\r\nreally such; but those which he describes as the “young” are the\r\nyoung of the Western Red-tail (_B. borealis_ var. _calurus_). The\r\nCalifornia specimens to which Mr. Cassin refers, as identified by Mr.\r\nLawrence as _B. harlani_, are in reality the melanistic condition of _B.\r\nswainsoni_, or the “_insignatus_” of Cassin. The present bird appears to\r\nbe restricted to Louisiana, Texas, New Mexico, and adjacent portions,\r\nnorth to Kansas, and probably Eastern Mexico.\r\n\r\nHABITS. This Hawk was first described by Audubon from a pair obtained by\r\nhim near St. Francisville, Louisiana. They had bred in that neighborhood\r\nfor two seasons, were shy and difficult of approach, and for a long\r\nwhile eluded his pursuit. The female was shot while sailing over his\r\nhead, and wounded in the wing. He endeavored to preserve it alive and to\r\ncarry it as a present to the Zoölogical Society, but it refused all food\r\nand died in a few days. This specimen is now in the British Museum. The\r\nmale bird was also obtained a few days later, and this too was brought\r\nto him yet alive but also wounded. It was even more fierce and wilder\r\nthan the female, would erect the feathers on its head, open its bill,\r\nand prepare to strike with its talons when any object was brought near\r\nto it.\r\n\r\nThis species, though smaller than the Red-tail, to which he regarded it\r\nas allied, Audubon thought greatly superior to it in flight and daring.\r\nIts flight is described as rapid, greatly protracted, and so powerful\r\nas to enable it to seize the prey with apparent ease, or effect its\r\nescape from its stronger antagonist, the Red-tail, which pursued it on\r\nall occasions. It had been seen to pounce upon a fowl, kill it almost\r\ninstantly, and afterwards drag it along the ground several hundred\r\nyards. It was not seen to prey on hares or squirrels, but seemed to\r\nevince a marked preference for poultry, partridges, and the smaller\r\nspecies of wild duck. He saw none of the young, but was told that they\r\nappeared to be of a leaden-gray color at a distance, and at the approach\r\nof winter became as dark as their parents.\r\n\r\nMr. Dresser states that he noticed this bird on several occasions near\r\nSan Antonio but was not fortunate enough to shoot one. He received\r\none specimen that had been shot by a lad on the Medina River. He was\r\ninformed by a man living near there, who was a good sportsman and a\r\ncareful observer, that he had several times found their nests, and Dr.\r\nHeermann is said to have obtained the eggs there several years before.\r\nDr. Coues did not meet with it in Arizona, where it probably, however,\r\nwill yet be found. Specimens have been received from Mexico, as is\r\nstated by Cassin, and a Buzzard, which Mr. Salvin referred to this\r\nspecies, was seen by him near Dueñas, where it was by no means common.\r\n\r\nA specimen of this species has recently been taken in Kansas, near\r\nLawrence, as recorded by Professor Snow, and fully identified at the\r\nSmithsonian Institution.\r\n\r\n\r\nButeo cooperi, CASSIN.\r\n\r\nCOOPER’S RED-TAILED HAWK.\r\n\r\n  _Buteo cooperi_, CASS.

Head, neck, and whole lower parts white; feathers of the head\r\nand neck with medial longitudinal streaks of black, the white prevailing\r\non the occiput and superciliary region,—the black predominating over\r\nthe cheeks, forming a “mustache”; throat with fine lanceolate blackish\r\nstreaks; sides of the breast with broader, more cuneate markings of the\r\nsame; flanks with narrow, lanceolate stripes, these extending sparsely\r\nacross the abdomen; tibiæ, and lower tail-coverts immaculate, the\r\ninner face of the former, however, with faint specks. Upper plumage in\r\ngeneral dark plumbeous-brown, inclining to black on the back; plumbeous\r\nclearest on primaries, which are uniformly of this color, the inner\r\nones inclining to fine cinereous. Scapulars and wing-coverts spattered\r\nwith white beneath the surface. Rump black; upper tail-coverts white\r\ntinged with rufous, and with irregular, distant transverse bars of\r\nblackish. Tail with light rufous prevailing, but this broken up by\r\nlongitudinal daubs and washes of cinereous, and darker mottlings running\r\nlongitudinally on both webs; basally, the ground-color approaches white;\r\ntips white, and a distinct, but very irregular, subterminal band of\r\nblack, into which the longitudinal mottlings melt; outer webs of lateral\r\nfeathers entirely cinereous, and without the black band. Under side of\r\nthe wing white, with a large black space on the lining near the edge;\r\nunder surface of primaries white anterior to their emargination, finely\r\nmottled with ashy, and with indistinct transverse bands terminally.\r\nFourth quill longest; third shorter than fifth; second equal to sixth;\r\nfirst equal to tenth. Wing, 15.75; tail, 9.10; tarsus, 3.25; middle toe,\r\n1.70.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Buteo cooperi_ (adult).]\r\n\r\nThis remarkable Hawk is certainly not to be referred to the _B.\r\nborealis_, as has been suggested, the proportions of the two being quite\r\ndifferent, while there is no similarity of plumage. In plumage, _Buteo\r\ncooperi_ very closely resembles the adult of _Archibuteo ferrugineus_,\r\nand the suggestion has been made that it is a hybrid between this and\r\nthe Red-tail. The markings of the head, and the general tint of the\r\nupper parts, are almost precisely as in the former bird, while the\r\ntail is exactly similar in character of markings, the only difference\r\nbeing the more reddish tinge and black subterminal band, which are, in\r\nfact, the only characters approximating it to the _Buteo borealis_. The\r\nfeet are, however, very much stronger than in the _A. ferrugineus_,\r\nwhile the tarsus is very much longer than in _borealis_, scarcely more\r\nso, however, than in the former. The black patch on the lining of the\r\nwing, however, is a feature shared by neither of these birds, being\r\none entirely peculiar to the _Buteo cooperi_. But one specimen—the one\r\ndescribed above—is known to have been obtained. Mr. J. A. Allen, in\r\nhis “Notes on some of the Rarer Birds of Massachusetts” (see “American\r\nNaturalist,” Vol. III, p. 518, and a separate paper, p. 14), mentions\r\nthe capture of this species near Cambridge, Mass., but probably did not\r\nactually see it. The specimen in question being in the possession of\r\nMr. C. J. Maynard, he kindly sent it to the Smithsonian Institution. On\r\nexamination, it proved to be a young _Buteo lineatus_, differing from\r\nthe average in somewhat lighter colors.\r\n\r\nHAB. Santa Clara County, California.\r\n\r\nThe nearest ally of this species is the _B. ferox_, of the Palæarctic\r\nRealm (Northern Asia and Africa and portions of Europe), which has\r\nexactly the size and proportions of the present bird, and in certain\r\nstages a very similar plumage. I have not seen an unquestionable\r\nadult of _B. ferox_, but specimens almost adult, in the collection of\r\nthe Boston Society of Natural History, from the Himalaya Mountains,\r\ncome remarkably close to _B. cooperi_ in plumage, having like it a\r\nblack spot on the under side of the wing, but apparently on the under\r\nprimary-coverts, instead of on the lining, near the edge; the tail\r\nis also very similarly colored. Upon the whole, I consider the _B.\r\ncooperi_ to be a good species, with _B. ferox_, Gmelin, of Asia, etc.,\r\nas its nearest relative, unless it proves to be a hybrid between _Buteo\r\nborealis_ and _Archibuteo ferrugineus_, which I think is less likely to\r\nbe the case.\r\n\r\nHABITS. A single individual of this bird was shot by Dr. Cooper near\r\nMountain View in Santa Clara Valley, California, in November, 1855.\r\nIt still remains unique in collections, and during his more recent\r\nexplorations Dr. Cooper has not been able to obtain any additional\r\nspecimens or see any like it. Those he mistook for this bird and to\r\nwhich he refers in his report on the birds of Washington Territory, he\r\nis satisfied were only the _Archibuteo ferrugineus_. The suggestion\r\nof Sclater, that the bird is not distinct from _Buteo erythronotus_,\r\nis negatived, according to Mr. Ridgway, by the fact of their actually\r\nbelonging to different sections of the genus.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ARCHIBUTEO, BREHM.\r\n\r\n  _Archibuteo_, BREHM, 1828.

Tarsus densely\r\nfeathered in front and on the sides down to the base of the toes; naked\r\nbehind, where covered with irregular scales. Tarsus more than twice\r\nas long as the middle toe; basal half of the toes covered with small\r\nscales; outer toe longer than the inner; claws long, strongly curved,\r\nacute.

The Old World species, belonging to\r\nthe subgenus (?) _Butaquila_, numbering two or three, according to\r\ndifferent authors, I have not seen, and consequently cannot say whether\r\nthey are really congeneric with the American species or not. Exclusive\r\nof these, two species are known, both of which belong to North America,\r\none of them (_A. lagopus_) being found also in Europe and Africa. These\r\ndiffer very considerably from each other, in the details of external\r\nstructure, probably quite as much as they do from the Asiatic forms\r\nabove mentioned.

CHAR. _Adult male_ (41,719, Fort Whipple, Arizona, Dec. 2, 1864;\r\nDr. Coues). Ground-color of head and neck white; each feather with a\r\nmedial streak of black, these growing broader posteriorly, and along\r\nthe upper border of the ear-coverts are so blended as to form an\r\nindistinct stripe back from the eye. Entire lower parts (except tibia)\r\nand whole under surface of the wing continuous pure white; breast with\r\na faint tinge of delicate ochraceous; tibia and tarsus reddish-white,\r\ntinged with or inclining to deep ferruginous on upper portion, and with\r\nnumerous transverse bars of darker ferruginous and blackish; sides of\r\nthe breast with a very few hair-like shaft-streaks of black; flanks\r\nwith a few distant, dark ferruginous bars; axillars with two or three\r\ncordate spots of ferruginous near ends; feathers of the lining next the\r\nbody, with blended irregularly hastate spots of rufous; under primary\r\ncoverts shading into cinereous on terminal half, and with obscure\r\nbroadly hastate spots of a darker shade of the same; primaries slaty\r\nbeyond their emargination, deepening gradually toward their tips. Back,\r\nscapulars, and lesser and middle wing-coverts fine rufous, each feather\r\nwith a broad median, longitudinal spot of brownish plumbeous-black,\r\nthese on the back rather exceeding the rufous; longer wing-coverts and\r\nsecondaries ashy-umber, with very obsolete transverse bands of darker;\r\nprimary coverts more ashy, and more distinctly banded; primaries fine\r\nchalky cinereous, this lightest on outer four; shafts pure white. Rump\r\nnearly uniform brownish-black,—posterior feathers rufous with medial\r\nblack blotches; upper tail-coverts snowy white on outer webs, inner webs\r\nmore rufous; a few concealed blackish transverse spots. Tail pale pearly\r\nash, becoming white basally, and with a wash of dilute rufous along\r\nthe edge of outer webs; inner webs white, with an ashy tinge thrown in\r\nlongitudinal washes; outer feathers nearly white, with faint pale ashy\r\nlongitudinal mottlings; shafts of tail-feathers pure white. Fourth quill\r\nlongest; third but little shorter; second very much shorter than fifth;\r\nfirst intermediate between seventh and eighth.

Iris clear light yellow; cere, edges of\r\ncommissure, and feet bright yellow; bill very dark bluish horn; mouth,\r\npurplish flesh-color, livid bluish along edges.”\r\n\r\n_Adult female_ (41,720, Fort Whipple; Dr. Coues). Almost exactly like\r\nthe male, but black spots on rufous portions of upper parts much\r\nrestricted, forming oblong spots in the middle of each feather; rump\r\nalmost entirely rufous, variegated, however, with black. Longitudinal\r\nlines on breast more distinct; transverse bars on flanks and abdomen\r\nmore numerous; tibial and tarsal feathers wholly deep rufous or\r\nferruginous, the bars more blackish. Third and fourth quills equal\r\nand longest; second intermediate between fifth and sixth; first equal\r\nto eighth. Wing, 17.25; tail, 9.75; tarsus, 2.95; middle toe, 1.40.\r\n“Length, 23.25; extent, 56.50. Iris light ochraceous-brown.”\r\n\r\n_Young female_ (6,883, Los Angeles, California; Dr. Heermann). General\r\nplumage above, grayish-brown; interscapulars, scapulars, lesser and\r\nmiddle wing-coverts, and feathers of head and neck, edged laterally\r\nwith light rufous; secondaries passing broadly into pale ashy at\r\nends; primaries slaty-brown, with obscure darker bands; no appearance\r\nof these, however, on secondaries; rump entirely blackish-brown;\r\nupper tail-coverts wholly white. Tail hoary slate, basal third (or\r\nmore) white, the junction of the two colors irregular and broken; tip\r\nobscurely paler; feathers obscurely blackish along edges, and with\r\nobsolete transverse spots of the same; white prevailing on inner webs.\r\nBeneath entirely pure white, scarcely variegated; tibiæ and tarsi with\r\na few scattered small transverse spots of blackish; flanks with larger,\r\nmore cordate spots of the same.

One specimen (26,590, ♂; Fort Tejon, Cal.;\r\nJ. Xantus) differs from the adults described in having the abdomen\r\nquite closely barred, the streaks on the breast distinct, the\r\nrufous above tinging the secondary coverts, and spreading over the\r\nupper tail-coverts, while the tibiæ and tarsi are of a very deep\r\nferruginous,—the bars black.\r\n\r\nIn a specimen from the Platte (5,577, ♂; W. S. Wood) white prevails on\r\nthe tibiæ, the bars being dark ferruginous upon a white ground; the\r\nflanks are similarly marked, the other lower parts, however, immaculate;\r\nthere is much concealed white on the scapulars. The rufous tinge of the\r\ntail is very deep, while there is a transverse series of black blotches,\r\nindicating the course of a transverse band near the end.\r\n\r\nHABITS. The California Squirrel Hawk appears to be an exclusively\r\nwestern species, occurring as far to the east as Nebraska and Kansas,\r\nand as far to the north as the Plains of the Saskatchewan and Washington\r\nTerritory. It occurs as far to the southeast as Texas, and has been\r\nfound also in New Mexico and in Arizona.\r\n\r\nThis species was first noticed and described in a paper on the natural\r\nhistory of California published in the Transactions of the Royal Academy\r\nof Berlin, in 1838, by Professor Lichtenstein, a Prussian naturalist. It\r\nwas first brought to the notice of American naturalists by Mr. Edward M.\r\nKern, of Philadelphia, who accompanied Colonel Fremont in his expedition\r\nof 1846, and who brought home specimens.\r\n\r\nDr. Coues found it quite abundant about Fort Whipple, where it was\r\nespecially numerous in the winter, and where also he thinks it probable\r\nthat it is a permanent resident. He found it more generally frequenting\r\nmeadows, plains, and the more open woods. He usually found their\r\nstomachs filled with arvicolæ and other small quadrupeds peculiar to\r\nthat country. It could always be readily recognized by its conspicuously\r\nwhite under parts, contrasted with its dark chesnut tibiæ and reddish\r\nback.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Archibuteo ferrugineus._]\r\n\r\nAt San Pedro, on the southern coast of California, he again found this\r\nHawk very common. It there alights very freely on the ground, where he\r\noften observed it. At Fort Whipple he only saw it on trees. At San Pedro\r\nits choosing thus the bare plain may have been a matter of necessity.\r\n\r\nDr. Kennerly observed a single individual of this species in a\r\n“prairie-dog-town” of large extent, near Fort Davis. It was intently\r\nwatching at the hole of one of these animals. While in this position,\r\nit was observed to strike at the prairie-dog with its claw, when one of\r\nthese animals protruded its head. As it was very intently watching its\r\nprey, it was easily approached and shot.\r\n\r\nDr. Heermann observed this Hawk in the valley of the Sacramento, where\r\nhe thought it rather rare, but afterwards, during his connection\r\nwith the government surveying party under Lieutenant Williamson, in\r\nthe southern part of the State, he found it very abundant. On one\r\noccasion five or six individuals were in view at the same moment,\r\namong the mountains, sixty miles east of San Diego. It was there much\r\nmore abundant than any other species. As large tracts of that country\r\nfrequented by these birds are entirely without trees, they alight on the\r\nground or on some slightly elevated tuft of grass, or a stone, where\r\nthey sit patiently for hours watching for their prey, which was always\r\nfound to consist of mice and other small quadrupeds. In one instance the\r\ncrop was found filled with the remains of a ground squirrel.\r\n\r\nDr. Heermann states that he found the nest and eggs of this bird on the\r\nConsumnes River. The nest was in the fork of an oak, and was composed of\r\ncoarse twigs and lined with grasses; the eggs were two in number, white\r\nwith faint brown dashes. The nest was placed in the centre of a large\r\nbunch of mistletoe, and would have escaped notice had not the Hawk, in\r\nflying, betrayed her retreat.\r\n\r\nThe eggs, however, differ essentially in size from those mentioned\r\nby Capt. Blakiston, and it is quite possible that Dr. Heermann was\r\nmistaken in his identification. One of these eggs was figured in the\r\nNorth American Oölogy, and resembles much more an egg of Swainson’s\r\nBuzzard than any egg I have since seen of this species.\r\n\r\nThe specimens procured by Mr. Kerr were taken in the Tulare Valley,\r\nin January, 1846, and are stated in his notes to have been remarkably\r\nfat, and in excellent condition generally, so that some of his party\r\nshot these birds whenever opportunity offered, for the mess-kettle, and\r\nconsidered them very good eating.\r\n\r\nDr. Cooper states that in the spring and fall these Hawks abound in\r\nSouthern California, migrating in summer through the interior plains\r\nof the Columbia and the Platte Rivers, at least as far north as the\r\nDalles. He found it in winter at Martinez, and is of the opinion that\r\nfew migrate beyond the State. It was usually to be seen slowly sailing\r\nover the plains, sometimes in circles, and occasionally pouncing down\r\nobliquely on its prey, which consists principally of the large ground\r\nsquirrel. It rarely, if ever, attacks poultry, and limits its prey to\r\nwild animals, and is therefore a decided friend to the farmer.\r\n\r\nCapt. Blakiston met with this bird breeding between the north and the\r\nsouth branches of the Saskatchewan River, April 30, 1858. The nest was\r\nplaced in an aspen-tree, twenty feet from the ground, was composed\r\nof sticks, two and a half feet across, and lined with buffalo wool.\r\nThe eggs were four in number. Those taken from another nest near the\r\nsame locality were five in number. This nest was in a tree, and was\r\nonly ten feet above a lake. Two eggs were taken by Mr. Bourgeau on\r\nthe Saskatchewan Plains, July 9. These differences in seasons, from\r\nApril to July, are suggestive either of great variations in the time of\r\nnesting, or of there being two broods in a season. The eggs obtained by\r\nCapt. Blakiston measured, one 2.60 by 2.00 inches, the other 2.50 by\r\n1.95 inches, and are described as having been white with large distinct\r\nblotches and smaller specks of two shades of brown. The other was more\r\nobscurely blotched with a paler brown, and at the same time freckled all\r\nover.\r\n\r\nAn egg of this species taken by H. R. Durkee near Gilmer in Wyoming\r\nTerritory, May 9, 1870, measures 2.43 inches in length by 1.95 in\r\nbreadth. The ground-color is a creamy white, over which are very\r\nuniformly distributed on every part of the egg, in nearly equal\r\nproportions, blotches, plashes, and smaller markings of a dark burnt\r\number. The nest from which this egg was taken was composed of sticks,\r\nand was placed among rocks. The nest contained but one egg. The parent\r\nbird was secured, and there was no question as to identification.\r\n\r\n\r\nArchibuteo lagopus, var. sancti-johannis (PENN.).\r\n\r\nROUGH-LEGGED HAWK; BLACK HAWK.\r\n\r\n  _Falco sancti-johannis_, PENN.

Each phase has its young and adult stages\r\ndistinctly marked, as the above diagnoses point out. It however appears\r\nto be the fact that certain regions are frequented more by birds of one\r\ncolor than another, and of the many hundreds of specimens sent from\r\nthe Arctic regions to the Smithsonian Institution by officers of the\r\nHudson’s Bay Company, none exhibited the blackish plumage which, on the\r\nother hand, appears most abundant about Hudson’s Bay.\r\n\r\nThe North American birds are distinguishable from European ones (var.\r\n_lagopus_) by the characters given in the synopsis on p. 1619, and\r\ndescription, on p. 1624.\r\n\r\nHABITS. The Rough-legged Hawk of North America bears so close a\r\nresemblance to the European species, in all respects,—plumage, habits,\r\nand eggs,—that the two are generally considered to be identical. The\r\ndistribution of the American variety appears to be nearly throughout\r\nthe entire Union, from the Atlantic to the coast of the Pacific, and\r\nfrom New Mexico to the Arctic regions. It was taken at Fort Steilacoom,\r\nand at Shoal-water Bay in Washington Territory, by Drs. Suckley and\r\nCooper. It was not seen by Mr. Dresser in Texas nor by Dr. Woodhouse in\r\nNew Mexico, but it was taken near Zuñi by Dr. Kennerly, was found from\r\nMimbres to the Rio Grande by Dr. Henry, and obtained near Fort Fillmore\r\nby Captain Pope, and at Fort Massachusetts by Dr. Peters.\r\n\r\nThe Rough-legged Hawk is quite abundant in spring and fall in the\r\nneighborhood of Niagara Falls. In the fall of 1872, Mr. James Booth met\r\nwith a pair of this species, accompanied by their young. The latter were\r\nfully grown. The male bird was in very black plumage, while the female\r\nwas unusually light, the pair thus presenting well-marked illustrations\r\nof the two types, the black _sancti-johannis_ and the common _lagopus_.\r\nThe parents were secured, and are now in the museum of the Boston\r\nSociety of Natural History. One of the young was also shot, but I did\r\nnot see it. It was said to have been only a little less dark plumaged\r\nthan the male parent.\r\n\r\nIt is very abundant throughout the Arctic regions, where it was found\r\nbreeding in the Anderson River country by Mr. MacFarlane, from whom were\r\nreceived valuable notes and a large number of specimens of birds and\r\neggs. It was observed generally by Dr. Richardson’s party, but owing to\r\nits extreme wariness only a single specimen was obtained. Richardson\r\nnoted its arrival in the fur countries in April or May, and gives the\r\ntime of its departure as early in October.\r\n\r\nDr. Kennerly mentions finding this Hawk quite abundant in the vicinity\r\nof the Pueblo Zuñi, where it confined itself in the neighborhood of the\r\nstream, watching eagerly for ducks, which seemed to be its favorite\r\nprey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Archibuteo lagopus_ (Europe).]\r\n\r\nDr. Cooper found a large number of these Buzzards on a low point near\r\nthe sea-coasts, at Shoalwater Bay, Washington Territory, in October.\r\nThis point was covered with small pines, on the dead tops of which they\r\nwere observed sitting in the manner of owls. Occasionally one would\r\ndart down after a mouse, and alight a short distance off. At times\r\nthey would call to each other with a loud scream, but they usually sat\r\nmotionless and silent for hours together. Some remained there throughout\r\nthe winter, and he had no doubt that a few build near the mouth of the\r\nColumbia, where he saw young birds in July. In California, the same\r\nwriter states, this species is only a winter visitor, and has never been\r\nobserved by him south of Santa Clara Valley.\r\n\r\nDr. Coues mentions the taking of a single specimen of this bird in the\r\nTerritory of Arizona in the winter, but no others were observed.\r\n\r\nAudubon never met with this species south of North Carolina nor west of\r\nthe Alleghanies. He regarded it as a sluggish bird, confining itself\r\nto the meadows and low grounds bordering the rivers and salt marshes,\r\nwhere its principal food appeared to be moles, mice, and other small\r\nquadrupeds. He has never known it to attack a duck on the wing, although\r\nit will occasionally pursue a wounded one. Except when alarmed, it\r\nflies low and sedately, and manifests none of the daring courage or\r\nvigor so conspicuous in most Hawks. They are also described as somewhat\r\ncrepuscular in habit, watching for their food long after sunset, and\r\nMr. Richardson speaks of their hunting for their prey “by the subdued\r\ndaylight which illuminates even the midnight hours in the high parallels\r\nof latitude.” For these nocturnal hunts it is well fitted by the\r\nsoftness of its plumage, which renders its flight noiseless, like that\r\nof the more nocturnal birds.\r\n\r\nThese birds were once quite abundant in the low lands and marshes in the\r\nvicinity of Boston, but are now comparatively rare. They were abundant\r\nduring October and November, and again in April. They usually kept\r\non or near the ground, appeared to feed chiefly on small quadrupeds\r\nor reptiles, were never known to molest the poultry-yard, or even to\r\ndestroy other birds.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Archibuteo sancti-johannis_ (black plumage).]\r\n\r\nThey were very wary, and when approached with a gun would slowly and\r\ndeliberately move off to a safer distance. Wilson found them quite\r\nabundant, during the winter months, in the meadows on the Delaware and\r\nSchuylkill Rivers, near Philadelphia, where they are still common.\r\nThough rendered very shy by the frequent attempts made to shoot them,\r\nthey would never fly far at a time, usually from one tree to another,\r\nmaking a loud squealing noise as they arose. They all disappeared early\r\nin April.\r\n\r\nHe also speaks of them as common during winter in the lower parts of\r\nMaryland, as well as in the extensive meadows below Newark, N. J. He\r\nmentions having often seen this Hawk coursing over the surface of\r\nmeadows long after sunset, and many times in pairs. They roost near\r\nthese low grounds, and take their station at daybreak near a ditch,\r\nwatching with patient vigilance for their prey.\r\n\r\nWilson, Audubon, and Nuttall appear to have known nothing in regard to\r\nthe breeding of the Rough-legged Hawk. A pair was seen by Richardson at\r\ntheir nest, which was built of sticks, and on a lofty tree standing on\r\na low moist alluvial point of land, in a bend of the Saskatchewan; but\r\nthey were too wary to be shot, and he makes no mention of their eggs.\r\n\r\nMy nephews, H. R. and F. H. Storer, found a pair of Rough-legged Hawks\r\nnesting on a rocky cliff on the coast of Labrador, near the harbor of\r\nBras d’Or. The nest was very rudely constructed of sticks, and placed\r\non a high rock directly over the water, inaccessible from below, but\r\nreadily approached from above. It contained three young birds and an\r\negg. The young Hawks were just ready to fly, and all scrambled out\r\nas the nest was approached, and rolled the egg to the bottom of the\r\ncliff, but without injuring it. The nest contained four or five large\r\nrats peculiar to that region, collected by the old birds for their\r\nyoung. The old birds were in the light plumage. At the same time a young\r\nbird was taken alive from another nest by one of the sailors of their\r\nparty, which was quite black even in its immature dress, and strikingly\r\ndifferent from the young just mentioned.\r\n\r\nMr. MacFarlane’s very complete and careful notes mention, in detail, no\r\nless than fifty-eight nests of this species as procured and identified\r\nby his party. Of these, forty-six were built on trees, generally spoken\r\nof as being large pines, and usually about twenty feet from the ground.\r\nTwelve nests were found built on the edge of steep cliffs of shaly mud\r\non the banks of creeks, rivers, and lakes.\r\n\r\nThe nests that were taken from trees are described as having been built\r\nin a crotch, not far from the top, and to have been formed externally of\r\ndry twigs, sticks, and small branches, warmly lined with down, feathers,\r\nand fine hay. Those found upon cliffs and high river-banks were made\r\nof similar materials, but usually with a smaller base of sticks, and a\r\ngreater supply of hay, moss, and other soft materials. The number of\r\neggs varied from three to five, never more than the latter, and were\r\nat times in differing stages of incubation in the same nest. Whenever\r\nthe nest was approached, the parent birds always manifested great\r\nuneasiness, and uttered vociferous screams of distress. The eggs were\r\ngenerally found from the 27th of May to the 25th of June. Those taken\r\nafter the 20th of June usually contained well-developed embryos. The\r\nspecies was met with by Mr. MacFarlane in great abundance in various\r\nlocalities,—near Fort Anderson, lower down on the Anderson River, near\r\nthe Arctic coast, and in the vicinity of Rendezvous Lake.\r\n\r\nOne of the Indians collecting for Mr. MacFarlane informed him that on\r\nthe 9th of June he discovered the nest of one of these Hawks on a ledge\r\nof shaly mud. As he could not kill the parents, he set a snare about\r\nthe nest. Going to it later in the day, he was disappointed at finding\r\nhis snare set aside, the eggs gone, and the birds not to be seen. He\r\npresumed the parents had removed the eggs, of which there had been\r\nthree, to a safer place. Several nests were also taken on the shores and\r\namong the islets of the Arctic coast, west of Liverpool Bay.\r\n\r\nThe egg of the Rough-legged Hawk taken by the Storers in Labrador\r\nmeasures 2.06 inches in length by 1.88 in breadth, and is nearly\r\nspherical. The ground-color is a soiled white or a light drab, and is\r\nmarked with a few faint, ill-defined spots of light umber, distributed\r\nat intervals over the entire surface.\r\n\r\nTwo European specimens in my collection are so nearly like the American\r\nthat the same description would answer for both. They are a trifle\r\nlarger, but their color and markings are exactly the same. These eggs\r\nvary from 2.25 to 2.12 inches in length, and the breadth of each is\r\n1.75 inches. In one specimen the ground-color is of a deeper shade of\r\ndingy-white, with larger blotches, and its purplish-slate markings are\r\nintermingled with those of umber. A fourth, from Switzerland, varies\r\nfrom most others of this species, and is marked over a cream-colored\r\nground with very numerous and quite large blotches of different shades\r\nof umber and sepia-brown. It measures 2.25 by 1.93 inches.\r\n\r\nSix eggs taken by Mr. MacFarlane have an average length of 2.18 and\r\nan average breadth of 1.79 inches. Their greatest length is 2.24, and\r\ntheir least 2.12 inches. There is but very little variation in their\r\nbreadth, or only from 1.76 to 1.80 inches. Occasionally these eggs are\r\nof a nearly uniform dingy-white, nearly unmarked, and only by very faint\r\ncloudings. These cases are rare. Generally they have a creamy-white\r\nground and are boldly marked with blotches of a varying intensity of\r\number or sepia-brown. Intermingled with these are obscure markings of a\r\npurplish-slate.\r\n\r\nThe dark variety of the Rough-legged Falcon, recognized by some as the\r\n_A. sancti-johannis_, Mr. Ridgway is disposed to regard as rather an\r\nindividual melanism of the common species, rather than as a distinctive\r\nrace. In this form it appears to be quite generally distributed over the\r\ncontinent, rather in isolated pairs than as a common bird. It was not\r\ntaken on the Anderson River by Mr. MacFarlane, where the _lagopus_ style\r\nwas extremely common, hundreds of skins having been sent by him to the\r\nSmithsonian Institution.\r\n\r\nThe dark-colored birds are seen occasionally in Massachusetts in the\r\nwinter season, and are usually found frequenting low alluvial tracts\r\nin search of small quadrupeds and frogs, and occasionally well-marked\r\nspecimens have been secured in the neighborhood of Boston. A pair was\r\nfound breeding near the mouth of the Kennebec River in Maine, and the\r\neggs were secured. They were not readily distinguishable from those\r\nof the common Rough-legged Hawk. It is also said, on the authority of\r\nMr. John Krider of Philadelphia, to have been found breeding in New\r\nJersey, and the eggs taken. The parent bird was not secured. These eggs\r\nresembled well-marked eggs of the _lagopus_. Wilson, who observed birds\r\nin this plumage on the marshy banks of the Delaware, describes them as\r\nremarkably shy and wary, frequenting river-banks, and feeding on mice,\r\nmoles, and other small game, sailing a good deal and at a great height,\r\nwhich is not the habit of the _lagopus_, and was seen by him to kill a\r\nDuck while on the wing. It has been seen to sit for an hour at a time\r\non a stake by the side of marshes, in an almost perpendicular position,\r\nas if dozing. It flies with great ease, and occasionally with great\r\nswiftness, and rarely with any flapping of the wings; was most numerous\r\non the Delaware in the winter, but was occasionally to be seen there in\r\nthe summer. Such is Wilson’s account of its habits as observed by him,\r\nand these are partially confirmed by Nuttall from his own observations.\r\nIt is, however, quite probable that they are mistaken in claiming an\r\nessential or specific difference in the habits of the two former. Mr.\r\nAudubon regarded it as the adult of the _lagopus_, and appears not to\r\nhave been familiar with its habits.\r\n\r\nCaptain Blakiston mentions the occurrence of the dark bird on the\r\nSaskatchewan Plains, where the parent bird and three eggs were obtained\r\nby M. Bourgeau, a French collector, in the summer of 1858, and where it\r\nis spoken of as not uncommon. Mr. Andrew Murray, in his Contributions\r\nto the Natural History of the Hudson Bay Territories, records specimens\r\nfrom Hudson Bay and the country lying between its western shore and\r\nLake Winnipeg. Dr. Gambel speaks of this bird as common in California.\r\nDr. Cooper refers to one obtained by Mr. Lorquin at San Francisco. Mr.\r\nLawrence cites it among the birds of New York. Mr. Boardman gives it as\r\nrare near Calais. Mr. Verrill also gives it among the birds of Western\r\nMaine, where the _lagopus_ was not observed, but where this form was a\r\nregular winter visitant.\r\n\r\nThe Storers found the Black Hawk not uncommon on the cliffs near Bras\r\nd’Or, and their observations of its habits, as contrasted with those of\r\nthe still more common Rough-legged Hawk, left no doubt in their mind\r\nof their specific distinction. While the Black Hawk was observed to be\r\na bold, vigorous, and spirited bird, easy and swift in its motions,\r\nand preying upon other birds while on the wing, the Rough-legged was\r\ncomparatively sluggish, inoffensive, and subsisted only upon rats, mice,\r\nmoles, frogs, and other small game. A nest containing young birds was\r\nfound, and one of the latter caught alive. Both old and young were in\r\nthe same black plumage. The young Hawk was fierce and intractable, and\r\nits whole air and manner were utterly unlike the conduct of the young\r\nof the other species. Unfortunately, it broke from its confinement and\r\nescaped.\r\n\r\nThe eggs from New Jersey, attributed to this bird by Mr. Krider, vary\r\nin the number and depth of coloring of their markings, the blotches in\r\none being darker and less generally distributed. They measure 2.06 by\r\n1.69 inches. Their ground-color is a yellowish white, intermingled with\r\nwhich are faint markings and blotches of a brownish-purple. Over these\r\nare diffused confluent blotches of russet-brown.\r\n\r\nAn egg from near Wiscasset, taken by Edmund Smith, Esq., the parent of\r\nwhich was secured, measures 2.22 by 1.75 inches, has a white ground, and\r\nis marked and blotched with deep umber-brown. These markings are chiefly\r\nat one end and only vary in their depth, and are unmixed with any other\r\nshading or colors.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS AQUILA, AUCTORUM.\r\n\r\n  _Aquila_, MŒHR. 1752.

CHAR. Form robust and structure powerful; the bearing and general\r\naspect that of _Buteo_ and _Archibuteo_. Wing long, the primaries long\r\nand strong, with their emarginations very deep. Tail rather short,\r\nslightly rounded or wedge-shaped. Bill stronger than in the preceding\r\ngenera, its outlines nearly parallel, and the tip somewhat inclined\r\nbackward at the point; commissure with a more or less prominent festoon;\r\nnostril narrowly oval, vertical; skin of the cere very hard and firm.\r\nSuperciliary shield very prominent. Feet very strong, the membrane\r\nbetween the outer and middle toes very well developed; tarsus less than\r\ntwice as long as the middle toe; outer toe equal to, or longer than, the\r\ninner; claws very long and strong, very much graduated in size; scutellæ\r\nof the toes small except on the terminal joint, where they form broad\r\ntransverse plates; tarsi densely feathered all round down to the base\r\nof the toes; tibial plumes well developed, loose-webbed, their ends\r\nreaching down to or beyond the base of the toes. Feathers of the nape\r\nand occiput lanceolate, acute, and distinct, forming a nuchal “cape”\r\nof differently formed feathers. Third to fifth quill longest; first\r\nshorter than the seventh; outer five or six with their inner webs deeply\r\nemarginated.\r\n\r\nThis genus is almost peculiar to the Old World, where about seventeen\r\nso-called species are known, while America has no member of the genus\r\nexclusively its own, the single North American species being the same\r\nas the European one. Though the details of external structure vary\r\nsomewhat, and the size ranges from that of a _Buteo_ to that of a\r\nsea-eagle (_Haliaëtus_), the generic characters given in the above\r\ndiagnosis apply well to all the species. The species of _Heteropus_,\r\nHodgson, 1842 (_A. malayensis_, REIN. and _H. gurneyi_, Gray), I\r\nremove entirely from _Aquila_, since they differ so strikingly in many\r\nimportant respects. With the general aspect of _Aquila_, _Heteropus_\r\nhas the outer toe disproportionately shorter than the inner (instead\r\nof equal to it, or longer), which curious feature it shares only\r\nwith _Geranospiza_ of tropical America, and _Polyboroides_ of South\r\nAfrica,—both terrestrial _Buteonine_ forms of specialized structure.\r\nAn entirely peculiar feature of _Heteropus_ is the great length and\r\nstraightness of the claws. Its bill is more like that of _Archibuteo_\r\nthan like that of _Aquila_.\r\n\r\nThe North American and European races of the single species which occurs\r\non the former continent may be distinguished as follows:—\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecies and Races.\r\n\r\n  =A. chrysaëtus.= Wing, 23.00–27.00; tail, 14.00–16.00; culmen,\r\n  1.50–1.90; tarsus, 3.40–4.20; middle toe, 2.40–3.10.

The Ring-tailed or Golden Eagle of North America is found\r\nthroughout the continent from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and from New\r\nMexico to the higher Arctic regions.\r\n\r\nIn its geographical distribution, the Golden Eagle of North America\r\nappears to be chiefly confined to the mountainous regions, and the more\r\nnorthern portions, but to be nowhere abundant. Sir John Richardson saw\r\nbut few individuals in the Arctic regions, nor does he appear ever to\r\nhave met with its nest. Individual birds on the Atlantic coast have\r\nbeen occasionally obtained,—once as far south as Philadelphia, twice\r\nat Washington,—but very rarely. Several specimens appear to have been\r\nobtained among the mountains of New Mexico by Dr. Henry’s party.\r\n\r\nAlthough not mentioned by either Dr. Heermann or Dr. Gambel in their\r\nlists of the birds of California, it was found in Oregon by Dr.\r\nTownsend, and is said by Dr. Cooper to be quite common in almost all\r\nparts of California during the colder months. It is, however, much less\r\nnumerous than the White-headed Eagle. It is very much more a mountain\r\nbird, and its descent into the plains or to the sea-coast is said to be\r\nquite rare. Dr. Adolphus Heermann, in his Report of the survey between\r\nFort Yuma and San Francisco, speaks of seeing one of these birds near\r\nLivermore Pass, and of meeting others in Northern California, and of an\r\nindividual killed in the mountains near Mokelumne River. He regarded\r\nit, both in that state and elsewhere, as a rare and wild bird. It is\r\nnot mentioned as occurring in Greenland. It was found breeding in Napa\r\nValley, Cal., by Mr. F. Gruber.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Aquila chrysaëtus._]\r\n\r\nA bird was secured alive in Brighton, near Boston, in 1837, by being\r\ntaken in a trap which had been set for another purpose. Its occurrence,\r\nhowever, near the sea-coast, is very rare, and even among the mountains\r\nit is never found except in occasional pairs. It breeds in the\r\nmountainous portions of Maine, New Hampshire, Vermont, and New York,\r\nand was formerly not unfrequent among the cliffs of the Hudson River.\r\nSteamboats and railroads have, however, driven this wild bird from\r\nits romantic retreats in that quarter. In Franconia, N. H., for quite\r\na number of years, a pair occupied a nest on an inaccessible rock,\r\nnear the top of a mountain, known as Eagle Cliff, in sight of, and\r\nopposite, the Profile House. Repeated efforts have been made to reach\r\nits nest, but thus far without success. In the summer of 1855 a renewed\r\nattempt was made to scale the precipice over which the shelving rock,\r\non which the nest stands, projects. A party was formed, and although\r\nthey succeeded in ascending the mountain, which had never been achieved\r\nbefore, they could reach only a point beyond and above, not the nest\r\nitself. The attempt to pass to it was abandoned as too perilous. The\r\nparty reported a large collection of bones in its immediate vicinity,\r\nwith other evidences of the accumulated plunder of many years, as well\r\nas a plentiful supply of fresh food at the time visited.\r\n\r\nWithout here seeking to affect the question of identity of species, it\r\nis interesting to note certain peculiarities in the European Golden\r\nEagle so far not noticed or of rare occurrence in the American birds.\r\nMr. I. W. P. Orde in the Ibis of 1861 (p. 112), gives a very interesting\r\naccount of a pair of Golden Eagles, which the previous season built\r\ntheir nest in a large Scotch fir-tree, in a wood on the southern bank\r\nof Glen Lyon, in Perthshire, within a few hundred yards of Meggerine\r\nCastle. Four eggs were laid, two of which were hatched. The nest was\r\none of the Eagles’ own construction, and is specially interesting from\r\nbeing in such near proximity to human habitations. Mr. Tristram (Ibis,\r\n1859, p. 283, in his valuable note on the birds of North Africa), while\r\nhe never observed this Eagle in any of the cliffs among the mountain\r\nranges of the desert, found it almost gregarious, so abundant was it\r\namong the Dayets. In one wood he saw no less than seven pairs of the\r\nEagles, each pair with a nest. There were, besides, many unoccupied\r\nnests, and, indeed, very few terebinths of any size were without a huge\r\nplatform of sticks on the topmost boughs. The birds were undisturbed,\r\nand consequently very fearless. On the other hand Mr. Salvin, in the\r\nsame volume (p. 180) among the mountains of Eastern Atlas, describes\r\nvery different manner of life in the same birds. “Whatever rock a\r\npair may choose for their eyrie, there they reign alone in dignified\r\nsolitude, nor do they allow a single Vulture, Kite, or indeed any other\r\nspecies of rapacious bird, to occupy with their nest a single spot in\r\nthe same rock, however eligible for the purpose; nor are these other\r\nspecies ever to be seen in the haunts of their exclusive majesties. The\r\nwhole southern precipice at Djebel Dekma was thus tenanted by a single\r\npair of this Eagle, as also several other rocks that came under our\r\nnotice. Instances of the Golden Eagle building in trees were by no means\r\nof unfrequent occurrence.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =12006=, ♀. NAT. SIZE.\r\n\r\n_Aquila canadensis._]\r\n\r\nThe extreme southern range of the European bird, its gregarious habit,\r\nand the frequency of its building in trees, are all peculiarities not\r\nobserved in the American form. They are not necessarily conclusive, but\r\nare at least suggestive.\r\n\r\nThe Golden Eagle in this country usually constructs its nest on the\r\nsides of steep, rocky crags, where its materials are coarsely heaped\r\ntogether on a projecting shelf of rock. These consist of large sticks,\r\nloosely arranged, and lined with other softer materials. In rare\r\ninstances they are said to build on trees, where rocky cliffs are not\r\nto be met with. The eggs are usually three in number; sometimes two, or\r\nonly one. Mr. Audubon describes them as measuring 3.50 inches in length\r\nby 2.50 in breadth; the shell thick and smooth, dull white, brushed\r\nover with undefined patches of brown, which are most numerous at the\r\nlarger end. This description is not quite accurate in regard to size.\r\nThe European egg is presumed to be larger than the American, yet the\r\nlargest I have ever seen measures but 3.19 inches in length by 2.31 in\r\nbreadth. An egg of the European bird in the British Museum, and another\r\nrepresented in Hewitson’s British Oölogy, which closely resembled it,\r\nwere marked over the entire surface with small but distinct blotches\r\nof reddish-brown on a white ground. One in my collection, taken\r\nin Scotland, is nearly unmarked. A distinctly bluish-white ground\r\nis faintly stained with a few very obscure markings of slate and\r\npurplish-brown.\r\n\r\nMr. MacFarlane furnishes very full and interesting notes and\r\nobservations on the habits of our _canadensis_, as attentively studied\r\nby him in the neighborhood of Anderson River, near the Arctic Ocean. Our\r\nlimits will only permit us to give a summary of his valuable memoranda.\r\nIn a large majority of instances the nests were built against the face\r\nof a steep bank, some sixty or seventy feet from the ground, and about\r\nthirty from the summit. They were very strongly constructed with dry\r\nsticks, usually of willow, and formed a platform on the top, in the\r\ncentre of which the eggs were found on a bed composed of moss, hay, and\r\nfeathers. These platforms were usually about six by seven feet, and\r\nranged from four to six in height. It is said to be “not very scarce\r\nin that quarter,” and to be “a resident, in the summer, of the entire\r\nArctic coast and rivers.” Mention is made of ten nests observed by him,\r\nand eggs taken therefrom. In several instances these eggs were white\r\nand unspotted, exciting his doubts whether they might belong to the\r\n_leucocephalus_.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. MacFarlane they feed on ducks, mice, and other small\r\nanimals, partridges, and the fawn of the reindeer. In confinement they\r\nare fierce and nearly untamable, though they readily eat the food that\r\nis given them, whether fish or meat. Even when taken young from the\r\nnest they evince the same fearless and intractable disposition. In one\r\ninstance a young female killed its older companion by piercing it with\r\nher talons. When first observed, she was standing on and plucking the\r\nfeathers from the body of the slain bird. This was the second bird\r\nthis same ferocious, but comparatively tame, Eagle had thus destroyed.\r\nWhen the cage was removed outside, though the weather was very cold,\r\nthe Eagles did not seem to mind it much, but exercised themselves with\r\njumping off and on their roosting-pole, and seemed very much interested\r\nin all that was taking place within the Fort square. They kept their\r\nplumage in a cleanly condition, and were generally a very clean bird\r\nin all respects. During the fine weather the Eagles were more lively\r\nthan on other occasions. When feeding they drooped both wings, and, if\r\ndisturbed, arched their necks and moved their heads in a threatening\r\nmanner, spreading out their tails like a fan. They grasped the meat\r\nor fish in the talons of either leg, and tore it with their beaks.\r\nAfter feeding, they invariably removed any blood or other impurities\r\nthat may have adhered to the beak by scratching it with their talons\r\nor rubbing it against the bars of their cage. Several of these birds,\r\nin confinement, especially the female referred to, when their cage was\r\napproached, would endeavor to attack Mr. MacFarlane, descending from\r\ntheir sleeping-pole and making a rush at the front bars of the cage,\r\nspreading the wings and flapping them with great force, and making\r\nactive demonstrations with beak and talons. Occasionally they would get\r\nout of their cages; then it was no easy matter to get them back again,\r\nas, when approached, they would throw themselves on their backs and\r\nthrust out their talons in the most formidable manner. They nest as\r\nearly as the last of April or early in May, as largely developed embryos\r\nwere found on the 27th of May. When their nests were pillaged they\r\ngenerally deserted them; but in one instance, where the female had been\r\nsnared upon her nest, and the eggs taken, the same nest was occupied the\r\nfollowing season by the male with another mate. The new mate was shot,\r\nand proved to be a mature bird. Almost invariably the male birds were\r\ntoo wary to be either shot or taken in a snare. Two of the nests of this\r\nbird, pointed out by the Indians, appeared to have been used for several\r\nyears, and had been known to their discoverers for six or seven years\r\nprevious. The nests taken were in about latitude 69° 30′.\r\n\r\nIn one particular case a nest had been discovered two years previously\r\nby MacFarlane’s Esquimo interpreter. It had been occupied that season,\r\nand a pair of Eagles had been recognized as its inmates. In 1863 the\r\nnest was known to have been reoccupied, though he did not visit it. On\r\nthe 17th of May, 1864, he went to it and found both Eagles engaged in\r\nrepairing it. The female appeared to act as the builder, and the male as\r\nthe carrier of the materials, as well as the provider of provisions. The\r\nnest was not complete, and contained two half-eaten Ptarmigans, but no\r\neggs. It was built against the face of a steep bank of a small stream,\r\nand was of considerable bulk. When first constructed, the nest of this\r\nEagle is comparatively small, but as it is renovated every season, it\r\nultimately becomes large and bulky. A quantity of dry sticks and twigs\r\nare laid lengthways over the greater portion of the platform of the\r\nprevious season, and the spaces between are filled up by smaller twigs,\r\nmosses, and hay, and the centre is then covered with the two latter\r\ningredients, intermixed with deer’s hair, etc. This annual addition\r\nvaries in thickness from three to eighteen inches. In no instance did\r\nMr. MacFarlane find or hear of any accumulation of bones or other\r\n_débris_ of food either on or in the neighborhood of the nests. In three\r\ninstances the nests were constructed in the tops of tall pines. In these\r\ncases the sandy nature of the soil did not favor their building on the\r\nsides of cliffs.\r\n\r\nThe “Mountain Eagle,” as this species is called throughout the western\r\nregions of the United States, was found by Mr. Ridgway to be a\r\ncommon species throughout the Great Basin along the line of the 40th\r\nparallel. It was daily seen soaring about the mountains, and nested on\r\ninaccessible cliffs. A pair—the female leading—were observed to give\r\nchase to a Sage Hen (_Centrocercus urophasianus_), chasing her on the\r\nwing until the fugitive dropped down to the ground from exhaustion,\r\nwhen she was picked up by the foremost of the Eagles, who then flew off\r\ntogether to the summit of the mountain range (the East Humboldt) near\r\nby, where they probably had their nest.\r\n\r\nAn egg of this bird, taken by Mr. R. MacDonald among the mountains\r\nwest of the Lower Mackenzie River, measures 2.60 inches in length by\r\n2.18 in breadth. The ground-color is of a rich pinkish cream-color,\r\nboldly dashed with large blotches of three or four varying shades of\r\number-brown, intermingled with a few finer markings of a lighter shade\r\nof brown, and a few clouded markings of a purplish-slate. These markings\r\nare grouped and confluent about the smaller end. Other specimens vary to\r\nwhitish, with faint obsolete blotches.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS HALIAËTUS, SAVIGNY.\r\n\r\n  _Haliaëtus_, SAVIG. 1809.

Form robust, and organization powerful, as in _Aquila_; size\r\nlarge. Bill very large, usually somewhat inflated, the chord of the arch\r\nof the culmen more than twice the length of the cere on top; commissure\r\nwith a more or less distinct festoon and sinuation behind it. Nostril\r\noval, obliquely vertical. Feet robust and strong, the tarsus less than\r\none and a half times the middle toe; tarsus feathered in front and on\r\nthe sides for about one half its length; front of the tarsus and top of\r\nthe toes with an imperfectly continuous series of transverse scutellæ,\r\nentirely interrupted in the region of the digito-tarsal joint; the other\r\nportions covered with roundish, somewhat granular, scales, these larger\r\non the posterior face. Claws large, strongly curved, and more obtuse,\r\nand less graduated in size, than in _Aquila_. No trace of a web between\r\nouter and middle toes. Wing very large, the primaries well developed and\r\nstrong; third to fifth quill longest; first longer than the ninth; outer\r\nfive to six with inner webs deeply emarginated. Tail variable in length\r\nand shape, usually short and rounded, cuneate and with fourteen feathers\r\nin _H. pelagicus_, and nearly even, and with twelve feathers, in _H.\r\nmacei_, the rest all having twelve feathers, varying in form with the\r\nspecies. Feathers of the neck, all round, lanceolate.\r\n\r\nThe species of this very strongly marked genus vary between great\r\nextremes in the details of their external structure; but these\r\nvariations I consider to be mainly specific, though two well-defined\r\nsubgeneric divisions should be made, one to include the Old World _H.\r\nleucogaster_, _H. vocifer_, and _H. icthyætus_, which have five, instead\r\nof six, outer quills, with their inner webs cut, and the tarsus with the\r\nfrontal and posterior rows of broad transverse scutellæ nearly as well\r\ndeveloped and continuous as in _Buteo_. The last of these species has\r\nthe claws nearly uniform in size, and contracted and rounded underneath\r\nalmost as much as in _Pandion_; but the other species are less so, each\r\ndiffering in this respect, so that I consider this as only indicating\r\nthe greatest perfection in the specialization of the piscatorial type\r\nof modified structure. In the possession of fourteen tail-feathers, its\r\nvery large bill, naked lores, and general aspect, the _H. pelagicus_\r\nshows an approach to the Old World Vultures.\r\n\r\nAbout nine species are known, of which only two belong to North America,\r\none of them (_H. leucocephalus_) being peculiar to that continent.\r\nTropical America is without a single representation of the genus.\r\nThe majority of the species belong to the Indian region, only the\r\n_H. albicilla_ and _H. pelagicus_ belonging to the Palæarctic Realm,\r\nthe former representing the western, and the latter peculiar to the\r\neastern, district of that zoögeographical division; it is the former\r\nwhich straggles into the Nearctic fauna. The habits of the Sea Eagles\r\ndiffer considerably from those of the true Eagles (_Aquila_) in very\r\nimportant respects; they frequent the shores of the sea, lakes, or large\r\nrivers, instead of mountainous portions, and feed chiefly—some of the\r\nspecies entirely—on fish. Those of the subgenus _Polioaëtus_ are almost\r\nprecisely like _Pandion_ in their habits.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  =52509=,♀ ? ¼\r\n  =9128=,♀. ¼\r\n  =9128=,♀. ¼\r\n  =28100.=(♀ ?) ¼\r\n  =9128=,♀ ? ¼\r\n\r\n  52509 : 9128. _Haliaëtus leucocephalus._\r\n  28100. _H. pelagicus._]\r\n\r\nThe three closely allied species belonging to the northern portions of\r\nthe Northern Hemisphere may be distinguished by the characters given in\r\nthe following synopsis.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecies and Races.\r\n\r\n  COMMON CHARACTERS. _Adult._ Bill, cere, and iris yellow.

The White-tailed or Gray Sea Eagle is common to the sea-coast of\r\nEurope, where it inhabits only the parts of the country adjacent to the\r\nsea, and rears its young on the cliffs. It occurs in Greenland, and is\r\non that ground included in the fauna of North America. It has not yet\r\nbeen traced south of Greenland, nor has it been found in any part of our\r\ncontinent.\r\n\r\nThe Sea Eagle in Europe is rarely found inland. It builds its nest on\r\nrocky cliffs projecting over the water, on the shores of Scotland,\r\nthe Orkney and Shetland Islands, Norway, Russia, etc. The nest is\r\nconstructed of sticks, or, where these are not convenient, of seaweed.\r\nThe eggs are two or three in number. Their ground-color is a clear\r\nwhite, usually unmarked, but occasionally stained with small, faint\r\nspots of light brown. The measurements of two in my collection, both\r\nfrom Scotland, but obtained at different times by H. F. Walter, Esq., of\r\nLondon, are as follows: Length 2.69 inches, breadth 2.19 inches; length\r\n2.13 inches, breadth 2.25 inches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Haliatus albicilla_ (Europe).]\r\n\r\nThe following, in relation to their breeding and distribution, is taken\r\nfrom Mr. Yarrell’s excellent work on the Birds of Great Britain:—\r\n\r\n“The White-tailed Eagle builds its nest on high rocks, and lays two\r\neggs, about the same size of those of the Golden Eagle, but with very\r\nlittle or no red color on the white ground. The young are at first\r\ncovered with a soiled white down, and even at this age the beaks and\r\nclaws of the eaglets are of very large size. A pair of Golden Eagles\r\nhave been known to rear their young in the same spot for eight seasons\r\nin succession; and Mr. Mudie has mentioned that, being thus attached to\r\na particular locality, their young, when able to provide for themselves,\r\nare driven away by the parent birds to get their living elsewhere; but\r\nthe more erratic White-tailed Eagles, quitting the breeding station\r\nwhen the season is ended, leave their young to forage over the district\r\nin which they have been raised. In confinement, the White-tailed Eagle\r\nsometimes becomes sociable.... One kept by Mr. Hoy laid three eggs in\r\nthe same season; and a female in the possession of Mr. Selby laid an egg\r\nafter having been kept in confinement twenty years.... The White-tailed\r\nEagle breeds in the Hebrides, in Orkney and Shetland. Mr. Dunn, in his\r\nuseful Guide to these latter islands, names the particular localities\r\nin which they may be found, but states that they are much more numerous\r\nin winter than in summer. This accords with the opinion of Mr. Temminck\r\nand others that this species returns to the southward from high northern\r\nlatitudes as the season advances.... This Eagle frequents Denmark,\r\nSweden, the west coast of Norway, and from thence as far north as\r\nIceland and Greenland, but is not found in North America. Mr. Temminck\r\nbelieves that this Eagle follows the flocks of geese that annually\r\nresort to the Arctic regions in summer to rear their young. It is found\r\nin Siberia, at Lake Baikal, and inhabits Russia, from whence to the\r\nsouthward it is spread over the European continent generally.”\r\n\r\n\r\nHaliaëtus leucocephalus (LINN.).\r\n\r\nBALD EAGLE; AMERICAN EAGLE.\r\n\r\n  _Aquila leucocephala_, BRISS.

The probability is also that\r\nthe description was made up, or at least very much added to, from this\r\nplate, as there is no record of Mr. Audubon’s specimens having been\r\npreserved. It is by no means strange that persons should consider these\r\nlarge grayish Eagles a different species from the smaller white-headed\r\nones, since their proportions are as different as their colors; and\r\nthroughout the country, unscientific people, and among them experienced\r\nhunters, distinguish the three stages described above as the “bald,”\r\n“big gray,” and “black” Eagles. Nothing is more certain, however, than\r\nthat all are only different stages of one and the same bird.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding table of measurements the old and immature specimens\r\nare given separately, in order to prove the remarkable fact that the\r\nlatter have longer wings and tails than the former. This feature is not\r\nconfined to the present bird, however, but applies as a general rule to\r\nall _Falconidæ_.\r\n\r\nHABITS. The White-headed Eagle is widely diffused throughout the North\r\nAmerican continent, from about latitude 58° north to the Gulf of Mexico\r\nand Central America.\r\n\r\nSir John Richardson, in _Fauna Boreali-Americana_ (Vol. II, p. 15),\r\nstates that he did not meet with this species north of 62°, although\r\nhe found it common between that point and Lake Superior. He also\r\nstates that they leave the fur-countries in October, when the rivers\r\nare frozen. Subsequently, in his expedition overland to the Arctic\r\nSeas, in 1848, he found occasion to change his first impressions quite\r\nmaterially. He gives it as abundant at Half-Moon Lake, in latitude\r\n56° north. He also speaks of finding both the Osprey and White-headed\r\nEagle building their nests on the banks of Bear Lake River, in about\r\n60° north. We find in his notes, that White-headed Eagles made their\r\nappearance at Fort Confidence, latitude 66° 54′, as early as May\r\n17, before the ice had given way in the rivers; and in his tables\r\nof phenomena observed at the Cumberland House, in latitude 54°, we\r\nalso observe that a White-headed Eagle was seen as early as the 24th\r\nof March, “being almost always the first of the summer birds which\r\narrives.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Haliaëtus leucocephalus._]\r\n\r\nMr. MacFarlane found these Eagles breeding on Lockhart River, latitude\r\n67° 30′, but does not regard it as abundant in that locality, and from\r\nthe information he has received from the Indians, he presumes latitude\r\n68° to be its extreme northern range. In the following year, 1862, this\r\nsupposition was in part confirmed by his finding a pair breeding on\r\nthe same river, near its junction with the Anderson, in latitude 68°\r\nnorth. Mr. B. E. Ross states that it ranges to the Arctic Circle, and is\r\nnumerous around Great Slave and Bear Lakes. It proved to very common at\r\nSitka, where Bischoff obtained a number of specimens.\r\n\r\nDr. Cooper, during his journey northward to the 49th degree, found\r\nthis one of the most abundant birds of the Falcon tribe in Washington\r\nTerritory, particularly along the Columbia River. It is a constant\r\nresident in the Territory, and is said to lay its eggs as early as\r\nFebruary. He saw large numbers along the Columbia, sitting on some log\r\nor cliff over the water. He never met with it about high mountain tops\r\nnor on the plains east of the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nDr. Newberry met with this Eagle in the interior of Northern California,\r\nalong the Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers. He found it very common\r\nat the Cascades of the Columbia, at the Falls of the Willamette, and\r\nstill more abundant about the chain of lakes in the Klamath basin, and\r\nalso in the Cascade Range, among the mountain lakes, and wherever fish\r\nwas attainable. They exhibited little shyness, and were easily brought\r\nwithin rifle range.\r\n\r\nIn Florida, Mr. Allen found this bird very common, breeding as early as\r\nJanuary. It was very abundant on the upper St. John’s, and especially\r\nso at Lake Monroe. It is also equally common in Texas, according to\r\nDresser, especially near the headwaters of some of the rivers. He\r\nwas told by his guide, Westfall, that in passing a distance of forty\r\nmiles he had noticed eight nests. It also breeds on the Altacosa. Dr.\r\nWoodhouse found these birds, but nowhere very abundant, from the Gulf of\r\nMexico to the Pacific, along his entire route, and Dr. Coues observed\r\nthem near Fort Whipple.\r\n\r\nThe statements of Temminck that this Eagle has been taken accidentally\r\nin Central Europe, Switzerland, and Germany, and also that it breeds in\r\nNorthwestern Europe, are not now credited; and more recent scrutiny of\r\nthese supposed facts cast discredit upon them, and show that there is no\r\nwell-authenticated instance of its having been detected in Europe.\r\n\r\nThe White-headed Eagle appears to be equally well adapted by nature for\r\nthe endurance of heat or cold, and is apparently indifferent to either.\r\nIts residence is influenced only by its abundance of food, especially\r\nthat of fish; and it seems to matter very little whether that plenty\r\nis procurable within the Arctic Circle or on the coast and rivers of\r\nFlorida and Texas. In places like the Falls of Niagara, where the stream\r\nis ever liable to contribute the remains of animals destroyed by the\r\ndescent of the torrent, this Eagle is especially abundant. Unscrupulous,\r\ngreedy, voracious, not select in its choice of food, and capable of\r\nproviding for itself when necessity compels, we find this not altogether\r\nunsuitable emblem of our country now enacting the tyrant and robber and\r\nplundering the Fishhawk of the fruits of its industry, now sharing with\r\nthe Raven and the Vulture the dead salmon of the Columbia, and in other\r\nplaces diving for and catching its own fish. The impetuosity and skill\r\nwith which it pursues, overtakes, and robs the Fishhawk, bearing off a\r\nfish it has just taken, must be witnessed to be appreciated; and the\r\nswiftness with which the Eagle can dart down upon and seize the booty,\r\nwhich the Hawk has been compelled to let fall, before it reaches the\r\nwater, is not the least wonderful feature of this striking performance.\r\nOn the banks of the Columbia, where there are no Fishhawks to depend\r\nupon, this bird finds an easy subsistence on the vast numbers of dead\r\nand dying salmon which abound; and in Florida Mr. Allen has observed it\r\ndive and catch its own fish. This is also confirmed by the statements of\r\nother naturalists. Wilson also accuses this Eagle of destroying great\r\nnumbers of young pigs in the Southern States, young lambs, and even\r\nsickly sheep; and in one instance it attempted to carry off a child,\r\nwhich was only saved by its dress giving way.\r\n\r\nThe White-headed Eagle breeds along the Atlantic coast from the St.\r\nLawrence to Florida, and thence westward to Mexico along the coast and\r\namong the tributaries of the Gulf. In the interior it breeds as far\r\nnorth as the Arctic Circle.\r\n\r\nRichardson states that it abounds in the watery districts of Rupert’s\r\nLand, and a nest may be looked for within every twenty or thirty miles.\r\nEach pair appropriates a certain range of country, on which they are\r\nsaid to suffer no intruders of their own species to encroach; but the\r\nnest of the Osprey is often placed at no great distance from that of\r\nthe Eagle. Some of the voyagers had the curiosity to visit an Eagle’s\r\nnest, which was built on the cleft summit of a balsam poplar, of sticks,\r\nmany of them as thick as a man’s wrist. It contained two young birds,\r\nwell fledged, with a good store of fish in a very odoriferous condition.\r\nWhile the men were climbing the tree, the female parent hovered close\r\naround, and threatened an attack on the invaders; but the male kept\r\naloof, making circles high in the air.\r\n\r\nIn California, where the rocky coast is destitute of convenient trees,\r\nthe White-headed Eagle resorts to rocky cliffs as the safest and most\r\nconvenient places for nesting. We have the authority of Richardson\r\nfor the same deviation from its usual resort to trees in parts of the\r\nfur-countries where the latter are wanting. The climate apparently\r\nexerts a certain influence, though not so much as might be supposed.\r\nIn the Southern States it nests seven weeks earlier than in Maine, in\r\nboth of which regions it is resident throughout the year. Farther north,\r\nwhere the severity of the cold, by closing the ponds and rivers with\r\nsolid ice, places their food beyond their reach, and where they are only\r\nvisitants in the warmer season, they, of course, nest still later, for\r\nthe reason that they do not reach these regions until after the breeding\r\nseason of more southern birds of the species.\r\n\r\nIn the extreme Southern States, as in California, the White-headed\r\nEagle breeds as early as February. In Maine, the general impression has\r\nbeen that the eggs are not deposited before May, and at a still later\r\nperiod in the more northern portions of the United States. More recent\r\nobservations show this to be incorrect, and that these birds breed at\r\na much earlier season of the year. Mr. Audubon speaks of having once\r\nshot a female on her eggs, near the Mississippi, as early as the 17th\r\nof January. Dr. Gambel found White-headed Eagles nesting on the cliffs\r\nalong the shores of the Pacific in February and March.\r\n\r\nHaving occasion to visit the State of Maine in April, 1856, near the\r\nDamariscotta River, the banks of which stream are frequented by these\r\nbirds on account of the abundance of fish, I was informed that a pair\r\nhad constructed a nest in a neighboring wood, which they had occupied\r\nfor several successive years. The previous season (1855), late in\r\nMay, my informant had climbed a tree in the immediate neighborhood,\r\ncommanding a full view of the nest. It then contained young nearly\r\ngrown. From this statement I was led to conclude that there was no time\r\nto be lost if we would secure the eggs before hatching. We accordingly\r\nvisited the nest on the 27th of April, and found it situated on a tall\r\npine, at least sixty feet from the ground. The tree stood in a swampy\r\nwood, within a few rods of the stage road, and not more than half a mile\r\nfrom the village of Damariscotta. It contained no limbs or branches to\r\nfacilitate ascent for at least the distance of thirty feet, and the\r\ntrunk at the base was from six to nine feet in circumference, rendering\r\nit impossible to mount the tree by the aid only of the hands and feet.\r\nMy assistant was, however, drawn up, by means of a rope fastened round\r\nhis body, to a height where the branches of the tree rendered the\r\nremainder of the ascent comparatively easy. While he was ascending, we\r\nobserved several Eagles flying over our heads, but at a great height.\r\nOne only approached us; but, as soon as we were noticed, the bird made\r\na precipitate retreat. It was apparently conveying food to the nest,\r\nand was not at first aware of our presence; after which it hovered at\r\na distance, uttering hoarse, disagreeable cries of displeasure, not\r\nunlike the imperfect barking of a dog. No attempt was made to molest or\r\ninterrupt the man as he ascended to, or after he had reached, the nest.\r\nWe found, when he had climbed to the nest, that the female had been\r\nsitting upon it all the while, and only left when the unwelcome caller\r\nwas near enough to have reached her with his hands. She too flew over\r\nthe man’s head in somewhat close proximity, uttering frequent cries of\r\ndistress, but made no effort whatever to attack him.\r\n\r\nThe nest was found to contain no egg, and but a single bird, apparently\r\nabout a fortnight old. It was some six or seven inches in length,\r\nits weight between one and two pounds, and its head and claws\r\ndisproportionately large. It was covered uniformly with a thick, close,\r\nand soft downy plumage, which was of a clean deep straw-color. There was\r\nnot the least admixture of gray or brown. The young bird was completely\r\nhelpless, and uttered almost constant cries for food. It ate readily\r\nwhenever fish or meat was offered it, but was unable to support itself\r\nupon its legs. It was taken to my host’s house, where it was well cared\r\nfor, and for a while, with careful attention, it did well and grew\r\napace, manifesting a most inordinate and insatiable appetite.\r\n\r\nThe nest was described to me by my assistant as a platform between\r\nfive and six feet in diameter, and at least four in thickness. It was\r\nconstructed of regular layers of large sticks, each several feet in\r\nlength, and from an inch to an inch and a half in thickness. Its surface\r\nwas perfectly flat, and was “finished off,” to use his expression, with\r\ntufts of grass, dry leaves, mosses, lichens, small twigs, etc., etc. He\r\nfound in it, by the side of the young Eagle, four or five large eels,\r\neach of which was about two feet in length, showing that the parent\r\nbirds provide liberally for their own wants and those of their young.\r\n\r\nEstimating the age of the young Eagle at ten days, and allowing four\r\nweeks for incubation, and at least one week’s interval between the\r\ndeposition and the commencement of the parent bird’s sitting upon it, we\r\nhave very nearly the exact period at which the egg was laid, March 13.\r\n\r\nThis occurred at the coldest period of the season, when the ground\r\nwas covered with snow to an unusual depth, and when the thermometer\r\nindicated a temperature at that time frequently as low as 15° below\r\nzero.\r\n\r\nThe nest is usually of great size, composed of sticks from three to five\r\nfeet in length, pieces of turf, weeds, and moss. Its diameter is about\r\nfive feet, and its depth is not unfrequently as great. In the warmer\r\nlocalities, where it breeds, the pair usually frequent the same nest\r\nthroughout the year, and make it their permanent place of resort. This\r\nis also true, probably, wherever this Eagle remains throughout the year.\r\nMr. T. H. Jackson, of West Chester, Pa., informs me that he met with\r\nthree fresh eggs of this species in Maryland, on the 11th of February,\r\n1871.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are usually two, sometimes three or four, in number; they\r\nare nearly spherical, equally rounded at either end, and more or less\r\ngranulated on their surface. Their color is a dull white, unspotted, but\r\noften stained by incubation to a dirty white or a light soiled drab.\r\nTwo eggs in my collection present the following measurements: Length\r\n3 inches, breadth 2.75; length 2.88 inches, breadth 2.80. The first\r\nwas obtained in New Jersey by Alexander Wilson, the ornithologist; the\r\nlatter by Dr. Trudeau, in Louisiana.\r\n\r\nAnother, taken from a nest in Texas by Dr. Heermann, measured 2.80\r\nby 2.20 inches. A fourth, from Sitka, measures 2.75 by 2.25 inches.\r\nThese measurements, so far as they may be taken as typical, exhibit but\r\nlittle variation in size between the most northern and the most southern\r\nspecimens.\r\n\r\nSeveral nests were met with and the eggs taken by Mr. MacFarlane near\r\nAnderson River. They were generally built in high trees not far from\r\nriver-banks. In a few instances the parents made hostile demonstrations\r\nwhen their nests were robbed, but generally kept at a safe distance,\r\nuttering loud and discordant sounds. The nests were built of dry sticks\r\nand decayed branches, and lined with deer’s hair, mosses, hay, and other\r\nsimilar soft materials.\r\n\r\nMr. Dall was informed by the Indians that this species breeds among the\r\nAlaskan mountains on inaccessible cliffs. This statement, however, may\r\nhave had reference to the Golden Eagle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Falco communis_ (Europe), p. 138.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY CATHARTIDÆ.—THE AMERICAN VULTURES.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Cathartidæ_, GRAY, 1842.—HUXLEY, P. Z. S. 1867, p. 463. _Cathartinæ_,\r\n  LAFR. 1839. _Sarcorhamphidæ_, GRAY, 1848. _Gryphinæ_, REICH. 1850.\r\n\r\nThe characters of this family have been given in sufficient detail (III,\r\n1), so that a short diagnosis, showing its most readily observable\r\npeculiarities, will here be sufficient.\r\n\r\nCHAR. Whole head, and sometimes the neck, naked; eyes prominent, and not\r\nshaded by a superciliary shield. Cere much elongated, much depressed\r\nanteriorly below the very arched culmen; nostrils longitudinal,\r\nhorizontal, the two confluent or perforate. Middle toe very long, and\r\nthe hind one much abbreviated. A web between the base of the inner and\r\nmiddle toes.\r\n\r\nThe family _Vulturidæ_,[94] as long recognized, included all the\r\nnaked-headed, carrion-feeding _Raptores_ of both the Old and the\r\nNew World. The later researches of science, however, have shown the\r\nnecessity of separating the Vultures of the latter continent from those\r\nof the former, and ranking them as a distinct family, while at the same\r\ntime the Old World Vultures are found to be merely modified _Falconidæ_.\r\nThe resemblance between the _Cathartidæ_ and the vulturine _Falconidæ_\r\nis merely a superficial one of analogy, and not one of affinity. Being\r\nthe scavengers of the countries they inhabit, the latter thus perform\r\nthe same office in nature as the former, and for adaptation to a similar\r\nmode of life their external characters are modified to correspond.\r\nClose, however, as is the external resemblance between the two groups,\r\ntheir osteological structure and internal anatomy is entirely different.\r\n\r\nThe _Cathartidæ_ differ from the _Vulturinæ_[95] as to their external\r\nstructure in the following particulars, the osteological structure\r\nbeing entirely different in the two groups, the latter being like the\r\n_Falconidæ_ in all the characters which separate the latter family from\r\nthe _Cathartidæ_.\r\n\r\n  =Cathartidæ.= Nostrils horizontal, perforate; a well-developed web\r\n  between the inner and middle toes, at the base.\r\n\r\n  =Vulturinæ.= Nostrils vertical, not perforate; no trace of web between\r\n  inner and middle toes.\r\n\r\nIn habits, the _Cathartidæ_ resemble the vulturine _Falconidæ_ of the\r\nOld World. “They lack the strength and spirit of typical _Raptores_,\r\nand rarely attack animals capable of offering resistance; they are\r\nvoracious and indiscriminate gormandizers of carrion and animal refuse\r\nof all sorts,—efficient and almost indispensable scavengers in the\r\nwarm countries where they abound. They are uncleanly in their mode of\r\nfeeding; the nature of their food renders them ill-scented, and when\r\ndisturbed they eject the fetid contents of the crop. Although not\r\ntruly gregarious, they assemble in multitudes where food is plenty,\r\nand some species breed in communities. When gorged, they appear heavy\r\nand indisposed to exertion, usually passing the period of digestion\r\nmotionless, in a listless attitude, with their wings half spread.\r\nBut they spend most of the time on wing, circling high in the air;\r\ntheir flight is easy and graceful in the extreme, and capable of being\r\nindefinitely protracted. On the ground, they habitually walk instead of\r\nprogressing by leaps. Possessing no vocal apparatus, the Vultures are\r\nalmost mute, emitting only a weak hissing sound.” (COUES.)\r\n\r\nThe _Cathartidæ_ all belong to the tropical and warm temperate portions\r\nof the continent, only one species (_Rhinogryphus aura_) extending its\r\nrange as far as the border of the colder regions. The famous Condor\r\n(_Sarcorhamphus gryphus_) of the Andes and the equally large California\r\nspecies (_Pseudogryphus californianus_) are among the largest birds of\r\nflight in the world, being exceeded in size by none, and rivalled but by\r\none or two of the Vultures of the Eastern Hemisphere.\r\n\r\nThe following diagnoses based upon the external structure are sufficient\r\nto characterize the very well-marked genera and subgenera of this\r\nfamily. The distinctive osteological characters which accompany these\r\nexternal features afford still more decided differences, and are\r\nillustrated by the figures.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _S. gryphus_, ♂, Chile. ¼ nat. size.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _S. papa_, ♀, Mazatlan. ¼ nat. size.]\r\n\r\n\r\nGenera and Subgenera.\r\n\r\n  =A.= Crop naked. _Male_ with a fleshy crest, or lobe, attached to\r\n  the top of the cere.

This large Vulture, so far as is known, is restricted to the\r\narea on the Pacific Coast from the Columbia River to the Colorado,\r\nand extending as far to the east as the Sierra Nevada. None are known\r\nto have been taken in Mexico, and it very rarely goes north of the\r\nColumbia. It is said to be most common in the hot interior valleys of\r\nCalifornia, where are large herds of cattle, upon which it, to a large\r\nextent, depends for its food. Dr. Cooper saw none on the Colorado,\r\nand met with none east of the San Bernardino Mountains. Even at Fort\r\nMohave the cattle killed during the five months he resided there did not\r\nattract one of these Vultures.\r\n\r\nDr. Cooper did not see these birds in any number along the sea-coast,\r\nand has noticed none on the islands or in the highest Sierra Nevada.\r\nYet they are said, when other food is scarce, to feed on dead seals and\r\nwhales; but this fact he has never witnessed.\r\n\r\nDr. Newberry states that it was to him a pleasant portion of every day’s\r\nexperience, in his march through the Sacramento Valley, to watch the\r\ngraceful evolutions of this Vulture. In its colors the combination was\r\na pleasing one, while its flight was easy and effortless beyond that of\r\nany other bird. Though a common bird in California, he found it much\r\nmore shy and difficult to shoot than its associate, the Turkey-Buzzard;\r\nand it was never seen in such numbers or exhibiting such familiarity\r\nas the smaller species which swarm, and are such efficient scavengers,\r\nin our southern cities. After his party left the Sacramento Valley, he\r\nsaw very few in the Klamath Basin, and met with none within the limits\r\nof Oregon. It is occasionally found there, but much more rarely than in\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nDr. Newberry states that a fine specimen presented to Dr. Sterling on\r\nhis return to San Francisco ate freely of the meat given him, and was\r\nfor some time kept alive. It was, however, impatient of confinement,\r\nand succeeded in tearing the cord that confined him from his legs, and\r\nin making his escape. Dr. Cooper also saw one of these Vultures in\r\nconfinement, at Monterey, in the possession of Dr. Canfield. This was\r\na full-grown individual which he had raised from the nest. It had been\r\nfed exclusively on fresh meat, had no offensive smell, and was clean\r\nand shining. It was gentle and familiar, but seemed stupid, and dozed\r\nmost of the time on a fence. This was subsequently presented to the\r\nZoölogical Society of London, and formed the subject of our figure. The\r\nfigure of the young bird on the next page is taken from a photograph of\r\nthe same specimen at an early age.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Pseudogryphus californianus._]\r\n\r\nDr. Heermann, in his Report on Lieutenant Williamson’s Survey, mentions\r\nhaving observed this Vulture sailing majestically in wide circles at a\r\ngreat height, and ranging by its powers of flight over an immense space\r\nof country in search of food. Often when hunting in the Tejon Valley,\r\nif unsuccessful, they would be several hours without seeing one of this\r\nspecies; but as soon as they succeeded in bringing down any large game,\r\nthese birds would be seen rising above the horizon before the body\r\nhad grown cold, and slowly sweeping towards them, intent upon their\r\nshare of the game. In the absence of the hunter, unless well protected,\r\nthese marauders will be sure to drag out from its concealment the slain\r\nanimal, even though carefully covered with branches. Dr. Heermann states\r\nthat he has known them to drag out and devour a deer within an hour.\r\nThis Vulture possesses immense muscular power. Dr. Heermann has known\r\nfour of them to drag the body of a young grizzly bear, that weighed over\r\na hundred pounds, the distance of two hundred yards. Dr. Cooper states\r\nthat it visits the Columbia River in autumn, when its shores are lined\r\nwith great numbers of dead salmon, on which, in company with other birds\r\nand various animals, it feasts for a couple of months. He considered\r\nit, however, only a visitor at certain seasons, and not a resident even\r\nthrough the summer. He did not see it, nor did he hear of its presence\r\nat Puget Sound.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Pseudogryphus californianus._]\r\n\r\nIt is stated by Douglas that these Vultures will in no instance attack\r\nany living animal unless it be so severely wounded as to be unable\r\nto walk. Their senses of sight and smell are very acute, especially\r\nthe former; and when searching for prey they soar to a very great\r\nheight, and if they chance to discover a wounded animal they immediately\r\nfollow and attack it whenever it sinks down. The first comers are soon\r\nfollowed by others, and it is not long before the carcass is reduced\r\nto a skeleton. After thus feeding, they remain for a while sluggish\r\nand reluctant to move. At these times they perch on dead trees, with\r\ntheir heads drawn down, and their wings drooping over their feet.\r\nExcept after feeding, or when protecting their nests, they are said to\r\nbe very wary, and are with great difficulty shot by the hunter. Their\r\nflight is described as slow, steady, and graceful, and they glide along\r\nwith little or no perceptible motion of the wings, the tips of which\r\nare curved upward in flying, in the manner of the Turkey-Buzzard. They\r\nare said to appear most numerous and to soar the highest preceding\r\nthunder-storms and tempests.\r\n\r\nDr. Townsend states that in their walk they resemble a Turkey strutting\r\nover the ground with great dignity, but are clumsy and awkward when they\r\nendeavor to hasten their movements. When they attempt to rise from the\r\nground they always hop several yards, in order to give an impetus to\r\ntheir heavy body. Dr. Cooper discredits the statement of Mr. Taylor,\r\nthat this Vulture has been known to kill and carry off a hare in its\r\nclaws. These are straight and weak, and not adapted for such uses.\r\n\r\nDr. Heermann states that a nest of this bird with young was discovered\r\nin a thicket on the Tuolumne River. It was about eight feet back from\r\nthe entrance of a crevice in the rocks, completely surrounded and\r\nmasked by thick underbrush and trees, and composed of a few loose\r\nsticks thrown negligently together. He found two other nests, of a like\r\nconstruction and similarly situated, at the head of Merced River and in\r\nthe mountains. From the latter the Indians were in the habit of yearly\r\nrobbing the young, to kill at one of their festivals.\r\n\r\nMr. Alexander S. Taylor, of Monterey, published a series of papers\r\nin a California journal relative to this Vulture. In one of these\r\nhe mentions that a Mexican _ranchero_, in hunting among the highest\r\npeaks of the Santa Lucia range, disturbed two pairs of them from their\r\nnesting-places, and brought away from one a young bird a few days old,\r\nand from the other an egg. There was no nest, the eggs having been laid\r\nin the hollow of a tall old robles-oak, in a steep _barranca_, near the\r\nsummit of one of the highest peaks. These birds are said by some hunters\r\nto make no nest, but simply lay their eggs on the ground at the foot of\r\nold trees or on the bare rocks of solitary peaks. Others affirm that\r\nthey sometimes lay their eggs in old nests of Eagles and Buzzards. Mr.\r\nTaylor states that the egg weighed 10.50 ounces, the contents weighing\r\n8.75. The egg was of a dead dull white color, the surface of the shell\r\nslightly roughened. It was nearly a perfect ellipse in shape, and\r\nmeasured 4.50 inches in length by 2.38 in diameter. The egg-shell held\r\nnine fluid ounces of water. The young Vulture weighed ten ounces. His\r\nskin was of an ocreous-yellow, covered with a fine down of a dull white.\r\n\r\nDr. Canfield informed Dr. Cooper that he has seen as many as one hundred\r\nand fifty of these birds at one time and place in the vicinity of\r\nantelopes he had killed, and noticed that they invariably sighted\r\ntheir prey. They are often killed by feeding on animals that have been\r\npoisoned with strychnine. They are not feared by the _rancheros_, yet\r\nDr. Canfield has known a number to attack a young calf, separate it from\r\nits mother, and kill it. A _vaquero_ having killed a large grizzly bear,\r\nleft it on the plains near the sea-shore, to return to the house, about\r\nthree miles distant, for assistance. On his return, after an absence\r\nof about two hours, a flock of these Vultures had cleaned the entire\r\ncarcass, leaving only the skin and the skeleton. This Vulture and the\r\nTurkey-Buzzard often feed together over the same carcass, and generally\r\ndo some fighting together. Many of them nest in the high mountains east\r\nand south of the Carmelo Valley, and also near Santa Cruz, as well as in\r\nthe Santa Lucia range, and are found there throughout the year, but in\r\ngreater numbers from July to November.\r\n\r\nAn egg of this species, in the collection of the Smithsonian Institution\r\n(9,983), from San Rafael, California, obtained by Dr. C. A. Canfield,\r\nmeasures 4.40 inches in length by 2.50 in breadth. It is of an\r\nelongate-oval shape, but is decidedly more pointed at the smaller than\r\nat the larger end. In color it is of a uniform pale greenish-blue,\r\nalmost an ashy greenish-white, and without spots.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS RHINOGRYPHUS, RIDGWAY.\r\n\r\n  _Cathartes_, AUCT. (in part).

As a rule, the specimens\r\nfrom intertropical regions, as might be expected, are the smallest and\r\nmost brightly colored. The smallest in the series are those from Lower\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nHABITS. Probably none of the birds of America have so extended a\r\ndistribution as this Vulture, occurring, as it does, in greater or\r\nless abundance from high northern latitudes at the Saskatchewan,\r\nthroughout North America from the Atlantic to the Pacific, and in all\r\nportions of South America, even to the Straits of Magellan. On the\r\nAtlantic coast it is not common north of Central New Jersey, though\r\noccasionally individuals have been seen as far north as New Brunswick\r\nand Nova Scotia. Several specimens have been taken in various parts of\r\nNew England, from Calais, Me., to Connecticut. Mr. Lawrence cites it\r\nas of rare and irregular occurrence near New York. In one instance he\r\nnoticed a company of nine individuals at Rockaway, Long Island. West\r\nof the Alleghanies it has a much less restricted distribution, from\r\nCentral America almost to the Arctic regions. It is found more or less\r\nfrequently in all the Middle, the Southern, Western, and Northwestern\r\nStates, without an exception. It is met with in large numbers throughout\r\nthe entire Pacific coast of North America, from Lower California to\r\nWashington Territory. Mr. Douglas saw vast numbers of this species in\r\nCanada, near Sandwich and Lake St. Clair, during their breeding-season.\r\nDr. Richardson speaks of their having higher summer migrations in the\r\ninterior of the continent than on the Pacific coast, finding it along\r\nthe banks of the Saskatchewan, in latitude 55°, late in the month of\r\nJune. Mr. Say met with them in latitude 59°, and Lewis and Clarke\r\nnoticed them near the Falls of the Columbia River, in latitude 48°. Mr.\r\nBlakiston states that an individual was shot at the Red River Settlement\r\nas early as April 27, while the winter’s snow was still covering the\r\nground to the depth of a foot and the rivers were ice-bound. He also\r\nobserved it at Fort Carlton, in latitude 53°, on the 7th of May, and\r\nagain, on the 2d of September, in latitude 49°.\r\n\r\nMr. T. H. Jackson, of West Chester, Pa., informs me that this Vulture\r\nhas been known to breed at Parkersburg, fifteen miles west of the\r\nformer place, in the summer of 1870, and that they also breed rather\r\nplentifully on the banks of the Susquehanna, laying their eggs, two in\r\nnumber, in caves among the rocks, as early as the 10th of April, and\r\nthat some remain in that vicinity all winter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Rhinogryphus aura._]\r\n\r\nDr. Cooper mentions their great abundance during the summer in all\r\nparts of Washington Territory, frequenting the vicinity of prairies and\r\nriver-banks, but never appearing along the coast. They arrive at Puget\r\nSound about the middle of May, and undoubtedly breed in the Territory.\r\nDr. Suckley met with them at Fort Dalles, in Oregon, and also on Puget\r\nSound. He also met with them not far from Pembina. Dr. Newberry also\r\nobserved them in California and Oregon, quite common in the vicinity of\r\nthe towns and about the great rivers. In the Klamath Basin it was more\r\nrare, and on the Des Chutes he scarcely saw any; but on the Columbia,\r\nespecially below the Cascades, they were very plentiful.\r\n\r\nDr. Heermann found this bird ranging over the whole extent of\r\nCalifornia, meeting them in great numbers in the vicinity of Fort Yuma,\r\nat the junction of the Colorado and Gila Rivers.\r\n\r\nIn the West India Islands these birds occur in Cuba, Jamaica, and\r\nTrinidad; but according to Mr. E. C. Taylor, neither this nor any other\r\nspecies of Vulture occurs in any of the islands between Trinidad and\r\nSt. Thomas, not even in Tobago or Porto Rico. At Trinidad they are very\r\nabundant.\r\n\r\nMr. G. C. Taylor found this Vulture common in Honduras, where, however,\r\nit does not go much into the towns and villages, but is usually seen on\r\nthe outskirts and in the forests. In Guatemala, Mr. Salvin found it not\r\nnearly so abundant as _C. atratus_, and there also, as in Honduras, it\r\nfrequented the more uncultivated and forest districts, leaving to the\r\nlatter all the duties of the scavenger. Captain C. C. Abbott found this\r\nVulture very common in the Falkland Islands, remaining the whole year\r\nround, and breeding.\r\n\r\nThe flight of the Turkey-Buzzard is graceful, dignified, and easy. It\r\nsails with a steady, even motion, with wings just above the horizontal\r\nposition, with their tips slightly raised. They rise from the ground\r\nwith a single bound, give a few flaps to their wings, and then proceed\r\nwith their peculiar, soaring flight. They rise very high in the air,\r\nmoving round in large circles. They are of gregarious habits, and\r\nusually associate in companies of from ten to a much larger number.\r\nThey feed upon all kinds of animal food, and are accused by Audubon of\r\nsucking eggs and devouring the young of Herons and other birds. Yet\r\nin Trinidad they were observed by Mr. E. C. Taylor associating with\r\nthe poultry apparently upon the most amicable terms, and, although\r\nsurrounded with chickens of all sizes, they were never known to molest\r\nthem. Mr. Audubon also states that they devour birds of their own\r\nspecies when dead. They are said to walk well on the ground and on\r\nthe roofs of houses, and associate and even roost in company with the\r\nBlack Vulture. Dr. Heermann, who observed them on the desert between\r\nthe Colorado and Carissa Creek, where they find an ample supply of food\r\nfrom numerous animals that there perish from want of grass and water,\r\nstates that they seemed to be on terms of amity both with the Ravens\r\nand the California Vultures, but retire on the approach of the prairie\r\nwolf. He adds that when a company of these Vultures have once commenced\r\nupon a carcass, a scene of plunder, noise, confusion, and dispute\r\nensues, baffling all description. Each one strives, as best he may, to\r\nbolt the morsel he has seized, or to rob his neighbor whose booty is\r\ntoo voluminous to be despatched at once. As illustrating the peculiar\r\nflight of this species, Dr. Newberry mentions that, having occasion to\r\nshoot one for the purpose of determining its identity, the wounded bird\r\nmade no motion indicating it had been struck by the shot, but sailed\r\non with widely expanded and motionless wings as before; gradually it\r\n“began to descend in wide and regular circles, till finally, without\r\na wing-flap, it settled as lightly as a feather on the prairie, and\r\nremained motionless.” Upon going to the bird, Dr. Newberry found it\r\nresting in the grass, the wings still widely and evenly expanded, but\r\nthe head drooping and life extinct.\r\n\r\nIn the Southern States this Vulture is found equally in cities and\r\nlarge villages, and near the coast, as well as in the interior, in\r\ncompany with the Black Vulture (_C. atratus_), although the latter\r\nspecies is chiefly confined to the coast, and is rare in the interior.\r\nIt is noticeable that in Guatemala and Honduras its habits are somewhat\r\ndifferent in these respects, being only found in wild places, leaving\r\nthe cities and sea-coast to the exclusive occupancy of the Black\r\nVulture. Mr. G. C. Taylor, who observed these birds in Kingston,\r\nJamaica, states that they were the only species seen, and that they were\r\nalways to be found either on the roofs of the houses or feeding on the\r\ncarrion in the streets. They made great noise with their feet as they\r\nclattered over the shingles of the roofs.\r\n\r\nIn Trinidad, where Mr. E. C. Taylor found this bird much less numerous\r\nthan the _atratus_, it kept to the open country, and was not found in\r\nthe towns. He could always readily distinguish it by its more graceful\r\nflight and its aquiline appearance. They were generally to be seen\r\nskimming over the tree-tops, as if trying how near they could go without\r\ntouching. On the Orinoco, though more numerous than in Trinidad, they\r\ndid not frequent the towns in the same familiar manner with the Black\r\nVulture.\r\n\r\nThe Turkey-Buzzards, as well as the Black Vultures, are evidently\r\naided by a very powerful sight in distinguishing their food at a great\r\ndistance. They are frequently known to collect in large numbers, from\r\ngreat distances, around the dead bodies of animals, where none were in\r\nsight before. But it seems equally certain that they are also assisted\r\nby an only less powerful sense of smell. Mr. Hill, cited by Mr. Gosse,\r\nmentions a remarkable instance where these Vultures were attracted by a\r\nstrong smell of carrion to the house of a German emigrant, lying sick\r\nof a fever, and where his neglected food had become offensive. In this\r\ninstance the sense of smell, unaided by that of sight, must have guided\r\nthese birds.\r\n\r\nMr. G. C. Taylor, while residing at Kingston, often used to puzzle the\r\nVultures by throwing dried bird-skins stuffed with cotton out upon an\r\nadjacent roof. Few seconds would elapse before a Vulture would pounce\r\nupon them, and manifest a great disappointment in finding nothing to eat\r\nin skins of so promising an appearance. He once wrapped the carcass of a\r\nbird in a piece of paper, and threw it into the top of a thickly leaved\r\ntree near his window. There it remained for a long while, the Vultures\r\nsweeping within a few feet of it, almost brushing the leaves with their\r\nwings, their sense of smell informing them that there was something\r\neatable close by, but their sight failing to solve the problem, owing to\r\nthe enclosure of the object in an envelope.\r\n\r\nThe Turkey-Buzzard breeds on or near the ground, usually in hollow\r\ntrees, stumps, or decaying logs. It generally constructs no nest,\r\ndepositing the eggs with little or no preparatory pains for their\r\nshelter. Mr. Ord found them breeding as early as the month of May in the\r\ndeep recesses of the solitary swamps of New Jersey. He describes the\r\nnest as formed, without any painstaking, in a truncated hollow tree, and\r\nin excavated stumps or logs, and mentions the number of eggs as from\r\ntwo to four. Except in regard to the number of eggs, which is probably\r\nnever more than two, these observations substantially correspond with\r\nother accounts of their breeding. In Jamaica, Mr. Gosse mentions that\r\nthe situations usually selected by the Turkey-Buzzard of that island for\r\nlaying and hatching its eggs are hollows and ledges of rocks in secluded\r\nplaces or inaccessible crags and cliffs. A little dry trash, he adds,\r\nor decaying leaves, are all the apology for a nest. On the island of\r\nGalveston, where this Vulture was plentiful, Mr. Audubon several times\r\nfound its nest on a level part of the salt marshes, either under the\r\nwidespread branches of cactuses, or among tall grass growing beneath low\r\nbushes. Mr. T. H. Jackson found this Vulture nesting in Maryland, with\r\nfresh eggs, from April 10 to May 1.\r\n\r\nDr. C. Kollock, of Cheraw, S. C., informs me that in his neighborhood\r\nboth this species and the Black Vulture frequent places in the interior\r\nof swamps and thick woods, generally called Buzzards’ roosts. They\r\ncongregate there through the year in large numbers, and usually breed in\r\nthe immediate vicinity. Mr. Audubon visited one of these roosts, near\r\nCharleston, S. C., which extended over two acres of ground, and was\r\nentirely destitute of vegetation.\r\n\r\nMr. Dresser, who found this species one of the most common birds of\r\nSouthern Texas, gives a somewhat different account of their nesting.\r\nHe found them breeding all through the country on the banks of streams\r\nwhere the timber afforded a secure shelter. He saw many nests on the\r\nbanks of the Medina, Altacosta, and San Antonio Rivers; and these, he\r\nstates, were large and bulky, composed of sticks, and generally placed\r\nat some height on a cypress or an oak near the river-bank.\r\n\r\nCaptain C. C. Abbott states (Ibis, 1861, p. 149) that in the Falkland\r\nIslands they lay their eggs, two in number, but sometimes three, under\r\na high bank amongst bushes, or on the top of a dead balsam log, without\r\nconstructing any nest. The time of their laying was the first week of\r\nNovember. The young birds have the bare space of the head and neck of\r\na bluish color, as also the feet. The old birds go in pairs the whole\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nThe eggs exhibit slight deviations in size, and occasionally the\r\nnature of their markings, yet for the most part preserve specific\r\ncharacteristics. The following are the proportions of four specimens,\r\nwhich will represent their usual variations: 2.81 inches by 1.94; 2.75\r\nby 1.87; 2.94 by 1.87; 2.62 by 1.94. These were from New Jersey, South\r\nCarolina, Louisiana, and Tamaulipas (Mexico). The more common varieties\r\nhave a ground of a light cream-color, marked with large confluent spots\r\nof reddish-brown or chocolate, chiefly predominating at the larger\r\nend, but also sparsely scattered over the entire egg. Intermixed with\r\nthese are less frequent markings of a light purplish or lilac shade of\r\ndrab. These are often so faint as only to be perceptible on a close\r\nexamination. An egg taken some years since in New Jersey, by Alexander\r\nWilson, and somewhat faded, is marked over the entire shell with\r\nconfluent spots of a dark greenish-brown, with no perceptible shades\r\nof red or purple. Another variety from Cheraw, S. C., has a ground of\r\nnearly pure white, is very nearly unspotted, and is only marked with a\r\nfew small dots and lines of red and indistinct purple at the larger end.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS CATHARISTA, VIEILLOT.\r\n\r\n  _Catharista_, VIEILL. 1816.

The Black Vulture or Carrion Crow of the Southern States, though\r\nfound in a much less extended area than the Turkey Vulture, has yet a\r\nvery wide distribution. It is quite common along our Atlantic and Gulf\r\ncoasts from North Carolina to Mexico. It does not occur on the Pacific\r\ncoast of the United States, though given by Douglas as being abundant\r\non the Columbia River; indeed, it has not, that I am aware of, been\r\ndetected west of the Rocky Mountains. It is, however, as Dr. Gambel\r\nstates, very common about the Gulf of California, and at Mazatlan,\r\nparticularly, he saw it around the town in large companies. On the\r\nAtlantic coast it is not often met with farther north than Wilmington,\r\nN. C. I could not detect it near Norfolk, Va., nor could I ascertain\r\nthat it was known ever to occur there. Accidental specimens have been\r\ntaken, two on the coast of Massachusetts and one in the Bay of Fundy;\r\nbut such occurrences are very rare. Along the coast of all the Southern\r\nStates, from North Carolina to Texas, it is much more abundant than\r\nits kindred species, even where, in the interior of the same State,\r\nit is far less frequent. Along the banks of the Mississippi and its\r\ntributaries, as far as Ohio to the east and Illinois to the north, it\r\nis found more or less abundantly at certain seasons. It is met with\r\nin several of the West India Islands, though rare in Jamaica. It is\r\nabundant throughout Central America, and occurs in nearly all parts of\r\nSouth America. Specimens were brought from Chile by Lieutenant Gilliss,\r\nobtained near Santiago, where it was not common, and only found in the\r\nmountainous regions of the interior. Darwin fixes its extreme southern\r\nlimit in latitude 41° south, near the Rio Negro, and he did not meet\r\nwith any in Chile or Patagonia.\r\n\r\nMr. E. C. Taylor, in his paper on the Birds of the West Indies, mentions\r\nthe great abundance of Black Vultures at Port of Spain, in Trinidad.\r\nThey swarmed over the town, covered the roofs of the houses, and lived\r\non the best terms with the poultry. So tame and familiar were they that\r\nhe often poked them with his stick or umbrella as he walked through the\r\nstreets. At night they roosted in the trees in the gardens and squares\r\nof the town. They were very abundant all over Trinidad and in the parts\r\nof Venezuela he visited, but he found none in any of the islands from\r\nTrinidad to St. Thomas. This species was not found in Jamaica by Mr.\r\nGosse, but Mr. March afterwards reported it as a “recent settler.”\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Catharista atrata._]\r\n\r\nMr. G. C. Taylor (Ibis, 1860, p. 22) found the Black Vulture very\r\nabundant in Honduras, where it is always to be seen in the villages,\r\nsitting on the roofs of the houses, wheeling in flocks high in the air,\r\nor feeding on the offal in the streets. They were very tame and very\r\nnumerous, forty or fifty being frequently seen in a single company. They\r\nabounded in all parts of Central America that he visited.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of _Quiscalus macrurus_, Mr. Salvin regards this\r\nspecies as the most familiar bird in Guatemala. At night they retired to\r\nthe forests, and in the early morning trooped back to their posts in the\r\nstreets and lanes, and about the tops of the houses and churches. They\r\ngenerally nested in the forests, though in Antigua Guatemala they were\r\nsaid to use the ruins of the old churches for that purpose.\r\n\r\nMr. Dresser found this Vulture about equally common with the _R.\r\naura_ on the Lower Rio Grande, but much less common near San Antonio.\r\nHe usually found the two species in company, attended also by the\r\n_Polyborus auduboni_ and _Craxirex harrisi_. They were found breeding\r\namong the rocks at Systerdale, where they were said to be the only\r\nspecies found.\r\n\r\nDr. Coues did not meet with any in Arizona, nor were any taken on the\r\nsurvey of the Mexican boundary. In South Carolina he considered it\r\nchiefly confined to the lower country, while the _C. aura_ is more\r\ngenerally distributed over the State. The two meet together freely, and\r\nas they circle about in each other’s company they afford an excellent\r\nopportunity of noticing the great differences in their mode of flight\r\nand in the outline of their bodies and wings. On the other hand, Wilson,\r\nOrd, and others deny that the two kinds live together.\r\n\r\nIn the Southern Atlantic cities, especially Charleston and Savannah, the\r\nBlack Vulture is a semi-domestic bird, and is very abundant. It is also\r\nto be found in the interior, but is neither so common nor so tame.\r\n\r\nThe _Catharista atratus_ is said to be much more sensitive to cold\r\nthan the _aura_, and when the weather is at all unfavorable they cower\r\naround the tops of chimneys to enjoy the heat. Though tolerated and even\r\nprotected by law, their filthy habits render them a source of annoyance\r\nto those whose houses they frequent. Their value as scavengers and\r\nthe services they render in the removal of offal render them almost a\r\nnecessity in Southern cities.\r\n\r\nBoth in their mode of flight and in their movements upon the ground\r\nthis species differs materially from the Turkey-Buzzard. The latter\r\nwalks steadily while on the ground, and when it mounts does so by a\r\nsingle upward spring. The Black Vulture is ill at ease on the ground,\r\nmoves awkwardly, and when it essays to fly upward takes several leaps\r\nin a shuffling sidelong manner before it can rise. Their flight is more\r\nlabored, and is continued by flapping several times, alternating with\r\nsailing a limited distance. Their wings are held at right angles, and\r\ntheir feet protrude beyond their tail-feathers. In all these respects\r\nthe differences between the two birds are very noticeable, and plainly\r\nmark the species.\r\n\r\nMr. Audubon states that at the commencement of the mating-season, early\r\nin February, the gesticulations of the males are very conspicuous. They\r\nstrut in the manner of a Turkey-cock, open their wings, lower their\r\nheads, and utter a puffing sound that is anything but musical.\r\n\r\nAlexander Wilson describes with great minuteness a scene he witnessed\r\nnear Charleston, where the carcass of a horse was devoured by these\r\nbirds, the ground for hundreds of yards around being black with them.\r\nHe counted at one time two hundred and thirty-seven, while others\r\nwere in the air flying around. He ventured within a few yards of the\r\nhorse without their heeding his presence. They frequently attacked\r\none another, fighting with their claws and striking with their open\r\nwings, fixing their claws in each other’s head. They made a hissing\r\nsound with open mouths, resembling that produced by thrusting a red-hot\r\npoker into water, and occasionally a snuffling noise, as if clearing\r\ntheir nostrils. At times one would emerge with a large fragment, and in\r\na moment would be surrounded by several others, who would tear it in\r\npieces and soon cause it to disappear.\r\n\r\nThe Black Vulture breeds on or near the ground in the same manner as the\r\nTurkey-Buzzard, in hollow logs, decayed trunks of trees, and stumps,\r\nand also without this protection, the bare earth only being made use\r\nof. It is said to make no nest. The eggs seldom, if ever, exceed two\r\nin number. These are greater, both in their length and capacity, than\r\nthose of the Turkey-Buzzard, although the measurements of the birds\r\nthemselves would seem to show the latter to be apparently the larger\r\nbird. The average weight of the Black Vulture’s egg, however, is about\r\none pound, or fifteen per cent greater than that of the Buzzard.\r\nThree from Charleston, Galveston, and the Rio Grande furnish the\r\nfollowing measurements: 3.81 inches by 1.94; 3 by 2.06; 3.06 by 1.94.\r\nThe principal difference between the eggs of this and the preceding\r\nspecies is in regard to their size. Their ground-color is the same, or\r\nnearly the same,—a yellowish-white or cream-color, almost never a pure\r\nwhite, and only in exceptional cases. The eggs are more elongate in\r\ntheir shape, and the blotches are usually larger. These are of a dark\r\nreddish-brown, confluent, and chiefly distributed around the larger\r\nend. There are also markings, smaller and less frequent, of lilac and\r\npurplish-drab, similar to those noticed in the eggs of _C. aura_. An\r\negg from the Rio Grande is marked with small spots of reddish-brown and\r\nobscure lilac, equally distributed over the whole surface on a ground of\r\ncream-color.\r\n\r\nMr. Audubon is positive that this Vulture never breeds in trees, and\r\nthat they never build any nest, but deposit their eggs on the ground,\r\non a dead log, or in a hollow tree. Twenty-one days are required for\r\nhatching their eggs, on which the male and female sit by turns and feed\r\neach other. The young are covered with a light cream-colored down, and\r\nare fed with regurgitated food, in the manner of Pigeons. As soon as\r\nthey are able, they follow their parents through the woods, at which\r\nperiod their entire head and neck, which afterwards become bare, are\r\ncovered with feathers.\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTE.\r\n\r\nThe following figures are given to illustrate some of the cranial and\r\nsternal peculiarities of the _Cathartidæ_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    14.

The basal portion of the bill covered by a soft skin, in which\r\nare situated the nostrils, overhung by an incumbent fleshy valve, the\r\napical portion hard and convex. The hind toe on the same level with the\r\nrest; the anterior toes without membrane at the base. Tarsi more or less\r\nnaked; covered laterally and behind with hexagonal scales.\r\n\r\nThe bill of the _Columbidæ_ is always shorter than the head, thinnest in\r\nthe middle; the basal half covered by a soft skin; the apical portion\r\nof both jaws hard; the upper one very convex, blunt, and broad at the\r\ntip, where it is also somewhat decurved. There is a long nasal groove,\r\nthe posterior portion occupied by a cartilaginous scale, covered by a\r\nsoft cere-like skin. The nostrils constitute an elongated slit in the\r\nlower border of the scale. The culmen is always depressed and convex.\r\nThe bill is never notched in the true Doves, though _Didunculus_ shows\r\nwell-defined serrations. The tongue is small, soft, and somewhat fleshy.\r\n\r\nThe wing has ten primaries, and eleven or twelve, rarely fifteen,\r\nsecondaries; the latter broad, truncate, and of nearly equal length. The\r\ntail is rounded or cuneate, never forked.\r\n\r\nThe tarsus is usually short, rarely longer than the middle toe,\r\nscutellate anteriorly, and with hexagonal plates laterally and behind;\r\nsometimes naked. An inter-digital membrane is either wanting entirely,\r\nor else is very slightly indicated between the middle and outer toes.\r\n\r\nThe valuable monograph of Bonaparte in the second part of _Conspectus\r\nAvium_ renders the task of arranging the American _Columbidæ_ in\r\nproper sequence and of determining their synonomy comparatively easy.\r\nHe divides the family into _Lopholæminæ_, _Columbinæ_, _Turturinæ_,\r\n_Zenaidinæ_, and _Phapinæ_, the second and fourth alone occurring in\r\nNorth America. They may be briefly distinguished as follows:—\r\n\r\n  =Columbinæ.= Tarsus shorter than the lateral toe; feathered above.\r\n\r\n  =Zenaidinæ.= Tarsus longer than the lateral toes; entirely bare of\r\n  feathers.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBFAMILY COLUMBINÆ.\r\n\r\nCHAR. Tarsi stout, short, with transverse scutellæ anteriorly; feathered\r\nfor the basal third above, but not at all behind. Toes lengthened, the\r\nlateral decidedly longer than the tarsus. Wings lengthened and pointed.\r\nSize large. Tail-feathers twelve.\r\n\r\nThis section of doves embraces the largest North American species, and\r\namong them the more arboreal ones. The genera are as follows:—\r\n\r\n  =Columba.= Head large; tail short, broad, and rounded.\r\n\r\n    Outer toe much longer than the inner; bill rather short, stout …\r\n\r\n                                                              _Columba._\r\n\r\n    Outer toe scarcely longer than the inner; bill lengthened,\r\n    compressed …\r\n\r\n                                                           _Patagiœnas._\r\n\r\n  =Ectopistes.= Head very small; tail much lengthened, cuneate.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS COLUMBA, LINNÆUS.\r\n\r\n  _Columba_, LINNÆUS, Syst.

Reichenbach and Bonaparte separate the North American birds\r\nfrom _Columba_, under the name of _Chlorœnas_, while _C. leucocephala_\r\nand a near ally of the West Indies (_C. corensis_) have been placed in\r\nthe subgenus _Patagiœnas_, Reichenbach.\r\n\r\nThe variations of form among the numerous American members of _Columba_\r\nare more with the species, however, than with groups, and withal are so\r\nexceedingly slight that an attempt at subdividing the genus is scarcely\r\njustifiable. They may be arranged by the style of coloration as follows.\r\nNone of the American species have the forepart of the neck metallic,\r\nas in the European species, or _Columba_ proper, as restricted, and\r\nin which these metallic feathers have the fibres loose and blended,\r\ninstead of being compact; the feathers also have a well-defined squamate\r\narrangement in nearly or quite all the American _Columbæ_.\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecies and Varieties.\r\n\r\n  =A.= Tail with a broad terminal band abruptly lighter in color than\r\n  the basal portion, and with a more or less well-defined blackish band\r\n  across the middle.

Soc.

Guatemalan skins have the white edgings\r\nto the wing-coverts less conspicuous than in northern ones, showing an\r\napproximation to the features of var. _albilinea_ of Costa Rica; they\r\nalso have a shorter bill than California specimens. Oregon birds, on the\r\nother hand, have longer bills than the California, and are considerably\r\ndarker in color.\r\n\r\nHABITS. The Band-tailed Pigeon was first met with in Long’s expedition\r\nto the Rocky Mountains, and described by Say in 1823. It is found\r\nfrom the northern Rocky Mountains westward to the Pacific, and from\r\nCentral America northward along the whole of the Pacific Coast as far\r\nto the north as Washington Territory, and probably portions of British\r\nColumbia.\r\n\r\nMr. Townsend, quoted by Audubon, noticed this Pigeon from the eastern\r\nspurs of the Rocky Mountains across to the Columbia River, where it was\r\nvery abundant. He noticed their arrival in very great numbers on the\r\n17th of April, and they continued in large flocks even while breeding.\r\nTheir breeding-places were on the banks of the river, the eggs were\r\nplaced on the ground, under small bushes without any nest, where numbers\r\ncongregated together. The eggs were two in number, and are described as\r\nof a yellowish-white color, some inclining to a bluish-white with minute\r\nwhite dots at the larger end.\r\n\r\nThese birds feed on the berries of the black-elder and the buds of the\r\nbalsam poplar. When sitting on the trees, they huddle close together in\r\nthe manner of the Carolina Parrot, and many may be killed at a single\r\ndischarge. Their flesh is said to be tender, juicy, and fine eating.\r\n\r\nMr. Nuttall states that this Pigeon is always in flocks, and in Oregon\r\nkeeps only in the thick forests of the Columbia and the Wahlamet, and\r\nduring the summer is more particularly abundant in the alluvial groves\r\nof the latter river, where he constantly heard its cooing, and saw\r\nit in large flocks, feeding on the berries of the elder, the _Cornus\r\nnuttalli_, and the seed-germs and young pods of the balsam poplar. Its\r\ncall is somewhat similar to that of the Carolina Dove, but is readily\r\ndistinguishable, is uttered at the usual intervals, and is repeated an\r\nhour or two at a time, chiefly in the morning and evening. It remains\r\non the lower part of the Columbia nearly the whole year, feeding on the\r\nberries of the tree cornel, moving south only in the severity of winter.\r\n\r\nMr. Salvin found this Pigeon at Volcan de Fuego, in Guatemala, at an\r\nelevation of six thousand feet, and at Coban. It was quite common in the\r\nhigh forests of the Volcano.\r\n\r\nDr. Woodhouse met with small flocks of these Pigeons in different parts\r\nof New Mexico, and especially in the San Francisco Mountains, now\r\nincluded within the limits of Arizona.\r\n\r\nThis species was found at Los Nogales, in Mexico, July, 1855, by Dr.\r\nKennerly, and at New Leon by Lieutenant Couch. Dr. Kennerly states that\r\nthese beautiful birds were often observed in the valleys of the Santa\r\nCruz and Los Nogales Rivers, as well as among the oaks on the adjacent\r\nhills. In the month of June they were found in small flocks of four or\r\nfive, rarely more. When flying, the wings often caused a flapping noise,\r\nsimilar to that made by the domestic Pigeon.\r\n\r\nDr. Newberry, in his Report on the zoölogy of Colonel Williamson’s\r\nroute, states that he met with this Pigeon at several points of his\r\njourney. He speaks of it as an attractive bird, about the size and with\r\nmany of the habits of the domestic Pigeon. At McCumbers, northeast of\r\nFort Reading, the first individual was seen and killed by one of his\r\nparty. In that region they were not rare, and during the season of\r\nacorns they subsist on those of the scrub-oak, which abounds in that\r\nvicinity. On the Columbia they were seen in pairs, and near the Dalles\r\nmight readily be mistaken for domestic doves.\r\n\r\nDr. Suckley found this Pigeon a very common bird in Washington\r\nTerritory, especially west of the Cascade Mountains. He saw but a single\r\nflock containing five individuals east of those mountains. In 1856,\r\nthe first birds of this species that arrived in the spring made their\r\nappearance about the 15th of May, which he found to be their customary\r\ntime of arrival. One or two individuals were first seen, and within two\r\nor three days thereafter the main body of the migration followed. A\r\nsmall number remained throughout the summer to breed, the rest proceeded\r\nfarther north. Those that remained generally made their nests in the\r\nthick fir forests near water. During the summer they subsisted on wild\r\ncherries and other berries, and later in the season, in the settled\r\nparts of the country, on grain. About the first week in September\r\nlarge flocks congregated on the stubble-fields in the vicinity of Fort\r\nSteilacoom, and for two or three weeks thereafter their numbers were\r\ndaily augmented by arrivals from the north. Some of the flocks that he\r\nsaw in September, he states, must have contained at least a thousand\r\nindividuals. He was told that on the cultivated districts on Cowlitz\r\nRiver, at the same season, they were in still greater numbers. By the\r\n5th of October all had suddenly disappeared, except a few stragglers,\r\ngenerally young birds. In their flights, Dr. Suckley states, they are\r\nnot quite as compactly crowded as in the case of the Passenger Pigeon.\r\nDuring the summer, while they were breeding, their cooing and calls\r\ncould be heard quite a long distance. The name of this bird in the\r\nNisqually language is “Hubboh,” in imitation of their call. In the\r\nautumn these birds are said to be excellent eating.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr. Cooper, these Pigeons arrive at the Columbia River in\r\nApril, and frequent all the forests of the Territory until the end of\r\nOctober, when they retire south. They keep about the borders of prairies\r\nand clearings, and frequently do much damage to fields of grain, though\r\nnever found in such immense numbers as the common Passenger Pigeon east\r\nof the Mississippi. In June they lay two white eggs about the size of\r\nthose of the House Pigeon, on the ground near streams or openings, and\r\nwithout constructing any nests. During the summer they were observed to\r\nfeed upon wild peas, wild cherries, and other wild fruits and berries,\r\nwhich are very abundant. Later in the season they seem to depend upon\r\nacorns and other nuts. Their cooing is very much like that of the common\r\nPigeon. He saw none east of the Cascade Range.\r\n\r\nMr. Ridgway did not meet with this Pigeon in his route from the Sierra\r\nNevada eastward to the Rocky Mountains, along the line of the 40th\r\nparallel, and it is supposed not to occur in that latitude except near\r\nthe Pacific Coast.\r\n\r\nAn egg of this Pigeon, given me by Dr. Holden, of Stockton, and obtained\r\nin the Coast Range, is oval in shape, equally rounded at either end, and\r\nof a dull white. It measures 1.49 inches in length by 1.15 in breadth.\r\nAnother, in the Smithsonian collection, measures 1.55 by 1.20 inches.\r\n\r\n\r\nColumba leucocephala, LINN.\r\n\r\nWHITE-HEADED PIGEON.\r\n\r\n  _Columba leucocephala_, LINN.

The White-headed Pigeon occurs in the more southern of the keys\r\nof Florida, but, so far as I am aware, has never been taken on any part\r\nof the mainland. It is an abundant species in Cuba, Jamaica, and in most\r\nof the other West India Islands.\r\n\r\nThis Dove, according to Audubon, arrives on the southern keys of Florida\r\nabout the 20th of April, sometimes not until the first of May. On the\r\n30th of April he shot several just after their arrival from across the\r\nGulf Stream. He noticed them as they approached the shore, skimming\r\nalong the surface of the water, and flying with great rapidity, in the\r\nmanner of the House Pigeon. As they approached the land they rose to\r\nabout a hundred yards, flying in circles as if to survey the country.\r\nTo procure specimens, it was necessary to force them out from the dark\r\nretreats in which they had alighted. They were at all times exceedingly\r\nshy and wary, probably on account of the war that is incessantly waged\r\nagainst them, their flesh being very juicy and finely flavored. This\r\nshyness is only partially abated even during the breeding-season,\r\nas they will silently slide from their nest when sitting, if it is\r\napproached, and retreat to the dark shade of the mangroves, and do not\r\nreturn for an interval to their charge. They were more abundant in the\r\nmore southern keys, except the sterile Tortugas.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. March, there are two varieties of this Pigeon, known\r\nas the Baldpate in Jamaica, distinguished as the Mountain and the\r\nMangrove Baldpate. The latter he has never met with in the mountains,\r\nbut both kinds resort at all times to the lowlands and mangrove-swamps\r\nalong the coasts, and to the neighboring islands and keys (Pigeon\r\nIsland and the two Goat Islands in particular), where they breed in\r\nnumbers, making their nests in trees, some at high elevations, others\r\nso low as to be within reach of a person standing, according to the\r\nconvenience of the site. Large numbers of squabs are often taken from\r\nthese places and brought into the towns for sale. They feed in company\r\nin the morning and afternoon, and as they often feed at a distance\r\nfrom their roosting-places, large flocks are sometimes seen in the\r\nearly morning and evening passing and repassing overhead, sometimes in\r\nhigh, at other times in low flight, going to and returning from the\r\nfeeding-ground or convenient watering-place. Their food is grain, fruit,\r\nand berries, nuts and seeds; and they commit serious depredations on\r\nthe Guinea-corn fields, not only by the quantity they devour, but by\r\nbreaking down the brittle cornstalks with the weight of their bodies.\r\nThey are easily kept in confinement, and often breed and become quiet\r\nand contented, but take the earliest opportunity of emancipation. The\r\nnest is a platform of sticks and twigs loosely put together, and bedded\r\nwith softer materials, with a slight hollow in the centre. The eggs are\r\ntwo, glarish-white in color, varying in form and dimensions, but usually\r\nlong oval, measuring 1.63 inches in length by 1.13 in breadth.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Leyland (Ibis, I, p. 222) this Pigeon inhabits the keys\r\nor small islands on the coast of Honduras.\r\n\r\nIt was found at St. Croix by Professor Alfred Newton, frequenting the\r\nhills in the north of the island, and occasionally in the brush-land on\r\nthe south side. It was not very common, and was said to be a visitor\r\nfrom Porto Rico; but it undoubtedly breeds on the island of St. Croix,\r\nas Professor Newton obtained a young bird, shot July 28, which could\r\nnot have left the nest many days. A caged specimen of this bird, that\r\nhad been in the possession of Dr. Carden of St. Croix several years,\r\nwas given to Professor Newton by that gentleman, and presented to the\r\nZoölogical Society of London.\r\n\r\nMr. Audubon found the nests placed high or low according to\r\ncircumstances, but never saw two on the same tree. He has met with\r\nthem on the top of a cactus, only a few feet from the ground, or on\r\na low branch of a mangrove almost touching the water. They are said\r\nto resemble that of the common Passenger Pigeon, but are more compact\r\nand better lined; the outer part being composed of small dry twigs,\r\nthe inner of fibrous roots and grasses. The eggs are two, of an opaque\r\nwhite, roundish, and as large as those of the common Pigeon. Mr. Audubon\r\nthinks that these birds may have several broods in a season. None were\r\nknown by him to visit the mainland of Florida.\r\n\r\nIn captivity these birds may be easily managed, and breed readily, as\r\nMr. Audubon witnessed in the aviaries of Dr. Wilson and Rev. Dr. Bachman\r\nof Charleston, S. C.\r\n\r\nIn confinement they are said never to lay more than a single egg. The\r\nmeasurement of their eggs, as given by Mr. Audubon, is 1.31 inches in\r\nlength by 1.06 in breadth. Eggs in my cabinet from Cuba measure 1.40 by\r\n1.03 inches. They are of a pure but not a brilliant white color, equal\r\nat either end and oval in shape.\r\n\r\n\r\nColumba flavirostris, WAGLER.\r\n\r\nRED-BILLED DOVE.\r\n\r\n  _Columba flavirostris_, WAGLER, Isis, 1831, 519.—LAWRENCE, Annals\r\n  N.

The West Indian bird is much the\r\nlarger, however, the bill black, and very differently shaped.\r\n\r\nThe _Columba solitaria_ of McCall appears to be closely related to this\r\nspecies, but, judging from the description, seems to differ in having\r\nthe head and neck bluish rather than red. It may possibly be the female\r\nof _C. flavirostris_, as this sex usually has a bluish tinge instead of\r\nred; the smaller size, too, would favor this supposition.[105]\r\n\r\n=Habits.= The Red-billed Dove claims a place in the North American\r\nfauna only as a resident in the valley of the Lower Rio Grande River.\r\nIt appears also to be found on and near the gulf-coast of Mexico and\r\nCentral America.\r\n\r\nIt was taken at New Leon, Mexico, in March, 1853, by Lieutenant Couch,\r\nand on the Rio Grande by Mr. A. Schott. It was first seen by the former\r\nin the thick woody bottoms of the San Juan, New Leon. The birds were\r\nquite common, but remained very secluded. They are said to be of very\r\nrapid flight.\r\n\r\nMr. G. C. Taylor (Ibis, 1860, p. 226) mentions finding these birds not\r\nuncommon on Tigre Island, in Honduras, but did not meet with them in the\r\ninterior. He speaks of them as very handsome birds, but gives no account\r\nof their habits.\r\n\r\nMr. Henry E. Dresser found the Red-billed Dove quite common near\r\nMatamoras, and breeding there. During the autumn great quantities, as\r\nwell as of the _leucoptera_ and the _carolinensis_, are brought to the\r\nmarket for sale. At Brownsville, also, these birds were not uncommon,\r\nbut were found for only a short distance towards the interior of Texas,\r\nand none were seen higher up the Rio Grande than Roma. A Mexican, who\r\nshot doves for the market, informed Mr. Dresser that he had found this\r\nspecies breeding near the town of Matamoras, and that it builds a nest\r\nsomewhat similar to that of _Z. carolinensis_, but that its two eggs\r\nare somewhat larger. Their stomachs were found filled with a kind of\r\nblueberry.\r\n\r\nEggs in the Berlandier collection are oval in shape, equal and slightly\r\ntapering at either end, and of a creamy-white color. They measure 1.18\r\ninches in length by .90 of an inch in breadth.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ECTOPISTES, SWAINSON.\r\n\r\n  _Ectopistes_, SWAINSON, Zoöl. Jour. III, 1827, 362.

The inner primaries are more broadly margined with light\r\nblue, which tapers off to the end. The axillars and under surface of the\r\nwing are light blue. The longest scapulars have the black on both webs.\r\nThere is no blue on the outer web of the first tail-feather, which is\r\nwhite, as is the inferior surface of the tail generally.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Ectopistes migratoria._]\r\n\r\nIn some specimens the entire head all round is blue.\r\n\r\nThe immature male varies in having most of the feathers of the head and\r\nbody margined with whitish.\r\n\r\nHABITS. The common Passenger Pigeon of North America is found throughout\r\nthe continent in great abundance, from the Atlantic to the great Central\r\nPlains, and from the Southern States, in which it only occasionally\r\noccurs, to at least the 62d parallel of northern latitude, in the\r\ninterior.\r\n\r\nRichardson states that this Pigeon arrives in the fur countries in the\r\nlatter part of May and leaves in October. On the coast of Hudson’s\r\nBay it reaches no farther than the 58th parallel, and only in very\r\nfine summers, but in the interior or in the warmer central districts\r\nit attains to the 62d degree. Mr. Hutchins mentions, as a remarkable\r\noccurrence, that a flock of these Pigeons visited York Factory and\r\nremained two days.\r\n\r\nIt is not found on the Pacific coast. Dr. Suckley only met with a single\r\nbird in immature plumage on a branch of Milk River, in Nebraska, about\r\none hundred and seventy-five miles east of the Rocky Mountains; he\r\nthinks the eastern base may be considered their western limit. Dr.\r\nCooper has seen it at Fort Laramie, but has never seen nor heard of it\r\nin Oregon, though Townsend mentions it as found there.\r\n\r\nDr. Woodhouse found these Pigeons common throughout the Indian Territory\r\nin the spring and fall, during their migrations.\r\n\r\nCaptain Blakiston noticed the first arrival of the Passenger Pigeons at\r\nFort Carlton, on the 23d of May. By the middle of June numerous flocks\r\nwere moving northward. These could, at a long distance, be readily\r\ndistinguished from flocks of water-fowl or waders, by their flight being\r\nin no particular order. On the Mackenzie, Mr. Ross observed these birds\r\nas far north as Fort Norman in latitude 65°, while on the coast of\r\nHudson’s Bay they are only found as far as 58°, even in warm summers.\r\n\r\nThe Wild Pigeon appears to be almost entirely influenced in its\r\nmigrations by the abundance of its food, excepting in those parts of the\r\ncountry in which it has not been known to remain during winter. Even in\r\nthese movements it is largely influenced by instinctive considerations\r\nof food. Evidently the temperature has but little to do with their\r\nmigrations, as they not unfrequently move northward in large columns\r\nas early as the 7th of March, with a thermometer twenty degrees below\r\nthe freezing-point. In the spring of 1872 a large accumulation of\r\nthese birds took place early in March, in the eastern portion of New\r\nYork. They were present in the forests about Albany, and were taken in\r\nsuch immense numbers that the markets of New York and Boston were very\r\nlargely supplied with them.\r\n\r\nAs early as the 10th of March they were ascertained to have in their\r\novaries full-grown eggs, ready for exclusion. In Kentucky they have been\r\nknown, according to Audubon, to remain summer and winter in the same\r\ndistricts for several successive years, in consequence of the great\r\nabundance of food, while in other parts of the State none were to be met\r\nwith. They suddenly disappeared as soon as the beech-mast had become\r\nexhausted, and did not return for a long period.\r\n\r\nThe Wild Pigeons are capable of propelling themselves in long-continued\r\nflights, and are known to move with an almost incredible rapidity,\r\npassing over a great extent of country in a very short time. It is\r\nquite a common and well-ascertained fact that Pigeons are captured in\r\nthe State of New York with their crops still filled with the undigested\r\ngrains of rice that must have been taken in the distant fields of\r\nGeorgia or South Carolina, apparently proving that they must have passed\r\nover the intervening space within a very few hours. Audubon estimates\r\nthe rapidity of their flight as at least a mile a minute.\r\n\r\nThe Wild Pigeons are said to move, in their flight, by quickly repeated\r\nflaps of the wings, which are brought more or less near to the body,\r\naccording to the degree of velocity required. During the love-season\r\nthey often fly in a circling manner, supporting themselves with both\r\nwings angularly elevated. Before alighting, they break the force of\r\ntheir flight by repeated flappings.\r\n\r\nTheir great powers of flight, and the ability thus given to change at\r\nwill their residence, and their means of renewing a supply of food, are\r\nalso thought to be seconded by a remarkable power of vision, enabling\r\nthem to discover their food with great readiness. Mr. Audubon states\r\nthat he has observed flocks of these birds, in passing over a sterile\r\npart of the country, fly high in the air, with an extended front,\r\nenabling them to survey hundreds of acres at once. When the land is\r\nrichly covered with food, or the trees well supplied with mast, they fly\r\nlow in order to discover the part most plentifully supplied.\r\n\r\nSeveral writers, who have witnessed the occasionally enormous flights\r\nof these Pigeons, have given very full and graphic accounts of their\r\nimmense numbers that seem hardly credible to those who have not seen\r\nthem. Mr. Audubon relates that in 1813, on his way from Henderson to\r\nLouisville, in crossing the barrens near Hardensburg, he observed\r\nthese birds flying to the southwest in greater numbers than he had\r\never known before. He attempted to count the different flocks as they\r\nsuccessively passed, but after counting one hundred and sixty-three in\r\ntwenty-one minutes he gave it up as impracticable. As he journeyed on,\r\ntheir numbers seemed to increase. The air seemed filled with Pigeons,\r\nand the light of noonday to be obscured as by an eclipse. Not a single\r\nbird alighted, as the woods were destitute of mast, and all flew so high\r\nthat he failed to reach any with a rifle. He speaks of their aerial\r\nevolutions as beautiful in the extreme, especially when a Hawk pressed\r\nupon the rear of a flock. All at once, like a torrent, and with a noise\r\nlike that of thunder, they rushed together into a compact mass, and\r\ndarted forward in undulating lines, descending and sweeping near the\r\nearth with marvellous velocity, then mounting almost perpendicularly\r\nin a vast column, wheeling and twisting so that their continued lines\r\nseemed to resemble the coils of a gigantic serpent. During the whole\r\nof his journey from Hardensburg to Louisville, fifty-five miles, they\r\ncontinued to pass in undiminished numbers, and also did so during the\r\nthree following days. At times they flew so low that multitudes were\r\ndestroyed, and for many days the entire population seemed to eat nothing\r\nelse but Pigeons.\r\n\r\nWhen a flight of Pigeons discovers an abundant supply of food,\r\nsufficient to induce them to alight, they are said to pass around in\r\ncircles over the place, making various evolutions, after a while passing\r\nlower over the woods, and at length alighting; then, as if suddenly\r\nalarmed, taking to flight, only to return immediately. These manœuvres\r\nare repeated with various indications of indecision in their movements,\r\nor as if apprehensive of unseen dangers. During these manœuvres the\r\nflapping of their many thousand wings causes a reverberation suggestive\r\nof distant thunder. When at last settled upon the ground, they\r\nindustriously search among the fallen leaves for the acorns and the\r\nbeech-mast, the rear flocks continually rising, passing over the main\r\nbody, and realighting. These changes are so frequent that at times the\r\nwhole collection appears to be in motion. A large extent of ground is\r\nthus cleared in a surprisingly short space of time, and cleared with a\r\ncompleteness that is described as incredible. They are usually satiated\r\nby the middle of the day, and ascend to the trees to rest and digest\r\ntheir food. On these occasions the Pigeons are destroyed in immense\r\nnumbers, and their abundance in large extents of the country has been\r\nvery sensibly reduced.\r\n\r\nIn its movements on the ground, as also when alighted on the branches of\r\ntrees, the Wild Pigeon is remarkable for its ease and grace. It walks on\r\nthe ground and also on the limbs of trees with an easy, graceful motion,\r\nfrequently jerking its tail and moving its neck backward and forward.\r\n\r\nMr. Audubon states that in Kentucky he has repeatedly visited one of\r\nthe remarkable roosting-places to which these birds resort at night.\r\nThis one was on the banks of Green River, and to this place the birds\r\ncame every night at sunset, arriving from all directions, some of them\r\nfrom the distance of several hundred miles, as was conjectured from\r\ncertain observations. This roost was in a portion of the forest where\r\nthe trees were of great magnitude. It was more than forty miles in\r\nlength, and averaged three in breadth. It had been occupied as a roost\r\nabout a fortnight when he visited it. Their dung was several inches\r\ndeep on the ground, covering the whole extent of the roosting-place.\r\nMany trees, two feet in diameter, had been broken down by their weight,\r\nas well as many branches of the largest and tallest trees. The forest\r\nseemed as if it had been swept by a tornado. Everything gave evidence\r\nthat the number of birds resorting to that part of the forest must be\r\nimmense. A large number of persons collected before sunset to destroy\r\nthem, provided with torches of pine-knots, and armed with long poles\r\nand guns. The Pigeons began to collect after sunset, their approach\r\npreceded, even when they were at a distance, by a noise like that of\r\na hard gale at sea sounding in the rigging of a vessel. As the birds\r\npassed over him, they created a strong current of air. The birds arrived\r\nby thousands, fires were lighted, and the work of destruction commenced.\r\nMany were knocked down by the pole-men. In many cases they collected in\r\nsuch solid masses on the branches that several of their perches gave way\r\nand fell to the ground, in this way destroying hundreds of the birds\r\nbeneath them. It was a scene of great confusion and continued until past\r\nmidnight, the Pigeons still continuing to arrive. The sound made by the\r\nbirds at the roost could be heard at the distance of three miles. As day\r\napproached, the noise in some measure subsided; and long before objects\r\nwere distinguishable the Pigeons began to move off, and before daylight\r\nall that were able to fly had disappeared. The dead and wounded birds\r\nwere then collected and piled into heaps by those who had assembled for\r\nthe purpose.\r\n\r\nThough for the most part living, moving, and feeding together in large\r\ncompanies, the Wild Pigeon mates in pairs for purposes of breeding. They\r\nhave several broods in the season, and commence nesting very early in\r\nthe spring, the time being considerably affected by the amount of food.\r\nIn the spring of 1849 an immense number of these birds collected on\r\nFayston Mountain, near Montpelier, Vt., although at the time of their\r\ncoming the weather was very cold and the ground covered with snow.\r\nThere they seemed to find a great abundance of food, berries of the\r\nmountain-ash and such other fruit as they could procure, and there they\r\nremained, breeding in great numbers, until late in the summer. They were\r\nstill collected in June, although the whole neighborhood was warring\r\nupon them for many miles around, and the markets of Boston and other\r\nplaces were largely supplied with them.\r\n\r\nIn the extensive forests of Kentucky, Mr. Audubon found them usually\r\ncollecting and breeding in trees of great height, and always at a\r\nconvenient distance from water, resorting thither in countless myriads.\r\nTheir note, during breeding, is described as a short _coo-coo_, much\r\nbriefer than in the domestic Pigeon, while their usual call-note is a\r\nrepetition of the monosyllables _kee-kee-kee_, the first note being\r\nlouder and the last fainter than the rest. In the love-season the male\r\nputs on the pompous manners peculiar to all Pigeons, and follows the\r\nfemale with drooping wings and expanded tail, the body being held in\r\nan elevated attitude and the throat swollen. Occasionally they caress\r\none another in the same manner in which they feed their young, by\r\nintroducing the bill of one into that of the other and disgorging the\r\ncontents of their crops.\r\n\r\nTheir nests are composed of a few dry twigs laid crosswise, and built\r\nupon the branches of trees. From fifty to a hundred were seen by Audubon\r\nin the same tree, and were said to be frequently at a considerable\r\nheight. The few I have seen were in low trees, and not more than ten\r\nfeet from the ground. The eggs are never more than two in number, pure\r\nwhite, and of a broadly elliptical form. During incubation the male bird\r\nfeeds the mate and afterwards assists in supplying the young birds, and\r\nboth birds are conspicuous in their demonstrations of affection, both to\r\neach other and to their offspring. The young brood, usually both sexes\r\nin one nest, leave their parents as soon as they are able to shift for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nIn the New England States and in the more cultivated part of the country\r\nthese birds no longer breed in large communities. The instance near\r\nMontpelier, in 1849, is the only marked exception that has come within\r\nmy knowledge. They now breed in isolated pairs, their nests being\r\nscattered through the woods and seldom near one another.\r\n\r\nThe Wild Pigeon has been successfully kept in aviaries, and has\r\noccasionally bred in confinement.\r\n\r\nWilson’s account of the habits of these Pigeons is substantially\r\ncorroborative of that of Audubon. He witnessed their migrations in\r\nvast numbers, in various parts of the country,—in Western New York,\r\nin Pennsylvania, in various parts of Virginia, where he beheld their\r\nimmense flocks with amazement, but where they were mere straggling\r\nparties compared with the congregated millions he saw in Ohio, Indiana,\r\nand Kentucky. He also noted their habit of frequenting the same\r\nroosting-place night after night, even when they were compelled to fly\r\nsixty or eighty miles each day to their feeding-places. His account\r\nof their roosting-places is similar to that of Audubon, corroborating\r\nthe accumulation of the dung covering the surface of the ground and\r\ndestroying all the grass and underbrush, the breaking down of large\r\nlimbs, and even of small trees, by the weight of the birds clustering\r\none above another, and the trees themselves at last killed as completely\r\nas if girdled by an axe.\r\n\r\nOne of the breeding-places visited by Wilson, not far from Shelbyville,\r\nKy., stretched through the forest in nearly a north and south direction.\r\nThis was several miles in breadth, and upwards of forty miles in extent.\r\nIn this immense tract nearly every tree was furnished with nests\r\nwherever there were branches to accommodate them. He was informed by\r\nthose who had sought to plunder the nests of the squabs, that the noise\r\nin the woods was so great as to terrify their horses, and that it was\r\ndifficult for one person to hear another speak. The ground was strewed\r\nwith broken limbs, eggs, and young Pigeons. Hawks were sailing about in\r\ngreat numbers, while from twenty feet upwards to the tops of the trees\r\nthere was a perpetual tumult of crowding and fluttering multitudes of\r\nPigeons, their wings resounding like thunder, and mingled with the\r\nfrequent crash of falling trees. In one instance he counted ninety nests\r\nin a single tree.\r\n\r\nWhen on his way from Shelbyville to Frankfort, Wilson witnessed an\r\nimmense flight of these birds, and was astonished at their appearance.\r\nThey were flying with great steadiness and rapidity in several strata\r\ndeep and very close together. From right to left, as far as the eye\r\ncould reach, this vast procession extended its immense breadth, seeming\r\neverywhere equally crowded. For more than an hour by the watch he stood\r\nand observed this prodigious procession, which, instead of diminishing,\r\nseemed rather to increase both in numbers and rapidity. Three hours\r\nlater, as he was entering Frankfort, the living torrent above his head\r\nwas as numerous and extended as when first observed. Wilson computed\r\nthe number of Pigeons in this flight at over two thousand two hundred\r\nmillions.\r\n\r\nThe most southern point at which this Pigeon is known to breed, as given\r\nby Wilson, was in the Choctaw country, in Mississippi, in latitude 32°.\r\n\r\nMr. Ridgway obtained a single specimen of this species in the West\r\nHumboldt Mountains, in September, 1867. It was a young bird, and had\r\nbeen feeding on the berries of a species of _Cornus_.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of the Wild Pigeon vary considerably in length, and also\r\nsomewhat in breadth. They average about 1.45 inches in length and 1.05\r\nin breadth. They are white in color, have an oval shape, and are equally\r\nrounded at both ends.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBFAMILY ZENAIDINÆ.\r\n\r\nCHAR. Tarsi stout, lengthened; always longer than the lateral toes, and\r\nentirely without feathers; the tibial joint usually denuded. Tarsus\r\nsometimes with hexagonal scales anteriorly. Tail-feathers sometimes\r\nfourteen.\r\n\r\nThis subfamily is readily distinguished from the preceding by the\r\nlonger and more denuded tarsi, the feet being much better fitted for a\r\nterrestrial life. The following sections belong to it:—\r\n\r\n  =Zenaideæ.= Size moderate. Wings lengthened, acute, the primaries much\r\n  longer than the secondaries. Tarsus scutellate anteriorly.

The Jamaica bird has rather a more decided wash of\r\nbrown on the neck and forehead, the toes apparently shorter; but as\r\nspecimens from the same locality vary in this respect, it is probable\r\nthat in a large series such differences will disappear in the average.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Melopelia leucoptera._]\r\n\r\nHABITS. This species is found on the Lower Rio Grande, in Arizona,\r\nand, according to Dr. Cooper, in California. It also occurs in Mexico,\r\nand was taken in Tamaulipas by Lieutenant Couch, March, 1858. It has\r\nalso been met with in several of the West India Islands and in Central\r\nAmerica.\r\n\r\nThis species is abundant in Jamaica, where, according to Mr. March, it\r\nis more a lowland than a mountain Dove. They are said to be gregarious,\r\nusually keeping in flocks of from ten to twenty, but in January and\r\nin February, in the Guinea-corn season, and at other times when the\r\n_Cerei_ are in fruit, they congregate in large flocks, often of several\r\nhundreds. Their food is principally grain and seeds, but they are\r\nequally fond of the ripe fruit of the different species of _Cereus_\r\nabounding on the savannas and salines during the summer. Inland, the\r\nWhite-wings, in the same manner as the Baldpate, breed in solitary\r\npairs; but in the mangrove swamps, and in the islands along the coast,\r\nthey breed in company, many in the same tree. The nest is a frail\r\nplatform of sticks, with a slight hollow lined with leaves and bark, and\r\nsometimes a few feathers. The eggs are two, of an oblong-oval shape,\r\nglarish-white in color, measuring 1.31 inches in length by .94 of an\r\ninch in breadth. Mr. March adds that the White-wing is often kept in\r\nconfinement, where it occasionally breeds. It is at first quite wild,\r\nfluttering in alarm at the approach of any person, but afterwards\r\nbecomes quite docile if attended with care. It has been known to cross\r\nand mate with the _Turtur risorius_, a bird which has been introduced\r\ninto Jamaica. Mr. March had, at the time his paper appeared, a male\r\nWhite-wing mated with a female Ringdove.\r\n\r\nThis species was found at Omoa, Honduras, by Mr. Leyland, and by Mr.\r\nSalvin about Dueñas, Guatemala, where it was one of the common Doves. It\r\nwas found on the ground, in the open savannas.\r\n\r\nMr. G. C. Taylor (Ibis, 1860) found this bird abundant in Central\r\nAmerica, especially on the Pacific coast and in the environs of\r\nComayagua. He adds that he found this species most plentiful in the\r\nvicinity of houses and cornfields, while the _Z. carolinensis_ seem to\r\nprefer the woods and open plains. Both were easily shot, and were found\r\nto be excellent eating.\r\n\r\nMr. Dresser found this species very common near Matamoras and\r\nBrownsville, and as far into the interior of Texas as Sal Colorado,\r\nafter which it becomes rare, and he never saw any farther east or north\r\nthan the Rio Nueces. It is not uncommon at Eagle Pass, where he saw\r\nmany in cages in the huts of the Mexicans. Their stomachs were found to\r\ncontain maize and caterpillars.\r\n\r\nMr. Xantus, in his notes upon the birds of Cape St. Lucas, mentions\r\nfinding several of the nests and eggs of this Dove. All the nests\r\nmentioned contained two eggs. One was in the fork of a leafless tree,\r\nabout ten feet from the ground; another was about six feet high and\r\nplaced on a small dwarf-oak; and a third, found May 20, was in a\r\nthorn-bush, about ten feet from the ground. In one instance a single\r\negg, already incubated, was found on the top of a large cactus trunk,\r\nbut without any indication of a nest.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of this species are oval in shape, white, of equal size at\r\neither end, and measure 1.35 inches by .92.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ZENAIDA, BONAP.\r\n\r\n  _Zenaida_, BONAPARTE, Geog. & Comp.

P. 1866).\r\n\r\nAmong many specimens of this species before us is one from Mr. Audubon’s\r\ncollection, probably procured in Florida. It must be much rarer now than\r\nformerly on the keys, as several collections of birds made on Indian Key\r\ndo not include any specimens.\r\n\r\nThe _Z. hypoleuca_, Gray,[106] of South America, is very similar, but\r\nlacks any trace of the broad white bar at the end of the secondaries.\r\nThere is more white on the tail, the feathers of which are narrower at\r\nthe ends; besides, the colors generally are lighter, the crissum being\r\ncreamy-white.\r\n\r\nHABITS. The Zenaida Dove was found by Mr. Audubon to be a transient\r\nvisitor of the keys of East Florida, where, according to his\r\nobservations, they made their first appearance among the islands around\r\nIndian Key about the 15th of April. There they continued to increase\r\nin numbers until October, when they all returned to the West India\r\nIslands, whence they came, and where they are most numerous. The males\r\nwere observed to reach the keys in which they passed the summer to breed\r\nbefore the females, and were heard cooing, as if in search of their\r\nmates, at least a week before the arrival of the latter. They begin\r\nto lay their eggs about the first of May. When they leave, in their\r\nautumnal migrations, they depart in small groups by families.\r\n\r\nThese birds are said by Mr. Audubon to be Ground Doves in habit. Their\r\nflight resembles that of the so-called Ground Dove, and is seldom higher\r\nthan the tops of the mangroves, and never to any considerable distance\r\nexcept during their migrations. Though they alight on trees with ease,\r\nand can walk well among their branches, they spend the greater portion\r\nof their time on the ground, and walk well there, walking or running in\r\nsearch of food with lightness and celerity, and invariably roost on the\r\nground.\r\n\r\nTheir flight is similar to that of the Carolina Dove in the firm\r\nmovements of the wings, though they do not produce the same whistling\r\nsounds. In flying over the water they keep near its surface; and when\r\nstarted from the ground they only fly to a short distance, and realight\r\nin the grass or a thicket. They are extremely gentle, so much so that\r\nMr. Audubon has occasionally approached so near as to almost touch them\r\nwith his gun as they stood gazing at him, apparently devoid of all fear.\r\n\r\nThey breed in the few keys that are covered with grass and low shrubs.\r\nThey always place their nest on the ground, often with so little\r\nconcealment that it may be easily discovered by any one searching for\r\nit. Occasionally it is placed between tufts of grass, the tops of which\r\nbend over and conceal it. A small hole is scooped in the sand in which\r\na slight nest, composed of matted blades of dry grasses, is placed,\r\ncircular in form, and embedded in an outer collection of dry leaves and\r\ntwigs. The whole fabric is said to be more compact than the nest of any\r\nother Pigeon. The eggs, always two, are described as pure white and\r\ntranslucent.\r\n\r\nWhen sitting on her eggs or on her young, the female rarely moved from\r\nthem except when an attempt was made to catch her, which she always\r\nevaded with great dexterity, gliding with great quickness to a short\r\ndistance, and watching the movements of the intruder with drooping wings\r\nand an air of deep sorrow, her whole frame trembling as if with intense\r\ncold.\r\n\r\nMr. Audubon took alive two of the young birds, which he fed from his\r\nmouth with Indian-corn meal. This they ate with avidity, until placed\r\nunder the care of a common tame Pigeon, that at once fostered them. They\r\nlived, and were taken to Dr. Bachman in Charleston.\r\n\r\nTheir notes are said to closely resemble the cooing of the Carolina\r\nDove, but are somewhat more soft and tender. During midday, when the\r\nheat in the central parts of the keys is intense, these birds are\r\nsilent.\r\n\r\nTheir flesh was found to be excellent, and they were generally very\r\nfat. They fed on grass seeds, on the leaves of certain aromatic plants,\r\nand on various kinds of berries,—among others, one highly poisonous to\r\nman,—and mingle with their food particles of shells and gravel. They\r\nhave two broods in a season.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Audubon, their eggs measure 1.25 inches in length by\r\n.87 of an inch in breadth, and are abruptly pointed at one end. He\r\nstates that they propagated readily in the aviary of the Earl of Derby,\r\nsome being let loose in the hope of introducing them into England.\r\n\r\nThis species, known in Jamaica as the Pea Dove, is not, according to\r\nMarch, gregarious, and, although terrestrial in habits, is often seen\r\nand heard on trees, and also roosts there. It nests indiscriminately on\r\nthe ground or in trees, making a slight platform of sticks and twigs,\r\nloosely put together. The eggs are two, oval or roundish-oval in shape,\r\nand white. They measure from 1.20 to 1.32 inches in length by an inch in\r\nbreadth. It is a favorite cage-bird, and though apparently very timid\r\nand restless, becomes very tame and docile, and will take grain from the\r\nhand or lips of its feeder.\r\n\r\nIn Santa Cruz it is known as the Mountain Dove, and was there found\r\nvery common by Mr. Newton. It afforded excellent sport and was very\r\ngood eating. It was not only numerous on the hills, but was likewise\r\nplentiful in all parts of the island sufficiently overgrown with brush.\r\nMr. Newton did not find it so terrestrial in its habits as it is stated\r\nto be by some writers. Its flight is said to be remarkably rapid. It\r\nbreeds from April to the end of July, and is said to build the ordinary\r\nPigeon’s nest,—a mere platform of twigs in a bush or tree at any height\r\nfrom a few feet to twenty. It lays two eggs, which, in Santa Cruz, were\r\nfound by Mr. Newton to be perfectly white, and not of a drab hue, as\r\nstated by Mr. Gosse. The young birds are often taken from the nest and\r\nbrought up without much difficulty. The cooing of this Dove is stated to\r\nmuch resemble the noise made by sounding a conch-shell.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of the Zenaida Dove are more rounded in their shape than those\r\nof most of our Pigeons, are white, equally obtuse at each end, and\r\nmeasure 1.30 inches in length by .90 in breadth.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS ZENAIDURA, BONAP.\r\n\r\n  _Zenaidura_, BONAP.

At present three species\r\nare known, two of them recently described. Unless _Z. yucatanensis_\r\nproves to be a hybrid between _Zenaida amabilis_ and _Zenaidura\r\ncarolinensis_, it may be expedient to merge _Zenaida_ and _Zenaidura_\r\ninto one, since, if _yucatanensis_ prove to be a permanent form, the\r\nadditional pair of tail-feathers is all that is left to characterize\r\n_Zenaidura_; and when we consider that the wedge-tailed _Haliætus\r\npelagicus_ has fourteen tail-feathers, while the round-tailed species\r\nhave only twelve, it seems reasonable to consider the difference as\r\nmerely specific in this case also.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =1180= ♂ ⅔ ⅔\r\n\r\n_Zenaidura carolinensis._]\r\n\r\n  =A.= Secondaries broadly tipped with white.\r\n\r\n    =Z. yucatanensis.=[107] Beneath entirely deep purplish-vinaceous.\r\n    Wing, 6.00; tail, 4.90; culmen, .58; tarsus, .85; middle toe, .90.\r\n    _Hab._ Yucatan.\r\n\r\n  =B.= Secondaries not tipped with white.\r\n\r\n    =Z. carolinensis.= Beneath light purplish-vinaceous anteriorly;\r\n    crissum nearly white.

Tail-feathers seen from below\r\nblackish, the outer web of outermost white, the others tipped with the\r\nsame, the color becoming more and more bluish to the innermost, which is\r\nbrown. Seen from above there is the same gradation from white to light\r\nblue in the tips; the rest of the feather, however, is blue, with a bar\r\nof black anterior to the light tip, which runs a little forward along\r\nthe margin and shaft of the feather. In the sixth feather the color\r\nis uniform bluish, with this bar; the seventh is without a bar. Bill\r\nblack, the angle of the mouth carmine. Female smaller, and with less red\r\nbeneath. Length of male, 12.85; wing, 5.75; tail, 6.70. Bare orbits pale\r\nblue, with a green tint; iris dark brown; feet lake-red. _Young_ with\r\nthe feathers of upper parts and jugulum margined with paler; the tints\r\nmore brownish.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Zenaidura carolinensis._]\r\n\r\nHAB. Throughout United States from Atlantic to Pacific. Cuba; Middle\r\nAmerica to Panama. Localities: Oaxaca (SCL. 1859, 391); Cordova (1856,\r\n359); Guatemala (Ibis, I, 222); Cuba (CAB. J.

IX, 139); Yucatan (IX, 207).\r\n\r\nSpecimens from the whole of North America, south to Costa Rica and the\r\nWest India Islands, are identical in colors and proportions.\r\n\r\nSpecimens from Cuba, Jamaica, and other West India Islands, resemble\r\nexamples from the eastern United States, but are considerably smaller,\r\nthe wing measuring less than 5.50 inches. The dark blotches on the wings\r\nappear of unusual size, the rufous tinge on the back is more decided,\r\nand the under parts are more deeply colored. In these respects they\r\nresemble somewhat skins from Cape St. Lucas, collected by Mr. Xantus.\r\n\r\nHABITS. The Carolina Dove is found throughout the United States, in\r\nnearly all parts, from the Gulf of Mexico to Canada, and from the\r\nAtlantic coast to the Pacific. It occurs also in the West Indies, in\r\nMexico, and in Central America. It is found in the southern part of\r\nMaine as far to the eastward as Calais, but was not collected by Mr.\r\nVerrill at Norway, and is not known to occur in the northern part of\r\nthat State. Farther west, it is met with to the Canada line; a few\r\nbeing known to breed near Hamilton, and others to pass the winter near\r\nSalt Springs, according to Mr. McIlwraith. They occur with more or\r\nless abundance in different parts of Massachusetts, but are generally\r\nquite rare except in one or two localities. In nearly all the rest\r\nof the United States they are widely and generally distributed, and\r\noften abundant. In some parts of the country they are cherished for\r\ntheir confiding trust in the protection of man; while in others they\r\nare hunted on account of their delicacy as food, and are very shy and\r\ndifficult of approach. In Carlisle, Penn., I found them one of the\r\nmost common birds, frequenting the gardens and orchards, and breeding\r\noften in close proximity to the houses. In Western Massachusetts, on\r\nthe other hand, where they were once quite abundant, they have been so\r\npersistently hunted that they are very shy, and have become quite rare.\r\n\r\nIn Kansas and in Colorado they were frequently found by Mr. Allen, and\r\nin the latter region also by Messrs. Aiken and Holden. On the Plains,\r\nin the absence of any trees in which to build, they were in the habit\r\nof constructing their nests on the ground, in some instances depositing\r\ntheir eggs in a mere depression in the sand, with hardly any pretence\r\nfor a nest.\r\n\r\nThis bird was obtained in Tamaulipas, Mexico, by Lieutenant Couch; at\r\nRinggold Barracks, Texas, by Mr. J. H. Clark; near San Elizario, by\r\nDr. Kennerly; and on the Colorado, by Mr. Schott. Mr. Clark found the\r\nvicinity of Ringgold Barracks a great resort for many birds of this\r\nfamily for the purpose of nesting; the luxuriant development of the\r\n_Opuntia_, and other vegetation equally impassable, affording the means\r\nof defence. Hundreds of at least half a dozen species were to be seen\r\nevery evening on the banks of the river after water. Lieutenant Couch\r\nfound it in great numbers from the Rio Grande to beyond the Sierra\r\nMadre, generally near the ranches, though often in the forests. It\r\nseemed inclined to court the society of man for protection and food. It\r\nwas also very abundant, according to Dr. Kennerly, in the vicinity of\r\nSan Elizario, banding in large flocks, and feeding in the wheat and corn\r\nfields. It was also observed as far west as Santa Cruz, in Sonora.\r\n\r\nDr. Newberry met with this Dove in all parts of California and Oregon\r\nvisited by him. Dr. Suckley mentions it as very abundant throughout\r\nWashington Territory and Oregon. At Fort Steilacoom it arrives and\r\ndeparts at about the same time as the _Columba fasciata_. Dr. Cooper\r\nstates it to be common about prairies and farms of the interior, and\r\nprobably some remain all winter in the Territory, though they rarely\r\nappear at any time near the coast border.\r\n\r\nDr. Kennerly found this species about Bill Williams Fork, in New Mexico,\r\nand also in the vicinity of San Antonio, Texas, and along the Gulf\r\ncoast; but travelling west about two hundred miles from the former\r\nplace, they seemed suddenly to disappear.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Salvin, this Dove was very abundant about Dueñas,\r\ninhabiting only the open districts. It congregated in flocks, and was\r\nresident. Mr. G. C. Taylor frequently met with it in Honduras, where\r\nthey were generally seen in small flocks of from six to ten.\r\n\r\nDr. Woodhouse mentions that the mournful notes of these birds were to be\r\nheard continually throughout the Indian Territory and the greater part\r\nof Texas and New Mexico, in all of which countries it breeds.\r\n\r\nMr. Dresser found this Dove a familiar resident in every part of Texas\r\nand Mexico that he visited. He saw many of their nests, all slightly\r\nbuilt of sticks placed on the branch of a mesquite tree or bush,\r\ncontaining two pure-white eggs. In two instances the nests were on the\r\nground. He met with one nest with fresh eggs as late as September 7.\r\n\r\nThese birds are migratory in the Northern States, and partially so\r\nin the Middle States, their movements being irregular, and evidently\r\ndependent upon the abundance of their food. In North and South Carolina,\r\nand in other parts of the country south of Pennsylvania, they collect\r\ntogether in the winter months in considerable numbers. Wilson states\r\nthat on the 2d of February he saw a flock of many hundreds of these\r\nbirds near Newbern, N. C.; and near the Savannah River, in Georgia, the\r\nwoods were swarming with them. They return to the North in March or\r\nearly in April, and disperse very generally over the country in pairs,\r\nrarely more than two or three of these being seen together. They are\r\nthen occasionally to be seen in roads, dusting themselves or procuring\r\ngravel. Where not molested, they often visit the farm-yards, and even\r\noccasionally feed with the poultry, take water from the drinking-places\r\nof the cattle, and become partially domesticated.\r\n\r\nWhen their breeding-season is over, usually early in August, they again\r\ncollect in small flocks, which unite in larger collections when they\r\nmove southward in their migrations.\r\n\r\nTheir flight is rapid, vigorous, and strong, and the flapping of their\r\nwings is accompanied by a peculiar whistling sound. They can fly with\r\ngreat swiftness, can readily alight on trees, and move with facility\r\namong the branches.\r\n\r\nTheir love-notes, which commence in the early spring, are celebrated\r\nfor their peculiarly sad and touching plaintiveness of sound, though\r\nthe birds themselves exhibit in their appearance and manners at this\r\ntime anything but an appearance of grief or mourning, being exceedingly\r\nlively and sportive in their endearments. These notes are repeated\r\nalmost continually, in a succession of four or five notes sounding like\r\n_ah-coo-roo-coo_ or _ah-cōō-rōō-cōō-rōō_.\r\n\r\nThis Pigeon feeds on seeds, grain, buckwheat, Indian corn, the berries\r\nof various shrubs and plants, and the smaller acorns of the live-oak and\r\nother oaks. They are also accused of visiting the gardens and consuming\r\npeas. They swallow great quantities of gravel.\r\n\r\nIn Pennsylvania they are said to nest as early as the first of May. They\r\nprobably have more than one brood in a season, as the nests found at\r\nCarlisle about the middle of June were found to contain perfectly fresh\r\neggs. Their nest is a rudely constructed fabric of small twigs laid\r\ntogether in an inartistic manner, and lined with a few finer stems and\r\nrootlets, and is placed on the horizontal branch of a tree, in a vine\r\nor evergreen, or even on the ground. The last was the general position\r\nof their nests on the Plains, and occasionally is noticed at the East.\r\nWilson found nests thus placed in Pennsylvania and elsewhere.\r\n\r\nDr. Coues mentions this bird as an abundant summer resident in Arizona,\r\nwhere it arrives the last week in April and remains into October. The\r\npresence of this bird on the dry sandy wastes of that Territory always\r\nproved a sure indication of the presence of water, the nature of its\r\nfood, consisting ordinarily of dry hard seeds, rendering an abundant\r\nsupply of water necessary to its existence.\r\n\r\nMr. Audubon states that these birds breed in Louisiana in April, and\r\nsometimes as early as March, and have there two broods. They roost at\r\nnight on the ground, among the long grasses found growing in abandoned\r\nfields; and occasionally they resort to the dead foliage of trees, and\r\nto various kinds of evergreens. Their flesh is said to be remarkably\r\nfine, tender and juicy, especially when the birds are fat, and by some\r\nis regarded as superior to that of either the Snipe or the Woodcock.\r\n\r\nThis Dove can easily be induced to breed in aviaries, even though caught\r\nwhen old, and will have several broods in a season.\r\n\r\nIn Southern Illinois they have been observed by Mr. Ridgway to breed in\r\nvarious situations, either on the ground in grain-fields, on the tops of\r\nstumps, or the top of a rail fence, as well as in trees and bushes. They\r\nnest from the beginning of April to the middle of September. They were\r\nalso remarkably abundant along the line of the 40th parallel, according\r\nto Mr. Ridgway, even in the most desert tracts.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of this species measure 1.15 inches in length by .86 in\r\nbreadth; they are of an oblong-oval shape, white in color, and nearly\r\nequal at either extremity.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS SCARDAFELLA, BONAP.\r\n\r\n  _Scardafella_, BON.

Our information in regard to the distribution and habits of this\r\nspecies is quite incomplete. It was met with near Cadereita, in the\r\nState of New Leon, Mexico, by Lieutenant Couch, who procured a specimen\r\nApril 18, 1853.\r\n\r\nIt was also found in flocks in company with _Chamæpelia rufipennis_,\r\nnear San Pedro and Peten, Honduras, by Leyland. Mr. Salvin met with\r\nonly a single specimen at Dueñas. On the coast it was more numerous,\r\nresembling in its habits the common species of the district, _Chamæpelia\r\npasserina_.\r\n\r\nThe “Long-tailed Ground Dove” is said by Mr. G. C. Taylor to be very\r\ncommon in Honduras, where it is generally seen in pairs. They were\r\nfound to be very good eating, but too small to repay their cost where\r\nammunition was so scarce.\r\n\r\nIt was found breeding near Laredo, Texas, by Dr. H. B. Butcher, July 1,\r\n1866. The nest (S. I. 12,896) is said to have been built in the fork\r\nof a small mesquite-tree, and to have contained two eggs. The eggs are\r\nsimilar to those of the _Chamæpelia passerina_, white, of an oval shape,\r\nnearly equally obtuse at either end.\r\n\r\nMr. Xantus found this Dove breeding abundantly at Cape St. Lucas. The\r\nmaximum number of eggs was invariably two. One nest was found in a\r\nleafless acacia about six feet from the ground; another, found May 26,\r\nwas about five feet high, in a small thorn-bush; a third was at the\r\nheight of eight feet, and also placed in a bush; others were placed in\r\nsmall oaks, in cacti, in opuntia, and other situations, all above the\r\nground at heights varying from five to eight feet.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of this Dove are of a white color, are oval in their shape, of\r\nabout equal size at either end, and measure .91 of an inch in length by\r\n.70 in breadth.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS CHAMÆPELIA, SWAINSON.\r\n\r\n  _Chamæpelia_, SWAINSON, Zool.

Southern and Lower California; whole of Middle America, to\r\nNew Granada and Venezuela; West Indies.\r\n\r\nSpecimens vary considerably in the depth of the vinaceous tints, but the\r\nvariation is nearly as much with the individual as with the locality.\r\nAs a rule, Florida and West India skins are most deeply colored, those\r\nfrom Mexico (particularly from Cape St. Lucas and Orizaba) being much\r\npaler in all the tints (var. _pallescens_, Baird); but specimens from\r\nGuatemala and Costa Rica are undistinguishable from the average of the\r\nFlorida series. Specimens from New Granada (labelled _C. granatina_,\r\nBonap.), Venezuela (labelled _C. albivitta_), and the Amazons, are more\r\nlike Cape St. Lucas specimens, differing from them only in slightly\r\nsmaller size, the colors being the same in the minutest particulars,\r\nexcept that the crissum is perhaps more whitish, the dusky centres of\r\nthe feathers being more concealed. These generalizations are based on\r\nfifty-six specimens in the Smithsonian Museum.\r\n\r\nHABITS. According to Mr. Audubon, this Dove is found from the lower\r\nparts of Louisiana to Cape Hatteras, following the coast quite round\r\nFlorida, but is seen very seldom to any distance in the interior. He met\r\nwith none in the State of Mississippi. They were more abundant among\r\nthe sea-islands of Georgia and the middle portions of the coast of East\r\nFlorida than anywhere else.\r\n\r\nThis bird has also been taken at Monterey, California, by W. Hutton, and\r\na single accidental specimen has been obtained near Washington, D. C.\r\n\r\nSpecimens were obtained near Matamoras, in Tamaulipas, by Dr.\r\nBerlandier, and subsequently by Lieutenant Couch, who generally found\r\nthem in the forests or open fields at a distance from dwellings. They\r\nwere observed to fly low, and only for short distances, and to spend\r\nmost of their time on the ground.\r\n\r\nIn Jamaica, according to Mr. March, the Ground Dove sometimes perches,\r\nand always roosts, on low trees; but is otherwise generally found in\r\npairs, feeding on the ground on small grain and seeds. Several pairs\r\nmay be seen feeding together, but they do not associate. It is said\r\nto be very tame, and to be found about homesteads and in streets and\r\nroads. It also breeds in low trees, the cashew and the dogwood seeming\r\nto be preferred. It is very rarely kept as a cage-bird, as its note\r\nis a plaintive mournful coo, and there is a Creole superstition that\r\nmisfortune will happen to any one so treating it. The nest is slightly\r\nmade of twigs, lined with grass, and built in a fork or hollow. The eggs\r\nare two, of a rounded oval, white, .87 of an inch by .69.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. Salvin, this Dove is one of the most familiar birds of\r\nthe central region of Guatemala, where it is the only small Ground Dove\r\nfound. In the coast region its place was supplied by at least two other\r\nspecies. It is abundant at Dueñas, residing all the year, and breeding\r\nin the cochineal plantations, where it deposits its eggs, two in number,\r\non the ground under the rows of “nopal.” It is called Tortolita by the\r\ninhabitants. He found its nests both on the ground and elevated a few\r\nfeet above it.\r\n\r\nMr. Dresser found these birds common near Matamoras, and generally\r\nnoticed them on the road between Matamoras and Brownsville, as well as\r\non a sand-plain close to Fort Brown, on the Texan side of the river. In\r\nthe interior of Texas he did not meet with any, except once, in April,\r\non the Medina near San Antonio.\r\n\r\nMr. Audubon describes the flight of this Dove as low, easy, and\r\naccompanied by a whistling sound, produced by the action of the wings\r\nwhen the bird is surprised and forced to fly. it is less protracted\r\nthan that of most other species, and seldom extends more than a hundred\r\nyards at a time. It seems much attached to its chosen locality, and\r\nalmost immediately returns to it after having been driven away. While\r\nit alights on trees and moves with ease among the branches, and mostly\r\nnests in low trees or bushes, the ground is its usual place of resort,\r\nwhere it runs with facility, and in moving always keeps its tail\r\nconsiderably elevated. It appeared to be fond of alighting on fences,\r\nwhere it can be heard cooing for half an hour at a time.\r\n\r\nThese Pigeons are met with in groups of four or five, and seldom more\r\nthan ten or twelve are seen together. They appear to prefer the thinly\r\ngrassed sandy portions of cotton-fields, pea-patches, and similar\r\nplaces. In East Florida they may even be seen in the villages, resorting\r\nto the orange-groves and breeding in them. At St. Augustine they are\r\noften found within the inner court of the old Spanish fort, rising\r\nalmost perpendicularly in order to escape above the parapets. They are\r\neasily caught, and readily become domesticated. A pair taken when their\r\nyoung were quite small, and placed in an aviary, continued to nourish\r\nthem until full-grown, and afterwards raised a second brood from the\r\nsame nest. They were fed on rice and other small grain.\r\n\r\nThe nest of this species is described as compact, and as large for the\r\nsize of the bird. It is composed of dry twigs externally, and within is\r\nmade of dry grasses disposed in a circular form. This is usually built\r\nin hedges or low bushes, and among the branches of orange-trees. The\r\neggs are two, pure white, and with one end usually much more obtuse\r\nthan the other. They are two in number, but, as Mr. Audubon states,\r\noccasionally the nest contains three. Two broods are raised in a season.\r\n\r\nIn the vicinity of Charleston these birds were observed to remain\r\nall the year, though the greater proportion retired south or to the\r\nsea-islands.\r\n\r\nIn the Florida Keys Mr. Audubon met with them among the islands resorted\r\nto by the Zenaida Doves, and also on Sandy Island, near Cape Sable. In\r\nthe latter place they were so gentle that he approached to within two\r\nyards of them. Their nest was on the top of a cactus, not more than two\r\nfeet from the ground.\r\n\r\nTheir food, in a wild state, consists of grass-seeds and various small\r\nberries, with which they swallow a large proportion of gravel to assist\r\ndigestion. They are extremely fond of dusting themselves in the sand,\r\nlying down in it in the manner of various gallinaceous birds.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of this species are of a uniform bright white color, are\r\nslightly more pointed at one end than at the other, and measure .85 of\r\nan inch in length by .63 in breadth.\r\n\r\nThis species was found in abundance at Cape St. Lucas by Mr. Xantus.\r\nThey were nesting from April 15 until August 29, and evidently had two\r\nor more broods in a season. Their nests were usually placed in low\r\ncactuses, near the ground, or in small shrubs. Their nests, eggs, and\r\ngeneral habits, so far as we can gather them from the meagre notes of\r\nMr. Xantus, are in no wise different from those of the more eastern\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\n[Plate: PLATE LVIII.\r\n\r\n  1.

The Key West Pigeon is found within the fauna of the United\r\nStates only in the extreme southern portion of Florida, and, so far\r\nas known, only on the island of Key West, where Mr. Audubon met with\r\nthem, and enjoyed a limited opportunity of observing their habits. He\r\ndescribes the flight as low, swift, and protracted, as he saw them\r\npassing from Cuba to Key West. They moved in loose flocks of from\r\nfive or six to a dozen, and so very low as to almost seem to touch\r\nthe surface. They were fond of going out early in the morning from\r\ntheir thickets to cleanse their plumage in the shelly sand, but on\r\nthe least approach of danger would fly back to the thickest part of\r\nthe woods, throw themselves on the ground, and run off with great\r\nrapidity. Their movements of the tail and neck are similar to those\r\nof the Carolina Dove. Their coo is said to be neither so soft nor so\r\nprolonged as that of the common Dove, and may be represented by the\r\nsyllable _whoe-whoe-oh-oh-oh_. When suddenly approached, they utter a\r\nguttural gasping sound. They are said to alight on the lower branches of\r\nshrubby trees, and to delight in the neighborhood of shady ponds, always\r\ninhabiting by preference the darkest solitudes. Whatever may have been\r\ntheir abundance on Key West, in Mr. Audubon’s time, it is certain that\r\nthey are very rare there now, as I am not aware of their having been\r\ntaken of late years by any of the numerous collectors who have visited\r\nSouth Florida since Mr. Audubon’s time.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Oreopeleia martinica._]\r\n\r\nThe nest is described as formed of light dry twigs, in shape much\r\nresembling that of the Carolina Dove. Occasionally it is placed on the\r\nground, and is then less elaborate. Some are placed on large branches\r\nnear the ground, while others are built among slender twigs.\r\n\r\nTowards the middle of July, according to Mr. Audubon, they become so\r\nabundant that sportsmen are able to shoot a score or more in a day. They\r\nfeed on berries and the seeds of various plants, and are especially fond\r\nof the fruit of the sea-grape.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS STARNŒNAS, BONAPARTE.\r\n\r\n  _Starnœnas_, BONAPARTE, Geog. & Comp.

This handsome Pigeon belongs to the fauna of the West India\r\nIslands, and is only an occasional visitant of Key West and other\r\nsouthern keys of Florida. They are a common species in Cuba, from\r\nwhich island a few are stated by Mr. Audubon to migrate each year to\r\ncertain of the keys of Florida, where, however, they are rarely seen on\r\naccount of their living only in the most tangled thickets. Mr. Audubon\r\nsaw a pair on the western side of Key West. They were near the water\r\npicking gravel, but they would not suffer a near approach. He saw a\r\npair, also, that had been taken, when young, on “Mule Keys.” These fed\r\nwell on cracked corn and rice, but he was unable to obtain any further\r\ninformation in respect to them.\r\n\r\nThough abundant in Cuba this species does not appear to have been found\r\nin Jamaica, except as an imported bird from the former island, contrary\r\nto the assertions of various writers, as Temminck, Brisson, and others.\r\nMr. Gosse was not able to trace its presence, though its existence among\r\nthe precipitous woods on the north side of that island he regards as\r\nquite possible.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Starnœnas cyanocephala._]\r\n\r\nLike _Oreopeleia martinica_ and _Zenaida amabilis_, this species, though\r\ndescribed by Audubon as not being rare on the keys of South Florida, has\r\nnot been met with in that State by later explorers.\r\n\r\nAn egg of this species laid in confinement in the aviary of Dr. Bachman,\r\nin Charleston, S. C., is of a rounded-oval shape, and of a uniform\r\ncreamy-white color; it measures 1.43 inches in length by 1.10 in\r\nbreadth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY CRACIDÆ.—THE CURASSOWS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAR. Body large, but rather slender; bill more or less arched; tail\r\nlengthened; legs long, robust, without any spur. Toes moderate, slender,\r\nthe hinder scarcely elevated. Naked spaces frequently occurring on the\r\nhead and throat.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Sclater and Salvin, in their masterly and model monograph\r\nof _Cracidæ_ (Pr. Zoöl. Soc. 1870, 504), define the subfamilies as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n  =A.= Post-acetabular area narrow; upper mandible higher than broad;\r\n  culmen compressed …\r\n\r\n                                                           I. _Cracinæ._\r\n\r\n  =B.= Post-acetabular area broad; upper mandible broader than high;\r\n  culmen depressed.\r\n\r\n    Top of head covered with feathers; space between the nostrils naked;\r\n    nostrils exposed …\r\n\r\n                                                       II. _Penelopinæ._\r\n\r\n    Top of head with a bony tubercle; internasal space densely\r\n    feathered; nostrils concealed …\r\n\r\n                                                     III. _Oreophasinæ._\r\n\r\nBy the term “post-acetabular area” is understood that portion of the\r\ndorsal aspect of the pelvis which is bounded in front by a line drawn\r\nthrough the acetabula.\r\n\r\nThe _Cracinæ_, or Curassows, are found in Mexico, in Central and in\r\nSouth America; the _Oreophasinæ_ are represented by a single species,\r\n_Oreophasis derbianus_, a bird nearly as large as a Turkey, occurring in\r\nthe wooded region of the Volcan de Fuego, Guatemala, at an altitude of\r\n10,000 feet. Of the _Penelopinæ_ one species only is found in the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBFAMILY PENELOPINÆ.\r\n\r\nThis is the most extensive section of _Cracidæ_, embracing, according\r\nto Sclater and Salvin, no less than thirty-nine species.

Valley of the Rio Grande, and southward to Guatemala.\r\n\r\nThis form is distinguishable from _O. vetula_, as restricted, of which\r\nit is the northern representative, by the paler and less fulvous colors,\r\nand lighter—often nearly white—tips to the tail-feathers, besides\r\nother minor differences in coloration. The two cannot be separated\r\nspecifically, however, since they undoubtedly grade into each other.\r\n\r\nHABITS. This very remarkable bird, belonging as it does to a form\r\npeculiar to this continent, is the only species found within the limits\r\nof the United States, and only within a quite restricted area in the\r\nvalley of the Rio Grande. Numerous species of this family are found in\r\nthe warmer countries of America, especially Mexico and Central America,\r\nall or nearly all of which appear to be capable of domestication,\r\nand some of which, including the present species, have, in repeated\r\ninstances, been quite as completely domesticated as our common Turkey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Ortalida maccalli._]\r\n\r\nBirds of the family to which the Texan species belongs differ in a\r\nvery marked manner, in habits, from most _Gallinaceæ_, inasmuch as\r\nthey not only live almost exclusively in deep forests, but are also\r\nremarkable for habitually frequenting trees, feeding upon their foliage,\r\nand building their nests within their branches, more in the manner of\r\nthe smaller birds. They are all said to have loud and discordant voices,\r\nand are generally of a black or dark plumage.\r\n\r\nSpecimens of this bird were taken at Boquillo, in New Leon, in the\r\nspring of 1853, by Lieutenant Couch, who speaks of them as gregarious\r\nand as seeking their food wholly or in part on trees. According to Mr.\r\nClark, they do not occur higher up the Rio Grande than the vicinity\r\nof Ringgold Barracks, inhabiting the deepest chaparrals, which they\r\nnever quit. They are inactive, and for the most of the time sit about\r\nin flocks in these thickets, feeding on leaves. The Mexican name of\r\n_Chacalacca_ is supposed to be derived from the noise with which at\r\ntimes they make the valleys ring, and which may be well imitated in\r\nkind, but not in strength, by putting the most stress upon the last two\r\nsyllables. No sooner does one take up the song than others chime in\r\nfrom all quarters, till, apparently exhausted, the noise gradually dies\r\noff into an interlude, only to be again renewed. These concerts take\r\nplace in the morning and evening. The birds are quite gentle, are easily\r\ntamed, and are said to cross with the common domestic fowl.\r\n\r\nMr. Dresser states that the Chacalacca is very common near Matamoras\r\nand Brownsville, and that in the autumn great numbers are exposed for\r\nsale in the market of the latter place. The Mexicans are said to hold\r\nit in high esteem for its fighting qualities, and often keep it in a\r\ndomesticated state and cross it with the common fowl, making use of the\r\nhybrid for cock-fighting. Mr. Dresser was so informed by many Mexicans,\r\nupon whose word he placed reliance, and was an eyewitness of a fight in\r\nwhich one of these hybrids was engaged. Mr. Dresser had a tame one, when\r\nat Matamoras, that became so familiar that he could hardly keep it out\r\nof his room. This bird would occasionally go away for a day or two, and\r\npay a visit to the poultry belonging to a neighbor; whenever he missed\r\nit, he had only to go to a poultry-yard near the house, where it could\r\ngenerally be found.\r\n\r\nThis species was first taken within the United States by Colonel McCall,\r\nwho obtained it in Texas, and who enjoyed and improved unusually good\r\nopportunities to observe the habits and manners of this bird. From his\r\nnotes, quoted by Mr. Cassin, we give the following:—\r\n\r\n“This very gallant-looking and spirited bird I saw for the first time\r\nwithin our territory in the extensive forests of chaparral which envelop\r\nthe Resaca de la Palma. Here, and for miles along the Lower Rio Grande,\r\nit was abundant; and throughout this region the remarkable and sonorous\r\ncry of the male bird could not fail to attract and fix the attention\r\nof the most obtuse or listless wanderer who might chance to approach\r\nits abode. By the Mexicans it is called _Chiac-chia-lacca_, an Indian\r\nname, without doubt derived from the peculiar cry of the bird, which\r\nstrikingly resembles a repetition of these syllables. And when I assure\r\nyou that its voice, in compass, is equal to that of the Guinea-fowl,\r\nand in harshness but little inferior, you may form some idea of the\r\nchorus with which the forest is made to ring at the hour of sunrise. At\r\nthat hour, in the month of April, I have observed a proud and stately\r\nfellow descend from the tree on which he had roosted, and, mounting\r\nupon an old log or stump, commence his clear, shrill cry. This was soon\r\nresponded to in a lower tone by the female, the latter always taking\r\nup the strain as soon as the importunate call of her mate had ceased.\r\nThus alternating, one pair after another would join in the matutinal\r\nchorus, and, before the rising sun had lighted up their close retreat,\r\nthe woods would ring with the din of a hundred voices, as the happy\r\ncouples met after the period of separation and repose. When at length\r\nall this clatter had terminated, the parties quietly betook themselves\r\nto their morning meal. If surprised while thus employed, they would fly\r\ninto the trees above, and, peering down with stretched necks, and heads\r\nturned sideways to the ground, they would challenge the intruder with a\r\nsingular and oft-repeated croaking note, of which it would be difficult\r\nto give any adequate idea with words alone.”\r\n\r\nColonel McCall adds that the volubility and singularity of its voice\r\nis its most striking and remarkable trait. While on his march from\r\nMatamoras to Tampico he had encamped, on the 30th of December, at the\r\nspring of Encinal, whence, a short time before sunset, he rode out\r\nin search of game. Passing through a woodland near the stream, his\r\nears were saluted with a strange sound that resembled somewhat the\r\ncry of the panther (_Felis onca_). He was at a loss to what animal to\r\nascribe it, and, dismounting, crawled cautiously through the thicket\r\nfor some distance, until he came upon an opening where there were some\r\nlarger trees, from the lower branches of one of which he ascertained\r\nthat the sound proceeded. There he discovered a large male bird of\r\nthis species, ascending towards the top of the tree, and uttering this\r\nhitherto unheard sound, as he sprang from branch to branch in mounting\r\nto his roost. In a few moments his call was answered from a distance,\r\nand soon after he was joined by a bird of the year. Others followed,\r\ncoming in from different quarters, and there were in a little while five\r\nor six upon the tree. One of these discovered the intruder and gave the\r\nalarm. The singular cry of the old bird ceased, and they all began to\r\nexhibit uneasiness and a disposition to fly, whereupon Colonel McCall\r\nshot the old bird.\r\n\r\nColonel McCall also states that the eye is a remarkable feature in the\r\nliving birds of this species, being full of courage and animation,\r\nequal, in fact, in brilliancy to that of the finest gamecock. He\r\nfrequently noticed this bird domesticated by the Mexicans at Matamoras,\r\nMonterey, etc., and going at large about their gardens. He was assured\r\nthat in that condition it not unfrequently crossed with the common fowl.\r\n\r\nIn the wild state the eggs are said to be from six to eight, never\r\nexceeding the last number. They are white, without spots, and rather\r\nsmaller than a pullet’s egg. The nest is usually on the ground, at the\r\nroot of a large tree or at the side of an old log, where a hole several\r\ninches deep is scratched in the ground; this is lined with leaves, and\r\nthe eggs are always carefully covered with the same when the female\r\nleaves them for the purpose of feeding. If disturbed while on her nest,\r\nshe flies at the intruder with great spirit and determination.\r\n\r\nEggs of this species, from Matamoras, are of an oblong-oval shape,\r\nequally pointed at either end, and measure 2.35 inches in length by 1.65\r\nin breadth. They are of a dirty-white color with a light tint of buff,\r\nand have a slightly roughened or granulated surface.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY MELEAGRIDÆ.—THE TURKEYS.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAR. Bill moderate; the nasal fossæ bare. Head and neck without\r\nfeathers, but with scattered hairs, and more or less carunculated. An\r\nextensible fleshy process on the forehead, but no development of the\r\nbone. Tarsus armed with spurs in the male. Hind toe elevated. Tail\r\nnearly as long as the wing, truncate, of more than twelve feathers.\r\n\r\nThe family _Meleagridæ_, or Turkeys, as at present known, is entirely\r\nconfined to North and Middle America, and represented only by the\r\ngenus _Meleagris_. It forms, in combination with the Guinea-fowls\r\n(_Numididæ_), the Pheasants and common fowls (_Phasianidæ_), and the\r\nGrouse and Partridges (_Tetraonidæ_), a peculiar group, to which\r\nthe name _Alecteropodes_ has been given by Professor Huxley; this\r\ngroup is well distinguished from the _Cracidæ_ and the _Megapodidæ_\r\n(which form together an opposed group, called _Peristeropodes_), in\r\naddition to the characters enumerated under the family names, by salient\r\ncharacters developed in the sternum. In the present family and its\r\nrelations, as all may recall from experience at the dinner-table, the\r\nsternum, or breast-bone, is divided into a long narrow keel (lophosteon)\r\nextending far backwards; while towards the front, from each side,\r\nand separated by a very deep notch from the median portion, a wing\r\n(pleurosteon) originates obliquely, and, soon splitting in two, extends\r\nalso far backwards; in front, two processes (called costal) project\r\nwell forwards. In the _Cracidæ_ and _Megapodidæ_, on the contrary,\r\nthe sternum is not so split, the keel and wing, as above, being more\r\ncontinuous and the notch comparatively shallow; the costal processes are\r\nalso comparatively small and obtuse.\r\n\r\nExternally the Turkeys have considerable resemblance to the Guinea-fowls\r\n(_Numididæ_), but they differ from them in having a backward process of\r\nthe second metacarpal bone, and in the form of the costal processes of\r\nthe sternum and of the acromial process of the scapular; while they are\r\ndistinguished from the Guinea-fowls and all others by the form of the\r\npelvis (the post-acetabular area is greater than the pre-acetabular,\r\nand is also longer than broad), and by the furcula (wish-bone), which\r\nis very weak and straight, with its point (hypocleidium) straight and\r\nrod-like. To Professor Huxley we are indebted for having first pointed\r\nout most of these characters.\r\n\r\nAlthough the number of known species of _Meleagridæ_ as we understand\r\nthem, is limited to two now living, the family was apparently well\r\nrepresented in former geological periods, no less than three having\r\nbeen already described from more or less perfect remains; of these,\r\ntwo have been found in the post-pleiocene of New Jersey, one of which\r\n(_Meleagris altus_, Marsh, or _M. superbus_, Cope) was taller than the\r\ncommon Turkey, while the other (_Meleagris celer_, Marsh) was much\r\nsmaller. The third species (_Meleagris antiquus_, Marsh) lived at a\r\nstill earlier date, its remains having been obtained in the miocene beds\r\nof Colorado.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS MELEAGRIS, LINNÆUS.\r\n\r\n  _Meleagris_, LINNÆUS, Syst.

The feathers of the neck and body\r\ngenerally are very broad, abruptly truncate, and each one well defined\r\nand scale-like; the exposed portion coppery-bronze, with a bright\r\ncoppery reflection in some lights, in the specimens before us chiefly on\r\nthe under parts. Each feather is abruptly margined with velvet-black,\r\nthe bronze assuming a greenish or purplish shade near the line of\r\njunction, and the bronze itself sometimes with a greenish reflection in\r\nsome lights. The black is opaque, except along the extreme tip, where\r\nthere is a metallic gloss. The feathers of the lower back and rump are\r\nblack, with little or no copper gloss. The feathers of the sides behind,\r\nand the coverts, upper and under, are of a very dark purplish-chestnut,\r\nwith purplish-metallic reflections near the end, and a subterminal bar\r\nof black; the tips are of the opaque purplish-chestnut referred to. The\r\nconcealed portion of the coverts is dark chestnut barred rather finely\r\nwith black; the black wider than the interspaces. The tail-feathers\r\nare dark brownish-chestnut, with numerous transverse bars of black,\r\nwhich, when most distinct, are about a quarter of an inch wide and\r\nabout double their interspaces; the extreme tip for about half an inch\r\nis plain chestnut, lighter than the ground-color; and there is a broad\r\nsubterminal bar of black about two inches wide on the outer feathers,\r\nand narrowing to about three quarters of an inch to the central ones.\r\nThe innermost pair scarcely shows this band, and the others are all much\r\nbroken and confused. In addition to the black bars on each feather,\r\nthe chestnut interspaces are sprinkled with black. The black bands are\r\nall most distinct on the inner webs; the interspaces are considerably\r\nlighter below than above.\r\n\r\nThere are no whitish tips whatever to the tail or its coverts. The\r\nfeathers on the middle of the belly are downy, opaque, and tipped\r\nobscurely with rusty whitish.\r\n\r\nThe wing-coverts are like the back; the quills, however, are\r\nblackish-brown, with numerous transverse bars of white, half the width\r\nof the interspaces. The exposed surfaces of the wing, however, and most\r\nof the inner secondaries, are tinged with brownish-rusty, the uppermost\r\nones with a dull copper or greenish gloss.\r\n\r\nThe female differs in smaller size, less brilliant colors, absence\r\ngenerally of bristles on the breast and of spur, and a much smaller\r\nfleshy process above the base of the bill.\r\n\r\n_Male._ Length, 48.00 to 50.00; extent, 60.00; wing, 21.00; tail, 18.50.\r\nWeight, 16 to 35 lbs. _Female._ Weight about 12 lbs.; measurements\r\nsmaller in proportion.\r\n\r\nHAB.

West along the\r\ntimbered river-valleys towards the Rocky Mountains; south to the Gulf\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nThere is some question as to the names to be applied to the two races of\r\nNorthern _Meleagris_, and especially as to which is entitled to bear the\r\nname of _gallopavo_. The original description of _M. gallopavo_ quotes\r\nthe New England Turkey as described by Ray, but as far as the characters\r\ngiven go refers rather to the domestic form, which is equivalent to _M.\r\nmexicana_ of Gould. In this state of the case we therefore think it as\r\nwell to use _gallopavo_ for the eastern race, although the arguments of\r\nMajor Leconte and others in favor of applying it to the wild Mexican,\r\nand its derivative the domestic variety, are not without much weight.\r\n\r\nHABITS. The Wild Turkey is found throughout eastern North America, from\r\nSouth Carolina northward, and from the Atlantic to Texas and Arkansas.\r\nIt has probably become an extinct species in New England, though within\r\na few years individuals have been shot in Montague, Mass., and in other\r\ntowns in Franklin County. The construction of railroads, however,\r\nand the settlement of the country, have probably led to their final\r\nextermination; at least, I have known of none being taken within the\r\nlimits of Massachusetts for several years.\r\n\r\nIn the unsettled portions of the Southern and Western States, and in\r\nthe country watered by the Mississippi and the Missouri Rivers and\r\ntheir affluents, these birds are comparatively plentiful, though the\r\nquestion of their final extinction is probably only one of time, and\r\nthat not very distant. In Audubon’s day they were to be found along the\r\nwhole line of the Alleghanies, where they still occur, but have become\r\nvery wary and to be approached only with the greatest difficulty. In\r\nLouisiana and in Kentucky, Audubon found them most abundant, and in\r\nthese States he enjoyed the most favorable opportunities for observing\r\ntheir very remarkable habits in regions then comparatively undisturbed\r\nby the intrusion of civilized man. They are said to be not uncommon in\r\nVirginia, and are not unfrequently met with even in the vicinity of\r\nWashington.\r\n\r\nDr. Woodhouse found this species abundant throughout the wooded portions\r\nof the Indian Territory and Texas. While in the Creek country his party\r\nkilled numbers of them daily. Many of them were very large, and weighed\r\nupwards of nineteen pounds each, although at that time they were in poor\r\ncondition. They were quite abundant along the Rio San Pedro in Texas.\r\n\r\nMr. Dresser found the Wild Turkey common in all the portions of Texas\r\nand Mexico that he visited, and particularly so on the rivers between\r\nSan Antonio and the Rio Grande. His first Turkey hunt was on the Upper\r\nMedina River, about forty miles from San Antonio. It proved to be wary\r\nand difficult to approach in the daytime; but by watching to see where\r\nthey roosted, and visiting them by moonlight, one or two could generally\r\nbe secured. They generally preferred roosting in high cottonwood-trees,\r\non the banks of a stream, perching as high up as possible. He once saw\r\neleven Turkeys on one large bough of a cottonwood-tree on the Medina.\r\nWhen the pecan-nuts are ripe the Turkeys become very fat, as they are\r\nextremely fond of these nuts, which are very oily. One very plump bird\r\nwas found, after it had been dressed, to weigh sixteen pounds. Mr.\r\nDresser was informed by the hunters, that, for a nest, the Turkeys\r\nscratch a hole in the ground, or make a sort of nest in the grass under\r\na bush, and that the eggs resemble those of the tame Turkey, except in\r\nbeing smaller and more elongated in form. The Mexicans, on the Upper Rio\r\nGrande, sometimes domesticate the Wild Turkey, and at Piedras Negras Mr.\r\nDresser saw two that had been caught when quite young and had become\r\nvery tame. The female was then sitting, and the eggs, when examined,\r\nwere found to agree with the account given him by the hunters.\r\n\r\nMr. Audubon, in his very full and minute account of their habits, speaks\r\nof them as irregularly migratory and gregarious, their migrations having\r\nreference only to the abundance of food, and the meeting together in\r\nthe same localities being to a large degree caused by the same source\r\nof attraction,—the supply of mast in certain regions. In this way they\r\ndesert sections where the supply is exhausted, and advance towards those\r\nwhere it is more plentiful.\r\n\r\nLate in October these birds assemble in flocks in the rich bottom-lands\r\nof the Western rivers, the male birds associating in parties of from\r\nten to a hundred, and keeping apart from the females. The latter are\r\nsimultaneously moving into the same regions, but only in small family\r\ngroups, each leading its own flock, then nearly grown. Gradually they\r\nunite with other families, forming at length parties of seventy or\r\neighty. They are said to avoid very carefully the old males, who have\r\nthe very unparental disposition to destroy the young birds even when\r\nnearly grown. These migrations are made on foot except when they are\r\ncompelled to cross a stream. On their first coming to the banks of a\r\nriver they are said to make a pause there of one or two days before they\r\nattempt to cross, the old males strutting about up and down the banks,\r\nmaking a loud gobbling, and calling to one another as if to raise their\r\ncourage to a befitting point. Even the females and the young assume\r\nsomething of the same pompous demeanor, spreading out their tails,\r\nrunning round one another, and making a loud purring noise. At length,\r\nafter this prolonged preparation for the passage, they all mount to the\r\ntop of a high tree, and, at a signal given by their leader, take flight\r\nfor the opposite shore. Occasionally some fall into the water, when\r\nthese bring the wings close to the body, spread out the tail, and plying\r\ntheir legs with great vigor move rapidly towards the shore, where, by\r\na violent effort, they extricate themselves from the water. After thus\r\ncrossing a stream of any magnitude, they are often found in a bewildered\r\nstate, and fall an easy prey to the hunter.\r\n\r\nWhere their food occurs abundantly they separate into smaller flocks,\r\ncomposed of birds of all ages and sexes. At times they are known to\r\napproach farmhouses, associate with the domesticated fowl, and enter the\r\ncorn-cribs in quest of food, passing the fall and the winter in this\r\nmanner.\r\n\r\nEarly in February the love-season is said to commence, the first\r\ndemonstrations being made by the males, but for some time persistently\r\navoided by the females. At this period the sexes roost apart. When a\r\nfemale utters a call-note, the male birds within hearing return the\r\ncry, uttering notes similar to those with which the domestic Turkey\r\ngreets any very unusual sound. If the call-note has been uttered by a\r\nfemale on the ground, the males fly to the place, spreading and erecting\r\ntheir tails, drawing their heads back on their shoulders, depressing\r\ntheir wings with a quivering motion, and strutting pompously about. At\r\nthe same time they emit from their lungs a succession of very peculiar\r\npuffs. On these occasions the males often encounter each other, and\r\ndesperate contests ensue, which frequently have a fatal termination,\r\ncaused by furious blows inflicted on the head. When one Cock-Turkey\r\nhas thus destroyed its rival, it is said to caress the dead body in an\r\napparently affectionate manner.\r\n\r\nWhen the Turkeys have mated, the connection is supposed to last for that\r\nseason, though a male Turkey is often known to have more than a single\r\nmate; and the hens are said also to keep apart from the males while\r\nthey are laying their eggs, for the cock would inevitably destroy them.\r\nAt the end of the love-season the males become emaciated, and cease to\r\ngobble. They then separate entirely from the females, and keep apart by\r\nthemselves until they recover their strength, when they reunite in small\r\nflocks.\r\n\r\nThe female is said to begin to deposit her eggs about the middle of\r\nApril, selecting for that purpose a place as much concealed as possible\r\nfrom her many enemies. The nest, always on the ground, consists of a few\r\nwithered leaves in a hollow scratched out by the side of a fallen log,\r\nor the top of a prostrate tree, or under a thicket, or within the edge\r\nof a cane-brake, but always in a dry place. The eggs sometimes amount to\r\ntwenty in number, though there are usually from ten to fifteen. They are\r\ndescribed as of a dull cream-color, sprinkled with reddish dots. When\r\nthe female leaves her nest, she is said to be very careful to cover them\r\nwith leaves, so that it is always difficult for any one to find them.\r\nMr. Audubon observed that Turkey-hens not unfrequently selected small\r\nislands in which to deposit their eggs, apparently on account of the\r\ngreat masses of drift-timber which accumulated at their heads, in which\r\nthey could seek protection and shelter.\r\n\r\nIf a female is approached while sitting on her eggs, she rarely moves\r\nunless she is discovered. Mr. Audubon has frequently approached within\r\na few paces of a nest, the female remaining undisturbed. They seldom\r\nabandon their nest when it has been discovered by man, but forsake it\r\nif any of the eggs have been destroyed by any kind of animal. If the\r\neggs are taken or destroyed, the female prepares for another nest, but\r\notherwise has only one brood in a season. Audubon also states that he\r\nhas known several hens associate together, deposit their eggs in the\r\nsame nest, and rear their broods together, having once found three hens\r\nsitting on forty-two eggs in a single nest, one female at least being\r\nalways present to protect it. When the eggs are near hatching, the\r\nfemale will not leave her eggs under any circumstances, and will suffer\r\nherself to be made a prisoner rather than abandon them. The mother\r\nassists the young birds to extricate themselves from the egg-shell,\r\ncaresses and dries them with her bill, and aids them in their first\r\nefforts to totter out of the nest. As the brood follow her, she is very\r\nwatchful against Hawks or other enemies, spreads her wings a little to\r\nprotect them, and calls them close to her side, keeping them on dry\r\nground and carefully guarding them from wet, which is very injurious to\r\nthem when young. When two weeks old, they begin to be able to follow\r\ntheir mother, at night to roost in the low limb of some tree, and to\r\nleave the woods in the daytime in quest of berries and other food. The\r\nyoung usually feed on various kinds of small berries and insects. The\r\nfull-grown Turkeys prefer the pecan-nuts and wild grapes to any other\r\nkind of food.\r\n\r\nThey are also said to feed on grass, various kinds of plants, corn,\r\nand other grain, seeds, fruit, and also upon beetles, small lizards,\r\ntadpoles, etc. In feeding in the woods, they turn over the dry leaves\r\nwith their feet, and seem instinctively to know the presence of suitable\r\nfood. They not unfrequently betray their presence in the neighborhood by\r\nthe bare places they thus leave behind them in the woods where they have\r\nbeen feeding.\r\n\r\nAfter heavy falls of snow and the formation of a hard crust, the Turkeys\r\nare said to be compelled to remain several days on their roosts without\r\nfood thus proving their capability of enduring a continued abstinence.\r\n\r\nTurkeys are hunted in various ways and by different expedients to\r\nfacilitate their destruction. In the spring they are attracted by\r\ndrawing the air, in a peculiar manner, through one of the second\r\njoint-bones of a wing. The sound thus produced resembles the voice of\r\nthe female, on hearing which the male comes up and is shot. The cry of\r\nthe Barred Owl is also imitated at night where Turkeys are at roost,\r\nwho betray the place by their rolling gobble, uttered when alarmed. One\r\nof the most common methods of capturing Wild Turkeys is by means of a\r\ntrap known as a Turkey-pen. A covered enclosure is made, constructed\r\nof trees, about four feet high and of various sizes, closed everywhere\r\nexcept at one end, where a small opening is left through which a small\r\ntrench is dug, sloping very gradually at both ends, into and from the\r\npen. The portion nearest the enclosure is covered. This passage-way, the\r\ninterior of the pen, and the vicinity of the opening, to some distance\r\ninto the forest, are strewn with corn. The Turkeys, attracted by the\r\ncorn, follow it into the pen, and when they wish to leave endeavor to\r\nget out by the sides, but have not intelligence enough to escape by the\r\nopening through which they entered. In this manner they are sometimes\r\nentrapped in great numbers.\r\n\r\nIn unsettled parts of the country, Wild Turkeys are often known to\r\nassociate with tame ones, sometimes to fight with them and to drive them\r\nfrom their food.\r\n\r\nMr. Audubon supposed our common tame Turkey to have originated in these\r\nbirds, yet in his accounts of the habits of the latter he mentions\r\nseveral indications of divergence. A Wild Turkey which he had reared\r\nalmost from the shell, and which had become very tame, would never roost\r\nwith the domesticated birds, but always betook itself at night to the\r\nroof of the house, where it remained until dawn.\r\n\r\nMr. Bachman states that Wild Turkeys kept in confinement, in a condition\r\nof partial domestication, but separate from the domestic birds, lose\r\nthe brilliancy of their plumage in the third generation, become of a\r\npale brown, and have here and there an intermixture of white feathers.\r\nOn the other hand, Major Leconte states, most positively, that the Wild\r\nTurkey has never been known to become so nearly domesticated as to\r\npropagate its race in confinement, notwithstanding the many efforts made\r\nto accomplish this result. This statement is, however, negative, and\r\nmust be taken with reservation. In 1852, in Mr. Barnum’s grounds, near\r\nNiagara Falls, I saw Wild Turkeys with broods of young birds, though how\r\nfar successful this attempt proved in the sequel I do not know, and Dr.\r\nBachman’s statement seems to be quite positive evidence that they can be\r\nthus reared.\r\n\r\nMr. Audubon describes the eggs of the Wild Turkey as measuring 2.87\r\ninches in length and 2.00 in breadth, and rather pointed at one end;\r\ntheir ground-color is given as of a uniform pale-yellowish tint, marked\r\nall over with pale rusty-brown spots.\r\n\r\nSpecimens in my collection vary from 2.55 to 2.35 inches in length, and\r\nin breadth from 1.85 to 1.75 inches. They are of an elongate-oval shape,\r\nare pointed at one end, quite obtuse at the other.

Similar to var. _gallopavo_, but feathers of the rump, the\r\ntail-coverts, and tail-feathers, tipped with whitish, instead of dark\r\nrusty; gloss more greenish. ♂ (44,731, Mirador): Wing, 20.50; tail,\r\n18.50; culmen, 1.00; tarsus, 6.50; middle toe, 3.50.\r\n\r\nHAB. Rocky Mountains, from Western Texas to Arizona, and south along the\r\ntable land of Mexico.\r\n\r\nWild Turkeys from the vicinity of the Rocky Mountains differ strikingly\r\nfrom those east of the Mississippi in the feathers of the sides of the\r\nbody behind, and in the upper and under tail-coverts. These are all\r\ntipped with light brownish-yellow for about half an inch, more or less\r\nwith the region, and the tail is tipped with the same. The chestnut\r\nground of the tail and coverts is also considerably lighter. The gloss\r\non the feathers of the rump is green, not purple. The coverts, too, lack\r\nin a measure the purple shade in the chestnut. The metallic reflections\r\ngenerally have rather more green than in the eastern bird.\r\n\r\nIn one specimen (♀, 10,030, from Fort Thorn) the light edgings are\r\nalmost white, and so much extended as to conceal the entire rump. All\r\nthe feathers of the under parts of the body are edged broadly with\r\nwhite, and the tail is tipped with the same for more than an inch. This\r\nspecimen also has the head considerably more hairy than in the eastern\r\nskins, but the others from the same region do not differ so much in this\r\nrespect from eastern ones.\r\n\r\nTwo specimens from the Llano Estacado of Texas are exactly intermediate\r\nbetween New Mexican skins and examples from Arkansas, the former\r\nbeing typical _mexicana_, and the latter slightly different from\r\ntrue _gallopavo_. These Texan specimens have the tips of the upper\r\ntail-coverts pale ochraceous, instead of pure white; in the Arkansas\r\nskins these tips are rufous-chestnut, instead of dark maroon-chestnut,\r\nas in typical _gallopavo_ from Pennsylvania and Virginia.\r\n\r\nMany, or indeed most, specimens of _mexicana_ have the black subterminal\r\nzone of the tail with a more or less distinct metallic bronzing, which\r\nwe have never seen in any specimens of _gallopavo_.\r\n\r\nIt is to this race that we are indebted for the origin of our domestic\r\nTurkey, and not to that of the eastern parts of North America.\r\n\r\nHABITS. There is very little on record as to the possession of\r\ndistinctive peculiarities by this race of North American Turkeys. If,\r\nas is now generally supposed, it be the original source whence the\r\ndomestic fowl was derived, we are all sufficiently conversant with its\r\nperformances in the barnyard, and its excellences for the table.\r\n\r\nSpecimens of its eggs collected in Arizona exhibit no noteworthy\r\ndifferences from the _gallopavo_.\r\n\r\nIn the accompanying foot-note we reproduce an article on the origin of\r\nthe domestic Turkey, by Professor Baird, published in the Report of\r\nthe Agricultural Department for 1866, which contains some points of\r\ninterest, bearing on the origin of the domestic Turkey and the habits of\r\nthe Mexican variety.[114]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY TETRAONIDÆ.—THE GROUSE.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs already stated, the _Tetraonidæ_ are pre-eminently characterized\r\namong gallinaceous birds by their densely feathered tarsi, and by the\r\nfeathers of the nasal fossa or groove, which fill it completely, and\r\nconceal the nostrils. The toes are usually naked (feathered to the claws\r\nin the Ptarmigans), and with pectinations of scales along the edges. The\r\ntail-feathers vary from sixteen to eighteen and even twenty in number;\r\nthe tail is rounded, acute, or forked. The orbital region is generally\r\nsomewhat bare, with a naked stripe above the upper eyelid, beset by\r\nshort fringe-like processes, while many genera have an inflatable\r\nair-sac on the side of the neck.\r\n\r\nThe following synoptical table will give a general view of the North\r\nAmerican _Tetraonidæ_, although the arrangement is more artificial than\r\nnatural. The species of _Tetrao_ and _Bonasa_ inhabit wooded regions;\r\n_Lagopus_ belongs to the more arctic portions of the continent and the\r\nsnowy ridges of the Rocky Mountains; the others are found in the great\r\nprairies of the West, _Centrocercus_ being confined to the sterile\r\nplains covered with sage or wormwood.\r\n\r\nThe following synopsis is intended to aid in defining the genera, but\r\ndoes not profess to constitute a natural arrangement.\r\n\r\n\r\nGenera.\r\n\r\n  =A.= Legs feathered to and on the basal membrane of the toes, which\r\n  are bare. No ruff on the side of the neck, which, however, has an\r\n  extensible bare space.\r\n\r\n    =Canace.= Tail broad, nearly even, or truncate, and rounded\r\n    laterally, two thirds the wing. Nasal fossæ scarcely half the\r\n    culmen.\r\n\r\n    =Centrocercus.= Tail excessively lengthened and cuneate; longer than\r\n    the wings. Nasal fossæ two thirds the culmen. Shafts of feathers on\r\n    the lower throat very spinous.\r\n\r\n    =Pediœcetes.= Tail very short, but graduated, and with the two\r\n    middle feathers (perhaps tail-coverts) lengthened beyond the rest,\r\n    and two thirds as long as the wing; the next longest half the wing.\r\n    Nasal fossæ not half the length of culmen. Shafts of throat-feathers\r\n    normal.\r\n\r\n  =B.= Legs feathered to the lower end of tarsus.\r\n\r\n    =Cupidonia.= Tail very short, truncate, but laterally graduated;\r\n    half the wings. Sides of neck with long, pointed, or lanceolate,\r\n    stiff feathers. Nasal fossæ scarcely one third the culmen.\r\n\r\n  =C.= Legs feathered to the claws.\r\n\r\n    =Lagopus.= Tail about two thirds the wing, truncate; of sixteen to\r\n    eighteen feathers. Most species becoming white in winter; none of\r\n    the other genera exhibiting this peculiarity.\r\n\r\n  =D.= Lower half of tarsi bare, with two rows of scutellæ anteriorly.\r\n\r\n    =Bonasa.= Sides of neck with a ruff of broad, truncate, soft\r\n    feathers. Tail very broad, square, as long as the wings.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS CANACE, REICHENBACH.\r\n\r\nGEN. CHAR. Bill smooth, with no lateral groove, depressed, or broader\r\nthan high. Feathers of the head and neck all normal, i.e. no crest,\r\nnor lengthened plumes of any kind. Tail lengthened (i.e. nearly equal\r\nto wing), rounded, the feathers broad to the end; consisting of from\r\nsixteen to twenty feathers. Toes naked.\r\n\r\n\r\nSubgenera.\r\n\r\n  =Canace.= Tail of sixteen feathers; no air-sac on side of the neck.\r\n  Size small. (Type, _T. canadensis_, L.)\r\n\r\n  =Dendragapus.= Tail of twenty feathers; an inflatable air-sac on side\r\n  of the neck. Size large. (Type, _T. obscurus_, Say.)\r\n\r\nThe American species of Wood Grouse appear, on comparison, to be\r\ngenerically distinct from _Tetrao_, of the Old World, (type, _Tetrao\r\nurogallus_,) and, moreover, are themselves comprised under two definable\r\nsubgenera. _Canace_ proper has a near relative in _Falcipennis_, Elliot,\r\n(type, _Tetrao falcipennis_, Hartlaub,) of Siberia, which differs merely\r\nin the attenuation of the primaries, and seems to us not separable\r\nfrom _Canace_. There is no European genus nearly related to our birds.\r\n_T. urogallus_ differs very essentially in high, compressed, and\r\nlight-colored bill, elongated and stiffened feathers of the whole head\r\nand neck, metallic colors, etc. _T._ (_Lyrurus_) _tetrix_ approaches\r\nnearer in the bill, but also has metallic colors and a very peculiarly\r\nformed tail. Thus it seems absolutely necessary to adopt the name\r\n_Canace_, of Reichenbach, as a generic term by which to designate the\r\nAmerican Wood Grouse.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBGENUS CANACE, REICHENBACH.\r\n\r\n  _Canace_, REICHENBACH, Av.

Feathers above\r\ndistinctly banded with plumbeous; beneath uniform black, with a pectoral\r\nband of white, and white on the sides of the belly. Chin and throat\r\nabove, black. Tail with a broad brownish-orange terminal band. Length,\r\n16.20; wing, 6.70; tail, 5.44.\r\n\r\n_Female_ smaller, but somewhat similar; the black bars above broader,\r\nthe inner gray bars of each feather, including the tail, replaced by\r\nbroader ones of brownish-orange. The under parts have the feathers\r\nblack, barred with the brownish-orange, which, on the tips of the\r\nbelly-feathers, is pure white. The clear continuous black of the head\r\nand breast is wanting. The scapulars, greater coverts, and sides are\r\nstreaked as in the male.\r\n\r\nA female (No. 39,136, G. A. Boardman) from Maine differs from the above\r\ndescription in having the ground of the plumage a bright orange-rufous,\r\nthe distinct bars of which are broader than the black ones; this is\r\nprobably an autumnal bird, and represents the peculiar plumage of that\r\nseason.\r\n\r\n_Males_ vary, individually, in the extent or uniformity of the black of\r\nthe breast.\r\n\r\nSpecimens from Alaska (Nulato, Kodiak, etc.), Red River, Liard’s River\r\nand Fort Liard, Hudson’s Bay Territory, Canada, and Maine, appear to be\r\nabsolutely identical.\r\n\r\nThe young in downy state are pale buff-yellow; the head above, with the\r\nback and wings, pale fulvous; a black stripe on side of head (from bill\r\nto end of auriculars), two spots on crown, and transverse crescentic\r\nspots on back and wings, black.\r\n\r\nHAB. Spruce forests and swamps of the Northern United States to the\r\nArctic seas; west nearly to Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nHABITS. This bird, variously known as the Spruce or Wood Partridge,\r\nCanada, Black, or Spotted Grouse, is found, in favorable localities,\r\nfrom the Northern United States as far north as the woods extend,\r\nto the Arctic Ocean, being found, even in midwinter, nearly to the\r\n70th parallel. Sir John Richardson found all the thick and swampy\r\nblack-spruce forests between Canada and the Arctic Sea abounding with\r\nthis species. In winter it descends into Maine, Northern New York, and\r\nMichigan. Its migrations are, however, only partial, as it is found in\r\nthe severest weather of midwinter, in considerable numbers, as far north\r\nas latitude 67°. According to Mr. Douglas, west of the Rocky Mountains\r\nit is replaced by the _T. franklini_. This bird is said to perch in\r\ntrees, in flocks of eight or ten, and is so stupid that it may be taken\r\nby slipping a noose, fastened to the end of a stick, over its head. When\r\ndisturbed, it flies heavily a short distance, and then alights again\r\namong the interior branches of a tree. Richardson invariably found its\r\ncrop filled with the buds of the spruce-trees in the winter, and at\r\nthat time its flesh was very dark and had a strong resinous taste. In\r\ndistricts where the _Pinus banksiana_ grows it is said to prefer the\r\nbuds of that tree. In the summer it feeds on berries, which render its\r\nflesh more palatable.\r\n\r\nCaptain Blakiston states that he has found this species as far west as\r\nFort Carlton, and Mr. Ross has traced it northward on the Mackenzie to\r\nthe Arctic coast.\r\n\r\nMr. Audubon met with it in Maine, in the vicinity of Eastport, where\r\nthey were only to be met with in the thick and tangled forests of spruce\r\nand hackmatack. They were breeding in the inner recesses of almost\r\nimpenetrable woods of hackmatack or larches. He was informed that they\r\nbreed in that neighborhood about the middle of May, a full month sooner\r\nthan they do in Labrador. In their love-season the males are said to\r\nexhibit many of the singular manners also noticeable in the other\r\nmembers of this family. They strut before the female on the ground,\r\nsomething in the manner of the common domestic Turkey-cock, occasionally\r\nrising in a spiral manner above her in the air; at the same time, both\r\nwhen on the ground and in the air, they beat their wings violently\r\nagainst their body, thereby producing a peculiar drumming sound, which\r\nis said to be much clearer than the well-known drumming of the Ruffed\r\nGrouse. These sounds can be heard at a considerable distance from the\r\nplace where they are made.\r\n\r\nThe female constructs a nest of a bed of dry twigs, leaves, and mosses,\r\nwhich is usually carefully concealed, on the ground and under low\r\nhorizontal branches of fir-trees. The number of eggs is said to vary\r\nfrom eight to eighteen in number. It is imagined by the common people\r\nthat where more than ten eggs are found in the same nest they are the\r\nproduct of two females, who aid each other in their charge. The eggs are\r\ndescribed by Audubon as of a deep fawn-color, irregularly splashed with\r\ndifferent tints of brown. They have but a single brood in a season, and\r\nthe young follow the mother as soon as they leave the shell.\r\n\r\nAs soon as incubation commences, the males desert the females and keep\r\nin small flocks by themselves, removing to different woods, where they\r\nusually become much more shy and wary than at any other season of the\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nIn their movements on the ground these birds are said to resemble our\r\ncommon Quail, rather than the Ruffed Grouse. They do not jerk their\r\ntails in the manner of the latter bird, as they walk, nor are they known\r\nto burrow in the snow; but when they are pursued they invariably take\r\nrefuge in trees, from which they cannot be readily made to fly. When\r\ndriven from one place of refuge to another, they accompany their flight\r\nwith a few _clucks_, and those sounds they repeat when they alight.\r\nWhen a flock thus alights, it may all be readily secured by a little\r\nprecaution and pains. It is said that they are so unwary and regardless\r\nof the near presence of man, that when thus in the imagined shelter of\r\na tree they will permit themselves to be approached, the whole flock\r\nshot, or even knocked down with a stick. Sometimes they may all be taken\r\nalive, one after the other, by means of a noose affixed to the end of a\r\nlong pole.\r\n\r\nAccording to Audubon, the Canada Grouse indicate the approach of rainy\r\nweather by retiring to roost at an unusual time in the day, whenever\r\na storm is impending. If observed to fly up to their roost at midday,\r\nit rarely fails to rain or snow before the evening; and if, on the\r\ncontrary, they remain busily engaged in search of food until sunset, the\r\nnight and the following morning are pretty sure to be fresh and clear.\r\n\r\nThe young of this Grouse are very strong and active from the moment\r\nthey are hatched, and are able to fly at a very early age. When in\r\nLabrador, Mr. Audubon almost walked, by accident, upon a female Canada\r\nGrouse, surrounded by her young brood. This was about the middle of\r\nJuly. The affrighted mother, upon perceiving him, ruffled up all her\r\nfeathers in the manner of the common Hen, and advanced close to him as\r\nif determined to defend her offspring. Her distressed condition claimed\r\nhis forbearance, and she was allowed to remain in safety. As soon as\r\nhe retired she smoothed down her plumage and uttered a tender maternal\r\nchuck, when the little ones took to their wings with ease, though they\r\nappeared to be not more than one week old.\r\n\r\nMr. Audubon found this Grouse moulting as early as the 20th of July. At\r\nthat period the young were generally already able to fly fully a hundred\r\nyards in a single flight. They alighted on low trees and were easily\r\ntaken alive.\r\n\r\nThis Grouse feeds, in the summer, on berries of various kinds, as well\r\nas upon the buds and leaves of several different kinds of plants and\r\nshrubs. In the autumn they gorge themselves with the berries of the\r\nSolomon’s Seal. At this season their flesh is much the best. In the\r\nwinter, when they feed on the buds of the hackmatack and the spruce and\r\nfirs, and also upon the leaves of the spruces, as stated by Richardson,\r\nthey have a bitter, disagreeable taste, and are hardly fit to eat.\r\n\r\nThis Grouse may be readily kept in confinement, and even made to breed\r\nthere. Mr. Thomas Lincoln, of Dennysville, fed some of them on oats, on\r\nwhich food they appeared to thrive very well.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of this food vary in length from 1.75 inches to 1.68, and in\r\nbreadth from 1.22 to 1.20 inches. Eggs taken at Fort Resolution, by Mr.\r\nKennicott, have a ground of a deep dull cream-color, shaded with ochre.\r\nThey are of an oblong-oval shape, speckled and marked with spots of a\r\ndark chestnut-color. In these specimens the spots are larger towards the\r\nsmaller end.\r\n\r\n\r\nCanace canadensis, var. franklini, DOUGLAS.\r\n\r\nFRANKLIN’S GROUSE.\r\n\r\n  _Tétrao franklini_, DOUGLAS, Trans. Linn.

This consists chiefly\r\nin the rather longer, more even tail, with broader feathers, which\r\nare pure black instead of very dark brown, and entirely without the\r\norange terminal band. The white streaks on the scapulars are larger\r\nterminally, and much more conspicuous, and the upper tail-coverts are\r\nconspicuously barred terminally with white, not seen in the other. The\r\nfemale differs from that of _canadensis_ in the white bars at the ends\r\nof the tail-coverts, and in having the tail-feathers tipped with whitish\r\ninstead of orange-brown.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _C. franklini._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _C. canadensis._]\r\n\r\nHABITS. From the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific, and from Oregon to high\r\nnorthern latitudes, this variety replaces the common Spruce Partridge\r\nof the Eastern Continent. Sir John Richardson, as well as Mr. Drummond,\r\nregarded these birds as only a western variety of the _canadensis_. The\r\nlatter, who had ample opportunities for studying the manners of both,\r\nwas unable to perceive any difference between them. Mr. Douglas took a\r\ndifferent view, though he admitted that their habits were essentially\r\nthe same. Swainson also regarded the two birds as distinct species. This\r\nvariety is stated by Richardson to inhabit the valleys of the Rocky\r\nMountains, from the sources of the Missouri to those of the Mackenzie;\r\nand on the authority of Mr. Douglas, it is also to be seen sparingly\r\non the elevated platforms that skirt the snowy peaks of Mount Hood,\r\nMount St. Helens, and of Mount Baker, where it is said to run over\r\nthe shattered rocks and among the brushwood with amazing speed, only\r\nusing its wings as a last effort to escape. Mr. Douglas also states\r\nthat it makes its nest on the ground, of dried leaves and grass, not\r\nunfrequently at the foot of decayed stumps, or by the side of fallen\r\ntimber in the mountain woods. The eggs are incorrectly described as of\r\na dingy whiteness and as smaller than those of the European _Columba\r\npalumbus_.\r\n\r\nDr. Suckley found this Grouse abundant in the Rocky as well as in the\r\nBitterroot and the Cascade Mountains, and in Washington Territory, near\r\nthe Yakima Passes. It is known to the Indians as the _Tyee-kulla-kulla_,\r\nmeaning the _gentleman-bird_. It was only found plentiful in the eastern\r\nportion of Washington Territory. Specimens of this species, sent by\r\nDr. Suckley to the Smithsonian Institution, were procured by Mullan in\r\nSt. Mary’s Valley, in the Rocky Mountains. They were quite common in\r\nthat region, and were readily obtainable, as they were very tame and\r\nunsuspicious. Mr. George Gibbs informed Dr. Suckley that in November,\r\n1847, he obtained in the Willamette Valley a small Grouse that may\r\nprobably be referred to this species.\r\n\r\nMr. Lord thinks that this species is rarely found west of the Cascades;\r\nbut on the eastern side and along the whole district lying between the\r\nCascades and the Rocky Mountains it is common, always keeping among the\r\nmountains, to the height of seven thousand feet. He regards them as one\r\nof the most stupid of birds. When several are flushed together, they\r\nfly up into the nearest pine-tree, from which you cannot frighten them\r\nwith sticks and stones. He has often shot several in a tree where there\r\nwere others without the latter attempting to fly away. During the winter\r\nthey remain in the deep woods and sheltered places, and feed on the buds\r\nof the pines. They nest in early May, and have chickens in June and\r\nJuly. He was of the opinion that these birds do not pair; but from the\r\nlarge number of females, as compared with the males, he thinks they are\r\npolygamists.\r\n\r\nCaptain Blakiston considers this variety to be confined to the Rocky\r\nMountains and the country between that range and the Pacific. He met\r\nwith it for the first time while following an Indian trail through a\r\nthick pine woods, from the summit of the Kootenay Pass into the valley\r\nof the Flathead River. The bird arose and perched itself on a projecting\r\nbranch, when he was at once struck with the dissimilarity to the Canada\r\nGrouse, which was made still more apparent by the whiteness of its\r\nflesh. Afterwards he procured other specimens. He describes them as\r\nbeing quite as unsuspicious and stupid as the Canada Grouse, allowing\r\nthemselves to be shot on the trees without making any attempt to escape.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBGENUS DENDRAGAPUS, ELLIOT.\r\n\r\n  _Dendragapus_, ELLIOT, P.

Rocky Mountain region of the United States, principally south\r\nof South Pass, and Sierra Nevada, north to Oregon and south to San\r\nFrancisco Mountains, New Mexico.\r\n\r\nThe “Dusky Grouse” figured and described by Mr. Audubon of this species,\r\nis not the bird of Say, nor based on specimens collected by Townsend.\r\nThe figures were probably taken from the skins in possession of Mr.\r\nSabine, referred to by Bonaparte in American Ornithology (Vol. III,\r\n1828, 36), which Sabine proposed to name after Richardson. Douglas, in\r\ndescribing his _Tetrao richardsoni_, quotes “Sabine MSS.,” but does\r\nnot describe his specimens, and, as far as his incomplete description\r\ngoes, seems to have had the true _T. obscurus_ before him. Richardson’s\r\ndescription and figure belong to the second species, the same with\r\nAudubon’s. Wilson’s figures, in Illustrations of Zoölogy, 1831 (plates\r\nxxx, xxxi), are taken from specimens received from Mr. Sabine, of\r\nthe same species, but in different and less perfect plumage than Mr.\r\nAudubon’s.\r\n\r\nHABITS. This species was first discovered and described by Say in 1820,\r\nthough its existence had previously been known to the fur-trappers.\r\nIts food consists of various berries, and the flesh is said to be very\r\npalatable.\r\n\r\nDr. Newberry pronounces this Grouse decidedly the handsomest of all\r\nthe American birds of this family; its flesh white, and fully equal to\r\nthat of the eastern Ruffed Grouse or Quail. It is said to inhabit the\r\nevergreen forests exclusively, and to be found not uncommonly in the\r\nSierra Nevada, as well as in the wooded districts of the country lying\r\nbetween the Sacramento Valley and the Columbia. In the Cascade Mountains\r\nDr. Newberry found it associated with the Ruffed Grouse, which it\r\nresembles in habits more than any other species. When on the ground they\r\nlie very close, flying up from your very feet as you approach them, and,\r\nwhen flushed, always take to a tree, from which they cannot be dislodged\r\nexcept by shooting them. In the spring the male sits motionless on a\r\nbranch of a pine or a spruce, and utters a booming call, which, by its\r\nremarkable ventriloquial powers, seems rather to mislead than to direct\r\nthe sportsman, unless he is experienced in shooting this kind of Grouse.\r\n\r\nMr. George Gibbs informed Dr. Suckley that he has met with the Dusky\r\nGrouse as far south as the Russian River Mountains, in California, and\r\nfound it also common on the east side of the Cascades, as far north as\r\nthe 49th parallel.\r\n\r\nDr. Cooper’s account of these birds is substantially similar to the\r\naccount given by Dr. Suckley of the _fuliginosus_. He found it common\r\nin most of the forests, especially in the dense spruce woods near the\r\ncoast. It was rarely seen on the open prairie. In the dense woods it\r\nwas exceedingly difficult to detect. During May, near the coast, and\r\ntill August, on the mountains, the low tooting of this Grouse was heard\r\neverywhere, sounding something like the cooing of a Pigeon, but in the\r\nsame deep tone as the drumming of the Ruffed Grouse. Dr. Cooper also\r\nmentions its remarkable powers of ventriloquism, so that while the bird\r\nmay be sitting on a tree directly over your head the sound seems to come\r\nfrom places quite remote.\r\n\r\nDr. Woodhouse states that the Dusky Grouse is found among the mountains\r\nabout Santa Fé, in New Mexico.\r\n\r\nThis Grouse was first met with by Mr. Ridgway on the Sierra Nevada,\r\nin the vicinity of Carson City, where it was seen in the possession\r\nof Indians who had been hunting on the mountains. It was found on\r\nthe East Humboldt Mountains, in the month of September, and at that\r\ntime occurred in small flocks, consisting chiefly of young birds, and\r\nprobably composed of single families. Afterwards, in the summer of 1869,\r\nit was found in considerable abundance in Parley’s Park, a few miles\r\nfrom Salt Lake City. It there chiefly inhabited the copses of scrub-oaks\r\nalong the lower border of coniferous woods. In July it was found in\r\nthe Uintah Mountains in very great abundance, and for a while formed\r\nthe chief subsistence of the party. It was there known as the Mountain\r\nGrouse. Nothing very distinctive was ascertained in regard to its\r\nhabits, except that it was said to resemble very closely, in manners,\r\nthe Ruffed Grouse. Its flesh was excellent eating.\r\n\r\nDr. Suckley, in a series of papers on the Grouse of the United States\r\nwhich were read before the New York Lyceum in 1860, states that this\r\nspecies probably extend their range to quite a distance south of\r\nlatitude 40° along the line of the Rocky Mountains, in New Mexico. This\r\nwriter claimed to have met with them near Pike’s Peak, in the Cheyenne\r\nPass, and in 1853 he found them in great numbers in Lewis and Clarke’s\r\nPass, west of Fort Benton. He also found them abundantly in Oregon and\r\non the slopes of the Cascade and Coast Ranges, extending wherever pine\r\nor fir timber occurs, to the very borders of the ocean. The Black Hills,\r\nin Nebraska, he gives as their most eastern limit.\r\n\r\nThe same author corrects the statements of Douglas as to certain habits\r\nof this species. The males are said not to be particularly pugnacious,\r\nand very rarely forsake the boughs of the pine or fir trees for a rocky\r\neminence. They feed on berries only during a brief season in autumn, at\r\nall other times of the year subsisting upon the leaves of the pine and\r\nfir, especially those of the Douglas Fir. This food imparts a strong\r\nresinous flavor to the flesh of this Grouse, which, however, is not\r\nunpleasant, and after a while becomes quite attractive to the epicure.\r\nThe love-notes of this bird are said to be deep, soft, plaintive, but\r\nunmusical, and resemble the whirring sounds made by a rattan, swung\r\nrapidly and in jerks through the air. These notes usually begin the\r\nfirst week in March. The young are able to fly feebly by the first of\r\nJuly. By the last of August they have attained their full size. In the\r\nwinter they retire to the tops of the loftiest firs, where they pass\r\nthe season in an almost immovable state of hibernation. Between July\r\nand winter they may be readily shot. Once raised, they invariably fly\r\nto trees. They heed but little the report of a gun unless they have\r\nbeen wounded. Their flesh is said to be midway between the color of the\r\nPinnated and the Ruffed Grouse, partaking of their good qualities, but\r\nsurpassing either.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of this species are oval in shape; one end is a little more\r\nobtuse than the other. The ground is of a pale cream-color, and is\r\nmarked with small rounded spots of reddish-brown. These are more\r\nnumerous and larger towards the larger end. They measure 1.95 inches in\r\nlength and 1.45 in breadth.\r\n\r\n\r\nCanace obscurus, var. fuliginosus, RIDGWAY.\r\n\r\nOREGON DUSKY GROUSE.\r\n\r\n  _? Tetrao obscurus_, NEWBERRY, P. R. R. Rept.

(Tail-band .60 of an inch wide). A female (46,073,\r\nSept., 1866) from same locality is so strongly washed with dark, almost\r\ncastaneous, ferruginous as to appear mostly of this color above, this\r\nbeing very bright on the crown and forehead.\r\n\r\nHABITS. This race is the more northern and northwestern coast form of\r\nthe Dusky Grouse, and is found from the Columbia River and British\r\nColumbia to Alaska. According to Dr. Suckley, it is generally known as\r\nthe Blue Grouse in Oregon, and is also called the Pine Grouse, as well\r\nas the Dusky Grouse. He met with it for the first time when his party\r\nhad reached the main chain of the Rocky Mountains, and where they found\r\nit exceedingly abundant, as afterwards in the Blue Mountains of Oregon,\r\nthe Cascade Mountains, and in all the timbered country between the Coast\r\nRange and the Pacific Ocean. About the middle of November these birds\r\nare said to entirely disappear, and it is very rare to meet with even\r\na single individual between that period and the 20th of the following\r\nMarch. As to their whereabouts during this period there is a great\r\ndifference of opinion among the settlers. Some maintain that they are\r\nmigratory and retire to the south. Others are of the opinion that they\r\nretire to the tops of the highest evergreen trees, where they pass the\r\ncold season in a state of partial torpor among the thickest foliage of\r\nthe branches. As these birds are known to subsist on the leaves of the\r\n_Coniferæ_, and can always obtain sufficient water from the snow and\r\nrain-drops to supply their wants, Dr. Suckley was inclined to favor the\r\nlatter explanation of their absence. He saw one of these birds on the\r\nground during a fall of snow, in January, near the Nisqually River, in\r\nWashington Territory, and he was informed that a hunter near Olympia,\r\nwhose eyesight was remarkably excellent, was able, any day during the\r\nwinter, to obtain several birds by searching carefully for them among\r\nthe tree-tops of the tallest and most thickly leaved firs. This requires\r\nmuch better eyesight than most men possess, for these birds are of a\r\nsombre hue, crowd very closely to the limb, and sit there immovable.\r\nThey are therefore very difficult to find among the dense branches.\r\n\r\nThe first indication of their presence in spring is the courting call\r\nof the male. This is a prolonged sound, resembling the whir of a rattan\r\ncane moved rapidly through the air. This is repeated several times with\r\nconsiderable rapidity, and then stops for a brief interval. This is said\r\nto be produced by the alternate inflation and contraction of sacs, one\r\non each side of the throat, which are usually concealed by the feathers,\r\nand are covered by an orange-colored, thick, corrugated skin. At Fort\r\nSteilacoom these birds were very abundant during the spring and early\r\nsummer, and were mostly confined to the forests of firs. Later in the\r\nseason, and after hatching, they are more generally found on the ground\r\nin search of berries and seeds. When alarmed, they seek safety among\r\nthe dense foliage of the trees, seeming instinctively to understand\r\nthe advantage of thus hiding. He has known an entire flock of five,\r\nconcealed among the ferns and grass, to be shot one by one, without\r\nan attempt being made by a single individual to fly. This Grouse is\r\nsaid to be a very fine table bird, its pine taste only adding to its\r\ngame-flavor. Their full weight is from 2¾ to 3½ pounds.\r\n\r\nDr. Cooper never met with the nest of eggs of either of the races of the\r\nDusky Grouse, but in June flocks of half-grown young were killed by the\r\nIndians near Puget Sound. In winter they were so rarely seen west of\r\nthe mountains that they are believed to keep entirely in the trees. In\r\nOctober, 1853, he saw a flock running through the snow near the Spokane\r\nPlains, one of which was shot; but he never afterwards met with any in\r\nthe winter.\r\n\r\nMr. J. K. Lord found this Grouse almost exclusively on the western side\r\nof the Rocky Mountains. It appeared at Vancouver, at Nisqually, and\r\nalong the banks of the Fraser River, about the end of March, the male\r\nbird announcing his coming by a kind of love-song. This is a booming\r\nnoise, repeated at short intervals, and so deceptive that Mr. Lord has\r\noften stood under the tree where the bird was perched and imagined the\r\nsound came from a distance.\r\n\r\nMr. Nuttall found this Grouse breeding in the shady forests of the\r\nregion of the Columbia, where he saw or heard them throughout the\r\nsummer. He describes the tooting made by the male as resembling the\r\nsound caused by blowing into the bung-hole of a barrel. They breed on\r\nthe ground, and are said to keep the brood together all winter.\r\n\r\nTownsend describes the eggs as numerous, of a cinereous-brown color,\r\nblunt at both ends, and small for the bird. The actions of the female,\r\nwhen the young are following her, are said to be exactly similar to\r\nthose of the Ruffed Grouse, employing all the artifices of that bird in\r\nfeigning lameness, etc., to draw off intruders.\r\n\r\n\r\nCanace obscurus, var. richardsoni, DOUGLAS.\r\n\r\nRICHARDSON’S DUSKY GROUSE.\r\n\r\n  _Tetrao obscurus_, AUD.

In regard to distinctive peculiarities in habits and manners,\r\nof this form of Grouse, if it possesses any, our information is quite\r\nlimited. In its external markings and in size it appears to be readily\r\ndistinguishable from the _T. obscurus_ either specifically or as a\r\nwell-marked interior race. Mr. J. K. Lord refers to it in his account\r\nof the _obscurus_, where he states that between the Cascades and the\r\nRocky Mountains the Dusky Grouse appears to be replaced by a well-marked\r\nvariety, if not a distinct species. In size it is a trifle smaller, but\r\nthe great mark of distinction is the entire absence of the white band at\r\nthe end of the tail. In their habits, in their periods of arrival and\r\ndeparture, or rather of appearance and disappearance, the two varieties\r\nare pronounced to be, in every respect, similar. In regard to their\r\nunexplained disappearance and reappearance, Mr. Lord is of the opinion\r\nthat these birds do not migrate, but only retire into the thickest\r\ntrees, and, living on the buds, pass the winter thus sheltered in the\r\ntree-tops.\r\n\r\nCaptain Blakiston thinks that this species is the form that inhabits the\r\ninterior of British North America, and refers the figure of the male in\r\nRichardson’s _Fauna_ to the _richardsoni_,—the Black-tailed and smaller\r\nspecies. In his wanderings he met with these birds only in or near the\r\npine woods on the slopes of the Rocky Mountains; but, having killed\r\nonly females, he could not feel certain of the species. These Grouse\r\nrange towards the Pacific as far as the Cascade Mountains of Oregon and\r\nBritish Columbia, and along the Rocky Mountains from the head-waters\r\nof the Platte to the Liard River, a tributary of the Mackenzie. When\r\nthe ranges of the two species are fully defined, he thinks the _T.\r\nrichardsoni_ will be found the more northern bird.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of _Tetrao richardsoni_ are very similar, except in size, to\r\nthose of the _obscurus_, resembling them closely in their ground-color,\r\nas well as in their markings. In the specimens in the cabinet of the\r\nBoston Natural History Society the spots are smaller, a little less\r\ndistinct, and less numerous. The eggs are 1.75 inches in length, and\r\nfrom 1.35 to 1.36 inches in breadth.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS CENTROCERCUS, SWAINSON.\r\n\r\n  _Centrocercus_, SWAINSON, F. B. A. II, 1831, 496.

The Cock of the Plains appears to be confined to dry and sterile\r\nregions, from the Black Hills to California and Oregon, and from British\r\nColumbia nearly to Arizona, but only in those portions of the plains in\r\nwhich the _Artemisia_, or sage, abounds. It was met with by Townsend\r\nfor the first time about fifty miles west of the Black Hills. He did\r\nnot find them in the valley of the Snake River, but saw them again at\r\nWallah-Wallah, on the banks of the Columbia, and near the mouth of the\r\nLewis River. He only found it on the plains that produce the wormwood,\r\non which plant it feeds, and in consequence of which the flesh becomes\r\nso bitter that it is unfit for food. It was very unsuspicious and easily\r\napproached, rarely flying unless hard pressed, and running ahead at the\r\ndistance of a few feet, clucking like the common Hen. When disturbed,\r\nit would often run under the horse’s feet. According to his account it\r\nrises very clumsily, but, when once started, flies with great rapidity\r\nand also to a great distance. It is said to have the sailing motion of\r\nthe Pinnated Grouse. They are abundant in autumn on the branches of the\r\nColumbia, at which time they are regarded as good food by the natives,\r\nand are taken in great quantities in nets.\r\n\r\nMr. Nuttall met with this Grouse in considerable numbers on the north\r\nbranch of the Platte. They were always on the ground in small flocks\r\nor pairs, by no means shy; but when too nearly approached, uttering a\r\nrather loud but short guttural cackle, and rising with a strong whirring\r\nsound. Their notes, at times, strongly resembled those of the common\r\nHen. He never met with them in any forest, nor have they been taken near\r\nthe coast of California.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =2561= ♂ ⅓ ⅓\r\n\r\n_Centrocercus urophasianus._]\r\n\r\nThis species was first obtained by Lewis and Clark’s party in their\r\nexpedition to the Rocky Mountains. It was afterwards met with by\r\nDouglas, who published in the Linnæan Transactions (XVI, p. 133) an\r\naccount of its habits. He described its flight as slow, unsteady, and\r\nas affording but little amusement to the sportsman; being a succession\r\nof flutterings, rather than anything else. They rise hurriedly, giving\r\ntwo or three flaps of the wing, swinging from side to side in their\r\nmovement, and gradually falling, making a whirring sound, at the same\r\ntime uttering a cry of _cuck-cuck-cuck_, like the common Pheasant. They\r\npair in March and April.\r\n\r\nAt the mating-season the male is said to select some small eminence\r\non the banks of streams for the very singular performances it goes\r\nthrough with at that period in the presence of its mate. The wings are\r\nlowered and dragged on the ground, making a buzzing sound; the tail,\r\nsomewhat erect, is spread like a fan; the bare and yellow œsophagus\r\nis inflated to a prodigious size, and said to become nearly half as\r\nlarge as its body, while the silky flexile feathers on the neck are\r\nerected. Assuming this grotesque form, the bird proceeds to display a\r\nsingular variety of attitudes, at the same time chanting a love-song\r\nin a confused and grating, but not an offensively disagreeable tone,\r\nrepresented as resembling _hurr-hurr-hurr-r-r-r-hoo_, ending in a deep\r\nand hollow utterance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Centrocercus urophasianus._]\r\n\r\nTheir nests were found, by Douglas, on the ground, under the shade of\r\n_Artemisia_, or when near streams, among _Phalaris arundinacea_, and\r\nwere carefully constructed of dry grass and slender twigs. The eggs are\r\nsaid to be as many as from thirteen to seventeen in number, and the\r\nperiod of incubation to be twenty-one or twenty-two days. The young\r\nleave the nest soon after they are hatched.\r\n\r\nIn the winter these birds are said to be found in large flocks of\r\nseveral hundreds, in the spring in pairs, and later in the summer and\r\nfall in small family groups. They were abundant throughout the barren\r\namid plains of the Columbia and in Northern California, but were not met\r\nwith east of the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nDr. Newberry regards this Grouse, when in full plumage, as rather a\r\nhandsome bird, and much better looking than any figure he has seen\r\nof it. It is much the largest of American Grouse, weighing from five\r\nto six pounds. The female is much smaller than the male, and is of a\r\nuniform sober-brown color. The male bird has a distinctive character in\r\nthe spaces of bare orange-colored skin which occupy the sides of the\r\nneck, and are usually concealed by the feathers, but may be inflated to\r\na great size. The species was not found in the valleys of California,\r\nbut belongs both to the fauna of the interior basin and to that of the\r\nRocky Mountains, the dry desert country lying on both flanks of this\r\nchain. He first found it high up on Pit River, and once came suddenly\r\nupon a male in an oasis near a warm spring, which started up with a\r\ngreat flutter and rush, and, uttering a hoarse _hek-hek_, flew off with\r\nan irregular but remarkably well-sustained flight, which was continued\r\nuntil the bird was out of sight. In searching around he soon found its\r\nmate, which rose from under a sage-bush with a noise like a whirlwind.\r\nThis specimen was secured, and these birds were afterwards found to be\r\nquite abundant, but very strong-winged and difficult to kill. It was no\r\nuncommon thing, Dr. Kennerly states, for him to pour a full charge of\r\nshot into them at a short distance, dislodging a quantity of feathers,\r\nand yet to have them fly off to so great a distance before they dropped\r\nthat he could not follow them. He found them only in the vicinity of\r\nthe sage-bushes, under which they were usually concealed. He afterwards\r\nsaw them very abundant on the shores of Wright and Rhett Lakes. In one\r\ninstance he observed a male bird to sink down on the ground, as the\r\ntrain approached, depressing its head, and lying as motionless as a\r\nstick, which it greatly resembled. As he moved towards it, the bird\r\nlowered its head until it rested on the ground, and made itself as\r\nsmall as possible, and did not rise until he had arrived within fifteen\r\nfeet of it. West of the Cascade Range it did not occur, and all its\r\npreferences and habits seemed to fit it for the occupancy of the sterile\r\nregion of the central desert. Its flesh is dark and highly flavored with\r\nthe wormwood. The young, if parboiled and stewed, are said to be quite\r\ngood; but, on the whole, this Grouse is inferior for the table to any\r\nother American species.\r\n\r\nDr. Cooper gives this bird as common in Washington Territory, on the\r\nhigh barren hills and deserts east of the Cascade Mountains, and limited\r\nin its range by the growth of the _Artemisia tridentata_, the leaves of\r\nwhich shrub seem to be the principal part of its food; the flesh tasting\r\nso strongly of it as to be unpalatable. He saw none north of the Spokane\r\nPlains, the country being apparently too woody. On those plains they\r\nwere very common. He describes its flight as more heavy and less noisy\r\nthan that of most Grouse, and when they are started, it commonly extends\r\na long distance before alighting.\r\n\r\nDr. Suckley found the Sage-Cock abundant on the plains of Oregon, near\r\nSnake River, on both sides of the Blue Mountains, as also along the line\r\nof the Columbia, on the open plains, and on the sage barrens of the\r\nYakima and Simcoe Valleys,—in fact, wherever the artemisia was found.\r\nThe leaves of this shrub either are preferred or are necessary to its\r\nexistence, for no other food was found in their full stomachs, even in\r\nlocalities where abundance of grass-seed, wild grain, grasshoppers, and\r\nother kinds of food, might be found. This species has apparently the\r\npower of going a long while without water. Lieutenant Fleming informed\r\nDr. Suckley that he found them about twelve miles west of Fort Laramie,\r\nbut they were not seen east of that point so far south. In August, 1853,\r\none was procured about two hundred miles east of the Rocky Mountains. He\r\nalso observed a small flock on the plains bordering on Milk River, in\r\nNebraska. Near Soda Lake, the sink of the Mohave River, Dr. Cooper met\r\nwith it, which is without doubt the most southern point at which it has\r\nbeen discovered. Dr. Coues has never met with it in Arizona.\r\n\r\nMr. Ridgway encountered it everywhere in the Great Basin where there\r\nwas a thrifty growth of the artemisia, which appears everywhere to\r\nregulate its existence. He corroborates the accounts given of its\r\nheavy, lumbering flight; and when it has once escaped, it flies so\r\nfar that the sportsman rarely has a second opportunity to flush it.\r\nIt rises apparently with great effort. He was told by the settlers of\r\nNevada and Utah that the Sage-Hen was never known to touch grain of\r\nany kind, even when found in the vicinity of grain-fields. This is\r\nattributed to a very curious anatomical peculiarity of the species,—the\r\nentire absence of a gizzard; having instead a soft membranous stomach,\r\nrendering it impossible to digest any hard food. In a large number of\r\nspecimens dissected, nothing was found but grasshoppers and leaves of\r\nthe artemisia.\r\n\r\nTwo eggs in my cabinet, from Utah, measure, one 2.20 by 1.50 inches, and\r\nthe other 2.15 by 1.45. They are of an elongate-oval shape, slightly\r\npointed at one end. Their ground-color varies from a light-greenish drab\r\nto a drab shaded with buff. They are thickly freckled with small rounded\r\nspots of reddish-brown and dark chestnut.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS PEDIŒCETES, BAIRD.\r\n\r\n  _Pediœcetes_, BAIRD, Birds N. Am. 1858, 625.

British America, from Hudson’s Bay Territory, south to northern\r\nshore of Lake Superior, and west to Alaska and British Columbia.\r\n\r\nHABITS. The Arctic form of the Sharp-tailed Grouse is found throughout\r\nthe Arctic regions, from Alaska southward and eastward to an extent not\r\nfully ascertained. Mr. Dall states that this variety is not uncommon at\r\nFort Yukon, where Mr. Lockhart found it breeding and obtained its eggs.\r\nIt has also been seen some two hundred miles down the river, but it is\r\nsaid not to be found below the cañon known as the Ramparts. Captain\r\nKetchum, in his adventurous winter trip from Nulato to Fort Yukon,\r\nis said to have killed several of these birds. Specimens are in the\r\nSmithsonian Museum from Moose Factory and elsewhere along the southern\r\npart of Hudson’s Bay, and it is said to be abundant about Nipigon Lake,\r\nnorth of Lake Superior.\r\n\r\nMr. Kennicott found the nest of this bird at Fort Yukon, at the foot\r\nof a clump of dwarf willows. It was in dry ground, and in a region in\r\nwhich these willows abounded and were quite thickly interspersed with\r\nother trees, especially small spruces, but no large growth. The nest is\r\nsaid to have been similar to that of _Cupidonia cupido_. Mr. Lockhart\r\nalso found it breeding in the same region. The nests seen by him were\r\nlikewise built on a rising ground under a few small willows.\r\n\r\nRichardson assigns as the northern limit of this species the region\r\nof the Great Slave Lake, latitude 61°, and as its most southern point\r\nlatitude 41°. It was found in abundance on the outskirts of the\r\nSaskatchewan plains and throughout the wooded districts of the fur\r\ncountries, frequenting the open glades or low thickets on the borders\r\nof lakes, especially where the forests have been partially cleared;\r\nperching on trees in the winter, but keeping to the ground in the\r\nsummer; and, at all seasons, met with in small flocks of from ten to\r\nsixteen. They are said, early in spring, to select some level place,\r\nwhere a covey meets every morning and runs round in a circle of about\r\ntwenty feet in diameter, so that the grass is worn quite bare. If any\r\none approaches this circle, the birds squat close to the ground; but if\r\nnot alarmed by a too near approach, they soon stretch out their necks to\r\nsurvey the intruder, and resume their circular course, some running to\r\nthe right and others to the left, meeting and crossing each other. These\r\n“partridge-dances” are said to last a month or more, or until the female\r\nbegins to incubate. This Grouse rises from the ground with the usual\r\nwhirring noise, and alights again at a distance of a few hundred yards,\r\nsometimes on the ground or on the branches of a tree. In winter they\r\nhide in the snow, and make their way with ease through the loose drifts,\r\nfeeding on the buds of the willows, larches, aspens, etc. In summer and\r\nautumn their food is principally berries. They are said to lay about\r\nthirteen eggs early in June; the nest being on the ground, formed of\r\ngrasses lined with feathers.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of this variety closely resemble those of the _columbianus_,\r\nbut are generally of a decidedly darker ground. They average 1.75\r\ninches in length by 1.28 in breadth. Their ground is a dark tawny-brown\r\nminutely dotted with darker spots of brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nPediœcetes phasianellus, var. columbianus, BAIRD.\r\n\r\nCOLUMBIA SHARP-TAIL.\r\n\r\n  _Tetrao phasianellus_, (not of LINN.,) ORD, Guthr.

This species is the more southern of the two varieties of\r\nSharp-tailed Grouse found in North America. Owing to the confusion which\r\nhas existed until recently, in which both the northern and southern\r\nraces have been considered as one, the geographical distribution of each\r\nmay not be defined with complete exactness. The present form is found in\r\nIllinois and Wisconsin, and westward to Oregon and Washington Territory,\r\nand as far to the north as British Columbia and the southern portions of\r\nthe Saskatchewan Valley.\r\n\r\nDr. Newberry found this Grouse associated with the Prairie Chicken\r\non the prairies bordering on the Mississippi and the Missouri, and\r\nfrequently confounded with that bird, though readily distinguishable by\r\nits lighter plumage, its speckled breast, and smaller size. It is always\r\nthe least abundant of the two species, when found together. The range of\r\nthis Grouse extends much farther westward; the _cupido_ being limited\r\nto the valley of the Mississippi, while the former is found as far west\r\nas the valleys of California. North of San Francisco his party first\r\nfound it on a prairie near Canoe Creek, fifty miles northeast of Fort\r\nReading; subsequently, on a level grass-covered plain in the upper cañon\r\nof Pit River, these birds were met with in great abundance. They were\r\nalso found about the Klamath Lakes and in the Des Chutes Basin, as far\r\nas the Dalles. The flesh was very much like that of the Prairie Chicken.\r\nThis bird is said to lie close, and when flushed to fly off, uttering\r\na constantly repeated _kuck-kuck-kuck_, moving with steadiness and\r\nconsiderable swiftness. It is, however, easily killed. The young birds\r\nare fat and tender, and as they fall on the grassy prairie scatter their\r\nfeathers, as if torn to pieces.\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr. Suckley, the Sharp-tailed Grouse entirely replaces\r\nthe Pinnated Grouse in Washington Territory. He first noticed it near\r\nold Fort Union, at the mouth of the Yellowstone River. From that point\r\nto the Cascade Mountains of Oregon and Washington Territory it was\r\nexceedingly abundant wherever there was open country and a sufficiency\r\nof food. In certain places they were in great numbers in the autumn,\r\ncongregating in large flocks, especially in the vicinity of patches\r\nof wild rye, and more recently near settlements where there were\r\nwheat-stubbles. They resemble the Pinnated Grouse in habits. Where they\r\nare numerous, they may frequently be found, on cold mornings in the\r\nautumn or early winter, perched on fences or on leafless trees, sunning\r\nthemselves in the early sunlight. At Fort Dalles a young bird, scarcely\r\ntwo days old, was found on the first of April. This early incubation\r\nseems to prove that they must have more than one brood in a season.\r\nThe young Grouse was confided to the charge of a Hen with a brood of\r\nyoung chickens; but it refused to associate with them, and escaped,\r\nprobably to perish of cold. Dr. Cooper adds that this Grouse is found in\r\nWashington Territory only in the low alluvial prairies of the streams\r\nemptying into the Columbia east of the Cascade Mountains, where it was\r\nfound in flocks of several hundreds. They shun high grounds and forests\r\nentirely. The only cry he ever heard them utter was a cackle when\r\nsuddenly started from the ground. Their wings make a loud whirring, as\r\namong others of this family.\r\n\r\nMr. J. K. Lord found this species abundantly distributed on the western\r\nslope of the Rocky Mountains, ranging right and left of the 49th\r\nparallel. It was particularly numerous on the plains near the Kootanie\r\nRiver, round the Osoyoos Lakes, and in the valley of the Columbia. He\r\ndid not meet with any on the western side of the Cascade Range. It is\r\nalso found in the Red River settlements and in Northern Minnesota.\r\n\r\nMr. Elliot is quite in error in stating that this Grouse does not occur\r\neast of the Mississippi as it is found nearly throughout Northern\r\nIllinois and Southern Wisconsin. I have seen a flock within thirty miles\r\nof Chicago, and have from time to time had their eggs from Dane County,\r\nWisconsin.\r\n\r\nMr. Lord regards this Grouse as remarkable both for its field\r\nqualities—such as lying well to a dog, rising with a loud rattling\r\nwhir, frequenting open grassy prairies, and flying as straight as an\r\narrow—and for its excellence as a table dainty. For delicacy of flavor\r\nits flesh is unequalled. With the fur-traders this species is known\r\nas the Spotted Chicken, and is, furthermore, the _Skis-kin_ of the\r\nKootanie Indians. Its singular combination of colors—white, black,\r\nand brownish-yellow—makes it exactly resemble the ground on which\r\nit lives, and admirably harmonizes with the dead twigs and leaves\r\nof the artemisia, the dry and sandy soil, the brown of the withered\r\nbunch-grass, and the sombre-colored lichens of the rocks. It often\r\nrequires a keen and practised eye to distinguish one of these birds from\r\nthe ground on which it has fallen, even though the eye be kept on the\r\nspot where it was seen to fall. This similarity of colors with those of\r\nthe prairie no doubt effectually conceals them from the hawks and owls.\r\n\r\nIts favorite haunt is on open grassy plains in the morning, keeping\r\nconcealed in the long thick grass, coming about midday to the stream to\r\ndrink, and to dust itself in the sandy banks. It seldom goes into the\r\ntimber, always remains close to the prairie, and never retires into the\r\ndepth of the forests. It lays its eggs on the open prairie in a tuft of\r\ngrass, or near the foot of a small hillock, nesting early in spring,\r\nand depositing from twelve to fourteen eggs. The nest is a mere hole\r\nscratched in the earth, with a few grass-stalks and root-fibres laid\r\ncarelessly and loosely over the bottom. Mr. Lord describes the eggs as\r\nof a dark rusty-brown, with small splashes or speckles of darker brown\r\nthickly spattered over them.\r\n\r\nAfter nesting-time they appear in broods about the middle of August, the\r\nyoung birds being about two thirds grown. At this time they frequent\r\nthe margins of small streams where there is thin timber and underbrush.\r\nAfter the middle of September they begin to pack, two or three coveys\r\ngetting together, and flock after flock joining until they accumulate\r\ninto hundreds. On the first appearance of snow they begin to perch\r\non the dead branches of a pine or on the tops of fences. Near Fort\r\nColville, after snow fell, they assembled in vast numbers in the large\r\nwheat-stubbles. They became wary and shy, the snow rendering every\r\nmoving thing so conspicuous that it was next to impossible for dogs to\r\nhunt them.\r\n\r\nThe food of this Grouse consists principally of berries in the summer\r\nmonths, such as the snowberry, the bearberry, the haws of the wild rose,\r\nand the whortleberry, grain, the larvæ of insects, grass-seeds, etc. In\r\nthe winter they run over the snow with ease and celerity, dig holes in\r\nit, and burrow underneath in the manner of a Ptarmigan. During the two\r\nwinters Mr. Lord spent at Colville, flocks of these birds congregated\r\naround the hayricks at their mule-camp. In a temperature often 30° and\r\nmore below zero, and the snow several feet deep, they were strong, fat,\r\nand wild, and did not appear to suffer at all from the intense cold.\r\nIndeed, they are said to pair very early in the spring, long before\r\nthe snow has gone off the ground, and their meeting is preceded by\r\nsome very singular performances, which are called by the fur-traders\r\nchicken-dances, to several of which Mr. Lord was an eyewitness. Groups\r\nof these birds assemble for their dances either about sunrise or late\r\nin the afternoon, selecting for the purpose a high round-topped mound,\r\nwhich in the course of their evolutions becomes worn quite bare. At\r\none of the dances witnessed by Mr. Lord there were about twenty birds\r\npresent; the birds nearest him were head to head, like gamecocks in\r\nfighting attitude,—the neck-feathers ruffed up, the little sharp tail\r\nelevated straight on end, the wings dropped close to the ground, but\r\nkeeping up a rapid vibration or continued drumming sound. They circled\r\nround and round each other in slow waltzing time, always maintaining\r\nthe same attitude, but never striking at each other. Sometimes the pace\r\nincreased, and one pursued the other until the latter faced about.\r\nOthers jumped about two feet in the air until out of breath, and then\r\nstrutted about in a peculiar manner; and others went marching about with\r\ntails and heads as high up as they could get them.\r\n\r\nCaptain Blakiston states that on the Saskatchewan this species was very\r\ngenerally distributed throughout the interior. He met with it just below\r\nthe forks of the Saskatchewan, and traced it to the western base of the\r\nRocky Mountains. He found it breeding at Fort Carlton. He regards these\r\nbirds as of polygamous habits. In the fall they are found in families,\r\nin the semi-wooded country bordering on the prairies. They perch on\r\ntrees, frequently at the very top, and their crops are found stuffed out\r\nwith berries. These are chiefly the fruit of the bearberry, the ground\r\njuniper, the snowberry, the small prairie roses, the buffalo-berry, and\r\nseveral kinds of buds. They have also been known to feed on caterpillars\r\nand other insects baked and crisped by prairie fires. Captain Blakiston\r\nwas also an eyewitness of one of the singular love-performances of these\r\nbirds, known as dances. His account of it, which is very full, is almost\r\nexactly in correspondence with the account referred to as given by Mr.\r\nLord.\r\n\r\nMr. Ridgway met with this Grouse at one locality only, encountering them\r\nlate in September in the Upper Humboldt Valley. There it was found in\r\nconsiderable numbers in the rye-grass meadows on the foot-slopes of the\r\nClover Mountains. They were startled from the ground, where they were\r\nhidden in the grass, and when surprised frequently took refuge in the\r\nwillow-thickets along the streams near by. Their flesh was found to be\r\nmost excellent.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of this species vary considerably in size, but average about\r\n1.80 inches in length and 1.30 in breadth. They are oval in shape,\r\nslightly pointed at one end. Their ground varies from a light clay to a\r\ndark rusty-brown, generally plain, but frequently speckled minutely with\r\nfine dottings of a darker brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS CUPIDONIA, REICHENBACH.\r\n\r\n  _Cupidonia_, REICHENBACH, Av.

Prairies of the Mississippi Valley, from Louisiana, northward. East\r\nto Pocono Mountains, Pennsylvania. Formerly along the eastern coast of\r\nthe United States from Long Island to Cape Cod, or farther. A few still\r\nleft on Naushon (?) and Martha’s Vineyard.\r\n\r\nA pair from Calcasieu Pass, Louisiana, most resemble Illinois specimens,\r\nbut are smaller (wing, 8.60, instead of 9.00), and there is rather more\r\nreddish, with less black, in the plumage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Cupidonia cupido._]\r\n\r\nHABITS. The Pinnated Grouse, more generally known through the country as\r\nthe Prairie Chicken or Prairie Hen, once occurred as far to the east as\r\nMassachusetts, a few still remaining on the island of Martha’s Vineyard,\r\nand where it was, in the early settlement of the country, a very\r\nabundant bird; and to the southwest to Texas and throughout the Indian\r\nTerritory, where it appears to be extending with the areas developed\r\nby civilization. While at the East this bird has almost entirely\r\ndisappeared, in consequence of the increase of population, and except\r\nhere and there in a few small and distant districts has disappeared\r\nfrom the Middle and Eastern States, at the West and Southwest it has\r\ngreatly extended its distribution, appearing in considerable numbers,\r\nand constantly increasing as the country is settled and the land\r\ncultivated with grain. Even in Illinois, where there has been a large\r\nincrease of population during the past ten years, these birds are known\r\nto have become much more numerous. It is, however, probable that they\r\nwill again be driven from this region when the population becomes quite\r\ndense. Mr. Allen met with this species in several points in Kansas and\r\nin Colorado, where they had either just made their appearance, or where\r\nthey had recently been noticed, and were observed to be on the increase.\r\nThe small remnants left in Massachusetts are protected by law, which\r\nmay preserve them a few years longer; and in Illinois and other Western\r\nStates stringent provisions seek to prevent their wanton destruction. In\r\nMichigan, according to Mr. D. D. Hughes, this Grouse is common in the\r\ntwo southern tiers of counties, but is rarely met with in that State\r\nfarther north,—an absence attributable to the want of open country and\r\nsuitable food, as west of Lake Michigan it is found in great abundance\r\nmuch farther north. In the more southern portion of the State it is\r\nalready very rare, and in localities completely exterminated.\r\n\r\nDr. Woodhouse found this bird quite abundant throughout the Indian\r\nTerritory; more numerous, however, in the vicinity of settlements.\r\nDuring the fall of 1849, as he was passing down the Arkansas River,\r\nalong the road leading from Fort Gibson to Fort Smith, these birds were\r\nin large flocks, feeding among the oaks upon the acorns; hundreds were\r\nto be seen at the same time. It was also very common throughout Eastern\r\nTexas.\r\n\r\nMr. Dresser found the Pinnated Grouse very common in travelling from\r\nBrownsville to Victoria, after leaving the chaparral and entering the\r\nprairie country. Throughout the whole of the prairie country of Texas it\r\nis abundant.\r\n\r\nThey were found by Mr. Audubon especially abundant in the States of\r\nKentucky, Missouri, Illinois, and Indiana, where his observations date\r\nback more than half a century, and when the country was comparatively\r\nunsettled. It was there, he states, in what was then known as the\r\nBarrens of Kentucky, that before sunrise, or at the close of the day, he\r\n“heard its curious boomings, witnessed its obstinate battles, watched\r\nit during the progress of its courtships, noted its nest and eggs, and\r\nfollowed its young until, fully grown, they betook themselves to winter\r\nquarters.”\r\n\r\nWhen he first removed to Kentucky the Pinnated Grouse were so plentiful,\r\nand were held in such low estimation, that no hunter deigned to shoot\r\nthem. They were, moreover, looked upon with ill-favor by the inhabitants\r\non account of the mischief they committed among the fruit-trees of\r\nthe orchards during winter, when they fed upon the buds, or in the\r\nspring, when they consumed the grain in the fields. In those days, in\r\nthe winter, this Grouse would enter the farm-yard and feed among the\r\npoultry, would even alight on the house-tops or walk in the streets of\r\nthe villages. On one occasion he caught several alive in a stable at\r\nHenderson, where they had followed some Wild Turkeys. Twenty-five years\r\nlater, Mr. Audubon adds, in the same country where they had been so\r\nvery abundant, scarcely one could be found. Mr. Audubon speaks of their\r\nselling in Eastern markets, in 1840, at from five to ten dollars per\r\npair. This is so no longer, facilities in railroad transportation and\r\ntheir continued abundance at the West rendering them a comparatively\r\nplentiful and cheap article of food.\r\n\r\nMr. Audubon mentions that at the same period they were still to be\r\nmet with in some portions of New Jersey, in the “brushy” plains of\r\nLong Island, on Mount Desert Island in the State of Maine, and also in\r\nanother tract of barren country near Mar’s Hill in the same State. In\r\nregard to the two last-named localities he may have been misinformed.\r\n\r\nMr. Lawrence mentions this species as still occurring in the vicinity\r\nof New York City. Mr. Turnbull mentioned it as now very rare, but\r\noccasionally met with, in the counties of Monroe and Northampton in\r\nPennsylvania, and on the plains in New Jersey. It is not referred to by\r\neither Professor Verrill or Mr. Boardman as occurring in any part of\r\nMaine. It is, however, given by Mr. McIlwraith as an occasional visitor\r\nnear Hamilton, in Canada, on the western frontier, a few individuals\r\nbeing occasionally observed along the banks of the St. Clair River, but\r\nnot known to occur farther east.\r\n\r\nMr. Audubon also mentions having found these birds abundant in all the\r\nvast plains bordering on the prairies of the Arkansas River, and on\r\nthose of the Opelousas in Louisiana.\r\n\r\nIn the earliest days of spring, even before the snows have all been\r\nmelted, these birds no longer keep in large flocks, but separate into\r\nsmaller parties, and the mating-season commences, during which their\r\nmanners, especially those of the male, are very peculiar and striking. A\r\nparticular locality is selected, to which they resort until incubation\r\nhas commenced. The males meet in this place, and engage in furious\r\nbattle with one another. At this season they are especially conspicuous\r\nfor their great pomposity of bearing; with tails outspread and inclined\r\nforward to meet the expanded feathers of their neck, and with the\r\nglobular, orange-colored, bladder-like receptacles of air on their necks\r\ndistended to their utmost capacity, and issuing a peculiar sound, spoken\r\nof as _booming_, these birds strut about in the presence of one another\r\nwith various manifestations of jealous dislike and animosity, soon\r\nending in furious contests. Their wings are declined, in the manner of\r\nthe Cock-Turkey, and rustle on the ground as the birds pass and repass\r\nin a rapid manner; their bodies are depressed, and their notes indicate\r\ntheir intense excitement. Upon the appearance of a female answering to\r\ntheir calls, they at once engage in their desperate encounters. They\r\nrise in the air and strike at one another in the manner of a gamecock,\r\nand several engage in a miscellaneous scrimmage, until the weaker give\r\nway, and, one after another, seek refuge in the neighboring bushes, the\r\nfew remaining victors discontinuing their contests as if from sheer\r\nexhaustion.\r\n\r\nThe “booming” or “tooting” sounds made by these birds is heard before\r\ndaybreak, and also at all hours before sunset, in places where they are\r\nabundant and tame; but where they are rare and wild they are seldom\r\nheard after sunrise, and their meetings then are in silence. Even in the\r\nfall the young males evince their natural pugnacity by engaging in short\r\nbattles, which their parents usually interrupt and put a stop to.\r\n\r\nThis bird nests, according to the locality in which it is met with, from\r\nthe beginning of April to the last of May. In Kentucky, Mr. Audubon has\r\nfound their nests with eggs early in April, but the average period there\r\nwas the first of May. Their nests he describes as somewhat carelessly\r\nformed of dry leaves and grasses, interwoven in a tolerably neat manner,\r\nand always very carefully placed among the tall grass of some large tuft\r\nin the open ground of the prairies, or, in barren lands, at the foot of\r\na small bush.\r\n\r\nThe eggs are said to be from eight to twelve in number, never more; they\r\nare larger and more spherical than those of the common _umbellus_, and\r\nare of a darker shade. The female sits upon them about twenty days, and\r\nas soon as the young can extricate themselves from the shell the mother\r\nleads them away, the male having previously left her.\r\n\r\nEarly in the fall the various broods begin again to associate together,\r\nand at the approach of winter it is not uncommon to see them in flocks\r\nof several hundred individuals.\r\n\r\nThe young broods, when come upon suddenly and taken by surprise,\r\ninstantly scatter and squat close to the ground, so that, without a dog,\r\nit is impossible to find them. The mother gives a single loud chuck as\r\na signal of danger, and the young birds rise on the wing and fly a few\r\nyards in different directions, and then keep themselves perfectly still\r\nand quiet until the mother recalls them by a signal indicating that the\r\nperil has passed. In the meanwhile she resorts to various devices to\r\ndraw the intruder away from the place.\r\n\r\nThis Grouse raises but a single brood in a season; and if the first\r\nlaying has been destroyed or taken, the female seeks out her mate,\r\nmakes another nest, and produces another set of eggs. These are usually\r\nsmaller in size and less in number than those of her first laying.\r\n\r\nThe Pinnated Grouse is said to be easily tamed, and may be readily\r\ndomesticated, though I do not know that the experiment has been\r\nthoroughly tried. Mr. Audubon once kept sixty of them in a garden near\r\nHenderson, Ky. Within a week they became tame enough to allow him to\r\napproach them without being frightened. He supplied them with abundance\r\nof corn and other food. In the course of the winter they became so\r\ngentle as to feed from the hand, and walked about his garden like so\r\nmany tame fowl, mingling occasionally with the poultry. In the spring\r\nthey strutted, “tooted,” and fought as if in their wild state. Many eggs\r\nwere deposited, and a number of young birds were hatched out; but they\r\nproved so destructive to the vegetables that the experiment was given up\r\nand the Grouse were killed. The male birds were conspicuous for their\r\ncourage, and would engage in contest with the Turkey-cocks, and even\r\nwith the dunghill cock, rather than yield the ground.\r\n\r\nIn severe weather these birds have been known to roost in trees, but\r\nthey generally prefer to rest on the ground. Advantage is sometimes\r\ntaken to secure them by visiting their resting-places in the night with\r\nnets. On the ground they walk somewhat in the manner of the common Hen,\r\nbut in a more erect attitude. When surprised, they rise with a whirring\r\nsound; but if they perceive the approach of any one at a sufficient\r\ndistance, they run off with considerable speed, and hide by squatting\r\nin the grass or among bushes. They are fond of dusting themselves in\r\nploughed fields or in dusty roads, rearranging their feathers in the\r\nmanner of the Wild Turkey.\r\n\r\nWhen the female, with her young brood, is surprised, she instantly\r\nruffles up her feathers, and acts as if she contemplated flying in\r\nyour face; this she rarely, if ever, attempts, but resorts to various\r\nartifices to decoy the intruder away.\r\n\r\nTheir flight is said to be strong, regular, and swift, and may be\r\nprotracted to the distance of several miles. It is less rapid than that\r\nof the _umbellus_, and the whirring, as they rise from the ground, less\r\nconspicuous. As they rise, they utter four or five very distinct clucks,\r\nbut at times fly in silence.\r\n\r\nTheir flesh is dark, and the flavor is very distinctly gamy, and is\r\ngenerally regarded as excellent.\r\n\r\nIn the love-season the males inflate the two remarkable air-bladders,\r\nwhich, in color and shape, resemble small oranges, lower their heads\r\nto the ground, open their bills, and give utterance to very singular\r\nand distinctly separated notes, by means of the air contained in these\r\nreceptacles, rolling somewhat in the manner of the beatings of a muffled\r\ndrum. The air-reservoirs are alternately filled and emptied as they make\r\nthese sounds. Their notes may be heard to the distance of nearly a mile.\r\nWhen these skins are punctured, they are no longer resonant.\r\n\r\nThe late Mr. David Eckby, of Boston, furnished Mr. Audubon with a full\r\naccount of their habits, as observed by him in Martha’s Vineyard,\r\nand also on the island of Nashawena, where they were then kept in a\r\npreserve. They were observed never to settle down where the woods\r\nwere thick or the bushes tangled, but invariably in the open spaces;\r\nand as they never start up from the thick foliage, but always seek\r\nto disengage themselves from all embarrassment in their flight by\r\nreaching the nearest open space, they offer to the sportsman a very\r\nfair mark. The sound they utter in rising, when hard pressed, is said\r\nto resemble the syllables _coo-coo-coo_. They were observed to feed on\r\nthe berries of the barberry, which abound on those islands, boxberries,\r\ncranberries, the buds of roses, pines, and alders, and on the nuts of\r\nthe post-oaks, and in the summer upon the more esculent berries. At the\r\nWest they frequently feed on the seeds of the sumach. They are also very\r\ndestructive to the buds of the apple, and are very fond of the fruit\r\nof the fox-grape and the leaves and berries of the mistletoe. During\r\nthe planting-season their visits to the wheat and corn fields are often\r\nproductive of great damage.\r\n\r\nThree eggs in my collection, taken from a nest near Osage Village, in\r\nIndian Territory, which contained sixteen eggs, measure, one 1.65 by\r\n1.20 inches, another 1.63 by 1.28, and the third 1.75 by 1.28 inches.\r\nThey are of a rounded-oval shape, more obtuse at one end than the other,\r\nand of a uniform color, which varies from a light clay-color to a dark\r\ntawny-brown. The eggs are sometimes, but not always, minutely sprinkled\r\nwith brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nCupidonia cupido, var. pallidicinctus, RIDGWAY.\r\n\r\nTHE TEXAS PRAIRIE HEN.\r\n\r\n  _Cupidonia cupido_, var. _pallidicinctus_, RIDGWAY.\r\n\r\nSP.

These three, when\r\nbased on specimens from the regions where their characters are most\r\nexaggerated and uniform, appear sufficiently distinct; but when we\r\nfind that specimens from the New England States have the rufous bodies\r\nof _umbellus_ and gray tails of _umbelloides_, and that examples from\r\nEastern Oregon and Washington Territory have the dark rusty bodies of\r\n_sabini_ and gray tails of _umbelloides_, and continue to see that\r\nthe transition between any two of the three forms is gradual with\r\nthe locality, we are unavoidably led to the conclusion that they are\r\nmerely geographical modifications of one species. The continuity of\r\nthe dark subterminal tail-band in _umbellus_, and its interruption in\r\n_umbelloides_,—characters on which great stress is laid by Mr. Elliot\r\nin his monograph, above cited,—we find to be contradicted by the large\r\nseries which we have examined; neither condition seems to be the rule in\r\neither race, but the character proves to be utterly unreliable.\r\n\r\nIn the less elevated and more southern portions of the Eastern Province\r\nof the United States, as in the Mississippi Valley and the States\r\nbordering the Gulf and South Atlantic, the rufous type is prevalent;\r\nthe tail being always, so far as the specimens we have seen indicate,\r\nof an ochraceous-rufous tint. Specimens with gray tails first occur\r\non the Alleghany Mountains, and become more common in the New England\r\nStates, the specimens from Maine having nearly all gray tails. Specimens\r\nfrom Labrador approach still nearer the var. _umbelloides_,—the extreme\r\ngray condition,—and agree with Alaskan specimens in having more brown\r\nthan those from the interior portions of British America or the Rocky\r\nMountains of the United States. More northern specimens of the inland\r\nform have, again, a greater amount of white than those from the south or\r\ncoastward. Passing southward from Alaska toward Oregon, specimens become\r\ndarker, until, in the dense humid forests of the region of the Columbia,\r\na very dark plumage, with little or no gray, prevails, most similar to,\r\nbut even more reddish and much darker, than the style of the Southern\r\nStates of the Eastern Province. Passing from the low coast forests to\r\nthose of the mountains, we find again equally dark specimens, but with\r\ngrayish tails; the amount of gray increasing, and its shade lightening,\r\nas we approach the central Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\nThe American species of _Bonasa_ possesses a quite near analogue in the\r\n_B. sylvestris_, Bonap. (_Tetrao bonasia_, Linn.), or Hazel Grouse, of\r\nEurope. This species has almost exactly the same pattern of coloration\r\n(including tail-markings), but is very much smaller, has the neck-tufts\r\nrudimentary and white, and the throat black, instead of just the\r\nreverse.\r\n\r\n\r\nBonasa umbellus, var. umbellus, STEPHENS.\r\n\r\nRUFFED GROUSE; PARTRIDGE; PHEASANT.\r\n\r\n  _Tetrao umbellus_, LINN.

This well-known bird—the common Birch Partridge of the British\r\nProvinces, the Partridge of New England and the West, and the Pheasant\r\nof the Middle States—is found throughout the wooded portions of eastern\r\nNorth America, from Georgia to Nova Scotia, and from the Atlantic to\r\nthe Rocky Mountains. Richardson, in his description of its habits in\r\nthe _Fauna Boreali-Americana_, states that he met with it as far north\r\nas the 56th parallel of latitude, and mentions, in a note, that Mr.\r\nDrummond procured specimens on the sources of the Peace River, in the\r\nvalley of the Rocky Mountains, in no wise different from those taken\r\non the Saskatchewan. On the banks of the latter river it was found\r\nvery plentiful, frequenting the horse-paths and the cleared spaces\r\nabout the forts. In winter, when the ground was covered with snow, it\r\noccurred in flocks of ten or twelve, perching on trees. These flocks\r\ncould be approached without difficulty, and several birds successively\r\nshot from the same tree without exciting the alarm of the survivors, if\r\nthe lowest were shot first. When disturbed, like most Grouse they flew\r\noff very swiftly, with a loud whirring sound, and to a considerable\r\ndistance before alighting. The male in spring makes a very singular loud\r\nnoise, resembling the quick roll of a drum, which is produced by rapid\r\nstrokes of the wings, and which may be heard to quite a distance. In the\r\nmating-season the male struts about in the presence of the female, in\r\nthe manner of a Turkey-cock, its wings drooping, its tail erected, and\r\nits ruffs displayed.\r\n\r\nThis Grouse is a constant resident in the district in which it occurs,\r\nand, as a general rule, is in no sense migratory, though it is stated\r\nby Audubon that in some regions where they are very abundant they\r\nperform partial sorties at the approach of autumn. These only occur\r\nin mountainous regions in which during the winter months there is an\r\ninsufficiency of food. These movements have been noticed on the banks\r\nof the Ohio and the Susquehanna Rivers. Their journeys occur in the\r\nmonth of October, when they are in the best condition for the table,\r\nand they are much sought after. In the spring, those which have escaped\r\nreturn to the regions from which they migrated. Mr. Audubon states that\r\nin October, 1820, he observed a large number moving from the States of\r\nOhio, Indiana, and Illinois into Kentucky, many of which were shot, and\r\ntaken to the Cincinnati market.\r\n\r\nThis Grouse is found wherever wooded country is to be met with, and\r\nis especially fond of the craggy sides of mountains and hills, and\r\nthe borders of rivers and small streams. They also often occur in\r\nconsiderable numbers in low lands, and were discovered by Mr. Audubon\r\nbreeding in the thickest cane-brakes of Indiana and Kentucky.\r\n\r\nThey find in these wooded regions at once the means of food and shelter.\r\nIn these localities they breed, and there they may usually be seen at\r\nall seasons of the year. They are thus to be met with in nearly all\r\nthe Southern States, being abundant in the Carolinas, in Kentucky,\r\nTennessee, and Mississippi, as far to the southwest as Natchez. They\r\nare not known to occur in any part of Louisiana. Dr. Newberry did not\r\nencounter this bird within the limits of California, but found them very\r\nabundant in the wooded portions of the Cascade Mountains and in the\r\nWillamette Valley. The Oregon specimens were generally darker than the\r\neastern varieties, but the habits were apparently everywhere the same.\r\n\r\nIn many important respects the habits of this bird appear to be\r\nessentially different from those of the Pinnated Grouse. Unlike that\r\nspecies, it is rarely met with on open plains. Though the food of the\r\ntwo species appears to be very similar, this peculiarity and difference\r\nof abode is quite striking. This is more noticeable at the South than in\r\nthe more northern and western portions of the country, where, however,\r\nthis species seems to seek, and the _cupido_ to avoid, the wooded\r\nsections.\r\n\r\nThey differ, also, in their more solitary disposition, being never\r\nseen in groups of more than four or five, and rarely other than singly\r\nor in pairs. Wilson observed, while travelling among the mountains of\r\nPennsylvania, that these birds left the woods early in the morning to\r\nseek the open path or road to pick up gravel or to glean among the\r\ndroppings of the horses, and he was thus enabled to supply himself\r\nwithout leaving the path. On the ground they were observed to move with\r\ngreat stateliness, spreading out their broad fan-like tails.\r\n\r\nThe flight of this Grouse is low, straightforward, and rarely protracted\r\nmore than a few hundred yards at a time. It is somewhat stiff, and\r\nperformed with frequent, almost continual, beatings of its wings. When\r\nit is flushed from its nest, or is suddenly startled from the ground by\r\na dog, it rises with a loud whirring sound, which noise, however, is\r\nnot made when the bird rises of its own accord. Its movements on the\r\nground are very stately and graceful, except when it is approached too\r\nnear, when it runs in a rapid manner, lowers its head, and spreads its\r\ntail, and either seeks shelter or takes to flight. When it hides in the\r\nbushes, it usually squats and remains close. They are difficult birds\r\nto shoot on the wing, the more so that they make sudden and unexpected\r\nchanges in the direction of their flight. When they light on a tree,\r\nthey are more readily followed and shot. The prevalent notion that,\r\nwhere several of these birds are in the same tree, several may be\r\nprocured if you are careful to shoot the lowest one each time, was not\r\nverified by Mr. Audubon’s experience.\r\n\r\nThe love-season of the Partridge commences early in March, and is\r\nindicated by the drumming of male birds. This sound is produced by the\r\nmale bird only, who, standing on a fallen log or on an elevated rock\r\nin the most retired portion of the woods, lowers his wings, expands\r\nhis tail, contracts his neck, and seems to inflate his whole body. The\r\ntufts of feathers on either side of the neck are elevated, and the\r\nbird struts and wheels about in the most pompous manner possible to\r\nimagine. After manœuvring in this manner for some time, he begins to\r\nstrike the sides of his own body with his stiffened wings with short and\r\nrapid strokes. These become more and more rapid, until the noise they\r\nproduce seems continuous. These sounds may be heard at all hours of the\r\nday, but more generally early in the morning. The sound thus produced\r\nhas generally been compared to that produced by beating together two\r\ndistended bladders. But this gives one a very inadequate idea of the\r\nrolling, reverberating, ventriloquistic noise which these birds thus\r\noccasion. It is more like the distant and closing reverberations caused\r\nby remote thunder, and seems to the listener much nearer than it really\r\nis. It may be imitated in several ways, so as even to deceive the bird,\r\nand to bring him, in a fatal impulse of jealousy, to the shot of the\r\nsportsman.\r\n\r\nIn the spring these birds feed on the buds of several kinds of trees,\r\nespecially the birches. In Maine they are particularly fond of the buds\r\nof the black birch, which gives to their flesh a peculiar and very\r\nagreeable flavor, and from this in certain localities they are known as\r\nthe Birch Partridge. They also feed largely on the esculent berries of\r\nthe summer, as raspberries, blueberries, and huckleberries, and in the\r\nfall become plump and fat, and are esteemed a great delicacy.\r\n\r\nMr. Audubon states that, as this bird rises from the ground, it utters\r\na cackling note, which it repeats six or seven times, and then emits\r\na lisping whistle, like the cry of some young bird, which is rather\r\nremarkable. When the ground is covered by a fall of light snow, these\r\nbirds dive into it and conceal themselves, sometimes burrowing through\r\nit to the depth of several feet. When pursued, they frequently escape in\r\nthis manner. Many are taken under the snow; others are snared by nooses,\r\nor by means of figure of four traps.\r\n\r\nThis Grouse is more or less polygamous, and both sexes are somewhat\r\npromiscuous in their intercourse. The males only remain with the females\r\nuntil incubation has commenced, and then keep by themselves, unless\r\nrecalled by the females when their eggs have been taken or destroyed.\r\nThe males occasionally indulge in severe contests for the possession of\r\nthe female, but not to the same extent as with the Pinnated Grouse.\r\n\r\nThe female places her nest in some retired spot, usually on the edge of\r\nthe woods, or near an opening in it, always on the ground, and often\r\nunder the shelter of a projecting rock or a fallen log. The nest is very\r\nrude and simple, consisting of only a few leaves laid in a depression\r\nand not woven together. The eggs are from seven to twelve in number, and\r\nare generally of a uniform yellowish-brown color, and are very rarely\r\nmottled or spotted. During incubation the Partridge sits very closely,\r\nand permits a near approach before she will leave her charge. The young\r\nPartridges leave the nest as soon as they are hatched, following their\r\nmother, who calls to them with a clucking sound not unlike that of the\r\ncommon domestic Hen. The mother is very devoted, courageous, and wily\r\nin defending them. Coming suddenly upon a young brood of Partridges\r\nsquatted with their mother near the roadside in a woods, my first\r\nknowledge of their presence was received from the old bird flying\r\ndirectly at my face, and then tumbling about at my feet with frantic\r\nmanifestations of distress and imitated lameness. In the mean while the\r\nlittle ones scattered in every direction, and were not to be found. As\r\nsoon as she was satisfied of their safety, the parent flew to a short\r\ndistance, and I soon heard her clucking call to them to come to her\r\nagain. Altogether, it was one of the most striking scenes of parental\r\ndevotion and well-managed intervention I ever witnessed. When I came\r\nupon the mother, she had squatted upon the ground, and the young had\r\ntaken refuge under her wings.\r\n\r\nThe males keep apart from the females and the young until the approach\r\nof winter, when they reassemble in their search for food. In severe\r\nseasons, when the snow lies very deep, especially in Pennsylvania, they\r\nare said to feed on the buds of the Mountain Laurel, or some other\r\npoisonous shrub which imparts a poisonous character to their flesh.\r\nIn Maine they have been accused of resorting to apple-orchards and\r\ndestroying the fruit-buds, thus occasionally causing a serious injury to\r\nthe prospective harvest. We apprehend there is some foundation for these\r\ncharges.\r\n\r\nMr. William Street, of Easthampton, who resides on Mount Tom, writes\r\nme that he has found this Grouse very numerous in that vicinity.\r\nHaving lived in a secluded place ten years, and having met with these\r\nbirds constantly by day and by night, he has been able to note some\r\ninteresting peculiarities in their habits. The drumming by the male is\r\noften made on a stone as well as a log, the same perch being resorted\r\nto, when once chosen by a male bird, as long as it lives. In one\r\ninstance he knew one of these Partridges persistently adhere to its\r\ndrumming-place, even though the woods had all been cut away and a new\r\nroad made close by its post. They roost on the ground as well as on\r\ntrees, when near their home, and just where night overtakes them. They\r\ncan fly by night as well as by day, when disturbed, as he has often had\r\noccasion to notice, having started them up at all hours of the night.\r\nThey are very local in their habits, and never wander more than a\r\nhundred rods from the drumming-place of the male. This spot seems to be\r\nthe central point around which they live. The young keep with the old\r\nbirds throughout the fall and winter, and select their own homes in the\r\nspring, not far from those of their parents. When a flock is started up,\r\nthey separate and fly in every direction; but if one sits quietly down\r\nand keeps perfectly still, in less than an hour he will see them all\r\ncoming back, on foot, and all at about the same time.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of this species measure 1.60 inches in length by 1.15 in\r\nbreadth. They are usually unspotted and of a uniform dark cream-color,\r\noccasionally marked with darker blotches of the same. They are of an\r\nelongated oval, pointed at one end.\r\n\r\n\r\nBonasa umbellus, var. umbelloides, DOUGLAS.\r\n\r\nTHE MOUNTAIN PARTRIDGE.\r\n\r\n  _Tetrao umbelloides_, DOUGL. Linn. Trans.

In regard to the habits of this variety we have no information.\r\nIt was found by Mr. Drummond among the Rocky Mountains, near the sources\r\nof the tributaries of the Saskatchewan. He states that those he met with\r\nwere at least one third smaller than the _umbellus_, had a much grayer\r\nplumage and a shorter ruffle. He regarded it as a distinct species from\r\nthe common Partridge, which he also encountered in the same locality.\r\n\r\nMr. Ridgway met with this variety on the Wahsatch Mountains in October\r\nand during the summer.

Coast Mountains of Oregon, Washington, and British Columbia.\r\n\r\nThe specimens of Ruffed Grouse from the Pacific coast differ very\r\ngreatly from others in much darker tints of coloration, although the\r\npattern is precisely the same. The upper parts are dark orange-chestnut,\r\nmottled with black, the cordate light spots very distinct. The feathers\r\nof the breast are strongly tinged with reddish-yellow; those of the\r\nsides marked with broad and conspicuous bars of black, instead of\r\nthe obsolete brown. The under tail-coverts are orange-chestnut, with\r\nindistinct bars of black, and an angular terminal blotch of white.\r\nAll the light brown blotches and edgings of the eastern variety are\r\nhere dark brown or black. The jugular band between the ruffles is very\r\nconspicuously black. Specimens from Eastern Oregon and Washington have\r\ndark gray tails, and thus incline toward var. _umbelloides_.\r\n\r\nHABITS. The Western Ruffed Grouse was found abundant by Dr. Suckley in\r\nthe timbered districts throughout Oregon and Washington Territory. Its\r\nhabits seemed to be identical with those of the eastern birds. Owing to\r\nthe mildness of the season in the vicinity of Fort Steilacoom, the males\r\ncommence drumming as early as January, and in February they are heard to\r\ndrum throughout the night. In the autumn they collect in great numbers\r\nin the crab-apple thickets near the salt marshes at the mouths of the\r\nrivers emptying into Puget Sound. There they feed for about six weeks on\r\nthe ripe fruit of the northwestern crab-apple, the _Pyrus rivularis_ of\r\nNuttall.\r\n\r\nDr. Cooper also speaks of this Grouse as very abundant everywhere about\r\nthe borders of woods and clearings. It was common near the forests\r\neast of the Cascade Mountains up to the 49th degree. These birds\r\nvary in plumage there, a pale-grayish hue predominating. West of the\r\nmountains they are all of a very dark brown. There was, however, no\r\nperceptible difference in their habits or cries from those of the same\r\nbird elsewhere.\r\n\r\nMr. J. K. Lord assigns to this species an extended geographical range\r\nwest of the Rocky Mountains,—from the borders of California, throughout\r\nOregon and Washington Territories, extending high up on the slopes of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains, plentiful in all the timbered lands between the\r\nCascades and the rocky ruts along the banks of the Columbia, over the\r\nridge of the Cascades, and down their western slopes to Frazer’s River,\r\nin all the islands of the Gulf of Georgia, and everywhere on Vancouver\r\nIsland to its extreme northern end, and on the mainland as far north\r\nas latitude 53°. The habits of this Grouse are described as singularly\r\nerratic, and its food as varied in its character. In the spring their\r\nfavorite haunt is in the vicinity of stagnant pools, or in the brush\r\naround a marsh in which the wild swamp-crab, the black birch, and the\r\nalder grow. In such places they mate, and during the breeding-season are\r\nsaid to be very constant and devoted. During the time of pairing, and\r\nat intervals after their young are hatched, the male produces the sound\r\nknown as drumming. The bird is said to squat on a log or a fallen tree,\r\nmotionless as though it had no life. Suddenly all the feathers appear\r\nas if reversed, the tail is erected, the ruff round its neck stands\r\nout stiff and rigid, and the wings droop as if broken. These slowly\r\nvibrate, and then produce a sound loud and clear, like the thrum of a\r\ndouble-bass string. Then the wings move with increased rapidity, and the\r\nsound becomes a continuous throbbing hum. It then suddenly ceases, and\r\nafter a few minutes the same performance is repeated.\r\n\r\nMr. Lord also states that he has seen the males of this species fighting\r\nfuriously during the pairing season. Ruffing up their necks, with their\r\nheads and backs almost in a straight line, and with wings dropped,\r\nthey circle round and round each other, striking and pecking until the\r\nvanquished gives in, and the victor mounts upon a log and proceeds to\r\ndrum furiously.\r\n\r\nTheir nest is completed about the end of May, and is always placed under\r\na log on the ground, or at the foot of a bush. It is composed of a\r\nquantity of dead leaves, lined with dry grasses, bits of moss, and a few\r\nfeathers.\r\n\r\nMr. Lord adds that he found at least ten nests of this bird in one\r\nswamp near the Spokane Prairies. From ten to fourteen eggs was about\r\nthe average number; they are described as in color of a dirty white,\r\nand without any spots or freckles of a darker shade. The chickens\r\nat once leave the nest and follow their mother, who calls them with\r\na clucking sound, in the manner of a Hen, covers them when resting,\r\nand uses all kinds of feints and stratagems to lure an intruder from\r\nher young, fluttering along close to his feet as if her wings were\r\nentirely disabled, and then, when her chickens have had time to\r\nconceal themselves, suddenly darting off. When frightened, this Grouse\r\nrises with a loud rattling sound; but its natural upward movement is\r\nnoiseless.\r\n\r\nAfter the chickens are old enough, the flock removes to open hillsides\r\nwhere grass-seed, berries, and insects are in abundance. This Grouse\r\nnever packs, but remains in broods. In the fall, before they begin to\r\nfeed on the spruce buds, their flesh is said to be delicious; but after\r\nthe snow shuts them off from other food they feed on the fir buds, and\r\nthen their flesh acquires a strong flavor of turpentine.\r\n\r\nIn the tree this Grouse is not an easy bird to discover; so closely\r\ndoes its plumage resemble the lichen-covered bark that it is difficult\r\nto distinguish them, especially as, when alarmed, they crouch down\r\nlengthwise with the limb, and thus become concealed.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS LAGOPUS, VIEILLOT.\r\n\r\n  _Lagopus_, VIEILLOT, Analyse, 1816.

Richardson regarded this species as an inhabitant of the\r\nfur countries from the 50th to the 70th parallel of latitude, being\r\npartially migratory within those limits. It was found to breed among\r\nthe valleys of the Rocky Mountains, on the barren grounds, and along\r\nthe Arctic coasts. On the approach of winter it collects in flocks,\r\nand retires southward as the severity of the weather increases. They\r\nremain, however, in considerable numbers as far north as latitude 67°\r\neven in the coldest winters. It was found to be tolerably abundant at\r\nthe 65th parallel all the year, assembling in vast flocks on the shores\r\nof Hudson Bay in the winter time. Mr. Hutchins states that ten thousand\r\nof these birds have been captured in a single season at Severn River.\r\nRichardson adds that in 1819 these birds made their first appearance at\r\nCumberland House, latitude 54°, in the second week of November, and that\r\nthey returned to the northward again before the beginning of spring. In\r\nthe winter they are said to shelter themselves in thickets of willows\r\nand dwarf birches, on the banks of marshes and lakes, the buds of the\r\nsmaller shrubs being the principal part of their food at that season.\r\nDenuded sandy spots were their favorite resorts in the daytime, but they\r\npassed their nights in holes in the snow. When pursued by sportsmen or\r\nbirds of prey, they often terminate their flight by hastily diving into\r\nthe loose snow, working their way beneath its surface with considerable\r\ncelerity. In thick, windy, or snowy weather they were very shy, perching\r\non the taller willows, where it required a sharp eye to distinguish\r\nthem from flakes of snow. In the summer season they feed chiefly on\r\nthe berries of the alpine arbutus and other shrubs and plants, which\r\nare laid bare by the thaw, and which do not disappear until they are\r\nreplaced by a new crop. They incubate about the beginning of June, at\r\nwhich time the females moult. The males assume their red-colored plumage\r\nas soon as the rocks and eminences become bare, at which time they\r\nare in the habit of standing upon large stones, calling in a loud and\r\ncroaking voice to their mates, which, still in their white wintry garb,\r\nare hidden in the snows below. These birds are more usually in motion in\r\nthe milder light of night than in the broad glare of day.\r\n\r\nCaptain Blakiston traced this Grouse across the interior from Hudson’s\r\nBay to near the Rocky Mountains, and obtained a single specimen near\r\nFort Carlton. It does not come down every winter, however, so far south\r\non the Upper Saskatchewan. Near Lake Winnipeg, at Fort Cumberland,\r\nand to the eastward, they are common every winter, and numbers are\r\nobtained from the shores of Hudson’s Bay. Mr. Ross gives this species\r\nas common on the Mackenzie. Mr. Robert MacFarlane found it around Fort\r\nAnderson, where, he writes, it was always very numerous in that quarter\r\nat all seasons, and generally not difficult of approach. During the\r\nbreeding-season the males were to be found perched upon trees and stumps\r\nin the vicinity of the nest, while the female would rarely leave the\r\nlatter until almost trodden on. They are also said, by Mr. MacFarlane,\r\nto assume their summer plumage earlier than the males, differing in this\r\nstatement from Dr. Richardson’s. Their nest is always on the ground, and\r\nconsists only of a few decayed leaves placed in a depression. Sometimes\r\nother materials, such as hay, moss, feathers, etc., are found. While\r\nincubating, the female occasionally sits so close as to allow herself to\r\nbe caught, rather than leave the nest.\r\n\r\nThey begin to nest early in June, varying a little with the season, not\r\ncommencing so soon where the ground at that period was still covered\r\nwith snow. Eggs taken from the oviduct were almost invariably pure white\r\nin color. In one instance an egg taken from the oviduct of a female,\r\nJune 5, that had previously deposited eight eggs the same season, was\r\ncovered with coloring matter or marking so soft as to adhere to the\r\nfingers when touched. After the female has once begun to lay, Mr.\r\nMacFarlane observed that she deposits one egg each day until the whole\r\nnumber has been reached. This varies from eight to ten.\r\n\r\nThe males were always observed in the immediate vicinity of the nest,\r\nand began to assume their summer moult about the 6th of June, most\r\nof their necks at that time being already of a reddish-brown color.\r\nThe nests were always on the ground, and were mere depressions lined\r\nwith a few soft materials, generally leaves, occasionally mingled with\r\nfeathers, hay, etc., the feathers often being their own. The same nest\r\nwas often made use of in successive seasons. Eggs were found as late as\r\nthe 24th of June, and the female is supposed to sit about three weeks\r\nbefore hatching. Occasionally eggs were found dropped on the bare ground\r\nwithout any signs of a nest. In one instance the egg was pure white,\r\nlike one taken from the oviduct. It was found lying on the bare ground,\r\nwithout the least appearance of a nest in its vicinity.\r\n\r\nIn one instance where a nest was met with, on the banks of Swan River,\r\nby Mr. MacFarlane’s party, _en route_, the female was almost trodden\r\nunder foot before she fluttered off, when she at once turned about to\r\nface her enemies, spreading her wings and ruffling her feathers as if\r\nto attack or frighten them away. In another case a nest containing only\r\none fresh egg, in which the female had but just begun to deposit, was\r\nfound as late as June 25. Other eggs found June 27 contained very large\r\nembryos. Another nest, examined a fortnight later (July 10), had in it\r\nten perfectly fresh eggs. Mr. MacFarlane inferred that this nest had\r\nbeen robbed at an early period of the season. This time she apparently\r\nmade no attempt at another laying.\r\n\r\nIn several instances where both birds were present near a nest that was\r\ntaken, the male bird would make his presence known by giving utterance\r\nto very peculiar rough notes, indicative of alarm and of distress at\r\nthe proceedings. In one instance a nest was found in the midst of a\r\nclump of very small stunted willows, within thirty feet of the spot\r\nwhere Mr. MacFarlane’s tent was pitched. This was on the 21st of June,\r\nbut the nest escaped notice until the 22d of July, when the female was\r\nalmost trodden on as she was sitting on her eggs, where she had probably\r\nhad her nest during their entire stay. The eggs were warm when taken,\r\nand their contents were slightly developed. During the night the male\r\nPtarmigan disturbed the encampment by keeping up a constant utterance of\r\nhis rough and rather unpleasant notes. In another instance the female\r\nfluttered off, calling, and pretending to be badly wounded; while the\r\nmale bird, in the vicinity, made his near presence known by the loud\r\nmanner in which he expressed his disapprobation of such proceedings.\r\n\r\nIn one instance where an Indian had found a nest of this Ptarmigan,\r\nwhich then contained seven eggs, the female was seen, and the notes\r\nof the male bird were heard. He placed a snare about the eggs, but\r\non returning to the nest a few hours afterwards, he was surprised to\r\nfind that six of the eggs had disappeared during his brief absence. He\r\nsupposed a fox had taken them; but as no egg-shells were left behind,\r\nMr. MacFarlane has no doubt they were removed by the parent birds.\r\n\r\nWhen the young are hatched they follow the parents, both of whom keep\r\nabout them, and display great courage and devotion whenever there is\r\nany occasion, suffering themselves to be very closely approached, and\r\nutterly regardless of consequences in their desire to save their young.\r\nThe latter are very hard to recognize, owing to their close resemblance\r\nto the grass, in which they squat, and remain perfectly still.\r\n\r\nIn September and October of each season these Ptarmigans assemble in\r\nlarge flocks, but during winter seldom more than two or three dozen\r\nwere ever noticed in single companies. They would often alight and feed\r\nin the immediate presence of the men, and would even permit a very\r\nnear approach. During the winter they were frequently to be met with\r\nbetween Fort Anderson and Fort Good Hope, in especial abundance about\r\nthe last-mentioned post. As the spring approached, they began to migrate\r\nto the north; so that in the summer scarcely a Ptarmigan was to be seen\r\nsouth of Lockhart River, on their usual line of march to that post. In\r\nFebruary, 1859, Mr. MacFarlane found them numerous to the very borders\r\nof the wooded country, along the banks of the Lower Anderson.\r\n\r\nMr. Donald Gunn states that this Ptarmigan is very seldom to be seen\r\nsouth or west of Lake Winnipeg, but is found in all the country north\r\nand east of that lake during the winter season. In the summer they are\r\nsaid to breed around Hudson’s Bay, and during the winter to be found\r\nalong the whole extent of that bay, especially if the winter is mild.\r\nDuring severe winters they go more inland. The males of this species\r\nare said by Mr. Gunn to crow morning and evening in the same manner as\r\nthe Moor-fowl in Scotland, the tone and notes being very similar. The\r\nfemale is said to lay from ten to sixteen eggs, but the largest number\r\ntaken by Mr. MacFarlane appears to have been ten. These birds are of\r\ngreat service to the Indians, serving as food when larger game fails;\r\nand their feathers are also a considerable article of trade, several\r\nhundredweight of them being annually sent to London.\r\n\r\nMr. Dall found this Ptarmigan abundant in Alaska, from Fort Yukon to the\r\nsea. In winter they feed exclusively on willow buds, a double-handful\r\nhaving often been found in their crops. As soon as the ground was\r\nwell covered with snow they appeared on the river in coveys among the\r\nwillow-thickets. They were rather shy, and on an alarm flew immediately,\r\nbut without noise. They made regular paths along the banks of the\r\nriver among the willows, along which they always ran. The Indians took\r\nadvantage of these to snare them, and caught them by hundreds. They\r\nwere abundant in the fall and midwinter. In February they gathered in\r\nimmense flocks, and disappeared, no one could tell where, returning\r\nabout the middle of March as suddenly as they had gone away, remaining\r\na few weeks, then resorting to the mountains and open country to breed.\r\nIn 1867 they disappeared February 15 and returned April 1, leaving for\r\nthe mountains May 3. The following year they left February 10, returned\r\nMarch 21, and left for the mountains April 28, going and coming in large\r\nflocks. They begin to moult about the middle of April, the feathers of\r\nthe head, edges of wings, and upper tail-coverts, changing first. At\r\nthis time the capillaries in the skin of the abdomen become engorged\r\nwith serous fluid, and give to the bird a disgusting appearance. Mr.\r\nDall obtained eggs in an open tundra near the mouth of the Yukon in the\r\nlatter part of June. The female defended her nest bravely, and rather\r\nthan desert her eggs allowed herself to be torn to pieces by a dog.\r\n\r\nMr. Bannister was also struck with the strong attachment shown to each\r\nother by both sexes during the breeding-season. He has known the male\r\nbird to sacrifice his own life, rather than desert his wounded mate.\r\nHe mentions them as common at St. Michaels and the adjoining mainland\r\nduring the greater part of the year, but especially abundant in the\r\nspring, when they are found singly or in pairs all over the country.\r\nIn the fall and winter they kept more to the thickets of willows. The\r\ngreater part of them were supposed to have gone into the wooded district\r\nof the interior for better shelter and more abundant food.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of this species vary considerably in length and breadth; they\r\naverage about 1.85 inches in length and 1.20 in breadth, and are oval\r\nin shape, one end a little less obtuse than the other. They are all\r\nbeautifully variegated and marked with bold confluent blotches of a\r\ndark claret color, upon a ground of a deep cream tinged with a reddish\r\nshading.\r\n\r\n\r\nLagopus mutus, var. rupestris, LEACH.\r\n\r\nROCK PTARMIGAN.\r\n\r\n  _Tetrao rupestris_, GMELIN, Syst.

Those in the winter plumage that we\r\nhave examined are absolutely identical in size, proportions, and color\r\nwith the American birds.\r\n\r\nHABITS. According to Hutchins, this Ptarmigan is numerous at the two\r\nextremes of Hudson’s Bay, but does not appear at the middle settlements\r\nof York and Severn except in very severe seasons, when the Willow Grouse\r\nare scarce; and Captain Sabine informed Richardson that they abounded\r\non Melville Island, latitude 75°, in the summer. They arrived there in\r\ntheir snow-white winter dress about the 12th of May. By the end of the\r\nmonth the females had begun to assume their colored plumage, which was\r\ncompleted by the first week in June, when the change in the plumage\r\nhad only just commenced in the males. Some of the latter were found\r\nas late as the middle of June in their unaltered winter plumage. This\r\nGrouse was also found on the Melville peninsula and the Barren Grounds,\r\nrarely going farther south, even in the winter, than latitude 53° in the\r\ninterior, but, on the coast of Hudson’s Bay, descending to latitude 58°,\r\nand in severe seasons still farther to the southward. In its general\r\nmanners and mode of living it is said to resemble the _albus_, but does\r\nnot retire so far into the wooded country in the winter. At that season\r\nit frequents the more open woods on the borders of lakes, especially in\r\nthe 65th parallel, but the bulk of this species remains on the skirts of\r\nthe Barren Grounds. They incubate in June.\r\n\r\nMr. MacFarlane found this species breeding about Fort Anderson, and\r\non the Barren Grounds east of the Horton River. They nest, in a\r\nsimilar manner to _L. albus_, on the ground, placing the materials in\r\na depression on the ground, and using hay, withered leaves, and a few\r\nfeathers, and making a rather loose, ill-arranged nest. This is usually\r\nplaced on an open common, sometimes near the banks of a small stream.\r\nThey were more early in their breeding than the _albus_, as young\r\nPtarmigans of a goodly size are mentioned as having been seen June 30.\r\nThe eggs ranged from four to eight in number.\r\n\r\nThe female sits very close, and rather than leave will sometimes suffer\r\nherself to be taken by the hand. In one instance when a nest was\r\napproached, the female crouched as much as possible, in the hope that\r\nshe might not be noticed, which would have happened had not one of the\r\nparty observed her eye. Her summer plumage was almost exactly of the\r\nsame color with the soil, and hardly distinguishable from it. The man\r\nwas within three feet, and, making a swoop, caught her on the nest.\r\n\r\nExcepting in 1862, Mr. MacFarlane did not meet with any of this species\r\nwest of the Swan River, on his various journeys to Franklin Bay. Every\r\nseason, almost immediately on leaving the woods fringing Swan River,\r\nbirds began to be seen as far as and all along the Arctic coast.\r\nAlthough constantly found feeding in large numbers on the Barrens,\r\nit was always difficult to find their nests. They were most numerous\r\nbetween Horton River and Franklin Bay, and were frequently seen standing\r\nsingly, or feeding on the ground, or an occasional pair might be seen,\r\nbut it was seldom any number were observed in company.\r\n\r\nMr. Dall states that this species was not uncommon in the Romanzoff\r\nMountains, northwest of Fort Yukon, but did not know of its being found\r\nfarther south or west. It was obtained by S. Weston at Fort Yukon, and\r\namong the mountains by Mr. McDougal.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of this species closely resemble those of _L. albus_, but are\r\nsomewhat smaller in size. They measure 1.63 inches in length by 1.18\r\nin breadth, varying slightly in size. Their ground is a deep reddish\r\ncream-color, nearly covered by large blotches of a reddish-chestnut,\r\ngiving a beautifully variegated effect to the whole.\r\n\r\n\r\nLagopus leucurus, SWAINSON & RICHARDSON.\r\n\r\nWHITE-TAILED PTARMIGAN.\r\n\r\n  _Tetrao_ (_Lagopus_) _leucurus_, SW. & RICH.

Alpine summits of the Western mountains, from lat. 39° in the\r\nRocky Mountains north into British America, and west to the Cascades of\r\nOregon, Washington, and British Columbia.\r\n\r\nHABITS. This species was first procured by Mr. Drummond, and described\r\nby Swainson in the “Fauna Borealis.” Five specimens were taken on the\r\nRocky Mountains in the 54th parallel, and another, by Mr. MacPherson,\r\non the same chain, nine degrees farther north. They were said to have\r\nall the habits of the other Ptarmigans, and to inhabit the snowy peaks\r\nnear the mouth of the Columbia, as well as the lofty ridges of the Rocky\r\nMountains.\r\n\r\nWe have but little reliable information in regard to the habits and\r\ndistribution of this species. It seems to be confined entirely to the\r\nrange of the Rocky Mountains, and to be found only among their highest\r\npoints, occurring at least as far to the south as Cochetope Pass, in\r\nlatitude 39°, and extending north to an undetermined extent. Specimens\r\nwere procured in 1858 by Captain R. B. Marcy, on his march from Fort\r\nBridger, in Utah, across the Rocky Mountains to Santa Fé. They were met\r\nwith near the summit of the mountains not far from Cochetope Pass.\r\n\r\nMr. Charles E. Aiken writes me that he has been informed that this bird\r\nis common on Snowy Range, in Colorado Territory. He was informed by an\r\nold miner, who claimed to have met with these birds breeding near the\r\ntop of the range in June, that their nest, composed of leaves and grass,\r\nis placed on the ground among bushes on hillsides; that the eggs are\r\nfourteen in number, of a light bluish-brown, marked and spotted with a\r\ndarker shade of brown.\r\n\r\nMr. J. A. Allen (Am. Nat., June, 1872) mentions finding, among the\r\nsnow-fields of the higher parts of the mountains of Colorado, this\r\nGrouse as one of the essentially Arctic species that were not met with\r\nbelow the region of snow. The Ptarmigans were quite common, and in the\r\nwinter descend into the timbered land, where a great number are killed\r\nby the miners for food.\r\n\r\nAn egg, given to Mr. Allen as a genuine egg of this species, was taken\r\non Mount Lincoln, Colorado, by Mr. Arthur Meade. It is of an oblong-oval\r\nshape, and measures, as well as its imperfect condition permitted its\r\nlength to be estimated, about 1.80 inches by 1.20 in breadth. Its ground\r\nis a deep ochraceous cream-color, marked with small rounded spots of a\r\ndeep chestnut. These are pretty uniformly sprinkled over the surface.\r\nExcept in size, it bears a close resemblance to the eggs of the European\r\n_Tetrao urogallus_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFAMILY PERDICIDÆ.—THE PARTRIDGES.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAR.

They are much smaller in size and more abundant in species.\r\nThey are widely distributed over the surface of the globe, a large\r\nnumber belonging to America, where the subfamilies have no Old World\r\nrepresentatives whatever. The head seldom, if ever, shows the naked\r\nspace around and above the eye, so common in the TETRAONIDÆ; and the\r\nsides of the toes scarcely exhibit the peculiar pectination formed by a\r\nsuccession of small scales or plates.\r\n\r\n\r\nSUBFAMILY ORTYGINÆ.\r\n\r\nCHAR. Bill stout, the lower mandible more or less bidentate on each side\r\nnear the end.\r\n\r\nThe _Ortyginæ_ of Bonaparte, or _Odontophorinæ_ of other authors, are\r\ncharacterized as a group by the bidentation on either side of the edge\r\nof lower mandible, usually concealed in the closed mouth, and sometimes\r\nscarcely appreciable. The bill is short, and rather high at base;\r\nstouter and shorter than what is usually seen in Old World Partridges.\r\nThe culmen is curved from the base; the tip of the bill broad, and\r\noverlapping the end of the lower mandible.

Legs developed, the toes reaching considerably beyond the\r\ntip of the tail; the lateral toes short, equal, their claws falling\r\ndecidedly short of the base of the middle claw.\r\n\r\nThe genus _Ortyx_ embraces numerous species, more or less resembling the\r\nwell-known Bob-white of the United States. They are chiefly confined\r\nto Mexico, Central America, and the West India Islands. North America\r\nand the West India Islands contain but one species, and this is so\r\nexceedingly variable in plumage that it is only at extreme points of its\r\nrange that differences acquire sufficient constancy to be considered\r\nworthy of especial notice. The regions of its extremes of variation are\r\nthe northeastern, southeastern, and southwestern limits of its range;\r\nthe modifications attaining in Cuba and in Texas sufficient value to\r\nhave been deemed of specific importance. But comparing even the three\r\nextremes of plumage, the differences are found to consist only in a\r\nvarying amount of the several colors, specimens from intervening regions\r\nforming the connecting links.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =22248= ½\r\n\r\n_Ortyx virginianus._]\r\n\r\n\r\nSpecies and Varieties.\r\n\r\n  =O. virginianus.= Head longitudinally striped, with a dark superior\r\n  and lateral stripe, a light superciliary stripe (continuing down the\r\n  side of the neck), and a light gular patch; these stripes blackish and\r\n  pure white in the male, and rusty and ochraceous in the female.

The size is scarcely greater,—the range\r\nin Florida birds being wing 4.10 to 4.30, while the average of Missouri\r\nand Southern Illinois series is about 4.25; again, in northern and\r\neastern specimens the wing is 4.70 to 4.80. In colors, Southern Illinois\r\nand Florida birds are also very similar; but in Florida there is less\r\ntendency to black blotches on scapulars, etc., while in specimens from\r\nthe southern part of the peninsula the bill is appreciably larger. From\r\nthe plains of Kansas specimens are intermediate between these Illinois\r\nbirds and the var. _texanus_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Ortyx virginianus._]\r\n\r\nA pair of Quails from Jamaica, probably derived from Continental\r\nparents, are less different from United States specimens than are those\r\nfrom Cuba or Texas. In size they are like the former, and have also\r\nan equally large bill; the male, however, is not darker beneath than\r\nSouthern specimens of _virginianus_, while the female is absolutely\r\nundistinguishable in color from examples of that race from the Middle\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nHABITS. The present species, known in New England and in certain other\r\nparts of the country as the Quail, and in the Middle and Southern States\r\nas the Partridge,—either of which names, belonging to other and quite\r\ndifferent birds, is inappropriate,—is found throughout the eastern\r\nportion of North America from Florida to Maine, and from the Atlantic\r\nto Texas on the south and to the Central Plains. Partially successful\r\nattempts have been made to introduce it in Utah, and its area promises\r\nto extend much farther west than its original limits. This species has\r\nalso been acclimated in Jamaica, and now abounds in all parts of that\r\nisland. There they are said, by Mr. March, to make no nest, but to lay\r\non the ground, in tufts of grassroots or under clumps of bushes, usually\r\nfrom twelve to twenty eggs. These are smaller than with us, measuring\r\n1.25 inches by an inch. Mr. March adds that, during incubation, the male\r\nmay usually be found sitting on a low branch in the vicinity of the\r\nnest, but does not assist in incubation.\r\n\r\nThe Quail has also been introduced into the island of St. Croix, and is\r\nnow very common in almost every part of it, being especially abundant\r\nin the grass lands of the southwestern part. Their habits appear to be\r\nsomewhat modified by their place of abode, as Mr. Newton has several\r\ntimes seen birds of this species fly up from the ground when flushed,\r\nand perch upon trees. He also states that, so far as he could find,\r\ntheir nest is never covered over, as described by some writers, but\r\nconsists merely of a shallow hole scraped in the ground, in which is\r\ndeposited a little dried grass or “trash,” the leaves of the sugar-cane.\r\nIt is often placed to leeward of a protecting cane “stool.”\r\n\r\nThis bird is probably found in all the New England States, though its\r\npresence in Maine is not certain, and, if found there at all, is only\r\nmet with in the extreme southwestern portion. It is also rare in Vermont\r\nand New Hampshire, and only found in the southern portions. It is not\r\ngiven by Mr. Boardman, nor by Professor Verrill. Farther west it has\r\na more northern distribution, being found in Northern New York and in\r\nSouthern Canada. Mr. McIlwraith gives it as resident in the neighborhood\r\nof Hamilton.\r\n\r\nIn many parts of Massachusetts the Quail has become a very rare bird,\r\nowing to the ravages caused by sportsmen and the severity of winters,\r\nheavy falls of snow being frequently particularly fatal to them.\r\n\r\nThe Quails are not migratory, rarely moving to any extent from the\r\nspot where they were hatched, even in quest of food, and are easily\r\naffected by scarcity of food or by the severity of the winter season.\r\nIn heavy falls of snow they frequently huddle together on the ground,\r\nand allow themselves to be buried in the drifts. If the snow is light,\r\nthey can easily extricate themselves, and run over its surface in quest\r\nof berries and the seeds of shrubs; but if the fall be followed by a\r\npartial thaw, and a crust forms, the birds are made prisoners within its\r\nimpenetrable cover, and miserably perish of hunger. In the severe winter\r\nof 1866 and 1867, large numbers of Quails thus perished throughout\r\nall parts of Massachusetts. When the snow melted, they were found, in\r\nnumerous instances, crowded close together and embedded in the frozen\r\ndrifts.\r\n\r\nUnlike most birds of this family, the American Quail never collects\r\nin large flocks, but usually moves in small family groups, varying in\r\nnumber from ten to thirty, but too often reduced to a mere remnant by\r\nthe inroads of the sportsman. When there are two broods in a season,\r\nthe second brood unites with the first, and, if unmolested, they keep\r\ntogether until the spring, under the guidance of the parents. In the\r\nmating-season they usually separate into pairs, though occasionally\r\na male will associate with more than a single female, in which case\r\ntheir joint product is united in the same nest. In the spring of 1850 I\r\nfound one of the nests which contained no less than thirty-two eggs. The\r\nnest was placed on the side of a hill, in an open pasture, within a few\r\nrods of the main street, and in the midst of the principal village in\r\nHingham. It was comparatively small, composed of coarse stems of grass,\r\narched at the top, with the entrance on one side, and the eggs were\r\npromiscuously piled one upon another. The latter were removed for the\r\npurpose of ascertaining the exact number, but very carefully replaced;\r\nyet the parent birds deserted them, as they are said always to do if\r\ntheir eggs are handled. An attempt was made to hatch the eggs under a\r\ncommon Hen, but it proved unsuccessful. As the nest was in so exposed a\r\nplace, it is quite possible that its abandonment by the parent may have\r\nbeen occasioned by other causes than our touching the eggs.\r\n\r\nThese birds are always found in grounds more or less open, preferring\r\nthose in which there is abundance of low trees and clusters of shrubs\r\nin which they can shelter themselves, on the edges of woods, where\r\nthey occasionally hide or roost on low branches near the ground. Their\r\nfavorite food is seeds of various plants, and berries; and in the fall\r\nof the year, or late in summer, they feed largely on grasshoppers, and\r\non this food they thrive and become very fat. They are also very fond\r\nof buckwheat, corn, and all the kinds of grain. In confinement they\r\neat beechnuts, acorns, and other kinds of nuts, if broken for them.\r\nIn villages where they are not molested they become very tame, freely\r\napproach the barnyards to feed with the poultry, and will even come\r\nat the call of their friends and pick up food thrown to them. This is\r\nespecially noticeable in Florida, where the representatives of the\r\nsmall race of the species found there are very numerous and remarkably\r\nconfiding.\r\n\r\nThe Quail is esteemed a great delicacy as an article of food, and\r\nis sought for the market by means of traps, nets, and various kinds\r\nof snares, and by sportsmen with the gun and dogs. It is naturally\r\nunsuspicious, is easily approached, and in the thickly settled parts\r\nof the country its ranks are already greatly thinned. It is gradually\r\ndisappearing from New England, and is now very rare in large tracts\r\nwhere it was once quite abundant. In some localities they have only\r\nbeen retained by the importations of others from a distance. They are\r\nof gentle disposition, are apparently much attached to each other both\r\nin the conjugal and in the parental relations, and always keep closely\r\ntogether in the small flocks associating together. In the fall the\r\nold birds remain with their offspring of the season, and direct the\r\nmovements of their family. They always keep close together, by day as\r\nwell as by night, roost on the ground under the shelter of bushes in\r\na circle, their bodies closely impacted, and their heads forming the\r\nexterior. This conduces alike to their safety and to their warmth.\r\n\r\nLate in April or early in May they construct their nests, always on the\r\nground, usually under the protection of some cluster of bushes, in a\r\ndepression. It is often on the slope of a small eminence. It is very\r\nsimple, the materials loosely put together, and wholly of coarse stubble\r\nor straw. All that I have seen have been arched over at the top, and\r\nwith a partially covered entrance; but I am told that it is as often\r\nopen as covered. The eggs are spoken of in the books as from fifteen to\r\ntwenty. I have never found less than twenty-four, and from that number\r\nto thirty-two. I think that each female lays but about eight, and that\r\nseveral females make use of the same nest,—never less than two, nor more\r\nthan four. But this opinion is conjectural rather than ascertained. They\r\nhave two broods in a season, the second in August, at which time the\r\nmale is engaged in leading the first brood, of which he takes charge\r\nwhen they are hardly half grown. He is a courageous, watchful, and\r\ndevoted guardian. Once as I was rapidly descending a path on the side\r\nof a hill, among a low growth of scrub-oak I came suddenly upon a covey\r\nof young Quail, feeding on blueberries, and directly in the path. They\r\ndid not see me until I was close upon them, when the old bird, a fine\r\nold male, flew directly towards me and tumbled at my feet as if in a\r\ndying condition, giving at the same time a shrill whistle, expressive\r\nof intense alarm. I stooped and put my hand upon his extended wings,\r\nand could easily have caught him. The young birds, at the cry of the\r\nparent, flew in all directions; and their devoted father soon followed\r\nthem, and began calling to them in a low cluck, like the cry of the\r\nBrown Thresher. The young at this time were hardly more than a week old,\r\nand seemed to fly perfectly well to a short distance. The female was\r\nnowhere to be seen, but may have been previously killed, or may have\r\nbeen already in her second incubation at that early stage. The young\r\nrun as soon as they are hatched, and from the first aid their flight\r\nwith their wings; when pursued, I have never known them to squat in the\r\nmanner of the Ruffed Grouse, but rather to hide themselves in thick\r\nbushes or tufts of grass, running from these if discovered.\r\n\r\nThe male bird has a loud, clear, and very distinctive whistle, which\r\nin New England is interpreted as _No more wet_, or, if his utterance\r\nis more hurried and excited, as _More wet_; and there are those who\r\nstill attach to these utterances a meteorological significance. In\r\nother parts of the country this cry is supposed to be _Ah Bob-white_,\r\nor _Bob-white_, and the birds are not unfrequently called Bob-Whites, a\r\nname suggested by Professor Baird as a good specific designation. Their\r\nnote when calling their young brood is very different, and is a low\r\ntwitter, suggestive of affection, caution, and gentle care. It is soft\r\nand subdued, and would readily escape notice.\r\n\r\nThey make a loud whirring sound when they take to flight, but they\r\nrarely fly to any distance, even when most alarmed, as their flight\r\nis somewhat laborious. They often escape by running on the ground,\r\nespecially when they are not suddenly startled.\r\n\r\nMr. Audubon states that at the West this bird performs occasional\r\nmigrations towards the southeast in October, in the manner of the Wild\r\nTurkey; but I cannot find that others have noticed this occurrence. In\r\nthe Southern and Western States, where this species is very plentiful,\r\nthey are taken in immense numbers in large nets, into which they are\r\ncautiously and slowly driven by a party of hunters.\r\n\r\nThis species, with proper pains, may be easily raised in confinement,\r\ninduced to breed, and trained into a condition of partial domestication.\r\nRev. Dr. Bachman, of Charleston, S. C., succeeded in obtaining, by\r\nhatching under a Bantam Hen, a brood of young Quails. Confining them\r\nwith their foster-mother for a few days, they were soon taught to follow\r\nher like young chickens. They were fed at first on curds, but soon began\r\nto eat cracked Indian-corn and millet. They were permitted to stray at\r\nlarge in the garden, one wing of each having been shortened. They became\r\nvery gentle, and were in the habit of following Dr. Bachman through\r\nhis house, seating themselves on the table at which he was writing,\r\noccasionally, in play, pecking at his hands or running off with his pen.\r\nAt night they nestled in a coop in the garden. Although these pets had\r\nno opportunity of hearing any other sounds than those of the poultry,\r\nthe male birds commenced in the spring their not unmusical note of\r\n_Bob-white_, at first low, but increasing in loudness, until they were\r\nheard through the whole neighborhood. Their notes were precisely like\r\nthose of the wild birds. As the spring advanced the males became very\r\npugnacious, and continued contests took place among themselves, as well\r\nas with the Pigeons and the poultry that intruded on their premises.\r\nTheir eggs were placed under a Hen and hatched out. The experiment went\r\nno further, but was quite sufficient to demonstrate the possibility of\r\ntheir domestication.\r\n\r\nWilson relates that in one instance a female of this species set upon\r\nand hatched out the eggs of the common Hen. For several weeks after, his\r\ninformant occasionally surprised her in various parts of the plantation\r\nwith her brood of chickens, on which occasion she exhibited every\r\nindication of distress and alarm, and practised her usual manœuvres for\r\ntheir preservation. She continued to lead them about until they were\r\nlarger than herself, and their manners had all the shyness and timidity\r\nand alarm of young Quails.\r\n\r\nMr. Allen states (Am. Nat., July, 1872) that this species has been\r\nrecently introduced into the Great Salt Lake Valley, and in 1871\r\nwas giving promise of multiplying rapidly and becoming thoroughly\r\nnaturalized, young birds having been raised in the summer of 1871.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of this species are of a pure, brilliant white color, sharply\r\npointed at one end, and obtusely rounded at the other. They average\r\nabout 1.35 inches in length by one inch in breadth.\r\n\r\n\r\nOrtyx virginianus, var. texanus, LAWRENCE.\r\n\r\n  _Ortyx texanus_, LAWRENCE, Ann. N. Y. Lyc.

This form, which appears to be confined to the southern portion\r\nof Texas and to the valley of the Rio Grande River, was first described\r\nby Mr. Lawrence in 1853. It has been taken in the neighborhood of San\r\nAntonio and on the Nueces River by Captain Pope; on Devil’s River by\r\nMajor William H. Emory; at Fort Clark, on the Pecos River, near Laredo,\r\nTexas, at Matamoras, and near New Leon, Mexico, and in other localities,\r\nby Lieutenant Couch. According to Mr. Clark, they were very abundant in\r\nthe valley of the Pecos, as well as in all Southwestern Texas. They were\r\nmuch like the common Virginia Quail in habits as well as in appearance,\r\nand to his ear the note of this bird was absolutely identical with that\r\nof the common Quail. He has often been a spectator of fights among\r\nthe males of this variety. To this account Dr. Kennerly adds that he\r\nobserved them everywhere in considerable numbers from the coast to\r\nthe headwaters of Devil’s River, and also along the Pecos River; but\r\nfarther west than this none were seen. In the open prairie lands great\r\nnumbers were always found early in the morning in the road. The close\r\nresemblance of its habits to those of the common Partridge was also\r\nnoticed.\r\n\r\nThis Quail was first observed by Dr. Heermann in abundance on the Pecos\r\nRiver, although seen some days previous to reaching that point. Their\r\nnumbers increased as they neared civilization, and near San Antonio they\r\nbecame very plentiful. The call of the male bird is said to consist\r\nof two notes repeated at intervals, which are less loud, clear, and\r\nringing than those of the common _Ortyx virginianus_. They feed on the\r\nopen prairies on grass-seeds, grains, berries, and insects, and, if\r\nalarmed, take refuge among the scattered mesquite-trees and clumps of\r\nbushes. When hunted, they lie to the dog in the manner of the common\r\nspecies, and, if flushed, fly in a direct line, with a loud whirring\r\nnoise, caused by the shortness and rapid motions of the wings. An egg of\r\nthis bird, found by Dr. Heermann dropped upon the road, was in form and\r\ncolor like that of the common Quail, but smaller.\r\n\r\nMr. Dresser states that in Texas this bird is known as the “Common\r\nPartridge” of the country. He found it abundant everywhere in localities\r\nsuitable to its habits. Near Matamoras it was very common, and was\r\nthe only species of Quail he noticed there. At Eagle Pass and Piedras\r\nNegras, where the soil is sandy, the grass scanty, and cacti abundant,\r\nhe saw only one bevy, but plenty of the _Callipepla squamata_. Near San\r\nAntonio only this Quail is found, nor did he observe any other species\r\nin travelling towards the northeast. Amongst the Bandara Hills, where\r\nhe met with the Massena Partridge, he also found the Texan Quail in\r\nthe valley and near the maize-fields. In travelling from Brownsville\r\nto San Antonio the Texan Quail was everywhere abundant except in the\r\nsand-deserts. This species was found to be rather irregular as to its\r\nbreeding-season, as he found young birds near Matamoras early in July,\r\nand in September again met with quite young birds near the Nueces\r\nRiver, and Dr. Heermann informed him that he had likewise procured eggs\r\nnear San Antonio late in September. He obtained a set of their eggs\r\ntaken near San Antonio, which are very similar to those of the _Ortyx\r\nvirginianus_, but are slightly smaller.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS OREORTYX, BAIRD.\r\n\r\n  _Oreortyx_, BAIRD, Birds of N.

Nevada\r\n(eastern slope and foot-hills of the Sierra Nevada; RIDGWAY).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =3935= ♂\r\n\r\n_Oreortyx pictus._]\r\n\r\nThere are two quite different races of this species, but which, however,\r\npass gradually into each other, and must be considered as merely the\r\nextremes of one species. They may be defined as follows:—\r\n\r\n  1. Var. _pictus_. Pure ash confined to the pectoral region; the\r\n  russet-brown or rusty-olivaceous of the upper parts covering whole\r\n  neck and crown; forehead entirely ashy. ♂. Wing, 5.25; tarsus shorter\r\n  than middle toe (1.27; middle toe, 1.30). _Hab._ Washington Territory,\r\n  Oregon, and upper coast region of California.\r\n\r\n  2. Var. _plumiferus_. Pure ash covering whole pectoral region, and\r\n  crown, nape, and upper part of back; the grayish-olivaceous above\r\n  confined to the posterior parts. Forehead distinctly whitish. Wing,\r\n  5.25; tarsus longer than middle toe (1.27; middle toe, 1.25). _Hab._\r\n  Sierra Nevada, and Southern California to Cape St. Lucas.\r\n\r\nHABITS. The Mountain Quail of California is said by Dr. Newberry to\r\nbe similar in some respects to the common Partridge of Europe. It\r\nis nowhere very common, but occurs sparingly throughout the entire\r\nlength of California and Oregon to at least the Columbia, and probably\r\nbeyond it, having much the same range with the _californicus_, though\r\neverywhere a rarer bird, and always confined to the hills and mountains.\r\nIts habits are similar to those of the other species of this family,\r\nbut it is less gregarious, and is more shy. It is usually found in the\r\nchaparral, where it is put up with difficulty, as it seeks safety by\r\nrunning on the ground rather than by flight. On the first of August, at\r\nthe base of Lassen’s Butte, Dr. Newberry found a solitary hen with a\r\nbrood of very young chicks. The brood scattered like young Partridges,\r\nuttering a piping note like that of young chickens, and when all was\r\nstill again were recalled by the mother with a _cluck_, much like the\r\ncall of the common Hen. The party frequently saw coveys and broods\r\nof these birds, the young of which were about half grown, until they\r\nreached the plains of Pit River. None were seen in the Klamath Lake\r\nbasin, the country being too bare and flat. They were again met with\r\namong the hills bordering the Willamette Valley, and were found from the\r\nColumbia, almost uninterruptedly through the Siskiyou, Calapooza, and\r\nTrinity Mountains to California. They are favorite pets with the miners,\r\nby whom they are frequently kept in confinement, and not unfrequently\r\ncommand a high price. Their flesh is said to be white and excellent, and\r\nfully equal to that of any of the family.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Oreortyx pictus._]\r\n\r\nAccording to Dr. Cooper, this Quail is very rare in Washington\r\nTerritory, a few small coveys having been met with about Vancouver, as\r\nhe was informed by the officers in the garrison. He never succeeded\r\nin finding any, though he hunted for them several times with a dog.\r\nThey became quite common south of the Columbia, towards the prairies\r\nof the Willamette. He inquired especially for them in other parts\r\nof the Territory, but never heard of them. In California, south\r\nof San Francisco, this bird is said to be a rare curiosity to the\r\nmarket-hunters, one or two sometimes occurring among flocks of the\r\nCalifornia Quail. It is known to them as the Mountain Quail. Dr. Suckley\r\nstates that the birds in the Willamette Valley were introduced there,\r\nand that they are now multiplying rapidly upon the prairies back of\r\nFort Vancouver. With a very little care it is thought the whole of the\r\nTerritory may become well stocked with them, as the absence of foxes\r\nwest of the Cascade Mountains and the mild open winters are favorable\r\nfor their increase.\r\n\r\nDr. Heermann found the birds of this species wild and difficult to\r\nprocure, flying and scattering at the least symptom of danger, and again\r\ncalling each other together with a note expressive of great solicitude,\r\nmuch resembling that of a Hen-Turkey gathering her brood around her.\r\nDuring the survey he observed these birds only once, and then but for\r\na few minutes, as they were passing through a deep cañon leading down\r\nto Elizabeth Lake. They were seen by the hunters on the mountains\r\nsurrounding Tejon Valley; but though he went several times in search of\r\nthem, he obtained none.\r\n\r\nMr. Ridgway met with the Mountain Quail on the foot-hills of the Sierra\r\nNevada, in the vicinity of Genoa and Carson City, and also in the\r\nmountain-ranges lying immediately to the eastward of the Sierra. It was\r\nquite rare and very difficult to discover, and when found was generally\r\nmet with accidentally. He obtained it in November in the thick chaparral\r\nat the eastern base of the Sierra Nevada. In May he secured a pair in\r\nthe cedar woods a little to the eastward of Carson City, and in December\r\na flock was met with on the Comstock Mountains near Pyramid Lake. Its\r\ncall-note when a flock is scattered is almost exactly like that of a\r\nHen-Turkey, only proportionally weaker. When a flock is startled, they\r\nutter a confused chuckling note, something like that of the common\r\neastern Quail. The male has a very pleasant crowing-note, which sounds\r\nsome like _koo-koo-koóe_. The settlers in Nevada say that, previous to\r\nthe settlement of that country by the whites, this Quail was not found\r\neast of the Sierra Nevada, and affirm that they followed the wagon-roads\r\nover the mountains, in the rear of trains and wagons, for the purpose of\r\npicking up the grain scattered along the road. Mr. Ridgway does not give\r\nfull credit to the truth of these statements, as he was informed by the\r\nIndians at Pyramid Lake, that, within the memory of the oldest members\r\nof their tribe, it had always been found in that vicinity.\r\n\r\nAn egg of this species taken by Dr. Canfield, near Monterey, California,\r\nmeasures 1.45 inches in length by 1.10 in breadth. It is oval in shape;\r\none end is considerably more pointed than the other. It is of a very\r\nrich cream-color, with a reddish shading, and unspotted.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =9390= ♂\r\n\r\n_Lophortyx californicus._]\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS LOPHORTYX, BONAPARTE.\r\n\r\n  _Lophortyx_, BONAP.

Valley portions and foot-hills of the Pacific Province of the\r\nUnited States, south to Cape St. Lucas.\r\n\r\nHABITS. This beautiful species, according to Dr. Newberry, is called the\r\nValley Quail in California, to distinguish it from the Plumed Quail,\r\nwhich inhabits the hills and the highlands, and is called the Mountain\r\nQuail. The common Valley Quail of California inhabits the prairies and\r\nthe grain-fields of the cultivated districts, and frequents the thickets\r\nwhich border the streams, usually in coveys of from a dozen to a hundred\r\nindividuals, except during the breeding-season, when it is found only in\r\npairs. Like the eastern Quail, the male bird is very fond of sitting on\r\nsome stump or log projecting above the grass and weeds which conceal his\r\nmate and nest or brood, and, especially in the early morning, uttering\r\nhis peculiar cry,—whistle it can hardly be called. This note is spoken\r\nof as being rather harsh and disagreeable than otherwise, and somewhat\r\nresembling that of some of the Woodpeckers. Dr. Newberry adds that it\r\nmay be represented by the syllables _kûck-kûck-kûck-kā_, the first\r\nthree notes being rapidly repeated, the last prolonged with a falling\r\ninflection. As a game bird he regards this Quail as inferior to the\r\neastern one, though of equal excellence for the table. It does not\r\nlie so well to the dog, does not afford as good sport, and takes to a\r\ntree much more readily than the eastern Quail. It is found in all the\r\nvalleys of California and Oregon, both those in the interior and those\r\nthat open on the coast. It is not found in the deep forests, nor on\r\nthe mountains at any considerable elevation, nor in the interior basin\r\nwhere water and vegetation are scarce. Specimens were taken by his\r\nparty in different parts of the Sacramento Valley, at Fort Jones, and\r\nin the Willamette Valley, near the Columbia. In all these there was no\r\nappreciable difference. This bird is said to make no elaborate nest, but\r\nto lay a large number of eggs on the ground, which are generally hatched\r\nin June. This bird is susceptible of domestication, and forms quite an\r\nornament for parks, in which they thrive with proper care.\r\n\r\nDr. Suckley states that this Quail was successfully introduced into\r\nWashington Territory, on the prairies near Puget Sound, in the spring\r\nof 1857, by Governor Charles H. Mason and Mr. Goldsborough. Two lots\r\nwere introduced, and by the following winter had increased largely. Mr.\r\nGibbs mentions having met with great numbers of these birds on Russian\r\nRiver in 1851, and again on the Klamath in 1852. They were very tame,\r\nbut took to the bushes when disturbed, perching on the limbs. Like the\r\nSharp-tailed Grouse, they gathered in large flocks. This was the case\r\neven when young, and it has been thence inferred that several females\r\nbelong to one male, and with their broods all run together.\r\n\r\nDr. Kennerly states that his party first met with this beautiful\r\nPartridge upon reaching the waters of the Mohave River, and during the\r\nmarch up the stream he found it very abundant, as well as among the\r\nsettlements along the coast. He could perceive no difference in its\r\nhabits from those of _Lophortyx gambeli_.\r\n\r\nDr. Heermann states that he found the California Quail very numerous\r\nas far south as Vallecita, where commences the desert that extends\r\nto the Colorado, forming an apparently impassable barrier between it\r\nand the closely allied species, Gambel’s Partridge. When flushed from\r\nthe ground, it invariably flies to the trees, if in a wooded country,\r\nwhere it squats so closely lengthwise on a branch that it can rarely\r\nbe seen when thus hidden. It will not lie to a dog, but runs until it\r\nis forced to fly. It may be readily tamed, and in California is often\r\ndomesticated with the poultry. Several years since, according to Dr.\r\nHeermann, an attempt was made to introduce these birds into Long Island,\r\nwhich at first promised to be successful; but unfortunately, after the\r\nfirst season, they were all exterminated by the gunners for the New York\r\nmarket.\r\n\r\nMr. Ridgway met with this species only on the west slope of the Sierra\r\nNevada, and at an altitude of not more than four or five thousand feet.\r\nHe had no opportunity to learn anything in regard to its habits, but\r\nwas enabled to listen to its notes. The call-note of the male is very\r\npeculiar, and resembles somewhat the syllables _kuck-kuck-kēē_, the\r\naccent being on the last syllable. The common note of the male bird,\r\nwhen disturbed with its mate in the bushes, and probably having a brood\r\nof young in the vicinity, was a sharp _pit_, precisely like the common\r\nnote of the Cardinal Grosbeak.\r\n\r\nThe nest of this bird is made in the open field, or at the foot of a\r\nbush, and is composed of loose grasses arranged without much care. The\r\neggs are said to be twelve or sixteen in number, and are yellowish or\r\ngrayish white, spotted and dashed with dark brown or burnt-umber.\r\n\r\nMr. Titian R. Peale, in his Notes on the Wilkes expedition, mentions\r\nobserving this species in the mountainous regions of Southern Oregon,\r\nnear the 43d degree of north latitude, which he regarded as their\r\nfarthest northern range. He frequently observed them collecting at night\r\nto roost in trees. At such times their call-note was plaintive, and\r\nhad a slight resemblance to the words _cut-cut-cut-me-too_. Specimens\r\nof this bird were taken alive, kept by members of the expedition, and\r\nbrought to the city of Washington by a route equal to the circumference\r\nof the globe, where they produced one brood of young.\r\n\r\nSoda Lake, the “sink” of the Mohave River, the bed of which is usually\r\nquite dry, except in spots, for many miles, is said by Dr. Coues to be\r\njust where this species and the _L. gambeli_ find a neutral ground, the\r\nwestern bird following the watercourses until arrested by the desert.\r\n\r\nMr. Xantus found this Quail breeding in great abundance at Cape St.\r\nLucas. In one instance he found four eggs on the bare sand, under a\r\npile of driftwood, without any trace of a nest. In another, three eggs\r\nwere found on the bare ground, under a fallen cactus. In a third case\r\nthere were nine eggs, also laid on the bare ground, but in the shade\r\nof a jasmine-bush. They were frequently found sheltered under piles of\r\ndriftwood.\r\n\r\nThe eggs of this Quail are subject to great variations in marking, and\r\nalso differ somewhat in size. They are sharply pointed at one end and\r\nrounded at the other. One egg, measuring 1.30 in length by 1.00 in\r\nbreadth, has a ground-color of a creamy white, freckled with markings of\r\na uniform shading of an olivaceous-drab. Another, measuring 1.22 by .91\r\ninches, has the ground-color of the same, but the markings are larger\r\nand more confluent, and their color is a rusty drab. A third is 1.18 by\r\n.95 inches; ground-color a creamy white marked by large scattered spots\r\nof a chestnut-brown.\r\n\r\n\r\nLophortyx gambeli, GAMBEL.\r\n\r\nGAMBEL’S QUAIL.\r\n\r\n  _Lophortyx gambeli_, “NUTTALL,” GAMBEL, P.

Colorado Valley of the United States; north to Southern Utah, and\r\neast to Western Texas.\r\n\r\nAn adult male collected in Southern Utah by Mr. Henshaw of Lieutenant\r\nWheeler’s Expedition differs from all others which we have seen,\r\nincluding a large series from the same locality, in having the abdomen\r\nchiefly plumbeous, with a few cloudings of black, in the place of a\r\nuniformly black patch. Except in this respect, however, it does not\r\ndiffer at all from other adult male specimens.\r\n\r\nHABITS. Gambel’s Partridge was obtained by Dr. Kennerly, near San\r\nElizario, Texas, and on Colorado River, California, by Mr. A. Schott,\r\nand also by Dr. Kennerly. It was not observed by Dr. Kennerly until he\r\nreached the valley of the Rio Grande, nor did he meet with any farther\r\nwest, in any part of Mexico, than San Bernardino, in Sonora. Though\r\nclosely resembling in its habits the Scaly Partridge (_Callipepla\r\nsquamata_), and in some instances occupying the same districts, he never\r\nfound the two species together.\r\n\r\nAccording to Mr. J. H. Clark, this species was not met with east of\r\nthe Rio Grande, nor farther south than Presidio del Norte. Unlike the\r\n_squamata_, it is very common for this species to sit on the branches\r\nof trees and bushes, particularly the male, where the latter is said to\r\nutter the most sad and wailing notes. They are so very tame as to come\r\nabout the Mexican towns, the inhabitants of which, however, never make\r\nany effort to capture them. They only inhabit wooded and well-watered\r\nregions, and are said to feed indifferently on insects or on berries;\r\nin summer they make the patches of _Solanum_ their home, feeding on its\r\nquite palatable fruit. When flushed, this Quail always seeks the trees,\r\nand hides successfully among the branches.\r\n\r\nDr. Kennerly found this beautiful species in great numbers during the\r\nmarch of his party up the Rio Grande. Large flocks were continually\r\ncrossing the road before them, or were seen huddled together under a\r\nbush. After passing the river he met with them again so abundantly along\r\nPartridge Creek as to give rise to the name of that stream. Thence to\r\nthe Great Colorado he occasionally saw them, but after leaving that\r\nriver they were not again seen. They are said to become quite tame and\r\nhalf domesticated where they are not molested. When pursued, they can\r\nseldom be made to fly, depending more upon their feet as a mode of\r\nescape than upon their wings. They run very rapidly, but seldom, if\r\never, hide, and remain close in the grass or bushes in the manner of the\r\neastern Quail.\r\n\r\nFrom Fort Yuma, on the Colorado River, to Eagle Springs, between El\r\nPaso and San Antonio, where he last saw a flock of these birds, Dr.\r\nHeermann states he found them more or less abundant whenever the party\r\nfollowed the course of the Gila, or met with water-holes or streams of\r\nany kind. Although they frequent the most arid portions of the country,\r\nwhere they find a scanty subsistence of grass-seed, mesquite leaves,\r\nand insects, they yet manifest a marked preference for the habitations\r\nof man, and were much more numerous in the cultivated fields of Tucson,\r\nMesilla Valley, and El Paso. Towards evening, in the vicinity of the\r\nMexican villages, the loud call-notes of the male birds may be heard,\r\ngathering the scattered members of the flocks, previous to issuing from\r\nthe cover where they have been concealed during the day. Resorting to\r\nthe trails and the roads in search of subsistence, while thus engaged\r\nthey utter a low soft note which keeps the flock together. They are\r\nnot of a wild nature, often permit a near approach, seldom fly unless\r\nsuddenly flushed, and seem to prefer to escape from danger by retreating\r\nto dense thickets. In another report Dr. Heermann mentions finding this\r\nspecies in California on the Mohave desert, at the point where the river\r\nempties into a large salt lake forming its terminus. The flock was wild,\r\nand could not be approached. Afterwards he observed them on the Big\r\nLagoon of New River. At Fort Yuma they were quite abundant, congregating\r\nin large coveys, frequenting the thick underwood in the vicinity of the\r\nmesquite-trees. Their stomachs were found to be filled with the seeds\r\nof the mesquite, a few grass-seeds, and the berries of a parasitic\r\nplant. On being suddenly flushed these birds separate very widely, but\r\nimmediately upon alighting commence their call-note, resembling the soft\r\nchirp of a young chicken, which is kept up for some time. The alarm\r\nover, and the flock once more reunited, they relapse into silence, only\r\nbroken by an occasional cluck of the male bird. Once scattered they\r\ncannot be readily started again, as they lie close in their thick,\r\nbushy, and impenetrable coverts. Near Fort Yuma the Indians catch them\r\nin snares, and bring them in great numbers for sale.\r\n\r\nDr. Samuel W. Woodhouse first met with this species on the Rio Grande,\r\nabout fifty miles below El Paso, up to which place it was extremely\r\nabundant. It was by no means a shy bird, frequently coming about the\r\nhouses; and he very often observed the males perched on the top of\r\na high bush, uttering their peculiarly mournful calls. He found it\r\nin quite large flocks, feeding principally on seeds and berries. It\r\nbecame scarce as he approached Doña Ana, above which place he did not\r\nmeet with it again. He again encountered it, however, near the head of\r\nBill Williams River, and afterwards on the Tampia Creek, and it was\r\nexceedingly abundant all along the Great Colorado. He was informed that\r\nthey are never found west of the Coast Range, in California. About Camp\r\nYuma, below the mouth of the Gila River, they were very abundant and\r\nvery tame, coming quite near the men, and picking up the grain wasted by\r\nthe mules. They are trapped in great numbers by the Indians.\r\n\r\nThis Quail is given by Mr. Dresser as occurring in Texas, but not as a\r\ncommon bird, and only found in certain localities. At Muddy Creek, near\r\nFort Clark, they were not uncommon, and were also found near the Nueces\r\nRiver.\r\n\r\nDr. Coues (Ibis, 1866), in a monograph upon this species, describes its\r\ncarriage upon the ground as being firm and erect, and at the same time\r\nlight and easy, and with colors no less pleasing than its form. He found\r\nthem to be exceedingly abundant in Arizona, and soon after his arrival\r\nin the Territory he came upon a brood that was just out of the egg. They\r\nwere, however, so active, and hid themselves so dexterously, that he\r\ncould not catch one. This was late in July, and throughout the following\r\nmonth he met broods only a few days old. The following spring he found\r\nthe old birds mated by April 25, and met with the first chick on the\r\nfirst of June. He infers that this species is in incubation during the\r\nwhole of May, June, July, and a part of August, and that they raise two,\r\nand even three, broods in a season.\r\n\r\nA single brood sometimes embraces from fifteen to twenty young, which\r\nby October are nearly as large as their parents. While under the care\r\nof the latter they keep very close together, and when alarmed either\r\nrun away rapidly or squat so closely as to be difficult to flush, and,\r\nwhen forced up, they soon alight again. They often take to low limbs of\r\ntrees, huddle closely together, and permit a close approach. The first\r\nintimation that a bevy is near is a single note repeated two or three\r\ntimes, followed by the rustling of leaves as the flock start to run.\r\n\r\nThese birds are said to be found in almost every locality except thick\r\npine-woods without undergrowth, and are particularly fond of thick\r\nwillow copses, heavy chaparral, and briery undergrowth. They prefer\r\nseeds and fruit, but insects also form a large part of their food. In\r\nthe early spring they feed extensively on the tender fresh buds of young\r\nwillows, which give to their flesh a bitter taste.\r\n\r\nThis Quail is said to have three distinct notes,—the common cry uttered\r\non all occasions of alarm or to call the bevy together, which is a\r\nsingle mellow clear “chink,” with a metallic resonance, repeated an\r\nindefinite number of times; then a clear, loud, energetic whistle,\r\nresembling the syllables _killink-killink_, chiefly heard during the\r\npairing-season, and is analogous to the _bob-white_ of the common Quail;\r\nthe third is its love-song, than which, Dr. Coues adds, nothing more\r\nunmusical can well be imagined. It is uttered by the male, and only when\r\nthe female is incubating. This song is poured forth both at sunrise\r\nand at sunset, from some topmost twig near the spot where his mate is\r\nsitting on her treasures; and with outstretched neck, drooping wings,\r\nand plume negligently dangling, he gives utterance to his odd, guttural,\r\nenergetic notes.\r\n\r\nThe flight of these birds is exceedingly rapid and vigorous, and is\r\nalways even and direct, and in shooting only requires a quick hand and\r\neye.\r\n\r\nIn his journey from Arizona to the Pacific, Dr. Coues found these birds\r\nsingularly abundant along the valley of the Colorado; and he was again\r\nstruck with its indifference as to its place of residence, being equally\r\nat home in scorched mesquite thickets, dusting itself in sand that would\r\nblister the naked feet, the thermometer at 117° Fah. in the shade, and\r\nin the mountains of Northern Arizona, when the pine boughs were bending\r\nunder the weight of the snow. He also states that Dr. Cooper, while at\r\nFort Mohave, brought up some young Gambel’s Quails by placing the eggs\r\nunder a common Hen, and found no difficulty in domesticating them, so\r\nthat they associated freely with the barnyard fowls. The eggs, he adds,\r\nare white, or yellowish-white, with brown spots, and were hatched out in\r\ntwenty-four days. The nest is said to be a rather rude structure, about\r\neight inches wide, and is usually hidden in the grass. The eggs number\r\nfrom twelve to seventeen.\r\n\r\nCaptain S. G. French, quoted by Mr. Cassin, writes that he met with\r\nthis species on the Rio Grande, seventy miles below El Paso, and from\r\nthat point to the place named their numbers constantly increased. They\r\nappeared to be partial to the abodes of man, and were very numerous\r\nabout the old and decayed buildings, gardens, fields, and vineyards\r\naround Presidio, Isoleta, and El Paso. During his stay there in the\r\nsummer of 1851, every morning and evening their welcome call was heard\r\nall around; and at early and late hours they were constantly to be found\r\nin the sandy roads and paths near the villages and farms. In the middle\r\nof the hot summer days, however, they rested in the sand, under the\r\nshade and protection of the thick chaparral. When disturbed, they glided\r\nthrough the bushes very swiftly, seldom resorting to flight, uttering\r\na peculiar chirping note. The parents would utter the same chirping\r\ncry whenever an attempt was made to capture their young. The male and\r\nfemale bird were always found with the young, showing much affection for\r\nthem, and even endeavoring to attract attention away from them by their\r\nactions and cries.\r\n\r\nColonel McCall (Proc. Phil. Ac., June, 1851) also gives an account of\r\nthis bird, as met with by him in Western Texas, between San Antonio and\r\nthe Rio Grande River, as well as in New Mexico. He did not fall in with\r\nit until he had reached the Limpia River, a hundred miles west of the\r\nPecos, in Texas, where the _Acacia glandulosa_ was more or less common,\r\nand the mesquite grasses and other plants bearing nutritious seeds were\r\nabundant. There they were very numerous and very fat, and much disposed\r\nto seek the farms and cultivate the acquaintance of man. About the\r\nrancho of Mr. White, near El Paso, he found them very numerous, and,\r\nin flocks of fifty or a hundred, resorting morning and evening to the\r\nbarnyard, feeding around the grain-stacks in company with the poultry,\r\nand receiving their portion from the hand of the owner. He found them\r\ndistributed through the country from the Limpia to the Rio Grande, and\r\nalong the latter river from Eagle Spring Pass to Doña Ana.\r\n\r\nThe same careful observer, in a communication to Mr. Cassin, gives the\r\nwestern limit of this species. He thinks it is confined to a narrow\r\nbelt of country between the 31st and 34th parallels of latitude, from\r\nthe Pecos River, in Texas, to the Sierra Nevada and the contiguous\r\ndesert in California. It has not been found on the western side of these\r\nmountains. Colonel McCall met with it at Alamo Mucho, forty-four miles\r\nwest of the Colorado River. West of this stretches a desolate waste of\r\nsand,—a barrier which effectually separates this species from its ally,\r\nthe California Quail.\r\n\r\nThis species is known to be abundant in the country around the sources\r\nof the Gila River, and has also been found along that river from the\r\nPimo villages to its mouth, and there is no doubt that it inhabits the\r\nentire valley of the Gila. It was also common along the Colorado River,\r\nas far as the mouth of the Gila, and has been met with in that valley as\r\nhigh up as Tampia Creek, latitude 34°.\r\n\r\nColonel McCall regards this species as less wild and vigilant than\r\nthe California species. It is later in breeding, as coveys of young\r\nCalifornia Quails were seen, one fourth grown, June 4, while all the\r\nbirds of Gambel’s were without their young as late as June 16. The voice\r\nof the male at this season is described as strikingly rich and full. The\r\ncry may be imitated by slowly pronouncing in a low tone the syllables\r\n_kaa-wale, kaa-wale_. When the day is calm and still, these notes may\r\nbe heard to a surprising distance. This song is continued, at short\r\nintervals, in the evening, for about an hour. Later in the season when a\r\ncovey is dispersed, the cry for reassembling is said to resemble _qua-el\r\nqua-el_. The voice of this bird at all seasons bears a great resemblance\r\nto that of the California Quail, but has no resemblance to that of the\r\neastern _Ortyx virginiana_. In their crops were found the leaves of the\r\nmesquite, coleopterous insects, wild gooseberries, etc.\r\n\r\nAn egg of this species, taken by Dr. Palmer at Camp Grant, measures 1.25\r\ninches in length by 1.00 in breadth. The ground-color is a cream white,\r\nbeautifully marked with ragged spots of a deep chestnut. In shape it\r\nclosely corresponds with the egg of the California Partridge.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS CALLIPEPLA, WAGLER.\r\n\r\n  _Callipepla_, WAGLER, Isis, 1832. (Type, _Ortyx squamata_, VIG.)\r\n\r\nGEN.

This bird was first described as a Mexican species in 1830 by\r\nMr. Vigors. For a long while it has been an extremely rare species in\r\ncollections, and its history, habits, and distribution remained unknown\r\nuntil the explorations of the naturalists made in the surveys under\r\nthe direction of the national government. It was first noticed within\r\nthe territory of the United States by Lieutenant Abert, Topographical\r\nEngineer, who, in his Report of the examination of New Mexico, furnishes\r\nseveral notes in relation to this species. In November, 1846, he\r\nmentions that, after having passed through Las Casas, while descending\r\nthrough a crooked ravine strewed with fragments of rocks, he saw\r\nseveral flocks of this species. They were running along with great\r\nvelocity among the clumps of the kreosote plant. At the report of the\r\ngun only three or four rose up, the rest seeming to depend chiefly on\r\ntheir fleetness of foot. Their stomachs were found to be filled with\r\ngrass-seeds and hemipterous insects.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Callipepla squamata._]\r\n\r\nCaptain S. G. French, in notes quoted by Mr. Cassin, mentions meeting\r\nwith these birds, in the same year, near Camargo, on the Rio Grande.\r\nAt Monterey none were seen; but on the plains of Agua Nueva, a few\r\nmiles south of Saltillo, they were observed in considerable numbers. He\r\nafterwards met with them on the Upper Rio Grande, in the vicinity of El\r\nPaso. Though found in the same section of country with Gambel’s Quail,\r\nthey were not observed to associate together in the same flock. Their\r\nfavorite resorts were sandy chaparral and mesquite bushes. Through these\r\nthey ran with great swiftness, resorting only, when greatly alarmed by\r\na sudden approach, to their wings. They were very shy, and were seldom\r\nfound near habitations, though once a large covey ran through his camp\r\nin the suburbs of El Paso.\r\n\r\nColonel McCall (Proc. Phil. Ac. V, p. 222) mentions meeting with this\r\nspecies throughout an extended region, from Camargo, on the Lower Rio\r\nGrande, to Santa Fé. They were most numerous between the latter place\r\nand Doña Ana, preferring the vicinity of watercourses to interior\r\ntracts. They were wild, exceedingly watchful, and swift of foot, eluding\r\npursuit with surprising skill, scarcely ever resorting to flight even on\r\nthe open sandy ground. For the table they are said to possess, in a high\r\ndegree, the requisites of plump muscle and delicate flavor.\r\n\r\nIn a subsequent sketch of this species, quoted by Mr. Cassin, the same\r\nwriter gives as the habitat the entire valley of the Rio Grande,—a\r\nterritory of great extent from north to south, and embracing in its\r\nstretch between the Rocky Mountains and the Gulf of Mexico every variety\r\nof climate. This entire region, not excepting even the mountain valleys\r\ncovered in winter with deep snow, is inhabited by it. It was found by\r\nhim from the 25th to the 38th degree of north latitude, or from below\r\nMonterey, in Mexico, along the borders of the San Juan River, as high up\r\nas the Taos and other northern branches of the Rio Grande. He also found\r\nit near the head of the Riado Creek, which rises in the Rocky Mountains\r\nand runs eastwardly to the Canadian.\r\n\r\nWherever found, they are always resident, proving their ability to\r\nendure great extremes of heat and cold. In swiftness of foot, no species\r\nof this family can compete with them. When running, they hold their\r\nheads high and keep the body erect, and seem to skim over the surface of\r\nthe ground, their white plume erected and spread out like a fan.\r\n\r\nOn the Mexican side of the Rio Grande this species is found farther\r\nsouth than on the western bank, owing to the rugged character of the\r\ncountry. In Texas its extreme southern point is a little above Reinosa,\r\non the first highlands on the bank.\r\n\r\nDon Pablo de la Llave, a Mexican naturalist, states, in an account of\r\nthis species (Registro Trimestre, I, p. 144, Mexico, 1832), that he\r\nattempted its domestication in vain. In confinement it was very timid,\r\nall its movements were rapid, and, although he fed his specimens for a\r\nlong time each day, they seemed to become more wild and intractable. It\r\nwas found by him in all the mesquite regions of Northern Mexico.\r\n\r\nSpecimens of this Partridge were taken near San Pedro, Texas, by Mr.\r\nJ. H. Clark, and in New Leon, Mexico, by Lieutenant Couch. According to\r\nMr. Clark, they are not found on the grassy prairies near the coast.\r\nHe met with them on Devil’s River, in Texas, where his attention was\r\nat first directed to them by their very peculiar note, which, when\r\nfirst heard, suggested to him the cry of some species of squirrel. In\r\nthe valley of the Lower Rio Grande he also met with these birds in\r\ncompanies of a dozen or more. Their food, on the prairies, appeared\r\nto be entirely insectivorous; while on the Lower Rio Grande all the\r\nspecimens that were procured had their bills stained with the berries\r\nof the opuntia. They were not shy, and would rather get out of the way\r\nby running than by flying. At no time, and under no circumstances, were\r\nthey known to alight in bushes or in trees. They were only known to make\r\nmere scratches in the ground for nests, and their situations were very\r\ncarelessly selected. Young birds were found in June and in July.\r\n\r\nLieutenant Couch first met with this species about sixty leagues west of\r\nMatamoras, and not until free from the prairies and bottom-land. It was\r\noccasionally noticed, apparently associating with the _Ortyx texana_, to\r\nwhich it is very similar in habit.\r\n\r\nDr. Kennerly found them everywhere where there was a permanent supply of\r\nfresh water, from Limpia Creek, in Texas, to San Bernardino, in Sonora.\r\nThey were met with on the mountain-sides, or on the hills among the\r\nlow mesquite-bushes and barrea. They apparently rely more upon their\r\nlegs than upon their wings, ascending the most precipitous cliffs or\r\ndisappearing among the bushes with great rapidity.\r\n\r\nThe most western point at which Dr. Heermann observed this species was\r\nthe San Pedro River, a branch of the Gila, east of Tucson. There a flock\r\nof these birds ran before him at a quick pace, with outstretched necks,\r\nheads elevated, crests erect and expanded, and soon disappeared among\r\nthe thick bushes that surrounded them on all sides. After that they\r\nwere seen occasionally until they arrived at Lympia Springs. Lieutenant\r\nBarton informed Dr. Heermann that he had procured this species near Fort\r\nClark, one hundred and twenty miles west of San Antonio, where, however,\r\nit was quite rare. It was found abundantly on the open plains, often\r\nstarting up before the party when passing over the most arid portions\r\nof the route. They also seemed partial to the prairie-dog villages.\r\nThese, covering large tracts of ground destitute of vegetation, probably\r\noffered the attraction of some favorite insect.\r\n\r\nDr. Woodhouse met with this species on only one occasion, as the party\r\nwas passing up the Rio Grande, at the upper end of Valleverde, on the\r\nwest side of the river, on the edge of the sand-hills, feeding among the\r\nlow bushes. They were exceedingly shy and quick-footed. He tried in vain\r\nto make them fly, and they evidently preferred their feet to their wings\r\nas a means of escape. He was told that they were found above Santa Fé.\r\n\r\nMr. Dresser found this species on the Rio Grande above Roma, and between\r\nthe Rio Grande and the Nueces they were quite abundant; wherever found,\r\nthey seemed to have the country to themselves to the exclusion of other\r\nspecies. He reports them as very difficult to shoot, for the reason\r\nthat, whenever a bevy is disturbed, the birds scatter, and, running with\r\noutstretched necks and erected crests, dodge through the bushes like\r\nrabbits, so as soon to be out of reach. He has thus seen a flock of ten\r\nor fifteen disappear so entirely as to render it impossible to obtain a\r\nsingle one. If left undisturbed, they commence their call-note, which\r\nis not unlike the chirp of a chicken, and soon reunite. It was utterly\r\nout of the question to get them to rise, and the only way to procure\r\nspecimens was to shoot them on the ground. Near the small villages in\r\nMexico he found them very tame; and at Presidio, on the Rio Grande, he\r\nnoticed them in a corral, feeding with some poultry. He did not meet\r\nwith their eggs, but they were described to him, by the Mexicans, as\r\ndull white, with minute reddish spots.\r\n\r\nThe egg of the _Callipepla squamata_ is regularly oval, being much more\r\nelongated than with any other species of this family. It measures 1.35\r\ninches in length by .95 in breadth. Its ground-color is a creamy white,\r\nand its surface is minutely freckled with specks of a pale drab.\r\n\r\n\r\nGENUS CYRTONYX, GOULD.\r\n\r\n  _Cyrtonyx_, GOULD, Mon. Odontoph.? 1845. (Type, _Ortyx massena_,\r\n  LESSON.)\r\n\r\nGEN. CHAR. Bill very stout and robust. Head with a broad, soft occipital\r\ncrest of short decumbent feathers. Tail very short, half the length\r\nof the wings, composed of soft feathers, the longest scarcely longer\r\nthan the coverts; much graduated. Wings long and broad, the coverts\r\nand tertials so much enlarged as to conceal the quills. Feet robust,\r\nextending considerably beyond the tip of the tail. Claws very large, the\r\nouter lateral reaching nearly to the middle of the central anterior. The\r\ntoes without the claws, however, are very short. Sexes very different.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =3998= ♂ ½\r\n\r\n_Cyrtonyx massena._]\r\n\r\nThis genus differs very much from its North American allies in the great\r\ndevelopment of the feathers composing the wing-coverts, the very short\r\nand soft tail, and the very short toes and long claws. It is almost\r\nworthy of forming the type of a distinct subfamily, so many and great\r\nare its peculiarities. The single North American representative is the\r\nonly one of our species with round white spots on the lower surface and\r\nblack ones above.

Chiefly on the Upper Rio Grande from the high plains of the Pecos.\r\nFort Whipple, Arizona; Northern Mexico, southward, on the west coast, to\r\nMazatlan.\r\n\r\nHABITS. This Quail was first met with by Lieutenant Couch in the cañon\r\nGuyapuco, about twelve leagues south of Monterey. Though rather shy,\r\nthey seemed quite at home in the cultivated fields and stubbles of\r\nthe ranches. Mr. Clark first noticed the species among a flock of the\r\n_Ortyx texana_. Once, on flushing a covey of the latter, a bird was\r\nseen to remain behind, and showed no inclination to follow the rest.\r\nIt attempted to hide in the grass, but did not fly, and, when shot,\r\nproved to be a Massena Quail. He says they occur either in pairs or\r\nin flocks, and when once flushed fly farther than the Virginia Quail,\r\nbut do not lie so close. They may be approached within a few feet,\r\nand followed up, particularly when in pairs, running along before one\r\nlike so many domestic fowl. They are of quiet as well as of retired\r\nhabits, and a subdued though sharp note is the only noise that Mr.\r\nClark ever heard them make, and that only when frightened. He has known\r\nthem to be pursued, and all the barrels of a six-shooter fired one\r\nafter another without alarming them; and they were forced to fly at\r\nlast only by an attack of stones and clubs. He first met with them\r\nin the neighborhood of San Antonio, and found them thence sparsely\r\ndistributed as an inhabitant both of prairies and mountains as far\r\nwestward as Sonora. They are wilder than the Scaled Partridge, are\r\nless conspicuous and noisy, and are never seen in flocks, or, like\r\nthe latter, living about old camps. Their haunts are generally far\r\nremoved from the habitations of man, and the indifference they sometimes\r\nmanifest to his presence seems to be due to ignorance of the danger\r\nfrom the power of that enemy. Though distributed over the same country\r\nas the _C. squamata_, they are never found in such barren regions,\r\nalways seeming to prefer the districts most luxuriantly covered with\r\nvegetation.\r\n\r\nDr. C. B. R. Kennerly states that this bird was never seen farther south\r\nin Texas than Turkey Creek. In that vicinity it was very common, and it\r\nalso occurred at various points thence to the Rio Grande. In the valley\r\nof this river it was very rarely seen, giving way apparently to the\r\nScaly and to Gambel’s Partridge. West of the river it was very common,\r\nas far as the party travelled, wherever there was a permanent supply\r\nof fresh water. In the valley of the Santa Cruz River and among the\r\nadjacent hills it was extremely abundant. In the months of June and July\r\nit was observed there always in pairs, while in Texas, in the months of\r\nOctober and November, it was found in very large flocks, sometimes of\r\nvarious ages, from the very small and partly fledged to the full-grown\r\nbird. When hunted, they hide very closely in the grass, and Dr. Kennerly\r\nhas often known the Mexican soldiers in Sonora kill them with their\r\nlances by striking them either while on the ground or just as they rise.\r\nSome of these men were very expert in the business, and obtained a good\r\nmany in the course of a day’s travel.\r\n\r\nDr. Woodhouse met with this species a few miles above the head of the\r\nRio San Pedro, where he secured a single specimen. He was informed\r\nby Captain S. G. French that when he first passed over exactly\r\nthe same route in 1849, he met with a number of them in different\r\nlocalities,—at the head of San Pedro, Howard Springs, and also at Eagle\r\nSprings,—showing evidently that they have a range over the country lying\r\nbetween the Rio Grande and the San Pedro Rivers. He also stated that he\r\nhad never met with any near the settlements, but always among the wild,\r\nrocky, and almost barren hills of that country. They are more sociable\r\nand not so shy as the other species of this family. Their food appears\r\nto be principally insects.\r\n\r\nMr. Dresser states that this bird is locally known as the Black\r\nPartridge. For some time he sought for it near San Antonio without\r\nsuccess, but ultimately found it, in November, among the Bandera Hills.\r\nIn its habits he states it is more like the Texan Quail than any other;\r\nbut on the wing it is easily distinguished, it flies so heavily, though\r\nvery swiftly. When disturbed, they squat very close, and will not move\r\nuntil approached very closely, when they generally rise up from under\r\none’s feet. He did not meet with this Quail in any other part of Texas\r\nthan Bandera County, but was told that it is abundant in the hilly\r\ncountry at the head of the Leona, and that it is also found near Laredo.\r\n\r\nIn some remarks on the birds of Western Texas, published in the\r\nProceedings of the Philadelphia Academy in 1851, Colonel McCall gives\r\nthe first information to the public touching the habits of this\r\ninteresting species. We learn from his narrative that it was not met\r\nwith by him before crossing the San Pedro River, but that it was soon\r\nafter seen in the rocky regions into which he then entered; and thence\r\nas far as the Rio Pecos, a distance of one hundred and forty miles\r\nwestwardly, it was frequently seen, though it was not anywhere very\r\ncommon. This entire region is a desert of great extent, north and south;\r\nthe general face of the country is level, and produces nothing but a\r\nsparse growth of sand-plants. Water was found only at long intervals,\r\nand except at such points there was apparently neither food nor cover.\r\nThere, among projecting rocks or the borders of dry gullies, or in loose\r\nscrub, this bird was met with by Colonel McCall.\r\n\r\nThe habits of this species appeared to him to be different from those of\r\nany other kind of Partridge he had ever met with. They were in coveys\r\nof from eight to twelve individuals, and appeared to be simple and\r\naffectionate in disposition. In feeding they separated but little,\r\nkeeping up all the while a social _cluck_. They were so gentle as to\r\nevince little or no alarm on the approach of man, hardly moving out of\r\nthe way as they passed, and only running off or flying a few yards,\r\neven when half their number had been shot. Colonel McCall was of the\r\nopinion that they might, with very little difficulty, be domesticated,\r\nthough naturally inhabiting a barren waste nowhere near the habitation\r\nof man. The call-note is spoken of as very peculiar. The bird was not\r\nseen by his party after crossing the Pecos River. Mr. Gould, without\r\nany information in regard to the habits or economy of this species,\r\nin his Monograph of American Partridges, judging from the comparative\r\nshortness of the toes and the great development of the claws, ventured\r\nthe opinion that the habits would be found very different from those of\r\nother members of the family, which opinion is thus confirmed. Mr. Cassin\r\nthought he could trace in the circular spots, numerous in the lower\r\npart of the body, an analogy in character to the Guinea-fowls, which is\r\nfurther shown by their habit of continually uttering their notes as they\r\nfeed, and by other similarity in their manners.\r\n\r\nCaptain S. G. French, cited by Mr. Cassin, mentions meeting with this\r\nPartridge in the summer of 1846, when crossing the table-lands that\r\nextend westwardly from San Antonio, in Texas, to New Mexico. On the\r\nsides of a high rocky mountain near the summit, he observed several\r\nof them only a few feet in advance of him. They were running along\r\nover the fragments of rocks and through the dwarf bushes which grew\r\nwherever there was sufficient soil. He was attracted by their handsome\r\nplumage and their extreme gentleness. A few days after, when encamped on\r\nthe headwaters of the river, he again met with a covey, and from that\r\npoint occasionally encountered them on the route to the Pecos River, a\r\ndistance of over a hundred miles. He did not meet with them again until\r\nhe came to Eagle Springs, in a mountainous region about twenty-five\r\nmiles from the Rio Grande. In the spring of 1851, on the same route, he\r\nsaw only two of these birds, and was led to the belief that they are\r\nnot at all numerous. They appeared to inhabit the rocky sides of the\r\nmountains and hills, in the desolate region of elevated plains west\r\nof the fertile portions of Texas. In no instance did he meet with any\r\nof these birds near the settlements. Wild and rocky hillsides seemed\r\nto be their favorite resort, where trees were almost unknown and all\r\nvegetation was very scant. The coveys showed but little alarm on being\r\napproached, and ran along over the rocks, occasionally attempting to\r\nsecrete themselves beneath them. In this case they could be approached\r\nto within a few feet. When startled by the firing of a gun, they fly\r\nbut a few yards before again alighting, and exhibit but little of that\r\nwildness peculiar to all the other species of Partridge. The contents\r\nof the crop in Captain French’s specimens consisted exclusively of\r\nfragments of insects, principally grasshoppers. No trace whatever of\r\nfood of a vegetable character was found.\r\n\r\nDon Pablo de la Llave, quoted by Mr. Cassin, furnishes the following\r\naccount of the habits of this Partridge, observed by him in specimens\r\ntaken near the city of Mexico.\r\n\r\n“It is only a few days since the third species has been brought to\r\nme. It is rather smaller than the former (_C. squamata_), and its\r\ndeportment is entirely different. It carries its head habitually resting\r\non its shoulders, the neck being excessively small and deflexed, and\r\nin everything it shows an amiability, and, so to speak, kindness of\r\ncharacter (_una bondad de caracter_), which is not found in any other\r\nspecies of this genus, and it is naturally so tame and domestic as\r\nto permit itself to be caught with the hand. These birds are always\r\nunited, forming a covey, and whenever one is separated the others follow\r\nit. They do not, like others, wish to sleep on elevated places, but\r\nsit on the ground, drawing very near together. Their notes, which are\r\nnot varied, are very low and soft, and I have never heard loud cries\r\nfrom the male. When they are frightened they show much activity and\r\nswiftness; at other times their gait and movement are habitually slow\r\nand deliberate, carrying the crest puffed up (_espayada_).”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.\r\n\r\nADDITIONS AND CORRECTIONS.\r\n\r\nDuring the considerable interval of time since the printing of this work\r\nwas commenced, many additional facts have come to light in regard to the\r\nhabits and geographical distribution of the land birds of North America;\r\nand while several so-called species have proved to be mere races, or\r\neven of less rank, some others have been added to the list. The more\r\nimportant of these are herewith subjoined.\r\n\r\nMost of the new facts here announced are the results of the more recent\r\nlabors of Captain Charles Bendire, First Cavalry, U. S. A., and of\r\nMessrs. J. A. Allen, C. E. Aiken, Dr. E. Coues, H. W. Henshaw, Mr. C. J.\r\nMaynard, and others, whose names are mentioned in their appropriate\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n=Turdus pallasi=, var. =nanus= (I, 20). Dr. Cooper has sent to the\r\nSmithsonian Institution skins of his _T. nanus_, and they prove to be\r\n_T. ustulatus_. The surmise expressed on page 21, that the nest and eggs\r\ndescribed by Dr. Cooper as those of the former in reality belonged to\r\nthe latter species, is thus undoubtedly correct.\r\n\r\n=Turdus pallasi=, var. =auduboni= (I, 21). A nest with the eggs (S. I.\r\n16,320) of this species was taken near Fort Ellis, Montana, July 16,\r\n1872, by C. H. Merriam, attached to Dr. Hayden’s party. The nest is\r\nlarge and bulky for the size of the bird, is deeply saucer-shaped in\r\nform, measuring 6 inches in external diameter by 3 in depth. The cavity\r\nof the nest is 3 inches in diameter by about 1.75 deep. It is composed\r\nentirely of green mosses and lined with fine grass leaves.\r\n\r\nThe eggs were three in number, in shape broadly ovate and obtusely\r\nrounded at either end. They measure .85 of an inch in length by .72 in\r\nbreadth; their color is a rather deep greenish-blue, almost exactly like\r\nthose of _Turdus migratorius_.\r\n\r\nThe nest was built in a small pine-tree, about eight feet from the\r\nground, in the pine regions of the mountains. In its position it differs\r\nfrom any now known of the _Turdus pallasi_, which, so far as known,\r\nbuilds invariably on the ground.\r\n\r\n=Harporhynchus ocellatus= (I, 36). This is probably a Mexican form of\r\n_H. cinereus_.\r\n\r\n=Harporhynchus rufus= (I, 37). According to Mr. Allen (Bull. Mus. Comp.\r\nZoöl., Vol. III, No. 6, p. 134) this species is found on the eastern\r\nslope of the Rocky Mountains in Colorado. It is not included in the\r\n“Birds of California,” but Dr. Cooper states that in September, 1870,\r\nhe found a straggler at Clear Lake, close to the lower town. It was in\r\na thicket with its western cousins, but possessed unmistakably all the\r\ncharacteristics of the eastern bird. Unfortunately, it was not secured.\r\nAs this species is short-winged and nearly resident in many localities,\r\nits occurrence so far from its usual resort is somewhat remarkable. It\r\nhad none of the appearance of a cage-bird.\r\n\r\n=Harporhynchus curvirostris=, var. =palmeri= (I, 43). Four specimens\r\nfrom Tucson, Arizona, were recently forwarded for examination by Dr.\r\nCoues, collected by the indefatigable Captain Bendire, U. S. A., when\r\nstationed at that post. The specimens are all true _palmeri_ in the\r\ncharacters which definitely separate it from _curvirostris_, its nearest\r\nally, and show the seasonal discrepancies in the shades of color. A male\r\nand female, collected in November, differ from the types, which are\r\nsummer birds, in being of a brownish-plumbeous above, even more ashy\r\nthan in any specimens of _curvirostris_ which we have seen. In all other\r\nrespects, however, they are typical examples of var. _palmeri_, and\r\nsubstantiate the validity of this well-marked form. The measurements of\r\nthese two specimens are as follows:—\r\n\r\n  ♂. Wing, 4.50; tail, 4.90; culmen, 1.45; tarsus, 1.25; middle toe,\r\n  1.00.\r\n\r\n  ♀. Wing, 4.20; tail, 4.80; culmen, 1.40; tarsus, 1.20; middle toe,\r\n  .90.\r\n\r\nThe description of this form was first published by Dr. Coues in “Key to\r\nNorth American Birds” (October, 1872), p. 351, the type being specimen\r\nNo. 61,589, Mus. S. I.\r\n\r\n=Harporhynchus bendirei=, COUES (Am. Nat. Vol. VII, June, 1873, p. 330,\r\nfig. 69).\r\n\r\nCHAR. Nearly similar to _H. palmeri_ in color, but whiter on the breast,\r\nand apparently more ochraceous on the flanks. Much smaller than _H.\r\npalmeri_, with smaller and very differently shaped bill. _Male_ (not\r\nadult), No. 2,686, Mus. E. C. Wing, 4.10; tail, 4.50; culmen, 1.15;\r\ntarsus, 1.20; middle toe, .88. _Female_ (adult), No. 2,688, Mus. E. C.\r\nWing, 3.80; tail, 4.40; culmen, 1.15; tarsus, 1.15; middle toe, .88.\r\n\r\n_Hab._ Tucson, Arizona.\r\n\r\nThis new form Dr. Coues considers to be most nearly related to the _H.\r\ncinereus_ of Cape St. Lucas; and judging from its eggs, lately sent to\r\nthe Smithsonian Institution by Captain Bendire, such appear to be really\r\nits affinities.\r\n\r\nThe eggs sent by Captain Bendire (No. 16,486, Mus. S. I.) measure\r\n1.00 in length by .80 in breadth, and are three in number. Their\r\nground-color is a dull bluish-white, spotted with a very faint shade of\r\nreddish-brown, the spots thickest round the larger end.\r\n\r\n=Harporhynchus crissalis= (I, 47). Captain Bendire found this species\r\nbreeding abundantly near Tucson, Arizona (See COUES, Am. Nat. VI, June,\r\n1872, 370). The eggs in all instances were similar to those described as\r\nfound by Dr. Palmer, unspotted, and in size, shape, and color, hardly\r\ndistinguishable from the eggs of the common Robin (_T. migratorius_).\r\nThey are of an oblong-oval shape, rounded and nearly equal at either\r\nend, and measure 1.10 inches in length by .75 in breadth.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =3932= ⅔ ⅔\r\n\r\n_Harporhynchus redivivus._]\r\n\r\n=Harporhynchus redivivus= (I, 45). The accompanying cut, showing the\r\nextreme anatomy of the species, was omitted in its proper place.\r\n\r\n=Mimus polyglottus= (I, 49). Mr. C. E. Aiken has obtained this species\r\nin El Paso County, Colorado.\r\n\r\n=Saxicola œnanthe= (I, 60). Mr. C. J. Hampton obtained a specimen of\r\nthis bird at Junius, Seneca County, N. Y., on the 9th of September,\r\n1872. Professor Newton suggests, by letter, as an interesting problem,\r\nthe route by which this species reaches Alaska in its migrations. It\r\nis not known to occur near the Sea of Ochotsk, has not been found on\r\nthe Lower Amoor, and probably does not occur farther eastward than the\r\nBaikal Mountains. It has never been noticed in Japan or on the coast of\r\nChina. It must therefore be very nearly certain that it cannot take that\r\nway to Alaska. Sundeval states that it is found in Kamtschatka, but this\r\nMr. Newton questions, as no authority is given for this statement. The\r\nonly alternative is to assume a route _via_ Greenland, in this, perhaps,\r\nin a measure indorsing Petermann’s suggestion that Greenland extends\r\nacross the pole nearly to the Asiatic coast and to Alaska.\r\n\r\n=Sialia mexicana= (I, 65). This species has been obtained in Western\r\nIowa by Mr. Atkinson.\r\n\r\n=Regulus calendula= (I, 75). We present the outlines of bill, feet,\r\nwings, and tail, omitted in their proper place.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =28782=\r\n\r\n_Regulus calendula._]\r\n\r\n=Polioptila cærulea= (I, 78). Mr. Aiken has taken this species in El\r\nPaso County, Colorado. Dr. Cooper informs me that he found it quite\r\nnumerous near Auburn, Placer County, Cal., May 11, 1870, apparently\r\nmigrating northward. In the following December he saw one near San\r\nFrancisco. From this he infers that it winters much farther to the north\r\nin that State than it does east of the Rocky Mountains, and that the\r\nindividuals occurring in Guatemala are eastern birds. He also states\r\nthat it is the prevailing and probably the only form in all the northern\r\nand western parts of the State of California. About September 20, 1872,\r\nthis species came in great numbers to the vicinity of San Buenaventura\r\nand remained there all winter, going to the mountains northward by March\r\n20.\r\n\r\n=Polioptila melanura= (I, 81). Dr. Cooper informs me that while he found\r\n_P. cærulea_ common in September, he saw none of this species near San\r\nBuenaventura until November 12, when small parties appeared moving\r\nwestward from the colder desert regions east of the mountains. They kept\r\nentirely in the artemisia thickets among the sandy and dryest tracts,\r\nnever going into the high trees like _P. cærulea_. In form, color,\r\nrestless habits, and scolding mew, this species is said to be a perfect\r\nminiature and mimic of the Catbird.\r\n\r\nAccording to Captain Bendire the species is not common in Arizona, where\r\nhe met with three nests. “One before me, found July 25, 1872, fastened\r\nin a bunch of mistletoe, or rather suspended in it, is composed of a\r\nspecies of wild hemp fibres nicely woven together, and lined with a few\r\nfeathers and exceedingly fine grass.” The nest is very neatly made:\r\nOuter diameter, 2 inches; inner, 1.60; depth, 1.50. The number of eggs\r\nis five, ground-color pale green, with spots of light reddish-brown\r\ncolor scattered over the egg. Measurement, .50 by .40 of an inch. Their\r\nnotes are a rather harsh twitter, kept up for some time. They are active\r\nlittle birds, and are very restless.\r\n\r\n=Chamæa fasciata= (I, 84). Mr. Allen thinks that he saw this species in\r\nColorado Territory. See Am. Nat. VI, June, 1872, and Bull. Mus. Comp.\r\nZool. III, No. 6, p. 184.\r\n\r\n=Lophophanes inornatus= (I, 91). Mr. Aiken has obtained this species\r\nin El Paso County, Colorado, where it is common, while Mr. Henshaw,\r\nthe naturalist of Lieutenant Wheeler’s expedition, found it abundant\r\nin Southern Utah. These Rocky Mountain specimens are much grayer and\r\nsomewhat larger than those from California.\r\n\r\n=Parus rufescens= (I, 104). Nests and eggs of a _Parus_ which\r\nundoubtedly belong to this species were found by Mr. William A. Cooper,\r\nat Santa Cruz, Cal. One of these nests, sent to the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution, was found about four miles from Santa Cruz, April 22, 1873.\r\nThe nest was composed of moss and fine bark, largely intermingled with\r\nthe fur of rabbits and other small quadrupeds. It was built in a hole\r\nin the branch of a tree about ten feet from the ground. The branch was\r\nabout half a foot in diameter and was partially decayed. The cavity\r\nwas about a foot in length from the nest to the place where the bird\r\ngained an entrance, which was a small hole about an inch and a quarter\r\nin diameter. The eggs were seven in number and contained partially\r\nformed embryos. They measure .64 of an inch in length by .52 in breadth,\r\nresemble the eggs of the _atricapillus_, but are more sparingly marked\r\nwith spots, rather more minute and of a lighter shade of reddish-brown,\r\non a white ground.\r\n\r\n=Sitta pygmæa= (I, 120). This bird is probably a geographical form of\r\n_S. pusilla_, as suggested by Mr. Allen (Bull. Mus. Comp. Zoöl., Vol.\r\nIII, No. 6, p. 115).\r\n\r\n=Sitta pusilla= (I, 122). Young specimens collected at Aiken, S. C., by\r\nMr. C. H. Merriam, are quite different in color from the adult plumage.\r\nThe head is pale dull ashy, instead of light hair-brown, and the colors\r\nare duller generally. There is a near approach to _S. pygmæa_ in their\r\nappearance.\r\n\r\n=Campylorhynchus brunneicapillus= (I, 132). This species has been\r\ncollected at Toquerville, Southern Utah, by Mr. Henshaw, and in Southern\r\nNevada by Mr. Bischoff, naturalists to Lieutenant Wheeler’s expedition.\r\n\r\n=Salpinctes obsoletus= (I, 135). The range of this species has been\r\nremarkably extended by the capture of a specimen in Decatur County,\r\nSouthern Iowa, where others were seen, by Mr. T. M. Trippe. See Proc.\r\nBoston Soc. N. H., December, 1872, p. 236.\r\n\r\n=Catherpes mexicanus=, var. =conspersus= (I, 139). Numerous specimens\r\nobtained in Colorado by Mr. Allen and Mr. Aiken, and in Southern Utah by\r\nMr. Henshaw, establish the fact of great uniformity in the characters\r\nof this race, and its distinctness from var. _mexicanus_. On page 139\r\n“it is noticed that it is a remarkable fact that this northern race\r\nshould be so much smaller than the Mexican one, especially in view of\r\nthe fact that it is a resident bird in even the most northern parts of\r\nits ascertained habitat.” As we find this peculiarity exactly paralleled\r\nin the _Thryothorus ludovicianus_ of the Atlantic States (see below),\r\nmay not these facts point out a law to the effect that in species which\r\nbelong to essentially tropical families, with only outlying genera or\r\nspecies in the temperate zone, _the increase in size with latitude is\r\ntoward the region of the highest development of the group_?\r\n\r\nDr. Cooper met with two specimens of this species in California in\r\n1872; one about twelve miles back of San Diego, the other the same\r\ndistance back of San Buenaventura, and both at the foot of lofty, rugged\r\nmountains. Their song he compares to loud ringing laughter; it is so\r\nshrill as to be heard at quite a distance, and seems as if it must be\r\nproduced by a much larger bird.\r\n\r\n=Thryothorus ludovicianus= (I, 142). Specimens of this species from\r\nMiami, Fla., are much darker colored than those from the Middle States\r\n(Maryland, Illinois, and southward), as might be expected; but very\r\nstrangely, they are also much larger. In colors they very nearly\r\nresemble var. _berlandieri_, from the Lower Rio Grande.\r\n\r\nA specimen in Mr. Ridgway’s collection (No. 1,864, January 9), from\r\nMiami, Fla., compares with one from Southern Illinois (No. 1,652, Mt.\r\nCarmel, January, 1871) as follows:—\r\n\r\n +-----+----------------+----+-----+-----+-------+-------+-----------+\r\n | No. |    Locality.   |Sex.|Wing.|Tail.|Culmen.|Tarsus.|Middle Toe.|\r\n +-----+----------------+----+-----+-----+-------+-------+-----------+\r\n |1,864|Miami, Fla.     | ♂  | 2.75| 2.60|    .90|    .95|        .60|\r\n +-----+----------------+----+-----+-----+-------+-------+-----------+\r\n |1,652|Mt. Carmel, Ill.| ♂  | 2.45| 2.30|    .80|    .80|        .55|\r\n +-----+----------------+----+-----+-----+-------+-------+-----------+\r\n\r\nIn coloration they are more nearly alike, the Florida specimen being\r\nhardly appreciably darker on the upper surface, though the lower parts\r\nare much deeper ochraceous, almost rufous. The Illinois specimen is\r\ndeep ochraceous beneath, just about intermediate between Maryland and\r\nFlorida specimens. Another Florida specimen (No. 62,733, Mus. S. I.;\r\nC. J. Maynard) measures: wing, 2.50; tail, 2.40; culmen, .85.\r\n\r\n=Thryothorus bewicki=, var. =leucogaster= (I, 147). Specimens of this\r\nform were obtained at Toquerville, Southern Utah, in October, 1872, by\r\nMr. Henshaw, attached to Lieutenant Wheeler’s expedition.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =31045=, ♂\r\n\r\n_Troglodytes parvulus_, var. _hyemalis_.]\r\n\r\n=Troglodytes parvulus=, var. =hyemalis= (I, 155). Dr. Cooper has noticed\r\na few of these Wrens near San Buenaventura in winter, after November 10.\r\nThey probably reside in the summer in the high coast mountains lying\r\neast as well as in the Sierra Nevada. Outlines, omitted before, are here\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\n=Cistothorus stellaris= (I, 159). Mr. Henshaw obtained good evidence\r\nof this bird’s breeding at Utah Lake. Nests and eggs were found in a\r\nfarm-house, unquestionably those of this species, and said to have been\r\nobtained among the tulés or sedges along the shore of the lake. Outlines\r\nof this species are here given.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =3073=\r\n\r\n_Cistothorus stellaris._]\r\n\r\n=Anthus ludovicianus= (I, 171). Mr. Allen found this species breeding\r\nin the summer of 1871 on the summit of Mt. Lincoln, Colorado Territory,\r\nabove the timber-line, at an altitude of over 13,000 feet.\r\n\r\n=Helmitherus vermivorus= (I, 187). Professor Frank H. Snow procured a\r\nspecimen of this species near Lawrence, Kansas, May 6, 1873.\r\n\r\n=Helmitherus swainsoni= (I, 190). Was obtained in Florida by Mr. W.\r\nThaxter.\r\n\r\n=Helminthophaga virginiæ= (I, 199). Very common in El Paso County,\r\nColorado, where it was obtained by Mr. Aiken.\r\n\r\n=Helminthophaga luciæ= (I, 200). We are indebted to Captain Bendire for\r\nthe discovery of the nest and eggs of this comparatively new Warbler. He\r\nfirst met with its nest near Tucson, Arizona, May 19, 1872. Unlike all\r\nthe rest of this genus, which, so far as is known, build their nests on\r\nthe ground, this species was found nesting something after the manner of\r\nthe common Gray Creeper, between the loose bark and the trunk of a dead\r\ntree, a few feet from the ground. Except in their smaller size the eggs\r\nalso bear a great resemblance to those of the Creeper. In shape they\r\nare nearly spherical, their ground is of a crystal whiteness, spotted,\r\nchiefly around the larger end, with fine dottings of a purplish-red.\r\nThey measure .54 of an inch in length by .45 in breadth.\r\n\r\n=Helminthophaga celata=, var. =lutescens= (I, 204). See Am. Nat. Vol.\r\nVII, October, 1873, p. 606.\r\n\r\n=Helminthophaga peregrina= (I, 205). Obtained in El Paso County,\r\nColorado, in September, 1873, by Mr. Aiken.\r\n\r\n=Parula americana= (I, 208). Obtained in May in El Paso County,\r\nColorado, by Mr. Aiken.\r\n\r\n=Dendroica vieilloti=, var. =bryanti= (I, 218). See Am. Nat. VII,\r\nOctober, 1873, p. 606.\r\n\r\n=Dendroica auduboni= (I, 229). In July, 1870, Dr. Cooper found families\r\nof this species fully fledged, wandering through the woods, at the\r\nsummit pass of the Central Pacific Railroad, 7,000 feet altitude,\r\nconfirming his supposition that they breed in the high Sierra Nevada.\r\nThere they are very numerous in summer, following the retreating snow\r\nto this elevation about May 1, when the males are in full plumage,\r\nretaining it till August. Their song is always faint, and similar to\r\nthat of _D. æstiva_.\r\n\r\n=Dendroica cærulea= (I, 235). A nest, containing one egg, of the\r\nCærulean Warbler, was obtained in June, 1873, by Frank S. Booth, the\r\nson of James Booth, Esq., the well-known taxidermist of Drummondville,\r\nOntario, near Niagara Falls. The nest was built in a large oak-tree\r\nat the height of fifty feet or more from the ground. It was placed\r\nhorizontally on the upper surface of a slender limb, between two small\r\ntwigs, and the branch on which it was thus saddled was only an inch\r\nand a half in thickness. Being nine feet from the trunk of the tree,\r\nit was secured with great difficulty. The nest is a rather slender\r\nfabric, somewhat similar to the nest of the Redstart, and quite small\r\nfor the bird. It has a diameter of 2½ inches, and is 1¼ inches in depth.\r\nIts cavity is 2 inches wide at the rim, and 1 inch in depth. The nest\r\nchiefly consists of a strong rim firmly woven of strips of fine bark,\r\nstems of grasses, and fine pine-needles, bound round with flaxen fibres\r\nof plants and wool. Around the base a few bits of hornets’ nests,\r\nmosses, and lichens are loosely fastened. The nest within is furnished\r\nwith fine stems and needles, and the flooring is very thin and slight.\r\nThe egg is somewhat similar in its general appearance to that of _D.\r\næstiva_, but is smaller and with a ground-color of a different shade\r\nof greenish-white. It is oblong-oval in shape, and measures .70 of an\r\ninch in length by .50 in breadth. It is thinly marked over the greater\r\nportion of its surface with minute dottings of reddish-brown. A ring of\r\nconfluent blotches of purple and reddish-brown surrounds the larger end.\r\n\r\n=Dendroica blackburniæ= (I, 237). Obtained at Ogden, Utah, in September,\r\n1871, by Mr. Allen (Bull. Mus. Comp. Zoöl. III, No. 5, p. 166).\r\n\r\n=Dendroica dominica= (I, 240). A superb nest of the Yellow-throated\r\nWarbler was taken by Mr. Giles, near Wilmington, N. C., in the spring\r\nof 1872. The nest was enclosed in a pendent tuft of Spanish moss\r\n(_Tillandsia usneoides_), and completely hidden within it. Its form\r\nis cup-shaped, and it is made of fine roots, mixed with much downy\r\nmaterial and a few soft feathers, and, except in its situation, does not\r\ndiffer much from other nests of this genus. Other nests have since been\r\nreceived from Mr. Giles; also a nest of _Parula americana_ similarly\r\nsituated. Mr. Ridgway, from an examination of the nests, infers that\r\nthis situation is not constant, but that in other localities where the\r\nmoss is not found this Warbler may build in thick tufts of leaves near\r\nthe extremity of drooping branches, or in other similar situations.\r\n\r\n=Dendroica dominica=, var. =albilora= (I, 241). See Am. Nat, VII,\r\nOctober, 1873, p. 606.\r\n\r\n=Dendroica graciæ=, var. =decora= (I, 244). See Am. Nat. VII, October,\r\n1873, p. 608.\r\n\r\n=Dendroica castanea= (I, 251). This Warbler is cited by us as\r\nexceedingly rare in Eastern Massachusetts, though not unknown. A\r\nremarkable exception to this otherwise general rule occurred in the\r\nspring of 1872. For several days, in the latter part of May, they were\r\nfound in great abundance in the vicinity of Boston. As the same unusual\r\noccurrence of this species in large numbers was noticed by Mr. Kumlien\r\nin Southern Wisconsin, it is probable that along the 42d parallel\r\nsomething occurred to cause a deviation from their usual migrations. The\r\nlong pause of this species in its spring migrations, and its appearance\r\nin large numbers, are not known to have occurred before.\r\n\r\nMr. Salvin (Ibis, April, 1872) expresses the opinion that this Warbler,\r\nin its southern migration, does not pause in its flight from the\r\nSouthern United States to stop in any of the West India Islands, nor in\r\nany point of Central America north of Costa Rica. It is by no means rare\r\nat Panama during the winter. We may therefore infer that in both its\r\nsouthern and its northern migrations long flights are made, at certain\r\nperiods, over sections of country in which they do not appear at all, or\r\nwhere only a straggling few are ever seen, and that their abundance in\r\n1872 was exceptional and due to causes not understood.\r\n\r\n=Dendroica nigrescens= (I, 258). Obtained in El Paso County, Colorado;\r\nAIKEN.\r\n\r\n=Dendroica occidentalis=, =D. townsendi=, and =D. nigrescens= (I, 258,\r\n265, 266). While travelling over the Cuyamaca Mountains east of San\r\nDiego, in April, 1872, Dr. Cooper found _D. occidentalis_, for the first\r\ntime, quite common. They seemed to be still migrating during the last\r\nweek of April, but perhaps were only moving upwards, being numerous\r\nbetween the elevation of 1,500 and 4,000 feet, while heavy frosts still\r\noccurred at the latter height. They probably go in May as high as 6,200\r\nfeet, the summits of the highest peaks, which are densely covered by\r\nconiferous trees. _D. townsendi_ and _D. nigrescens_ were in company\r\nwith _occidentalis_ in small flocks, among the oaks, and all seemed to\r\nbe following an elevated route northward. In 1862, Dr. Cooper found them\r\namong the chaparral along the coast, but he regards this as exceptional\r\nand probably occasioned by a severe storm in the mountains, as he saw\r\nnone in 1872 in a spring of average mildness. They occur about Petaluma\r\nas early as April 1.\r\n\r\n=Seiurus ludovicianus= (I, 287). Mr. E. Ingersoll met with the nest and\r\neggs of the Large-billed Thrush near Norwich, Conn. The nest was sunk\r\nin the ground, in some moss and in the rotten wood underneath the roots\r\nof a large tree on the banks of the Yantic River. It was covered over,\r\nexcept just in front, by the roots. The nest was 2½ inches in internal\r\ndiameter and rather shallow, and was somewhat loosely constructed of\r\nfine dry grasses and little dead fibrous mosses. About the nest, but\r\nforming no part of it, were several loose leaves. These were chiefly\r\nin front of the nest, and served as a screen to conceal it and its\r\noccupant. The nest itself was placed under the edge of the bank, about\r\nten feet above the water. The eggs were four in number and were quite\r\nfresh. Unblown, they have a beautiful rosy tint, the ground-color is\r\na lustrous white, the egg having a polished surface. They are more\r\nor less profusely spotted all over with dots and specks, and a few\r\nobscure zigzag markings of reddish-brown of two shades, and umber, with\r\nfaint touches of lilac and very pale washing of red. These markings are\r\nmuch more thickly distributed about the larger end, but nowhere form a\r\nring. They resemble the eggs of _S. aurocapillus_, but differ in their\r\nsomewhat rounder shape, the brilliant polish of their ground, and the\r\ngreater distinctness of the markings. They varied from .75 to .80 of an\r\ninch in length, and from .60 to .62 in breadth.\r\n\r\n=Geothlypis= (I, 295). For a new synopsis of all the species of this\r\ngenus, see Am. Journ. Science and Arts, Vol. X, December, 1872.\r\n\r\n=Geothlypis trichas= (I, 297). Dr. Cooper found this species wintering\r\nin large numbers near San Buenaventura. They frequented the driest as\r\nwell as the wettest spots.\r\n\r\n=Geothlypis macgillivrayi= (I, 303). We now consider this form a\r\ngeographical race of _S. philadelphia_. (See Am. Journ. Science and\r\nArts, Vol. X, December, 1872.)\r\n\r\n=Myiodioctes pusillus=, var. =pileolatus= (I, 319). See Am. Nat. VII,\r\nOctober, 1873, p. 608.\r\n\r\n=Setophaga picta= (I, 322). This species, not included in the preceding\r\npages among North American Birds, was noticed on only two occasions by\r\nCaptain Charles Bendire in the vicinity of Tucson, Arizona. This was on\r\nthe 4th of April, and again on the 12th of September, 1872. He thinks\r\nthat they unquestionably breed in the mountains to the northward of\r\nTucson. When seen in September they appeared to be moving southward, on\r\ntheir way to their winter quarters. He saw none throughout the summer.\r\n(See Am. Nat. VII.) By letter from Mr. Henshaw, we learn that he has\r\nobtained this species at Apache, Arizona.\r\n\r\n=Vireosylvia olivacea= (I, 369). Obtained at Ogden, Utah, in September,\r\n1871, by Mr. Allen.\r\n\r\n=Lanivireo solitarius= (I, 373). Dr. Cooper found, April 30, 1870, a\r\nmale of this species in full plumage and singing delightfully on a\r\nridge above Emigrant Gap on the west slope of the Sierra, about 5,500\r\nfeet altitude, and where the snow was still lying in deep drifts. He\r\nis confident that he saw the same species at Copperopolis in February,\r\n1864. He thinks there is no doubt that to some extent they winter in the\r\nState.\r\n\r\n=Lanivireo solitarius=, var. =plumbeus= (I, 378). El Paso County,\r\nColorado; AIKEN.\r\n\r\n=Vireo pusillus= (I, 391). Dr. Cooper found this species near San\r\nBuenaventura as early as March 26, 1872, where it was quite common. On\r\nthe 22d of April he found a nest pendent between the forks of a dead\r\nwillow branch. This was five feet from the ground, built on the edge of\r\na dense marshy thicket, of flat strips and fibres of bark, and lined\r\nwith fine grass, hair, and feathers. There were a few feathers of the\r\nBarn Owl, also, on the outside. The nest measured three inches each way.\r\nThe eggs were laid about the 28th, were four in number, white, with a\r\nfew small black specks mostly near the larger ends, and measured .69 of\r\nan inch in length by .51 in breadth.\r\n\r\n=Phænopepla nitens= (I, 405). Captain Bendire writes me that he found\r\nthis species common in the vicinity of Tucson, Arizona, during the\r\nsummer, a few only remaining during the winter; most of these had\r\nwhite edgings on all their feathers, and were probably young of the\r\nyear. Their flight is described as wavering, something like that of\r\n_Colaptes mexicanus_. While flying they utter a high note, resembling\r\n_whuif-whuif_, repeated several times. He never heard them sing, as they\r\nare said to do, although he has watched them frequently. They are very\r\nrestless, and are always found about the mistletoe, on the berries of\r\nwhich they feed almost exclusively. The nest is saddled on a horizontal\r\nbranch, generally of a mesquite-tree. It is a shallow structure, about\r\n4 inches across; its inner diameter is 2½ inches, depth ½ an inch. It\r\nis composed of fine sticks, fibres of plants, and lined with a little\r\ncottonwood down and a stray feather. The first nest was found May 16.\r\nThis was principally lined with the shells of empty cocoons. The number\r\nof eggs was two. Though he found more than a dozen nests with eggs and\r\nyoung, he never found more than two in a nest. Their ground-color varies\r\nfrom a greenish-white to a lavender and a grayish-white, spotted all\r\nover with different shades of brown. The spots are all small, and most\r\nabundant about the larger end, and vary greatly in their distributions.\r\nIn size they range from .97 of an inch to .84 in length, and in breadth\r\nfrom .66 to .60.\r\n\r\n=Collurio ludovicianus=, var. =robustus= (I, 420). See Am. Nat. VII,\r\nOctober, 1873, p. 609.\r\n\r\n=Certhiola newtoni= (I, 427). See Am. Nat. VII, October, 1873, p. 611.\r\n\r\n=Certhiola caboti= (I, 427). See Am. Nat. VII, October, 1873, p. 612.\r\n\r\n=Certhiola barbadensis=, =Certhiola frontalis= (I, 427). See Am. Nat.\r\nVII, October, 1873, p. 612.\r\n\r\n=Pyranga hepatica= (I, 440). Captain Bendire found what he identified as\r\nthis species breeding near Tucson, Arizona. Its nests and eggs resembled\r\nthose of _P. æstiva_. The latter vary in length from 1.02 inches to\r\n.95, and in breadth from .70 to .67 of an inch. Their ground-color is\r\na pale light green. Some are sparingly marked over the entire egg with\r\nvery distinctive and conspicuous blotches of purplish-brown; others are\r\ncovered more generally with finer dottings of the same hue, and these\r\nare so numerous as partly to obscure the ground. In shape the eggs are\r\noblong oval, and are of nearly equal size at either end. This species\r\nwas also obtained by Mr. Henshaw, at Apache, Arizona.\r\n\r\nAs no skins of the parent appear to have been preserved, it is not\r\nimprobable that the bird in question may be really _P. æstiva_, var.\r\n_cooperi_.\r\n\r\n=Hesperiphona vespertina=, var. =montana= (I, 450). Two adult males\r\nobtained at Waukegan, Illinois, in January, 1873, by Mr. Charles\r\nDouglass, are typical examples of the Rocky Mountain form.\r\n\r\n=Pinicola enucleator= (I, 453). Dr. Cooper mentions having shot a fine\r\nmale of this species near the summit of the Central Railroad Pass at an\r\nelevation of about 7,000 feet. It was in a fine orange-red plumage. It\r\nwas moulting, and appeared to be a straggler.\r\n\r\n=Pyrrhula cassini= (I, 457). Since the publication of the article on\r\nthis species we learn from Cabanis (Journal für Ornithologie, 1871,\r\n318, 1872, 315) that the species is not uncommon in the vicinity of\r\nLake Baikal, in Siberia, and that it has even been observed in Belgium\r\n(Crommelin, Archives Neérlandaises). The bird, therefore, like the\r\n_Phyllopneuste borealis_ (_P. kennicotti_, Baird) and _Motacilla flava_,\r\nis to be considered as Siberian, straggling to continental Alaska in the\r\nsummer season.\r\n\r\n=Chrysomitris psaltria= (I, 474). See Am. Journ. of Science and Arts,\r\nVol. IV, December, 1872, for a special paper upon the races of this\r\nspecies and their relation to climatic regions.\r\n\r\n=Chrysomitris psaltria=, var. =arizonæ= (I, 476). On the 7th of May,\r\n1872, Dr. Cooper saw a single specimen (male), which he had no doubt was\r\nof this bird, at Encinetos Ranch, thirty miles north of San Diego. It\r\nwas feeding with other species among dry sunflowers. He also saw another\r\nnear San Buenaventura in January, 1873.\r\n\r\n=Loxia “leucoptera=, var.” =bifasciata= (I, 483). At the time when the\r\nsynopsis of the species of this genus was prepared, we had not seen any\r\nspecimens of the European White-winged Crossbill. A recent examination\r\nof specimens from Sweden has convinced us, however, that the species\r\nis entirely distinct from _leucoptera_, and more nearly related to\r\n_curvirostra_, with the several forms of which it agrees quite closely\r\nin the details of form and proportions, as well as in tints, with the\r\nexception of the markings of the wing.\r\n\r\n=Leucosticte tephrocotis= (I, 504). The specimens collected by Mr. Allen\r\nin Colorado, mentioned in the foot-note on page 505, and there said to\r\nbe the summer dress of _L. tephrocotis_, we now believe to be a distinct\r\nform, which may be named var. _australis_, ALLEN, characterized as\r\nfollows:—\r\n\r\n  _Leucosticte tephrocotis_, var. _australis_, ALLEN, MSS. _Leucosticte\r\n  tephrocotis_, ALLEN, Am. Nat. VI, No. 5, May, 1872.—IB. Bull. Mus.\r\n  Comp. Zoöl. Vol. III, No. 6, pp. 121, 162.\r\n\r\nCHAR. Similar to var. _tephrocotis_, but without any gray on the head,\r\nthe red of the abdomen and wing-coverts bright carmine, instead of\r\ndilute rose-color, and the bill deep black, instead of yellow tipped\r\nwith dusky. Prevailing color raw-umber (more earthy than in var.\r\n_tephrocotis_), becoming darker on the head and approaching to black on\r\nthe forehead. Nasal tufts white. Wings and tail dusky, the secondaries\r\nand primaries skirted with paler; lesser and middle wing-coverts and\r\ntail-coverts, above and below, broadly tipped with rosy carmine,\r\nproducing nearly uniform patches; abdominal region with the feathers\r\nbroadly tipped with deep carmine or intense crimson, this covering\r\nnearly uniformly the whole surface. Bill and feet deep black.\r\n\r\n_Male_ (No. 15,724, Mus. C. Z., Mt. Lincoln, Colorado, July 25, 1871;\r\nJ. A. Allen). Wing, 4.20; tail, 3.10; culmen, .45; tarsus, .70; middle\r\ntoe, .60.\r\n\r\n_Female_ (Mt. Lincoln, July 25; J. A. Allen). Wing, 4.00; tail, 3.00.\r\nColors paler and duller, the red almost obsolete.\r\n\r\n_Hab._ Breeding on Mt. Lincoln, Colorado, above the timber-line, at an\r\naltitude of about 12,000 feet. (July, 1872, J. A. Allen.)\r\n\r\nSince the descriptions of the several stages of _L. tephrocotis_ were\r\ncast, we have received from Mr. H. W. Elliott—Assistant Agent of the\r\nUnited States Treasury Department, stationed at St. Paul’s Island,\r\nAlaska, an accomplished and energetic collector—numerous specimens of\r\n_L. griseinucha_ in the breeding plumage. The fact that these specimens\r\nhave the gray of the head as well defined as do examples in the winter\r\nplumage, while the red is at the same time much intensified, induces\r\nus to modify our views expressed on pages 504, 505, in regard to Mr.\r\nAllen’s Colorado specimens, and to regard them as representing a race\r\nwhich must have the head dusky _at all seasons_, and _not_ a seasonal\r\nphase of var. _tephrocotis_. The winter plumage probably differs from\r\nthat described above only in the red being of a soft, rather dilute,\r\nrosy tint, instead of a harsh bright carmine; the bill is also probably\r\nyellow in winter, since in the breeding specimens of _griseinucha_ from\r\nAlaska the bill is black, while in winter examples it is yellow, with\r\nonly the point dusky.\r\n\r\nA series of seven fine specimens sent in by Mr. J. H. Batty, the\r\nnaturalist of Dr. Hayden’s expedition, confirm the validity of this\r\nform, and even so much as suggest to us the possibility of its\r\neventually proving a distinct species, more nearly related to _L.\r\nbrunneinucha_ than to _L. tephrocotis_. They were collected on some one\r\nof the high peaks of Colorado, but as Mr. Batty’s notes have not come\r\nto hand we cannot tell which. The specimens are all males, and resemble\r\nMr. Allen’s specimens, except that they are perhaps more highly colored.\r\nThey all have the _throat_ tinged with carmine, and in some the tinge is\r\nvery deep,—on one extending over the whole breast and throat, up to the\r\ncheeks and bill. We hope to learn soon from Mr. Batty some interesting\r\ndetails regarding this series.\r\n\r\n=Centronyx bairdi= (I, 531). The past year has been a remarkably\r\nfortunate one for our knowledge of this species, and, owing to the\r\ninvestigations of Mr. C. E. Aiken, Dr. Coues, and Mr. H. W. Henshaw,\r\nit cannot now be classed among the rare birds of our country; the\r\ntotal number of specimens collected by these gentlemen amounting to\r\nmore than one hundred. The first example—the second one then known—was\r\ncollected by Mr. Aiken in El Paso County, Colorado, October 9, 1872,\r\nand, being in the soft autumnal plumage, appeared to be so distinct\r\nfrom the type that, after a careful comparison of the two specimens,\r\nMr. Ridgway wrote Mr. Aiken that it was in his opinion different, and\r\naccompanied his letter by a comparative diagnosis of the two supposed\r\nspecies. The Colorado specimen was then described in the American\r\nNaturalist (Vol. VII, April, 1873, p. 236) as _Centronyx ochrocephalus_,\r\nAIKEN. On the 6th of May, 1873, Mr. Aiken obtained another specimen at\r\nthe same locality; and this one, being forwarded to Mr. Ridgway for\r\ncomparison, proved to be so decidedly intermediate between the types of\r\n_C. bairdi_ and _C._ “_ochrocephalus_” that they immediately suggested\r\nthe probability of their being seasonal stages of one species,—_C.\r\nbairdi_ representing the very faded and much abraded midsummer dress;\r\n_C. ochrocephalus_ being the autumnal dress, probably of a young bird,\r\nwith the pattern of coloration distinct, and the colors soft and deep;\r\nand the May specimen the spring plumage, just intermediate between the\r\ntwo others.\r\n\r\nDuring the past summer (1873) Dr. Coues collected about seventy\r\nspecimens along the northern border of Dakota, from just west of the\r\nPembina Mountains to the second crossing of the Mouse River. They\r\nfrequented the open prairie exclusively, associating in vast numbers\r\nwith _Neocorys spraguei_ and _Plectrophanes ornatus_, these three being\r\nthe most abundant and characteristic birds of the prairie. By the middle\r\nof July young birds were already observed; and, equally young ones\r\nbeing taken in the middle of August, it is presumed that two broods\r\nwere raised. The splendid suite of specimens brought in by Dr. Coues\r\ncomprises both adult and young birds. Of the former, many examples\r\nexactly match Audubon’s type, while others approach very closely Mr.\r\nAiken’s specimen in the spring plumage. The young, however, are in a\r\nplumage entirely new. We give below descriptions of the several stages\r\nof plumage:—\r\n\r\n_Adult male in spring_ (No. 2,141, Mus. R. R., El Paso County, Colorado,\r\nMay 6, 1873; C. E. Aiken). Ground-color of the head deep buff, growing\r\npaler toward the throat, which is white; crown sharply streaked with\r\ndeep black, the streaks aggregated laterally so as to form two broken\r\nstripes; a cuneate speck of black at the post-superior corner of the\r\nauriculars; maxillary stripe deep buff, bounded above and below by\r\ncontinuous stripes of black,—one from the rictus along lower edge of\r\ncheeks, the other from side of chin down side of throat. Above pale\r\nhair-brown, the feathers paler, or brownish-white, externally, and\r\nbrownish-black centrally. Beneath white, tinged with buff across the\r\njugulum, where thickly marked with cuneate streaks of deep black; sides\r\nsparsely streaked, the streaks more brown. “Legs and lower mandible\r\nflesh-color; upper mandible horn-color; toes and claws dusky. Length,\r\n5.62; extent, 9.04.” Wing, 2.80; tail, 2.15; culmen, .45; tarsus, .80;\r\nmiddle toe, .60.\r\n\r\n_Adult female in summer_, exactly similar, but rather smaller, and the\r\ncolors duller and paler.\r\n\r\n_Young, in first plumage._ Similar in general appearance to the adult in\r\nfall plumage, but the markings more suffused. All the contour feathers\r\nof the dorsal surface sharply bordered terminally and laterally with\r\nwhite; streaks on the breast heavier and shorter.\r\n\r\n_Adult male in autumn_ (No. 1,113, Mus. C. E. A., El Paso County,\r\nColorado, October 9, 1872).[118] Ground-color of the head deep\r\nochraceous, deepest on the middle of the crown, and gradually fading to\r\nbuffy-white on the throat; feathers of the crown with broad, deep black\r\nmedial streaks, these narrower toward the middle, forming two lateral\r\nbroadly black-streaked areas, with an intervening, badly defined,\r\ndeep-ochraceous, narrowly streaked stripe. A distinct black spot behind\r\nthe upper posterior corner of the auriculars; a smaller one at the\r\nmiddle of their posterior edge, and two black streaks bordering the\r\nlight-ochraceous maxillary stripe,—a narrow one from the rictus along\r\nthe lower edge of the deeply ochraceous ear-coverts and suborbital\r\nregion, and a heavy “bridle” on each side of the throat. Lower parts\r\nbuffy-white, fading into nearly pure white posteriorly; jugulum crossed\r\nby a series of heavy cuneate deep-black streaks, these continuing\r\nbackward along the sides, but becoming reddish on the flanks; tibiæ\r\nbrownish-gray. Neck, laterally and posteriorly, light ochraceous-yellow,\r\neach feather with a sharply defined medial streak of black. Dorsal\r\nfeathers deep black centrally, then hair-brown (not reddish), and\r\nbroadly bordered with white, both laterally and terminally. Rump and\r\nupper tail-coverts reddish hair-brown, each feather broadly bordered\r\nwith buffy-white and with a black shaft-streak. General aspect of the\r\nwings grayish-pinkish ochraceous, the feathers all blackish centrally;\r\nouter web of outer primary pure white. Tail-feathers black, skirted with\r\nwhitish ashy-ochraceous, this becoming pure white on the lateral pair of\r\nfeathers, the exterior of which is pale gray centrally. Lining of wing\r\nimmaculate pure white.\r\n\r\nWing, 3.00; tail, 2.40; culmen, .45; depth of bill, .23; tarsus, .85;\r\nmiddle toe, .63; lateral toes, .20 shorter; hind toe, .35. End of the\r\nwing formed by the four outer quills, of which the second and third\r\nare equal and longest, the first and fourth equal and just appreciably\r\nshorter; tertials considerably longer than the secondaries, and only .20\r\nshorter than the longest primaries. Tail deeply emarginated (fork .20\r\ndeep), the lateral feathers longest.\r\n\r\nThe following measurements of about thirty fresh specimens, kindly\r\nfurnished us by Dr. Coues, indicate the normal variation in size: “The\r\nmales range from 5.10 to 5.85 in length, by 9.10 to 9.85 in extent,\r\naveraging about 5.65 by 9.50. The shortest-winged specimen was a female,\r\nexpanding 8.85, though measuring 5.50 in length; the wing ordinarily\r\nranged from 2.75 to 3.00.”\r\n\r\nDr. Coues also furnishes the following account of the habits of this\r\nspecies, which we print _verbatim_:—\r\n\r\n“Out of thirty-one specimens collected July 14 and 15, twenty-nine were\r\nmales, one female, and one young. This remarkable preponderance of males\r\ncollected was owing to the fact that these attracted my attention as\r\nthey sat singing on the tops of the weeds and low bushes; the females\r\nbeing probably down in the grass, incubating, or attending to their\r\nyoung,—at any rate not singing. In general appearance and manners they\r\nwere so similar to Savanna Sparrows (_Passerculus savanna_) with which\r\nthey were here associated, that they could only be distinguished at\r\ngunshot range after several days’ close observation. The song resembles\r\nthat of the Savanna Sparrow, but may soon be learned; it consists of two\r\nor three chirps and an indefinite trill—_zip, zip, zip, zurrrrrrr_—in\r\na mellow tinkling tone. The birds rise from the grass with a quick\r\nflickering flight, seldom going far before re-alighting. They remain in\r\nthis portion of the country at least until October. Though scattered\r\nover the prairie, they tend to gather in little colonies; that is to\r\nsay, one might ride a mile or so without seeing any, and then find\r\nnumbers in the same spot. After leaving the prairie included in the\r\nbend of the Souris River, none were seen on the Coteau de Missouri;\r\nthough this may have been owing to the lateness of the season. Late in\r\nJuly I scared a female off her nest on the prairie: the bird ran slyly\r\nthrough the grass, like a mouse, for some distance, before taking wing;\r\nher actions being like those of _Plectrophanes ornatus_ under similar\r\ncircumstances. Unfortunately, however, the nest was not found; but it\r\nwill almost certainly be found to be built upon the ground, like that of\r\n_Poocætes_, _Passerculus_, and other allies.”\r\n\r\nWe learn by letter (dated October 7, 1873) from Mr. H. W. Henshaw, the\r\nnaturalist of Lieutenant Wheeler’s expedition, that he has obtained\r\n(somewhere along the line of their route, apparently in New Mexico,\r\nbut the locality is not mentioned) about thirty specimens of what he\r\nsupposes to be this bird in the fall plumage. In regard to their habits,\r\nMr. Henshaw writes as follows: “It is essentially a plain bird, with\r\nhabits about half-way between those of the Savanna and Yellow-winged\r\nSparrows, both of which were abundant in the same locality.”\r\n\r\n=Plectrophanes ornatus= (I, 520). The abundant material brought in\r\nby recent collectors, among whom we may mention particularly Mr.\r\nAllen (see Bull. Mus. Comp. Zoöl. III, No. 6, p. 135) and Dr. Coues,\r\nthrows additional light upon the relationship of this species and\r\n_P._ “_melanomus_” (I, 521), and affords conclusive evidence of their\r\nidentity. The latter is merely a high stage of plumage, with the lesser\r\ncoverts deep black, instead of brown as in midsummer, and rufous borders\r\nto the black feathers of the lower parts, which become worn off in\r\nmidsummer.\r\n\r\n=Passerculus alaudinus= (I, 537). Dr. Cooper informs me that in July,\r\n1873, he found young but fully fledged birds of this species quite\r\ncommon along the beach near Santa Barbara, and where, possibly, they\r\nmay have been mistaken by Dr. Heermann for _P. rostratus_. One he shot\r\nclosely resembled in plumage the young _Melospiza heermanni_. They had\r\nbeen, without doubt, hatched on the grassy hills near by, and may breed\r\nfarther south on the mountains. _P. anthinus_ was numerous all summer in\r\nthe neighboring marshes, but not away from salt water.\r\n\r\n=Passerculus princeps= (I, 540). Additional specimens collected at\r\nIpswich, Mass., by Mr. Maynard, and on Long Island by Mr. Lawrence,\r\nconfirm the validity of this form, and likewise considerably extend its\r\nknown range.\r\n\r\n=Coturniculus passerinus=, var. =perpallidus= (I, 556). First described\r\nin Coues’s Key, October, 1872, p. 137.\r\n\r\n=Coturniculus lecontei= (I, 558). Seven specimens of this interesting\r\nspecies were collected in August, 1873, by Dr. Coues, while attached\r\nto the Northern Boundary Survey. Five of them were obtained August 9,\r\nat the head-waters of the Souris River, on a boundless prairie. They\r\ninhabited the low portions of the prairie, where the grass was tall,\r\nrecalling to mind the sea-shore marshes inhabited by the _Ammodromi_\r\nof the Atlantic coast. In habits they entirely resembled the seaside\r\nBuntings (_A. caudacutus_ and _A. maritimus_).\r\n\r\nThese specimens reveal the fact that Leconte’s Bunting is quite as much\r\nan _Ammodromus_ as a _Coturniculus_, being, in fact, just intermediate\r\nbetween _A. caudacutus_ and _C. henslowi_, agreeing most nearly with\r\nthe latter in style of coloration, and exactly resembling the former in\r\nform, the rectrices being even longer, stiffer, and more acute. This\r\nrenders it necessary to unite _Ammodromus_ and _Coturniculus_ into one\r\ngenus, recognizing them as subgenera, definable chiefly by the different\r\nstyle of coloration of the superior surface in the two groups. The name\r\n_Ammodromus_ stands as the proper designation of the genus, being of\r\nearlier date.\r\n\r\nSeveral stages of plumage are represented in the series obtained by Dr.\r\nCoues; and, the diagnosis of the species given on p. 552 being taken\r\nfrom a very defective specimen, we give here short descriptions taken\r\nfrom the elegant skins before us.\r\n\r\n_Adult male_ (No. 3,442, Coll. E. C.). Ground-color of the head white,\r\ntinged with buff on the maxillæ, and with ash on the auriculars; crown\r\nwith two broad black stripes, separated by a narrow medial one of\r\nwhitish; nuchal feathers bright rufous, edged with ashy-white, and\r\nshafted with black; dorsal feathers black, broadly edged exteriorly with\r\nwhite, and interiorly narrowly skirted with rufous. Beneath entirely\r\nwhite, tinged on the throat with buff, and streaked on the sides—from\r\nthe breast to the flanks—with black. Length, 5.00; extent, 7.10; wing,\r\n2.10; tail, 2.00; culmen, .42; tarsus, .68.\r\n\r\n_Adult female_ (No. 3,443, E. C.). Resembling the male, but, being in\r\nless abraded plumage, the colors more pronounced. The head is deep\r\nbuff (just as in _Ammodromus caudacutus_), the auriculars and lores\r\ndistinctly grayish-white, and the medial stripe of the crown ashy-white,\r\nexcept the anterior third, which is buff. On the lower parts, the whole\r\nlower side of the head, the entire breast, sides, flanks, and tibiæ,\r\nare deep buff, the sides sharply streaked with black. The abdomen, anal\r\nregion, and crissum are pure white, in marked contrast. Length, 5.00;\r\nextent, 7.00; wing, 2.00; tail, 2.10; culmen, .45; tarsus, .70.\r\n\r\n_Young_ (Nos. 3,444, 3,445, and 3,446, E. C.). Ground-color above\r\ndull buff, below white; the pattern of the old birds seen in the\r\nmarkings, which, however, are pure black, all red and brown tints being\r\nabsent,—except on the wings and tail, which are nearly as in the adult.\r\n\r\n=Ammodromus maritimus= (I, 560). Mr. Maynard has discovered a very\r\nremarkable new local form of this species in Florida, which he has named\r\nvar. _nigrescens_, possessing the following characters:—\r\n\r\n  _Ammodromus maritimus_, var. _nigrescens_, RIDGWAY.\r\n\r\nCHAR. Above black, nearly uniform, and with a faint brownish cast;\r\ndorsal feathers with their outer edges narrowly grayish-white; remiges\r\nand tail-feathers edged with olive-brown; edge of the wing bright\r\ngamboge-yellow; supra-loral stripe deep yellow to above the middle of\r\nthe eye; an obscure supra-auricular stripe of olive-grayish. Lores,\r\nauriculars, and cheeks nearly uniform black; lower parts pure white,\r\ncovered with broad streaks of black, the anal region and middle line of\r\nthe throat only unstreaked. Wing, 2.40; tail, 2.50; culmen, .55; tarsus,\r\n.95; middle toe, .55. (1855, Coll. R. R.)\r\n\r\nSpecimens of var. _maritimus_ from Fort Macon, North Carolina, are much\r\ndarker than Connecticut examples.\r\n\r\n=Zonotrichia leucophrys=, var. =gambeli= (I, 569). Specimens from the\r\nPacific Coast, which are true _gambeli_, are uniformly different from\r\nMiddle Province examples in several important particulars; the colors\r\nare all darker, the ash more sombre, and the dorsal streaks sooty-black\r\ninstead of chestnut-brown. In everything except the coloration of the\r\nhead they closely resemble _Z. coronata_. The Middle Province form may\r\nbe named _Zonotrichia leucophrys_, var. _intermedia_, Ridgway.\r\n\r\n=Junco= (I, 578). For a new synopsis of the genus, see Am. Nat. VII,\r\nOctober, 1873, p. 613.\r\n\r\n=Junco hyemalis=, var. =aikeni= (I, 584). First described in Am. Nat.\r\nVII, October, 1873, p. 615.\r\n\r\n=Junco oregonus= (I, 584). Dr. Cooper writes that the Oregon Snowbird\r\nfrequents the Sierra Nevada, lat. 39°, up to an elevation of 9,000 feet.\r\nHe found a nest with three eggs at an elevation of about 7,000 feet,\r\nJuly 28, 1870.\r\n\r\n=Poospiza belli= (I, 593). A fall specimen from Dr. Cooper, collected at\r\nSaticoy, California, October 8, 1872, shows a new plumage of this form,\r\nand substantiates the remarkable difference, in every stage of plumage,\r\nfrom var. _nevadensis_ (I, 594). It differs from specimens of the latter\r\nin the corresponding dress, in the following particulars:—\r\n\r\nSub-maxillary bridle deep black, very broad, and reaching to the bill;\r\npectoral spot conspicuous, black; sides strongly washed with ochraceous;\r\nabove dark plumbeous instead of light ash; no trace of streaks on the\r\nback. Wing, 2.80; tail, 3.00; culmen, .40; tarsus, .80. (No. 63,652,\r\nMus. S. I.)\r\n\r\n=Spizella monticola= (II, 3). Collected by Henshaw in Southern Utah, in\r\nOctober, 1872. Probably found throughout the Middle Province region.\r\n\r\n=Spizella socialis= (II, 7). Dr. Cooper informs us that the Chipping\r\nSparrow frequents the Sierra Nevada, near latitude 39°, up to 9,000 feet\r\nelevation, in summer, and is the only species of Spizella to be seen\r\nthere at that season.\r\n\r\n=Spizella pallida=, var. =breweri= (II, 13). Dr. Cooper met with\r\nthis species arriving from the South, in small flocks, April, 1873,\r\nfrequenting bushy grounds ten miles inland. They had the song and habits\r\nas described, but were not seen in the low country in summer.\r\n\r\n=Melospiza lincolni= (II, 31). Dr Cooper writes that in July, 1870,\r\nhe found this species numerous at and near the summit of the Central\r\nRailroad in an elevation of from 7,000 to 9,000 feet. They were always\r\nabout marshy thickets, often close to fields of perpetual snow. They had\r\nthere raised their young, which were mostly fledged. He found a nest\r\nwith one egg on the ground. As he found this July 27, he thinks that\r\nwithout doubt it raises two broods in a season even in that subalpine\r\nregion. The song he found quite different from that of the other\r\n_Melospizæ_, being fainter, more lively and continuous, like that of\r\nsome Wren or Warbler.\r\n\r\n=Melospiza palustris= (II, 34). Collected in Southern Utah (Washington),\r\nOctober 23, 1872, by Mr. Henshaw. (Mus. S. I., No. 63,500.)\r\n\r\n=Peucæa æstivalis=, var. =arizonæ= (II, 41). First described in Am. Nat.\r\nVII, October, 1873, p. 616.\r\n\r\n=Peucæa carpalis.= An additional species of _Peucæa_ has been discovered\r\nin Arizona by that diligent collector, Lieutenant (now Captain) Charles\r\nBendire, U. S. A. It has been described (Am. Nat. VII, June, 1873, p.\r\n322) by Dr. Coues as _Peucæa carpalis_. Its characters are as follows:—\r\n\r\n  _Peucæa carpalis_, COUES. Rufous-shouldered Sparrow.\r\n\r\nSP. CHAR. Resembling in general appearance a large _Spizella\r\npusilla_, but with rufous lesser wing-coverts, and blackish rictal\r\nand infra-maxillary streaks. Above grayish earth-brown, each feather\r\nwith the medial portion dusky, forming conspicuous black streaks on\r\nthe dorsal region, and dusky centres to the wing-coverts and tertials.\r\nNape and rump plain, and more ashy. Crown and lesser wing-coverts plain\r\nrufous, the former divided anteriorly with a whitish medial line.\r\nBeneath ashy-white, including a well-defined superciliary and maxillary\r\nstripe, which have a slight buffy tinge. Throat nearly pure white,\r\nbordered on each side by a conspicuous narrow streak of black; whitish\r\nmaxillary stripe bordered above by a dusky rictal streak. Bill reddish,\r\ndarker on the culmen. Tarsi dilute brown; toes horn-brown. Wing, 2.50;\r\ntail, 2.75; culmen, .45; tarsus, .80; middle toe, .55.\r\n\r\n_Hab._ Tucson, Arizona. (No. 62,372. September, 1872, Captain C.\r\nBendire, U. S. A.)\r\n\r\nAnother specimen, supposed to be a female, in winter plumage (Tucson,\r\nJanuary 10, 1873) differs quite appreciably in its markings and colors.\r\nThe crown is more streaked, every feather being edged laterally with\r\nashy-gray; the blackish streaks on the back and scapulars are more\r\ndistinct, and the inner web of the lateral tail-feather is broadly\r\nbordered with white terminally. It measures, wing, 2.50; tail, 2.90;\r\nculmen, .45; tarsus, .70. “Length, 5.75; stretch, 7.80.”\r\n\r\nCaptain Bendire informs me that he found this species rather common in\r\nthe vicinity of Tucson. It was generally seen in company with _Poospiza\r\nbilineata_. Its usual call-note resembled the syllables _zib-zib-zib_.\r\nHe believed it to be a resident of Arizona throughout the year. It\r\ncommences nesting early in June, generally building in the small\r\nmesquite bushes, sometimes not over six inches, seldom more than four\r\nfeet, from the ground. The nests are composed of fine dry grasses and\r\nrootlets, and lined with the fine, slender seed-tops of the secatow or\r\nrye-grass, and sometimes with a few hairs. The nest is very deep, and\r\nis firmly fixed into a fork of the bush in which it is built. The eggs,\r\nwhen fresh, are of a pale green color, and average .73 of an inch in\r\nlength by .58 in breadth, are unspotted, are generally four, seldom\r\nfive, in a nest. One nest with four eggs was found September 11, 1872.\r\n\r\n=Passerella= (II, 49). The capture of a specimen exactly intermediate\r\nbetween _P. iliaca_ and _P. townsendii_, at Saticoy, California,\r\nDecember 14, 1872, by Dr. Cooper, renders it extremely probable that all\r\nthe known forms of this genus are but geographical races of one species.\r\nThe characters of this specimen (No. 63,651) are as follows: Most like\r\n_iliaca_ in reddish tints and coloration of the head, with occasional\r\nnearly pure ashy lights, but with the suffused pattern of _townsendii_.\r\nWing, 3.60; tail, 3.60; culmen, .50; tarsus, 1.00.\r\n\r\n=Passerella megarhynchus= (II, 57). Dr. Cooper found this species common\r\nbetween 5,000 and 7,000 feet elevation, on the Central Pacific Railroad\r\nline, where most of the country was still covered with snow. One or\r\ntwo were to be found in every thicket at distances of a quarter of a\r\nmile, already paired and having selected their summer residence, having\r\nremained in close proximity to the snowy region all winter. In July,\r\non a second visit to the mountains, he observed them still singing\r\noccasionally, at Truckee, near 6,000 feet altitude, on the east slope.\r\n\r\n=Euspiza americana= (II, 65). According to Mr. Allen this species is\r\nabundant at Denver, Colorado, being found entirely across the Plains to\r\nthe eastern slope of the Rocky Mountains.\r\n\r\n=Guiraca cærulea= (II, 77). Has been obtained in El Paso County,\r\nColorado, by Mr. Aiken.\r\n\r\n=Cardinalis virginianus=, var. =igneus= (II, 103). Has been found in El\r\nPaso County, Colorado. Specimens from Eastern Kansas, collected by Mr.\r\nAllen, seem also to be referrible to this form.\r\n\r\n=Pipilo erythropthalmus= (II, 109). Specimens collected by Dr. Coues\r\nat Pembina, Minnesota, in June, 1873, have (both males and females) a\r\ngreater or less number of minute white specks more or less distinctly\r\nindicated on the portion where the large white spots of the western\r\nforms are located. This points to the probability that all the black\r\nraces ranged in the synopsis under _maculatus_ (including the latter\r\nitself) must be referred to _erythropthalmus_.\r\n\r\n=Pipilo mesoleucus= (II, 125). Captain Bendire found this species\r\nbreeding in Southern Arizona, in the neighborhood of Tucson. One nest\r\nwas found August 2, another September 4, 1872. Both were built in\r\nmesquite-trees, and were six feet from the ground,—an unusual position\r\nin birds of this family. The eggs are also peculiar, and differ from any\r\nof this genus I have ever met with, having more resemblance to eggs of\r\n_Sturnellæ_, especially to the _militaris_ of South America. The eggs\r\nfrom one nest are one inch in length by .73 in breadth, have a bright\r\nwhite ground, with a slight tinge of bluish, and are boldly plashed,\r\nespecially around the larger end, with distinct deep dashes of reddish\r\nand purplish brown. A few of these blotches are scattered irregularly\r\nover the entire egg, but the greater portion are grouped around the more\r\nobtuse end. The eggs are of oval shape, both ends rounded, one slightly\r\nless than the other. The eggs in another nest are more nearly spherical,\r\nwith less difference in the ends; the ground-color is more distinctly\r\nwhite; the spots, of reddish-brown, are finer and more concentrated\r\nabout the larger end; and the faint markings of purplish are much more\r\nnumerous. These measure .74 by .90 of an inch.\r\n\r\nThis species has also been found resident in El Paso County, Colorado,\r\nby Mr. Aiken.\r\n\r\n=Pipilo aberti= (II, 128). Captain Bendire found this species breeding\r\nabundantly in the vicinity of Tucson, in Southern Arizona. The nests\r\nwere not on the ground, as is usual among the more northern forms of\r\nPipilos, but in trees and in bushes at the height of several feet\r\nfrom the ground. One nest was taken July 28, in a small ash-tree, and\r\nanother was found on the same day in a willow-tree, more than eight\r\nfeet from the ground. The eggs bear a close resemblance to those of\r\n_Pipilo fuscus_ and to those of _P. albigula_, having a ground-color of\r\nvery light blue, marked almost exclusively around the larger end with\r\na wreath of irregular blotches of dark purplish-brown. They are of a\r\nrounded oval shape, are quite obtuse at one end, and vary in length from\r\n.97 of an inch to .88, and in breadth from .76 to .75.\r\n\r\n=Pipilo chlorurus= (II, 131). Dr. Cooper met with none of this species\r\nin the Sierra Nevada between 3,000 and 7,000 feet elevation in April,\r\n1870, when they were leisurely working their way up from the lower\r\ncountry; but in July he found them from Truckee, 6,000 feet on the east\r\nslope, up to the summit, 7,000 feet, but not higher. They were then\r\nfeeding half-grown young. Dr. Albert Kellogg found a nest on the ground,\r\nwith four eggs, spotted near the larger end on a bluish ground. The\r\nmales were still singing occasionally and very melodiously, and had the\r\nsame cry of alarm or anger as the _Pipilo erythropthalmus_. Dr. Cooper\r\nalso met with this species at Clear Lake, near the end of September,\r\nshowing that they probably breed in the northern Coast Range.\r\n\r\n=Dolichonyx oryzivorus= (II, 149). Specimens from every portion of the\r\nPlains, and west to the Great Basin, have the black intenser and more\r\ncontinuous, the nuchal patch clear ochraceous-white, the scapulars and\r\nrump unshaded white, and the white of the back confined to a median\r\nline. The bill and feet are also jet-black, instead of horn-color. They\r\nconstitute var. _albinucha_, Ridgway.\r\n\r\n=Icterus cucullatus= (II, 193). Except in the materials, which\r\ndifference may be more local than specific, the nests of this species\r\nare hardly distinguishable from those of _I. spurius_. A nest from\r\nCape St. Lucas (S. I. No. 4,954), collected May, 1860, by Mr. Xantus,\r\nis basket-shaped and pendulous, suspended on two sides to the numerous\r\ntwigs of each fork of a drooping branch. In structure it is exactly\r\nlike that of _I. spurius_, and is composed of dry wiry grasses, lined\r\nscantily with vegetable down. The length is six inches, lower side of\r\naperture only two and a half inches from the bottom. Another (S. I. No.\r\n1,940) taken May 20, 1859, at San José, Lower California, by Mr. Xantus,\r\nis a very elaborately wrought basket-shaped nest. The circumference of\r\nthe circular rim is much less than the greatest girth of the nest. The\r\nlower walls and base of the nest are very thick. The whole is composed\r\nof fine wiry grasses and scantily lined with vegetable down and soft\r\nflaxy fibres. The external diameter is 5.00 inches, the internal 2.10,\r\nheight about 3.00, and the depth of the cavity 2.80.\r\n\r\nCaptain Charles Bendire met with this species in Southern Arizona. It\r\nwas first noticed by him on the 15th of April, but he thinks they had\r\narrived nearly ten days previously, and that the date of their coming\r\nmay be given as during the first week of April. He describes it as a\r\nshy, active, and restless bird, generally frequenting the extreme tops\r\nof the tallest cottonwood-trees near the borders of the watercourses,\r\nwhich, however, are usually dry. There the bird flutters through the\r\ndense foliage in search of insects, and is scarcely ever seen for more\r\nthan an instant at a time. It commences building about the first of\r\nJune. The nest is suspended from the extremities of the lower branches\r\nof an ash, walnut, mesquite, or cottonwood tree, and is exclusively\r\ncomposed of fine wire-like grasses, which are made use of while green\r\nand pliable, and sparsely lined with the silky fibres of a species of\r\n_Asclepias_. These grasses are interlaced in such a complicated manner\r\nas to form, even when dry, a very strong structure. The dimensions\r\nof a nest are: Inner diameter, three inches; inside depth the same;\r\noutside from five and a half to four inches wide and about four deep.\r\nThe eggs are from two to four in number, usually three, are of a pale\r\nbluish-white ground, spotted with dark lilac and umber-brown about the\r\nlarger end. The largest eggs measure one inch by .64. Captain Bendire\r\nadds that he cannot regard this Oriole as a fine singer. Besides a usual\r\nchattering note resembling the syllables _char-char-char_, frequently\r\nrepeated, it has a call-note something like _hui-wit_, which is also\r\nseveral times repeated.\r\n\r\n=Icterus baltimore= (II, 195). Extends its range westward to the Rocky\r\nMountains. Collected in El Paso County, Colorado, by Mr. Aiken.\r\n\r\n=Icterus bullockii= (II, 199). Extends eastward to Eastern Kansas, where\r\nit is not uncommon. (See Snow’s Catalogue of the Birds of Kansas, 1873.)\r\n\r\n=Corvus cryptoleucus= (II, 242). According to Mr. Aiken this species is\r\nabundant, and nearly replaces _C. carnivorus_ along the eastern base of\r\nthe Rocky Mountains, as far north as Cheyenne.\r\n\r\nCaptain Bendire found this a resident species in Southern Arizona, and\r\nmet with two nests at the base of the St. Catharine Mountains, near\r\nTucson. One of these contained three, the other four eggs. These he\r\ndescribed as very light colored, so pale that if mixed with hundreds\r\nof others of this family they could be picked out without difficulty.\r\nTheir ground-color is said to be a very pale green, with darker markings\r\nrunning more into lines than spots; in fact, very few spots were found\r\non either set. The size of the largest was 1.85 inches by 1.33, that\r\nof the largest 1.70 by 1.19. They were not common in the vicinity of\r\nTucson.\r\n\r\n=Cyanura= (II, 271). For a special treatment of the races of _C.\r\nstelleri_, see Am. Journ. Science and Arts, January, 1873.\r\n\r\n=Cyanocitta californica= (II, 298). Dr. Cooper has ascertained that\r\nthis species does occur on the eastern slope of the Sierra Nevada, but\r\nlower down than the region he visited in 1863. He found a few at Verdi,\r\nclose to the eastern boundary-line of California, at about 4,500 feet\r\nelevation, in July, 1870. He saw none elsewhere.\r\n\r\n=Tyrannus vociferans= (II, 327). Captain Bendire writes that this\r\nspecies arrives in the neighborhood of Tucson about the middle of April,\r\nbut does not commence nesting until the middle of June. All the nests he\r\nfound were difficult to get at, being generally placed on a branch of\r\na large cottonwood-tree, and at a distance from the trunk. The nest is\r\ndescribed as very large for the size of the bird, composed of sticks,\r\nweeds, dry grasses, and lined with hair, wool, and the inner soft fibres\r\nof bark of the cottonwood. The usual complement of eggs is three, seldom\r\nfour. They measure from 1.00 by .75 to 1.10 by .80 of an inch, are of\r\na creamy-white color, with large isolated spots of a reddish-brown,\r\nscattered principally about the larger end.\r\n\r\n=Myiarchus= (II, 329). For a discussion of the races of _M. lawrencii_\r\nconsidered in their relation to climatic color-variation, see Am. Journ.\r\nScience and Arts, December, 1872.\r\n\r\n=Sayornis= (II, 339). The outlines of species of _Sayornis_ given below\r\nare additional to those already published.\r\n\r\n=Empidonax brunneus= (II, 363). Specimens in the collection of the\r\nBoston Society bear the MSS. name of _E. olivus_. But we cannot find a\r\nreference to this name.\r\n\r\n=Empidonax minimus= (II, 372). Has been collected in El Paso County,\r\nColorado, by Mr. Aiken.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =7226= ♂\r\n\r\n_Sayornis sayus._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =2707=\r\n\r\n_Sayornis fuscus._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =10028= ♀\r\n\r\n_Sayornis nigricans._]\r\n\r\n=Empidonax obscurus= (II, 381). Dr. Cooper found a few of this species\r\nwintering in a large grove of balsam, poplars, and willows, which\r\nretained most of their old leaves till spring, near San Buenaventura.\r\nThose shot were remarkably gray, and were supposed to have been blown\r\ndown from the borders of the desert by the violent northeast-wind.\r\n\r\n=Pyrocephalus mexicanus= (II, 387). Captain Bendire found the Red\r\nFlycatcher quite abundant in Southern Arizona, where they breed as\r\nearly as April. They were most common in the neighborhood of Reledo\r\nCreek, near Tucson, and were generally found in the neighborhood of\r\nwater. Their nests were in various situations, in one instance in a\r\ncottonwood-tree thirty feet from the ground, in another in the forks\r\nof a mesquite not more than ten feet from the ground. The nests were\r\nsmall, slight, and loosely made, and not readily preserved. They were\r\nmade externally of twigs, fine bark, stems of plants, etc., and lined\r\nwith hair and feathers. The usual number of eggs was three, and never\r\nmore. Except in size these bear a close resemblance to the eggs of\r\n_Milvulus forficatus_. Their ground is a rich cream-color, to which the\r\ndeep purplish-brown markings with which they are blotched imparts a\r\nslight tinge of red. These markings are few, bold, and conspicuous, and\r\nencircle the larger end with an almost continuous ring. In shape they\r\nare of a roundish oval, and measure .66 of an inch in length by .55 in\r\nbreadth. The nest and eggs of this species were also obtained at Cape\r\nSt. Lucas by Mr. John Xantus, and the eggs correspond. Dr. Cooper found\r\ntwo male birds of this species in a grove near the mouth of the Santa\r\nClara River, six miles from San Buenaventura, in October, 1872. They\r\nhad obtained their perfect plumage, but seemed to be young birds. They\r\nhunted insects much like a _Sayornis_, and uttered only a faint chirp.\r\n\r\n=Chordeiles popetue=, var. =minor= (II, 400). Specimens from Miami,\r\nFlorida, collected by Mr. Maynard, agree very nearly with typical\r\nexamples of var. _minor_ from Cuba, both in size and color, and should\r\npossibly be referred to that race. A male (7,414, Mus. C. J. M.)\r\nmeasures: wing, 7.00; tail, 4.15. The colors are those of var.\r\n_popetue_, with less rufous than in the single specimen of _minor_ with\r\nwhich it has been compared.\r\n\r\n=Chordeiles texensis= (II, 406). Dr. Cooper shot a single specimen of\r\nthis species near San Buenaventura, April 18, 1873.\r\n\r\n=Antrostomus carolinensis= (II, 410). This species has been detected by\r\nMr. Ridgway in Southern Illinois (Wabash County), where it is a rare\r\nsummer sojourner.\r\n\r\n=Panyptila melanoleuca= (II, 424). Dr. Cooper saw many of this species\r\nin the cañon of Santa Anna, flying about inaccessible cliffs of\r\nsandstone, where they doubtless had nests, May 20. He saw also them near\r\nSan Buenaventura, August 25, when they came down to the valley from\r\nthe sandstone cliffs ten miles distant. They afterwards hunted insects\r\nalmost daily near the coast, flying high during the calm morning, but\r\nwhen there were sea-breezes flying low and against it. After a month\r\nthey disappeared, and none were seen until December 14, when they were\r\nagain seen until the 20th. None were seen during the rains, or until\r\nFebruary 26, when they reappeared, and after April 5 they retired to the\r\nmountains.\r\n\r\n=Nephœcetes niger= (II, 429). Dr. Cooper informs us that a fine specimen\r\nof this rare bird was taken at San Francisco in the spring of 1870, and\r\nbrought to Mr. F. Gruber. It had, from some cause, been driven to alight\r\non the ground, from which it was not able to rise, and was taken alive.\r\nThe exact date was not noted.\r\n\r\n=Chætura vauxi= (II, 435). Dr. Cooper states that in the spring of 1873\r\nthis Swift appeared as early as April 22 near San Buenaventura. The year\r\nbefore he first saw them near San Diego on the 26th.\r\n\r\n=Geococcyx californianus= (II, 472). Has been found in El Paso County,\r\nColorado, by Mr. Aiken.\r\n\r\n=Picus gairdneri= (II, 512). Four eggs of this Woodpecker were taken by\r\nMr. William A. Cooper near Santa Cruz, Cal., from a hole in a tree, one\r\nside of which was much decayed. Four is said to be the usual number of\r\ntheir eggs, although five were found in one instance. The eggs resemble\r\nthose of _P. pubescens_, and measure .75 of an inch in length by .57 in\r\nbreadth.\r\n\r\n=Sphyropicus varius= (II, 539). Collected in El Paso County, Colorado,\r\nby Mr. Aiken.\r\n\r\n=Centurus uropygialis= (II, 558). Captain Bendire found this Woodpecker\r\nthe most common of the family in the vicinity of Tucson, Arizona, where\r\nit was resident throughout the year. Like nearly all of its kindred,\r\nit is an exceedingly noisy bird. It appears to be a resident species\r\nthroughout the year in all the southern portions of the Territory. Its\r\nfavorite localities for nesting appear to be in the gigantic trunks of\r\nthe large _Cereus giganteus_, which plants are called by the natives\r\nSuwarrows. These are easily excavated, and form a remarkably safe place\r\nin which to rear their young ones, on account of the many thorns with\r\nwhich these cacti are protected. Their eggs are usually four in number,\r\nbut sometimes are only two, and resemble those of all the other kinds\r\nof Woodpeckers in their color and in their rounded oval shape. They\r\naverage .98 of an inch in length and .76 in breadth. Usually two, and\r\noccasionally even three, broods are raised in a season.\r\n\r\n=Strix pratincola= (III, 13). Dr. Cooper informs us that, though most\r\nof these Owls are resident in California south of latitude 35°, there\r\nis a migration southward in fall from the north. Great numbers of them\r\nappeared near San Buenaventura about October 20, 1872, for a few days,\r\nand most of them went still farther southward. They return north about\r\nthe first of April. On the 12th of April he found a nest built four\r\nfeet up in a pepper-tree (_Schinus molle_), forming part of a hedge,\r\ncomposed of coarse sticks, straws, and dry horse-dung inside, shallow\r\nbut strongly built, and containing two eggs.\r\n\r\n=Falconidæ= (III, 103). The following outlines of the _Falconidæ_ were\r\nomitted in their proper places.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  =58983=, ♀. ½\r\n  =58983=, ♀. ½\r\n\r\n58983. _Falco richardsoni._]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =58983=, ♀.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =43139=, ♀. ½\r\n\r\n43139. _Falco gyrfalco_, var. _sacer_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =5482=, ♀. ¼\r\n\r\n5482. _Falco lanarius_, var. _polyagrus_.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: =58983=, ♀.]\r\n\r\n=Chamæpelia passerina= (III, 389). Dr. Cooper states that an individual\r\nof this species was killed by Mr. Lorquin at San Francisco, in May,\r\n1870. Mr. Lorquin also obtained several at San Gabriel, Los Angeles\r\nCounty, several years previous.\r\n\r\n=Tetrao obscurus= (III, 421). Dr. Cooper found this species in April,\r\n1870, at the edge of the melting snow, near Cisco, about 6,000 feet\r\naltitude. They were still more numerous at Emigrant Gap, 5,300 feet\r\naltitude, where snow lay only in patches, and at Truckee, on the east\r\nslope, where there was no snow, and where he found two of their eggs in\r\na deserted nest within sight of the town. In July he found them near\r\nVerdi, near the State line. This is the limit of their range. They also\r\nfrequent the edge of perpetual snow, at an elevation of 9,000 feet, more\r\nnumerously than below.\r\n\r\n=Ortyx virginianus=, var. =floridanus= (III, 469, footnote). Specimens\r\nfrom Miami, Fla., exhibit the peninsular extreme of this species. They\r\nare altogether more like var. _cubanensis_ than like _virginianus_\r\nproper, yet they differ uniformly in such essential respects from the\r\nCuban form that they merit a distinctive name. The characteristic\r\nfeatures of this form are the following:—\r\n\r\nCHAR. Above, with dark bluish-gray prevailing, only the anterior\r\npart of the back being washed, or mixed, with reddish; scapulars and\r\ntertials quite conspicuously bordered with whitish. The whole gray\r\nsurface more or less mottled or barred with black. The head-stripes\r\nare nearly uniformly black, with only a little rusty mixed in the\r\nocciput; the black gular collar is much extended, encroaching on the\r\nthroat anteriorly, so as to leave only an inch, or less, of white, and\r\nposteriorly invades the jugulum, so that there is more than an inch of\r\ncontinuous black, and over this distance where black predominates. The\r\nentire abdomen, anal region, and breast are heavily barred with black,\r\nthe black bars on the breast almost equalling the white ones in width.\r\nThe sides, flanks, and crissum are nearly uniform rufous, the feathers\r\nof the former with white edges, broken by the extensions of the black\r\nstreak which runs inside the white, while the latter have heavy black\r\nmedial streaks and white terminal spaces.\r\n\r\nThe female is similar, except in the color of the head, which is exactly\r\nthat of var. _texanus_.\r\n\r\nWing, ♂, 4.30–4.40; ♀, 4.35. Culmen, .60–.65; tarsus, 1.15–1.20; middle\r\ntoe, 1.05–1.10.\r\n\r\n=Oreortyx pictus= (III, 475). Dr. Cooper found these birds already\r\npaired near the summit of the Sierra Nevada, where the snow was but\r\nhalf melted off, and they scarcely descended below the limits of the\r\nsnow in the coldest weather. In July he saw young birds just hatched\r\nnear Truckee, at an elevation of 6,000 feet. This was on the 24th. On\r\nthe 28th another brood, a little older, was seen at the foot of Mt.\r\nStanford, about 8,000 feet above the sea. Most of the broods, however,\r\nwere nearly fledged at that time. Dr. Cooper also mentions that he\r\nfound this Quail not rare in the mountains east of San Diego above an\r\nelevation of 3,800 feet. He thought, also, that he heard this bird in\r\nthe Santa Anna range east of Annaheim. It also exists in the Santa\r\nInez Mountains, sixteen miles east of San Buenaventura, at an altitude\r\nof from 3,000 to 4,000 feet. It seems to be confined to the zone of\r\nconiferous trees, rarely if ever coming below them. Mr. Henshaw has\r\nobtained this species at Apache, in Arizona.\r\n\r\n=Lophortyx gambeli= (III, 482). Captain Bendire found this Quail\r\nbreeding in the vicinity of Tucson, in Arizona, near Rillito Creek,\r\noccasionally nesting in situations above the ground. One nest, seen June\r\n7, 1872, contained three fresh eggs. It was two feet above the ground,\r\non a willow stump, and in an exposed place, near the creek. The nest\r\nwas composed of the leaves of the cottonwood-tree. In some instances he\r\nfound as many as eighteen eggs in one nest. These closely resemble the\r\neggs of the California Quail, so much so as to be hardly distinguishable\r\nfrom them. They are all of a rounded oval shape, sharply tapering at\r\none end, and quite obtuse at the other. They measure 1.24 inches in\r\nlength by one inch in their largest breadth. Their ground-color varies\r\nfrom a deep cream to a light drab. Some are sparingly marked with large\r\nand well-defined spots, most of them circular in shape, and of a rich\r\npurplish-brown color. In others the whole surface is closely sprinkled\r\nwith minute spots of yellowish-brown, intermingled with which are larger\r\nspots of a dark purple. This species was obtained in Southern Utah by\r\nMr. Henshaw.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nEXPLANATION OF TERMS USED IN DESCRIBING THE EXTERNAL FORM OF BIRDS.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ½ NAT.

It\r\nis, perhaps, hardly necessary to say that all living birds have a head\r\nsupported on a neck, with jaws extended into a bill covered with a\r\nhorny sheath, or with skin, the two jaws situated one above the other,\r\nand always destitute of teeth. The anterior pair of limbs is developed\r\ninto wings which, however, are not always capable of use in flight; the\r\nposterior serve as legs for the support of the body in an oblique or\r\nnearly erect position. The body is covered with feathers of variable\r\nstructure and character, both in the young bird and the old. (The wings\r\nare apparently wanting in some fossil species.)\r\n\r\nThe following terms, English and Latin, are those most generally\r\nemployed in describing the external form of birds, and are principally\r\nas defined by Illiger. In cases where there is no suitable English word\r\nin use, the Latin equivalent only is given. The figure selected for\r\nillustration, drawn by Mr. R. Ridgway, is that of the common American\r\nrobin (_Turdus migratorius_, L.), and will be familiar to most students\r\nof ornithology.\r\n\r\n\r\nA.

The single toe directed backwards.\r\n      This is homologically the first or great toe directed backward. It\r\n      is\r\n\r\n      130. =Insistent= (_insistens_), when the tip at least touches the\r\n      ground, but the base raised above the level of the rest;\r\n\r\n      131. =Incumbent= (_incumbens_), when its whole under surface\r\n      touches the ground; and\r\n\r\n      132. =Elevated= (_elevatus_; _amotus_), when raised so high that\r\n      the tip does not touch the ground at all.\r\n\r\n      133. =Unarmed toe= (_Digitus muticus_).

In the usual arrangement of the toes, of three before and one\r\nbehind, the hinder corresponds to the great toe of man, or the first;\r\nthe inner anterior is the second; the middle is the third; and the outer\r\nis the fourth. When the toes are in pairs or two before and two behind,\r\nit is the outer or fourth toe that is turned backwards, as is the\r\nwoodpeckers. In the Trogons, however, the inner toe is reversed. With\r\nscarcely an exception in birds, the hinder or first toe has two joints;\r\nthe inner (2d) has three; the middle (3d) has four; and the outer (4th)\r\nhas five, or a formula of 2.3.4.5. In the typical _Caprimulgidæ_ the\r\nouter toe has only four phalanges the formula being 2.3.4.4. Finally,\r\nin some _Cypselidæ_ (_Cypselus_ and _Panytila_), we have the middle and\r\nouter toes with three joints only each, the formula being 2.3.3.3. When\r\nthere are but three toes, the hinder or first is wanting; the ostrich\r\n(_Struthio_) has but two toes, lacking the first and second.\r\n\r\n\r\nH.

London, 1869.\r\n\r\n[7] I have, however, examined the sterna only of _Nyctea_, _Bubo_,\r\n_Otus_, _Brachyotus_, _Syrnium_, _Nyctale_, and _Glaucidium_.\r\n\r\n[8] My unpublished determinations of the North American species were\r\nfurnished, by request, to Dr. Coues, for introduction into his “Key of\r\nNorth American Birds”; consequently the names used in these pages are\r\nessentially the same as those there employed.\r\n\r\n[9] This case of the restriction of the American representative of\r\na European or Western Palæarctic species to the western half of the\r\ncontinent has parallel instances among other birds. The American\r\nform of _Falcolanarius_ (var. _polyagrus_), of _Corvus corax_ (var.\r\n_carnivorus_), _Pica caudata_ (var. _hudsonica_ and var. _nuttalli_)\r\nand of _Ægialitis cantianus_ (var. _nivosus_), are either entirely\r\nrestricted to the western portion, or else are much more abundant there\r\nthan in the east. The European genera _Cinclus_, _Coccothraustes_,\r\n_Nucifraga_, and _Columba_ have representatives only in the western\r\nportion of North America.\r\n\r\nInstances of a similar relation between the plants of the Western\r\nProvince of North America and those of Europe, and more striking\r\nlikeness between the flora of the Eastern Region and that of Eastern\r\nAsia, are beautifully explained in Professor Gray’s interesting and\r\ninstructive paper entitled “Sequoia, and its History,” an address\r\ndelivered at the meeting of the American Association for the Advancement\r\nof Science, at Dubuque, Iowa, August, 1872. The poverty in the species\r\nof tortoises, and richness in lizards, and the peculiarities of the\r\nichthyological fauna, as well as absence of forms of Western North\r\nAmerica and Europe, compared with Eastern North America and Eastern\r\nAsia, afford other examples of parallelism in other classes of the\r\nAnimal Kingdom.\r\n\r\n[10] See Baird, Am.

Central American\r\nspecimens differ very appreciably from Mexican and North American\r\nexamples, in being considerably darker-colored in the extreme phases\r\nof plumage. Eight of eleven specimens convey an impression of decided\r\ndifference in this respect at a mere casual glance. The extremes of\r\nplumage in this series are as follows:—Darkest (No. 40,961, Chimandega,\r\nNicaragua; F. Hicks): The dusky mottling of the upper parts is\r\naltogether darker than in any example from Mexico or northward, and\r\nprevails, with great uniformity, over the entire surface; the white\r\nspecks are linear, instead of roundish. On the primaries and tail, the\r\nblackish and ochraceous are about equal in extent, the latter color\r\nforming five bands on the quills, and four on the tail. The facial\r\ncircle is bright dark orange above the ears, and the portion below\r\nthe ears continuous black; the face is reddish-white, strongly tinged\r\nwith wine-brown, while the spot in front of the eye is deep black. The\r\nwhole lower parts are deep orange-ochraceous, with numerous irregular\r\nspecks of dusky, which posteriorly become broken or confused into ragged\r\nzigzag transverse mottlings, while on the lower tail-coverts they form\r\nirregular transverse bars. Wing-formula, 2, 1–3. Wing, 13.00; tail,\r\n5.90; culmen, .85; tarsus, 2.90; middle toe, 1.50. Lightest (No. 41,252,\r\n♂, San José, Costa Rica, Aug. 23, 1865; José C. Zeledon): The dark\r\ntint above, though prevalent, is a continuous wash of grayish, instead\r\nof a fine mottling of blackish and white; the white specks are nearly\r\nobsolete. The wings are superficially plain grayish, this overlaying\r\nthe ground-color of ochraceous-orange; and have visible spots only on\r\nthe primaries, near their shafts. The tail has four rather distinct\r\ngrayish bands. The facial circle is ochraceous, somewhat darker across\r\nthe foreneck; the face white, with the ante-orbital spot claret-brown.\r\nEntire lower parts immaculate pure white. Wing-formula, 2, 1=3. Wing,\r\n12.30; tail, 5.30; culmen, .70; tarsus, 2.75; middle toe, 1.45.\r\n\r\nNo. 24,283, Nicaragua, (Captain J. M. Dow,) is like the specimen\r\njust described, in the uniform dark wash of the upper parts, but\r\nthis is deeper; the lower parts, however, are quite different, being\r\nochraceous-orange, instead of pure white.\r\n\r\nThe remaining five specimens (from San Salvador, Costa Rica, and\r\nNicaragua) are alike, and differ from northern birds in the deeper\r\ndark mottling of the upper parts; the white specks very conspicuous,\r\nand usually sagittate. The facial circle deep black where it crosses\r\nthe foreneck. The lower parts vary in color from nearly pure white to\r\ndeep orange-rufous; the dark markings of the lower surface are larger,\r\nmore angular, and more transverse than in true _pratincola_. The wing\r\nmeasures 11.30–13.00; tarsus, 2.55–2.95. The northern form varies from\r\n12.50–13.00 (wing) and 2.50–2.85 (tarsus). It is thus seen that while\r\nthese southern birds average smaller in general dimensions, they have\r\nactually larger feet, the average length of the tarsus being 2.80 in\r\nthe Central American series, and only 2.60 in the northern series. This\r\nexactly coincides with the case of _Sturnella_, the _S. magna_ var.\r\n_mexicana_ of the same region being smaller bodied and shorter winged\r\nthan var. _magna_ of the United States, but with much larger feet, see\r\np.\r\n\r\n[15] _Strix flammea_, var. _perlata_. _Strix perlata_, LICHT.

I, 21.\r\n\r\nThis is a still further differentiated or more appreciably modified\r\nrace. It differs in smaller size (wing, 11.70–12.50; tail, 4.80–5.20;\r\ntarsus, 2.40–2.75) and more square tail, while the colors also present\r\nconstant differences. The tail is much lighter compared with the wings,\r\nthe bands narrower and more sharply defined, though the same in number.\r\n\r\n[16] _Strix flammea_, var. _furcata_. _Strix furcata_, TEMM. Pl.

Cuba Ois. p. 34. _Hab._ West Indies (Cuba\r\nand Jamaica).\r\n\r\nThis form is the most distinctly characterized of all the races of _S.\r\nflammea_ which we have examined. It has the general plumage decidedly\r\nlighter and less rufous, while the secondaries and tail are abruptly\r\nlighter than the adjacent parts, and usually free from bands, though\r\nthere are sometimes traces of them.\r\n\r\nAll the American races of _Strix flammea_ differ very decidedly from the\r\nEuropean form (var. _flammea_) in much larger size. The differences in\r\ncolor are not so appreciable, and there is hardly any certain difference\r\nin this respect. The extreme phases, however, appear to be darker in the\r\nvar. _flammea_ than in the var. _pratincola_. The supposed differences\r\nin the character of the feathers fringing the operculum, insisted on by\r\nMacGillivray (History of British Birds, III, 1840, p. 473), I am unable\r\nto appreciate, for I cannot find that they differ in the least in the\r\ntwo races. That excellent ornithologist states that in the American\r\n“species” the feathers of the operculum are reduced to a simple tube,\r\nhaving neither filaments nor shaft, while in the European bird they are\r\nperfect feathers, with all their parts complete. Though this may have\r\nbeen the case with the one or more specimens of _pratincola_ examined by\r\nMr. MacGillivray, I have yet to see an American specimen which has not\r\nthe feathers of the operculum just as perfectly developed as in European\r\nexamples.\r\n\r\n[17] _Strix flammea_, var. _delicatula_. _Strix delicatula_, GOULD,\r\nP.

In general appearance\r\nlike _nebulosum_, but the brown very much darker, and less reddish,—that\r\nof the markings below very nearly black; the pattern, however, precisely\r\nthe same, and there is about the same proportion between the light and\r\nthe dark bars as is seen in the average of _nebulosum_. The face is\r\nplain dirty white without the brown bars or semicircles,—a constant and\r\nconspicuous feature in _nebulosum_. There is the same number of spots on\r\nthe primaries, and of bands on the tail, as in _nebulosum_. The white\r\nbeneath is without any ochraceous tinge; the primary coverts are plain\r\ndark brown. Wing-formula: 4–3=5; 1 intermediate between 8 and 9. Wing,\r\n14.80; tail, 9.00; culmen, 1.05; tarsus, 2.20; middle toe, 1.60. This\r\nrace of the _S. nebulosum_ presents very appreciable differences from\r\nthe bird of the United States. As stated above, the brown is much darker\r\nand less reddish, while the face is wholly destitute of the concentric\r\ndusky rings seen in _nebulosum_ proper. To Dr. Charles Sartorius, who,\r\nby the presentation to the Smithsonian Institution of numerous elegantly\r\nprepared specimens, has added so much to our knowledge of the birds of\r\nthe vicinity of Mirador, I take great pleasure in dedicating this new\r\nform.\r\n\r\n[22] _Syrnium nebulosum_, var. _fulvescens_. _Syrnium fulvescens_,\r\nSALVIN, P.

This bird\r\nis merely a very dark local form of the common species, though it\r\ndiffers very appreciably in the sharper definition, greater extent, and\r\nmore intense tint of the brown markings of its plumage.\r\n\r\nI have been unable to find any description of this form, and believe\r\nit to be unnamed. It is certainly not the _S. dominicensis_, GMEL.\r\n(S. N. 296, _S. domingensis_, MÜLL. GRAY’S Hand List, 43, No. 438), not\r\n_S. fusca_, VIEILL. (GRAY’S Hand List, No. 439). The type is in the\r\ncollection of the Boston Society of Natural History, and belongs to the\r\nLafresnaye collection (No. 787).\r\n\r\n[39] We give, above, three well-marked illustrations of asymmetry: two\r\nrelating to the auditory apparatus of the two sides of the head, and one\r\nof opposite sides of the skull.\r\n\r\n[40] As in the case of the _Strigidæ_, my determinations of the North\r\nAmerican species of _Falconidæ_ were furnished, according to request, to\r\nDr. Coues, for use in his “Key to North American Birds.” (R.

Whole upper surface black, deepest on the tail; it occupies\r\nthe whole head (except the chin, throat, and sides of the neck), the\r\nblack cheek-patch having considerable prominence; feathers everywhere\r\n(except on the head and neck) indistinctly bordered with light brownish,\r\nthis becoming more distinct posteriorly; upper tail-coverts tipped and\r\nbarred beneath the surface with pure white; secondaries, primaries,\r\nand primary coverts narrowly but sharply tipped with pure white; tail\r\ncrossed with five very sharp bars of pure white, the last terminal,\r\nthe first two concealed by the coverts; these transverse spots touch\r\nthe shaft, but not the edge of the feather; on the lateral feather\r\nthey are confined to the inner web. Chin, throat, neck, and breast,\r\nabdomen, crissum, and lower tail-coverts, deep orange (not chestnut)\r\nrufous; in fact, this forms the ground-color of the whole lower parts;\r\nbut the sides, flanks, and abdomen have such large transverse spots of\r\nblack (these exceeding the orange in amount), giving the prevailing\r\ncolor; the orange of the jugulum is sharply defined, with a semicircular\r\noutline, against the black of the belly, and has distinct lanceolate\r\nshaft-streaks of black; the lower part of the abdomen, and the tibiæ,\r\nhave cordate or broadly sagittate black spots, rather exceeding the\r\norange; the lower tail-coverts have broad transverse spots of black.\r\n(The orange is deepest on the jugulum and crissum, being palest where\r\nmost thickly spotted; it is immaculate only on chin, throat, and neck;\r\nthe markings are longitudinal only on the jugulum.) Lining of the wing\r\nlike the belly, that is, the black predominating; under surface of\r\nprimaries with transverse elliptical spots of pale cream-color, seven\r\nin number on the longest.

Anteriorly the\r\ntint is almost black, this covering continuously the whole upper and\r\nlateral portion of the head, reaching down to the throat, and forming\r\na broad angular projection over the cheeks, which are purer black. All\r\nthe feathers above darker centrally, but the obscure spots so formed\r\nmostly concealed; shafts of the feathers inconspicuously black; upper\r\ntail-coverts each with two broad transverse spots of black. Secondaries,\r\nprimary coverts, and primaries uniform dull black; the former, and\r\ninner feathers of the latter, very narrowly ashy-whitish on terminal\r\nborder,—the coverts with a bluish shade terminally. Tail black (dull\r\nlight brown at apical margin), crossed with about six obsolete narrow\r\nbands of plumbeous, these changing to narrower white bars on the inner\r\nwebs. Chin, base of maxillæ, throat, sides of the neck, and jugulum,\r\nochraceous-white, the ochraceous tinge deepest posteriorly; breast\r\n(broadly across) and sides black, with numerous narrow transverse bars\r\nof reddish-white, becoming more ashy posteriorly; abdomen, anal region,\r\ntibiæ, femorals, and lower tail-coverts uniform deep, almost castaneous,\r\nrufous. Lining of the wing dull black, with circular ochraceous-white\r\nspots, but former predominating; whole under surface of primaries and\r\nsecondaries a similar blackish-dusky, the former with narrow transverse\r\nelliptical spots of white, of which there are eight (the first and last\r\nmerely indicated) on the longest quill. Wing-formula, 2–1–3. Wing, 7.70;\r\ntail, 3.95; tarsus, 1.20; middle toe, 1.20. Tail slightly emarginated;\r\nsecond and third feathers longest (counting from exterior).\r\n\r\n♀ (5,218, Mazatlan; Colonel Grayson). Almost precisely similar to the\r\nmale; less contrast between blackish-plumbeous of the nape, and more\r\nbluish of the back; bands on tail five in number; bars on black beneath\r\nmore reddish. Wing-formula same. Wing, 8.80; tail, 4.40; tarsus, 1.30;\r\nmiddle toe, 1.30.\r\n\r\n_Juv._ (Bryant Coll. 1,531, Orizaba, Mex.). Above continuous dull black,\r\nwithout bluish cast or concealed spots; tail-bands narrower, purer\r\nwhite; black beneath duller, transverse bars more obsolete, broader,\r\nand pale rusty; chestnut-rufous of posterior lower portions lighter\r\nand less uniform; lower tail-coverts with broad transverse spots of\r\nplumbeous-black. Wing-formula as in adult. Wing, 8.75; tail, 4.40.\r\n\r\nTwo young males from Tehuantepec, Mexico (Nos. 613 and 613, May\r\n16, 1871; F. Sumichrast), differ from that described above in some\r\nremarkable respects: the upper parts are in one black, but without the\r\nrusty margins to the feathers; in the other, almost exactly as in the\r\nadult plumage described. The lower parts, however, are most different;\r\nthe throat and jugular are uniform deep soft ochraceous, with a few\r\nlongitudinal streaks of black near the black abdominal patch; the bars\r\nin this last are deep rufous, and the terminal band of the tail is also\r\ndeep rufous. The weak bill, and soft, blended character of the plumage,\r\nindicate unmistakably the very young age of these specimens, which are\r\nalso marked “very young” by M. Sumichrast.\r\n\r\nIn colors, as well as in size and form, this very handsome little\r\nFalcon closely resembles the _F. severus_, Horsf., of Manilla and the\r\nneighboring East Indian Islands; the main difference is that in that\r\nspecies the lower surface is wholly deep rufous, instead of partly\r\nblack.\r\n\r\n_List of Specimens examined._—National Museum, 11; Boston Society, 6;\r\nPhiladelphia Academy, 7; New York Museum, 3; G.

Bishop).\r\nHead above pure, fine bluish-ash, becoming (broadly) white on forehead;\r\nthe feathers with delicate shaft-lines of black. Nape, back, scapulars,\r\nrump, upper tail-coverts, and tail rich purplish-rufous (almost exactly\r\nas in _sparverius_); no bars on dorsal region, except a very few across\r\nends of larger posterior scapulars. Terminal band of tail _light\r\nrufous_, .30 in width; subterminal zone of black, very regular, .55 in\r\nwidth; lateral feather, with outer web and end of inner, reddish-white,\r\nthe black subterminal band crossing the inner web only; inner web\r\nanterior to this, continuous rufous; shafts of tail-feathers rufous.\r\nWings fine bluish-ash, like the crown; middle and lower coverts with\r\na very few elliptical, _longitudinal_ specks or touches of black on\r\nthe shafts; secondaries passing terminally into white, their exposed\r\nbasal half pure black; primaries pure black, exposed edges of inner\r\nwebs paler. Whole under surface of wings _immaculate_ pure white,\r\nwith a faint delicate reddish tinge; inner webs of primaries serrated\r\nalong the shaft with dusky. Forehead and superciliary stripe (broadly\r\nand sharply defined against the bluish of the crown), whole side of\r\nthe head (including lores and ear-coverts), and entire lower parts,\r\ncontinuous, _immaculate_, pure white, with a delicate orange tinge,\r\nexcept anteriorly. The “mustache” is but just indicated by some blackish\r\ntouches, and in some individuals it is wanting entirely, while in all\r\nit is very restricted in width; the other black markings of the head\r\nare, however, as in _sparverius_. Wing-formula, 2, 3–4, 1. Wing, 7.00;\r\ntail, 5.00; tarsus, 1.30; middle toe, .90; culmen, .46. A specimen in\r\nMr. Lawrence’s collection, which with others he has kindly lent me for\r\nexamination, is in beautifully high plumage. It differs from the type\r\nin having the white of the lower parts tinged, or rather _stained_,\r\nwith a beautiful, delicate _rufous_, or almost a _salmon-orange_. The\r\nterminal band of the tail also inclines decidedly to this color, while\r\nthe white of the under surface of the wing (particularly towards ends of\r\nsecondaries and primaries) is tinged with a more pinkish shade of the\r\nsame. Another of Mr. Lawrence’s specimens differs in the clearer white\r\nbeneath (that is, with less reddish tinge,—the pureness and continuity\r\ndoes not vary), which extends entirely around the neck, giving a\r\nsharper definition to the black pattern. The “mustache,” however, is\r\nalmost entirely absent; the black transverse spots on larger posterior\r\nscapulars are rather more conspicuous, and the terminal band of the tail\r\nis more purely white.\r\n\r\n♀ (31,984, Cuba, J. Ackhurst). Generally similar to _sparverius_, but\r\nrufous brighter, the bars narrower and less numerous; the nape or upper\r\npart of back, and rump, being almost immaculate. Tail with ten black\r\nbars, these scarcely touching the shaft; the last is about .36 wide, the\r\nothers about .16; tip of tail scarcely paler than base; lateral feather\r\nwith outer web edged broadly with paler or ochraceous white, rufous next\r\nthe shaft, immaculate; inner web with only three or four very narrow\r\nbars on terminal half. Head as in the male, but vertex considerably\r\ntinged with rufous. Whole lower parts, including frontal and lateral\r\nregions of the head, continuous pure white; breast with a very faint\r\nyellowish tinge; side of the breast and sides with a few scattered\r\nminute elliptical longitudinal flakes of rusty,—more black on the shaft.\r\nWhole under surface of the wing white, as in the male. Wing-formula, 2,\r\n3–4, 1. Wing, 7.00; tail, 4.70; tarsus, 1.40; middle toe, .90; culmen,\r\n.51. A Cuban female belonging to Mr. Lawrence is exactly similar. One in\r\nthe S. I. Collection, from Hayti (42,420, Port au Prince, June 5, 1860;\r\nA. C. Younglove), differs only in less purely black bars, and in utter\r\nabsence of the mustache. A male from the same locality (43,418) is like\r\nit in the last respect.\r\n\r\n_Juv._ ♀ (34,235, Remedios, Cuba, December, 1864; N. H. Bishop). Similar\r\nto the adult described, but jugulum tinged with soft pinkish-rufous, and\r\nthe black bars on upper parts—especially on wings—with a plumbeous cast.\r\n\r\nIn regard to this form, we must either consider that it is a distinct\r\nspecies, or assume that it is a light phase of a Cuban species, of which\r\n_T. sparveroides_ may be the dark or rufescent form; knowing, as we do,\r\nthat the differences between _leucophrys_ and _sparveroides_ depend on\r\nneither sex, age, nor season, then the only way to account for the two\r\nphases is to consider that the Cuban bird (if we deny it the rank of a\r\nspecies) presents a very peculiar example of dimorphism. I have never\r\nyet seen a specimen which was not decidedly one or the other. An adult\r\nmale from Cuba is immaculate white beneath, the breast very strongly\r\ntinged with deep rufous, the mustache wholly absent. Two females have\r\nnarrow brown streaks on the breast, the mustache nearly obsolete; the\r\ndusky bars on primaries and tail much narrower.\r\n\r\n_List of Specimens examined._—Nat. Mus., 7; Bost.

Above, continuously dark\r\nplumbeous, from bill to the tail, the shafts of the feathers black\r\n(these streaks most noticeable on the head above), the larger scapulars\r\nand interscapulars darker centrally, forming indistinct or obscure\r\nspots; this plumbeous covers the whole neck laterally, and the middle\r\narea of the ear-coverts. An obsolete “mustache” running from the lores\r\ndownward across the cheeks, a spot across ends of the ear-coverts\r\nconnected with that on the neck, and obsolete though continuous collar\r\nround the nape, inclining to black. Primaries wholly black, basal third\r\nof secondaries the same. (No spots on wings.) Tail deep chestnut, shafts\r\nof feathers black; terminal band dull slate; subterminal black zone\r\nabout .60 of an inch in width, but instead of running sharply across, as\r\nin all the varieties of _sparverius_ and in _leucophrys_, the black runs\r\nalong the edge of each feather, bordering it nearly to the base; the\r\nlateral feather has both webs continuous deep chestnut, the tip slate,\r\nthe subterminal spot and shaft black. Chin and throat dull ashy-white;\r\nrest of lower parts continuous deep chestnut-rufous, this palest on the\r\nanal region, and tinged with slate across the jugulum as well as on the\r\nflanks, where there are a very few darker spots. (The chestnut beneath\r\nis unspotted.) Inner webs of primaries mottled along the edge with paler\r\nslate, this running in points toward the shafts, giving an idea of bars.\r\nWing-formula, 2, 3–4, 1.

Head above, dark plumbeous;\r\nfeathers with darker shaft-lines; black stripes of head more sharply\r\ndefined than in the male. Above, continuously deep rufous (brighter\r\nand more ferruginous than in the different styles of _sparverius_),\r\ncontinuously barred, as in var. _sparverius_, but blacker, the bars\r\non upper part of back with tendency to longitudinal direction. Tail\r\nwith twelve narrow, sharply defined bars of black; but the ground-color\r\ncontinuous rufous to the tip, the lateral feather as deeply rufous as\r\nthe middle. Inner webs of primaries deep rusty-rufous, with twelve very\r\nnarrow transverse bars of dusky crossing to the edge. The middle area\r\nof the ear-coverts, with the chin and throat, is dull white; the rest\r\nof the lower parts (including side of the neck) and whole lining of the\r\nwing are deep rusty-rufous, paler on the crissum, nearly white on the\r\nanal region; these regions have no spots, except on the flanks, where\r\nare a few narrow transverse bars. Wing-formula, 2, 3–4, 1. Wing, 7.00;\r\ntail, 4.45; tarsus, 1.30; middle toe, .90; culmen, .51.\r\n\r\n_Juv._ ♂ (39,108, Remedios, Cuba, December 11, 1863; N. H. Bishop).\r\nGeneral appearance of the adult; but back, scapulars, rump, and upper\r\ntail-coverts chestnut-rufous, uniform with the tail; these parts are,\r\nhowever, strongly clouded with more bluish slate, and the blackish spots\r\nare more distinct. The black zone of the tail runs more sharply across,\r\nand is narrower than in the adult. The middle area of the ear-coverts is\r\nnearly as light as the throat. The rufous beneath is less castaneous, as\r\nwell as less continuous, becoming nearly white on abdomen and tibia; the\r\nslaty tinge on the jugulum is wanting. Wing-formula, 3, 2–4, –1. Wing,\r\n6.85; tail, 4.90; tarsus, 1.20; middle toe, .90; culmen, .50.\r\n\r\n♀ (23,546, Monte Verde, Cuba, July 16, 1861; Charles Wright). Differing\r\nfrom the adult in the same respects as does that of _sparverius_, the\r\nchief differences consisting in the deeper chestnut of the tail, and\r\nbroader and blacker bars above. Rufous beneath, with numerous sagittate\r\nspots of black; lower tail-coverts with subterminal bars, and lining\r\nof the wing with sparse streaks of the same. Plumage generally with a\r\nblended appearance. Wing-formula, 2, 3–4=1. Wing, 7.40; tail, 4.85;\r\ntarsus, 1.30; middle toe, .90. Another specimen (No. 23,545, Monte\r\nVerde, July 17, 1861; C. Wright) is much the same, but has distinct\r\nspots of black on the abdomen, and tear-shaped marking of the same on\r\nthe scapulars. The young female of this species bears a remarkably\r\nclose resemblance to the young of _T. punctatus_, Cuv., of Madagascar,\r\nagreeing almost entirely with it in colors, with the exception of those\r\non the tail, the bars on which are black and ash, instead of black and\r\nrufous. Whether it be considered a distinct species or not, the _T.\r\nsparveroides_ certainly grades into the _T. sparverius_, in the very\r\nnear relation of an aberrant condition of the adult phase of the latter,\r\nnoticed in specimens from Florida and adjoining portions of the South\r\nAmerican and Gulf coast, and the young normal or usual plumage of the\r\nformer. As is well known, the young ♂ _sparveroides_ has a reddish\r\nand also more or less barred or spotted back, as in the male of all\r\nthe races of _sparverius_ at all ages; the intermediate or transition\r\ndress of the young male showing cloudings of plumbeous in the rufous,\r\nindicative of the coming uniform plumbeous of perfect maturity. Now,\r\nknowing that a wholly plumbeous dorsal region in the adult, and wholly\r\nor mostly rufous dorsal region in the young male, are characteristic\r\nfeatures of _T. sparveroides_, we are somewhat surprised to find in\r\nadult males of _T. sparverius_ var. _isabellinus_ from Florida, a\r\ngreater or less mixture of plumbeous feathers in various parts of the\r\ndorsal region, particularly in the rump and upper tail-coverts. Many\r\nspecimens from this locality show another approach to the young male\r\nof _sparveroides_ in the deep, unspotted rufous of the lower parts,\r\nsometimes the throat only being white. A young male of _sparveroides_\r\nfrom Cuba, and an adult male of _sparverius_ said to be from Cuba,\r\nare at a cursory glance not distinguishable; a close comparison,\r\nhowever, will disclose the fact, that in the former, the badly defined\r\nhead-markings, nearly obsolete black markings on the wings (including\r\nbasal space of the secondaries, which is conspicuously and sharply\r\ndefined in the other specimen), and the blurred character of the bars\r\nover inner webs of primaries, remain as characters distinguishing the\r\nformer. The lateral tail-feather, too, has its outer web deep rufous,\r\nwhile it is white, black-spotted, in the specimen of _sparverius_.\r\n\r\n_List of Specimens examined._—Nat. Mus., 14; Bost.

Dec. 1870, 149.\r\n\r\n_Hab._ Most of continental South America, except the North Atlantic\r\nand the Caribbean coasts, where replaced by the var. _isabellinus_.\r\nIn Chile and Western Brazil, mixed with, but not replaced by, var. ?\r\n_cinnamominus_.\r\n\r\n_Adult_ ♂ (20,937, Parana; Coll. of the U. S. Paraguay Exp.). Similar\r\nto var. _sparverius_. Head above with the rufous entirely wanting;\r\nrufous of the plumage more vinaceous; black bars of the scapulars almost\r\ntransversely cordate, and nearer the end of the feather; black zone of\r\nthe tail only .60 of an inch wide. Beneath continuously white, with\r\nelliptical spots or streaks of pure black on sides, becoming somewhat\r\ncircular on the flanks. Wing, 7.70; tail, 5.30; tarsus, 1.40; middle\r\ntoe, .92; culmen, .48. In all respects, except the points described,\r\nresembling the true _sparverius_ of North America, of which it is\r\nnothing more than a geographical race, and a not very strongly marked\r\none, though the differences indicated are very constant.\r\n\r\n♀ (50,942, Brazil; Sr. Don Fred. Albuquerque). Very similar to\r\n_sparverius_; the rufous, equally pale, is, however, more vinaceous;\r\nthe tail decidedly less rufescent. The black bars are about the same,\r\nbut on the tail there are thirteen, and the subterminal one is scarcely\r\nbroader than the rest; the lateral tail-feather has the bars only on\r\ninner web, and here almost wanting. Head above as in the male, being\r\nwithout the rufous tinge on the vertex. Beneath yellowish-white, about\r\nlike _sparverius_; the whole breast and side with numerous longitudinal\r\ndashes of deep brown, similar in form to _sparverius_, but of much\r\ndeeper tint. Inner web of longest primary with twelve transverse bars of\r\nwhite, these scarcely exceeding the dusky ones. Wing-formula, 2, 3–4–1.\r\nWing, 7.80; tail, 5.20; tarsus, 1.30; middle toe, .95; culmen, .55.\r\n\r\n_Juv._ ♂ (16,570, Bogota; W. Evans). Differing from the adult in deeper\r\nrufous and broader black bars; those on the tail twelve in number,\r\nmore than doubling in width those of the adult; markings beneath more\r\nblended, darker brown. Differs from young of var. _sparverius_ in\r\nmuch lighter rufous above; less purely black bars; entire absence of\r\nrufous on crown, and narrower shaft-streaks here; less ochraceous-white\r\nbeneath, and less blended markings.\r\n\r\n_List of Specimens examined._—Nat.

Dec. 1870, 149.\r\n\r\n_Hab._ Lesser Antilles north to Porto Rico and St. Thomas.\r\n\r\n_Adult_ ♂ (52,428, St. Bartholemi; Professor Sundevall). Resembling\r\nvar. _isabellinus_ in general appearance, but darker, and more heavily\r\nbarred above; beneath much more spotted. Head above with blackish\r\nshaft-streaks and vertex with a patch of rufous; this, however, somewhat\r\nrestricted. Rufous above, with numerous broad bars of black, these\r\nrunning continuously across and extending anteriorly to the neck; rump\r\neven, with a few very small, transversely sagittate specks of the same.\r\nTail crossed by nine perfectly regular and sharply defined narrow bands\r\nof pure black, anterior to the subterminal zone, which is about .80 of\r\nan inch wide; outer feather white, tinged medially with rufous, barred\r\nwith black to the base. Black spotting in dark cinereous of the wing\r\nvery exaggerated in comparison with var. _sparverius_. Markings beneath\r\nvery numerous, the sides being thickly marked with large cordate or\r\nnearly circular spots of black, these growing larger toward the flanks.\r\nThe rufous of the breast is about as in var. _isabellinus_. Wing, 6.80;\r\ntail, 5.10; tarsus, 1.40; middle toe, .94; culmen, .53. Wing-formula,\r\n3–2–4, 5, 6–1.\r\n\r\n♀ (52,429, St. Bartholemi; Professor Sundevall). Black bands above\r\nexceeding in breadth the rufous ones; each feather of the head above\r\nwith a sharp medial streak of black. Tail with twelve bands of black;\r\nouter feather approaching white. Markings beneath pure black, as in the\r\nmale; their course longitudinal anteriorly, on the sides more circular,\r\ntransverse on the flanks. Wing, 6.70; tail, 5.00; tarsus, 1.30; middle\r\ntoe, 1.00; culmen, .53. Wing-formula, 3, 2–4–1, 5.\r\n\r\nThe male selected for the type is an extreme example; no others have\r\nthe character of the variety presented in a degree as exaggerated as\r\nthis specimen. Nos. 362 (♂) and 170 (♀) of the Bryant Collection from\r\nPorto Rico, and No. 36,554 (♂, St. Thomas; Robert Swift), may be taken\r\nas more perfect, or rather as average representatives of the variety.\r\nThese two males are almost exactly similar. They have the back as\r\nstrongly barred as in the type, and the black spots on the rump are\r\nas noticeable; but the tail, instead of being crossed by regular,\r\nperfectly continuous, sharply defined bands, has these broader and\r\nmore broken, being indicated only by spots along the edge; they also\r\ndecrease in width toward the base. The Porto Rico specimen has very\r\nmuch ashy-white between the two last black bars, this being found on\r\nthe four lateral feathers; between the next two, on three feathers,\r\netc. The other specimen, however, is destitute of this ashy-white,\r\nalthough the outer web of the lateral feather is pure white,—spotted,\r\nhowever, with black. In the Porto Rico specimen the breast is as deeply\r\nochraceous as in the _isabellinus_ style; but the spots are larger\r\nand more numerous even than in any examples of _sparverius_. A female\r\nfrom here differs from the type only in a few unimportant points, the\r\nprincipal difference being in the markings beneath. In this there is a\r\ngeneral ochraceous wash on the lower parts, the markings linear only\r\non the breast, becoming tear-shaped and circular on the sides, and\r\ntransverse on the flanks; the red patch on the crown is quite extensive.\r\nIn the whole series the third quill is longest, and the bill is, in\r\nall, considerably longer than in any specimen of _sparverius_ excepting\r\nthose from Florida. Another female from St. Thomas (36,551; Robert\r\nSwift) is almost exactly like the one from Porto Rico; the rufous of\r\nthe crown covers nearly the whole top of the head, and is quite bright.\r\nIn a series of skins belonging to Mr. Newton, deposited in the S. I.\r\nCollection, we find a pair of this variety from the island of St. Croix,\r\nW. I. They are perfectly typical examples. The male (“May 2, 1857,\r\nB. B.”) has the large black spots of the side transversely cordate; the\r\nbands on the tail are broken into spots on edges of the feathers; the\r\nfemale (“s. p. 227, B. 6”) is in nearly all respects like the specimen\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n_List of Specimens examined._—Nat.

Somewhat like var. _australis_; in fact,\r\nresembling this in general appearance. Head above, however, very dark\r\ndull plumbeous, with very distinct shaft-streaks of black. Back and\r\nscapulars sparsely barred with black, the bars broadest posteriorly.\r\nTail much brighter rufous than the back; continuous rufous to the\r\nextreme tip; a very narrow subterminal band of black, .30 of an inch\r\nwide, crossing about .55 of an inch from the tip, making the terminal\r\ndeep rufous, nearly twice as wide as the black; toward the outer\r\nfeathers the black is thrown into a spot on each web, scarcely touching\r\nthe shaft; on the lateral feather the black is lacking entirely, the\r\ninner web being continuous rufous, the outer paler, inclining to\r\nochraceous-white. Primaries conspicuously white terminally; inner\r\nwebs white, with transverse bars of dusky; there being on the longest\r\n(second) ten spaces of white, these more than twice the width of the\r\ndusky bars; lining of the wing creamy-white, with minute streaks of\r\nblack sparsely distributed. Forehead more hoary than the crown; lores\r\nwhite. Ear-coverts, neck, and entire lower parts, continuous dull white;\r\nbreast with a few minute black streaks; flanks with more expanded\r\ntear-shaped dashes of the same.

Forehead, crown,\r\nocciput, and wings brownish-black; middle wing-coverts fainter, with\r\nobscure whitish bars; primaries white in the middle (just beyond\r\nthe coverts), this portion having obsolete washes of grayish, in\r\nform of faintly indicated transverse bars; basal three-fourths of\r\nthe tail white, with numerous narrow, washed bars of grayish, these\r\nbecoming more faint toward the base; tail with a terminal zone of\r\nblack, about two inches broad. Cheeks, chin, and throat soiled white,\r\nunvaried; body in general (including neck, breast, sides, abdomen,\r\nback, and scapulars) transversely barred with black and white, the\r\nwhite prevailing anteriorly; beneath, the black bars grow gradually\r\nwider posteriorly, giving the tibiæ and femorals a uniformly blackish\r\nappearance; on the back and scapulars also the black bars exceed\r\nthe white in width, but they are very sharply defined, regular, and\r\ncontinuous; rump, upper and lower tail-coverts, white, with numerous\r\nfaint bars of grayish. Under side of the wing black; outer six primaries\r\nwhite in the middle portion, beyond the coverts, this patch extending\r\nobliquely across; secondaries rather broadly barred on basal two-thirds\r\nwith black and white, leaving the terminal third unvaried. Third quill\r\nlongest; fourth scarcely shorter; second intermediate between fifth and\r\nsixth; first a little longer than seventh. Wing, 16.00; tail, 6.50;\r\ntarsus, 3.50; middle toe, 1.75.\r\n\r\n_Young_ (13,923, South America; T. R. Peale). Forehead, crown, occiput,\r\nnape, back, wings, and lower parts dark sepia-brown; feathers of the\r\nbreast, sides, and abdomen marked centrally with a broad longitudinal\r\nstripe of soiled fulvous-white; those of nape and back more obsoletely\r\nstriped, and variegated irregularly at ends with the same; wing-coverts\r\npassing terminally into pale brownish; secondaries obscurely barred with\r\nthe same. Cheeks, chin, and throat unvariegated soiled white; tibial\r\nfeathers with shaft-stripes of pale fulvous. Rump, tail-coverts, and\r\ntail as in adult. Several specimens from Buenos Ayres (Conchitas; Wm.\r\nH. Hudson), and one from Paraguay (59,236; T. J. Page, U. S.

Tail as in var.\r\n_borealis_. Wing, 16.00; tail, 9.00; tarsus, 3.20; middle toe, 1.80.\r\nBill very high, abruptly curved. Wing-formula, 4, 5, 3, 6, 2; first,\r\nshortest.\r\n\r\nThis very curious variety is that which departs furthest from the\r\ntrue _borealis_; not only the details, but in a measure the pattern,\r\nof coloration, being greatly modified. The perfectly continuous pure\r\nbrownish-black of the whole head and neck, sharply contrasted with\r\nthe white throat-patch, are features which distinguish it from every\r\nother variety of this group; while the deep rufous tibiæ, and almost\r\nutter absence of transverse bars beneath, are also very distinctive\r\ncharacters.\r\n\r\nThe second of the two Costa Rican specimens before me (No. 33,507; J.\r\nCarmiol) differs from the type in having the white of the pectoral area\r\nclouded by an encroachment of the blackish of the neck; and across\r\nthe abdomen is a deep wash of the same. The tail-feathers exhibit\r\nindications of spots along the shafts, as in var. _calurus_; while the\r\nupper tail-coverts have a very few bars of blackish.\r\n\r\n_Young_ (37,338, Tres Marias Islands, January; Col. A. J. Grayson).\r\nSimilar to the adult in general appearance, but differing in the\r\nfollowing particulars: Tail deep umber, with about twelve or thirteen\r\nnarrow bands of black, and very narrowly tipped with whitish;\r\nlateral lower parts thickly spotted with blackish, and tibiæ spotted\r\ntransversely with the same; lower tail-coverts with distant bars of\r\nblackish.

II, 1857, 83.\r\n\r\n[107] _Zenaidura yucatanensis_, LAWR. Ann. N. Y. IX, 1869. This bird\r\nis so exactly intermediate between the _Z. carolinensis_ and _Zenaida\r\namabilis_, as to lead us to strongly suspect it is a hybrid between\r\nthe two. With the _Z. carolinensis_ it agrees only in possessing\r\nfourteen tail-feathers; the coloration and size and shape of the bill\r\nbeing exactly those of _Z. amabilis_, while the tail-feathers are\r\nintermediate in length and shape between those of the two species.\r\nThe colors differ from those of _Z. amabilis_ only in being of a just\r\nappreciably lighter shade, there being the same broad white tip to the\r\nsecondaries, brilliant steel-blue sub-auricular spot, and deep reddish\r\ncrissum, characterizing the _Z. amabilis_, as distinguished from _Z.\r\ncarolinensis_.\r\n\r\n[108] _Zenaidura graysoni_, LAWR.

I,\r\n73.\r\n\r\n[114] As with nearly all the animals which have been brought under\r\ndomestication by man, the true origin of the common barnyard Turkey\r\nwas for a long time a matter of uncertainty. As a well-known writer\r\n(Martin) observes: “So involved in obscurity is the early history of the\r\nTurkey, and so ignorant do the writers of the sixteenth and seventeenth\r\ncenturies appear to have been about it, that they have regarded it as\r\na bird known to the ancients by the name of _Meleagris_ (really the\r\nGuinea-fowl or Pintado), a mistake which was not cleared up till the\r\nmiddle of the eighteenth century. The appellation of “turkey,” which\r\nthis bird bears in England, arose from the supposition that it came\r\noriginally from the country of that name,—an idea entirely erroneous,\r\nas it owes its origin to the New World. Mexico was first discovered\r\nby Grigalva in 1518. Oviedo speaks of the Turkey as a kind of Peacock\r\nabounding in New Spain, which had already in 1526 been transported in a\r\ndomestic state to the West India Islands and the _Spanish Main_, where\r\nit was kept by the Christian colonists.”\r\n\r\nIt is reported to have been introduced into England in 1541. In 1573 it\r\nhad become the Christmas fare of the farmer.\r\n\r\nAmong the luxuries belonging to the high condition of civilization\r\nexhibited by the Mexican nation at the time of the Spanish conquest was\r\nthe possession by Montezuma of one of the most extensive zoölogical\r\ngardens on record, numbering nearly all the animals of that country,\r\nwith others brought at much expense from great distances, and it is\r\nstated that Turkeys were supplied as food in large numbers daily to\r\nthe beasts of prey in the menagerie of the Mexican emperor. No idea\r\ncan be formed at the present day of the date when this bird was first\r\nreclaimed in Mexico from its wild condition, although probably it had\r\nbeen known in a domestic state for many centuries. There can, however,\r\nbe no question of the fact that it was habitually reared by the Mexicans\r\nat the time of the conquest, and introduced from Mexico or New Spain\r\ninto Europe early in the sixteenth century, either directly or from the\r\nWest India Islands, into which it had been previously carried.\r\n\r\nIt has, however, always been a matter of surprise that the Wild Turkey\r\nof eastern North America did not assimilate more closely to the domestic\r\nbird in color, habits, and by interbreeding, although until recently no\r\nsuspicion was entertained that they might belong to different species.\r\nSuch, however, now appears to be the fact, as I will endeavor to show.\r\n\r\nThe proposition I present is, that there are two species, or at least\r\nraces, of Wild Turkey in North America,—one confined to the more eastern\r\nand southern United States, the other to the southern Rocky Mountains\r\nand adjacent part of Texas, New Mexico, Colorado, and Arizona; that the\r\nlatter extends along Eastern Mexico as far south at least as Orizaba,\r\nand that it is from this Mexican species, and not from that of eastern\r\nNorth America, that this domestic Turkey is derived.\r\n\r\nIn the Proceedings of the Zoölogical Society of London for 1856 (page\r\n61), Mr. Gould characterizes as new a Wild Turkey from the mines of\r\nReal del Norte, in Mexico, under the name of _Meleagris mexicana_, and\r\nis the first to suggest that it is derived from the domesticated bird,\r\nand not from the common Wild Turkey of eastern North America, on which\r\nhe retains the name of _M. gallopavo_, of Linnæus. He stated that the\r\npeculiarities of the new species consist chiefly in the creamy-white\r\ntips of the tail-feathers and of the upper tail-coverts, with some\r\nother points of minor importance. I suggest that the Wild Turkey of New\r\nMexico, as referred to by various writers, belongs to this new species,\r\nand not to the _M. gallopavo_.\r\n\r\nIn 1858, in the Report on the birds collected by the Pacific Railroad\r\nExpedition (Vol. IX, p. 618, of the series of Pacific Railroad Reports),\r\nI referred to this subject, and established the existence in North\r\nAmerica of two species of Wild Turkey,—one belonging to eastern, the\r\nother to middle, North America. Much additional material has since\r\ncorroborated this view, and while the _M. gallopavo_ is found along the\r\nMissouri River and eastward, and extends into Eastern Texas, the other\r\nis now known to belong to the Llano Estacado and other parts of Western\r\nTexas, to New Mexico, and to Arizona.\r\n\r\nThe recent acquisition of a fine male Turkey by the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution from the vicinity of Mount Orizaba, in Mexico, and its\r\ncomparison with a skin from Santa Fé, enables me to assert the positive\r\nidentity of our Western and the Mexican species, and one readily\r\nseparable from the better known wild bird of the eastern United States.\r\nThere is now little reason to doubt that the true origin of the barnyard\r\nTurkey is to be sought for in the Mexican species, and not in the North\r\nAmerican,—an hypothesis which explains the fact of the difficulty in\r\nestablishing a cross between our wild and tame birds.\r\n\r\nThe presumed differences between the two species may be briefly\r\nindicated as consisting principally in the creamy or fulvous white of\r\nthe tips of the tail-feathers and of the feathers overlying the base of\r\nthe tail and of the hinder part of the back of the Mexican and typical\r\nbarnyard birds, as compared with the decided chestnut-brown of the same\r\nparts in the eastern Wild Turkey. There are other differences, but they\r\nare less evident, and those indicated will readily serve to distinguish\r\nthe two species.\r\n\r\nThe true wild bird of eastern North America always has the tips of the\r\ntail-feathers and upper tail-covert of a chestnut-brown color; the\r\nMexican species and its descendant of the barnyard never exhibit this\r\nfeature.\r\n\r\nSometimes this domesticated bird is exactly like its wild original,\r\ndiffering only in rather greater development of the fatty lobes of the\r\nhead and neck; and of this an example may be seen in the Museum of the\r\nSmithsonian Institution.\r\n\r\nThere is a variety of the domestic bird which is entirely black,\r\nsometimes even including the larger quills, which in both species are\r\nnaturally banded with white, and in this there may be little or no\r\ntrace of any bands at the end of the tail and of its upper coverts; but\r\nwhatever may be the asseverations of the sportsman, the poultry-dealer,\r\nor the farmer, as to the “wildness” of any particular bird, or what\r\nthe circumstances attendant upon its capture or death by trapping,\r\nshooting, or otherwise, implicit confidence may be placed in the test\r\nabove indicated, namely: if the tips of tail and tail-covert are\r\nchestnut-brown, the specimen belongs to the _M. gallopavo_ or “Wild\r\nTurkey”; if the same part is either entirely black or any shade of\r\nwhitish or light fulvous, then it is a “barnyard” fowl.\r\n\r\nThe following extract from a letter written by Dr. Sartorius, the\r\naccomplished naturalist, to whom the Smithsonian Institution owes the\r\nspecimen of the wild Mexican bird referred to above, will be read with\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n“MIRADOR, STATE OF VERA CRUZ,\r\nJanuary 20, 1867.\r\n\r\n“I am entirely of your opinion in regard to the origin of the domestic\r\nTurkey, as our wild bird differs from the tame only in the less amount\r\nof development of the fatty lobes of the head and neck.\r\n\r\n“_Meleagris mexicana_ is tolerably abundant in this neighborhood,\r\nbelonging more especially to the sparsely overgrown savannas between the\r\nregion of the oaks and the coast, the Tierra Caliente or ‘warm region’\r\nproper. It is a very shy bird, living in families like the wild Geese,\r\nand keeping sentinels on the watch whenever the flock is feeding in the\r\nvicinity of threatened danger. It derives its nourishment from plants\r\nand insects on the ground, and scratches with its feet to aid in the\r\nsearch for food. In running, the swiftest dog cannot overtake it. It is\r\nnot very fond of taking to flight, but its powers in this respect are\r\nnot behind those of any of the allied forms. Its breeding-season is in\r\nMarch or April, when the hens separate from the males to reunite into\r\nfamilies again in September. Their general habits during this season\r\nare much as with the domestic bird, although I cannot say whether they\r\ninflate and swell themselves out in the same manner. I am, however,\r\ninclined to doubt it, as the specimen I have handled did not have the\r\ntips of the wing-feathers worn away as in the barn-yard breed. The\r\nfemale lays from three to twelve brownish-red, spotted eggs in the high\r\ngrain, and hatches them out in thirty days, as is the case with the tame\r\nTurkey. The flesh of the wild bird is dry, but very sweet, like the tame\r\nfowl, and like the latter is dark on the back and legs, and white on the\r\nbreast and wings.\r\n\r\n“The white meat of the flesh on the breast of the Mexican and the tame\r\nTurkey, as compared with the darker meat of the common North American\r\nwild bird, is a fact of importance to be taken into consideration.\r\n\r\n“The exact distribution of the Mexican Wild Turkey southward and\r\nwestward is not ascertained, nor is it known that it occupies the\r\nwestern portion of the Mexican country. In Yucatan and Northern\r\nGuatemala it is replaced by a third species, the Ocellated Turkey\r\n(_Meleagris ocellata_), rather less in size, but far more striking in\r\nappearance, being marked in the tail with spots somewhat like the ‘eyes’\r\nof the tail of the Peacock. The three species thus belong to Mexico and\r\nnorthern parts of Central America.\r\n\r\n“Very truly yours,\r\n\r\n“C.
