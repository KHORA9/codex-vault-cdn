C.\r\nOpening each session with this gavel has been a custom of this\r\norganization for many, many years.\r\n\r\nWe are very anxious to have you folks meet some of the men who have made\r\nour meeting possible here at Rochester. I would first like to introduce\r\nMr. W. Stephen Thomas, Director of the Rochester Museum of Arts and\r\nSciences. Mr. Thomas.\r\n\r\nMR. THOMAS: Thank you, Mr. Best.\r\n\r\nWe are always glad to welcome groups such as yours. You represent a\r\nunique organization to us with interests not in our field. We are a\r\npublic institution, and are glad to have you here.\r\n\r\nI feel there are many things of interest in this museum and in our\r\nprogram to interest you, because you are horticulturists and people\r\ninterested in the out-of-doors.\r\n\r\nThis museum is owned by the City of Rochester. By the way, there are\r\nonly about 12 museums throughout the country that are supported as we\r\nare. We get 98 per cent of our funds from the City of Rochester. It is\r\nnot endowed. It is the people's museum. In the exhibit upstairs are\r\nthree dimensional models showing the evolution of the Genesee Valley in\r\nNew York from early times to the present. Here you will see a beautiful\r\npanorama of what it looked like two hundred million years ago right\r\nwhere we are sitting and standing now when the seas overlay the area\r\nduring the Devonian and Silurian times. We have reconstructed the little\r\nsea creatures that lived in the rocks in their natural colors.\r\n\r\nAnother exhibit is the Indian story, primitive man, not just before the\r\nwhite man came, but going back 1500 years. On the top floor you may see\r\nhow the pioneer man worked here as a woodcutter and running flour mills\r\nand how the city came about. The whole story of our region is in the\r\nmuseum.\r\n\r\nBut more important than these exhibits is what we do through the\r\neducational system; adult lectures, and so forth. That is just a little\r\nbackground of our work. I know you have your important business at hand,\r\nbut I hope you will have a little time to view the exhibits. We want to\r\nhelp you in any way we can. If there is anything we can do, don't fail\r\nto ask.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT BEST: Thank you, Mr. Thomas. Most of you met Mr. Wilbur Wright\r\nlast night out at the park. He is going to make an address of welcome\r\nfrom the City of Rochester and from the parks. Mr. Wright.\r\n\r\nMR. WRIGHT: Ladies and gentlemen, on behalf of the City of Rochester and\r\nthe Park Department, we want to welcome you to The Friendly City. We\r\nwant you to feel that Rochester has its hand out for a wide open welcome\r\nfor anything we can do to make you happy while you are here.\r\n\r\nThe parks are particularly interested in the fact that you have chosen\r\nRochester as your conference city for 1953. The parks, as you know, are\r\na good deal like the museum. They are botanical collections in the heart\r\nof the city, the money coming from the city; the taxpayers pay the bill.\r\nWe have a tremendous botanical collection here, and are known the\r\ncountry over for our lilac and other collections.\r\n\r\nWe have, in the past two years, appointed Bernard Harkness to take\r\ncharge of our plant collections, with the title of taxonomist. It took\r\nquite a bit of backing to get Civil Service to break down and make such\r\na title. There wasn't such a title in the State of New York, and they\r\ncouldn't understand why they should give it.\r\n\r\nMr. Grant is another good Cornellian coming along as Assistant\r\nSuperintendent of Parks, and he is, again, looking after the maintenance\r\nand upkeep of the various plant materials that we have.\r\n\r\nWe have a very large organization here, the Parks Division includes the\r\ncemeteries, 90,000 street trees, 56 playgrounds, and about 2,000 acres\r\nof parks. Our peak employment is 756 people. All-in-all we have a\r\ntremendous amount of interest in our parks, and they are increasing. We\r\nare exchanging plants with about 25 foreign countries right now, and we\r\nexpect to expand that now with the various facilities we are setting up\r\nat our new herbarium, which you visited last night.\r\n\r\nWe are proud of Rochester, and the park system. We are doing our best to\r\ncontinue the excellent work of Dunbar, Laney, and Slavin who built up\r\nthe park collections. Our aim is to increase the collections, and make\r\nthe park system better for the people to enjoy. We hope you have a fine\r\ntime while you are here. Thank you.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT BEST: Dr. MacDaniels, ex-president of our Association will\r\ngive our organization's response.\r\n\r\nDR. MACDANIELS: Chairman Best, Director Thomas and Director Wright, I\r\ndon't know whether I am particularly well qualified for this particular\r\nassignment, but I am certainly very happy to express the thanks of the\r\nNorthern Nut Growers Association for the excellent cooperation in\r\narranging the facilities which we have found here in Rochester. Few of\r\nus can recall any situation in which the Association has been helped all\r\nalong the way, as they have been here, and we feel most welcome in this\r\ntruly friendly city.\r\n\r\nBefore the meeting I thought I was going to be able to claim a sort of\r\npaternal interest in the training of Director Wright in that he studied\r\njust prior to the war in the Department of Floriculture and Ornamental\r\nHorticulture at Cornell University where I am stationed. Although we saw\r\na good deal of him after the war, he came directly here, so I can't say\r\nthat I knew him \"way back when\" he was an undergraduate student. Still\r\nwe do have a proprietary interest in all Cornellians, and we like to see\r\nthe home team make good as has certainly been the case here.\r\n\r\nFortunately, Ithaca is close enough to Rochester, so that our classes\r\ncan come to the Rochester parks on field trips where we have always\r\nreceived the most friendly cooperation and help just as the Northern Nut\r\nGrowers is receiving today. I assure you that we are most grateful.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT BEST: We will proceed with the business of the organization.\r\nOn the Resolutions Committee which will give us resolutions for adoption\r\nat our final night session, I appoint Mr. Davidson, Mr. Allaman, Mr.\r\nOakes and Mr. Snyder.\r\n\r\nThe next item of business is the election of a Nominating Committee.\r\nThis committee is to nominate the officers which will be elected at our\r\nnext annual meeting. Nominations are now in order.\r\n\r\nDR. MCKAY: I nominate Mr. Machovina.\r\n\r\nMR. DAVIDSON: Mr. Silvis.\r\n\r\nDR. CRANE: I'd like to nominate Mr. Salzer.\r\n\r\nMR. DAVIDSON: I think Dr. Crane ought to be nominated.\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: I nominate Mr. Kyle from Iowa.\r\n\r\nDR. DOWELL: I move nominations be closed.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT BEST: Is there a second to Dr. Dowell's motion that\r\nnominations be closed? (Motion seconded and passed.)\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT BEST: Nominations are closed. Those in favor of this list, Mr.\r\nKyle, Dr. Crane, Mr. George Salzer, Mr. Silvis, Mr. Machovina, for\r\nNominating Committee for next year make it known by saying \"Aye.\"\r\n(Chorus of \"ayes\") Opposed? (None.)\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT BEST: May we have the report of the Program Committee. They\r\nhave been at work, we can see that. The evidence is on every hand. Dr.\r\nMcKay?\r\n\r\nDR. MCKAY: The program you have in your hands represents the work of the\r\nProgram Committee. The work of the Program Committee is done prior to\r\nthe meeting and I want to say that this year I really did have fine\r\ncooperation from the members and from the members of the committee in\r\nresponding to requests for numbers on the program. That always makes the\r\nwork of a committee easy. Because of this fine cooperation I can say\r\ntruthfully that the effort on my part was relatively small.\r\n\r\nAs all of you know, we now have a larger group of people to draw from\r\nfor our programs than formerly. We always go back, of course, to our\r\ntried and true members who, year after year, give us numbers for the\r\nprogram, but we also like to give the new members a chance and recruit\r\nfrom new sources whenever possible. I haven't analyzed the program\r\nenough to know exactly how many new members are listed on the program\r\nthis year, but I think you will find a few, and as the organization\r\ncontinues to grow, it will be desirable to use these new sources of\r\ninformation for items on the program as much as we can.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT BEST: That's fine. I don't think we can emphasize that too\r\nmuch, this new-member proposition.\r\n\r\nWe are ready now for the report of the Secretary, Mr. Chase.\r\n\r\nMR. CHASE: About the only report that I have to make is one that was\r\nprepared by Mr. Carl Prell, and I don't see why in the world he didn't\r\ngive it, since it's such a fine job of getting together the information\r\non membership. I am going to try to sum this up for you, in order that\r\nyou will know the progress we made in the membership drive to which so\r\nmany of you contributed.\r\n\r\nOn the books as of today we have 1013 paid up members. (Applause.) In\r\naddition to that, we have 15 more who will begin membership the\r\nbeginning of our fiscal year, and in addition to that, there are ten\r\nmore too new to be acknowledged yet. So we are in pretty good shape on\r\nmembership.\r\n\r\nNew members total is 455, which is, I think, just about double from last\r\nyear, if my memory serves me correctly. Leader in the members by state\r\nis our good, old friend Ohio with 126. They produced 42 new members this\r\nyear. Second on the list is Illinois, with 102, and they came up with 38\r\nnew members.\r\n\r\nDR. MACDANIEL: I think this is the first year we have had a hundred\r\nmembers from any state.\r\n\r\nMR. CHASE: Pennsylvania has 83, with 26 new members. New York 78, with\r\n27 new members. Indiana 70 with 31 new members. Michigan 58 with 28 new\r\nmembers. That covers the top six states.\r\n\r\nDuring the year we lost 71 members. That breaks down to five deceased,\r\n12 resigned and 54 that we haven't heard from. Out of the 12 that\r\nresigned, seven were one-year old and only 5 older members. Now, of the\r\n54 not heard from, 40 were one-year members and 14 were older members.\r\nTotal loss is 71, actually. We had 14 reinstatements this year.\r\n\r\nDoes anyone have a question on membership? There are quite a few folks\r\nin the Association who are really working hard to get new members, and a\r\ngreat number have come up with at least one. But, actually, I believe,\r\nCarl, it's a very small percentage of the membership that's really\r\nworking, is that correct?\r\n\r\nMR. PRELL: I am afraid so.\r\n\r\nMR. CHASE: And the 71 lost, you considered about normal, didn't you? We\r\nhave to figure on losing about 10 per cent. Well, we can't afford to\r\nlose a hundred.\r\n\r\nI don't have too much to report as Secretary, except we might briefly\r\nreview this hectic year since the little sub-zero walnut story appeared\r\nin the Farm Journal. In June a year ago I received a request for an\r\narticle on the hardy English walnut. I handled it as a routine request\r\nand sent it to the Farm Journal. Of course, Joe McDaniel was secretary,\r\nand I referred all the interested readers to him for further\r\ninformation. The first batch of mail hit Joe right after our meeting in\r\nRockport, and he had 1500 inquiries within two weeks. I forgot to warn\r\nhim that this might be coming up, and he went ahead and handled about\r\n1500 of these inquiries, and then I don't know what happened to him, he\r\nstarted sending them down to me. Between myself, my secretary, my wife,\r\nand my boy we handled the other 4,000, and they are still, as Joe says,\r\nactually coming in.\r\n\r\nTo handle that, took some of our funds as you see under \"promotion\r\nbusiness\", in the treasurer's report. The mimeographing was gratis, also\r\nthe assembling and mailing, but the postage we had to pay for.\r\n\r\nSo all we have to show for that is about how many members, Carl?\r\n\r\nMR. PRELL: I will say 200.\r\n\r\nMR. CHASE: That's about right. As these inquiries came in we compiled\r\nlists of names and sent them to Mr. Best. Then Mr. Best mimeographed a\r\nletter and some other material, along with an application folder and\r\nfollowed up these inquiries except the last 500. So we hit them once\r\nwith a three-page information sheet from the Secretary's office, then\r\nMr. Best at least once again with a follow-up letter, and out of almost\r\n5,000 we get about 200 members, which is pretty good. And there are a\r\nlot of other folks I know would join if somebody would contact them.\r\n\r\nMR. CHASE: So ever since last October I don't know what side is up so\r\nfar as N.N.G.A. is concerned. I don't pretend it hasn't taken a good\r\ndeal of effort and a lot of time from some things that I should have\r\ndone, but I enjoyed doing it for the Association, and I have no regrets.\r\nThe only thing I am sorry about is that we didn't get 500 instead of\r\njust 200 members.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT BEST: Thank you. Spencer. (Applause.) That's a fine report.\r\n\r\nMay we hear from our Auditing Committee, Mr. Silvis.\r\n\r\nMR. SILVIS: The report of the Treasurer, which I have just had an\r\nopportunity of inspecting, is the most professional document I have ever\r\nhad the pleasure of examining as a member of this Auditing Committee on\r\nwhich I have been several times. And I think a testimonial is due our\r\nTreasurer, Mr. Carl Prell, who has combined the rare talents of\r\nbookkeeping and comparative reporting.\r\n\r\nThe Auditing Committee, composed of Sterling Smith, who was not able to\r\nbe here, Mr. Pape of Indiana, and myself, accept this report of Carl\r\nPrell on behalf of this Northern Nut Growers Association,\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT BEST: Let's have the Treasurer's report. Mr. Prell\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nReport of the Treasurer\r\n\r\nCARL PRELL, _South Bend, Indiana_\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of this fiscal year it seemed likely to your Board of\r\nDirectors that the Association's investment in government bonds would\r\nhave to be converted into cash to meet the year's expenses. There was\r\nbarely enough money in the treasury to pay for the 42nd Annual Report,\r\nwhich should have been billed the preceding year.\r\n\r\nNormally, the treasurer collects only enough money to pay for one\r\nreport, plus the year's operating expenses. The problem this year was to\r\npay operating expenses and to discharge our obligation on two reports.\r\n\r\nAnticipating this problem, and in an effort to correct recurring\r\ndeficits, your Board made plans back in 1951 for a drive to increase\r\nmembership. Some momentum was gained by the end of last year, which\r\ncarried into this year with increasing force. The result was the\r\nsubstantial gain in membership reported upon by your Secretary--with a\r\nsubstantial increase in revenue.\r\n\r\nMembership drives, of course, are a mixed blessing. They may produce\r\nmore dues; but they certainly cost money. Our promotion expenditure\r\njumped from practically nothing in 1951 to $115 in 1952 to $620 in 1953.\r\nHowever, our dues collection from new members thus gained, were more\r\nthan $1200 in 1953 alone--twice as much as was spent. And it is\r\nimportant to note that an expenditure to gain a member is made only\r\n_once_, whereas the member's dues continue year after year.\r\n\r\nIn any event, increased membership was a factor in keeping us from\r\ncashing our reserves.\r\n\r\nAnother important factor was the very generous response of the\r\nmembership to a plea for Sustaining and Contributing dues. Thirty\r\npercent of our old members responded with $10.00 payments for\r\nContributing Memberships or $5.00 payments for Sustaining Memberships.\r\nThis help was needed. It is deserving of special mention in this report.\r\n\r\nOne other factor contributed to successful operation this year, as it\r\nhas in other years. This factor does not show up in figures in a\r\nfinancial statement for the simple reason that the figures are modestly\r\nwithheld from the treasurer. I refer to the out-of-pocket and unreported\r\nexpenditures of officers and committeemen, which expenditures sometimes\r\nare sizeable. Certainly they were this year. The fact that such\r\ncontributions were made should be noted.\r\n\r\nThe sum total of all this is a financial showing for the year that may\r\nbe considered satisfactory. Our debts are all paid. No bonds were\r\ncashed. Nothing was borrowed. And we have money in the bank.\r\n\r\nAt this time last year we had a cash balance of $1313.78. Today our\r\nbalance is $303.70. We spent $1,000 more than we took in. But we paid\r\nfor two Annual Reports. The lesser report cost $1200. If this were\r\nsubtracted from this year's business, where it does not belong, our cash\r\nbalance would be $1500.00. In short, on this year's business--even with\r\nall its unusual expenses for promotion--our income was more than our\r\ndisbursements--by $200.00. This reverses the deficit trend of recent\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n   _RECEIPTS_\r\n     Membership Dues                                            $3,638.05\r\n     Sale of Annual Reports                                        394.00\r\n     Advertising in Nutshell                                       110.00\r\n     Contributions                                                  39.00\r\n     Interest on Government Bonds                                   37.50\r\n                                                                _________\r\n       TOTAL                                                    $4,218.55\r\n\r\n   _DISBURSEMENTS_\r\n     42nd Annual Report (Urbana)                                $1,205.53\r\n       Printing (1000 copies)                       $1,050.00\r\n       Reporting (addi. billing)                        97.05\r\n       Postage & Addressing                             58.48\r\n     43rd Annual Report (Rockport)                              $1,760.72\r\n       Printing (1200 copies)                       $1,477.42\r\n       Envelopes, 800                                   19.60\r\n       Reporting                                       100.00\r\n       Postage & Addressing                            163.70\r\n     The Nutshell\r\n       Printing, 4 issues                                          353.11\r\n     American Fruit Grower                                          39.00\r\n       73 Subscriptions at 50c                          36.50\r\n        2 Subscriptions at 75c                           1.50\r\n        1 Subscription at 1.00                           1.00\r\n     Association Promotion                                         620.47\r\n       Application folder, printing 11,200             164.28\r\n       Stationery for Sub-Zero and V.

The membership promotion consisted of\r\na campaign called the \"Vice-president's Campaign\" sparkplugged by Mr.\r\nBest. Thousands of letters were sent out through the vice-president's\r\nand from the president's office to the membership. You may have received\r\nsome of them. In addition to that, thousands of other letters were sent\r\nout to people who had responded to a story that appeared in Farm Journal\r\nwanting to know about the Association. I can't calculate how many went\r\nout, I have never been told, but I would guess about 5,000 of them. And\r\nthose all went out from Mr. Best's office. In addition, our\r\naddressograph plate system was not in very good shape, due to the fact\r\nthe organization was too poor to keep it up. Mr. Best supplied\r\naddressograph plates for the whole list.\r\n\r\nI wrote to Mr. Best on April 27th, as I wanted all the bad news, and I\r\nwrote to some other people. I said, \"You have not yet rendered a bill\r\nfor postage on your mailing. Will you please make your request?\" And he\r\nanswered,\r\n\r\n\"I was surprised you asked about the postage charge from here. It has\r\nbeen my intent from the beginning of the campaign to carry the postage\r\ncharge myself.\"\r\n\r\nThank you very much.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT BEST: Carl, I know you have done a lot of hard work, and I'd\r\nlike to say for the organization that we do appreciate what you have\r\ndone for us.\r\n\r\nI see Mr. Slate has come in back here. Mr. Slate have you a word from\r\nthe Publications Committee?\r\n\r\nMR. SLATE: I have no formal report. The part of the Publications\r\nCommittee with which I am concerned is the proceedings. The speed with\r\nwhich that job was done depends upon how fast the papers come in and the\r\ntranscript of the proceedings finished. The transcript is rather\r\ncomplicated and a lot of things are said that shouldn't go into the\r\nreport. It takes a lot of work with the blue pencil to boil the material\r\ndown to something that's useful and worth paying a printing bill for.\r\n\r\nOne other thing that I should mention is the cost of mailing. I don't\r\nknow whether that has been mentioned previously or not. We had a little\r\ndifficulty with the Post Office Department. Carl Prell can tell you\r\nabout that.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT BEST: Yes, he did. I have heard only good reports of your fine\r\njob. I think we all agree that it was a scholarly production.\r\n\r\nDo we have anything from the Survey Committee?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBlossoming Habits of the Persian Walnut\r\n\r\nH. F. STOKE, _Roanoke, Va._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Survey Committee, as its project for the current year, has\r\nundertaken a study of the blossoming habits of the Persian walnut. The\r\nprime object of this study is to solve the problem of pollination, so\r\nthat the planter may be reasonably sure of a satisfactory crop, whether\r\nhis planting be a single tree or an orchard.\r\n\r\nWhile this study has dealt exclusively with the Persian species,\r\n_Juglans regia_, the habits and principles involved apply equally to all\r\nwalnut species.\r\n\r\nIn most plants the reproductive function inheres in a single bisexual\r\nflower, consisting of both male and female elements. In walnuts, as well\r\nas most other nuts, the male and female functions are performed by\r\nunisexual flowers of very different type and appearance.\r\n\r\nBoth the male or staminate flower and the female or pistillate flower\r\nspring from buds that are formed in the axils at the base of leaves of\r\nthe previous season's growth. In the Persian walnut they may be detected\r\nas early as July. The staminate bud that forms the pollen-producing\r\ncatkin of the next season, can be distinguished by its checkered\r\nappearance, something like a tiny pine cone. They occur in the axils of\r\nthe lower leaves of the shoot of the current season.\r\n\r\nThe pistillate bud, which produces the nut, occurs at or near the tip of\r\nthe growth of the current season. It can usually be distinguished from\r\nleaf buds by its larger size and plumpness.\r\n\r\nWhen these blossom buds develop the following season, the male or\r\nstaminate blossom assumes the form of a catkin, which elongates rapidly\r\na few days before maturity. As the pollen is shed, beginning at the\r\nstem end, the pale yellow-green of the bursted pollen capsule turns dark\r\nor black, proceeding to the tip of the catkin. This change readily shows\r\nthat pollen is shedding, which may be confirmed by touching such a\r\ncatkin with the tip of the finger, and noting the yellow pollen that\r\nadheres, or rises in a tiny cloud.\r\n\r\nMaking note of the date when a given variety begins shedding pollen, and\r\nthe date when all catkins on the tree have opened, gives the period\r\nduring which that variety is effective as a pollinizer.\r\n\r\nThe female, or pistillate flower, does not, like the catkin, spring\r\ndirectly from the wood of last season's growth, but occurs at the end of\r\nthe new growth of the current year, being preceded by a number of leaves\r\nwhich nourish the young nut to maturity.\r\n\r\nThe pistillate blossom assumes the form of one or more tiny nutlets with\r\nlittle sharp-pointed tips. When the blossom has become receptive to\r\npollen, each tip has separated into two separate pistils which spread\r\napart and present fresh, slightly sticky surfaces, which are known as\r\nstigmas. This is the time that pollination can take place, which period\r\ncontinues until the stigmas have lost their freshness and stickiness.\r\nThis period marks the time during which pollination can occur.\r\n\r\nIn many cases Persian walnut trees remain barren when planted alone, not\r\nbecause of incompatibility between the pollen and the pistillate flower,\r\nbut because pollen shedding and receptivity do not occur at the same\r\ntime. Sometimes pollen shedding is over before pistils are receptive.\r\nSuch blooming is termed protandrous by botanists. In about an equal\r\nnumber of cases the pistils lose their receptivity before pollen is\r\nshed. Such blooming is termed protogynous. There are quite a number of\r\nvarieties, however, that mature both types of blossoms simultaneously,\r\nin which the variety is self-fertile and will produce crops, even if\r\nisolated from other trees of the species. Of these Hanson and Bedford\r\nare representative. On some other trees there is some overlapping of the\r\nshedding and receptive periods, enough to produce partial, but not full\r\ncrops.\r\n\r\nWarm weather hastens blooming; cool cloudy weather retards it. A warm\r\nspell may start blossoming early, but if broken by a cool wave the\r\nperiod of bloom may be greatly extended.\r\n\r\nA southern exposure with a light soil will cause a variety to blossom\r\nearlier by some days than in the same locality in heavy soil. The\r\nblossoming period is generally shorter in the North than in the South.\r\n\r\nClimax, Michigan reports blooming beginning May 10 and ending May 31, a\r\nperiod of 21 days. Millerton, N. Y., and Massillon, Ohio, report the\r\nsame.\r\n\r\nUrbana, Ill., reports blooming beginning May 5 and ending June 1, a\r\nperiod of 27 days.\r\n\r\nAt Roanoke, Va., the period begins April 9 and ends May 10, running 31\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nAt Greensboro, North Carolina, the season began April 2 and ended May 5,\r\na total of 33 days.\r\n\r\nThe report of Mr. Royal Oakes of Bluffs, Ill., is unique in the\r\nshortness of the blossoming period, both of individual varieties and as\r\na whole. Blossoming began April 29 and ended (estimated) May 13, a\r\nperiod of only 14 days. The reason may partly lie in the weather and\r\npartly because the planting is on high bluffs overlooking the broad\r\nIllinois River valley, affording excellent air drainage.\r\n\r\nOne major difficulty the Committee encountered in tabulating the reports\r\nwas the fact that so few of the same varieties were being grown by the\r\nvarious reporters, making it difficult and sometimes impossible to\r\nsynchronize the blossoming period of the various varieties from\r\ndifferent places with sufficient accuracy. Because of this, two tables\r\nhave been prepared.\r\n\r\nTable Number 1 shows named varieties, for the most part.\r\n\r\nTable Number 2 shows varieties that are being propagated asexually, but\r\nhave not yet been given variety names. Seedlings not propagated by\r\nbudding or grafting, if recognized have been omitted because of\r\nindividual variability.\r\n\r\nEach table consists of five vertical columns, earliest to the right,\r\nsuccessively later towards the left.\r\n\r\nVarieties above the dividing line are shedding pollen at the time\r\nvarieties in the same column below the line are receptive. A variety\r\nlike Hanson, appearing in the same column both above and below the line,\r\nis self-pollinizing. Varieties appearing in more than one column\r\nindicate a long blooming period.\r\n\r\nMR. BECKER: The Crath No. 1 I have been able to propagate is what Mr.\r\nNeilson gave to me as Crath No. 1--I guess he called it Crath.\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: We may have to discard a number of other Crath No. 1's,\r\nbecause the variation between them indicates a mixture of several clones\r\nwith the same name.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT BEST: The next thing to consider is this resolution which is\r\ngiven word for word on page 26 of our 1952 annual report.\r\n\r\n   TABLE 1.\r\n\r\n ----------------------------------------------------------------------\r\n     Broadview     Bijur         Carpathian D    Beckman       Parnell\r\n     Lancaster     Cutleaf S     Bayer           Bedford       Watt\r\n     McDermid      Fort Custer   Beckman         Caesar\r\n [symbol: male]    Hanson        Breslau         Etter\r\n                   Hilltop       Caesar          Eureka\r\n                   Ill.

It is now in order to hear from these\r\nmen the changes necessary in our by-laws to create the right atmosphere\r\nfor the formation and operation of our state organizations, because we\r\ndo want to encourage them. After hearing the proposals, a motion will be\r\nin order that they be approved. If approved, a year from now we will\r\nvote on the amendments to the by-laws. Mr. McDaniel will give the report\r\nof the committee.\r\n\r\nDR. MACDANIEL: Your committee agreed on the suggested revision of Section\r\nIX, which covers chapters and affiliations. If this meets with the\r\napproval of the members here, final action must be deferred until the\r\n45th annual meeting. Proposed amended Section IX of the by-laws reads as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     \"Section IX.--Chapters and Affiliations.\r\n\r\n     \"Article 1. The Association shall encourage the formation of\r\n     regional groups of its members into chapters, which may elect their\r\n     own officers and organize local field days and other programs. Such\r\n     chapters need not limit their membership to members of the parent\r\n     organization. They may publish their proceedings and selected\r\n     papers in the proceedings of the parent society subject to review\r\n     of the Association's Committee on Publications.\r\n\r\n     \"Article 2. Any independent association or society interested in\r\n     nut tree culture may affiliate with the Northern Nut Growers\r\n     Association by payment of an annual affiliation fee of $5.00.\r\n     Selected papers presented at the meetings of such an affiliated\r\n     society may be published in the proceedings of this society subject\r\n     to review of the Association's Committee on Publications.\"\r\n\r\nIt is the thought of this special committee that the new wording\r\nsimplifies and clarifies these two articles in regard to organization of\r\nchapters or sections, and second, affiliation of independent\r\norganizations. We thought we shouldn't limit it to affiliation of nut\r\ngrowers associations as such but to extend affiliation possibility to\r\nany society from garden club on up which is interested in nut growing.\r\nAnd under Article 1, whether we call this state group a chapter or a\r\nsection doesn't seem to matter materially. I believe the Michigan group\r\nprefers to be called a chapter. The Ohio group, I think, will take it\r\neither way. At the present I think we have called that the Ohio Section\r\nof the Northern Nut Growers Association.\r\n\r\nAny discussion? I submit this proposed amendment, Mr. President, to be\r\nprinted in the 44th annual report for action at next year's meeting, the\r\n45th annual meeting of this Association.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT BEST: Do we have a motion to accept the report? (The motion to\r\naccept was made by Dr. Crane, seconded and passed without dissent.)\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT BEST: I was in hopes that we wouldn't have time for the next\r\nfeature, but since some of the committees haven't reported yet, I am\r\nafraid that we have. That is the address by the president.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPresident's Address\r\n\r\nRICHARD B. BEST, _Eldred, Ill._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe task of setting down ideas for the reflection of the NNGA fills me\r\nwith consternation. My scanty rills of thinking are inadequate.\r\n\r\nYou remember the old Arabian tale of the poor student who was shut up in\r\nan enchanted room in the bosom of the earth. You remember how the earth\r\nopened only once each year. The student was waited upon by demons and\r\nspirits who furnished deep and dark knowledge. When the door opened, the\r\nstudent emerged, loaded with great lore and pertinent facts. Like this\r\nArabian student, by delving into antiquity and our old annual reports of\r\nthe NNGA, I have put together some thoughts from men living and dead.\r\n\r\nIrving says: this pilfering disposition which some of us have may be\r\nimplanted in us for a good reason. Maybe through us pilferers or\r\nborrowers, Heaven takes care of the seeds of knowledge and wisdom from\r\nage to age. The worthwhile thoughts which some of our early members gave\r\nus may be purloined by me and made to sparkle again in today's light,\r\neven though the early members' general idea is obsolete.\r\n\r\nSo, just as nature has provided for the distribution of her plant\r\nvarieties through the maws of birds and animals, so it may be that\r\nHeaven has provided for the fine thoughts of our old members to be\r\ncaught by us predatory individuals and made to bear fruit again in this\r\nnew day. Really this is one way we exist and go forward in our\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nA crop of \"tares\" which we read about in the scripture enriches the soil\r\nfor the next crop. As a forest dies, a new crop of trees spring up. Even\r\na dead tree gives rise to a whole creation of countless bacteria and\r\nfungi.\r\n\r\nSo on \"ad infinitum.\" Members who have talked and studied our problems\r\nin the past have made possible our work here today. So, likewise, our\r\nwords will sleep with the others from whom we have borrowed. So, to\r\nescape with a good conscience, to avoid having fingers pointed at me, of\r\nhearing cries of--\"you stole this from me,\" I will try to give credit\r\nwhere credit is due.\r\n\r\nOtherwise, I might be, figuratively speaking, stripped of my material\r\nhere piece by piece, and I would finally stand before you with hardly a\r\nloin cloth of an idea which I could call my own.\r\n\r\nThere is a popular appeal to the nut business which most of us are\r\nsusceptible to,--like wanting to produce large nuts,--and of seeing the\r\nfirst nut,--and to again gather nuts like we did as children. Ask a man\r\nhow large a nut he found and he will lie as he will about a fish he has\r\njust caught.\r\n\r\nThen, there is the romantic visionary who would transform the whole\r\nuniverse into a sort of fairyland nut grove--where there are no insects,\r\ndiseases, or squirrels,--and where the nuts fall polished into open\r\nbags.\r\n\r\nThen, there are those of us--and I am one--who reasoning that the\r\n\"groves were God's first temples,\" flee to a twilight hill top or to a\r\nforest shade, and, as Mr. Stokes said, \"Sit humbly at the feet of the\r\ngreat mother of us all. There is wisdom and healing in the shadow of her\r\nwings.\"\r\n\r\nWe need this philosophical attitude to generate encouragement and\r\ninspiration to withstand the hard knocks that we have had--and will have\r\ncoming. But, the NNGA must be more realistic and really do some\r\ngrappling.\r\n\r\nRead the experiences which all our reports are filled with. Mr. G. A.\r\nMiller on page 99 of the 1940 report handles this matter of success and\r\nfailure very well. We live on our successes and not on our failures. Nut\r\nculture is pioneering, and it is well to be fully aware of the\r\npossibility of failure so that we may be steeled for it when it comes.\r\nFailure makes our successes sweeter.\r\n\r\nAbraham Lincoln's life was a series of failures. Thomas Edison usually\r\nfailed. Plant breeders at our stations nearly always fail. But, once in\r\na while they succeed. In the nut business, if we succeed 1 in 10,000\r\ntimes, success may be cheap at that.\r\n\r\nDr. MacDaniels stated so many important aspects of the NNGA that I want\r\nto list his outline here and then simply hang some thoughts on the\r\nskeleton of his report. For your own enjoyment and understanding, please\r\nread again Dr. MacDaniels's address \"The Forward Look,\" which is found\r\non page 27 of our 1952 report. I just mention his subjects and comment\r\non them for emphasis.\r\n\r\n1. _Variety Evaluation_\r\n\r\nThe Ohio Nut Growers did a fine job of getting this job of evaluation in\r\nthe groove. Read about it on page 29 of the 1946 report. How many of us\r\nhere have wasted years on varieties that good evaluation might have\r\ndiscarded, before we started to plant the nut.\r\n\r\n2. _Judging Standards_\r\n\r\nWhich covers such things as--\r\n\r\n   (a) Sealing of nuts\r\n   (b) Recovery of halves\r\n   (c) Size, quality, etc.\r\n\r\nEvaluation and judging include all those fine things we look for in a\r\nnut.\r\n\r\n3. _The Naming of Varieties_\r\n\r\nMany of us have the same tree growing but calling it a different name.\r\n\r\n4. _Securing New Varieties_\r\n\r\nAnd getting them into as many channels. Mr. Wilkinson started several\r\n\"Chief\" pecan trees last year and gave them all away. Chief is a fine\r\nnew variety of pecan. If we had a few more Ford Wilkinsons in this\r\norganization, \"God bless him,\" we wouldn't have so many problems.\r\n\r\n5. _The Work of Individuals_\r\n\r\nThere is always the possibility of finding the \"perfect nut,\" so we need\r\nto continue our search through the earth for better varieties.\r\n\r\nScientific techniques must be applied before we breed better nuts.\r\n\r\nWe simply cannot have nuts put in our coffins expecting to continue our\r\nwork in the next world; so we need to do the next best thing to\r\nthis--that is of instructing our sons in the little we have found and\r\nwhere our different varieties are planted. Then, some of our sons will\r\nstart where we left off.\r\n\r\nPrivate research is playing a more important part in the world today.\r\nPrivate research, using the large amount of basic research available,\r\ncould accomplish wonders in the nut world.\r\n\r\nI am deeply grieved when I see vast estates which have had a fortune\r\nspent in plantings that had little practical value. The men who spent\r\nthis money would gladly have furnished the land, labor, capital and\r\nmanagement for a nut breeding program had we been there to have sold\r\nthem on nut trees.\r\n\r\nAs Mr. Churchill said--\"Too little and too late.\"\r\n\r\nBut members of the NNGA forget \"what might have been.\" New estates are\r\ndeveloping and younger men are wondering how they can immortalize their\r\nlives and work. Men pass away; their names perish from record and\r\nrecollection; their history is only a tale and their tombstone becomes a\r\nruin, but a good nut tree bearing a man's name, gives that name\r\nimmortality.\r\n\r\n6. _Work of the Experiment Stations._\r\n\r\nIn the most practical vein, our basic research and most of our actual\r\nbreeding must still be done by our Experiment Stations.\r\n\r\nAny nut project is a long-time program and it lends itself best to an\r\nExperiment Station which is not set up on \"a three score and ten\" basis\r\nlike we as individuals are. Stations also have trained workers and\r\ninformation at hand.\r\n\r\n7. _The Real Aim of the NNGA_\r\n\r\nIs better living on the farm and the improvement of the garden and\r\nfarmstead. Almost every farm and home, especially in the great corn\r\nbelt, needs shelter, shade trees, and the beautifying effect of trees.\r\n\r\nPsalm 19:1-4 says: \"The heavens declare the glory of God; and the\r\nfirmament showeth his handiwork. Day unto day uttereth\r\nspeech and night unto night showeth knowledge. Their voice goes out\r\nthrough all the earth, and their words to the end of the world.\"\r\n\r\n8. _Nut Growing as a Hobby._\r\n\r\nFor people who like to see things growing, there are few projects that\r\nyield more genuine satisfaction than hardy-adapted varieties of nut\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\nFew people know what a heart nut or chestnuts are, and most have never\r\ncracked a butternut. Most of us have never tasted a good persimmon, and\r\nthe paw-paw is practically unknown. We of the NNGA have something to\r\noffer our members.\r\n\r\n9. _Keep our Organization Solvent and Functioning._\r\n\r\nAll costs have increased. Our strength lies in our letters, reports and\r\ninformation which we send to our membership. To keep this information\r\ncoming through letters and our annual report takes money.\r\n\r\n10. _How to Finance the NNGA._ Dr. MacDaniels makes the following\r\nsuggestions after stating that we have reached the point where\r\nincreasing the dues will not give us more income, because of loss of\r\nmembership.\r\n\r\n   (a) Increase our number of members.\r\n   (b) Provide different types of membership to encourage contributions.\r\n   (c) Gifts.\r\n   (d) Special fund raising projects.\r\n\r\nIncreasing the membership seems to have the most promise in the future.\r\n\r\nWe are now at the cross roads. Do we want a strong, hard-hitting\r\norganization, capable of doing these things which we know NNGA can do,\r\nor do we want to ease down the other road to a whimpering senile\r\nexistence, in the plant society world?\r\n\r\nWe have increased our membership 40% the past year, and after hurriedly\r\ncongratulating ourselves, let us hurry on to this problem of setting\r\nourselves another goal for 1954.\r\n\r\nWhat shall our new goal be? 30%, 50%, 100%--let us think \"high.\" It is\r\neasier to come down than to go higher.\r\n\r\nI'd like to have someone's idea in the audience here. Does anybody have\r\nsome figure we should hit at? 10%, 20%, 25%?\r\n\r\nMR. KINTZEL: I think since we have a thousand members, for each of the\r\nthousand to bring in one more member and make it a hundred per cent.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT BEST: Now, the high man is going to win here, you know. Is\r\nthere anyone that can raise this man, that can say that we increase our\r\nmembership more than a hundred per cent? If not shall we take that as a\r\ngoal?\r\n\r\nWe have now reached the point in this discussion of goals where we can\r\nmake the following profound deduction--\"Nothing is worth two cents until\r\nit is sold.\"\r\n\r\nOur church bells ring to tell the world that something good is being\r\noffered and that the church has something to sell. Everything in this\r\nworld must be sold. The NNGA is competing not only with the resistance\r\npeople offer it, but also against every other human activity. People buy\r\nwhat they think will give them the most satisfaction.\r\n\r\nWe are living in a cold-blooded society and people are not going to\r\nchoke with emotion when we mention the old hollow tree where the possums\r\nhatched, or the wide spreading chestnut. People may not even want to\r\njoin our NNGA. This is a free country and people can just sit in the sun\r\non the bare ground if they want to. They may not want trees and can eat\r\ngrape nuts if they want. We know they need the hobby--the shade--the\r\nbeauty--the protection or even nuts which nut trees will bring them.\r\n\r\nBecause we know people need these fine things, then we must ask them to\r\njoin the NNGA. If everybody knew what you know about the NNGA, we would\r\nhave a membership of 100,000 members. But they do not.\r\n\r\nThis is what we mean by selling our organization. Indirectly as we sell\r\nour memberships to help other people, we help our organization.\r\n\r\nFinally, let me suggest that we build up a backlog of ideas here at\r\nRochester to add to what we have on increasing our membership.\r\n\r\nGive your ideas to our Vice President, Mr. George Salzer and his\r\npublicity committee and you will be helping to solve our NNGA problems.\r\n\r\nMR. DAVIDSON: It seems to me the most successful thing that was done\r\nduring the past year, as far as the raising of membership was concerned,\r\nwas done by Mr. Chase, when he wrote that article on Persian walnuts\r\nthat survived sub-zero temperatures. That had a tremendous impact on the\r\npublic imagination, and it got a tremendous number of inquiries. I think\r\nit had more effect than even the work of individual members, so I would\r\nsuggest that anybody who has an idea that can be sent to a magazine that\r\nwould have a public appeal should do that thing.\r\n\r\nMR. MACHOVINA: The thought strikes me that in addition to the goal for\r\nnew members, we should also work to keep these members we have picked up\r\nthis year. That means the older members should contact the newer\r\nmembers, help them, give them trees. Otherwise, a lot can be lost\r\nquickly.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT BEST: In this world no matter whether we are selling seed\r\ncorn--if you will pardon that little plug--or you are running a\r\nrestaurant or any form of human activity, you can figure each year about\r\na 10 per cent loss in your clientelle or your customers, whatever you\r\nwant to call them, and we of N.N.G.A. are no exception to that rule. We\r\ndo have to keep working for that replacement; otherwise, in 10 or 12\r\nyears we are going to be out of business entirely.\r\n\r\nMR. KERR: I am a Spanish War veteran. At the national convention in\r\nPortland, Oregon, in 1938, one of my comrades showed me a walnut tree\r\nthat he planted before he went to the Philippines during that war. It\r\nwas on the banks of the Willamette River where he had planted three\r\nnuts. Two were so near the river that a log boom had torn them out, but\r\none was left. It was 80 feet high, four feet in diameter, and on one\r\noccasion had produced almost a ton of very good nuts.\r\n\r\nI told that to the science editor of the Associated Press, and he put a\r\nlittle article in the local paper, but no picture. If he had a picture\r\nwith that article, everybody would have read it. I think we need more\r\npublicity on these old trees that are bearing nuts. I live in Plymouth,\r\nMass., where the Pilgrims settled. In their settlement papers they\r\nmentioned the groves of walnuts and other wild nuts in the territory. We\r\nfound a low-branched walnut 5 feet in diameter and over 450 years old.\r\n\r\nMR. BROOK: Let me suggest Mr. Kerr write such an article for such a\r\nmagazine, because he is just the person.\r\n\r\nMR. KERR: I have already written a few articles for several men's clubs,\r\nand I am writing another article.\r\n\r\nMR. BROOK: When are you releasing it?\r\n\r\nMR. KERR: Pretty soon. The Northern Nut Growers will get a copy.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT BEST: The report of the Place of Meeting Committee, Mr.\r\nAllaman?\r\n\r\nMR. ALLAMAN: A year ago this summer I went to Lancaster to visit the\r\nFranklin Marshall College to see if we could hold our convention there\r\nnext year. They considered it quite an honor to have us there, feeling\r\nthat it is an educational feature. They can furnish us a nice auditorium\r\nwith a cafeteria nearby. Sleeping quarters would be scattered throughout\r\nthe grounds. They can furnish our meals and a banquet. About ten days\r\nago I checked to see if things were still all right, and they said,\r\n\"Come ahead,\" so I am suggesting that the Association hold its next\r\nannual convention at Lancaster, Pa. at Franklin Marshall College.\r\n\r\nOur field trip at Lancaster would be to Mr. W. W. Posey's orchard. He\r\nhas by far the biggest planting in the state with trees of various ages\r\nand many different varieties. He entertained the Pennsylvania group a\r\nyear ago. He has a nice pavilion up on the hill, where we can have our\r\nlunch. We had a most enjoyable time, and he is delighted to have us. Mr.\r\nPosey is owner of the Posey Iron Works in Lancaster.\r\n\r\nFor 1955 we were thinking about Michigan, probably Michigan State\r\nCollege. For the following year we were wondering about Connecticut.\r\nJust the place in Connecticut has not been given any thought.\r\n\r\nSession adjourned.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMONDAY AFTERNOON SESSION\r\n\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT BEST: In the morning session Mr. Allaman proposed that we hold\r\nour next convention in Lancaster, Pa. Is there a motion to that effect?\r\n\r\nMR. RICK: I move that our next meeting, 1954, be held in Lancaster\r\nCounty, Pennsylvania. That is supposed to be one of the garden counties\r\nin the country. It has stood first and second in production. I don't\r\nknow what it stands now, but it wouldn't be far from the top. It would\r\nbe most interesting to all our members, I am sure, to pay Lancaster\r\nCounty a visit. Motion seconded by Mr. Ellis and passed.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT BEST: According to the by-laws, we get a report of the\r\nNominating Committee at this time. We have our election at the last\r\nbusiness session.\r\n\r\nMR. SLATE: The Nominating Committee, consisting of Max Hardy as chairman\r\nand some others, including myself, presents the following candidates:\r\nFor President, R. B. Best. For vice-president, Gilbert Becker; for\r\nTreasurer, W. S. Clark; and for Secretary Spencer Chase.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT BEST: Are there other nominations? (No response.) You will\r\nhave a chance for further nominations at our last business session.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT BEST: Now, then, we have an opportunity to hear from a group\r\nof what we might call authorities in their various fields. We have quite\r\nan assortment. The only way I know of to express it is to say we have\r\nthe wise men out of the east and the wild men out of the west. I think\r\nwe first might hear from Mr. Kyhl of Sabula, Iowa. Mr. Kyhl, you come up\r\nand give us your version of the nut business.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout Nuts\r\n\r\nIRA M. KYHL, _Sabula, Iowa_\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat we all have in mind at this time is nuts and more nuts. One way to\r\nget them is to plant more nut trees. Why not start a campaign in this\r\ndirection? Where I live in the midwest the black walnut is at home and\r\nlikewise the hickory, hazel, etc. Farmers may be reluctant to set aside\r\nacreage for this purpose but they could be planted along fence rows\r\naround the entire farm and would produce shade for livestock, an\r\nabundance of marketable nuts, and later a fortune in saw logs. The\r\naverage size farm of 160 acres could support a great many black walnuts\r\nif planted along fence rows which ordinarily grow up to brush and weeds.\r\nSeedlings are cheap or one could buy 2 or 3 bushels of Thomas nuts and\r\nraise their own. One could also plant hickories, heartnuts, filberts and\r\nchestnuts if variety is desired along fence rows, but the main thing is\r\nto get this work started. We could no doubt get cooperation from County\r\nAgents and Conservation Departments because of wind breaks and erosion\r\ncontrol. Farmers who could be induced to do this work would no doubt\r\nbecome nut enthusiasts in due time.\r\n\r\nI feel that at this time it may be in line to pay a slight tribute to\r\nour friend the squirrel. I wonder how many of us gave a thought as to\r\nwho was responsible for all of our wild trees, such as black walnuts,\r\nbutternuts, hickories, hazels and so forth, and how they came about.\r\nThe answer is simple, the squirrels, of course. They have been planting\r\nnuts for centuries and without their good work in the past, there would\r\nbe very few wild nut trees.\r\n\r\nThe squirrel has been wrongfully condemned for his apparently good work\r\nand has even been cussed a little for living on the efforts of his own\r\nlabor, and due to my appreciation of his good work, I have grafted or\r\nrather topworked some of the trees he planted to Persian walnuts,\r\npecans, etc., so that he may have more of a variety of nuts. Someday I\r\nexpect to have some of the largest and fattest squirrels in America. I\r\ncover some of the choice varieties with stove pipe. They seem to take\r\nthe hint and don't bother the nuts. One more thing, there does\r\nnot seem to be enough nuts to go around, that is, enough for both the\r\nsquirrels and ourselves. So let's plant more trees so that the squirrels\r\ncan't possibly eat them all and when we have done that, then let's plant\r\na lot more.\r\n\r\nWe now have many species of nuts and many varieties of each species,\r\nmany of which have proven hardy in cold climates. It is very encouraging\r\nto note the good work that is being done to produce better and more\r\nvarieties. One very fine nut that doesn't seem to have had much work\r\ndone on it is the hard shell almond. It does very well for me, is\r\nself-pollinating, bears very heavily, and can be grafted on peach stocks\r\nwith good results. I have also had very good success with Persian\r\nwalnuts, heartnuts, filberts, chestnuts, hickories, pecans, hazels and\r\nblack walnuts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNatural Variation Observed in Shagbark Hickory, _Carya ovata_ (Mill.) K.\r\nKoch. in Central New York\r\n\r\nDAVID H. CALDWELL, _N. Y. State College of Forestry, Syracuse, N. Y._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe shagbark hickory has been extremely important in the economy of the\r\nUnited States during its period of early development. The handles of the\r\naxes which leveled extensive forested areas in Colonial days were\r\nfrequently made from sturdy hickory wood. The nuts furnished food for\r\nman in the form of oil or nutmeats and often hogs were fattened on\r\nhickory nuts, beechnuts and chestnuts. As settlement progressed, the\r\ndemand on hickory as wood for wagon parts increased while the use of the\r\nthick-shelled nuts for food decreased except by the country boy or girl\r\nwho wandered from tree to tree in the fall collecting nuts for cracking\r\nby the fireside in the wintertime.\r\n\r\nThe author remembers bounding out of bed as a child in the fall before\r\ndawn on the nights when there had been a frost or a heavy wind, in an\r\neffort to beat the squirrels in the race to obtain the rich harvest of\r\nhickory nuts to be found lying beneath the fine old trees near Herkimer,\r\nN. Y. By some coincidence, both the boys and the squirrels knew of the\r\nsame trees which were most sought after for their crops of nuts. It was\r\nat this time that the variability of hickory nuts was first observed.\r\nThus it was that the nuts of certain trees were never gathered, while\r\nthe grass beneath other favorite trees was gleaned carefully for all\r\nfallen nuts.\r\n\r\nThe present investigation of the shagbark began in the fall of 1949 and\r\ncontinued through the summer of 1953. It was initiated with the previous\r\nknowledge of the extreme variability to be observed between the nuts of\r\nindividual shagbark hickory trees and was conducted for the purpose of\r\ndetermining whether or not that variability was also expressed through\r\nother features of the tree such as buds, leaves, bark or form.\r\nConsequently, a systematic study was begun of individual trees totaling\r\n158 found mostly in Onondaga County, New York plus the edges of\r\nsurrounding counties. The trees were observed throughout the growing\r\nseason so that the various tree parts could be observed for comparison.\r\nIt was a preconceived idea by the author that there might be several or\r\nmore distinct subdivisions into which individuals of shagbark might be\r\nplaced through the use of macroscopic characters.\r\n\r\nObservations were made over a period of three growing seasons on the\r\nfollowing characters of each tree:\r\n\r\n   (1) bark\r\n   (2) buds and twigs\r\n   (3) leaves\r\n   (4) flowers\r\n   (5) fruit\r\n\r\nEach character was observed more than once for each tree as a check on\r\npossible yearly variation for specific characteristics in the trees from\r\nwhich data was collected.\r\n\r\nThe generalized description for shagbark hickory is as follows:\r\n\r\n    SIZE--a tree ranging at maturity from 50 to 100+ feet in height,\r\n    generally 2 to 3 feet in diameter and very occasionally reaching 4\r\n    feet in diameter.\r\n\r\n    BARK--usually under 3/4 of an inch in thickness, occasionally up to\r\n    1 inch thick with a characteristic light or smoky-gray color when\r\n    dry and breaking up into long plates or strips loosely attached to\r\n    the trunk near the middle of the plate.\r\n\r\n    BUDS--terminal buds usually 3/8 to 3/4 of an inch long, subglobose\r\n    to narrowly ovate, with 8-10 imbricate scales, the outermost of\r\n    which are a blackish brown with dark brown tomentum, and a short\r\n    mucronate or attenuate apex, inner scales light brown with longer\r\n    lanate pubescence and apex acute to obtuse; lateral buds smaller,\r\n    about 1/4 of an inch with tightly appressed scales.\r\n\r\n    TWIGS--angled or rounded, reddish brown to yellowish brown, or gray,\r\n    turning more or less gray with age; pubescent the first year.\r\n\r\n    LEAVES--compound--ranging from 3-7 ovate to oblong lanceolate\r\n    leaflets, usually 5, terminal leaflet as large or larger than the\r\n    first two laterals, usually 4-8\" long, generally glabrous on both\r\n    surfaces but with a finely serrate, ciliate margin; total leaf size\r\n    ranging from 8-15\" for mature leaves.\r\n\r\n     FLOWERS--(a) _female_--occurring in 2 to several flowered spikes,\r\n    with a one-celled ovary, about 1/4 to 1/3 inch long covered with\r\n    tomentum; flowers rusty to yellowish green in color; stigma with two\r\n    stigmatic lobes; bracts much longer than the lateral bractlets. (b)\r\n    _male_--in three parted or branched aments, each flower usually\r\n    containing 4 stamens with a 2 or a 3 lobed calyx; aments 3-4\" long\r\n    with glandular hairs.\r\n\r\n    FRUIT--oval, globose or pear shaped, consisting of a woody husk 1/4\r\n    to 1/2\" thick breaking usually along 4 lines of suture exposing a\r\n    flattened nut generally 4 ridged, smooth or slightly roughened;\r\n    usually white or cream in color, seed sweet with 2 cotyledons.\r\n\r\n\r\nRESULTS OF FIELD OBSERVATIONS\r\n\r\n    BARK--Most of the shagbark hickory trees observed were found to have\r\n    a smoke-gray, shaggy bark from 20 years of age to maturity. However,\r\n    among the 158 individual hickory trees observed, there were found 7\r\n    trees which had a bark much more blackish than the normal shagbark\r\n    type and with closely furrowed bark consisting of inter-lacing scaly\r\n    ridges more similar in character to that of _Carya ovalis_\r\n    (Wangenh.) Sarg.\r\n\r\n    The trees found growing under timberland conditions rather than as\r\n    open field or hedgerow trees did not have the characteristic shaggy\r\n    bark except for the upper trunk which had been exposed to the\r\n    weather conditions of the forest canopy. Where the trunks of the\r\n    trees were somewhat protected from direct rays of the sun and force\r\n    of the wind, the bark was smooth, gray and but slightly plated with\r\n    none of the shagginess typical of open field grown shagbark.\r\n\r\n    BUDS AND TWIGS--The buds of shagbark were observed to divide\r\n    themselves into two general groups based upon terminal bud shapes\r\n    and two more groups based upon the sizes of the attenuated apex of\r\n    the outermost bud scales. In all cases the bud scales were observed\r\n    to be pubescent though the degree of pubescence varied considerably\r\n    in the outer scales only.\r\n\r\n    The two general bud shapes were globose-ovate and narrowly\r\n    elliptical. The broadly oval (Fig. 1a) type of buds were smaller,\r\n    generally under 1/2 inch in length while the elliptical (Fig. 1b)\r\n    type of buds were usually over 1/2 inch in length.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1a Fig. 1b\r\n\r\nShagbark Hickory Terminal Buds (1-X)]\r\n\r\nThe long attenuated apex on the outer bud scales of the elliptical type\r\nof buds is evident in Figs. 1b and 2b.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2a Fig. 2b\r\n\r\nShagbark Hickory Terminal Bud Scales (1-X)]\r\n\r\nThe number of lateral buds at one position varied considerably with the\r\nusual number being one (Fig. 3a) bud located just above the lobed leaf\r\nscar. On exceedingly vigorous sprout growth, or on very vigorous\r\nterminal growth twigs, it was found that 2, 3, 4 and occasionally 5\r\nsuperposed buds might occur (Fig. 3b).\r\n\r\nTwigs of shagbark varied considerably both in the rapidity of growth and\r\nin color. Frequently the color seemed to be associated with the incident\r\nrays of the sun and orientation of the twig on the branch seemed to\r\nlargely control color.\r\n\r\nTwigs upon the same tree would vary from gray to reddish brown to\r\nyellowish brown or tan. The majority of observed trees had a reddish\r\nbrown as the predominant color. Terminal shoot growth of as much as 40\r\ninches was observed and as little as 2-3 inches in very slowly growing\r\nmature trees.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3a Fig. 3b\r\n\r\nShagbark Hickory Lateral Buds (1-X)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4a Fig. 4b\r\n\r\nShagbark Hickory Leaves (1/3X)]\r\n\r\nThe degree of pubescence on the surface of the twigs varied considerably\r\nand was found to frequently follow group location patterns. Thus nearly\r\nall of the individuals growing in one field might be found with dense\r\npubescence on the twigs while a similar group several miles away might\r\nhave, for all practical purposes, no pubescence on the twigs. In\r\ngeneral, the most rapidly growing trees (or twigs) had the least amount\r\nof pubescence on the twigs.\r\n\r\nLEAVES--There was extreme variability found with the leaves of the 158\r\nindividual trees observed. All trees were found to have compound leaves,\r\nbut the leaflet numbers varied greatly. The typical number for shagbark\r\nis 5, but 3 to 7 were found; three leaflets were common, 5 were abundant\r\nand 7 leaflets were rare. Six cases of leaves with 7 leaflets were\r\nobtained from the vast number of leaves checked on the 158 trees; thus\r\nthe frequency of occurrence is quite low for the group as a whole. Where\r\n7 leaflets were observed, 5 of the leaves were normal pinnately compound\r\nleaves (Fig. 4a), while one leaf consisted of five palmately arranged\r\nleaflets plus two normal pinnately compound leaflets (Fig. 4b). The\r\nleaflets on each tree were fairly uniform in shape but the shape of\r\nleaflets between trees varied considerably. Thus one tree might have 5\r\nleaflets quite broadly ovate to obovate in shape while another equally\r\nvalid shagbark would be found with narrowly elliptical to lanceolate\r\nleaflets similar to those of red hickory (oval pignut hickory), _Carya\r\novalis_ (Wangenh.) Sarg.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5a Fig. 5b Fig. 5c\r\n\r\nShagbark Hickory Fruits (1/2X)]\r\n\r\nThe margins of the leaflets were generally finely serrate and disposed\r\nto be ciliate--i.e. with a fringe of hairs along the serrate margins.\r\nThe presence of cilia tend to differentiate shagbark hickory from red\r\nhickory in the field. This feature is a consistently good one if a hand\r\nlens is available but the degree of ciliation varies considerably from\r\ntree to tree and during different parts of the growing season. The\r\npresence of cilia on the margin of the leaflets should not be used as a\r\nmeans of differentiating shagbark from shellbark hickory, _Carya\r\nlacinoisa_ (Michx. f.) Loud., since shellbark also has a ciliate margin\r\non the leaflets.\r\n\r\nFLOWERS--The female flowers of shagbark are found on short 1 to 5\r\nflowered spikes produced on the current season's growth. Most of the\r\nflowers are around 1/3\" long, sessile and covered with a tawny tomentum.\r\nEach flower tends to have two yellowish green stigmatic lobes but\r\nthree-lobed stigmas may be found and one case of a 4-lobed stigma was\r\nobserved. Various amounts of an amber, or yellow scurfy, substance was\r\nalso observed on the new flowers. The male flowers occur on 3 parted,\r\nslender, glandular-hairy aments from the basal portion of the current\r\nseason's growth. The aments are usually 3-4 inches long with individual\r\nflowers consisting of 4 stamens with their surrounding bract and calyx\r\nlobes. The anthers are yellowish or greenish yellow. Occasionally a two\r\nbranched ament may be found but this seems to occur when one branch of\r\nthe ament has failed to develop due to an injury of some sort. One case\r\nof an unbranched ament was observed.\r\n\r\nBoth female and male flowers are found to be mature after the leaves\r\nhave grown to nearly their fully expanded mature size. There are more\r\nmale aments to be found on the lower branches than female spikes of\r\nflowers, which would tend to aid in cross pollination of the flowers by\r\nwind action. In general the stigmatic lobes are not quite mature at the\r\ntime that the bulk of the pollen is being shed, yet individual trees, at\r\na considerable distance from another pollen bearing shagbark tree, will\r\nbear considerable quantities of nuts indicating self fertility.\r\n\r\nFRUIT--The husk of the shagbark is extremely variable in size, shape,\r\nthickness and opening habits. In general the husk consists of 4 segments\r\nwhich split along 4 sutures and fall apart at maturity dropping the nut\r\nto the ground. In many cases the husk falls to the ground with the nut\r\nand does not break apart until it reaches the ground. A few of the trees\r\nexamined had husks which were not quite deciduous to the base and were\r\nretained on the tree until after the nut had been released. One tree\r\namong the 158 examined consistently had a 5 parted husk.\r\n\r\nThe husks varied considerably in thickness, the dried measurements\r\nranging from 1/8 to 1/2 inch with the bulk of the measurements averaging\r\naround 1/4\" thick. Two trees had husks so thin as to be more typical of\r\nred hickory while only 6 trees had husks 1/2 inch thick or more.\r\n\r\nThe overall shape of the husk around the nut ranged from globose (Fig.\r\n5a) to ovoid (Fig. 5b) to obovate (Fig. 5c).\r\n\r\nIt would seem that the shape of the nut enclosed within the husk might\r\nbe predetermined by examination of the husk itself. The obovate husk\r\nshape could most frequently be depended on to produce either elliptical\r\nor obovate nuts but this was not an absolute certainty. The thickness of\r\nthe husk effectively concealed the true shape of the nut beneath; the\r\nthinnest husks most nearly conforming to the true nut shape.\r\n\r\nThe size of the mature shagbark hickory nut and husk ranged from as\r\nsmall as one inch in a tree which had a seed barely 3/8\" wide to as\r\nlarge as 2-1/4 inches. The size of husk and nut is variable and adjacent\r\ntrees which may have developed from the same parent seldom have similar\r\nnuts in the area examined.\r\n\r\nThe nut itself exhibited the greatest variability of all features\r\nexamined on the test trees. These trees exhibited striking\r\ndissimilarities in:\r\n\r\n   (1) nut size\r\n   (2) nut shape\r\n   (3) shell color\r\n   (4) thickness of shell\r\n   (5) sweetness or palatability of nutmeat.\r\n\r\nOne tree was discovered with a nut which might have caused a taxonomist\r\nto coin the name _Carya ovata_ var. _microcarpa_ due to the very small\r\ndimensions of about 3/8 x 3/8 x 3/4 inches in width, thickness and\r\ndepth. Even the squirrels of the area did not feel that this tree\r\ndeserved their attention The largest nut\r\nobtained had overall dimensions of 1 x 3/4 x 1 inches in width,\r\nthickness and depth. The majority of average sized nuts were roughly 3/4\r\nx 1/2 x 3/4 inches.\r\n\r\nThe nut shapes have fallen into a general pattern which include the\r\nfollowing normal types:\r\n\r\n    Type A--The normal 4 angled nut, nearly rectangular in cross section\r\n    (Fig. 6a).\r\n\r\n    Type B--An elliptical form, nearly oval in cross section (Fig. 6b).\r\n\r\n    Type C--A smooth oval nut, oval or elliptical in cross section (Fig.\r\n    6c).\r\n\r\n    Type D--An obovate nut, oval to angled in cross section (Fig. 6d).\r\n\r\n    Type E--A fat globose nut, broadly oval to orbicular in cross\r\n    section (Fig. 6e).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Type A Type B Type C Type D Type E\r\n\r\nFig. 6a Fig. 6b Fig. 6c Fig. 6d Fig. 6e\r\n\r\nNormal Fruit Forms of Shagbark Hickory (1X)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Type F Type G Type H\r\n\r\nFig. 6f Fig. 6g Fig. 6h\r\n\r\nAbnormal Fruit Forms of Shagbark Hickory (1X)]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the afore mentioned 5 normal types, three abnormal types\r\nwere encountered:\r\n\r\n   Type F--A smooth or angled nut, triangular in cross section--found\r\n   in the same trees as normal nut forms (Fig. 6f).\r\n\r\n   Type G--A smooth or angled nut square in cross section--found\r\n   on the same trees as normal nut forms (Fig. 6g).\r\n\r\n   Type H--A Siamese twin form occurring very rarely on the same\r\n   trees as other normal forms (Fig. 6h).\r\n\r\nType A was the commonest form of nut found in the Onondaga County area.\r\nIt roughly exceeded Types B, D and E by a 2:1 ratio. Type C exceeded\r\nTypes B, D and E with a ratio of about 7:5 in frequency of occurrence.\r\nTypes B and D were the two most easily cracked nut forms when using a\r\nhammer and anvil for a cracking device. It should be noted at this time\r\nthat _all_ of the abnormal fruit types were found in _conjunction with_\r\nnormal fruit types. Thus, one individual tree used as a collection might\r\nproduce _both_ a normal nut type (A, B, C, D or E) _and_ an abnormal nut\r\ntype (F, G or H). Occasionally a few nuts in a collection from one tree\r\nmight be classed as a _second_ normal type. This was rare however (5\r\ncases) and only occurred in \"borderline trees\" which were then\r\nclassified and recorded as per the dominant nut type for the tree. It\r\nshould be noted here that the nut type did _not_ vary from year to year\r\nfor the trees examined. Also the frequency of nut crops varied\r\nconsiderably; less than 1/4 of the sample trees produced nuts each year.\r\nMost of the trees produced crops in alternate years, and a very few have\r\nnot fruited in the third year following a heavy nut crop.\r\n\r\n The 158 trees examined provided the following distribution by fruit types:\r\n ---------------+------------------+--------------------------------\r\n                | Number of        | Number of abnormal types found\r\n  Fruit Type    | Individual Trees | in conjunction with\r\n                |                  | normal types\r\n -----------+---+------------------+--------------------------------\r\n            |   |                  |    F       G        H\r\n -----------+---+------------------+--------------------------------\r\n  Normal    | A |      54          |    5       2        1\r\n            | B |      23          |    2                1\r\n            | C |      36          |    1                2\r\n            | D |      21          |    7                1\r\n            | E |      24          |            4        1\r\n -----------|---+------------------+--------------------------------\r\n            |   | 158 collections  |\r\n -----------+---+------------------+--------------------------------\r\n  Abnormal  | F |      15          |                    15\r\n            | G |       8          |                     8\r\n            | H |       4          |                     4\r\n ---------------+------------------+--------------------------------\r\n 27 collections\r\n\r\nShell color of the nuts varied between a brownish white and a pinkish\r\nwhite color when fully dried. From the trees used as a sample, there\r\nwere 14 which might be classed in the brownish white categories, and the\r\nremainder (144) as pinkish white or creamy white. Types B and C were the\r\nones which most frequently were found with the brownish white nutshell\r\ncolor. Type A was typically pinkish or creamy white in color.\r\n\r\nNutshell thickness varied somewhat. In all but 2 cases, the nuts were\r\ntoo hard to crack with the teeth. The thin-shelled ones are\r\n_comparatively_ thin only, being about like paper-shelled pecans with\r\nthe shell thinnest on the sides of the nut. It is not suggested that\r\nthese two thin-shelled nuts be exploited as paper-shelled shagbarks\r\nsince they are poorly formed nuts and of small size. One of the two\r\ntrees might be a hybrid since it does not have a ciliate leaflet margin\r\nalthough the buds, bark and leaves are typical of shagbark hickory. The\r\nminimum shell thickness observed for the side of the nut was 1/2 a\r\nmillimeter (0.5 mm.) and the thickest was 2.0 millimeters. As previously\r\nstated, nut types B and D (the elliptical and obovate nut forms) were\r\nthe easiest to crack. Nut type A was the most difficult and had\r\ngenerally the thickest shell.\r\n\r\nThe seed coat color range was from a light tan to a bronze color. The\r\nseed itself was in all cases sweet although certain of the nuts had a\r\nmore pleasing taste than others. The nuts eventually became rancid\r\nthough 3 years of storage in a heated room did not cause the bulk of the\r\ntest samples to change in flavor. This is unlike the pecan which, stored\r\nin the same room with the hickory nuts, became rancid by the following\r\nyear after collection.\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary of Observations\r\n\r\nThe following observations concerning shagbark hickory may be made from\r\nthis study:\r\n\r\n    (1) The buds of shagbark fall into 2 classes based on bud shape, (1)\r\n    globose-ovate and (2) elliptical, the latter being the largest bud\r\n    as a rule.\r\n\r\n    (2) The buds of shagbark fall into 2 classes based upon the length\r\n    of the attenuated apex of the outer bud scales. The elliptical form\r\n    of bud consistently had the longest drawn out apex.\r\n\r\n    (3) Normal buds of shagbark occur singly on the twigs above the\r\n    lobed leaf scar; however, 2, 3 or 4 superposed buds may occur on\r\n    very fast grown sprouts or terminal shoots of vigorously growing\r\n    trees.\r\n\r\n    (4) The twigs of shagbark are pubescent but range in degrees from\r\n    almost none to densely pubescent. The fastest grown twigs are apt to\r\n    be the least pubescent.\r\n\r\n    (5) Leaves are compound with 3-5 leaflets commonly found and 7\r\n    leaflets rarely found.\r\n\r\n    (6) Leaflet shapes varied from tree to tree being ovate, obovate or\r\n    elliptical.\r\n\r\n    (7) Leaflet margins with one exception were more or less ciliate.\r\n\r\n    (8) Most female flowers of shagbark have 2 stigmatic lobes, however,\r\n    3 stigmatic lobes resulting in triangular nuts are not uncommon.\r\n\r\n    (9) The typical male ament is three branched but one and two\r\n    branched aments have been observed.\r\n\r\n     (10) The husk of shagbark varies in thickness from 1/8 inch to 1/2\r\n    inch in thickness when dry. The usual husk is 4-parted but one tree\r\n    bore 5-parted husks consistently.\r\n\r\n    The average husk thickness is around 1/4 inch.\r\n\r\n    (12) There are three general fruit shapes, (1) globose, (2) ovoid\r\n    and (3) obovate.\r\n\r\n    (13) There are at least 5 general types of normal nut shapes for\r\n    Onondaga County, N. Y. as listed in the text of this paper.\r\n\r\n    (14) Three abnormal nut types were also encountered growing\r\n    concurrently with the normal types.\r\n\r\n    (15) Nutshell color varied from brownish to creamy white. The darker\r\n    colors were generally associated with the elliptical, oval or\r\n    obovate nut forms.\r\n\r\n    (16) Nutshell thickness varied between 1/2 and 2 millimeters; the\r\n    more angled the nut, the thicker the shell.\r\n\r\n    (17) All of the hickory nuts tested had sweet, edible seeds. The\r\n    seed coats varied from a light tan to a bronze in color.\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\n\r\nWithin the single species of nut tree called shagbark hickory, _Carya\r\novata_ (Mill.) K. Koch., in central New York, there exists a great\r\ndegree of diversity. However, in spite of these differences, the\r\nexamined sample trees may be placed without a question in their proper\r\ngenus and species and the author would venture the opinion that the\r\nadvisability of placing variety names on portions of the species is a\r\ndoubtful and hazardous procedure until much more is known concerning the\r\nspecies than is known at present.\r\n\r\nMR. PAPE: This paper is the result of the fact that some of us down in\r\nIndiana are losing 75 to 95 per cent of our hickory crop each year by\r\nthe curculio, and what we are trying to do is work up a little interest\r\nwith this paper, so at the conclusion of this we can get a discussion\r\nstarted and learn the experiences of other people. Maybe you will be\r\nable to help us down in Indiana.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Control of the Hickory Weevil (Curculio caryae)\r\n\r\nEDWARD W. PAPE, _Marion, Indiana_\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is our thought that if some effort were made to bring to this\r\nassembly, a digest of what has been done to control the Hickory weevil,\r\nwe might arouse enough interest to carry on some experiments.\r\n\r\nIf, at the conclusion of this paper, we can get enough discussion, we\r\nwill be able to avail ourselves of the knowledge and experiences of\r\nothers who have made attempts to control this pest, it would be to our\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nThe Pecan weevil of the south and the Hickory weevil are identical and\r\nwe learn the following from the experiments carried out by G. F.\r\nMoznette, Bureau of Entomology, U.S.D.A.\r\n\r\nPecan weevil damage is of two types--(1) that resulting from attack\r\nbefore the shell-hardening period in July and August and causing all\r\naffected nuts to drop, and (2) that resulting from attack after kernel\r\nformation and usually causing the shuck of infested nuts to stick tight\r\nto the shell instead of opening normally. Weevil-injured nuts of the\r\nsecond type contain grubs which destroy the kernels, or they contain\r\nholes about one-eighth inch in diameter which mature grubs have bored\r\nand through which they escaped after destroying the kernels. The first\r\ntype of damage often passes unnoticed and is due to the feeding of early\r\nemerging weevils, which puncture the immature nuts with their long\r\nlancelike beaks to feed on the juices within. Since all nuts punctured\r\nin this way before the shell-hardening period drop to the ground, the\r\nentire crop may be lost if weevils are abundant and the crop is light.\r\nSuch damage may be heavy even when a large crop is attacked. The second\r\ntype of damage is generally noticeable at harvest-time in October and\r\nNovember, and in seasons when large numbers of weevils have been present\r\npractically the entire crop may be wormy at harvest.\r\n\r\nSince the weevils do not feed very much on the outer surface of\r\ndeveloping pecan nuts, stomach poisons applied to trees have been of\r\nlittle practical value in control. In 1944, however, laboratory tests\r\nshowed that DDT could kill the adults, and that it was worthy of field\r\ntrial.\r\n\r\nField tests were made at Fort Valley, Georgia, with DDT and the\r\nconclusions drawn from these tests show that the effectiveness of two\r\napplications of DDT at the rate of 6 pounds of a 50-percent wettable\r\npowder to 100 gallons of water in reducing harvest infestations to 1\r\npercent gives rise to the hope that this treatment, applied for several\r\nseasons, will eliminate a pecan weevil infestation in an orchard, or\r\nwill reduce it to such an extent that spraying every year will not be\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nThe time of the first application of DDT cannot be based on the time of\r\nthe first drop of nuts, because other pecan insects also cause the nuts\r\nto drop during July and August. However, pecan growers who wish to make\r\nthe effort can time the first application accurately by spreading a\r\nsheet on the ground beneath an infested tree and lightly jarring the\r\nbranches to dislodge the weevils. When the weevils are disturbed they\r\nfall and \"play possum\" and can be easily collected. When a minimum of\r\nsix weevils can be taken by jarring the branches on any one tree, it is\r\ntime to make the first application.\r\n\r\nWhile the above will probably give an indication as to what can be done,\r\nusing DDT to control the Hickory weevil, for those who have large\r\nplantings and can afford the expensive spraying equipment necessary, it\r\nwill be necessary to look farther for control methods for the small\r\norchard, where expensive equipment is not feasible.\r\n\r\nThe following is part of a letter from Dr. C. C. Compton, Entomologist\r\nfor the Julius Hyman and Company.\r\n\r\n\"It is our thought that since DIELDRIN is so highly toxic to\r\nCurculionids it might be possible to take advantage of the habits of\r\nthis insect and control it by spraying the soil surface. The larval\r\nstage of this insect leaves the nuts and enters the soil sometime in the\r\nfall. It is believed that the larvae penetrate the soil rather deeply,\r\nto a depth of perhaps a foot or more and remain in the soil over winter.\r\nIn the spring or early summer the larvae transform to adults and emerge\r\nto lay their eggs. In some regions at least the adults do not emerge\r\nuntil the second year after the larvae enter the ground.\r\n\r\nIt is our thought that if DIELDRIN was applied to the surface of the\r\nsoil that many of the larvae would be killed upon entering the soil or\r\nwould be killed at some later time when the adults emerge.\r\n\r\nDr. C. L. Fluke at the University of Wisconsin has been working for the\r\npast several years with DIELDRIN applied as an orchard spray for the\r\ncontrol of plum curculio. In Dr. Fluke's work he applied the DIELDRIN to\r\nthe orchard floor or cover. He has had some very promising results. Dr.\r\nFluke has used two application rates, namely, six pounds and three\r\npounds of DIELDRIN per acre. Since he obtained a high degree of control\r\nat the three pound level, it would seem worthwhile to investigate the\r\npossibilities of applying even a lower rate, say one and a half pounds\r\nper acre. In Dr. Fluke's work he applied the DIELDRIN to the soil in the\r\norchard using a DIELDRIN emulsifiable concentrate containing one and a\r\nhalf pounds per gallon.\r\n\r\nDIELDRIN is now available impregnated on a 30-60 mesh attapulgus clay.\r\nSuch formulations are now available containing 5%, 10%, and 15%\r\nDIELDRIN. The DIELDRIN granules would appear to have certain advantages\r\nover liquid sprays where the grove has considerable ground cover. A high\r\npercentage of the insecticide is retained by the cover and does not\r\nreach the soil. The 30-60 mesh granules have the advantage of\r\npenetrating even the densest cover and their application results in a\r\nmaximum deposit of the insecticide on the soil surface.\r\n\r\nGroves or orchards under cultivation can be sprayed or treated with the\r\ngranules. In either case it is advisable to disc the insecticide into\r\nthe soil following application.\r\n\r\nThe granules are free flowing and can be applied quite readily with any\r\nfertilizer or distributor.\r\n\r\nWithout any field experience to go by it would seem that a 5% 30-60 mesh\r\nDIELDRIN granule formulation would be most convenient to use. By using a\r\n5% DIELDRIN granule material you would obtain a dosage of 1-1/2 pound of\r\nactual DIELDRIN per acre by applying 30 pounds of granules per acre.\r\nLikewise, 60 pounds of the granules per acre would give a dosage of 3\r\npound of DIELDRIN. On the basis of work done with DIELDRIN for the\r\ncontrol of the Japanese beetle, 3 pounds of DIELDRIN per acre will\r\ncontrol this insect for more than 5 years. While it is not safe to\r\nassume that we could expect the same results in the case of the Hickory\r\nweevil, it does give us something to go by.\"\r\n\r\nIt seems likely that the foregoing will create some interest and that by\r\nthe time of the next annual meeting we should have the results from the\r\nuse of DIELDRIN to control the Hickory weevil.\r\n\r\nMR. PAPE: It is my thought now if we could get a little discussion here\r\nconcerning what some of you have been doing to control this pest, we\r\nmight get somewhere, or at least get enough suggestions or get enough\r\nparties interested to carry on some experiments in different parts of\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nMR. SILVIS: What company makes Dieldrin?\r\n\r\nMR. PAPE: Julius Hyman Company is the one that sent the most literature\r\nand Shell Corporation local agents handle it. Also in Indiana the Farm\r\nBureau Cooperative store handles it. The cost in small quantities is two\r\npounds for 85 cents.\r\n\r\nMR. KYHL: Is Dieldrin poison?\r\n\r\nMR. PAPE: It's poison like all of these modern sprays, but it isn't as\r\ndangerous as Parathion.\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: In Virginia I have had no experience with DDT, except with\r\nchestnut, and it takes three sprays at two-week intervals to control the\r\npest.\r\n\r\nDR. GRAVES: What time of the year?\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: Apply the last spray about two weeks before the nuts ripen.\r\nThat means, with us, starting in late July. You have to figure it for\r\nyour own region.\r\n\r\nMR. GRAVATT: There is literature available from the Bureau of Entomology\r\nin Washington on spraying to control pecan and chestnut weevils. They\r\nhave done quite a bit of research on it.\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: If this ground treatment is effective, I'd like to try it.\r\nIt's a lot easier.\r\n\r\nMR. PAPE: That would be very nice if you would repeat the work in\r\nVirginia. I know that the Pecan Growers will work on the problem in the\r\nSouth. If we could get work done in the Central States, it would be an\r\nadvantage for all of us.\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: In my area the control of the pest is complicated by the\r\npresence of the chinquapin.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT BEST: We have a surprise feature this afternoon. Dr. Graves of\r\nthe Connecticut Experiment station, who, as you know, is the father of a\r\nlot of this work on chestnuts, has consented to discuss with us certain\r\nnew procedures that he used in grafting chestnuts.\r\n\r\nDR. GRAVES: We have worked with this method of inarching blighted\r\nchestnuts so long and found it so successful that I felt it my duty to\r\ntell you people something about it. It's really a method of cure for the\r\nblight on Oriental chestnuts and their hybrids. I have not found it to\r\nwork well on the American chestnut.\r\n\r\nNow, suppose we have our tree, with a blighted area on the trunk. I am\r\nassuming that the blight starts near the base of the tree as it usually\r\ndoes.\r\n\r\nWhen you see it, you cut it out with a sharp knife removing the bark to\r\nthe wood. Blighted trees send up shoots from the base, below the\r\nblighted bark. So you take one of these shoots, sharpen it at the top\r\nand insert this sharpened tip under the healthy bark at the top of the\r\nblighted area. The shoot should be a little longer than the blighted\r\narea so that you can get a spring to the shoot as you push its tip in\r\nbetween the bark and the trunk. Even if it goes up above and breaks the\r\nbark a little bit, it doesn't matter. This inarched shoot renews the\r\nconnection between the leaves and the roots across the blighted area.\r\n\r\nYou know the leaves make the food of the tree, which goes down in the\r\nbark to the roots. The reason blight kills these trees is that it begins\r\nto girdle and sometimes does girdle the tree and destroys the connection\r\nbetween the leaves and the roots, so the roots eventually die. But by\r\nthis method of inarching you restore that connection between leaves and\r\nroots.\r\n\r\nNow, you'd be surprised to see how well that's worked with us. We tried\r\nit first in 1937. We have been doing it now for 16 years. Every spring\r\nwe take our trees that show the blight, our hybrids and Oriental\r\nchestnuts, and inarch, and the whole thing doesn't take more than a few\r\nminutes. Then after our shoot is inarched here, we tie it with\r\nold-fashioned string. The tips of the inarched grafts should be covered\r\nwith grafting wax or paraffin.\r\n\r\nThe scion will probably send out shoots which should be removed. And\r\nanother thing, cut the string when you know the graft has taken above.\r\n\r\nIf the blighted area is higher up in the tree, you can use bridge graft.\r\nThis, you can see, is a kind of bridge grafting. But in bridge grafting,\r\nthe scion must be anchored in the bark both above and below the lesion.\r\n\r\nAs I say, we have cured our hybrids. There doesn't need to be anybody\r\nlosing a Chinese chestnut tree ever, using this method. No sense in it.\r\nYou can usually do this grafting in the spring about April when the\r\nleaves and the buds are beginning to show their green.\r\n\r\nAny questions?\r\n\r\nMR. DAVIDSON: You say you paint the wood?\r\n\r\nDR. GRAVES: Yes, with any ordinary paint. There is a tree wood paint, I\r\nknow, that's better, but we use ordinary paint.\r\n\r\nMeeting adjourned at 4:50 o'clock, p.m.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMONDAY EVENING SESSION\r\n\r\n\"What's Your Problem?\"--Round Table Discussion\r\n\r\n_Moderator_: J. W. McKay\r\n\r\n_Panel_: J. C. McDaniel, D. C. Snyder, Jesse D. Diller, Stephen Bernath\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. MCKAY: In these panel discussions the moderator usually lays a\r\nlittle background as an introduction to the subject of the evening. This\r\ntitle came from a conversation with Dr. Crane. We were talking about\r\npeople asking questions about their problems, and decided to have a\r\npanel discussion. Right there we chose the title, \"What's your problem?\"\r\n\r\nAll of us have problems to deal with in every walk of life. We run up\r\nagainst difficulties, and usually much of our time is taken up in\r\nsolving or coping with them. At Beltsville we answer a great many\r\nletters, and a great many people ask us about their problems. In\r\nanswering problems, we push the industry forward, because we remove\r\nsomething that is holding it back.\r\n\r\nSometimes the answer to a problem is found by trying to analyze our\r\nsuccesses. In growing nut trees we may have an unusually good crop on a\r\nparticular variety or tree. The question is, why does that tree bear\r\nwell that particular year, and very frequently it is difficult to\r\nunderstand why. It is very difficult, for example, in the case of one\r\nsuccess, to repeat that success, because the second time you try to do\r\nit, something else comes in, and you probably have a failure and, well,\r\nyou don't know why. It is frequently very difficult to analyze our\r\nsuccesses. Another way of stating it is, of course, that our successes\r\nare often Nature's gift, and we do not know the factors and the forces\r\nthat go into that gift.\r\n\r\nI want to digress here just a little bit by quoting one thing that Mr.\r\nBest said. I wish, by the way, that we could incorporate some of his\r\nhomey philosophy into some of our minutes so as to really benefit by\r\nsome of his remarks. I was impressed this morning by his statement in\r\ndealing with a \"fairyland of nuts,\" you remember that language he used,\r\n\"no diseases, no insects, no failures.\"\r\n\r\nDR. MACDANIEL: No squirrels.\r\n\r\nDR. MCKAY: Wouldn't that be wonderful? I was impressed with another\r\nthing he said; I wrote it down here: \"People are not going to break down\r\nwith emotion when we talk about the old hollow tree down in the corner\r\nof the pasture where the 'possums were hatched.\" Language like that, to\r\nme, strikes a very harmonious note. I want to continue this digression a\r\nlittle to consider the fact that all of us, in a sense, are hobbyists in\r\nnut growing.\r\n\r\nHobbies in this day and age are coming to be more important all the\r\ntime, because of the fast pace at which we live. We need to leave our\r\nregular duties once in a while and get out in the garden or the forest\r\nwhere we can observe nature and get away from some of the stresses and\r\nstrains that modern living places upon us.\r\n\r\nOn this trip we were taking a hike along the north rim of Grand Canyon\r\nin an organized nature walk. The trees, bushes and flowers were all\r\nlabelled right down the walk, and we came to this little poem on a\r\nregulation label. It goes like this:\r\n\r\n   \"If you keep your nose to the grindstone rough,\r\n     And you keep it there long enough,\r\n   You will cease to hear the birds that sing,\r\n     And the brooks that babble in early spring,\r\n   And finally all that your world will compose,\r\n     Will be the grindstone and your poor, old nose.\"\r\n\r\nSo that little poem strikes a real note about a person's hobby. You keep\r\nyour nose to the grindstone, you will forget all these things. You need\r\nto get away from the grindstone once in a while. I don't mean to neglect\r\nyour work, but I do mean to at least take a little time to go out and\r\nlook at your trees and forget your troubles and relax and get away from\r\nthe stresses and strains that modern living places on us.\r\n\r\nGoing back now to the subject; we asked you, through the Nutshell and\r\nthrough members of the Program Committee, to send in the biggest problem\r\nin connection with whatever nut species you grow.\r\n\r\nThe seventeen replies received included eight problems as follows: (1)\r\nbrooming disease of walnut; (2) early vegetating particularly of\r\nCarpathian walnut and frost damage resulting therefrom; (3) delayed\r\nfruiting of chestnut seedlings; (4) season too short for ripening of\r\nfruit; (5) squirrels get the nuts; (6) failure of hicans to set fruit;\r\n(7) grafting problems under which are grouped all asexual propagation\r\nand cuttings; and, finally, (8) getting hickory trees established.\r\n\r\nThis is a rather low number, but I think out of those eight problems\r\nsubmitted you have a good representation of some of the things about\r\nwhich members of this Association talk when they come to meetings. I\r\nwill first ask the audience if there is any one who would like to ask a\r\nparticular question at this time.\r\n\r\nMR. BECKER: At the Weber planting at Rockport, Indiana last year, we saw\r\nno nuts on the trees. I would like to know what is the cause for those\r\ntrees not bearing.\r\n\r\nDR. MACDANIEL: I would think that failure to bear was caused by a\r\ncombination of things; lack of soil fertility, in the first place, soil\r\nphysical conditions, probably insect damage and diseases like\r\nanthracnose keeping the trees from being vigorous, overcrowding now,\r\nwith many of them, and perhaps to some extent genetic, some varieties\r\nthat just naturally don't fruit very heavily.\r\n\r\nDR. McKAY: Any others in the audience care to comment on that question?\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: Weather conditions, freezing may have caused it.\r\n\r\nDR. MACDANIELS: My impression was that the trees were starving to death.\r\nCutting down the competition with the weeds and feeding them nitrate\r\nwould help.\r\n\r\nDR. MCKAY: I think most members felt there that the trees were probably\r\ncrowding each other.\r\n\r\nMR. BECKER: They had never borne, had they?\r\n\r\nMR. WILKINSON: I don't like to comment on it. My opinion is it's due to\r\nthe undergrowth under the trees. Keeping the circulation of the air to\r\nthe roots of the trees has an effect on its non-bearing. Up until they\r\nquit cultivating and pasturing the orchard, it bore, but after they\r\nquit, production stopped. There is a two- or three-year growth of grass\r\nand weeds, a mat on the ground, and I think it's a lack of air to the\r\nroots of the trees.\r\n\r\nDR. MCKAY: Mr. Wilkinson, I heard the question raised as to whether the\r\norchard had ever produced heavily or not. Can you answer that?\r\n\r\nMR. WILKINSON: Yes, it certainly did for several years. As long as it\r\nwas cared for, it was a heavy producer.\r\n\r\nDR. MCKAY: How long ago was that, could you say?\r\n\r\nMR. WILKINSON: That's been eight years and farther back. Nothing has\r\nbeen done for it in the past eight years.\r\n\r\nMR. BEST: May I make a comment? Last year in our part of the country,\r\nwhich is a little bit west of the orchard we are talking about, we had\r\nalmost zero weather in November before the leaves were off of the trees,\r\nand I felt that that took all the buds off our trees. We didn't have any\r\nnuts even on varieties that would bear every year. There are hardly any.\r\nAnd I think that cold freeze in the fall before the buds really got\r\nready for it did a lot of damage.\r\n\r\nDR. MACDANIEL: I believe that was a factor in the light walnut crop in\r\nthat area last year, though some trees did bear.\r\n\r\nDR. MCKAY: Of course, I think many of us fail to realize that a tree is\r\na thing that's confined to one spot, and when it fills the ground with\r\nfeeding roots and mines the soil of all nutrients near it, it's stymied,\r\nso to speak, until we give it some more food. Isn't that right, Dr.\r\nCrane.\r\n\r\nDR. CRANE: That's right.\r\n\r\nDR. MCKAY: And trees, when they reach out as far as they can and can't\r\nget any more food and no more leaves are allowed to fall on the ground,\r\nnature doesn't add any nutrients anymore, naturally, those trees are in\r\na bad way and will continue to be until fertilizer is applied in some\r\nway.\r\n\r\nA MEMBER: I'd like to trim my Persian walnuts so I can walk under the\r\nlowest limb. Does that have an adverse effect upon the bearing of the\r\ntree?\r\n\r\nMR. BERNATH: I don't think that's good, to trim them too high. I think\r\nthe lower the tree the better it handles all along. Take the fruit\r\ngrowers, they aim to have the trees as low as possible to make picking\r\nand spraying easy. If you prune a tree, especially the Persian walnut,\r\ntoo much, it will have a bad effect on the tree.\r\n\r\nDR. McKAY: What about the effect on bearing?\r\n\r\nMR. BERNATH: You won't have fruit for several years until the tree\r\nrecovers what it has lost in foliage.\r\n\r\nMR. KINTZEL: I have followed the orchards in California, and I have\r\nnoticed they follow the practice of leaving the lower branches on the\r\ntrees, and I have noticed that the lower branches have a lot of nuts on\r\nthem, also. The branches are hanging down on the ground.\r\n\r\nMR. KERR: In France and Germany, they are crazy to get wood, and so they\r\ncut off all the low limbs. I have a Persian walnut that is beside the\r\nwalk, and they cut off the low limbs because they hit the sidewalk. This\r\nyear I got a tremendous crop.\r\n\r\nMR. SILVIS: I think this man has a tree that he wants to walk under.\r\nUnder these circumstances he can cut off the low limbs. I agree with Mr.\r\nBernath, however, that it will reduce the crop for two or three years.\r\n\r\nMR. BERNATH: Yes, but he should start pruning when the tree is young. A\r\ntree is just like a child: you have to start to train them while they\r\nare young.\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: You must consider the tree at all ages. In the young tree Mr.\r\nBernath is right, it will produce sooner if you leave all the leaves on.\r\nBut we must consider the mature tree. The branches that are low to the\r\nground have to have the sunlight and if they do not get it they become\r\npractically barren during later years. If the lower branches are cut\r\nback when they are young and the tree headed higher, the Persian walnut\r\nwill have a trunk, say, 10 feet to 14 feet to the first limb, but these\r\nwill produce walnuts ultimately. I think the gentleman is right in\r\nhaving the tree pruned high enough to walk under, and he will get more\r\nnuts in the long run than if he lets the lower limbs develop and then\r\neventually cut them down.\r\n\r\nDR. MACDANIEL: We had an example of that with that huge black walnut tree\r\nwith black walnuts starting out 30 feet in the air arching down and\r\ntouching the ground. But you wouldn't want to do that immediately with a\r\nyoung tree, take all the branches up so high.\r\n\r\nA MEMBER: Do you have any control for the stink bug on filberts?\r\n\r\nDR. MCKAY: We haven't worked with the control of stink bug, because it\r\nis what might be classed as one of our minor problems. The damage is not\r\nso great but what we can overlook it at the present time.\r\n\r\nDR. CRANE: In pecan and almond growing in California the effective\r\ncontrol measure for stink bug is the elimination of the host plants on\r\nwhich the stink bug breeds. Peach growers have the same problem. Stink\r\nbug will, if allowed to multiply in a peach orchard, ruin the peaches,\r\nmaking injuries very similar to that caused by the plum curculio. The\r\nonly satisfactory method of control of stink bug injury is to eliminate\r\nthe host plants on which they live, such as most legume plants,\r\nblackberry briars and other brambles. In an orchard, in a grass sod,\r\nstink bug is no problem, but where we have soy beans or cow peas or\r\nsomething like that growing in the orchard, or we have blackberry briars\r\nor wild raspberries nearby, stink bug is a bad problem.\r\n\r\nDR. GRAVATT: I have filbert trees, and the stink bug gets practically\r\nall the nuts. The entomologists looked into the situation, and the\r\ncondition that Dr. Crane mentioned was borne out. If there are\r\nblackberries around, it will be quite a problem to control the stink\r\nbugs.\r\n\r\nDR. MCKAY: Now I am going to take up the problems that have been sent in\r\nby mail. The one dealing with early vegetating and frost damage to\r\nPersian walnuts was sent in by the most people.\r\n\r\nMr. Snyder lives in a fairly cold country. I am going to ask him to give\r\nus his ideas on this problem and what might be done with it.\r\n\r\nMR. SNYDER: I am not qualified to discuss that problem, because we can't\r\ndo anything much with Carpathian walnuts. We do have some grafted this\r\nyear, and we will have one, in particular, Carpathian, No. 5--I don't\r\nknow where it got that number--Crath No. 5, I believe it is, on a young\r\ngrafted black walnut tree which is ripening up almost ahead of the black\r\nwalnut, and both have made a remarkable growth. But so far as the spring\r\nis concerned, I don't know how they will come out.\r\n\r\nDR. MCKAY: Mr. Bernath, what are your views? You live in a fairly cold\r\narea. You propagate Persian walnuts. What is your opinion of this\r\nproblem?\r\n\r\nMR. BERNATH: Well, there is a way to help that situation. After the\r\nground freezes, keep that ground frozen. That will delay the growth of\r\nthat tree, if you have the time and patience to keep the ground frozen.\r\n\r\nMR. SNYDER: I don't believe it.\r\n\r\nMR. BERNATH: Yes, it will.\r\n\r\nDR. MCKAY: It seems to me we have a difference of opinion here between\r\nMr. Snyder and Mr. Bernath. The question is this: During a warm spell in\r\nthe spring will a tree with frozen roots grow up here in the air. That's\r\nthe question.\r\n\r\n(There was a chorus of \"yes\"es from the audience).\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: I would say that one good solution is to select late\r\nvegetating varieties. Mr. Oakes in a report to me on the blooming habits\r\nof Persian walnuts, stated that the variety Schaeffer did not start\r\ngrowth until the 29th of April. That is almost four weeks later than\r\nmost other varieties. And I know from the tabulations that I have made\r\nthat some varieties are weeks ahead of others. So let's select the late\r\nvarieties that are good and worthwhile and plant those.\r\n\r\nIn my section our latest spring frost averages the 20th of April, and\r\nyet I have several varieties that do not bloom until after the first of\r\nMay. That's the ideal condition.\r\n\r\nDR. MCKAY: That's true, Mr. Stoke, but here is another point to\r\nconsider. Persian walnuts have a short cold requirement, you know that.\r\nHence, in February or early March or any time, even in January, when we\r\nhave a warm spell of a week or ten days or even shorter, sap will rise\r\nin the trees, and they will start to grow.\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: Not all. In plants of some varieties new growth will hardly\r\nstart.\r\n\r\nDR. MCKAY: Perhaps you may have varieties that will not start, but the\r\ntendency is to start.\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: If you have one with that early tendency, cut it out.\r\n\r\nDR. MCKAY: I'd like to get back to this opinion here on the question of\r\nfrozen ground, dormant roots and the effect it has on the top of the\r\ntree. Now, how about our academicians over here, Dr. MacDaniels or Dr.\r\nCrane. Let's hear from one of you.\r\n\r\nDR. MACDANIELS: It is my opinion that with a walnut tree of good size\r\nthe frozen ground would have little or no effect on the buds starting\r\ngrowth. The twigs and the trunk would warm up to the temperature of the\r\nair, and when that happens growth occurs. Water is available from that\r\nin the trunk and the deeper roots. This would happen regardless of how\r\nthe surface roots were treated.\r\n\r\nDR. MACDANIEL: Or whether the tree had any roots on at the time.\r\n\r\nDR. MACDANIELS: The best solution to the frost damage problem is to find\r\ntrees which vegetate late enough to avoid the spring frosts. Somewhere\r\non this terrestrial globe there must be some, because I remember years\r\nago J. F. Jones sent out some Persian walnuts of Chinese origin. I\r\nplanted three, and they did not start any growth until about the first\r\nof July, and they were still growing strong when frost hit them in the\r\nfall. Now, somewhere in between these extremes, somewhere in the\r\nclimatic analogue of our region we will find Persian walnuts which will\r\nhave a delayed vegetating period, and that will be the final answer. At\r\nleast, I think so.\r\n\r\nDR. MACDANIEL: I'd like to ask a question. In F-2 hybrid walnuts do you\r\nfind much segregation of those for later initiation of vegetation?\r\n\r\nDR. MCKAY: Yes, we find in those seedlings in some cases the tendency to\r\nvegetate very early and others very late. The most striking case that I\r\nknow is an F-1 hybrid which is a very, very late starter in the spring.\r\nIt is perfectly dormant when the other young walnuts are in practically\r\nfull leaf. We do not have any offspring from that particular one yet,\r\nbut it gives us some hope that from this hybrid we may get something\r\nlater.\r\n\r\nMR. BECKER: With us I don't think this early vegetation means anything.\r\nWe are in Michigan. Dark, cold weather continues until about the middle\r\nof May, when frost ends, and then all of a sudden spring breaks loose,\r\neverything comes out, and we don't have any setback, as a rule, from\r\nthen on. So early vegetation matters little, means nothing, the way I\r\nfeel about it.\r\n\r\nDR. CRANE: Mr. Moderator, you ought to point out that most of the United\r\nStates isn't Michigan. If we had climatic conditions that Michigan has,\r\nwe wouldn't have that problem, but this problem becomes much more acute,\r\nfor example, as you go south.\r\n\r\nThe north knows nothing about cold injury, absolutely nothing. If you\r\nwant to see cold injury, you go south. I told Dr. George Potter that\r\ntwelve years ago. He was born and raised in Wisconsin and spent 17 years\r\nin the mountains of New Hampshire. I told him he never saw any winter\r\ninjury, and he said, \"Why, I never heard such a wild statement in my\r\nlife.\" Well, that was because of the fact he had never seen it. He has\r\nbeen in the South now for 12 years, and he says, \"You made a very\r\ntruthful statement.\" He has seen the injury.\r\n\r\nIn Oregon in 1950 or '51 we had a fall freeze. The temperature was\r\nmeasured by the Experiment Station in Eastern Oregon, where they are\r\ntrying to grow some fruit and nut trees so they will have something else\r\nto eat besides sage brush. They had extensive plantings of walnuts,\r\nMayette, Franquette and all of those hardy varieties, and along with\r\nthem they had some Carpathians. The temperature there in the fall\r\ndropped to 36 degrees below zero, and all of their walnuts of these\r\nother strains were killed to the ground, but the Carpathian came through\r\nuninjured. In the spring of the year however it warmed up, the\r\nCarpathians leafed out and were about ready to bloom when there was a\r\nsharp freeze, and the Carpathians sure got it in the neck. So what\r\ndifference does it make whether you lose the trees in the winter or you\r\nlose them in the spring? You have lost them just the same. I think we\r\nought to hear Spencer Chase cite the history of their big collection of\r\nCarpathians in Tennessee Valley Authority. I understand from him that\r\nthey have never fruited any Carpathians down there at all. It's not\r\nwinter hardiness, it's this early foliation. So we have got a lot of\r\nareas that are vastly different from that peninsula in Michigan which\r\nthe Good Lord designed to make a favored country in a lot of respects.\r\n\r\nDR. MCKAY: I recognize Mr. Devitt, who is here from Canada and is well\r\nqualified to discuss Reverend Crath's work there.\r\n\r\nMR. DEVITT: It is interesting to me to hear of this early budding and\r\nlate fruiting. Along the north shore of Lake Ontario and down through\r\nthe Niagara Peninsula our climate is quite consistent. There was only\r\none year when we had a late frost--it was on May 19th. That was in the\r\nyear 1936. Every other year since they have bloomed every year.\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: I'd like to speak of a tree Mr. Crath sent me. The tree was\r\nbearing in Toronto 20 years ago. With me it winter kills sometime in the\r\nwinter each year, I don't know when. In some years it has been killed\r\nback to 5-year-old wood, and this spring I found it was all dead. This\r\ntree comes out of dormancy as soon as the sun gets warm. It's hardy in\r\nToronto but not hardy in Virginia.\r\n\r\nDR. MCKAY: I think you can all see why this problem is one of the most\r\nacute ones we have to deal with today. This variation over the country\r\nin the behavior of this so-called hardy strain of walnut is of great\r\ninterest now to people everywhere. People are believing that it can be\r\ngrown, and there are still problems we have not solved. I would like to\r\nhave just a brief statement from Spencer Chase on the performance of\r\nCarpathian varieties at Norris, Tennessee.\r\n\r\nMR. CHASE: We reported this, I think, at our Beltsville meeting several\r\nyears ago. Trees we had at Norris are Carpathian types secured from the\r\nWisconsin Horticultural Society about 1940. After two years in the\r\nnursery they were planted, and last year, 1952, was the first year that\r\nthey bore any nuts. But that was simply because we did not have a late\r\nfrost last year. This year, they were all frosted again. So we have, in\r\nthe South, from Virginia and Tennessee to a little farther southward,\r\na problem of early vegetation of English walnuts. We should encourage\r\neveryone to watch for any late vegetating kinds for trial in the South.\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: Dr. Dunstan reported two walnut trees in North Carolina,\r\nwhere the season is about ten days earlier than at my place in Virginia\r\nthat blossomed after the first of May. I am going to investigate these\r\ntrees further.\r\n\r\nDR. MCKAY: We have about five minutes that we might devote to some other\r\nproblem. Nearly all of us do grafting work of one sort or another. Do I\r\nhave a question from the floor on grafting?\r\n\r\nMR. MACHOVINA: With cleft grafts or splice grafts held with grafting\r\nrubbers, do you have to cut the rubbers?\r\n\r\nDR. MACDANIEL: If it's a chestnut and you have it waxed, I think the\r\nanswer is yes.\r\n\r\nMR. MACHOVINA: The wax is a hot wax and the rubber does not disintegrate\r\nvery quickly.\r\n\r\nDR. MACDANIEL: Probably you will have to cut it on species in which the\r\ngrowth bulges up between the turns of the rubber. This is true of\r\nchestnuts in particular, possibly persimmons, walnuts probably not quite\r\nso much trouble. Let's hear from one of the nurserymen.\r\n\r\nMR. BERNATH: I think the best way is after the union is firm enough, to\r\ncut the rubber with a sharp knife.\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: I'd make one qualification. I said I didn't think you had to\r\ncut rubber. I think that's true with grafting above ground. Underneath\r\nground, with moisture around it, it should be cut.\r\n\r\nMR. BERNATH: If you leave the rubber on and bury it, that lasts for\r\nyears. Even above ground you find it sometimes.\r\n\r\nMR. PATAKY: If you get a fast-growing callus, you have to cut the rubber\r\nband, but if it is rather slow you don't. I do a lot of budding with\r\nroses. I don't cut the rubber bands off, because they will eventually\r\ndrop off. If you graft a black walnut or Persian, you will have to cut\r\nit or it will girdle the graft.\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: It doesn't do it for me.\r\n\r\nA MEMBER: Has anybody done work with polyethylene film in grafting?\r\n\r\nMR. BECKER: I hesitate to tell you my experiment. I don't think much of\r\nit. I used polyethylene bags on chestnuts early in the season, and\r\npractically every one grew, but everything else that was out in the hot\r\nsun boiled. In the hot weather of June the grafts actually cook in the\r\nbags.\r\n\r\nMR. MACHOVINA: Did you use a bag over the whole graft, or just a tube\r\naround it?\r\n\r\nMR. BECKER: A bag over the whole thing. I have a few Carpathian grafts\r\nthat grew well. I think I have better luck with hot wax than anything\r\nelse.\r\n\r\nDR. McKAY: Our time is up. I want to thank the panel, although we didn't\r\nwork you too hard. The panel is adjourned.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT BEST: Dr. Gravatt will show a film entitled: \"It Bringeth\r\nForth Much Fruit.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDR. GRAVATT: Mr. President, ladies and gentlemen, you all are familiar\r\nwith the fact that the chestnut blight is loose in Europe. It was\r\nreported in Italy in 1938, and it spread rather rapidly in Italy. It had\r\nbeen there many years before they found it. In spite of our numerous\r\nwarnings to get them to watch for it, they let it get away. It has\r\nspread into Switzerland, caused a great deal of damage there with no\r\nhope of saving the larger chestnuts there or in Italy. It's spreading\r\ninto Yugoslavia. They are making very energetic efforts to control the\r\ndisease in Yugoslavia, trying to delay it as much as possible. It\r\nhappens the forest pathologist who handles this work is a young lady,\r\nand she has got the forester and other people interested to try to hold\r\nit back as long as possible.\r\n\r\nThe threat of the chestnut blight to the entire chestnut growth in all\r\nof Southern Europe helped to bring about the organization of an\r\nInternational Chestnut Council and Congress. This is made-up of\r\ndelegates from a number of the European countries, Spain, Portugal,\r\nFrance, Switzerland, Yugoslavia, Greece, Turkey, Japan and the United\r\nStates. They have been meeting every other year, first for two years in\r\nsuccession, but the plan now is to meet every other year. They had a\r\nmeeting in Spain and Portugal this past June, and the State Department\r\npaid my expenses over, and so forth, to attend as a delegate from the\r\nUnited States at this international meeting.\r\n\r\nThe meeting was very enjoyable. They have a very fine system there. They\r\nhire big buses to take you around over the country. Your hotel is all\r\narranged for in advance, and you go sightseeing to the orchards and\r\nutilization plants. We have meetings just here and there along the way\r\nwhere we stop a half day or a day.\r\n\r\nThe next meeting will probably be held in about two years. They have\r\ndecided now that the meetings will be more in the way of conferences,\r\nbecause the last three meetings have been partly sightseeing to observe\r\nchestnut orchards and laboratories.\r\n\r\nThe possibility of holding the meeting in the United States has been\r\ndiscussed by the delegates there. But it involves a lot of expense and\r\nthe delegates were of the opinion that there would be a very small\r\nmeeting in the United States, because the countries over there simply\r\ncouldn't afford the expense of sending them over here.\r\n\r\nThe problem in Italy is very serious, because they have something over a\r\nmillion acres of grafted chestnut orchards, all of which they are\r\nprobably going to lose, and something like a million acres of coppice\r\ngrowth that is going to be damaged but not such a severe loss. In\r\nconnection with the work in Italy I suggested the production of a movie\r\nfilm that could be shown to the Italian people showing the chestnut\r\nindustry and also the chestnut blight. This was to be shown in different\r\nparts of Italy to arouse more interest in watching out for the disease.\r\nThey have more opportunity there of slowing up the disease if they will\r\nwork hard at it, but they are not doing too much.\r\n\r\nAs some of you know when a lot of different people and agencies work on\r\na movie film there must be all sorts of compromises. This was done by a\r\ntemperamental Italian director, and other people had parts in it, so\r\nwhat you see is a compromise. They made 30 copies in Italian. H has been\r\nshown in many moving picture houses, and it is also on the loan basis to\r\nthe United States. There are extensive film loan libraries, located in\r\ndifferent parts of Italy, so any high school, college forestry group can\r\nborrow films showing different operations, many of them prepared in the\r\nUnited States and part of them in Italy.\r\n\r\nDR. MACDANIEL: What about this so-called Korean chestnut? Is it actually\r\na third species?\r\n\r\nDR. GRAVATT: I don't think so, We had quite a bit of argument on this\r\nquestion, because in Spain where I found chestnut blight on chestnuts\r\nbrought from Japan, we found the name Korean chestnut. Sometimes the\r\nKorean chestnut looks more like a Jap, sometimes it looks more like a\r\nChinese, and usually it's sort of a blend between the two. We prefer to\r\nrecognize these two species and call the Korean a natural hybrid. Both\r\nspecies are grown in pure form in Korea, and they intercross readily,\r\nand we do not regard it as a new species.\r\n\r\nMR. WILSON: Are the Italian enough aware of their problem so that they\r\nwill have developed an Asiatic chestnut in time to replace their present\r\norchards, so that there will not be an interim?\r\n\r\nDR. GRAVATT: There will be a big interim. That's an opportunity in this\r\ncountry to get the market before the Italians ever come back, I think.\r\n\r\n(The film, \"It Bringeth Forth Much Fruit\" was shown.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe International Chestnut Commission and the Chestnut Blight Problem in\r\nEurope, 1953\r\n\r\nG. FLIPPO GRAVATT, _Senior Pathologist, U. S. Plant Industry Station,\r\nBeltsville, Maryland_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe International Chestnut Commission was organized under the auspices\r\nof the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations. The aim\r\nof the Commission is to promote international cooperation in the study\r\nof all scientific, technical, and economic questions relating to\r\nchestnut growing. The main problem facing all chestnut culture in Europe\r\nis the rapid spread of the chestnut blight. France, Italy, Japan,\r\nPortugal, Spain, Switzerland, Turkey, United States and Yugoslavia are\r\nmembers of the organization. A representative from the F.A.O. in Rome\r\nserves as Secretary of the Commission. An international conference on\r\nchestnut problems was held in France in 1950, the first meeting of the\r\nCommission was held in Italy and Switzerland in 1951 and the second in\r\nSpain and Portugal, June 18-30, 1953. The average attendance at the\r\nmeetings was 50 to 60 persons. I have attended all three conferences as\r\nthe representative from the U.S. Departments of State and Agriculture.\r\n\r\nThe International Chestnut Commission meetings differ from the meetings\r\nof the Northern Nut Growers Association in many ways. Our Northern Nut\r\nGrowers Association meets annually for 2-1/2 days while the meetings of\r\nthe International Chestnut Commission last from 10 to 12 days but not\r\nevery year. In Europe the members travel mostly in a large tourist bus,\r\nwhich carries the party for hundreds of miles, visiting nurseries,\r\norchards, chestnut utilization plants and not neglecting the scenic\r\nparts of the route. All lodging and meals are carefully arranged for in\r\nadvance. The group in Europe is made up quite largely of Federal and\r\nState professional workers, University professors, and representatives\r\nfrom the chestnut utilization industries.\r\n\r\nAmong the places which the delegates visited in Spain in 1953 was the\r\nAgricultural Experiment Station at La Coruna, where the Phytophthora ink\r\ndisease of the chestnut has been studied extensively. They also visited\r\nthe Experiment Station at Pontevedra, where new methods of propagating\r\nchestnuts are being studied. At Bilboa and at Villa Presente Nursery,\r\nSantander, we inspected plantings of Asiatic chestnuts; I found chestnut\r\nblight present on several trees at both locations and recommended\r\nimmediate removal of the diseased trees. Fortunately, the Asiatic\r\nchestnuts are some distance from any native European chestnuts at each\r\nplace and, according to the local foresters, the blight has not spread\r\nto the distant stands of native chestnut. Some years ago the Spanish\r\nauthorities imported seed from Asia; chestnut blight probably was\r\nbrought in on these nuts. All infected trees that are found are being\r\ndestroyed, but a thorough inspection and eradication program is needed\r\nto control the disease before it spreads into the native European\r\nchestnut stands, from which the disease probably would spread into\r\nPortugal and southwestern France.\r\n\r\nIn Portugal we inspected many very fine chestnut orchards. These\r\norchards are composed of grafted varieties, with only 3 or 4 varieties\r\nin each locality or region. Because of this there is a more standard nut\r\nproduct in most of Portugal than in the other European countries where\r\nmixtures of local varieties are frequently grown. A very large portion\r\nof the European chestnut orchards in Portugal are made up of seedling\r\ntrees, topworked with local selections. In Portugal most of the orchards\r\nare located on the lower slopes and various crops are grown among the\r\ntrees. In most other European countries the orchards are on rougher\r\nmountain land which is grazed.\r\n\r\nIn Portugal the State Road Department has established a number of\r\nroadside plantings of chestnut. These plantings are very productive. The\r\nState Road Department sells the nut crop to the highest bidder and uses\r\nthe funds for additional roadside tree plantings.\r\n\r\nIn northern Portugal authorities have conducted a large-scale program to\r\ncontrol the Phytophthora ink disease of chestnut by the following\r\ntreatment: The soil is removed from the base of the tree and larger\r\nroots. The base and roots are sprayed with a sticker compound and then\r\ndusted with copper oxide and copper sulfate before the soil is replaced.\r\nTreatment is repeated every 5 to 7 years. Government officials secured\r\nthe cooperation of owners of chestnut stands in treating practically all\r\ntrees over large areas. Although this treatment for the Phytophthora ink\r\ndisease was originally worked out by the Spanish pathologists at La\r\nCoruna, it has not been used extensively in Spain. The Phytophthora root\r\ndisease is damaging chestnut orchards throughout southern Europe. In\r\n1950 I noted that this disease was causing severe damage even in Asia\r\nMinor. In the southern part of the United States this same disease (here\r\ncalled Phytophthora root rot) caused heavy losses at lower elevations.\r\n\r\nThe 1953 Chestnut Commission meeting terminated on June 30 at the famous\r\nPalace Hotel at Bussaco, Portugal, where the Under Secretary of\r\nAgriculture gave the delegates an official farewell dinner. No definite\r\nplans were made for the next meeting of the Commission. It was the\r\ngeneral opinion that a meeting in the United States would be poorly\r\nattended because of the expense of sending the delegates from Europe.\r\n\r\nAfter the conclusion of the meeting, the U. S. Foreign Agriculture\r\nServices sponsored my trip to France, Italy, Switzerland, and\r\nYugoslavia, to consult with Federal and local authorities on their\r\nchestnut blight problems. This disease was found in Genoa, Italy, in\r\n1938; later it was determined that the disease was present at that time\r\nin other localities in Italy. The blight is spreading rapidly and is\r\nalmost completely destroying the orchard and larger forest trees of\r\nEuropean chestnut in Italy in localities where the disease has been\r\npresent for some time. The blight occurs in many areas in northern Italy\r\nand as far south as Naples. The young chestnut coppice is not so\r\nseriously affected, but the losses caused by the blight will make\r\ngrowing coppice on a 10- to 20-year rotation basis less profitable than\r\nformerly.\r\n\r\nThe chestnut blight is abundantly present on the east slopes of the\r\nmountains along the French-Italian border; although it has not yet been\r\nfound in France, its distribution in adjoining Italy makes it highly\r\nprobable that advance spot infections are already present in France. The\r\nblight has spread into Tessin Province in southeastern Switzerland where\r\nit is destroying many of the orchards and forest trees. A large chestnut\r\nextract plant in this Province uses wood in making tannin for leather\r\nmanufacturers. However, this plant, as well as some of the extract\r\nplants in northern Italy, is unable to utilize the chestnut wood as fast\r\nas the blight is killing chestnut trees.\r\n\r\nIn Yugoslavia, chestnut blight is spreading rapidly in the orchards and\r\nnative growth along the Italian border. Authorities are actively cutting\r\nout all advance spot infections, to delay or possibly stop its spread\r\nacross their country. In Yugoslavia, chestnut stands frequently are\r\nwidely separated, a natural advantage in delaying the spread of the\r\nblight.\r\n\r\nChestnut blight has been controlled in western North America, where\r\nchestnut orchards and plantings are not numerous. Scattered infections\r\nhave been found during the last 30 years in California, Oregon,\r\nWashington, and British Columbia; infected trees have been removed.\r\nStrict State Quarantine regulations have been enforced, to prevent\r\nchestnut blight from spreading to the West Coast.\r\n\r\nThe chestnut blight fungus is attacking three of the important oaks of\r\nEurope. The typical fanlike mycelial growth can be observed in the bark\r\nof infected oaks. In 1953 in Yugoslavia I observed vigorous young\r\ndurmast oak (_Quercus petraea_) being killed by the blight. In Italy I\r\nfound the disease killing pubescent oaks (_Q. pubescens_) and causing\r\nminor injury to the holly oak (_Q. ilex_). Before we can estimate the\r\nprobable damage to these European oaks, we need more information on the\r\neffects of this disease on oaks of various ages and under various\r\nenvironmental conditions. In the United States the post oak (_Quercus\r\nstellata_) is the only oak species that has been seriously damaged by\r\nthe blight.\r\n\r\nThus, the blight is threatening not only the native chestnut forest\r\ngrowth and orchards of Europe, but also the oaks. A steady extension of\r\nthe blight throughout Italy can be expected. Advance infections in\r\nYugoslavia are being cut out but how long the disease can be held back\r\ndepends on future efforts along this line. Delay work in Yugoslavia also\r\ndelays the time of loss of the chestnut and damage to the oak growth of\r\nGreece and Turkey. The inspection and eradication work being carried out\r\nin Spain may result in the elimination of this threat to the chestnuts\r\nand oaks in Spain, Portugal and southwest France. However, there is the\r\npossibility of the blight occurring anywhere in Europe. People working\r\nwith chestnut should be on the alert to find and eradicate the first\r\ninfections.\r\n\r\nThe film entitled \"It Bringeth Forth Much Fruit\", shown here today, was\r\nprepared at my suggestion by the U. S. Foreign Agricultural Services at\r\nRome. It is being used to aid local authorities in Italy in attempts to\r\ndelay the spread of the chestnut blight.\r\n\r\nThe Italian authorities, with assistance from the United States Foreign\r\nAgricultural Service, have purchased blight-resistant chestnuts in this\r\ncountry for planting in Italy. These resistant chestnuts are doing very\r\nwell in Italy so far. However, the development of a new orchard industry\r\nwith the Chinese chestnut and its hybrids in Italy will be a slow\r\nprocess. It is expected that shipments of chestnuts from Italy to this\r\ncountry, which is now going on at a rate of 15 to 18 million pounds per\r\nyear, will gradually decrease.\r\n\r\nDR. GRAVATT: I will talk on while they are fixing this next film.\r\n\r\nMuch of the trouble in Italy is that so many of the chestnut orchards\r\nare overgrazed, sadly overgrazed, and as these chestnut orchards are\r\nkilled by the blight, the land is going back into this overgrazed\r\ncondition, which leads to serious erosions. Italy needs all the water\r\nthat can be saved. The mountains are eroded down to the rock in many\r\nareas and when you get to the rock, you can never bring the soil back.\r\nIt's a serious problem to meet because of the tremendous\r\nover-population. Every little twig of wood is used. As these chestnut\r\norchards are killed it's going to be a very difficult problem to plant\r\nthem again because the land is overgrazed. Protecting the plantings\r\nagainst sheep and the goats is quite a problem.\r\n\r\n(The film, \"The Filbert Valleys,\" was shown.)\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: I noticed them grafting chestnut trees several feet from the\r\nground. Why are they doing that?\r\n\r\nDR. GRAVATT: They are doing it in order to develop a quick supply of\r\nscion wood. But the procedure is bad. It is much better to graft close\r\nto the ground, and mound it up with dirt. The blight gets in below the\r\ngraft if the graft is high on the trunk. They have had success grafting\r\nbelow the ground level and find they may get a shoot six feet high the\r\nfirst year.\r\n\r\nDR. MACDANIEL: How about the incompatibility in the graft? Does that\r\nshow up much?\r\n\r\nDR. GRAVATT: We don't know yet, because they always get a certain number\r\nof failures. I looked over quite a lot of grafting of Chinese chestnuts\r\non Japanese-European hybrids, and they are thriving. After four years\r\nthey are already regular trees with big crops on them.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUESDAY MORNING SESSION\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT BEST: Our first paper is \"Rooting Chestnuts from Softwood\r\nCuttings\" by Roger W. Pease.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRooting Chestnuts from Softwood Cuttings\r\n\r\nROGER W. PEASE, _West Virginia Agricultural Experiment Station,\r\nMorgantown, W. Va._\r\n\r\n\r\nSome 15 or 20 years ago the West Virginia Agricultural Experiment\r\nStation undertook to develop, if possible, blight resistant chestnuts\r\nfrom American chestnut stock. With the passage of time the approach to\r\nthe problem has changed. During the early days little thought was given\r\nto procedures for propagation, but recently the emphasis has shifted\r\ntoward methods for propagation when and if there are found hardy,\r\ntimber-type, blight-immune chestnuts of any species.\r\n\r\nThe practicability of budding or grafting chestnuts is debatable. We are\r\nleaving budding and grafting to experienced workers throughout the\r\ncountry and are endeavoring to develop a method for rooting chestnuts\r\nfrom softwood cuttings. Results so far are encouraging, but the work is\r\nstill in the experimental stage. We do not advise anyone to start\r\nrooting chestnuts on a commercial basis, but we hope that further\r\nexperimental work will be done by interested agencies.\r\n\r\nTo give complete details of several years' work would take more time\r\nthan is feasible here. Circular 87, _Growing American Holly from\r\nCuttings--Cold Frame Method_, obtainable from the Mailing Room, West\r\nVirginia Agricultural Experiment Station, Morgantown, West Virginia,\r\ngives construction details of a suitable bottom-heated cold frame.\r\nHowever, with chestnuts, natural shade was not used and half of the\r\nsunlight was excluded. An article in the October issue of _The National\r\nHorticultural Magazine_--\"Rooting Chestnuts from Cuttings\"--outlines\r\nprocedure and results through 1952.\r\n\r\nIn this paper I will present a resume of our experiences and\r\nobservations. Our facilities were limited so that the number of cuttings\r\nset in each case was very small. Percentages of failure or success\r\nshould be taken as indicative only.\r\n\r\nIn the propagation experiments, preliminary observations were made by\r\nplacing softwood cuttings in a bottom-heated cold frame at intervals\r\nduring the growing season. The soil medium was two thirds washed sand\r\nand one third peat moss. Daily watering was by a hand hose. The\r\nroot-inducing substance was indole-butyric acid crystals in a talc based\r\nmixture, one to one hundred. The results were completely negative.\r\n\r\nThe next season a small cold room was constructed in which conditions\r\nthought to be desirable could be maintained. Air temperature was kept at\r\napproximately 65 deg. F., fog nozzles were operated continuously except for\r\nan occasional airing of the cold room, and about 200 foot candles of\r\nwhite fluorescent light were delivered upon the rooting surface. The\r\nrooting medium was white, washed, building sand placed over one half\r\ninch of sphagnum moss. The moss, in turn, had been laid in a rooting\r\nbench with a hardware cloth bottom exposed to the air. The interior air\r\ncirculation was maintained by an electric fan operating day and night.\r\nThe soil temperature was held at 70 deg. F.\r\n\r\nCuttings were taken at intervals throughout the season and their basal\r\nsections soaked in a water-based solution of indole-butyric acid\r\ncrystals at concentrations varying around 60 parts per million. During a\r\n70-day period roots were formed on cuttings taken in June, July, and\r\nAugust. Among the successful cases the poorest result was 66-2/3%, and\r\nthe best was 100%.\r\n\r\nThe young plants were fed nutrient solution and later transplanted to a\r\nlight, sandy soil within a bottom-heated cold frame. Some roots were\r\ndead at the time of transplanting, burned, perhaps, by the nutrient\r\nsolution. The soil temperature within the cold frame was maintained at\r\n70 deg. F. until late in the fall, and then the plants were hardened by\r\nreducing the water content of the soil medium and lowering the\r\ntemperature. All of the plants were dead when they were inspected in\r\nMarch.\r\n\r\nThe next year a bottom-heated cold frame was equipped with fog nozzles.\r\nThe soil medium was white, washed, building sand. Softwood cuttings,\r\ntreated the same as the previous year, were inserted on August 20.\r\nCuttings from juvenile American chestnut seedling trees, juvenile\r\nChinese trees, and mature Chinese trees were used. Within a 70 day\r\nperiod heavy root systems were formed on 54-6/11% of the cuttings from\r\nthe juvenile Chinese trees, 50% from mature Chinese trees, and 20% from\r\njuvenile American trees. No nutrient solution was applied, the young\r\nplants were transplanted to a sandy soil in another cold frame, were\r\nhardened as during the previous year, but the soil medium was not\r\nallowed to freeze during the winter. In April the plants showed\r\nwell-formed terminal buds starting to swell and turn green. Some were\r\ntransplanted into pots and placed in the greenhouse; others were\r\ntransplanted into a light soil in a lath house. All died subsequent to\r\ntransplanting. Inspection of the roots showed severe breakage. It was\r\nconcluded that repeated transplanting had been fatal, and that in the\r\nfuture cuttings would be rooted in plant bands or pots and transplanted\r\nonly once.\r\n\r\nIt is too early in the current season for accurate results to be\r\nrecorded. However, modifications have been tried and observations made.\r\nThese are presented here in outline.\r\n\r\n     _Type of cutting:_\r\n\r\n     a. Cuttings with soft, growing tips will apparently root more\r\n     quickly than hardened shoots, but the leaves tend to turn brown and\r\n     the plant dies. Conversely, cuttings from short, lateral growth,\r\n     well-hardened, will retain their leaves better and eventually show\r\n     a higher percentage of success.\r\n\r\n     b. Cuttings made from the basal and intermediary sections of long\r\n     shoots show a greater death incidence than do well-hardened,\r\n     terminal sections. Both types root satisfactorily.\r\n\r\n     c. Apparently sucker shoots and water sprouts are useless.\r\n\r\n     _Time of taking cuttings:_\r\n\r\n     a. Cuttings taken in late May, with soft growing tips, rooted\r\n     quickly--some within two weeks. On the other hand, their foliage\r\n     darkened quickly, and death followed. Short, lateral shoots,\r\n     well-hardened, were not available in May.\r\n\r\n     b. As the season progressed, the percentage of rooted cuttings with\r\n     healthy foliage apparently rose, at least through July, but roots\r\n     were formed more slowly by the late season cuttings.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Condition of parent tree:_\r\n\r\nApparently tree vigor as indicated by healthy, dark green foliage, is\r\nmore important than vigor as indicated by the length of current season's\r\ngrowth. In Morgantown this has been one of the driest seasons on record.\r\nCuttings from trees with pale or brown foliage, or with foliage tending\r\nto be brittle from lack of water soon lost their leaves. Whether this\r\nwas caused by the condition of the parent tree or of the individual\r\ncutting is not apparent. It is too early to determine whether or not the\r\ndrought will cause a general lowering of rooting percentages this year.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Root formation:_\r\n\r\nCuttings may or may not callus. Roots seldom if ever spring from the\r\nextreme base of a cutting. Well above the base the stem enlarges, turns\r\nwhite, cracks, and sends out roots. Often the bottom inch of the cutting\r\nis black and dead, with a healthy and vigorous root system above the\r\nblackened portion.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Plant bands and pots:_\r\n\r\nPlant bands are apparently preferable to small pots. The slope of the\r\npots tends to pack the soil medium and interfere with aeration. Bands or\r\npots less than three inches in diameter tends to cramp the rapidly\r\ngrowing roots.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cold room vs. cold frame:_\r\n\r\nLast year higher percentages of success were obtained in the cold room\r\nthan in the bottom-heated cold frame. This year the cold frame was\r\ndefinitely superior. Because construction and operation of a suitable\r\ncold room is expensive, we do not plan to continue its use in chestnut\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Fog nozzles:_\r\n\r\nIn the cold frame, fog nozzles operating during eight hours each day are\r\napparently more effective than nozzles operating continuously.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Auxin:_\r\n\r\nNo success has been attained with indole-butyric acid crystals in a\r\ntalc-based powder or with untreated cuttings.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Formula for preparing auxin:_\r\n\r\nThe auxin solution is prepared as recommended by G. H. Poesch in the\r\nOhio Agricultural Experiment Station Bimonthly Bulletin, 191, April,\r\n1938. One gram of indole-butyric acid crystals is dissolved in 125 cc.\r\nof 95% alcohol. Then 125 cc. of distilled water is added. This makes a\r\nstock solution of four thousand parts to a million in strength. The\r\nstock may be cut to the desired strength with distilled water. For late\r\nAugust cuttings, well-hardened, 80 parts per million is not too strong.\r\nFor early June cuttings, forty parts per million appears to be adequate.\r\nThe softer the cuttings, the weaker should be the solution.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Algae:_\r\n\r\nIn both the cold frame and the cold room the growth of algae is a\r\nproblem. The sand medium becomes crusted, with subsequent interference\r\nwith aeration. The algae sometimes creeps up the stems of cuttings,\r\ncoats the leaves, and covers terminal buds. Starting each season with\r\ncompletely clean sand and equipment will not prevent the appearance of\r\nalgae over a long season of continuous operation. On August 20 of this\r\nyear the interior of the cold frame, including all of the plants, was\r\nwell dusted with tri-basic copper sulphate, according to manufacturer's\r\ndirections. To date no effect is noticeable either on the algae or on\r\nthe plants.\r\n\r\nThe various observations reported here should be verified by further\r\ntests. They are offered merely as aids to anyone planning to experiment\r\nwith rooting chestnuts. When sufficient data and experience have been\r\ngained, a complete Station circular will be published.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT BEST: If you have any questions, please save them until later.\r\nIt's been suggested that we hear from Dr. Jesse D. Diller next, and that\r\nwill give our good work horse, Dr. Crane, a chance to build up again for\r\nus, because we are going to work him mighty hard.\r\n\r\nDR. DILLER: I'd like to have the title of my paper changed to,\r\n\"Evaluating Chestnuts Grown Under Forest Conditions.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEvaluating Chestnuts Grown under Forest Conditions\r\n\r\nJESSE D. DILLER, _Pathologist, Division of Forest Pathology, Bureau of\r\nPlant Industry, Soils, and Agricultural Engineering, U. S. Department of\r\nAgriculture, Beltsville, Maryland_\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the 49-year period since chestnut blight was first reported from\r\nNew York City, the U. S. Department of Agriculture has made more than\r\n500 importations of chestnut seeds and scions, including nearly every\r\nspecies of chestnut in the world, as well as some closely related\r\nchinkapins and Castanopsis species. As early as 1909 the Department\r\ninitiated chestnut breeding work. It was known that few, if any, of the\r\nchestnut, or related species, possess the timber-type characteristics of\r\nour American chestnut. It was also known that, in general, the Asiatic\r\nspecies show great natural resistance to the blight. But little, or\r\nnothing, was known about their site requirements.\r\n\r\nIn 1927 the U. S. Division of Forest Pathology began breeding chestnuts\r\nto produce timber-type trees. The chestnut breeding work was expanded\r\nand has been carried on actively to date. From 1927 to 1930, the\r\nDivision conducted an extensive exploration in search of orchard and\r\ntimber-type chestnut in China, Korea, and Japan, and imported over 250\r\nbushels of chestnut seed, representing four species.\r\n\r\nDuring the early 1930's the Division of Forest Pathology distributed\r\nthousands of chestnut seedlings, grown from the imported chestnut seed.\r\nThe planting stock was made available to interested Federal and State\r\nagencies, as well as to owners of farm woodlands, located in 32 Eastern\r\nStates. The cooperators were asked to establish small experimental\r\nforest plantings with the trees furnished them. It was believed that\r\nsuch wide distribution of the many kinds would readily demonstrate which\r\nones possess the desired timber-tree form, or possessed the ability to\r\nbear large crops of nuts suitable to wildlife; and would furnish\r\nvaluable information on their site requirements.\r\n\r\nAs we now know, most of these early cooperative experimental forest\r\nplantings were doomed to failure because often the chestnut trees were\r\nplanted on dry, grassy areas having infertile, shallow soil. Another\r\nserious contributing factor in poor establishment was the severe general\r\ndroughts that occurred over most of the eastern half of the United\r\nStates in the early thirties. But despite these heavy losses, a few\r\nplantations succeeded, in part, and from these limited areas, and from a\r\nfew earlier plantations that succeeded, valuable information on their\r\ngeneral site requirements was obtained; however, we still lacked\r\ninformation on specific differences in behavior between the progeny, as\r\nfast-growing forest trees or nut producers in the forest.\r\n\r\nFrom these early plantings we learned that (1) Asiatic chestnuts and\r\nhybrids are more likely to develop into forest trees when planted on\r\ncool, moist, fertile situations; (2) in their silvicultural\r\ncharacteristics they are more nearly like our native yellow-poplar,\r\nnorthern red oak, and white ash, than like our American chestnut and\r\nnative chinkapins; (3) with respect to tolerance of shade, they are much\r\nlike our northern red oak; and (4) neither the Chinese nor the Japanese\r\nchestnut has quite the same forest-type growth as that of our native\r\nAmerican chestnut.\r\n\r\nWith this background of experience, the U. S. Division of Forest\r\nPathology from 1936 to 1939 established a series of 21 climatic test\r\nplots on above-average sites on Federal- and State-owned forest land in\r\neight Eastern States. Fortunately, we still had available suitable\r\nplanting stock of the many kinds of chestnut, chinkapins, and hybrids\r\nfor conducting such an extensive test. At this point we should also\r\nmention that from 1947 to date, the Division of Forest Pathology, in\r\ncooperation with the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station, also\r\nestablished 11 hybrid test plots in Arkansas, Connecticut, Illinois,\r\nMichigan, Ohio, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, Tennessee, and West\r\nVirginia. In 1930 the Brooklyn Botanic Garden also began breeding\r\nblight-resistant chestnuts of timber type, and in 1947 transferred this\r\nproject to the Connecticut Agricultural Experiment Station.\r\n\r\nThe 21 climatic test plots ranged from one to two acres each, and were\r\nplanted with more than 20 progenies represented, as well as forest-tree\r\nchinkapin and some hybrids. Nearly all of the 21 climatic test plots\r\nwere fenced against deer and domestic livestock. The 11 hybrid test\r\nplots, approximately 1/4 acre each, were planted with 100 hybrids (50\r\nfurnished by each of the two agencies), and 50 Chinese chestnuts--P.I.\r\n58602, the most outstanding Chinese chestnut from the forestry\r\nstandpoint, thus far discovered. The climatic test plots were\r\nestablished on freshly cleared forest sites, with trees randomized, and\r\nplanted 8 feet apart. In the hybrid test plots, the seedlings were\r\nplanted under forest growth and the overstory trees were girdled; the\r\nseedlings were randomized in these plots, with spacing of 10 by 10 feet.\r\n\r\nThe 1- to 6-year period of testing for the hybrid chestnut, and the 14-\r\nto 17-year period of testing of the chestnuts planted in the climatic\r\ntest plots are too short for final judgment of performance; however,\r\ncertain characteristics are appearing with reference to blight\r\nresistance, winter hardiness, timber-tree form, early fruiting, and rate\r\nof growth. The present paper does not attempt to summarize all of the\r\ndata obtained from all these climatic plots but rather to point out some\r\nstriking results obtained from several widely separated climatic plots.\r\nResults from the hybrid test plots are not included in this discussion.\r\n\r\n\r\nDiscussion\r\n\r\nA performance rating of 28 chestnuts, chestnut hybrids, and forest-tree\r\nchinkapins, tested in forest plantings for 12 to 13 years in Indiana,\r\nIowa, North Carolina, and Pennsylvania showed that certain kinds always\r\nproduce better trees than others. P.I. 58602 is the best Chinese\r\nchestnut tested thus far, as determined by performance in the\r\nabove-mentioned test plots and in several plantations established in\r\n1926. In the Middle Western States, all Japanese chestnuts, Henry\r\n(forest-tree) chinkapins, and the \"ever-blooming\" Sequin chestnuts have\r\nshown poor growth or have died. They do not appear to be winter hardy.\r\n\r\nOn the basis of these findings, the Division of Forest Pathology since\r\n1946, has made available to Federal and State agencies only one\r\nintroduction of Chinese chestnut--P.I. 58602--for planting as forest\r\ntrees. They were distributed in lots of 50 trees, and used to establish\r\n1/4-acre demonstration forest plots. All are located on public-owned\r\nland on favorable forest sites where Asiatic chestnuts would be expected\r\nto do well. The underplanting-and-girdling method was recommended in the\r\nestablishment of all the plots.\r\n\r\nChinese chestnut P.I. 58602, because of its superiority in performance\r\nas a forest tree, is now also being used extensively at Beltsville,\r\nMaryland, in hybridizing work. Nearly all of the Japanese chestnut,\r\nHenry chinkapin, and Sequin chestnuts, as well as inferior hybrids in\r\nthe climatic test plots during the past several years have died a\r\nnatural death or have been destroyed. They have been replaced with\r\nChinese chestnut (P.I. 58602) replants--thus gradually converting the\r\nclimatic test plots into future Chinese chestnut \"seed\" plots of the\r\nvery best Chinese chestnuts.\r\n\r\nDuring the spring of 1953 several nurserymen members of the Northern Nut\r\nGrowers' Association furnished the Division of Forest Pathology a total\r\nof 2,600 Chinese chestnut seedlings for tests to determine their\r\nsuitability for forest planting. These and 600 seedlings of Chinese\r\nchestnut P.I. 58602 are now being tested for performance, in randomized\r\nplots, on favorable forest sites in North Carolina, Ohio, and Illinois.\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\n\r\nOf 28 Asiatic chestnuts, forest-tree chinkapins, and hybrids grown in 21\r\nclimatic test plots in the eastern United States under forest\r\nconditions, only certain Chinese and hybrid chestnuts show promise of\r\nbecoming satisfactory timber-type trees. The best Chinese chestnut\r\ndiscovered thus far is P.I. 58602--a seed importation made by the U. S.\r\nDepartment of Agriculture in 1924, from Nanking, China. Foresters, as\r\nwell as farm woodland owners, interested in growing Asiatic chestnuts as\r\ntimber trees, should accept only planting stock that, through\r\nperformance under forest conditions, is known to develop into straight,\r\nsingle-stemmed trees.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT BEST: I think that Dr. Crane has his panel ready.\r\n\r\nDR. CRANE: Mr. President, before I start, I have a few slides here to\r\nillustrate a couple of points before we call the panel to the rostrum.\r\n(Several slides were shown illustrating sunscald injury to the Southwest\r\nside of high headed Chinese chestnut tree trunks.)\r\n\r\nDR. CRANE: On this panel, I want to get representatives from the various\r\nstates. Mr. Wilson, from Georgia. Mr. Stoke from Virginia. Mr. Silvis\r\nfrom Ohio. Mr. Allaman from Pennsylvania. There is another good man down\r\nthere who grows a lot of chestnuts, by the name of Gibbs.\r\n\r\nNow, there seems to be a lot of disagreement in regard to the Chinese\r\nchestnut in two or three respects. One is the problem of named varieties\r\nversus seedlings. Another big problem is hardiness, how hardy they are,\r\nthese Chinese chestnuts. Where can we grow them and where are they going\r\nto fail? A third question is the ability of the Chinese chestnut to\r\ncompete with other vegetation as Dr. Diller has discussed. I think we\r\nought to settle some of these questions for once and maybe for all, or\r\nat least for this meeting, through a discussion. Nurserymen and others\r\nhave emphasized that chestnuts, to be successful in the United States\r\nand hardy, should come from North China, at the Great Wall or beyond.\r\nOthers don't agree, claiming that chestnuts in China are grown from the\r\nextreme south to the extreme north and that we ought to do the same in\r\nthis country also.\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: I haven't enough knowledge on it to express an opinion. I\r\nplanted a good many seeds I got from the Yokahama Nursery Company, and\r\nthe nuts were rather inferior as to size. They were healthy and hardy,\r\nbut I don't know where they came from. I presume they came from Korea,\r\nbut I am not sure. The size and productivity wasn't too high of that\r\nseedling stock I secured there.\r\n\r\nDR. CRANE: What do you folks think? Anyone in the audience that has an\r\nidea?\r\n\r\nMR. PATAKY: At our fall meeting in the Ohio group we had two bushels of\r\nchestnuts from Sterling Smith. As far as I know the seed is Korean\r\nchestnut, which is obviously a Chinese variety. He had three bushels\r\nlast fall and they looked identically like the American chestnut. Mr.\r\nStoke said the quality wasn't so good in what he had. That might be\r\ntrue, but I tested a lot of these chestnuts from Sterling Smith, and\r\ncompared them with American chestnuts. They were just as good or better\r\nthan the American.\r\n\r\nMR. CALDWELL: I spent about a year in China travelling pretty well\r\nthroughout the country. I believe you will find the better seed sources\r\nin the southern part. China is like Southern Florida or warmer for part\r\nof the year and yet in the other six months it would be colder than it\r\nis right here in Rochester.\r\n\r\nThey have timber trees, some as big as 50 or 60 feet high and two or\r\nthree feet in diameter. In the warmer area you find better seed by far.\r\nWhat Dr. Diller describes as No. 58602 is not just one tree, but a whole\r\ncollection of trees from a certain area where the trees have proven\r\ntheir resistance not only to cold but to frost injury in the spring or\r\nin the fall, which is even more important than the straight cold\r\nhardiness. Some people have mistaken ideas about the value of seed from\r\ntrees in the northern part of China above the Great Wall. This area may\r\nhave intense cold in the wintertime, but not in the spring or fall.\r\n\r\nDR. GRAVES: Dr. Caldwell is right about No. 58602 being a mixture. Dr.\r\nGravatt could tell you about that. It is a strain coming from several\r\ntrees. It's evidently a very fine type, and I think we ought to know for\r\nthe record just what 58602 is.\r\n\r\nDR. GRAVATT: Professor Reisner's 58602 that Dr. Diller has been testing\r\nso widely is made up from a collection of seed from a number of isolated\r\nvalleys of the Nanking area. It is rather southern in its native home,\r\nbut Dr. Diller's tests and other tests have shown that it's hardy up\r\nnorth and it's hardy down south. As some of you have noticed, the nuts\r\nare very variable, with a number of different types mixed in together.\r\n\r\nDr. Diller and I have been discussing the question of hybrid vigor. It\r\nmay be involved that each of these seedlings is a cross between\r\ndifferent local strains. We must remember that the foresters have gone\r\ninto this question of hardiness in great detail. You will find that you\r\ncan't plant trees in Germany in a certain area unless the parent trees\r\ngrew in a certain area, with comparable altitude and latitude. Minimum\r\nand maximum temperatures and other factors are also taken into\r\nconsideration.\r\n\r\nPennsylvania started a program along the same line. They have divided\r\ntheir state into about five areas, and in each of those areas they are\r\nlocating sources of seed that are going to be suited to those areas.\r\nThey have evidence that many of these Chinese introductions coming from\r\nway down south are going to be hardy way up north, but in this matter of\r\nhardiness you sometimes have to wait for 50 or 100 years before you are\r\nsure of your conclusions.\r\n\r\nDR. CRANE: That's right.\r\n\r\nThe next question I was going to ask these growers in the areas growing\r\nchestnuts is how much trouble they have had with hardiness or cold\r\ninjury to chestnut trees that they have had. Has there been any?\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: I have had none.\r\n\r\nMR. SILVIS: We have had none in Massillon.\r\n\r\nDR. CRANE: Wilson, how about Georgia?\r\n\r\nMR. WILSON: None.\r\n\r\nMR. KEPLINGER: Dr. Meader sent me some stock from seed that he brought\r\nfrom near Seoul, Korea in 1947. They are very productive up there at\r\nDurham, New Hampshire. I have two trees from seed from these trees. They\r\nhave much more narrow leaves, than any Chinese chestnuts I have seen so\r\nfar.\r\n\r\nDR. CRANE: Are you sure they are pure Chinese?\r\n\r\nDR. MACDANIEL: I am sure they are not. I have seen pictures and had some\r\ncorrespondence with Dr. Meader on them. They seem to be the Japanese\r\nspecies, C. crenata type, or possibly hybrid, not strictly Japanese.\r\n\r\nMR. PEASE: I want to throw in something a little bit aside. I think we\r\nkid ourselves and the public in assuming, tacitly, that Chinese\r\nchestnuts, no matter how narrow the strain, are going to breed true or\r\nanywhere near true. Any one lot of seedlings are likely to show great\r\nvariation in hardiness, disease resistance and other characters. There\r\nis a great difference between resistance and immunity. I speak this way\r\nbecause I have seen plenty of people selling Chinese chestnuts who\r\nactually believe they are immune, and I have seen customers mad enough\r\nto shoot them when they have seen half of them die of blight.\r\n\r\nMR. MILLER: When considering hardiness, climate is one thing and air\r\ndrainage is another. In any climatic zone the exact location or site,\r\nparticularly air drainage is important. I have my orchard on a southwest\r\nslope with perfect air drainage. I have 250-some trees that are six or\r\nseven years old growing very nicely, and I have not had any loss, even\r\nwith English walnut, the Carpathian or any of the other trees. I think\r\nthat many of us are overlooking the fact that air drainage and location\r\nof the orchard is one of the main things. I don't think this has\r\nanything to do with the particular seed or the varieties, but I think\r\nthat is one thing that we must consider.\r\n\r\nDR. CRANE: No question about that. Chinese chestnuts are like peaches,\r\nand they start pretty early in the spring.\r\n\r\nMR. GIBBS: Chinese chestnuts are hardy from Maine to Florida. I think\r\nthey winter kill because of unhealthy condition of the tree. The place\r\nthat I did live, at McLean, Virginia, was low in a frosty place, and the\r\nfirst spring they killed back three times before they took off. Where I\r\nlive now in the Blue Ridge Mountains, which is orchard country, the\r\nChinese chestnut killed back in the spring, but there is nothing the\r\nmatter with their winter hardiness. They stand winter cold as good as a\r\nwalnut tree.\r\n\r\nDR. GRAVES: I want to make the point that it is in part a question of\r\nage, to my mind, as to whether these trees get winter killed. I know we\r\nhad some trees from the Department of Agriculture, Division of Forest\r\nPathology, back in 1925, and in the very cold winter, 1933-34, they\r\nkilled back almost to the ground. Again in the severe winter of 1943\r\nChinese chestnuts were killed. But I feel that when a tree is of good\r\nsize with its roots down in the ground, it's not so liable to winter\r\nkill as are the small seedlings.\r\n\r\nDR. CRANE: We have spent enough time on this matter. The question of\r\ngrowing seedlings as compared to grafted trees is up for discussion. Mr.\r\nWilson is a big operator growing chestnuts in Georgia. I would like to\r\nhave him tell what he thinks of this matter of seedlings versus\r\nvarieties for nut production.\r\n\r\nMR. WILSON: Dr. Crane, I am fully convinced if we ever make an industry\r\nout of this chestnut business it's going to have to be based on grafted\r\ntrees of good varieties. I have one block of approximately 200 grafted\r\ntrees of Meiling and Kuling. Those trees have a nice crop on this year.\r\nThey have different age tops, but we have a nice crop of nuts on them.\r\nI have another block of some 260 seedlings that were planted in 1948.\r\nThe crop on these trees, with the same fertilization and cultivation\r\nranges from no nuts to a heavy crop of nuts. You can't have an industry\r\non that kind of yield. There are probably only 30 trees out of 260 that\r\nhave a paying crop of nuts. That won't go as a paying proposition. You\r\nhave got to have nuts on all the trees, and I am fully convinced if we\r\never make an industry out of it, the grower has got to produce nuts.\r\nTrees are not enough, he can't sell the tree; he wants to keep his tree.\r\nHe wants nuts to sell, and you can't get them on the seedling trees. I\r\nam fully convinced you can't do it.\r\n\r\nDR. MACDANIEL: Have any of your grafts gone bad?\r\n\r\nMR. WILSON: I have had no incompatibility, except on one tree. My oldest\r\ngrafts are four and five years old, top grafted in place on two and\r\nthree year old seedlings.\r\n\r\nDR. CRANE: Mr. Stoke, what is your experience?\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: I have two trees in my yard at home. Dr. Reed gave me credit\r\nfor doing the first grafting of Mollissima in this country. I don't know\r\nwhether it's true or not. Those were grafted in '31. They made perfect\r\nunion, and they are perfect today, and they will be perfect when I am\r\ndead and gone. I find no incompatibility between Mollissima and\r\nMollissima. One acre of good, select varieties, grafted, will produce as\r\nmany nuts as three or four acres of seedlings.\r\n\r\nDR. CRANE: Mr. Bernath, how about the situation up in the Hudson Valley?\r\n\r\nMR. BERNATH: My trees are of small size. We have some in bearing, but as\r\nfar as having any difficulty with them or freezing back, we have none.\r\n\r\nDR. CRANE: Mr. Snyder, how about the situation out in Iowa?\r\n\r\nMR. SNYDER: I am not trying to grow Chinese chestnuts anymore. We have\r\nhad two different lots from U.S.D.A. and both of them have gone out in\r\nthe winters sooner or later. We have had nice seedling rows, and Dr.\r\nColby sent over a collection of scions, enough to graft each one. Every\r\none grew. This winter they are all gone. We can grow American chestnuts,\r\nbut we can't grow the Chinese.\r\n\r\nDR. CRANE: Joe, you have had a lot of experience, made a lot of\r\nobservations of this matter of seedlings versus grafted varieties. What\r\ndo you think of the situation?\r\n\r\nDR. MACDANIEL: I will follow Mr. Stokes' opinion on that. I think grafted\r\ntrees, if you have a compatible graft, are worth several times as much\r\nas average seedling trees. At the University of Illinois most of our\r\ntrees are seedling trees. We are just getting started with grafted\r\nChinese chestnuts.\r\n\r\nDR. CRANE: That's the way it is with us. Anybody in the audience that\r\nhas an opinion that they think seedlings are better than grafted trees?\r\n\r\nMR. CALDWELL: I was going to say seedlings are better, but I think this\r\nis one thing everybody should realize: The emphasis has been based on\r\nearly production. In many cases we have found in forest trees that early\r\nseed production doesn't necessarily mean heavy late seed production.\r\nSome of those that didn't produce early went ahead and 40 or 50 years\r\nlater produced heavily. So be a little bit careful when you start\r\nswinging too heavily on early production.\r\n\r\nDR. CRANE: Yes, but, Dr. Caldwell, we in the United States haven't time\r\nto wait. We haven't time to wait.\r\n\r\nMR. CALDWELL: You are going to have to take it.\r\n\r\nDR. CRANE: It's just like Mr. Wilson said. He planted seedlings in 1948,\r\nand he is telling me that most of them haven't come into bearing, so he\r\nis going to ply the axe or top work them. He hasn't time to wait. He's\r\ngot to make his bread and butter out of that, and when it comes to\r\ngrowing nuts, we can't wait 40 or 50 years for a tree to come in. That\r\nmight be all right for posterity, but we have got to be sure of it, or\r\nour posterity is not going to be able to pay the national debt.\r\n\r\nDR. MACDANIELS: According to the experience I have had, the chestnut is\r\nonly a little more hardy than the peach, and behaves pretty much the\r\nsame as regards wood injury. At 30 deg. below zero the trees have been\r\nkilled outright or to the ground. At about 25 deg. below they will black\r\nheart with killing of sapwood and serious injury to the bark. At 20 they\r\nwill survive. This experience involves perhaps 125 seedling trees from\r\nvarious sources, but mostly from the U.S.D.A. It is quite likely that\r\nthere may be more hardier strains that will withstand these low\r\ntemperatures. The other point is the matter of grafted trees. It is my\r\nopinion that the failure of the graft is a form of cold injury related\r\nto delayed maturity of the tissues at the graft union. Certainly failure\r\nof grafts is much more persistent in the north than in the south.\r\n\r\nMy experience has been that I haven't been able to keep grafted trees.\r\nThey appear to thrive for three or four years and then die. I have tried\r\nit over and over again. It appears that the grafted tree in Georgia and\r\nVirginia is one thing. In New York it's another.\r\n\r\nMR. WALLICK: I have never bought a grafted chestnut tree that grew. They\r\nall die. And seedlings mostly do not have the kind of nuts you want.\r\nAlso they may be susceptible to disease.\r\n\r\nDR. MCKAY: I want to make one observation about our experience at\r\nBeltsville on the question of seedlings versus varieties as regards\r\nbearing. We topworked scions of some of our good varieties, like Nanking\r\nand Meiling, onto large seedlings we have at Beltsville that are poor\r\nbearers. These grafted portions in the top of these trees under poor\r\nconditions--our soil is poor at Beltsville--set tremendously heavy\r\ncrops, but the nuts are smaller in size than normal, and therefore the\r\ncrop is not as desirable as it would be if it were grown under good\r\nconditions. The point is that those varieties bear even under poor\r\nconditions. Bearing is a variety characteristic, and wherever it grows\r\nit will bear though it may not produce a good-sized nut.\r\n\r\nMR. PEASE: I believe what's coming out in this discussion on bearing is\r\nalso true in hardiness, growth, and any characteristic we want. We may\r\nselect seeds from trees at an elevation of 6,000 feet, and still have\r\nsome which will be not hardy.\r\n\r\nDR. CRANE: That's right.\r\n\r\nMR. SILVIS: I'd like to make a point. If in your observation you find a\r\ntree seedling in your locality that is producing good crops plant that.\r\nDon't get one from Georgia. We can take a little bit of advice from the\r\nfruit grower, and not plant too much from the south, even though it came\r\nfrom China.\r\n\r\nDR. GRAVATT: I'd like to Comment about conditions in Europe with\r\nreference to seedlings and varieties. The general practice there is for\r\neach little farmer to graft from the best variety in his section,\r\nespecially in Italy where you find hundreds of varieties.\r\n\r\nIn Portugal we were all very much impressed with one area where the\r\ngovernment has had an active program in persuading the chestnut owners\r\nto topwork all their trees to three varieties. These varieties are very\r\ngood ones, and they are getting a very greatly increased price on\r\naccount of the high quality and uniformity of the nuts they export.\r\n\r\nIt seems to me that in the discussion on the Chinese chestnut in this\r\ncountry we have done a little bit of injustice to the seedlings, so far\r\nas the discussion has gone. I am in perfect agreement with what's been\r\nsaid about the low production the first few years, but over on the\r\nEastern Shore Mr. Hemming's trees are producing just about as much in\r\nthe way of a crop as the tree can bear, and the grafted varieties there\r\ndon't produce any more than his 17 or 18 seedlings.\r\n\r\nDR. MACDANIEL: I believe Hemming has some exceptional seedlings in that\r\nlot.\r\n\r\nDR. GRAVATT: Yes, they are very valuable, don't misunderstand me. After\r\nthe first ten years you may find a seedling orchard is going to produce\r\na very good crop, tree by tree. We have had a lot of experience, similar\r\nto that reported in New York, with grafted trees dying. We get seedling\r\ntrees dying, too, but I agree that there is more damage from fall\r\nfreezes, spring freezes and perhaps from straight low temperature winter\r\ninjury with the grafted trees than with the seedling trees. Furthermore,\r\nI am very critical of the tactics of some of the nurseries. They have\r\ngrafted on seedlings of absolutely unknown origin or mixed origin. They\r\nwill take a South Chinese variety and graft it on seedlings that for\r\nhundreds of years have been grown in North China. That's just inviting\r\ntrouble. The nearer you can get to having seedling and scion from the\r\nsame climatic origin, the better off you are. In fact, we have advised\r\ngrowers to get seedlings of the Nanking and graft Nanking on them.\r\n\r\nDr. McKay is doing a lot of good, basic research work on this problem,\r\nand he will have more information for us in times to come. I am firmly\r\nconvinced that we are going to come some day to the grafted chestnuts,\r\nespecially in the South, because a lot of the southern producers right\r\nnow are giving a black eye to Chinese chestnuts, because they are\r\nshipping lots of mixed nuts, and by the time they get to the consumer\r\nhalf of them are rotten. This will ruin the market. We have been buying\r\nsome six or seven thousand pounds of nuts to ship to Italy, and we know\r\nsomething about the conditions of nuts when they reach us. There is no\r\nquicker way of killing a market than to be shipping in a whole lot of\r\nnuts that are going to spoil or are in the process of spoiling when they\r\nreach the consumer. Grafted varieties are one way of getting away from\r\nthis, especially in the South.\r\n\r\nMR. WILSON: I am far enough south so that in peach production we often\r\nhave winters so warm that the trees don't wake up. This question of rest\r\nperiod is quite important with us. We have a warm winter, and the\r\nMayflower peach just keeps on sleeping. Eventually bloom will break, and\r\na little peach will sit up there waiting for the leaf to come out. There\r\nis apparently a rest period with the Chinese chestnut there also. The\r\ntime of breaking of the rest period in my seedling trees varies as much\r\nas three to four weeks, and that would lead me to believe that, in the\r\nlong run, we will have to plant locally adapted varieties.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT BEST: I am sorry that we have to stop this very interesting\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nAt this time is there any item of general interest to the group that\r\nanyone would like to bring up?\r\n\r\nMR. MILLER: For sometime I have been considering the desirability of\r\nchanging the name of the Northern Nut Growers. I am inclined to think\r\nthat maybe some of our southern friends or from the Far West or\r\nSouthwest would be a little dubious of joining the Northern Nut Growers,\r\nbecause they think we are perhaps exclusive for the north tier of states\r\nand we didn't want them.\r\n\r\nI thought perhaps the International Nut Growers, or the United States\r\nNut Growers Association were names worth considering. I think that would\r\nhave a desirable psychological effect on our membership. We are a big\r\norganization, and I think a lot of people would think it was a whole lot\r\nlarger if the name would imply that. I think the \"Northern Nut Growers\"\r\njust looks like we are concerned with the northern tier of states, and I\r\nthink we would do a whole lot better by changing the name. I would like\r\nto have some suggestions. Possibly, it could be American Nut Growers.\r\n\r\nMR. KERR: Mr. Chairman, I am a charter member of the American Farm\r\nBureau, and that goes over big. It's a real success as an organization,\r\nand I think the American Nut Growers--take in South America and North\r\nAmerica--would hit our proposition about right.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT BEST: All right, is there another suggestion? We mustn't take\r\nso much time on this, but it is mighty important.\r\n\r\nMR. BECKER: My final opinion is that it's best to leave it as it was.\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: It seems to me that this matter was well decided some time\r\nago. We have certain definite problems to work out. I think we had\r\nbetter stay on those problems and work them out before we spread over\r\nthe whole universe. We will have too many other problems coming in our\r\nlap.\r\n\r\nMR. DAVIDSON: That matter was taken up some five or six years ago, and\r\nfor the reason that Mr. Stoke mentioned, the fact that we have special\r\nproblems and the very difficult problems that don't concern southerners\r\nwas the reason for voting that proposition down before. I think it would\r\nbe better, at least, for us to consider the matter rather thoroughly\r\nbefore we vote on it, maybe postpone it until another year.\r\n\r\nDR. MACDANIELS: It just occurs to me that the Northern Nut Growers\r\nAssociation was formed to tackle problems that weren't being covered\r\nanywhere else. There are other local organizations which are concerned\r\nwith the Persian walnut and the Northwest Filbert and the Southern\r\nPecan. The Northern Nut Growers Association was organized to save\r\nAmerica's nut heritage, as somebody said, in a rather restricted area.\r\nPossibly the time has come to get into a larger organization with a\r\ngreater scope, but I will say with Mr. Davidson that we want to\r\nconsider very carefully what the gain or loss might be for the change in\r\nemphasis.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT BEST: Would someone make the suggestion here that we keep this\r\nthing in mind for a year and maybe at our next meeting take a little\r\ntime to discuss it thoroughly.\r\n\r\nDR. CRANE: I'd like to make a few remarks and offer a motion. I believe\r\nI am correct as to the history of the organization when I state that the\r\noldest nut growers' organization was the old National Nut Growers\r\nAssociation, and that covered the nut interests of the country of all\r\nkinds. Then out of that came the National Pecan Growers Association, and\r\nalmost at the same time, the Northern Nut Growers Association. The old\r\nNational Nut Growers Association folded up, as did the National Pecan\r\nGrowers Association. They were victims of the depression. I think we\r\ncould discuss this at great length and not get anywhere, and therefore I\r\nmake the motion that the president appoint a committee of three members\r\nto study the possibilities, both advantages and disadvantages of a\r\nchange in the name of the association and report back to the association\r\ntheir recommendations at the next meeting.\r\n\r\n(Motion seconded.)\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT BEST: The motion has been made and seconded that we appoint a\r\ncommittee to handle this thing and report back to us. Is there any\r\ndiscussion?\r\n\r\nDR. GRAVATT: I'd like to point out that research work is being started\r\nin Europe that is going to be very valuable to us. They are now working\r\non the Chinese chestnuts on a very large scale, starting in Yugoslavia,\r\nFrance, Switzerland, and they are already doing quite a bit of breeding\r\nwork in Spain and Portugal along these lines. The things that they\r\ndevelop, will be Chinese chestnut hybrids so they are going to have the\r\nsame problems in Europe working with the chestnuts that we have here. In\r\nthe past they have been working entirely with the European chestnut. I\r\nthink we are now on a basis whereby the European growers can feel that\r\nthey can profit by taking our publication, and, that both continents\r\nwill benefit.\r\n\r\nDR. GRAVES: Do you put that as an argument for changing our name to\r\nAmerican Nut Growers?\r\n\r\nDR. GRAVATT: I don't think \"American\" would help at all. And,\r\nfurthermore, when you talk about \"American\", a lot of people think of\r\nSouth America.\r\n\r\nMR. SLATE: It's what the members get out of the proceedings and meetings\r\nthat brings them in and keeps them, it's not the name of the\r\norganization.\r\n\r\nDR. MACDANIEL: Mr. President, as former state vice-president in Alabama,\r\nFlorida and Tennessee, I don't believe the change of name would result\r\nin any great immediate increase in membership in the Southeast.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT BEST: Now, are you ready for the question?\r\n\r\n(The question was called for, and carried unanimously.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nDevelopment of the Nut Industry in the Midwest\r\n\r\nJ. F. WILKINSON, _Rockport, Ind._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe development of the northern nut tree industry in the midwest really\r\nbegan about 1910. Prior to that time W. C. Reed and son of Vincennes,\r\nIndiana had done some experimental work with the Indiana and Busseron\r\nvarieties of pecan, as they had located these two parent trees. E. A.\r\nRiehl of Godfrey, Illinois had been experimenting with the walnut and\r\nchestnut, and it was at this time that T. P. Littlepage, R. L. McCoy and\r\nestablished our nurseries here in southern Indiana.\r\n\r\nWe then began the search for the best parent trees for propagation in\r\nthe midwest.\r\n\r\nWe located Warrick, Hoosier, Major, Greenriver, Posey, Kentucky,\r\nButterick and several other varieties most of which have since been\r\ndiscarded.\r\n\r\nA number of varieties have since been introduced, by Messrs. Gerardi,\r\nWhitford, Snyder, Burkhart, Bolten, and others who are either nurserymen\r\nor propagators, of pecan, walnut, hickory and chestnut.\r\n\r\nThe Littlepage and McCoy nurseries were discontinued about thirty years\r\nago though I have continued the search for new and better varieties, and\r\nseveral years ago located, named, and introduced the Giles pecan, in\r\nsoutheast Kansas which is proving very satisfactory. I have recently\r\nlocated, named, and am now introducing a new variety, CHIEF, from\r\nIllinois. This is the largest northern pecan that I have ever seen and\r\nit promises to be an outstanding variety.\r\n\r\nIn the territory from southern Indiana to eastern Kansas are countless\r\nthousands of native pecan trees in the valleys of the Ohio, Mississippi\r\nand Missouri rivers and their tributaries.\r\n\r\nOn the uplands in this same territory, the black walnut is found almost\r\neverywhere. Thousands of pecan and walnut are of suitable size for\r\ntop-working and could be made valuable by being grafted over to these\r\nfine varieties. These may be found in any quantity from a single tree to\r\na native grove (especially pecan) of thousands of trees.\r\n\r\nOne of the largest pecan groves is in Gallatin county, Illinois along\r\nthe Wabash river where it has been estimated there are as many as twenty\r\nthousand pecan trees of bearing size in one locality.\r\n\r\nOther sections where large native groves may be found are in Henderson\r\ncounty, Kentucky near the mouth of Green River, along the Mississippi\r\nriver in western Kentucky, across the river in southern Illinois, along\r\nthe Illinois river in central Illinois, along the Missouri river in\r\ncentral Missouri, in eastern Kansas, along the Neosho and Spring rivers,\r\nand in Bates county Missouri along the Osage river, in southwestern\r\nMissouri.\r\n\r\nIt has been my pleasure to visit one or more times each of the above\r\nplaces as well as every other section of note where the northern pecan\r\ngrows naturally.\r\n\r\nOne of the most interesting places that I have seen is in Bates county,\r\nMissouri. I was there in May to top-work trees for Mr. Wesley Heuser,\r\nwhere he has a tract of land along the Osage river on which there is a\r\nlarge native pecan grove making it a profitable possession. Mr. Heuser\r\nis increasing its value by planting budded, or grafted trees in the open\r\nland and top-working the small native seedlings.\r\n\r\nAdjoining this place is one owned by Mr. Fred Marquardt who recently\r\nbought it from the estate of the late J. F. Tiedke who had spent years\r\nof work there cleaning up the native grove, and top-working the small\r\nseedlings to the better varieties. Mr. Marquardt told me there was an\r\nestimated four thousand bearing size native trees, and two thousand\r\ntop-worked trees most of which are of bearing size and many of them\r\ntop-worked as long as twenty years ago. Mr. Marquardt is taking splendid\r\ncare of this place making it a profitable as well as a most beautiful\r\nnut orchard.\r\n\r\nMr. Tiedke in topworking these small trees, selected those as nearly as\r\npossible in rows giving it the appearance in places of a planted\r\norchard.\r\n\r\nAlong the Illinois river in central Illinois is a great pecan section.\r\nIt is there that Mr. R. B. Best is located, and he probably has more\r\ngrafted and top-worked trees than any other person in the midwest. The\r\nlate Charles Stephens of Columbus, Kansas, had topworked several hundred\r\ntrees in southeastern Kansas and Stanley Walberts planted a 35 acre\r\npecan orchard there at Columbus that at the last time I visited it was a\r\nbeautiful and well kept orchard.\r\n\r\nMr. W. F. Thielenhaus of Buffalo, Kansas is doing a lot of work there\r\nboth in planting and top-working trees.\r\n\r\nIn western Kentucky, Professors W. W. Magill, and W. D. Armstrong of the\r\nUniversity of Kentucky with county agent John B. Watts of Hickman,\r\nKentucky cooperating, interested Mr. Roscoe Stone, who had a large\r\nacreage of land in developing the young seedling pecan trees by\r\ntop-working them to better varieties. Mr. Sly and I went there the first\r\ntime in the spring of 1948 and each spring since then we have worked\r\ntrees on this land, and for others around Hickman to the number of\r\npossibly 500 trees.\r\n\r\nLast year a number of the trees that were worked in the spring of 1948\r\nproduced quite a few nuts. I was there in May at which time there was a\r\nsplendid crop of nuts on these trees. On August 3, I had a letter from\r\nMr. Watts stating \"I feel that many of these trees will bear a good crop\r\nof nuts this year, and although we are having a drought here, the trees\r\non the Stone farm are not suffering much.\r\n\r\nThe largest planting of nut trees that I know in the midwest is that\r\nplanted by the late Harry R. Weber near Rockport which consists of about\r\n70 acres mostly walnuts, with some pecans, hybrids, hickories, and\r\nfilberts.\r\n\r\nMany smaller plantings of nut trees have been made throughout the\r\nmidwest and thousands of seedling trees having been top-worked.\r\n\r\nMost of the native walnut trees through this section have been cut for\r\ntimber and the native chestnut has been killed by the blight, making a\r\nshortage that should be replaced with the better varieties of walnut and\r\nthe Chinese chestnut.\r\n\r\nThe earlier plantings of the Persian walnut from France and England were\r\nnot hardy in the midwest but the Carpathian walnut from Poland seems to\r\nbe doing well.\r\n\r\nSome parts of this territory are suitable for almost any kind of nut\r\ntrees. There is a vast field in the Midwest awaiting development in nut\r\nculture.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSome Aspects of the Problem of Producing Curly-Grained Walnut\r\n\r\nL. H. MACDANIELS, _Cornell University, Ithaca, N. Y._\r\n\r\n\r\nAbout 15 years ago a tree of the Lamb Curly Walnut was planted at\r\nIthaca, N. Y. After the tree had grown to a height of about 12 feet, it\r\nwas topworked about 8 feet from the ground to scions of the Cornell\r\nvariety of Black Walnut with the idea that it would be possible to grow\r\na trunk of curly walnut and a top of a named variety. The tree grew\r\nrapidly and in the fall of 1952 had a trunk 10 inches in diameter at the\r\nbase. Sometime in 1952 the tree became infected with bunchy-top disease\r\nand was cut in an attempt to eliminate this disease from the premises.\r\nIt was expected that the trunk would show figured curly grain and plans\r\nwere made to have at least a part of the log cut into veneer. On cutting\r\nthe tree, however, and examining the wood, there was no evidence of\r\ncurly grain detectable either by casual personal observation or from\r\nsamples sent to the Forest Products Laboratory at Madison, Wisconsin.\r\nThis, of course, was a disappointment because J. F. Wilkinson had shown\r\nsamples of walnut grown from scions of the Lamb Walnut obtained from the\r\nlate W. B. Bixby which showed evidence of curly grain. A photograph of\r\nthe wood secured from Mr. Wilkinson is shown in figure 1. Wood samples\r\nfrom a tree growing at Beltsville, Maryland, which was also secured from\r\nMr. Bixby by C. A. Reed, does not show evidence of curly grain.\r\n\r\nThe simplest explanation of the failure of the tree in Ithaca to show\r\ncurly grain would be that somehow the tree was not properly labelled or\r\nthat scions were mixed in propagation and that the trunk was not derived\r\nfrom the original Lamb Curly Walnut. However, the fact that only a few\r\ntrees were concerned makes it improbable that trees were mislabelled in\r\nthe Ithaca planting and there is no good reason to believe that the tree\r\nplanted at Beltsville was not authentic.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 1. Radial face of wood of grafted Lamb black walnut\r\ngrown by J. F. Wilkinson. Wavy or curly grain is apparent on right side\r\nwhich is the outer part of the log (about natural size).]\r\n\r\nAnother possibility is that the original Lamb Walnut was a chimera. Such\r\na tree would have mixed tissues in its growing points, some having the\r\ncurly grain character and others not. In such a tree some scions would\r\nproduce curliness and others straight grain. It may be that these were\r\nmixed in the original collection.\r\n\r\nA third possibility is that curliness is produced by the interaction of\r\nseveral factors, one a tendency to curliness inherent in the Lamb tree\r\nand the others environmental such as growth rate, nutrient supply, the\r\nnature of the soil or other such conditions.\r\n\r\nTheoretically curly grain in walnut or any other tree is related to the\r\nnature of the growth of the cambium layer. In normal growth the cells of\r\nthis layer are much elongated as seen in tangential section and are\r\nrelatively straight. The nature of these cambium cells is shown in\r\nfigure 2.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2. The cambium of a straight-grained black walnut\r\ntree as seen in tangential section. The nature and regularity of these\r\ncells determines the nature and regularity of the cells of adjacent wood\r\nand bark (x 150).]\r\n\r\nIt is well known from studies of cambial growth that irregularities in\r\nthe growth of the cambium are reflected in the irregularities in the\r\nshape and position of the wood fibers and vessels, which it forms.\r\nOrdinarily, if the cambium is wounded, the first cells formed are\r\nirregular in shape and orientation but after a wound is healed over the\r\ncambium cells resume their normal position. In parts of trees in which\r\nthe grain is irregular or confused such as in the inner angle of\r\ncrotches the shape of the cambium cells determines the nature of the\r\ngrain beneath as shown in figure 3 (Ref. 1). This has been established\r\nalso in the study of the nature of spiral-grained Douglas Fir and in\r\nvarious experimental work where it has been possible to change the\r\ndirection or extent of the cambium cells through various experimental\r\nmeans. (Ref. 2)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 3. Section through cambium and underlying wood in a\r\ncrotch of an apple tree where the grain of the wood is not straight. The\r\nshape and direction of the wood fibers or grain of the wood, and bark is\r\ndetermined by the shape and direction of the cambium cells that form\r\nthem (X 100).]\r\n\r\nThere seems to be no doubt, therefore, that curly grain in walnut is\r\ndirectly related to the curly condition to be found in the cambium,\r\nwhich produces such curly grain. The basic question to be resolved is\r\nwhat makes the cambium of a curly-grain tree assume the curly or wavy\r\ncharacter. As indicated above, one hypothesis is that several factors\r\nmay be operating. For example, a tree might have the inherent capacity\r\nto produce wavy grain but would only do so under special environmental\r\nconditions. These environmental conditions might be related to rapidity\r\nof growth, water and nutrient supply, or various other habitat\r\ncharacteristics, which affect the nature of growth. The fact that the\r\ntree in question at Ithaca was growing rapidly might have been\r\nresponsible for the failure of the curly grain to develop. There is\r\nevidence that trees with figured grain grow slowly. (Ref. 3, 4) On the\r\nother hand the specimens from the tree at Beltsville, Maryland, were\r\nfrom a slowly growing plant and did not show curly grain.\r\n\r\nAnother hypothesis is that development of the curly grain is dependent\r\nupon the foliage of the tree. This has been demonstrated to be true in\r\ninstances where the foliage of fruit plants determines the\r\ncharacteristics of the growth of the trunk and roots and of the fruit\r\nitself. (Ref. 5, 6) It might be, therefore, that the failure of this\r\nparticular trunk to show curly grain is related to the fact that the top\r\nof the tree at Ithaca was of another variety than the original Lamb.\r\nPossibly the foliage of the original variety producing the curly\r\ncharacter is necessary to produce the curly grain. An argument against\r\nthis interpretation is that the tree at Beltsville, Maryland, is not\r\ntopworked.\r\n\r\nIt would be valuable at the present time to survey all the trees of the\r\nLamb walnut, which are growing in various parts of the country, to see\r\nunder what circumstances they may be showing the curly characteristic of\r\nthe original tree. Dr. M. Y. Pillow of the Forest Products Laboratory at\r\nMadison, Wisconsin, in an unpublished report, has pointed out that it is\r\npossible to determine the curly nature of the grain by shaving off the\r\nouter bark, exposing the inner bark just outside of the cambium.\r\nInasmuch as the same cambium cells form fiber cells both on the inside\r\nto make the wood and towards the outside to make the bark, the direction\r\nand nature of the fibers in the bark are a direct indication of the\r\ndirection of the fibers underneath the cambium in the wood.\r\n\r\nThe appearance of the normal straight grained wood and bark and wood and\r\nbark of a curly grained tree are shown in figures 4 and 5. Shaving off\r\nthe outer bark in this manner will not harm the trees, if it is done\r\ncarefully so it would be possible to make this survey without injury to\r\nthe trees. Examining a number of trees of the Lamb walnut in this way\r\nand finding that some were curly, might give evidence as to the\r\nconditions under which the Lamb walnut will produce curly grain.\r\n\r\nDr. Pillow of the Forest Products Laboratory, kindly furnished me with\r\nhis file on curly and birdseye grained wood. In this file is a very\r\ninteresting group of manuscripts and letters including a report from Mr.\r\nWillard G. Bixby reporting a trip to New Hampshire to study the\r\noccurrence of birdseye maple and also his early experiments with the\r\nLamb walnut. The Lamb walnut trees at that time were too young to give\r\nany indication of curly grain. Other letters of interest on the subject\r\nwere from Mr. J. F. Wilkinson, A. S. Colby and C. A. Reed. These letters\r\nmention the desirability of propagating figured walnut but aside from\r\nindicating that trees of the Lamb had been propagated there was no\r\nindication that curliness had developed. The first definite indication\r\nthat curliness would develop in a grafted tree was reported by Mr.\r\nWilkinson (Ref. 7) at the Norris meeting of the Northern Nut Growers\r\nAssociation. At that time the wood photographed in figure 1 was shown.\r\n\r\nIn the literature somewhat conflicting reports are found as to whether\r\nor not curliness will show up early in the growth of a tree or late.\r\nApparently it was possible to trace curly grain into the twigs a few\r\nyears old in the original Lamb walnut (unpublished letters). Various\r\nstatements, however, indicate that curliness may not develop until the\r\ntrees are 20 years old or more. It would seem that with the propagation\r\nand introduction of the Lamb walnut in 1926-27 and distribution soon\r\nthereafter it ought to be possible to locate and examine these trees\r\nwhich are now more than 20 years old.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 4. Slightly enlarged photograph of black walnut with\r\nstraight grain in the wood (light-colored area) and also in the bark\r\n(dark-colored area). U. S. Forest Service Forest Products Laboratory\r\nPhoto.]\r\n\r\nIn the various literature and other material available on the subject of\r\nbirdseye and curliness, it appears that the birdseye grain is different\r\nin its origin from curliness although both may be related to the\r\nfunctioning of the cambium and definitely seem to be related to slow\r\ngrowth. (Ref. 8)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 5. Slightly enlarged photograph of black walnut with\r\ncurly grain in the wood (light-colored area, upper left) and also in the\r\nbark (dark-colored area). U. S. Forest Service Forest Products\r\nLaboratory Photo.]\r\n\r\nCurliness is reported in other kinds of trees. Curly grained white\r\npoplar has been propagated from hybrid trees by growing cuttings of\r\nshoots from the roots of the curly trees (Ref. 9). In Sweden it has been\r\npossible to grow figured birch, much of which has the curly type grain.\r\nIn birch, seedling strains producing curly grain have been developed and\r\nare being grown. It is of interest to note that with these birches, the\r\ntrees with curly grain grow only about half as fast as the normal trees\r\nand have to be staked during their early growth years in order to make\r\nstraight trunks or to stand erect (Ref. 4).\r\n\r\nThe original Lamb walnut tree was curly throughout. Other trees,\r\nparticularly maples and birches may be curly only in part of their\r\ntrunks and sometimes only in restricted segments. Trees frequently have\r\ncurly grain at the base where the trunk joins the roots but not\r\nelsewhere. Such curliness may be related to the shortening of the curve\r\nwhere the root joins the trunk, thus causing distortion. W. G. Bixby\r\nstates (Ref. 3) that a birdseye maple tree 170 years old was only about\r\na quarter as large in diameter as normal trees of the same age. I know\r\nof no comparison of curly walnut with other types of walnut. The\r\noriginal Lamb walnut tree was apparently a very large one.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, it is obvious that our knowledge of the possibility of\r\nproducing curly grained walnut logs by grafting is as yet incomplete.\r\nMuch more information is needed and at the present time undoubtedly much\r\ncan be gained by examining the Lamb walnut trees, which are growing in\r\nvarious parts of the country. This can be done without seriously\r\ninjuring the trees as described earlier in this paper. Those in the\r\nNorthern Nut Grower's Association, who have Lamb trees are urged to\r\nexamine them to find out if we can gain further useful information\r\nregarding this rather important subject. Obviously, if it is possible to\r\ngrow curly walnut through vegetative propagation, we should know under\r\nwhat conditions a grower can expect to successfully produce a curly\r\ngrained log.\r\n\r\n\r\nReferences\r\n\r\n   1.

CRANE: Dr. MacDaniels, the idea prevails on the part of some I know\r\nthat this curliness would show up more at the base or crown of the tree\r\nthan it would be likely to show on the trunk, and at the base of large\r\nlimbs we tend to have curliness. Of course, the Lamb walnut was supposed\r\nto be curly throughout, but in the case of other trees I wonder if\r\nthat's true. You have emphasized the change in the direction of the\r\ngrain at the crown between the root and trunk and in the crotches. I\r\nwonder just where would be the best place to scrape this bark or pare it\r\ndown in examination to determine whether it was curly or not. Would that\r\nbe, in your opinion, more likely to show up on the trunk of the tree or\r\nbase of some limb or near down to the crown?\r\n\r\nDR. MACDANIELS: I'd be inclined to take it where you can work at it most\r\neasily; down towards the base. If the grain is curly only in restricted\r\nareas the log is not very valuable.\r\n\r\nA MEMBER: I have been told by a sawmill man that he could tell by the\r\nconvolutions of the bark. Instead of being straight, they would be\r\nfluted.\r\n\r\nDR. MACDANIELS: That might be. I was told during the First World War\r\nwhen they wanted straight-grained spruce for airplanes they found they\r\ncould tell a straight-grained spruce from a spiral, so they wouldn't\r\nwaste their time getting logs with spiral grain.\r\n\r\n\r\nTUESDAY AFTERNOON SESSION\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT BEST: The first item on the program is the life story of the\r\nLate Reverend Crath and the Crath Carpathian walnut in Ontario. We are\r\ngoing to have Mr. L. K. Devitt of Toronto, Canada, get into this subject\r\nfor us. Mr. Devitt did know Reverend Crath since 1934. Mr. Devitt\r\nsupported his expedition to the Ukraine in 1934. He has a few slides for\r\nus and then he is going to talk to us about a number of features.\r\n\r\nMr. Devitt is in the school system in Toronto, and he is a graduate of\r\nthe University of Toronto, and so without further introduction, take\r\nover and give us your story.\r\n\r\nMR. DEVITT: Thank you. Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, when I wrote\r\na letter to the secretary of the Association about Reverend Crath, I\r\nthought it was also fitting that at the next meeting I should come here\r\nand say a little more about the life and work of the Reverend Crath and\r\nthe Crath Carpathian walnut in Ontario and the progress for the last 20\r\nyears.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLate Rev. Paul C. Crath\r\n\r\nL. K. DEVITT, _Toronto, Ontario_\r\n\r\n\r\nRev. Crath was born near Kiev in Greater Ukraine, Poland, in 1883. He\r\nwas the son of an Agricultural College Professor. It is assumed that he\r\nenjoyed the life of the upper class, being a graduate of two\r\nuniversities; and speaking fluently at least six languages of Central\r\nand Western Europe, and having travelled almost everywhere in Europe. He\r\npossessed a wide knowledge of the peoples, the history and the culture\r\nof all the Central European Countries.\r\n\r\nHe migrated to Canada in 1908 and settled in Western Canada. He was\r\nemployed at various, clerical occupations before entering the\r\nTheological College of the University of Manitoba from where he\r\ngraduated as a Presbyterian minister in 1922.\r\n\r\nHe was the minister of a Ukranian Presbyterian Church in Toronto for two\r\nyears. From 1924 to 1936 he served as a Presbyterian missionary in\r\nPoland, organizing some thirty missions in Galicia and Volynia. For some\r\nyears before the war, he spent considerable time on a farm near Welcome,\r\nOntario, building up a European Nursery and in the winters he served\r\nwith the Home Missions mostly in Western Canada. During the last ten\r\nyears of his life he had to curtail his activities more and more, owing\r\nto poor health and a heart condition.\r\n\r\nI met Rev. Crath when he was on furlough in 1934.\r\n\r\nI went to the National Exhibition and among the various exhibits I came\r\nacross a rather unique exhibit of nuts, grown by the late Geo. H.\r\nCorsan, Echo Valley, Islington.\r\n\r\nIn the course of our conversation along came the late Prof. Jas. Neilson\r\nand we continued to talk about nut-growing. Prof. Neilson was\r\ninteresting indeed. I could see he was a sincere man and most\r\nenthusiastic about the subject. He told me there was a Presbyterian\r\nUkranian missionary in town who had brought out some hardy English\r\nwalnuts from the Carpathian Mountains--a variety which he was sure would\r\nsurvive in Ontario and the Northern States and that it had great\r\npossibilities. The missionary was returning to Europe to bring out a\r\nshipment but needed, backing for the expedition. I met Prof. Neilson the\r\nfollowing day. The sum required was $400.00 and he agreed to guarantee\r\nthe sale of $400.00 worth in the U.S. at least. The next day I met Rev.\r\nCrath at the Exhibition display. We met off and on for two or three\r\ndays. I could see no flaw in the project, so I raised the $400.00 by a\r\nbank-note. The banker thought I was crazy--and the missionary was on his\r\nway by the end of the week.\r\n\r\nHe arrived by mid-September and having had so many charges in the\r\nUkraine, he knew where to go and just when the crop was being harvested.\r\nThe walnuts were selected, dried, boxed and shipped by the middle of\r\nOctober. The shipment arrived in Toronto the first week of\r\nNovember--nearly two tons of them. I received with them, a bill of\r\nlading with port charges, export duties and freight. I was out another\r\n$100.00.\r\n\r\nIn two weeks, the Winter Fair opened and Mr. Corsan was invited to put\r\non his nut exhibit as an attraction. In the meantime he was on the\r\nradio once a week to talk on health, food and various subjects, always\r\ngetting around to nuts as a food--and this new discovery, the Carpathian\r\nwalnut. The radio broadcasts brought interested people right to his\r\nexhibit. He gave an hourly talk on nuts and a pamphlet was given out.\r\nThe Winter Fair sales grossed $300.00 and there was another $100.00 on\r\nfollow-up sales by Christmas. The situation was at least easier.\r\n\r\nProf. Neilson before Christmas had taken ill and passed away in\r\nFebruary. However into the picture came another man, H. J. Rahmlow,\r\nsecretary of the Wisconsin Horticultural Association with about 600\r\naffiliated societies. He wrote an article in the Country Gentleman and\r\ncircularized the expedition of Rev. Crath to the Carpathian Mountains.\r\nWe sent four shipments to Mr. Rahmlow in 25 and 50 lb. lots. Sales came\r\nin from all over Canada and the United States until spring. By spring we\r\nhad cleared all expenses and had about $200.00 on hand, but the next\r\nproblem was, what to do with the rest of the walnut seeds?\r\n\r\nOn Mr. Corsan's Echo Valley, there were two fields, one in the valley\r\nand one over the road. We broke up out of sod an acre in each field and\r\nplanted about 40,000 seeds. Rev. Crath took to a farm near Welcome, Ont.\r\nabout another 20,000. Our plantation required a good deal of attention,\r\nwork and expense during the growing season. However 90% of the walnuts\r\ngerminated and grew to trees about 6 inches high. Over 30,000 trees\r\nsurvived the next cold winter.\r\n\r\nThe following year we could scuffle them between the rows. Our nursery\r\nrequired less care and expense. During the summer they grew about a foot\r\nhigher (15 in. average) but developed a very thick carrot-like tap root\r\nwith numerous root hairs. By autumn 1936 it was evident we had to\r\ntransplant. The seeds were planted originally 8 inches apart. So we\r\ndivided up the lot by each taking one out of every three trees, thus\r\nleaving the trees in Echo Valley now 2 ft. apart. Rev. Crath took his\r\ntrees to the farm at Welcome, 80 miles east of Toronto. They were\r\nplanted on a slope below a thick woods from where melting snow and\r\nspring rains kept the field cold and wet until mid-summer. Rev. Crath's\r\ntrees were practically a failure; in fact the area seemed to be\r\nunsuitable for walnut seedlings. Mr. Corsan's trees continued to grow,\r\nbut even here the soil did not seem to be the most suitable.\r\n\r\nI took mine to a sandy garden soil that had been under sod for 20 years.\r\nThe sod was broken and thoroughly disced. The spring was wet and very\r\nfavourable for transplanting. The trees on this soil grew very well\r\nwithout any fertilizer at all; nor did they require any spraying. The\r\ntrees continued to grow deep and do better each succeeding year.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1939 I started to sell trees wholesale to the Dominion\r\nNursery, Georgetown, Ont. Mr. Bradley, the president, carried more\r\nnovelty items in his catalogue than any other nurseryman in Canada. I\r\ncontinued to plant more seeds until 1939.--The war stopped further\r\nimportations, and I sold out all the trees by the spring of 1943.\r\n\r\nSo from my nursery probably went out some 10,000 trees; the weaker\r\nseedling always perished during the winter. From Mr. Corsan's nursery,\r\nanother 10,000 trees--about half of these went to his son, Hebden Corsan\r\nin Michigan. Rev. Crath's nursery yielded not more than 5000. He\r\nimported a number of cherries, plums, grapes and others fruits, all of\r\nwhich did not do too well either.\r\n\r\nDuring the period before the war, orders came in from everywhere--from\r\nBritish Columbia to Nova Scotia, even Newfoundland, besides nurseries in\r\nthe United States. Orders from the prairie provinces were dissuaded but\r\nsome customers insisted on a trial basis. Walnut seed, the first two\r\nyears went mostly to Western Ontario, British Columbia and Nova Scotia.\r\nBy 1939 the seedling nursery business that I had apparently fallen into,\r\nlooked good. Rev. Crath and I talked the situation over. We decided to\r\ngo to the country, lease some land. I would select\r\nthe land and continue to grow seedlings and besides, import selected\r\ngrafts to develop in Canada a hardy high quality grafted walnut tree.\r\n\r\nIn September we prepared to make another expedition. My banker was most\r\nagreeable this time. Rev. Crath got as far as New York where, awaiting\r\nthe S. S. Batory to sail, the war broke out. The S. S. Pilsudski was\r\nsunk just out of Gdynia the next day. The S. S. Batory never did sail\r\nback to Poland. When he arrived home we went to the bank on a Saturday\r\nmorning. The travellers' cheques were cancelled.\r\n\r\nRev. Crath in the 1936 expedition brought out a shipment of walnuts\r\nselected from the most northerly port of the Ukraine for Mr. Weschcke,\r\nSt. Paul, Minn. I am not familiar with this part of his work.\r\n\r\nRev. Crath was a cheerful soul, an interesting and pleasant individual\r\nto talk to. He loved people and, especially, meeting people. He\r\npossessed a great love for humanity; he bore malice toward no one and\r\ncharity to all except the Bolsheviks. He was a restless man--\"always on\r\nthe go\". One could see he preferred to be missionary rather than a\r\nresident minister. Although he was away a good part of the time he was\r\ndearly loved by his family.\r\n\r\nShortly after his death, as an appreciation of his services as a\r\nminister among Ukranian families, special memorial services were held in\r\nToronto, Oshawa and Detroit. I was invited to attend the Toronto\r\nservice.\r\n\r\nOn a visit one day last August, 1952, to places where his Carpathian\r\nwalnut trees were coming into bearing, he examined them and gazed at\r\nthem with a look of joy and sadness. On the way home he was somewhat\r\nupset, he looked at me and said \"Mr. Devitt, my good friend, at last our\r\nexperiment is a success. Promise me two things; continue our work and go\r\nto the convention and tell our American friends to continue the work.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis is the story of the introduction of hardy Carpathian walnuts\r\n(_Juglans regia_) into Canada and the United States by the late Rev.\r\nCrath.\r\n\r\nLooking back on the whole adventure (now twenty years ago) it would be\r\nonly fair that I mention the names of three other men for the work they\r\ndid to make the expedition a success. The late Professor James Neilson\r\nwhose research in nut growing in Ontario and the United States was\r\nalready well known should be mentioned. It was he who really \"sparked\"\r\nthe expedition. To the late George H. Corsan whose nut growing\r\nexperiment at Echo Valley was something unique in Ontario, credit is due\r\nfor his enthusiasm and support of the late Reverend Crath. The American\r\nnut growers who were fortunate to obtain walnut seeds at the time\r\nthrough Wisconsin Horticultural Society can thank Mr. H. J. Rhamlow,\r\nthen secretary. He took over the task of distributing the walnut seeds\r\nthrough the affiliated societies. He insisted that the seeds be tested\r\nfor germination, kept in proper storage, and did everything possible to\r\nensure success. However none of these men as I knew them then, and\r\nincluding myself, would want any credit, but we give full recognition to\r\nReverend Crath for his work.\r\n\r\nDuring the years spent in Poland Reverend Crath must have given the idea\r\nof growing hardy walnuts in Ontario and the Northern States considerable\r\nthought. He examined trees and nuts wherever he went; and continued\r\ngathering information each year. When I first met him I could see he had\r\ngiven walnut growing a great deal of study. He had great faith in his\r\nidea, and when leaving on his expedition 1934 he felt he was on a great\r\nmission. It should be remembered he made this arduous trip without pay\r\nand that he made very little money from the sale of walnut seeds or\r\ntrees. No one did for that matter. It is also significant that in\r\nbringing these Carpathian walnuts out of Poland at that time, 1934, he\r\ndid something that could never be done again. The trees he saw then\r\nprobably went into rifle butts for use in World War II. The introduction\r\nof these walnuts into Ontario, met with varied success. Many bought them\r\non a trial basis and were eventually rewarded; some looked on with\r\nskepticism and ridicule and a few thought that the growing of walnuts in\r\nOntario was impossible. The intervening years, however, have brought\r\nforth a different picture. These seedling walnut trees are now bearing\r\nin Ontario and as late Reverend Crath predicted more than half of them\r\nare producing fair to good quality nuts. This is also true in the United\r\nStates. In Ontario they grow well in the commercial apple districts and\r\nwith variations mature nuts fully in 90 to 120 days (between Sept. 15 to\r\nOctober 15.) All of the best varieties should now be propagated by\r\ngrafting to produce hundreds of hardy Crath Carpathian walnut trees.\r\nThis project should always be one of the foremost with the members of\r\nthe Northern Nut Growers Association. Twenty years from now and later,\r\nthe number of hardy walnut trees producing nuts (Crath strain) should\r\nmake a living monument to this obscure missionary--Rev. Paul C. Crath.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT BEST: Thank you very much, Mr. Devitt, for this very\r\nintriguing story. Truth is sometimes stranger than fiction. And we want\r\nto keep in touch with you, and we want to keep hearing from you, because\r\nyou have got a big job to do yet.\r\n\r\nMR. DEVITT: There is only one thing, ladies and gentlemen: I don't want\r\nto run into 5,000 letters to answer. Keep my name out of this. That is\r\nmy walking-out request now. That's the story. I am going to continue to\r\nkeep collecting samples. I hope some day to have a number myself of the\r\nbest, and I might come back again sometime. I can't say every year;\r\ncircumstances may be that I can't come. However, it's been a great\r\npleasure for me to be here. I have wanted to come for 20 years, and I\r\nthought this year that I should come, because I am on this special\r\nmission of Reverend Crath's. Now you know what's going on in Ontario.\r\n\r\nMR. SLATE: Mr. Chairman, I think the Association will answer the 5,000\r\nletters, if he will ask.\r\n\r\nMR. DEVITT: I didn't ask. Are there any questions?\r\n\r\nDR. MCKAY: I'd like to ask a question. Was any scion wood ever brought\r\nover?\r\n\r\nMR. DEVITT: There was some scion wood brought over by the Reverend Crath\r\nin the spring of 1935, and it was brought over on the boat. I remember\r\nin those years only one that grew on a tree belonging to Mr. Corsan. I\r\ndon't think the other scion wood proved any good at all.\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: I got a little of that scion wood, and it had been waxed. The\r\nbark was nice and green, but the buds were dead.\r\n\r\nMR. CALDWELL: Do you have a plantation of young, producing trees?\r\n\r\nMR. DEVITT: No. My place, where I had those trees is now $3 million\r\nworth of buildings on 15 acres. You'd be looking down a street. They\r\nmoved in in 1944, and built up 15 acres where I had one acre in the 15.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Eastern Black Walnut as a Farm Timber Tree\r\n\r\nJOHN DAVIDSON, _Xenia, Ohio_\r\n\r\n\r\nMost people instinctively love trees. Perhaps this is an inherited\r\nresult of arboreal ancestry. Even so, very few of us realize what an\r\nastonishingly close tie exists between the survival of trees and the\r\nwell-being of the human race. Probably even fewer realize the very great\r\nimportance, in the economy of animal life, of trees which bear nuts. Not\r\nalone for the sake of their nuts are they important, valuable as nuts\r\nare, but also for the sake of the unmatched timber which some of them\r\nproduce, as well as for the sake of their service as soil conservers and\r\nbuilders, as beautifiers, and as silent, persistent builders of capital\r\nvalues.\r\n\r\nIn view of these outstanding qualities, it is strange that nut trees are\r\ntoday unfortunately and shamefully neglected in the north. Especially, I\r\nclaim, is this true of the Eastern Black walnut. Here is a mystery. Why\r\ndo not northern planters of trees plant more Eastern Black walnuts for\r\ntheir exceedingly valuable timber?\r\n\r\n\"Backward\" Burma could give us lessons in intelligent forestry. It is\r\nsaid that the Burmese are permitted to clear their thickets and tropical\r\nwoodlands for agricultural use only after they agree to plant a definite\r\namount of that land in teak, perhaps the most valuable of all woods. It\r\nis said that, due to the effectiveness of this system, some 35,000 acres\r\nhave now been stocked with this valuable timber.\r\n\r\nThere are two or three main reasons why the planting of Eastern Black\r\nwalnut for timber is thus far not very common in America. (1). The\r\nnative and favorable area of this tree is limited to a comparatively\r\nsmall section. (2), The tree grows well only in deep, fertile soil where\r\nquick-money crops have had the first call. Strip-mine planting is better\r\nthan none at all, but such soil as is left after a strip-mine operation\r\nis hardly the best. (3) We are in too great a hurry. (4) Most farmers\r\nmust have annual incomes, or they must quit farming.\r\n\r\nWhat, then, are the offsetting reasons why this kind of planting should\r\nhave an appeal to far-seeing people who are favorably located? In the\r\nfirst place, the Eastern Black walnut yields wood of unique quality.\r\nPattern makers, who must work within tolerances of thousandths of an\r\ninch, prefer it. Walter Page, a well known sports writer has this to\r\nsay: \"Few woods come as close as walnut to fulfilling all the demands of\r\na good gunstock: beauty of grain, workableness with cutting tools,\r\nresistance to warpage, weight or density in proportion to strength.\"\r\n\r\nAnother example of the many-sided versatility of this wood can be found\r\nin those timbered regions of America where termites are a problem for\r\nhome owners. Termites seem to leave black walnut wood very much alone.\r\nIt probably has a taste which termites cannot stomach. This is one\r\nreason why so many of the old rail fences of our ancestors in the walnut\r\narea were made of black walnut. The \"ground-chunks,\" in particular,\r\nwhich were laid upon the ground under the corners of the worm-fences\r\nwere often either of rock, or of walnut.\r\n\r\nJust this year I watched the demolition of part of an old log cabin\r\nwhich was being riddled by termites. Many of the ordinary logs were in\r\nruins but the walnut boards which had served as weather-boarding over\r\nthe ends of some of the termite-infested logs were as sound and as\r\nbeautifully preserved as they had been when they were placed there.\r\n\r\nIs it any wonder that so many of the pioneers who had lived long enough\r\nin the termite area to see what could happen to other lumber, chose\r\nwalnut, whenever they could get it, for structural work and for\r\nweatherboard protection?\r\n\r\nSafety of operation is still another matter for consideration. If I wish\r\nto create an estate for my family or for my last years, how can I go\r\nabout it with the best chance for success? Shall I go prospecting for\r\nprecious metals? Thousands have failed at that job where but few have\r\nsucceeded. Shall it be manufacturing? Count up the failures. For each\r\nsuccess, at least ten go broke. Wall Street? The Wall Street journals\r\nthemselves give the statistics. More than 90 percent of all persistent\r\nWall Street gamblers lose money in the end. Farming? Much safer, but\r\nmost farmers who have made much money in the past have accomplished it\r\nby way of an increase in the value of their land rather than through\r\ntheir farming operations. This is the result of fluctuating prices. Bad\r\nyears often eat up the savings of good years. Then, too, the good farmer\r\nis a busy man. The better the year the busier he is. Very little time\r\nremains for side issues, such as the planting of trees.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact, as erosion of the soil progresses, as good,\r\nproductive land becomes more scarce, and as farm labor becomes more and\r\nmore difficult to employ, the attention of informed farm owners and\r\noperators has been turning more and more to soil-building, perennial,\r\npermanent and labor-saving crops. Of these, grass and tree crops are,\r\nfar and away, the most promising today.\r\n\r\nIn view of what I have found out during the last 20 years, I am quite\r\nsure that, if I were starting now, I should expect to make farming a\r\nmajor element in my estate building, but it would be mostly tree and\r\ngrass farming, not grain farming. I should need livestock, of course, to\r\nmake use of the grass. And I like livestock.\r\n\r\nThis is what I ask of life: First of all, I must enjoy my work. I do not\r\ncare to spend all my days in getting ready to live. My job must lie\r\nalong the road I like to travel. I do not care to work at a task so\r\nburdensome, so time-consuming that I have no heart for the enjoyment of\r\nliving. At the same time, a big part of the plan must be to find a good,\r\nsafe way to build an estate. It must be feasible, practical, enjoyable.\r\n\r\nI believe, in the light of my own recent experience, that if one is\r\nproperly situated, there is much to be said for the idea of undertaking\r\nthe practice of forestry upon a rather liberal scale using Eastern Black\r\nwalnut trees as a foundation.\r\n\r\nIn the first place, I ask, what living thing upon one's farm will cause\r\nless labor than a forest tree? I know of none. This fulfills the first\r\nrequirement. A forest tree calls for a minimum of attention as\r\ncompared with other crops. This is especially true if one permits\r\nlivestock to keep down weeds and brush. And here I am likely to be\r\ncalled a heretic. The authorities say, \"No grazing in a forest\".\r\nHowever, in this field of forestry there are some traditional maxims\r\nwhich, to say the least, are not capable of universal application. The\r\nauthorities, too, have been known to rely upon what other authorities\r\ntell them--without investigating the facts for themselves. It is not\r\nwell to rely too implicitly or trustfully upon the \"authorities\", either\r\necclesiastical or scientific. \"No grazing\" is a valid enough rule to\r\nfollow in the ordinary forest, but I have found that after the trees are\r\nwell grown we can graze the land under a deep-rooted walnut tree which\r\nis planted in deep, rich soil as we would graze any meadow land--in\r\nreason and in moderation. The practice is profitable for annual income\r\nand it keeps down the fire hazard. One bad fire in an ungrazed or unmown\r\npiece of brush-covered undergrowth can destroy in an hour 50 years of\r\ntimber growth. If we plant deep-rooted nut trees in deep, rich soil, and\r\nif we fertilize that soil as any valuable permanent pasture land is\r\nfertilized, we can graze that land without injury to the trees or the\r\nland.\r\n\r\nOne other reason which is given for the prohibition of grazing is the\r\ndesire to save young tree growth. This is justified in ordinary forestry\r\npractice by the need to get annual income through successive cuttings.\r\nThe young growth must be encouraged to come on. Even so, it must be\r\nthinned as it comes. However, a forest of black walnut trees yields its\r\nannual income in another way--through its nuts and its livestock.\r\n\r\nTrees in such a forest should be planted close enough together to cause\r\nthem to reach straight up as they grow. They will not all reach straight\r\nup, of course, but enough will do so to produce as many saw-logs as will\r\nnormally grow in a forest; that is, if they have been properly planted\r\nin the first place.\r\n\r\nIn my own modified forest-type planting, the black walnut trees stand 8\r\nfeet apart in rows 20 feet apart. The 20-foot spacing between rows was\r\nplanned to provide more sunlight for nut production during the early\r\nyears. No one ever planted a forest in that way, so far as I know. The\r\ntrees are now 17 years old, about 3250 of them in all. In the best soil\r\nof this 20 acres I can count about 1000 forest-type, straight,\r\nwell-grown trees. There are about 1500 lesser trees, low-limbed trees\r\nwhich will eventually be used, perhaps, for posts or some such purpose.\r\nThere are, I regret to say, about 750 trees that will never be worth\r\nanything. An eroded slope and a hidden clay bed explain these\r\nmisbegotten dwarfs.\r\n\r\nThe variable growth of these trees proves that the first care in making\r\na planting of walnut for timber should be to plant in good soil, deep\r\nand well drained. Bottom land, even some that is occasionally\r\noverflown with flood-water, and therefore not the best wheat land,\r\nshould be excellent for Eastern Black walnuts if the drainage is good.\r\nRule two:--Select your seed or seedlings from large, straight-growing,\r\nhealthy parents. This rule needs explanation.\r\n\r\nIn last October's NUTSHELL, an organ of the Northern Nut Growers'\r\nAssociation, Spencer Chase, its editor, called attention to a showing of\r\nCarpathian Persian walnuts by Mr. H. F. Stoke which illustrated what was\r\ncalled \"the variability of seedling trees.\" The progenitor\r\nof these seedlings was a Lancaster Carpathian Persian walnut tree.\r\nDifferences in size, appearance and quality of nuts from these seedlings\r\nwere said to have been remarkable. Such differences, we know, are\r\ngreater with some species than with others. A variable ancestry often\r\nresults in a variable progeny. On the other hand, I know that my Eastern\r\nAmerican black walnuts do tend to reproduce the characteristics of their\r\nparents. I have long rows of seedling trees, all from one parent tree,\r\nstanding alongside long rows of seedlings from another parent. The\r\nsimilarity of the tree growth and nut production of the trees in their\r\nown rows, and their contrast in growth of trees and nuts to those in\r\nadjoining rows is striking and to me conclusive. A photograph taken by\r\nDr. O. D. Diller, of Ohio State University, in 1946, shows trees in a\r\nright-hand row grown from seed of a tree on the Kinsey farm, while on\r\nthe left are seedlings of a tree on the McCoy farm. The circumference of\r\ntrunks of Kinsey seedlings averages more than twice that of McCoy trees.\r\nSame soil, same age (11 years), same treatment.\r\n\r\nThose same trees, now 17 years old, still show these striking\r\ncharacteristics. It is true that each tree in a row of seedlings is an\r\nindividual in its own right. No others are exactly like it.\r\nNevertheless, the family resemblances in that row are very like those in\r\nhuman families. They are especially noticeable in the nuts--with, for\r\nexample, rough shells in one row and smooth shells in another; mainly\r\nlarge nuts in one and mainly small nuts in an adjoining family. Also,\r\nsome rows have mostly straight-growing trees, others are predominantly\r\nbranchy, like the Thomas.\r\n\r\nIt should be said in this connection that practically all of the parent\r\ntrees of these seedlings stood in isolated positions and little subject\r\nto pollination from other trees.\r\n\r\nSo much for the Eastern Black walnut's evidence of hereditary influence.\r\nSo, let us take inventory.\r\n\r\nToday, I figure that the thousand well-grown trees in this planting are\r\neach adding a dollar per year to the value of the 20 acres upon which\r\nthey stand. $1000 per year in all. This estimate, which of course seems\r\noptimistic, is based upon the statement of a walnut tree buyer--a\r\nsawmill man--who tells me that a well grown, deep-soil, 50-year-old\r\nEastern Black walnut tree should average about $50 in value. Thus far,\r\nmy 17-year-old youngsters, some of them nearly 3 feet in girth (9-1/2 to\r\n11 or more inches in diameter at breast height) look promising.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the potential added value of $1000 per year, this 20\r\nacres has produced about two tons of in-hull nuts from selected trees\r\nonly, in each of the past two years, (with more than that in prospect\r\nthis year), while the land beneath the trees grows good pasture and\r\nhelps to support a small herd of cattle and calves.\r\n\r\nOnce the trees were thoroughly established, the labor investment has\r\nbeen very small. Nature, for the most part, has done her own pruning,\r\nand has done it better than I deserve. Since the first half-dozen years,\r\nthere has been no cultivation. The trees have been practically\r\ntrouble-free. Winds have damaged a few and one wet spot has killed three\r\ntrees. There are a few black locust trees among the walnuts. I can see\r\nno evidence that the walnuts have made either better or poorer growth\r\nbecause of the proximity of these nitrogen storers. Perhaps the evidence\r\nwill show up later. We shall see.\r\n\r\nThe last item in this inventory, added value to the estate, is still\r\npotential, but the potential is surprising. If my walnut timber buyer's\r\nestimate is trustworthy, in 17 years the best 1000 trees have added\r\n17,000 potential dollars to the value of that 20 acres. And they have\r\ndone it with safety, with little labor on my part and, lately, with\r\nannual dividends of excellent nuts and good pasture. No other kind of\r\nforestry that I know of can do that.\r\n\r\nIt would, of course, be foolish to claim that the kind of management\r\nhere described would be wise or workable with other forest species. Wise\r\nforest management requires, first of all, that the choice of species\r\nshall be adapted to the soil and climate favored by that species. It\r\nrequires a proper density of stand. Finally, good management demands\r\nthat a choice be made of the most valuable type of timber that can be\r\nproduced upon your land. If you can grow walnut successfully, it would\r\nbe foolish to grow Willow or Box Elder.\r\n\r\nOne necessary thing I must do, a thing that I should advise others\r\nsimilarly situated to do, namely, place a tight legal fence around this\r\ntwenty acres in order to assure the trees' survival until 50 years have\r\nproved or disproved my faith. For, after all, these trees are guinea\r\npigs--pioneering. They break some traditional rules. The land they stand\r\non is grazed. They are not set the traditional 80 feet apart. Their nut\r\ncrops may dwindle away. One never sees walnut trees growing in pure\r\nstands--always with other species which scatter their seeds and push in.\r\nThey are not monopolists--like the pines.\r\n\r\nVery well, we shall see. My own small experiment in unorthodox ways has\r\nthe temerity to suggest a new treatment for a species of timber tree\r\nwhich I personally regard as America's very best gift of its kind to the\r\nworld. For 17 years my modified forest-type planting of black walnut\r\ntrees has not disappointed me. That is why I now believe that the farmer\r\nin the Eastern black walnut's native habitat who fails to set out these\r\nnut trees wherever he can is losing a good opportunity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe McKinster Persian Walnut\r\n\r\nP. E. MACHOVINA, _Columbus, Ohio_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe McKinster Persian walnut first attracted public attention when it\r\nreceived first place in the preliminary Persian walnut contest conducted\r\nby the Northern Nut Growers Association in 1949. In the follow-up\r\ncontest of 1950, the variety was granted third place. The McKinster tree\r\nresulted from Crath Carpathian seed secured through the Wisconsin\r\nHorticultural Society by Mr. Ray McKinster of Columbus, Ohio. The seed\r\nwas obtained and planted in the spring of 1938, hence the tree is now 15\r\nyears of age. Probably this seed was secured by Rev. Crath during his\r\nlast trip when, presumably, he made some of his most careful selections.\r\n\r\nAltogether, Mr. McKinster planted eleven Crath nuts in the back yard of\r\nhis small city lot, nine of which germinated. All but two of the\r\nresulting seedlings were distributed to friends and relatives living in\r\nthe countryside. Many of these trees have disappeared due to accidents\r\nand lack of care; a few, however, have produced nuts which apparently\r\nare not exceptional. One such nut examined was of medium size with a\r\nfairly thick shell; the kernel was of good flavor but somewhat bitter.\r\nOf the two trees retained by Mr. McKinster, both were permitted to grow\r\nwhere the seed was planted, however one died of an unknown cause when\r\nfive years of age. Nuts produced by this tree were inferior to those\r\nproduced by the survivor which later became known as the McKinster\r\nvariety.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe McKinster tree may be viewed in the accompanying illustrations which\r\nshow it without foliage and with foliage. The pictures were taken in\r\nMarch and August, respectively, 1953. Since it is a very beautiful and\r\nrelatively clean tree, the McKinster would be desirable in any yard.\r\nFrom the pictures, it will be noted that the site is unfortunate being\r\nrestricted by two garages, an alley, and with numerous overhead utility\r\nwires. Some effort was made two years ago to keep the tree out of the\r\nwires by cutting back top growth. The trimming stimulated the usual\r\nvigorous, annual growth to produce terminals as great as 10 feet in one\r\nyear. Ordinarily, annual growths of 6 feet of husky wood are not\r\nunusual. New wood and buds are hardy in appearance and assume a rich\r\nbrown color upon maturing. With such growth, cutting 1000 feet of scion\r\nwood annually would be no problem. The tree is now about 35 feet in\r\nheight with a like spread.\r\n\r\nThe bearing record of the McKinster Persian has been excellent. Its\r\nfirst crop of five or six nuts was borne at five years of age and large\r\ncrops have been consistently set each year since with but one exception.\r\nCrop records have been impossible to maintain since the tree is located\r\nin a section of the city where squirrels abound. Any nuts saved must be\r\nprotected by screen-wire cages. The hunger of the squirrels for the nuts\r\nis amazing. For example, in 1951, they descended upon the tree during\r\nthe first week of July and destroyed all nuts of the large crop within\r\ntwo weeks. These nuts could not possibly have been filled and,\r\nconsequently, could have been of little nutrient value. In their\r\nvoracity, the squirrels frequently work on the cages and sometimes\r\nmanage to break through. To facilitate this endeavor, limbs up to one\r\ninch in diameter carrying cages are sometimes cut off so the squirrels\r\ncan attack more conveniently from the ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt could be that nuts saved by caging are sometimes inferior. The cages\r\nused are made by folding window screen into a doubled, 4 to 6 inch\r\nsquare, producing an \"envelope\" with wire sewn edges. Crowding from one\r\nto three nuts into a cage may result in inhibited development,\r\nespecially since considerable leaf surface must be removed when\r\ninstalling a cage. Because Mr. McKinster has been ill for several\r\nyears, it has been difficult to accomplish the caging; consequently, but\r\nfew nuts are saved. For example, in 1950, there were insufficient nuts\r\nto meet the 25 nut sample required by the contest judges. All available\r\nnuts, some probably inferior, were entered, and it is a matter of\r\nconjecture whether the nuts might have been judged higher under\r\ndifferent circumstances. Also conjectural are the questions of crop size\r\nand regularity of bearing in the event the tree was permitted to mature\r\nits nuts.\r\n\r\nThe McKinster nuts, which were the principal consideration in the\r\ncontests rather than the tree itself, are excellent in nearly all\r\naspects. They are of medium size, averaging around 35 to the pound, with\r\nabout 52 per cent kernel. The shell is moderately thin, light in color,\r\nwell sealed, of a satisfactory shape (see illustration), and with\r\nexcellent cracking qualities. The kernel is light, plump, of excellent\r\nflavor, and in the words of one authority, \"probably rank with the best\r\nin freedom from bitterness.\" The nuts are matured by the middle of\r\nSeptember and, later, drop, free of the husk.\r\n\r\nBlooming of the parent tree usually occurs during the first week of May.\r\nIn 1951, the staminate flowers were first observed April 29 and the\r\npistillate flowers May 2. The narrator visited the tree on May 4 at\r\nwhich time some catkins had fallen; it was estimated that one-half to\r\ntwo-thirds of the pollen had been shed. The pistillate flowers appeared\r\nto be either receptive or slightly past at this stage. Mr. McKinster\r\ncommented that the blooming period of 1951 was from a few days to a week\r\nearlier than usual. In 1952, the shedding of pollen started on April 29.\r\nFrom the foregoing, it may be noted that the McKinster Persian is\r\nentirely or largely self-pollinating. No other Persian walnut trees\r\nwhich might assist in pollination occur in the vicinity and all known\r\nseedlings raised from nuts of the parent McKinster tree have appeared to\r\nbe pure Persian. Leafing out starts about a week before the bloom\r\nappears. In the fall, leaves are colored a beautiful bronze and are\r\nbrought down in a great shower by the first frost.\r\n\r\nA sample of the soil in which the McKinster tree is growing, taken at a\r\ndepth of 6 inches, was tested in July 1950. The results specify that the\r\nsoil is mostly silt with an average amount of organic matter and that\r\nevidence indicates it to contain ashes. The acidity is specified as\r\n\"neutral\", potash \"high\", and phosphate \"low\". No mention is made of\r\navailable nitrogen; however, the dark green color of the leaves and\r\nvigorousness of growth would indicate a satisfactory supply. Fertilizer\r\nin small amount was applied once or twice during the early life of the\r\ntree; also, during this period, Mr. McKinster \"spaded in\" garbage, etc.,\r\nto increase the humus content of the soil. In 1951, the narrator checked\r\nthe pH of the soil near the surface and obtained a value of 6.5.\r\n\r\nOnly one instance of damage due to climatic conditions and none\r\nwhatsoever from insects and diseases has ever been observed with the\r\nparent McKinster tree. Undoubtedly, the city location offers some\r\nprotection from frost, but may also be detrimental, on occasion, through\r\nheat reflected from the many surrounding white-painted buildings. For\r\nexample, an unseasonable warm spell occurred in Columbus during the\r\nlatter part of the first week in April of the current year. The heat,\r\nlasting for several days, reached a high of 80.4 degrees and, as a\r\nresult, the McKinster tree started vegetating. Leaf growths of from\r\none-half to one inch had been reached when normal conditions returned.\r\nTwo weeks later, a cold spell with snow and temperatures of 22 degrees\r\nkilled the new growth but did not injure the wood. Following this,\r\nleafing re-occurred, but at a slower rate and somewhat later than\r\nnormal. The size ultimately attained by the leaves is about one-half\r\ntheir usual size, and, consequently, the accompanying illustration,\r\ntaken this summer, does not exhibit the usual luxuriant appearance of\r\nthe tree. A large part of the bloom was damaged by the cold, hence the\r\ntree set a lighter crop of nuts than usual.\r\n\r\nIn connection with early vegetating, it may be remarked that Mr.\r\nMcKinster, several years ago, presented two small grafted trees of his\r\nvariety to a relative living in eastern Kentucky. These trees were\r\nplanted on low ground and were killed the first year by late spring\r\nfrosts after leafing out twice. Thus it seems evident that the McKinster\r\ntree has the fault, common in Carpathians, of leafing out too early and\r\nbeing injured by late spring frosts, especially when planted too far\r\nsouth. Three other trees, grafted by Mr. McKinster and now about four\r\nyears from the graft, are situated in the countryside several miles\r\nsouth of Columbus, Ohio, where they are doing excellently, having never\r\nbeen damaged.\r\n\r\nThe writer has several three year old McKinster grafts at his property\r\nin southeastern Ohio which were deliberately set on stocks located in a\r\nbad frost pocket. The grafts, which are adjacent to a woods, have made\r\nfair growth each spring but are injured during the summer by an insect\r\nlaying eggs in the succulent growth. The portion of terminal above the\r\npoint of sting invariably dies the following winter and has the\r\nappearance produced by winter killing. This damage has not been unique\r\nwith the McKinster, having also occurred with the McDermid, Watt,\r\nBurtner, and other Persian varieties growing nearby; some of the latter\r\nwere killed outright the first winter after grafting.\r\n\r\nA one-year McKinster grafted tree with three feet of growth above the\r\ngraft was cut back and transplanted by the writer to the yard of his\r\nColumbus, Ohio, home during the winter of 1952. Growth the following\r\nspring was about two feet and obtained in rather poor soil. After a long\r\nabsence during the summer which was attended by a prolonged drouth, the\r\ntree was found in a dying condition, having lost all its leaves. Hurried\r\nwatering resulted in a complete new coat of leaves and a small amount of\r\nadditional terminal growth. The tree matured its growth and withstood\r\nthe winter nicely, but suffered, similar to the parent, from the April,\r\n1953, unseasonable weather. Growth this summer from adventitious buds\r\nhas been poor.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately, the McKinster variety saw but little testing in other\r\nparts of the country prior to its recognition in 1949. So that this\r\nreport might be as complete as possible, requests were sent to several\r\ndozen experimenters who are known to have grafted the McKinster, asking\r\nfor their experiences and opinions of the variety. The requests went to\r\npeople scattered generally throughout the northeastern portion of the\r\ncountry, a very few of which had received scion wood in 1950, a larger\r\nportion in 1951, and the bulk in 1952. For the most part, replies\r\nindicate satisfaction and even enthusiasm; very few report failure.\r\nDefinite conclusions cannot be drawn because of the short time of\r\ntrial; however, a general description of experiences will provide\r\nindications.\r\n\r\nFew experimenters report failure in grafting, most stating the variety\r\nto be \"easy to graft.\" Any who mention the characteristic,\r\nstate that \"grafts are vigorous,\" or that \"it is a fairly rapid grower.\"\r\nFor the experimenters, the McKinster seems to be about \"average\" in its\r\ntime of leafing out. Many report a set of nuts the second year after\r\ngrafting. As to time of maturing new growth, the reply of Mr. Stephen\r\nBernath of New York, \"New growth matures about the end of September,\" is\r\nfairly typical, as is the reply of Dr. R. T. Dunstan of North Carolina,\r\n\"It appears to harden wood well ahead of frost.\" Most reports indicate\r\nno winter injury but are tempered by cautious observations that\r\ntemperatures had not been low. Mr. H. F. Stoke of Virginia, who grafted\r\nthe McKinster in the spring of 1950, reports: \"Pistillate buds developed\r\nduring the summer of 1951 were killed by a frost catching new growth in\r\nthe spring of 1952.\" Mr. John Howe of Missouri was the sole reporter of\r\ncatastrophe when he stated: \"My McKinster graft was killed by the\r\nNovember, 1951, cold while the Lake and McDermid varieties close by were\r\nnot hurt.\" Mr. Sylvester Shessler of northern Ohio reports: \"The\r\nMcKinster withstood, without injury, the 1951 winter which killed 4\r\nhybrids and a Crath, and injured several others.\" Mr. Harry P. Burgart\r\nof Michigan reports the variety as doing extra well for him. The only\r\nreply mentioning disease came from Dr. Dunstan who says: \"It has been\r\nfairly clean in foliage so far, less susceptible to leaf spot than\r\nsome.\" Mr. John Gerstenmaier of Massillon, Ohio, grafted the McKinster\r\nin 1951 and reports excellent growth with a diameter of 2 inches at the\r\ngraft after two years. He reports temperatures of 16 degrees very early\r\nin November which caused no harm, and pistillate bloom from May 8 to 16,\r\n1952, which materialized into a crop of two nuts; pollen was supplied by\r\nadjacent Carpathians. Leafing out ordinarily starts about a week prior\r\nto the bloom for Mr. Gerstenmaier; but, in April, 1953, the unseasonable\r\nweather conditions also occurring in his vicinity caused early\r\nvegetating and killing, while at nearby Orrville, the variety was\r\nundamaged.\r\n\r\nMr. Gilbert Becker of Michigan, who is enthusiastic about the McKinster\r\nvariety, believes the qualities of the nut to be superb and the\r\ncharacteristics of the tree satisfactory. He is of the opinion that the\r\ntoo-short dormancy of the variety is not a serious objection,\r\nparticularly with climatic conditions such as those experienced in\r\nMichigan. Even in central Ohio, where peach and apple crops are\r\nfrequently lost due to spring frosts, the McKinster has not been injured\r\nwhen located in the countryside and injured but once during its 15\r\nyears, with a resultant smaller than usual crop, when located in the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nIn closing, it might be well to comment on the fact that nuts of the\r\nMcKinster, Hansen and Jacobs varieties alone placed high in both the\r\n1949 and 1950 N.N.G.A. contests and that different panels of judges\r\nserved in the two events. Certainly the nuts of these varieties are of a\r\nsuperior quality, and it would seem important to determine those parts\r\nof the country where these varieties are sufficiently hardy to be of\r\ncommercial value. Certainly these varieties should be given every\r\nopportunity to prove themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCarpathian Walnuts in the Columbia River Basin\r\n\r\nLYNN TUTTLE, _Clarkston, Wash_.\r\n\r\n\r\nMr. Chairman and friends of the nut culture, I regret that I cannot meet\r\nwith you at this time, but fate seems to have decreed otherwise. The\r\npleasant memory of the meeting at Guelph is still with me and I must\r\nadmit a feeling of humility as I prepare this paper for a group of\r\nsincere and devoted people united in a common interest.\r\n\r\nThe Pacific Northwest extends from the Rocky Mountains to the Pacific\r\nOcean. This area is divided by the Cascade Mountains which run north and\r\nsouth. Between the Cascades and the Pacific we have a coastal area\r\nwherein winters are generally mild, summers cool, and rainfall abundant.\r\nUnder these, conditions many plants do not attain a high degree of\r\ndormancy. Zero weather in Seattle will damage walnuts as much as will\r\ntwenty-five degrees below zero in the more continental climate east of\r\nthe Cascades. Carpathian walnuts have proved their value under both\r\ncoastal and interior conditions. This hardiness is at least partially\r\ndue to their tendency to mature their buds and harden their growth\r\nearlier in the fall than do other types of English walnuts.\r\n\r\nBetween the Cascades and the Rockies is a vast area part plateau and\r\npart mountains. It is scarred with deep canyons and crossed by swift\r\nstreams fed from springs and mountain snows. Roughly the elevation of\r\nfarm lands varies from five hundred to over forty-five hundred feet.\r\nDepending largely on slope and elevation, rainfall varies from about\r\neight to twenty-five inches. In general, summer days are bright, dry,\r\nand fairly hot. Nights are clear and cool. Winters are unpredictable but\r\nalways vary much according to location and elevation. Infrequently\r\ntemperatures may drop to more than twenty below zero at Clarkston. Other\r\nareas of similar elevation may be five to ten degrees colder.\r\n\r\nFor the sake of clarity and to reduce the territory covered, we will\r\nconfine ourselves largely to that part of the Columbia Basin irrigated\r\nand to be irrigated in Central Washington. The application is general,\r\nhowever.\r\n\r\nGrand Coulee Dam has made feasible the irrigation of about 1-1/4 million\r\nacres of sage brush, bunch grass, and marginal wheat lands. Irrigation\r\nis already practised over other vast acreages. This land is level to\r\nrolling, and is of sandy loam nature. It is deeply under-laid by layers\r\nof lava rock--in places thousands of feet thick. As in most arid\r\nclimates the soil is rich in minerals but low in nitrogen and organic\r\nmatter. Under irrigation production is amazing. The growing season is\r\nsufficiently long for Carpathian walnuts anywhere in the irrigated area.\r\n\r\nWalnuts originally from Southern Europe have proved unsatisfactory\r\nbecause they killed at 20 to 25 below zero. It was discouraging to have\r\na ten or fifteen year old tree killed outright by an unusual winter. But\r\nit was just these conditions that led to the discovery of the Schafer\r\nwalnut. This tree survived the winters of 1936 and 1937 in a part of the\r\nYakima valley where all other varieties similarly located were killed.\r\nSo far as I know, none of these were Carpathians.\r\n\r\nMany Carpathians are now being planted, mostly for yard trees, but\r\npromise to eventually become one of the big commercial crops of the\r\narea. However, skepticism on the part of the public and scarcity of\r\nnursery stock has delayed commercial planting. A fair portion of good\r\ngrowers are now convinced that commercial growing is profitable and\r\nstock, our own and others, is becoming more plentiful.\r\n\r\nOur experience has been confined largely to the Schafer walnut and it\r\nis, aside from some promising seedlings, so far as we know, the only\r\nproven Carpathian in this area. We do not wish to discredit\r\npossibilities of any other variety, but must speak out of our own\r\nobservations. There are numerous small, commercial plantings now\r\nproducing, the nuts being sold locally. Accurate production figures are\r\nnot available and if available would vary greatly due to the care given\r\nthe trees. The Schafer, and this will undoubtedly hold true of some\r\nother Carpathians, bears more at five years than a Franquette does at\r\nten. I have seen apple boxes (about one bushel) of nuts harvested from\r\nfive and six years old trees. Production increases rapidly with age.\r\n\r\nAs with fruit trees good air drainage and good soil drainage are\r\ndesirable for the walnut orchard. The Schafer starts fairly early in the\r\nspring and new leaves are easily nipped by late frosts. A severe late\r\nfreeze might also injure new growth although I do not recall a crop\r\nhaving been lost due to this cause. Although pollinizers have not been\r\nused, we think that on young trees and in some years they might insure a\r\nbetter crop. We are now propagating two pollinizing varieties the\r\ncatkins of which come out later than the Schafer.\r\n\r\nTrees planted sixty feet apart permit inter-planting to row and other\r\ncrops for several years. Columbia Basin lands under irrigation produce\r\nenormous crops of potatoes, beans, sugar beets, rutabagas, green peas,\r\nclover or alfalfa seed, peppermint oil, and fruit. Average potato--20\r\ntons, alfalfa hay--7 tons (three cuttings), alfalfa seed--800 pounds,\r\ndry beans--2,500 pounds, wheat--70 to 100 bushels. In some areas peach\r\nor apricot trees make good fillers.\r\n\r\nCarpathians also fit into the picture as yard trees, for border\r\nplantings,--either to utilize run-off water or to use water wasted along\r\nditches and pipe lines and for wind breaks. This open country is\r\nnaturally windy and trees greatly reduce the ground velocity of wind.\r\n\r\nNut production in this area appears to be much heavier than on the coast\r\nor in California with varieties now being grown there. So far we are\r\npest-free. The potentials of good Carpathian walnuts in this area are\r\nunlimited.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWalnuts and Filberts in Southern Wisconsin\r\n\r\nC. F. LADWIG, _Beloit, Wisc._\r\n\r\n\r\nMy farm is located a few blocks north of the Illinois-Wisconsin line on\r\na rise overlooking the city of Beloit, whose western limits are almost\r\nadjacent to my land. Temperature in this section ranges from 100 degrees\r\nabove to 30 degrees below zero; rarely reaching either extreme--with an\r\naverage frost free period of 173 days. Rainfall averages approximately\r\n35 inches. Walnut, butternut, bitternut, hazel and hickory are native,\r\nbut just about non-existent in my vicinity except on my place in the\r\nyoung state.\r\n\r\nThe land on my place has been tobaccoed and corned out for over 100\r\nyears and its once rich clay loam with sandy streaks was unable to grow\r\nragweed over 2 inches high when I bought it. Trying to grow nut trees in\r\nthis soil presents problems as you well know. My problem was not to get\r\nthem to grow vigorously but to get them to grow at all. However, by\r\nusing fertile spots, formerly barnyard and around the house, I got\r\nseveral walnuts and filberts started.\r\n\r\nI have an eight year old Crath #1, two Myers black walnuts, about the\r\nsame age, Cochrane and Thomas, 6 years, all obtained from Mr. Berhow,\r\nand a fine assortment of Jones hybrid filberts from Mrs. Langdoc, a Rush\r\nfilbert from Mr. Burgart, two European filberts from the New York State\r\nFruit Testing Association, some hybrid seedlings, some native hazels\r\nfrom seed, some bitternut seedlings from Mr. Weschcke, a few native\r\nhickory seedlings, an American chestnut seedling from Scarff, 2\r\nbutternut seedlings, 2 nice Chinese tree hazels from Mr. Shessler,\r\nseveral Jacobs walnut seedlings, and _regia_ & _hindsii_ hybrids from\r\nseed of Mr. Pozzi, some Crath seedlings and a number of Thomas black\r\nwalnut seedlings--also native walnut seedlings.\r\n\r\nMr. Shessler and Prof. J. C. McDaniel have been a source of\r\nhelp, advice, and inspiration to me and I am\r\ndeeply indebted to them, as well as to many other members of the\r\nN.N.G.A. who have shared their experiences with me.\r\n\r\nHow have the trees done? The Crath #1 is bearing a few nuts this year.\r\nIt had no catkins, but the Cochrane was loaded with staminate bloom at\r\nthe right time. I got busy with the Cochrane pollen and a brush and went\r\nto work on the Crath pistillate bloom. Very pleased with this cross I\r\nlooked the Crath over a few days later to check on progress. I picked\r\nthe little nutlets off the ground and inspected them carefully, then\r\nthrew them into the chickens to see if they would eat them. Back in my\r\nmind was the feeling that Mother Nature thought I was getting too big\r\nfor my britches and decided to teach me a lesson. However she generously\r\nallowed a few air pollinated nutlets to grow, and so there will be a\r\nsmall crop of the round and plump smooth green balls.\r\n\r\nThe Crath #1 is not perfectly hardy as it freezes back an inch or two in\r\nthe cold winters. Two years ago the warm wet fall left it unprepared for\r\nthe sudden onslaught of winter and several whole branches died and the\r\ntrunk split open, the split sounding like a rifle shot one cold, crisp\r\nevening. I happened to be standing by it at the time.\r\n\r\nThe Myers black walnuts are splendid trees and just about hardy. They\r\nbore a few nuts and second and third year from planting, which sapped\r\ntheir vitality. They then bore nothing for about three years, which\r\nhappened to be unfavorable years for walnuts anyway, and began to bear\r\nagain this year with a moderate crop. It looks like the plum curculio,\r\nmy arch insect enemy, is trying the nuts for size. I saved some Cochrane\r\npollen and went to work on the Myers, with you know what results.\r\nHowever three of the nutlets stayed on the tree; so that I may have\r\neffected a cross between Myers and Cochrane.\r\n\r\nThomas has acted peculiarly for me. It went thru the devastating\r\nwinters of 1950 and 1951 in fine shape, then froze back last winter when\r\nthe temperatures never went below 5 degrees below zero. The very dry\r\nfall should have ripened all branches to perfection. My mule, Zombie,\r\ntook a liking to the branches and leaves of this tree, so it is now\r\ntrimmed up like an umbrella. The small nut crop must have also gone down\r\nZombie's gullet. He is more destructive to walnut and plum than the\r\ncurculio. (Tie him up. Ed.) Thomas does not seem to have a great future\r\nup here.\r\n\r\nNow Cochrane is different. If that little tree has as many nuts on it as\r\nit had catkins this year, I'm going to have to move the corn out of the\r\ncrib and put the walnuts in there. It is not a fast growing tree, but\r\nthis may be the fault of the spot it is in, judging by the color of the\r\nleaves. I never got around to fertilizing it.\r\n\r\nNow that I told you about the Cochrane, I'll have to tell you about the\r\n\"Wayne\" black walnut. It is eight years old, stands about eight feet\r\nhigh and is hardy. My Black Walnut seedlings stand from six inches to\r\nsix feet high. They go back to six inches every other year when I cut\r\nthem down to graft them. Nobody in the nut tree field can call me a\r\ngrafter. I'll make him prove it!\r\n\r\nThe hickory, butternut, bitternut, and chestnut are step children and\r\nfend for themselves on less desirable soil. All are small. The\r\nregia-hindsii hybrids are small and young and are being given special\r\ncare, but may not be perfectly hardy. They grow well.\r\n\r\nThe Jones hybrid filberts stand from six to eight feet high, except\r\nthose planted recently. This year they have a fair crop. The catkins\r\ncame thru the winter in good shape for the most part. My two European\r\nfilberts, which have lost their identity, but are either Italian Red,\r\nCosford, or Medium Long, (one of the three perished) usually suffer the\r\nloss of their catkins and occasionally lose a branch or two to\r\nwinter's icy fingers.\r\n\r\nTo me, the filberts are fascinating at all times of the year. When the\r\nsnow is deep and the cold bites deep, their tight little catkins always\r\nhold forth the comfortable promise of spring. When spring does come the\r\nthrill of the tiny red blossoms and lumbering catkins is as real and\r\nenduring as the promise of a crop of the shiny nuts is fickle. Then, of\r\ncourse, after the last tiny blossom has faded and the last catkin has\r\nwithered, the leaves push forth. To me, these tiny leaves are a sight\r\ncomparable to the opening and unfurling of the various varieties of the\r\ngrape. Then enters the element of suspense, between the time of leafing\r\nout and the time when the little nut clusters appear.\r\n\r\nMy bushes are all growing together on a rise of ground near an old barn\r\nfoundation. The ground is rich and they love it. Each bush is individual\r\nand distinctive as are their nuts--some tucked far in the husk, some\r\nbulging out in a precarious fashion, some fat and round, others long and\r\nnarrow. They're interesting. I can let the butternuts, bitternuts and\r\nhickories pass, the heartnuts, chestnuts, and pecans can wait until I am\r\nsure they will bear here. The walnut will grow up along with the other\r\ntrees--blending into the landscape, but the filberts, like Zombie, call\r\nattention to themselves every day of the year.\r\n\r\nSomebody said recently that the emphasis in England is in being, and in\r\nour country in becoming. I imagine our land stopped being with the\r\ndisappearance of the Indian and the primeval forest and is now in the\r\nprocess of becoming something else. What that something else is we don't\r\nknow, and each generation carries a new set of values, but we all know\r\nthat to become something better, trees must and will figure in the plans\r\nof all generations--better and more useful and more disease resistant\r\ntrees. It is significant that nut trees lead in these requirements.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBiology, Distribution and Control of the Walnut Husk Maggot\r\n\r\nDR. F. L. GAMBRELL, _New York State Agricultural Experiment Station,\r\nGeneva, N. Y._\r\n\r\n\r\nDR. GAMBRELL: Mr. Chairman, ladies and gentlemen, some 22 years ago, I\r\nbelieve it was, I attended one of your meetings at the Experiment\r\nStation in Geneva, and at that time I gave a little talk on the walnut\r\nhusk maggot. Perhaps some of you are old enough to have been there and\r\nremembered something about it, or maybe you are old enough so that you\r\nhave forgotten as much as I have, so it would be worth talking over\r\nagain. At any rate, when the chairman of your program committee wrote\r\nDr. Chapman, asking him if he might talk, he came to me and said, \"Would\r\nyou be willing to do this?\" I said I'd be willing but I didn't know\r\nwhether I'd be able. But finally, the pressure was so great that I said\r\nyes, and I am here.\r\n\r\nAfter I accepted the invitation, I made up my mind that I would like to\r\nbring myself up to date as much as possible on recent developments on\r\nwalnuts, so I took the liberty of writing to a lot of our entomological\r\ncolleagues and talking to one of your members, Mr. Slate, in the hope\r\nthat I might get some more recent information on the maggots, or,\r\nparticularly, the control of this walnut husk maggot. I wrote to some 10\r\nor 15 entomologists in 15 states, as well as the United States\r\nDepartment of Agriculture in Washington and to our neighbors on the\r\nnorth in Ottawa. I must say that I have had a very fine response from\r\neverybody. They were all very willing to help, but practically all of\r\nthem had the same answer: while they knew there was such a bug, they\r\ndidn't know too much about it as an economic pest. So that left us all\r\nright in the same boat, with about two exceptions, as when we began. Our\r\nfriends to the north in Canada sent some very nice information. We also\r\nhad some information from the U. S. Bureau of Entomology and Plant\r\nQuarantine, Washington, D. C., together with some illustrated material.\r\nAlso our good friend, Dr. Boyce, at the Citrus Experiment Station, in\r\nRiverside, California, with whom I have discussed the walnut husk maggot\r\nproblem quite a few years ago, had a very nice bit of information and\r\nillustrative material which he provided. Incidentally, he is the man who\r\nhas been mainly responsible for the development of the walnut husk fly\r\ncontrol program for the nut industry in California. I would certainly\r\nlike to take this opportunity to acknowledge any contributions he or the\r\nother people have made towards this discussion.\r\n\r\nIn New York State we have in our official list of insects about 30\r\nspecies of fruit flies that are catalogued, but only about five of these\r\ncan be classified as of economic importance. Two of these occur on the\r\ncherries, both sweets and sours, and are called the cherry maggots.\r\nAnother one on apples, known as apple maggot, and a related form on\r\nblueberry. And then, of course, the walnut husk maggot, and one other\r\nwhich occasionally occurs on currants, but this one, of course, is of\r\nless importance than the others.\r\n\r\nThe fruit industry, of course, in New York is quite large, both apples\r\nand cherries, so that there is a considerable problem there as far as\r\ncontrol is concerned. The growers spend thousands of dollars every year\r\nin combatting the various species of fruit flies. The interesting thing\r\nin this connection is that throughout the last 25 years with which I am\r\nfamiliar with the cherry fruit flies--in fact, that was one of the first\r\nprojects I worked on in cooperation with Dr. Hugh Glasgow when I came to\r\nthe Experiment Station in 1925--the control measures which we developed\r\nin 1925 to 1927 are essentially the ones which we are still using today;\r\nthat is, for the most part. There have been various attempts to change\r\nthe control program through the introduction of these newer\r\ninsecticides, and some progress has been made, but in every case they\r\nhave been wrought with some difficulties. At the present time the\r\nofficial state recommendations for the control of apple maggot and\r\ncherry maggot still include the use of arsenate of lead under some\r\nconditions. I mention that at this point because it is of some\r\nsignificance in the overall control. I am going to discuss that later\r\non.\r\n\r\nAs far as the host plants and distribution of the walnut husk maggot is\r\nconcerned, according to the original description which was published\r\nalmost a hundred years ago, it was listed as occurring in and to the\r\nMiddle States. That is a little bit indefinite, but at least it occurs\r\nall over the Eastern United States and as far west as Kansas. Then the\r\none which occurs in California, which has since been called _Rhagoletis\r\ncompletus_ (?) looks very similar to the one that we have here, but\r\nthere are slight taxonomic differences, so at least it is considered a\r\ndifferent species. At any rate, it is very similar to the one we have\r\nhere, and this whole group of fruit flies that we have been talking\r\nabout have a lot of similarity in their wing patterns and things of that\r\nsort.\r\n\r\nAnd the fact that I mentioned the control as generally as I did is of\r\nsignificance in that all of these flies of the various species are\r\napparently susceptible to the same type of control measure.\r\n\r\nAs far as the host plants are concerned, I have personally observed\r\ninjury on all of our common _Juglans_ species that I have run across in\r\nNew York State and in some of the states to the south of us, including\r\nbutternut, Japanese walnut, English walnut and black walnut. I have seen\r\nreports of infestations which were recorded in hickory, but I personally\r\nhave not seen them.\r\n\r\nI'd just like to have a show of hands. How many in the audience here\r\nhave had experience with the walnut husk maggot or had injury on the\r\nfruit? (Showing of hands.) I see the majority of you certainly know what\r\nit is, but just as a brief reminder, the type of injury, of course,\r\nvaries somewhat depending possibly on the variety and time of year at\r\nwhich the fruits first become infested. We know, of course, that the\r\nflies do not begin to puncture the husk until they attain a certain\r\ndegree of softness. Early in the season they are not able, apparently,\r\nto penetrate the husk with the ovipositor, and that, of course, varies\r\nnot only with hardness but with varieties. The flies, of course, may be\r\nseen on the fruit even though they are not able to penetrate the husk\r\nand deposit their eggs. These husks, of course, many of them, become dry\r\nand hard after they have been tunnelled out, and it is almost impossible\r\nto clean the shells. Occasionally you have nuts in which you have a\r\nseparation of the suture, and in those cases you very frequently get the\r\nexudate from the husk penetrating through the suture in the shell onto\r\nthe kernels themselves, and in those cases molds may grow on the kernels\r\nso that those fruits are no good.\r\n\r\nIn connection with this injury I am going to show you some slides in a\r\nfew minutes, but the preceding speaker made reference to a type of\r\ninjury which occurred on the terminal growth of a walnut tree and that\r\nis one that we have had a lot of inquiries at the Experiment Station\r\nabout, injury to the new terminal growth fairly early in the season.\r\nThat probably, in most cases, is caused by the butternut or the walnut\r\ncurculio. Early in the season these adults begin feeding on the new\r\nterminal growth, and they even puncture the new growth and lay their\r\neggs there before the nuts are large enough for them to attack and very\r\noften considerable killing back of the terminal growth occurs. I have\r\nseen it on English walnut seedlings in nursery rows where there would be\r\nvery large kill-back from the walnut curculio. Superficially the injury\r\non the fruit is quite similar to that of the husk maggot.\r\n\r\n(First slide.) This first slide is just to give you some idea of the\r\ngeneral areas of fruit growing and distribution in New York State. The\r\neastern section, right-hand side, Champlain Valley and Hudson Valley,\r\nare primarily apple maggot regions. Some walnut husk fly probably occurs\r\nthere, but they are predominantly apple-growing areas. In the central\r\npart of the state, northern, particularly, we have fruit, and as far as\r\nI know, there are no plantings of walnuts there, though you people may\r\nknow of some. In The Ontario Plains section south of Lake Ontario is one\r\nof our big fruit belts in the State. Some walnuts are also grown here.\r\nConsequently this area has in it apple, walnut and cherry maggot flies,\r\nand, of course, they will be lapping over in all those areas into\r\nsurrounding territories. But this gives you an idea, in a general way,\r\nof the distribution of the host plants and the flies about which I have\r\nbeen speaking.\r\n\r\n(Next slide.) Those flies get pretty big when you get them up there.\r\nThey are not that easy to see in the field. The ones on the top are the\r\nspecies found on cherries. The one on the lower left is the apple\r\nmaggot, the one on the lower right is walnut husk maggot. The only\r\ndifference you can see here is in the wing pattern but in nature they\r\ndiffer in color. They all have a little different wing pattern. Also,\r\nthere is a little difference in size, the walnut husk maggot being the\r\nbiggest of the four species shown here.\r\n\r\n(Next slide.) I have shown here the emergence date of the various\r\nspecies, including the cherry fruit flies, the apple maggot and the\r\nwalnut husk fly. And you notice that beginning over about the first week\r\nin June you have emergence of the cherry fruit flies, and you have a\r\ncontinuance of emergence of some of these species up until at least the\r\nfirst or second week in August. These points going up and down just show\r\nthe number of flies that were taken on given dates, and there is a very\r\ndefinite correlation between the proportion of flies that emerge on any\r\ngiven day with the temperature or moisture condition. Some years, when\r\nyou have very hot, dry weather, there is considerable mortality of these\r\nflies as they just do not seem to be able to emerge from the soil, which\r\nis a good thing.\r\n\r\n(Next slide.) This photograph is one that I wasn't sure I was going to\r\nget back in time for the meeting, but it is a Kodachrome of a pair of\r\nflies mating on an English walnut. This happened to occur on some of our\r\nown trees at the station, so that we are not immune from attack by this\r\nbug.\r\n\r\n(Next slide.) That is a close-up of an egg puncture, just a very tiny\r\nlittle hole in the husk, and once in a while they lay an egg even on the\r\nsurface. Those eggs are quite small, about a millimeter in length and\r\nabout two-tenths of a millimeter in width, but the next slide will show\r\nyou that what they normally do is to put them inside that puncture in\r\ngroups. They vary quite a bit, but the average number of eggs is about\r\n20 in each puncture. But that doesn't mean you won't have maybe four or\r\nfive different punctures on a given nut, so you may end up with at least\r\na hundred or more maggots in a shuck.\r\n\r\n(Next slide.) And the next picture is a photograph of the same English\r\nwalnut taken about six or seven days later, showing the young maggots\r\nthat have just hatched out. What they will do, they will begin boring\r\nin, and they will just radiate out in all directions into the shuck.\r\nWhen they have gotten that far along, of course, there is no hope for\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\n(Next slide.) This slide is one taken when the maggots were almost\r\nmature, showing the type of damage that you get.\r\n\r\n(Next slide.) This is the resting stage, or the pupa, the one which\r\nspends the winter in the soil and from which the flies emerge in New\r\nYork, at least in our section, beginning about July 15th and going\r\nthrough up until August 15th.\r\n\r\n(Next slide.) The one at the top is normal fruit. I mentioned a while\r\nago that this butternut curculio causes quite a bit of concern and also\r\nspoke about its being in terminals. If you look carefully you see a very\r\ndefinite hole here in the husk. That is where the adult punctured the\r\nhusk. It may have been a feeding puncture first and later an egg was\r\nlaid inside, and then you get the maggot or the grub of the curculio\r\ndeveloping in there, so that superficially that discoloration looks very\r\nmuch like the walnut husk maggot. But in this case you may not find over\r\none or two maggots in a nut. And the other difference is that these\r\nfruits which are attacked usually fall during July and August, whereas\r\nthe ones that have maggots in, many of them stick right on the trees and\r\ndon't come off at all.\r\n\r\n(Next slide.) I have two or three slides just showing the variations in\r\nthe degree of injury on English walnuts from the point where you'd have\r\nan egg puncture. The puncture was made on the other side of the nut, on\r\ntop here, and this is just the exudate running down around the nut which\r\ndries and becomes black. But these walnuts up above show just a lot of\r\ndark spots where the maggots are beginning to find their way through the\r\nhusk. I have with me some injured nuts similar to those shown on the\r\nscreen if you'd like to see them when I have finished my talk. They will\r\ngive you a little idea what maggot injury looks like.\r\n\r\n(Next slide.) This is the same type of injury on butternut. Maybe you'd\r\nhave one egg puncture and as many as a hundred or 120 maggots inside the\r\nshuck.\r\n\r\n(Next slide.) This is a picture of maggot injury on black walnut. They\r\ndon't seem to like the black walnuts as well as they do the Persian\r\nwalnut and butternut.\r\n\r\n(Next slide.) This is one of the hybrid English walnuts that is located\r\non the grounds at the Geneva Experiment Station. It's quite a large\r\ntree. I don't know the name of it. Maybe you do, George.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. SLATE: It has no name.\r\n\r\nDR. GAMBRELL: It's not very fruitful, anyway, is it? But it is also\r\nsusceptible to injury.\r\n\r\n\r\n(Next slide.) This photograph was made quite a few years ago, and that\r\nexplains some of the lines around it, but at any rate, this pile of nuts\r\nshows the damaged ones that came from one tree, and also the ones that\r\nwere not infested. In other words, about two-thirds of the nuts on that\r\nparticular tree had been infested with maggots.\r\n\r\n(Next slide.) That's a close-up view and is the type of thing I was\r\ntrying to describe to you earlier where the shucks dry up and stick to\r\nthe nut so that you cannot remove them. Those on the left, of course,\r\nwould be absolutely no good for commercial purposes.\r\n\r\n(Next slide.) Now, I suppose you are all interested in this matter of\r\ncontrol. Unfortunately, I must admit that I have not worked on the\r\nwalnut husk maggots very much in the last 15 or 20 years. You may recall\r\nthat we had a severe freeze back in 1933 or 1934, which took out quite a\r\nlot of our Persian walnuts in Western New York, and only the hardier\r\ntrees remained. But prior to that time we had been getting numerous\r\ncomplaints, from growers about injury from walnut husk maggots, and we\r\ndid some work at that time and also worked with the Farm Bureau people\r\nin the counties where walnuts were grown fairly commonly. In many cases\r\nthese Persian walnuts were grown on fruit farms where they also have\r\napples and other fruits. So that in those cases it was not a difficult\r\nproblem to obtain control. We worked out a program whereby, say,\r\nbeginning about July the 20th to the 25th, at which time quite a few of\r\nthe flies would have emerged, if the orchardist, when he was going\r\nthrough with his regular spray operation on his fruit trees, would give\r\nhis walnuts at least two applications at about two weeks intervals, he'd\r\ncease to have a maggot problem. That pretty well solved it, as far as\r\nthey were concerned. But there were also these other plantings where\r\nyou'd have just a few trees, or possibly one tree in a back yard,\r\nsomething of that sort, which is a little bit more difficult to control.\r\n\r\nDr. Glasgow and I found that on cherry maggot in the city, while a\r\nmaterial like lead arsenate is very effective in a commercial orchard,\r\nit's very ineffective for just one little tree in your own back yard,\r\nproviding your neighbors have some trees and they don't spray them. The\r\nreason is very obvious: the flies don't necessarily stay on the same\r\ntree. They visit around from tree to tree, they feed on the surface of\r\nthe leaves or fruit. Therefore, it's possible for them to be over on\r\nsomeone else's unsprayed tree and still come over and lay eggs in the\r\nnuts of a sprayed walnut tree before being killed. So you can see that\r\nsuch activity may create somewhat of a problem.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, the lead arsenate spray of three pounds to a hundred\r\ngallons, with or without fungicides, has given good control in the past.\r\nThat No. 3 combination of lime sulphur and lead arsenate was used west\r\nof Rochester here around Hilton where this grower had a commercial fruit\r\nplanting, but he also had a number of English walnuts. The year prior to\r\nthe time these trees were sprayed he had about 40 per cent of the nuts\r\ninfested, and the year these were sprayed the infestation dropped they\r\ncame down to about one percent. Notice the comment at the foot of the\r\ntable which states that the trees that were not treated the following\r\nyear went back up to 20 per cent of the nuts infested. There were about\r\n20 per cent of the trees that had infestation. Of course, the flies\r\nmoved around enough that the trees became reinfested. It simply brings\r\nout the point that unless you have a pretty good-sized planting, you are\r\ngoing to have to spray pretty thoroughly in order to get control, and\r\nalso, if you only have one or two trees and you have a lot of\r\nsurrounding shrubbery and a lot of trees, it would be very wise to also\r\nspray those, unless they are plums or peaches, which are quite\r\nsusceptible to arsenical injury. But most things would stand the\r\narsenate of lead, and it would be very desirable, wherever you can, to\r\nspray surrounding trees and shrubs close to the walnuts themselves, and\r\nin so doing you would get pretty effective control. It is quite possible\r\nto use this control method and obtain over 80 per cent reduction in\r\ninfestation.\r\n\r\nI am sorry to say I don't have any information on these newer materials,\r\nlike DDT, methoxychlor and parathion. You have probably read about all\r\nof those in the magazines. Some of the men in our department have done\r\nquite a bit of work with these insecticides on the apple maggot in the\r\nHudson Valley and in Western New York and they find, as I mentioned\r\nearlier, while it's possible to obtain control of apple maggot, say,\r\nwith DDT, it requires much more frequent application. In that case, if\r\nany of you are orchardists or follow the apple-growing insect problems\r\nat all, the first application of the walnut maggot spray should go on at\r\nabout the time the last cover spray for the coddling moth goes on for\r\nthe first brood. That sounds a little involved, but from the calendar\r\npoint of view it would be about July 25th in Central or Western New\r\nYork. Normally, with us here the cherries are being harvested by about\r\nJuly 15th, sometimes a little earlier, but at any rate, that's the time\r\nthe flies usually begin to emerge.\r\n\r\nWe have what we call a pre-oviposition period of about two weeks, during\r\nwhich time the flies are not laying any eggs in the shucks and are\r\nmoving around feeding. Of course, that is the time you have to get this\r\nspray material on, before they have punctured the nuts and deposited\r\neggs inside.\r\n\r\nI think, unless there are questions, that's all I have to say.\r\n\r\nA MEMBER: You recommend No. 3 to be used?\r\n\r\nDR. GAMBRELL: Lead arsenate at 3 lbs./100 gallons and 2 gal. of lime\r\nsulphur would be an effective insecticide-fungicide mixture. I have used\r\nboth the wettable sulphur and lime sulphur, as shown here, without any\r\ninjury to foliage. Sometimes, as you know, if it's real hot, like today,\r\nsulphur could cause you a lot of foliage injury. Dr. MacDaniels will\r\ncertainly bear me out on that.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT BEST: Now I think Joe McDaniel has a little idea here he wants\r\nto introduce at this time.\r\n\r\nDR. MACDANIEL: I have been talking with Mr. Devitt. He is interested in\r\nfollowing up these Carpathian trees in Ontario and is willing to act as\r\nour agent in securing seed nuts from some of the better selected trees.\r\nAs I understand it, this Association couldn't properly act as a sales\r\nagency for them, but I believe there are some of the members who would\r\nlike to get these superior seed nuts of Ontario, and I would be willing\r\nto take the names of persons who are interested in them, either for\r\ntheir personal planting or for resale. Mr. Devitt thinks he can secure\r\nthe nuts at about 60 cents a pound from the owners who have these good\r\ntrees and deliver them to the United States at around a dollar a pound.\r\nAnyone who is interested in that, see me or Spencer Chase during the\r\nremainder of the meeting.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPanel Discussion: The Persian Walnut Situation\r\n\r\n_Moderator_: S. B. CHASE; _Panel Members_: H. L. CRANE, GILBERT BECKER,\r\nJ. C. MCDANIEL, H. F. STOKE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMR. CHASE: To introduce the subject, Lynn Tuttle sent a paper, and in\r\naddition he sent a few slides. We won't give the paper, but we are going\r\nto run through a few slides very hurriedly, because he took the trouble\r\nto send them. I am going to read the captions off very quickly. (A\r\nseries of slides of Persian Walnut were shown).\r\n\r\nThe moderator isn't going to do anything other than ask for any\r\nquestions that you folks have on Carpathians at this time. I am going to\r\nask Dr. Crane to comment on this question: Are we going overboard\r\nbuilding up our varieties as we know them now? In other words, we have\r\nselected four or five varieties that won a contest and our judges\r\nselected them as best, and these are the only ones we are hearing about.\r\n\r\nDR. CRANE: Mr. Moderator, I don't believe we are, provided that we\r\nmaintain high standards in the varieties distributed and tested. I feel\r\nthat when we select a variety we should select it because it is a good\r\nnut, not that it's a world beater, for big size and thick, rough, rugged\r\nshell that is not sealed, and which is of no value for human use or\r\nconsumption, excepting for firewood or fuel. Those big nuts won't fill.\r\nThe best nuts are of reasonably large size, well filled with a well\r\nsealed shell and with a kernel that is sweet. Don't figure on selling\r\nnuts that have bitter kernels to anybody else. We have nut varieties of\r\nthe Carpathians that are not going to go over because of the faults that\r\nI have mentioned. I should say, too, that we do not know how widely a\r\nvariety is going to be adapted to different climates. If we select\r\nrigidly for good, outstanding varieties that bear good nuts and good,\r\nvigorous trees, we won't get too many.\r\n\r\nMR. CHASE: That was one point I wanted brought out, that we are now just\r\nin the preliminary stage of this Carpathian variety selection business.\r\nOf the selections made some have been made by default, because there\r\nweren't enough of other samples to compete with. On the other hand, the\r\nseveral we have we all consider outstanding in some respect, or other,\r\nand are of value as a beginning provided we bear in mind that we haven't\r\nscratched the surface on Carpathian walnuts yet.\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: And let's not confine ourselves to Carpathian walnuts,\r\nbecause Hanson is not Carpathian walnut, and that's an excellent nut.\r\n\r\nMR. CHASE: Mr. Stoke, what is going to be NNGA's policy in trying to\r\ngive recommendations for the planting of Carpathian or Persian walnuts?\r\nIn other words, does it make any real difference whether it's a\r\nCarpathian or whether it is not, as long as it has proved hardy and of\r\ngood quality?\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: We are dealing with Persian walnuts, and Carpathian happens\r\nto be one class of Persian, and Broadview happens to be a Persian that\r\ncame from Russia, and Lancaster is one that came from somewhere in\r\nEurope and landed up in Lancaster, Pennsylvania. I would emphasize the\r\nname Persian as the over all name. The Carpathian is merely a Persian\r\nwalnut which has been brought from the Carpathian mountains of Poland.\r\n\r\nMR. BECKER: Last summer a group of nut growers went to Lee Sommers',\r\nwhich is in the central part of Michigan. In the invitation to our nut\r\ngrowers I said, \"This is the only pure Carpathian orchard we know in\r\nMichigan.\" That didn't set well with some of them and they took issue\r\nwith me. In answering this issue, I said that Mr. Sommers had planted\r\nCarpathian Persian walnut seed that came from Poland direct. Many of us\r\nhave a mixture. Even Mr. Shessler has the Hanson and Jacobs and a number\r\nof others. If he sells you seed, you are going to get it mixed. In a few\r\nyears we will have a job keeping pure Carpathian.\r\n\r\nDR. MACDANIELS: Isn't it a matter of straight terminology? _Juglans\r\nRegia_ is the Persian walnut. Carpathians are a regional strain of\r\n_Juglans Regia_.\r\n\r\nMR. CHASE: I think we all understand that.\r\n\r\nMR. MACHOVINA: Can we speak of a Carpathian strain. Crath himself said\r\nthere were many. He even found walnuts growing in clusters like grapes.\r\n\r\nDR. MACDANIELS: It would be a regional group of clones with a certain\r\norigin not a strain in the genetic sense.\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: They are just Persian walnuts that happened to come from the\r\nCarpathian region.\r\n\r\nDR. CRANE: There is a little difference. I believe that in the northern\r\ncountries we have had more or less inbreeding and we could consider them\r\nmore nearly a line, not a strain, because of that. When the original\r\nseed was introduced by Reverend Crath, probably each one of those lots\r\nof nuts come from different trees, as a line, but, now this second\r\ngeneration stuff that's coming along, it's just _Juglans Regia_. It's a\r\nhardy Persian walnut.\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: I think I can offer a word of explanation of those growing in\r\nclusters. I have no doubt that when the barbarians swept over the wall\r\ncenturies ago they brought Asiatic walnuts with them from as far as\r\nManchuria. They grew in clusters there like butternuts and heartnuts. No\r\ndoubt some of them reached Europe, and some of them may have hybridized\r\nwith the Persian, and I think really that's the answer.\r\n\r\nDR. MACDANIELS: The same situation existed with peaches 20 years ago. We\r\nhad five geographical races of peaches that were more or less distinct.\r\nWith the exception of one, the Peento, they have all lost their identity\r\nnow because there has been no attempt to keep them distinct.\r\n\r\nDR. CRANE: That's right.\r\n\r\nMR. CHASE: Then we end up, there is no such thing as a Carpathian, it's\r\njust a name for a hardy walnut that came from a certain region, that\r\ndistinguishes it from others.\r\n\r\nMR. KEPLINGER: In my parents' old home in Eastern Germany in the\r\nBohemian mountains there is an English walnut tree that's 300 years old\r\nand bears a hundred bushels of walnuts a year. They stand 40 below zero\r\nthere, too, and the nut cracks and hulls well. It has a record on\r\nstanding the cold, but there hasn't been any of them brought out here\r\nand planted in this country, but they are there. I know they are there,\r\nbecause they are on our estate.\r\n\r\nDR. CRANE: Mr. Moderator, there is one remark that I want to make. Here\r\nwe are, the Northern Nut Growers Association, and yet we still use the\r\nterm, \"English walnut,\" when we are talking about Carpathian walnut and\r\nPersian walnut. This \"English walnut\" is the worst form of terminology\r\nthat can be used. England doesn't have any walnuts; they have never\r\ngrown any Persian walnuts or English walnuts, they haven't in the past\r\nand they aren't today. They have a few trees but are in the same fix\r\nthat we are in the Northern Nut Growers Association; they are trying to\r\nfind a variety of Persian walnut that they can grow in England, and yet\r\nhere we call them English walnuts. They should be Persian walnuts, or\r\nChinese walnuts. We don't know where they came from. The best\r\nauthorities seem to think that they originated in Persia; others think\r\nthey originated in China, but the abundance of evidence is on Persia.\r\n\r\nWe want to get this thing kind of straight. They are all the same thing,\r\n_Juglans Regia_.\r\n\r\nMR. CLARKE: I'd like to make a suggestion. I don't know as you have any\r\nauthority or power to change, but the term _Juglans Regia_ means \"royal\r\nwalnut.\" Why not work for the adoption of a name like that, and it will\r\ninclude all of them.\r\n\r\nDR. MACDANIEL: That's what they call them in France. This country has a\r\nlittle complication; there is another Royal walnut, one of the hybrids\r\nbetween the California black and the Eastern black.\r\n\r\nDR. GRAVATT:-While we are talking about bringing English walnuts,\r\nPersian walnuts, whatever you want to call them, from Europe, I want to\r\ngive a warning about a disease that is killing thousands of trees in\r\nSouthern France. Just recently I saw quite a few of them in France and\r\nthe edge of Italy. I don't know whether it's virus or what it is, but\r\nit is certainly killing out the English walnuts there at a very rapid\r\nrate, and I advise very strongly against introducing walnut seed, scions\r\nand such, from those areas in France and Switzerland or other areas in\r\nsouthern Europe where this disease is prevalent. We will know more later\r\nabout it, because quite a team of pathologists is working on it in\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nMR. CHASE: Has anybody else got any comments about _Juglans Regia_? I am\r\nafraid to say anything else.\r\n\r\nDR. MACDANIEL: I will say that this Carpathian strain, of _Juglans\r\nRegia_ is the first walnut of the Persian type that we have had for\r\nIllinois. The Pomeroy, other Eastern strains and California varieties\r\nhave not survived very long in the climate of the state of Illinois. We\r\ndo know now that some of the Carpathian seedlings have been fruiting for\r\n10 or 12 years and do show considerable promise there. I don't know\r\nwhether it will ever develop into a commercial industry but they are\r\nworth growing.\r\n\r\nMR. CHASE: Thank you. I'd like to ask George Slate what he knows about\r\nthe Northern Star Persian walnut. Very hardy, and so forth? I think\r\nmaybe the members might be interested in that.\r\n\r\nMR. SLATE: Spencer asked me to find out about the North Star _Juglans\r\nRegia_, which was advertised in the Flower Grower. I called up the local\r\nnursery that was selling them, and they said they got their seeds from\r\nsome Pomeroy trees in the western part of the state. I guess they are\r\njust _Juglans Regia_.\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: Down in Virginia we have Virginia Thin Shell purchased\r\nsometimes one place and sometimes another.\r\n\r\nMR. CHASE: The secretary's office had an inquiry from the executive\r\nsecretary of the American Nurserymen's Association wanting to know if\r\nthose claims could be substantiated. I couldn't say on the basis of what\r\ninformation I had, and I so told him. Apparently they, through their\r\norganization, have stopped further advertising of that strain under the\r\nclaims that they made for it.\r\n\r\nMR. KORN: We find our public at large, not only our members, seem to be\r\nfascinated by the fact that the Persian walnut can be grown in this\r\nlatitude. So in speaking to them about it, when I am speaking to our\r\nmembers, I try to say Persian walnut, but when speaking to the public at\r\nlarge, they don't know what I am talking about so I come out flatly and\r\nsay English walnut. I tell them that we can't expect to grow the\r\nCalifornia type, but we have a hardier type coming from the Carpathian\r\nmountains or Germany or Russia or Holland, that can be grown\r\nsuccessfully in this part of the country.\r\n\r\nMR. CHASE: I think that's the only approach you can use.\r\n\r\nMR. KORN: That's the one I use, and I think it quickly helps people to\r\nunderstand what you are talking about, and doesn't get them confused. If\r\nyou talked to them about Persian walnuts, they wouldn't know what you\r\nwere talking about, but if you say English walnuts, immediately they\r\nunderstand, or should, at least.\r\n\r\nMR. CHASE: I believe Dr. Crane meant that in our inner sanctum he would\r\nprefer _Juglans Regia_.\r\n\r\nDR. CRANE: I would like to ask if there are any growers here who have\r\npropagated the Persian walnut on Eastern black walnut, that is,\r\nexperienced any trouble with graft union failure on them.\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: I haven't.\r\n\r\nDR. MACDANIEL: Mr. Oakes?\r\n\r\nMR. OAKES: I haven't.\r\n\r\nMR. CHASE: No graft union failure on _Regia_ and _Nigra_.\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: And my experience is they come in much quicker than on their\r\nown roots as seedlings.\r\n\r\nDR. CRANE: How old are your oldest grafts?\r\n\r\nMR. OAKES: Put on in 1938?\r\n\r\nDR. CRANE: That's 15 years.\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: I have them at least 20 years.\r\n\r\nMR. BECKER: Mine are twenty.\r\n\r\nDR. MACDANIEL: Mr. Moderator, I have in my brief case a translation of\r\nthe French book on walnut culture, and there is a section on root\r\nstocks. This was a publication issued about 1941, and according to that\r\nbook, _Juglans Nigra_ is the best stock they have for general use in\r\nFrance. They have reported no difficulty on this. A second one they were\r\ntrying of the American walnuts, with some promise, was _Juglans major_,\r\nthe Arizona black walnut.\r\n\r\nDR. CRANE: The reason why I asked, as I reported in previous\r\nmeetings--they are having very serious difficulty in Oregon and in parts\r\nof Washington with graft union trouble which is known as \"black line.\"\r\nAll or practically all of the walnuts in both Oregon and California and\r\nalso what few are grown in Washington have been propagated on the\r\nNorthern California black walnut, _Juglans Hindsii_. No graft union\r\ntrouble evidence shows up before the tree has been grafted about 8\r\nyears, and then such cases are very rare. But after the trees or the\r\ngrafts attain an age of 15 years or more, graft union failures are\r\nnumerous. For three years now we have been making surveys in the State\r\nof Oregon, and we have surveyed tree by tree, year after year, the same\r\norchards, the same trees, and our observations now go into the\r\nthousands, and we find that this black line is a terrifically serious\r\nthing. In some orchards 22 per cent of the trees will develop black line\r\nin one year's time. So, you see, at that rate it would only take you\r\nfive or six years with a good bearing orchard until you wouldn't have\r\nany.\r\n\r\nDR. MACDANIEL: Is that always with the Franquettes?\r\n\r\nDR. CRANE: That is not only true with Franquettes but also with other\r\nvarieties in California, even in Contra Costa County.\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: Where those trees are so grafted, does it tend to overgrow,\r\nor just the opposite?\r\n\r\nDR. CRANE: No, it appears much like our _Crenata-mollissima_ chestnut\r\ngraft union failure.\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: Is there a tendency for the top to be more vigorous, to have\r\nmore growth, or vice versa or is growth uniform?\r\n\r\nDR. CRANE: It may be uniform. Depends somewhat on the varieties and the\r\nseedlings. There may be some overgrowth or some outgrowth, but there is\r\nonly one test for it, and that is at the graft union. With an axe or\r\nknife and you cut out a strip of bark across the union. It may look\r\nabsolutely perfect, but if there is a black line developed there that is\r\njust like a lead pencil line between the stock and the scion, the tree\r\nis on the way out. It's just a matter of time. Ultimately the bark\r\nbetween the stock and scion will split, and you get infolding, just like\r\non the chestnut.\r\n\r\nOne of the reasons that they have propagated their trees on Northern\r\nCalifornia black walnut was that they had the idea that the Northern\r\nCalifornia produced a stronger, more vigorous seedling and that they\r\ngrew much faster than seedlings of the Persian walnut. And, furthermore,\r\nsomebody at some time circulated the idea that Northern California\r\nwalnuts were immune to infection by the mushroom root rot fungus. We\r\nhave surveyed thousands of trees of Persian on Persian roots, and we\r\nhave never found a single case of black line developing or graft union\r\nfailure as long as it's a Persian on Persian, and we find the same\r\npercentage of infection from mushroom root rot fungus on Persian as on\r\nNorthern California black.\r\n\r\nMR. CHASE: In other words, we should watch our stocks and perhaps try\r\nout some _Regia_ on _Regia_?\r\n\r\nDR. CRANE: That's right.\r\n\r\nMR. CHASE: Now, folks, we could talk for a long time, but let me make\r\none request before we close our panel: I would be interested in\r\nreceiving from any member pictures, good, glossy photographs of the\r\nnewer Carpathian varieties so that we can perhaps publish them in the\r\nnewsletter and give some folks an opportunity to see what these nuts\r\nlook like. Some of the folks who never come to a meeting never see a\r\nsample and just read about it. It's much better if we can show them a\r\npicture now and then. So if you have some good pictures, or plan to take\r\nsome good pictures, remember, I'd like to have a copy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTUESDAY EVENING BANQUET SESSION\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT BEST: We will now hear from the Resolutions Committee, Mr.\r\nDavidson.\r\n\r\nMR. DAVIDSON: Before reading any resolutions, I have been asked to read\r\na letter that came to Mr. Chase dated August 16th of this year, from Dr.\r\nW. C. Deming:\r\n\r\n     \"Mr. Spencer B. Chase, Secretary, NNGA.\r\n\r\n     \"My Dear Child and Grandchildren:\" What a beautiful greeting, that.\r\n\r\n     \"This is to let you know that your father and grandfather still\r\n     holds a house at this hospital and rejoices in your vitality and in\r\n     your coming convention but especially in the energy and ability of\r\n     your secretary who gets out those wonderful Nutshell letters which\r\n     are so stimulating to all nut growers.\r\n\r\n     \"More than 20 years ago I planted an Italian chestnut tree on the\r\n     grounds of this hospital. The main trunk was killed by blight, but\r\n     many shoots have come and now it appears to be flourishing because\r\n     there are no other chestnut trees near. About that time I grafted\r\n     nut trees commercially in Westchester County, New York at the\r\n     Westchester Country Club, asking and getting $50 a day for my\r\n     services and material and never a kick. But I have forgotten the\r\n     results and the name of the beneficiaries. From my home in\r\n     Litchfield, Connecticut, my sister, aged 85, saved for me--that is,\r\n     saved from the squirrels--a double handful of nice chestnuts--no\r\n     other chestnut tree nearby--and three green walnuts, Carpathians.\r\n     Both were from my grafts.\r\n\r\n     \"I shall never forget the NNGA and your splendid services. Ever\r\n     faithfully devoted, Dr. W. C. Deming.\"\r\n\r\nA beautiful letter.\r\n\r\nNow, then, the Resolutions Committee recommends that we send this\r\nletter;\r\n\r\n     \"Dear Dr. Deming:\r\n\r\n     \"Once more we are happy to greet you and to wish you well. Today\r\n     the representatives of more than a thousand members of your thought\r\n     child, the Northern Nut Growers Association, are here gathered in\r\n     Rochester, New York, to carry on the work in which you had so large\r\n     a part in starting. It must be a source of great satisfaction to\r\n     you to be able to see so important a project which you helped to\r\n     start continuing and expanding fruitfully. We envy you.\r\n\r\n     \"May your tribe increase. Affectionately, the Northern Nut Growers\r\n     Association.\"\r\n\r\nNow, shall I go on with the rest of the resolutions, and perhaps you can\r\nact on them all at once.\r\n\r\n     \"_Be it Resolved_: That we hereby acknowledge our longstanding\r\n     indebtedness to the men of the United States Department of\r\n     Agriculture and of similar departments of the various states who\r\n     have so faithfully and efficiently upheld the work of this\r\n     Association. Without their loyal help, doubtless our efforts would\r\n     languish or suffer severely. It is such a spirit as theirs that\r\n     continues to make America the great pioneer it has always been.\"\r\n\r\n     \"_Be it Resolved_: That the members of this Association acknowledge\r\n     with deep appreciation the outstanding' hospitality of the City of\r\n     Rochester at the hands of its representative Park Commissioner\r\n     Wilbur Wright, Dr. Roy B. Anthony, Mr. Harkness, and their helpers\r\n     who have done so much to make the visit of this organization not\r\n     only welcome but extremely enjoyable and informative. We shall\r\n     always remember Rochester's exceptional hospitality and its\r\n     generously free provision of so beautiful a meeting place. This is\r\n     sincerely appreciated.\"\r\n\r\n     \"_Be it Resolved_: That this Association extends to Mr. George\r\n     Salzer, Mr. Victor Brook its thanks for their work which has\r\n     resulted in so pleasant and profitable a meeting here in Rochester;\r\n     also to many others due our thanks, to Dr. McKay for organizing a\r\n     splendid program, to Mrs. Negus for organizing the registration, to\r\n     Mrs. Gibbs and finally to our outstandingly efficient officers who\r\n     have so skillfully organized our work and the Association's\r\n     expansion.\"\r\n\r\n     \"In order to correct a tendency toward increasing confusion arising\r\n     from the too great multiplicity of names and nut varieties, the\r\n     Resolutions Committee offers the following motion: We move that the\r\n     President be authorized to appoint a self-perpetuating Northern Nut\r\n     Growers Association Committee on Variety Nomenclature, and we\r\n     recommend to our members that they refer to this committee for its\r\n     official approval any new nut discoveries they may wish to name\r\n     and to propagate.\" That is in the form of a motion, which, I\r\n     believe, requires a second and some action.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT BEST: I think we had better act first on this motion of Mr.\r\nDavidson's about this committee for naming of nuts, and then we can have\r\nanother motion to accept the resolutions. Is there a second to that\r\nmotion that we have a committee on nomenclature of nuts?\r\n\r\nDR. MACDANIEL: Mr. President, I second that motion.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT BEST: Is there any discussion?\r\n\r\nDR. CRANE: I wanted to suggest that the motion should provide that the\r\ncommittee use the rules of nomenclature approved by the American\r\nPomological Society.\r\n\r\nDR. MACDANIEL: I will accept that amendment, Mr. President.\r\n\r\n(A vote was taken on the amendment, and was passed.)\r\n\r\nMR. MACHOVINA: Is that a proposal to amend the by-laws of this\r\norganization? It would, if it's a self-perpetuating committee.\r\n\r\nMR. DAVIDSON: May I suggest you withdraw the word \"self-perpetuating.\"\r\nThe idea, Mr. Best, was to make this a permanent committee, if possible.\r\nThat was the reason for putting that word in there, but if it is an\r\nabridgment of the constitution, we don't want to do it, of course.\r\n\r\nMR. KINTZEL: I'd like to know what the rules of nomenclature of the\r\nAmerican Pomological Society are.\r\n\r\nDR. MACDANIEL: The rules cover about two pages. I can give you the gist\r\nof it, I think. One provision is that the discoverer or introducer of a\r\nnew variety has the privilege of selecting a name for it. Another rule\r\nis that it shall not duplicate a name given previously for a variety of\r\nthe same class of fruit or nut. The name should preferably be one word\r\nor, at most, two words, without hyphens, without possessives. That a nut\r\nnot be named for a person without his permission during his lifetime.\r\nThat covers the meat of it.\r\n\r\nMR. CHASE: Such a committee would give official status and recognition\r\nto your discovery. I believe it would prevent, on a large scale, such\r\nthings as this Morning Star hardy English walnut. In other words, we'd\r\nhave a committee to examine a nut sample from your tree, anybody's tree,\r\npass on it and see that the name that you select meets the requirements\r\nof this American Pomological Society's rules of nomenclature, which are\r\nquite reasonable. I think it is an excellent step that we should take at\r\nthis time.\r\n\r\nMR. CALDWELL: Mr. President. The variety we are using is not a variety,\r\nit's a clone. Maybe we had better get together with taxonomists and\r\nbotanists. That's all they are, selections, they are not varieties, in\r\nthe botanical sense, even though the term has been badly misused by the\r\nnut growers. I don't see why we should continue with mis-application of\r\na term just because somebody set up rules for application of names.\r\n\r\nDR. CRANE: Mr. President, I want to get this straight. This Association\r\nis talking about horticultural varieties, not botanical varieties. A\r\ncorrect term for a horticultural variety is a clone.\r\n\r\nThe American Pomological Society is over a hundred years old, and they\r\nhave followed all types of experiences and usages, and they are up to\r\ndate, and we can't follow any better pattern than what the American\r\nPomological Society has done all down through the years. The Northern\r\nNut Growers Association would be the laughing stock of the world who are\r\nin the know if they don't adopt the rules of nomenclature as set forth\r\nby the American Pomological Society.\r\n\r\nMR. SLATE: Mr. President, we already have a committee on Varieties and\r\nStandards. I don't see why that committee can't be revived. If we set up\r\nanother committee by resolution, we are duplicating the work of that\r\ncommittee, or overlapping. I'd like to see this matter referred to the\r\nCommittee on Varieties or Judging Standards and possibly report another\r\nyear. I am not in favor of setting up this committee at the present\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nI would like to amend that motion to refer this matter to the present\r\nCommittee on Varieties and Judging Standards.\r\n\r\nDR. MCKAY: Second that amendment.\r\n\r\nDR. MACDANIELS: There is one other angle to this. The International\r\nCommittee on Nomenclature of Cultivated Plants, has during the past year\r\npublished a report. I think it would be only wise for us to delay our\r\naction on this matter until our committee at least gets the opportunity\r\nto study the suitability of this international code for nomenclature of\r\ncultivated plants and see how it applies to our situation. In other\r\nwords, I am complete in accord with Mr. Slate's motion.\r\n\r\nMR. DAVIDSON: I would suggest that we refer it to that committee and\r\nthink about it for another year.\r\n\r\n(A vote was taken on the amendment, and it was passed.)\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT BEST: The motion of the Resolutions Committee is now referred\r\nto the Committee on Varieties and Judging Standards.\r\n\r\nMR. STOKE: I move we proceed with the adoption of the resolutions that\r\nwere presented before the motion.\r\n\r\n(Motion seconded and passed.)\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT BEST: We'd like to hear from the Nominating Committee.\r\n\r\nMR. SLATE: For president the Nominating Committee proposed R. B. Best. I\r\nthink he is about one of the best presidents we have ever had. For\r\nvice-president Gilbert Becker of Michigan. For treasurer W. S. Clarke of\r\nPennsylvania, and for secretary, our very efficient and very effective\r\nSpencer Chase of Tennessee.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT BEST: Are there further nominations?\r\n\r\nA MEMBER: I move nominations be closed.\r\n\r\nA MEMBER: Second the motion. (Motion passed.)\r\n\r\nDR. CRANE: Mr. President, I move that the Secretary of the Association\r\nbe instructed to cast a unanimous ballot for the nominations made by the\r\nNominating Committee. Seconded and passed.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT BEST: Is there any further business to come before the group?\r\nSpencer Chase here has an item.\r\n\r\nMR. CHASE: Now, for the feature of the evening, that honor which is\r\nbestowed upon the most deserving member of the organization, I will call\r\non Mr. Wilkinson for the comments about the Big Nut. Mr. Wilkinson.\r\n\r\nMR. WILKINSON: Four years ago at Beltsville, Maryland, Dr. Crane made a\r\nsuggestion that someone ought to be the King Nut of the Association. If\r\nI remember, Mr. Stoke immediately took the floor and nominated Dr.\r\nCrane, and he was unanimously elected the Big Nut. One year later he\r\nbestowed that honor on Spencer B. Chase. The next year Mr. Chase passed\r\nit on to Dr. Colby. One year ago Dr. Colby passed it on to me. Now it's\r\nmy duty to pass this on to someone else tonight.\r\n\r\nWell, I didn't know just exactly how to do it, so I fell back on my\r\nfriend, Mrs. Negus for her suggestion. She suggested that the King Nut\r\nshould wear a crown, so I said, \"Now, that's your suggestion; I will\r\nleave it up to you.\" So here is the crown she made, with an ornament\r\nfrom the Chief pecan, which in my opinion today is the king nut of the\r\nNorthern Nut Growers Association.\r\n\r\nI don't know whose head she measured to make the crown, she didn't tell\r\nme, but it looks to me like it would just about fit George Salzer.\r\n(Applause.) George, it's a pleasure that I pass that on to you as I\r\nreceived it, and I hope you will wear it for a year or longer (putting\r\ncrown on Mr. Salzer's head).\r\n\r\nMR. SALZER: Well, they can't say I am big-headed. Why, honestly, folks,\r\nmy very good friends of the Association, honestly, I don't know what to\r\nsay. This is the greatest honor that I ever thought would come to me. I\r\nalways refer to myself as one of the buck privates in the rear rank, and\r\nhere I am the King Nut. I will assure you, every one of you that I\r\nreally appreciate this, I honestly do, right from the bottom of my\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nEver since I have been a member of this organization and attended the\r\nmeetings, I have had the finest times, most pleasant associations and\r\nthe closest friends I ever had in my entire life right here among you\r\npeople. Thanks a million.\r\n\r\nMR. CHASE: Now I think we are entitled to a few words from our new and\r\nbest president, Mr. Best.\r\n\r\nPRESIDENT BEST: Ladies and gentlemen, it is quite a responsibility to\r\ntake this job on again. It's the first time that I have ever questioned\r\nyour judgment about anything, but I think there are other people here\r\nthat could have done the job better than I could.\r\n\r\nWhen I was asked if I would accept if I were elected, I turned to my\r\nwife, and I said, \"Are you willing to do the work again for another\r\nyear?\" and she said, \"Yes, I suppose I'll have to.\" And I said, \"Well,\r\nthen, I will accept.\" There is a lot more truth in that than there is\r\npoetry. Honestly, we just don't give these officers that work for us\r\nenough recognition. There is a whole page of them, as you know, about 11\r\ncommittees, and all those folks have all done a fine job, at the expense\r\nof their work at home. I am not talking about myself, because I don't do\r\nany of it, I have it done, as I explained. But Carl Prell made a great\r\nsacrifice when he handled the Northern Nut Growers business in a very,\r\nvery fine, thorough, business-like way.\r\n\r\nI ought to give you a good example of what salesmanship really means and\r\nhow it operates. This morning Carl was going down to the museum in a\r\ntaxi. The taxi man professed an interest in nuts. Well, what did Carl\r\ndo? Did he say, \"Well, that's all right, but I can't get into that?\" No,\r\nhe said, \"Man, you ought to belong to the Nut Growers Association. The\r\nfact that you don't know anything about it, that's nothing. Come right\r\ninto the museum here, and I will show you the exhibits,\" and he took the\r\ntaxi man in, and I don't know whether he sold him a membership, but he\r\npassed him on to the next man. He's got him going out to see\r\nIrondequoit, and we, are going to get a sale there. That's the spirit\r\nthat it's going to take to get this job done.\r\n\r\nI am reminded of a little story in Kipling. You know the story about the\r\nsergeant in India. He was a sergeant in the cavalry. They had been out\r\nin the hills, and the weather was hot, and they had an awful, awful\r\ntime. Well, when the men came in and lined up, this sergeant got off his\r\nhorse and he said, \"Well, boys, I realize it's been hot, I know you\r\nsweat. But,\" he said, \"from here on in this campaign we are not going to\r\nsweat, we are going to lather.\" That's what it's going to take to get\r\nthis 2,000 members that we have set for our goal. It's going to take a\r\nlot of hard work, and our job is not to peer into the dim future, but to\r\nattack those problems which are right with us every day and ask some of\r\nour friends to join the Nut Growers Association. We are all widely\r\nseparated in different walks of life, and each in his own world is just\r\napt to see things a whole lot like the goldfish in a bowl. That is, he\r\nwill see it twisted and distorted. So when all is said and done, it's up\r\nto us to support these committee heads and help get this job done.\r\n\r\nA preacher had in his congregation an old lady who was ill. On one of\r\nhis visits to her she appeared to be growing weaker all the time, and\r\nfearing the worst he said as he left her, \"Well, sister, I suppose that\r\nwe will meet Up There.\" And she looked at him and she said,\r\n\r\n\"Well, Parson, it's up to you.\" So from here on out now it's up to you.\r\nThank you. (Applause.)\r\n\r\nMR. CHASE: Now I think we ought to have just a brief word from Gilbert\r\nBecker, our new vice-president. Mr. Becker.\r\n\r\nMR. BECKER: This was really a great surprise to me. It is humbly I tell\r\nyou this, because I was on the Nominating Committee myself, and that is\r\na very embarrassing position to be in, to find that I, as a member of\r\nNominating Committee, appear as an officer. But it was a pleasant\r\nsurprise, and in doing vice-president work I shall try my best, and I\r\nshall surely spend much time and much thought to it. Thank you.\r\n(Applause.)\r\n\r\nMR. CHASE: Now, Bill Clark, will you come up here for a few words? Bill\r\nwill succeed Carl Prell as Treasurer and handle your finances during the\r\ncoming year.\r\n\r\nMR. CLARK: Friends, I thank you for this honor and that you should have\r\nenough confidence in me to trust me with your funds for the coming year.\r\nI will do the best I can, and thank you very much.\r\n\r\nMR. CHASE: There will be a joint meeting of the new officers and old\r\nofficers immediately after we adjourn.\r\n\r\nGeorge Salzer says the last time we met in Rochester was 1922, and we\r\nfigure the next time we will be here is 1984.\r\n\r\n(Whereupon, the meeting was adjourned.)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWalnuts in Lubec, Maine\r\n\r\nRADCLIFFE B. PIKE, _University of New Hampshire, Durham, N. H._\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the 1930's, when the Wisconsin Horticultural Society distributed\r\nseeds of the Carpathian Walnut from Poland, my brother secured some and\r\nwe planted them. From these nuts we now have four trees, one of which\r\nhas been bearing for the last four years.\r\n\r\nLubec, Maine is located at the extreme eastern tip of the United States\r\njust a few miles south of the 45th parallel. The site where the trees\r\nare planted is on a peninsula extending out into the Bay of Fundy which\r\ngives very low summer temperatures and moderate winter temperatures. The\r\nnight temperature in the summer is usually in the 50 deg.s F. with day\r\ntemperatures rarely reaching 80 deg. F. Winter temperatures seldom go to\r\n-10 deg. F. and only lower than this about once in ten years. During the\r\nearly summer, fogs are usually heavy and continuous. Day length is, of\r\ncourse, longer in the summer than in most of the United States but it is\r\nsimilar to that of the Northern tier of States from the Great Lakes\r\nWest.\r\n\r\nThe trees have grown well being about 18 feet tall and even more in\r\nspread. They are multiple trunked having never been pruned. The foliage\r\nis remarkably clean and glossy and has not been bothered by insects or\r\ndisease and it ripens and turns yellow in the late fall before killing\r\nfrosts at the end of October. Excessive late terminal growth is usually\r\nwinter-killed but this sort of growth has not been as great since\r\nbearing started. The staminate flower buds are more likely to be winter\r\nkilled than the pistillate but the whole of them have never been\r\nentirely killed.\r\n\r\nThe trees do not leaf out until mid-June, after the danger of killing\r\nfrosts is over. They have not been frost injured at any time in the\r\nspring. The nuts ripen and are shed from the husks in late September and\r\nearly October while the tree is in full foliage. The nuts are shed\r\nperfectly clean with husk either falling separately or remaining on the\r\ntree. The nuts will germinate and seedlings have been raised. In 1953,\r\none tree bore 315 nuts. This number represents just a fraction of the\r\npistillate bloom, for while this tree is self fertile, the catkins bloom\r\nfor a much shorter period than the pistillate blossoms, the latter\r\nextending over nearly a month.\r\n\r\nIn the same year that the above Carpathian variety of _Juglans regia_\r\nwas planted, my brother and I also planted some _Juglans mandshurica_\r\nsecured from F. L. Skinner of Dropmore, Manitoba which had originated in\r\nHarbin, Manchuria. The resulting trees agree well with many of the\r\nspecimens in the Herbarium of the Arnold Arboretum at Boston labelled\r\n_Juglans mandshurica_. These trees have done remarkably well in Lubec,\r\nthe trunks being 8-9 inches in diameter, while the height is 15 feet or\r\nmore and the spread 20 feet. They have borne annually since 1939. They\r\nare planted less than 1000 feet from the ocean exposed to the summer\r\nstorms, winter gales and salt spray. These trees leaf-out a month\r\nearlier than the Carpathians yet the foliage has only been partially\r\nfrost injured once. Wind whipping sometimes injures the leaves in early\r\nsummer while they are still tender but this sort of injury has never\r\nbeen serious.\r\n\r\nThe nuts are borne in clusters of up to six and the shells are hard and\r\nthick. The flavor of the kernels is excellent having more character than\r\nthe butternut yet not as strong as the black walnut. Cracking is easy\r\nwith the Hershey nut cracker. The kernels resemble our American\r\nbutternut in shape which may account for the fact that _J. mandshurica_\r\nis sometimes called the Oriental butternut.\r\n\r\nThe nuts germinate well and make trees quickly. In one case, I had\r\nmature nuts five years after planting the seed. This particular tree was\r\nunusually vigorous having leaves 36 inches long and 23 inches wide.\r\n\r\nIn my experience, _J. regia_ and _J. mandshurica_ do not hybridize\r\neasily if at all, at least with the individuals and under the conditions\r\nwith which I have been working. After several attempts I now have two\r\nprogenies of reciprocal crosses of which a few seedlings seem to show\r\nhybridity in the vegetative parts. However, there is such a range of\r\ncharacters in the herbarium specimens labelled _J. mandshurica_ that\r\nthere will be a doubt in my mind until I see the mature trees, or it may\r\nbe possible that some of the herbarium specimens may have been collected\r\nfrom naturally occurring hybrids, as the two species overlap in their\r\ndistribution in Manchuria. If the best vegetative and fruiting\r\ncharacters from these two species can be combined the result should be\r\ngood for our northern sections.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nMy Thirty Years Experience With Nut Trees\r\n\r\nCARL WESCHCKE, _St. Paul, Minn._\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom time to time I have submitted articles for our annual report, as\r\nwell as other publications, which had to do more or less specifically\r\nwith certain species of nut trees, but since there are so many species,\r\nand since most nut growers are interested in at least two or more, it\r\nmight be well to bring the story up to date of how a nut orchard might\r\nbe viewed or evaluated after twenty years.\r\n\r\nThirty years ago we did not have knowledge which has been gained by the\r\nexperimenters in the nut growing industry in the interim. Therefore no\r\none could foresee what the future would be. We hopeful ones of that era\r\nplanted trees and experimented with seeds from all over the world\r\nbecause we thought nut trees deserved a place not only in the orchard\r\nbut in the dietary needs of the human being as well. Many of the wisest\r\nand most respected experimenters of this era have passed beyond this\r\nlife; however, their lives were made much more interesting because of\r\ntheir horticultural activities.\r\n\r\nHere in the midwest in the 45th parallel we have established probably\r\nwhat would be considered the practical northern limits of nut tree\r\ncultivation. When I purchased trees it was by the hundreds, and\r\nsometimes thousands, because I knew from reading Luther Burbank's works\r\nthat this work had to be done on a rather large scale in order to make\r\nany kind of an adequate test.\r\n\r\nLet us start by taking the most obvious species, the black walnut,\r\nwhich, because of its native hardiness, and public popularity might have\r\nsucceeded the best in a commercial way if everything had gone right. I\r\nhave planted at least five hundred black walnut trees altogether; these\r\nincluded the Thomas, Ohio, Ten Eyck and Stabler, and later on the\r\nPatterson, Rohwer, Pearl, the Throp, Adams and others were added. The\r\nOhio probably produced the first nuts, with the Thomas a close second.\r\nFor a few years I was able to make good reports on the Stabler and its\r\nbehavior but since that, our severe test winters of recent years have\r\nwiped them out and have substantially proved that the only one of the\r\nolder varieties which can be trusted in this territory is the Ohio, and\r\nalthough derogatory things have been said of the Ohio because of its\r\nhull, I am inclined to put it high on the list because of its fine\r\ncracking quality and excellent flavor, also it has been a prolific\r\nvariety, bearing good crops most of the years.\r\n\r\nThe Thomas grew faster, and the nuts were considered a better commercial\r\nproduct when hulled, but, alas, it could not take our winters nearly so\r\nwell, and today the Thomas has a poor physical appearance although it\r\nshows tremendous power of recovery and seldom a tree will die entirely.\r\n\r\nThe Ten Eyck was a negligible experiment, and the Stabler as mentioned\r\nbefore, is much too tender for this climate. The Rohwer and the\r\nPatterson from Iowa did much better and even in an off year, like this\r\none, some of these trees had fairly good crops. I like the Patterson the\r\nbest of these--it is a roundish nut that cracks quite well and the\r\nkernels are on the sweet side.\r\n\r\nThe Throp was a curiosity and we did not have any of our grafted Throp\r\ntrees bear.\r\n\r\nPearl has borne several crops of good nuts; they are large but are\r\ninclined not to ripen in time.\r\n\r\nVandersloot was considered the largest nut of any variety at one time.\r\nIt has a very rough appearance but aside from its size it is of no\r\nparticular interest as compared to others.\r\n\r\nAdams, a long narrow type of nut similar to the Ohio, but still more\r\nelongated, was one of the best crackers I have ever seen, but did not\r\nseem to be prolific although it has lived and demonstrated its\r\nhardiness.\r\n\r\nI am patenting a new walnut at this time which I consider the best for\r\nour locality. Some day it may produce well in orchard form if trees\r\nbecome available. One thing is certain about it--it is very hardy and is\r\nreasonably easy to propagate.\r\n\r\nAnd so we can conclude the walnut chapter by saying that at least we\r\nhave some giants in the orchard to show for our trouble and expense,\r\nwhich bear nice edible walnuts in favorable seasons. When comparing this\r\nwith the wild butternut crop from butternuts in the adjacent woods,\r\nwhich has consistently failed each year for the last ten years, it is\r\nquite encouraging.\r\n\r\nIt was my hard luck to have an uncongenial soil for my experiments in\r\nchestnuts, and the knowledge of this came so late that I thought the\r\nchestnut was not meant to succeed in our territory. So I put my efforts\r\non hickory nuts and filberts. Both of these succeeded to a degree and\r\nwith my present knowledge and experience on hickory nuts I would not be\r\na bit afraid to start an orchard on good deep clay or other\r\nsatisfactory soil which hickories like, using grafted trees of\r\nBridgewater and Weschcke.\r\n\r\nA few Kirtland and Deveaux No. 2 would be planted for extra pollination\r\nand the extra variety in nuts. There are of course many other varieties\r\nof hickories that have succeeded in this territory but those above\r\nmentioned, have possibilities of commercial success in orchard\r\nformation.\r\n\r\nThe hickory is a difficult tree to transplant and I would advise that\r\ngrafted trees be dug with a ball of dirt for shipping, similar to an\r\nevergreen, as I have found that, with the greatest of care and\r\nexperience, the hickory is very slow to re-establish itself unless\r\nhandled that way.\r\n\r\nThe hybrid hazels are perhaps the hardiest and certainly bear the\r\nearliest of any of the nut trees. My own hybrids show great\r\npossibilities for commercial enterprise, but as yet no nurserymen are\r\ncarrying these varieties and I have not found help enough to promote\r\nthem myself.\r\n\r\nI am convinced that had I spent as much time with the chestnuts on\r\nfavorable soil as I did with hickories that they would probably head the\r\nlist of successful nut trees growing. Recently I have purchased an\r\nadjoining piece of property which has the necessary well-drained, sandy\r\nor gravelly soil, which chestnuts seem to like, and I have started my\r\nchestnut orchard there along with a sprinkling of hickory and walnut\r\ntrees, merely as a matter of test.\r\n\r\nThis year the chestnuts are again putting on a fair crop for the number\r\nand the size of the trees involved. As yet, in order to get a reasonable\r\nnumber of nuts for planting, I have to cross-pollinize them by hand, and\r\nI was surprised and pleased this year to find one Chinese chestnut tree\r\nwith staminate bloom, allowing me to make a cross pollinization with an\r\nAmerican sweet chestnut and a Chinquapin type chestnut, which grows to\r\nbe a tall tree. These crosses ought to insure trees with a great degree\r\nof hardiness, and should the blight ever strike this territory in the\r\nfuture they should be highly resistant as well. A few of my chestnut\r\ntrees produce nuts that may be the size of the best Chinese chestnuts,\r\nbut I am just as fond of the smaller and sweeter chestnuts of the\r\nseveral Chinquapin type trees which seem to be consistent bearers and\r\ncertainly are prolific. There are three trees in a close group which are\r\nstrains of the European chestnut combined with American chestnut. These\r\nbear rather large nuts and usually every year have a few and of high\r\nquality. It is conceivable that by crossing this hybrid with Chinese\r\npollen that something unusual could be produced.\r\n\r\nThe pure Chinese strain has not proved hardy in this territory and I\r\nhave never matured a pure variety. However, there are dozens of\r\nseedlings that are not old enough to prove whether there might be a\r\nhardy specimen among them that may at some time in the future be relied\r\nupon for this species of chestnut.\r\n\r\nOne other species of nut requires a little space here since it has shown\r\nthat it can bear crops and is hardy enough to be included among the\r\nhardy nuts. It is the Gellatly heartnut. It is very subject to the\r\nbutternut curculio, but in spite of that it continues to grow quite well\r\nwhen grafted on black walnut,--a difficult piece of propagation,\r\nhowever. A tree in St. Paul, on the boulevard, thrives next to a large\r\nbutternut, and bears nuts practically every year which the squirrels\r\ndelight in cutting down while still green. This tree is not bothered by\r\nthe curculio since the curculio does not infest the large butternut near\r\nit.\r\n\r\nIn summing up the whole situation, I would say that my experiments over\r\nthirty years quite adequately prove that the walnuts, hickories, hybrid\r\nhazels and chestnuts can most certainly be set out in orchard form and\r\nin favorable locations. However, pecan, hiccan, English walnuts and\r\nalmonds have not proved hardy enough to indicate that they can be relied\r\nupon for steady crops of nuts although in some instances varieties show\r\na great hardiness such as the Rockville hiccan. Of course the native\r\nbutternut is perfectly hardy and prolific but until such time as the\r\nbutternut curculio ceases to be a major pest we cannot expect to have\r\ngood crops of them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGrowing American Chestnuts and Their Hybrids Under Blight Conditions\r\n\r\nALFRED SZEGO, _Jackson Heights, N. Y._\r\n\r\n\r\nAn interesting group of young American chestnut trees growing on my land\r\nnear Pine Plains, N. Y. has been under observation since 1946. As they\r\nare growing closely together which suggests a common parental origin, we\r\nhave named this group the \"Dutchess Clone\" for reference purposes. This\r\nname was chosen merely because Pine Plains is situated in Dutchess\r\nCounty.\r\n\r\nTheir reaction to the deadly chestnut blight was studied at great length\r\nand at different seasons. Sometimes branches were inoculated with the\r\nfungus to test resistance more precisely. It was learned that blight\r\nresistance, in this group of trees, was at an apparently low ebb from\r\nMarch until May. After this period the fungus seemed to make almost no\r\nprogress at all. This might suggest that the resistant substance was\r\nmanufactured by the leaves. Of course, such conclusions cannot be\r\naccepted in a scientific sense without an involved system of checks and\r\nmeasurements.\r\n\r\nPollination problems are exactly the same as with our Chinese Chestnuts\r\nthat we are more familiar with today. Unlike the latter, in the\r\nAmerican, species the bloom is concentrated near the top of the tree.\r\n\r\nThe burs are so high up as to create difficulties if we intend to\r\nanticipate nature and harvest our crop prematurely. The burs open during\r\nthe month of October with or without frost. High temperatures in 1953\r\ndid not interfere with the harvest. The best method of harvesting is to\r\nuse a long slender pole with a metal hook at the extreme end, and by\r\ngently pulling and twisting, remove the burs from the tree.\r\n\r\nUnless this is done promptly before the nuts fall, the rodents will get\r\nalmost every nut.\r\n\r\nTree growth is about 2 to 3 feet per year in height. At present some are\r\nnearly 40 feet tall. Bearing starts at about 12 years of age. The nuts,\r\nthree in a bur are somewhat wedge shaped and average 5/8 of an inch in\r\ndiameter. One tree has nuts almost an inch in diameter. This is\r\ndefinitely worth propagating and I will gladly furnish scions in the\r\nspring free to anyone who is interested. These are probably\r\nincompatible with Chinese understocks, but may be grafted on European\r\nand some Japanese seedlings.\r\n\r\nAs we are listed as cooperators with the U.S.D.A., Division of Forest\r\nPathology, Beltsville, Md., we prepare semi-annual reports for Dr.\r\nFrederick H. Berry and also send a portion of our American chestnut seed\r\nto him. In this way we insure the continuation of the \"Dutchess\" clone\r\nafter our lifetimes.\r\n\r\nThe American chestnut is not as sweet as Chinese chestnut but is much\r\nfiner in texture and richer in subtle pleasing flavor. We would say that\r\nthe quality is higher. _Castanea dentata_ has the most uniformly\r\ndelicious nuts. It is excelled, however, by many individuals of _C.\r\npumila_. In our opinion these possess the highest quality nuts in the\r\nentire genus.\r\n\r\nOur American chestnuts hybrids, especially those with _C. Sequinii_, are\r\nvery interesting. The latter make a dwarf tree that bears incredible\r\namounts of small chestnuts. They have pollination problems to be solved\r\nand the nuts are seldom filled. Pollen sterility is a common feature\r\nwith them. They are also everbearing.\r\n\r\nSome Northern strains of Chinese chestnut seem barely hardy but promise\r\nto survive. Of the grafted varieties we have, Abundance is the most\r\nvigorous. \"Nanking\" has winter-killed here and it has been replanted\r\nthis year. These are very blight resistant, and rarely lose a branch to\r\nthis disease after winter injury. The Japanese behave in much the same\r\nway.\r\n\r\nWe have many obscure chestnut species and hybrids growing here. They are\r\ngrown for study, hybridizing purposes, and as a source of supply to\r\ninterested members. When mature, we hope to obtain some cash crops from\r\nour Chinese and Japanese Chestnut trees. Blight in Europe will no doubt,\r\nin about 5 years more, reduce imports of chestnuts thus creating higher\r\nprices and a more favorable market.\r\n\r\nChinese chestnuts do not keep well when stored using standard commercial\r\npractices. European chestnuts are shipped in barrels and kept in open\r\nfruit boxes for weeks at a time in front of fruit and vegetable stores\r\nin New York City. Storekeepers never moisten these believing that rot\r\nwould result. These are viable even in January and sometimes as late as\r\nMarch. Will our present Chinese chestnuts keep as well under these\r\nconditions? We think not. American Chestnuts can be kept in bulk only.\r\n\r\nWe are continually striving to obtain by selection and subsequent\r\nhybridization, the best chestnuts that can be grown in our severe\r\nclimate. The Chinese chestnut has performed miracles in the Southeast,\r\nbut we regret that it is not the answer to our problems. Only a long\r\nperiod of seed selection will turn up better trees of this species.\r\n\r\nProlonged heat and drought caused us much concern this year. Some one\r\nyear old seedlings died outright but older trees only suffered varying\r\ndegrees of defoliation. In some areas, the subsoil was reported powder\r\ndry to a depth of six feet. Even the native forest trees dropped much\r\nfoliage and went into premature dormancy. Oddly enough, the American and\r\nJapanese chestnuts suffered much less defoliation than the common\r\nAllegheny chinkapin, _C. pumila_. _C. henryi_, a rare species, a native\r\nof China, and the several chinkapins native to the Gulf Coast seemed\r\ninherently adjusted to drought and heat, and thrived without apparent\r\ndamage. The Ozark tree chinkapins did well also.\r\n\r\nHybrid hazels and choice native seedlings have been set out here in the\r\nlast few years. We are adding a few every year and planting them between\r\nchestnuts to prevent the latter from forming extensive root grafts. This\r\nis done in anticipation of oak wilt, which has not yet made its\r\nappearance here.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nExperiences and Observations on Nut Growing in Central Texas\r\n\r\nKAUFMAN FLORIDA, _Rotan, Texas_\r\n\r\n\r\nIn view of my membership in the Association for some twelve or fourteen\r\nyears it would be quite reasonable to expect of me more observations in\r\nconnection with nut growing in my area than I'm able to make. Though\r\nI've followed the proceedings of NNGA with great interest, the\r\ndifficulty of earning a living (from farming) and putting a little\r\nsomething aside has caused me to neglect and put off from year to year\r\nthe planting of the kind of experimental orchard I've long hoped for. I\r\nhave lately acquired a reasonably well situated plot of land and,\r\nbarring a continuation of the drouth of the past two or three years,\r\nplan to put out a few young trees next year.\r\n\r\nMy original interest in nut trees sprang from the hope that a tree\r\ncombining beauty, utility and long-life might be found to replace the\r\nChinese elm--a \"weed tree\" if there ever was one. In spite of many\r\nshortcomings the Chinese elm (along with two or three other equally\r\nundesirable trees) is to be found in most homestead plantings in my\r\narea.\r\n\r\nHere, in my locality of north-west central Texas, the total rainfall\r\nranges from a low of about twelve inches in some years to a high of\r\nabout forty-two inches in others, and the annual average is about\r\ntwenty-one inches. Our principal limiting conditions in nut tree growing\r\nis want of sufficient rainfall, though late spring frosts following a\r\nperiod of balmy weather would be a hazard in some instances. It appears\r\nto me that if a nut tree planting in this part of the country is to\r\nlive, every drop of water that falls must be conserved; if it is to\r\nthrive, additional water falling on adjacent uplands and carried down in\r\nflash floods must be diverted to it. Terraces and retainer dams are\r\nusually essential. Cultivation and weed control are necessary. The\r\naddition of a mulch helps.\r\n\r\nI have tried the Chinese chestnut here. The plants arrived in good\r\ncondition and had excellent care with what I believe was adequate water\r\nand fertile soil. They put out in April and grew off most encouragingly\r\nuntil about July, and then, in an interval of about a week, every tree\r\nwithered and died as though from heat and drouth. But until other\r\nevidence to the contrary comes in, I shall strongly suspect that the\r\nreal trouble was that the Chinese chestnut demands an acid soil and is\r\nhighly allergic to even a slight alkalinity. My impression is that the\r\nsoil here has a reading of about pH 7-7-1/2.\r\n\r\nExperience and observation here on the western fringe of the native\r\npecan belt lead me to believe the pecan, black and Persian walnuts do\r\nwell when they can be irrigated, or when they are planted on a site\r\nwhere a first class water conservation system can be devised and\r\nproperly constructed.\r\n\r\nThe black walnut has not been damaged by any insect, disease or mineral\r\ndeficiency of the soil that I know of. A very limited and inconclusive\r\nexperience with Clark, Thomas, Myers, Mintle, Sifford, Snyder and\r\nSparrow varieties led to the suggestion that the Thomas might be a\r\nslightly more thrifty tree.\r\n\r\nThe pecan (both nut and tree) seems more subject to insect damage than\r\nthe walnut. It is also sensitive to a zinc deficiency in some soils. But\r\na proper mineral and insecticide spray usually serves to control these\r\nproblems when they occur.\r\n\r\nI have observed only one named variety of Persian walnut--a Mayette. The\r\ntree was a vigorous grower and precocious in putting on nutlets, but to\r\nmy knowledge never bore staminate blooms and over a period of several\r\nyears matured only one nut. No other Persian walnuts grew in the\r\nlocality and I assumed the matured nut must have been pollinized by a\r\nblack walnut. The tree never seemed damaged by late spring frosts or\r\nother cause.\r\n\r\nA few members of NNGA have manifested an interest in the honey locust\r\nand the Chinese jujube. Both of these trees grow well in this region\r\nwith a minimum of care. The Oriental persimmon, like the nut trees,\r\nrequires more than casual attention and ordinary growing conditions.\r\n\r\nThe Chinese jujube, a little known but hardy and attractive tree may\r\ndeserve more attention in the southwest. I have trees of the Li and Lang\r\nvarieties which bear annually and have never been bothered by insects or\r\ndisease. I am not overly enthusiastic about the fruit but understand it\r\n\"compares favorably with the fig and date in food value. Dried jujubes\r\ncarry more protein than dried figs or dates and more (50%) sugar than\r\nfigs.\"--T.A.E.S. Bulletin no. 41. But the jujube has the disagreeable\r\nhabit of sending up root sprouts which are a nuisance to destroy and,\r\nbecause the tree is grafted, the sprouts are worthless seedlings. It has\r\noccurred to me that this bad feature of the jujube might be partly\r\noffset if cuttings of the improved varieties could be made to grow by\r\nmeans of some of the root inducing chemicals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPropagation of the Hickories[1]\r\n\r\nF. L. O'ROURKE, _Department of Horticulture, Michigan State College_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe genus _Carya_ comprises all the hickories and pecans found in the\r\nUnited States. The eighth edition of Gray's Manual of Botany lists the\r\nfollowing species as being native to the United States:\r\n\r\n[1] The survey of literature pertaining to this review was completed in\r\nAugust, 1952.\r\n\r\n   _Carya aquatica_--Water hickory, Bitter Pecan\r\n   _Carya cordiformis_--Bitternut, Swamp Hickory\r\n   _Carya glabra_--Pignut\r\n   _Carya illinoensis_--Pecan\r\n   _Carya laciniosa_--Shellbark, Kingnut\r\n   _Carya ovalis_--Sweet Pignut, False Shagbark, Red Hickory\r\n   _Carya ovata_--Shagbark\r\n   _Carya pallida_--Pale Hickory\r\n   _Carya texana_--Black Hickory\r\n   _Carya tormentosa_ (C. alba)--Mockernut\r\n\r\nNut growers are interested primarily in the pecan and the shagbark,\r\nalthough a few selections have been made of the shellbark species. The\r\nbitternut is quite often used for rootstocks for the shagbark and\r\nshagbark hybrids.\r\n\r\nHickories, like other nut and tree species, do not come true from seed,\r\nso superior selected clones are propagated by budding and grafting on\r\nother trees known as rootstocks. These rootstocks are produced from\r\nseed.\r\n\r\n\r\nSeed Propagation\r\n\r\nInvestigations by Barton(1) showed that some seedlings were produced\r\nwhen the nuts were planted immediately in a warm greenhouse without\r\npretreatment, but that germination was markedly increased when the nuts\r\nwere held in a cool moist environment from one to four months before\r\nbringing into the greenhouse. She also found that fall planting of\r\nhickory nuts resulted in a good stand of seedlings the following spring\r\nif the soil was mulched, but that the freezing and thawing of\r\nunprotected ground resulted in an exceedingly poor stand of seedlings.\r\n\r\nBurkett(6) advocated stratifying pecan seed over winter in moist sand\r\nand planting in moist soil in the very early spring. He observed that\r\nthin-shelled nuts germinate more quickly than thick-shelled ones, and\r\nwarned against \"damping-off\" fungi which often killed young seedlings.\r\n\r\nBrison(5) stated that some nurserymen prefer seed of certain pecan\r\nvarieties as Riverside and Burkett for rootstock purposes as these\r\nproduce strong vigorous seedlings. He reported that while the pecan seed\r\ndoes not have a rest period, germination is increased by stratifying in\r\nmoist sand for 2 to 3 weeks or soaking in water, changed daily, for 4 to\r\n5 days previous to planting.\r\n\r\n\r\nPropagation by Layering\r\n\r\nNo records are available in regard to any hickory species or variety\r\nother than pecan having been propagated by any method of either soil or\r\nair layering. The writer(14) while experimenting with aerial layering in\r\n1945 found one instance of root production on a hickory where the branch\r\nwas girdled at the base of the one-year wood. This method offers\r\npossibilities, especially now that polythene plastic is available for\r\nretaining moisture in the moss about the girdle or wound on the layered\r\nbranch.\r\n\r\nGossard(9) reported success in producing roots from the tops of small\r\ngrafted and budded pecan trees by trench layering and from older trees\r\nby aerial layering with marcot boxes. He indicated that a favorable\r\ncombination of etiolation, moisture, rooting medium, and a root-inducing\r\nchemical was desirable for successful rooting.\r\n\r\nPropagation by Cuttings\r\n\r\nHardwood cuttings of pecan were rooted by Stoutemyer and O'Rourke(23) in\r\n1938 by first callusing the bases of the cuttings in warm moist peat\r\nmoss, and then treating with an aqueous solution of indole butyric acid\r\nbefore planting. Both roots and shoots grew well for three to four weeks\r\nand then the shoots wilted and died. It was observed that the roots were\r\nthickened and presented an abnormal appearance. Trials during succeeding\r\nyears gave no better results and the experiments were discontinued.\r\nCuttings taken from native hickories during these same years failed to\r\nproduce roots.\r\n\r\nRomberg(17) reported a small measure of success in rooting hardwood\r\nstem cuttings to which young seedlings had been grafted by the inarch\r\nmethod. The influence of the seedling on the nourishment of the cutting\r\nwas gradually diminished by girdling caused by a copper wire which was\r\ntied about the seedling stem.\r\n\r\nApparently root cuttings of pecans and other hickories have never been\r\ntried. In 1896 Corsa(7) observed that \"when the lateral roots of the\r\npecan are broken by the plow, the ends of these roots frequently send up\r\nthrifty shoots.\" Such a response would indicate that adventitious shoots\r\nmay arise from roots and that root cuttings may be successful.\r\n\r\n\r\nPropagation by Grafting\r\n\r\nA search of the literature failed to reveal a discussion of any method\r\nof bench grafting with hickories, although presumably it must have been\r\ntried. Propagators may have been discouraged in using bench graft\r\nmethods by the sparse roots usually found on two-year seedlings. It is\r\nsuggested that undercutting and root pruning the seedlings several times\r\nwhile in the nursery row should produce a more adequate root system\r\nwhich would transplant well after grafting. Brison(5) remarked that\r\nbench grafting is not used in the propagation of pecans in Texas on\r\naccount of transplanting difficulties.\r\n\r\nCommercial nurserymen now prefer to bud hickories and pecans rather than\r\nto graft, but formerly Reed(15) reported the whip-and-tongue method was\r\nused on thrifty one-year seedlings in the nursery row. It is conceivable\r\nthat the cleft graft could be used at this stage when the diameter of\r\nstock and scion are quite similar but no record of its use is available.\r\n\r\nTop-working or grafting in the branches is commonly practiced on\r\nseedling trees and sometimes used to change varieties in the orchard.\r\nReed(15), Sitton(19), Rosborough et al(18), MacDaniels(11), and\r\nStoke(22) have described various methods that have proven successful.\r\nPractically all agree that the bark graft or a modification thereof is\r\nbest. Morris(12), Benton(3), MacDaniels(11), Wilkinson(25), and others\r\nhave shown that a greater per cent of survival is secured when the\r\nstocks are cut 10 days to 2 weeks before grafting. During this time the\r\nstubs heal somewhat and excess bleeding is decreased. It has been\r\nreported by Becker(2) that the success of walnut grafting is greater\r\nwhen the grafts are set just after the leaves are full grown but no such\r\ndata is available for hickories. The use of paper bags or other shading\r\ndevice over the scion is advocated by Morris(13), MacDaniels(11),\r\nShelton(20) and others.\r\n\r\n\r\nPropagation by Budding\r\n\r\nPatch budding is now almost universally used by commercial nurserymen in\r\nthe propagation of hickories and pecans. Patches are usually cut with a\r\ndouble-bladed knife although some use the rectangular Jones\r\npatch-budding tool. The \"plate\" or \"skin\" bud is also used to some\r\nextent. The thick bark of hickories and pecans discourages the use of\r\nthe shield or \"T\" bud.\r\n\r\nBudding is usually done in late summer with mature buds of the season\r\ngrowth which remain dormant until the following spring. Occasionally\r\ndormant budwood taken in winter is held in cold storage until the bark\r\nof the stock slips in the spring. These spring-set buds are forced the\r\nsame season by cutting the stocks back shortly after setting.\r\nPatch-budding is described by Reed(15) and by Rosborough et al(18).\r\nReed(15) mentioned that it may be advisable to make the cuts in the\r\nstock from one to three weeks before the bark is removed so that the\r\nhealing process may be under way at the time the bud patch is inserted.\r\n\r\n\r\nStorage and Handling of Scions and Budwood.\r\n\r\nShelton(20) reported an easy and unique method of keeping scions moist\r\nby storing in a closed container with a small amount of sodium sulphate\r\n(Glauber's salt). Slightly moist peat moss is an excellent packing\r\nmaterial. Brison(4) reported that a temperature of 32 deg. F to 38 deg. F in\r\nstorage is satisfactory for keeping the buds dormant, and that a few\r\ndays from 80 deg. F to 85 deg. F will stimulate cambial activity so that the\r\npatches will \"slip\" easily when cut. Scionwood is sometimes dipped in\r\nwax, paraffin, or plastic resin before storing in order to prevent loss\r\nof moisture and guard against pathogenic organisms.\r\n\r\n\r\nWaxes and Wound Dressings\r\n\r\nSitton(19) used a large number of variously formulated waxes on pecan\r\nand found that the most successful from the standpoint of graft survival\r\nwas one composed of 10 parts rosin, 2 parts beeswax, and 1 part filler\r\nsuch as kieselguhr, talc, or aluminum powder. Under Louisiana conditions\r\na light-colored wax was preferable to dark colored one. Asphalt\r\nemulsions were not satisfactory.\r\n\r\n\r\nRootstocks and Interstocks for Hickories\r\n\r\nReed(16) summarized the rootstock studies at Beltsville, Maryland, by\r\nstating that pecans were best on pecan seedlings and that shagbarks were\r\nsuccessful on either shagbark or pecan rootstocks. He reported a lack of\r\ncongeniality between shagbark and bitternut hickory. Smith(21), however,\r\nfound that pecan stocks were unsuccessful for shagbarks as few scions\r\nlived and growth of those which survived was poor. He also reported that\r\nbitternut was practically as good as shagbark for shagbark varieties.\r\nHe stated that pignut was absolutely useless as a stock for shagbark.\r\nWeschcke(24) reported that shagbark varieties grew well on bitternut but\r\nalso indicated that a slow growing variety would be stimulated in growth\r\nby working on pecan stocks which are more vigorous in growth than the\r\nother hickories. Dunstan(8) reported that pecan provides a perfectly\r\nsatisfactory rootstock for shagbark, shagbark hybrid, and hican\r\nvarieties. A number of varieties have been tested over a period of\r\nseveral years with favorable results as shown by lasting unions and\r\nbetter than average yields.\r\n\r\nThe Fairbanks hybrid has often been used as an intermediate stock\r\nbetween bitternut and some shagbark varieties and Last(10) has stated\r\nthat the variety Rockville is useful for interstock purposes on account\r\nof its exceptional vigor.\r\n\r\n\r\nNursery Problems\r\n\r\nHickories and pecans have long tap-roots with few branches and hence do\r\nnot transplant well. Some few have grown the seedlings for one year in\r\nbeds underlain with wire screen netting or have undercut the seedlings\r\nto promote branching of the roots. The stocks must grow two years from\r\nseed to attain a diameter permitting of patch budding and must remain\r\none or two years more to allow the scion to form a tree. The resulting\r\nplant is large in both root and stem and requires careful handling in\r\ndigging, shipping, and planting in the permanent location. The\r\nvicissitudes which befall the production of the northern hickories are\r\noften so great as to discourage nurserymen who otherwise would grow\r\nthem. This is an unfortunate fact but a real one, as the would-be\r\npurchaser often learns when he attempts to buy named varieties of\r\nhickories. The situation with the pecan is much better, due perhaps to\r\nthe greater demand for such trees but also to the greater ease of\r\npropagation in general nursery practice.\r\n\r\n\r\nConclusions\r\n\r\nGood varieties of hickories bear good nuts and more people should plant\r\ngood trees which should be produced by nurseries with well-branched\r\nfibrous root systems so that they will transplant easily. Research is\r\nneeded to determine practical methods of propagation which will permit\r\nof inexpensive quantity production of superior named varieties of\r\nshagbark and shagbark hybrid hickories.\r\n\r\n\r\nLiterature Cited\r\n\r\n    1.

Plant Industry Station, Beltsville, Md._\r\n\r\n\r\nOn three recent trips to southern Europe I noted large numbers of dying\r\nPersian (English) walnuts, _Juglans regia_, in France and Switzerland\r\nand scattered trees in other countries. Dying of Persian walnuts from a\r\nroot disease of undetermined cause has been reported from various\r\nEuropean countries for many years. The extensive dying of mature Persian\r\nwalnut in a number of areas in southern France is very serious. Farmers\r\nand orchardists are discouraged from planting the Persian walnut even\r\nthough it is a very profitable tree when not attacked by the root\r\ndisease. In area after area I noted that the farmers had scattered their\r\nPersian walnut trees, separating them as much as possible or planting\r\nthem along the boundary of fields instead of in orchard plantings. They\r\nhad found too frequently that solid plantings of walnut die from the\r\nroot disease. The total number of Persian walnuts in southern France has\r\ndecreased alarmingly in the last sixty years. In Tessin Province in\r\nSwitzerland many unhealthy Persian walnuts were noted this past summer\r\nshowing the same symptoms as in southern France.\r\n\r\nStudies By French and Italian pathologists have indicated that the\r\nfungus _Phytophthora cinnamomi_ is the most likely cause of this dying\r\nof walnuts. I was informed that it is worse on soils inclined to be wet\r\nor poorly drained at certain times of the year, conditions favorable for\r\nattack of many hosts of this Phytophthora. The work reported by B. S.\r\nCrandall and me in Phytopathology, March 1945, showed there was a rather\r\ndirect relation between soil conditions and _Phytophthora cinnamomi_\r\ndamage to black and Persian walnut seedlings. Long periods of heavy\r\nrainfall were very favorable for an epidemic outbreak of this fungus on\r\nwalnut and other nursery stock. Another species of _Phytophthora_, _P.\r\ncactorum_, has also attacked black walnuts in nurseries in eastern\r\nUnited States; this fungus has also been reported on Persian walnuts.\r\n\r\nWe are interested in receiving reports of the dying of Persian or black\r\nwalnuts in orchards or rows of trees in the Eastern half of the United\r\nStates. Persian walnuts suffer from winter injury in many areas and\r\nsometimes this injury is confused with the root disease. However, where\r\nthere are indications of continuing dying of walnuts year after year\r\nwith a progression from one part to another of the planting, we would\r\nlike to receive a report.\r\n\r\nSome root diseases are difficult to diagnose, especially when the small\r\nroots are the parts affected.\r\n\r\nThe symptoms of the root disease of the Persian walnut in Europe are in\r\nmany ways very similar to those of the Phytophthora root disease of\r\nchestnut and chinkapin in this country as described in the report by\r\nGravatt and Crandall in the Northern Nut Growers Association Proceedings\r\nfor 1944. In some cases Persian walnuts die slowly and in others death\r\nis rapid, with the entire tree browning in summer. Some trees will show\r\nless green color than normal during the summer and gradually die over a\r\nyear or two. Trees in different stages of dying can be seen in the same\r\nplanting.\r\n\r\nPersian walnuts in the Western States in recent years have been dying\r\nfrom a disease of undetermined cause. Dr. Paul W. Miller and others have\r\nreported on the black line graft union failure, _Armillaria mellea_ and\r\ndying of roots from undetermined causes. As _Phytophthora cinnamomi_, an\r\nimported fungus, is a comparative recent invader of many parts of the\r\nwest, Dr. Miller is giving the fungus some attention as a possible\r\nparasite. On some hosts, this fungus attacks primarily the very smallest\r\nroots at certain favorable times of the year, which makes determination\r\nof its role as a parasite rather difficult.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFactors That Influence Nut Production\r\n\r\nW. B. WARD, _Extension Horticulturist, Purdue University, Lafayette,\r\nInd._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe profitable production of fruit on nut trees under cultivation has no\r\ndoubt been influenced by several factors. Assuming that the present-day\r\nseedlings and propagated varieties are winter hardy and the tree of\r\nbearing age, 10 to 15 years old, one may expect a reasonable harvest. It\r\nis somewhat disappointing to the owner of a single nut tree or for the\r\ngrower on a semi or commercial basis to find that the tree or several\r\ntrees have failed to set fruit.\r\n\r\nThe commercial fruit grower of apples learned, many years ago, that\r\ncertain varieties when planted in solid blocks failed to set\r\nsatisfactory crops. Rather than lose several years of growth and\r\nexpense, the better growers top-worked the trees with a good pollinizer.\r\nThe result was a profitable harvest of red and yellow apples, or\r\nvarieties of different maturity. The peach grower liked the looks of a\r\nvery fine peach and after a short trial found that the variety was not\r\nhardy enough to withstand the winter and early spring temperatures. The\r\nexperiences of the commercial fruit growers could be well used by the\r\nnut grower. Only trees adapted to local conditions should be planted\r\nregardless of the recommendations of the nurseryman. Hardiness of wood\r\nand bud, ample production of pollen, reasonable climate during the\r\ngrowing season, and the control of insects or diseases determine, for\r\nthe most part, the success of the harvest.\r\n\r\n\r\nSoils and Fertility\r\n\r\nThe nut trees require good drainage and a good supply of moisture. A\r\nreasonably fertile soil should be selected for a planting site but\r\nthrough mulches, manures, and commercial mineral fertilizers any soil\r\nmay be built up to a high state of fertility. A weak tree has little\r\nchance and may come into bearing too late to be of value for the present\r\nowner. The annual growth should be checked each year and, unless 10 to\r\n12 inches of growth has been made the previous year, some means of\r\nstimulating more growth should be employed. The hickory, pecan and black\r\nwalnut, as a rule, make little new annual growth while the Persian or\r\nCarpathian walnut, heartnut and chestnut ordinarily produce good annual\r\ngrowth and an abundance of good foliage grown where it counts the most,\r\non the new wood.\r\n\r\nThose who have observed the growth habits of nut trees know that the\r\ncatkins are found on last year's growth, or two year old wood, and the\r\nfruiting flowers at the end of the present season's growth. There are\r\ntimes when the new growth developed in a matter of a few days to\r\nsometimes as long as two weeks. During the period of prolongation of the\r\nnew growth and the formation and receptiveness of the pistillate flower\r\nmuch can happen. The catkins shed pollen when the temperature and\r\natmospheric conditions are normal. Many times the pollen is dispersed\r\nbefore the pistillate flowers are formed.\r\n\r\n\r\nCross vs Self-Pollination\r\n\r\nThere is no assurance that a nut tree which fruits on the average of\r\neight out of ten years will continue to do so in the future.\r\nOccasionally trees take on an alternate year bearing habit that could be\r\ncaused from injury, insect or disease damage, or the relocation of plant\r\nfood. The nut trees on their own roots should do better than when\r\ngrafted or budded. The compatability of stock and scion is yet to be\r\nworked out and any constriction at the union may alter the fruiting\r\nhabits.\r\n\r\nThe possible sources of pollen for hickory and pecan are from\r\nself-fertile trees, seedlings, and various natural crosses that may or\r\nmay not produce edible fruit. The walnut family, which includes the\r\nblack and Persian or Carpathian walnut; butternut and Asiatic nut\r\n(heartnut) have been used as pollinizers on the Persian walnut with some\r\nsuccess. The butternut is the first to shed pollen in Indiana with the\r\ncatkins dropping, in some years, by late April and the first week in\r\nMay. Some years the black walnut has produced the peak pollen from May\r\n5th to 12th but during the spring of 1953 the Thomas, Stabler, Rowher,\r\nOhio and Stambaugh dropped the pollen from May 18th to 22nd. The Asiatic\r\nwalnuts were in full bloom on May 14th and 15th. The above dates do not\r\ncorrespond to observations of other years, except for the butternut. The\r\npistillate flowers on the Persian walnuts were fully opened by May 16th.\r\nThe catkins of the Persian trees had dried by May 12th. Catkins from the\r\nAsiatic walnuts were kept fresh and distributed throughout two Persian\r\nwalnut trees and by mid-afternoon a heavy rain came. On May 18th a few\r\ncatkins were again removed from the Asiatic walnut and only enough for\r\none Persian walnut tree were found and hung in the tree. The first tree\r\nhas no fruit while the second tree has a fair crop in the making.\r\n\r\nA letter from H. F. Stoke, Chairman of the Survey Committee on the\r\nblossoming dates of the Persian walnut said: \"Payne, Lancaster and\r\nBroadview staminate flowers were out on April 9, 10 and 11. The\r\npistillate flowers of McKinster, Caesar and Crath #1 were receptive on\r\nApril 11, 10 and 10.\" The above dates were over a month before spring\r\ncame to Indiana. Whether or not the Stoke varieties in Virginia would do\r\nthe same in Indiana or elsewhere is still the problem.\r\n\r\nThe black walnut varieties mentioned previously set very few fruits at\r\nLafayette this year while a promising new variety, Sol, from Ferd\r\nBolten, Linton, Indiana, has a full crop, and has been a consistent\r\nproducer for the past several years.\r\n\r\n\r\nHow Many Pounds per Tree\r\n\r\nThroughout the Middle West the elm, native chestnut and some of the oaks\r\nare dying from disease troubles. The homemaker wants to plant a tree\r\nthat will provide shade, fit well in the landscaping of the home, be a\r\nclean tree and yet be fruitful and bear early.\r\n\r\nThe age of the tree and the growth has much to do with production. Some\r\npecan varieties have produced several hundred pounds per tree and the\r\nsame for black walnuts with hickory, butternut and chestnut in smaller\r\nquantities. There are four Persian walnut trees growing in Franklin,\r\nIndiana, that are 20 years old and have fruited continuously for the\r\npast 10 years. The trees were seedlings, two of which are very promising\r\nfor distribution. Tree #1 produces an average of 10 pounds; tree #2, 15\r\npounds; #3, about 40 pounds and #4, 100 pounds. Good pollination under\r\ncommon growing conditions of the Midwest and a good variety acclimated\r\nfor general planting will no doubt make a host of good friends and a\r\nwonderful contribution from the members of the N.N.G.A.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRootstocks for the Walnut in France[2]\r\n\r\nJ. C. MCDANIEL\r\n\r\n[2]This is a translation, by Dr. R. T. Dunstan, of the section on\r\n\"Rootstocks\" in Chapter XI of _Les Noyers_, by two Doctors of Pharmacy,\r\nP. Peyre and E. Lancosme. This 447 page book with 140 figures was\r\npublished in 1942 by Jouve et Cie, 15, rue Racine, Paris, and is a very\r\ncomplete treatise on the subject of walnuts.\r\n\r\nThe French experience with the eastern black walnut and the related\r\nArizona walnut as rootstocks is interesting, as is the discussion of one\r\nmethod of propagation, where dormant whole-root grafts are started in\r\npots under glass. This differs somewhat from the indoor grafting\r\nprocedures described in our recent Reports by Mr. Stephen Bernath and\r\nDr. Philip Brierley. (Incidentally, Dr. Brierley tells me that he got\r\nuniformly good grafts--96 to 100% growing--in his 1953 experiment. The\r\nuse of growth substance powder did not significantly increase the\r\n\"take\". The controlling factors seem to be the use of healthy scions and\r\nrootstocks, followed by high enough temperature and humidity to promote\r\nrapid callusing of the grafts.)\r\n\r\nThe \"old Royal Walnut\" of the French is, of course, what we call Persian\r\n(or English) walnut, and not Luther Burbank's \"Royal Hybrid\", the\r\nunfortunately named cross of two black walnuts, _J. nigra_ x _J.\r\nhindsii_. _J. torreyi_ is a synonym for _J. major_, the Arizona walnut.\r\n\r\nRootstocks fulfilling two essential conditions should be chosen, those\r\ncapable of adapting themselves to soil and climate where they are to be\r\nplanted and of resisting diseases that may attack them under unsanitary\r\nconditions or under too intense cultivation. Among the numerous\r\nvarieties tested, two deserve attention as choice rootstocks, one\r\nnative, the other American = _J. regia_ and _J. nigra_.\r\n\r\n_J. regia_, our old Royal Walnut, so common in France, is excellent when\r\nplanted in new, light and fertile soils, preferably clay-lime or\r\nclay-silicon.\r\n\r\nBut as the roots are very spreading it is important to stir the soil\r\nwell but slightly and avoid deep plowing, for it is well known that\r\nthrough accidental injury to the roots the various \"armillaria\" enter\r\nthe trees to develop the \"pourridie\" or \"pus disease\", or \"circle\r\ndisease\". It is better, then, to use a rootstock immune to this malady\r\nso wide-spread among our native walnuts.\r\n\r\n_J. nigra_ enjoys this happy advantage of offering no foothold to this\r\nparasite, so harmful to its sister species. It accommodates itself well\r\nin many soils in which _J. regia_ will grow, even dry and gravelly, but\r\nprefers soils which are fresh, open, rich, and especially, deep. Its\r\nroots are long and vertical and their development stops in contact with\r\nan impermeable layer of soil.\r\n\r\nIt produces specimens magnificent in height and rapidity of growth.\r\nColor of bark differs, though diameter of tree is more or less the same.\r\nThis slight objection may be easily avoided by grafting regia on nigra\r\nat ground-level when wood is well matured and in mild weather.\r\n\r\nProof that this species of walnut is resistant to \"pourridie\" was given\r\nin a report to members of the Congress of Grenoble in 1936 by Mr. Bourne\r\nof Saint Marcelin. \"At Blache de Vinay, we are told, some black walnuts,\r\nplanted more than thirty years ago in an infested field, have shown full\r\nresistance. One tree, grafted at ground-level and planted too deep, was\r\ninfected many years ago by the \"pus\" above the graft on the _J. regia_\r\npart. The diseased part was treated as was the custom then, with\r\nsulphuric acid, etc. The wound healed and the rootstock remained\r\nabsolutely clean. A photo by Mr. Roy, Director of Agricultural Services\r\nat Isere, establishes this absolute proof.\r\n\r\nOther varieties of walnut have been tested as rootstocks--_cinerea_,\r\n_cordiformis_, and _Siebodiana_, but only the first seems to have given\r\nany satisfactory results.\r\n\r\nReporter Bourne concludes, \"The primary purpose of our research on\r\nrootstocks will be to obtain a hybrid of _regia_ x _nigra_ that will\r\ncombine the resistance of nigra to the \"pourridie\" and regia's habit of\r\nvegetating late in spring.\r\n\r\nBy virtue of the ability of the female element to transmit its rusticity\r\nand vegetative form it seems, _a priori_, that we shall get a good\r\nrootstock by crossing _nigra_ as mother by Franquette (sic) and then if\r\nneed be, by backcrossing to Franquette in the second generation.\r\n\r\nThere exists a 4th type of walnut graft, dating from 1880, which if done\r\nintelligently, permits the rapid multiplication of the walnut--the root\r\ngraft.\r\n\r\nIn a short but very interesting report to the Nut Congress of Grenoble\r\nin October, 1936 by Mr. Leon Treyves, and very kindly sent on to us, the\r\nauthor says, \"This procedure, devised by my family around 1880, consists\r\nof grafting on one year old roots, branches from selected, vigorous\r\ntrees, either by cleft or English grafts, whichever gives best fit of\r\nscion (which is generally smaller than root) and stock. Graft is then\r\ntied with raffia and waxed to avoid all contact with air and placed in a\r\nmoderately heated frame. After a month of this treatment the graft has\r\ntaken. Then it is gradually accustomed to open air and the frame is\r\nremoved. In the fall or the following spring the graft may be planted in\r\nits permanent location or in nursery row.\r\n\r\nThis system presents numerous advantages:\r\n\r\n     1. Rapidity, since the plants can be grafted after one year,\r\n    instead of three or four.\r\n\r\n    2. Economy of time and expense, since considerable numbers of grafts\r\n    can be made rapidly and in limited space.\r\n\r\n    3. More rapid development of growth and fruiting. Saplings of 1 to 2\r\n    meters planted in winter of '28-'29 measured in October '36 25-27\r\n    cm. in circumference at one meter from ground. Trees two and three\r\n    years old, still in nursery, are bearing one to two normally\r\n    developed fruits.\r\n\r\nThe author indicates that he uses _nigra_ for stocks, \"since that is the\r\nonly one that has proved its adaptation to grafting and its resistance\r\nto the \"pus disease\".\"\r\n\r\nAt the time he gave his paper in '36 Mr. Treyves announced that he was\r\ncontinuing his grafting experiments on _J. Sieboldiana, cordiformis_ and\r\n_torreyi. [J. torreyi_ = _J. major_--J. C. McDaniel.]\r\n\r\nMr. Treyves, whom we cannot thank too much for his favor, was kind\r\nenough to set forth the preliminary techniques of his method of\r\nroot-grafting. We give a resume of them here.\r\n\r\n1. Preparation. Plant nuts well-spaced in rows in good soil, convenient\r\nto irrigation, if needed. Clean nuts of good quality, previously\r\nstratified, should be planted in winter. Plants are lifted before the\r\nfollowing spring and heeled in. For scions wood of 7-8 cm. is cut from\r\nyoung, healthy and vigorous trees and passed to the grafter at the same\r\ntime as the roots, which have been previously lifted, washed and cut off\r\nat the crown or a little below. Scion, bevelled, is set either in\r\nEnglish or cleft graft, tied with raffia or with a numbered wool strip,\r\nwaxed and potted in rich but light soil, moderately firmed around roots.\r\nPots are then set in some homogeneous material (waste tan-bark or\r\nsawdust) and left in a moderately heated bed.\r\n\r\n2. Care. Watering. Temperature of beds should be kept constant around\r\ngrafts and they should be watered every other day. Of course, grass and\r\nmold should be prevented.\r\n\r\nAs soon as grafts begin to grow (usually around 15 days) the pots are\r\ngradually removed from sawdust, and when plants have made 15-20 cm. of\r\ngrowth (after 30-40 days) they are slowly hardened to air and sun,\r\nreplanted in well-shaded beds, properly watered and cared for until they\r\nare set in nursery row.\r\n\r\n3. Planting in nursery. The following spring they are set 60 cm. apart\r\nin nursery rows 1 m. apart in well-manured and well-prepared plots.\r\nUsual care during growth. With the 2nd year plants attain 1-1/4-1-1/2 m.\r\nand it is not uncommon to discover a nut. The 3rd year they make 2-1/2\r\nm. at least with 8-12 cm. of girth and are ready for transplanting to\r\npermanent site.\r\n\r\n4. Soils and situations. Mr. Treyves tells us that the walnut plantings\r\nin \"lower Gresivuaudan\" are on old alluvium of the Isere Valley and in\r\nlimy marl soils of the upper slopes. A little farther away in Savoy, the walnut is\r\nvigorous in Jurassic or clay limestone soils. The same is true in\r\nDordogne, in Correze, and in the Lot, where soils are of similar origin.\r\n\r\nWalnuts are found at an average altitude of 600 m. but grow up to 1200\r\nm. in Savoy, and particularly in Switzerland.\r\n\r\nThe best exposures are SW, W, and SE, sunny slopes, well protected from\r\nthe north wind and late frosts.\r\n\r\nMr. Treyves has personally some plantings of walnut in Sologne, (where\r\ncalcareous soils are lacking) and in Champagne, where the soils lack\r\nlime. He has noted that these trees grow and fruit normally.\r\n\r\nCultivation. It is important to keep soil around isolated trees well\r\nstirred and to increase the area of cultivation as the rootspread\r\nincreases.\r\n\r\n5. Rootstocks. For the present the plants chosen for stocks have come\r\nfrom nigra, the only one that has proved itself in the matter of \"take\".\r\nIt does well in moist soils.\r\n\r\nMr. Treyves has personally tried to graft Mayette and Franquette on\r\n_Torreyi_. He has found the \"take\" and the union perfect. But even\r\nthough vegetation is promising we must wait 22 years for a full test.\r\n\r\nHe proposes to lest all the \"rootstocks placed at his disposal in order\r\nto acclimatize the good French varieties to all the soils which suit\r\nthese stocks. Grafting on _J. Torreyi_ will be useful to a [_sera utile\r\na un_] stock that grows in dry soil, like _nigra_.\r\n\r\n\"But that is a matter we shall have to examine again in ten years, first\r\nas regards vegetation and then in 20 years as concerns fruit\r\nproduction.\"\r\n\r\nSince these experiments date from '36 at the time of the Grenoble\r\nCongress we have only 13 years to wait to learn what sort of fruit these\r\ntrees will bear and only 5 to see how they behave vegetatively.\r\n\r\nIt remains, then, only to wish \"good luck\" to our kind and devoted\r\ncorrespondent and to thank him for his valuable documentation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPictorial Record of Grafting at Climax, Michigan\r\n\r\nW. M. BECKERT, _Jackson, Mich._\r\n\r\n\r\nTop-working black walnuts to Persian Walnuts has long been practiced by\r\nvarious members of this organization. It is hoped by this series of\r\nKodachrome slides that a record of such top-working by one of our\r\nmembers would be of interest and also show the details of just how the\r\nwork is done under actual field conditions.\r\n\r\nMr. Gilbert Becker, of Climax, Michigan, has been quite successful in\r\ntop-working black walnuts. Needless to say, these pictures were taken to\r\nshow how an expert goes about grafting black walnuts. Mr. Becker was\r\ncontacted as to when he would do his grafting and he mentioned that on\r\nMay 80, 1953, he would be top-working his stock. Plans were made to be\r\npresent on that date and we were fortunate in having bright weather for\r\ntaking the pictures.\r\n\r\nThe first two slides show Mr. Becker removing the scionwood from his\r\nstorage pit, selecting the scions and preparing to go out to do the\r\ngrafting. On the way to the trees that were to be grafted, the pictures\r\nfor the next two slides were taken to show the stage of leaf development\r\nand the length of the catkins of the Thomas Black Walnut, so members in\r\nother sections of the country can see how far out in leaf the Thomas\r\nvariety was when the grafting was done.\r\n\r\nThe following series of slides show how Mr. Becker top-works the black\r\nwalnuts.\r\n\r\nFirst, removing that portion of the stock, note he used a pruning saw,\r\nmakes a cut at the point where he wants to graft. He uses the bark slit\r\nmethod. The scion is shaped by one stroke of the grafting knife; a long\r\nslanting cut is made and the scion inserted in the stock. Just prior to\r\nplacing the scion, the bark of the stock is slit, two cuts with the\r\npoint of the knife, approximate width of the scion and down along the\r\nbark to the length the scion is to be inserted, then the scion is\r\nplaced. The next step is to cut off the little sliver of bark which is\r\npushed out, at the point where it does not contact the scion. In this\r\ntree, two scions were placed, the scions being wrapped tightly with\r\nwaxed muslin which was prepared beforehand, using strips about one-half\r\ninch wide. Enough was used to firmly bind the scions to the stock.\r\nPlease note that a small piece of wax muslin was placed on the inside of\r\nthe scion to prevent the wax from going down between the scion and\r\nstock. The final step is waxing the scion and brushing with hot wax, in\r\norder to prevent the scion from drying out; to provide shade, Mr.\r\nBecker, in this case, used grass and made a hood over the scion, tying\r\nit with string.\r\n\r\nThe following slides show the same procedure of grafting other trees.\r\nYou will note in one case he has climbed up into the branches of the\r\ntree. To shade the scions, he used aluminum foil, folded around the\r\nscion and tied with a rubber grafting strip. In all these pictures the\r\nscions used were Colby.\r\n\r\nMr. Becker is very adept, quick, and does the grafting so that it\r\nactually seems effortless. His technique is so fast, there is very\r\nlittle chance of the scion drying out before it is placed.\r\n\r\nOn July 26th, I returned to Climax and the grafts were successful, as\r\nyou can see by the following series. The one failure was the first tree\r\nthat was grafted, and which had the grass for shading of the scion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRock Phosphate for Nut Trees\r\n\r\nHARRY P. BURGART, _Union City, Mich._\r\n\r\n\r\nMy soil is of the sandy type and I have to watch the mineral content\r\nrather closely for nitrogen and phosphate deficiencies. Winter-killing\r\nof one year black walnut and pecan seedlings is serious during seasons\r\nwhen our winters are less severe than usual and during winters when we\r\nhad had plenty of snow cover for protection. This worried me a great\r\ndeal and I decided there must be a deficiency. Soil tests repeatedly\r\nshowed a lack of phosphate.\r\n\r\nI applied ground rock phosphate to my larger bearing English walnut\r\ntrees and there has not been the least sign of winter injury since.\r\n\r\nMany of my smaller nut trees have been bearing earlier for me since I\r\nhave been using the phosphate. Customers who come here often remark at\r\nthe way some of my little grafted trees are bearing crops and I tell\r\nthem that I believe in keeping plenty of phosphate in the soil for root\r\ngrowth and nut production.\r\n\r\nI am writing this brief article thinking that it might help solve the\r\nproblems of other nut growers who have repeatedly been having trouble\r\nwith winter-killing of their Carpathian, or English walnut trees.\r\nPhosphate seems to prevent a late sappy-condition from causing winter\r\ninjury.\r\n\r\nI prefer to apply the phosphate and nitrogen early in April or early\r\nMay. Fall applications of any kind of fertilizer are apt to cause winter\r\ninjury. I usually scatter the rock phosphate around the trees using\r\nabout four handfuls around a first year tree. Then I turn over the sod\r\nbottom with a shovel, which puts the phosphate down where the roots can\r\nget it. I use the phosphate around all the young trees we set out and\r\nseldom lose a tree as the phosphate encourages the starting of new\r\nfeeder roots on the nut trees.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA Report From Southern Minnesota\r\n\r\nR. E. HODGSON, _University of Minnesota, Southern School and Experiment\r\nStation, Waseca, Minn._\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have 20 odd Carpathian walnut trees growing from nuts planted about\r\n1931. So far, I have never seen a flower on any of them. They grow up 6\r\nor 8 feet in a year and that seems to be their difficulty. They do not\r\nstop growing in time to harden off before cold weather comes. I think a\r\nlot of the winter killing is also due to sun scald which would indicate\r\nan inability to retain dormancy during a January thaw. Some of the trees\r\nhave lived through two winters with only minor damage and then when the\r\nright conditions come along, they are killed to the ground. Wrapping the\r\ntrunks with aluminum foil has not solved the problem. I have purchased\r\none or two grafted trees which were recommended as more hardy but so far\r\nthey have had the same experience as the one I grew from nuts.\r\n\r\nBlack walnut and hickory do well here and I have a hiccan perhaps 20\r\nfeet tall but it has never borne any nuts. Chinese chestnuts are not\r\nentirely hardy and grow very slowly. This year I set out about 20\r\nAmerican chestnuts from Minnesota grown seed and I hope that we are far\r\nenough from other trees of this variety to escape the blight. Tree\r\ngrowing is just a hobby and lately there has been very little time for\r\nhobbies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nChestnut Breeding\r\n\r\nReport for 1953\r\n\r\nARTHUR HARMOUNT GRAVES and HANS NIENSTAEDT, _The Connecticut\r\nAgricultural Experiment Station, New Haven, Connecticut_\r\n\r\n\r\nThe chief aim of this breeding work, which has been carried on now\r\nwithout interruption since 1930, is to develop a tall timber type of\r\nchestnut by breeding the American species with the blight resistant but\r\ncomparatively low-growing Japanese and Chinese chestnuts, _Castanea\r\ncrenata_ and _C. mollissima_, respectively. Practically all trees of our\r\nvaluable American chestnut of any appreciable size have now been killed\r\nto the ground by the blight fungus, _Endothia parasitica_. Shoots\r\narising from the base of the old stumps often live long enough to bear\r\npollen, and this we have lately been forced to use in our breeding work\r\nwith the disadvantage that we can not know definitely the nature of the\r\ngenotype of the pollen parent. American pollen from a good phenotype\r\nnear Washington, D. C., was kindly furnished us in the early 30's by the\r\nthen Office of Forest Pathology of the U.S.D.A., and this stock is now\r\nincorporated with our older Japanese-American and Chinese-American\r\nhybrids.\r\n\r\nAs indicated in the following pages, we are not neglecting the\r\nnut-bearing potentialities of the chestnut tree.\r\n\r\n\r\nWeather Conditions in 1953\r\n\r\nThe disastrous ice storm of the 9th and 10th of January caused slight\r\ndamage to some of the Chinese trees. Their numerous, more or less\r\nhorizontal branches and characteristically brittle wood make them prone\r\nto damage of this sort; nevertheless, only a few branches were lost.\r\nAfter a comparatively warm February, the warmest since 1925, March\r\nbrought us more rain than for any March in the 81 years records have\r\nbeen kept[3]--a total of 10.78 inches. This was all to the good, as\r\nlater events proved. Because of the preceding warm February the ground\r\nwas for the most part unfrozen, so that, instead of running off, the\r\nwater was largely absorbed in the soil, and thus added to the water\r\ntable. The precipitation of April was again heavy--5.6 inches--the\r\nnormal per month for this area being about 3-1/2 inches. After an\r\nunusually good growing season in May, June and July, about the middle of\r\nAugust a long drought of nearly 10 weeks duration commenced. The\r\nconditions were similar to those in 1952, except that in that year the\r\ndrought began later, in October. However, the large amount of water in\r\nthe soil from the spring rains prevented serious consequences, just as\r\nin 1952 the heavy rainfall in August and the normal one in September\r\nmitigated any serious results from the later drought of that year.\r\n\r\n\r\n[3] Weather records are taken from the monthly reports of the municipal\r\nairport at New Haven, Conn., and are compared with the New York City\r\nrecords for the same period, kept by the U. S. Weather Bureau at 17\r\nBattery Place, New York City.\r\n\r\n\r\nHybrids of 1953\r\n\r\nAs in former years we continued the formation of hybrids of the\r\ncombination CxJxA[4] which has to date given the most resistant\r\nindividuals and the best timber form. 277 hybrid nuts of this\r\ncombination were obtained by crossing JA with C, and C with JA. JAxJ\r\ncrossed with C yielded 25 nuts. CJA crossed with pollen from the Roxbury\r\nAmericans gave 20 nuts. The Chinese-American hybrids are also promising\r\nboth in form and in blight resistance. By crossing these with American\r\npollen from Thomaston, Conn., and from Clinton Corners, N. Y., we\r\nsecured 48 nuts. CA crossed with a good native American in Thomaston,\r\nConn., resulted in 30 nuts, and the same combination using an American\r\nin Newfoundland, N. J., produced 9 nuts. The total number of nuts\r\nderived from all crosses was 504, a much smaller figure than that for\r\nthe two preceding years. The reason for this is that considerable time\r\nwas consumed in experiments designed to determine the length of the\r\nreceptive period in the pistils.\r\n\r\n[4] C = Chinese, J = Japanese, A = American chestnut.\r\n\r\nThe 1953 nut production (Table I) compared well with last year's. The\r\ntotal yields were as good as, or better than, the 1952 crop and the\r\naverage weight per nut was not significantly lower than in 1952.\r\nApparently the late summer and fall drought had no effect on nut yields\r\nand average weights. Obviously we have the warm winter and abundant\r\nearly rains to thank for this situation.\r\n\r\n Table I.

Since the smaller size is probably close to that of the wild\r\nchestnut in Japan, the figure illustrates what has been done by the\r\ncenturies of selection and cultivation that the chestnut has undergone\r\nin Japan.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig 1.

However, it is probable\r\nthat smaller nuts of the Japanese species exist. About 1/2 natural size.\r\nPhoto by B. W. McFarland, Conn. Agric. Expt. Sta., Nov. 27, 1953.]\r\n\r\nAnent the large nuts in the photograph, which weigh about an ounce\r\napiece or about 28 g. (compare figures in table I), Mr. Ferguson,\r\nInstructor at the Long Island Agricultural and Technical Institute,\r\nthrough whom we received the nuts, states that \"the nuts of the\r\nseedlings from the tree do not average better than half the size of\r\nthose of the parent tree.\" This illustrates the fact, now well known,\r\nthat the chestnut tree is self sterile. Nuts are always (with\r\nexceptions) a result of fertilization of the flowers with the pollen\r\nfrom _another_ tree.\r\n\r\nWe should like to reproduce this tree in our plantations, but the only\r\nway it can be done is by grafting scions of it on to some other,\r\npreferably Japanese, stock, or by rooting cuttings from it--a method\r\nwhich we still have not been able to accomplish readily.\r\n\r\n\r\nMoll-Seg, or Chinese Prolific\r\n\r\nIn the report of the senior writer for 1934 (_Brooklyn Botanic Garden\r\nRecord 24:62_) it was stated: \"In our form of the Chinese chestnut only\r\none, if any, bur appears at the base of the flowering branch. The dwarf\r\nspecies, _C. seguini_, from eastern and central China, on the other\r\nhand, is most prolific; and in addition, blooms from June to October. It\r\nwill be seen that crosses of these two species may produce valuable\r\nbreeding stock.\" As a result of this cross, made in 1934, we obtained\r\nseven nuts, and from these nuts we have today, nineteen years later,\r\nfour trees, three of which have shown marked blight resistance. One of\r\nthese three is much larger, partaking more in its stature and form of\r\nthe character of its Chinese parent, and in contrast to the latter,\r\nbears burs and nuts in profusion, usually clustered at the ends of the\r\nbranches. (Fig. 2). The nuts are small but of good flavor. It is a good\r\nnut tree, not suitable for timber. However, as we stated in our 1951-2\r\nreport, it is subject to considerable twig blight, caused by the attacks\r\nof the weak parasite, _Cryptodiaporthe castanea_ (Tul.) Wehmeyer, and\r\nthis is due apparently to the influence of its tender parent, the Seguin\r\nchestnut, which habitually dies back in the winter. The parasite easily\r\nenters the dying ends of the twigs. We should like to see this tree\r\ntried out in a warmer climate--Georgia, Florida, Alabama, etc. Possibly\r\nit might prove adaptable to a southern European environment.[5]\r\n\r\n[5] Systematic descriptions of this and other valuable chestnut hybrids\r\nare being prepared for publication.\r\n\r\n\r\nPollen Receptivity of Female Flowers\r\n\r\nChestnut is monecious. The flowers are borne on the present year's\r\ngrowth in long catkins. These are of two distinct types; near the base\r\nof the flowering branch they consist of male flowers only. The catkins\r\nnear the apex, on the other hand, are bisexual; pistillate flowers are\r\nfound, solitary or in clusters of two or three, near the base of this\r\ntype of catkin. The remainder of the catkin bears male flowers similar\r\nto those on the all-male catkins.\r\n\r\nThe unisexual male catkins are the first to start flowering and not\r\nuntil two to three weeks later will the male flowers of the bisexual\r\ncatkins be in full bloom. Normally, the pistillate flowers will reach\r\nfull development sometime between these two periods of pollen shedding.\r\n\r\n_The Length of the Receptivity Period._--During the summer of 1953 an\r\nexperiment was conducted to determine more definitely when the pistils\r\nbecame receptive and how long they remain in this condition. Two\r\nChinese, two Japanese and two hybrid chestnuts of the combination (Jap.\r\nx C. pumila) x Jap., the so-called S8xJ, were used as the females in the\r\nstudy. Emasculation and bagging was done at the beginning of anthesis,\r\nthat is, when the first unisexual male catkins began to shed pollen.\r\nThree different pollen sources were used on each female parent; they\r\nwere of the same species or hybrid combination as the female. The\r\nfollowing diagram shows the pollination schedule used.\r\n\r\n   Pollen source    Time of pollination in days\r\n   No.              after beginning of anthesis\r\n                    5     9     13      17    22\r\n   -----------------------------------------------\r\n   1                X     X      X\r\n   2                      X      X      X\r\n   3                             X      X      X\r\n\r\nFor example, the Chinese female trees were pollinated with pollen from\r\nthree other Chinese trees (in the diagram \"Pollen source No. 1, 2 and\r\n3), which open their anthers on successively later dates. This\r\npollination schedule was used to avoid prolonged storing of the pollen.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Fig. 2. Showing, above, _C. mollissima_, Chinese\r\nchestnut, left, and _C. seguini_, seguin chestnut, right, parents of\r\n_mollissima_ x _seguini_ hybrid below. Note clustered burs in\r\nhybrid--more than twice the number appearing in the _mollissima_ parent.\r\nLeaves and habit of tree resemble more the _mollissima_ parent. About\r\n1/6 natural size.

Sta.,\r\nSept. 25, 1953.]\r\n\r\nTo carry on pollination the bags are removed and the pollen-bearing\r\ncatkins are brushed lightly over the stigmas several times, one or more\r\nfresh catkins being used in each bag. These catkins are left in the bag.\r\nThe bags are then replaced and permanently removed when danger of\r\noutcrossing is eliminated, in this case 10-14 days after the last\r\npollination.\r\n\r\nThe number of nuts collected at the time of harvesting compared with the\r\nnumber of female flowers pollinated was taken as a measure of how\r\nsuccessful the pollinations were.\r\n\r\nThe results showed that five days after the commencement of anthesis a\r\nhigh proportion of the female flowers is receptive. The Japanese and\r\nhybrid trees have a definite peak of the period of receptivity between 9\r\nand 17 days after anthesis begins; thereafter, receptivity drops off\r\nsharply. The data from the Chinese trees indicated that the period of\r\nmaximum receptivity is longer than in the Japanese and hybrid chestnuts\r\ntested. They maintained full receptivity on the 22nd day after the\r\nbeginning of anthesis.\r\n\r\nIt is commonly believed that bagging as well as emasculation may\r\nseriously affect the yield from controlled pollination. This is not\r\nalways the case. One of the Japanese trees and one hybrid tree (S8 x J)\r\nyielded fully as many nuts from controlled (under best conditions) as\r\nfrom open pollination. On all other trees the effect of bagging was more\r\nor less adverse.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Effect of Emasculation on Nut Yield\r\n\r\nEmasculation involves the removal of the unisexual male catkins and the\r\nmale part of the bisexual catkins. In the course of the controlled\r\npollination work it has often been found that the female flowers drop\r\noff in the bag before the burs start to develop. This has especially\r\nbeen encountered in Japanese x American hybrids and back-crosses. It was\r\nthought that this perhaps was due to injuries resulting from\r\nemasculation. The following small experiment was carried out in order to\r\ndetermine if this was actually true.\r\n\r\nA Japanese x American and a Japanese x (Japanese x American) hybrid were\r\nused as the female parents. On these trees some flowering branches were\r\nbagged which had been emasculated normally, on other branches only the\r\nunisexual catkins were removed, while the bisexual catkins were left\r\nintact. Some branches were bagged without any emasculation, and some\r\nflowering branches were just tagged. The number of female flowers was\r\ncounted in all cases. Pollinations were performed 3 times, that is, were\r\nrepeated on the third and fifth day after the first pollination. This is\r\nthe procedure ordinarily used for our controlled pollinations. Chinese\r\npollen was used on both trees. Nut set expressed as per cent of the\r\nnumber of pollinated flowers, times three, (because ordinarily there are\r\n3 nuts in every bur) was taken as a measure of how successful the\r\npollinations had been. The results are shown in Table 2.\r\n\r\n Table II.

There is, however, no evidence that\r\nemasculation in itself causes a decreased nut yield, rather it appears\r\nto be somewhat beneficial if we are to judge from the results of this\r\nexperiment. At least, one would be justified in concluding that any\r\nharmful effect is negligible. Completely emasculated flowers yielded\r\n29.1 and 13.7 per cent as compared to 14.5 and 0.0 per cent where only\r\nunisexual male catkins were removed, and 25.0 and 3.7 per cent where no\r\nemasculation was done. The controls which were not emasculated and not\r\nhand pollinated, show that the trees are practically completely self\r\nsterile; only an occasional nut is set from self-fertilization.\r\n\r\n\r\nVegetative Propagation\r\n\r\nIn vegetative propagation the tree breeder has a very important tool.\r\nFor instance, if a number of desirable phenotypes have been selected in\r\nthe forest, they can be propagated vegetatively and planted under\r\nuniform conditions where it will be possible to \"estimate\" their\r\ngenotype, without the time-consuming progeny testing. Trees propagated\r\nvegetatively from old mature trees usually will start flowering very\r\nsoon after they become established; thus the necessity of doing\r\npollination work in very large trees can be eliminated. Furthermore, it\r\nenables the tree breeders to maintain trees of a desirable genotype\r\nunaltered for an indefinite length of time without first establishing\r\npure lines through inbreeding. Finally, it may be possible to make\r\nvaluable individuals available to the forest owners for field planting\r\nif they can be propagated vegetatively in large enough numbers at low\r\ncost.\r\n\r\nCompared to propagation by grafting, the rooting of cuttings is both\r\nsimpler and cheaper, if it can be done. Chestnut cuttings are,\r\nunfortunately, very difficult to root. In the past six years numerous\r\nexperiments have been conducted in order to find a way to root the\r\nvarious chestnut species. We have tried to root dormant, as well as\r\ngreenwood, cuttings, the conventional twig cuttings as well as leaf-bud\r\ncuttings; numerous hormone treatments using several different hormones\r\nin solution and as powders, over a wide range of concentrations, have\r\nbeen tried; a special chamber in which an automatic atomizer nozzle\r\nsprays the cuttings intermittently has been used. Results have always\r\nbeen poor. Dormant cuttings have broken dormancy, sent out new leaves,\r\nformed an abundance of callus on the basal end, but failed to develop\r\nany roots, and finally after several months have died. Greenwood\r\ncuttings also have failed to develop roots in almost all cases. The best\r\nresults have been obtained with leaf-bud cuttings. In some cases 10 to\r\n20 per cent have rooted; here, however, the difficulty has been the\r\nfailure of the bud to break dormancy and start growth, and all the\r\nrooted cuttings have eventually died.\r\n\r\nThe rooting by airlayering has been tried in a few cases. Airlayering is\r\nthe rooting of twigs while they are still attached to the tree. Some\r\ndistance from the terminal end of the twig an oblique cut is made, or\r\nthe bark is removed around the twig for about 3/4\". The cut or ringed\r\narea is treated with a hormone powder, wrapped in sphagnum moss and\r\ncovered with a wrapping of polyethelene. Attempts to root twigs on older\r\ntrees by this method have so far failed. Recently successful rooting of\r\ntwigs on young seedlings by airlayering has been reported from Spain,\r\nand from France comes the report that stooling of young seedlings is\r\nhighly successful. In the stooling method the young plants are cut off a\r\nshort distance above the ground level. As new shoots grow out, their\r\nbasal ends are gradually covered with soil until a 5-6\" mound has been\r\nformed. Left in this manner they may develop their own root system and\r\ncan eventually be detached from the mother root. That the rooting of\r\nyoung seedling material should be possible, while that from older trees\r\nwill not root, is not unusual. It is generally accepted that the younger\r\nthe tree from which the cuttings are taken, the easier the cuttings are\r\nto root. Experiments along these lines are planned for 1954.\r\n\r\n\r\nCooperative Hybrid Chestnut Plantations\r\n\r\nIn last year's report we described our hybrid test plots established in\r\ncooperation with the U.S.D.A., Bureau of Plant Industry, Division of\r\nForest Pathology.\r\n\r\nOn March 18, 1953 a new plantation was started at Grafton, West\r\nVirginia. As usual, we furnished 50 plants for this test plot.\r\n\r\nFrom the reports from Dr. J. D. Diller, of the then Division of Forest\r\nPathology, our hybrids so far have shown a promising performance,\r\nalthough their average growth rate so far is slightly slower than that\r\nof the U.S.D.A. hybrids and straight Chinese chestnut. From the\r\nstandpoint of blight resistance and growth habit they are at least equal\r\nto the two other sources and may be slightly better; however, it is\r\nstill too early to make any definite evaluation of the results.\r\n\r\n\r\nInsect Injuries\r\n\r\nThe most damaging insect pests in the Sleeping Giant Plantation are the\r\nspring canker worms, the mites (_Paratetranychus bicolor_), Japanese\r\nbeetles and the chestnut weevils.\r\n\r\nA spraying schedule has now been worked out which keeps these pests\r\nunder control:\r\n\r\n1. Dormant spray with \"Scalecide\" in middle April against the canker\r\nworms and mites.\r\n\r\n2. Two applications of \"Aramite\" (6-7 lbs. per acre) in the middle and\r\ntoward the end of June. These sprayings have given good control against\r\nmites. Where the outbreak is very severe it may be necessary to spray\r\nwith \"Aramite\" also in July and again in August.\r\n\r\n3. Spraying with DDT in middle August and the first week in September\r\nhas controlled the weevils successfully.\r\n\r\nIn concluding this report we desire to express our thanks to the many\r\ninterested persons who have contributed pollen, nuts and/or scions to\r\nfurther this project.\r\n\r\n\r\nDr. W. C. Deming\r\n\r\nOn November 17th, 1910, twelve dreamers met in the Botanical Museum,\r\nBronx Park, New York City, to form an organization of nut growers in the\r\nnorth. It was largely an organizational meeting. No papers were read,\r\nbut some solid foundations were laid. Dr. W. C. Deming served as\r\ntemporary chairman of the meeting and, fortunately for the cause, was\r\nthen elected as the new body's Secretary-Treasurer, an office which has\r\nalways called for executive ability and untiring industry.\r\n\r\nThis election paid off. At the second meeting, held at the New York\r\nState College of Agriculture, in Ithaca, it appeared that the new\r\nSecretary had communicated with a large number of leading nurserymen,\r\nwith national and State horticulturists and with others. It was reported\r\nat this meeting that only two nurserymen had accepted the invitation to\r\nattend. \"So\", reported Secretary Deming, \"evidently the others do not\r\nthink the northern nut grower is one whose acquaintance is worth\r\ncultivating. We hope to convince them to the contrary.\"\r\n\r\nThis was done. At the second meeting, the Association could count sixty\r\nmembers. Professor John Craig, of Cornell, in noting this growth, said,\r\n\"Dr. Deming has not merely performed the routine duties of the\r\nsecretary, but he has studied the case and has presented a good many\r\nfacts not apparent on the surface. It seems to me that this augurs\r\nwell.\"\r\n\r\nThe augury proved prophetic. The Association continued to grow. But\r\nwithout this first intelligent, persistent effort upon the part of. Dr.\r\nDeming, it could hardly have survived.\r\n\r\nThis small bit of history is illustrative of the whole life of Dr.\r\nDeming. His deep interest in the purposes and hopes of our Association\r\nhas never ceased. Upon his own ground he planted, and budded and\r\ngrafted many nut trees, and has given away the fruits of his labors with\r\na prodigal good will. Deming's Burnham pecan and the Deming Purple black\r\nwalnut are the only introductions, so far as this writer knows, which\r\nbear his name.\r\n\r\nAgain, some thirty years after the first meeting mentioned above, Dr.\r\nDeming thought up and carried through another project which makes the\r\nAssociation repeatedly his debtor, an Index of the first thirty volumes\r\nof the Association's Annual Reports. It is a work which saves the\r\nconscientious worker in northern nut culture hours and hours of labor.\r\n\r\nAnd now our Dean, the last of the founding fathers, has left us for the\r\nElysian Fields. His gentle, kindly face will be sadly missed by those\r\nwho knew him, but he lives on in every tree whose planting his labors\r\ninspired and in every mind which has been, even unconsciously, his heir.\r\n\r\nA letter from Miss Charlotte Deming, a sister, assures us, somewhat\r\ntouchingly, but happily, of this fact:\r\n\r\n\"My brother's heart was with and in the work of the Association. He was\r\nhappy to know of its expansion into such a wide-spread organization, and\r\nvery proud of having been made its Dean.\"\r\n\r\nDr. Deming lived a full life. He was a physician of distinction, a\r\ngraduate of Columbia University's College of Physicians and Surgeons and\r\nwas retired from the army after World War I with the rank of Major.\r\nAfter graduation from Columbia, he served his internship in a New York\r\nhospital, then on the medical staff of the State Immigrant Hospital,\r\nWard's Island. He began private practice in Westchester County, New York\r\nand, later, for many years, served as examining physician with the\r\nVeterans' Administration in Hartford, Connecticut.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to know, as told by his son, Hawthorne, that Mrs.\r\nDeming, formerly Imogene Hawthorne, was the youngest granddaughter of\r\nthe immortal Nathaniel. It is evident that Dr. Deming, both in private\r\nlife and in his public interests, was a strong believer in the value of\r\ngood blood-lines.\r\n\r\n   _John Davidson_\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Nomenclature of Nut Varieties\r\n\r\nGEORGE H. M. LAWRENCE, _Bailey Hortorium, Ithaca, N. Y._\r\n\r\n\r\nThis article is intended to introduce to you the International Code of\r\nNomenclature for Cultivated Plants[6] and to point out the ways in which\r\nthat Code serves the interests and needs of members of the Northern Nut\r\nGrowers Association.\r\n\r\n[6] The International Code of Nomenclature for Cultivated Plants,\r\nformulated and adopted by the International Botanical Congress Committee\r\nfor the Nomenclature of Cultivated Plants and the International\r\nCommittee on Horticultural Nomenclature and Registration at the\r\nThirteenth International Horticultural Congress, London, September 1952.\r\n\r\nCopies of the full text of the Code are available from the Secretary,\r\nAmerican Horticultural Council, Inc., Bailey Hortorium, Cornell\r\nUniversity, Ithaca, N. Y., (25c postpaid).\r\n\r\nThe Code as published by the Royal Horticultural Society is a booklet of\r\nabout 30 pages, containing an excellent historical introduction by W. T.\r\nStearn, a summary or abridged version of the Code, and the full text. It\r\nis of necessity somewhat technical in its phraseology, and in places its\r\njargon is overwhelming. Recently, Dr. John S. L. Gilmour, Director of\r\nthe Cambridge Botanic Gardens, and formerly Director of the R. H. S.\r\nTrial Gardens at Wisley, published a very lucid and down-to-earth\r\ninterpretation of the principle provisions of the Code. It is reproduced\r\nwith permission at the conclusion of this introduction.\r\n\r\nThe questions asked about the Code include,\r\n\r\n   \"What's it got that earlier codes did not have?\"\r\n   \"What's new about it?\"\r\n   \"How does it affect me?\"\r\n\r\nThere are several answers to the first query, but the most significant\r\nis that here for the first time we have a Code that represents the\r\nthinking of horticulturists from all leading horticultural centers of\r\nthe world. I was a member of a committee of thirteen (representing 6\r\ncountries), that met for nine days in Stockholm in 1950 to prepare and\r\nedit the first international draft of this Code. Those of each\r\nnationality had met in their country previously, with their own leaders,\r\nand had come to this round-table session with fixed ideas of what they\r\nwanted. By mid-evening of the first session it became apparent that the\r\nSwedes, the Dutch, the British, and the Americans had sent some of their\r\nmost persuasive, vocative, and determined countrymen to represent them.\r\nThe Swiss representative restrained himself admirably until after the\r\ninitial lines had been drawn. It looked then as if there might be\r\nseveral codes, but before recessing several hours later some concessions\r\nhad been made, and discussion on the more volatile points had been\r\ndeferred. The differences of opinion were well founded and held with\r\ngood reason. Some reflected an unawareness of situations in an unrelated\r\nhorticultural field, e.g., a nurseryman did not know the problems\r\nencountered by the Danes in developing so-called varieties of\r\nvegetables, or by the American in producing hybrid-corn--each calling\r\nfor different provisions in the Code, nor could the rose specialist be\r\nexpected to comprehend the genetic situations encountered in many types\r\nof hybridity. One botanist in the group had no appreciation of the\r\nintricacies of problems and situations found when trying to name some\r\ncomplex groups of cultigens. Add to these reasons the fact that most of\r\nthese men were representatives or spokesmen for larger groups or\r\nnational organizations \"back home\" and were not authorized to act\r\nindependently from earlier decisions by those groups, and one can only\r\nmarvel that at the end of the 9-day period we came up with a detailed\r\nand workable draft accepted unanimously, and which was modified in no\r\nmajor respect at the more recently International Horticultural Congress\r\nin London.\r\n\r\nThe period between the Stockholm meeting and the London Congress was\r\nutilized to distribute mimeographed copies of the Stockholm draft to\r\nhorticultural leaders in all countries, to provide opportunity for\r\nsuggesting changes and new provisions for the Code, and to hold one\r\ncommittee meeting of international level, at London in November 1951.\r\nAs a result, the present Code is the first truly international\r\nregulating guide that has been produced as an aid to persons concerned\r\nwith the nomenclature of cultivated plants. The individual who may\r\nobject to some provision of the Code must remember that its presence in\r\nthe Code has had the support of scores of specialists, representing no\r\nless than 16 nations and that there is no part of the Code that was not\r\nacceptable to a majority of the delegates of each nation and to the\r\ngroups representing them. The significance of this international\r\ncharacter of the Code is not to be discounted.\r\n\r\nIt is only proper at this point to tell you how the U. S. A. was\r\nrepresented at the International Horticultural Congress in London.\r\nPractically every country except the United States has a national\r\nhorticultural organization, comparable in some respects to the Royal\r\nHorticultural Society, with which you are surely familiar. This country\r\nhad none. When the \"call\" went out for representatives and delegates to\r\nthe International Horticultural Congress, that for this country was\r\ndelivered to the agricultural attache at our Embassy in London. It is\r\nreported that he referred it to his home office and attended some\r\npreliminary meetings in London. The matter was referred to the U. S.\r\nDepartment of Agriculture in Washington and there sat, apparently, for\r\nmonths. In the interim, private communications were flying across the\r\nAtlantic in both directions between interested horticulturists and\r\nfinally the matter was referred by the Honorable Secretary of the\r\nCongress direct to American societies of horticulture to ensure that\r\nAmerican views and interests would be adequately represented. It boiled\r\ndown to the United States being represented by those persons who were\r\ngoing to be at the Congress anyway and by men who were not specialists\r\nin nomenclatural matters. Appraised of their lot, these persons made\r\nevery effort to be briefed and informed on as many aspects of the\r\nprovisions of the proposed Code as possible. As stated later by Dr. S.\r\nL. Emsweller (a member of the committee, representing U. S. D. A. and\r\nthe American Society for Horticultural Science), this situation brought\r\ninto sharp focus the need in this country for a single horticultural\r\norganization of organizations that could serve as authorized in matters\r\nat the international level. The American Horticultural Council, to which\r\nthe Northern Nut Growers Association belongs may become that\r\norganization, but only when authorized by its membership.\r\n\r\nMany readers may be familiar with earlier codes, as that adopted by the\r\nAmerican Pomological Society (which dates from 1847), that by the\r\nAmerican Society of Agronomists (formulated in 1917-18), and with a\r\nthird code adopted at the sessions of the Botanical Congress meeting in\r\nCambridge, England, in 1935. Knowing of the provisions of these codes,\r\nyou may ask, \"What has the new one got that is different?\" There are\r\nmany new features of which the more significant are given below.\r\n\r\nPerhaps foremost is the recognition that, for the most part, the\r\nso-called varieties of garden plants are not uniform in their behavior.\r\nSome are nothing more than transplants of variations found in the wild,\r\nsuch as the Japanese _Juglans Sieboldiana_ var. _cordiformis_, a\r\npopulation having its own geographic range and distinguished from the\r\ntypical element of the species by several morphological characters. It\r\nis a botanical variety that is cultivated. It is not a product of\r\ndomestication.\r\n\r\nThe code distinguishes from this botanical variety those so-called\r\nvarieties that are the result of domestication, variants that have been\r\nproduced in cultivation but are not known to occur and perpetuate\r\nthemselves in the wild, such as Schwedler's maple known as _Acer\r\nPlatanoides_ var. _Schwedleri_. Plants of this group, that may be grown\r\nfrom seed and which do show a limited variability, are distinguished\r\nfrom botanical varieties by placing them in a new category called\r\ncultivar (a name coined long ago by L. H. Bailey and meaning, a variety\r\nfrom cultivation). The abbreviation for the category is cv. Furthermore,\r\nin an effort to differentiate cultivar names from botanical names, it is\r\nprovided that they be treated as are vernacular or fancy (common) names.\r\nThat is, that the name be placed in single quotes and not italicized\r\ne.g., _Acer Platanoides_ cv. 'Schwedleri'.\r\n\r\nA third category is that of clone. A clone is an individual propagated\r\nnot from seeds but by asexual means, as by grafting, budding, cuttings,\r\netc. Most so-called varieties of nuts are clones. A clone may be\r\nselected from a species population, from a botanical variety, from a\r\ncultivar, or from anyone of several types of hybrid complexes. It may\r\nappear as a mutant of another clone. The name for it may, where there is\r\nneed for precision, be attached to the name of the species (or hybrid)\r\nfrom which it was selected, as _Corylus Avellana_ cl. 'DuChilly' or\r\nreduced to _Corylus_ cl. 'DuChilly.'\r\n\r\nFor the hybridizer naming and introducing new hybrids to cultivation,\r\nthe Code is more helpful than any previous set of rules and the needs of\r\nhybridizers of various groups have been considered. Many examples\r\nillustrating application of each provision are given in the unabridged\r\nversion.\r\n\r\nThe person naming plants will find much helpful guidance with regard to\r\nthe selection of names which should be considered if international usage\r\nis to prevail. The Code is just that, a set of dicta provided for\r\nguidance by horticulturists throughout the world that there may\r\nprevail\r\n\r\n   a greater uniformity, accuracy, and fixity of names,\r\n   a lessening of procedures that would lead to confusion and error if\r\n       adequately supported or widely adopted, and\r\n   a provision for change and revision.\r\n\r\nOne section of the code (\"C\") dealing with Registration might well come\r\nwithin the framework of interest and activity of the Northern Nut\r\nGrowers Association. This section, which suffers materially by\r\ncondensation in the abbreviated text that follows, occupies nearly a\r\npage in the unabridged edition. It envisages the establishment of an\r\ninternational registering body, with headquarters for different groups\r\nlocated in different countries, e.g., that for tulips in the\r\nNetherlands, for rhododendrons in Britain, for roses in the United\r\nStates, etc. The task of compiling, maintaining, and publishing such a\r\nregistrar (and rejecting names not in conformance with the Code) will\r\nfall in many cases on the special plant societies concerned. When\r\nsocieties for a given group of plants exist in 2 or more countries, they\r\nwill be expected to collaborate. Insofar as I know the Northern Nut\r\nGrowers Association has not set up any mechanism for the registration of\r\nnames given to cultivars, hybrids, and clones of nuts. To do so would be\r\nto perform a very real service for your membership, for the industry in\r\nthis country, and would place the Association in a key spot when the\r\nproposal for an international registry is activated. The agitation for\r\nthis phase of international application of the Code is considerable and\r\nis more evident in Europe than here. If the Association takes an active\r\nstand in the matter and develops a center of registry of nut names for\r\nthis continent, it may very well display a quality of initiative and\r\nservice that will make it pre-eminent on the international level and\r\nwill cause others to look to it for guidance, information, and\r\nleadership.\r\n\r\nA careful consideration of this Code is commended to all and those\r\ninterested in the topic are urged to procure a copy of the booklet\r\ngiving the unabridged edition and Stearn's excellent historical account\r\nof the subject.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe New Code For the Naming of Cultivated Plants[7]\r\n\r\n[7] Reproduced with permission from Journal of the Royal Horticultural\r\nSociety, vol. 69, pp. 12-21, 1954.\r\n\r\n\r\nJ. S. L. GILMOUR, _Chairman of the International Committee on\r\nHorticultural Nomenclature and Registration_\r\n\r\n\r\nAnyone who deals in any way with cultivated plants uses plant names.\r\nThis glimpse of the obvious ought to mean that the appearance of a new\r\nCode for the naming of cultivated plants should be a memorable event for\r\nall gardeners. I say \"ought to mean\" advisedly, because there is no\r\ndoubt that, in the past, Codes of Nomenclature have made little appeal\r\nto gardeners, the great majority of whom have been blissfully unaware of\r\ntheir existence. As a consequence, many horticulturists--on hearing of\r\n\"a new Code\"--will, no doubt, raise a respectful (or contemptuous)\r\neyebrow and get on with reading their latest catalogue. The aim of this\r\narticle is to persuade readers of the Society's JOURNAL, not only that\r\nthis attitude is against their own interests, but that a good deal of\r\nquiet entertainment can be extracted from trying to use plant names\r\ncorrectly--if only the entertainment of putting their neighbour right!\r\n\r\nIt is true that, hitherto, there has been ample excuse for ignorance.\r\nAlthough Codes for the naming of cultivated plants have existed, in some\r\nshape or form, for nearly 100 years, they have been printed in obscure\r\npublications, quite inaccessible to ordinary mortals. This excuse no\r\nlonger holds. The full text, plus a summary, of the new Code can be\r\npurchased for one shilling and three pence (post free) from the Society,\r\nand, in addition, reference to it has been made in many horticultural\r\nand other periodicals. What, then, is the new Code about, how does it\r\naffect gardeners, and what should they do about it?\r\n\r\nIn the first place it is _not_ about the Latin names of wild species or\r\nvarieties--names like _Rhododendron ponticum_ and _Aesculus octandra_\r\nvar. _vestita_. Whether wild plants are grown in gardens or not, their\r\nLatin names are governed by quite a separate Code, devised by botanists\r\nfor the purpose. It is true, of course, that gardeners have to use Latin\r\nnames for many of the wild plants that they grow, and equally true,\r\nunfortunately, that the frequent changes in these names are a source of\r\nannoyance to everyone; but that is quite another story, with which we\r\nare not concerned here. At the last International Horticultural Congress\r\nsteps were taken which we all hope will result, with the cooperation of\r\nbotanists, in the stabilization of widely used Latin names of cultivated\r\nplants.\r\n\r\nNo, the new Code deals, not with wild species, varieties and hybrids,\r\nbut with what are commonly called \"garden varieties\"--namely, forms\r\nwhich have been brought into existence by selection, hybridization, or\r\nother similar processes devised by man, and are maintained in\r\ncultivation as clones or pure lines by man's care and skill--such plants\r\nas Rose 'Peace,' Apple 'Beauty of Bath,' and thousands of others. The\r\ndistinction between \"wild\" plants and \"garden varieties\" is not\r\nabsolutely clear cut, and in the Code a closer definition is\r\nattempted--but for our present purpose the difference is obvious enough.\r\n\r\nIn the Code, it is recommended that \"garden varieties\" should\r\ntechnically be called \"cultivars.\" This has been their official name for\r\nmany years and it is clearly desirable, if the two categories of \"wild\"\r\nand \"cultivated\" varieties are to be recognized, to have a short and\r\ninternationally current word for each of them. \"Variety\" and \"cultivar\"\r\nserve this purpose admirably, but it is not to be expected that all\r\ngardeners will make the distinction and adopt the word \"cultivar\" in\r\nordinary parlance, at any rate immediately. Personally, however, I hope\r\nand believe that eventually \"cultivar\" will find favour. It is a clear\r\nand easily understood word and will, I think, prove useful to those\r\ngardeners who care for accuracy and precision in their craft, and\r\nespecially to those who have dealings with fellow-gardeners in other\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nThe Code, then, deals with the _names of cultivars_. It may be helpful,\r\nI think, to consider its rules and regulations under three headings:\r\nfirstly, those of interest to all gardeners who have occasion to write\r\nthe names of cultivars; secondly, those which are concerned with the\r\ncoining of new names; and thirdly, those more technical provisions which\r\nare of interest primarily to horticulturists studying a particular group\r\nand trying to establish what are the correct names for its cultivars.\r\n\r\n\r\n1. The Writing of Cultivar-Names\r\n\r\nThe most important point, perhaps, concerning the names of cultivars is\r\nthat they should not be in Latin, but in any modern language using the\r\nso-called Roman alphabet (_i.e._ the alphabet in which English, French,\r\nGerman, etc., are written). The reason for this is, of course, to\r\ndistinguish, at a glance, names of cultivars from names of wild\r\nvarieties, which are in Latin. In the future, Latin names for cultivars\r\nwill definitely not be allowed by the Code, but we are faced with the\r\n_fait accompli_ of hundreds of existing Latin names which have been\r\nwidely used for many years. For example: the dwarf conifers abound with\r\ncultivars called 'nana,' 'prostrata,' 'compacta' and the like, and such\r\nnames as 'albus,' 'variegatus,' and 'plenus' occur in almost every\r\ncultivated genus. It would clearly be foolish to try to alter all these,\r\nand the Code accepts such legacies from the past as permanently with us.\r\n(As we shall see, however, a distinction is made between the writing of\r\nLatin cultivar-names and Latin varietal-names.)\r\n\r\nThe vast majority, then, of cultivar-names are vernacular or \"fancy\"\r\nnames like 'Winston Churchill.' How should the full name of a cultivar\r\nbe written? The complete and technically correct form, including the\r\nLatin name of the species from which the cultivar has been derived, is\r\nillustrated in the following example: _Sedum spectabile_ Boreau, cv.\r\n'Brilliant,' but I hasten to add that this lengthy designation is for\r\nuse only on full-dress occasions! In the example, _Sedum_ is the name of\r\nthe genus, _spectabile_ the name of the species (technically called the\r\n\"specific epithet\"), Boreau the name of the man who first described the\r\nspecies under that name (technically called \"the authority\" for the\r\nname), cv. the abbreviation of cultivar, and 'Brilliant' the\r\ncultivar-name for the particular cultivar concerned. It should be noted\r\n(1) that the generic name and specific epithet are printed in italics,\r\n(2) that the cultivar-name begins with a capital letter, is printed in\r\nordinary Roman type, and is enclosed in _single_ quotation marks, and\r\n(3) that there is no \"authority\" after the cultivar-name. These three\r\npoints are important, and apply to the writing of all names of\r\ncultivars. If we wish to cut down this rather formidable string of words\r\nfor every-day use, the authority can be omitted in all except very\r\ntechnical writing. Secondly, the abbreviation cv. can normally be left\r\nout, as the vernacular form, single quotes, and Roman type of\r\n'Brilliant' indicate quite clearly that it is a cultivar-name, and not\r\nthe name of a wild variety. In this shortened form, therefore, the name\r\nwould read simply:\r\n\r\n   _Sedum spectabile_ 'Brilliant'\r\n\r\nand this is the normal method of writing the names of cultivars.\r\n\r\nThere are, however, two additional refinements that should be\r\nmentioned--apart from the special case of cultivars derived from\r\nhybrids, which I will deal with later. The first concerns those Latin\r\ncultivar-names which are left over from the past. These should be\r\nprinted in Roman type and enclosed in single quotes to distinguish them\r\nfrom Latin varietal names; thus one would write _Thuja orientalis_\r\n'elegantissima,' where 'elegantissima' is a cultivar-name, but _Aesculus\r\noctandra_ var. _vestita_, where _vestita_ is the name of a wild variety.\r\n\r\nThe second point refers to the omission of any authority after a\r\ncultivar-name. Many cultivars are first described in reports of trials,\r\nin catalogues, and other anonymous publications; this makes the quoting\r\nof an authority impractical, but there is provision in the Code for\r\nwriting the raiser's or introducer's name in brackets after the\r\ncultivar-name if so desired, thus: _Weigela_ 'Avalanche' (Lemoine).\r\n\r\n\r\n2. Naming New Cultivars\r\n\r\n_General_\r\n\r\nLet us suppose that a nurseryman, park superintendent, or amateur\r\ngardener has just flowered a batch of seedlings of, say, _Helenium_,\r\nand that he spots one as being of a new type and worthy of propagation.\r\nIn due course he shows the plant at a fortnightly show, under a number,\r\nand an Award of Merit is given to it. He must now find a cultivar-name\r\nfor his new plant. His first problem, of course, is to choose a name\r\nthat has not been used before in the genus _Helenium_. If he picks on a\r\nvery unusual personal name he can be fairly certain that he is the first\r\nto use it. If, however, he prefers a more general name, like 'Innocence'\r\nor 'Venus,' there is a danger that it has been used before. If there\r\nexisted a registration authority for _Helenium_ names, as there does,\r\nfor example, for names of Daffodils, he could, of course, consult this\r\nauthority, but in its absence he must do his best to comb the likely\r\nliterature--for example the Index to this JOURNAL, nurserymen's\r\ncatalogues, etc.--and to assure himself that his chosen name has not\r\nalready been used. His next step is to make certain that the name is in\r\naccordance with the best practice for coining such names. Here is where\r\nthe Code will help him. In it he will find (under Section F) a series of\r\nrules for his guidance, based on the accumulated experience of\r\nhorticulturists of many nations. I will not repeat these rules\r\nhere--they can be read in the Code--but perhaps the most important,\r\napart from the rule already quoted that the name must not be in Latin,\r\nis that it should be short (not more than two words), should avoid forms\r\nof address liable to be confused (_e.g._ Mr., Mrs. and Miss) and, as far\r\nas possible, should be easily pronounceable by all nationalities. As the\r\nCode says, 'Centenaire de Rozain-Bourcharlat,'\r\n'Diplomagartenbauinspektor,' and 'Eldwyth Cholmondeley' are not looked\r\nupon with favour as cultivar-names! Having chosen a name, it is\r\nessential to ensure that it is published, together with an adequate\r\ndescription, since the Code does not recognize names that are not\r\npublished, or are published with no description. The Code lays down what\r\nis meant by publication, and by adequate description. The names of\r\nplants which receive an Award at Vincent Square are automatically\r\npublished, with a description, in this JOURNAL, but for other methods of\r\npublication the Code should be consulted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hybrids_\r\n\r\nThe naming of cultivars derived from crosses between two or more\r\ndifferent species, belonging to the same or different genera, involves\r\nrather special problems. By \"derived from\" I mean not only the _first_\r\ngeneration from a species cross, but all subsequent generations and\r\nback-crosses with the original parents or with members of the first or\r\nlater generations. Any cultivar which is the progeny of a species cross,\r\nhowever remote, comes, for the purpose of the Code, under the heading of\r\na hybrid and its naming is subject to definite rules. The full name of a\r\n\"hybrid cultivar\" must be regarded as consisting of three distinct\r\nparts: (1) the name of the genus (or \"hybrid genus\" if a hybrid between\r\ntwo or more genera is concerned); (2) a \"collective\" name or phrase\r\ncovering _all_ the progeny resulting from the particular species-cross\r\nconcerned; and (3) a cultivar-name for the particular form (cultivar)\r\nunder consideration. In the name _Viburnum_ x _bodnantense_ 'Dawn,'\r\n_Viburnum_ is the generic name, x _bodnantense_ is the collective name\r\nfor all progeny of the cross _V. fragans_ x _V. grandiflorum_, and\r\n'Dawn' is the cultivar-name for a particular seedling of this\r\nparentage. It is essential always to bear in mind these three distinct\r\nparts of the name of a garden hybrid, even if, as it often done, one or\r\nother of the parts is omitted in actual usage; the three parts broadly\r\ncorrespond, of course, to the generic name, specific epithet, and\r\ncultivar-name of a non-hybrid cultivar (see above).\r\n\r\nLet us consider these three parts in turn and see what types of name can\r\nbe used in each part in actual practice--and how this affects the naming\r\nof new \"hybrid cultivars.\"\r\n\r\nThe _first part_, the generic name, presents no difficulties, except in\r\nthe case of new hybrids between two or more genera. Names of such\r\n\"hybrid genera\" are usually \"manufactured\" from a combination of the\r\nnames of the parent genera (_e.g._ x _Heucherella_, from _Heuchera_ and\r\n_Tiarella_); in the case of hybrids between more than two genera,\r\nhowever, where a \"combination\" name would be unwieldy, it is permissible\r\nto make a new name by adding the termination _ara_ to the name of a\r\nperson connected with the plant concerned (_e.g._ x _Sanderara_ for a\r\ntri-generic orchid hybrid). Before making a new \"hybrid generic\" name, a\r\nbotanist should be consulted, as a Latin description in proper,\r\nbotanical form must be provided. It will have been noticed that a\r\nmultiplication sign is placed _in front of_ the names of \"hybrid\r\ngenera,\" but _after_ the generic name in the case of hybrids within a\r\nsingle genus; further details on this point are given later.\r\n\r\nThe _second part_ of the full name of a hybrid is a more tricky\r\nbusiness. It is, as I have said, a collective designation for all the\r\nprogeny of the particular cross concerned, and it may take one or all of\r\nthree possible forms:--\r\n\r\n(1) If the parentage is known, a bare _formula_ consisting of the names\r\nof the parents, in alphabetical order, connected with a multiplication\r\nsign, _e.g._ _Lewisia cotyledon_ x _rediviva_.\r\n\r\n(2) A name in Latin form (corresponding to a non-hybrid specific\r\nepithet), preceded by a multiplication sign, _e.g._ _Viburnum_ x\r\n_bodnantense_.\r\n\r\n(3) A vernacular phrase containing the word \"hybrid,\" \"cross,\" \"grex\"\r\n(Latin for flock or group), or other similar word, making evident the\r\ncollective nature of the phrase, _e.g._ _Lilium_ 'Bellingham Hybrids.'\r\n\r\nWhy do we have to have these three different forms for the second part\r\nof the full name, and when, to put it briefly, should we use which?\r\n\r\nI must admit that practice on this particular point is as yet by no\r\nmeans fixed, and no doubt it will be modified considerably during the\r\nnext few years, as more horticulturists try to apply the Code to the\r\ngroups in which they are interested.\r\n\r\nIn order to understand the alternatives available, it will be helpful, I\r\nthink, to consider first the _third part_ of the full name, as the use\r\nof this, and of the second part, are very closely connected. The third\r\npart, as I have said, is a cultivar-name of a particular form of the\r\nhybrid concerned, and, in the first place, it is extremely important to\r\nrealize that _every cultivated hybrid that is considered worth naming at\r\nall should receive a cultivar-name from the outset of its \"career,\"\r\neven_ _if, at the time, only one form is known, or is considered worth\r\nnaming._ To take an actual example, at the time when the new hybrid\r\n_Viburnum_ x _bodnantense_ was described in the _Botanical Magazine_,\r\nonly one form, or clone, of it had been \"put into circulation,\" and yet\r\nthat single clone was given a cultivar-name, 'Dawn.' The object of doing\r\nthis was to be able, in the future, to refer by name to this particular\r\nclone and so avoid confusion with any later, and possibly inferior,\r\nforms of the same cross that might be produced. In the absence of the\r\nname 'Dawn,' less desirable clones could legitimately be passed off\r\nunder the collective name _V_. x _bodnantense_ without the acquirer\r\nrealising that he was not getting the original and superior form.\r\n\r\nBearing in mind, then, the principle that _all_ cultivated hybrids\r\nshould have a third part, cultivar-name, we can turn again to the use of\r\nthe various possible designations for the second part listed above. The\r\nchoice of designations depends, broadly speaking, on _convenience_, that\r\nis to say, on what, in practice, will be found the most useful method of\r\nreferring to the plants concerned. In principle, of course, every hybrid\r\nwhose parentage is known has an appropriate formula-designation, and in\r\ncertain cases such a formula would be sufficient as a second part\r\ndesignation without inventing either a Latin name or a vernacular\r\ncollective name. For instance, when there are only a very few forms of a\r\nparticular cross, it might not be considered necessary to be able to\r\nrefer to the forms collectively, and a second part name would not then\r\nbe given. For example, _Rubus_ 'Merton Thornless,' when raised, was the\r\nonly form of the hybrid _R. rusticanus inermis_ x _thyrsiger_ to be put\r\ninto circulation, and it was not given a second part designation other\r\nthan the appropriate formula. On the whole, however, it is usually\r\ndesirable to have a second part, collective designation, rather than a\r\nformula only. Whether such designation should be a Latin name or a\r\nvernacular phrase, or both, depends on a number of factors which, as I\r\nhave said, are not yet fully worked out or appreciated. Broadly\r\nspeaking, if there are a large number of cultivars of a particular cross\r\nand these cultivars form a well-marked group, distinct from other hybrid\r\ngroups in the genus, it is useful to have a vernacular designation for\r\ngeneral use, _e.g._ 'Bellingham Hybrids' for all cultivars of the cross\r\n_Lilium Humboldtii_ x _pardalinum_. This purpose can, however, be\r\nequally well served by a Latin name, _e.g. Camellia_ x _Williamsii_ for\r\nall cultivars of the cross _C. japonica_ x _saluenensis_. Whichever\r\nmethod is chosen, two points are of great importance. Firstly, if a\r\nLatin name is given, it _must_ be accompanied by a Latin description.\r\nSecondly a vernacular designation _must_ contain some such word as\r\nHybrids, Crosses, or the like, to distinguish it from a cultivar-name.\r\nThe practice, in some groups, of giving \"straight\" cultivar-names as\r\nsecond part collective designations, followed by \"var. so-and-so,\" is\r\ncondemned by the Code. Existing names of this kind, however, can easily\r\nbe brought into line by adding a word such as Hybrids or Grex to the\r\nold, second part, cultivar-name, and omitting the \"var.\" thus,\r\n_Cattleya_ 'Fabia' var. 'Prince of Wales,' would become _C._ ('Fabia\r\nGrex') 'Prince of Wales' (Grex can he abbreviated to G. if desired).\r\nThis alteration may seem over-pedantic, but if, in the naming of\r\ncultivated hybrids, a clear distinction is not kept between second and\r\nthird part names, confusion, as I have pointed out, is likely to result.\r\n\r\nI will finish this section on the naming of hybrids with one or two\r\nadditional points on the correct method of writing their names. Here are\r\nthe full names of three cultivated hybrids:--\r\n\r\n   _Rubus_ (_rusticanus inermis_ X _thyrsiger_) 'Merton Thornless.'\r\n   _Camellia_ X _Williamsii_ 'Donation.'\r\n   Rose (Hybrid Tea) 'Richmond.'\r\n\r\nThe following points should be noted:--\r\n\r\n(_a_) If a formula or a vernacular designation is used as a second part\r\nname, it should be placed in brackets between the generic name and the\r\ncultivar-name.\r\n\r\n(_b_) If a Latin name is used as a second part name, and the hybrid is\r\nbetween plants belonging to the same genus, a multiplication sign should\r\nbe placed between it and the generic name.\r\n\r\n(_c_) The third part cultivar-name follows directly on the second part\r\nname and is placed in single quotes, as for cultivar-names of\r\nnon-hybrids.\r\n\r\nIn many contexts it would not be necessary to write the second part name\r\nat all, but if it is omitted, the cultivar-name, strictly speaking,\r\nshould be preceded by a multiplication sign, thus: _Camellia_ X\r\n'Donation,' but it would be no great crime to omit it, except perhaps in\r\ntechnical publications.\r\n\r\n\r\n3. What Is the \"Correct\" Name for a Cultivar?\r\n\r\nIt is a painfully familiar fact that many cultivars are known by more\r\nthan one name, and that many cultivar-names have been applied to more\r\nthan one cultivar--although the position is not so bad as it is in the\r\ncase of botanical names! This multiplication of names is the inevitable\r\nresult of many people naming many plants over a period of many years. It\r\nis a situation which we must accept and do our best to mitigate. The\r\nCode has a number of necessarily rather complicated provisions aiming at\r\nselecting the correct name for any cultivar. These provisions are\r\nimportant mainly to the comparatively few horticulturists and botanists\r\nwho take on the unenviable job of sorting out the nomenclature of\r\ncultivated plants, though the results of their labours affect us all.\r\nThe rules are set out fully in the Code, and here I will attempt only to\r\npick out one or two of the more important.\r\n\r\nThe Code lays down two basic principles; though, as we shall see, these\r\nmay be modified if undesirable name-changing can be avoided thereby.\r\n\r\n(_a_) No name can be used if it does not conform to the various rules\r\nlaid down in the Code (including proper publication of the name, with a\r\ndescription).\r\n\r\n(_b_) If there are two or more names that conform with the Code, then\r\nthe _earliest_ name is the correct one; this is known technically as the\r\nprinciple of priority.\r\n\r\nNow, obviously, as happens with botanical names, the strict application\r\nof priority might mean that a universally used name--say, Plum\r\n'Victoria'--would have to be given up and replaced by a completely\r\nunknown one. This is unthinkable, and, as in the Botanical Code, there\r\nare clauses to prevent it happening. With cultivar-names, however, there\r\nis a particular complication, which does not apply to botanical names.\r\nThe latter are all in Latin, whereas cultivar-names may be in many\r\nlanguages. This means that a cultivar, raised in one country under a\r\nname acceptable in that country, may be introduced into another country\r\nwhere the original name is quite unpronounceable or otherwise\r\nunsuitable. A new name is, of course, immediately invented by the\r\nintroducer, and clearly, in many cases, it is useless to try to make the\r\nsecond country adopt the earlier, strictly correct, but unsuitable name.\r\nThe Code, therefore, allows the retention of the second name as what it\r\ncalls a \"commercial synonym.\" Thus, Rose 'Permanent Wave' is a\r\ncommercial synonym in the United States for the Rose raised in Holland\r\nas 'Mevrouw van Straaten van Nes.' In any formal list of Roses, both\r\nnames should be given, together with any other commercial synonyms that\r\nmay exist. The coining of commercial synonyms is not, of course, to be\r\nencouraged, and should only be done if the original name is clearly\r\nunsuitable for the new country. Frequently names are translated or\r\ntransliterated when a cultivar is introduced into another country, and\r\nsuch a translation or transliteration is not regarded in the Code as a\r\n_new_ name, but as the original name in another form; no difficulty,\r\ntherefore, arises as to priority in these particular cases.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most important section of the whole Code deals with the\r\n_Registration_ of cultivar-names. In certain groups (_e.g._ Daffodils)\r\ninternational registration schemes already exist, and it is urged that\r\nfurther schemes, covering all important groups of cultivated plants,\r\nshould be established as soon as possible. The function of such\r\nauthorities would consist, primarily, of (1) registering new names and\r\nensuring that they are in accordance with the Code, and (2) preparing,\r\nand keeping up to date, lists of cultivars in their groups. In addition,\r\nthe authorities would choose a particular publication as the\r\n\"starting-point\" of the nomenclature in the group (so as to avoid\r\ndipping too deeply into the past in search of ever earlier\r\ncultivar-names), and would act as arbiters when a decision has to be\r\nmade between two or more widely used names for the same cultivar. There\r\nis no doubt in the minds of those responsible for the Code that the\r\nexistence of internationally trusted and respected registration\r\nauthorities would do more than anything else to stabilize and simplify\r\nthe naming of cultivated plants. It will obviously take some time before\r\nauthorities can be set up for all--or even the majority--of important\r\ngroups, but the International Committee is doing its best to push ahead\r\nquickly with this very important side of their work.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the Code there are sections dealing with certain special\r\ncategories such as re-selected and improved cultivars, con-varieties,\r\nclones, apomicts and line-hybrids, which are of interest mainly to\r\nspecialists in breeding and taxonomic work on cultivated plants.\r\n\r\nI hope I have said enough, in this short article, to convince readers of\r\nthe JOURNAL that the Code is of some interest to them if they want to\r\nuse the names of plants so that other gardeners, both here and abroad\r\ncan understand what they mean. The next step is to read the Code\r\nitself--first the Summary and then the full text that follows it. No\r\ndoubt many who do so will be put off at first by the somewhat legal\r\nlanguage used. One can only repeat the time-honoured defence by lawyers\r\nwhen similarly attacked--that to avoid ambiguity experience has shown\r\nthat a certain amount of jargon is necessary! We have tried hard, in the\r\nCode, to keep it to a minimum.\r\n\r\nThe International Committee is anxious to receive suggestions for\r\nimproving the Code, so that they can be discussed at the next\r\nHorticultural Congress. All such suggestions should be sent to the\r\nSecretary of the Committee (DR. H. R. FLETCHER), c/o The Royal\r\nHorticultural Society, Vincent Square, London, S.W.1.\r\n\r\nIn the Historical Introduction to the Code (written by MR. W. T. STEARN,\r\nSecretary of the International Committee, during the production of the\r\nCode), Fellows of The Royal Horticultural Society will note, I trust\r\nwith pride, the important part played by their Society, in cooperation\r\nwith many other bodies and individuals in many parts of the world, in\r\nthe preparation, drafting and publication of the Code. I hope that they\r\nwill feel it their not unpleasant duty to make themselves and others\r\nfamiliar with the provisions of the Code, to follow its rules and\r\nrecommendations when they use the names of cultivated plants, and to let\r\nthe Secretary of the Committee know how they think it might be improved.\r\nArticle I of the Code states that its aim is \"to promote uniformity,\r\naccuracy and fixity ... with the minimum disturbance of existing\r\nnomenclature\"--an aim surely close to the heart of every Fellow of The\r\nRoyal Horticultural Society.\r\n\r\nI am grateful to MR. A. SIMMONDS, MR. W. T. STEARN AND MR. P. M. SYNGE\r\nfor help in the preparation of this article.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Exhibit at the Harvest Show of the Massachusetts\r\nHorticultural Society--Boston, Mass.
