The story appeared in\r\n               WEIRD TALES for last April, May and June.\r\n\r\n           [Transcriber's Note: This etext was produced from\r\n              Weird Tales January, February, March 1928.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CONTENTS\r\n\r\n                       1  THE SUMMONS\r\n                       2  STOLEN INTO SMALLNESS\r\n                       3  THE THING IN THE FOG\r\n                       4  THE WILD NIGHT RIDE\r\n                       5  CLIMBING INTO LARGENESS UNFATHOMABLE\r\n                       6  THE BLOOD-RED DAY\r\n                       7  THE FIGHT ON THE PARAPET\r\n                       8  YOUTH!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _CHAPTER 1_\r\n\r\n                              THE SUMMONS\r\n\r\n\r\nI was startled. Yet I think that I subconsciously I was prepared for\r\nit; expecting it. The little cylinder flipped out of its tube and\r\ndropped on my desk before me. My name was on it, glowing with tiny\r\nluminous letters: _Frank Elgon, Interplanetary Mails, Division 4,\r\nGreat-New York_. It looked just like any other Departmental message\r\ncylinder. But instinctively I knew it was not; and my heart was\r\nbeating fast as I clicked it open.\r\n\r\nRelayed through Code Headquarters. I saw that on the small rolled tape\r\ninside. And saw the signature, Dr. Gryce. It should not have been\r\nstartling, but my fingers were trembling as I unrolled the tape and\r\nhooked it into the automatic decoder. And I stood gripping my chair as\r\nthe line of English letters pricked themselves on the blank white sheet\r\nat which I was staring:\r\n\r\n    \"Frank--I can not bear it any longer. We must go--we must find\r\n    Brett at any cost. Will you stand by us? Come at once. Hurry.\r\n\r\n                                                            DR. GRYCE.\"\r\n\r\nMy mind leaped back. I sat at my desk staring blankly, while in\r\nthe office around me all the bustling activity of the accursed\r\nInterplanetary Mails faded before the surging visions of my memory.\r\nIt was four years since that other momentous day when Dr. Gryce had\r\nsent for me. And I had gone to him; and listened amazed at his weird,\r\nfantastic theories. Our sun, planets, and stars--all the vastness of\r\nthe star-filled heavens, he had told me then--were but the infinite\r\nsmallness of a greater world. All this that we call our Celestial\r\nUniverse was no more than an atom--of the giant world encompassing it.\r\n\r\nFantasy! Yet it had proved sober, tragic fact. Tragic, because Dr.\r\nGryce's older son, Brett, had gone out there to that giant world. Gone,\r\nand never returned. Nor been heard from; four years now, while old Dr.\r\nGryce at the end of his life waited despairingly.\r\n\r\nI had known always that the time would come when Dr. Gryce would wait\r\nno longer. He would send for me--friend of Brett--and friend of his\r\nother two children, Martt and Francine. For a year every cylinder that\r\nhad dropped on my desk had made my heart leap that it might contain\r\nthis summons which now lay before me.\r\n\r\n\"_I can not bear it any longer. Will you stand by us?_\" So simple\r\nan appeal! But I knew the turgid torrent of heartache--the final\r\ndesperation of an old man's suffering--which prompted it.\r\n\r\nYoung Grante at the desk next to mine was sorting his pile of official\r\ncommunications newly arrived by the Venus mail. I turned to him.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going away,\" I told him. In spite of myself--an unfortunate\r\nmannerism when I am perturbed--my voice sounded gruff, ill-tempered.\r\n\"There is no time to argue--will you please notify Official 4 that\r\nmy--my post is vacant.\"\r\n\r\nHe raised his eyebrows. \"Vacant?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I'm going away.\" I was on my feet. Outwardly calm, but within me\r\nwas a seething emotion. Going away! Out there into the immensity of the\r\nUnknown, where my friend Brett had gone, not to return. Young Grante\r\ncould not guess. He was thinking Great-London perhaps--or the Asiatic\r\nprovince. Or perchance, Venus, or Mars.\r\n\r\nI laughed harshly. \"Don't question me, Grante. Just tell them--my post\r\nis vacant.\"\r\n\r\nI left the room with his amazed stare following me. In the corridor,\r\nthrough a window I caught a glimpse of the tenth pedestrian level; its\r\ncrowd of people moving upon the diverse activities of their tiny lives.\r\nAlready I felt apart from them. Frank Elgon, Division 4. Presently, to\r\nsuch of them as knew me, I would be no more than a memory. \"That young,\r\nrather quarrelsome Elgon, who walked out of his office in a temper, and\r\nvanished.\" They would say that, and then forget me.\r\n\r\nI laughed again. But the thought brought a pang of regret, and a\r\nshudder.\r\n\r\nIn ten minutes I was within a pneumatic cylinder, speeding underground\r\nto the Southern Pennsylvania area, to the home of Dr. Gryce.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\nMartt and Frannie met me at the outer gateway. Their manner held a\r\nsingular gravity. I had expected them to be excited, of course. But\r\ntheir grave, somber smiles of greeting, their instinctively hushed\r\nvoices, seemed unnatural. This was no reckless, devil-may-care spirit\r\nof high adventure which I had anticipated the twins of Dr. Gryce would\r\ndisplay. Sober drama. Their involuntary glances at the white house\r\nnestling against the hillside carried a foreboding.\r\n\r\nDrama, but it seemed almost to be tragedy. My heart sank. There was\r\nsomething very wrong here with the Gryces; something more imminent than\r\nthe fact of Brett's absence over four years.\r\n\r\nBut I said nothing. Dear little Frannie gave me her two hands. They\r\nwere cold.\r\n\r\nMartt said, \"Thank you for coming, Frank. Father is--waiting for you.\"\r\nHis voice, usually flaunting, mocking at everything with the reckless\r\nspirit of youth, chilled me with its queerly broken tone.\r\n\r\nWe crossed the flowering gardens to the white house standing so\r\npeaceful in the afternoon sunlight. Martt led the way. The twins were\r\ntwenty-one years old now. Alike physically, and in temperament. Both\r\nsmaller than average height; slim and delicate of mold; blue-eyed,\r\nand fair of hair. They were always laughing; carefree--the spirit of\r\nirresponsible youth. But not today. I regarded Martt, trudging ahead\r\nof me--debonair, jaunty of figure in his tight black silk trousers and\r\nloose white shirt, bare-headed, his crisp, curly hair tousled by the\r\nwind. But there was a slump to his shoulders, a heaviness to his tread.\r\nAnd little Frannie behind him: girlishly beautiful, with her tossing\r\ngolden curls, her familiar house costume of gray blouse and widely\r\nflaring knee-length trousers. But there was upon her a preternatural\r\nsolemnity; a maturity of aspect indefinable.\r\n\r\nAt the doorway Martt turned and fixed me with his somber, blue-eyed\r\ngaze. And spoke with the same queer hush to his voice.\r\n\r\n\"Father is upstairs, Frank. He is--dying. He wants very much to live\r\nuntil you arrive.\"\r\n\r\nUpon the pillows in the darkened room lay Dr. Gryce's head with its\r\nshaggy, snow-white hair, the mound of the sheet betraying his pitifully\r\nwasted body.\r\n\r\nMartt said softly, very gently, \"Frank is here, Father. You see he came\r\nin time--plenty of time.\"\r\n\r\nBut the head, with face to the wall, did not move; no stirring marked\r\nthe fragile body lying there.\r\n\r\nMartt gave a cry; with Frannie he rushed to the bedside. It was all\r\ntoo evident. In a moment Martt stood up, leaned silently against the\r\nbedpost, a hand before his eyes as though dazed. And Frannie knelt at\r\nthe bed and sobbed.\r\n\r\nWe expect death all our lives, yet the instinct of life within us never\r\nceases to feel a shock, and a revulsion. For a long time these children\r\nof Dr. Gryce did not move or speak. Then Frannie leaped to her feet.\r\nHer face was tear-stained; but her sobs were suddenly checked, and her\r\neyes were blazing.\r\n\r\n\"Martt! His last wish--the very last thing he said--was that we go out\r\nourselves and find Brett. He said it--he said Brett might need us--his\r\ndying wish. And I'm going, and so are you. We've got to, Martt! And\r\nwe want Frank with us. Oh, Frank, you'll go with us, won't you? Out\r\nthere--to join Brett?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\nThe burial was passed. We had not spoken of our enterprise, but\r\nit had never left my thoughts. This boy and girl so newly come\r\nto maturity--but I was twenty-nine. Upon me would fall the main\r\nresponsibility.\r\n\r\nWe sat at last in Dr. Gryce's study--the three of us alone--to discuss\r\nour task. With the first poignancy of their shock and sorrow already\r\ndulled by time, upon the faces of Martt and Frannie was stamped grimly\r\ntheir simple purpose.\r\n\r\n\"But, Martt,\" I said, \"Brett's vehicle was very intricate. It\r\ntraveled in Space--but in Time as well. And grew gigantic in size.\r\nYour father's genius built it. But we have no such genius to build\r\nanother----\"\r\n\r\n\"You forget,\" he interrupted. \"Think back, Frank. That day you came\r\nhere. And we showed you the models of the vehicle. There were four of\r\nthem----\"\r\n\r\nThen I remembered. Dr. Gryce had shown me four small models. One he had\r\nsent back into Time. A flash, like a dissipating puff of vapor it was\r\ngone into the Past; still here in Space above the taboret on which it\r\nwas standing, but vanished with centuries of Time to hide it from my\r\nsight.\r\n\r\nAnother of the models, with Time unchanged, Dr. Gryce had sent into\r\nInfinite Smallness. I remembered watching it dwindling; a speck, a\r\npinhead, then invisible even to the microscope.\r\n\r\nTwo of the models were left. Martt and Frannie, but seventeen years old\r\nthen, had taken one into the garden. Had started it growing in size. I\r\nrecalled our frantic efforts to check its growth, lest it demolish the\r\nhouse. This was the one in which Martt and Brett had gone to the giant\r\nworld and in which Brett had returned alone to that distant part of our\r\nuniverse.\r\n\r\nOne model had remained. I had never thought of it since. Martt was\r\nsaying, \". . . and we still have that last model. Father kept it\r\nvery carefully.\" Martt's smile was wistful with the memory. \"I think\r\nhe--Father--had a premonition that he would not live to carry out his\r\npurpose. . . . The model is here.\"\r\n\r\nHe opened a locked steel box. Again I gazed silently at that small cube\r\nof milk-white metal--a cube the length of my forearm, with its tiny\r\ntower on top, its glasslike balcony, its windows and its doors.\r\n\r\n\"It's all complete,\" said Martt. \"And I know how to operate it.\"\r\n\r\nFrannie said with a touch of breathlessness, \"For a month past, Father\r\nhas been gathering the necessary instruments. And the supplies--you see\r\nhe--he really thought he was going to live----\"\r\n\r\n\"We're all ready,\" Martt added. \"We will increase this model to normal\r\nsize. Load it with our supplies. We can start tomorrow, Frank.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IV\r\n\r\nFive million light-years from Earth! Who of finite human mind can\r\nconceive such unfathomable distance! Yet, as I crouched on the floor of\r\nthe vehicle gazing down at the radiance emerging from the black void\r\nwhich was our first sight of the Inner Surface, the distance had seemed\r\nno more than gigantic. We were, in size, many million times our Earthly\r\nstature. The tiny Earth, from our larger viewpoint, was a little orange\r\nspinning above us in the void--a mere one-twentieth light-year away.\r\n\r\nMartt, for all his youth, had proved competent. He had made the trip\r\nonce before with Brett; he handled the vehicle carefully, and with\r\nskill. He said now, as we three crouched by the floor window, \"We'll\r\nsoon be down to the atmosphere, Frank. I'm checking our fall--we want\r\nno errors----\"\r\n\r\nWe were reversed in Time--holding very nearly at a single instant, so\r\nthat on the Inner Surface the time now was the same as it had been when\r\nwe left the Earth.\r\n\r\nWe argued the point; Martt said, \"I think when we land--we should\r\nchoose the point in Time about four years beyond Brett's landing. So\r\nthat it will be four years to us--and also to him. Don't you?\"\r\n\r\nWe decided upon that, so that we would reach the Inner Surface and\r\nfind Brett had been there four years. It seemed to strike a greater\r\nnormality. Find Brett! Would we find him? I wondered, as I knew Martt\r\nand Frannie were wondering. But in our plans we always took it for\r\ngranted.\r\n\r\nThe radiance beneath us grew brighter. And at last we entered the upper\r\nstrata of atmosphere, falling gently downward. It was a fair, beautiful\r\nland, as Brett and Martt had said. A sylvan landscape, with an air of\r\nquiet peace upon it. A broad vista of land and water; patches of human\r\nhabitation--houses, villages; a city.\r\n\r\nMartt was at the telescope. \"Pretty good, Frank! I've hit it--I see the\r\ncity--off there, isn't it? And the crescent lake.\"\r\n\r\nHe changed our direction slightly. As we dropped, the broad crescent\r\nlake lay beneath us. Trees bordered its banks; and to the right was the\r\ncity of low-roofed, crescent-shaped buildings banked with flowers. And\r\nbeyond the city a rolling country of gently undulating hills, with a\r\njagged mountain range up near the horizon.\r\n\r\nFrom this height it was a visibly concave surface. And it was gray and\r\ncolorless, for we were passing abnormally through its Time. Then Martt\r\nthrew off the Time-switch; we took the normal Time-rate of the realm.\r\nAnd in size we were also normal.\r\n\r\nAt a height of perhaps a thousand feet Martt held us poised above the\r\ncity. \"They'll see us now,\" he said. \"If--if Brett is down there he'll\r\nrecognize us. I'll land in the grove where we landed before. We'll give\r\nBrett time to get there to meet us.\"\r\n\r\nWith the Time-switch off, color and movement had sprung into the scene.\r\nThe forests were a somber growth of dull, orange-colored vegetation.\r\nThe water was a shimmering purple; and above us was a purple sky, with\r\nfaint clouds, and dim stars up there--stars which seemed very small and\r\nvery close.\r\n\r\nThe white houses gleamed and glowed in the starlight. Yet it seemed\r\nnot night; nor day either. A queerly shimmering twilight. Shadowless,\r\nas though everything were vaguely phosphorescent.\r\n\r\nIn the broad city streets there was movement. Vehicles; people. And the\r\npeople now were gathered in groups, staring up at us.\r\n\r\nWe landed in the little clearing at the edge of the lake near the city.\r\nAnd now at the last, Frannie gave voice to the fear which was within us\r\nall. \"Oh Frank, do you think Brett will be here?\"\r\n\r\nThere were human figures in the near-by thickets. I saw them through\r\nthe windows, but we were too busy with the landing to look closely. The\r\nvehicle came to rest. Martt and I flung open the door. The vegetation\r\nwas thick near by; we stepped from the vehicle onto a soft, mossy\r\nsward, and stood in a timid group, with tumultuously beating hearts.\r\n\r\n\"Martt! Frannie! Frank!\" It was his voice! Brett was here! And we saw\r\nhim step from a thicket. His familiar voice; his familiar figure, but\r\nso fantastically garbed that it brought to me a wild desire to laugh,\r\nfor I was half hysterical with the relief of seeing him.\r\n\r\nFrannie cried, \"Brett! My brother! You're all right, Brett, aren't you?\r\nI'm glad you're all right.\"\r\n\r\nUnder stress, how inarticulate are we humans! I said awkwardly, \"How\r\nare you, Brett? We thought we'd come and see you.\"\r\n\r\nHe took Frannie in his arms. And wrung Martt's hand, and mine, while\r\nhis strange companions stood in the background among the trees,\r\nwatching us.\r\n\r\n\"Of course I'm all right,\" he declared. \"And terrifically happy.\" A\r\nshadow crossed his face; his glance went to the vehicle's doorway.\r\n\"Father didn't come with you?\"\r\n\r\nThen Martt showed a wisdom far beyond his years. This was no time to\r\nbring sorrow to Brett. Martt said smoothly, \"Father is better than he\r\nhas ever been, Brett. We'll tell you--later.\"\r\n\r\n\"Good! That's fine!\" Brett's face was radiant. \"You're just in time,\r\nyou three. I'm to be married tonight.\"\r\n\r\nBut even then as I wrung his hand again, and congratulated him, I had a\r\npremonition that it was not to be.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _CHAPTER 2_\r\n\r\n                         STOLEN INTO SMALLNESS\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Life is pleasant here,\" said Brett. \"Pleasant, and indolent. It does\r\nnot make for progress, but it is happiness--and I'm beginning to wonder\r\nif that is not best, after all.\"\r\n\r\nWe were sitting in an arcaded passage on the roof of the home where\r\nBrett lived. Crescent archways opened to the roof, where stood banks\r\nof vivid flowers, with a vista of the city beyond. The building seemed\r\nof baked earth, rough like adobe, and of dull orange color. It was a\r\ntwo-storied, crescent-shaped structure, set upon a wide street-corner\r\nnear the edge of the city. The home of Leela's father. I had never\r\nforgotten Leela--the girl Brett and Martt had rescued from the giant on\r\ntheir first visit here. Brett had fallen in love with her. It was she\r\nwhom tonight he was to marry. And this was her father's home--Greedo,\r\nthe old musician.\r\n\r\n\"I have lived here with them six months,\" Brett said.\r\n\r\nMartt exclaimed, \"Six months! Why Brett, you have been gone four years!\"\r\n\r\nWe had miscalculated the Time-change of the vehicle. Our purpose had\r\nbeen to strike this realm of the Inner Surface at a point in Time which\r\nto Brett would be four years. But now we found it six months only.\r\n\r\nBrett smiled. \"I'm glad you didn't postpone your arrival. You've no\r\nidea how pleased I am to have you--tonight of all nights.\"\r\n\r\nWe had not yet seen Leela, or her father. Brett said that Leela would\r\nbe up presently to greet us. The city was excited over our coming. A\r\ncrowd was gathered in the street before the house; Brett had made them\r\na brief speech; Frannie, Martt and I had stood at the parapet and waved\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nThen Brett had spoken of a younger sister of Leela's. Her name was\r\nZelea--they called her Zee.\r\n\r\nMartt sat up at this. \"Where was she when we were here before?\"\r\n\r\n\"Away,\" said Brett. \"She was too young to meet a man then. Only now has\r\nshe come to be sixteen. You'll like her, Martt. I want you to like her.\"\r\n\r\n\"I will,\" said Martt enthusiastically, \"if she's anything like Leela.\"\r\n\r\n\"You were telling us about the life here,\" I suggested. \"We always\r\ncalled this land the Inner Surface----\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he agreed. \"It is concave, like the inner shell of some great,\r\nhollow globe. Within the space it encloses----\" He gestured to where,\r\nthrough the arcade, a segment of purple, star-filled sky was visible.\r\n\"All that which we of Earth called the Celestial Universe is enclosed\r\nby this concave shell. You would think that this must be a gigantic\r\nregion----\" He smiled again. \"It is not. Compared to our present\r\nenormous size, I imagine the circumference of this Inner Surface is\r\nnot unduly great. I don't know. These people have not explored very\r\nfar. They are not wanderers--they are too indolent, too contented, to\r\nwander.\"\r\n\r\nHe paused to drink from a shallow receptacle which stood before us, and\r\noffered Martt and me what appeared to be arrant cylinders to smoke.\r\n\r\n\"I have learned a little of the language. Proper names are impossible\r\nto translate. But the meaning of their word for this land, I call\r\nin English. Romantica. The romantic land. It is, I fancy, about\r\nfive hundred miles square. Beyond it lie forests and mountains. No\r\none here has ever penetrated them. There are wild beasts, birds,\r\ninsect life--and fish and reptiles in the water. But they are not\r\ndangerous--not aggressive. It is not because of them that these people\r\navoid exploration. It is--just indolence.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't wonder,\" I said. \"This is very peaceful here--I have no\r\ndesire to do anything in particular.\" From the city streets a drone of\r\nactivity floated up to us; but it was almost somnolent.\r\n\r\n\"It's always like this,\" said Brett. \"Almost no change of seasons--the\r\nlight always the same. There is no disease here--or very little.\r\nFood--grains, and what we would call vegetables, grow abundantly in\r\nthis rich soil. The trees give milk--even the bark and pulp of them are\r\nedible. Life is easy. There is nothing to struggle against.\r\n\r\n\"Through generations, it has made the people kindly. There is little\r\ncrime. No struggle for land, or food or clothing. Crimes involving\r\nsex----\" He gestured. \"Wherever humans exist there will be crimes of\r\nthat origin. But our women here are very sensible, and when a woman\r\ndoes what is right--well, you know, don't you, that most deeds of\r\nviolence into which men plunge over women have a woman's wrong actions\r\nat the bottom of them? There is little of that here, for the women take\r\ncare that there shall not be.\r\n\r\n\"So they call their country Romantica. They are not a scientific\r\npeople. They do not struggle for advancement. Art has taken the place\r\nof science. Painting. Sculpture. Music. They have developed music\r\nvery far. It has a soul here. It speaks--it sings--it seems a living\r\nentity. It is--what music ought to be, but seldom is--the pure voice\r\nof love, of romance. . . . I was telling you about our country. Most\r\nof its population live in villages, and in individual dwellings\r\nstrewn about the hills. There are but two large cities. This one--the\r\nlargest--they call Crescent. Or at least their word for it suggests the\r\nshape of the lake. The other city is about fifty miles from here\"--he\r\ngestured again--\"off there where you see the line of mountains. They\r\ncall it Reaf. It's a quaint city. Built largely over the water--rivers\r\nthere--hot, subterranean rivers which rush underground--under the\r\nmountains. They go--who knows where? No one has ever been down them.\r\nThe mountains are honeycombed with caves, tunnels, passages leading\r\nwithin, and up. Always up. But into them no one has ever penetrated.\r\nLegends tell fabulous tales of a great world up there. The giants, we\r\nthink----\"\r\n\r\nWhen Brett and Martt had first come here, giants had appeared.\r\nDwindling giants--strange, savage beings of half-human aspect. They\r\nhad appeared--no one knew from where. Growing smaller until they were\r\nnormal size to this realm. Not many had been seen. Some had kept on\r\ndwindling; they had grown so small, when attacked, that they had become\r\ninvisible. At the thought, I moved my foot involuntarily with a shudder\r\nof uneasiness. Here on the floor beside me now, men like beasts might\r\nbe lurking, so small I could not see them. Yet in a moment they might\r\ngrow to a stature greater than my own. . . .\r\n\r\nMen like beasts! . . . And I remembered that, with size gigantic, they\r\nhad destroyed the third city of Romantica.\r\n\r\nUpon Brett's face lay a cloud of apprehension. \"We have never heard\r\nfrom them since. It is thought--I think myself--that they came from\r\nthe subterranean rivers, or through the underground passages of the\r\nmountains. I conceive this concave surface upon which we're living\r\nto be the inner surface of a shell. It may not be very thick--there\r\nat Reaf. Above it--beyond it--up or down are mere comparative\r\nterms--beyond it must lie some vastly greater outside world. This whole\r\nrealm is doubtless within an atom of that greater world. It would be a\r\nconvex surface up there--with a sky and stars beyond. . . .\r\n\r\n\"We have never seen the giants since that time when Martt and I rescued\r\nLeela. Everyone here seems to have forgotten them----\" Brett's voice\r\nwas heavy with apprehension. \"These people are so trustful! They forget\r\nso quickly! No one worries. Our rulers here--a venerable man and woman\r\nlong past the age when death is expected--are so gentle, kindly, that\r\nthey can not imagine harm coming to their people. They have forgotten\r\nthe Hill City which the giants destroyed. Trampled upon it! Six or\r\neight giants--they must have been several hundred feet tall--stamping,\r\nkicking the building! I've been there--I've seen the ruins--strewn for\r\nmiles--and with buildings, colonnades and terraces mashed into the\r\nground! There were no more than half a thousand people surviving that\r\ndestruction of the Hill City--and thousands died. But everyone says\r\nnow, 'The giants are gone. We are safe.'\"\r\n\r\nBrett's voice had risen to a swift vehemence. \"It's been like living\r\non a volcano to me, all these months. There are no weapons here. My\r\nown few flash-cylinders--of what use would a tiny flash of lightning\r\nbe against beings so gigantic? We've got to do something. For if those\r\ngiants come again----\"\r\n\r\nA step sounded in the oval doorway near at hand. Leela stood\r\nsmilingly, deprecatingly before us.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\nBrett said, \"Come here, Leela. This is my sister, and my friend, Frank\r\nElgon. And here's Martt.\"\r\n\r\nLeela advanced hesitantly, her face a wave of color as she met our\r\ngazes. She was smaller, and even slighter than Frannie, her figure\r\nadorned and revealed by its single, simple garment--more like a short,\r\nglistening veil than a dress. Her hair was long and dark, caught by\r\na band at her neck, and flowing free beneath. Her arms and legs were\r\nbare. At her wrists, gray-blue bands with small tassels; on her feet,\r\nqueerly high-heeled wooden sandals, with tasseled thongs crossing on\r\nher ankles. The sandals clacked as she walked; her step was mincing,\r\nwith a suggestion of the Orientals of our Earth.\r\n\r\nBrett eyed the sandals with a humorous twinkle. \"For why are those,\r\nLeela?\"\r\n\r\nHer blush heightened. \"In honor of our guests. I thought you would like\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\nWith a swift gesture, she stooped, untied the thongs and cast the\r\nsandals off. Her feet were very white, small and delicately formed,\r\nwith rounded, polished nails stained pink. She stood untrammeled, lithe\r\nand graceful as a faun.\r\n\r\n\"I am glad to meet Brett's sister--and his friend. And you, Martt--I\r\nam glad to see you again.\" Her voice was soft as a Latin's. She shook\r\nhands with Martt and with me, and returned Frannie's affectionate\r\nembrace.\r\n\r\nAs I saw them together--these two girls of different worlds--I was\r\nstruck with the dissimilarity of them. Pert, vivacious little Frannie,\r\nblue-eyed, fair of hair--brown-skinned from the outdoor life she loved.\r\nAnd Leela--smooth, white skin, dark hair and luminous eyes, a fragile\r\ngrace to her every movement. None of my words are adequate. There was\r\nabout her an aura of romance; a strange wild spirit of something for\r\nwhich every man in his soul has a longing; a beauty with a quality\r\nethereal--half human, but half divine.\r\n\r\nA twinge of conscience came to me that I--Frank Elgon--could think such\r\nthoughts and see such beauty in any girl who was not Frannie.\r\n\r\nLeela was saying, \"My father would have you come down soon. And Zee is\r\ndown there--Zee is very much excited, Brett. There is so much to do\r\nbefore tonight----\"\r\n\r\nBrett's arm was around her. \"And you--of course you're not excited, are\r\nyou, Leela?\"\r\n\r\nShe returned his caress, embarrassed further by his teasing. He added,\r\n\"We will be down presently.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she said; and with a pretty gesture, she left us.\r\n\r\nThe sandals lay discarded on the floor. Brett gathered them up,\r\nregarding them tenderly. \"She is so easy to tease, I love to do it. But\r\nif you try that with Zee----\"\r\n\r\n\"You shouldn't tease her,\" said Frannie. \"She's a darling. I love her\r\nalready.\"\r\n\r\nBrett's wedding day! For all his quiet, whimsical teasing of Leela,\r\nthe love he bore her enveloped him like a shining cloak. Yet his\r\nfather whom he loved so dearly was dead, and Brett did not know it. I\r\nwhispered to Martt about it later.\r\n\r\n\"I think we should not tell him,\" said Martt. \"Not--until we have to.\"\r\n\r\nAnd we did not. Looking back on it now, how much was to happen to\r\nBrett--to Martt, to us all! What fearsome things--danger, desperation,\r\ndespair--were to be our allotted portion before we even thought again\r\nof old Dr. Gryce who was dead!\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\nBrett was to be married that evening--a public festival and ceremony\r\nover which the whole city was in an anticipatory fever.\r\n\r\n\"The festival of lights and music,\" said Brett. \"They hold it at\r\nperiodic times. It is a wonderful sight. It generally includes a\r\nmarriage--girls find it romantic. Leela selected it for us. Greedo\r\nis in charge of it--Leela and Zee always take part in its music. We\r\nmust go down--they are waiting for us--there is so much for them to do\r\nbetween now and this evening.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll help,\" said Frannie. \"Come on, Martt--I guess you want to meet\r\nZee, don't you?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IV\r\n\r\nWe found Leela's father to be a grave, black-robed, kind-faced old man\r\nof an age indeterminate. Sixty, or eighty, I could not have told. In\r\nvigorous health, evidently. His figure was spare, straight, but not\r\ntall. His thick, gray-black hair he wore long to the base of the neck.\r\n\r\nHe greeted us quietly, with an admirable dignity commanding immediate\r\nrespect.\r\n\r\n\"You are a musician,\" I said, after we had been talking for a time.\r\n\"Brett has told us something about your music here. It must be very\r\nbeautiful.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled. \"Music is a wonderful thing. It ennobles. There is in it\r\na touch of something beyond our poor human understanding. A touch\r\nof--what you call Divinity.\"\r\n\r\n\"You speak our language very well,\" I exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"A language is not difficult. All minds are similar--that is why music\r\ncan make so universal an appeal.\" His voice was earnest, his eyes\r\nsparkling. It was the subject most absorbing to him.\r\n\r\nI said, \"You teach music----\"\r\n\r\nHe raised a deprecating hand. \"Yes. But that is nothing. I teach the\r\nfundamentals\"--he struck his breast--\"the rest comes from within. For\r\nmyself, I am a mere retailer of sound. A peddler of something someone\r\nelse has made. The composer--he is the real artist. I have hoped that\r\nsome day Leela will compose. Brett has promised that he will urge\r\nher. . . . Just now, she sings.\" He twinkled at Leela. \"I fear she\r\nthinks she sings very well. Pouf! It is nothing! She, too, is only a\r\nsound-peddler.\"\r\n\r\nWith a burst, Zee entered the room. A smaller replica of Leela. Yet how\r\ndifferent! She came like a mountain torrent tumbling from the hillside.\r\nHer short, dull-red draperies whirled about her elfin figure. Her dark\r\neyes were blazing. Black hair, flying over her shoulders with her\r\ntumultuous entrance.\r\n\r\n\"Father! That is not so!\" She stamped one of her bare feet, then rose\r\non strong, supple toes and whirled half around. The muscles stood out\r\nbeneath the smooth satin skin of her calves. \"Leela, why do you let him\r\nsay such a thing? You sing beautifully.\" She whirled back. \"And what am\r\nI, then?\"\r\n\r\nThe old man was wholly unperturbed. \"You, Zee? Why, you are a peddler\r\nof movement. Very swift, tempestuous movement, generally.\" He added to\r\nme, \"She thinks she is an artist. She is not. She is only a dancer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n\r\nIt was what on Earth would have been termed late evening when we\r\nstarted for the festival. Greedo, with his two daughters, had left half\r\nan hour before.\r\n\r\nWe were dressed now in the fashion of the country. Brett had suggested\r\nit; Martt had insisted upon it. I remembered with what a jaunty\r\nswagger Martt had worn his clothes upon his return to Earth that\r\nother time. He was dressed similarly now. A cloth shirt of glaring\r\ngreen, with a high, rolling collar in front, and low in the back;\r\nshort trousers very wide and flapping at the knee. The trousers were\r\na lighter green, with dark green stripes; his stockings were tan; and\r\nhis green shoes were long and pointed. Over his shirt was a short tan\r\njacket, wide-shouldered and with puffed sleeves, and bangles dangling\r\nfrom elbows and wrists. And there was a skirt to the jacket, rolling\r\nupward at the waist.\r\n\r\nMy own costume was in the same fashion; and though it was a sober gray,\r\nbefitting my more mature years, I felt for a time awkward and foolish\r\nin it. But when in the crowded city streets I found that no one seemed\r\nparticularly to remark me, I soon forgot it.\r\n\r\nBrett wore a long cloak; I did not see how he was dressed. Frannie also\r\nwore a cloak. Just before leaving she tossed it aside, and stood before\r\nme, waiting for my admiration, with her characteristic twinkle, and her\r\npert upflung face daring me to disapprove. Even by contrast with Leela\r\nand Zee, to my eyes at least Frannie was very pretty. She wore the\r\nsingle draped garment with silver cords crossed at her breasts to shape\r\nher figure; and with banded wrists, and tasseled bands above the knees.\r\nHer blond curls were tied with flowing tassels. The whole costume, a\r\ngray and blue, with a single deep-blue flower in her hair. And thin,\r\nflexible sandals on her little feet.\r\n\r\nShe eyed me. \"Do you like me, Frank?\"\r\n\r\n\"I--why, why--Frannie----\" I would have told her then that I loved her,\r\nas I had very nearly told her myriad times in ten years past. But who\r\nwas I to ask the love of any girl? A sorter of planetary messages, poor\r\nas a towerman in the lower traffic! \"I--why yes, Frannie. Of course I\r\nlike you. You're--beautiful.\"\r\n\r\nShe had a quaint little circular hat, stiff and round, with a dull-red\r\nplume and a tassel. We men wore hats of a solidly wooden aspect--low,\r\nround crowns and triangular brims. Martt's was sea-green, with tassels\r\nall around its brim. But mine and Brett's were sober gray, and\r\nunadorned.\r\n\r\nWe started on foot. The city streets were dim in the luminous twilight.\r\nOverhead, the sky with its thin-strewn stars was cloudless. A holiday\r\naspect was everywhere. Crowds of people were in the streets. Young men\r\nand girls, gay with laughter. Most of them were cloaked. A vehicle,\r\nwith runners like a sleigh gliding over the grassy pavement, drawn by a\r\nsquat, four-legged animal, went by us. It was jammed with girls; one of\r\nthem leaned out and waved at me. Her slim white arm came down; her hand\r\ntwitched off my hat, sent it spinning. I caught a glimpse of her face;\r\ndark, laughing eyes, a mouth with mocking lips stained red. . . .\r\n\r\nThe sleigh passed on.\r\n\r\nWith Brett leading us we turned toward the lake. Most of the crowd\r\nseemed to be heading that way. Occasionally we were recognized. Stares\r\nof interest at us, the strangers, and cheers for Brett.\r\n\r\nHe said to me, \"They're all very happy, Frank. Like children.\" I\r\nfancied that he sighed--he, for whom this night of all nights should\r\nhave been his happiest.\r\n\r\nIn a group, with the swirling merrymakers about us, we made our way\r\nto the lake shore. The water was rippled by a gentle night breeze;\r\nthe stars gleamed on the water surface with tiny silver paths. Boats\r\nwere here--double canoes with outriders; and a few sailboats, small,\r\nsingle-masted, with triangular and crescent sails.\r\n\r\nWe found a small canoe; Brett sculled it with a broad-bladed paddle.\r\nOther boats were around us. A long canoe with a dozen sweeping\r\npaddles shot by us with the racing strokes of its men, and with\r\nshouts from its laughing girls. Another, smaller, turned over. Its\r\nmen swam, and righted it. They climbed aboard, hauling up the girls.\r\nThe wet draperies clung to them; they came up like dripping, gleeful\r\nwater-sprites, tossing their black hair. . . . A barge went slowly\r\nalong, drawn by two canoes. A lighted canopy was over its occupants--a\r\nhuge, woven garland of flowers. The canopy gleamed with spots of\r\nvivid-colored lights.\r\n\r\n\"The luminous flowers,\" said Brett. And I saw that the large purple\r\nblossoms were gleaming with a purple light--a phosphorescence inherent\r\nin them; and red blossoms, like crimson lanterns; and others orange,\r\nand green. Music floated upward from the barge, soft and sweet over\r\nthe water. The tinkle of strings--the voices of girls singing, and men\r\nhumming with a deeper background of harmony. . . .\r\n\r\nA night for love-making. The night romantic. Brett's wedding night--and\r\nyet, he had sighed. I knew why, for upon my own heart lay a weight\r\nof apprehension, heavier because it was so incongruous. Martt quite\r\nevidently did not feel it--he was shouting and laughing constantly\r\nwith his pleasure. A girl from a neighboring boat tossed him a large,\r\nblood-red, glowing blossom. It fell short, went into the water and\r\nslowly sank, staining the water with its red light. Martt all but\r\nturned us over trying to rescue it.\r\n\r\nFrannie, too, seemed gay. I tried to smile; but I felt that it was\r\nforced. The depression upon me would not be shaken off. It grew to\r\nseem almost sinister. The very atmosphere of happiness around me seemed\r\nto intensify it. These merrymakers--in the midst of life. . . . At such\r\na moment as this, death could choose to strike. . . .\r\n\r\n\"Look!\" shouted Martt. \"The lights off there--is that where we're\r\ngoing?\"\r\n\r\nA patch of gay-colored lights gleamed from over the water ahead. \"Yes,\"\r\nsaid Brett. \"An island there, where they hold the festival. It's not\r\nfar.\"\r\n\r\nIt was an irregular circular island, a mile perhaps in extent. The lake\r\nwaters indented it with a hundred tiny bays, inlets, and narrow, placid\r\nwaterways. We ascended one of them. The surface of the island was\r\ngently undulating, and wooded, with mossy dells--nooks arched with the\r\nluminous flowers. Nooks for love-making.\r\n\r\nThe whole island was strewn thick with the flowers; they grew upon\r\ntall, single stems--gay-colored lanterns nodding in the breeze. Beneath\r\nthem were laughing couples; some hidden, sought and found by groups of\r\nmarauding girls, to seize the man and laughingly whisk him away. And\r\neverywhere was music, soft as an echo. . . .\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe ascended the narrow waterways, came to a lagoon with a glassy\r\nsurface wherein a thousand spots of the lantern-flowers were\r\nmirrored like colored stars. Near the shore here, beyond a dock at\r\nwhich we landed, was a broad enclosed space with an arcade of the\r\nlantern-flowers arching over it. Brilliant with their light. Most of\r\nthe crowd seemed congregated there--a milling throng on the level floor\r\ninside, with liquid strains of music mingling with the shouts and\r\nlaughter.\r\n\r\n\"We'll go in there,\" said Brett. \"I'll find seats for you--then I must\r\nleave, to join Leela and her father. There is to be a musical program.\r\nBut first--just Greedo, Zee and Leela, and our marriage. Most of the\r\nmusic comes afterward.\"\r\n\r\nWithin the arcade the lights blended into a kaleidoscope of color. All\r\nthe cloaks were discarded now. Costumes vividly splashed as a painter's\r\npalette. Heavy perfumes. And that soft, echoing music. I could not tell\r\nits source.\r\n\r\nAt one end of the room was a raised, canopied platform, with doors\r\nbehind it. Most of the crowd were choosing low seats, like stools\r\nranged in rows. Brett got us settled.\r\n\r\n\"I'll leave you now--and meet you over there by the right-hand end of\r\nthe platform, afterward.\"\r\n\r\nHe left us. With Frannie between us, Martt and I sat quiet, watching\r\nand listening. We had not long to wait. The light around us began to\r\ndim; sliding curtains were obscuring the flowers over us. A hush fell\r\nupon the crowd. The soft music was stilled. A hush of expectancy.\r\n\r\nThe arcade was in gloom. The light on the platform intensified. A\r\ndeep-red glow, with a single spot focused upon a small, raised dais.\r\nInto the red glow came Greedo, robed unobtrusively in black. He was\r\ncarrying a crescent frame of strings. He seated himself, and in the\r\nsilence swept his hands across the strings. His fingers plucked them\r\nlike a harp; and then his other hand slid upon them. The staccato\r\nnotes rippled clear as a mountain rill, soft, muted to seem an echo of\r\nmusic. And blended with them was a low, crying melody--a fragment, then\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\nLeela had appeared. She crossed through the red glow, mounted the\r\ndais, and stood in the silver light--Leela, robed to her feet in a\r\nmisty silver veil through which her figure vaguely was outlined. She\r\nstood there drooping--a Naiad veiled in the fountain mist. . . . Then\r\nGreedo's music sounded. And Leela sang.\r\n\r\nIt was like nothing I had ever heard before. Music, toned strangely,\r\nwith strange intervals to make it neither major nor minor. Not\r\nhappiness, nor yet sadness. A wistfulness. A longing. But with the\r\npromise of fulfilment.\r\n\r\nI listened, breathlessly; and the arcade around me faded. Greedo's\r\nfigure in the shadow was forgotten. There was only the white figure of\r\nLeela; her face, the purity of girlhood, her eyes half closed, her lips\r\nparted with the song. Nothing else--save myself. I stood in a void,\r\nstretching out my arms to Romance. All that I had ever dreamed, and\r\nvaguely longed for without understanding what it meant, was upon me.\r\nAll that woman could mean to man--the spirit of the ideal never to be\r\nattained in mortal flesh--seemed suddenly attained. Romance--that thing\r\nelusive--intangible as a thought in the vaguest of dreams. It was mine!\r\n\r\nThe song ended. Applause rang out. Leela was gone.\r\n\r\nMartt breathed beside me, \"Frank! Wasn't that--wonderful! It was\r\nlike----Look, here comes Zee!\"\r\n\r\nZee was on the platform--a whirlwind of veils, stained by the red\r\nlight, white limbs flashing as she whirled. Greedo's music was faster\r\nnow. Snapping staccato, with a thrum of melody. The lights changed to\r\na mingled riot of color within which Zee was dancing. An elf. A sprite\r\nof the woodland, with tossing hair and fluttering arms; and a laughing\r\nface. . . . A figure in the fairy-tale of a child. . . .\r\n\r\nBut only for a moment. Then the dance slowed. Maturity came suddenly.\r\nZee mounted the dais, and the light there was abruptly green. She stood\r\nin an attitude of terror, her eyes wide, hands before her, posturing\r\nwith horror.\r\n\r\nIt made my heart leap. For an instant I fancied it had been real. But\r\nthe light turned silver. The horror faded into a passion of love,\r\nher white arms extended, her breasts rising and falling beneath the\r\nveils, her red lips parted with passionate longing. The abandonment\r\nof youth--so young, with newly awakened passion as yet but half\r\nunderstood. Then again she was whirling around the platform, leaping on\r\nher bare toes, light as a faun. . . .\r\n\r\nBehind me, suddenly a woman screamed! The reality of a long scream\r\nof terror! Greedo's music ceased. The lights wavered. Zee was gone.\r\nA scream from the audience; then another. A chaos of mingled cries.\r\nClattering of feet. Stools overturned. . . . Someone fell against me. I\r\nwent down, recovered and climbed upright. The audience was in a panic.\r\nI heard Martt shout, \"Look, Frank! Look there over the water!\"\r\n\r\nPeople were pushing me--surging to escape from the arcade. Shouting.\r\nCalling to one another. And the woman behind me was still screaming.\r\n\r\nI saw it then. Through the open side of the arcade, out a mile or\r\nmore over the water, the great giant figure of a man was standing,\r\nwaist-deep in the lake, his naked torso towering a hundred feet above\r\nit. A giant, wading in the lake, his face grotesque, malevolently\r\ngrinning in the starlight!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"The giant grinned malevolently in the starlight.\"]\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  VI\r\n\r\nThe crowd within the arcade was in a wild panic of terror. I was pushed\r\nand shoved, knocked down by heedless, rushing figures. Everyone was\r\ntrying to get outside. In a moment I was swept away. I could not get\r\nback to where I was sitting, or even tell where the spot had been.\r\nMartt and Frannie I could not see; the place was all a dim chaos of\r\ndisheveled, panic-stricken figures. A moment before they had been so\r\ngay and jaunty! . . .\r\n\r\nA girl rushed past me. The veiling had been torn from her shoulders.\r\nHer eyes for an instant met mine, as she searched my face hoping to\r\nrecognize in me the companion from whom she had been separated. Her\r\ndark eyes were wide, red-rimmed with fear. Her face, with all the\r\nbeauty of youth gone from it, was chalk-white.\r\n\r\nShe turned and rushed away from me. I thought again, \"In the midst of\r\nlife . . . why, this is horrible!\" That giant off there--he could wade\r\nto the island in a few moments. . . .\r\n\r\nI fought my way out of the arcade, out under the trees by the edge\r\nof the lagoon. There was more room out there. In the starlight I\r\ncould see figures rushing aimlessly away, scattering under the\r\nlantern-flowers . . . others hurriedly crowding the boats. One boat was\r\noverturned. I wondered vaguely if the struggling figures in the water\r\nwould be drowned.\r\n\r\nBack near the wall of the arcade I saw a girl's figure running. It\r\nseemed familiar. Was it Frannie? I dashed after her. But people running\r\nin between us blocked me. I lost sight of her; saw her momentarily as\r\nshe seemed to dart around the farther arcade corner. But when I got\r\nthere, she was not in sight. Was it Frannie? Had she gone this way? Or\r\ninto that door, back into the rear of the arcade?\r\n\r\nI stood in doubt. Then I saw Brett, running past me, out under the\r\nlantern-flowers some fifty feet away. His cloak was discarded; he was\r\nbare-headed. Brett in his marriage robe! Black and white, with golden\r\ntassels gayly dangling from the rolled skirt of his jacket. He was\r\ndisheveled; as he ran, I saw him tear off the jacket impatiently and\r\ntoss it away.\r\n\r\n\"Brett! Oh, Brett!\"\r\n\r\nHe stopped; whirled toward me. \"Frank! Where's Frannie--and Martt?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not know,\" I said. \"I lost them. That giant----\"\r\n\r\n\"The giant is wading the other way now.\" He pulled me past a thicket,\r\nand pointed. I could see the back of the giant's naked shoulders,\r\ntowering up against the stars. He was going the other way--wading\r\ntoward the far-distant opposite lake shore. And now against the\r\nisland's banks, the waves the giant made were beginning to pound.\r\n\r\nBrett said: \"I don't know where Leela is. I was in there with her--and\r\nwith Zee. I rushed out when the alarm came--when I went back they were\r\ngone.\" He stood irresolute. \"We must find them, Frank. And get back\r\nhome.\" He drew a long breath. \"It has come, you see, as I feared.\"\r\n\r\n\"I thought I saw Frannie,\" I said. \"Running--that way. But I'm not\r\nsure. I lost sight of her----\"\r\n\r\nFrom behind the pavilion came a scream. The scream of a girl.\r\nFamiliar. . . . The blood drained from Brett's face. \"Leela!\"\r\n\r\nAnd then I heard Frannie screaming from there also. We ran. The two\r\ngirls were standing there clinging to each other. They seemed unharmed.\r\nBut they were trembling, shuddering, arms gripping one another.\r\n\r\n\"Leela! What is it?\" Brett held her off, regarding her. \"You're not\r\nhurt, are you? What is it?\"\r\n\r\nWe four seemed alone here beside the arcade. Lantern-flowers were over\r\nus; a thicket was near by. Frannie's arms were around me.\r\n\r\n\"Frank--oh----\" She choked; she seemed struggling to tell me something.\r\n\r\nI held her close. \"You're not hurt, Frannie. Just frightened. What\r\nbecame of Martt?\"\r\n\r\nOh, horrible! What gruesome, horrible thing was this! Within my arms I\r\ncould feel her sensibly shrinking! Her shoulders within my encircling\r\narm, melting . . . palpably dwindling.\r\n\r\nHorrible! And there was a great cry from Brett. \"Leela! My God,\r\nLeela----\"\r\n\r\nAt the horror of it, Brett and I stood dumbly staring; and again the\r\ngirls clung together. They seemed dizzy; they swayed, almost fell, then\r\nsteadied themselves.\r\n\r\nVisibly smaller now, like beautifully formed little children, clinging\r\ntogether, no taller than my waist.\r\n\r\nDwindling!\r\n\r\nThen Frannie pointed to the thicket. Two small human figures stood\r\nthere--a foot high, no more. A grinning gnomelike man, with black\r\nmatted hair on his naked chest; and a woman--a woman thick and\r\nshapeless. A foot in height. But they were shrinking very fast. And\r\nbeside them were four small animals with horns--grotesque like a dream\r\nmingling dog and horse and moose. The animals, too, were dwindling.\r\n\r\nBrett saw them; but neither he nor I made a move. At our feet Frannie\r\nand Leela, no higher than our ankles now, were gazing up at us, with\r\ntiny upraised arms, pleading.\r\n\r\n\"Leela! Frannie!\" We knelt by them. Then Brett in an agony of terror\r\nlifted Leela in his hand. \"Leela! Don't--don't get any smaller!\"\r\n\r\nThen he put her down. She ran, half fell the distance of my foot to\r\nreach Frannie. And I heard Frannie's tiny voice calling up to us in\r\ngasps, \"We're going! He--that man there with the woman--caught us.\r\nForced--down our throats--a drug. We--going----\"\r\n\r\nSmaller than my finger. Then so small we knelt to see them. They were\r\nhuddled against the side of a pebble. Then they seemed struggling\r\ntoward the pebble. Behind it. Under it. Under its curve. . . .\r\n\r\nBrett cried, \"Don't move, Frank! My God, we might trample on them!\r\nDon't move!\"\r\n\r\nThe figures in the thicket had vanished. By the pebble which Brett\r\nguarded so carefully I thought I saw Leela and Frannie. Saw a movement,\r\nas though an ant were there, hiding under the pebble.\r\n\r\nThen--they were not visible. We did not dare look too closely. They\r\nwere gone! Still there within a foot of our straining eyes--but so\r\nimmeasurably distant! Lost! Gone! Stolen into smallness!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _CHAPTER 3_\r\n\r\n                         THE THING IN THE FOG\r\n\r\n\r\nWithin the arcade, when the alarm had sounded, Martt leaped to his\r\nfeet, dragging Frannie after him. He saw me knocked to the floor, but\r\ncould not reach me. A press of panic-stricken people was sweeping him\r\naway, but he clung to Frannie. Then he saw me regain my feet; saw me\r\nlooking around. But I did not see him; and though he shouted at me, in\r\nthe noise and confusion his words were lost.\r\n\r\nFrannie gasped, \"What is it? What's the matter, Martt? What is it?\"\r\n\r\nMartt did not know. But he guessed, and his heart went cold with fear.\r\n\"We must get outside, Frannie. Hold tight! This way--it's nearer! There\r\ngoes Frank--we'll join him outside.\"\r\n\r\nMartt was forcing a way for them through the crowd. Frannie stumbled.\r\nHer hold on him was broken. She fell; and before he could reach her\r\nhe was knocked backward by a running man. When he regained his feet a\r\nswift-moving group was between him and Frannie. He saw two girls stop\r\nand help her up; then discard her. Saw her turn, confused, and run\r\ninto a space where the crowd was thinner. He was being shoved away from\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"Frannie! Wait! This way!\"\r\n\r\nBut she did not hear him. And then he could no longer see her; there\r\nwere too many people in between. He struggled in that direction, then\r\nhe thought he saw me, and turned momentarily the other way. . . .\r\n\r\nMartt found himself alone, outside the arcade. The crowd was thinner.\r\nStill he was not certain of the cause of all this panic. Then he saw\r\nthe giant. Stood, and stared with tumultuously beating heart.\r\n\r\nA man bumped into him; for an instant he thought that it was Brett.\r\nMemory of Brett reminded him that Brett was probably within the arcade,\r\nback of the platform-stage. He saw an opening, there in the arcade\r\nwall; he thought it was a doorway, leading back of the stage. He\r\nstarted for it, ran headlong into a girl standing there, staring out\r\nover the water to where the giant now had faced about and was wading\r\naway.\r\n\r\n\"Martt!\"\r\n\r\n\"You, Zee! Where's Brett? Where are Leela and your father?\"\r\n\r\nShe clung to him, her draperies drooping, her hair tumbling in great\r\ndark waves over her white shoulders as she shook her head.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know. They were in there a moment ago. Frannie came in--she\r\nand Leela were at the other door. Martt--that giant----\"\r\n\r\n\"He's going away, Zee. Look! You see him turned about? Don't be\r\nfrightened. We must find Brett. I don't know where Frank is--I lost\r\nhim. There he is--isn't that Frank? Oh--Frank!\"\r\n\r\nThey ran toward a man's figure, passing along a distant line of trees.\r\nBut when they caught up with it, the man was a stranger. Ahead of them,\r\nhidden by a thicket, voices were shouting. A rhythmic call. Martt and\r\nZee listened; but Martt could not understand the shouted words.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, Zee? Can you understand them?\"\r\n\r\n\"They're saying, 'The messenger from Reaf!' Some messenger from Reaf\r\nhas come with news.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come on. Let's go see what it is.\"\r\n\r\nHe gripped her hand. They ran swiftly through the woods. They were\r\nalready several hundred feet from the arcade. The lagoon was on\r\nits other side; ahead of them was a patch of woods, dark, for the\r\nlantern-flowers did not grow along here. And beyond the woods, the\r\nshore of the island where the shouting sounded.\r\n\r\nThey ran. Soon Zee was ahead, leaping like a young chamois, her veils\r\nand hair flying.\r\n\r\n\"Wait!\" he called. \"Not so fast!\"\r\n\r\nShe stopped abruptly. And Martt stopped. There was a pounding on the\r\nshore; waves rolling up, as though the peaceful lake were torn by a\r\nstorm.\r\n\r\n\"What's that, Zee?\" But the shouting began again; and without\r\nanswering, Zee started ahead.\r\n\r\nThe starlit lake came into view. Like a distant, monstrous shadow, the\r\nretreating giant was visible against the stars. On the shore, white\r\nwaves were rolling up. A boat was here, with its sail flapping. A wave\r\ncaught it, turned it over.\r\n\r\nOn the strand a group of people were standing with the man who had come\r\nin this boat from Reaf. Zee joined the group. In a moment she returned.\r\n\r\n\"He says--the messenger says--that giants are in Reaf! The city is\r\nemptied--the people have scattered into the country. The road to\r\nCrescent is crowded with people coming here.\"\r\n\r\n\"Giants! There--as well as here----\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. They did not attack. There were two giants. They stood in the\r\nlake and laughed while the people fled from the city. Hundreds were\r\nkilled in the rush to get out--hundreds were swept away into the\r\nsubterranean rivers and the giants stood and laughed. The city is\r\ndeserted, and the two giants are there now.\"\r\n\r\nMen were helping the messenger right his boat. The group on the shore\r\nscattered back over the island, calling, \"Giants! Giants are in Reaf!\"\r\n\r\nThe messenger climbed into his boat, headed it out over the now calmer\r\nlake.\r\n\r\nMartt and Zee momentarily were alone. He stared at her. He was stunned,\r\nconfused. Giants, everywhere. This thing that had been worrying Brett\r\nfor so long had come. Death, everywhere.\r\n\r\n\"Let's get back, Zee. We must find Brett.\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed shorter along the shore--a turn of the island near by,\r\ninto the lagoon, and thus back to the arcade. They started off,\r\nrunning again. It was deserted along here. Zee was leading. Suddenly\r\nshe stopped in full flight, gripped Martt, drew him behind a huge,\r\npot-bellied tree trunk which stood near the water's edge.\r\n\r\n\"Zee, what----?\"\r\n\r\n\"There, over there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where? I don't see anything.\"\r\n\r\nShe whispered insistently, \"Over there--in that open space. Back from\r\nthe shore.\"\r\n\r\nShe was crouching, and he crouched beside her; followed her gesture\r\nwith his gaze--and saw what she saw.\r\n\r\nTiny moving figures on the ground. Four of them, small dark blobs\r\nagainst the white sand. They were about a hundred feet away from where\r\nMartt and Zee were crouching. They had come out of the woods evidently,\r\nand were crossing this patch of white sand, heading for the water.\r\nMartt blinked and rubbed his eyes, staring at them. They moved in tiny\r\nleaps, bounding soundlessly over the sand. Each of them a foot long\r\nperhaps. Strange in shape; animal or human, he could not say.\r\n\r\n\"What are they, Zee?\"\r\n\r\nBut she did not answer. Her little body was shrinking against him; he\r\ncould feel her shudder.\r\n\r\nThe figures seemed long and thin, horizontal to the ground, with\r\nsomething sticking upright like a tower from the middle of them. Martt\r\ngasped. He had thought them four animals, with humps like upright\r\ntowers. They were not. He saw them now as running dogs with horns, each\r\nwith a tiny human figure on its back. And he gasped again. They were\r\ngrowing larger!\r\n\r\nThey crossed the sand in bounds and momentarily stopped. Already they\r\nwere fully half normal size. Four horned animals that might have been\r\ngrotesque dogs, or horses. Saddled; and mounted upon them, a heavy-set,\r\nhalf-naked man; a strange, shapeless woman--and two girls!\r\n\r\nNormal size now! No, already they were larger! Growing rapidly larger!\r\nFrannie and Leela!\r\n\r\nMartt half started to his feet. He opened his mouth to shout\r\nimpulsively, but Zee drew him back and silenced him. The four animals\r\nwere taking to the water. Swimming with heads stretched out. Martt\r\ncould see Frannie and Leela bending forward, each clutching the horn of\r\nher mount. In single file the animals swam swiftly out into the starlit\r\nlake. They did not seem to be growing any further. Twice normal size\r\nperhaps. Soon they were four dark blobs on the shining water. Visually\r\nseeming smaller by distance. V-shaped lines of silver phosphorescence\r\nstreamed out in the water behind them with their swift forward\r\nprogress.\r\n\r\nAnd presently they were vanished.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMartt and Zee stood up. They could not explain it. They tried to, but\r\ncould not. But the main facts were clear. That had been a man and\r\nwoman giant, and four of their animals. They had captured Frannie and\r\nLeela. Had made the girls and the animals change size like themselves.\r\nThey had all, just now, been very small in size. To escape observation\r\ncoming across the island to its shore, Martt concluded.\r\n\r\nHe said, \"We must get to Brett--tell him about this. And then--go after\r\nthem----\"\r\n\r\nAgain they started running along the shore, intending to turn at the\r\nlagoon-mouth for the arcade. Martt's thoughts flew swift as his legs.\r\nLeela and Frannie captured . . . they must be rescued . . . then all\r\nof them would get into the vehicle and go to Earth--get out of this\r\ndanger. . . .\r\n\r\nZee was saying, \"That is Reaf, off that way where they went.\"\r\n\r\nThe wading giant had also gone that way. The messenger had said that\r\nReaf was deserted, that giants were there. Evidently Reaf was the place\r\nat which these giants first appeared. Evidently it was the point of\r\nentrance and departure for them into and out of this realm. Leela and\r\nFrannie were being taken to Reaf. . . .\r\n\r\nMartt's heart leaped. An idea was forming in his mind. A plan--a mad,\r\nreckless plan. But it seemed possible of success. . . . He thought of\r\nthe vehicle. It would be of no use against these giants. It was too\r\nunwieldy. Besides, shut up in it one could not attack. And when they\r\nstopped it to disembark, the giants would overwhelm it. Or, if at the\r\nmoment it was too gigantic for them, then they would escape before\r\nthe occupants of the vehicle could get out to stop them. . . . And\r\nbesides, the vehicle was too precious--no chances like that should be\r\ntaken with it.\r\n\r\nMartt told himself that he must get Brett to hide the vehicle. Guard it\r\nsomehow. . . .\r\n\r\nA mad idea, this plan he was pondering. . . . They came to the\r\nlagoon-mouth; and here, to crystallize Martt's plan, to make it seem\r\nfeasible--here lay a small sailboat, deserted by its owner. It lay,\r\nhalf pulled up on the sand, around the bend of the lagoon.\r\n\r\n\"Zee! Stop! Wait! I want to talk to you.\"\r\n\r\nZee had been bounding ahead of him. She stopped, waited, faced him. He\r\nwas breathless.\r\n\r\n\"That sailboat,\" he said. \"It's one of the fast kind, isn't it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\" She regarded it. \"Yes. Very fast.\"\r\n\r\nIt was no more than a shell. A flat, spoon-shaped affair, with a small\r\ncockpit just large enough for two; and it had a very tall, flexible\r\nmast, and an overlarge crescent sail. The sail was flapping. Out on the\r\nlake the wind had risen. It was blowing directly toward Reaf.\r\n\r\n\"Zee, listen--could you sail that boat?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"You could handle it in that wind out there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"And it would go--how fast, Zee?\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean--to Reaf?\" She was as excited as he.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. To Reaf. We could get there. Go after them. Cautiously. We could\r\nhide before we got there. I've a plan----\"\r\n\r\n\"How long to Reaf?\" She pondered. \"Three--what you call hours. We go\r\nfast in a wind like that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. That's it. Fast. Three hours. Zee, listen. Reaf must be where\r\nthe giants go to leave for their own world. They're taking Frannie\r\nand Leela there. You see? And if we can get there--get into Reaf\"--he\r\ngestured--\"Zee, if they--those giants are very big, then we to them are\r\nsmall. Tiny. And it's quite dark. It would be dark in the caverns near\r\nReaf--the houses there near the subterranean rivers. We would be so\r\nsmall the giants might not see us.\"\r\n\r\nHe drew a long breath. \"My plan, Zee, is to get in there, hide, and\r\nfind a giant from whom we can steal the drugs. With the drugs----\"\r\n\r\nShe was trembling with excitement. No fear now. Reckless as only youth\r\ncan be. \"Oh Martt, if we could get the drugs! Brett said the giants\r\nmust be using drugs. And make ourselves larger than the giants----\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Then I can fight them. Rescue Leela and Frannie. We've got to do\r\nit. Bring Leela and Frannie safely back. We'll say, 'Here they are,\r\nBrett.' But if we wait, if we stop now it will be too late.\"\r\n\r\nBefore Martt's eyes was the vision of himself and Zee returning\r\nvictoriously with the rescued girls. And with the drugs in his\r\npossession. There would be no danger then. The giants, knowing the\r\ndrugs were stolen, would not dare remain. . . . They would all escape\r\nup into their own world. . . .\r\n\r\n\"Will you do it, Zee? Shall we go?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nMartt thought of his flash-cylinder. \"I wish I had it, Zee.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is it?\"\r\n\r\n\"In the vehicle. But we have no time to get it.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think it would not be of much use.\"\r\n\r\n\"No. I don't think so either. But all I've got is this.\" He displayed a\r\nknife whose blade, as long as his hand, slid back into its handle for a\r\nsheath.\r\n\r\n\"Good,\" she said. He replaced the knife. They climbed into the boat.\r\nMartt shoved it off.\r\n\r\nIn a moment they were beyond the quiet lagoon, heading out into the\r\nstarlit lake, with the lights of the island fading behind them.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nThe wind was strong when they were beyond the island. The sail bellied\r\nout in front of them like a great crescent dish; the spoon-shaped boat,\r\nbarely skimming the surface of the water, rode high on a white wave\r\nbeneath it. Zee lay on her side, upraised upon an elbow with her hand\r\non the knife-blade rudder that trailed the water behind them. Beside\r\nher, hunched with arms wrapping his upraised knees, Martt sat and\r\npeered ahead under the sail.\r\n\r\nThe lake was dim in the starlight; its concavity rose to the horizon.\r\nIt seemed empty ahead. No boats. The wading giant had vanished; the\r\nswimming figures were gone.\r\n\r\nAs they sailed with the wind, the night seemed windless and calm, save\r\nthat the lake boiled under them, swiftly passing. Martt was in no mood\r\nto talk. Zee, too, was silent, engrossed with her task of guiding the\r\nboat.\r\n\r\nOccasionally, with a surreptitious, sidelong glance, Martt regarded her\r\nintent little face, earnest and solemn. Long, dark lashes, tendrils of\r\ndark hair around the slim white column of her throat; her outstretched\r\nlimbs revealed by the stirring draperies. . . . A lock of her hair flew\r\nacross his cheek. He touched it, cast it away.\r\n\r\n\"Zee?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Martt?\"\r\n\r\n\"I was thinking--you dance very beautifully.\"\r\n\r\nShe turned to him, and smiled; a whimsical smile, and her eyes were\r\ndark woodland dells of fairyland. \"Father does not think so. A peddler\r\nof movement--violent, tempestuous movement! Do you think that, Martt?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he assured her. \"Of course I don't.\" As she turned back to her\r\nsteering, his fingers furtively caught a hem of her robe and held it.\r\n\r\nThere was a long silence. Then he said, as though there had been no\r\nsilence, \"Of course I don't. I think you dance beautifully.\" And he\r\nadded, \"It made me----\" His tongue was about to say, \"It made me love\r\nyou,\" but his beating heart smothered the words. He amended, \"It made\r\nme think that your father was very wrong to say that. And about Leela,\r\ntoo.\"\r\n\r\nAt the mention of Leela he saw a shadow cross Zee's face. He tensed\r\nhimself; set his jaw grimly. This was no time for thoughts of love.\r\nLeela, and his sister Frannie, were captured by giants. There was work,\r\ndanger for him and for Zee, up ahead in this starlit night. He would\r\nneed all his wits, all his resourcefulness. . . .\r\n\r\nHe remembered the one visit he had formerly made to Reaf; tried to\r\nrecall how the city lay. Tried to plan what he and Zee would do, now\r\nwhen they got there.\r\n\r\nHe said, \"Zee, the rivers at Reaf that plunge into the mountains--no\r\none has been in them very far?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Can you walk along their banks, inside, under the mountains?\"\r\n\r\nShe nodded. \"In some places there are narrow ledges beside the water.\r\nBut how far--no one knows.\"\r\n\r\n\"And in other places--near Reaf, I mean--there are tunnels?\r\nPassageways?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Back into the caves and beyond.\"\r\n\r\n\"I think,\" he said, \"that back through there is the way to the giants'\r\nhuge outer world. They've come down, and through the ground behind the\r\nmountains. Do you suppose they'll take Leela and Frannie up to their\r\nown realm? Or keep them in Reaf?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think--we do not know anything about it,\" she said.\r\n\r\nHe smiled grimly. \"You're right, we don't. Why the giants should come\r\nhere at all I don't know. But we're going to know more about it before\r\nwe get through with them, Zee. What I'm hoping is that we might find\r\none of them alone. We've got to get the drugs away from them somehow.\r\nWe've got to.\"\r\n\r\nMartt remembered once arguing with Brett about the giants. Brett\r\nhad thought that they used some drug--two drugs--one to shrink\r\nproportionately each of their body cells, and the other similarly to\r\nincrease the size of the cells. Drugs of the kind had already been\r\nsought for on Earth. Nitrogen was the basis for growth. And the new\r\nelement, Parogen, had been found to cause a shrinkage. In Mars they had\r\ndeveloped such drugs further--but they were still impractical for human\r\nuse.\r\n\r\nThese giants evidently had something of the kind. And it must be\r\nradio-active--it must cause a radiation affecting vegetable or animal\r\nmatter in near proximity to the changing body. The garments of the\r\ngiants expanded and contracted with their bodies. But Brett had said\r\nthat a weapon in your hand--particularly one of mineral--would not\r\nchange size. . . . The thought was to some slight degree, at least,\r\ncomforting to Martt; the giants would be unarmed.\r\n\r\nZee's voice broke in on his thoughts. \"Look, there are the mountains\r\nbehind Reaf.\"\r\n\r\nOver the lake, ahead of them the distant horizon was a haze of\r\nphosphorescence. But to the left a line of shore had become visible;\r\nand now Martt saw up ahead the vague, dark outlines of the mountains.\r\nSharp, jagged peaks, tinged with a green-white.\r\n\r\nAnother hour. The shore to the left was nearer. Undulating land along\r\nthe lake. A ribbon of road along the water . . . Martt thought he could\r\nsee blobs moving along it. Away from Reaf, moving toward Crescent.\r\n\r\n\"The refugees from Reaf,\" said Zee. \"The messenger said all the roads\r\nwere crowded.\"\r\n\r\nAnother half-hour. Ahead the mountains frowned, rising sheer from\r\nthe water. The lake was more shallow here; they began passing flat,\r\nmuddy islands, with river channels flowing between them as in a delta.\r\nA blur there, at the foot of the mountains, was Reaf. The silver\r\nphosphorescence of the lake was darkening; the water looked muddy,\r\nturgid. In a narrow channel between two islands, Martt noticed a quite\r\nvisible current flowing toward Reaf. It rippled the water as it passed\r\nover a bar which Zee skilfully avoided.\r\n\r\nThere were other islands, with water bubbling up from them, and clouds\r\nof steam rising. Zee trailed her hand overboard.\r\n\r\n\"We are in the warm water now. Feel it, Martt.\"\r\n\r\nThe lake water, fed by boiling springs from all this region, was\r\nnoticeably warmer. And every moment the current toward Reaf was\r\nbecoming stronger. Martt knew that all this part of the lake converged\r\nto the mouths of the subterranean rivers at Reaf; converged and plunged\r\nunder the ground.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe city of Reaf was now in sight. It spread sidewise over an area of\r\na mile or two. The houses were perched on stilts, like flat, awkward,\r\nlong-legged birds squatting in the water.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time Martt and Zee had been watching closely for any\r\nsign of giants. There were none in sight--nothing that seemed alive\r\nover this turgid water, the disconsolate group of houses, the sheer\r\ncliffs with the sullen mountains above them. Two yawning black openings\r\nshowed where the rivers entered. . . .\r\n\r\nA deserted city, its inhabitants fled. Some had been drowned, the\r\nmessenger said. There would be no floating bodies; the current would\r\nhave sucked them all into those yawning black mouths. . . . A deserted\r\ncity. But somewhere in there among the houses, giants might be\r\nlurking. . . .\r\n\r\nMartt said abruptly, \"We'd better get the sail down. They can see it\r\ntoo easily.\" They were still some two miles from the outskirts of the\r\ncity. But no more than half a mile from the nearer shore. It swung past\r\nthem to the left; perpendicular black cliffs rising from the water with\r\na narrow rocky strip along the bottom against which the water sucked.\r\n\r\nZee helped Martt lower the sail. There were poles aboard; the lake here\r\nwas no more than five feet deep. They could pole the boat ashore. Walk\r\nunobserved toward the nearer river-mouth. Into the city, to hide among\r\nits buildings.\r\n\r\nWith a thrill of apprehension Martt realized that they might already\r\nhave been seen. But he thought it unlikely. From the hot water, vapor\r\nwas rising in a fog. It hung like a white shroud over Reaf. Once in it,\r\nsurrounded by the fog, they would be comparatively safe.\r\n\r\n\"Zee, can you swim?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes,\" she said. \"But Martt, if you get in the water, be very\r\ncareful of the rivers.\"\r\n\r\nSilently they poled the boat to shore. Drew it up from the current,\r\nleft it on a shelving rock ledge. The strip here was some ten feet\r\nwide; the hot, black lake in front, sluggishly surging toward Reaf;\r\nand above them the smooth cliff-face.\r\n\r\nThe wind had turned--a swirling current turned by the mountains. The\r\nfog from Reaf came rolling down upon them. It grew dark; the stars were\r\nobscured. In the humid steam they could see no more than twenty feet.\r\n\r\n\"Good,\" said Martt. \"This is what we want.\" He spoke in a half-whisper;\r\nstoutly, but his heart was beating fast. He drew his knife and opened\r\nits blade. \"Come on, Zee. And listen, you keep close to me. Whatever\r\nhappens, we must keep together. And if you see anything--or hear\r\nanything--don't speak. Just touch my arm.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey started, creeping silently along the rocks in the fog. It seemed\r\nmiles. The water was hot beside them. The fog, like a gray curtain,\r\nopened reluctantly before their advance. Presently the ghostly outlines\r\nof houses were visible, a group of them clinging forlornly together\r\nnear the shore. Wooden platforms like balconies connected them. A\r\nbridge came over and down to the rocks.\r\n\r\nThen other buildings. A large one of two stories, backed against the\r\ncliff-face. Martt and Zee went under it, groping in the blackness among\r\nits piling. The close, heavy air smelt of fish.\r\n\r\nThey came out to find that the rocky shore had ended. A narrow incline\r\nwalk led out and up over the water to another group of ghostly\r\nbuildings. They were some thirty feet away, standing on stilts some ten\r\nfeet high. In the gray darkness of the fog their shadowy outlines were\r\nbarely visible.\r\n\r\nMartt stopped. \"Zee,\" he whispered, \"how far are we from the nearest\r\nriver-mouth?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not far,\" she said. \"Listen.\"\r\n\r\nIn the silence he heard the rush of water. As he stood there, suddenly\r\nthis whole adventure seemed impractical. There were no giants here.\r\nThey had all gone on, up into largeness unfathomable, taking Leela\r\nand Frannie with them. How could he follow? Even if he dared plunge\r\nunder the mountains, he could never reach that outer realm. It was\r\ngigantic--compared to his present size it might be a million miles away.\r\n\r\nOr, if there were giants still lurking here in Reaf, of what use to\r\nseek them out and be killed by them?\r\n\r\nFor an instant Martt hopelessly considered turning back. But he never\r\nreached the decision; Zee's fingers gripped his arm--cold, shuddering\r\nfingers. He stared, as he saw her staring, and within him his blood\r\nseemed to stop its flow.\r\n\r\nSomething was coming down the narrow incline bridge at the foot of\r\nwhich Martt and Zee were standing frozen, transfixed with horror.\r\nSomething . . . in all the dark murk of fog Martt could not make it\r\nout. An animal? It seemed oblong, the size of a large dog. He could see\r\nits moving legs--eight or ten legs, moving as it walked. He felt Zee\r\nstir beside him; he withstood his impulse to run. That would make too\r\nmuch noise; the thing would bound after them--catch them. . . .\r\n\r\nThere was a rotting post beside Zee. She and Martt crouched there and\r\nwatched with a horrified fascination the thing as it came padding down\r\nthe incline. It was vaguely green-white; it seemed luminous. As it\r\napproached, Martt saw it was a sleek body, moving lithe like a panther.\r\nA green-white thing. And then he saw that it was headless. A blunt end,\r\nwith a gaping, dripping mouth and a shining green eye on a protruding\r\nstalk. It stopped, turned the eye to look upward and back.\r\n\r\nMartt's breath was stopped. In the silence he seemed to hear his own\r\ntumultuously beating heart, and Zee's. The thing was coming on again.\r\nNow Martt could hear sounds from it. A whining; a babbling. And from\r\nthe houses, up there at the end of the incline, came another sound. A\r\ngreat, heavy breathing. A giant was up there asleep! This thing--like\r\nnothing of Zee's world--belonged to the giants! Martt's heart, for all\r\nhis horror, leaped with exultation. A giant, asleep! A giant smaller in\r\nsize now, if he were up in those houses. He would have the drugs; they\r\ncould steal the drugs from him while he slept.\r\n\r\nThe thing on the incline was quite close. It glowed with its own light,\r\ngreenly phosphorescent, like the ghost of something in a dream, leprous\r\nwith its missing head.\r\n\r\nAnother moment. It was passing close beside Martt. A luminous liquid\r\ndripping from the gaping slit of its mouth. Its eye on the stalk peered\r\nahead. Its voice was clearly audible. A whine; and babbling sounds like\r\nwords.\r\n\r\nRevulsion, even more than fear, swept Martt. This thing was muttering\r\nwords! Animal, or human--it was talking, babbling to itself. Strange\r\nwords of an unknown tongue--but human words. Babbling them as though\r\nwith reason unhinged. Gruesome! This leprous thing--leprous of body;\r\nand leprous of mind!\r\n\r\nIt passed within an arm's length of Martt as he crouched. And suddenly,\r\nwithout conscious thought, he struck at it with his naked knife.\r\nHorrible! The knife sank, but the thing was scarce ponderable! Martt's\r\nhand with the knife went down and through the luminous green body, with\r\na feeling of warmth and a wet stickiness, but no more.\r\n\r\nThe force of the blow, unresisted, threw Martt off his balance. He\r\nfell forward, but still clutched the knife. The thing, with a sharp,\r\nhorrible cry of pain, lurched backward. Then stood with its eye\r\nquivering, poised for its attack.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _CHAPTER 4_\r\n\r\n                          THE WILD NIGHT RIDE\r\n\r\n\r\nFrannie forced her way out of the crowded arcade, with its struggling,\r\npanic-stricken occupants. She was confused, terrified. Separated from\r\nme, and then from Martt, her only idea was to find us again; or find\r\nBrett. Outside the arcade she turned aimlessly to where the crowd\r\nmomentarily was least dense. Panic-stricken people--all strangers. Then\r\nshe saw Leela in the shadow of a doorway of the arcade, and ran to her.\r\n\r\n\"Leela! What is it? What has happened?\"\r\n\r\nPeople around them were shouting. Leela said, \"Giants. There is a\r\ngiant off there in the lake. I was looking for Brett. He came out\r\nhere. Oh, Frannie----\"\r\n\r\nThe two girls clung to each other. It was dark where they stood. At\r\nthe moment the crowd had surged the other way. Suddenly Frannie became\r\naware of a dark form looming beside her. A man twice the size of\r\nherself. She tried to scream, but a great palm went over her face. She\r\nfelt herself being jerked from her feet. . . .\r\n\r\nShe half fainted; recovered to find herself in a thicket within a few\r\nfeet of the arcade. Leela was beside her. Leela panted, \"Don't scream,\r\nFrannie! They'll--kill us if we scream!\"\r\n\r\nThe man was with them, and a thick-set lump of a woman. Not so large\r\nnow. Almost normal in size, for they were dwindling. The man was naked\r\nto the waist, a gray-white, barrel-like chest matted with hair. A face,\r\nfearsome with menacing eyes, and a head of matted black locks.\r\n\r\nAnd in the thicket were four horned animals; saddled, like large horses\r\nwith spreading antlers. The animals were dwindling. . . .\r\n\r\nThe man rasped a command at Leela. From his belt he drew small pellets,\r\nwhite like tiny pills of medicine. He thrust one at Leela, forced it\r\ndown her throat. Leela gasped, \"You must take it, Frannie. He says--it\r\nis harmless--but if we resist--he will kill.\"\r\n\r\nThen the man thrust his fingers into Frannie's mouth, his arm holding\r\nher roughly. She gulped, swallowed. It was an acrid taste. . . .\r\n\r\nThe man pushed her roughly from the thicket. And pushed Leela. His\r\ntriumphant laugh was the rasp of a file on metal. Leela and Frannie\r\nstumbled to the wall of the arcade, stood clinging together. And\r\nsuddenly, with the realization of what was upon her, Leela screamed.\r\nAnd Frannie screamed, though she did not yet understand.\r\n\r\nA wave of nausea possessed Frannie. Her head was reeling. Voices\r\nsounded near by--familiar men's voices. My voice, and Brett's! We came\r\nrunning at the sound of the screams.\r\n\r\nFrannie held tight to the swaying Leela as Brett and I rushed up. And\r\nI took Frannie in my arms. Brett was demanding, \"Leela, what is it?\r\nYou're not hurt, are you? What is it?\"\r\n\r\nFrannie wanted to try and tell me. \"Frank--oh----\" She choked; her\r\nthroat was constricted.\r\n\r\nAnd then Frannie really knew! Within my arms she felt herself\r\nshrinking! Growing smaller; but it was not so much that; rather was it\r\nthat my encircling arm was expanding, holding her more loosely.\r\n\r\nWith the horror of it, Brett and I stood apart. Frannie's nausea was\r\npassing; her head was steadier, but dizzy with the strange movement of\r\nthe scene around her. She clung to Leela, and, of everything within her\r\nvision, only Leela was unchanging. The wall of the arcade was slowly\r\npassing upward; its nearer corner was moving slowly away; Brett and\r\nI were growing. Our waists reaching to Frannie's head; and then our\r\nknees. She gazed upward to where, fifteen or twenty feet above her, our\r\nhorrified faces stared down.\r\n\r\nThe mind always takes its personal viewpoint. Frannie and Leela were\r\ndwindling into smallness. But now that the nausea and dizziness\r\nwere past, to them, they alone were normal. Everything else seemed\r\nchanging . . . the whole scene, growing gigantic. . . .\r\n\r\nIt was a slow, crawling growth--a steady, visible movement. The ground\r\nbeneath their feet was a fine white sand. To Frannie's sight this patch\r\nof sand had originally been some ten feet, with the arcade wall on one\r\nside, and a thicket on the other. But the ground was shifting outward\r\nwith herself as a center. Under her bare feet she could feel its steady\r\nmovement--drawing outward, shifting so that her feet were drawn apart.\r\nShe had to move them constantly.\r\n\r\nBeside her now she saw my foot and ankle as large as herself; the\r\ntowering shafts of my legs--my face a hundred feet or more above her.\r\nThe arcade wall stretched up almost out of sight--lantern-flowers\r\nloomed up there like great colored suns. . . . The thicket was a\r\nhundred feet away--a tangle of jungle.\r\n\r\nThen Frannie saw the giant Brett reach down and pick Leela up on his\r\nhand--saw Leela whirled gasping into the air. A moment, then Brett set\r\nher gently back on the ground. She was some twenty feet from Frannie.\r\nShe ran, half stumbled across the rough white ground until again the\r\ngirls were together.\r\n\r\nThe arch of my sandaled foot was now as tall as Frannie. The arcade\r\nwall was very distant; the thicket was a blur in the distance. That\r\nsmall patch of white sand had unrolled to a great stony plain. Rough;\r\nyellow-white stones strewn everywhere. Frannie saw my feet and\r\nBrett's--as large as the arcade once had been--moving away with great\r\nsurging bounds up into the air and back. A boulder was near by--a rock\r\nas tall as Frannie. It was visibly growing. She gripped Leela--together\r\nthey crept to the boulder's side, huddled there.\r\n\r\nBut they could not remain still. The boulder was expanding. It towered\r\nover them; but it was drawing away as well, for the ground was\r\nexpanding. Constantly they shifted their position to remain close to\r\nit, to huddle under its protecting curve. It had been a rock taller\r\nthan their heads; it was now a mountain. It loomed above them--a\r\nbulging cliff-face of naked, ragged rock.\r\n\r\nThen it was no longer moving. Everything now had steadied; the ground\r\nwas motionless. A normality came to Leela and Frannie. Their terror\r\nfaded into apprehension, and a desire, a determination to do what they\r\ncould to help themselves. They stood up and looked around them.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\nThey were in the midst of a vast, rock-strewn plain, illumined by a\r\nhalf twilight. It seemed miles in extent--a rolling country of naked\r\nrock over which, for a sky, hung a remote murk of distance. A naked\r\nlandscape, rolling upward to a circular horizon, with the circular\r\nmountain of rock standing beside them at its center.\r\n\r\nLeela now seemed quite calm. She said, \"We are not unfathomably small.\r\nToo small for Brett to see us, but not if he gets a glass to magnify.\r\nHe will mark the spot where we are--he will do something, Frannie--we\r\nmust not be too much frightened.\"\r\n\r\nThere seemed nothing that they could do to help themselves. No use to\r\nwander; though no great harm either, for they could roam for miles over\r\nthis rocky waste to cover no more than a foot or two of the white sand\r\nBrett would be guarding.\r\n\r\nTo Frannie's imagination came the thought of insects! A crawling ant in\r\nthat white sand would now be a monster gigantic! She gazed around in\r\nterror, but there was nothing of the kind in sight.\r\n\r\nA desolate landscape, empty of movement. Frannie's heart leaped. In the\r\ndistance something was moving! She gripped Leela.\r\n\r\n\"There's something out there--something moving out there!\"\r\n\r\nTiny moving specks. Too terrified to run, the girls stood staring.\r\nA mile or two away, specks were moving across the rocky plain. They\r\nseemed coming nearer. They separated into four specks. Four gray\r\nblobs, coming swiftly forward.\r\n\r\nIn a few moments they were distinguishable. Four running animals,\r\nbounding, leaping over the rocks. Animals with horns. Two of them\r\nrunning free; two with riders.\r\n\r\nLeela gasped, \"That's the giant! And the woman! They're coming to find\r\nus!\"\r\n\r\nFor a moment the two girls stood transfixed, heedless that they would\r\nbe discovered. To Frannie came the thought: The giant, the woman and\r\nthe four animals had been dwindling. They had stood in the thicket,\r\nhiding from Brett. They were coming from the thicket now, riding over\r\nthe vast rocky plain headlong to regain their captives. Brett could not\r\nsee them; they were too small. Brett was probably standing a few feet\r\nfrom here on the sand--afraid to come closer for fear of treading upon\r\nthe girls; and those few feet were miles away across this naked desert.\r\n\r\nThe four animals came leaping forward. They ran low to the ground,\r\nnecks extended like huge dogs on a trail. Already they were no more\r\nthan half a mile away. The figures of the riding man and woman showed\r\nplainly. They all seemed about normal size as compared to Frannie and\r\nLeela.\r\n\r\nAbruptly Frannie recovered her wits. \"We must hide! They must not find\r\nus!\"\r\n\r\nThey hid, out of sight around a corner of the lower rock-face of the\r\nmountain; crouched, waiting with wildly beating hearts.\r\n\r\nBut it was useless. Either they had been seen or the animals scented\r\nthem. Soon they heard the man calling his mount. No noise of galloping\r\nhoofs, for the beasts ran lightly on padded feet. A moment, then the\r\nanimals burst into view around the jutting rock; bounded up and stopped\r\nbefore the crouching girls.\r\n\r\nThe man dismounted. His grin was a leer of triumph. He spoke to\r\nLeela--a harsh, guttural command in her own language, as he had spoken\r\nbefore when he forced the drug upon her.\r\n\r\nLeela dragged herself to her feet, and Frannie after her. The man spoke\r\nagain. Less harshly this time, and at greater length. He gestured at\r\nFrannie.\r\n\r\nLeela said, with a quiver in her voice that she tried to hold to\r\ncalmness, \"He tells me that his name is Rokk. This woman here is his\r\nmate--he calls her Mobah. He says they come from a very big world--down\r\nhere to our world of infinite smallness. Oh, Frannie, what can we do?\r\nHe says they are going to take us with them, up there to that Giant\r\nWorld.\"\r\n\r\nFrannie, too, strove for calmness. \"Ask him--why? What harm have we\r\ndone to him? Tell him--we don't want to go----\"\r\n\r\nLeela turned to this man who had called himself Rokk. Then she appealed\r\nto the woman--but the woman stared dumbly and turned away.\r\n\r\n\"Frannie--he says we will learn later what he wants. He says--we will\r\nnot be harmed if we cause no trouble. We are going--he says he is going\r\nto take us----\"\r\n\r\n\"Which way?\" Frannie interrupted.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. I suppose to Reaf.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ask him.\"\r\n\r\nLeela asked him. \"Yes, by way of Reaf. He says we will mount the\r\nanimals--he calls them dhranes. They run very swiftly--as Brett\r\ndescribes your wolves of the northern ice-fields of your Earth.\"\r\n\r\nFrannie demanded, \"He says we go to Reaf?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. We will cross the island--out the lagoon--riding the dhranes as\r\nthey swim.\"\r\n\r\nMemory of the island--the arcade--the lagoon and the lake came to\r\nFrannie. The island! It seemed so remote, so gigantic. This vast rocky\r\nwaste surrounding them now was only a small patch of white sand beside\r\nthe arcade wall.\r\n\r\nShe said swiftly, \"Leela, ask him how we can ever do that when we are\r\nso small? Why, it must be hundreds of miles--for us in this size--just\r\nto reach the shore of the island.\"\r\n\r\n\"I told him that. He said, 'Of course.' He said he has been riding from\r\nthe thicket ever since he got small enough to avoid Brett's sight.\r\nWhile they were still diminishing they were riding. He was afraid Brett\r\nwould see them--but he had to take that chance.\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean,\" said Frannie breathlessly, \"tell him we must get larger. It\r\nis too far in this small size. Tell him you know the island and the\r\nlake well--we will help him escape----\"\r\n\r\nLeela nodded eagerly. \"So that if we get large, Brett may see us?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Try and get him to make us large at once--now. Tell him we'll\r\nhelp him----\"\r\n\r\nRokk grinned sardonically at Leela's words. Leela turned to Frannie in\r\nchagrin.\r\n\r\n\"He says he will do as he thinks best--and we will do as we are told.\"\r\n\r\nRokk added another command. Leela said, \"We must mount the dhranes,\r\nFrannie. I think we had better do as he says--and not talk. Can you\r\nride a saddle like that?\"\r\n\r\nFrom Frannie's viewpoint, the dhranes were now about the size of\r\nsmall horses--four-legged, long-haired, shaggy beasts with crooked,\r\nwide-spreading antlers. They moved as though on springs. Frannie was\r\nreminded by their movements of giant leopards she had seen in cages on\r\nEarth. But they seemed gentle, docile enough. The saddles were oblong,\r\npadded with fur, with a high and a low foot-rail, both upon the same\r\nside, on which the rider's feet could rest.\r\n\r\n\"I can ride that,\" said Frannie; and nimbly mounted. There was no\r\nbridle; Frannie leaned forward and clutched the antlers. Leela mounted.\r\nRokk moved his dhrane about by spoken words, and by slapping its\r\nhaunches with his hands.\r\n\r\nLeela said, \"He is going to give us some of the drug, Frannie. Some\r\nnow--to make us larger. But before we are very large he says we will\r\nbe beyond the arcade, in the woods where Brett can not see us. We will\r\nride very fast----\"\r\n\r\nThe animals lapped their drug eagerly. The man and woman took theirs,\r\nwith Leela and Frannie. To Frannie again came a moment of nausea--a\r\nreeling of the senses. But it was quickly passed.\r\n\r\nRokk shouted. Frannie tensed herself. The dhrane under her bounded\r\nforward. The ride began.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\nAt first Frannie clung tensely to the antlers; but soon she found it\r\nwas not necessary to do so. The dhrane ran with long, smooth bounds;\r\nsure-footed on the rocks as a chamois, noiseless, lithe as a great cat.\r\nIt ran, with head extended, low to the ground; beneath her, Frannie\r\ncould feel the play of its smooth muscles, rippling under its shaggy\r\nskin.\r\n\r\nThe woman Mobah rode her dhrane behind Frannie. Leela was directly\r\nahead, with Rokk leading. In single file they bounded forward. Leela's\r\nblack hair and draperies flew in the wind. She rode, bending forward,\r\nher body loosely responsive to the animal's bounds.\r\n\r\nThe wind of their forward movement sang in Frannie's ears. The ground\r\nfled by under her with a blur of yellow movement. And all around her\r\nwas the murky night, rushing at her, passing, and closing in behind.\r\n\r\nA wild, night ride like the fairy dream of a child. Wild, and\r\nfree . . . a fairy dream. . . .\r\n\r\nAn exaltation was upon Frannie; she urged her mount to greater speed.\r\nAnd thought of the drug she had taken. . . .\r\n\r\nThe drug was acting. The rushing night seemed shrinking. Everywhere\r\nthe murk was contracting. The ground was smoothing and turning from\r\nits yellow to white. Overhead a remote--very remote--spot of red light\r\nshone like a dying sun in the heavens. A lantern-flower! Frannie's\r\nheart leaped with triumph. They were growing larger. . . .\r\n\r\nShe heard Rokk shout to his dhrane; felt her own mount stretch\r\ncloser to the ground as the speed was increasing. The rushing night\r\ncontracting . . . they seemed riding up . . . and up . . . the ground,\r\nthe night was shrinking under them. . . .\r\n\r\nA wild, night ride up through a fairy's dream . . . it seemed endless.\r\nWildly free, with the exaltation of a child's fancy upon it. . . .\r\n\r\nFrannie became aware that the vast rocky plain was shrunken to a\r\nsmoother level. And ahead now, she saw a great forest, with colored\r\nsuns about it. Soon they were in the forest. A jungle. Flat, orange\r\nstalks of grass twenty feet high. The dhranes bounded through them.\r\nShaggy outlines of tree trunks, each vast as a mountain. They rose into\r\nunfathomable murky distance overhead. But these were all dwindling. The\r\ngiant jungle was shrinking . . . passing slowly, but ever faster.\r\n\r\nA fantasy . . . the dream of a child. . . .\r\n\r\nRokk called again. Their pace slackened. Frannie saw an open space\r\nahead. Coarse white sand--a patch of it half a mile in extent. Beyond\r\nit a broad beach. Water shining off there. The lake, with stars above\r\nit.\r\n\r\nThe dhranes ran more slowly. The white open space shrank as they\r\ntraversed it. The beach rushed at them. It had narrowed. Frannie saw\r\nit as almost of normal aspect--the narrow shore of the island. The lake\r\nwas starlit--beautiful.\r\n\r\nRokk paused a moment at the water's edge. Frannie gazed around.\r\nThe woods were behind them. A large, dark tree-trunk was near by\r\non the shore. Frannie gazed that way idly; and though she did not\r\nknow it, Martt and Zee were crouching there, staring with a confused\r\nfascination. A moment. The shore shrunk further; the water had advanced\r\nto lap the stamping, impatient feet of the dhranes. Rokk spoke softly.\r\nHis dhrane waded in, with the others following.\r\n\r\nFrannie again gripped her beast's horns. The water rose almost to the\r\nsaddle. It was warm and pleasant. The dhrane swam smoothly, swiftly,\r\nwith neck stretched out, nose skimming the surface.\r\n\r\nA dwindling silver lake. Ripples of silver-green phosphorescence; lines\r\nof silver fire diverging behind the swimming animals. . . .\r\n\r\nFrannie turned to gaze at the receding island. An island already\r\nshrunken, dotted with shrinking colored lights. And ahead, the empty\r\nstarlit lake.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IV\r\n\r\nRiding over the land, it had been a breathless whistling of wind, a\r\nswift surging of the ground beneath Frannie's feet. Here in the lake it\r\nwas quiet and calm; the warm lapping of the silver-streaked water; the\r\nquiet stars overhead. Frannie heard Rokk talking back over his shoulder\r\nto Leela, and then Leela drew in her mount and spoke to Frannie.\r\n\r\n\"He says the giants have all gone back through Reaf to their own world.\r\nOne was wading out here toward Reaf. He was very large then; he is to\r\nstay in Reaf on guard, while we go on. He is there now--it is not far.\"\r\n\r\n\"How big are we, Leela? Did he say?\" There was no way, here in the\r\nlake, by which size could be compared. The exaltation of the ride--its\r\nswift, tempestuous movement--the wild, romantic fantasy of it--all this\r\nwas leaving Frannie. A depression was upon her. She added, \"Oh, Leela,\r\nBrett did not see us! And Frank--will we ever see them again?\"\r\n\r\nLeela said, \"We are about twice normal size--it will not be far to\r\nReaf, swimming like this.\" In the starlight, Frannie could see that\r\nLeela was smiling; a wistful, heavy-hearted smile. She was trying to be\r\nbrave. And Frannie smiled back.\r\n\r\n\"We mustn't get frightened, Leela. Just watch our chance--try to\r\nescape. You stay by me all you can. I mean--when we get\"--there was a\r\ncatch in her voice--\"when we get--under the mountains beyond Reaf.\"\r\n\r\nLeela nodded. Rokk was calling, and Leela urged her dhrane forward.\r\n\r\nSoon the left-hand shore and the mountains ahead were visible. The\r\nwater grew warmer. Small islands appeared. The dhranes panted with the\r\nheat of the water; in the muddy channels between the islands, sometimes\r\nthey floundered. Steam was in the air; ahead it lay like a bank of fog,\r\nwith the frowning mountains rising above it.\r\n\r\nPresently, through the fog, the houses of Reaf came into view. Small\r\nghostly outlines of houses on stilts. To the right of them was a\r\nyawning black mouth where one of the rivers plunged into the mountain.\r\nThe turgid current was swinging that way; Rokk urged the dhrane across\r\nit, to the left.\r\n\r\nSoon they were swimming among the houses. These seemed very small.\r\nFrannie reached up from the dhrane's back and laid her hand on the\r\nroof of one as she passed it. Rokk was heading inshore. The mountain\r\nhere was a frowning cliff-face, with a very narrow ledge at the water\r\nlevel. The ledge ended in a wooden incline bridge leading upward to a\r\ngroup of buildings near shore. Six or eight small houses with doors\r\nand rectangles of windows, clustered there together, perched on stiff\r\nwooden legs over the water. The incline bridge connected them with the\r\nshore, and they were strung together by a broad wooden platform.\r\n\r\nRokk shouted, and from behind the buildings a giant appeared. He had\r\nbeen sitting in the water. He stood up, with mud and slime dripping\r\nfrom him. A man, like Rokk, but younger. His hair was sleek and black,\r\nand fell long to his bared chest, across which a skin was draped. His\r\nface was broad and flat, and hairless. He stood with the water to his\r\nknees, beside the buildings with his arm arched over their roofs as he\r\nleaned against them.\r\n\r\nHe smiled. He called, \"_Ae_, Rokk!\" And Rokk answered, \"_Ae_, Degg.\"\r\n\r\nThey spoke together. Then they spoke in Leela's language. Leela\r\nmurmured to Frannie, \"This man Degg is to remain here until we are\r\nsafely above.\"\r\n\r\nRokk issued his commands. Degg sat down again in the water, waist-deep,\r\nwith his arms holding his hunched-up knees. He yawned and waved his\r\nhand as Rokk swam his dhrane away.\r\n\r\nAgain in single file, they swam. As they passed the buildings Frannie\r\nchanced to glance up. On the porch-like platform up there she caught\r\na glimpse of a green-white shape--a thing stretched out somnolent--a\r\nthing, headless!\r\n\r\nIt was only a glimpse. Frannie's swimming dhrane carried her beyond\r\nsight of it. . . . She was shuddering.\r\n\r\nThe water now was unpleasantly hot. The current was strong. It was\r\nbeginning to ripple the water. Ugly, white ripples . . . sinister.\r\n\r\nThe dhranes swam with the moving water. But they tossed their heads,\r\nuneasy. . . . Rokk was continually shouting, forcing his mount forward.\r\n\r\nThere were no houses here. The cliff-face was moving swiftly past. And\r\nthen a black mouth swept into view. A hundred feet high and twice as\r\nbroad. A mouth, with steam like the fetid breath of a monster. . . .\r\n\r\nThe water was sweeping that way. Surging in a torrent. White water,\r\nleaping over jagged rock-points that split it into foam. . . .\r\n\r\nAnd from the mouth came a sullen roaring. . . .\r\n\r\nFrannie's dhrane lifted its head with a sharp bleat of fear. Its body\r\nwas swung sidewise by the tumbling water, but it recovered and swam\r\ndesperately.\r\n\r\nThe roaring rose to a deafening torrent of sound. White water was\r\nleaping everywhere. Frannie half closed her eyes; she could see a\r\nwhirling blob which was Leela ahead of her. Then the black mouth opened\r\nto encompass the world as Frannie was swept into it.\r\n\r\nAn inferno of roaring blackness. . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _CHAPTER 5_\r\n\r\n                 CLIMBING INTO LARGENESS UNFATHOMABLE\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the fog and darkness at the foot of the incline, Martt stood tense,\r\nwith upraised knife. The green-white thing was poised for its leap. It\r\nwas not babbling now; its eye on the stalk glared balefully. A shudder\r\nswept Martt, as Frannie had shuddered an hour before when she and Leela\r\npassed this way, and she had caught a glimpse of this thing lying\r\nsomnolent on the platform above.\r\n\r\nMartt muttered, \"Stay back, Zee.\" And then the headless thing leaped.\r\nMartt caught it on his outflung hand and knife, but did not stop it. He\r\nfelt his hand sinking within it--a soft, sticky warmth. Its body came\r\non, and struck his chest--a blow as though a soft, yielding pillow had\r\nstruck him.\r\n\r\nThere was a moment, there in the darkness, of unutterable horror as\r\nMartt felt and saw his body mingled with the body of this gleaming\r\nthing clawing at him. He struck wildly, fighting, kicking in a panic of\r\nfutility. Wet, warm and sticky! He seemed to tear its body apart. But\r\nthe glowing, lurid outlines, wavering, came back always into shape.\r\n\r\nThe thing itself was in a panic. Lunging, twisting. Its claws scraped\r\nMartt's face, too imponderable to scratch. The slit of its mouth\r\nopened to grip his throat; its teeth sank impotently within his flesh.\r\nPressing against him . . . the slime of it was warm, with a stench,\r\nnoisome. . . .\r\n\r\nHorrible! A nausea made Martt reel. And the thing now was crying with\r\nterrible, frightened cries. But they were low, suppressed.\r\n\r\nMartt staggered. And suddenly the lurid green shape gathered itself and\r\nfled. Martt saw a quivering dark wound in its side. It fled whimpering\r\nalong the rocks of the shore and disappeared.\r\n\r\nMartt relaxed. He was unhurt. He stooped to the water and washed the\r\nstickiness from him. He felt a wild, hysterical desire to laugh.\r\n\r\n\"Zee, it--that thing was as frightened as I was!\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you all right, Martt? It's gone! What was it?\" She clutched at him\r\nanxiously.\r\n\r\n\"Yes--all right. It couldn't hurt me and I couldn't hurt it. Not much.\"\r\nHe laughed again, but suddenly sobered. \"Zee, there's a giant up there\r\nasleep. Hear him?\"\r\n\r\nThey listened. From up there in the fog the deep, heavy breathing\r\nstill sounded. Martt whispered, \"You wait here, Zee. I'll creep up on\r\nhim--get the drugs.\" He turned to her tensely. \"Zee, you stay here.\r\nClose against the rocks. Whatever happens, you stay here. I'll--if I\r\nget the drugs--I'll make myself very large. Kill him--then I'll come\r\nback to you. Don't move--whatever happens.\"\r\n\r\nHe left her. The wooden incline sloped sharply upward. The fog\r\nmomentarily seemed clearing. Martt saw above him the outlines of the\r\nhouses, a broad platform connecting them. And stretched the length\r\nof the platform was the huge, recumbent figure of a man. He seemed\r\nabout forty feet tall. He lay hunched, cramped for space, with one arm\r\nupflung to the roof of a house, and one leg dangling nearly to the\r\nwater.\r\n\r\nMartt reached the platform. He crept past the giant's legs. The waist,\r\nwrapped in a skin, was rising and falling with the giant's breathing.\r\nMartt's own breath was held. His heart was thumping wildly. The giant\r\nstirred; Martt stepped nimbly aside to avoid the movement of the great\r\nbody.\r\n\r\nAt the giant's waist he paused, reached up, fumbling. There seemed a\r\nbelt here, with pockets. The drugs should be there. The bulge of the\r\ngiant's middle was nearly as high as Martt's chest as he stood upright.\r\nHe reached up, and over, feeling with careful fingers.\r\n\r\nWith a thrill of triumph, Martt found two cylinders, each as long\r\nas his forearm. In the starlight he opened them, drew from each a\r\nflat, square tablet of compressed powder. The drugs! But which was\r\nfor growth and which for shrinkage? One was larger than the other. It\r\nsuggested growth. It was flat and square--the length of Martt's thumb.\r\nImpulsively he would have crushed it in his mouth and swallowed it.\r\nBut a thought gave him pause. This giant was nearly seven times larger\r\nthan himself. This expanded dose of the drug then would be too great.\r\nMartt bit off a corner of the white tablet. Swallowed it. An acrid\r\ntaste. . . . He replaced the remainder in the cylinder and put both\r\ncylinders in his pocket, tying his jacket close around them. Would they\r\nexpand with his body? He could only hope so.\r\n\r\nExpand? How did he know but that he had taken the wrong drug? Well, he\r\ncould soon rectify that. . . . A panic swept Martt that the giant might\r\nawaken too soon. . . . The drug was taking effect; Martt was sick and\r\ndizzy. He reeled to a post at an outer corner of the platform. Clung\r\nthere. He all but slipped and fell into the water ten feet below.\r\n\r\nA moment, then the sickness passed. He was growing! He could feel\r\nthe post shrinking within his grip. The outlines of the houses were\r\ncontracting. The knife in his hand, already tiny, slipped and fell into\r\nthe water with a splash.\r\n\r\nThe post soon was too small for Martt to hold. He reached over and\r\nsteadied himself upon the grass roof of the nearest house. It was\r\nmelting under his hands. The sleeping giant lay at his feet, a giant no\r\nlonger; a man, like himself--the two of them crowding a tiny, flimsy\r\nplatform with toy houses beside it, and black water flowing sluggishly\r\nclose underneath.\r\n\r\nA sense of power swept Martt. A triumph. He was not afraid of this man,\r\nunarmed like himself. Already the man was undersized. . . . Why, Martt\r\ncould grip him, choke him! . . . These toy houses--a sweep of Martt's\r\narm would have scattered them.\r\n\r\nMartt was bending awkwardly over the roof-tops. A ripping, tearing\r\nnoise sounded. The platform, the houses, quivered, wavered, collapsed!\r\nThe whole structure, bending beneath the weight of the two huge bodies,\r\ngave way. Martt found himself floundering in warm, muddy water,\r\nentangled in a debris of splintered wood and grasslike house-roofs.\r\n\r\nAnd with him, his antagonist, awakened to a startled confusion,\r\nfloundering, struggling to get upon his feet.\r\n\r\nMartt rose to his knees. The shallow lake bottom was sticky with mud.\r\nA house-roof hung upon his shoulder. He heaved it off; stood upright,\r\ndripping, breathless. The other man was up also. In the starlight, amid\r\nthe floating wreckage, they faced each other. Martt was the taller; and\r\nhe was still growing. He saw his enemy shrinking before him. A slim\r\nyoung fellow, with long black hair. A broad, flat face, with a startled\r\nsurprize on it.\r\n\r\nMartt laughed. And shouted, \"I've got you now!\" He would have leaped.\r\nBut abruptly he recalled Zee, tiny in size, huddled there by the shore.\r\nA lunge of his body--or of this other man's body--a flip of one of\r\nthese torn housebeams--and Zee would be killed. . . .\r\n\r\nMartt turned and waded rapidly away. He wondered if the other man would\r\nfollow him. Martt wanted to get him farther out into the lake. It was\r\nan error; for as Martt turned to look back, he saw his antagonist's\r\nhand go to his belt; and then to his mouth. More of the drug! Martt\r\nthought that he had in his own pocket all there was of it here. But\r\nthe giant had more. Already he was growing. As Martt stood undecided,\r\nhe saw the giant growing like himself. He was smaller than Martt now,\r\nbut growing more swiftly. He stood for an instant with his arms upflung\r\ntoward the stars; then he came wading forward.\r\n\r\nThe mountains were at Martt's right hand. Shrinking, swiftly\r\ncontracting. The water now came not much over his ankles; a small patch\r\nof wreckage marked where the collapsed buildings had stood.\r\n\r\nMartt retreated slightly; he turned, moved to the cliff-face with his\r\nback against it.\r\n\r\nThen, with a swirl of water, his enemy rushed at him. Martt met the\r\nrush unyielding. They locked. Swaying, struggling each to throw the\r\nother. The lake at their ankles was lashed white. They fought silently,\r\ngrimly. The fellow was strong; he pushed Martt backward against the\r\nMountain. His hands strove for Martt's throat. But Martt ripped them\r\naway. With a body-hold he bent his adversary backward; but always he\r\ncould feel the man's body swelling within his grasp.\r\n\r\nA desperation seized Martt. If he could not win now, at once, he would\r\nlose. This fellow was growing too large. Beside them, as they swayed,\r\nMartt caught a glimpse of the mountain. It was now a cliff not much\r\nhigher than his head. At his feet Martt was dimly aware of a small\r\nblack hole in the cliff into which water was rushing.\r\n\r\nOne of Martt's legs was wrapped around the legs of his adversary; and\r\nsuddenly the man tipped. They went down together, Martt on top. It was\r\nlike falling into a puddle of water. They lunged, rolled over. And then\r\nthe giant rose, with Martt clinging to him. He was much larger than\r\nMartt now; he heaved himself upward, flung Martt against the cliff.\r\nMartt's head and shoulders went over its top. Jagged spires of rock;\r\nloose rocks lying there. The giant jerked Martt back; he fell on his\r\nfeet; saw his antagonist towering over him.\r\n\r\nBut in Martt's hand now was a jagged lump of rock which he had snatched\r\nfrom the cliff. He flung it, and it caught the giant full on the\r\nforehead. He staggered, and as his grip on Martt loosened, Martt leaped\r\naway.\r\n\r\nAnd the giant came crashing down, his huge body falling before the hole\r\nin the mountain; blocking it so that the surging lake backed up with a\r\ndeepening torrent of the hot, black water.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\nMartt stood panting in the starlight. He had won. The scene around\r\nhim was still dwindling, but in a moment it stopped. Cliffs to his\r\nshoulder. A shrunken, shallow lake. Its tiny flat islands were no\r\nbigger than his foot. Along its shore where the cliff ended he could\r\nsee the open country. Tiny threads of roads. An island with points\r\nof colored light--the island of the festival. At his feet, miniature\r\nhouses on stilts, many of them strewn on the water, trampled by this\r\ncombat of giants in which he had been victorious.\r\n\r\nAnd the fallen giant there in the water, blocking the river-mouth, the\r\nwater deepening against his side.\r\n\r\nMartt took a cautious step. Zee was down there somewhere. Then he saw\r\nher figure, dimly, in the mist which hung over the lake at his ankles.\r\nShe seemed about the size of his finger. She was standing at the\r\nwater's edge, waving up to him.\r\n\r\nHe bent down--carefully. He said softly, \"I see you, Zee. You must get\r\nlarger. I'll give you some of the drug to take.\"\r\n\r\nShe shouted, \"Yes.\" It was a very tiny voice, echoing from far away.\r\n\r\nMartt's jacket had been partly torn from him. One of his shoulders was\r\nbare, bleeding from where he had been thrown against the cliff-top. He\r\nstooped and dashed water upon the wound; and saw Zee crouch and shield\r\nherself from the deluge of water he splashed.\r\n\r\nHe thought, \"Careful, Martt;\" and from his pocket drew one of the\r\ncylinders. The tablets of the drug still were the size of his thumb.\r\nHe took one, laid it carefully at the water's edge, near Zee. It was\r\nnearly the size of her body. She walked to it, examined it.\r\n\r\n\"Break it,\" he said. \"Eat some--about the size of your thumb.\"\r\n\r\nHe could hardly have seen a speck of it so small. Zee found a loose\r\nrock. She pounded at the white tablet. Ate a fragment. And presently\r\nMartt gave her some of the other drug to stop her growth; and she was\r\nhis own size, standing beside him, gazing at the shrunken scene in\r\nwonderment.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\nThey stood consulting over what they should do. They had the precious\r\ndrugs. Should they return with them to Brett, or go on and rescue\r\nFrannie and Leela? Martt was confident. With the drugs in his pocket,\r\nall sense of fear was passed. It was obvious that the world here was in\r\nno danger. This fallen giant at their feet was the last. But Frannie\r\nand Leela were captured; were taken up to that other realm. To delay\r\nfollowing would be most dangerous of all.\r\n\r\nAnd Zee agreed. Her eyes were sparkling. She stretched out her white\r\narms. She said, \"With this power we would be cowards to turn back----\"\r\n\r\nThe giant still had some of the drugs about his person. Martt bent over\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Zee! He isn't dead!\"\r\n\r\nThe young giant's face was white; blood was on his forehead where the\r\nrock had struck. He opened his eyes; rolled over in the water. The\r\ndammed river surged again into its black hole.\r\n\r\n\"Zee, look! He isn't dead!\"\r\n\r\nHe sat up; smiled in a daze, struggled to rise to his feet but could\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nThe rock which Martt had hurled lay like a great boulder in the lake.\r\nMartt seized it, but Zee caught his wrist.\r\n\r\n\"Martt! Don't----\"\r\n\r\nA sense of shame struck at Martt; he dropped the rock. \"Zee, can you\r\ntalk to him--try if he understands your language.\"\r\n\r\nShe spoke, and the young giant answered. He was trying to smile,\r\ngrateful for the words. Zee stooped and splashed water on his wounded\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\n\"Martt, he says his name is Degg--he has seen Leela and Frannie--a man\r\nand woman took them into the river-mouth.\"\r\n\r\nThe fellow did not seem greatly hurt. He was frightened, watchful, but\r\ndocile enough. Martt took the drugs from him. \"Ask him the way up to\r\nhis world--it will help us----\"\r\n\r\nIt was the one thing that would help them! Martt realized it.\r\n\r\nDegg, outwardly at least, seemed friendly enough. When Zee promised\r\nthat they would not hurt him--would take him to his own world, the only\r\nway he would ever get there, since he had no drugs--he agreed readily\r\nto lead them.\r\n\r\n\"But we must be careful,\" said Martt. \"Never let him get larger than\r\nourselves. And watch him, always.\"\r\n\r\nAt Degg's direction, first they diminished their stature until,\r\ncompared to the buildings of Reaf, they were about fifty feet tall.\r\nDegg said, in Zee's language, \"We wade now into the black river. Rokk\r\nlikes to swim--but wading is easier.\"\r\n\r\nThey were ready to start. Soon they would be beyond this world--up into\r\nlargeness unfathomable. Martt said, \"We must leave some message for\r\nBrett. Let him know what became of us.\"\r\n\r\nThere was no way to leave a written message. Conspicuously on a rock\r\nnear the shore, Martt left the broad belt of his jacket. As he turned\r\naway, Degg was calling softly, \"_Ae!_ Eeff! Eeff, come here!\" The\r\ngreen-white, headless thing was lurking among the rocks. \"Eeff, come\r\nhere!\"\r\n\r\nIt advanced, whimpering. Compared to Martt's fifty-foot stature it\r\nseemed now no bigger than a rat. Martt conquered his aversion and stood\r\nwaiting while it approached. In the starlight it glowed unreal; its eye\r\non the stalk pointed distrustfully at Martt. It stood at Degg's feet;\r\nwhimpering--and mumbling words.\r\n\r\nDegg said to Zee, \"It is afraid of your man. I tell it you will do no\r\nharm. It wants to come with us.\" He stooped over. \"Eeff, you come with\r\nus?\"\r\n\r\nIt understood, partly the words spoken in Zee's language, and partly\r\nthe gesture. It said mouthingly, \"Yes, Eeff come--with you.\"\r\n\r\nUncanny! Horrible! Martt shuddered. Degg was saying, \"It is a very good\r\nfriend to me. May we take it?\"\r\n\r\n\"All right,\" said Martt shortly, when Zee translated. But it worried\r\nhim. He resolved more than ever to watch Degg carefully, and to watch\r\nthis headless thing Degg called a friend.\r\n\r\nThey fed a small morsel of the drug to Eeff, until it had grown to a\r\nsize normal to them. Then they started. The black mouth of the river,\r\nto them in this size, seemed a passageway ten or twelve feet high and\r\ntwice as broad. The river swirled about their legs; hot, with steam\r\nrising. Soon they were in darkness, following the river around a bend.\r\nBut only for a moment. Martt and Zee were hand in hand. Degg was in\r\nadvance; Martt could just distinguish Degg's figure with the shining\r\nblob of Eeff in the water beside him.\r\n\r\nDarkness. But Martt's eyes were growing accustomed to it. And now the\r\nrocks of the caverns seemed to be giving light--a dim phosphorescence.\r\nThe cavern expanded. They waded across a broad, shallow lake where\r\nthe water was calm. Then again into a tunnel. Miles down its tortuous\r\ncourse with the river swirling and tumbling about them.\r\n\r\nSometimes there was a dry ledge upon which they could walk. Sometimes\r\nthe river deepened, and they had to swim. Always Degg advanced grimly,\r\nsteadily, and silently. A foreboding grew upon Martt. Were they going\r\nright? Was this the way Frannie and Leela had gone? Once he whispered,\r\n\"Do you think, Zee, that he's tricking us?\"\r\n\r\nShe shook her head. \"You have all the drugs. He would not dare.\"\r\n\r\nThey had waded for hours. Then ahead of them they saw Degg pause. The\r\nriver here plunged straight down into a black abyss. To the left a\r\npassageway turned upward. It was some ten feet high and two or three\r\ntimes as wide. It went up at an incline into the green, luminous\r\ndarkness. They followed Degg. A mile perhaps, steadily climbing. Martt\r\ncalculated. They had already walked possibly fifteen miles--and they\r\nwere more than eight times the normal size of Zee's world. That was\r\nmore than a hundred and twenty miles underground--most of it downward.\r\n\r\nMartt realized that he was tired. And hungry. Before leaving Reaf he\r\nhad thought of food necessary for this trip. Degg had a concentrated\r\nfood--a dull brown powder. Martt promptly had appropriated it--had\r\ntested it to make sure it was not a size-drug. . . .\r\n\r\nThe passageway abruptly opened into black, empty space. A rocky slope\r\nrolling gently upward, strewn with huge black boulders. It extended as\r\nfar as Martt could see, upward into a luminous darkness. Overhead was a\r\nblack sky--murky with distance.\r\n\r\nDegg stopped. \"We begin getting large here.\"\r\n\r\nZee translated it to Martt.\r\n\r\n\"Let's eat, then,\" said Martt. \"Zee, aren't you tired and hungry?\"\r\n\r\nThere was water lying in flat pools on the rocks. It was clear, cold\r\nand sweet. They sat down, talking and eating. Then Zee slept. And Degg\r\nslept also.\r\n\r\nMartt sat alert, watching, while the headless thing stretched itself\r\nsomnolent on a rock near by, its single eye on the stalk wilting\r\ndownward in drowsiness.\r\n\r\nMartt strove to master his revulsion. He called softly, \"Eeff! Eeff,\r\ncome here!\"\r\n\r\nBut it would not come. It moved farther away, whimpering to itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  IV\r\n\r\n\"Zee, wake up! We've got to get started. You've slept hours.\"\r\n\r\nThe real size-change now began. In single file they walked up the black\r\nslope. It shrank beneath them--creeping, crawling, dwindling away under\r\ntheir feet. The boulders shrank into rocks, into pebbles. In an hour\r\nthey were walking upon a smooth surface.\r\n\r\nThe black void was no longer empty. Mountains showed ahead--and to the\r\nsides. Giant faces of rock, looming into unfathomable distance of the\r\nblack sky. The mountains were drawing closer; contracting, rushing down\r\nwith a violent movement.\r\n\r\nMartt apprehensively glanced behind. A wall of dwindling rock was\r\ncoming after them. The drug in these larger doses seemed acting with a\r\nmultiplied power. The scene was a dizzy swirl of movement. Mountains\r\nclosing in everywhere. To Martt came a flash of terror. They would\r\nbe crushed. Their bodies were growing tremendously to fill this\r\nconstricted space. . . .\r\n\r\nDegg had stopped walking. They were gathered in a group. They were now\r\nin the center of a circular valley, with a ring of mountains closing\r\nin. A ten-mile valley . . . a mile . . . a hundred feet. . . .\r\n\r\nBut the mountains shrank to hills; to a low cliff-wall--a ridge. . . .\r\nIt closed in. . . .\r\n\r\n\"Now!\" shouted Degg. They leaped over the low ledge of encircling rock;\r\nscrambled over it and fell on a level ground above. . . .\r\n\r\nBeside them Martt saw a small jagged hole in the ground. . . . The size\r\nof his waist . . . his fist . . . his finger. . . . It dwindled, closed\r\nand was gone; while again, above them and all about, were black, empty\r\nspaces, filled soon with shrinking canyons out of which hastily they\r\nclimbed. . . .\r\n\r\nA fantasmagoria of climbing, struggling upward to avoid being crushed\r\nby their own growth. . . .\r\n\r\nThere was a canyon too narrow, with sides too high. . . . They had to\r\nstop their growth, and climb its jagged, precipitous side. The climb\r\ntook hours. There was another meal, while Martt slept and Zee remained\r\non guard.\r\n\r\nThen another valley. Broad, with a steeply inclined floor. They grew\r\nout of it; into another; and another. . . .\r\n\r\nMartt became conscious of a change in the air. Cooler, with a dankness.\r\nAnd now at last, overhead the void was no longer black. A suggestion\r\nof purple. And suddenly as they leaped from a chasm which shrank and\r\nclosed under them, Martt saw a sky. Somber purple, with stars.\r\n\r\nA new conception of it all swept Martt. His Earth--the stars of its\r\nUniverse. The Inner Surface of the Atom, Zee's realm--millions of times\r\nlarger. And now--compared to Reaf . . . was he now a million times the\r\nsize of Reaf? . . . Or a million million? Largeness, unfathomable. A\r\nconvex world out here. The surface of a globe, whirling in Space. And\r\noverhead, still other stars, so gigantic--so remote!\r\n\r\n\r\n                                   V\r\n\r\nMartt gazed curiously around. They were at last in Degg's world--the\r\nregion of the Arcs. A tumbled land of crags upon which lay a gray-black\r\nsnow. Martt's heart sank before its utter desolation--a tumbled waste,\r\nupheaved as though by some cataclysm of nature. Desolation! And as\r\nthough to veil it, a fall of blackish snow--a somber, tragic shroud.\r\n\r\nIt was night. And, Martt surmised, a winter season. Yet the air was not\r\ncold; merely dank. And the snow seemed not cold, congealed perhaps by\r\nthe dank, heavy air; but to Martt's touch, not cold, no more than chill.\r\n\r\nWith her bare limbs and filmy veiling, Zee was shivering. Martt\r\ndiscarded his jacket, but she did not want it.\r\n\r\nHe said, \"But you must be cold, Zee.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'm not.\" She shook herself. \"I'm--frightened. This--night up\r\nhere--it's like a tomb, Martt.\"\r\n\r\nTomblike, indeed. A dank, chill silence brooded over the night. And\r\nthen, almost unheralded, it was not night, but day. A small, cold-red\r\nsun leaped up from the distant black horizon. A day of dull, flat\r\nlight. It stained the snow with blood. . . .\r\n\r\nBlood everywhere. . . .\r\n\r\nDegg said somberly to Zee, \"Always blood. It is an omen. . . . My land,\r\ndoomed----\" There was a quiver in Zee's voice as she repeated his words\r\nto Martt.\r\n\r\nThey had come now not to mistrust Degg. He seemed a well-meaning youth.\r\nSimple-minded. He had told them something of his world--of Rokk, and\r\nthe woman Mobah. Degg, in his heart, hated and feared Rokk.\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" demanded Zee.\r\n\r\nHe turned his dark, solemn eyes upon her. \"You are too gentle, little\r\ngirl Zee, to understand. We have many--horrible things here in Arc. I\r\nwould not talk of them with you.\"\r\n\r\nIt had been Rokk's plan, Degg said, to take Leela and Frannie to the\r\nplace where he lived. Degg was to join Rokk there. . . . It was not\r\nso very far. . . . Degg called it Rokk's mound. They were headed that\r\nway now. Soon it would be night again--Martt could do what he thought\r\nwas best toward rescuing the two girl prisoners. And Martt promised he\r\nwould protect Degg.\r\n\r\nVaguely in Martt's mind had been the idea that he could use the\r\ndrugs again now--make himself still larger--catch Rokk unawares. But\r\nthe large drug would take no further effect. The maximum size had\r\nbeen reached. Degg did not know why; save that these drugs were for\r\nsmallness--the large one merely an antidote to the other.\r\n\r\nMartt was left without tangible plan. But his first desire was to get\r\nnear Rokk's mound--whatever sort of place that might be. And he would\r\ndecide then what could be done.\r\n\r\nThe blood-red sun came swiftly up in a low arc, and plunged as swiftly\r\ndown again. To Martt, it had been some half an hour of daylight. Now\r\ncame the brooding night--and in another half-hour the sun would again\r\nmake its low sweep.\r\n\r\nMartt urged Degg forward. Eeff was leading--lurid, green-white against\r\nthe black of the ground. Then it stopped. Its eye quivered; it\r\nscreamed--a long, shuddering, half-human cry of fright.\r\n\r\nDegg stood frozen--a statue in the gloom. And then Martt--and Zee also,\r\nfor she uttered a low, suppressed cry--saw what had frightened Eeff.\r\n\r\nIt was about a hundred feet away--a dull, glowing red as though the\r\nblood of sunlight were upon it. A thing which might have been a long,\r\nblood-red vine. Not animal, but vegetable. It lay on the ground--a\r\ngreat, thick stem, with upflung leafy branches waving like tentacles.\r\nAt intervals, upon long stalks, were round spots of green light.\r\nGleaming, baleful eyes.\r\n\r\nThe thing was lying its length upon the ground. Not quiescent, but\r\neverywhere in quivering, undulating, snakelike movement. Its eyes\r\nseemed all turned this one way. Eyes suggesting an intelligence--a\r\nreasoning behind them. A thing, not animal but vegetable! Its brain,\r\nlacking even the least vestige of human or animal restraint, cast in a\r\nmold unutterably horrible.\r\n\r\nEeff was crouching at Degg's feet, babbling with terror. Degg muttered,\r\n\"It is unrooted! Free! It--I told Rokk they would break free some\r\ntime--before he was ready!\"\r\n\r\n\"Unrooted!\" Zee echoed.\r\n\r\nUnrooted! It was slithering, out there in the darkness. . . . It shrank\r\nto a blood-red blur. . . . It vanished. . . .\r\n\r\nThey went on again. Degg would not talk, save to reiterate fearsomely,\r\n\"I knew they would cast off their roots! Roaming, everywhere. And Rokk\r\nthought he dared to grow them----\"\r\n\r\nA rise of ground lay ahead. Beyond its crest only the purple sky was\r\nvisible, with stars sweeping in rapid, low arcs. Martt, Degg and Zee\r\nwere walking together, with Eeff close before them.\r\n\r\nEeff began whimpering again; then screamed. And ahead, from over the\r\ncrest of the hill, as though in answer came an echoing scream! Yet not\r\nan echo! A scream, human! It drove the blood to Martt's heart; stopped\r\nhis breathing. The scream of a voice familiar--a girl's voice--Frannie!\r\n\r\nFor all the horror surging over him, Martt leaped forward. And stopped,\r\nstricken on the hill-crest.\r\n\r\nBeneath him in the gloom lay a shallow, bowl-like depression. The\r\nstarlight illumined it wanly. Frannie was down there, struggling in\r\nthe grip of a blood-red, vegetable thing! A segment of it was wrapped\r\naround her, dragging her forward. The light of it drenched her with\r\nblood; its myriad green eyes glared throughout its waving length.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"Frannie struggled in the grip of the blood-red,\r\nvegetable thing.\"]\r\n\r\nAnd ahead of it was a line of others of its kind, leading the way,\r\nslithering up and over the opposite slope!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _CHAPTER 6_\r\n\r\n                           THE BLOOD-RED DAY\r\n\r\n\r\nTo Frannie, the subterranean river was an inferno of roaring blackness.\r\nHer dhrane was whirled along, sometimes swimming, sometimes floundering\r\ndesperately. Frannie clung to its antlers and closed her eyes. . . .\r\nAn eternity. . . . She heard Rokk shouting; felt the dhrane scrambling\r\nupon solid ground. The water dropped away from its sides. . . .\r\n\r\nFrannie found herself and her dhrane standing in a dull, luminous\r\ndarkness upon a ledge by the river. The other dhranes were there. Rokk\r\nspoke to Leela.\r\n\r\n\"What does he say?\" Frannie demanded.\r\n\r\n\"He says we must get larger--this is too dangerous.\"\r\n\r\nThey followed then the methods used afterward by Degg in guiding Martt\r\nand Zee. Wading, in a large size, they went down the river. Then into\r\nthe passageway leading upward.\r\n\r\nAnd then the climb into largeness. To Frannie it seemed unending; but\r\nthough they were only an hour or two ahead of Martt in starting, they\r\nwere several hours ahead when they reached the giant world. Frannie and\r\nLeela were near to exhaustion, even though they had ridden most of the\r\nway. Rokk had not paused to sleep.\r\n\r\nIt was day when they reached the desolate land of the Arcs. Then a\r\ntomblike night; then blood-red day again.\r\n\r\nRokk rode now with Frannie and Leela beside him, and the woman Mobah\r\nbehind. Rokk was jubilant. He talked swiftly to Leela. At intervals,\r\nLeela translated.\r\n\r\n\"He says he is glad to have us. He is taking us to his house--his\r\nmound, he calls it. He says, very soon there is something important\r\nhappening up here. He is going to take us--show us it--happening.\"\r\nLeela shuddered.\r\n\r\n\"What is going to happen?\" Frannie demanded.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. Something--sinister, horrible. You saw his face when he\r\ntold me?\"\r\n\r\nFrannie had seen it, indeed, but she was striving to master her fear.\r\nThere was something queerly sinister, inhuman, about Rokk. And his\r\nsmile had a leer to it. Shining in his dark eyes, which often were\r\nfixed thoughtfully on Leela, there was a look Frannie could not fail\r\nto understand. The woman, Mobah, had noticed it. Once, over her broad\r\nexpressionless face a torrent of passion had swept. Hate? Jealousy? It\r\nflashed at Leela--and at Frannie--and was instantly gone.\r\n\r\nFrannie said now, \"Ask him what he wants of us. Why did he ever go\r\ndown into our world?\"\r\n\r\nLeela listened to Rokk's smiling explanation. The man's voice was soft,\r\ncaressing. Leela went white.\r\n\r\n\"He says, Frannie--he says his world here is very harsh--not good to\r\nlive in. There is very little food--he says that he and some other\r\nmen--his followers--are planning to descend into my world and conquer\r\nit. Kill all its men--Frannie, don't you understand?--kill, just the\r\nmen of my world----\"\r\n\r\nThere was a silence. Then Leela added, with a frightened hush to her\r\nvoice, \"Up here all is bleak and terrible. The women are all like this\r\nwoman behind us--unbeautiful----\"\r\n\r\nRokk was riding faster now, and soon, as they ascended a rise of\r\nground, his home came into view. It lay on a falling slope, with paths\r\ntrodden in the snow about it--a bulging mound built of pressed blocks\r\nof the gray-black snow. It rose above the surface perhaps ten feet--an\r\noblong mound twenty feet wide and five times as long, like the grave of\r\nsome giant buried there, with a small upright chimney at its farther\r\nend for a headstone. A few rectangles of white marked its doors and\r\nwindows as though one might care to stand on the ground and gaze down\r\nat the coffin entombed within. Near by, two other mounds lay like the\r\ngraves of children, with beaten paths connecting them.\r\n\r\nRokk's home was set alone in the midst of this snowy waste! Frannie's\r\nheart was cold with apprehension. What was to be her fate--and\r\nLeela's--within?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAt Rokk's call a half-grown boy appeared in a doorway of the main\r\nmound. He led the dhranes away. Frannie and Leela were taken down a\r\ncrude flight of icy steps and into the mound. It was much longer than\r\nit appeared; it seemed to extend at least another story underground,\r\nfor Frannie saw an incline leading downward.\r\n\r\nThey had entered the top story. Rokk led them along a passageway;\r\nFrannie saw low-roofed rooms, with ceilings curved to the mound. Each\r\nwith a window opening at the ground level; and with crude furniture\r\nseemingly fashioned from stone blocks.\r\n\r\nInto such a room Rokk ushered them. He was smiling, bowing like a\r\nfriendly host; his words to Leela were suave. But in his eyes there\r\nwas an unmistakable irony, and when Frannie hesitated at the door, he\r\npushed her roughly.\r\n\r\nMobah had disappeared. Rokk stood a moment talking to Leela. The door\r\nto the passageway was open. Rokk and Leela had their backs to it.\r\nFrannie became aware that beyond the door Mobah was standing listening.\r\nAnd in the dimness there, Frannie caught a glimpse of the woman's\r\nintense face. It was torn with a jealous passion--a torrent of loosed\r\npassion debasing its calm stolidity into an aspect almost bestial.\r\n\r\nAs Rokk turned slightly, the lurking woman silently fled. Rokk bowed\r\nto Frannie, and to Leela--a bow ceremoniously grotesque, but with a\r\ndignity, nevertheless. His hand lingered on Leela's white arm, but\r\nLeela jerked away. He shrugged, smiled, and went through the door,\r\nbarring it after him.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Frannie!\" Leela at last gave way. She sobbed with fright\r\nunrestrained; and this gave Frannie additional strength to be calm. She\r\nsat Leela on the couch--a railed slab of stone, with a litter of furs\r\non it like the bed of an animal. She tried to comfort Leela. Then left\r\nher; tried the door softly. It was stoutly barred.\r\n\r\nThen she tried the window. It had a pane as transparent as glass, but\r\nevidently unbreakable. Frannie struck it recklessly with her fist. And\r\nthere seemed no way to open the window. Through it Frannie could see\r\nalong the snow-covered ground outside. The night had just come. The\r\nground was dark, with faint stars showing above.\r\n\r\nFrannie sat on the bed with Leela. They were both so exhausted that for\r\na time they slept. Hours, perhaps--Frannie never knew. Then she awoke.\r\nThe scene in the room was unchanged. It was night again. Leela was\r\nawake. Frannie began questioning her as to what Rokk most recently had\r\nsaid. Leela was outwardly calm now.\r\n\r\n\"He--insists we are not to be harmed, Frannie. He told me--just before\r\nhe left--that he wanted me to like him.\" A shiver ran over Leela's\r\nfrail body. \"He will work to make me like him--he will be very good to\r\nme. And you--he says there is a young man--that man he left back in\r\nReaf--named Degg. He is sure Degg will like you, Frannie.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did he say any more about that important thing which is going to\r\nhappen?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. He said he is going to take us somewhere--as soon as we have\r\nrested, and Degg has come to join us here. Take us somewhere--where we\r\nshall see a wonderful awesome sight. Frannie, he told me the men here\r\nin this world do not like their women. He has brought me and you--to\r\nshow us to the men--that they may see how beautiful women can be.\r\nThen--they will join him to go down into smallness--to conquer----\"\r\n\r\nLeela choked. She added, and a hush fell upon her voice: \"Frannie, this\r\nRokk has planned it all. He says there is too little food here. The\r\nwomen--and the children that the men no longer want to feed--are all\r\nplaced apart. Exiled to a city--where he is going to take us. And show\r\nus----\"\r\n\r\nA tapping at the window checked her. The girls stared at each other\r\nwith the blood draining from their faces. A gentle tapping from\r\noutside. A scraping, fumbling as though soft fingers were working at\r\nthe window.\r\n\r\nFrannie stood up, trembling. Then she moved along the wall, and with\r\nher face to the window, peered out. The tapping had stopped. Outside\r\nshe saw a faint, lurid red glow. And three gleaming spots of green.\r\nMoving, peering. And then like the tendrils of a creeping vine, a\r\nleafy something, with a red sheen upon it, gently beating at the pane;\r\ntapping--fumbling.\r\n\r\nFrannie drew back. \"Leela--out there----\" But another sound stopped\r\nher. Someone--something--was unbarring the door of their room! The\r\ntwo girls were frozen with terror, incapable of sound or movement.\r\nA bar dropping with a muffled thump! The door slowly began opening\r\ninward. . . .\r\n\r\nIt was the woman Mobah. Her face was grim; her dull eyes were\r\nsmoldering green-black coals. She flung a menacing glance at the girls,\r\nmoved swiftly across the room. Her fingers at the pane touched some\r\nhidden lock. The window swung open.\r\n\r\nMobah darted back, seized Leela, tried to shove her toward Frannie\r\nand the window. Leela screamed, resisted, fought with all her little\r\nstrength and called a warning to Frannie.\r\n\r\nBut it was too late. Through the window a thick, red-glowing tentacle\r\ncame slithering. Its green eyes were waving triumphantly. It caught\r\nFrannie; rolled back upon itself, jerking her upward.\r\n\r\nHeavy steps sounded in the passageway outside the room, and Rokk's\r\nalarmed voice, shouting. Rokk burst in. He knocked Mobah aside with a\r\nblow of his fist, and swept Leela protectingly backward.\r\n\r\nThe segment of red thing within the room slithered out the window,\r\ncarrying Frannie with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\n\"She is gone, my lady Leela. It is unfortunate, but we can not help it.\r\nShe is lost--we shall never see her again.\"\r\n\r\nLeela and Rokk were alone in the room. Leela shrank upon the couch;\r\nagainst his gaze she huddled with a corner of the robe drawn to shield\r\nher white limbs. He stood before her.\r\n\r\n\"Gone, Leela. Dead, by now. . . . Don't shudder, little white woman. It\r\nis the law of life--some live, some die. . . . But Degg will be sorry.\"\r\n\r\nShe had no words, no heart with which to answer.\r\n\r\nHe went on, with a frown crossing his face. \"That vegetable thing\r\ncoming here has changed my plans. It has no right to be unrooted.\r\nI grew it, Lady Leela--and many others of its kind--for a certain\r\npurpose. But now it has broken away, before I was quite ready to dig it\r\nup. It thinks it is full-grown. It is conscious of its power. And that\r\nwhich during all its growth I have taught it to do----\" He shrugged.\r\n\"I suppose they have all broken loose. All roaming----\" A horrible\r\ngrimness came to Rokk's voice. \"Well, they will do what I taught\r\nthem--we shall have to hurry if we wish to see it, Lady Leela.\"\r\n\r\nLeela summoned words. \"To see--what?\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled. \"You are impatient--and as becomes only a woman--curious!\r\nYou shall see, little white woman--blood-red things----\" He gestured.\r\n\"Enough of that. But you shall realize how great is Rokk. I planned it\r\nall. But now I shall have to change my plans a little. I had wanted\r\nto show you and your friend--the little Frannie--to the men of this\r\nworld. So that they--our men--would know how beautiful women can be.\r\nThere is no time now, with the red things broken loose. We shall have\r\nto be careful, my Leela. I shall send word to all the men everywhere\r\nto have a care. . . . I wish Degg would come--but we can not wait for\r\nhim now. . . . There are animals, too, who should be guarded from these\r\nroaming red vines I have grown. You have not seen our animals, Leela?\r\nDegg has one--a very friendly thing; we call it Eeff. It is but half\r\nhuman--and only half materialized into substance. A loyal friend, if it\r\nlikes you. But its mentality is that of an imbecile. . . . I talk too\r\nmuch, like a loose-tongued woman. There is no time--we must start.\"\r\n\r\nHe called roughly, \"Mobah! Come here at once!\"\r\n\r\nThe woman appeared, sullen, defiant. On the flesh of her heavy gray\r\nshoulder was a red bruise where Rokk had struck her.\r\n\r\n\"Mobah! Bring the dhranes. We are leaving for the Ice City. Tell my boy\r\nhere to have Degg follow us when he comes. . . . Hurry! . . .\"\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\nThey rode fast. Alternate night and day--endless frozen wastes.\r\nOccasionally they passed single mounds, isolated like that of Rokk.\r\nOthers in groups; blood-stained graveyards by day--eery and gruesome\r\nin the starlight. Leela saw many of the green-white animals, lurking\r\nlike werewolves prowling among the mounds. And there were men gazing\r\ncuriously at the travelers. To them often Rokk gave a warning that the\r\nvegetable things were loose.\r\n\r\nBut he said to Leela, \"There really is no danger. These things I have\r\ngrown will do my purpose in the Ice City. Then I will command them back\r\nto their fields. Let them rot there harmlessly in a red welter. I can\r\ncontrol them. They know me for their creator--their master.\"\r\n\r\nThere were few women or girls to be seen about the mounds. Rokk said,\r\nwith a horrible irony, \"We have sent most of them to the Ice City.\r\nIt is a very beautiful place--we men have sent our women there. The\r\nwomen----\" He laughed sarcastically. \"They are very stupid. They do\r\nnot guess our purpose.\"\r\n\r\nThey rode in silence. Then Rokk spoke again. \"My woman, Mobah\"--he\r\nglanced behind at the patient figure riding behind them--\"I have kept\r\nMobah with me. She is good to work in the mound. But you, my Lady\r\nLeela----\" He chuckled. \"We shall get rid of Mobah all in good time. We\r\ndo not want her around, do we? But I will not make you work, Leela. In\r\nyour city of Crescent, little white woman, you and I will be very great\r\npeople. I shall be the leader of all our men----\"\r\n\r\nAgain Leela did not answer.\r\n\r\nA red day plunged into night. Far to the left across the snowy wastes\r\nto the distant horizon, Leela saw a white radiance in the sky. A vague\r\npatch of silver, as of light reflected from some remote distance below\r\nthe horizon. Rokk waved his hand.\r\n\r\n\"You see that, Leela? That is where I found the drugs. This globe is\r\nvery fair, off there. Longer days and nights. A warm, fruitful summer.\r\nFood is there. Trees, with fruit. But it is all owned by another race\r\nof people. They will not let us in. They are very powerful--very far\r\nadvanced in civilization. A wonderful age of science. . . . They know\r\neverything. I crept into one of their cities and stole the drugs.\"\r\n\r\nTo Leela then was driven home the conception of how vast is God's\r\ngreat plan of the Universe. This miserable region owned by Rokk's\r\npeople was no more than the Polar waste of this globe. A fairer land of\r\nscience lay there where the distant radiance showed. A great, cultured\r\ncivilization perhaps. And farther beyond it--other races--all on this\r\none tiny globe whirling among these stars. . . .\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey came at last within sight of the City of Ice. In the starlight\r\nit glittered with a pale sheen. It stood on a broad plateau above the\r\nsurrounding valleys--a place of white spires, glittering under the\r\nstars, the whole surrounded by a high white wall of ice.\r\n\r\nAnd as they came closer, Leela saw within the city a yellow-red glare.\r\nBehind it, a high tower of stone dominated the scene; the glare painted\r\nthe tower a yellow-red upon one side. \"The pit of fire,\" said Rokk.\r\n\"The one place in all our realm where the fires underground come near\r\nthe surface. It brings a warmth--a beauty. You shall see.\" He laughed\r\nhis horrible laugh. \"That is why we tell the women they should like it\r\nhere----\"\r\n\r\nThey approached the wall. Rokk gazed around. \"We are but just in time.\"\r\nIn the farther distance beyond the city was a red sheen against the\r\nground. Rokk understood it, though at the moment Leela did not. \"Just\r\nin time, little woman. I had thought we might better enter by the\r\ntunnel under the wall. But that is not necessary.\"\r\n\r\nThey rode through a gate, plunged at once into a passageway, and\r\nemerged presently within the stone tower, left the dhranes there, and\r\nmounted the tower. At its top, Rokk stood with Leela. Mobah sullenly\r\nwas behind them. Rokk glanced back at her. He said softly, \"I think\r\nperhaps she guesses what is to happen. But she can do nothing about it.\"\r\n\r\nPresently Mobah moved away and disappeared. Rokk patted his belt.\r\n\"I have all the drugs here, Leela. All there are in this whole\r\nrealm--except a very little of each which I left with Degg. We must\r\nguard them carefully.\"\r\n\r\nTo Leela came the thought that she might gain possession of the drugs\r\nand thus escape. But Rokk was very watchful.\r\n\r\nThey stood upon a broad balcony, with the single tower room behind them\r\nand a breast-high parapet in front. At the parapet, Leela gazed down.\r\nFrom this height the city lay spread beneath them. It was still night.\r\nA simple, placid scene, quiet, and in a measure beautiful. A few broad\r\nstreets of packed, gray-black snow. Flat, oblong houses of ice blocks\r\nwhich were white and glittering, with spires and minarets occasionally\r\nadorning them.\r\n\r\nDirectly beneath Leela, at the foot of the tower, was a yawning\r\nyellow-red pit. She could see directly down into it; a glare, some\r\ngreat distance down to where the fires of the earth were broken out.\r\nRising wisps of smoke . . . a sulfurous, fiery breath . . . and a\r\ntorrent of grateful heat surging upward.\r\n\r\nAround the pit, the city was built of stone for a distance, like\r\na broad, square park. Trees were growing there; huge, graceful\r\nferns; blue-green leaves like great flopping ears of an animal. And\r\ngiant palms, hung with purple fruit. . . . A tropical garden, with\r\nflower-lined, winding paths. . . . By contrast with all this bleak\r\nregion Leela had seen, the single little park was very beautiful.\r\n\r\nThere were a few women moving about the city--dull, heavy-looking,\r\nshapeless women robed in a monotone of drab garments. Uninspired of\r\naspect. Yet each had a soul . . . desires . . . longings. . . .\r\n\r\nIn the park a woman sat and played with a little girl. There was\r\nanother woman, newly arrived here, with a baby at her breast. . . .\r\n\r\nRokk's voice broke upon Leela's thoughts with a rasp. \"But who is to\r\nfeed them? It gets very tiresome, giving them food. . . . Ah! Now you\r\nshall see my solution, Lady Leela----\"\r\n\r\nBeyond the city walls, out over the starlit, snowy wastes, spots of red\r\nsheen were visible. Moving. Coming nearer. Spots of red sheen resolving\r\ninto long, thin lines of red. Undulating, twisting, slithering forward.\r\nGreen spots of eyes, waving, peering.\r\n\r\nRed, growing things unrooted. Coming monstrously to do that for which\r\nduring all their growth they had been trained. There seemed thousands\r\nof them. Over every distant slope they came closing in upon the city.\r\nThick red vines a hundred feet long. Others grown into a tangled\r\nclump, every separate tendril of which was in slimy movement. A red\r\nboll, like the bulging trunk of a tree. It rolled, leaped. Another of\r\na flat, round central growth, with prickling spines like huge needles\r\nstanding erect, and waving, groping tentacles. It hitched itself along,\r\nawkwardly.\r\n\r\nThey came from everywhere. Red, gleaming monsters of the ground,\r\nadvancing with a grim, uncanny silence, closing in upon the city.\r\n\r\nLeela watched, with the blood freezing in her veins. Within the city no\r\nalarm had sounded. The woman in the park played with her little girl.\r\nBut the baby at the other woman's breast was crying. . . .\r\n\r\nThe first of the red things reached the city wall. Slithered up like\r\nsome monstrous red ivy growing there. A thing of dangling green pods\r\nfrom which a slimy juice was dripping. A segment of it raised high over\r\nthe wall, with green eyes staring down.\r\n\r\nIn a near-by street a headless, friendly animal gave out its imbecilic\r\ncry. The two women in the park looked and saw, and screamed. . . .\r\n\r\nThe red thing rose and slithered over the wall. Stretched its length\r\ndown a street; then encircled a house, its wide-flung segments\r\nslithering into every door and window. Screams from in there sounded\r\nover the silent, starlit city. Shrill, throat-tearing screams of\r\nwomen . . . and the piping, terrified cries of children. . . .\r\n\r\nThe alarm spread. The cries were caught up, echoed from everywhere\r\nabout the city. Women and girl children were rushing in a panic from\r\nthe houses. . . .\r\n\r\nOver the wall at its every point, the red things were climbing . . .\r\nspreading over the city . . . filling the streets . . . climbing with\r\na red, leafy growth into houses . . . green peering eyes, searching\r\neverywhere. . . .\r\n\r\nOne of the flat, round growths with prickling spines--needles each\r\nas long as a human body--lurched itself into the park. With a sudden\r\nspring it caught a running woman. Its tentacles tossed her aloft. She\r\nfell, impaled upon its swordlike spines. Its tentacles pulled an arm\r\nfrom her body . . . tossed the arm away. . . . The woman was still\r\nscreaming--horribly. . . .\r\n\r\nLeela, sickened, covered her face with her hands. She heard Rokk's\r\ngloating voice, \"You see--my solution? Look, little white woman! Make\r\nyour heart stout, like Rokk's. This is the law of life. Some live, some\r\ndie. We--you and I--will live, for love, when this blood-red day is\r\nover.\"\r\n\r\nDay! The dawn had come. The red sun rose from the horizon in its low\r\narc. Red, staining everything.\r\n\r\nLeela, with a fascination, again involuntarily stared. The city was a\r\nchaos of terror. From windows, with reason fled, women were leaping.\r\nThe red things caught them as they fell. . . . On a flat housetop a\r\nwoman crouched with a baby in her arms, and a little girl huddling at\r\nher knees. A slim red arm came up over the parapet of roof. Other red\r\nthings came up, and poised with watching green eyes. The woman fought\r\nthe red arm with all her meager strength. It seized the baby, waved the\r\nsmall, gray-white body aloft, dashed it to a red pulp against the stone\r\nof the parapet. Other arms jerked the little girl away. A flat, red\r\nthing engulfed the woman and sat mouthing and tearing. . . .\r\n\r\nIn the park a crowd of the women were huddled. Some were trying to\r\nclimb the high railing at the pit of fire, but could not. The red\r\nthings slithered among them. . . .\r\n\r\nThe blood-red day! A white, glittering city, stained crimson now.\r\nSplashed and stained; and upon it the red sun poured a polluting, gory\r\nlight. . . .\r\n\r\nThe blood-red day. . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _CHAPTER 7_\r\n\r\n                       THE FIGHT ON THE PARAPET\r\n\r\n\r\nMartt stood in the starlight at the top of the slope, frozen into\r\nimmobility with horror. Frannie was struggling in the grip of the red\r\nvine, being dragged along, with others of its kind leading the way.\r\nGrown and taught for nothing but the blood-red day of the Ice City,\r\nthese things with single purpose were dragging Frannie there.\r\n\r\nMartt stood stricken for an instant. The red thing paused. All\r\nits green eyes turned. Beyond it the other things came to a stop,\r\nirresolute, and then slithered on. But the one with Frannie lay\r\nmomentarily quiescent; only its eyes were quivering.\r\n\r\nMartt became aware that Zee and Degg were beside him. Eeff was\r\ncrouching at its master's feet, whimpering with terror. Martt shouted,\r\n\"Zee, run back! Come on, Degg!\"\r\n\r\nHe caught a glimpse of Degg's face, gray with fright. But his eyes\r\nshowed a sudden determination. And Degg leaped, with Martt after him.\r\n\r\nThe red thing flung up its forward tentacles, and shoved Frannie\r\nfarther back within its folds. Degg leaped for the clump of its\r\nbranches where Frannie was entangled.\r\n\r\nMartt, running forward, abruptly stopped. One of the drug cylinders\r\nwithin his pockets had bumped his thigh. A thought swept him--the\r\ndrug for smallness! He stopped; recklessly poured from the cylinder\r\nnearly half its contents. And stood, with a huge buckle of his jacket,\r\ncrushing the white tablets into a powder in his hand.\r\n\r\nDegg had fought his way to Frannie. He had torn her loose, thrust her\r\nviolently away, but was himself entrapped. He fought, ripping, tearing\r\nat the red branches, struggling to avoid the sinuous tentacles which\r\ncurled back at him. A thick tendril of the vine had wound itself about\r\nhis legs. . . .\r\n\r\nWith the powder in his left hand, Martt rushed forward. There was a\r\npart of the red thing which seemed of lesser size and strength. Martt\r\nrushed in among its lashing brambles. They entwined him. He ducked the\r\nsweep of a tentacle thick as his body. Eyes on the branches peered\r\ninto his face. He seized one, pulled it off. A slime with a red\r\nphosphorescence was on his fingers. A pod struck his face; he tore it\r\nopen and scattered its seeds. A red, noisome juice spattered him. . . .\r\n\r\nMartt was fighting only with his right hand. One of his legs was\r\ngripped and held; he kicked, striving to free it.\r\n\r\nThese smaller branches were easily broken. They mashed, some of them\r\nlike a porous, tropical plant, oozing sap. They were spongy. Martt\r\nscattered a little of the white powder; sifted it through his fingers.\r\nThe vegetable growth sucked it up--the drug mingled with the sap of its\r\nbruises.\r\n\r\nThe branches were dwindling. Upon vegetable the drug acted more\r\nswiftly than upon animal cells. The smaller tendrils shriveled. Then\r\nbranches of greater thickness. Martt could feel them letting go their\r\nhold--shrinking, loosening their grip.\r\n\r\nAround him in a moment was a shriveled, shrunken bramble. He kicked\r\nhimself free. A huge tentacle from another portion licked back and\r\nseized him; whirled him aloft. But he kept his wits. Tore at it with\r\nhis fingers; rubbed the drug into its bruised bark. Along all its\r\nlength, the drug acted. Martt's weight brought its shriveled strength\r\nto the ground. He fell upon his feet; tore himself loose again. Stamped\r\nand tore, and leaped away.\r\n\r\nThroughout all the length of the monstrous vine, now, the drug was\r\nacting. Martt momentarily stood inactive, panting. He saw that Degg had\r\nfreed Frannie--saw her and Zee huddled at a distance on the slope near\r\nby. Degg was still fighting; one of his legs seemed queerly twisted; an\r\narm of the red vine held him, but he kept his feet. Eeff was darting\r\nforward and back, too much terrified to approach, yet anxious to help.\r\n\r\nThe vine everywhere was shrinking. Martt ran to free Degg. But he was\r\ntoo late. The largest remaining tentacle lashed forward; it caught\r\nDegg, whirled him up in the air and flung him heavily to the ground.\r\nDegg lay still.\r\n\r\nA moment. Then the vine was so shriveled that Martt waded throughout\r\nits lashing length. Tore it apart. Scattered it. Stamped upon its\r\ntwisting, slithering red segments.\r\n\r\nAll dwindling. Separate, dismembered segments quivering around\r\nhim . . . smaller . . . red, twisting lines, with tiny green\r\neyes. . . . They winked and vanished into smallness. . . .\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\n\"Is he dead? Oh, Martt, do you think he is dead?\"\r\n\r\nThey bent over Degg and he opened his eyes. Martt knelt and lifted\r\nhis head. It was evident that he was dying; and evident, too, that he\r\nknew it. He spoke, laboriously whispered words in Zee's language. He\r\ntried to gesture toward Zee; on his face was an earnestness, almost a\r\ndesperation lest he might fail to give his dying message.\r\n\r\nMartt said, \"Zee, he's trying to talk to you. Bend closer--he's\r\ntalking.\"\r\n\r\nZee knelt at his head. He was panting, struggling breathlessly with\r\neach word. \"Rokk--was going to take your sister Leela to the--City of\r\nIce. Now that the red things are loose--I think you will find--him and\r\nher--there.\"\r\n\r\nHis breath ended with a long sigh. But he began again. \"Eeff will lead\r\nyou. Tell Eeff--to take you through the--tunnel into the--stone tower.\r\nAnd--hurry!\"\r\n\r\nHis eyes closed. Then they opened very wide. They tried to focus on\r\nZee's face. She bent lower to hear his faint whisper. \"Hurry! You\r\nunderstand--about Leela, there with Rokk. He means, for her, a thing\r\nvery terrible. You must--hurry.\" He added, with a breath so faint she\r\nbarely heard his words, \"You are--so very beautiful, little Zee. I\r\nnever saw--any woman so beautiful. But I am not Rokk--I could not have\r\nharmed you.\"\r\n\r\nHe stiffened just a trifle; then went limp, his head with staring eyes\r\ndangling backward over Martt's arm.\r\n\r\nMartt laid him gently on the ground. Eeff went and sat by him, crying\r\nsoftly.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  III\r\n\r\nIt was red day when they approached the City of Ice. Eeff had led them,\r\nas Degg suggested. They saw the city from far off, with a red glow\r\nstaining its white glitter. Then Eeff plunged them into a black tunnel.\r\nIt seemed miles. Then it ascended, and they emerged into a wave of\r\nheat, with a yellow-red glare beside them.\r\n\r\nThey were at the bottom of a tall stone tower; a doorway was near at\r\nhand. Martt gazed up the tower's side. A man was up there, behind a\r\nparapet, gazing out at the city: a man's head and shoulders, queerly\r\nforeshortened. But Martt recognized him.\r\n\r\nRokk!\r\n\r\nMartt pushed Zee and Frannie hastily into the tower. He commanded, \"You\r\ntwo stay here, with Eeff. I'm going up. You stay here.\"\r\n\r\nAgain Martt thought of the drug cylinders he was carrying. He drew them\r\nfrom his pockets, handed them swiftly to Zee. \"Keep these. Whatever\r\nhappens--if I don't come back--use them. Eeff will lead you home. To\r\nReaf. Ask it if it can lead you.\"\r\n\r\nZee said, in her own language, \"Eeff, come here. Can you lead me\r\nback--down there where we met Degg in that place called Reaf? You\r\nremember? Where the water was?\"\r\n\r\nThe headless thing turned its eye upon her. It chattered, \"Yes, I\r\nremember. I can go there--but I want Degg. I want to go back to Degg.\"\r\n\r\nMartt, alone, mounted the circular incline softly, and as swiftly\r\nas he dared. Had Rokk seen him? He did not think so. Was Leela up\r\nthere? . . . If he could get behind Rokk unobserved. . . .\r\n\r\nHalf-way up there was an oval window in the tower through which Martt\r\ncaught his first view of the interior of the city.\r\n\r\nThe sun was sinking at the horizon. The end of the blood-red day! A\r\nsilence had fallen with the falling sun. A crimson city, strewn with\r\nwhat had once been living, human flesh and blood--dismembered now . . .\r\nstrewn . . . unnamable. . . .\r\n\r\nAnd climbing the walls, red monsters slithering away--seeking other\r\nhorrors.\r\n\r\nThe silent nightfall of the blood-red day.\r\n\r\nMartt's gorge rose. He turned from the window, and mounted the incline.\r\n\r\nThe room at the top was circular, with many windows. An empty room of\r\nstone, almost dark, with the starlight streaming in dimly to illumine\r\nit.\r\n\r\nMartt crept softly. Through a doorway he could see Rokk's figure on the\r\nbalcony outside. And another figure. Leela, white of face, with her\r\nblack hair streaming, and her tattered, dirt-stained veiling falling\r\nabout her. Leela! She was standing, half turned, shuddering with\r\nhorror. She saw Martt! Surprize, wonderment, joy mirrored her face.\r\nHis fingers went to his lips warningly. But not quite in time. She\r\nuttered a low cry, instantly checked.\r\n\r\nRokk swing about. He, too, saw Martt; he stiffened, with his shoulders\r\nflung back against the parapet and his jaw dropping. Martt had\r\ninstantly leaped, but Rokk met him squarely, surged forward, and they\r\nfell.\r\n\r\nRokk was the stronger; Martt knew it at once. He rolled, desperately\r\nstruggling to come on top, with his legs braced against the floor. But\r\nRokk flung him off and regained his feet.\r\n\r\nInstantly Martt was up, quicker, lighter than his antagonist. He struck\r\nfor Rokk's face, missed and then caught Rokk full on the chest with\r\nhis fist. The man staggered, but he was not hurt. Rokk's swing went\r\nwide, as Martt nimbly ducked. Again they came together. Surged across\r\nthe balcony, kicking, tearing, seeking each other's throats. Locked,\r\nwith legs entwined they struck the parapet, rebounded, fell and rolled\r\ntogether to the opposite wall. A primitive struggle of men using only\r\nthe weapons with which nature had endowed them. Fighting grimly, almost\r\nsilently, each with no thought but to kill.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: \"He had no other thought but to kill.\"]\r\n\r\nLeela, near by, stood helpless, confused, a hand pressed against her\r\nmouth in terror. There was a sound, a startled outcry. Frannie and Zee\r\nwere in the tower room, with Eeff cowering behind them.\r\n\r\nMartt momentarily was on top of his adversary, with Rokk's hairy hand\r\nbeneath his chin, pressing his head back. Martt ripped the hand away.\r\nHe called, \"Run! Run--all of you!\"\r\n\r\nRokk heaved him backward, half rose, and surged over on top. Martt\r\nsaw vaguely another figure appear on the balcony. A heavy, gray-faced\r\nwoman. He heard Rokk pant, \"Mobah!\"\r\n\r\nThe woman leaped upon the scene. She avoided Zee and Frannie. She\r\nstrove to get at Martt. She kicked; she tried to strike at him. He\r\nheard Zee's voice, \"Frannie! Leela! Help me!\" As he fought, he was\r\naware that the three girls were pulling at the woman--pulling her away,\r\nholding her.\r\n\r\nMartt momentarily had slackened his efforts. Rokk's fist caught him in\r\nthe face, dazed him. Martt felt Rokk lifting him up, heaving him. His\r\nbody struck the three-foot-wide, level top of the parapet. He clung\r\ndesperately, as Rokk leaped up to throw him off.\r\n\r\nThey were locked together, rolling on the parapet top! Martt at its\r\nedge, his head momentarily over, felt a wave of heat--saw, far down,\r\nthe red-yellow glare. Rokk suddenly tried to cast him loose. Then was\r\npushing. They were both lying at the edge.\r\n\r\nScrambling. Panting. And suddenly Zee was up on the parapet,\r\ncrouching--her frail white hands gouging at Rokk's face. It confused\r\nhim. He relaxed. Martt gave one last desperate surge. He saw, and felt\r\nRokk's body slipping, sliding over the edge, feet first. Rokk's hold on\r\nMartt was torn away, by his own weight and by Zee's frenzied, plucking\r\nfingers. His face, close to Martt's for an instant, showed wide,\r\nterrified eyes; a mouth that gaped.\r\n\r\nHis hold broke. His body slid. He was gone! Martt lay panting at the\r\nedge, with Zee's steadying grip upon him. A cry sounded. A wail. The\r\nwoman Mobah had torn loose from Frannie and Leela. She leaped to the\r\nparapet. Poised for an instant--a grim, gray statue of despair. Bereft\r\nof reason, she called, \"Rokk! Rokk!\" And with a long, shuddering cry,\r\nshe plunged.\r\n\r\nThere was silence for a moment on the parapet. No one looked down. And\r\nfrom over the distant, desolate horizon, presently the red sun came up\r\nwith the dawn of a new day.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              _CHAPTER 8_\r\n\r\n                                YOUTH!\r\n\r\n\r\nLife is very strange. Brett and I--Frank Elgon of the Interplanetary\r\nMails--of full maturity, at the peak of our physical and mental\r\nstrength--how inglorious were the parts we played! So inconsequential I\r\nscarcely have the heart to recount our futile actions. Yet we thought\r\nalways that we were doing our best.\r\n\r\nWe stood there beside the arcade, helplessly watching Frannie and Leela\r\ndisappear into smallness. Brett left me to guard the spot. He rushed\r\naway; came back to tell me that the giant wading in the lake was gone,\r\nthat he could not find Martt or Zee.\r\n\r\nFor a time we watched the small pebble beneath which Leela and Frannie\r\nhad vanished. We even dared to move it carefully, but we could not see\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nThe island was emptying of its people. We thought that Martt and Zee\r\nmight have gone home. We decided to go and join them. Perhaps to take\r\nour vehicle, make it small to search for Leela, since we had no drugs.\r\n\r\nI told Brett of his father's death. And it was well advanced into the\r\nmorning before we learned that people on the island had seen Martt and\r\nZee sailing for Reaf. Hours during which we had aimlessly searched, and\r\nprepared the vehicle for its trip into smallness to try and find Leela\r\nand Frannie.\r\n\r\nMartt and Zee had sailed for Reaf! Following the giant! We had thought\r\nof doing that, to try and obtain the drugs. But it had seemed reckless,\r\nfoolhardy, impossible of success. Yet Martt had done it without\r\nhesitation. There is a caution comes at thirty which does not hamper\r\ntwenty-one.\r\n\r\nWe procured a boat. Provisioned it. And sailed for Reaf, armed with our\r\nflash-cylinders. And there we found a huge belt lying on the rocks\r\nnear a scattered wreck of buildings strewn upon the water.\r\n\r\nMartt's belt, of a size which showed us he had used the drug! He had\r\nleft the belt to explain that he had gone on to the giant world.\r\n\r\nBut we were utterly helpless! We could not follow him. We were starting\r\naimlessly toward the river, when along the rocks there, we saw four\r\nmoving figures. Normal in size. Martt, returning with the three girls!\r\nAll of them tattered, bruised, blood-stained, their garments dirty and\r\ntorn. But unharmed.\r\n\r\nThey waved at us. We landed and ran along the rocks. Martt's smile was\r\ntired, but very happy.\r\n\r\n\"Here they are, Brett. I brought them back--Zee and I did--here they\r\nare.\" He added, \"We had a headless thing named Eeff. It led us back,\r\nbut just now at the last, it ran away. It said it wanted to find Degg.\r\nIt ran, forgetting it needed the drugs. A half-witted, cowardly sort of\r\nthing, but I liked it. Oh, there is so much to tell you----\"\r\n\r\nDeeds of youth! No caution, no pondering! Glorious deeds of youth,\r\nunfettered by maturity! No theory--just accomplishment!\r\n\r\nFrannie was saying to me, \"Oh Frank----\" I held out my hand, but she\r\nflung herself upon me. \"Frank, I--I've wanted so to get back to you!\"\r\n\r\nShe clung to me. Her arms went around my neck. She was kissing me! Me,\r\nFrank Elgon! Poor as a guider of the lower traffic, and just now proved\r\nso inglorious of action. But Frannie was kissing me! And whispering,\r\n\"Oh, Frank, I love you! Don't you know it? Haven't you always known it?\r\nYou'd never say it to me. Please--please say it now!\"\r\n\r\nI murmured, \"I love you, Frannie!\" And held her close. That this could\r\nhappen to me, ineffectual Frank Elgon!\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  II\r\n\r\nOur last evening in Crescent. We were all going to the Earth--all\r\nbut old Greedo. Brett and Leela had decided to be married on Earth.\r\nFrannie and I also, for Frannie did not seem to care how poor I was.\r\nGreedo wanted to go; but he said he was too old. A visit to Earth for\r\nhis daughters, and then he hoped we would come back. Our last evening.\r\nI chanced to go alone to the roof-top of Greedo's home. Its banks of\r\nflowers were vivid in the twilight. A breeze rustled the tall potted\r\nferns. The stars overhead were glowing with a silver radiance, mirrored\r\nin the distant, placid waters of the lake. Within the house downstairs,\r\nLeela's softly singing voice floated up.\r\n\r\nTwo figures sat in the starlight, among the flowers. Zee and Martt;\r\nclose together, with his arm around her, and her head against his side,\r\nthe tangle of her dark hair enveloping him.\r\n\r\nI heard him say, awkwardly but very tenderly, \"Three couples can be\r\nmarried at once, on Earth, Zee. Let's do that. Shall we?\"\r\n\r\nAnd heard her answering whisper, \"Yes. Let's.\"\r\n\r\nI tiptoed silently away.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                THE END",
