The two first\r\nof the series are printed without alteration, because, having gained me\r\nthe reputation of being an independent originator of the theory of\r\n\"natural selection,\" they may be considered to have some historical\r\nvalue. I have added to them one or two very short explanatory notes, and\r\nhave given headings to subjects, to make them uniform with the rest of\r\nthe book. The other essays have been carefully corrected, often\r\nconsiderably enlarged, and in some cases almost rewritten, so as to\r\nexpress more fully and more clearly the views which I hold at the\r\npresent time; and as most of them originally appeared in publications\r\nwhich have a very limited circulation, I believe that the larger portion\r\nof this volume will be new to many of my friends and to most of my\r\nreaders.\r\n\r\nI now wish to say a few words on the reasons which have led me to\r\npublish this work. The second essay, especially when taken in connection\r\nwith the first, contains an outline sketch of the theory of the\r\norigin of species (by means of what was afterwards termed by Mr.\r\nDarwin--\"natural selection,\") as conceived by me before I had the least\r\nnotion of the scope and nature of Mr. Darwin's labours. They were\r\npublished in a way not likely to attract the attention of any but\r\nworking naturalists, and I feel sure that many who have heard of them,\r\nhave never had the opportunity of ascertaining how much or how little\r\nthey really contain. It therefore happens, that, while some writers give\r\nme more credit than I deserve, others may very naturally class me with\r\nDr. Wells and Mr. Patrick Matthew, who, as Mr. Darwin has shown in the\r\nhistorical sketch given in the 4th and 5th Editions of the \"Origin of\r\nSpecies,\" certainly propounded the fundamental principle of \"natural\r\nselection\" before himself, but who made no further use of that\r\nprinciple, and failed to see its wide and immensely important\r\napplications.\r\n\r\nThe present work will, I venture to think, prove, that I both saw at the\r\ntime the value and scope of the law which I had discovered, and have\r\nsince been able to apply it to some purpose in a few original lines of\r\ninvestigation. But here my claims cease. I have felt all my life, and I\r\nstill feel, the most sincere satisfaction that Mr. Darwin had been at\r\nwork long before me, and that it was not left for me to attempt to write\r\n\"The Origin of Species.\" I have long since measured my own strength, and\r\nknow well that it would be quite unequal to that task. Far abler men\r\nthan myself may confess, that they have not that untiring patience in\r\naccumulating, and that wonderful skill in using, large masses of facts\r\nof the most varied kind,--that wide and accurate physiological\r\nknowledge,--that acuteness in devising and skill in carrying out\r\nexperiments,--and that admirable style of composition, at once clear,\r\npersuasive and judicial,--qualities, which in their harmonious\r\ncombination mark out Mr. Darwin as the man, perhaps of all men now\r\nliving, best fitted for the great work he has undertaken and\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\nMy own more limited powers have, it is true, enabled me now and then to\r\nseize on some conspicuous group of unappropriated facts, and to search\r\nout some generalization which might bring them under the reign of known\r\nlaw; but they are not suited to that more scientific and more laborious\r\nprocess of elaborate induction, which in Mr. Darwin's hands has led to\r\nsuch brilliant results.\r\n\r\nAnother reason which has led me to publish this volume at the present\r\ntime is, that there are some important points on which I differ from Mr.\r\nDarwin, and I wish to put my opinions on record in an easily accessible\r\nform, before the publication of his new work, (already announced,) in\r\nwhich I believe most of these disputed questions will be fully\r\ndiscussed.\r\n\r\nI will now give the date and mode of publication of each of the essays\r\nin this volume, as well as the amount of alteration they have undergone.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--ON THE LAW WHICH HAS REGULATED THE INTRODUCTION OF NEW SPECIES.\r\n\r\nFirst published in the \"Annals and Magazine of Natural History,\"\r\nSeptember, 1855. Reprinted without alteration of the text.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--ON THE TENDENCY OF VARIETIES TO DEPART INDEFINITELY FROM THE\r\nORIGINAL TYPE.\r\n\r\nFirst published in the \"Journal of the Proceedings of the Linnæan\r\nSociety,\" August, 1858. Reprinted without alteration of the text, except\r\none or two grammatical emendations.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--MIMICRY AND OTHER PROTECTIVE RESEMBLANCES AMONG ANIMALS.\r\n\r\nFirst published in the \"Westminster Review,\" July, 1867. Reprinted with\r\na few corrections and some important additions, among which I may\r\nespecially mention Mr. Jenner Weir's observations and experiments on the\r\ncolours of the caterpillars eaten or rejected by birds.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--THE MALAYAN PAPILIONIDÆ, OR SWALLOW-TAILED BUTTERFLIES, AS\r\nILLUSTRATIVE OF THE THEORY OF NATURAL SELECTION.\r\n\r\nFirst published in the \"Transactions of the Linnæan Society,\" Vol. XXV.\r\n(read March, 1864), under the title, \"On the Phenomena of Variation and\r\nGeographical Distribution, as illustrated by the Papilionidæ of the\r\nMalayan Region.\"\r\n\r\nThe introductory part of this essay is now reprinted, omitting tables,\r\nreferences to plates, &c., with some additions, and several corrections.\r\nOwing to the publication of Dr. Felder's \"Voyage of the Novara\"\r\n(Lepidoptera) in the interval between the reading of my paper and its\r\npublication, several of my new species must have their names changed for\r\nthose given to them by Dr. Felder, and this will explain the want of\r\nagreement in some cases between the names used in this volume and those\r\nof the original paper.\r\n\r\n\r\nV.--ON INSTINCT IN MAN AND ANIMALS.\r\n\r\nNot previously published.\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.--THE PHILOSOPHY OF BIRDS' NESTS.\r\n\r\nFirst published in the \"Intellectual Observer,\" July, 1867. Reprinted\r\nwith considerable emendations and additions.\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.--A THEORY OF BIRDS' NESTS; SHOWING THE RELATION OF CERTAIN\r\nDIFFERENCES OF COLOUR IN BIRDS TO THEIR MODE OF NIDIFICATION.\r\n\r\nFirst published in the \"Journal of Travel and Natural History\" (No. 2),\r\n1868. Now reprinted with considerable emendations and additions, by\r\nwhich I have endeavoured more clearly to express, and more fully to\r\nillustrate, my meaning in those parts which have been misunderstood by\r\nmy critics.\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.--CREATION BY LAW.\r\n\r\nFirst published in the \"Quarterly Journal of Science,\" October, 1867.\r\nNow reprinted with a few alterations and additions.\r\n\r\n\r\nIX.--THE DEVELOPMENT OF HUMAN RACES UNDER THE LAW OF NATURAL SELECTION.\r\n\r\nFirst published in the \"Anthropological Review,\" May, 1864. Now\r\nreprinted with a few important alterations and additions. I had intended\r\nto have considerably extended this essay, but on attempting it I found\r\nthat I should probably weaken the effect without adding much to the\r\nargument. I have therefore preferred to leave it as it was first\r\nwritten, with the exception of a few ill-considered passages which never\r\nfully expressed my meaning. As it now stands, I believe it contains the\r\nenunciation of an important truth.\r\n\r\n\r\nX.--THE LIMITS OF NATURAL SELECTION AS APPLIED TO MAN.\r\n\r\nThis is the further development of a few sentences at the end of an\r\narticle on \"Geological Time and the Origin of Species,\" which appeared\r\nin the \"Quarterly Review,\" for April, 1869. I have here ventured to\r\ntouch on a class of problems which are usually considered to be beyond\r\nthe boundaries of science, but which, I believe, will one day be brought\r\nwithin her domain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor the convenience of those who are acquainted with any of my essays in\r\ntheir original form, I subjoin references to the more important\r\nadditions and alterations now made to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_ADDITIONS AND CORRECTIONS TO THE ESSAYS AS ORIGINALLY PUBLISHED_.\r\n\r\nEssays I. and II. are unaltered, but short notes are added at pp. 19,\r\n24, 29, and 40.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--_Mimicry, and other Protective Resemblances among Animals._\r\n\r\n PAGE\r\n\r\n   53  Additional illustration of protective colouring in the case of\r\n       the wood-dove and the robin.\r\n\r\n   63  On moths resembling bird's dung and mortar.\r\n\r\n   86  Correction of some names of African Papilios and a reference to\r\n       Mr. Trimen's observations.\r\n\r\n   89  Mr. Jenner Weir's observation on birds which refused to eat\r\n       _Spilosoma menthrasti_.\r\n\r\n  102  An additional case of snake mimicry in _Oxyrhopus trigeminus_.\r\n\r\n  107  Mr. Salvin's case of mimicry among hawks.\r\n\r\n  113  Name, _Diadema anomala_, added.\r\n\r\n  117 to 122.

Many of these facts\r\nare quite different from what would have been anticipated, and have\r\nhitherto been considered as highly curious, but quite inexplicable. None\r\nof the explanations attempted from the time of Linnæus are now\r\nconsidered at all satisfactory; none of them have given a cause\r\nsufficient to account for the facts known at the time, or comprehensive\r\nenough to include all the new facts which have since been, and are daily\r\nbeing added. Of late years, however, a great light has been thrown upon\r\nthe subject by geological investigations, which have shown that the\r\npresent state of the earth and of the organisms now inhabiting it, is\r\nbut the last stage of a long and uninterrupted series of changes which\r\nit has undergone, and consequently, that to endeavour to explain and\r\naccount for its present condition without any reference to those changes\r\n(as has frequently been done) must lead to very imperfect and erroneous\r\nconclusions.\r\n\r\nThe facts proved by geology are briefly these:--That during an immense,\r\nbut unknown period, the surface of the earth has undergone successive\r\nchanges; land has sunk beneath the ocean, while fresh land has risen up\r\nfrom it; mountain chains have been elevated; islands have been formed\r\ninto continents, and continents submerged till they have become islands;\r\nand these changes have taken place, not once merely, but perhaps\r\nhundreds, perhaps thousands of times:--That all these operations have\r\nbeen more or less continuous, but unequal in their progress, and during\r\nthe whole series the organic life of the earth has undergone a\r\ncorresponding alteration. This alteration also has been gradual, but\r\ncomplete; after a certain interval not a single species existing which\r\nhad lived at the commencement of the period. This complete renewal of\r\nthe forms of life also appears to have occurred several times:--That\r\nfrom the last of the geological epochs to the present or historical\r\nepoch, the change of organic life has been gradual: the first appearance\r\nof animals now existing can in many cases be traced, their numbers\r\ngradually increasing in the more recent formations, while other species\r\ncontinually die out and disappear, so that the present condition of the\r\norganic world is clearly derived by a natural process of gradual\r\nextinction and creation of species from that of the latest geological\r\nperiods. We may therefore safely infer a like gradation and natural\r\nsequence from one geological epoch to another.\r\n\r\nNow, taking this as a fair statement of the results of geological\r\ninquiry, we see that the present geographical distribution of life upon\r\nthe earth must be the result of all the previous changes, both of the\r\nsurface of the earth itself and of its inhabitants. Many causes, no\r\ndoubt, have operated of which we must ever remain in ignorance, and we\r\nmay, therefore, expect to find many details very difficult of\r\nexplanation, and in attempting to give one, must allow ourselves to call\r\ninto our service geological changes which it is highly probable may have\r\noccurred, though we have no direct evidence of their individual\r\noperation.\r\n\r\nThe great increase of our knowledge within the last twenty years, both\r\nof the present and past history of the organic world, has accumulated a\r\nbody of facts which should afford a sufficient foundation for a\r\ncomprehensive law embracing and explaining them all, and giving a\r\ndirection to new researches. It is about ten years since the idea of\r\nsuch a law suggested itself to the writer of this essay, and he has\r\nsince taken every opportunity of testing it by all the newly-ascertained\r\nfacts with which he has become acquainted, or has been able to observe\r\nhimself. These have all served to convince him of the correctness of his\r\nhypothesis. Fully to enter into such a subject would occupy much space,\r\nand it is only in consequence of some views having been lately\r\npromulgated, he believes, in a wrong direction, that he now ventures to\r\npresent his ideas to the public, with only such obvious illustrations of\r\nthe arguments and results as occur to him in a place far removed from\r\nall means of reference and exact information.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Law deduced from well-known Geographical and Geological Facts._\r\n\r\nThe following propositions in Organic Geography and Geology give the\r\nmain facts on which the hypothesis is founded.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeography.\r\n\r\n1. Large groups, such as classes and orders, are generally spread over\r\nthe whole earth, while smaller ones, such as families and genera, are\r\nfrequently confined to one portion, often to a very limited district.\r\n\r\n2. In widely distributed families the genera are often limited in range;\r\nin widely distributed genera, well marked groups of species are peculiar\r\nto each geographical district.\r\n\r\n3. When a group is confined to one district, and is rich in species, it\r\nis almost invariably the case that the most closely allied species are\r\nfound in the same locality or in closely adjoining localities, and that\r\ntherefore the natural sequence of the species by affinity is also\r\ngeographical.\r\n\r\n4. In countries of a similar climate, but separated by a wide sea or\r\nlofty mountains, the families, genera and species of the one are often\r\nrepresented by closely allied families, genera and species peculiar to\r\nthe other.\r\n\r\n\r\nGeology.\r\n\r\n5. The distribution of the organic world in time is very similar to its\r\npresent distribution in space.\r\n\r\n6. Most of the larger and some small groups extend through several\r\ngeological periods.\r\n\r\n7. In each period, however, there are peculiar groups, found nowhere\r\nelse, and extending through one or several formations.\r\n\r\n8. Species of one genus, or genera of one family occurring in the same\r\ngeological time are more closely allied than those separated in time.\r\n\r\n9. As generally in geography no species or genus occurs in two very\r\ndistant localities without being also found in intermediate places, so\r\nin geology the life of a species or genus has not been interrupted. In\r\nother words, no group or species has come into existence twice.\r\n\r\n10. The following law may be deduced from these facts:--_Every species\r\nhas come into existence coincident both in space and time with a\r\npre-existing closely allied species._\r\n\r\nThis law agrees with, explains and illustrates all the facts connected\r\nwith the following branches of the subject:--1st. The system of natural\r\naffinities. 2nd. The distribution of animals and plants in space. 3rd.\r\nThe same in time, including all the phænomena of representative groups,\r\nand those which Professor Forbes supposed to manifest polarity. 4th. The\r\nphænomena of rudimentary organs. We will briefly endeavour to show its\r\nbearing upon each of these.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Form of a true system of Classification determined by this Law._\r\n\r\nIf the law above enunciated be true, it follows that the natural series\r\nof affinities will also represent the order in which the several species\r\ncame into existence, each one having had for its immediate antitype a\r\nclosely allied species existing at the time of its origin. It is\r\nevidently possible that two or three distinct species may have had a\r\ncommon antitype, and that each of these may again have become the\r\nantitypes from which other closely allied species were created. The\r\neffect of this would be, that so long as each species has had but one\r\nnew species formed on its model, the line of affinities will be simple,\r\nand may be represented by placing the several species in direct\r\nsuccession in a straight line. But if two or more species have been\r\nindependently formed on the plan of a common antitype, then the series\r\nof affinities will be compound, and can only be represented by a forked\r\nor many branched line. Now, all attempts at a Natural classification and\r\narrangement of organic beings show, that both these plans have obtained\r\nin creation. Sometimes the series of affinities can be well represented\r\nfor a space by a direct progression from species to species or from\r\ngroup to group, but it is generally found impossible so to continue.\r\nThere constantly occur two or more modifications of an organ or\r\nmodifications of two distinct organs, leading us on to two distinct\r\nseries of species, which at length differ so much from each other as to\r\nform distinct genera or families. These are the parallel series or\r\nrepresentative groups of naturalists, and they often occur in different\r\ncountries, or are found fossil in different formations. They are said to\r\nhave an analogy to each other when they are so far removed from their\r\ncommon antitype as to differ in many important points of structure,\r\nwhile they still preserve a family resemblance. We thus see how\r\ndifficult it is to determine in every case whether a given relation is\r\nan analogy or an affinity, for it is evident that as we go back along\r\nthe parallel or divergent series, towards the common antitype, the\r\nanalogy which existed between the two groups becomes an affinity. We are\r\nalso made aware of the difficulty of arriving at a true classification,\r\neven in a small and perfect group;--in the actual state of nature it is\r\nalmost impossible, the species being so numerous and the modifications\r\nof form and structure so varied, arising probably from the immense\r\nnumber of species which have served as antitypes for the existing\r\nspecies, and thus produced a complicated branching of the lines of\r\naffinity, as intricate as the twigs of a gnarled oak or the vascular\r\nsystem of the human body. Again, if we consider that we have only\r\nfragments of this vast system, the stem and main branches being\r\nrepresented by extinct species of which we have no knowledge, while a\r\nvast mass of limbs and boughs and minute twigs and scattered leaves is\r\nwhat we have to place in order, and determine the true position each\r\noriginally occupied with regard to the others, the whole difficulty of\r\nthe true Natural System of classification becomes apparent to us.\r\n\r\nWe shall thus find ourselves obliged to reject all these systems of\r\nclassification which arrange species or groups in circles, as well as\r\nthese which fix a definite number for the divisions of each group. The\r\nlatter class have been very generally rejected by naturalists, as\r\ncontrary to nature, notwithstanding the ability with which they have\r\nbeen advocated; but the circular system of affinities seems to have\r\nobtained a deeper hold, many eminent naturalists having to some extent\r\nadopted it. We have, however, never been able to find a case in which\r\nthe circle has been closed by a direct and close affinity. In most cases\r\na palpable analogy has been substituted, in others the affinity is very\r\nobscure or altogether doubtful. The complicated branching of the lines\r\nof affinities in extensive groups must also afford great facilities for\r\ngiving a show of probability to any such purely artificial arrangements.\r\nTheir death-blow was given by the admirable paper of the lamented Mr.\r\nStrickland, published in the \"Annals of Natural History,\" in which he so\r\nclearly showed the true synthetical method of discovering the Natural\r\nSystem.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Geographical Distribution of Organisms._\r\n\r\nIf we now consider the geographical distribution of animals and plants\r\nupon the earth, we shall find all the facts beautifully in accordance\r\nwith, and readily explained by, the present hypothesis. A country having\r\nspecies, genera, and whole families peculiar to it, will be the\r\nnecessary result of its having been isolated for a long period,\r\nsufficient for many series of species to have been created on the type\r\nof pre-existing ones, which, as well as many of the earlier-formed\r\nspecies, have become extinct, and thus made the groups appear isolated.\r\nIf in any case the antitype had an extensive range, two or more groups\r\nof species might have been formed, each varying from it in a different\r\nmanner, and thus producing several representative or analogous groups.\r\nThe Sylviadæ of Europe and the Sylvicolidæ of North America, the\r\nHeliconidæ of South America and the Euploeas of the East, the group of\r\nTrogons inhabiting Asia, and that peculiar to South America, are\r\nexamples that may be accounted for in this manner.\r\n\r\nSuch phænomena as are exhibited by the Galapagos Islands, which contain\r\nlittle groups of plants and animals peculiar to themselves, but most\r\nnearly allied to those of South America, have not hitherto received any,\r\neven a conjectural explanation. The Galapagos are a volcanic group of\r\nhigh antiquity, and have probably never been more closely connected with\r\nthe continent than they are at present. They must have been first\r\npeopled, like other newly-formed islands, by the action of winds and\r\ncurrents, and at a period sufficiently remote to have had the original\r\nspecies die out, and the modified prototypes only remain. In the same\r\nway we can account for the separate islands having each their peculiar\r\nspecies, either on the supposition that the same original emigration\r\npeopled the whole of the islands with the same species from which\r\ndifferently modified prototypes were created, or that the islands were\r\nsuccessively peopled from each other, but that new species have been\r\ncreated in each on the plan of the pre-existing ones. St. Helena is a\r\nsimilar case of a very ancient island having obtained an entirely\r\npeculiar, though limited, flora. On the other hand, no example is known\r\nof an island which can be proved geologically to be of very recent\r\norigin (late in the Tertiary, for instance), and yet possesses generic\r\nor family groups, or even many species peculiar to itself.\r\n\r\nWhen a range of mountains has attained a great elevation, and has so\r\nremained during a long geological period, the species of the two sides\r\nat and near their bases will be often very different, representative\r\nspecies of some genera occurring, and even whole genera being peculiar\r\nto one side only, as is remarkably seen in the case of the Andes and\r\nRocky Mountains. A similar phænomenon occurs when an island has been\r\nseparated from a continent at a very early period. The shallow sea\r\nbetween the Peninsula of Malacca, Java, Sumatra and Borneo was probably\r\na continent or large island at an early epoch, and may have become\r\nsubmerged as the volcanic ranges of Java and Sumatra were elevated. The\r\norganic results we see in the very considerable number of species of\r\nanimals common to some or all of these countries, while at the same time\r\na number of closely allied representative species exist peculiar to\r\neach, showing that a considerable period has elapsed since their\r\nseparation. The facts of geographical distribution and of geology may\r\nthus mutually explain each other in doubtful cases, should the\r\nprinciples here advocated be clearly established.\r\n\r\nIn all those cases in which an island has been separated from a\r\ncontinent, or raised by volcanic or coralline action from the sea, or in\r\nwhich a mountain-chain has been elevated in a recent geological epoch,\r\nthe phænomena of peculiar groups or even of single representative\r\nspecies will not exist. Our own island is an example of this, its\r\nseparation from the continent being geologically very recent, and we\r\nhave consequently scarcely a species which is peculiar to it; while the\r\nAlpine range, one of the most recent mountain elevations, separates\r\nfaunas and floras which scarcely differ more than may be due to climate\r\nand latitude alone.\r\n\r\nThe series of facts alluded to in Proposition (3), of closely allied\r\nspecies in rich groups being found geographically near each other, is\r\nmost striking and important. Mr. Lovell Reeve has well exemplified it in\r\nhis able and interesting paper on the Distribution of the Bulimi. It is\r\nalso seen in the Humming-birds and Toucans, little groups of two or\r\nthree closely allied species being often found in the same or closely\r\nadjoining districts, as we have had the good fortune of personally\r\nverifying. Fishes give evidence of a similar kind: each great river has\r\nits peculiar genera, and in more extensive genera its groups of closely\r\nallied species. But it is the same throughout Nature; every class and\r\norder of animals will contribute similar facts. Hitherto no attempt has\r\nbeen made to explain these singular phenomena, or to show how they have\r\narisen. Why are the genera of Palms and of Orchids in almost every case\r\nconfined to one hemisphere? Why are the closely allied species of\r\nbrown-backed Trogons all found in the East, and the green-backed in the\r\nWest? Why are the Macaws and the Cockatoos similarly restricted? Insects\r\nfurnish a countless number of analogous examples;--the Goliathi of\r\nAfrica, the Ornithopteræ of the Indian Islands, the Heliconidæ of South\r\nAmerica, the Danaidæ of the East, and in all, the most closely allied\r\nspecies found in geographical proximity. The question forces itself\r\nupon every thinking mind,--why are these things so? They could not be as\r\nthey are had no law regulated their creation and dispersion. The law\r\nhere enunciated not merely explains, but necessitates the facts we see\r\nto exist, while the vast and long-continued geological changes of the\r\nearth readily account for the exceptions and apparent discrepancies that\r\nhere and there occur. The writer's object in putting forward his views\r\nin the present imperfect manner is to submit them to the test of other\r\nminds, and to be made aware of all the facts supposed to be inconsistent\r\nwith them. As his hypothesis is one which claims acceptance solely as\r\nexplaining and connecting facts which exist in nature, he expects facts\r\nalone to be brought to disprove it, not _à priori_ arguments against its\r\nprobability.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Geological Distribution of the Forms of Life._\r\n\r\nThe phænomena of geological distribution are exactly analogous to those\r\nof geography. Closely allied species are found associated in the same\r\nbeds, and the change from species to species appears to have been as\r\ngradual in time as in space. Geology, however, furnishes us with\r\npositive proof of the extinction and production of species, though it\r\ndoes not inform us how either has taken place. The extinction of\r\nspecies, however, offers but little difficulty, and the _modus operandi_\r\nhas been well illustrated by Sir C. Lyell in his admirable\r\n\"Principles.\" Geological changes, however gradual, must occasionally\r\nhave modified external conditions to such an extent as to have rendered\r\nthe existence of certain species impossible. The extinction would in\r\nmost cases be effected by a gradual dying-out, but in some instances\r\nthere might have been a sudden destruction of a species of limited\r\nrange. To discover how the extinct species have from time to time been\r\nreplaced by new ones down to the very latest geological period, is the\r\nmost difficult, and at the same time the most interesting problem in the\r\nnatural history of the earth. The present inquiry, which seeks to\r\neliminate from known facts a law which has determined, to a certain\r\ndegree, what species could and did appear at a given epoch, may, it is\r\nhoped, be considered as one step in the right direction towards a\r\ncomplete solution of it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_High Organization of very ancient Animals consistent with this Law._\r\n\r\nMuch discussion has of late years taken place on the question, whether\r\nthe succession of life upon the globe has been from a lower to a higher\r\ndegree of organization. The admitted facts seem to show that there has\r\nbeen a general, but not a detailed progression. Mollusca and Radiata\r\nexisted before Vertebrata, and the progression from Fishes to Reptiles\r\nand Mammalia, and also from the lower mammals to the higher, is\r\nindisputable. On the other hand, it is said that the Mollusca and\r\nRadiata of the very earliest periods were more highly organized than the\r\ngreat mass of those now existing, and that the very first fishes that\r\nhave been discovered are by no means the lowest organised of the class.\r\nNow it is believed the present hypothesis will harmonize with all these\r\nfacts, and in a great measure serve to explain them; for though it may\r\nappear to some readers essentially a theory of progression, it is in\r\nreality only one of gradual change. It is, however, by no means\r\ndifficult to show that a real progression in the scale of organization\r\nis perfectly consistent with all the appearances, and even with apparent\r\nretrogression, should such occur.\r\n\r\nReturning to the analogy of a branching tree, as the best mode of\r\nrepresenting the natural arrangement of species and their successive\r\ncreation, let us suppose that at an early geological epoch any group\r\n(say a class of the Mollusca) has attained to a great richness of\r\nspecies and a high organization. Now let this great branch of allied\r\nspecies, by geological mutations, be completely or partially destroyed.\r\nSubsequently a new branch springs from the same trunk, that is to say,\r\nnew species are successively created, having for their antitypes the\r\nsame lower organized species which had served as the antitypes for the\r\nformer group, but which have survived the modified conditions which\r\ndestroyed it. This new group being subject to these altered conditions,\r\nhas modifications of structure and organization given to it, and\r\nbecomes the representative group of the former one in another geological\r\nformation. It may, however, happen, that though later in time, the new\r\nseries of species may never attain to so high a degree of organization\r\nas those preceding it, but in its turn become extinct, and give place to\r\nyet another modification from the same root, which may be of higher or\r\nlower organization, more or less numerous in species, and more or less\r\nvaried in form and structure than either of those which preceded it.\r\nAgain, each of these groups may not have become totally extinct, but may\r\nhave left a few species, the modified prototypes of which have existed\r\nin each succeeding period, a faint memorial of their former grandeur and\r\nluxuriance. Thus every case of apparent retrogression may be in reality\r\na progress, though an interrupted one: when some monarch of the forest\r\nloses a limb, it may be replaced by a feeble and sickly substitute. The\r\nforegoing remarks appear to apply to the case of the Mollusca, which, at\r\na very early period, had reached a high organization and a great\r\ndevelopment of forms and species in the testaceous Cephalopoda. In each\r\nsucceeding age modified species and genera replaced the former ones\r\nwhich had become extinct, and as we approach the present æra, but few\r\nand small representatives of the group remain, while the Gasteropods and\r\nBivalves have acquired an immense preponderance. In the long series of\r\nchanges the earth has undergone, the process of peopling it with organic\r\nbeings has been continually going on, and whenever any of the higher\r\ngroups have become nearly or quite extinct, the lower forms which have\r\nbetter resisted the modified physical conditions have served as the\r\nantitypes on which to found the new races. In this manner alone, it is\r\nbelieved, can the representative groups at successive periods, and the\r\nrisings and fallings in the scale of organization, be in every case\r\nexplained.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Objections to Forbes' Theory of Polarity._\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis of polarity, recently put forward by Professor Edward\r\nForbes to account for the abundance of generic forms at a very early\r\nperiod and at present, while in the intermediate epochs there is a\r\ngradual diminution and impoverishment, till the minimum occurred at the\r\nconfines of the Palæozoic and Secondary epochs, appears to us quite\r\nunnecessary, as the facts may be readily accounted for on the principles\r\nalready laid down. Between the Palæozoic and Neozoic periods of\r\nProfessor Forbes, there is scarcely a species in common, and the greater\r\npart of the genera and families also disappear to be replaced by new\r\nones. It is almost universally admitted that such a change in the\r\norganic world must have occupied a vast period of time. Of this interval\r\nwe have no record; probably because the whole area of the early\r\nformations now exposed to our researches was elevated at the end of the\r\nPalæozoic period, and remained so through the interval required for the\r\norganic changes which resulted in the fauna and flora of the Secondary\r\nperiod. The records of this interval are buried beneath the ocean which\r\ncovers three-fourths of the globe. Now it appears highly probable that a\r\nlong period of quiescence or stability in the physical conditions of a\r\ndistrict would be most favourable to the existence of organic life in\r\nthe greatest abundance, both as regards individuals and also as to\r\nvariety of species and generic group, just as we now find that the\r\nplaces best adapted to the rapid growth and increase of individuals also\r\ncontain the greatest profusion of species and the greatest variety of\r\nforms,--the tropics in comparison with the temperate and arctic regions.\r\nOn the other hand, it seems no less probable that a change in the\r\nphysical conditions of a district, even small in amount if rapid, or\r\neven gradual if to a great amount, would be highly unfavourable to the\r\nexistence of individuals, might cause the extinction of many species,\r\nand would probably be equally unfavourable to the creation of new ones.\r\nIn this too we may find an analogy with the present state of our earth,\r\nfor it has been shown to be the violent extremes and rapid changes of\r\nphysical conditions, rather than the actual mean state in the temperate\r\nand frigid zones, which renders them less prolific than the tropical\r\nregions, as exemplified by the great distance beyond the tropics to\r\nwhich tropical forms penetrate when the climate is equable, and also by\r\nthe richness in species and forms of tropical mountain regions which\r\nprincipally differ from the temperate zone in the uniformity of their\r\nclimate. However this may be, it seems a fair assumption that during a\r\nperiod of geological repose the new species which we know to have been\r\ncreated would have appeared; that the creations would then exceed in\r\nnumber the extinctions, and therefore the number of species would\r\nincrease. In a period of geological activity, on the other hand, it\r\nseems probable that the extinctions might exceed the creations, and the\r\nnumber of species consequently diminish. That such effects did take\r\nplace in connexion with the causes to which we have imputed them, is\r\nshown in the case of the Coal formation, the faults and contortions of\r\nwhich show a period of great activity and violent convulsions, and it is\r\nin the formation immediately succeeding this that the poverty of forms\r\nof life is most apparent. We have then only to suppose a long period of\r\nsomewhat similar action during the vast unknown interval at the\r\ntermination of the Palæozoic period, and then a decreasing violence or\r\nrapidity through the Secondary period, to allow for the gradual\r\nrepopulation of the earth with varied forms, and the whole of the facts\r\nare explained.[B] We thus have a clue to the increase of the forms of\r\nlife during certain periods, and their decrease during others, without\r\nrecourse to any causes but those we know to have existed, and to\r\neffects fairly deducible from them. The precise manner in which the\r\ngeological changes of the early formations were effected is so extremely\r\nobscure, that when we can explain important facts by a retardation at\r\none time and an acceleration at another of a process which we know from\r\nits nature and from observation to have been unequal,--a cause so simple\r\nmay surely be preferred to one so obscure and hypothetical as polarity.\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  | [B] Professor Ramsay has since shown that a glacial epoch    |\r\n  | probably occurred at the time of the Permian formation,      |\r\n  | which will more satisfactorily account for the comparative   |\r\n  | poverty of species.                                          |\r\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nI would also venture to suggest some reasons against the very nature of\r\nthe theory of Professor Forbes. Our knowledge of the organic world\r\nduring any geological epoch is necessarily very imperfect. Looking at\r\nthe vast numbers of species and groups that have been discovered by\r\ngeologists, this may be doubted; but we should compare their numbers not\r\nmerely with those that now exist upon the earth, but with a far larger\r\namount. We have no reason for believing that the number of species on\r\nthe earth at any former period was much less than at present; at all\r\nevents the aquatic portion, with which geologists have most\r\nacquaintance, was probably often as great or greater. Now we know that\r\nthere have been many complete changes of species; new sets of organisms\r\nhave many times been introduced in place of old ones which have become\r\nextinct, so that the total amount which have existed on the earth from\r\nthe earliest geological period must have borne about the same proportion\r\nto those now living, as the whole human race who have lived and died\r\nupon the earth, to the population at the present time. Again, at each\r\nepoch, the whole earth was no doubt, as now, more or less the theatre of\r\nlife, and as the successive generations of each species died, their\r\nexuviæ and preservable parts would be deposited over every portion of\r\nthe then existing seas and oceans, which we have reason for supposing to\r\nhave been more, rather than less, extensive than at present. In order\r\nthen to understand our possible knowledge of the early world and its\r\ninhabitants, we must compare, not the area of the whole field of our\r\ngeological researches with the earth's surface, but the area of the\r\nexamined portion of each formation separately with the whole earth. For\r\nexample, during the Silurian period all the earth was Silurian, and\r\nanimals were living and dying, and depositing their remains more or less\r\nover the whole area of the globe, and they were probably (the species at\r\nleast) nearly as varied in different latitudes and longitudes as at\r\npresent. What proportion do the Silurian districts bear to the whole\r\nsurface of the globe, land and sea (for far more extensive Silurian\r\ndistricts probably exist beneath the ocean than above it), and what\r\nportion of the known Silurian districts has been actually examined for\r\nfossils? Would the area of rock actually laid open to the eye be the\r\nthousandth or the ten-thousandth part of the earth's surface? Ask the\r\nsame question with regard to the Oolite or the Chalk, or even to\r\nparticular beds of these when they differ considerably in their\r\nfossils, and you may then get some notion of how small a portion of the\r\nwhole we know.\r\n\r\nBut yet more important is the probability, nay almost the certainty,\r\nthat whole formations containing the records of vast geological periods\r\nare entirely buried beneath the ocean, and for ever beyond our reach.\r\nMost of the gaps in the geological series may thus be filled up, and\r\nvast numbers of unknown and unimaginable animals, which might help to\r\nelucidate the affinities of the numerous isolated groups which are a\r\nperpetual puzzle to the zoologist, may there be buried, till future\r\nrevolutions may raise them in their turn above the waters, to afford\r\nmaterials for the study of whatever race of intelligent beings may then\r\nhave succeeded us. These considerations must lead us to the conclusion,\r\nthat our knowledge of the whole series of the former inhabitants of the\r\nearth is necessarily most imperfect and fragmentary,--as much so as our\r\nknowledge of the present organic world would be, were we forced to make\r\nour collections and observations only in spots equally limited in area\r\nand in number with those actually laid open for the collection of\r\nfossils. Now, the hypothesis of Professor Forbes is essentially one that\r\nassumes to a great extent the completeness of our knowledge of the whole\r\nseries of organic beings which have existed on the earth. This\r\nappears to be a fatal objection to it, independently of all other\r\nconsiderations. It may be said that the same objections exist against\r\nevery theory on such a subject, but this is not necessarily the case.\r\nThe hypothesis put forward in this paper depends in no degree upon the\r\ncompleteness of our knowledge of the former condition of the organic\r\nworld, but takes what facts we have as fragments of a vast whole, and\r\ndeduces from them something of the nature and proportions of that whole\r\nwhich we can never know in detail. It is founded upon isolated groups of\r\nfacts, recognizes their isolation, and endeavours to deduce from them\r\nthe nature of the intervening portions.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Rudimentary Organs._\r\n\r\nAnother important series of facts, quite in accordance with, and even\r\nnecessary deductions from, the law now developed, are those of\r\nrudimentary organs. That these really do exist, and in most cases have\r\nno special function in the animal oeconomy, is admitted by the first\r\nauthorities in comparative anatomy. The minute limbs hidden beneath the\r\nskin in many of the snake-like lizards, the anal hooks of the boa\r\nconstrictor, the complete series of jointed finger-bones in the paddle\r\nof the Manatus and whale, are a few of the most familiar instances. In\r\nbotany a similar class of facts has been long recognised. Abortive\r\nstamens, rudimentary floral envelopes and undeveloped carpels, are of\r\nthe most frequent occurrence. To every thoughtful naturalist the\r\nquestion must arise, What are these for? What have they to do with the\r\ngreat laws of creation? Do they not teach us something of the system of\r\nNature? If each species has been created independently, and without any\r\nnecessary relations with pre-existing species, what do these rudiments,\r\nthese apparent imperfections mean? There must be a cause for them; they\r\nmust be the necessary results of some great natural law. Now, if, as it\r\nhas been endeavoured to be shown, the great law which has regulated the\r\npeopling of the earth with animal and vegetable life is, that every\r\nchange shall be gradual; that no new creature shall be formed widely\r\ndiffering from anything before existing; that in this, as in everything\r\nelse in Nature, there shall be gradation and harmony,--then these\r\nrudimentary organs are necessary, and are an essential part of the\r\nsystem of Nature. Ere the higher Vertebrata were formed, for instance,\r\nmany steps were required, and many organs had to undergo modifications\r\nfrom the rudimental condition in which only they had as yet existed. We\r\nstill see remaining an antitypal sketch of a wing adapted for flight in\r\nthe scaly flapper of the penguin, and limbs first concealed beneath the\r\nskin, and then weakly protruding from it, were the necessary gradations\r\nbefore others should be formed fully adapted for locomotion.[C] Many\r\nmore of these modifications should we behold, and more complete series\r\nof them, had we a view of all the forms which have ceased to live. The\r\ngreat gaps that exist between fishes, reptiles, birds, and mammals would\r\nthen, no doubt, be softened down by intermediate groups, and the whole\r\norganic world would be seen to be an unbroken and harmonious system.\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  | [C] The theory of Natural Selection has now taught us that   |\r\n  | these are not the steps by which limbs have been formed; and |\r\n  | that most rudimentary organs have been produced by abortion, |\r\n  | owing to disuse, as explained by Mr. Darwin.                 |\r\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n\r\n_Conclusion._\r\n\r\nIt has now been shown, though most briefly and imperfectly, how the law\r\nthat \"_Every species has come into existence coincident both in time and\r\nspace with a pre-existing closely allied species_,\" connects together\r\nand renders intelligible a vast number of independent and hitherto\r\nunexplained facts. The natural system of arrangement of organic beings,\r\ntheir geographical distribution, their geological sequence, the\r\nphænomena of representative and substituted groups in all their\r\nmodifications, and the most singular peculiarities of anatomical\r\nstructure, are all explained and illustrated by it, in perfect\r\naccordance with the vast mass of facts which the researches of modern\r\nnaturalists have brought together, and, it is believed, not materially\r\nopposed to any of them. It also claims a superiority over previous\r\nhypotheses, on the ground that it not merely explains, but necessitates\r\nwhat exists. Granted the law, and many of the most important facts in\r\nNature could not have been otherwise, but are almost as necessary\r\ndeductions from it, as are the elliptic orbits of the planets from the\r\nlaw of gravitation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nII.\r\n\r\nON THE TENDENCY OF VARIETIES TO DEPART INDEFINITELY FROM THE ORIGINAL\r\nTYPE.[D]\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  | [D] Written at Ternate, February, 1858; and published in the |\r\n  | Journal of the Proceedings of the Linnæan Society for        |\r\n  | August, 1858.                                                |\r\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\n\r\n_Instability of Varieties supposed to prove the permanent distinctness\r\nof Species._\r\n\r\nOne of the strongest arguments which have been adduced to prove the\r\noriginal and permanent distinctness of species is, that _varieties_\r\nproduced in a state of domesticity are more or less unstable, and often\r\nhave a tendency, if left to themselves, to return to the normal form of\r\nthe parent species; and this instability is considered to be a\r\ndistinctive peculiarity of all varieties, even of those occurring among\r\nwild animals in a state of nature, and to constitute a provision for\r\npreserving unchanged the originally created distinct species.\r\n\r\nIn the absence or scarcity of facts and observations as to _varieties_\r\noccurring among wild animals, this argument has had great weight with\r\nnaturalists, and has led to a very general and somewhat prejudiced\r\nbelief in the stability of species. Equally general, however, is the\r\nbelief in what are called \"permanent or true varieties,\"--races of\r\nanimals which continually propagate their like, but which differ so\r\nslightly (although constantly) from some other race, that the one is\r\nconsidered to be a _variety_ of the other. Which is the _variety_ and\r\nwhich the original _species_, there is generally no means of\r\ndetermining, except in those rare cases in which the one race has been\r\nknown to produce an offspring unlike itself and resembling the other.\r\nThis, however, would seem quite incompatible with the \"permanent\r\ninvariability of species,\" but the difficulty is overcome by assuming\r\nthat such varieties have strict limits, and can never again vary further\r\nfrom the original type, although they may return to it, which, from the\r\nanalogy of the domesticated animals, is considered to be highly\r\nprobable, if not certainly proved.\r\n\r\nIt will be observed that this argument rests entirely on the assumption,\r\nthat _varieties_ occurring in a state of nature are in all respects\r\nanalogous to or even identical with those of domestic animals, and are\r\ngoverned by the same laws as regards their permanence or further\r\nvariation. But it is the object of the present paper to show that this\r\nassumption is altogether false, that there is a general principle in\r\nnature which will cause many _varieties_ to survive the parent species,\r\nand to give rise to successive variations departing further and further\r\nfrom the original type; and which also produces, in domesticated\r\nanimals, the tendency of varieties to return to the parent form.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Struggle for Existence._\r\n\r\nThe life of wild animals is a struggle for existence. The full exertion\r\nof all their faculties and all their energies is required to preserve\r\ntheir own existence and provide for that of their infant offspring. The\r\npossibility of procuring food during the least favourable seasons, and\r\nof escaping the attacks of their most dangerous enemies, are the primary\r\nconditions which determine the existence both of individuals and of\r\nentire species. These conditions will also determine the population of a\r\nspecies; and by a careful consideration of all the circumstances we may\r\nbe enabled to comprehend, and in some degree to explain, what at first\r\nsight appears so inexplicable--the excessive abundance of some species,\r\nwhile others closely allied to them are very rare.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Law of Population of Species._\r\n\r\nThe general proportion that must obtain between certain groups of\r\nanimals is readily seen. Large animals cannot be so abundant as small\r\nones; the carnivora must be less numerous than the herbivora; eagles and\r\nlions can never be so plentiful as pigeons and antelopes; and the wild\r\nasses of the Tartarian deserts cannot equal in numbers the horses of the\r\nmore luxuriant prairies and pampas of America. The greater or less\r\nfecundity of an animal is often considered to be one of the chief causes\r\nof its abundance or scarcity; but a consideration of the facts will show\r\nus that it really has little or nothing to do with the matter. Even the\r\nleast prolific of animals would increase rapidly if unchecked, whereas\r\nit is evident that the animal population of the globe must be\r\nstationary, or perhaps, through the influence of man, decreasing.\r\nFluctuations there may be; but permanent increase, except in restricted\r\nlocalities, is almost impossible. For example, our own observation must\r\nconvince us that birds do not go on increasing every year in a\r\ngeometrical ratio, as they would do, were there not some powerful check\r\nto their natural increase. Very few birds produce less than two young\r\nones each year, while many have six, eight, or ten; four will certainly\r\nbe below the average; and if we suppose that each pair produce young\r\nonly four times in their life, that will also be below the average,\r\nsupposing them not to die either by violence or want of food. Yet at\r\nthis rate how tremendous would be the increase in a few years from a\r\nsingle pair! A simple calculation will show that in fifteen years each\r\npair of birds would have increased to nearly ten millions![E] whereas we\r\nhave no reason to believe that the number of the birds of any country\r\nincreases at all in fifteen or in one hundred and fifty years. With such\r\npowers of increase the population must have reached its limits, and\r\nhave become stationary, in a very few years after the origin of each\r\nspecies. It is evident, therefore, that each year an immense number of\r\nbirds must perish--as many in fact as are born; and as on the lowest\r\ncalculation the progeny are each year twice as numerous as their\r\nparents, it follows that, whatever be the average number of individuals\r\nexisting in any given country, _twice that number must perish\r\nannually_,--a striking result, but one which seems at least highly\r\nprobable, and is perhaps under rather than over the truth. It would\r\ntherefore appear that, as far as the continuance of the species and the\r\nkeeping up the average number of individuals are concerned, large broods\r\nare superfluous. On the average all above _one_ become food for hawks\r\nand kites, wild cats or weasels, or perish of cold and hunger as winter\r\ncomes on. This is strikingly proved by the case of particular species;\r\nfor we find that their abundance in individuals bears no relation\r\nwhatever to their fertility in producing offspring.\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  | [E] This is under estimated. The number would really amount  |\r\n  | to more than two thousand millions!                          |\r\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most remarkable instance of an immense bird population is\r\nthat of the passenger pigeon of the United States, which lays only one,\r\nor at most two eggs, and is said to rear generally but one young one.\r\nWhy is this bird so extraordinarily abundant, while others producing two\r\nor three times as many young are much less plentiful? The explanation is\r\nnot difficult. The food most congenial to this species, and on which it\r\nthrives best, is abundantly distributed over a very extensive region,\r\noffering such differences of soil and climate, that in one part or\r\nanother of the area the supply never fails. The bird is capable of a\r\nvery rapid and long-continued flight, so that it can pass without\r\nfatigue over the whole of the district it inhabits, and as soon as the\r\nsupply of food begins to fail in one place is able to discover a fresh\r\nfeeding-ground. This example strikingly shows us that the procuring a\r\nconstant supply of wholesome food is almost the sole condition requisite\r\nfor ensuring the rapid increase of a given species, since neither the\r\nlimited fecundity, nor the unrestrained attacks of birds of prey and of\r\nman are here sufficient to check it. In no other birds are these\r\npeculiar circumstances so strikingly combined. Either their food is more\r\nliable to failure, or they have not sufficient power of wing to search\r\nfor it over an extensive area, or during some season of the year it\r\nbecomes very scarce, and less wholesome substitutes have to be found;\r\nand thus, though more fertile in offspring, they can never increase\r\nbeyond the supply of food in the least favourable seasons.\r\n\r\nMany birds can only exist by migrating, when their food becomes scarce,\r\nto regions possessing a milder, or at least a different climate, though,\r\nas these migrating birds are seldom excessively abundant, it is evident\r\nthat the countries they visit are still deficient in a constant and\r\nabundant supply of wholesome food. Those whose organization does not\r\npermit them to migrate when their food becomes periodically scarce, can\r\nnever attain a large population. This is probably the reasons why\r\nwoodpeckers are scarce with us, while in the tropics they are among the\r\nmost abundant of solitary birds. Thus the house sparrow is more\r\nabundant than the redbreast, because its food is more constant and\r\nplentiful,--seeds of grasses being preserved during the winter, and our\r\nfarm-yards and stubble-fields furnishing an almost inexhaustible supply.\r\nWhy, as a general rule, are aquatic, and especially sea birds, very\r\nnumerous in individuals? Not because they are more prolific than others,\r\ngenerally the contrary; but because their food never fails, the\r\nsea-shores and river-banks daily swarming with a fresh supply of small\r\nmollusca and crustacea. Exactly the same laws will apply to mammals.\r\nWild cats are prolific and have few enemies; why then are they never as\r\nabundant as rabbits? The only intelligible answer is, that their supply\r\nof food is more precarious. It appears evident, therefore, that so long\r\nas a country remains physically unchanged, the numbers of its animal\r\npopulation cannot materially increase. If one species does so, some\r\nothers requiring the same kind of food must diminish in proportion. The\r\nnumbers that die annually must be immense; and as the individual\r\nexistence of each animal depends upon itself, those that die must be\r\nthe weakest--the very young, the aged, and the diseased--while those\r\nthat prolong their existence can only be the most perfect in health and\r\nvigour--those who are best able to obtain food regularly, and avoid\r\ntheir numerous enemies. It is, as we commenced by remarking, \"a struggle\r\nfor existence,\" in which the weakest and least perfectly organized must\r\nalways succumb.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Abundance or Rarity of a Species dependent upon its more or less\r\nperfect Adaptation to the Conditions of Existence._\r\n\r\nIt seems evident that what takes place among the individuals of a\r\nspecies must also occur among the several allied species of a\r\ngroup,--viz., that those which are best adapted to obtain a regular\r\nsupply of food, and to defend themselves against the attacks of their\r\nenemies and the vicissitudes of the seasons, must necessarily obtain and\r\npreserve a superiority in population; while those species which from\r\nsome defect of power or organization are the least capable of\r\ncounteracting the vicissitudes of food-supply, &c., must diminish in\r\nnumbers, and, in extreme cases, become altogether extinct. Between these\r\nextremes the species will present various degrees of capacity for\r\nensuring the means of preserving life; and it is thus we account for the\r\nabundance or rarity of species. Our ignorance will generally prevent us\r\nfrom accurately tracing the effects to their causes; but could we become\r\nperfectly acquainted with the organization and habits of the various\r\nspecies of animals, and could we measure the capacity of each for\r\nperforming the different acts necessary to its safety and existence\r\nunder all the varying circumstances by which it is surrounded, we might\r\nbe able even to calculate the proportionate abundance of individuals\r\nwhich is the necessary result.\r\n\r\nIf now we have succeeded in establishing these two points--1st, _that\r\nthe animal population of a country is generally stationary, being kept\r\ndown by a periodical deficiency of food, and other checks_; and, 2nd,\r\n_that the comparative abundance or scarcity of the individuals of the\r\nseveral species is entirely due to their organization and resulting\r\nhabits, which, rendering it more difficult to procure a regular supply\r\nof food and to provide for their personal safety in some cases than in\r\nothers, can only be balanced by a difference in the population which\r\nhave to exist in a given area_--we shall be in a condition to proceed to\r\nthe consideration of _varieties_, to which the preceding remarks have a\r\ndirect and very important application.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Useful Variations will tend to Increase; useless or hurtful Variations\r\nto Diminish._\r\n\r\nMost or perhaps all the variations from the typical form of a species\r\nmust have some definite effect, however slight, on the habits or\r\ncapacities of the individuals. Even a change of colour might, by\r\nrendering them more or less distinguishable, affect their safety; a\r\ngreater or less development of hair might modify their habits. More\r\nimportant changes, such as an increase in the power or dimensions of the\r\nlimbs or any of the external organs, would more or less affect their\r\nmode of procuring food or the range of country which they could inhabit.\r\nIt is also evident that most changes would affect, either favourably or\r\nadversely, the powers of prolonging existence. An antelope with shorter\r\nor weaker legs must necessarily suffer more from the attacks of the\r\nfeline carnivora; the passenger pigeon with less powerful wings would\r\nsooner or later be affected in its powers of procuring a regular supply\r\nof food; and in both cases the result must necessarily be a diminution\r\nof the population of the modified species. If, on the other hand, any\r\nspecies should produce a variety having slightly increased powers of\r\npreserving existence, that variety must inevitably in time acquire a\r\nsuperiority in numbers. These results must follow as surely as old age,\r\nintemperance, or scarcity of food produce an increased mortality. In\r\nboth cases there may be many individual exceptions; but on the average\r\nthe rule will invariably be found to hold good. All varieties will\r\ntherefore fall into two classes--those which under the same conditions\r\nwould never reach the population of the parent species, and those which\r\nwould in time obtain and keep a numerical superiority. Now, let some\r\nalteration of physical conditions occur in the district--a long period\r\nof drought, a destruction of vegetation by locusts, the irruption of\r\nsome new carnivorous animal seeking \"pastures new\"--any change in fact\r\ntending to render existence more difficult to the species in question,\r\nand tasking its utmost powers to avoid complete extermination; it is\r\nevident that, of all the individuals composing the species, those\r\nforming the least numerous and most feebly organized variety would\r\nsuffer first, and, were the pressure severe, must soon become extinct.\r\nThe same causes continuing in action, the parent species would next\r\nsuffer, would gradually diminish in numbers, and with a recurrence of\r\nsimilar unfavourable conditions might also become extinct. Tho superior\r\nvariety would then alone remain, and on a return to favourable\r\ncircumstances would rapidly increase in numbers and occupy the place of\r\nthe extinct species and variety.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Superior Varieties will ultimately Extirpate the original Species._\r\n\r\nThe _variety_ would now have replaced the _species_, of which it would\r\nbe a more perfectly developed and more highly organized form. It would\r\nbe in all respects better adapted to secure its safety, and to prolong\r\nits individual existence and that of the race. Such a variety _could\r\nnot_ return to the original form; for that form is an inferior one, and\r\ncould never compete with it for existence. Granted, therefore, a\r\n\"tendency\" to reproduce the original type of the species, still the\r\nvariety must ever remain preponderant in numbers, and under adverse\r\nphysical conditions _again alone survive_. But this new, improved, and\r\npopulous race might itself, in course of time, give rise to new\r\nvarieties, exhibiting several diverging modifications of form, any of\r\nwhich, tending to increase the facilities for preserving existence,\r\nmust, by the same general law, in their turn become predominant. Here,\r\nthen, we have _progression and continued divergence_ deduced from the\r\ngeneral laws which regulate the existence of animals in a state of\r\nnature, and from the undisputed fact that varieties do frequently occur.\r\nIt is not, however, contended that this result would be invariable; a\r\nchange of physical conditions in the district might at times materially\r\nmodify it, rendering the race which had been the most capable of\r\nsupporting existence under the former conditions now the least so, and\r\neven causing the extinction of the newer and, for a time, superior race,\r\nwhile the old or parent species and its first inferior varieties\r\ncontinued to flourish. Variations in unimportant parts might also occur,\r\nhaving no perceptible effect on the life-preserving powers; and the\r\nvarieties so furnished might run a course parallel with the parent\r\nspecies, either giving rise to further variations or returning to the\r\nformer type. All we argue for is, that certain varieties have a tendency\r\nto maintain their existence longer than the original species, and this\r\ntendency must make itself felt; for though the doctrine of chances or\r\naverages can never be trusted to on a limited scale, yet, if applied to\r\nhigh numbers, the results come nearer to what theory demands, and, as we\r\napproach to an infinity of examples, become strictly accurate. Now the\r\nscale on which nature works is so vast--the numbers of individuals and\r\nthe periods of time with which she deals approach so near to infinity,\r\nthan any cause, however slight, and however liable to be veiled and\r\ncounteracted by accidental circumstances, must in the end produce its\r\nfull legitimate results.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Partial Reversion of Domesticated Varieties explained._\r\n\r\nLet us now turn to domesticated animals, and inquire how varieties\r\nproduced among them are affected by the principles here enunciated. The\r\nessential difference in the condition of wild and domestic animals is\r\nthis,--that among the former, their well-being and very existence depend\r\nupon the full exercise and healthy condition of all their senses and\r\nphysical powers, whereas, among the latter, these are only partially\r\nexercised, and in some cases are absolutely unused. A wild animal has to\r\nsearch, and often to labour, for every mouthful of food--to exercise\r\nsight, hearing, and smell in seeking it, and in avoiding dangers, in\r\nprocuring shelter from the inclemency of the seasons, and in providing\r\nfor the subsistence and safety of its offspring. There is no muscle of\r\nits body that is not called into daily and hourly activity; there is no\r\nsense or faculty that is not strengthened by continual exercise. The\r\ndomestic animal, on the other hand, has food provided for it, is\r\nsheltered, and often confined, to guard it against the vicissitudes of\r\nthe seasons, is carefully secured from the attacks of its natural\r\nenemies, and seldom even rears its young without human assistance. Half\r\nof its senses and faculties become quite useless, and the other half are\r\nbut occasionally called into feeble exercise, while even its muscular\r\nsystem is only irregularly brought into action.\r\n\r\nNow when a variety of such an animal occurs, having increased power or\r\ncapacity in any organ or sense, such increase is totally useless, is\r\nnever called into action, and may even exist without the animal ever\r\nbecoming aware of it. In the wild animal, on the contrary, all its\r\nfaculties and powers being brought into full action for the necessities\r\nof existence, any increase becomes immediately available, is\r\nstrengthened by exercise, and must even slightly modify the food, the\r\nhabits, and the whole economy of the race. It creates as it were a new\r\nanimal, one of superior powers, and which will necessarily increase in\r\nnumbers and outlive those which are inferior to it.\r\n\r\nAgain, in the domesticated animal all variations have an equal chance of\r\ncontinuance; and those which would decidedly render a wild animal unable\r\nto compete with its fellows and continue its existence are no\r\ndisadvantage whatever in a state of domesticity. Our quickly fattening\r\npigs, short-legged sheep pouter pigeons, and poodle dogs could never\r\nhave come into existence in a state of nature, because the very first\r\nstep towards such inferior forms would have led to the rapid extinction\r\nof the race; still less could they now exist in competition with their\r\nwild allies. The great speed but slight endurance of the race horse, the\r\nunwieldy strength of the ploughman's team, would both be useless in a\r\nstate of nature. If turned wild on the pampas, such animals would\r\nprobably soon become extinct, or under favourable circumstances might\r\neach gradually lose those extreme qualities which would never be called\r\ninto action, and in a few generations revert to a common type, which\r\nmust be that in which the various powers and faculties are so\r\nproportioned to each other as to be best adapted to procure food and\r\nsecure safety,--that in which by the full exercise of every part of its\r\norganisation the animal can alone continue to live. Domestic varieties,\r\nwhen turned wild, _must_ return to something near the type of the\r\noriginal wild stock, _or become altogether extinct_.[F]\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  | [F] That is, they will vary, and the variations which tend   |\r\n  | to adapt them to the wild state, and therefore approximate   |\r\n  | them to wild animals, will be preserved. Those individuals   |\r\n  | which do not vary sufficiently will perish.                  |\r\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nWe see, then, that no inferences as to the permanence of varieties in a\r\nstate of nature can be deduced from the observations of those occurring\r\namong domestic animals. The two are so much opposed to each other in\r\nevery circumstance of their existence, that what applies to the one is\r\nalmost sure not to apply to the other. Domestic animals are abnormal,\r\nirregular, artificial; they are subject to variations which never occur\r\nand never can occur in a state of nature: their very existence depends\r\naltogether on human care; so far are many of them removed from that just\r\nproportion of faculties, that true balance of organisation, by means of\r\nwhich alone an animal left to its own resources can preserve its\r\nexistence and continue its race.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lamarck's Hypothesis very different from that now advanced._\r\n\r\nThe hypothesis of Lamarck--that progressive changes in species have been\r\nproduced by the attempts of animals to increase the development of their\r\nown organs, and thus modify their structure and habits--has been\r\nrepeatedly and easily refuted by all writers on the subject of varieties\r\nand species, and it seems to have been considered that when this was\r\ndone the whole question has been finally settled; but the view here\r\ndeveloped renders such hypothesis quite unnecessary, by showing that\r\nsimilar results must be produced by the action of principles constantly\r\nat work in nature. The powerful retractile talons of the falcon-and the\r\ncat-tribes have not been produced or increased by the volition of those\r\nanimals; but among the different varieties which occurred in the earlier\r\nand less highly organized forms of these groups, _those always survived\r\nlongest which had the greatest facilities for seizing their prey_.\r\nNeither did the giraffe acquire its long neck by desiring to reach the\r\nfoliage of the more lofty shrubs, and constantly stretching its neck for\r\nthe purpose, but because any varieties which occurred among its\r\nantitypes with a longer neck than usual _at once secured a fresh range\r\nof pasture over the same ground as their shorter-necked companions, and\r\non the first scarcity of food were thereby enabled to outlive them_.\r\nEven the peculiar colours of many animals, more especially of insects,\r\nso closely resembling the soil or leaves or bark on which they\r\nhabitually reside, are explained on the same principle; for though in\r\nthe course of ages varieties of many tints may have occurred, _yet those\r\nraces having colours best adapted to concealment from their enemies\r\nwould inevitably survive the longest_. We have also here an acting cause\r\nto account for that balance so often observed in nature,--a deficiency\r\nin one set of organs always being compensated by an increased\r\ndevelopment of some others--powerful wings accompanying weak feet, or\r\ngreat velocity making up for the absence of defensive weapons; for it\r\nhas been shown that all varieties in which an unbalanced deficiency\r\noccurred could not long continue their existence. The action of this\r\nprinciple is exactly like that of the centrifugal governor of the steam\r\nengine, which checks and corrects any irregularities almost before they\r\nbecome evident; and in like manner no unbalanced deficiency in the\r\nanimal kingdom can ever reach any conspicuous magnitude, because it\r\nwould make itself felt at the very first step, by rendering existence\r\ndifficult and extinction almost sure soon to follow. An origin such as\r\nis here advocated will also agree with the peculiar character of the\r\nmodifications of form and structure which obtain in organized\r\nbeings--the many lines of divergence from a central type, the increasing\r\nefficiency and power of a particular organ through a succession of\r\nallied species, and the remarkable persistence of unimportant parts,\r\nsuch as colour, texture of plumage and hair, form of horns or crests,\r\nthrough a series of species differing considerably in more essential\r\ncharacters. It also furnishes us with a reason for that \"more\r\nspecialized structure\" which Professor Owen states to be a\r\ncharacteristic of recent compared with extinct forms, and which would\r\nevidently be the result of the progressive modification of any organ\r\napplied to a special purpose in the animal economy.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Conclusion._\r\n\r\nWe believe we have now shown that there is a tendency in nature to the\r\ncontinued progression of certain classes of _varieties_ further and\r\nfurther from the original type--a progression to which there appears no\r\nreason to assign any definite limits--and that the same principle which\r\nproduces this result in a state of nature will also explain why domestic\r\nvarieties have a tendency, when they become wild, to revert to the\r\noriginal type. This progression, by minute steps, in various\r\ndirections, but always checked and balanced by the necessary conditions,\r\nsubject to which alone existence can be preserved, may, it is believed,\r\nbe followed out so as to agree with all the phænomena presented by\r\norganized beings, their extinction and succession in past ages, and all\r\nthe extraordinary modifications of form, instinct and habits which they\r\nexhibit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.\r\n\r\nMIMICRY, AND OTHER PROTECTIVE RESEMBLANCES AMONG ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThere is no more convincing proof of the truth of a comprehensive\r\ntheory, than its power of absorbing and finding a place for new facts,\r\nand its capability of interpreting phænomena which had been previously\r\nlooked upon as unaccountable anomalies. It is thus that the law of\r\nuniversal gravitation and the undulatory theory of light have become\r\nestablished and universally accepted by men of science. Fact after fact\r\nhas been brought forward as being apparently inconsistent with them, and\r\none after another these very facts have been shown to be the\r\nconsequences of the laws they were at first supposed to disprove. A\r\nfalse theory will never stand this test. Advancing knowledge brings to\r\nlight whole groups of facts which it cannot deal with, and its advocates\r\nsteadily decrease in numbers, notwithstanding the ability and scientific\r\nskill with which it may have been supported. The great name of Edward\r\nForbes did not prevent his theory of \"Polarity in the distribution of\r\nOrganic beings in Time\" from dying a natural death; but the most\r\nstriking illustration of the behaviour of a false theory is to be found\r\nin the \"Circular and Quinarian System\" of classification propounded by\r\nMacLeay, and developed by Swainson, with an amount of knowledge and\r\ningenuity that have rarely been surpassed. This theory was eminently\r\nattractive, both from its symmetry and completeness, and from the\r\ninteresting nature of the varied analogies and affinities which it\r\nbrought to light and made use of. The series of Natural History volumes\r\nin \"Lardner's Cabinet Cyclopædia,\" in which Mr. Swainson developed it in\r\nmost departments of the animal kingdom, made it widely known; and in\r\nfact for a long time these were the best and almost the only popular\r\ntext-books for the rising generation of naturalists. It was favourably\r\nreceived too by the older school, which was perhaps rather an indication\r\nof its unsoundness. A considerable number of well-known naturalists\r\neither spoke approvingly of it, or advocated similar principles, and for\r\na good many years it was decidedly in the ascendent. With such a\r\nfavourable introduction, and with such talented exponents, it must have\r\nbecome established if it had had any germ of truth in it; yet it quite\r\ndied out in a few short years, its very existence is now a matter of\r\nhistory; and so rapid was its fall that its talented creator, Swainson,\r\nperhaps lived to be the last man who believed in it.\r\n\r\nSuch is the course of a false theory. That of a true one is very\r\ndifferent, as may be well seen by the progress of opinion on the subject\r\nof Natural Selection. In less than eight years \"The Origin of Species\"\r\nhas produced conviction in the minds of a majority of the most eminent\r\nliving men of science. New facts, new problems, new difficulties as they\r\narise are accepted, solved or removed by this theory; and its principles\r\nare illustrated by the progress and conclusions of every well\r\nestablished branch of human knowledge. It is the object of the present\r\nessay to show how it has recently been applied to connect together and\r\nexplain a variety of curious facts which had long been considered as\r\ninexplicable anomalies.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Importance of the Principle of Utility._\r\n\r\nPerhaps no principle has ever been announced so fertile in results as\r\nthat which Mr. Darwin so earnestly impresses upon us, and which is\r\nindeed a necessary deduction from the theory of Natural Selection,\r\nnamely--that none of the definite facts of organic nature, no special\r\norgan, no characteristic form or marking, no peculiarities of instinct\r\nor of habit, no relations between species or between groups of\r\nspecies--can exist, but which must now be or once have been _useful_ to\r\nthe individuals or the races which possess them. This great principle\r\ngives us a clue which we can follow out in the study of many recondite\r\nphænomena, and leads us to seek a meaning and a purpose of some definite\r\ncharacter in minutiæ which we should be otherwise almost sure to pass\r\nover as insignificant or unimportant.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Popular Theories of Colour in Animals._\r\n\r\nThe adaptation of the external colouring of animals to their conditions\r\nof life has long been recognised, and has been imputed either to an\r\noriginally created specific peculiarity, or to the direct action of\r\nclimate, soil, or food. Where the former explanation has been accepted,\r\nit has completely checked inquiry, since we could never get any further\r\nthan the fact of the adaptation. There was nothing more to be known\r\nabout the matter. The second explanation was soon found to be quite\r\ninadequate to deal with all the varied phases of the phænomena, and to\r\nbe contradicted by many well-known facts. For example, wild rabbits are\r\nalways of grey or brown tints well suited for concealment among grass\r\nand fern. But when these rabbits are domesticated, without any change of\r\nclimate or food, they vary into white or black, and these varieties may\r\nbe multiplied to any extent, forming white or black races. Exactly the\r\nsame thing has occurred with pigeons; and in the case of rats and mice,\r\nthe white variety has not been shown to be at all dependent on\r\nalteration of climate, food, or other external conditions. In many cases\r\nthe wings of an insect not only assume the exact tint of the bark or\r\nleaf it is accustomed to rest on, but the form and veining of the leaf\r\nor the exact rugosity of the bark is imitated; and these detailed\r\nmodifications cannot be reasonably imputed to climate or to food, since\r\nin many cases the species does not feed on the substance it resembles,\r\nand when it does, no reasonable connexion can be shown to exist between\r\nthe supposed cause and the effect produced. It was reserved for the\r\ntheory of Natural Selection to solve all these problems, and many others\r\nwhich were not at first supposed to be directly connected with them. To\r\nmake these latter intelligible, it will be necessary to give a sketch of\r\nthe whole series of phænomena which may be classed under the head of\r\nuseful or protective resemblances.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Importance of Concealment as Influencing Colour._\r\n\r\nConcealment, more or less complete, is useful to many animals, and\r\nabsolutely essential to some. Those which have numerous enemies from\r\nwhich they cannot escape by rapidity of motion, find safety in\r\nconcealment. Those which prey upon others must also be so constituted as\r\nnot to alarm them by their presence or their approach, or they would\r\nsoon die of hunger. Now it is remarkable in how many cases nature gives\r\nthis boon to the animal, by colouring it with such tints as may best\r\nserve to enable it to escape from its enemies or to entrap its prey.\r\nDesert animals as a rule are desert-coloured. The lion is a typical\r\nexample of this, and must be almost invisible when crouched upon the\r\nsand or among desert rocks and stones. Antelopes are all more or less\r\nsandy-coloured. The camel is pre-eminently so. The Egyptian cat and the\r\nPampas cat are sandy or earth-coloured. The Australian kangaroos are of\r\nthe same tints, and the original colour of the wild horse is supposed to\r\nhave been a sandy or clay-colour.\r\n\r\nThe desert birds are still more remarkably protected by their\r\nassimilative hues. The stonechats, the larks, the quails, the\r\ngoatsuckers and the grouse, which abound in the North African and\r\nAsiatic deserts, are all tinted and mottled so as to resemble with\r\nwonderful accuracy the average colour and aspect of the soil in the\r\ndistrict they inhabit. The Rev. H. Tristram, in his account of the\r\nornithology of North Africa in the 1st volume of the \"Ibis,\" says: \"In\r\nthe desert, where neither trees, brush-wood, nor even undulation of the\r\nsurface afford the slightest protection to its foes, a modification of\r\ncolour which shall be assimilated to that of the surrounding country, is\r\nabsolutely necessary. Hence _without exception_ the upper plumage of\r\n_every bird_, whether lark, chat, sylvain, or sand-grouse, and also the\r\nfur of _all the smaller mammals_, and the skin of _all the snakes and\r\nlizards_, is of one uniform isabelline or sand colour.\" After the\r\ntestimony of so able an observer it is unnecessary to adduce further\r\nexamples of the protective colours of desert animals.\r\n\r\nAlmost equally striking are the cases of arctic animals possessing the\r\nwhite colour that best conceals them upon snowfields and icebergs. The\r\npolar bear is the only bear that is white, and it lives constantly among\r\nsnow and ice. The arctic fox, the ermine and the alpine hare change to\r\nwhite in winter only, because in summer white would be more conspicuous\r\nthan any other colour, and therefore a danger rather than a protection;\r\nbut the American polar hare, inhabiting regions of almost perpetual\r\nsnow, is white all the year round. Other animals inhabiting the same\r\nNorthern regions do not, however, change colour. The sable is a good\r\nexample, for throughout the severity of a Siberian winter it retains its\r\nrich brown fur. But its habits are such that it does not need the\r\nprotection of colour, for it is said to be able to subsist on fruits and\r\nberries in winter, and to be so active upon the trees as to catch small\r\nbirds among the branches. So also the woodchuck of Canada has a\r\ndark-brown fur; but then it lives in burrows and frequents river banks,\r\ncatching fish and small animals that live in or near the water.\r\n\r\nAmong birds, the ptarmigan is a fine example of protective colouring.\r\nIts summer plumage so exactly harmonizes with the lichen-coloured stones\r\namong which it delights to sit, that a person may walk through a flock\r\nof them without seeing a single bird; while in winter its white plumage\r\nis an almost equal protection. The snow-bunting, the jer-falcon, and the\r\nsnowy owl are also white-coloured birds inhabiting the arctic regions,\r\nand there can be little doubt but that their colouring is to some extent\r\nprotective.\r\n\r\nNocturnal animals supply us with equally good illustrations. Mice, rats,\r\nbats, and moles possess the least conspicuous of hues, and must be quite\r\ninvisible at times when any light colour would be instantly seen. Owls\r\nand goatsuckers are of those dark mottled tints that will assimilate\r\nwith bark and lichen, and thus protect them during the day, and at the\r\nsame time be inconspicuous in the dusk.\r\n\r\nIt is only in the tropics, among forests which never lose their foliage,\r\nthat we find whole groups of birds whose chief colour is green. The\r\nparrots are the most striking example, but we have also a group of green\r\npigeons in the East; and the barbets, leaf-thrushes, bee-eaters,\r\nwhite-eyes, turacos, and several smaller groups, have so much green in\r\ntheir plumage as to tend greatly to conceal them among the foliage.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Special Modifications of Colour._\r\n\r\nThe conformity of tint which has been so far shown to exist between\r\nanimals and their habitations is of a somewhat general character; we\r\nwill now consider the cases of more special adaptation. If the lion is\r\nenabled by his sandy colour readily to conceal himself by merely\r\ncrouching down upon the desert, how, it may be asked, do the elegant\r\nmarkings of the tiger, the jaguar, and the other large cats agree with\r\nthis theory? We reply that these are generally cases of more or less\r\nspecial adaptation. The tiger is a jungle animal, and hides himself\r\namong tufts of grass or of bamboos, and in these positions the vertical\r\nstripes with which his body is adorned must so assimilate with the\r\nvertical stems of the bamboo, as to assist greatly in concealing him\r\nfrom his approaching prey. How remarkable it is that besides the lion\r\nand tiger, almost all the other large cats are arboreal in their\r\nhabits, and almost all have ocellated or spotted skins, which must\r\ncertainly tend to blend them with the background of foliage; while the\r\none exception, the puma, has an ashy brown uniform fur, and has the\r\nhabit of clinging so closely to a limb of a tree while waiting for his\r\nprey to pass beneath as to be hardly distinguishable from the bark.\r\n\r\nAmong birds, the ptarmigan, already mentioned, must be considered a\r\nremarkable case of special adaptation. Another is a South-American\r\ngoatsucker (Caprimulgus rupestris) which rests in the bright sunshine on\r\nlittle bare rocky islets in the Upper Rio Negro, where its unusually\r\nlight colours so closely resemble those of the rock and sand, that it\r\ncan scarcely be detected till trodden upon.\r\n\r\nThe Duke of Argyll, in his \"Reign of Law,\" has pointed out the admirable\r\nadaptation of the colours of the woodcock to its protection. The various\r\nbrowns and yellows and pale ash-colour that occur in fallen leaves are\r\nall reproduced in its plumage, so that when according to its habit it\r\nrests upon the ground under trees, it is almost impossible to detect it.\r\nIn snipes the colours are modified so as to be equally in harmony with\r\nthe prevalent forms and colours of marshy vegetation. Mr. J. M. Lester,\r\nin a paper read before the Rugby School Natural History Society,\r\nobserves:--\"The wood-dove, when perched amongst the branches of its\r\nfavourite _fir_, is scarcely discernible; whereas, were it among some\r\nlighter foliage, the blue and purple tints in its plumage would far\r\nsooner betray it. The robin redbreast too, although it might be thought\r\nthat the red on its breast made it much easier to be seen, is in reality\r\nnot at all endangered by it, since it generally contrives to get among\r\nsome russet or yellow fading leaves, where the red matches very well\r\nwith the autumn tints, and the brown of the rest of the body with the\r\nbare branches.\"\r\n\r\nReptiles offer us many similar examples. The most arboreal lizards, the\r\niguanas, are as green as the leaves they feed upon, and the slender\r\nwhip-snakes are rendered almost invisible as they glide among the\r\nfoliage by a similar colouration. How difficult it is sometimes to catch\r\nsight of the little green tree-frogs sitting on the leaves of a small\r\nplant enclosed in a glass case in the Zoological Gardens; yet how much\r\nbetter concealed must they be among the fresh green damp foliage of a\r\nmarshy forest. There is a North-American frog found on lichen-covered\r\nrocks and walls, which is so coloured as exactly to resemble them, and\r\nas long as it remains quiet would certainly escape detection. Some of\r\nthe geckos which cling motionless on the trunks of trees in the tropics,\r\nare of such curiously marbled colours as to match exactly with the bark\r\nthey rest upon.\r\n\r\nIn every part of the tropics there are tree-snakes that twist among\r\nboughs and shrubs, or lie coiled up on the dense masses of foliage.\r\nThese are of many distinct groups, and comprise both venomous and\r\nharmless genera; but almost all of them are of a beautiful green\r\ncolour, sometimes more or less adorned with white or dusky bands and\r\nspots. There can be little doubt that this colour is doubly useful to\r\nthem, since it will tend to conceal them from their enemies, and will\r\nlead their prey to approach them unconscious of danger. Dr. Gunther\r\ninforms me that there is only one genus of true arboreal snakes (Dipsas)\r\nwhose colours are rarely green, but are of various shades of black,\r\nbrown, and olive, and these are all nocturnal reptiles, and there can be\r\nlittle doubt conceal themselves during the day in holes, so that the\r\ngreen protective tint would be useless to them, and they accordingly\r\nretain the more usual reptilian hues.\r\n\r\nFishes present similar instances. Many flat fish, as for example the\r\nflounder and the skate, are exactly the colour of the gravel or sand on\r\nwhich they habitually rest. Among the marine flower gardens of an\r\nEastern coral reef the fishes present every variety of gorgeous colour,\r\nwhile the river fish even of the tropics rarely if ever have gay or\r\nconspicuous markings. A very curious case of this kind of adaptation\r\noccurs in the sea-horses (Hippocampus) of Australia, some of which bear\r\nlong foliaceous appendages resembling seaweed, and are of a brilliant\r\nred colour; and they are known to live among seaweed of the same hue, so\r\nthat when at rest they must be quite invisible. There are now in the\r\naquarium of the Zoological Society some slender green pipe-fish which\r\nfasten themselves to any object at the bottom by their prehensile\r\ntails, and float about with the current, looking exactly like some\r\nsimple cylindrical algæ.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, in the insect world that this principle of the\r\nadaptation of animals to their environment is most fully and strikingly\r\ndeveloped. In order to understand how general this is, it is necessary\r\nto enter somewhat into details, as we shall thereby be better able to\r\nappreciate the significance of the still more remarkable phenomena we\r\nshall presently have to discuss. It seems to be in proportion to their\r\nsluggish motions or the absence of other means of defence, that insects\r\npossess the protective colouring. In the tropics there are thousands of\r\nspecies of insects which rest during the day clinging to the bark of\r\ndead or fallen trees; and the greater portion of these are delicately\r\nmottled with gray and brown tints, which though symmetrically disposed\r\nand infinitely varied, yet blend so completely with the usual colours of\r\nthe bark, that at two or three feet distance they are quite\r\nundistinguishable. In some cases a species is known to frequent only one\r\nspecies of tree. This is the case with the common South American\r\nlong-horned beetle (Onychocerus scorpio) which, Mr. Bates informed me,\r\nis found only on a rough-barked tree, called Tapiribá, on the Amazon. It\r\nis very abundant, but so exactly does it resemble the bark in colour and\r\nrugosity, and so closely does it cling to the branches, that until it\r\nmoves it is absolutely invisible! An allied species (O. concentricus)\r\nis found only at Pará, on a distinct species of tree, the bark of which\r\nit resembles with equal accuracy. Both these insects are abundant, and\r\nwe may fairly conclude that the protection they derive from this strange\r\nconcealment is at least one of the causes that enable the race to\r\nflourish.\r\n\r\nMany of the species of Cicindela, or tiger beetle, will illustrate this\r\nmode of protection. Our common Cicindela campestris frequents grassy\r\nbanks, and is of a beautiful green colour, while C. maritima, which is\r\nfound only on sandy sea-shores, is of a pale bronzy yellow, so as to be\r\nalmost invisible. A great number of the species found by myself in the\r\nMalay islands are similarly protected. The beautiful Cicindela gloriosa,\r\nof a very deep velvety green colour, was only taken upon wet mossy\r\nstones in the bed of a mountain stream, where it was with the greatest\r\ndifficulty detected. A large brown species (C. heros) was found chiefly\r\non dead leaves in forest paths; and one which was never seen except on\r\nthe wet mud of salt marshes was of a glossy olive so exactly the colour\r\nof the mud as only to be distinguished when the sun shone, by its\r\nshadow! Where the sandy beach was coralline and nearly white, I found a\r\nvery pale Cicindela; wherever it was volcanic and black, a dark species\r\nof the same genus was sure to be met with.\r\n\r\nThere are in the East small beetles of the family Buprestidæ which\r\ngenerally rest on the midrib of a leaf, and the naturalist often\r\nhesitates before picking them off, so closely do they resemble pieces of\r\nbird's dung. Kirby and Spence mention the small beetle Onthophilus\r\nsulcatus as being like the seed of an umbelliferous plant; and another\r\nsmall weevil, which is much persecuted by predatory beetles of the genus\r\nHarpalus, is of the exact colour of loamy soil, and was found to be\r\nparticularly abundant in loam pits. Mr. Bates mentions a small beetle\r\n(Chlamys pilula) which was undistinguishable by the eye from the dung of\r\ncaterpillars, while some of the Cassidæ, from their hemispherical forms\r\nand pearly gold colour, resemble glittering dew-drops upon the leaves.\r\n\r\nA number of our small brown and speckled weevils at the approach of any\r\nobject roll off the leaf they are sitting on, at the same time drawing\r\nin their legs and antennæ, which fit so perfectly into cavities for\r\ntheir reception that the insect becomes a mere oval brownish lump, which\r\nit is hopeless to look for among the similarly coloured little stones\r\nand earth pellets among which it lies motionless.\r\n\r\nThe distribution of colour in butterflies and moths respectively is very\r\ninstructive from this point of view. The former have all their brilliant\r\ncolouring on the upper surface of all four wings, while the under\r\nsurface is almost always soberly coloured, and often very dark and\r\nobscure. The moths on the contrary have generally their chief colour on\r\nthe hind wings only, the upper wings being of dull, sombre, and often\r\nimitative tints, and these generally conceal the hind wings when the\r\ninsects are in repose. This arrangement of the colours is therefore\r\neminently protective, because the butterfly always rests with his wings\r\nraised so as to conceal the dangerous brilliancy of his upper surface.\r\nIt is probable that if we watched their habits sufficiently we should\r\nfind the under surface of the wings of butterflies very frequently\r\nimitative and protective. Mr. T. W. Wood has pointed out that the little\r\norange-tip butterfly often rests in the evening on the green and white\r\nflower heads of an umbelliferous plant, and that when observed in this\r\nposition the beautiful green and white mottling of the under surface\r\ncompletely assimilates with the flower heads and renders the creature\r\nvery difficult to be seen. It is probable that the rich dark colouring\r\nof the under side of our peacock, tortoiseshell, and red-admiral\r\nbutterflies answers a similar purpose.\r\n\r\nTwo curious South American butterflies that always settle on the trunks\r\nof trees (Gynecia dirce and Callizona acesta) have the under surface\r\ncuriously striped and mottled, and when viewed obliquely must closely\r\nassimilate with the appearance of the furrowed bark of many kinds of\r\ntrees. But the most wonderful and undoubted case of protective\r\nresemblance in a butterfly which I have ever seen, is that of the common\r\nIndian Kallima inachis, and its Malayan ally, Kallima paralekta. The\r\nupper surface of these insects is very striking and showy, as they are\r\nof a large size, and are adorned with a broad band of rich orange on a\r\ndeep bluish ground. The under side is very variable in colour, so that\r\nout of fifty specimens no two can be found exactly alike, but every one\r\nof them will be of some shade of ash or brown or ochre, such as are\r\nfound among dead, dry, or decaying leaves. The apex of the upper wings\r\nis produced into an acute point, a very common form in the leaves of\r\ntropical shrubs and trees, and the lower wings are also produced into a\r\nshort narrow tail. Between these two points runs a dark curved line\r\nexactly representing the midrib of a leaf, and from this radiate on each\r\nside a few oblique lines, which serve to indicate the lateral veins of a\r\nleaf. These marks are more clearly seen on the outer portion of the base\r\nof the wings, and on the inner side towards the middle and apex, and it\r\nis very curious to observe how the usual marginal and transverse striæ\r\nof the group are here modified and strengthened so as to become adapted\r\nfor an imitation of the venation of a leaf. We come now to a still more\r\nextraordinary part of the imitation, for we find representations of\r\nleaves in every stage of decay, variously blotched and mildewed and\r\npierced with holes, and in many cases irregularly covered with powdery\r\nblack dots gathered into patches and spots, so closely resembling the\r\nvarious kinds of minute fungi that grow on dead leaves that it is\r\nimpossible to avoid thinking at first sight that the butterflies\r\nthemselves have been attacked by real fungi.\r\n\r\nBut this resemblance, close as it is, would be of little use if the\r\nhabits of the insect did not accord with it. If the butterfly sat upon\r\nleaves or upon flowers, or opened its wings so as to expose the upper\r\nsurface, or exposed and moved its head and antennæ as many other\r\nbutterflies do, its disguise would be of little avail. We might be sure,\r\nhowever, from the analogy of many other cases, that the habits of the\r\ninsect are such as still further to aid its deceptive garb; but we are\r\nnot obliged to make any such supposition, since I myself had the good\r\nfortune to observe scores of Kallima paralekta, in Sumatra, and to\r\ncapture many of them, and can vouch for the accuracy of the following\r\ndetails. These butterflies frequent dry forests and fly very swiftly.\r\nThey were never seen to settle on a flower or a green leaf, but were\r\nmany times lost sight of in a bush or tree of dead leaves. On such\r\noccasions they were generally searched for in vain, for while gazing\r\nintently at the very spot where one had disappeared, it would often\r\nsuddenly dart out, and again vanish twenty or fifty yards further on. On\r\none or two occasions the insect was detected reposing, and it could then\r\nbe seen how completely it assimilates itself to the surrounding leaves.\r\nIt sits on a nearly upright twig, the wings fitting closely back to\r\nback, concealing the antennæ and head, which are drawn up between their\r\nbases. The little tails of the hind wing touch the branch, and form a\r\nperfect stalk to the leaf, which is supported in its place by the claws\r\nof the middle pair of feet, which are slender and inconspicuous. The\r\nirregular outline of the wings gives exactly the perspective effect of a\r\nshrivelled leaf. We thus have size, colour, form, markings, and habits,\r\nall combining together to produce a disguise which may be said to be\r\nabsolutely perfect; and the protection which it affords is sufficiently\r\nindicated by the abundance of the individuals that possess it.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Joseph Greene has called attention to the striking harmony\r\nbetween the colours of those British moths which are on the wing in\r\nautumn and winter, and the prevailing tints of nature at those seasons.\r\nIn autumn various shades of yellow and brown prevail, and he shows that\r\nout of fifty-two species that fly at this season, no less than forty-two\r\nare of corresponding colours. Orgyia antiqua, O. gonostigma, the genera\r\nXanthia, Glæa, and Ennomos are examples. In winter, gray and silvery\r\ntints prevail, and the genus Chematobia and several species of Hybernia\r\nwhich fly during this season are of corresponding hues. No doubt if the\r\nhabits of moths in a state of nature were more closely observed, we\r\nshould find many cases of special protective resemblance. A few such\r\nhave already been noticed. Agriopis aprilina, Acronycta psi, and many\r\nother moths which rest during the day on the north side of the trunks of\r\ntrees can with difficulty be distinguished from the grey and green\r\nlichens that cover them. The lappet moth (Gastropacha querci) closely\r\nresembles both in shape and colour a brown dry leaf; and the well-known\r\nbuff-tip moth, when at rest is like the broken end of a lichen-covered\r\nbranch. There are some of the small moths which exactly resemble the\r\ndung of birds dropped on leaves, and on this point Mr. A. Sidgwick, in a\r\npaper read before the Rugby School Natural History Society, gives the\r\nfollowing original observation:--\"I myself have more than once mistaken\r\nCilix compressa, a little white and grey moth, for a piece of bird's\r\ndung dropped upon a leaf, and _vice versâ_ the dung for the moth.\r\nBryophila Glandifera and Perla are the very image of the mortar walls on\r\nwhich they rest; and only this summer, in Switzerland, I amused myself\r\nfor some time in watching a moth, probably Larentia tripunctaria,\r\nfluttering about quite close to me, and then alighting on a wall of the\r\nstone of the district which it so exactly matched as to be quite\r\ninvisible a couple of yards off.\" There are probably hosts of these\r\nresemblances which have not been observed, owing to the difficulty of\r\nfinding many of the species in their stations of natural repose.\r\nCaterpillars are also similarly protected. Many exactly resemble in tint\r\nthe leaves they feed upon; others are like little brown twigs, and many\r\nare so strangely marked or humped, that when motionless they can hardly\r\nbe taken to be living creatures at all. Mr. Andrew Murray has remarked\r\nhow closely the larva of the peacock moth (Saturnia pavonia-minor)\r\nharmonizes in its ground colour with that of the young buds of heather\r\non which it feeds, and that the pink spots with which it is decorated\r\ncorrespond with the flowers and flower-buds of the same plant.\r\n\r\nThe whole order of Orthoptera, grasshoppers, locusts, crickets, &c., are\r\nprotected by their colours harmonizing with that of the vegetation or\r\nthe soil on which they live, and in no other group have we such striking\r\nexamples of special resemblance. Most of the tropical Mantidæ and\r\nLocustidæ are of the exact tint of the leaves on which they habitually\r\nrepose, and many of them in addition have the veinings of their wings\r\nmodified so as exactly to imitate that of a leaf. This is carried to the\r\nfurthest possible extent in the wonderful genus, Phyllium, the \"walking\r\nleaf,\" in which not only are the wings perfect imitations of leaves in\r\nevery detail, but the thorax and legs are flat, dilated, and leaf-like;\r\nso that when tho living insect is resting among the foliage on which it\r\nfeeds, the closest observation is often unable to distinguish between\r\nthe animal and the vegetable.\r\n\r\nThe whole family of the Phasmidæ, or spectres, to which this insect\r\nbelongs, is more or less imitative, and a great number of the species\r\nare called \"walking-stick insects,\" from their singular resemblance to\r\ntwigs and branches. Some of these are a foot long and as thick as one's\r\nfinger, and their whole colouring, form, rugosity, and the arrangement\r\nof the head, legs, and antennæ, are such as to render them absolutely\r\nidentical in appearance with dead sticks. They hang loosely about shrubs\r\nin the forest, and have the extraordinary habit of stretching out their\r\nlegs unsymmetrically, so as to render the deception more complete. One\r\nof these creatures obtained by myself in Borneo (Ceroxylus laceratus)\r\nwas covered over with foliaceous excrescences of a clear olive green\r\ncolour, so as exactly to resemble a stick grown over by a creeping moss\r\nor jungermannia. The Dyak who brought it me assured me it was grown over\r\nwith moss although alive, and it was only after a most minute\r\nexamination that I could convince myself it was not so.\r\n\r\nWe need not adduce any more examples to show how important are the\r\ndetails of form and of colouring in animals, and that their very\r\nexistence may often depend upon their being by these means concealed\r\nfrom their enemies. This kind of protection is found apparently in every\r\nclass and order, for it has been noticed wherever we can obtain\r\nsufficient knowledge of the details of an animal's life-history. It\r\nvaries in degree, from the mere absence of conspicuous colour or a\r\ngeneral harmony with the prevailing tints of nature, up to such a minute\r\nand detailed resemblance to inorganic or vegetable structures as to\r\nrealize the talisman of the fairy tale, and to give its possessor the\r\npower of rendering itself invisible.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Theory of Protective Colouring._\r\n\r\nWe will now endeavour to show how these wonderful resemblances have most\r\nprobably been brought about. Returning to the higher animals, let us\r\nconsider the remarkable fact of the rarity of white colouring in the\r\nmammalia or birds of the temperate or tropical zones in a state of\r\nnature. There is not a single white land-bird or quadruped in Europe,\r\nexcept the few arctic or alpine species, to which white is a protective\r\ncolour. Yet in many of these creatures there seems to be no inherent\r\ntendency to avoid white, for directly they are domesticated white\r\nvarieties arise, and appear to thrive as well as others. We have white\r\nmice and rats, white cats, horses, dogs, and cattle, white poultry,\r\npigeons, turkeys, and ducks, and white rabbits. Some of these animals\r\nhave been domesticated for a long period, others only for a few\r\ncenturies; but in almost every case in which an animal has been\r\nthoroughly domesticated, parti-coloured and white varieties are produced\r\nand become permanent.\r\n\r\nIt is also well known that animals in a state of nature produce white\r\nvarieties occasionally. Blackbirds, starlings, and crows are\r\noccasionally seen white, as well as elephants, deer, tigers, hares,\r\nmoles, and many other animals; but in no case is a permanent white race\r\nproduced. Now there are no statistics to show that the normal-coloured\r\nparents produce white offspring oftener under domestication than in a\r\nstate of nature, and we have no right to make such an assumption if the\r\nfacts can be accounted for without it. But if the colours of animals do\r\nreally, in the various instances already adduced, serve for their\r\nconcealment and preservation, then white or any other conspicuous colour\r\nmust be hurtful, and must in most cases shorten an animal's life. A\r\nwhite rabbit would be more surely the prey of hawk or buzzard, and the\r\nwhite mole, or field mouse, could not long escape from the vigilant owl.\r\nSo, also, any deviation from those tints best adapted to conceal a\r\ncarnivorous animal would render the pursuit of its prey much more\r\ndifficult, would place it at a disadvantage among its fellows, and in a\r\ntime of scarcity would probably cause it to starve to death. On the\r\nother hand, if an animal spreads from a temperate into an arctic\r\ndistrict, the conditions are changed. During a large portion of the\r\nyear, and just when the struggle for existence is most severe, white is\r\nthe prevailing tint of nature, and dark colours will be the most\r\nconspicuous. The white varieties will now have an advantage; they will\r\nescape from their enemies or will secure food, while their brown\r\ncompanions will be devoured or will starve; and as \"like produces like\"\r\nis the established rule in nature, the white race will become\r\npermanently established, and dark varieties, when they occasionally\r\nappear, will soon die out from their want of adaptation to their\r\nenvironment. In each case the fittest will survive, and a race will be\r\neventually produced adapted to the conditions in which it lives.\r\n\r\nWe have here an illustration of the simple and effectual means by which\r\nanimals are brought into harmony with the rest of nature. That slight\r\namount of variability in every species, which we often look upon as\r\nsomething accidental or abnormal, or so insignificant as to be hardly\r\nworthy of notice, is yet the foundation of all those wonderful and\r\nharmonious resemblances which play such an important part in the economy\r\nof nature. Variation is generally very small in amount, but it is all\r\nthat is required, because the change in the external conditions to which\r\nan animal is subject is generally very slow and intermittent. When these\r\nchanges have taken place too rapidly, the result has often been the\r\nextinction of species; but the general rule is, that climatal and\r\ngeological changes go on slowly, and the slight but continual\r\nvariations in the colour, form, and structure of all animals, has\r\nfurnished individuals adapted to these changes, and who have become the\r\nprogenitors of modified races. Rapid multiplication, incessant slight\r\nvariation, and survival of the fittest--these are the laws which ever\r\nkeep the organic world in harmony with the inorganic, and with itself.\r\nThese are the laws which we believe have produced all the cases of\r\nprotective resemblance already adduced, as well as those still more\r\ncurious examples we have yet to bring before our readers.\r\n\r\nIt must always be borne in mind that the more wonderful examples, in\r\nwhich there is not only a general but a special resemblance--as in the\r\nwalking leaf, the mossy phasma, and the leaf-winged butterfly--represent\r\nthose few instances in which the process of modification has been going\r\non during an immense series of generations. They all occur in the\r\ntropics, where the conditions of existence are the most favourable, and\r\nwhere climatic changes have for long periods been hardly perceptible. In\r\nmost of them favourable variations both of colour, form, structure, and\r\ninstinct or habit, must have occurred to produce the perfect adaptation\r\nwe now behold. All these are known to vary, and favourable variations\r\nwhen not accompanied by others that were unfavourable, would certainly\r\nsurvive. At one time a little step might be made in this direction, at\r\nanother time in that--a change of conditions might sometimes render\r\nuseless that which it had taken ages to produce--great and sudden\r\nphysical modifications might often produce the extinction of a race\r\njust as it was approaching perfection, and a hundred checks of which we\r\ncan know nothing may have retarded the progress towards perfect\r\nadaptation; so that we can hardly wonder at there being so few cases in\r\nwhich a completely successful result has been attained as shown by the\r\nabundance and wide diffusion of the creatures so protected.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Objection that Colour, as being dangerous, should not exist in Nature._\r\n\r\nIt is as well here to reply to an objection that will no doubt occur to\r\nmany readers--that if protection is so useful to all animals, and so\r\neasily brought about by variation and survival of the fittest, there\r\nought to be no conspicuously-coloured creatures; and they will perhaps\r\nask how we account for the brilliant birds, and painted snakes, and\r\ngorgeous insects, that occur abundantly all over the world. It will be\r\nadvisable to answer this question rather fully, in order that we may be\r\nprepared to understand the phenomena of \"mimicry,\" which it is the\r\nspecial object of this paper to illustrate and explain.\r\n\r\nThe slightest observation of the life of animals will show us, that they\r\nescape from their enemies and obtain their food in an infinite number of\r\nways; and that their varied habits and instincts are in every case\r\nadapted to the conditions of their existence. The porcupine and the\r\nhedgehog have a defensive armour that saves them from the attacks of\r\nmost animals. The tortoise is not injured by the conspicuous colours of\r\nhis shell, because that shell is in most cases an effectual protection\r\nto him. The skunks of North America find safety in their power of\r\nemitting an unbearably offensive odour; the beaver in its aquatic habits\r\nand solidly constructed abode. In some cases the chief danger to an\r\nanimal occurs at one particular period of its existence, and if that is\r\nguarded against its numbers can easily be maintained. This is the case\r\nwith many birds, the eggs and young of which are especially obnoxious to\r\ndanger, and we find accordingly a variety of curious contrivances to\r\nprotect them. We have nests carefully concealed, hung from the slender\r\nextremities of grass or boughs over water, or placed in the hollow of a\r\ntree with a very small opening. When these precautions are successful,\r\nso many more individuals will be reared than can possibly find food\r\nduring the least favourable seasons, that there will always be a number\r\nof weakly and inexperienced young birds who will fall a prey to the\r\nenemies of the race, and thus render necessary for the stronger and\r\nhealthier individuals no other safeguard than their strength and\r\nactivity. The instincts most favourable to the production and rearing of\r\noffspring will in these cases be most important, and the survival of the\r\nfittest will act so as to keep up and advance those instincts, while\r\nother causes which tend to modify colour and marking may continue their\r\naction almost unchecked.\r\n\r\nIt is perhaps in insects that we may best study the varied means by\r\nwhich animals are defended or concealed. One of the uses of the\r\nphosphorescence with which many insects are furnished, is probably to\r\nfrighten away their enemies; for Kirby and Spence state that a ground\r\nbeetle (Carabus) has been observed running round and round a luminous\r\ncentipede as if afraid to attack it. An immense number of insects have\r\nstings, and some stingless ants of the genus Polyrachis are armed with\r\nstrong and sharp spines on the back, which must render them unpalatable\r\nto many of the smaller insectivorous birds. Many beetles of the family\r\nCurculionidæ have the wing cases and other external parts so excessively\r\nhard, that they cannot be pinned without first drilling a hole to\r\nreceive the pin, and it is probable that all such find a protection in\r\nthis excessive hardness. Great numbers of insects hide themselves among\r\nthe petals of flowers, or in the cracks of bark and timber; and finally,\r\nextensive groups and even whole orders have a more or less powerful and\r\ndisgusting smell and taste, which they either possess permanently, or\r\ncan emit at pleasure. The attitudes of some insects may also protect\r\nthem, as the habit of turning up the tail by the harmless rove-beetles\r\n(Staphylindidæ) no doubt leads other animals besides children to the\r\nbelief that they can sting. The curious attitude assumed by sphinx\r\ncaterpillars is probably a safeguard, as well as the blood-red tentacles\r\nwhich can suddenly be thrown out from the neck, by the caterpillars of\r\nall the true swallow-tailed butterflies.\r\n\r\nIt is among the groups that possess some of these varied kinds of\r\nprotection in a high degree, that we find the greatest amount of\r\nconspicuous colour, or at least the most complete absence of protective\r\nimitation. The stinging Hymenoptera, wasps, bees, and hornets, are, as a\r\nrule, very showy and brilliant insects, and there is not a single\r\ninstance recorded in which any one of them is coloured so as to resemble\r\na vegetable or inanimate substance. The Chrysididæ, or golden wasps,\r\nwhich do not sting, possess as a substitute the power of rolling\r\nthemselves up into a ball, which is almost as hard and polished as if\r\nreally made of metal,--and they are all adorned with the most gorgeous\r\ncolours. The whole order Hemiptera (comprising the bugs) emit a powerful\r\nodour, and they present a very large proportion of gay-coloured and\r\nconspicuous insects. The lady-birds (Coccinellidæ) and their allies the\r\nEumorphidæ, are often brightly spotted, as if to attract attention; but\r\nthey can both emit fluids of a very disagreeable nature, they are\r\ncertainly rejected by some birds, and are probably never eaten by any.\r\n\r\nThe great family of ground beetles (Carabidæ) almost all possess a\r\ndisagreeable and some a very pungent smell, and a few, called bombardier\r\nbeetles, have the peculiar faculty of emitting a jet of very volatile\r\nliquid, which appears like a puff of smoke, and is accompanied by a\r\ndistinct crepitating explosion. It is probably because these insects are\r\nmostly nocturnal and predacious that they do not present more vivid\r\nhues. They are chiefly remarkable for brilliant metallic tints or dull\r\nred patches when they are not wholly black, and are therefore very\r\nconspicuous by day, when insect-eaters are kept off by their bad odour\r\nand taste, but are sufficiently invisible at night when it is of\r\nimportance that their prey should not become aware of their proximity.\r\n\r\nIt seems probable that in some cases that which would appear at first to\r\nbe a source of danger to its possessor may really be a means of\r\nprotection. Many showy and weak-flying butterflies have a very broad\r\nexpanse of wing, as in the brilliant blue Morphos of Brazilian forests,\r\nand the large Eastern Papilios; yet these groups are tolerably\r\nplentiful. Now, specimens of these butterflies are often captured with\r\npierced and broken wings, as if they had been seized by birds from whom\r\nthey had escaped; but if the wings had been much smaller in proportion\r\nto the body, it seems probable that the insect would be more frequently\r\nstruck or pierced in a vital part, and thus the increased expanse of the\r\nwings may have been indirectly beneficial.\r\n\r\nIn other cases the capacity of increase in a species is so great that\r\nhowever many of the perfect insect may be destroyed, there is always\r\nample means for the continuance of the race. Many of the flesh flies,\r\ngnats, ants, palm-tree weevils and locusts are in this category. The\r\nwhole family of Cetoniadæ or rose chafers, so full of gaily-coloured\r\nspecies, are probably saved from attack by a combination of characters.\r\nThey fly very rapidly with a zigzag or waving course; they hide\r\nthemselves the moment they alight, either in the corolla of flowers, or\r\nin rotten wood, or in cracks and hollows of trees, and they are\r\ngenerally encased in a very hard and polished coat of mail which may\r\nrender them unsatisfactory food to such birds as would be able to\r\ncapture them. The causes which lead to the development of colour have\r\nbeen here able to act unchecked, and we see the result in a large\r\nvariety of the most gorgeously-coloured insects.\r\n\r\nHere, then, with our very imperfect knowledge of the life-history of\r\nanimals, we are able to see that there are widely varied modes by which\r\nthey may obtain protection from their enemies or concealment from their\r\nprey. Some of those seem to be so complete and effectual as to answer\r\nall the wants of the race, and lead to the maintenance of the largest\r\npossible population. When this is the case, we can well understand that\r\nno further protection derived from a modification of colour can be of\r\nthe slightest use, and the most brilliant hues may be developed without\r\nany prejudicial effect upon the species. On some of the laws that\r\ndetermine the development of colour something may be said presently. It\r\nis now merely necessary to show that concealment by obscure or imitative\r\ntints is only one out of very many ways by which animals maintain their\r\nexistence; and having done this we are prepared to consider the\r\nphenomena of what has been termed \"mimicry.\" It is to be particularly\r\nobserved, however, that the word is not here used in the sense of\r\nvoluntary imitation, but to imply a particular kind of resemblance--a\r\nresemblance not in internal structure but in external appearance--a\r\nresemblance in those parts only that catch the eye--a resemblance that\r\ndeceives. As this kind of resemblance has the same effect as voluntary\r\nimitation or mimicry, and as we have no word that expresses the required\r\nmeaning, \"mimicry\" was adopted by Mr. Bates (who was the first to\r\nexplain the facts), and has led to some misunderstanding; but there need\r\nbe none, if it is remembered that both \"mimicry\" and \"imitation\" are\r\nused in a metaphorical sense, as implying that close external likeness\r\nwhich causes things unlike in structure to be mistaken for each other.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mimicry._\r\n\r\nIt has been long known to entomologists that certain insects bear a\r\nstrange external resemblance to others belonging to distinct genera,\r\nfamilies, or even orders, and with which they have no real affinity\r\nwhatever. The fact, however, appears to have been generally considered\r\nas dependent upon some unknown law of \"analogy\"--some \"system of\r\nnature,\" or \"general plan,\" which had guided the Creator in designing\r\nthe myriads of insect forms, and which we could never hope to\r\nunderstand. In only one case does it appear that the resemblance was\r\nthought to be useful, and to have been designed as a means to a definite\r\nand intelligible purpose. The flies of the genus Volucella enter the\r\nnests of bees to deposit their eggs, so that their larvæ may feed upon\r\nthe larvæ of the bees, and these flies are each wonderfully like the bee\r\non which it is parasitic. Kirby and Spence believed that this\r\nresemblance or \"mimicry\" was for the express purpose of protecting the\r\nflies from the attacks of the bees, and the connection is so evident\r\nthat it was hardly possible to avoid this conclusion. The resemblance,\r\nhowever, of moths to butterflies or to bees, of beetles to wasps, and of\r\nlocusts to beetles, has been many times noticed by eminent writers; but\r\nscarcely ever till within the last few years does it appear to have been\r\nconsidered that these resemblances had any special purpose, or were of\r\nany direct benefit to the insects themselves. In this respect they were\r\nlooked upon as accidental, as instances of the \"curious analogies\" in\r\nnature which must be wondered at but which could not be explained.\r\nRecently, however, these instances have been greatly multiplied; the\r\nnature of the resemblances has been more carefully studied, and it has\r\nbeen found that they are often carried out into such details as almost\r\nto imply a purpose of deceiving the observer. The phenomena, moreover,\r\nhave been shown to follow certain definite laws, which again all\r\nindicate their dependence on the more general law of the \"survival of\r\nthe fittest,\" or \"the preservation of favoured races in the struggle for\r\nlife.\" It will, perhaps, be as well here to state what these laws or\r\ngeneral conclusions are, and then to give some account of the facts\r\nwhich support them.\r\n\r\nThe first law is, that in an overwhelming majority of cases of mimicry,\r\nthe animals (or the groups) which resemble each other inhabit the same\r\ncountry, the same district, and in most cases are to be found together\r\non the very same spot.\r\n\r\nThe second law is, that these resemblances are not indiscriminate, but\r\nare limited to certain groups, which in every case are abundant in\r\nspecies and individuals, and can often be ascertained to have some\r\nspecial protection.\r\n\r\nThe third law is, that the species which resemble or \"mimic\" these\r\ndominant groups, are comparatively less abundant in individuals, and are\r\noften very rare.\r\n\r\nThese laws will be found to hold good, in all the cases of true mimicry\r\namong various classes of animals to which we have now to call the\r\nattention of our readers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mimicry among Lepidoptera._\r\n\r\nAs it is among butterflies that instances of mimicry are most numerous\r\nand most striking, an account of some of the more prominent examples in\r\nthis group will first be given. There is in South America an extensive\r\nfamily of these insects, the Heliconidæ, which are in many respects very\r\nremarkable. They are so abundant and characteristic in all the woody\r\nportions of the American tropics, that in almost every locality they\r\nwill be seen more frequently than any other butterflies. They are\r\ndistinguished by very elongate wings, body, and antennæ, and are\r\nexceedingly beautiful and varied in their colours; spots and patches of\r\nyellow, red, or pure white upon a black, blue, or brown ground, being\r\nmost general. They frequent the forests chiefly, and all fly slowly and\r\nweakly; yet although they are so conspicuous, and could certainly be\r\ncaught by insectivorous birds more easily than almost any other\r\ninsects, their great abundance all over the wide region they inhabit\r\nshows that they are not so persecuted. It is to be especially remarked\r\nalso, that they possess no adaptive colouring to protect them during\r\nrepose, for the under side of their wings presents the same, or at least\r\nan equally conspicuous colouring as the upper side; and they may be\r\nobserved after sunset suspended at the end of twigs and leaves where\r\nthey have taken up their station for the night, fully exposed to the\r\nattacks of enemies if they have any. These beautiful insects possess,\r\nhowever, a strong pungent semi-aromatic or medicinal odour, which seems\r\nto pervade all the juices of their system. When the entomologist\r\nsqueezes the breast of one of them between his fingers to kill it, a\r\nyellow liquid exudes which stains the skin, and the smell of which can\r\nonly be got rid of by time and repeated washings. Here we have probably\r\nthe cause of their immunity from attack, since there is a great deal of\r\nevidence to show that certain insects are so disgusting to birds that\r\nthey will under no circumstances touch them. Mr. Stainton has observed\r\nthat a brood of young turkeys greedily devoured all the worthless moths\r\nhe had amassed in a night's \"sugaring,\" yet one after another seized and\r\nrejected a single white moth which happened to be among them. Young\r\npheasants and partridges which eat many kinds of caterpillars seem to\r\nhave an absolute dread of that of the common currant moth, which they\r\nwill never touch, and tomtits as well as other small birds appear never\r\nto eat the same species. In the case of the Heliconidæ, however, we\r\nhave some direct evidence to the same effect. In the Brazilian forests\r\nthere are great numbers of insectivorous birds--as jacamars, trogons,\r\nand puffbirds--which catch insects on the wing, and that they destroy\r\nmany butterflies is indicated by the fact that the wings of these\r\ninsects are often found on the ground where their bodies have been\r\ndevoured. But among these there are no wings of Heliconidæ, while those\r\nof the large showy Nymphalidæ, which have a much swifter flight, are\r\noften met with. Again, a gentleman who had recently returned from Brazil\r\nstated at a meeting of the Entomological Society that he once observed a\r\npair of puffbirds catching butterflies, which they brought to their nest\r\nto feed their young; yet during half an hour they never brought one of\r\nthe Heliconidæ, which were flying lazily about in great numbers, and\r\nwhich they could have captured more easily than any others. It was this\r\ncircumstance that led Mr. Belt to observe them so long, as he could not\r\nunderstand why the most common insects should be altogether passed by.\r\nMr. Bates also tells us that he never saw them molested by lizards or\r\npredacious flies, which often pounce on other butterflies.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, we accept it as highly probable (if not proved) that the\r\nHeliconidæ are very greatly protected from attack by their peculiar\r\nodour and taste, we find it much more easy to understand their chief\r\ncharacteristics--their great abundance, their slow flight, their gaudy\r\ncolours, and the entire absence of protective tints on their under\r\nsurfaces. This property places them somewhat in the position of those\r\ncurious wingless birds of oceanic islands, the dodo, the apteryx, and\r\nthe moas, which are with great reason supposed to have lost the power of\r\nflight on account of the absence of carnivorous quadrupeds. Our\r\nbutterflies have been protected in a different way, but quite as\r\neffectually; and the result has been that as there has been nothing to\r\nescape from, there has been no weeding out of slow flyers, and as there\r\nhas been nothing to hide from, there has been no extermination of the\r\nbright-coloured varieties, and no preservation of such as tended to\r\nassimilate with surrounding objects.\r\n\r\nNow let us consider how this kind of protection must act. Tropical\r\ninsectivorous birds very frequently sit on dead branches of a lofty\r\ntree, or on those which overhang forest paths, gazing intently around,\r\nand darting off at intervals to seize an insect at a considerable\r\ndistance, which they generally return to their station to devour. If a\r\nbird began by capturing the slow-flying, conspicuous Heliconidæ, and\r\nfound them always so disagreeable that it could not eat them, it would\r\nafter a very few trials leave off catching them at all; and their whole\r\nappearance, form, colouring, and mode of flight is so peculiar, that\r\nthere can be little doubt birds would soon learn to distinguish them at\r\na long distance, and never waste any time in pursuit of them. Under\r\nthese circumstances, it is evident that any other butterfly of a group\r\nwhich birds were accustomed to devour, would be almost equally well\r\nprotected by closely resembling a Heliconia externally, as if it\r\nacquired also the disagreeable odour; always supposing that there were\r\nonly a few of them among a great number of the Heliconias. If the birds\r\ncould not distinguish the two kinds externally, and there were on the\r\naverage only one eatable among fifty uneatable, they would soon give up\r\nseeking for the eatable ones, even if they knew them to exist. If, on\r\nthe other hand, any particular butterfly of an eatable group acquired\r\nthe disagreeable taste of the Heliconias while it retained the\r\ncharacteristic form and colouring of its own group, this would be really\r\nof no use to it whatever; for the birds would go on catching it among\r\nits eatable allies (compared with which it would rarely occur), it would\r\nbe wounded and disabled, even if rejected, and its increase would thus\r\nbe as effectually checked as if it were devoured. It is important,\r\ntherefore, to understand that if any one genus of an extensive family of\r\neatable butterflies were in danger of extermination from insect-eating\r\nbirds, and if two kinds of variation were going on among them, some\r\nindividuals possessing a slightly disagreeable taste, others a slight\r\nresemblance to the Heliconidæ, this latter quality would be much more\r\nvaluable than the former. The change in flavour would not at all prevent\r\nthe variety from being captured as before, and it would almost certainly\r\nbe thoroughly disabled before being rejected. The approach in colour and\r\nform to the Heliconidæ, however, would be at the very first a positive,\r\nthough perhaps a slight advantage; for although at short distances this\r\nvariety would be easily distinguished and devoured, yet at a longer\r\ndistance it might be mistaken for one of the uneatable group, and so be\r\npassed by and gain another day's life, which might in many cases be\r\nsufficient for it to lay a quantity of eggs and leave a numerous\r\nprogeny, many of which would inherit the peculiarity which had been the\r\nsafeguard of their parent.\r\n\r\nNow, this hypothetical case is exactly realized in South America. Among\r\nthe white butterflies forming the family Pieridæ (many of which do not\r\ngreatly differ in appearance from our own cabbage butterflies) is a\r\ngenus of rather small size (Leptalis), some species of which are white\r\nlike their allies, while the larger number exactly resemble the\r\nHeliconidæ in the form and colouring of the wings. It must always be\r\nremembered that these two families are as absolutely distinguished from\r\neach other by structural characters as are the carnivora and the\r\nruminants among quadrupeds, and that an entomologist can always\r\ndistinguish the one from the other by the structure of the feet, just as\r\ncertainly as a zoologist can tell a bear from a buffalo by the skull or\r\nby a tooth. Yet the resemblance of a species of the one family to\r\nanother species in the other family was often so great, that both Mr.\r\nBates and myself were many times deceived at the time of capture, and\r\ndid not discover the distinctness of the two insects till a closer\r\nexamination detected their essential differences. During his residence\r\nof eleven years in the Amazon valley, Mr. Bates found a number of\r\nspecies or varieties of Leptalis, each of which was a more or less exact\r\ncopy of one of the Heliconidæ of the district it inhabited; and the\r\nresults of his observations are embodied in a paper published in the\r\nLinnean Transactions, in which he first explained the phenomena of\r\n\"mimicry\" as the result of natural selection, and showed its identity in\r\ncause and purpose with protective resemblance to vegetable or inorganic\r\nforms.\r\n\r\nThe imitation of the Heliconidæ by the Leptalides is carried out to a\r\nwonderful degree in form as well as in colouring. The wings have become\r\nelongated to the same extent, and the antennæ and abdomen have both\r\nbecome lengthened, to correspond with the unusual condition in which\r\nthey exist in the former family. In colouration there are several types\r\nin the different genera of Heliconidæ. The genus Mechanitis is generally\r\nof a rich semi-transparent brown, banded with black and yellow; Methona\r\nis of large size, the wings transparent like horn, and with black\r\ntransverse bands; while the delicate Ithomias are all more or less\r\ntransparent, with black veins and borders, and often with marginal and\r\ntransverse bands of orange red. These different forms are all copied by\r\nthe various species of Leptalis, every band and spot and tint of colour,\r\nand the various degrees of transparency, being exactly reproduced. As if\r\nto derive all the benefit possible from this protective mimicry, the\r\nhabits have become so modified that the Leptalides generally frequent\r\nthe very same spots as their models, and have the same mode of flight;\r\nand as they are always very scarce (Mr. Bates estimating their numbers\r\nat about one to a thousand of the group they resemble), there is hardly\r\na possibility of their being found out by their enemies. It is also\r\nvery remarkable that in almost every case the particular Ithomias and\r\nother species of Heliconidæ which they resemble, are noted as being very\r\ncommon species, swarming in individuals, and found over a wide range of\r\ncountry. This indicates antiquity and permanence in the species, and is\r\nexactly the condition most essential both to aid in the development of\r\nthe resemblance, and to increase its utility.\r\n\r\nBut the Leptalides are not the only insects who have prolonged their\r\nexistence by imitating the great protected group of Heliconidæ;--a genus\r\nof quite another family of most lovely small American butterflies, the\r\nErycinidæ, and three genera of diurnal moths, also present species which\r\noften mimic the same dominant forms, so that some, as Ithomia ilerdina\r\nof St. Paulo, for instance, have flying with them a few individuals of\r\nthree widely different insects, which are yet disguised with exactly the\r\nsame form, colour, and markings, so as to be quite undistinguishable\r\nwhen upon the wing. Again, the Heliconidæ are not the only group that\r\nare imitated, although they are the most frequent models. The black and\r\nred group of South American Papilios, and the handsome Erycinian genus\r\nStalachtis, have also a few who copy them; but this fact offers no\r\ndifficulty, since these two groups are almost as dominant as the\r\nHeliconidæ. They both fly very slowly, they are both conspicuously\r\ncoloured, and they both abound in individuals; so that there is every\r\nreason to believe that they possess a protection of a similar kind to\r\nthe Heliconidæ, and that it is therefore equally an advantage to other\r\ninsects to be mistaken for them. There is also another extraordinary\r\nfact that we are not yet in a position clearly to comprehend: some\r\ngroups of the Heliconidæ themselves mimic other groups. Species of\r\nHeliconia mimic Mechanitis, and every species of Napeogenes mimics some\r\nother Heliconideous butterfly. This would seem to indicate that the\r\ndistasteful secretion is not produced alike by all members of the\r\nfamily, and that where it is deficient protective imitation comes into\r\nplay. It is this, perhaps, that has caused such a general resemblance\r\namong the Heliconidæ, such a uniformity of type with great diversity of\r\ncolouring, since any aberration causing an insect to cease to look like\r\none of the family would inevitably lead to its being attacked, wounded,\r\nand exterminated, even although it was not eatable.\r\n\r\nIn other parts of the world an exactly parallel series of facts have\r\nbeen observed. The Danaidæ and the Acræidæ of the Old World tropics form\r\nin fact one great group with the Heliconidæ. They have the same general\r\nform, structure, and habits: they possess the same protective odour, and\r\nare equally abundant in individuals, although not so varied in colour,\r\nblue and white spots on a black ground being the most general pattern.\r\nThe insects which mimic these are chiefly Papilios, and Diadema, a genus\r\nallied to our peacock and tortoiseshell butterflies. In tropical Africa\r\nthere is a peculiar group of the genus Danais, characterized by\r\ndark-brown and bluish-white colours, arranged in bands or stripes. One\r\nof these, Danais niavius, is exactly imitated both by Papilio hippocoon\r\nand by Diadema anthedon; another, Danais echeria, by Papilio cenea; and\r\nin Natal a variety of the Danais is found having a white spot at the tip\r\nof wings, accompanied by a variety of the Papilio bearing a\r\ncorresponding white spot. Acræa gea is copied in its very peculiar style\r\nof colouration by the female of Papilio cynorta, by Panopæa hirce, and\r\nby the female of Elymnias phegea. Acræa euryta of Calabar has a female\r\nvariety of Panopea hirce from the same place which exactly copies it;\r\nand Mr. Trimen, in his paper on Mimetic Analogies among African\r\nButterflies, published in the Transactions of the Linnæan Society for\r\n1868, gives a list of no less than sixteen species and varieties of\r\nDiadema and its allies, and ten of Papilio, which in their colour and\r\nmarkings are perfect mimics of species or varieties of Danais or Acræa\r\nwhich inhabit the same districts.\r\n\r\nPassing on to India, we have Danais tytia, a butterfly with\r\nsemi-transparent bluish wings and a border of rich reddish brown. This\r\nremarkable style of colouring is exactly reproduced in Papilio agestor\r\nand in Diadema nama, and all three insects not unfrequently come\r\ntogether in collections made at Darjeeling. In the Philippine Islands\r\nthe large and curious Idea leuconöe with its semi-transparent white\r\nwings, veined and spotted with black, is copied by the rare Papilio\r\nidæoides from the same islands.\r\n\r\nIn the Malay archipelago the very common and beautiful Euploea midamus\r\nis so exactly mimicked by two rare Papilios (P. paradoxa and P. ænigma)\r\nthat I generally caught them under the impression that they were the\r\nmore common species; and the equally common and even more beautiful\r\nEuploea rhadamanthus, with its pure white bands and spots on a ground of\r\nglossy blue and black, is reproduced in the Papilio caunus. Here also\r\nthere are species of Diadema imitating the same group in two or three\r\ninstances; but we shall have to adduce these further on in connexion\r\nwith another branch of the subject.\r\n\r\nIt has been already mentioned that in South America there is a group of\r\nPapilios which have all the characteristics of a protected race, and\r\nwhose peculiar colours and markings are imitated by other butterflies\r\nnot so protected. There is just such a group also in the East, having\r\nvery similar colours and the same habits, and these also are mimicked by\r\nother species in the same genus not closely allied to them, and also by\r\na few of other families. Papilio hector, a common Indian butterfly of a\r\nrich black colour spotted with crimson, is so closely copied by Papilio\r\nromulus, that the latter insect has been thought to be its female. A\r\nclose examination shows, however, that it is essentially different, and\r\nbelongs to another section of the genus. Papilio antiphus and P.\r\ndiphilus, black swallow-tailed butterflies with cream-coloured spots,\r\nare so well imitated by varieties of P. theseus, that several writers\r\nhave classed them as the same species. Papilio liris, found only in the\r\nisland of Timor, is accompanied there by P. ænomaus, the female of\r\nwhich so exactly resembles it that they can hardly be separated in the\r\ncabinet, and on the wing are quite undistinguishable. But one of the\r\nmost curious cases is the fine yellow-spotted Papilio cöon, which is\r\nunmistakeably imitated by the female tailed form of Papilio memnon.\r\nThese are both from Sumatra; but in North India P. cöon is replaced by\r\nanother species, which has been named P. doubledayi, having red spots\r\ninstead of yellow; and in the same district the corresponding female\r\ntailed form of Papilio androgeus, sometimes considered a variety of P.\r\nmemnon, is similarly red-spotted. Mr. Westwood has described some\r\ncurious day-flying moths (Epicopeia) from North India, which have the\r\nform and colour of Papilios of this section, and two of these are very\r\ngood imitations of Papilio polydorus and Papilio varuna, also from North\r\nIndia.\r\n\r\nAlmost all these cases of mimicry are from the tropics, where the forms\r\nof life are more abundant, and where insect development especially is of\r\nunchecked luxuriance; but there are also one or two instances in\r\ntemperate regions. In North America, the large and handsome red and\r\nblack butterfly Danais erippus is very common; and the same country is\r\ninhabited by Limenitis archippus, which closely resembles the Danais,\r\nwhile it differs entirely from every species of its own genus.\r\n\r\nThe only case of probable mimicry in our own country is the\r\nfollowing:--A very common white moth (Spilosoma menthastri) was found by\r\nMr. Stainton to be rejected by young turkeys among hundreds of other\r\nmoths on which they greedily fed. Each bird in succession took hold of\r\nthis moth and threw it down again, as if too nasty to eat. Mr. Jenner\r\nWeir also found that this moth was refused by the Bullfinch, Chaffinch,\r\nYellow Hammer, and Red Bunting, but eaten after much hesitation by the\r\nRobin. We may therefore fairly conclude that this species would be\r\ndisagreeable to many other birds, and would thus have an immunity from\r\nattack, which may be the cause of its great abundance and of its\r\nconspicuous white colour. Now it is a curious thing that there is\r\nanother moth, Diaphora mendica, which appears about the same time, and\r\nwhose female only is white. It is about the same size as Spilosoma\r\nmenthastri, and sufficiently resembles it in the dusk, and this moth is\r\nmuch less common. It seems very probable, therefore, that these species\r\nstand in the same relation to each other as the mimicking butterflies of\r\nvarious families do to the Heliconidæ and Danaidæ. It would be very\r\ninteresting to experiment on all white moths, to ascertain if those\r\nwhich are most common are generally rejected by birds. It may be\r\nanticipated that they would be so, because white is the most conspicuous\r\nof all colours for nocturnal insects, and had they not some other\r\nprotection would certainly be very injurious to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Lepidoptera mimicking other Insects._\r\n\r\nIn the preceding cases we have found Lepidoptera imitating other species\r\nof the same order, and such species only as we have good reason to\r\nbelieve were free from the attacks of many insectivorous creatures; but\r\nthere are other instances in which they altogether lose the external\r\nappearance of the order to which they belong, and take on the dress of\r\nbees or wasps--insects which have an undeniable protection in their\r\nstings. The Sesiidæ and Ægeriidæ, two families of day-flying moths, are\r\nparticularly remarkable in this respect, and a mere inspection of the\r\nnames given to the various species shows how the resemblance has struck\r\neveryone. We have apiformis, vespiforme, ichneumoniforme, scoliæforme,\r\nsphegiforme (bee-like, wasp-like, ichneumon-like, &c.) and many others,\r\nall indicating a resemblance to stinging Hymenoptera. In Britain we may\r\nparticularly notice Sesia bombiliformis, which very closely resembles\r\nthe male of the large and common humble bee, Bombus hortorum; Sphecia\r\ncraboniforme, which is coloured like a hornet, and is (on the authority\r\nof Mr. Jenner Weir) much more like it when alive than when in the\r\ncabinet, from the way in which it carries its wings; and the currant\r\nclear-wing, Trochilium tipuliforme, which resembles a small black wasp\r\n(Odynerus sinuatus) very abundant in gardens at the same season. It has\r\nbeen so much the practice to look upon these resemblances as mere\r\ncurious analogies playing no part in the economy of nature, that we have\r\nscarcely any observations of the habits and appearance when alive of the\r\nhundreds of species of these groups in various parts of the world, or\r\nhow far they are accompanied by Hymenoptera, which they specifically\r\nresemble. There are many species in India (like those figured by\r\nProfessor Westwood in his \"Oriental Entomology\") which have the hind\r\nlegs very broad and densely hairy, so as exactly to imitate the\r\nbrush-legged bees (Scopulipedes) which abound in the same country. In\r\nthis case we have more than mere resemblance of colour, for that which\r\nis an important functional structure in the one group is imitated in\r\nanother whose habits render it perfectly useless.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mimicry among Beetles._\r\n\r\nIt may fairly be expected that if these imitations of one creature by\r\nanother really serve as a protection to weak and decaying species,\r\ninstances of the same kind will be found among other groups than the\r\nLepidoptera; and such is the case, although they are seldom so prominent\r\nand so easily recognised as those already pointed out as occurring in\r\nthat order. A few very interesting examples may, however, be pointed out\r\nin most of the other orders of insects. The Coleoptera or beetles that\r\nimitate other Coleoptera of distinct groups are very numerous in\r\ntropical countries, and they generally follow the laws already laid down\r\nas regulating these phenomena. The insects which others imitate always\r\nhave a special protection, which leads them to be avoided as dangerous\r\nor uneatable by small insectivorous animals; some have a disgusting\r\ntaste (analogous to that of the Heliconidæ); others have such a hard and\r\nstony covering that they cannot be crushed or digested; while a third\r\nset are very active, and armed with powerful jaws, as well as having\r\nsome disagreeable secretion. Some species of Eumorphidæ and Hispidæ,\r\nsmall flat or hemispherical beetles which are exceedingly abundant, and\r\nhave a disagreeable secretion, are imitated by others of the very\r\ndistinct group of Longicornes (of which our common musk-beetle may be\r\ntaken as an example). The extraordinary little Cyclopeplus batesii,\r\nbelongs to the same sub-family of this group as the Onychocerus scorpio\r\nand O. concentricus, which have already been adduced as imitating with\r\nsuch wonderful accuracy the bark of the trees they habitually frequent;\r\nbut it differs totally in outward appearance from every one of its\r\nallies, having taken upon itself the exact shape and colouring of a\r\nglobular Corynomalus, a little stinking beetle with clubbed antennæ. It\r\nis curious to see how these clubbed antennæ are imitated by an insect\r\nbelonging to a group with long slender antennæ. The sub-family\r\nAnisocerinæ, to which Cyclopeplus belongs, is characterised by all its\r\nmembers possessing a little knob or dilatation about the middle of the\r\nantennæ. This knob is considerably enlarged in C. batesii, and the\r\nterminal portion of the antennæ beyond it is so small and slender as to\r\nbe scarcely visible, and thus an excellent substitute is obtained for\r\nthe short clubbed antennæ of the Corynomalus. Erythroplatis corallifer\r\nis another curious broad flat beetle, that no one would take for a\r\nLongicorn, since it almost exactly resembles Cephalodonta spinipes, one\r\nof the commonest of the South American Hispidæ; and what is still more\r\nremarkable, another Longicorn of a distinct group, Streptolabis\r\nhispoides, was found by Mr. Bates, which resembles the same insect with\r\nequal minuteness,--a case exactly parallel to that among butterflies,\r\nwhere species of two or three distinct groups mimicked the same\r\nHeliconia. Many of the soft-winged beetles (Malacoderms) are excessively\r\nabundant in individuals, and it is probable that they have some similar\r\nprotection, more especially as other species often strikingly resemble\r\nthem. A Longicorn beetle, Pæciloderma terminale, found in Jamaica, is\r\ncoloured exactly in the same way as a Lycus (one of the Malacoderms)\r\nfrom the same island. Eroschema poweri, a Longicorn from Australia,\r\nmight certainly be taken for one of the same group, and several species\r\nfrom the Malay Islands are equally deceptive. In the Island of Celebes I\r\nfound one of this group, having the whole body and elytra of a rich deep\r\nblue colour, with the head only orange; and in company with it an insect\r\nof a totally different family (Eucnemidæ) with identically the same\r\ncolouration, and of so nearly the same size and form as to completely\r\npuzzle the collector on every fresh occasion of capturing them. I have\r\nbeen recently informed by Mr. Jenner Weir, who keeps a variety of small\r\nbirds, that none of them will touch our common \"soldiers and sailors\"\r\n(species of Malacoderms), thus confirming my belief that they were a\r\nprotected group, founded on the fact of their being at once very\r\nabundant, of conspicuous colours, and the objects of mimicry.\r\n\r\nThere are a number of the larger tropical weevils which have the\r\nelytra and the whole covering of the body so hard as to be a great\r\nannoyance to the entomologist, because in attempting to transfix them\r\nthe points of his pins are constantly turned. I have found it necessary\r\nin these cases to drill a hole very carefully with the point of a\r\nsharp penknife before attempting to insert a pin. Many of the fine\r\nlong-antennæd Anthribidæ (an allied group) have to be treated in the\r\nsame way. We can easily understand that after small birds have in vain\r\nattempted to eat these insects, they should get to know them by sight,\r\nand ever after leave them alone, and it will then be an advantage for\r\nother insects which are comparatively soft and eatable, to be mistaken\r\nfor them. We need not be surprised, therefore, to find that there are\r\nmany Longicorns which strikingly resemble the \"hard beetles\" of their\r\nown district. In South Brazil, Acanthotritus dorsalis is strikingly\r\nlike a Curculio of the hard genus Heiliplus, and Mr. Bates assures me\r\nthat he found Gymnocerus cratosomoides (a Longicorn) on the same tree\r\nwith a hard Cratosomus (a weevil), which it exactly mimics. Again, the\r\npretty Longicorn, Phacellocera batesii, mimics one of the hard\r\nAnthribidæ of the genus Ptychoderes, having long slender antennæ. In the\r\nMoluccas we find Cacia anthriboides, a small Longicorn which might be\r\neasily mistaken for a very common species of Anthribidæ found in the\r\nsame districts; and the very rare Capnolymma stygium closely imitates\r\nthe common Mecocerus gazella, which abounded where it was taken. Doliops\r\ncurculionoides and other allied Longicorns from the Philippine Islands\r\nmost curiously resemble, both in form and colouring, the brilliant\r\nPachyrhynchi,--Curculionidæ, which are almost peculiar to that group of\r\nislands. The remaining family of Coleoptera most frequently imitated is\r\nthe Cicindelidæ. The rare and curious Longicorn, Collyrodes lacordairei,\r\nhas exactly the form and colouring of the genus Collyris, while an\r\nundescribed species of Heteromera is exactly like a Therates, and was\r\ntaken running on the trunks of trees, as is the habit of that group.\r\nThere is one curious example of a Longicorn mimicking a Longicorn, like\r\nthe Papilios and Heliconidæ which mimic their own allies. Agnia\r\nfasciata, belonging to the sub-family Hypselominæ, and Nemophas grayi,\r\nbelonging to the Lamiinæ, were taken in Amboyna on the same fallen tree\r\nat the same time, and were supposed to be the same species till they\r\nwere more carefully examined, and found to be structurally quite\r\ndifferent. The colouring of these insects is very remarkable, being rich\r\nsteel-blue black, crossed by broad hairy bands of orange buff, and out\r\nof the many thousands of known species of Longicorns they are probably\r\nthe only two which are so coloured. The Nemophas grayi is the larger,\r\nstronger, and better armed insect, and belongs to a more widely spread\r\nand dominant group, very rich in species and individuals, and is\r\ntherefore most probably the subject of mimicry by the other species.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Beetles mimicking other Insects._\r\n\r\nWe will now adduce a few cases in which beetles imitate other insects,\r\nand insects of other orders imitate beetles.\r\n\r\nCharis melipona, a South American Longicorn of the family Necydalidæ,\r\nhas been so named from its resemblance to a small bee of the genus\r\nMelipona. It is one of the most remarkable cases of mimicry, since the\r\nbeetle has the thorax and body densely hairy like the bee, and the legs\r\nare tufted in a manner most unusual in the order Coleoptera. Another\r\nLongicorn, Odontocera odyneroides, has the abdomen banded with yellow,\r\nand constricted at the base, and is altogether so exactly like a small\r\ncommon wasp of the genus Odynerus, that Mr. Bates informs us he was\r\nafraid to take it out of his net with his fingers for fear of being\r\nstung. Had Mr. Bates's taste for insects been less omnivorous than it\r\nwas, the beetle's disguise might have saved it from his pin, as it had\r\nno doubt often done from the beak of hungry birds. A larger insect,\r\nSphecomorpha chalybea, is exactly like one of the large metallic blue\r\nwasps, and like them has the abdomen connected with the thorax by a\r\npedicel, rendering the deception most complete and striking. Many\r\nEastern species of Longicorns of the genus Oberea, when on the wing\r\nexactly resemble Tenthredinidæ, and many of the small species of\r\nHesthesis run about on timber, and cannot be distinguished from ants.\r\nThere is one genus of South American Longicorns that appears to mimic\r\nthe shielded bugs of the genus Scutellera. The Gymnocerous capucinus is\r\none of these, and is very like Pachyotris fabricii, one of the\r\nScutelleridæ. The beautiful Gymnocerous dulcissimus is also very like\r\nthe same group of insects, though there is no known species that exactly\r\ncorresponds to it; but this is not to be wondered at, as the tropical\r\nHemiptera have been comparatively so little cared for by collectors.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Insects mimicking Species of other Orders._\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable case of an insect of another order mimicking a\r\nbeetle is that of the Condylodera tricondyloides, one of the cricket\r\nfamily from the Philippine Islands, which is so exactly like a\r\nTricondyla (one of the tiger beetles), that such an experienced\r\nentomologist as Professor Westwood placed it among them in his cabinet,\r\nand retained it there a long time before he discovered his mistake! Both\r\ninsects run along the trunks of trees, and whereas Tricondylas are very\r\nplentiful, the insect that mimics it is, as in all other cases, very\r\nrare. Mr. Bates also informs us that he found at Santarem on the Amazon,\r\na species of locust which mimicked one of the tiger beetles of the genus\r\nOdontocheila, and was found on the same trees which they frequented.\r\n\r\nThere are a considerable number of Diptera, or two-winged flies, that\r\nclosely resemble wasps and bees, and no doubt derive much benefit from\r\nthe wholesome dread which those insects excite. The Midas dives, and\r\nother species of large Brazilian flies, have dark wings and metallic\r\nblue elongate bodies, resembling the large stinging Sphegidæ of the same\r\ncountry; and a very large fly of the genus Asilus has black-banded\r\nwings and the abdomen tipped with rich orange, so as exactly to resemble\r\nthe fine bee Euglossa dimidiata, and both are found in the same parts of\r\nSouth America. We have also in our own country species of Bombylius\r\nwhich are almost exactly like bees. In these cases the end gained by the\r\nmimicry is no doubt freedom from attack, but it has sometimes an\r\naltogether different purpose. There are a number of parasitic flies\r\nwhose larvæ feed upon the larvæ of bees, such as the British genus\r\nVolucella and many of the tropical Bombylii, and most of these are\r\nexactly like the particular species of bee they prey upon, so that they\r\ncan enter their nests unsuspected to deposit their eggs. There are also\r\nbees that mimic bees. The cuckoo bees of the genus Nomada are parasitic\r\non the Andrenidæ, and they resemble either wasps or species of Andrena;\r\nand the parasitic humble-bees of the genus Apathus almost exactly\r\nresemble the species of humble-bees in whose nests they are reared. Mr.\r\nBates informs us that he found numbers of these \"cuckoo\" bees and flies\r\non the Amazon, which all wore the livery of working bees peculiar to the\r\nsame country.\r\n\r\nThere is a genus of small spiders in the tropics which feed on ants, and\r\nthey are exactly like ants themselves, which no doubt gives them more\r\nopportunity of seizing their prey; and Mr. Bates found on the Amazon a\r\nspecies of Mantis which exactly resembled the white ants which it fed\r\nupon, as well as several species of crickets (Scaphura), which resembled\r\nin a wonderful manner different sand-wasps of large size, which are\r\nconstantly on the search for crickets with which to provision their\r\nnests.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most wonderful case of all is the large caterpillar\r\nmentioned by Mr. Bates, which startled him by its close resemblance to a\r\nsmall snake. The first three segments behind the head were dilatable at\r\nthe will of the insect, and had on each side a large black pupillated\r\nspot, which resembled the eye of the reptile. Moreover, it resembled a\r\npoisonous viper, not a harmless species of snake, as was proved by the\r\nimitation of keeled scales on the crown produced by the recumbent feet,\r\nas the caterpillar threw itself backward!\r\n\r\nThe attitudes of many of the tropical spiders are most extraordinary and\r\ndeceptive, but little attention has been paid to them. They often mimic\r\nother insects, and some, Mr. Bates assures us, are exactly like flower\r\nbuds, and take their station in the axils of leaves, where they remain\r\nmotionless waiting for their prey.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cases of Mimicry among the Vertebrata._\r\n\r\nHaving thus shown how varied and extraordinary are the modes in which\r\nmimicry occurs among insects, we have now to enquire if anything of the\r\nsame kind is to be observed among vertebrated animals. When we consider\r\nall the conditions necessary to produce a good deceptive imitation, we\r\nshall see at once that such can very rarely occur in the higher animals,\r\nsince they possess none of those facilities for the almost infinite\r\nmodifications of external form which exist in the very nature of insect\r\norganization. The outer covering of insects being more or less solid\r\nand horny, they are capable of almost any amount of change of form and\r\nappearance without any essential modification internally. In many groups\r\nthe wings give much of the character, and these organs may be much\r\nmodified both in form and colour without interfering with their special\r\nfunctions. Again, the number of species of insects is so great, and\r\nthere is such diversity of form and proportion in every group, that the\r\nchances of an accidental approximation in size, form, and colour, of one\r\ninsect to another of a different group, are very considerable; and it is\r\nthese chance approximations that furnish the basis of mimicry, to be\r\ncontinually advanced and perfected by the survival of those varieties\r\nonly which tend in the right direction.\r\n\r\nIn the Vertebrata, on the contrary, the skeleton being internal the\r\nexternal form depends almost entirely on the proportions and arrangement\r\nof that skeleton, which again is strictly adapted to the functions\r\nnecessary for the well-being of the animal. The form cannot therefore be\r\nrapidly modified by variation, and the thin and flexible integument will\r\nnot admit of the development of such strange protuberances as occur\r\ncontinually in insects. The number of species of each group in the same\r\ncountry is also comparatively small, and thus the chances of that first\r\naccidental resemblance which is necessary for natural selection to work\r\nupon are much diminished. We can hardly see the possibility of a mimicry\r\nby which the elk could escape from the wolf, or the buffalo from the\r\ntiger. There is, however, in one group of Vertebrata such a general\r\nsimilarity of form, that a very slight modification, if accompanied by\r\nidentity of colour, would produce the necessary amount of resemblance;\r\nand at the same time there exist a number of species which it would be\r\nadvantageous for others to resemble, since they are armed with the most\r\nfatal weapons of offence. We accordingly find that reptiles furnish us\r\nwith a very remarkable and instructive case of true mimicry.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mimicry among Snakes._\r\n\r\nThere are in tropical America a number of venomous snakes of the genus\r\nElaps, which are ornamented with brilliant colours disposed in a\r\npeculiar manner. The ground colour is generally bright red, on which are\r\nblack bands of various widths and sometimes divided into two or three by\r\nyellow rings. Now, in the same country are found several genera of\r\nharmless snakes, having no affinity whatever with the above, but\r\ncoloured exactly the same. For example, the poisonous Elaps fulvius\r\noften occurs in Guatemala with simple black bands on a coral-red ground;\r\nand in the same country is found the harmless snake Pliocerus equalis,\r\ncoloured and banded in identically the same manner. A variety of Elaps\r\ncorallinus has the black bands narrowly bordered with yellow on the same\r\nred ground colour, and a harmless snake, Homalocranium semicinctum, has\r\nexactly the same markings, and both are found in Mexico. The deadly\r\nElaps lemniscatus has the black bands very broad, and each of them\r\ndivided into three by narrow yellow rings; and this again is exactly\r\ncopied by a harmless snake, Pliocerus elapoides, which is found along\r\nwith its model in Mexico.\r\n\r\nBut, more remarkable still, there is in South America a third group of\r\nsnakes, the genus Oxyrhopus, doubtfully venomous, and having no\r\nimmediate affinity with either of the preceding, which has also the same\r\ncurious distribution of colours, namely, variously disposed rings of\r\nred, yellow, and black; and there are some cases in which species of all\r\nthree of these groups similarly marked inhabit the same district. For\r\nexample, Elaps mipartitus has single black rings very close together. It\r\ninhabits the west side of the Andes, and in the same districts occur\r\nPliocerus euryzonus and Oxyrhopus petolarius, which exactly copy its\r\npattern. In Brazil Elaps lemniscatus is copied by Oxyrhopus trigeminus,\r\nboth having black rings disposed in threes. In Elaps hemiprichii the\r\nground colour appears to be black, with alternations of two narrow\r\nyellow bands and a broader red one; and of this pattern again we have an\r\nexact double in Oxyrhopus formosus, both being found in many localities\r\nof tropical South America.\r\n\r\nWhat adds much to the extraordinary character of these resemblances is\r\nthe fact, that nowhere in the world but in America are there any snakes\r\nat all which have this style of colouring. Dr. Gunther, of the British\r\nMuseum, who has kindly furnished some of the details here referred to,\r\nassures me that this is the case; and that red, black, and yellow rings\r\noccur together on no other snakes in the world but on Elaps and the\r\nspecies which so closely resemble it. In all these cases, the size and\r\nform as well as the colouration, are so much alike, that none but a\r\nnaturalist would distinguish the harmless from the poisonous species.\r\n\r\nMany of the small tree-frogs are no doubt also mimickers. When seen in\r\ntheir natural attitudes, I have been often unable to distinguish them\r\nfrom beetles or other insects sitting upon leaves, but regret to say I\r\nneglected to observe what species or groups they most resembled, and the\r\nsubject does not yet seem to have attracted the attention of naturalists\r\nabroad.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mimicry among Birds._\r\n\r\nIn the class of birds there are a number of cases that make some\r\napproach to mimicry, such as the resemblance of the cuckoos, a weak and\r\ndefenceless group of birds, to hawks and Gallinaceæ. There is, however,\r\none example which goes much further than this, and seems to be of\r\nexactly the same nature as the many cases of insect mimicry which have\r\nbeen already given. In Australia and the Moluccas there is a genus of\r\nhoneysuckers called Tropidorhynchus, good sized birds, very strong and\r\nactive, having powerful grasping claws and long, curved, sharp beaks.\r\nThey assemble together in groups and small flocks, and they have a very\r\nloud bawling note, which can be heard at a great distance, and serves to\r\ncollect a number together in time of danger. They are very plentiful\r\nand very pugnacious, frequently driving away crows, and even hawks,\r\nwhich perch on a tree where a few of them are assembled. They are all of\r\nrather dull and obscure colours. Now in the same countries there is a\r\ngroup of orioles, forming the genus Mimeta, much weaker birds, which\r\nhave lost the gay colouring of their allies the golden orioles, being\r\nusually olive-green or brown; and in several cases these most curiously\r\nresemble the Tropidorhynchus of the same island. For example, in the\r\nisland of Bouru is found the Tropidorhynchus bouruensis, of a dull\r\nearthy colour, and the Mimeta bouruensis, which resembles it in the\r\nfollowing particulars:--The upper and under surfaces of the two birds\r\nare exactly of the same tints of dark and light brown; the\r\nTropidorhynchus has a large bare black patch round the eyes; this is\r\ncopied in the Mimeta by a patch of black feathers. The top of the head\r\nof the Tropidorhynchus has a scaly appearance from the narrow\r\nscale-formed feathers, which are imitated by the broader feathers of the\r\nMimeta having a dusky line down each. The Tropidorhynchus has a pale\r\nruff formed of curious recurved feathers on the nape (which has given\r\nthe whole genus the name of Friar birds); this is represented in the\r\nMimeta by a pale band in the same position. Lastly, the bill of the\r\nTropidorhynchus is raised into a protuberant keel at the base, and the\r\nMimeta has the same character, although it is not a common one in the\r\ngenus. The result is, that on a superficial examination the birds are\r\nidentical, although they have important structural differences, and\r\ncannot be placed near each other in any natural arrangement. As a proof\r\nthat the resemblance is really deceptive, it may be mentioned that the\r\nMimeta is figured and described as a honeysucker in the costly \"Voyage\r\nde l'Astrolabe,\" under the name of Philedon bouruensis!\r\n\r\nPassing to the island of Ceram, we find allied species of both genera.\r\nThe Tropidorhynchus subcornutus is of an earthy brown colour washed with\r\nyellow ochre, with bare orbits, dusky cheeks, and the usual pale\r\nrecurved nape-ruff. The Mimeta forsteni is absolutely identical in the\r\ntints of every part of the body, the details of which are imitated in\r\nthe same manner as in the Bouru birds already described. In two other\r\nislands there is an approximation towards mimicry, although it is not so\r\nperfect as in the two preceding cases. In Timor the Tropidorhynchus\r\ntimoriensis is of the usual earthy brown above, with the nape-ruff very\r\nprominent, the cheeks black, the throat nearly white, and the whole\r\nunder surface pale whitish brown. These various tints are all well\r\nreproduced in Mimeta virescens, the chief want of exact imitation being\r\nthat the throat and breast of the Tropidorhynchus has a very scaly\r\nappearance, being covered with rigid pointed feathers which are not\r\nimitated in the Mimeta, although there are signs of faint dusky spots\r\nwhich may easily furnish the groundwork of a more exact imitation by the\r\ncontinued survival of favourable variations in the same direction. There\r\nis also a large knob at the base of the bill of the Tropidorhynchus\r\nwhich is not at all imitated by the Mimeta. In the island of Morty\r\n(north of Gilolo) there exists the Tropidorhynchus fuscicapillus, of a\r\ndark sooty brown colour, especially on the head, while the under parts\r\nare rather lighter, and the characteristic ruff of the nape is wanting.\r\nNow it is curious that in the adjacent island of Gilolo should be found\r\nthe Mimeta phæochromus, the upper surface of which is of exactly the\r\nsame dark sooty tint as the Tropidorhynchus, and is the only known\r\nspecies that is of such a dark colour. The under side is not quite light\r\nenough, but it is a good approximation. This Mimeta is a rare bird, and\r\nmay very probably exist in Morty, though not yet found there; or, on the\r\nother hand, recent changes in physical geography may have led to the\r\nrestriction of the Tropidorhynchus to that island, where it is very\r\ncommon.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we have two cases of perfect mimicry and two others of good\r\napproximation, occurring between species of the same two genera of\r\nbirds; and in three of these cases the pairs that resemble each other\r\nare found together in the same island, and to which they are peculiar.\r\nIn all these cases the Tropidorhynchus is rather larger than the Mimeta,\r\nbut the difference is not beyond the limits of variation in species, and\r\nthe two genera are somewhat alike in form and proportion. There are, no\r\ndoubt, some special enemies by which many small birds are attacked, but\r\nwhich are afraid of the Tropidorhynchus (probably some of the hawks),\r\nand thus it becomes advantageous for the weak Mimeta to resemble the\r\nstrong, pugnacious, noisy, and very abundant Tropidorhynchus.\r\n\r\nMy friend, Mr. Osbert Salvin, has given me another interesting case of\r\nbird mimicry. In the neighbourhood of Rio Janeiro is found an\r\ninsect-eating hawk (Harpagus diodon), and in the same district a\r\nbird-eating hawk (Accipiter pileatus) which closely resembles it. Both\r\nare of the same ashy tint beneath, with the thighs and under\r\nwing-coverts reddish brown, so that when on the wing and seen from below\r\nthey are undistinguishable. The curious point, however, is that the\r\nAccipiter has a much wider range than the Harpagus, and in the regions\r\nwhere the insect-eating species is not found it no longer resembles it,\r\nthe under wing-coverts varying to white; thus indicating that the\r\nred-brown colour is kept true by its being useful to the Accipiter to be\r\nmistaken for the insect-eating species, which birds have learnt not to\r\nbe afraid of.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mimicry among Mammals._\r\n\r\nAmong the Mammalia the only case which may be true mimicry is that of\r\nthe insectivorous genus Cladobates, found in the Malay countries,\r\nseveral species of which very closely resemble squirrels. The size is\r\nabout the same, the long bushy tail is carried in the same way, and the\r\ncolours are very similar. In this case the use of the resemblance must\r\nbe to enable the Cladobates to approach the insects or small birds on\r\nwhich it feeds, under the disguise of the harmless fruit-eating\r\nsquirrel.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Objections to Mr. Bates' Theory of Mimicry._\r\n\r\nHaving now completed our survey of the most prominent and remarkable\r\ncases of mimicry that have yet been noticed, we must say something of\r\nthe objections that have been made to the theory of their production\r\ngiven by Mr. Bates, and which we have endeavoured to illustrate and\r\nenforce in the preceding pages. Three counter explanations have been\r\nproposed. Professor Westwood admits the fact of the mimicry and its\r\nprobable use to the insect, but maintains that each species was created\r\na mimic for the purpose of the protection thus afforded it. Mr. Andrew\r\nMurray, in his paper on the \"Disguises of Nature,\" inclines to the\r\nopinion that similar conditions of food and of surrounding circumstances\r\nhave acted in some unknown way to produce the resemblances; and when the\r\nsubject was discussed before the Entomological Society of London, a\r\nthird objection was added--that heredity or the reversion to ancestral\r\ntypes of form and colouration, might have produced many of the cases of\r\nmimicry.\r\n\r\nAgainst the special creation of mimicking species there are all the\r\nobjections and difficulties in the way of special creation in other\r\ncases, with the addition of a few that are peculiar to it. The most\r\nobvious is, that we have gradations of mimicry and of protective\r\nresemblance--a fact which is strongly suggestive of a natural process\r\nhaving been at work. Another very serious objection is, that as mimicry\r\nhas been shown to be useful only to those species and groups which are\r\nrare and probably dying out, and would cease to have any effect should\r\nthe proportionate abundance of the two species be reversed, it follows\r\nthat on the special-creation theory the one species must have been\r\ncreated plentiful, the other rare; and, notwithstanding the many causes\r\nthat continually tend to alter the proportions of species, these two\r\nspecies must have always been specially maintained at their respective\r\nproportions, or the very purpose for which they each received their\r\npeculiar characteristics would have completely failed. A third\r\ndifficulty is, that although it is very easy to understand how mimicry\r\nmay be brought about by variation and the survival of the fittest, it\r\nseems a very strange thing for a Creator to protect an animal by making\r\nit imitate another, when the very assumption of a Creator implies his\r\npower to create it so as to require no such circuitous protection. These\r\nappear to be fatal objections to the application of the special-creation\r\ntheory to this particular case.\r\n\r\nThe other two supposed explanations, which may be shortly expressed as\r\nthe theories of \"similar conditions\" and of \"heredity,\" agree in making\r\nmimicry, where it exists, an adventitious circumstance not necessarily\r\nconnected with the well-being of the mimicking species. But several of\r\nthe most striking and most constant facts which have been adduced,\r\ndirectly contradict both those hypotheses. The law that mimicry is\r\nconfined to a few groups only is one of these, for \"similar conditions\"\r\nmust act more or less on all groups in a limited region, and \"heredity\"\r\nmust influence all groups related to each other in an equal degree.\r\nAgain, the general fact that those species which mimic others are rare,\r\nwhile those which are imitated are abundant, is in no way explained by\r\neither of these theories, any more than is the frequent occurrence of\r\nsome palpable mode of protection in the imitated species. \"Reversion to\r\nan ancestral type\" no way explains why the imitator and the imitated\r\nalways inhabit the very same district, whereas allied forms of every\r\ndegree of nearness and remoteness generally inhabit different countries,\r\nand often different quarters of the globe; and neither it, nor \"similar\r\nconditions,\" will account for the likeness between species of distinct\r\ngroups being superficial only--a disguise, not a true resemblance; for\r\nthe imitation of bark, of leaves, of sticks, of dung; for the\r\nresemblance between species in different orders, and even different\r\nclasses and sub-kingdoms; and finally, for the graduated series of the\r\nphenomena, beginning with a general harmony and adaptation of tint in\r\nautumn and winter moths and in arctic and desert animals, and ending\r\nwith those complete cases of detailed mimicry which not only deceive\r\npredacious animals, but puzzle the most experienced insect collectors\r\nand the most learned entomologists.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mimicry by Female Insects only._\r\n\r\nBut there is yet another series of phenomena connected with this\r\nsubject, which considerably strengthens the view here adopted, while it\r\nseems quite incompatible with either of the other hypotheses; namely,\r\nthe relation of protective colouring and mimicry to the sexual\r\ndifferences of animals. It will be clear to every one that if two\r\nanimals, which as regards \"external conditions\" and \"hereditary\r\ndescent,\" are exactly alike, yet differ remarkably in colouration, one\r\nresembling a protected species and the other not, the resemblance that\r\nexists in one only can hardly be imputed to the influence of external\r\nconditions or as the effect of heredity. And if, further, it can be\r\nproved that the one requires protection more than the other, and that in\r\nseveral cases it is that one which mimics the protected species, while\r\nthe one that least requires protection never does so, it will afford\r\nvery strong corroborative evidence that there is a real connexion\r\nbetween the necessity for protection and the phenomenon of mimicry. Now\r\nthe sexes of insects offer us a test of the nature here indicated, and\r\nappear to furnish one of the most conclusive arguments in favour of the\r\ntheory that the phenomena termed \"mimicry\" are produced by natural\r\nselection.\r\n\r\nThe comparative importance of the sexes varies much in different classes\r\nof animals. In the higher vertebrates, where the number of young\r\nproduced at a birth is small and the same individuals breed many years\r\nin succession, the preservation of both sexes is almost equally\r\nimportant. In all the numerous cases in which the male protects the\r\nfemale and her offspring, or helps to supply them with food, his\r\nimportance in the economy of nature is proportionately increased,\r\nthough it is never perhaps quite equal to that of the female. In\r\ninsects the case is very different; they pair but once in their lives,\r\nand the prolonged existence of the male is in most cases quite\r\nunnecessary for the continuance of the race. The female, however, must\r\ncontinue to exist long enough to deposit her eggs in a place adapted for\r\nthe development and growth of the progeny. Hence there is a wide\r\ndifference in the need for protection in the two sexes; and we should,\r\ntherefore, expect to find that in some cases the special protection\r\ngiven to the female was in the male less in amount or altogether\r\nwanting. The facts entirely confirm this expectation. In the spectre\r\ninsects (Phasmidæ) it is often the females alone that so strikingly\r\nresemble leaves, while the males show only a rude approximation. The\r\nmale Diadema misippus is a very handsome and conspicuous butterfly,\r\nwithout a sign of protective or imitative colouring, while the female is\r\nentirely unlike her partner, and is one of the most wonderful cases of\r\nmimicry on record, resembling most accurately the common Danais\r\nchrysippus, in whose company it is often found. So in several species of\r\nSouth American Pieris, the males are white and black, of a similar type\r\nof colouring to our own \"cabbage\" butterflies, while the females are\r\nrich yellow and buff, spotted and marked so as exactly to resemble\r\nspecies of Heliconidæ with which they associate in the forest. In the\r\nMalay archipelago is found a Diadema which had always been considered a\r\nmale insect on account of its glossy metallic-blue tints, while its\r\ncompanion of sober brown was looked upon as the female. I discovered,\r\nhowever, that the reverse is the case, and that the rich and glossy\r\ncolours of the female are imitative and protective, since they cause her\r\nexactly to resemble the common Euploea midamus of the same regions, a\r\nspecies which has been already mentioned in this essay as mimicked by\r\nanother butterfly, Papilio paradoxa. I have since named this interesting\r\nspecies Diadema anomala (see the Transactions of the Entomological\r\nSociety, 1869, p. 285). In this case, and in that of Diadema misippus,\r\nthere is no difference in the habits of the two sexes, which fly in\r\nsimilar localities; so that the influence of \"external conditions\"\r\ncannot be invoked here as it has been in the case of the South American\r\nPieris pyrrha and allies, where the white males frequent open sunny\r\nplaces, while the Heliconia-like females haunt the shades of the forest.\r\n\r\nWe may impute to the same general cause (the greater need of protection\r\nfor the female, owing to her weaker flight, greater exposure to attack,\r\nand supreme importance)--the fact of the colours of female insects being\r\nso very generally duller and less conspicuous than those of the other\r\nsex. And that it is chiefly due to this cause rather than to what Mr.\r\nDarwin terms \"sexual selection\" appears to be shown by the otherwise\r\ninexplicable fact, that in the groups which have a protection of any\r\nkind independent of concealment, sexual differences of colour are either\r\nquite wanting or slightly developed. The Heliconidæ and Danaidæ,\r\nprotected by a disagreeable flavour, have the females as bright and\r\nconspicuous as the males, and very rarely differing at all from them.\r\nThe stinging Hymenoptera have the two sexes equally well coloured. The\r\nCarabidæ, the Coccinellidæ, Chrysomelidæ, and the Telephori have both\r\nsexes equally conspicuous, and seldom differing in colours. The\r\nbrilliant Curculios, which are protected by their hardness, are\r\nbrilliant in both sexes. Lastly, the glittering Cetoniadæ and\r\nBuprestidæ, which seem to be protected by their hard and polished coats,\r\ntheir rapid motions, and peculiar habits, present few sexual differences\r\nof colour, while sexual selection has often manifested itself by\r\nstructural differences, such as horns, spines, or other processes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cause of the dull Colours of Female Birds._\r\n\r\nThe same law manifests itself in Birds. The female while sitting on her\r\neggs requires protection by concealment to a much greater extent than\r\nthe male; and we accordingly find that in a large majority of the cases\r\nin which the male birds are distinguished by unusual brilliancy of\r\nplumage, the females are much more obscure, and often remarkably\r\nplain-coloured. The exceptions are such as eminently to prove the rule,\r\nfor in most cases we can see a very good reason for them. In particular,\r\nthere are a few instances among wading and gallinaceous birds in which\r\nthe female has decidedly more brilliant colours than the male; but it is\r\na most curious and interesting fact that in most if not all these cases\r\nthe males sit upon the eggs; so that this exception to the usual rule\r\nalmost demonstrates that it is because the process of incubation is at\r\nonce very important and very dangerous, that the protection of obscure\r\ncolouring is developed. The most striking example is that of the gray\r\nphalarope (Phalaropus fulicarius). When in winter plumage, the sexes of\r\nthis bird are alike in colouration, but in summer the female is much the\r\nmost conspicuous, having a black head, dark wings, and reddish-brown\r\nback, while the male is nearly uniform brown, with dusky spots. Mr.\r\nGould in his \"Birds of Great Britain\" figures the two sexes in both\r\nwinter and summer plumage, and remarks on the strange peculiarity of the\r\nusual colours of the two sexes being reversed, and also on the still\r\nmore curious fact that the \"male alone sits on the eggs,\" which are\r\ndeposited on the bare ground. In another British bird, the dotterell,\r\nthe female is also larger and more brightly-coloured than the male; and\r\nit seems to be proved that the males assist in incubation even if they\r\ndo not perform it entirely, for Mr. Gould tells us, \"that they have been\r\nshot with the breast bare of feathers, caused by sitting on the eggs.\"\r\nThe small quail-like birds forming the genus Turnix have also generally\r\nlarge and bright-coloured females, and we are told by Mr. Jerdon in his\r\n\"Birds of India\" that \"the natives report that during the breeding\r\nseason the females desert their eggs and associate in flocks while the\r\nmales are employed in hatching the eggs.\" It is also an ascertained\r\nfact, that the females are more bold and pugnacious than the males. A\r\nfurther confirmation of this view is to be found in the fact (not\r\nhitherto noticed) that in a large majority of the cases in which bright\r\ncolours exist in both sexes incubation takes place in a dark hole or in\r\na dome-shaped nest. Female kingfishers are often equally brilliant with\r\nthe male, and they build in holes in banks. Bee-eaters, trogons,\r\nmotmots, and toucans, all build in holes, and in none is there any\r\ndifference in the sexes, although they are, without exception, showy\r\nbirds. Parrots build in holes in trees, and in the majority of cases\r\nthey present no marked sexual difference tending to concealment of the\r\nfemale. Woodpeckers are in the same category, since though the sexes\r\noften differ in colour, the female is not generally less conspicuous\r\nthan the male. Wagtails and titmice build concealed nests, and the\r\nfemales are nearly as gay as their mates. The female of the pretty\r\nAustralian bird Pardalotus punctatus, is very conspicuously spotted on\r\nthe upper surface, and it builds in a hole in the ground. The\r\ngay-coloured hang-nests (Icterinæ) and the equally brilliant tanagers\r\nmay be well contrasted; for the former, concealed in their covered\r\nnests, present little or no sexual difference of colour--while the\r\nopen-nested tanagers have the females dull-coloured and sometimes with\r\nalmost protective tints. No doubt there are many individual exceptions\r\nto the rule here indicated, because many and various causes have\r\ncombined to determine both the colouration and the habits of birds.\r\nThese have no doubt acted and re-acted on each other; and when\r\nconditions have changed one of these characters may often have become\r\nmodified, while the other, though useless, may continue by hereditary\r\ndescent an apparent exception to what otherwise seems a very general\r\nrule. The facts presented by the sexual differences of colour in birds\r\nand their mode of nesting, are on the whole in perfect harmony with that\r\nlaw of protective adaptation of colour and form, which appears to have\r\nchecked to some extent the powerful action of sexual selection, and to\r\nhave materially influenced the colouring of female birds, as it has\r\nundoubtedly done that of female insects.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Use of the gaudy Colours of many Caterpillars._\r\n\r\nSince this essay was first published a very curious difficulty has been\r\ncleared up by the application of the general principle of protective\r\ncolouring. Great numbers of caterpillars are so brilliantly marked and\r\ncoloured as to be very conspicuous even at a considerable distance, and\r\nit has been noticed that such caterpillars seldom hide themselves. Other\r\nspecies, however, are green or brown, closely resembling the colours of\r\nthe substances on which they feed, while others again imitate sticks,\r\nand stretch themselves out motionless from a twig so as to look like one\r\nof its branches. Now, as caterpillars form so large a part of the food\r\nof birds, it was not easy to understand why any of them should have such\r\nbright colours and markings as to make them specially visible. Mr.\r\nDarwin had put the case to me as a difficulty from another point of\r\nview, for he had arrived at the conclusion that brilliant colouration in\r\nthe animal kingdom is mainly due to sexual selection, and this could not\r\nhave acted in the case of sexless larvæ. Applying here the analogy of\r\nother insects, I reasoned, that since some caterpillars were evidently\r\nprotected by their imitative colouring, and others by their spiny or\r\nhairy bodies, the bright colours of the rest must also be in some way\r\nuseful to them. I further thought that as some butterflies and moths\r\nwere greedily eaten by birds while others were distasteful to them, and\r\nthese latter were mostly of conspicuous colours, so probably these\r\nbrilliantly coloured caterpillars were distasteful, and therefore never\r\neaten by birds. Distastefulness alone would however be of little service\r\nto caterpillars, because their soft and juicy bodies are so delicate,\r\nthat if seized and afterwards rejected by a bird they would almost\r\ncertainly be killed. Some constant and easily perceived signal was\r\ntherefore necessary to serve as a warning to birds never to touch these\r\nuneatable kinds, and a very gaudy and conspicuous colouring with the\r\nhabit of fully exposing themselves to view becomes such a signal, being\r\nin strong contrast with the green or brown tints and retiring habits of\r\nthe eatable kinds. The subject was brought by me before the\r\nEntomological Society (see Proceedings, March 4th, 1867), in order that\r\nthose members having opportunities for making observations might do so\r\nin the following summer; and I also wrote a letter to the _Field_\r\nnewspaper, begging that some of its readers would co-operate in making\r\nobservations on what insects were rejected by birds, at the same time\r\nfully explaining the great interest and scientific importance of the\r\nproblem. It is a curious example of how few of the country readers of\r\nthat paper are at all interested in questions of simple natural history,\r\nthat I only obtained one answer from a gentleman in Cumberland, who gave\r\nme some interesting observations on the general dislike and abhorrence\r\nof all birds to the \"Gooseberry Caterpillar,\" probably that of the\r\nMagpie-moth (Abraxas grossulariata). Neither young pheasants,\r\npartridges, nor wild-ducks could be induced to eat it, sparrows and\r\nfinches never touched it, and all birds to whom he offered it rejected\r\nit with evident dread and abhorrence. It will be seen that these\r\nobservations are confirmed by those of two members of the Entomological\r\nSociety to whom we are indebted for more detailed information.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1869, Mr. J. Jenner Weir communicated a valuable series of\r\nobservations made during many years, but more especially in the two\r\npreceding summers, in his aviary, containing the following birds of more\r\nor less insectivorous habits:--Robin, Yellow-Hammer, Reed-bunting,\r\nBullfinch, Chaffinch, Crossbill, Thrush, Tree-Pipit, Siskin, and\r\nRedpoll. He found that hairy caterpillars were uniformly rejected; five\r\ndistinct species were quite unnoticed by all his birds, and were allowed\r\nto crawl about the aviary for days with impunity. The spiny caterpillars\r\nof the Tortoiseshell and Peacock butterflies were equally rejected; but\r\nin both these cases Mr. Weir thinks it is the taste, not the hairs or\r\nspines, that are disagreeable, because some very young caterpillars of a\r\nhairy species were rejected although no hairs were developed, and the\r\nsmooth pupæ of the above-named butterflies were refused as persistently\r\nas the spined larvæ. In these cases, then, both hairs and spines would\r\nseem to be mere signs of uneatableness.\r\n\r\nHis next experiments were with those smooth gaily-coloured caterpillars\r\nwhich never conceal themselves, but on the contrary appear to court\r\nobservation. Such are those of the Magpie moth (Abraxas grossulariata),\r\nwhose caterpillar is conspicuously white and black spotted--the Diloba\r\ncoeruleocephala, whose larvæ is pale yellow with a broad blue or green\r\nlateral band--the Cucullia verbasci, whose larvæ is greenish white with\r\nyellow bands and black spots, and Anthrocera filipendulæ (the six spot\r\nBurnet moth), whose caterpillar is yellow with black spots. These were\r\ngiven to the birds at various times, sometimes mixed with other kinds of\r\nlarvæ which were greedily eaten, but they were in every case rejected\r\napparently unnoticed, and were left to crawl about till they died.\r\n\r\nThe next set of observations were on the dull-coloured and protected\r\nlarvæ, and the results of numerous experiments are thus summarised by\r\nMr. Weir. \"All caterpillars whose habits are nocturnal, which are dull\r\ncoloured, with fleshy bodies and smooth skins, are eaten with the\r\ngreatest avidity. Every species of green caterpillar is also much\r\nrelished. All Geometræ, whose larvæ resemble twigs as they stand out\r\nfrom the plant on their anal prolegs, are invariably eaten.\"\r\n\r\nAt the same meeting Mr. A. G. Butler, of the British Museum,\r\ncommunicated the results of his observations with lizards, frogs, and\r\nspiders, which strikingly corroborate those of Mr. Weir. Three green\r\nlizards (Lacerta viridis) which he kept for several years, were very\r\nvoracious, eating all kinds of food, from a lemon cheesecake to a\r\nspider, and devouring flies, caterpillars, and humble bees; yet there\r\nwere some caterpillars and moths which they would seize only to drop\r\nimmediately. Among these the principal were the caterpillar of the\r\nMagpie moth (Abraxas grossulariata) and the perfect six spot Burnet moth\r\n(Anthrocera filipendulæ). These would be first seized but invariably\r\ndropped in disgust, and afterwards left unmolested. Subsequently frogs\r\nwere kept and fed with caterpillars from the garden, but two of\r\nthese--that of the before-mentioned Magpie moth, and that of the V. moth\r\n(Halia wavaria), which is green with conspicuous white or yellow stripes\r\nand black spots--were constantly rejected. When these species were first\r\noffered, the frogs sprang at them eagerly and licked them into their\r\nmouths; no sooner, however, had they done so than they seemed to be\r\naware of the mistake that they had made, and sat with gaping mouths,\r\nrolling their tongues about until they had got quit of the nauseous\r\nmorsels.\r\n\r\nWith spiders the same thing occurred. These two caterpillars were\r\nrepeatedly put into the webs both of the geometrical and hunting spiders\r\n(Epeira diadema and Lycosa sp.), but in the former case they were cut\r\nout and allowed to drop; in the latter, after disappearing in the jaws\r\nof their captor down his dark silken funnel, they invariably reappeared,\r\neither from below or else taking long strides up the funnel again. Mr.\r\nButler has observed lizards fight with and finally devour humble bees,\r\nand a frog sitting on a bed of stone-crop leap up and catch the bees\r\nwhich flew over his head, and swallow them, in utter disregard of their\r\nstings. It is evident, therefore, that the possession of a disagreeable\r\ntaste or odour is a more effectual protection to certain conspicuous\r\ncaterpillars and moths, than would be even the possession of a sting.\r\n\r\nThe observations of these two gentlemen supply a very remarkable\r\nconfirmation of the hypothetical solution of the difficulty which I had\r\ngiven two years before. And as it is generally acknowledged that the\r\nbest test of the truth and completeness of a theory is the power which\r\nit gives us of prevision, we may I think fairly claim this as a case in\r\nwhich the power of prevision has been successfully exerted, and\r\ntherefore as furnishing a very powerful argument in favour of the truth\r\nof the theory of Natural Selection.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Summary._\r\n\r\nI have now completed a brief, and necessarily very imperfect, survey of\r\nthe various ways in which the external form and colouring of animals is\r\nadapted to be useful to them, either by concealing them from their\r\nenemies or from the creatures they prey upon. It has, I hope, been shown\r\nthat the subject is one of much interest, both as regard a true\r\ncomprehension of the place each animal fills in the economy of nature,\r\nand the means by which it is enabled to maintain that place; and also as\r\nteaching us how important a part is played by the minutest details in\r\nthe structure of animals, and how complicated and delicate is the\r\nequilibrium of the organic world.\r\n\r\nMy exposition of the subject having been necessarily somewhat lengthy\r\nand full of details, it will be as well to recapitulate its main points.\r\n\r\nThere is a general harmony in nature between the colours of an animal\r\nand those of its habitation. Arctic animals are white, desert animals\r\nare sand-coloured; dwellers among leaves and grass are green; nocturnal\r\nanimals are dusky. These colours are not universal, but are very\r\ngeneral, and are seldom reversed. Going on a little further, we find\r\nbirds, reptiles, and insects, so tinted and mottled as exactly to match\r\nthe rock, or bark, or leaf, or flower, they are accustomed to rest\r\nupon,--and thereby effectually concealed. Another step in advance, and\r\nwe have insects which are formed as well as coloured so as exactly to\r\nresemble particular leaves, or sticks, or mossy twigs, or flowers; and\r\nin these cases very peculiar habits and instincts come into play to aid\r\nin the deception and render the concealment more complete. We now enter\r\nupon a new phase of the phenomena, and come to creatures whose colours\r\nneither conceal them nor make them like vegetable or mineral substances;\r\non the contrary, they are conspicuous enough, but they completely\r\nresemble some other creature of a quite different group, while they\r\ndiffer much in outward appearance from those with which all essential\r\nparts of their organization show them to be really closely allied. They\r\nappear like actors or masqueraders dressed up and painted for amusement,\r\nor like swindlers endeavouring to pass themselves off for well-known and\r\nrespectable members of society. What is the meaning of this strange\r\ntravestie? Does Nature descend to imposture or masquerade? We answer,\r\nshe does not. Her principles are too severe. There is a use in every\r\ndetail of her handiwork. The resemblance of one animal to another is of\r\nexactly the same essential nature as the resemblance to a leaf, or to\r\nbark, or to desert sand, and answers exactly the same purpose. In the\r\none case the enemy will not attack the leaf or the bark, and so the\r\ndisguise is a safeguard; in the other case it is found that for various\r\nreasons the creature resembled is passed over, and not attacked by the\r\nusual enemies of its order, and thus the creature that resembles it has\r\nan equally effectual safeguard. We are plainly shown that the disguise\r\nis of the same nature in the two cases, by the occurrence in the same\r\ngroup of one species resembling a vegetable substance, while another\r\nresembles a living animal of another group; and we know that the\r\ncreatures resembled, possess an immunity from attack, by their being\r\nalways very abundant, by their being conspicuous and not concealing\r\nthemselves, and by their having generally no visible means of escape\r\nfrom their enemies; while, at the same time, the particular quality that\r\nmakes them disliked is often very clear, such as a nasty taste or an\r\nindigestible hardness. Further examination reveals the fact that, in\r\nseveral cases of both kinds of disguise, it is the female only that is\r\nthus disguised; and as it can be shown that the female needs protection\r\nmuch more than the male, and that her preservation for a much longer\r\nperiod is absolutely necessary for the continuance of the race, we have\r\nan additional indication that the resemblance is in all cases\r\nsubservient to a great purpose--the preservation of the species.\r\n\r\nIn endeavouring to explain these phenomena as having been brought about\r\nby variation and natural selection, we start with the fact that white\r\nvarieties frequently occur, and when protected from enemies show no\r\nincapacity for continued existence and increase. We know, further, that\r\nvarieties of many other tints occasionally occur; and as \"the survival\r\nof the fittest\" must inevitably weed out those whose colours are\r\nprejudicial and preserve those whose colours are a safeguard, we require\r\nno other mode of accounting for the protective tints of arctic and\r\ndesert animals. But this being granted, there is such a perfectly\r\ncontinuous and graduated series of examples of every kind of protective\r\nimitation, up to the most wonderful cases of what is termed \"mimicry,\"\r\nthat we can find no place at which to draw the line, and say,--so far\r\nvariation and natural selection will account for the phenomena, but for\r\nall the rest we require a more potent cause. The counter theories that\r\nhave been proposed, that of the \"special creation\" of each imitative\r\nform, that of the action of \"similar conditions of existence\" for some\r\nof the cases, and of the laws of \"hereditary descent and the reversion\r\nto ancestral forms\" for others,--have all been shown to be beset with\r\ndifficulties, and the two latter to be directly contradicted by some of\r\nthe most constant and most remarkable of the facts to be accounted for.\r\n\r\n\r\n_General deductions as to Colour in Nature._\r\n\r\nThe important part that \"protective resemblance\" has played in\r\ndetermining the colours and markings of many groups of animals, will\r\nenable us to understand the meaning of one of the most striking facts in\r\nnature, the uniformity in the colours of the vegetable as compared with\r\nthe wonderful diversity of the animal world. There appears no good\r\nreason why trees and shrubs should not have been adorned with as many\r\nvaried hues and as strikingly designed patterns as birds and\r\nbutterflies, since the gay colours of flowers show that there is no\r\nincapacity in vegetable tissues to exhibit them. But even flowers\r\nthemselves present us with none of those wonderful designs, those\r\ncomplicated arrangements of stripes and dots and patches of colour,\r\nthat harmonious blending of hues in lines and bands and shaded spots,\r\nwhich are so general a feature in insects. It is the opinion of Mr.\r\nDarwin that we owe much of the beauty of flowers to the necessity of\r\nattracting insects to aid in their fertilisation, and that much of the\r\ndevelopment of colour in the animal world is due to \"sexual selection,\"\r\ncolour being universally attractive, and thus leading to its propagation\r\nand increase; but while fully admitting this, it will be evident from\r\nthe facts and arguments here brought forward, that very much of the\r\n_variety_ both of colour and markings among animals is due to the\r\nsupreme importance of concealment, and thus the various tints of\r\nminerals and vegetables have been directly reproduced in the animal\r\nkingdom, and again and again modified as more special protection became\r\nnecessary. We shall thus have two causes for the development of colour\r\nin the animal world, and shall be better enabled to understand how, by\r\ntheir combined and separate action, the immense variety we now behold\r\nhas been produced. Both causes, however, will come under the general law\r\nof \"Utility,\" the advocacy of which, in its broadest sense, we owe\r\nalmost entirely to Mr. Darwin. A more accurate knowledge of the varied\r\nphenomena connected with this subject may not improbably give us some\r\ninformation both as to the senses and the mental faculties of the lower\r\nanimals. For it is evident that if colours which please us also attract\r\nthem, and if the various disguises which have been here enumerated are\r\nequally deceptive to them as to ourselves, then both their powers of\r\nvision and their faculties of perception and emotion, must be\r\nessentially of the same nature as our own--a fact of high philosophical\r\nimportance in the study of our own nature and our true relations to the\r\nlower animals.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Conclusion._\r\n\r\nAlthough such a variety of interesting facts have been already\r\naccumulated, the subject we have been discussing is one of which\r\ncomparatively little is really known. The natural history of the tropics\r\nhas never yet been studied on the spot with a full appreciation of \"what\r\nto observe\" in this matter. The varied ways in which the colouring and\r\nform of animals serve for their protection, their strange disguises as\r\nvegetable or mineral substances, their wonderful mimicry of other\r\nbeings, offer an almost unworked and inexhaustible field of discovery\r\nfor the zoologist, and will assuredly throw much light on the laws and\r\nconditions which have resulted in the wonderful variety of colour,\r\nshade, and marking which constitutes one of the most pleasing\r\ncharacteristics of the animal world, but the immediate causes of which\r\nit has hitherto been most difficult to explain.\r\n\r\nIf I have succeeded in showing that in this wide and picturesque domain\r\nof nature, results which have hitherto been supposed to depend either\r\nupon those incalculable combinations of laws which we term chance or\r\nupon the direct volition of the Creator, are really due to the action\r\nof comparatively well-known and simple causes, I shall have attained my\r\npresent purpose, which has been to extend the interest so generally felt\r\nin the more striking facts of natural history to a large class of\r\ncurious but much neglected details; and to further, in however slight a\r\ndegree, our knowledge of the subjection of the phenomena of life to the\r\n\"Reign of Law.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.\r\n\r\nTHE MALAYAN PAPILIONIDÆ OR SWALLOW-TAILED BUTTERFLIES, AS ILLUSTRATIVE\r\nOF THE THEORY OF NATURAL SELECTION.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Special Value of the Diurnal Lepidoptera for enquiries of this nature._\r\n\r\nWhen the naturalist studies the habits, the structure, or the affinities\r\nof animals, it matters little to which group he especially devotes\r\nhimself; all alike offer him endless materials for observation and\r\nresearch. But, for the purpose of investigating the phenomena of\r\ngeographical distribution and of local, sexual, or general variation,\r\nthe several groups differ greatly in their value and importance. Some\r\nhave too limited a range, others are not sufficiently varied in specific\r\nforms, while, what is of most importance, many groups have not received\r\nthat amount of attention over the whole region they inhabit, which could\r\nfurnish materials sufficiently approaching to completeness to enable us\r\nto arrive at any accurate conclusions as to the phenomena they present\r\nas a whole. It is in those groups which are, and have long been,\r\nfavourites with collectors, that the student of distribution and\r\nvariation will find his materials the most satisfactory, from their\r\ncomparative completeness.\r\n\r\nPre-eminent among such groups are the diurnal Lepidoptera or\r\nButterflies, whose extreme beauty and endless diversity have led to\r\ntheir having been assiduously collected in all parts of the world, and\r\nto the numerous species and varieties having been figured in a series of\r\nmagnificent works, from those of Cramer, the contemporary of Linnæus,\r\ndown to the inimitable productions of our own Hewitson.[G] But, besides\r\ntheir abundance, their universal distribution, and the great attention\r\nthat has been paid to them, these insects have other qualities that\r\nespecially adapt them to elucidate the branches of inquiry already\r\nalluded to. These are, the immense development and peculiar structure of\r\nthe wings, which not only vary in form more than those of any other\r\ninsects, but offer on both surfaces an endless variety of pattern,\r\ncolouring, and texture. The scales, with which they are more or less\r\ncompletely covered, imitate the rich hues and delicate surfaces of satin\r\nor of velvet, glitter with metallic lustre, or glow with the changeable\r\ntints of the opal. This delicately painted surface acts as a register of\r\nthe minutest differences of organization--a shade of colour, an\r\nadditional streak or spot, a slight modification of outline continually\r\nrecurring with the greatest regularity and fixity, while the body and\r\nall its other members exhibit no appreciable change. The wings of\r\nButterflies, as Mr. Bates has well put it, \"serve as a tablet on which\r\nNature writes the story of the modifications of species;\" they enable us\r\nto perceive changes that would otherwise be uncertain and difficult of\r\nobservation, and exhibit to us on an enlarged scale the effects of the\r\nclimatal and other physical conditions which influence more or less\r\nprofoundly the organization of every living thing.\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  | [G] W.

The Lepidoptera are all vegetable-feeders in their\r\nlarva-state, and suckers of juices or other liquids in their perfect\r\nform. In their most widely separated groups they differ but little from\r\na common type, and offer comparatively unimportant modifications of\r\nstructure or of habits. The Coleoptera, the Diptera, or the Hymenoptera,\r\non the other hand, present far greater and more essential variations. In\r\neither of these orders we have both vegetable and animal-feeders,\r\naquatic, and terrestrial, and parasitic groups. Whole families are\r\ndevoted to special departments in the economy of nature. Seeds, fruits,\r\nbones, carcases, excrement, bark, have each their special and dependent\r\ninsect tribes from among them; whereas the Lepidoptera are, with but few\r\nexceptions, confined to the one function of devouring the foliage of\r\nliving vegetation. We might therefore anticipate that their\r\nspecies--population would be only equal to that of sections of the other\r\norders having a similar uniform mode of existence; and the fact that\r\ntheir numbers are at all comparable with those of entire orders, so much\r\nmore varied in organization and habits, is, I think, a proof that they\r\nare in general highly susceptible of specific modification.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Question of the rank of the Papilionidæ._\r\n\r\nThe Papilionidæ are a family of diurnal Lepidoptera which have hitherto,\r\nby almost universal consent, held the first rank in the order; and\r\nthough this position has recently been denied them, I cannot altogether\r\nacquiesce in the reasoning by which it has been proposed to degrade them\r\nto a lower rank. In Mr. Bates's most excellent paper on the Heliconidæ,\r\n(published in the Transactions of the Linnæan Society, vol. xxiii., p.\r\n495) he claims for that family the highest position, chiefly because of\r\nthe imperfect structure of the fore legs, which is there carried to an\r\nextreme degree of abortion, and thus removes them further than any other\r\nfamily from the Hesperidæ and Heterocera, which all have perfect legs.\r\nNow it is a question whether any amount of difference which is exhibited\r\nmerely in the imperfection or abortion of certain organs, can establish\r\nin the group exhibiting it a claim to a high grade of organization,\r\nstill less can this be allowed when another group along with perfection\r\nof structure in the same organs, exhibits modifications peculiar to it,\r\ntogether with the possession of an organ which in the remainder of the\r\norder is altogether wanting. This is, however, the position of the\r\nPapilionidæ. The perfect insects possess two characters quite peculiar\r\nto them. Mr. Edward Doubleday, in his \"Genera of Diurnal Lepidoptera,\"\r\nsays, \"The Papilionidæ may be known by the apparently four-branched\r\nmedian nervule and the spur on the anterior tibiæ, characters found in\r\nno other family.\" The four-branched median nervule is a character so\r\nconstant, so peculiar, and so well marked, as to enable a person to\r\ntell, at a glance at the wings only of a butterfly, whether it does or\r\ndoes not belong to this family; and I am not aware that any other group\r\nof butterflies, at all comparable to this in extent and modifications of\r\nform, possesses a character in its neuration to which the same degree of\r\ncertainty can be attached. The spur on the anterior tibiæ is also found\r\nin some of the Hesperidæ, and is therefore supposed to show a direct\r\naffinity between the two groups: but I do not imagine it can\r\ncounterbalance the differences in neuration and in every other part of\r\ntheir organization. The most characteristic feature of the Papilionidæ,\r\nhowever, and that on which I think insufficient stress has been laid, is\r\nundoubtedly the peculiar structure of the larvæ. These all possess an\r\nextraordinary organ situated on the neck, the well-known Y-shaped\r\ntentacle, which is entirely concealed in a state of repose, but which is\r\ncapable of being suddenly thrown out by the insect when alarmed. When we\r\nconsider this singular apparatus, which in some species is nearly half\r\nan inch long, the arrangement of muscles for its protrusion and\r\nretraction, its perfect concealment during repose, its blood-red colour,\r\nand the suddenness with which it can be thrown out, we must, I think, be\r\nled to the conclusion that it serves as a protection to the larva, by\r\nstartling and frightening away some enemy when about to seize it, and is\r\nthus one of the causes which has led to the wide extension and\r\nmaintained the permanence of this now dominant group. Those who believe\r\nthat such peculiar structures can only have arisen by very minute\r\nsuccessive variations, each one advantageous to its possessor, must see,\r\nin the possession of such an organ by one group, and its complete\r\nabsence in every other, a proof of a very ancient origin and of very\r\nlong-continued modification. And such a positive structural addition to\r\nthe organization of the family, subserving an important function, seems\r\nto me alone sufficient to warrant us in considering the Papilionidæ as\r\nthe most highly developed portion of the whole order, and thus in\r\nretaining it in the position which the size, strength, beauty, and\r\ngeneral structure of the perfect insects have been generally thought to\r\ndeserve.\r\n\r\nIn Mr. Trimen's paper on \"Mimetic Analogies among African Butterflies,\"\r\nin the Transactions of the Linnæan Society, for 1868, he has argued\r\nstrongly in favour of Mr. Bates' views as to the higher position of the\r\nDanaidæ and the lower grade of the Papilionidæ, and has adduced, among\r\nother facts, the undoubted resemblance of the pupa of Parnassius, a\r\ngenus of Papilionidæ, to that of some Hesperidæ and moths. I admit,\r\ntherefore, that he has proved the Papilionidæ to have retained several\r\ncharacters of the nocturnal Lepidoptera which the Danaidæ have lost, but\r\nI deny that they are therefore to be considered lower in the scale of\r\norganization. Other characters may be pointed out which indicate that\r\nthey are farther removed from the moths even than the Danaidæ. The club\r\nof the antennæ is the most prominent and most constant feature by which\r\nbutterflies may be distinguished from moths, and of all butterflies the\r\nPapilionidæ have the most beautiful and most perfectly developed clubbed\r\nantennæ. Again, butterflies and moths are broadly characterised by their\r\ndiurnal and nocturnal habits respectively, and the Papilionidæ, with\r\ntheir close allies the Pieridæ, are the most pre-eminently diurnal of\r\nbutterflies, most of them lovers of sunshine, and not presenting a\r\nsingle crepuscular species. The great group of the Nymphalidæ, on the\r\nother hand (in which Mr. Bates includes the Danaidæ and Heliconidæ as\r\nsub-families), contains an entire sub-family (Brassolidæ) and a number\r\nof genera, such as Thaumantis, Zeuxidia, Pavonia, &c., of crepuscular\r\nhabits, while a large proportion of the Satyridæ and many of the\r\nDanaidæ are shade-loving butterflies. This question, of what is to be\r\nconsidered the highest type of any group of organisms, is one of such\r\ngeneral interest to naturalists that it will be well to consider it a\r\nlittle further, by a comparison of the Lepidoptera with some groups of\r\nthe higher animals.\r\n\r\nMr. Trimen's argument, that the lepidopterous type, like that of birds,\r\nbeing pre-eminently aërial, \"therefore a diminution of the ambulatory\r\norgans, instead of being a sign of inferiority, may very possibly\r\nindicate a higher, because a more thoroughly aërial form,\" is certainly\r\nunsound, for it would imply that the most aërial of birds (the swift and\r\nthe frigate-birds, for example) are the highest in the scale of\r\nbird-organization, and the more so on account of their feet being very\r\nill adapted for walking. But no ornithologist has ever so classed them,\r\nand the claim to the highest rank among birds is only disputed between\r\nthree groups, all very far removed from these. They are--1st. The\r\nFalcons, on account of their general perfection, their rapid flight,\r\ntheir piercing vision, their perfect feet armed with retractile claws,\r\nthe beauty of their forms, and the ease and rapidity of their motions;\r\n2nd. The Parrots, whose feet, though ill-fitted for walking, are perfect\r\nas prehensile organs, and which possess large brains with great\r\nintelligence, though but moderate powers of flight; and, 3rd. The\r\nThrushes or Crows, as typical of the perching birds, on account of the\r\nwell-balanced development of their whole structure, in which no organ\r\nor function has attained an undue prominence.\r\n\r\nTurning now to the Mammalia, it might be argued that as they are\r\npre-eminently the terrestrial type of vertebrates, to walk and run well\r\nis essential to the typical perfection of the group; but this would give\r\nthe superiority to the horse, the deer, or the hunting leopard, instead\r\nof to the Quadrumana. We seem here to have quite a case in point, for\r\none group of Quadrumana, the Lemurs, is undoubtedly nearer to the low\r\nInsectivora and Marsupials than the Carnivora or the Ungulata, as shown\r\namong other characters by the Opossums possessing a hand with perfect\r\nopposable thumb, closely resembling that of some of the Lemurs; and by\r\nthe curious Galeopithecus, which is sometimes classed as a Lemur, and\r\nsometimes with the Insectivora. Again, the implacental mammals,\r\nincluding the Ornithodelphia and the Marsupials, are admitted to be\r\nlower than the placental series. But one of the distinguishing\r\ncharacters of the Marsupials is that the young are born blind and\r\nexceedingly imperfect, and it might therefore be argued that those\r\norders in which the young are born most perfect are the highest, because\r\nfarthest from the low Marsupial type. This would make the Ruminants and\r\nUngulata higher than the Quadrumana or the Carnivora. But the Mammalia\r\noffer a still more remarkable illustration of the fallacy of this mode\r\nof reasoning, for if there is one character more than another which is\r\nessential and distinctive of the class, it is that from which it derives\r\nits name, the possession of mammary glands and the power of suckling\r\nthe young. What more reasonable, apparently, than to argue that the\r\ngroup in which this important function is most developed, that in which\r\nthe young are most dependent upon it, and for the longest period, must\r\nbe the highest in the Mammalian scale of organization? Yet this group is\r\nthe Marsupial, in which the young commence suckling in a foetal\r\ncondition, and continue to do so till they are fully developed, and are\r\ntherefore for a long time absolutely dependent on this mode of\r\nnourishment.\r\n\r\nThese examples, I think, demonstrate that we cannot settle the rank of a\r\ngroup by a consideration of the degree in which certain characters\r\nresemble or differ from those in what is admitted to be a lower group;\r\nand they also show that the highest group of a class may be more closely\r\nconnected to one of the lowest, than some other groups which have\r\ndeveloped laterally and diverged farther from the parent type, but which\r\nyet, owing to want of balance or too great specialization in their\r\nstructure, have never reached a high grade of organization. The\r\nQuadrumana afford a very valuable illustration, because, owing to their\r\nundoubted affinity with man, we feel certain that they are really higher\r\nthan any other order of Mammalia, while at the same time they are more\r\ndistinctly allied to the lowest groups than many others. The case of the\r\nPapilionidæ seems to me so exactly parallel to this, that, while I admit\r\nall the proofs of affinity with the undoubtedly lower groups of\r\nHesperidæ and moths, I yet maintain that, owing to the complete and\r\neven development of every part of their organization, these insects best\r\nrepresent the highest perfection to which the butterfly type has\r\nattained, and deserve to be placed at its head in every system of\r\nclassification.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Distribution of the Papilionidæ._\r\n\r\nThe Papilionidæ are pretty widely distributed over the earth, but are\r\nespecially abundant in the tropics, where they attain their maximum of\r\nsize and beauty, and the greatest variety of form and colouring. South\r\nAmerica, North India, and the Malay Islands are the regions where these\r\nfine insects occur in the greatest profusion, and where they actually\r\nbecome a not unimportant feature in the scenery. In the Malay Islands in\r\nparticular, the giant Ornithopteræ may be frequently seen about the\r\nborders of the cultivated and forest districts, their large size,\r\nstately flight, and gorgeous colouring rendering them even more\r\nconspicuous than the generality of birds. In the shady suburbs of the\r\ntown of Malacca two large and handsome Papilios (Memnon and Nephelus)\r\nare not uncommon, flapping with irregular flight along the roadways, or,\r\nin the early morning, expanding their wings to the invigorating rays of\r\nthe sun. In Amboyna and other towns of the Moluccas, the magnificent\r\nDeiphobus and Severus, and occasionally even the azure-winged Ulysses,\r\nfrequent similar situations, fluttering about the orange-trees and\r\nflower-beds, or sometimes even straying into the narrow bazaars or\r\ncovered markets of the city. In Java the golden-dusted Arjuna may often\r\nbe seen at damp places on the roadside in the mountain districts, in\r\ncompany with Sarpedon, Bathycles, and Agamemnon, and less frequently the\r\nbeautiful swallow-tailed Antiphates. In the more luxuriant parts of\r\nthese islands one can hardly take a morning's walk in the neighbourhood\r\nof a town or village without seeing three or four species of Papilio,\r\nand often twice that number. No less than 130 species of the family are\r\nnow known to inhabit the Archipelago, and of these ninety-six were\r\ncollected by myself. Thirty species are found in Borneo, being the\r\nlargest number in any one island, twenty-three species having been\r\nobtained by myself in the vicinity of Sarawak; Java has twenty-eight\r\nspecies; Celebes twenty-four, and the Peninsula of Malacca, twenty-six\r\nspecies. Further east the numbers decrease; Batchian producing\r\nseventeen, and New Guinea only fifteen, though this number is certainly\r\ntoo small, owing to our present imperfect knowledge of that great\r\nisland.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Definition of the word Species._\r\n\r\nIn estimating these numbers I have had the usual difficulty to\r\nencounter, of determining what to consider species and what varieties.\r\nThe Malayan region, consisting of a large number of islands of generally\r\ngreat antiquity, possesses, compared to its actual area, a great number\r\nof distinct forms, often indeed distinguished by very slight\r\ncharacters, but in most cases so constant in large series of specimens,\r\nand so easily separable from each other, that I know not on what\r\nprinciple we can refuse to give them the name and rank of species. One\r\nof the best and most orthodox definitions is that of Pritchard, the\r\ngreat ethnologist, who says, that \"_separate origin and distinctness of\r\nrace, evinced by a constant transmission of some characteristic\r\npeculiarity of organization_,\" constitutes a species. Now leaving out\r\nthe question of \"origin,\" which we cannot determine, and taking only the\r\nproof of separate origin, \"_the constant transmission of some\r\ncharacteristic peculiarity of organization_,\" we have a definition which\r\nwill compel us to neglect altogether the _amount_ of difference between\r\nany two forms, and to consider only whether the differences that present\r\nthemselves are _permanent_. The rule, therefore, I have endeavoured to\r\nadopt is, that when the difference between two forms inhabiting separate\r\nareas seems quite constant, when it can be defined in words, and when it\r\nis not confined to a single peculiarity only, I have considered such\r\nforms to be species. When, however, the individuals of each locality\r\nvary among themselves, so as to cause the distinctions between the two\r\nforms to become inconsiderable and indefinite, or where the differences,\r\nthough constant, are confined to one particular only, such as size,\r\ntint, or a single point of difference in marking or in outline, I class\r\none of the forms as a variety of the other.\r\n\r\nI find as a general rule that the constancy of species is in an inverse\r\nratio to their range. Those which are confined to one or two islands are\r\ngenerally very constant. When they extend to many islands, considerable\r\nvariability appears; and when they have an extensive range over a large\r\npart of the Archipelago, the amount of unstable variation is very large.\r\nThese facts are explicable on Mr. Darwin's principles. When a species\r\nexists over a wide area, it must have had, and probably still possesses,\r\ngreat powers of dispersion. Under the different conditions of existence\r\nin various portions of its area, different variations from the type\r\nwould be selected, and, were they completely isolated, would soon become\r\ndistinctly modified forms; but this process is checked by the dispersive\r\npowers of the whole species, which leads to the more or less frequent\r\nintermixture of the incipient varieties, which thus become irregular and\r\nunstable. Where, however, a species has a limited range, it indicates\r\nless active powers of dispersion, and the process of modification under\r\nchanged conditions is less interfered with. The species will therefore\r\nexist under one or more permanent forms according as portions of it have\r\nbeen isolated at a more or less remote period.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Laws and Modes of Variation._\r\n\r\nWhat is commonly called variation consists of several distinct phenomena\r\nwhich have been too often confounded. I shall proceed to consider these\r\nunder the heads of--1st, simple variability; 2nd, polymorphism; 3rd,\r\nlocal forms; 4th, co-existing varieties; 5th, races or subspecies; and\r\n6th, true species.\r\n\r\n1. _Simple variability._--Under this head I include all those cases in\r\nwhich the specific form is to some extent unstable. Throughout the whole\r\nrange of the species, and even in the progeny of individuals, there\r\noccur continual and uncertain differences of form, analogous to that\r\nvariability which is so characteristic of domestic breeds. It is\r\nimpossible usefully to define any of these forms, because there are\r\nindefinite gradations to each other form. Species which possess these\r\ncharacteristics have always a wide range, and are more frequently the\r\ninhabitants of continents than of islands, though such cases are always\r\nexceptional, it being far more common for specific forms to be fixed\r\nwithin very narrow limits of variation. The only good example of this\r\nkind of variability which occurs among the Malayan Papilionidæ is in\r\nPapilio Severus, a species inhabiting all the islands of the Moluccas\r\nand New Guinea, and exhibiting in each of them a greater amount of\r\nindividual difference than often serves to distinguish well-marked\r\nspecies. Almost equally remarkable are the variations exhibited in most\r\nof the species of Ornithoptera, which I have found in some cases to\r\nextend even to the form of the wing and the arrangement of the nervures.\r\nClosely allied, however, to these variable species are others which,\r\nthough differing slightly from them, are constant and confined to\r\nlimited areas. After satisfying oneself, by the examination of numerous\r\nspecimens captured in their native countries, that the one set of\r\nindividuals are variable and the others are not, it becomes evident that\r\nby classing all alike as varieties of one species we shall be obscuring\r\nan important fact in nature; and that the only way to exhibit that fact\r\nin its true light is to treat the invariable local form as a distinct\r\nspecies, even though it does not offer better distinguishing characters\r\nthan do the extreme forms of the variable species. Cases of this kind\r\nare the Ornithoptera Priamus, which is confined to the islands of Ceram\r\nand Amboyna, and is very constant in both sexes, while the allied\r\nspecies inhabiting New Guinea and the Papuan Islands is exceedingly\r\nvariable; and in the island of Celebes is a species closely allied to\r\nthe variable P. Severus, but which, being exceedingly constant, I have\r\ndescribed as a distinct species under the name of Papilio Pertinax.\r\n\r\n2. _Polymorphism or dimorphism._--By this term I understand the\r\nco-existence in the same locality of two or more distinct forms, not\r\nconnected by intermediate gradations, and all of which are occasionally\r\nproduced from common parents. These distinct forms generally occur in\r\nthe female sex only, and their offspring, instead of being hybrids, or\r\nlike the two parents, appear to reproduce all the distinct forms in\r\nvarying proportions. I believe it will be found that a considerable\r\nnumber of what have been classed as _varieties_ are really cases of\r\npolymorphism. Albinoism and melanism are of this character, as well as\r\nmost of those cases in which well-marked varieties occur in company with\r\nthe parent species, but without any intermediate forms. If these\r\ndistinct forms breed independently, and are never reproduced from a\r\ncommon parent, they must be considered as separate species, contact\r\nwithout intermixture being a good test of specific difference. On the\r\nother hand, intercrossing without producing an intermediate race is a\r\ntest of dimorphism. I consider, therefore, that under any circumstances\r\nthe term \"variety\" is wrongly applied to such cases.\r\n\r\nThe Malayan Papilionidæ exhibit some very curious instances of\r\npolymorphism, some of which have been recorded as varieties, others as\r\ndistinct species; and they all occur in the female sex. Papilio Memnon\r\nis one of the most striking, as it exhibits the mixture of simple\r\nvariability, local and polymorphic forms, all hitherto classed under the\r\ncommon title of varieties. The polymorphism is strikingly exhibited by\r\nthe females, one set of which resemble the males in form, with a\r\nvariable paler colouring; the others have a large spatulate tail to the\r\nhinder wings and a distinct style of colouring, which causes them\r\nclosely to resemble P. Coon, a species having the two sexes alike and\r\ninhabiting the same countries, but with which they have no direct\r\naffinity. The tailless females exhibit simple variability, scarcely two\r\nbeing found exactly alike even in the same locality. The males of the\r\nisland of Borneo exhibit constant differences of the under surface, and\r\nmay therefore be distinguished as a local form, while the continental\r\nspecimens, as a whole, offer such large and constant differences from\r\nthose of the islands, that I am inclined to separate them as a distinct\r\nspecies, to which the name P. Androgeus (Cramer) may be applied. We\r\nhave here, therefore, distinct species, local forms, polymorphism, and\r\nsimple variability, which seem to me to be distinct phenomena, but which\r\nhave been hitherto all classed together as varieties. I may mention that\r\nthe fact of these distinct forms being one species is doubly proved. The\r\nmales, the tailed and tailless females, have all been bred from a single\r\ngroup of the larvæ, by Messrs. Payen and Bocarmé, in Java, and I myself\r\ncaptured, in Sumatra, a male P. Memnon, and a tailed female P. Achates,\r\nunder circumstances which led me to class them as the same species.\r\n\r\nPapilio Pammon offers a somewhat similar case. The female was described\r\nby Linnæus as P. Polytes, and was considered to be a distinct species\r\ntill Westermann bred the two from the same larvæ (see Boisduval,\r\n\"Species Général des Lépidoptères,\" p. 272). They were therefore classed\r\nas sexes of one species by Mr. Edward Doubleday, in his \"Genera of\r\nDiurnal Lepidoptera,\" in 1846. Later, female specimens were received\r\nfrom India closely resembling the male insect, and this was held to\r\noverthrow the authority of M. Westermann's observation, and to\r\nre-establish P. Polytes as a distinct species; and as such it\r\naccordingly appears in the British Museum List of Papilionidæ in 1856,\r\nand in the Catalogue of the East India Museum in 1857. This discrepancy\r\nis explained by the fact of P. Pammon having two females, one closely\r\nresembling the male, while the other is totally different from it. A\r\nlong familiarity with this insect (which replaced by local forms or by\r\nclosely allied species, occurs in every island of the Archipelago) has\r\nconvinced me of the correctness of this statement; for in every place\r\nwhere a male allied to P. Pammon is found, a female resembling P.\r\nPolytes also occurs, and sometimes, though less frequently than on the\r\ncontinent, another female closely resembling the male: while not only\r\nhas no male specimen of P. Polytes yet been discovered, but the female\r\n(Polytes) has never yet been found in localities to which the male\r\n(Pammon) does not extend. In this case, as in the last, distinct\r\nspecies, local forms, and dimorphic specimens, have been confounded\r\nunder the common appellation of varieties.\r\n\r\nBut, besides the true P. Polytes, there are several allied forms of\r\nfemales to be considered, namely, P. Theseus (Cramer), P. Molanides (De\r\nHaan), P. Elyros (G. R. Gray), and P. Romulus (Linnæus). The dark female\r\nfigured by Cramer as P. Theseus seems to be the common and perhaps the\r\nonly form in Sumatra, whereas in Java, Borneo, and Timor, along with\r\nmales quite identical with those of Sumatra, occur females of the\r\nPolytes form, although a single specimen of the true P. Theseus taken at\r\nLombock would seem to show that the two forms do occur together. In the\r\nallied species found in the Philippine Islands (P. Alphenor, Cramer = P.\r\nLedebouria, Eschscholtz, the female of which is P. Elyros, G. R. Gray,)\r\nforms corresponding to these extremes occur, along with a number of\r\nintermediate varieties, as shown by a fine series in the British Museum.\r\nWe have here an indication of how dimorphism may be produced; for let\r\nthe extreme Philippine forms be better suited to their conditions of\r\nexistence than the intermediate connecting links, and the latter will\r\ngradually die out, leaving two distinct forms of the same insect, each\r\nadapted to some special conditions. As these conditions are sure to vary\r\nin different districts, it will often happen, as in Sumatra and Java,\r\nthat the one form will predominate in the one island, the other in the\r\nadjacent one. In the island of Borneo there seems to be a third form;\r\nfor P. Melanides (De Haan) evidently belongs to this group, and has all\r\nthe chief characteristics of P. Theseus, with a modified colouration of\r\nthe hind wings. I now come to an insect which, if I am correct, offers\r\none of the most interesting cases of variation yet adduced. Papilio\r\nRomulus, a butterfly found over a large part of India and Ceylon, and\r\nnot uncommon in collections, has always been considered a true and\r\nindependent species, and no suspicions have been expressed regarding it.\r\nBut a male of this form does not, I believe, exist. I have examined the\r\nfine series in the British Museum, in the East India Company's Museum,\r\nin the Hope Museum at Oxford, in Mr. Hewitson's and several other\r\nprivate collections, and can find nothing but females; and for this\r\ncommon butterfly no male partner can be found except the equally common\r\nP. Pammon, a species already provided with two wives, and yet to whom we\r\nshall be forced, I believe, to assign a third. On carefully examining P.\r\nRomulus, I find that in all essential characters--the form and texture\r\nof the wings, the length of the antennæ, the spotting of the head and\r\nthorax, and even the peculiar tints and shades with which it is\r\nornamented--it corresponds exactly with the other females of the Pammon\r\ngroup; and though, from the peculiar marking of the fore wings, it has\r\nat first sight a very different aspect, yet a closer examination shows\r\nthat every one of its markings could be produced by slight and almost\r\nimperceptible modifications of the various allied forms. I fully\r\nbelieve, therefore, that I shall be correct in placing P. Romulus as a\r\nthird Indian form of the female P. Pammon, corresponding to P.\r\nMelanides, the third form of the Malayan P. Theseus. I may mention here\r\nthat the females of this group have a superficial resemblance to the\r\nPolydorus group of Papilios, as shown by P. Theseus having been\r\nconsidered to be the female of P. Antiphus, and by P. Romulus being\r\narranged next to P. Hector. There is no close affinity between these two\r\ngroups of Papilio, and I am disposed to believe that we have here a case\r\nof mimicry, brought about by the same causes which Mr. Bates has so well\r\nexplained in his account of the Heliconidæ, and which has led to the\r\nsingular exuberance of polymorphic forms in this and allied groups of\r\nthe genus Papilio. I shall have to devote a section of my essay to the\r\nconsideration of this subject.\r\n\r\nThe third example of polymorphism I have to bring forward is Papilio\r\nOrmenus, which is closely allied to the well-known P. Erechtheus, of\r\nAustralia. The most common form of the female also resembles that of P.\r\nErechtheus; but a totally different-looking insect was found by myself\r\nin the Aru Islands, and figured by Mr. Hewitson under the name of P.\r\nOnesimus, which subsequent observation has convinced me is a second form\r\nof the female of P. Ormenus. Comparison of this with Boisduval's\r\ndescription of P. Amanga, a specimen of which from New Guinea is in the\r\nParis Museum, shows the latter to be a closely similar form; and two\r\nother specimens were obtained by myself, one in the island of Goram and\r\nthe other in Waigiou, all evidently local modifications of the same\r\nform. In each of these localities males and ordinary females of P.\r\nOrmenus were also found. So far there is no evidence that these\r\nlight-coloured insects are not females of a distinct species, the males\r\nof which have not been discovered. But two facts have convinced me this\r\nis not the case. At Dorey, in New Guinea, where males and ordinary\r\nfemales closely allied to P. Ormenus occur (but which seem to me worthy\r\nof being separated as a distinct species), I found one of these\r\nlight-coloured females closely followed in her flight by three males,\r\nexactly in the same manner as occurs (and, I believe, occurs only) with\r\nthe sexes of the same species. After watching them a considerable time,\r\nI captured the whole of them, and became satisfied that I had discovered\r\nthe true relations of this anomalous form. The next year I had\r\ncorroborative proof of the correctness of this opinion by the discovery\r\nin the island of Batchian of a new species allied to P. Ormenus, all the\r\nfemales of which, either seen or captured by me, were of one form, and\r\nmuch more closely resembling the abnormal light-coloured females of P.\r\nOrmenus and P. Pandion than the ordinary specimens of that sex. Every\r\nnaturalist will, I think, agree that this is strongly confirmative of\r\nthe supposition that both forms of female are of one species; and when\r\nwe consider, further, that in four separate islands, in each of which I\r\nresided for several months, the two forms of female were obtained and\r\nonly one form of male ever seen, and that about the same time, M.\r\nMontrouzier in Woodlark Island, at the other extremity of New Guinea\r\n(where he resided several years, and must have obtained all the large\r\nLepidoptera of the island), obtained females closely resembling mine,\r\nwhich, in despair at finding no appropriate partners for them, he mates\r\nwith a widely different species--it becomes, I think, sufficiently\r\nevident this is another case of polymorphism of the same nature as those\r\nalready pointed out in P. Pammon and P. Memnon. This species, however,\r\nis not only dimorphic, but trimorphic; for, in the island of Waigiou, I\r\nobtained a third female quite distinct from either of the others, and in\r\nsome degree intermediate between the ordinary female and the male. The\r\nspecimen is particularly interesting to those who believe, with Mr.\r\nDarwin, that extreme difference of the sexes has been gradually produced\r\nby what he terms sexual selection, since it may be supposed to exhibit\r\none of the intermediate steps in that process, which has been\r\naccidentally preserved in company with its more favoured rivals, though\r\nits extreme rarity (only one specimen having been seen to many hundreds\r\nof the other form) would indicate that it may soon become extinct.\r\n\r\nThe only other case of polymorphism in the genus Papilio, at all equal\r\nin interest to those I have now brought forward, occurs in America; and\r\nwe have, fortunately, accurate information about it. Papilio Turnus is\r\ncommon over almost the whole of temperate North America; and the female\r\nresembles the male very closely. A totally different-looking insect both\r\nin form and colour, Papilio Glaucus, inhabits the same region; and\r\nthough, down to the time when Boisduval published his \"Species Général,\"\r\nno connexion was supposed to exist between the two species, it is now\r\nwell ascertained that P. Glaucus is a second female form of P. Turnus.\r\nIn the \"Proceedings of the Entomological Society of Philadelphia,\" Jan.,\r\n1863, Mr. Walsh gives a very interesting account of the distribution of\r\nthis species. He tells us that in the New England States and in New York\r\nall the females are yellow, while in Illinois and further south all are\r\nblack; in the intermediate region both black and yellow females occur in\r\nvarying proportions. Lat. 37° is approximately the southern limit of the\r\nyellow form, and 42° the northern limit of the black form; and, to\r\nrender the proof complete, both black and yellow insects have been bred\r\nfrom a single batch of eggs. He further states that, out of thousands\r\nof specimens, he has never seen or heard of intermediate varieties\r\nbetween these forms. In this interesting example we see the effects of\r\nlatitude in determining the proportions in which the individuals of each\r\nform should exist. The conditions are _here_ favourable to the one form,\r\n_there_ to the other; but we are by no means to suppose that these\r\nconditions consist in climate alone. It is highly probable that the\r\nexistence of enemies, and of competing forms of life, may be the main\r\ndetermining influences; and it is much to be wished that such a\r\ncompetent observer as Mr. Walsh would endeavour to ascertain what are\r\nthe adverse causes which are most efficient in keeping down the numbers\r\nof each of these contrasted forms.\r\n\r\nDimorphism of this kind in the animal kingdom does not seem to have any\r\ndirect relations to the reproductive powers, as Mr. Darwin has shown to\r\nbe the case in plants, nor does it appear to be very general. One other\r\ncase only is known to me in another family of my eastern Lepidoptera,\r\nthe Pieridæ; and but few occur in the Lepidoptera of other countries.\r\nThe spring and autumn broods of some European species differ very\r\nremarkably; and this must be considered as a phenomenon of an analogous\r\nthough not of an identical nature, while the Araschnia prorsa, of\r\nCentral Europe, is a striking example of this alternate or seasonal\r\ndimorphism. Among our nocturnal Lepidoptera, I am informed, many\r\nanalogous cases occur; and as the whole history of many of these has\r\nbeen investigated by breeding successive generations from the egg, it is\r\nto be hoped that some of our British Lepidopterists will give us a\r\nconnected account of all the abnormal phenomena which they present.\r\nAmong the Coleoptera Mr. Pascoe has pointed out the existence of two\r\nforms of the male sex in seven species of the two genera Xenocerus and\r\nMecocerus belonging to the family Anthribidæ, (Proc. Ent. Soc. Lond.,\r\n1862); and no less than six European Water-beetles, of the genus\r\nDytiscus, have females of two forms, the most common having the elytra\r\ndeeply sulcate, the rarer smooth as in the males. The three, and\r\nsometimes four or more, forms under which many Hymenopterous insects\r\n(especially Ants) occur, must be considered as a related phenomenon,\r\nthough here each form is specialized to a distinct function in the\r\neconomy of the species. Among the higher animals, albinoism and melanism\r\nmay, as I have already stated, be considered as analogous facts; and I\r\nmet with one case of a bird, a species of Lory (Eos fuscata), clearly\r\nexisting under two differently coloured forms, since I obtained both\r\nsexes of each from a single flock, while no intermediate specimens have\r\nyet been found.\r\n\r\nThe fact of the two sexes of one species differing very considerably is\r\nso common, that it attracted but little attention till Mr. Darwin showed\r\nhow it could in many cases be explained by the principle of sexual\r\nselection. For instance, in most polygamous animals the males fight for\r\nthe possession of the females, and the victors, always becoming the\r\nprogenitors of the succeeding generation, impress upon their male\r\noffspring their own superior size, strength, or unusually developed\r\noffensive weapons. It is thus that we can account for the spurs and the\r\nsuperior strength and size of the males in Gallinaceous birds, and also\r\nfor the large canine tusks in the males of fruit-eating Apes. So the\r\nsuperior beauty of plumage and special adornments of the males of so\r\nmany birds can be explained by supposing (what there are many facts to\r\nprove) that the females prefer the most beautiful and perfect-plumaged\r\nmales, and that thus, slight accidental variations of form and colour\r\nhave been accumulated, till they have produced the wonderful train of\r\nthe Peacock and the gorgeous plumage of the Bird of Paradise. Both these\r\ncauses have no doubt acted partially in insects, so many species\r\npossessing horns and powerful jaws in the male sex only, and still more\r\nfrequently the males alone rejoicing in rich colours or sparkling\r\nlustre. But there is here another cause which has led to sexual\r\ndifferences, viz., a special adaptation of the sexes to diverse habits\r\nor modes of life. This is well seen in female Butterflies (which are\r\ngenerally weaker and of slower flight), often having colours better\r\nadapted to concealment; and in certain South American species (Papilio\r\ntorquatus) the females, which inhabit the forests, resemble the Æneas\r\ngroup of Papilios which abound in similar localities, while the males,\r\nwhich frequent the sunny open river-banks, have a totally different\r\ncolouration. In these cases, therefore, natural selection seems to have\r\nacted independently of sexual selection; and all such cases may be\r\nconsidered as examples of the simplest dimorphism, since the offspring\r\nnever offer intermediate varieties between the parent forms.\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of dimorphism and polymorphism may be well illustrated by\r\nsupposing that a blue-eyed, flaxen-haired Saxon man had two wives, one a\r\nblack-haired, red-skinned Indian squaw, the other a woolly-headed,\r\nsooty-skinned negress--and that instead of the children being mulattoes\r\nof brown or dusky tints, mingling the separate characteristics of their\r\nparents in varying degrees, all the boys should be pure Saxon boys like\r\ntheir father, while the girls should altogether resemble their mothers.\r\nThis would be thought a sufficiently wonderful fact; yet the phenomena\r\nhere brought forward as existing in the insect-world are still more\r\nextraordinary; for each mother is capable not only of producing male\r\noffspring like the father, and female like herself, but also of\r\nproducing other females exactly like her fellow-wife, and altogether\r\ndiffering from herself. If an island could be stocked with a colony of\r\nhuman beings having similar physiological idiosyncrasies with Papilio\r\nPammon or Papilio Ormenus, we should see white men living with yellow,\r\nred, and black women, and their offspring always reproducing the same\r\ntypes; so that at the end of many generations the men would remain pure\r\nwhite, and the women of the same well-marked races as at the\r\ncommencement.\r\n\r\nThe distinctive character therefore of dimorphism is this, that the\r\nunion of these distinct forms does not produce intermediate varieties,\r\nbut reproduces the distinct forms unchanged. In simple varieties, on the\r\nother hand, as well as when distinct local forms or distinct species are\r\ncrossed, the offspring never resembles either parent exactly, but is\r\nmore or less intermediate between them. Dimorphism is thus seen to be a\r\nspecialized result of variation, by which new physiological phenomena\r\nhave been developed; the two should therefore, whenever possible, be\r\nkept separate.\r\n\r\n3. _Local form, or variety._--This is the first step in the transition\r\nfrom variety to species. It occurs in species of wide range, when groups\r\nof individuals have become partially isolated in several points of its\r\narea of distribution, in each of which a characteristic form has become\r\nmore or less completely segregated. Such forms are very common in all\r\nparts of the world, and have often been classed by one author as\r\nvarieties, by another as species. I restrict the term to those cases\r\nwhere the difference of the forms is very slight, or where the\r\nsegregation is more or less imperfect. The best example in the present\r\ngroup is Papilio Agamemnon, a species which ranges over the greater part\r\nof tropical Asia, the whole of the Malay archipelago, and a portion of\r\nthe Australian and Pacific regions. The modifications are principally of\r\nsize and form, and, though slight, are tolerably constant in each\r\nlocality. The steps, however, are so numerous and gradual that it would\r\nbe impossible to define many of them, though the extreme forms are\r\nsufficiently distinct. Papilio Sarpedon presents somewhat similar but\r\nless numerous variations.\r\n\r\n4. _Co-existing Variety._--This is a somewhat doubtful case. It is when\r\na slight but permanent and hereditary modification of form exists in\r\ncompany with the parent or typical form, without presenting those\r\nintermediate gradations which would constitute it a case of simple\r\nvariability. It is evidently only by direct evidence of the two forms\r\nbreeding separately that this can be distinguished from dimorphism. The\r\ndifficulty occurs in Papilio Jason, and P. Evemon, which inhabit the\r\nsame localities, and are almost exactly alike in form, size, and\r\ncolouration, except that the latter always wants a very conspicuous red\r\nspot on the under surface, which is found not only in P. Jason, but in\r\nall the allied species. It is only by breeding the two insects that it\r\ncan be determined whether this is a case of a co-existing variety or of\r\ndimorphism. In the former case, however, the difference being constant\r\nand so very conspicuous and easily defined, I see not how we could\r\nescape considering it as a distinct species. A true case of co-existing\r\nforms would, I consider, be produced, if a slight variety had become\r\nfixed as a local form, and afterwards been brought into contact with the\r\nparent species, with little or no intermixture of the two; and such\r\ninstances do very probably occur.\r\n\r\n5. _Race or subspecies._--These are local forms completely fixed and\r\nisolated; and there is no possible test but individual opinion to\r\ndetermine which of them shall be considered as species and which\r\nvarieties. If stability of form and \"_the constant transmission of some\r\ncharacteristic peculiarity of organization_\" is the test of a species\r\n(and I can find no other test that is more certain than individual\r\nopinion) then every one of these fixed races, confined as they almost\r\nalways are to distinct and limited areas, must be regarded as a species;\r\nand as such I have in most cases treated them. The various modifications\r\nof Papilio Ulysses, P. Peranthus, P. Codrus, P. Eurypilus, P. Helenus,\r\n&c., are excellent examples; for while some present great and\r\nwell-marked, others offer slight and inconspicuous differences, yet in\r\nall cases these differences seem equally fixed and permanent. If,\r\ntherefore, we call some of these forms species, and others varieties, we\r\nintroduce a purely arbitrary distinction, and shall never be able to\r\ndecide where to draw the line. The races of Papilio Ulysses, for\r\nexample, vary in amount of modification from the scarcely differing New\r\nGuinea form to those of Woodlark Island and New Caledonia, but all seem\r\nequally constant; and as most of these had already been named and\r\ndescribed as species, I have added the New Guinea form under the name of\r\nP. Autolycus. We thus get a little group of Ulyssine Papilios, the whole\r\ncomprised within a very limited area, each one confined to a separate\r\nportion of that area, and, though differing in various amounts, each\r\napparently constant. Few naturalists will doubt that all these may and\r\nprobably have been derived from a common stock, and therefore it seems\r\ndesirable that there should be a unity in our method of treating them;\r\neither call them all _varieties_ or all _species_. Varieties, however,\r\ncontinually get overlooked; in lists of species they are often\r\naltogether unrecorded; and thus we are in danger of neglecting the\r\ninteresting phenomena of variation and distribution which they present.\r\nI think it advisable, therefore, to name all such forms; and those who\r\nwill not accept them as species may consider them as subspecies or\r\nraces.\r\n\r\n6. _Species._--Species are merely those strongly marked races or local\r\nforms which when in contact do not intermix, and when inhabiting\r\ndistinct areas are generally believed to have had a separate origin, and\r\nto be incapable of producing a fertile hybrid offspring. But as the test\r\nof hybridity cannot be applied in one case in ten thousand, and even if\r\nit could be applied would prove nothing, since it is founded on an\r\nassumption of the very question to be decided--and as the test of\r\nseparate origin is in every case inapplicable--and as, further, the test\r\nof non-intermixture is useless, except in those rare cases where the\r\nmost closely allied species are found inhabiting the same area, it will\r\nbe evident that we have no means whatever of distinguishing so-called\r\n\"true species\" from the several modes of variation here pointed out, and\r\ninto which they so often pass by an insensible gradation. It is quite\r\ntrue that, in the great majority of cases, what we term \"species\" are\r\nso well marked and definite that there is no difference of opinion about\r\nthem; but as the test of a true theory is, that it accounts for, or at\r\nthe very least is not inconsistent with, the whole of the phenomena and\r\napparent anomalies of the problem to be solved, it is reasonable to ask\r\nthat those who deny the origin of species by variation and selection\r\nshould grapple with the facts in detail, and show how the doctrine of\r\nthe distinct origin and permanence of species will explain and harmonize\r\nthem. It has been recently asserted by Dr. J. E. Gray (in the\r\nProceedings of the Zoological Society for 1863, page 134), that the\r\ndifficulty of limiting species is in proportion to our ignorance, and\r\nthat just as groups or countries are more accurately known and studied\r\nin greater detail the limits of species become settled. This statement\r\nhas, like many other general assertions, its portion of both truth and\r\nerror. There is no doubt that many uncertain species, founded on few or\r\nisolated specimens, have had their true nature determined by the study\r\nof a good series of examples: they have been thereby established as\r\nspecies or as varieties; and the number of times this has occurred is\r\ndoubtless very great. But there are other, and equally trustworthy\r\ncases, in which, not single species, but whole groups have, by the study\r\nof a vast accumulation of materials, been proved to have no definite\r\nspecific limits. A few of these must be adduced. In Dr. Carpenter's\r\n\"Introduction to the Study of the Foraminifera,\" he states that \"_there\r\nis not a single specimen of plant or animal of which the range of\r\nvariation has been studied by the collocation and comparison of so large\r\na number of specimens as have passed under the review of Messrs.\r\nWilliamson, Parker, Rupert Jones, and myself, in our studies of the\r\ntypes of this group_;\" and the result of this extended comparison of\r\nspecimens is stated to be, \"_The range of variation is so great among\r\nthe Foraminifera as to include not merely those differential characters\r\nwhich have been usually accounted_ SPECIFIC, _but also those upon which\r\nthe greater part of the_ GENERA _of this group have been founded, and\r\neven in some instances those of its_ ORDERS\" (Foraminifera, Preface, x).\r\nYet this same group had been divided by D'Orbigny and other authors into\r\na number of clearly defined _families_, _genera_, and _species_, which\r\nthese careful and conscientious researches have shown to have been\r\nalmost all founded on incomplete knowledge.\r\n\r\nProfessor DeCandolle has recently given the results of an extensive\r\nreview of the species of Cupuliferæ. He finds that the best-known\r\nspecies of oaks are those which produce most varieties and subvarieties;\r\nthat they are often surrounded by provisional species; and, with the\r\nfullest materials at his command, two-thirds of the species he considers\r\nmore or less doubtful. His general conclusion is, that \"_in botany the\r\nlowest series of groups,_ SUBVARIETIES, VARIETIES, _and_ RACES _are very\r\nbadly limited; these can be grouped into_ SPECIES _a little less vaguely\r\nlimited, which again can be formed into sufficiently precise_ GENERA.\"\r\nThis general conclusion is entirely objected to by the writer of the\r\narticle in the \"Natural History Review,\" who, however, does not deny its\r\napplicability to the particular order under discussion, while this very\r\ndifference of opinion is another proof that difficulties in the\r\ndetermination of species do not, any more than in the higher groups,\r\nvanish with increasing materials and more accurate research.\r\n\r\nAnother striking example of the same kind is seen in the genera Rubus\r\nand Rosa, adduced by Mr. Darwin himself; for though the amplest\r\nmaterials exist for a knowledge of these groups, and the most careful\r\nresearch has been bestowed upon them, yet the various species have not\r\nthereby been accurately limited and defined so as to satisfy the\r\nmajority of botanists. In Mr. Baker's revision of the British Roses,\r\njust published by the Linnæan Society, the author includes under the\r\nsingle species Rosa canina, no less than twenty-eight named _varieties_,\r\ndistinguished by more or less constant characters and often confined to\r\nspecial localities; and to these are referred about seventy of the\r\n_species_ of Continental and British botanists.\r\n\r\nDr. Hooker seems to have found the same thing in his study of the Arctic\r\nflora. For though he has had much of the accumulated materials of his\r\npredecessors to work upon, he continually expresses himself as unable to\r\ndo more than group the numerous and apparently fluctuating forms into\r\nmore or less imperfectly defined species. In his paper on the\r\n\"Distribution of Arctic Plants,\" (Trans. Linn. Soc. xxiii., p. 310) Dr.\r\nHooker says:--\"The most able and experienced descriptive botanists vary\r\nin their estimate of the value of the 'specific term' to a much greater\r\nextent than is generally supposed.\" ... \"I think I may safely affirm\r\nthat the 'specific term' has three different standard values, all\r\ncurrent in descriptive botany, but each more or less confined to one\r\nclass of observers.\" ... \"This is no question of what is right or wrong\r\nas to the real value of the specific term; I believe each is right\r\naccording to the standard he assumes as the specific.\"\r\n\r\nLastly, I will adduce Mr. Bates's researches on the Amazons. During\r\neleven years he accumulated vast materials, and carefully studied the\r\nvariation and distribution of insects. Yet he has shown that many\r\nspecies of Lepidoptera, which before offered no special difficulties,\r\nare in reality most intricately combined in a tangled web of affinities,\r\nleading by such gradual steps from the slightest and least stable\r\nvariations to fixed races and well-marked species, that it is very often\r\nimpossible to draw those sharp dividing-lines which it is supposed that\r\na careful study and full materials will always enable us to do.\r\n\r\nThese few examples show, I think, that in every department of nature\r\nthere occur instances of the instability of specific form, which the\r\nincrease of materials aggravates rather than diminishes. And it must be\r\nremembered that the naturalist is rarely likely to err on the side of\r\nimputing greater indefiniteness to species than really exists. There is\r\na completeness and satisfaction to the mind in defining and limiting\r\nand naming a species, which leads us all to do so whenever we\r\nconscientiously can, and which we know has led many collectors to reject\r\nvague intermediate forms as destroying the symmetry of their cabinets.\r\nWe must therefore consider these cases of excessive variation and\r\ninstability as being thoroughly well established; and to the objection\r\nthat, after all, these cases are but few compared with those in which\r\nspecies can be limited and defined, and are therefore merely exceptions\r\nto a general rule, I reply that a true law embraces all apparent\r\nexceptions, and that to the great laws of nature there are no real\r\nexceptions--that what appear to be such are equally results of law, and\r\nare often (perhaps indeed always) those very results which are most\r\nimportant as revealing the true nature and action of the law. It is for\r\nsuch reasons that naturalists now look upon the study of _varieties_ as\r\nmore important than that of well-fixed species. It is in the former that\r\nwe see nature still at work, in the very act of producing those\r\nwonderful modifications of form, that endless variety of colour, and\r\nthat complicated harmony of relations, which gratify every sense and\r\ngive occupation to every faculty of the true lover of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Variation as specially influenced by Locality._\r\n\r\nThe phenomena of variation as influenced by locality have not hitherto\r\nreceived much attention. Botanists, it is true, are acquainted with the\r\ninfluences of climate, altitude, and other physical conditions, in\r\nmodifying the forms and external characteristics of plants; but I am not\r\naware that any peculiar influence has been traced to locality,\r\nindependent of climate. Almost the only case I can find recorded is\r\nmentioned in that repertory of natural-history facts, \"The Origin of\r\nSpecies,\" viz. that herbaceous groups have a tendency to become arboreal\r\nin islands. In the animal world, I cannot find that any facts have been\r\npointed out as showing the special influence of locality in giving a\r\npeculiar _facies_ to the several disconnected species that inhabit it.\r\nWhat I have to adduce on this matter will therefore, I hope, possess\r\nsome interest and novelty.\r\n\r\nOn examining the closely allied species, local forms, and varieties\r\ndistributed over the Indian and Malayan regions, I find that larger or\r\nsmaller districts, or even single islands, give a special character to\r\nthe majority of their Papilionidæ. For instance: 1. The species of the\r\nIndian region (Sumatra, Java, and Borneo) are almost invariably smaller\r\nthan the allied species inhabiting Celebes and the Moluccas; 2. The\r\nspecies of New Guinea and Australia are also, though in a less degree,\r\nsmaller than the nearest species or varieties of the Moluccas; 3. In the\r\nMoluccas themselves the species of Amboyna are the largest; 4. The\r\nspecies of Celebes equal or even surpass in size those of Amboyna; 5.\r\nThe species and varieties of Celebes possess a striking character in the\r\nform of the anterior wings, different from that of the allied species\r\nand varieties of all the surrounding islands; 6. Tailed species in India\r\nor the Indian region become tailless as they spread eastward through the\r\narchipelago; 7. In Amboyna and Ceram the females of several species are\r\ndull-coloured, while in the adjacent islands they are more brilliant.\r\n\r\n_Local variation of Size._--Having preserved the finest and largest\r\nspecimens of Butterflies in my own collection, and having always taken\r\nfor comparison the largest specimens of the same sex, I believe that the\r\ntables I now give are sufficiently exact. The differences of expanse of\r\nwings are in most cases very great, and are much more conspicuous in the\r\nspecimens themselves than on paper. It will be seen that no less than\r\nfourteen Papilionidæ inhabiting Celebes and the Moluccas are from\r\none-third to one-half greater in extent of wing than the allied species\r\nrepresenting them in Java, Sumatra, and Borneo. Six species inhabiting\r\nAmboyna are larger than the closely allied forms of the northern\r\nMoluccas and New Guinea by about one-sixth. These include almost every\r\ncase in which closely allied species can be compared.\r\n\r\n  Species of Papilionidæ of the     Closely allied species of Java and\r\n  Moluccas and Celebes (large).     the Indian region (small).\r\n\r\n                      Expanse.

In\r\nJava, Sumatra, and Borneo, the closely allied P. Theseus has a very\r\nshort tail, or tooth only, in the male, while in the females the tail is\r\nretained. Further east, in Celebes and the South Moluccas, the hardly\r\nseparable P. Alphenor has quite lost the tail in the male, while the\r\nfemale retains it, but in a narrower and less spatulate form. A little\r\nfurther, in Gilolo, P. Nicanor has completely lost the tail in both\r\nsexes.\r\n\r\nPapilio Agamemnon exhibits a somewhat similar series of changes. In\r\nIndia it is always tailed; in the greater part of the archipelago it has\r\na very short tail; while far east, in New Guinea and the adjacent\r\nislands, the tail has almost entirely disappeared.\r\n\r\nIn the Polydorus-group two species, P. Antiphus and P. Diphilus,\r\ninhabiting India and the Indian region, are tailed, while the two which\r\ntake their place in the Moluccas, New Guinea, and Australia, P.\r\nPolydorus and P. Leodamas, are destitute of tail, the species furthest\r\neast having lost this ornament the most completely.\r\n\r\n  Western species, Tailed.     Allied Eastern species not Tailed.\r\n\r\n  Papilio Pammon (India)       P. Thesus (Islands) minute tail.\r\n  P. Agamemnon, var. (India)   P. Agamemnon, var. (Islands).\r\n  P. Antiphus (India, Java)    P. Polydorus (Moluccas).\r\n  P. Diphilus (India, Java)    P. Leodamas (New Guinea).\r\n\r\nThe most conspicuous instance of local modification of form, however, is\r\nexhibited in the island of Celebes, which in this respect, as in some\r\nothers, stands alone and isolated in the whole archipelago. Almost every\r\nspecies of Papilio inhabiting Celebes has the wings of a peculiar shape,\r\nwhich distinguishes them at a glance from the allied species of every\r\nother island. This peculiarity consists, first, in the upper wings being\r\ngenerally more elongate and falcate; and secondly, in the costa or\r\nanterior margin being much more curved, and in most instances exhibiting\r\nnear the base an abrupt bend or elbow, which in some species is very\r\nconspicuous. This peculiarity is visible, not only when the Celebesian\r\nspecies are compared with their small-sized allies of Java and Borneo,\r\nbut also, and in an almost equal degree, when the large forms of Amboyna\r\nand the Moluccas are the objects of comparison, showing that this is\r\nquite a distinct phenomenon from the difference of size which has just\r\nbeen pointed out.\r\n\r\nIn the following Table I have arranged the chief Papilios of Celebes in\r\nthe order in which they exhibit this characteristic form most\r\nprominently.\r\n\r\n  Papilios of Celebes, having the    Closely allied Papilios of the\r\n  wings falcate or with abruptly     surrounding islands, with less\r\n  curved costa. wings and slightly   falcate curved costa.\r\n\r\n  1.

Encelades                   P. Leucothoë (Malacca).\r\n\r\nIt thus appears that every species of Papilio exhibits this peculiar\r\nform in a greater or less degree, except one, P. Polyphontes, allied to\r\nP. Diphilus of India and P. Polydorus of the Moluccas. This fact I\r\nshall recur to again, as I think it helps us to understand something of\r\nthe causes that may have brought about the phenomenon we are\r\nconsidering. Neither do the genera Ornithoptera and Leptocircus exhibit\r\nany traces of this peculiar form. In several other families of\r\nButterflies this characteristic form reappears in a few species. In the\r\nPieridæ the following species, all peculiar to Celebes, exhibit it\r\ndistinctly:--\r\n\r\n  1. Pieris Eperia       compared with P. Coronis (Java).\r\n  2. Thyca Zebuda            \"    \"    Thyca Descombesi\r\n                                         (India).\r\n  3. T. Rosenbergii          \"    \"    T. Hyparete (Java).\r\n  4.

Iphias Glaucippe, var.  \"    \"    Iphias Glaucippe\r\n                                         (Java).\r\n\r\nThe species of Terias, one or two Pieris, and the genus Callidryas do\r\nnot exhibit any perceptible change of form.\r\n\r\nIn the other families there are but few similar examples. The following\r\nare all that I can find in my collection:--\r\n\r\n  Cethosia Æole        compared with Cethosia Biblis (Java).\r\n  Eurhinia megalonice      \"    \"    Eurhinia  Polynice\r\n                                       (Borneo).\r\n  Limenitis Limire         \"    \"    Limenitis  Procris\r\n                                       (Java).\r\n  Cynthia Arsinoë, var.    \"    \"    Cynthia Arsinoë (Java,\r\n                                       Sumatra, Borneo)\r\n\r\nAll these belong to the family of the Nymphalidæ. Many other genera of\r\nthis family, as Diadema, Adolias, Charaxes, and Cyrestis, as well as the\r\nentire families of the Danaidæ, Satyridæ, Lycænidæ, and Hesperidæ,\r\npresent no examples of this peculiar form of the upper wing in the\r\nCelebesian species.\r\n\r\n_Local variations of Colour._--In Amboyna and Ceram the female of the\r\nlarge and handsome Ornithoptera Helena has the large patch on the hind\r\nwings constantly of a pale dull ochre or buff colour, while in the\r\nscarcely distinguishable varieties from the adjacent islands of Bouru\r\nand New Guinea, it is of a golden yellow, hardly inferior in brilliancy\r\nto its colour in the male sex. The female of Ornithoptera Priamus\r\n(inhabiting Amboyna and Ceram exclusively) is of a pale dusky brown\r\ntint, while in all the allied species the same sex is nearly black with\r\ncontrasted white markings. As a third example, the female of Papilio\r\nUlysses has the blue colour obscured by dull and dusky tints, while in\r\nthe closely allied species from the surrounding islands, the females are\r\nof almost as brilliant an azure blue as the males. A parallel case to\r\nthis is the occurrence, in the small islands of Goram, Matabello, Ké,\r\nand Aru, of several distinct species of Euploea and Diadema, having broad\r\nbands or patches of white, which do not exist in any of the allied\r\nspecies from the larger islands. These facts seem to indicate some local\r\ninfluence in modifying colour, as unintelligible and almost as\r\nremarkable as that which has resulted in the modifications of form\r\npreviously described.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Remarks on the facts of Local variation._\r\n\r\nThe facts now brought forward seem to me of the highest interest. We see\r\nthat almost all the species in two important families of the Lepidoptera\r\n(Papilionidæ and Pieridæ) acquire, in a single island, a characteristic\r\nmodification of form distinguishing them from the allied species and\r\nvarieties of all the surrounding islands. In other equally extensive\r\nfamilies no such change occurs, except in one or two isolated species.\r\nHowever we may account for these phenomena, or whether we may be quite\r\nunable to account for them, they furnish, in my opinion, a strong\r\ncorroborative testimony in favour of the doctrine of the origin of\r\nspecies by successive small variations; for we have here slight\r\nvarieties, local races, and undoubted species, all modified in exactly\r\nthe same manner, indicating plainly a common cause producing identical\r\nresults. On the generally received theory of the original distinctness\r\nand permanence of species, we are met by this difficulty: one portion of\r\nthese curiously modified forms are admitted to have been produced by\r\nvariation and some natural action of local conditions; whilst the other\r\nportion, differing from the former only in degree, and connected with\r\nthem by insensible gradations, are said to have possessed this\r\npeculiarity of form at their first creation, or to have derived it from\r\nunknown causes of a totally distinct nature. Is not the _à priori_\r\nevidence in favour of an identity of the causes that have produced such\r\nsimilar results? and have we not a right to call upon our opponents for\r\nsome proofs of their own doctrine, and for an explanation of its\r\ndifficulties, instead of their assuming that they are right, and laying\r\nupon us the burthen of disproof?\r\n\r\nLet us now see if the facts in question do not themselves furnish some\r\nclue to their explanation. Mr. Bates has shown that certain groups of\r\nbutterflies have a defence against insectivorous animals, independent of\r\nswiftness of motion. These are generally very abundant, slow, and weak\r\nfliers, and are more or less the objects of mimicry by other groups,\r\nwhich thus gain an advantage in a freedom from persecution similar to\r\nthat enjoyed by those they resemble. Now the only Papilios which have\r\nnot in Celebes acquired the peculiar form of wing, belong to a group\r\nwhich is imitated both by other species of Papilio and by Moths of the\r\ngenus Epicopeia. This group is of weak and slow flight; and we may\r\ntherefore fairly conclude that it possesses some means of defence\r\n(probably in a peculiar odour or taste) which saves it from attack. Now\r\nthe arched costa and falcate form of wing is generally supposed to give\r\nincreased powers of flight, or, as seems to me more probable, greater\r\nfacility in making sudden turnings, and thus baffling a pursuer. But the\r\nmembers of the Polydorus-group (to which belongs the only unchanged\r\nCelebesian Papilio), being already guarded against attack, have no need\r\nof this increased power of wing; and \"natural selection\" would therefore\r\nhave no tendency to produce it. The whole family of Danaidæ are in the\r\nsame position: they are slow and weak fliers; yet they abound in species\r\nand individuals, and are the objects of mimicry. The Satyridæ have also\r\nprobably a means of protection--perhaps their keeping always near the\r\nground and their generally obscure colours; while the Lycænidæ and\r\nHesperidæ may find security in their small size and rapid motions. In\r\nthe extensive family of the Nymphalidæ, however, we find that several of\r\nthe larger species, of comparatively feeble structure, have their wings\r\nmodified (Cethosia, Limenitis, Junonia, Cynthia), while the large-bodied\r\npowerful species, which have all an excessively rapid flight, have\r\nexactly the same form of wing in Celebes as in the other islands. On the\r\nwhole, therefore, we may say that all the butterflies of rather large\r\nsize, conspicuous colours, and not very swift flight have been affected\r\nin the manner described, while the smaller sized and obscure groups, as\r\nwell as those which are the objects of mimicry, and also those of\r\nexceedingly swift flight have remained unaffected.\r\n\r\nIt would thus appear as if there must be (or once have been) in the\r\nisland of Celebes, some peculiar enemy to these larger-sized butterflies\r\nwhich does not exist, or is less abundant, in the surrounding islands.\r\nIncreased powers of flight, or rapidity of turning, was advantageous in\r\nbaffling this enemy; and the peculiar form of wing necessary to give\r\nthis would be readily acquired by the action of \"natural selection\" on\r\nthe slight variations of form that are continually occurring.\r\n\r\nSuch an enemy one would naturally suppose to be an insectivorous bird;\r\nbut it is a remarkable fact that most of the genera of Fly-catchers\r\nof Borneo and Java on the one side (Muscipeta, Philentoma,) and of\r\nthe Moluccas on the other (Monarcha, Rhipidura), are almost entirely\r\nabsent from Celebes. Their place seems to be supplied by the\r\nCaterpillar-catchers (Graucalus, Campephaga, &c.), of which six or seven\r\nspecies are known from Celebes and are very numerous in individuals. We\r\nhave no positive evidence that these birds pursue butterflies on the\r\nwing, but it is highly probable that they do so when other food is\r\nscarce. Mr. Bates has suggested to me that the larger Dragonflies\r\n(Æshna, &c.) prey upon butterflies; but I did not notice that they were\r\nmore abundant in Celebes than elsewhere. However this may be, the fauna\r\nof Celebes is undoubtedly highly peculiar in every department of which\r\nwe have any accurate knowledge; and though we may not be able\r\nsatisfactorily to trace how it has been effected, there can, I think, be\r\nlittle doubt that the singular modification in the wings of so many of\r\nthe butterflies of that island is an effect of that complicated action\r\nand reaction of all living things upon each other in the struggle for\r\nexistence, which continually tends to readjust disturbed relations, and\r\nto bring every species into harmony with the varying conditions of the\r\nsurrounding universe.\r\n\r\nBut even the conjectural explanation now given fails us in the other\r\ncases of local modification. Why the species of the Western islands\r\nshould be smaller than those further east,--why those of Amboyna should\r\nexceed in size those of Gilolo and New Guinea--why the tailed species\r\nof India should begin to lose that appendage in the islands, and retain\r\nno trace of it on the borders of the Pacific,--and why, in three\r\nseparate cases, the females of Amboyna species should be less gaily\r\nattired than the corresponding females of the surrounding islands,--are\r\nquestions which we cannot at present attempt to answer. That they\r\ndepend, however, on some general principle is certain, because analogous\r\nfacts have been observed in other parts of the world. Mr. Bates informs\r\nme that, in three distinct groups, Papilios which on the Upper Amazon\r\nand in most other parts of South America have spotless upper wings\r\nobtain pale or white spots at Pará and on the Lower Amazon; and also\r\nthat the Æneas-group of Papilios never have tails in the equatorial\r\nregions and the Amazons valley, but gradually acquire tails in many\r\ncases as they range towards the northern or southern tropic. Even in\r\nEurope we have somewhat similar facts; for the species and varieties of\r\nbutterflies peculiar to the island of Sardinia are generally smaller and\r\nmore deeply coloured than those of the mainland, and the same has\r\nrecently been shown to be the case with the common tortoiseshell\r\nbutterfly in the Isle of Man; while Papilio Hospiton, peculiar to the\r\nformer island, has lost the tail, which is a prominent feature of the\r\nclosely allied P. Machaon.\r\n\r\nFacts of a similar nature to those now brought forward would no doubt be\r\nfound to occur in other groups of insects, were local faunas carefully\r\nstudied in relation to those of the surrounding countries; and they\r\nseem to indicate that climate and other physical causes have, in some\r\ncases, a very powerful effect in modifying specific form and colour, and\r\nthus directly aid in producing the endless variety of nature.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mimicry._\r\n\r\nHaving fully discussed this subject in the preceding essay, I have only\r\nto adduce such illustrations of it, as are furnished by the Eastern\r\nPapilionidæ, and to show their bearing upon the phenomena of variation\r\nalready mentioned. As in America, so in the Old World, species of\r\nDanaidæ are the objects which the other families most often imitate. But\r\nbesides these, some genera of Morphidæ and one section of the genus\r\nPapilio are also less frequently copied. Many species of Papilio mimic\r\nother species of these three groups so closely that they are\r\nundistinguishable when on the wing; and in every case the pairs which\r\nresemble each other inhabit the same locality.\r\n\r\nThe following list exhibits the most important and best marked cases of\r\nmimicry which occur among the Papilionidæ of the Malayan region and\r\nIndia:--\r\n\r\n  Mimickers.

Liris              Timor.\r\n       (female)\r\n\r\nWe have, therefore, fourteen species or marked varieties of Papilio,\r\nwhich so closely resemble species of other groups in their respective\r\nlocalities, that it is not possible to impute the resemblance to\r\naccident. The first two in the list (Papilio paradoxa and P. Caunus) are\r\nso exactly like Euploea Midamus and E. Rhadamanthus on the wing, that\r\nalthough they fly very slowly, I was quite unable to distinguish them.\r\nThe first is a very interesting case, because the male and female differ\r\nconsiderably, and each mimics the corresponding sex of the Euploea. A\r\nnew species of Papilio which I discovered in New Guinea resembles Danais\r\nsobrina, from the same country, just as Papilio Marcareus resembles\r\nDanais Aglaia in Malacca, and (according to Dr. Horsfield's figure)\r\nstill more closely in Java. The Indian Papilio Agestor closely imitates\r\nDanais Tytia, which has quite a different style of colouring from the\r\npreceding; and the extraordinary Papilio Idæoides from the Philippine\r\nIslands, must, when on the wing, perfectly resemble the Hestia Leuconoë\r\nof the same region, as also does the Papilio Delessertii imitate the\r\nIdeopsis daos from Penang. Now in every one of these cases the Papilios\r\nare very scarce, while the Danaidæ which they resemble are exceedingly\r\nabundant--most of them swarming so as to be a positive nuisance to the\r\ncollecting entomologist by continually hovering before him when he is in\r\nsearch of newer and more varied captures. Every garden, every roadside,\r\nthe suburbs of every village are full of them, indicating very clearly\r\nthat their life is an easy one, and that they are free from persecution\r\nby the foes which keep down the population of less favoured races. This\r\nsuperabundant population has been shown by Mr. Bates to be a general\r\ncharacteristic of all American groups and species which are objects of\r\nmimicry; and it is interesting to find his observations confirmed by\r\nexamples on the other side of the globe.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable genus Drusilla, a group of pale-coloured butterflies,\r\nmore or less adorned with ocellate spots, is also the object of mimicry\r\nby three distinct genera (Melanitis, Hyantis, and Papilio). These\r\ninsects, like the Danaidæ, are abundant in individuals, have a very\r\nweak and slow flight, and do not seek concealment, or appear to have any\r\nmeans of protection from insectivorous creatures. It is natural to\r\nconclude, therefore, that they have some hidden property which saves\r\nthem from attack; and it is easy to see that when any other insects, by\r\nwhat we call accidental variation, come more or less remotely to\r\nresemble them, the latter will share to some extent in their immunity.\r\nAn extraordinary dimorphic form of the female of Papilio Ormenus has\r\ncome to resemble the Drusillas sufficiently to be taken for one of that\r\ngroup at a little distance; and it is curious that I captured one of\r\nthese Papilios in the Aru Islands hovering along the ground, and\r\nsettling on it occasionally, just as it is the habit of the Drusillas to\r\ndo. The resemblance in this case is only general; but this form of\r\nPapilio varies much, and there is therefore material for natural\r\nselection to act upon, so as ultimately to produce a copy as exact as in\r\nthe other cases.\r\n\r\nThe eastern Papilios allied to Polydorus, Coon, and Philoxenus, form a\r\nnatural section of the genus resembling, in many respects, the\r\nÆneas-group of South America, which they may be said to represent in the\r\nEast. Like them, they are forest insects, have a low and weak flight,\r\nand in their favourite localities are rather abundant in individuals;\r\nand like them, too, they are the objects of mimicry. We may conclude,\r\ntherefore, that they possess some hidden means of protection, which\r\nmakes it useful to other insects to be mistaken for them.\r\n\r\nThe Papilios which resemble them belong to a very distinct section of\r\nthe genus, in which the sexes differ greatly; and it is those females\r\nonly which differ most from the males, and which have already been\r\nalluded to as exhibiting instances of dimorphism, which resemble species\r\nof the other group.\r\n\r\nThe resemblance of P. Romulus to P. Hector is, in some specimens, very\r\nconsiderable, and has led to the two species being placed following each\r\nother in the British Museum Catalogues and by Mr. E. Doubleday. I have\r\nshown, however, that P. Romulus is probably a dimorphic form of the\r\nfemale P. Pammon, and belongs to a distinct section of the genus.\r\n\r\nThe next pair, Papilio Theseus, and P. Antiphus, have been united as one\r\nspecies both by De Haan and in the British Museum Catalogues. The\r\nordinary variety of P. Theseus found in Java almost as nearly resembles\r\nP. Diphilus, inhabiting the same country. The most interesting case,\r\nhowever, is the extreme female form of P. Memnon (figured by Cramer\r\nunder the name of P. Achates), which has acquired the general form and\r\nmarkings of P. Coon, an insect which differs from the ordinary male P.\r\nMemnon, as much as any two species which can be chosen in this extensive\r\nand highly varied genus; and, as if to show that this resemblance is not\r\naccidental, but is the result of law, when in India we find a species\r\nclosely allied to P. Coon, but with red instead of yellow spots (P.\r\nDoubledayi), the corresponding variety of P. Androgeus (P. Achates,\r\nCramer, 182, A, B,) has acquired exactly the same peculiarity of having\r\nred spots instead of yellow. Lastly, in the island of Timor, the female\r\nof P. Oenomaus (a species allied to P. Memnon) resembles so closely P.\r\nLiris (one of the Polydorus-group), that the two, which were often seen\r\nflying together, could only be distinguished by a minute comparison\r\nafter being captured.\r\n\r\nThe last six cases of mimicry are especially instructive, because they\r\nseem to indicate one of the processes by which dimorphic forms have been\r\nproduced. When, as in these cases, one sex differs much from the other,\r\nand varies greatly itself, it may happen that occasionally individual\r\nvariations will occur having a distant resemblance to groups which are\r\nthe objects of mimicry, and which it is therefore advantageous to\r\nresemble. Such a variety will have a better chance of preservation; the\r\nindividuals possessing it will be multiplied; and their accidental\r\nlikeness to the favoured group will be rendered permanent by hereditary\r\ntransmission, and, each successive variation which increases the\r\nresemblance being preserved, and all variations departing from the\r\nfavoured type having less chance of preservation, there will in time\r\nresult those singular cases of two or more isolated and fixed forms,\r\nbound together by that intimate relationship which constitutes them the\r\nsexes of a single species. The reason why the females are more subject\r\nto this kind of modification than the males is, probably, that their\r\nslower flight, when laden with eggs, and their exposure to attack while\r\nin the act of depositing their eggs upon leaves, render it especially\r\nadvantageous for them to have some additional protection. This they at\r\nonce obtain by acquiring a resemblance to other species which, from\r\nwhatever cause, enjoy a comparative immunity from persecution.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Concluding remarks on Variation in Lepidoptera._\r\n\r\nThis summary of the more interesting phenomena of variation presented by\r\nthe eastern Papilionidæ is, I think, sufficient to substantiate my\r\nposition, that the Lepidoptera are a group that offer especial\r\nfacilities for such inquiries; and it will also show that they have\r\nundergone an amount of special adaptive modification rarely equalled\r\namong the more highly organized animals. And, among the Lepidoptera, the\r\ngreat and pre-eminently tropical families of Papilionidæ and Danaidæ\r\nseem to be those in which complicated adaptations to the surrounding\r\norganic and inorganic universe have been most completely developed,\r\noffering in this respect a striking analogy to the equally\r\nextraordinary, though totally different, adaptations which present\r\nthemselves in the Orchideæ, the only family of plants in which mimicry\r\nof other organisms appears to play any important part, and the only one\r\nin which cases of conspicuous polymorphism occur; for as such we must\r\nclass the male, female, and hermaphrodite forms of Catasetum\r\ntridentatum, which differ so greatly in form and structure that they\r\nwere long considered to belong to three distinct genera.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Arrangement and Geographical Distribution of the Malayan Papilionidæ_.\r\n\r\n_Arrangement._--Although the species of Papilionidæ inhabiting the\r\nMalayan region are very numerous, they all belong to three out of the\r\nnine genera into which the family is divided. One of the remaining\r\ngenera (Eurycus) is restricted to Australia, and another (Teinopalpus)\r\nto the Himalayan Mountains, while no less than four (Parnassius,\r\nDoritis, Thais, and Sericinus) are confined to Southern Europe and to\r\nthe mountain-ranges of the Palæarctic region.\r\n\r\nThe genera Ornithoptera and Leptocircus are highly characteristic of\r\nMalayan entomology, but are uniform in character and of small extent.\r\nThe genus Papilio, on the other hand, presents a great variety of forms,\r\nand is so richly represented in the Malay Islands, that more than\r\none-fourth of all the known species are found there. It becomes\r\nnecessary, therefore, to divide this genus into natural groups before we\r\ncan successfully study its geographical distribution.\r\n\r\nOwing principally to Dr. Horsfield's observations in Java, we are\r\nacquainted with a considerable number of the larvæ of Papilios; and\r\nthese furnish good characters for the primary division of the genus into\r\nnatural groups. The manner in which the hinder wings are plaited or\r\nfolded back at the abdominal margin, the size of the anal valves, the\r\nstructure of the antennæ, and the form of the wings are also of much\r\nservice, as well as the character of the flight and the style of\r\ncolouration. Using these characters, I divide the Malayan Papilios into\r\nfour sections, and seventeen groups, as follows:--\r\n\r\nGenus ORNITHOPTERA.\r\n\r\n    a. Priamus-group.   } Black and Green.\r\n    c. Brookeanus-group.}\r\n    b. Pompeus-group. Black and yellow.\r\n\r\nGenus PAPILIO.\r\n\r\n  A. Larvæ short, thick, with numerous fleshy tubercles;\r\n     of a purplish colour.\r\n\r\n    a.

They all have a weak, low flight, frequent the most\r\nluxuriant forest-districts, seem to love the shade, and are the objects\r\nof mimicry by other Papilios.\r\n\r\nSection B consists of weak-bodied, large-winged insects, with an\r\nirregular wavering flight, and which, when resting on foliage, often\r\nexpand the wings, which the species of the other sections rarely or\r\nnever do. They are the most conspicuous and striking of eastern\r\nButterflies.\r\n\r\nSection C consists of much weaker and slower-flying insects, often\r\nresembling in their flight, as well as in their colours, species of\r\nDanaidæ.\r\n\r\nSection D contains the strongest-bodied and most swift-flying of the\r\ngenus. They love sunlight, and frequent the borders of streams and the\r\nedges of puddles, where they gather together in swarms consisting of\r\nseveral species, greedily sucking up the moisture, and, when disturbed,\r\ncircling round in the air, or flying high and with great strength and\r\nrapidity.\r\n\r\n_Geographical Distribution._--One hundred and thirty species of Malayan\r\nPapilionidæ are now known within the district extending from the Malay\r\npeninsula, on the north-west, to Woodlark Island, near New Guinea, on\r\nthe south-east.\r\n\r\nThe exceeding richness of the Malayan region in these fine insects is\r\nseen by comparing the number of species found in the different tropical\r\nregions of the earth. From all Africa only 33 species of Papilio are\r\nknown; but as several are still undescribed in collections, we may raise\r\ntheir number to about 40. In all tropical Asia there are at present\r\ndescribed only 65 species, and I have seen in collections but two or\r\nthree which have not yet been named. In South America, south of Panama,\r\nthere are 150 species, or about one-seventh more than are yet known from\r\nthe Malayan region; but the area of the two countries is very different;\r\nfor while South America (even excluding Patagonia) contains 5,000,000\r\nsquare miles, a line encircling the whole of the Malayan islands would\r\nonly include an area of 2,700,000 square miles, of which the land-area\r\nwould be about 1,000,000 square miles. This superior richness is partly\r\nreal and partly apparent. The breaking up of a district into small\r\nisolated portions, as in an archipelago, seems highly favourable to the\r\nsegregation and perpetuation of local peculiarities in certain groups;\r\nso that a species which on a continent might have a wide range, and\r\nwhose local forms, if any, would be so connected together that it would\r\nbe impossible to separate them, may become by isolation reduced to a\r\nnumber of such clearly defined and constant forms that we are obliged to\r\ncount them as species. From this point of view, therefore, the greater\r\nproportionate number of Malayan species may be considered as apparent\r\nonly. Its true superiority is shown, on the other hand, by the\r\npossession of three genera and twenty groups of Papilionidæ against a\r\nsingle genus and eight groups in South America, and also by the much\r\ngreater average size of the Malayan species. In most other families,\r\nhowever, the reverse is the case, the South American Nymphalidæ,\r\nSatyridæ, and Erycinidæ far surpassing those of the East in number,\r\nvariety, and beauty.\r\n\r\nThe following list, exhibiting the range and distribution of each group,\r\nwill enable us to study more easily their internal and external\r\nrelations.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Range of the Groups of Malayan Papilionidæ._\r\n\r\nOrnithoptera.\r\n\r\n   1.

India to Celebes 4\"\r\n\r\nThis Table shows the great affinity of the Malayan with the Indian\r\nPapilionidæ, only three out of the twenty groups ranging beyond, into\r\nAfrica, Europe, or America. The limitation of groups to the Indo-Malayan\r\nor Austro-Malayan divisions of the archipelago, which is so well marked\r\nin the higher animals, is much less conspicuous in insects, but is shown\r\nin some degree by the Papilionidæ. The following groups are either\r\nalmost or entirely restricted to one portion of the archipelago:--\r\n\r\n  _Indo-Malayan Region._            _Austro-Malayan Region._\r\n\r\n  Nox-group.                        Priamus-group.\r\n  Coon-group.                       Ulysses-group.\r\n  Macareus-group (nearly).          Erechtheus-group.\r\n  Paradoxa-group.\r\n  Dissimilis-group (nearly).\r\n  Brookeanus-group.\r\n  LEPTOCIRCUS (genus).\r\n\r\nThe remaining groups, which range over the whole archipelago, are, in\r\nmany cases, insects of very powerful flight, or they frequent open\r\nplaces and the sea-beach, and are thus more likely to get blown from\r\nisland to island. The fact that three such characteristic groups as\r\nthose of Priamus, Ulysses, and Erechtheus are strictly limited to the\r\nAustralian region of the archipelago, while five other groups are with\r\nequal strictness confined to the Indian region, is a strong\r\ncorroboration of that division which has been founded almost entirely on\r\nthe distribution of Mammalia and Birds.\r\n\r\nIf the various Malayan islands have undergone recent changes of level,\r\nand if any of them have been more closely united within the period of\r\nexisting species than they are now, we may expect to find indications of\r\nsuch changes in community of species between islands now widely\r\nseparated; while those islands which have long remained isolated would\r\nhave had time to acquire peculiar forms by a slow and natural process of\r\nmodification.\r\n\r\nAn examination of the relations of the species of the adjacent islands,\r\nwill thus enable us to correct opinions formed from a mere consideration\r\nof their relative positions. For example, looking at a map of the\r\narchipelago, it is almost impossible to avoid the idea that Java and\r\nSumatra have been recently united; their present proximity is so great,\r\nand they have such an obvious resemblance in their volcanic structure.\r\nYet there can be little doubt that this opinion is erroneous, and that\r\nSumatra has had a more recent and more intimate connexion with Borneo\r\nthan it has had with Java. This is strikingly shown by the mammals of\r\nthese islands--very few of the species of Java and Sumatra being\r\nidentical, while a considerable number are common to Sumatra and Borneo.\r\nThe birds show a somewhat similar relationship; and we shall find that\r\nthe distribution of the Papilionidæ tells exactly the same tale. Thus:--\r\n\r\n  Sumatra has  21 species  }\r\n  Borneo   \"   30    \"     } 20 sp. common to both islands;\r\n\r\n  Sumatra  \"   21    \"     }\r\n  Java     \"   28    \"     } 11 sp. common to both islands;\r\n\r\n  Borneo   \"   30    \"     }\r\n  Java     \"   28    \"     } 20 sp. common to both islands;\r\n\r\nshowing that both Sumatra and Java have a much closer relationship to\r\nBorneo than they have to each other--a most singular and interesting\r\nresult, when we consider the wide separation of Borneo from them both,\r\nand its very different structure. The evidence furnished by a single\r\ngroup of insects would have had but little weight on a point of such\r\nmagnitude if standing alone; but coming as it does to confirm deductions\r\ndrawn from whole classes of the higher animals, it must be admitted to\r\nhave considerable value.\r\n\r\nWe may determine in a similar manner the relations of the different\r\nPapuan Islands to New Guinea. Of thirteen species of Papilionidæ\r\nobtained in the Aru Islands, six were also found in New Guinea, and\r\nseven not. Of nine species obtained at Waigiou, six were New Guinea, and\r\nthree not. The five species found at Mysol were all New Guinea species.\r\nMysol, therefore, has closer relations to New Guinea than the other\r\nislands; and this is corroborated by the distribution of the birds, of\r\nwhich I will only now give one instance. The Paradise Bird found in\r\nMysol is the common New Guinea species, while the Aru Islands and\r\nWaigiou have each a species peculiar to themselves.\r\n\r\nThe large island of Borneo, which contains more species of Papilionidæ\r\nthan any other in the archipelago, has nevertheless only three peculiar\r\nto itself; and it is quite possible, and even probable, that one of\r\nthese may be found in Sumatra or Java. The last-named island has also\r\nthree species peculiar to it; Sumatra has not one, and the peninsula of\r\nMalacca only two. The identity of species is even greater than in birds\r\nor in most other groups of insects, and points very strongly to a recent\r\nconnexion of the whole with each other and the continent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Remarkable Peculiarities of the Island of Celebes._\r\n\r\nIf we now pass to the next island (Celebes), separated from those last\r\nmentioned by a strait not wider than that which divides them from each\r\nother, we have a striking contrast; for with a total number of species\r\nless than either Borneo or Java, no fewer than eighteen are absolutely\r\nrestricted to it. Further east, the large islands of Ceram and New\r\nGuinea have only three species peculiar to each, and Timor has five. We\r\nshall have to look, not to single islands, but to whole groups, in order\r\nto obtain an amount of individuality comparable with that of Celebes.\r\nFor example, the extensive group comprising the large islands of Java,\r\nBorneo, and Sumatra, with the peninsula of Malacca, possessing\r\naltogether 48 species, has about 24, or just half, peculiar to it; the\r\nnumerous group of the Philippines possess 22 species, of which 17 are\r\npeculiar; the seven chief islands of the Moluccas have 27, of which 12\r\nare peculiar; and the whole of the Papuan Islands, with an equal number\r\nof species, have 17 peculiar. Comparable with the most isolated of these\r\ngroups is Celebes, with its 24 species, of which the large proportion of\r\n18 are peculiar. We see, therefore, that the opinion I have elsewhere\r\nexpressed, of the high degree of isolation and the remarkable\r\ndistinctive features of this interesting island, is fully borne out by\r\nthe examination of this conspicuous family of insects. A single\r\nstraggling island with a few small satellites, it is zoologically of\r\nequal importance with extensive groups of islands many times as large\r\nas itself; and standing in the very centre of the archipelago,\r\nsurrounded on every side with islets connecting it with the larger\r\ngroups, and which seem to afford the greatest facilities for the\r\nmigration and intercommunication of their respective productions, it yet\r\nstands out conspicuous with a character of its own in every department\r\nof nature, and presents peculiarities which are, I believe, without a\r\nparallel in any similar locality on the globe.\r\n\r\nBriefly to summarize these peculiarities, Celebes possesses three genera\r\nof mammals (out of the very small number which inhabit it) which are of\r\nsingular and isolated forms, viz., Cynopithecus, a tailless Ape allied\r\nto the Baboons; Anoa, a straight-horned Antelope of obscure affinities,\r\nbut quite unlike anything else in the whole archipelago or in India: and\r\nBabirusa, an altogether abnormal wild Pig. With a rather limited bird\r\npopulation, Celebes has an immense preponderance of species confined to\r\nit, and has also six remarkable genera (Meropogon, Ceycopsis,\r\nStreptocitta, Enodes, Scissirostrum, and Megacephalon) entirely\r\nrestricted to its narrow limits, as well as two others (Prioniturus and\r\nBasilornis) which only range to a single island beyond it.\r\n\r\nMr. Smith's elaborate tables of the distribution of Malayan Hymenoptera\r\n(see \"Proc. Linn. Soc.\" Zool. vol. vii.) show that out of the large\r\nnumber of 301 species collected in Celebes, 190 (or nearly two-thirds)\r\nare absolutely restricted to it, although Borneo on one side, and the\r\nvarious islands of the Moluccas on the other, were equally well explored\r\nby me; and no less than twelve of the genera are not found in any other\r\nisland of the archipelago. I have shown in the present essay that, in\r\nthe Papilionidæ, it has far more species of its own than any other\r\nisland, and a greater proportion of peculiar species than many of the\r\nlarge groups of islands in the archipelago--and that it gives to a large\r\nnumber of the species and varieties which inhabit it, 1st, an increase\r\nof size, and, 2nd, a peculiar modification in the form of the wings,\r\nwhich stamp upon the most dissimilar insects a mark distinctive of their\r\ncommon birth-place.\r\n\r\nWhat, I would ask, are we to do with phenomena such as these? Are we to\r\nrest content with that very simple, but at the same time very\r\nunsatisfying explanation, that all these insects and other animals were\r\ncreated exactly _as_ they are, and originally placed exactly _where_\r\nthey are, by the inscrutable will of their Creator, and that we have\r\nnothing to do but to register the facts and wonder? Was this single\r\nisland selected for a fantastic display of creative power, merely to\r\nexcite a childlike and unreasoning admiration? Is all this appearance of\r\ngradual modification by the action of natural causes--a modification the\r\nsuccessive steps of which we can almost trace--all delusive? Is this\r\nharmony between the most diverse groups, all presenting analogous\r\nphenomena, and indicating a dependence upon physical changes of which we\r\nhave independent evidence, all false testimony? If I could think so, the\r\nstudy of nature would have lost for me its greatest charm. I should\r\nfeel as would the geologist, if you could convince him that his\r\ninterpretation of the earth's past history was all a delusion--that\r\nstrata were never formed in the primeval ocean, and that the fossils he\r\nso carefully collects and studies are no true record of a former living\r\nworld, but were all created just as they now are, and in the rocks where\r\nhe now finds them.\r\n\r\nI must here express my own belief that none of these phenomena, however\r\napparently isolated or insignificant, can ever stand alone--that not the\r\nwing of a butterfly can change in form or vary in colour, except in\r\nharmony with, and as a part of the grand march of nature. I believe,\r\ntherefore, that all the curious phenomena I have just recapitulated, are\r\nimmediately dependent on the last series of changes, organic and\r\ninorganic, in these regions; and as the phenomena presented by the\r\nisland of Celebes differ from those of all the surrounding islands, it\r\ncan, I conceive, only be because the past history of Celebes has been,\r\nto some extent, unique and different from theirs. We must have much more\r\nevidence to determine exactly in what that difference has consisted. At\r\npresent, I only see my way clear to one deduction, viz., that Celebes\r\nrepresents one of the oldest parts of the archipelago; that it has been\r\nformerly more completely isolated both from India and from Australia\r\nthan it is now, and that amid all the mutations it has undergone, a\r\nrelic or substratum of the fauna and flora of some more ancient land has\r\nbeen here preserved to us.\r\n\r\nIt is only since my return home, and since I have been able to compare\r\nthe productions of Celebes side by side with those of the surrounding\r\nislands, that I have been fully impressed with their peculiarity, and\r\nthe great interest that attaches to them. The plants and the reptiles\r\nare still almost unknown; and it is to be hoped that some enterprising\r\nnaturalist may soon devote himself to their study. The geology of the\r\ncountry would also be well worth exploring, and its newer fossils would\r\nbe of especial interest as elucidating the changes which have led to its\r\npresent anomalous condition. This island stands, as it were, upon the\r\nboundary-line between two worlds. On one side is that ancient Australian\r\nfauna, which preserves to the present day the facies of an early\r\ngeological epoch; on the other is the rich and varied fauna of Asia,\r\nwhich seems to contain, in every class and order, the most perfect and\r\nhighly organised animals. Celebes has relations to both, yet strictly\r\nbelongs to neither: it possesses characteristics which are altogether\r\nits own; and I am convinced that no single island upon the globe would\r\nso well repay a careful and detailed research into its past and present\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Concluding Remarks._\r\n\r\nIn writing this essay it has been my object to show how much may, under\r\nfavourable circumstances, be learnt by the study of what may be termed\r\nthe external physiology of a small group of animals, inhabiting a\r\nlimited district. This branch of natural history had received little\r\nattention till Mr. Darwin showed how important an adjunct it may become\r\ntowards a true interpretation of the history of organized beings, and\r\nattracted towards it some small share of that research which had before\r\nbeen almost exclusively devoted to internal structure and physiology.\r\nThe nature of species, the laws of variation, the mysterious influence\r\nof locality on both form and colour, the phenomena of dimorphism and of\r\nmimicry, the modifying influence of sex, the general laws of\r\ngeographical distribution, and the interpretation of past changes of the\r\nearth's surface, have all been more or less fully illustrated by the\r\nvery limited group of the Malayan Papilionidæ; while, at the same time,\r\nthe deductions drawn therefrom have been shown to be supported by\r\nanalogous facts, occurring in other and often widely-separated groups of\r\nanimals.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nV.\r\n\r\nON INSTINCT IN MAN AND ANIMALS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most perfect and most striking examples of what is termed instinct,\r\nthose in which reason or observation appear to have the least influence,\r\nand which seem to imply the possession of faculties farthest removed\r\nfrom our own, are to be found among insects. The marvellous constructive\r\npowers of bees and wasps, the social economy of ants, the careful\r\nprovision for the safety of a progeny they are never to see manifested\r\nby many beetles and flies, and the curious preparations for the pupa\r\nstate by the larvæ of butterflies and moths, are typical examples of\r\nthis faculty, and are supposed to be conclusive as to the existence of\r\nsome power or intelligence, very different from that which we derive\r\nfrom our senses or from our reason.\r\n\r\n\r\n_How Instinct may be best Studied._\r\n\r\nWhatever we may define instinct to be, it is evidently some form of\r\nmental manifestation, and as we can only judge of mind by the analogy of\r\nour own mental functions and by observation of the results of mental\r\naction in other men and in animals, it is incumbent on us, first, to\r\nstudy and endeavour to comprehend the minds of infants, of savage men,\r\nand of animals not very far removed from ourselves, before we pronounce\r\npositively as to the nature of the mental operations in creatures so\r\nradically different from us as insects. We have not yet even been able\r\nto ascertain what are the senses they possess, or what relation their\r\npowers of seeing, hearing, and feeling have to ours. Their sight may far\r\nexceed ours both in delicacy and in range, and may possibly give them\r\nknowledge of the internal constitution of bodies analogous to that which\r\nwe obtain by the spectroscope; and that their visual organs do possess\r\nsome powers which ours do not, is indicated by the extraordinary\r\ncrystalline rods radiating from the optic ganglion to the facets of the\r\ncompound eye, which rods vary in form and thickness in different parts\r\nof their length, and possess distinctive characters in each group of\r\ninsects. This complex apparatus, so different from anything in the eyes\r\nof vertebrates, may subserve some function quite inconceivable by us, as\r\nwell as that which we know as vision. There is reason to believe that\r\ninsects appreciate sounds of extreme delicacy, and it is supposed that\r\ncertain minute organs, plentifully supplied with nerves, and situated in\r\nthe subcostal vein of the wing in most insects, are the organs of\r\nhearing. But besides these, the Orthoptera (such as grasshoppers, &c.)\r\nhave what are supposed to be ears on their fore legs, and Mr. Lowne\r\nbelieves that the little stalked balls, which are the sole remnants of\r\nthe hind wings in flies, are also organs of hearing or of some analogous\r\nsense. In flies, too, the third joint of the antennæ contains thousands\r\nof nerve-fibres, which terminate in small open cells, and this Mr. Lowne\r\nbelieves to be the organ of smell, or of some other, perhaps new, sense.\r\nIt is quite evident, therefore, that insects may possess senses which\r\ngive them a knowledge of that which we can never perceive, and enable\r\nthem to perform acts which to us are incomprehensible. In the midst of\r\nthis complete ignorance of their faculties and inner nature, is it wise\r\nfor us to judge so boldly of their powers by a comparison with our own?\r\nHow can we pretend to fathom the profound mystery of their mental\r\nnature, and decide what, and how much, they can perceive or remember,\r\nreason or reflect! To leap at one bound from our own consciousness to\r\nthat of an insect's, is as unreasonable and absurd as if, with a pretty\r\ngood knowledge of the multiplication table, we were to go straight to\r\nthe study of the calculus of functions, or as if our comparative\r\nanatomists should pass from the study of man's bony structure to that of\r\nthe fish, and, without any knowledge of the numerous intermediate forms,\r\nwere to attempt to determine the homologies between these distant types\r\nof vertebrata. In such a case would not error be inevitable, and would\r\nnot continued study in the same direction only render the erroneous\r\nconclusions more ingrained and more irremovable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Definition of Instinct._\r\n\r\nBefore going further into this subject, we must determine what we mean\r\nby the term instinct. It has been variously defined as--\"disposition\r\noperating without the aid of instruction or experience,\" \"a mental power\r\ntotally independent of organization,\" or \"a power enabling an animal to\r\ndo that which, in those things man can do, results from a chain of\r\nreasoning, and in things which man cannot do, is not to be explained by\r\nany efforts of the intellectual faculties.\" We find, too, that the word\r\ninstinct is very frequently applied to acts which are evidently the\r\nresult either of organization or of habit. The colt or calf is said to\r\nwalk instinctively, almost as soon as it is born; but this is solely due\r\nto its organization, which renders walking both possible and pleasurable\r\nto it. So we are said instinctively to hold out our hands to save\r\nourselves from falling, but this is an acquired habit, which the infant\r\ndoes not possess. It appears to me that instinct should be defined\r\nas--\"the performance by an animal of complex acts, absolutely without\r\ninstruction or previously-acquired knowledge.\" Thus, acts are said to be\r\nperformed by birds in building their nests, by bees in constructing\r\ntheir cells, and by many insects in providing for the future wants of\r\nthemselves or their progeny, without ever having seen such acts\r\nperformed by others, and without any knowledge of why they perform them\r\nthemselves. This is expressed by the very common term \"blind instinct.\"\r\nBut we have here a number of assertions of matters of fact, which,\r\nstrange to say, have never been proved to be facts at all. They are\r\nthought to be so self-evident that they may be taken for granted. No\r\none has ever yet obtained the eggs of some bird which builds an\r\nelaborate nest, hatched these eggs by steam or under a quite distinct\r\nparent, placed them afterwards in an extensive aviary or covered garden,\r\nwhere the situation and the materials of a nest similar to that of the\r\nparent birds may be found, and then seen what kind of nest these birds\r\nwould build. If under these rigorous conditions they choose the same\r\nmaterials, the same situation, and construct the nest in the same way\r\nand as perfectly as their parents did, instinct would be proved in their\r\ncase; now it is only assumed, and assumed, as I shall show further on,\r\nwithout any sufficient reason. So, no one has ever carefully taken the\r\npupæ of a hive of bees out of the comb, removed them from the presence\r\nof other bees, and loosed them in a large conservatory with plenty of\r\nflowers and food, and observed what kind of cells they would construct.\r\nBut till this is done, no one can say that bees build without\r\ninstruction, no one can say that with every new swarm there are no bees\r\nolder than those of the same year, who may be the teachers in forming\r\nthe new comb. Now, in a scientific inquiry, a point which can be proved\r\nshould not be assumed, and a totally unknown power should not be brought\r\nin to explain facts, when known powers may be sufficient. For both these\r\nreasons I decline to accept the theory of instinct in any case where all\r\nother possible modes of explanation have not been exhausted.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Does Man possess Instincts._\r\n\r\nMany of the upholders of the instinctive theory maintain, that man has\r\ninstincts exactly of the same nature as those of animals, but more or\r\nless liable to be obscured by his reasoning powers; and as this is a\r\ncase more open to our observation than any other, I will devote a few\r\npages to its consideration. Infants are said to suck by instinct, and\r\nafterwards to walk by the same power, while in adult man the most\r\nprominent case of instinct is supposed to be, the powers possessed by\r\nsavage races to find their way across a trackless and previously unknown\r\nwilderness. Let us take first the case of the infant's sucking. It is\r\nsometimes absurdly stated that the new-born infant \"seeks the breast,\"\r\nand this is held to be a wonderful proof of instinct. No doubt it would\r\nbe if true, but unfortunately for the theory it is totally false, as\r\nevery nurse and medical man can testify. Still, the child undoubtedly\r\nsucks without teaching, but this is one of those _simple_ acts dependent\r\nupon organization, which cannot properly be termed instinct, any more\r\nthan breathing or muscular motion. Any object of suitable size in the\r\nmouth of an infant excites the nerves and muscles so as to produce the\r\nact of suction, and when at a little later period, the will comes into\r\nplay, the pleasurable sensations consequent on the act lead to its\r\ncontinuance. So, walking is evidently dependent on the arrangement of\r\nthe bones and joints, and the pleasurable exertion of the muscles, which\r\nlead to the vertical posture becoming gradually the most agreeable one;\r\nand there can be little doubt that an infant would learn of itself to\r\nwalk, even if suckled by a wild beast.\r\n\r\n\r\n_How Indians travel through unknown and trackless Forests._\r\n\r\nLet us now consider the fact, of Indians finding their way through\r\nforests they have never traversed before. This is much misunderstood,\r\nfor I believe it is only performed under such special conditions, as at\r\nonce to show that instinct has nothing to do with it. A savage, it is\r\ntrue, can find his way through his native forests in a direction in\r\nwhich he has never traversed them before; but this is because from\r\ninfancy he has been used to wander in them, and to find his way by\r\nindications which he has observed himself or learnt from others. Savages\r\nmake long journeys in many directions, and, their whole faculties being\r\ndirected to the subject, they gain a wide and accurate knowledge of the\r\ntopography, not only of their own district, but of all the regions round\r\nabout. Every one who has travelled in a new direction communicates his\r\nknowledge to those who have travelled less, and descriptions of routes\r\nand localities, and minute incidents of travel, form one of the main\r\nstaples of conversation round the evening fire. Every wanderer or\r\ncaptive from another tribe adds to the store of information, and as the\r\nvery existence of individuals and of whole families and tribes, depends\r\nupon the completeness of this knowledge, all the acute perceptive\r\nfaculties of the adult savage are devoted to acquiring and perfecting\r\nit. The good hunter or warrior thus comes to know the bearing of every\r\nhill and mountain range, the directions and junctions of all the\r\nstreams, the situation of each tract characterized by peculiar\r\nvegetation, not only within the area he has himself traversed, but for\r\nperhaps a hundred miles around it. His acute observation enables him to\r\ndetect the slightest undulations of the surface, the various changes of\r\nsubsoil and alterations in the character of the vegetation, that would\r\nbe quite imperceptible to a stranger. His eye is always open to the\r\ndirection in which he is going; the mossy side of trees, the presence of\r\ncertain plants under the shade of rocks, the morning and evening flight\r\nof birds, are to him indications of direction, almost as sure as the sun\r\nin the heavens. Now, if such a savage is required to find his way across\r\nthis country in a direction in which he has never been before, he is\r\nquite equal to the task. By however circuitous a route he has come to\r\nthe point he is to start from, he has observed all the bearings and\r\ndistances so well, that he knows pretty nearly where he is, the\r\ndirection of his own home and that of the place he is required to go to.\r\nHe starts towards it, and knows that by a certain time he must cross an\r\nupland or a river, that the streams should flow in a certain direction,\r\nand that he should cross some of them at a certain distance from their\r\nsources. The nature of the soil throughout the whole region is known to\r\nhim, as well as all the great features of the vegetation. As he\r\napproaches any tract of country he has been in or near before, many\r\nminute indications guide him, but he observes them so cautiously that\r\nhis white companions cannot perceive by what he has directed his course.\r\nEvery now and then he slightly changes his direction, but he is never\r\nconfused, never loses himself, for he always feels at home; till at last\r\nhe arrives at a well-known country, and directs his course so as to\r\nreach the exact spot desired. To the Europeans whom he guides, he seems\r\nto have come without trouble, without any special observation, and in a\r\nnearly straight unchanging course. They are astonished, and ask if he\r\nhas ever been the same route before, and when he answers \"No,\" conclude\r\nthat some unerring instinct could alone have guided him. But take this\r\nsame man into another country very similar to his own, but with other\r\nstreams and hills, another kind of soil, with a somewhat different\r\nvegetation and animal life; and after bringing him by a circuitous route\r\nto a given point, ask him to return to his starting place, by a straight\r\nline of fifty miles through the forest, and he will certainly decline to\r\nattempt it, or, attempting it, will more or less completely fail. His\r\nsupposed instinct does not act out of his own country.\r\n\r\nA savage, even in a new country, has, however, undoubted advantages,\r\nfrom his familiarity with forest life, his entire fearlessness of being\r\nlost, his accurate perception of direction and of distance, and he is\r\nthus able very soon to acquire a knowledge of the district that seems\r\nmarvellous to a civilized man; but my own observation of savages in\r\nforest countries has convinced me, that they find their way by the use\r\nof no other faculties than those which we ourselves possess. It appears\r\nto me, therefore, that to call in the aid of a new and mysterious power\r\nto account for savages being able to do that which, under similar\r\nconditions, we could almost all of us perform, although perhaps less\r\nperfectly, is almost ludicrously unnecessary.\r\n\r\nIn the next essay I shall attempt to show, that much of what has been\r\nattributed to instinct in birds, can be also very well explained by\r\ncrediting them with those faculties of observation, memory, and\r\nimitation, and with that limited amount of reason, which they\r\nundoubtedly exhibit.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVI.\r\n\r\nTHE PHILOSOPHY OF BIRDS' NESTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Instinct or Reason in the Construction of Birds' Nests._\r\n\r\nBirds, we are told, build their nests by _instinct_, while man\r\nconstructs his dwelling by the exercise of _reason_. Birds never change,\r\nbut continue to build for ever on the self-same plan; man alters and\r\nimproves his houses continually. Reason advances; instinct is\r\nstationary.\r\n\r\nThis doctrine is so very general that it may almost be said to be\r\nuniversally adopted. Men who agree on nothing else, accept this as a\r\ngood explanation of the facts. Philosophers and poets, metaphysicians\r\nand divines, naturalists and the general public, not only agree in\r\nbelieving this to be probable, but even adopt it as a sort of axiom that\r\nis so self-evident as to need no proof, and use it as the very\r\nfoundation of their speculations on instinct and reason. A belief so\r\ngeneral, one would think, must rest on indisputable facts, and be a\r\nlogical deduction from them. Yet I have come to the conclusion that not\r\nonly is it very doubtful, but absolutely erroneous; that it not only\r\ndeviates widely from the truth, but is in almost every particular\r\nexactly opposed to it. I believe, in short, that birds do _not_ build\r\ntheir nests by instinct; that man does _not_ construct his dwelling by\r\nreason; that birds do change and improve when affected by the same\r\ncauses that make men do so; and that mankind neither alter nor improve\r\nwhen they exist under conditions similar to those which are almost\r\nuniversal among birds.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Do Men build by Reason or by Imitation?_\r\n\r\nLet us first consider the theory of reason, as alone determining the\r\ndomestic architecture of the human race. Man, as a reasonable animal, it\r\nis said, continually alters and improves his dwelling. This I entirely\r\ndeny. As a rule, he neither alters nor improves, any more than the birds\r\ndo. What have the houses of most savage tribes improved from, each as\r\ninvariable as the nest of a species of bird? The tents of the Arab are\r\nthe same now as they were two or three thousand years ago, and the mud\r\nvillages of Egypt can scarcely have improved since the time of the\r\nPharaohs. The palm-leaf huts and hovels of the various tribes of South\r\nAmerica and the Malay Archipelago, what have they improved from since\r\nthose regions were first inhabited? The Patagonian's rude shelter of\r\nleaves, the hollowed bank of the South African Earthmen, we cannot even\r\nconceive to have been ever inferior to what they now are. Even nearer\r\nhome, the Irish turf cabin and the Highland stone shelty can hardly have\r\nadvanced much during the last two thousand years. Now, no one imputes\r\nthis stationary condition of domestic architecture among these savage\r\ntribes to instinct, but to simple imitation from one generation to\r\nanother, and the absence of any sufficiently powerful stimulus to\r\nchange or improvement. No one imagines that if an infant Arab could be\r\ntransferred to Patagonia, or to the Highlands, it would, when it grew\r\nup, astonish its foster-parents by constructing a tent of skins. On the\r\nother hand, it is quite clear that physical conditions, combined with\r\nthe degree of civilization arrived at, almost necessitate certain types\r\nof structure. The turf, or stones, or snow--the palm-leaves, bamboo, or\r\nbranches, which are the materials of houses in various countries, are\r\nused because nothing else is so readily to be obtained. The Egyptian\r\npeasant has none of these, not even wood. What, then, can he use but\r\nmud? In tropical forest-countries, the bamboo and the broad palm-leaves\r\nare the natural material for houses, and the form and mode of structure\r\nwill be decided in part by the nature of the country, whether hot or\r\ncool, whether swampy or dry, whether rocky or plain, whether frequented\r\nby wild beasts, or whether subject to the attacks of enemies. When once\r\na particular mode of building has been adopted, and has become confirmed\r\nby habit and by hereditary custom, it will be long retained, even when\r\nits utility has been lost through changed conditions, or through\r\nmigration into a very different region. As a general rule, throughout\r\nthe whole continent of America, native houses are built directly upon\r\nthe ground--strength and security being given by thickening the low\r\nwalls and the roof. In almost the whole of the Malay Islands, on the\r\ncontrary, the houses are raised on posts, often to a great height, with\r\nan open bamboo floor; and the whole structure is exceedingly slight and\r\nthin. Now, what can be the reason of this remarkable difference between\r\ncountries, many parts of which are strikingly similar in physical\r\nconditions, natural productions, and the state of civilization of their\r\ninhabitants? We appear to have some clue to it in the supposed origin\r\nand migrations of their respective populations. The indigenes of\r\ntropical America are believed to have immigrated from the north--from a\r\ncountry where the winters are severe, and raised houses with open floors\r\nwould be hardly habitable. They moved southwards by land along the\r\nmountain ranges and uplands, and in an altered climate continued the\r\nmode of construction of their forefathers, modified only by the new\r\nmaterials they met with. By minute observations of the Indians of the\r\nAmazon Valley, Mr. Bates arrived at the conclusion that they were\r\ncomparatively recent immigrants from a colder climate. He says:--\"No one\r\ncould live long among the Indians of the Upper Amazon without being\r\nstruck with their constitutional dislike to the heat ... Their skin is\r\nhot to the touch, and they perspire little ... They are restless and\r\ndiscontented in hot, dry weather, but cheerful on cool days, when the\r\nrain is pouring down their naked backs.\" And, after giving many other\r\ndetails, he concludes, \"How different all this is with the Negro, the\r\ntrue child of tropical climes! The impression gradually forced itself on\r\nmy mind that the Red Indian lives as an immigrant or stranger in these\r\nhot regions, and that his constitution was not originally adapted, and\r\nhas not since become perfectly adapted, to the climate.\"\r\n\r\nThe Malay races, on the other hand, are no doubt very ancient\r\ninhabitants of the hottest regions, and are particularly addicted to\r\nforming their first settlements at the mouths of rivers or creeks, or in\r\nland-locked bays and inlets. They are a pre-eminently maritime or\r\nsemi-aquatic people, to whom a canoe is a necessary of life, and who\r\nwill never travel by land if they can do so by water. In accordance with\r\nthese tastes, they have built their houses on posts in the water, after\r\nthe manner of the lake-dwellers of ancient Europe; and this mode of\r\nconstruction has become so confirmed, that even those tribes who have\r\nspread far into the interior, on dry plains and rocky mountains,\r\ncontinue to build in exactly the same manner, and find safety in the\r\nheight to which they elevate their dwellings above the ground.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Why does each Bird build a peculiar kind of Nest?_\r\n\r\nThese general characteristics of the abode of savage man will be found\r\nto be exactly paralleled by the nests of birds. Each species uses the\r\nmaterials it can most readily obtain, and builds in situations most\r\ncongenial to its habits. The wren, for example, frequenting hedgerows\r\nand low thickets, builds its nest generally of _moss_, a material always\r\nfound where it lives, and among which it probably obtains much of its\r\ninsect food; but it varies sometimes, using hay or feathers when these\r\nare at hand. Rooks dig in pastures and ploughed fields for grubs, and\r\nin doing so must continually encounter _roots_ and _fibres_. These are\r\nused to line its nest. What more natural! The crow feeding on carrion,\r\ndead rabbits, and lambs, and frequenting sheep-walks and warrens,\r\nchooses _fur_ and _wool_ to line its nest. The lark frequents cultivated\r\nfields, and makes its nest, on the ground, of grass lined with\r\n_horsehair_--materials the most easy to meet with, and the best adapted\r\nto its needs. The kingfisher makes its nest of the _bones_ of the fish\r\nwhich it has eaten. Swallows use clay and mud from the margins of the\r\nponds and rivers over which they find their insect food. The materials\r\nof birds' nests, like those used by savage man for his house, are, then,\r\nthose which come first to hand; and it certainly requires no more\r\nspecial instinct to select them in one case than in the other.\r\n\r\nBut, it will be said, it is not so much the materials as the form and\r\nstructure of nests, that vary so much, and are so wonderfully adapted to\r\nthe wants and habits of each species; how are these to be accounted for\r\nexcept by instinct? I reply, they may be in a great measure explained by\r\nthe general habits of the species, the nature of the tools they have to\r\nwork with, and the materials they can most easily obtain, with the very\r\nsimplest adaptations of means to an end, quite within the mental\r\ncapacities of birds. The delicacy and perfection of the nest will bear a\r\ndirect relation to the size of the bird, its structure and habits. That\r\nof the wren or the humming-bird is perhaps not finer or more beautiful\r\nin proportion than that of the blackbird, the magpie, or the crow. The\r\nwren, having a slender beak, long legs, and great activity, is able with\r\ngreat ease to form a well-woven nest of the finest materials, and places\r\nit in thickets and hedgerows which it frequents in its search for food.\r\nThe titmouse, haunting fruit-trees and walls, and searching in cracks\r\nand crannies for insects, is naturally led to build in holes where it\r\nhas shelter and security; while its great activity, and the perfection\r\nof its tools (bill and feet), enable it readily to form a beautiful\r\nreceptacle for its eggs and young. Pigeons having heavy bodies and weak\r\nfeet and bills (imperfect tools for forming a delicate structure) build\r\nrude, flat nests of sticks, laid across strong branches which will bear\r\ntheir weight and that of their bulky young. They can do no better. The\r\nCaprimulgidæ have the most imperfect tools of all, feet that will not\r\nsupport them except on a flat surface (for they cannot truly perch) and\r\na bill excessively broad, short, and weak, and almost hidden by feathers\r\nand bristles. They cannot build a nest of twigs or fibres, hair or moss,\r\nlike other birds, and they therefore generally dispense with one\r\naltogether, laying their eggs on the bare ground, or on the stump or\r\nflat limb of a tree. The clumsy hooked bills, short necks and feet, and\r\nheavy bodies of Parrots, render them quite incapable of building a nest\r\nlike most other birds. They cannot climb up a branch without using both\r\nbill and feet; they cannot even turn round on a perch without holding on\r\nwith their bill. How, then, could they inlay, or weave, or twist the\r\nmaterials of a nest? Consequently, they all lay in holes of trees, the\r\ntops of rotten stumps, or in deserted ants' nests, the soft materials of\r\nwhich they can easily hollow out.\r\n\r\nMany terns and sandpipers lay their eggs on the bare sand of the\r\nsea-shore, and no doubt the Duke of Argyll is correct when he says, that\r\nthe cause of this habit is not that they are unable to form a nest, but\r\nthat, in such situations, any nest would be conspicuous and lead to the\r\ndiscovery of the eggs. The choice of _place_ is, however, evidently\r\ndetermined by the habits of the birds, who, in their daily search for\r\nfood, are continually roaming over extensive tide-washed flats. Gulls\r\nvary considerably in their mode of nesting, but it is always in\r\naccordance with their structure and habits. The situation is either on a\r\nbare rock or on ledges of sea-cliffs, in marshes or on weedy shores. The\r\nmaterials are sea-weed, tufts of grass or rushes, or the _débris_ of the\r\nshore, heaped together with as little order and constructive art as\r\nmight be expected from the webbed feet and clumsy bill of these birds,\r\nthe latter better adapted for seizing fish than for forming a delicate\r\nnest. The long-legged, broad-billed flamingo, who is continually\r\nstalking over muddy flats in search of food, heaps up the mud into a\r\nconical stool, on the top of which it lays its eggs. The bird can thus\r\nsit upon them conveniently, and they are kept dry, out of reach of the\r\ntides.\r\n\r\nNow I believe that throughout the whole class of birds the same general\r\nprinciples will be found to hold good, sometimes distinctly, sometimes\r\nmore obscurely apparent, according as the habits of the species are more\r\nmarked, or their structure more peculiar. It is true that, among birds\r\ndiffering but little in structure or habits, we see considerable\r\ndiversity in the mode of nesting, but we are now so well assured that\r\nimportant changes of climate and of surface have occurred within the\r\nperiod of existing species, that it is by no means difficult to see how\r\nsuch differences have arisen. Simple habits are known to be hereditary,\r\nand as the area now occupied by each species is different from that of\r\nevery other, we may be sure that such changes would act differently upon\r\neach, and would often bring together species which had acquired their\r\npeculiar habits in distinct regions and under different conditions.\r\n\r\n\r\n_How do Young Birds learn to Build their First Nest?_\r\n\r\nBut it is objected, birds do not _learn_ to make their nest as man does\r\nto build, for all birds will make exactly the same nest as the rest of\r\ntheir species, even if they have never seen one, and it is instinct\r\nalone that can enable them to do this. No doubt this would be instinct\r\nif it were true, and I simply ask for proof of the fact. This point,\r\nalthough so important to the question at issue, is always assumed\r\nwithout proof, and even against proof, for what facts there are, are\r\nopposed to it. Birds brought up from the egg in cages do not make the\r\ncharacteristic nest of their species, even though the proper materials\r\nare supplied them, and often make no nest at all, but rudely heap\r\ntogether a quantity of materials; and the experiment has never been\r\nfairly tried, of turning out a pair of birds so brought up, into an\r\nenclosure covered with netting, and watching the result of their\r\nuntaught attempts at nest-making. With regard to the songs of birds,\r\nhowever, which is thought to be equally instinctive, the experiment has\r\nbeen tried, and it is found that young birds never have the song\r\npeculiar to their species if they have not heard it, whereas they\r\nacquire very easily the song of almost any other bird with which they\r\nare associated.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Do Birds sing by Instinct or by Imitation?_\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Daines Barrington was of opinion that \"notes in birds are no\r\nmore innate than language is in man, and depend entirely on the master\r\nunder which they are bred, _as far as their organs will enable them to\r\nimitate_ the sounds which they have frequent opportunities of hearing.\"\r\nHe has given an account of his experiments in the \"Philosophical\r\nTransactions\" for 1773 (Vol. 63); he says: \"I have educated nestling\r\nlinnets under the three best singing larks--the skylark, woodlark, and\r\ntitlark, every one of which, instead of the linnet's song, adhered\r\nentirely to that of their respective instructors. When the note of the\r\ntitlark linnet was thoroughly fixed, I hung the bird in a room with two\r\ncommon linnets for a quarter of a year, which were full in song; the\r\ntitlark linnet, however, did not borrow any passage from the linnet's\r\nsong, but adhered stedfastly to that of the titlark.\" He then goes on\r\nto say that birds taken from the nest at two or three weeks old have\r\nalready learnt the call-note of their species. To prevent this the birds\r\nmust be taken from the nest when a day or two old, and he gives an\r\naccount of a goldfinch which he saw at Knighton in Radnorshire, and\r\nwhich sang exactly like a wren, without any portion of the proper note\r\nof its species. This bird had been taken from the nest at two or three\r\ndays old, and had been hung at a window opposite a small garden, where\r\nit had undoubtedly acquired the notes of the wren without having any\r\nopportunity of learning even the call of the goldfinch.\r\n\r\nHe also saw a linnet, which had been taken from the nest when only two\r\nor three days old, and which, not having any other sounds to imitate,\r\nhad learnt almost to articulate, and could repeat the words \"Pretty\r\nBoy,\" and some other short sentences.\r\n\r\nAnother linnet was educated by himself under a _vengolina_ (a small\r\nAfrican finch, which he says sings better than any foreign bird but the\r\nAmerican mocking bird), and it imitated its African master so exactly\r\nthat it was impossible to distinguish the one from the other.\r\n\r\nStill more extraordinary was the case of a common house sparrow, which\r\nonly chirps in a wild state, but which learnt the song of the linnet and\r\ngoldfinch by being brought up near those birds.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. W. H. Herbert made similar observations, and states that the\r\nyoung whinchat and wheatear, which have naturally little variety of\r\nsong, are ready in confinement to learn from other species, and become\r\nmuch better songsters. The bullfinch, whose natural notes are weak,\r\nharsh, and insignificant, has nevertheless a wonderful musical faculty,\r\nsince it can be taught to whistle complete tunes. The nightingale, on\r\nthe other hand, whose natural song is so beautiful, is exceedingly apt\r\nin confinement to learn that of other birds instead. Bechstein gives an\r\naccount of a redstart which had built under the eaves of his house,\r\nwhich imitated the song of a caged chaffinch in a window underneath,\r\nwhile another in his neighbour's garden repeated some of the notes of a\r\nblackcap, which had a nest close by.\r\n\r\nThese facts, and many others which might be quoted, render it certain\r\nthat the peculiar notes of birds are acquired by imitation, as surely as\r\na child learns English or French, not by instinct, but by hearing the\r\nlanguage spoken by its parents.\r\n\r\nIt is especially worthy of remark that, for young birds to acquire a new\r\nsong correctly, they must be taken out of hearing of their parents very\r\nsoon, for in the first three or four days they have already acquired\r\nsome knowledge of the parent notes, which they will afterwards imitate.\r\nThis shows that very young birds can both hear and remember, and it\r\nwould be very extraordinary if, after they could see, they could neither\r\nobserve nor recollect, and could live for days and weeks in a nest and\r\nknow nothing of its materials and the manner of its construction.\r\nDuring the time they are learning to fly and return often to the nest,\r\nthey must be able to examine it inside and out in every detail, and as\r\nwe have seen that their daily search for food invariably leads them\r\namong the materials of which it is constructed, and among places similar\r\nto that in which it is placed, is it so very wonderful that when they\r\nwant one themselves they should make one like it? How else, in fact,\r\nshould they make it? Would it not be much more remarkable if they went\r\nout of their way to get materials quite different from those used in the\r\nparent nest, if they arranged them in a way they had seen no example of,\r\nand formed the whole structure differently from that in which they\r\nthemselves were reared, and which we may fairly presume is that which\r\ntheir whole organization is best adapted to put together with celerity\r\nand ease? It has, however, been objected that observation, imitation, or\r\nmemory, can have nothing to do with a bird's architectural powers,\r\nbecause the young birds, which in England are born in May or June, will\r\nproceed in the following April or May to build a nest as perfect and as\r\nbeautiful as that in which it was hatched, although it could never have\r\nseen one built. But surely the young birds _before_ they left the nest\r\nhad ample opportunities of observing its _form_, its _size_, its\r\n_position_, the _materials_ of which it was constructed, and the manner\r\nin which those materials were arranged. Memory would retain these\r\nobservations till the following spring, when the materials would come in\r\ntheir way during their daily search for food, and it seems highly\r\nprobable that the older birds would begin building first, and that those\r\nborn the preceding summer would follow their example, learning from them\r\nhow the foundations of the nest are laid and the materials put\r\ntogether.[H]\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  | [H] It has been very pertinently remarked by a friend, that, |\r\n  | if young birds did observe the nest they were reared in,     |\r\n  | they would consider it to be a natural production like the   |\r\n  | leaves and branches and matted twigs that surrounded it, and |\r\n  | could not possibly conclude that their parents had           |\r\n  | constructed the one and not the other. This may be a valid   |\r\n  | objection, and, if so, we shall have to depend on the mode   |\r\n  | of instruction described in the succeeding paragraphs, but   |\r\n  | the question can only be finally decided by a careful set of |\r\n  | experiments.                                                 |\r\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nAgain, we have no right to assume that young birds generally pair\r\ntogether. It seems probable that in each pair there is most frequently\r\nonly one bird born the preceding summer, who would be guided, to some\r\nextent, by its partner.\r\n\r\nMy friend, Mr. Richard Spruce, the well-known traveller and botanist,\r\nthinks this is the case, and has kindly allowed me to publish the\r\nfollowing observations, which he sent me after reading my book.\r\n\r\n\r\n_How young Birds may learn to build Nests._\r\n\r\n\"Among the Indians of Peru and Ecuador, many of whose customs are relics\r\nof the semi-civilisation that prevailed before the Spanish conquest, it\r\nis usual for the young men to marry old women, and the young women old\r\nmen. A young man, they say, accustomed to be tended by his mother, would\r\nfare ill if he had only an ignorant young girl to take care of him; and\r\nthe girl herself would be better off with a man of mature years, capable\r\nof supplying the place of a father to her.\r\n\r\n\"Something like this custom prevails among many animals. A stout old\r\nbuck can generally fight his way to the doe of his choice, and indeed of\r\nas many does as he can manage; but a young buck 'of his first horns,'\r\nmust either content himself with celibacy, or with some dame\r\nwell-stricken in years.\r\n\r\n\"Compare the nearly parallel case of the domestic cock and of many other\r\nbirds. Then consider the consequences amongst birds that pair, if an old\r\ncock sorts with a young hen and an old hen with a young cock, as I think\r\nis certainly the case with blackbirds and others that are known to fight\r\nfor the youngest and handsomest females. One of each pair being already\r\nan 'old bird,' will be competent to instruct its younger partner (not\r\nonly in the futility of 'chaff,' but) in the selection of a site for a\r\nnest and how to build it; then, how eggs are hatched and young birds\r\nreared.\r\n\r\n\"Such, in brief, is my idea of how a bird on its first espousals may be\r\ntaught the Whole Duty of the married state.\"\r\n\r\nOn this difficult point I have sought for information from some of our\r\nbest field ornithologists, but without success, as it is in most cases\r\nimpossible to distinguish old from young birds after the first year. I\r\nam informed, however, that the males of blackbirds, sparrows, and many\r\nother kinds fight furiously, and the conqueror of course has the choice\r\nof a mate. Mr. Spruce's view is at least as probable as the contrary one\r\n(that young birds, _as a rule_, pair together), and it is to some extent\r\nsupported by the celebrated American observer, Wilson, who strongly\r\ninsists on the variety in the nests of birds of the same species, some\r\nbeing so much better finished than others; and he believes _that the\r\nless perfect nests are built by the younger, the more perfect by the\r\nolder, birds_.\r\n\r\nAt all events, till the crucial experiment is made, and a pair of birds\r\nraised from the egg without ever seeing a nest are shown to be capable\r\nof making one exactly of the parental type, I do not think we are\r\njustified in calling in the aid of an unknown and mysterious faculty to\r\ndo that which is so strictly analogous to the house-building of savage\r\nman.\r\n\r\nAgain, we always assume that because a nest appears to us delicately and\r\nartfully built, that it therefore requires much special knowledge and\r\nacquired skill (or their substitute, instinct) in the bird who builds\r\nit. We forget that it is formed twig by twig and fibre by fibre, rudely\r\nenough at first, but crevices and irregularities, which must seem huge\r\ngaps and chasms in the eyes of the little builders, are filled up by\r\ntwigs and stalks pushed in by slender beak and active foot, and that the\r\nwool, feathers, or horsehair are laid thread by thread, so that the\r\nresult seems a marvel of ingenuity to us, just as would the rudest\r\nIinand hut to a native of Brobdignag. Levaillant has given an account\r\nof the process of nest-building by a little African warbler, which\r\nsufficiently shows that a very beautiful structure may be produced with\r\nvery little art. The foundation was laid of moss and flax interwoven\r\nwith grass and tufts of cotton, and presented a rude mass, five or six\r\ninches in diameter, and four inches thick. This was pressed and trampled\r\ndown repeatedly, so as at last to make it into a kind of felt. The birds\r\npressed it with their bodies, turning round upon them in every\r\ndirection, so as to get it quite firm and smooth before raising the\r\nsides. These were added bit by bit, trimmed and beaten with the wings\r\nand feet, so as to felt the whole together, projecting fibres being now\r\nand then worked in with the bill. By these simple and apparently\r\ninefficient means, the inner surface of the nest was rendered almost as\r\nsmooth and compact as a piece of cloth.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Man's Works mainly Imitative._\r\n\r\nBut look at civilised man! it is said; look at Grecian, and Egyptian,\r\nand Roman, and Gothic, and modern Architecture! What advance! what\r\nimprovement! what refinements! This is what reason leads to, whereas\r\nbirds remain for ever stationary. If, however, such advances as these\r\nare required, to prove the effects of reason as contrasted with\r\ninstinct, then all savage and many half-civilized tribes have no reason,\r\nbut build instinctively quite as much as birds do.\r\n\r\nMan ranges over the whole earth, and exists under the most varied\r\nconditions, leading necessarily to equally varied habits. He\r\nmigrates--he makes wars and conquests--one race mingles with\r\nanother--different customs are brought into contact--the habits of a\r\nmigrating or conquering race are modified by the different circumstances\r\nof a new country. The civilized race which conquered Egypt must have\r\ndeveloped its mode of building in a forest country where timber was\r\nabundant, for it is not probable, that the idea of cylindrical columns\r\noriginated in a country destitute of trees. The pyramids might have been\r\nbuilt by an indigenous race, but not the temples of El Uksor and Karnak.\r\nIn Grecian architecture, almost every characteristic feature can be\r\ntraced to an origin in wooden buildings. The columns, the architrave,\r\nthe frieze, the fillets, the cantelevers, the form of the roof, all\r\npoint to an origin in some southern forest-clad country, and strikingly\r\ncorroborate the view derived from philology, that Greece was colonised\r\nfrom north-western India. But to erect columns and span them with huge\r\nblocks of stone, or marble, is not an act of reason, but one of pure\r\nunreasoning imitation. The arch is the only true and reasonable mode of\r\ncovering over wide spaces with stone, and therefore, Grecian\r\narchitecture, however exquisitely beautiful, is false in principle, and\r\nis by no means a good example of the application of reason to the art of\r\nbuilding. And what do most of us do at the present day but imitate the\r\nbuildings of those that have gone before us? We have not even been able\r\nto discover or develope any definite style of building best suited for\r\nus. We have no characteristic national style of architecture, and to\r\nthat extent are even below the birds, who have each their characteristic\r\nform of nest, exactly adapted to their wants and habits.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Birds do Alter and Improve their Nests when altered Conditions require\r\nit._\r\n\r\nThe great uniformity in the architecture of each species of bird which\r\nhas been supposed to prove a nest-building instinct, we may, therefore,\r\nfairly impute to the uniformity of the conditions under which each\r\nspecies lives. Their range is often very limited, and they very seldom\r\npermanently change their country, so as to be placed in new conditions.\r\nWhen, however, new conditions do occur, they take advantage of them just\r\nas freely and wisely as man could do. The chimney and house-swallows are\r\na standing proof of a change of habit since chimneys and houses were\r\nbuilt, and in America this change has taken place within about three\r\nhundred years. Thread and worsted are now used in many nests instead of\r\nwool and horsehair, and the jackdaw shows an affection for the church\r\nsteeple which can hardly be explained by instinct. In the more thickly\r\npopulated parts of the United States, the Baltimore oriole uses all\r\nsorts of pieces of string, skeins of silk, or the gardener's bass, to\r\nweave into its fine pensile nest, instead of the single hairs and\r\nvegetable fibres it has painfully to seek in wilder regions; and Wilson,\r\na most careful observer, believes that it improves in nest-building by\r\npractice--the older birds making the best nests. The purple martin takes\r\npossession of empty gourds or small boxes, stuck up for its reception in\r\nalmost every village and farm in America; and several of the American\r\nwrens will also build in cigar boxes, with a small hole cut in them, if\r\nplaced in a suitable situation. The orchard oriole of the United States\r\noffers us an excellent example of a bird which modifies its nest\r\naccording to circumstances. When built among firm and stiff branches the\r\nnest is very shallow, but if, as is often the case, it is suspended from\r\nthe slender twigs of the weeping willow, it is made much deeper, so that\r\nwhen swayed about violently by the wind the young may not tumble out. It\r\nhas been observed also, that the nests built in the warm Southern States\r\nare much slighter and more porous in texture than those in the colder\r\nregions of the north. Our own house-sparrow equally well adapts himself\r\nto circumstances. When he builds in trees, as he, no doubt, always did\r\noriginally, he constructs a well-made domed nest, perfectly fitted to\r\nprotect his young ones; but when he can find a convenient hole in a\r\nbuilding or among thatch, or in any well-sheltered place, he takes much\r\nless trouble, and forms a very loosely-built nest.\r\n\r\nA curious example of a recent change of habits has occurred in Jamaica.\r\nPrevious to 1854, the palm swift (Tachornis phænicobea) inhabited\r\nexclusively the palm trees in a few districts in the island. A colony\r\nthen established themselves in two cocoa-nut palms in Spanish Town, and\r\nremained there till 1857, when one tree was blown down, and the other\r\nstripped of its foliage. Instead of now seeking out other palm trees,\r\nthe swifts drove out the swallows who built in the Piazza of the House\r\nof Assembly, and took possession of it, building their nests on the tops\r\nof the end walls and at the angles formed by the beams and joists, a\r\nplace which they continue to occupy in considerable numbers. It is\r\nremarked that here they form their nest with much less elaboration than\r\nwhen built in the palms, probably from being less exposed.\r\n\r\nA still more curious example of change and improvement in nest building\r\nwas published by Mr. F. A. Pouchet, in the tenth number of the _Comptes\r\nRendus_ for 1870, just as the first edition of this work appeared. Forty\r\nyears ago M. Pouchet had himself collected nests of the House-Martin or\r\nWindow-Swallow (_Hirundo urbica_) from old buildings at Rouen, and\r\ndeposited them in the museum of that city. On recently obtaining some\r\nmore nests he was surprised, on comparing them with the old ones, to\r\nfind that they exhibited a decided change of form and structure. This\r\nled him to investigate the matter more closely. The changed nests had\r\nbeen obtained from houses in a newly erected quarter of the city, and he\r\nfound that all the nests in the newly-built streets were of the new\r\nform. But on visiting the churches and older buildings, and some rocks\r\nwhere these birds build, he found many nests of the old type along with\r\nsome of the new pattern. He then examined all the figures and\r\ndescriptions of the older naturalists, and found that they invariably\r\nrepresented the older form only.\r\n\r\nThe difference between the two forms he states to be as follows. In the\r\nold form the nest is a portion of a globe--when situated in the upper\r\nangle of a window one-fourth of a hemisphere--and the opening is very\r\nsmall and circular, being of a size just sufficient to allow the body of\r\nthe bird to pass. In the new form the nest is much wider in proportion\r\nto its height, being a segment of a depressed spheroid, and the aperture\r\nis very wide and shallow, and close to the horizontal surface to which\r\nthe nest is attached above.\r\n\r\nM. Pouchet thinks that the new form is an undoubted improvement on the\r\nold. The nest has a wider bottom and must allow the young ones to have\r\nmore freedom of motion than in the old narrower, and deeper nests, and\r\nits wide aperture allows the young birds to peep out and breathe the\r\nfresh air. This is so wide as to serve as a sort of balcony for them,\r\nand two young ones can often be seen on it without interfering with the\r\npassage in and out of the old birds. At the same time, by being so close\r\nto the roof, it is a better protection against rain, against cold, and\r\nagainst enemies, than the small round hole of the old nests. Here, then,\r\nwe have an improvement in nest building, as well marked as any\r\nimprovement that takes place in human dwellings in so short a time.\r\n\r\nBut perfection of structure and adaptation to purpose, are not universal\r\ncharacteristics of birds' nests, since there are decided imperfections\r\nin the nesting of many birds which are quite compatible with our present\r\ntheory, but are hardly so with that of instinct, which is supposed to be\r\ninfallible. The Passenger pigeon of America often crowds the branches\r\nwith its nests till they break, and the ground is strewn with shattered\r\nnests, eggs, and young birds. Rooks' nests are often so imperfect that\r\nduring high winds the eggs fall out; but the Window-Swallow is the most\r\nunfortunate in this respect, for White, of Selborne, informs us that he\r\nhas seen them build, year after year, in places where their nests are\r\nliable to be washed away by a heavy rain and their young ones destroyed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Conclusion._\r\n\r\nA fair consideration of all these facts will, I think, fully support the\r\nstatement with which I commenced, and show, that the mental faculties\r\nexhibited by birds in the construction of their nests, are the same in\r\nkind as those manifested by mankind in the formation of their dwellings.\r\nThese are, essentially, imitation, and a slow and partial adaptation to\r\nnew conditions. To compare the work of birds with the highest\r\nmanifestations of human art and science, is totally beside the question.\r\nI do not maintain that birds are gifted with reasoning faculties at all\r\napproaching in variety and extent to those of man. I simply hold that\r\nthe phenomena presented by their mode of building their nests, when\r\nfairly compared with those exhibited by the great mass of mankind in\r\nbuilding their houses, indicate no essential difference in the kind or\r\nnature of the mental faculties employed. If instinct means anything, it\r\nmeans the capacity to perform some complex act without teaching or\r\nexperience. It implies innate ideas of a very definite kind, and, if\r\nestablished, would overthrow Mr. Mill's sensationalism and all the\r\nmodern philosophy of experience. That the existence of true instinct may\r\nbe established in other cases is not impossible, but in the particular\r\ninstance of birds' nests, which is usually considered one of its\r\nstrongholds, I cannot find a particle of evidence to show the existence\r\nof anything beyond those lower reasoning and imitative powers, which\r\nanimals are universally admitted to possess.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVII.\r\n\r\nA THEORY OF BIRDS' NESTS;\r\n\r\nSHOWING THE RELATION OF CERTAIN DIFFERENCES OF COLOUR IN FEMALE\r\nBIRDS, TO THEIR MODE OF NIDIFICATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe habit of forming a more or less elaborate structure for the\r\nreception of their eggs and young, must undoubtedly be looked upon as\r\none of the most remarkable and interesting characteristics of the class\r\nof birds. In other classes of vertebrate animals, such structures are\r\nfew and exceptional, and never attain to the same degree of completeness\r\nand beauty. Birds' nests have, accordingly, attracted much attention,\r\nand have furnished one of the stock arguments to prove the existence of\r\na blind but unerring instinct in the lower animals. The very general\r\nbelief that every bird is enabled to build its nest, not by the ordinary\r\nfaculties of observation, memory, and imitation, but by means of some\r\ninnate and mysterious impulse, has had the bad effect of withdrawing\r\nattention from the very evident relation that exists between the\r\nstructure, habits, and intelligence of birds, and the kind of nests they\r\nconstruct.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding essay I have detailed several of these relations, and\r\nthey teach us, that a consideration of the structure, the food, and\r\nother specialities of a bird's existence, will give a clue, and\r\nsometimes a very complete one, to the reason why it builds its nest of\r\ncertain materials, in a definite situation, and in a more or less\r\nelaborate manner.\r\n\r\nI now propose to consider the question from a more general point of\r\nview, and to discuss its application to some important problems in the\r\nnatural history of birds.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Changed Conditions and persistent Habits as influencing Nidification._\r\n\r\nBesides the causes above alluded to, there are two other factors whose\r\neffect in any particular case we can only vaguely guess at, but which\r\nmust have had an important influence in determining the existing details\r\nof nidification. These are--changed conditions of existence, whether\r\ninternal or external, and the influence of hereditary or imitative\r\nhabit; the first inducing alterations in accordance with changes of\r\norganic structure, of climate, or of the surrounding fauna and flora;\r\nthe other preserving the peculiarities so produced, even when changed\r\nconditions render them no longer necessary. Many facts have been already\r\ngiven which show that birds do adapt their nests to the situations in\r\nwhich they place them, and the adoption of eaves, chimneys, and boxes,\r\nby swallows, wrens, and many other birds, shows that they are always\r\nready to take advantage of changed conditions. It is probable,\r\ntherefore, that a permanent change of climate would cause many birds to\r\nmodify the form or materials of their abodes, so as better to protect\r\ntheir young. The introduction of new enemies to eggs or young birds,\r\nmight introduce many alterations tending to their better concealment. A\r\nchange in the vegetation of a country, would often necessitate the use\r\nof new materials. So, also, we may be sure, that as a species slowly\r\nbecame modified in any external or internal characters, it would\r\nnecessarily change in some degree its mode of building. This effect\r\nwould be produced by modifications of the most varied nature; such as\r\nthe power and rapidity of flight, which must often determine the\r\ndistance to which a bird will go to obtain materials for its nest; the\r\ncapacity of sustaining itself almost motionless in the air, which must\r\nsometimes determine the position in which a nest can be built; the\r\nstrength and grasping power of the foot in relation to the weight of the\r\nbird, a power absolutely essential to the constructor of a\r\ndelicately-woven and well-finished nest; the length and fineness of the\r\nbeak, which has to be used like a needle in building the best textile\r\nnests; the length and mobility of the neck, which is needful for the\r\nsame purpose; the possession of a salivary secretion like that used in\r\nthe nests of many of the swifts and swallows, as well as that of the\r\nsong-thrush--peculiarities of habits, which ultimately depend on\r\nstructure, and which often determine the material most frequently met\r\nwith or most easily to be obtained. Modifications in any of these\r\ncharacters would necessarily lead, either to a change in the materials\r\nof the nest, or in the mode of combining them in the finished\r\nstructure, or in the form or position of that structure.\r\n\r\nDuring all these changes, however, certain specialities of nest-building\r\nwould continue, for a shorter or a longer time after the causes which\r\nhad necessitated them had passed away. Such records of a vanished past\r\nmeet us everywhere, even in man's works, notwithstanding his boasted\r\nreason. Not only are the main features of Greek architecture, mere\r\nreproductions in stone of what were originally parts of a wooden\r\nbuilding, but our modern copyists of Gothic architecture often build\r\nsolid buttresses capped with weighty pinnacles, to support a wooden roof\r\nwhich has no outward thrust to render them necessary; and even think\r\nthey ornament their buildings by adding sham spouts of carved stone,\r\nwhile modern waterpipes, stuck on without any attempt at harmony, do the\r\nreal duty. So, when railways superseded coaches, it was thought\r\nnecessary to build the first-class carriages to imitate a number of\r\ncoach-bodies joined together; and the arm-loops for each passenger to\r\nhold on by, which were useful when bad roads made every journey a\r\nsuccession of jolts and lurches, were continued on our smooth\r\nmacadamised mail-routes, and, still more absurdly, remain to this day in\r\nour railway carriages, the relic of a kind of locomotion we can now\r\nhardly realize. Another good example is to be seen in our boots. When\r\nelastic sides came into fashion we had been so long used to fasten them\r\nwith buttons or laces, that a boot without either looked bare and\r\nunfinished, and accordingly the makers often put on a row of useless\r\nbuttons or imitation laces, because habit rendered the appearance of\r\nthem necessary to us. It is universally admitted that the habits of\r\nchildren and of savages give us the best clue to the habits and mode of\r\nthought of animals; and every one must have observed how children at\r\nfirst imitate the actions of their elders, without any regard to the use\r\nor applicability of the particular acts. So, in savages, many customs\r\npeculiar to each tribe are handed down from father to son merely by the\r\nforce of habit, and are continued long after the purpose which they\r\noriginally served has ceased to exist. With these and a hundred similar\r\nfacts everywhere around us, we may fairly impute much of what we cannot\r\nunderstand in the details of Bird-Architecture to an analogous cause. If\r\nwe do not do so, we must assume, either that birds are guided in every\r\naction by pure reason to a far greater extent than men are, or that an\r\ninfallible instinct leads them to the same result by a different road.\r\nThe first theory has never, that I am aware of, been maintained by any\r\nauthor, and I have already shown that the second, although constantly\r\nassumed, has never been proved, and that a large body of facts is\r\nentirely opposed to it. One of my critics has, indeed, maintained that I\r\nadmit \"instinct\" under the term \"hereditary habit;\" but the whole course\r\nof my argument shows that I do not do so. Hereditary habit is, indeed,\r\nthe same as instinct when the term is applied to some simple action\r\ndependent upon a peculiarity of structure which is hereditary; as when\r\nthe descendants of tumbler pigeons tumble, and the descendants of pouter\r\npigeons pout. In the present case, however, I compare it strictly to the\r\nhereditary, or more properly, persistent or imitative, habits of\r\nsavages, in building their houses as their fathers did. Imitation is a\r\nlower faculty than invention. Children and savages imitate before they\r\noriginate; birds, as well as all other animals, do the same.\r\n\r\nThe preceding observations are intended to show, that the exact mode of\r\nnidification of each species of bird is probably the result of a variety\r\nof causes, which have been continually inducing changes in accordance\r\nwith changed organic or physical conditions. The most important of these\r\ncauses seem to be, in the first place, the structure of the species,\r\nand, in the second, its environment or conditions of existence. Now we\r\nknow, that every one of the characters or conditions included under\r\nthese two heads is variable. We have seen that, on the large scale, the\r\nmain features of the nest built by each group of birds, bears a relation\r\nto the organic structure of that group, and we have, therefore, a right\r\nto infer, that as structure varies, the nest will vary also in some\r\nparticular corresponding to the changes of structure. We have seen also,\r\nthat birds change the position, the form, and the construction of their\r\nnest, whenever the available materials or the available situations, vary\r\nnaturally or have been altered by man; and we have, therefore, a right\r\nto infer that similar changes have taken place, when, by a natural\r\nprocess, external conditions have become in any way permanently altered.\r\nWe must remember, however, that all these factors are very stable during\r\nmany generations, and only change at a rate commensurate with those of\r\nthe great physical features of the earth as revealed to us by geology;\r\nand we may, therefore, infer that the form and construction of nests,\r\nwhich we have shown to be dependent on them, are equally stable. If,\r\ntherefore, we find less important and more easily modified characters\r\nthan these, so correlated with peculiarities of nidification as to\r\nindicate that one is probably the cause of the other, we shall be\r\njustified in concluding that these variable characters are dependent on\r\nthe mode of nidification, and not that the form of the nest has been\r\ndetermined by these variable characters. Such a correlation I am now\r\nabout to point out.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Classification of Nests._\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this inquiry it is necessary to group nests into two\r\ngreat classes, without any regard to their most obvious differences or\r\nresemblances, but solely looking to the fact of whether the contents\r\n(eggs, young, or sitting bird) are hidden or exposed to view. In the\r\nfirst class we place all those in which the eggs and young are\r\ncompletely hidden, no matter whether this is effected by an elaborate\r\ncovered structure, or by depositing the eggs in some hollow tree or\r\nburrow underground. In the second, we group all in which the eggs,\r\nyoung, and sitting bird are exposed to view, no matter whether there is\r\nthe most beautifully formed nest, or none at all. Kingfishers, which\r\nbuild almost invariably in holes in banks; Woodpeckers and Parrots,\r\nwhich build in hollow trees; the Icteridæ of America, which all make\r\nbeautiful covered and suspended nests; and our own Wren, which builds a\r\ndomed nest, are examples of the former; while our Thrushes, Warblers,\r\nand Finches, as well as the Crowshrikes, Chatterers, and Tanagers of the\r\ntropics, together with all Raptorial birds and Pigeons, and a vast\r\nnumber of others in every part of the world, all adopt the latter mode\r\nof building.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that this division of birds according to their\r\nnidification, bears little relation to the character of the nest itself.\r\nIt is a functional not a structural classification. The most rude and\r\nthe most perfect specimens of bird-architecture are to be found in both\r\nsections. It has, however, a certain relation to natural affinities, for\r\nlarge groups of birds, undoubtedly allied, fall into one or the other\r\ndivision exclusively. The species of a genus or of a family are rarely\r\ndivided between the two primary classes, although they are frequently\r\ndivided between the two very distinct modes of nidification that exist\r\nin the first of them.\r\n\r\nAll the Scansorial or climbing, and most of the Fissirostral or\r\nwide-gaped birds, for example, build concealed nests; and, in the latter\r\ngroup, the two families which build open nests, the Swifts and the\r\nGoat-suckers, are undoubtedly very widely separated from the other\r\nfamilies with which they are associated in our classifications. The\r\nTits vary much in their mode of nesting, some making open nests\r\nconcealed in a hole, while others build domed or even pendulous covered\r\nnests, but they all come under the same class. Starlings vary in a\r\nsimilar way. The talking Mynahs, like our own starlings, build in holes,\r\nthe glossy starlings of the East (of the genus Calornis) form a hanging\r\ncovered nest, while the genus Sturnopastor builds in a hollow tree. One\r\nof the most striking cases in which one family of birds is divided\r\nbetween the two classes, is that of the Finches; for while most of the\r\nEuropean species build exposed nests, many of the Australian finches\r\nmake them dome-shaped.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sexual differences of Colour in Birds._\r\n\r\nTurning now from the nests to the creatures who make them, let us\r\nconsider birds themselves from a somewhat unusual point of view, and\r\nform them into separate groups, according as both sexes, or the males\r\nonly, are adorned with conspicuous colours.\r\n\r\nThe sexual differences of colour and plumage in birds are very\r\nremarkable, and have attracted much attention; and, in the case of\r\npolygamous birds, have been well explained by Mr. Darwin's principle of\r\nsexual selection. We can, to a great extent, understand how male\r\nPheasants and Grouse have acquired their more brilliant plumage and\r\ngreater size, by the continual rivalry of the males both in strength and\r\nbeauty; but this theory does not throw any light on the causes which\r\nhave made the female Toucan, Bee-eater, Parroquet, Macaw and Tit, in\r\nalmost every case as gay and brilliant as the male, while the gorgeous\r\nChatterers, Manakins, Tanagers, and Birds of Paradise, as well as our\r\nown Blackbird, have mates so dull and inconspicuous that they can hardly\r\nbe recognised as belonging to the same species.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Law which connects the Colours of Female Birds with the mode of\r\nNidification._\r\n\r\nThe above-stated anomaly can, however, now be explained by the influence\r\nof the mode of nidification, since I find that, with but very few\r\nexceptions, it is the rule--_that when both sexes are of strikingly gay\r\nand conspicuous colours, the nest is of the first class, or such as to\r\nconceal the sitting bird; while, whenever there is a striking contrast\r\nof colours, the male being gay and conspicuous, the female dull and\r\nobscure, the nest is open and the sitting bird exposed to view_. I will\r\nnow proceed to indicate the chief facts that support this statement, and\r\nwill afterwards explain the manner in which I conceive the relation has\r\nbeen brought about.\r\n\r\nWe will first consider those groups of birds in which the female is\r\ngaily or at least conspicuously coloured, and is in most cases exactly\r\nlike the male.\r\n\r\n1. Kingfishers (Alcedinidæ). In some of the most brilliant species of\r\nthis family the female exactly resembles the male; in others there is a\r\nsexual difference, but it rarely tends to make the female less\r\nconspicuous. In some, the female has a band across the breast, which is\r\nwanting in the male, as in the beautiful Halcyon diops of Ternate. In\r\nothers the band is rufous in the female, as in several of the American\r\nspecies; while in Dacelo gaudichaudii, and others of the same genus, the\r\ntail of the female is rufous, while that of the male is blue. In most\r\nkingfishers the nest is in a deep hole in the ground; in Tanysiptera it\r\nis said to be in a hole in the nests of termites, or sometimes in\r\ncrevices under overhanging rocks.\r\n\r\n2. Motmots (Momotidæ). In these showy birds the sexes are exactly alike,\r\nand the nest in a hole under ground.\r\n\r\n3. Puff-birds (Bucconidæ). These birds are often gaily coloured; some\r\nhave coral-red bills; the sexes are exactly alike, and the nest is in a\r\nhole in sloping ground.\r\n\r\n4. Trogons (Trogonidæ). In these magnificent birds the females are\r\ngenerally less brightly coloured than the males, but are yet often gay\r\nand conspicuous. The nest is in a hole of a tree.\r\n\r\n5. Hoopoes (Upupidæ). The barred plumage and long crests of these birds\r\nrender them conspicuous. The sexes are exactly alike, and the nest is in\r\na hollow tree.\r\n\r\n6. Hornbills (Bucerotidæ). These large birds have enormous coloured\r\nbills, which are generally quite as well coloured and conspicuous in the\r\nfemales. Their nests are always in hollow trees, where the female is\r\nentirely concealed.\r\n\r\n7. Barbets (Capitonidæ). These birds are all very gaily-coloured, and,\r\nwhat is remarkable, the most brilliant patches of colour are disposed\r\nabout the head and neck, and are very conspicuous. The sexes are\r\nexactly alike, and the nest is in a hole of a tree.\r\n\r\n8. Toucans (Rhamphastidæ). These fine birds are coloured in the most\r\nconspicuous parts of their body, especially on the large bill, and on\r\nthe upper and lower tail coverts, which are crimson, white, or yellow.\r\nThe sexes are exactly alike, and they always build in a hollow tree.\r\n\r\n9. Plaintain-eaters (Musophagidæ). Here again the head and bill are most\r\nbrilliantly coloured in both sexes, and the nest is in a hole of a tree.\r\n\r\n10. Ground cuckoos (Centropus). These birds are often of conspicuous\r\ncolours, and are alike in both sexes. They build a domed nest.\r\n\r\n11. Woodpeckers (Picidæ). In this family the females often differ from\r\nthe males, in having a yellow or white, instead of a crimson crest, but\r\nare almost as conspicuous. They all nest in holes in trees.\r\n\r\n12. Parrots (Psittaci). In this great tribe, adorned with the most\r\nbrilliant and varied colours, the rule is, that the sexes are precisely\r\nalike, and this is the case in the most gorgeous families, the lories,\r\nthe cockatoos, and the macaws; but in some there is a sexual difference\r\nof colour to a slight extent. All build in holes, mostly in trees, but\r\nsometimes in the ground, or in white ants' nests. In the single case in\r\nwhich the nest is exposed, that of the Australian ground parrot,\r\nPezoporus formosus, the bird has lost the gay colouring of its allies,\r\nand is clothed in sombre and completely protective tints of dusky green\r\nand black.\r\n\r\n13. Gapers (Eurylæmidæ). In these beautiful Eastern birds, somewhat\r\nallied to the American chatterers, the sexes are exactly alike, and are\r\nadorned with the most gay and conspicuous markings. The nest is a woven\r\nstructure, _covered over_, and suspended from the extremities of\r\nbranches over water.\r\n\r\n14. Pardalotus (Ampelidæ). In these Australian birds the females differ\r\nfrom the males, but are often very conspicuous, having brightly-spotted\r\nheads. Their nests are sometimes dome-shaped, sometimes in holes of\r\ntrees, or in burrows in the ground.\r\n\r\n15. Tits (Paridæ). These little birds are always pretty, and many\r\n(especially among the Indian species) are very conspicuous. They always\r\nhave the sexes alike, a circumstance very unusual among the smaller\r\ngaily-coloured birds of our own country. The nest is always covered over\r\nor concealed in a hole.\r\n\r\n16. Nuthatches (Sitta). Often very pretty birds, the sexes alike, and\r\nthe nest in a hole.\r\n\r\n17.---- (Sittella). The female of these Australian nuthatches is often\r\nthe most conspicuous, being white-and black-marked. The nest is,\r\naccording to Gould, \"completely concealed among upright twigs connected\r\ntogether.\"\r\n\r\n18. Creepers (Climacteris). In these Australian creepers the sexes are\r\nalike, or the female most conspicuous, and the nest is in a hole of a\r\ntree.\r\n\r\n19. Estrelda, Amadina. In these genera of Eastern and Australian finches\r\nthe females, although more or less different from the males, are still\r\nvery conspicuous having a red rump, or being white spotted. They differ\r\nfrom most others of the family in building domed nests.\r\n\r\n20. Certhiola. In these pretty little American creepers the sexes are\r\nalike, and they build a domed nest.\r\n\r\n21. Mynahs (Sturnidæ). These showy Eastern starlings have the sexes\r\nexactly alike. They build in holes of trees.\r\n\r\n22. Calornis (Sturnidæ). These brilliant metallic starlings have no\r\nsexual differences. They build a pensile covered nest.\r\n\r\n23. Hangnests (Icteridæ). The red or yellow and black plumage of most of\r\nthese birds is very conspicuous, and is exactly alike in both sexes.\r\nThey are celebrated for their fine purse-shaped pensile nests.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that this list comprehends six important families of\r\nFissirostres, four of Scansores, the Psittaci, and several genera, with\r\nthree entire families of Passeres, comprising about twelve hundred\r\nspecies, or about one-seventh of all known birds.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe cases in which, whenever the male is gaily coloured, the female is\r\nmuch less gay or quite inconspicuous, are exceedingly numerous,\r\ncomprising, in fact, almost all the bright-coloured Passeres, except\r\nthose enumerated in the preceding class. The following are the most\r\nremarkable:--\r\n\r\n1. Chatterers (Cotingidæ). These comprise some of the most gorgeous\r\nbirds in the world, vivid blues, rich purples, and bright reds, being\r\nthe most characteristic colours. The females are always obscurely\r\ntinted, and are often of a greenish hue, not easily visible among the\r\nfoliage.\r\n\r\n2. Manakins (Pipridæ). These elegant birds, whose caps or crests are of\r\nthe most brilliant colours, are usually of a sombre green in the female\r\nsex.\r\n\r\n3. Tanagers (Tanagridæ). These rival the chatterers in the brilliancy of\r\ntheir colours, and are even more varied. The females are generally of\r\nplain and sombre hues, and always less conspicuous than the males.\r\n\r\nIn the extensive families of the warblers (Sylviadæ), thrushes\r\n(Turdidæ), flycatchers (Muscicapidæ), and shrikes (Laniadæ), a\r\nconsiderable proportion of the species are beautifully marked with gay\r\nand conspicuous tints, as is also the case in the Pheasants and Grouse;\r\nbut in every case the females are less gay, and are most frequently of\r\nthe very plainest and least conspicuous hues. Now, throughout _the whole\r\nof these families the nest is open_, and I am not aware of a single\r\ninstance in which any one of these birds builds a _domed nest_, or\r\nplaces it in a _hole of a tree_, or _underground_, or in any place where\r\nit is effectually concealed.\r\n\r\nIn considering the question we are now investigating, it is not\r\nnecessary to take into account the larger and more powerful birds,\r\nbecause these seldom depend much on concealment to secure their safety.\r\nIn the raptorial birds bright colours are as a rule absent; and their\r\nstructure and habits are such as not to require any special protection\r\nfor the female. The larger waders are sometimes very brightly coloured\r\nin both sexes; but they are probably little subject to the attacks of\r\nenemies, since the scarlet ibis, the most conspicuous of birds, exists\r\nin immense quantities in South America. In game birds and water-fowl,\r\nhowever, the females are often very plainly coloured, when the males are\r\nadorned with brilliant hues; and the abnormal family of the Megapodidæ\r\noffers us the interesting fact of an identity in the colours of the\r\nsexes (which in Megacephalon and Talegalla are somewhat conspicuous), in\r\nconjunction with the habit of not sitting on the eggs at all.\r\n\r\n\r\n_What the Facts Teach us._\r\n\r\nTaking the whole body of evidence here brought forward, embracing as it\r\ndoes almost every group of bright-coloured birds, it will, I think, be\r\nadmitted that the relation between the two series of facts in the\r\ncolouring and nidification of birds has been sufficiently established.\r\nThere are, it is true, a few apparent and some real exceptions, which I\r\nshall consider presently; but they are too few and unimportant to weigh\r\nmuch against the mass of evidence on the other side, and may for the\r\npresent be neglected. Let us then consider what we are to do with this\r\nunexpected set of correspondences between groups of phenomena which, at\r\nfirst sight, appear so disconnected. Do they fall in with any other\r\ngroups of natural phenomena? Do they teach us anything of the way in\r\nwhich nature works, and give us any insight into the causes which have\r\nbrought about the marvellous variety, and beauty, and harmony of living\r\nthings? I believe we can answer these questions in the affirmative; and\r\nI may mention, as a sufficient proof that these are not isolated facts,\r\nthat I was first led to see their relation to each other by the study of\r\nan analogous though distinct set of phenomena among insects, that of\r\nprotective resemblance and \"mimicry.\"\r\n\r\nOn considering this remarkable series of corresponding facts, the first\r\nthing we are taught by them seems to be, that there is no incapacity in\r\nthe female sex among birds, to receive the same bright hues and strongly\r\ncontrasted tints with which their partners are so often decorated, since\r\nwhenever they are _protected and concealed_ during the period of\r\nincubation _they are similarly adorned_. The fair inference is, that it\r\nis chiefly due to the absence of protection or concealment during this\r\nimportant epoch, that gay and conspicuous tints are withheld or left\r\nundeveloped. The mode in which this has been effected is very\r\nintelligible, if we admit the action of natural and sexual selection. It\r\nwould appear from the numerous cases in which both sexes are adorned\r\nwith equally brilliant colours (while both sexes are rarely armed with\r\nequally developed offensive and defensive weapons when not required for\r\nindividual safety), that the normal action of \"sexual selection\" is to\r\ndevelop colour and beauty in both sexes, by the preservation and\r\nmultiplication of all varieties of colour in either sex which are\r\npleasing to the other. Several very close observers of the habits of\r\nanimals have assured me, that male birds and quadrupeds do often take\r\nvery strong likes and dislikes to individual females, and we can hardly\r\nbelieve that the one sex (the female) can have a general taste for\r\ncolour while the other has no such taste. However this may be, the fact\r\nremains, that in a vast number of cases the female acquires as brilliant\r\nand as varied colours as the male, and therefore most probably acquires\r\nthem in the same way as the male does; that is, either because the\r\ncolour is useful to it, or is correlated with some useful variation, or\r\nis pleasing to the other sex. The only remaining supposition is that it\r\nis transmitted from the other sex, without being of any use. From the\r\nnumber of examples above adduced of bright colours in the female, this\r\nwould imply that colour-characters acquired by one sex are generally\r\n(but not necessarily) transmitted to the other. If this be the case it\r\nwill, I think, enable us to explain the phenomena, even if we do not\r\nadmit that the male bird is ever influenced in the choice of a mate by\r\nher more gay or perfect plumage.\r\n\r\nThe female bird, while sitting on her eggs in an uncovered nest, is much\r\nexposed to the attacks of enemies, and any modification of colour which\r\nrendered her more conspicuous would often lead to her destruction and\r\nthat of her offspring. All variations of colour in this direction in the\r\nfemale, would therefore sooner or later be eliminated, while such\r\nmodifications as rendered her inconspicuous, by assimilating her to\r\nsurrounding objects, as the earth or the foliage, would, on the whole,\r\nsurvive the longest, and thus lead to the attainment of those brown or\r\ngreen and inconspicuous tints, which form the colouring (of the upper\r\nsurface at least), of the vast majority of female birds which sit upon\r\nopen nests.\r\n\r\nThis does not imply, as some have thought, that all female birds were\r\nonce as brilliant as the males. The change has been a very gradual one,\r\ngenerally dating from the origin of genera or of larger groups, but\r\nthere can be no doubt that the remote ancestry of birds having great\r\nsexual differences of colour, were nearly or quite alike, sometimes\r\n(perhaps in most cases) more nearly resembling the female, but\r\noccasionally perhaps being nearer what the male is now. The young birds\r\n(which usually resemble the females) will probably give some idea of\r\nthis ancestral type, and it is well known that the young of allied\r\nspecies and of different sexes are often undistinguishable.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Colour more variable than Structure or Habits, and therefore the\r\nCharacter which has generally been Modified._\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of this essay, I have endeavoured to prove, that the\r\ncharacteristic differences and the essential features of birds' nests,\r\nare dependent on the structure of the species and upon the present and\r\npast conditions of their existence. Both these factors are more\r\nimportant and less variable than colour; and we must therefore conclude\r\nthat in most cases the mode of nidification (dependent on structure and\r\nenvironment) has been the cause, and not the effect, of the similarity\r\nor differences of the sexes as regards colour. When the confirmed habit\r\nof a group of birds, was to build their nests in holes of trees like the\r\ntoucans, or in holes in the ground like the kingfishers, the protection\r\nthe female thus obtained, during the important and dangerous time of\r\nincubation, placed the two sexes on an equality as regards exposure to\r\nattack, and allowed \"sexual selection,\" or any other cause, to act\r\nunchecked in the development of gay colours and conspicuous markings in\r\nboth sexes.\r\n\r\nWhen, on the other hand (as in the Tanagers and Flycatchers), the habit\r\nof the whole group was to build open cup-shaped nests in more or less\r\nexposed situations, the production of colour and marking in the female,\r\nby whatever cause, was continually checked by its rendering her too\r\nconspicuous, while in the male it had free play, and developed in him\r\nthe most gorgeous hues. This, however, was not perhaps universally the\r\ncase; for where there was more than usual intelligence and capacity for\r\nchange of habits, the danger the female was exposed to by a partial\r\nbrightness of colour or marking might lead to the construction of a\r\nconcealed or covered nest, as in the case of the Tits and Hangnests.\r\nWhen this occurred, a special protection to the female would be no\r\nlonger necessary; so that the acquisition of colour and the modification\r\nof the nest, might in some cases act and react on each other and attain\r\ntheir full development together.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Exceptional Cases confirmatory of the above Explanation._\r\n\r\nThere exist a few very curious and anomalous facts in the natural\r\nhistory of birds, which fortunately serve as crucial tests of the truth\r\nof this mode of explaining the inequalities of sexual colouration. It\r\nhas been long known, that in some species the males either assisted in,\r\nor wholly performed, the act of incubation. It has also been often\r\nnoticed, that in certain birds the usual sexual differences were\r\nreversed, the male being the more plainly coloured, the female more gay\r\nand often larger. I am not, however, aware that these two anomalies had\r\never been supposed to stand to each other in the relation of cause and\r\neffect, till I adduced them in support of my views of the general theory\r\nof protective adaptation. Yet it is undoubtedly the fact, that in the\r\nbest known cases in which the female bird is more conspicuously coloured\r\nthan the male, it is either positively ascertained that the latter\r\nperforms the duties of incubation, or there are good reasons for\r\nbelieving such to be the case. The most satisfactory example is that of\r\nthe Gray Phalarope (Phalaropus fulicarius), the sexes of which are alike\r\nin winter, while in summer the female instead of the male takes on a gay\r\nand conspicuous nuptial plumage; but the male performs the duties of\r\nincubation, sitting upon the eggs, which are laid upon the bare ground.\r\n\r\nIn the Dotterell (Eudromias morinellus) the female is larger and more\r\nbrightly coloured than the male; and here, also, it is almost certain\r\nthat the latter sits upon the eggs. The Turnices of India also, have the\r\nfemale larger and often more brightly coloured; and Mr. Jerdon states,\r\nin his \"Birds of India,\" that the natives report, that, during the\r\nbreeding season, the females desert their eggs and associate in flocks,\r\nwhile the males are employed in hatching the eggs. In the few other\r\ncases in which the females are more brightly coloured, the habits are\r\nnot accurately known. The case of the Ostriches and Emeus will occur to\r\nmany as a difficulty, for here the male incubates, but is not less\r\nconspicuous than the female; but there are two reasons why the case does\r\nnot apply;--the birds are too large to derive any safety from\r\nconcealment, from enemies which would devour the eggs they can defend\r\nthemselves by force, while to escape from their personal foes they trust\r\nto speed.\r\n\r\nWe find, therefore, that a very large mass of facts relating to the\r\nsexual colouration and the mode of nidification of birds, including some\r\nof the most extraordinary anomalies to be found in their natural\r\nhistory, can be shown to have an interdependent relation to each other,\r\non the simple principle of the need of greater protection to that parent\r\nwhich performs the duties of incubation. Considering the very imperfect\r\nknowledge we possess of the habits of most extra-European birds, the\r\nexceptions to the prevalent rule are few, and generally occur in\r\nisolated species or in small groups; while several apparent exceptions\r\ncan be shown to be really confirmations of the law.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Real or apparent Exceptions to the Law stated at page 240._\r\n\r\nThe only marked exceptions I have been able to discover are the\r\nfollowing:--\r\n\r\n1. King crows (Dicrourus). These birds are of a glossy black colour with\r\nlong forked tails. The sexes present no difference, and they build open\r\nnests. This apparent exception may probably be accounted for by the fact\r\nthat these birds do not need the protection of a less conspicuous\r\ncolour. They are very pugnacious, and often attack and drive away crows,\r\nhawks, and kites; and as they are semi-gregarious in their habits, the\r\nfemales are not likely to be attacked while incubating.\r\n\r\n2. Orioles (Oriolidæ). The true orioles are very gay birds; the sexes\r\nare, in many Eastern species, either nearly or quite alike, and the\r\nnests are open. This is one of the most serious exceptions, but it is\r\none that to some extent proves the rule; for in this case it has been\r\nnoticed, that the parent birds display excessive care and solicitude in\r\nconcealing the nest among thick foliage, and in protecting their\r\noffspring by incessant and anxious watching. This indicates that the\r\nwant of protection consequent on the bright colour of the female makes\r\nitself felt, and is obviated by an increased development of the mental\r\nfaculties.\r\n\r\n3. Ground thrushes (Pittidæ). These elegant and brilliantly-coloured\r\nbirds are generally alike in both sexes, and build an open nest. It is\r\ncurious, however, that this is only an apparent exception, for almost\r\nall the bright colours are on the under surface, the back being usually\r\nolive green or brown, and the head black, with brown or whitish stripes,\r\nall which colours would harmonize with the foliage, sticks, and roots\r\nwhich surround the nest, built on or near the ground, and thus serve as\r\na protection to the female bird.\r\n\r\n4. Grallina Australis. This Australian bird is of strongly contrasted\r\nblack and white colours. The sexes are exactly alike, and it builds an\r\nopen clay nest in an exposed situation on a tree. This appears to be a\r\nmost striking exception, but I am by no means sure that it is so. We\r\nrequire to know what tree it usually builds on, the colour of the bark\r\nor of the lichens that grow upon it, the tints of the ground, or of\r\nother surrounding objects, before we can say that the bird, when sitting\r\non its nest, is really conspicuous. It has been remarked that small\r\npatches of white and black blend at a short distance to form grey, one\r\nof the commonest tints of natural objects.\r\n\r\n5. Sunbirds (Nectarineidæ). In these beautiful little birds the males\r\nonly are adorned with brilliant colours, the females being quite plain,\r\nyet they build covered nests in all the cases in which the nidification\r\nis known. This is a negative rather than a positive exception to the\r\nrule, since there may be other causes besides the need for protection,\r\nwhich prevent the female acquiring the gay colours of her mate, and\r\nthere is one curious circumstance which tends to elucidate it. The male\r\nof Leptocoma zeylanica is said to assist in incubation. It is possible,\r\ntherefore, that the group may originally have used open nests, and some\r\nchange of conditions, leading the male bird to sit, may have been\r\nfollowed by the adoption of a domed nest. This is, however, the most\r\nserious exception I have yet found to the general rule.\r\n\r\n6. Superb warblers (Maluridæ). The males of these little birds are\r\nadorned with the most gorgeous colours, while the females are very\r\nplain, yet they make domed nests. It is to be observed, however, that\r\nthe male plumage is nuptial merely, and is retained for a very short\r\ntime; the rest of the year both sexes are plain alike. It is probable,\r\ntherefore, that the domed nest is for the protection of these delicate\r\nlittle birds against the rain, and that there is some unknown cause\r\nwhich has led to the development of colour in the males only.\r\n\r\nThere is one other case which at first sight looks like an exception,\r\nbut which is far from being one in reality, and deserves to be\r\nmentioned. In the beautiful Waxwing, (Bombycilla garrula,) the sexes are\r\nvery nearly alike, and the elegant red wax tips to the wing-feathers are\r\nnearly, and sometimes quite, as conspicuous in the female as in the\r\nmale. Yet it builds an open nest, and a person looking at the bird would\r\nsay it ought according to my theory to cover its nest. But it is, in\r\nreality, as completely protected by its colouration as the most plainly\r\ncoloured bird that flies. It breeds only in very high latitudes, and the\r\nnest, placed in fir-trees, is formed chiefly of lichens. Now the\r\ndelicate gray and ashy and purplish hues of the head and back, together\r\nwith the yellow of the wings and tail, are tints that exactly harmonize\r\nwith the colours of various species of lichens, while the brilliant red\r\nwax tips exactly represent the crimson fructification of the common\r\nlichen, Cladonia coccifera. When sitting on its nest, therefore, the\r\nfemale bird will exhibit no colours that are not common to the materials\r\nof which it is constructed; and the several tints are distributed in\r\nabout the same proportions as they occur in nature. At a short distance\r\nthe bird would be indistinguishable from the nest it is sitting on, or\r\nfrom a natural clump of lichens, and will thus be completely protected.\r\n\r\nI think I have now noticed all exceptions of any importance to the law\r\nof dependence of sexual colour on nidification. It will be seen that\r\nthey are very few in number, compared with those which support the\r\ngeneralization; and in several cases there are circumstances in the\r\nhabits or structure of the species that sufficiently explain them. It is\r\nremarkable also that I have found scarcely any _positive_ exceptions,\r\nthat is, cases of very brilliant or conspicuous female birds in which\r\nthe nest was not concealed. Much less can there be shown any group of\r\nbirds, in which the females are all of decidedly conspicuous colours on\r\nthe upper surface, and yet sit in open nests. The many cases in which\r\nbirds of dull colours in both sexes make domed or concealed nests, do\r\nnot, of course, affect this theory one way or the other; since its\r\npurpose is only to account for the fact, that brilliant females of\r\nbrilliant males are _always_ found to have covered or hidden nests,\r\nwhile obscure females of brilliant males _almost always_ have open and\r\nexposed nests. The fact that all classes of nests occur with dull\r\ncoloured birds in both sexes merely shows, as I have strongly\r\nmaintained, that in most cases the character of the nest determines the\r\ncolouration of the female, and not _vice versâ_.\r\n\r\nIf the views here advocated are correct, as to the various influences\r\nthat have determined the specialities of every bird's nest, and the\r\ngeneral colouration of female birds, with their action and reaction on\r\neach other, we can hardly expect to find evidence more complete than\r\nthat here set forth. Nature is such a tangled web of complex relations,\r\nthat a series of correspondences running through hundreds of species,\r\ngenera, and families, in every part of the system, can hardly fail to\r\nindicate a true casual connexion; and when, of the two factors in the\r\nproblem, one can be shown to be dependent on the most deeply seated and\r\nthe most stable facts of structure and conditions of life, while the\r\nother is a character universally admitted to be superficial and easily\r\nmodified, there can be little doubt as to which is cause and which\r\neffect.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Various modes of Protection of Animals._\r\n\r\nBut the explanation of the phenomenon here attempted does not rest alone\r\non the facts I have been able now to adduce. In the essay on \"Mimicry,\"\r\nit is shown how important a part the necessity for protection has\r\nplayed, in determining the external form and colouration, and sometimes\r\neven the internal structure of animals.\r\n\r\nAs illustrating this latter point, I may refer to the remarkable hooked,\r\nbranched, or star-like spiculæ in many sponges, which are believed to\r\nhave the function chiefly, of rendering them unpalatable to other\r\ncreatures. The Holothuridæ or sea-cucumbers possess a similar\r\nprotection, many of them having anchor-shaped spicules embedded in their\r\nskin, as the Synapta; while others (Cuviera squamata) are covered with a\r\nhard calcareous pavement. Many of these are of a bright red or purple\r\ncolour, and are very conspicuous, while the allied Trepang, or\r\nBeche-de-mer (Holothuria edulis), which is not armed with any such\r\ndefensive weapons, is of a dull sand-or mud-colour, so as hardly to be\r\ndistinguished from the sea bed on which it reposes. Many of the smaller\r\nmarine animals are protected by their almost invisible transparency,\r\nwhile those that are most brightly coloured will be often found to have\r\na special protection, either in stinging tentacles like Physalia, or in\r\na hard calcareous crust, as in the star fishes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Females of some Groups require and obtain more Protection than the\r\nMales._\r\n\r\nIn the struggle for existence incessantly going on, protection or\r\nconcealment is one of the most general and most effectual means of\r\nmaintaining life; and it is by modifications of colour that this\r\nprotection can be most readily obtained, since no other character is\r\nsubject to such numerous and rapid variations. The case I have now\r\nendeavoured to illustrate is exactly analogous to what occurs among\r\nbutterflies. As a general rule, the female butterfly is of dull and\r\ninconspicuous colours, even when the male is most gorgeously arrayed;\r\nbut when the species is protected from attack by a disagreeable odour,\r\nas in the Heliconidæ, Danaidæ and Acroeidæ, both sexes display the same\r\nor equally brilliant hues. Among the species which gain a protection by\r\nimitating these, the very weak and slow-flying Leptalides resemble them\r\nin both sexes, because both sexes alike require protection, while in the\r\nmore active and strong-winged genera--Papilio, Pieris, and Diadema--it\r\nis generally the females only that mimic the protected groups, and in\r\ndoing so often become actually more gay and more conspicuous than the\r\nmales, thus reversing the usual and in fact almost universal characters\r\nof the sexes. So, in the wonderful Eastern leaf-insects of the genus\r\nPhyllium, it is the female only that so marvellously imitates a green\r\nleaf; and in all these cases the difference can be traced to the greater\r\nneed of protection for the female, on whose continued existence, while\r\ndepositing her eggs, the safety of the race depends. In Mammalia and in\r\nreptiles, however brilliant the colours may be, there is rarely any\r\ndifference between that of the sexes, because the female is not\r\nnecessarily more exposed to attack than the male. It may, I think, be\r\nlooked upon as a confirmation of this view, that no single case is known\r\neither in the above-named genera--Papilio, Pieris, and Diadema--or in\r\nany other butterfly, of a male _alone_, mimicking one of the Danaidæ or\r\nHeliconidæ. Yet the necessary colour is far more abundant in the males,\r\nand variations always seem ready for any useful purpose. This seems to\r\ndepend on the general law, that each species and each sex can only be\r\nmodified just as far as is absolutely necessary for it to maintain\r\nitself in the struggle for existence, not a step further. A male insect\r\nby its structure and habits is less exposed to danger, and also requires\r\nless protection than the female. It cannot, therefore, alone acquire any\r\nfurther protection through the agency of natural selection. But the\r\nfemale requires some extra protection, to balance the greater danger to\r\nwhich she is exposed, and her greater importance to the existence of the\r\nspecies; and this she always acquires, in one way or another, through\r\nthe action of natural selection.\r\n\r\nIn his \"Origin of Species,\" fourth edition, p. 241, Mr. Darwin\r\nrecognises the necessity for protection as sometimes being a cause of\r\nthe obscure colours of female birds; but he does not seem to consider it\r\nso very important an agent in modifying colour as I am disposed to do.\r\nIn the same paragraph (p. 240), he alludes to the fact of female birds\r\nand butterflies being sometimes very plain, sometimes as gay as the\r\nmales; but, apparently, considers this mainly due to peculiar laws of\r\ninheritance, which sometimes continue acquired colour in the line of one\r\nsex only, sometimes in both. Without denying the action of such a law\r\n(which Mr. Darwin informs me he has facts to support), I impute the\r\ndifference, in the great majority of cases, to the greater or less need\r\nof protection in the female sex in these groups of animals.\r\n\r\nThis need was seen to exist a century ago by the Hon. Daines Barrington,\r\nwho, in the article already quoted (see p. 220), after alluding to the\r\nfact that singing birds are all small, and suggesting (but I think\r\nerroneously) that this may have arisen from the difficulty larger birds\r\nwould have in concealing themselves if they called the attention of\r\ntheir enemies by loud notes, goes on thus:--\"I should rather conceive it\r\nis for the same reason no hen bird sings, because this talent would be\r\nstill more dangerous during incubation, which _may possibly also account\r\nfor the inferiority in point of plumage_.\" This is a curious\r\nanticipation of the main idea on which this essay is founded. It has\r\nbeen unnoticed for near a century, and my attention was only recently\r\ncalled to it by Mr. Darwin himself.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Conclusion._\r\n\r\nTo some persons it will perhaps appear, that the causes to which I\r\nimpute so much of the external aspect of nature are too simple, too\r\ninsignificant, and too unimportant for such a mighty work. But I would\r\nask them to consider, that the great object of all the peculiarities of\r\nanimal structure is to preserve the life of the individual, and to\r\nmaintain the existence of the species. Colour has hitherto been too\r\noften looked upon as something adventitious and superficial, something\r\ngiven to an animal not to be useful to itself, but solely to gratify man\r\nor even superior beings--to add to the beauty and ideal harmony of\r\nnature. If this were the case, then, it is evident that the colours of\r\norganised beings would be an exception to most other natural phenomena.\r\nThey would not be the product of general laws, or determined by\r\never-changing external conditions; and we must give up all enquiry into\r\ntheir origin and causes, since (by the hypothesis) they are dependent on\r\na Will whose motives must ever be unknown to us. But, strange to say, no\r\nsooner do we begin to examine and classify the colours of natural\r\nobjects, than we find that they are intimately related to a variety of\r\nother phenomena, and are, like them, strictly subordinated to general\r\nlaws. I have here attempted to elucidate some of these laws in the case\r\nof birds, and have shown how the mode of nidification has affected the\r\ncolouring of the female sex in this group. I have before shown to how\r\ngreat an extent, and in how many ways, the need of protection has\r\ndetermined the colours of insects, and of some groups of reptiles and\r\nmammalia, and I would now call particular attention to the fact that the\r\ngay tints of flowers, so long supposed to be a convincing proof that\r\ncolour has been bestowed for other purposes than the good of its\r\npossessor, have been shown by Mr. Darwin to follow the same great law of\r\nutility. Flowers do not often need protection, but very often require\r\nthe aid of insects to fertilize them, and maintain their reproductive\r\npowers in the greatest vigour. Their gay colours attract insects, as do\r\nalso their sweet odours and honeyed secretions; and that this is the\r\nmain function of colour in flowers is shown by the striking fact, that\r\nthose flowers which can be perfectly fertilized by the wind, and do not\r\nneed the aid of insects, _rarely or never have gaily-coloured flowers_.\r\n\r\nThis wide extension of the general principle of utility to the colours\r\nof such varied groups, both in the animal and vegetable kingdoms,\r\ncompels us to acknowledge that the \"reign of law\" has been fairly traced\r\ninto this stronghold of the advocates of special creation. And to those\r\nwho oppose the explanation I have given of the facts adduced in this\r\nessay, I would again respectfully urge that they must grapple with the\r\nwhole of the facts, not one or two of them only. It will be admitted\r\nthat, on the theory of evolution and natural selection, a wide range of\r\nfacts with regard to colour in nature have been co-ordinated and\r\nexplained. Until at least an equally wide range of facts can be shown to\r\nbe in harmony with any other theory, we can hardly be expected to\r\nabandon that which has already done such good service, and which has led\r\nto the discovery of so many interesting and unexpected harmonies among\r\nthe most common (but hitherto most neglected and least understood), of\r\nthe phenomena presented by organised beings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVIII.\r\n\r\nCREATION BY LAW.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the various criticisms that have appeared on Mr. Darwin's\r\ncelebrated \"Origin of Species,\" there is, perhaps, none that will appeal\r\nto so large a number of well educated and intelligent persons, as that\r\ncontained in the Duke of Argyll's \"Reign of Law.\" The noble author\r\nrepresents the feelings and expresses the ideas of that large class, who\r\ntake a keen interest in the progress of Science in general, and\r\nespecially that of Natural History, but have never themselves studied\r\nnature in detail, or acquired that personal knowledge of the structure\r\nof closely allied forms,--the wonderful gradations from species to\r\nspecies and from group to group, and the infinite variety of the\r\nphenomena of \"variation\" in organic beings,--which are absolutely\r\nnecessary for a full appreciation of the facts and reasonings contained\r\nin Mr. Darwin's great work.\r\n\r\nNearly half of the Duke's book is devoted to an exposition of his idea\r\nof \"Creation by Law,\" and he expresses so clearly what are his\r\ndifficulties and objections as regards the theory of \"Natural\r\nSelection,\" that I think it advisable that they should be fairly\r\nanswered, and that his own views should be shown to lead to conclusions,\r\nas hard to accept as any which he imputes to Mr. Darwin.\r\n\r\nThe point on which the Duke of Argyll lays most stress, is, that proofs\r\nof Mind everywhere meet us in Nature, and are more especially manifest\r\nwherever we find \"contrivance\" or \"beauty.\" He maintains that this\r\nindicates the constant supervision and direct interference of the\r\nCreator, and cannot possibly be explained by the unassisted action of\r\nany combination of laws. Now, Mr. Darwin's work has for its main object,\r\nto show, that all the phenomena of living things,--all their wonderful\r\norgans and complicated structures, their infinite variety of form, size,\r\nand colour, their intricate and involved relations to each other,--may\r\nhave been produced by the action of a few general laws of the simplest\r\nkind, laws which are in most cases mere statements of admitted facts.\r\nThe chief of these laws or facts are the following:--\r\n\r\n1. _The Law of Multiplication in Geometrical Progression._--All\r\norganized beings have enormous powers of multiplication. Even man, who\r\nincreases slower than all other animals, could under the most favourable\r\ncircumstances double his numbers every fifteen years, or a hundred-fold\r\nin a century. Many animals and plants could increase their numbers from\r\nten to a thousand-fold every year.\r\n\r\n2. _The Law of Limited Populations._--The number of living individuals\r\nof each species in any country, or in the whole globe, is practically\r\nstationary; whence it follows that the whole of this enormous increase\r\nmust die off almost as fast as produced, except only those individuals\r\nfor whom room is made by the death of parents. As a simple but striking\r\nexample, take an oak forest. Every oak will drop annually thousands or\r\nmillions of acorns, but till an old tree falls, not one of these\r\nmillions can grow up into an oak. They must die at various stages of\r\ngrowth.\r\n\r\n3. _The Law of Heredity, or Likeness of Offspring to their\r\nParents._--This is a universal, but not an absolute law. All creatures\r\nresemble their parents in a high degree, and in the majority of cases\r\nvery accurately; so that even individual peculiarities, of whatever\r\nkind, in the parents, are almost always transmitted to some of the\r\noffspring.\r\n\r\n4. _The Law of Variation._--This is fully expressed by the lines:--\r\n\r\n    \"No being on this earthly ball,\r\n    Is like another, all in all.\"\r\n\r\nOffspring resemble their parents very much, but not wholly--each being\r\npossesses its individuality. This \"variation\" itself varies in amount,\r\nbut it is always present, not only in the whole being, but in every part\r\nof every being. Every organ, every character, every feeling is\r\nindividual; that is to say, _varies_ from the same organ, character, or\r\nfeeling in every other individual.\r\n\r\n5. _The Law of unceasing Change of Physical Conditions upon the Surface\r\nof the Earth._--Geology shows us that this change has always gone on in\r\ntimes past, and we also know that it is now everywhere going on.\r\n\r\n6. _The Equilibrium or Harmony of Nature._--When a species is well\r\nadapted to the conditions which environ it, it flourishes; when\r\nimperfectly adapted it decays; when ill-adapted it becomes extinct. If\r\n_all_ the conditions which determine an organism's well-being are taken\r\ninto consideration, this statement can hardly be disputed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis series of facts or laws, are mere statements of what is the\r\ncondition of nature. They are facts or inferences which are generally\r\nknown, generally admitted--but in discussing the subject of the \"Origin\r\nof Species\"--as generally forgotten. It is from these universally\r\nadmitted facts, that the origin of all the varied forms of nature may be\r\ndeduced by a logical chain of reasoning, which, however, is at every\r\nstep verified and shown to be in strict accord with facts; and, at the\r\nsame time, many curious phenomena which can by no other means be\r\nunderstood, are explained and accounted for. It is probable, that these\r\nprimary facts or laws are but results of the very nature of life, and of\r\nthe essential properties of organized and unorganized matter. Mr.\r\nHerbert Spencer, in his \"First Principles\" and his \"Biology\" has, I\r\nthink, made us able to understand how this may be; but at present we may\r\naccept these simple laws without going further back, and the question\r\nthen is--whether the variety, the harmony, the contrivance, and the\r\nbeauty we perceive in organic beings, can have been produced by the\r\naction of these laws alone, or whether we are required to believe in the\r\nincessant interference and direct action of the mind and will of the\r\nCreator. It is simply a question of how the Creator has worked. The\r\nDuke (and I quote him as having well expressed the views of the more\r\nintelligent of Mr. Darwin's opponents) maintains, that He has personally\r\napplied general laws to produce effects, which those laws are not in\r\nthemselves capable of producing; that the universe alone, with all its\r\nlaws intact, would be a sort of chaos, without variety, without harmony,\r\nwithout design, without beauty; that there is not (and therefore we may\r\npresume that there could not be) any self-developing power in the\r\nuniverse. I believe, on the contrary, that the universe is so\r\nconstituted as to be self-regulating; that as long as it contains Life,\r\nthe forms under which that life is manifested have an inherent power of\r\nadjustment to each other and to surrounding nature; and that this\r\nadjustment necessarily leads to the greatest amount of variety and\r\nbeauty and enjoyment, because it does depend on general laws, and not on\r\na continual supervision and re-arrangement of details. As a matter of\r\nfeeling and religion, I hold this to be a far higher conception of the\r\nCreator and of the Universe than that which may be called the \"continual\r\ninterference\" hypothesis; but it is not a question to be decided by our\r\nfeelings or convictions, it is a question of facts and of reason. Could\r\nthe change, which Geology shows us has ever taken place in the forms of\r\nlife, have been produced by general laws, or does it imperatively\r\nrequire the incessant supervision of a creative mind? This is the\r\nquestion for us to consider, and our opponents have the difficult task\r\nof proving a negative, if we show that there are both facts and\r\nanalogies in our favour.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mr. Darwin's Metaphors liable to Misconception._\r\n\r\nMr. Darwin has laid himself open to much misconception, and has given to\r\nhis opponents a powerful weapon against himself, by his continual use of\r\nmetaphor in describing the wonderful co-adaptations of organic beings.\r\n\r\n\"It is curious,\" says the Duke of Argyll, \"to observe the language\r\nwhich this most advanced disciple of pure naturalism instinctively\r\nuses, when he has to describe the complicated structure of this curious\r\norder of plants (the Orchids). 'Caution in ascribing intentions to\r\nnature,' does not seem to occur to him as possible. Intention is the one\r\nthing which he does see, and which, when he does not see, he seeks for\r\ndiligently until he finds it. He exhausts every form of words and of\r\nillustration, by which intention or mental purpose can be described.\r\n'Contrivance'--'curious contrivance,'--'beautiful contrivance,'--these\r\nare expressions which occur over and over again. Here is one sentence\r\ndescribing the parts of a particular species: 'the Labellum is developed\r\ninto a long nectary, _in order_ to attract Lepidoptera, and we shall\r\npresently give reason for suspecting that the nectar is _purposely_ so\r\nlodged, that it can be sucked only slowly _in order_ to give time for\r\nthe curious chemical quality of the viscid matter setting hard and\r\ndry.'\" Many other examples of similar expressions are quoted by the\r\nDuke, who maintains that no explanation of these \"contrivances\" has\r\nbeen or can be given, except on the supposition of a personal contriver,\r\nspecially arranging the details of each case, although causing them to\r\nbe produced by the ordinary processes of growth and reproduction.\r\n\r\nNow there is a difficulty in this view of the origin of the structure of\r\nOrchids which the Duke does not allude to. The majority of flowering\r\nplants are fertilized, either without the agency of insects or, when\r\ninsects are required, without any very important modification of the\r\nstructure of the flower. It is evident, therefore, that flowers might\r\nhave been formed as varied, fantastic, and beautiful as the Orchids, and\r\nyet have been fertilized without more complexity of structure than is\r\nfound in Violets, or Clover, or Primroses, or a thousand other flowers.\r\nThe strange springs and traps and pitfalls found in the flowers of\r\nOrchids cannot be necessary _per se_, since exactly the same end is\r\ngained in ten thousand other flowers which do not possess them. Is it\r\nnot then an extraordinary idea, to imagine the Creator of the Universe\r\n_contriving_ the various complicated parts of these flowers, as a\r\nmechanic might contrive an ingenious toy or a difficult puzzle? Is it\r\nnot a more worthy conception that they are some of the results of those\r\ngeneral laws which were so co-ordinated at the first introduction of\r\nlife upon the earth as to result necessarily in the utmost possible\r\ndevelopment of varied forms?\r\n\r\nBut let us take one of the simpler cases adduced and see if our general\r\nlaws are unable to account for it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Case of Orchis-structure explained by Natural Selection._\r\n\r\nThere is a Madagascar Orchis--the Angræcum sesquipedale--with an\r\nimmensely long and deep nectary. How did such an extraordinary organ\r\ncome to be developed? Mr. Darwin's explanation is this. The pollen of\r\nthis flower can only be removed by the base of the proboscis of some\r\nvery large moths, when trying to get at the nectar at the bottom of the\r\nvessel. The moths with the longest probosces would do this most\r\neffectually; they would be rewarded for their long tongues by getting\r\nthe most nectar; whilst on the other hand, the flowers with the deepest\r\nnectaries would be the best fertilized by the largest moths preferring\r\nthem. Consequently, the deepest nectaried Orchids and the longest\r\ntongued moths would each confer on the other an advantage in the battle\r\nof life. This would tend to their respective perpetuation, and to the\r\nconstant lengthening of nectaries and probosces. Now let it be\r\nremembered, that what we have to account for, is only the unusual length\r\nof this organ. A nectary is found in many orders of plants and is\r\nespecially common in the Orchids, but in this one case only is it more\r\nthan a foot long. How did this arise? We begin with the fact, proved\r\nexperimentally by Mr. Darwin, that moths do visit Orchids, do thrust\r\ntheir spiral trunks into the nectaries, and do fertilize them by\r\ncarrying the pollinia of one flower to the stigma of another. He has\r\nfurther explained the exact mechanism by which this is effected, and\r\nthe Duke of Argyll admits the accuracy of his observations. In our\r\nBritish species, such as Orchis pyramidalis, it is not necessary that\r\nthere should be any exact adjustment between the length of the nectary\r\nand that of the proboscis of the insect; and thus a number of insects of\r\nvarious sizes are found to carry away the pollinia and aid in the\r\nfertilization. In the Angræcum sesquipedale, however, it is necessary\r\nthat the proboscis should be forced into a particular part of the\r\nflower, and this would only be done by a large moth burying its\r\nproboscis to the very base, and straining to drain the nectar from the\r\nbottom of the long tube, in which it occupies a depth of one or two\r\ninches only. Now let us start from the time when the nectary was only\r\nhalf its present length or about six inches, and was chiefly fertilized\r\nby a species of moth which appeared at the time of the plant's\r\nflowering, and whose proboscis was of the same length. Among the\r\nmillions of flowers of the Angræcum produced every year, some would\r\nalways be shorter than the average, some longer. The former, owing to\r\nthe structure of the flower, would not get fertilized, because the moths\r\ncould get all the nectar without forcing their trunks down to the very\r\nbase. The latter would be well fertilized, and the longest would on the\r\naverage be the best fertilized of all. By this process alone the average\r\nlength of the nectary would annually increase, because, the\r\nshort-nectaried flowers being sterile and the long ones having abundant\r\noffspring, exactly the same effect would be produced as if a gardener\r\ndestroyed the short ones and sowed the seed of the long ones only; and\r\nthis we know by experience would produce a regular increase of length,\r\nsince it is this very process which has increased the size and changed\r\nthe form of our cultivated fruits and flowers.\r\n\r\nBut this would lead in time to such an increased length of the nectary\r\nthat many of the moths could only just reach the surface of the nectar,\r\nand only the few with exceptionally long trunks be able to suck up a\r\nconsiderable portion.\r\n\r\nThis would cause many moths to neglect these flowers because they could\r\nnot get a satisfying supply of nectar, and if these were the only moths\r\nin the country the flowers would undoubtedly suffer, and the further\r\ngrowth of the nectary be checked by exactly the same process which had\r\nled to its increase. But there are an immense variety of moths, of\r\nvarious lengths of proboscis, and as the nectary became longer, other\r\nand larger species would become the fertilizers, and would carry on the\r\nprocess till the largest moths became the sole agents. Now, if not\r\nbefore, the moth would also be affected, for those with the longest\r\nprobosces would get most food, would be the strongest and most vigorous,\r\nwould visit and fertilize the greatest number of flowers, and would\r\nleave the largest number of descendants. The flowers most completely\r\nfertilized by these moths being those which had the longest nectaries,\r\nthere would in each generation be on the average an increase in the\r\nlength of the nectaries, and also an average increase in the length of\r\nthe probosces of the moths; and this would be a _necessary result_ from\r\nthe fact that nature ever fluctuates about a mean, or that in every\r\ngeneration there would be flowers with longer and shorter nectaries, and\r\nmoths with longer and shorter probosces than the average. No doubt there\r\nare a hundred causes that might have checked this process before it had\r\nreached the point of development at which we find it. If, for instance,\r\nthe variation in the quantity of nectar had been at any stage greater\r\nthan the variation in the length of the nectary, then smaller moths\r\ncould have reached it and have effected the fertilization. Or if the\r\ngrowth of the probosces of the moths had from other causes increased\r\nquicker than that of the nectary, or if the increased length of\r\nproboscis had been injurious to them in any way, or if the species of\r\nmoth with the longest proboscis had become much diminished by some enemy\r\nor other unfavourable conditions, then, in any of these cases, the\r\nshorter nectaried flowers, which would have attracted and could have\r\nbeen fertilized by the smaller kinds of moths, would have had the\r\nadvantage. And checks of a similar nature to these no doubt have acted\r\nin other parts of the world, and have prevented such an extraordinary\r\ndevelopment of nectary as has been produced by favourable conditions in\r\nMadagascar only, and in one single species of Orchid. I may here mention\r\nthat some of the large Sphinx moths of the tropics have probosces nearly\r\nas long as the nectary of Angræcum sesquipedale. I have carefully\r\nmeasured the proboscis of a specimen of Macrosila cluentius from South\r\nAmerica, in the collection of the British Museum, and find it to be nine\r\ninches and a quarter long! One from tropical Africa (Macrosila morganii)\r\nis seven inches and a half. A species having a proboscis two or three\r\ninches longer could reach the nectar in the largest flowers of Angræcum\r\nsesquipedale, whose nectaries vary in length from ten to fourteen\r\ninches. That such a moth exists in Madagascar may be safely predicted;\r\nand naturalists who visit that island should search for it with as much\r\nconfidence as Astronomers searched for the planet Neptune,--and I\r\nventure to predict they will be equally successful!\r\n\r\nNow, instead of this beautiful self-acting adjustment, the opposing\r\ntheory is, that the Creator of the Universe, by a direct act of his\r\nWill, so disposed the natural forces influencing the growth of this one\r\nspecies of plant as to cause its nectary to increase to this enormous\r\nlength; and at the same time, by an equally special act, determined the\r\nflow of nourishment in the organization of the moth, so as to cause its\r\nproboscis to increase in exactly the same proportion, having previously\r\nso constructed the Angræcum that it could only be maintained in\r\nexistence by the agency of this moth. But what proof is given or\r\nsuggested that this was the mode by which the adjustment took place?\r\nNone whatever, except a feeling that there is an adjustment of a\r\ndelicate kind, and an inability to see how known causes could have\r\nproduced such an adjustment. I believe I have shown, however, that such\r\nan adjustment is not only possible but inevitable, unless at some point\r\nor other we deny the action of those simple laws which we have already\r\nadmitted to be but the expressions of existing facts.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Adaptation brought about by General Laws._\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to find anything like parallel cases in inorganic\r\nnature, but that of a river may perhaps illustrate the subject in some\r\ndegree. Let us suppose a person totally ignorant of Modern Geology to\r\nstudy carefully a great River System. He finds in its lower part, a deep\r\nbroad channel filled to the brim, flowing slowly through a flat country\r\nand carrying out to the sea a quantity of fine sediment. Higher up it\r\nbranches into a number of smaller channels, flowing alternately through\r\nflat valleys and between high banks; sometimes he finds a deep rocky bed\r\nwith perpendicular walls, carrying the water through a chain of hills;\r\nwhere the stream is narrow he finds it deep, where wide shallow. Further\r\nup still, he comes to a mountainous region, with hundreds of streams and\r\nrivulets, each with its tributary rills and gullies, collecting the\r\nwater from every square mile of surface, and every channel adapted to\r\nthe water that it has to carry. He finds that the bed of every branch,\r\nand stream, and rivulet, has a steeper and steeper slope as it\r\napproaches its sources, and is thus enabled to carry off the water from\r\nheavy rains, and to bear away the stones and pebbles and gravel, that\r\nwould otherwise block up its course. In every part of this system he\r\nwould see exact adaptation of means to an end. He would say, that this\r\nsystem of channels must have been designed, it answers its purpose so\r\neffectually. Nothing but a mind could have so exactly adapted the slopes\r\nof the channels, their capacity, and frequency, to the nature of the\r\nsoil and the quantity of the rainfall. Again, he would see special\r\nadaptation to the wants of man, in broad quiet navigable rivers flowing\r\nthrough fertile plains that support a large population, while the rocky\r\nstreams and mountain torrents, were confined to those sterile regions\r\nsuitable only for a small population of shepherds and herdsmen. He would\r\nlisten with incredulity to the Geologist, who assured him, that the\r\nadaptation and adjustment he so admired was an inevitable result of the\r\naction of general laws. That the rains and rivers, aided by subterranean\r\nforces, had modelled the country, had formed the hills and valleys, had\r\nscooped out the river beds, and levelled the plains;--and it would only\r\nbe after much patient observation and study, after having watched the\r\nminute changes produced year by year, and multiplying them by thousands\r\nand ten thousands, after visiting the various regions of the earth and\r\nseeing the changes everywhere going on, and the unmistakable signs of\r\ngreater changes in past times,--that he could be made to understand that\r\nthe surface of the earth, however beautiful and harmonious it may\r\nappear, is strictly due in every detail to the action of forces which\r\nare demonstrably self-adjusting.\r\n\r\nMoreover, when he had sufficiently extended his inquiries, he would\r\nfind, that every evil effect which he would imagine must be the result\r\nof non-adjustment does somewhere or other occur, only it is not always\r\nevil. Looking on a fertile valley, he would perhaps say--\"If the channel\r\nof this river were not well adjusted, if for a few miles it sloped the\r\nwrong way, the water could not escape, and all this luxuriant valley,\r\nfull of human beings, would become a waste of waters.\" Well, there are\r\nhundreds of such cases. Every lake is a valley \"wasted by water,\" and in\r\nsome cases (as the Dead Sea) it is a positive evil, a blot upon the\r\nharmony and adaptation of the surface of the earth. Again, he might\r\nsay--\"If rain did not fall here, but the clouds passed over us to some\r\nother regions, this verdant and highly cultivated plain would become a\r\ndesert.\" And there are such deserts over a large part of the earth,\r\nwhich abundant rains would convert into pleasant dwelling-places for\r\nman. Or he might observe some great navigable river, and reflect how\r\neasily rocks, or a steeper channel in places, might render it useless to\r\nman;--and a little inquiry would show him hundreds of rivers in every\r\npart of the world, which are thus rendered useless for navigation.\r\n\r\nExactly the same thing occurs in organic nature. We see some one\r\nwonderful case of adjustment, some unusual development of an organ, but\r\nwe pass over the hundreds of cases in which that adjustment and\r\ndevelopment do not occur. No doubt when one adjustment is absent another\r\ntakes its place, because no organism can continue to exist that is not\r\nadjusted to its environment; and unceasing variation with unlimited\r\npowers of multiplication, in most cases, furnish the means of\r\nself-adjustment. The world is so constituted, that by the action of\r\ngeneral laws there is produced the greatest possible variety of surface\r\nand of climate; and by the action of laws equally general, the greatest\r\npossible variety of organisms have been produced, adapted to the varied\r\nconditions of every part of the earth. Tho objector would probably\r\nhimself admit, that the varied surface of the earth--the plains and\r\nvalleys, the hills and mountains, the deserts and volcanoes, the winds\r\nand currents, the seas and lakes and rivers, and the various climates of\r\nthe earth--are all the results of general laws acting and re-acting\r\nduring countless ages; and that the Creator does not appear to guide and\r\ncontrol the action of these laws--here determining the height of a\r\nmountain, there altering the channel of a river--here making the rains\r\nmore abundant, there changing the direction of a current. He would\r\nprobably admit that the forces of inorganic nature are self-adjusting,\r\nand that the result necessarily fluctuates about a given mean condition\r\n(which is itself slowly changing), while within certain limits the\r\ngreatest possible amount of variety is produced. If then a \"contriving\r\nmind\" is not necessary at every step of the process of change eternally\r\ngoing on in the inorganic world, why are we required to believe in the\r\ncontinual action of such a mind in the region of organic nature? True,\r\nthe laws at work are more complex, the adjustments more delicate, the\r\nappearance of special adaptation more remarkable; but why should we\r\nmeasure the creative mind by our own? Why should we suppose the machine\r\ntoo complicated, to have been designed by the Creator so complete that\r\nit would necessarily work out harmonious results? The theory of\r\n\"continual interference\" is a limitation of the Creator's power. It\r\nassumes that he could not work by pure law in the organic, as he has\r\ndone in the inorganic world; it assumes that he could not foresee the\r\nconsequences of the laws of matter and mind combined--that results would\r\ncontinually arise which are contrary to what is best, and that he has to\r\nchange what would otherwise be the course of nature, in order to produce\r\nthat beauty, and variety, and harmony, which even we, with our limited\r\nintellects, can conceive to be the result of self-adjustment in a\r\nuniverse governed by unvarying law. If we could not conceive the world\r\nof nature to be self-adjusting and capable of endless development, it\r\nwould even then be an unworthy idea of a Creator, to impute the\r\nincapacity of our minds to him; but when many human minds can conceive,\r\nand can even trace out in detail some of the adaptations in nature as\r\nthe necessary results of unvarying law, it seems strange that, in the\r\ninterests of religion, any one should seek to prove that the System of\r\nNature, instead of being above, is far below our highest conceptions of\r\nit. I, for one, cannot believe that the world would come to chaos if\r\nleft to Law alone. I cannot believe that there is in it no inherent\r\npower of developing beauty or variety, and that the direct action of the\r\nDeity is required to produce each spot or streak on every insect, each\r\ndetail of structure in every one of the millions of organisms that live\r\nor have lived upon the earth. For it is impossible to draw a line. If\r\nany modifications of structure could be the result of law, why not all?\r\nIf some self-adaptations could arise, why not others? If any varieties\r\nof colour, why not all the varieties we see? No attempt is made to\r\nexplain this, except by reference to the fact that \"purpose\" and\r\n\"contrivance\" are everywhere visible, and by the illogical deduction\r\nthat they could only have arisen from the direct action of some mind,\r\nbecause the direct action of our minds produces similar \"contrivances\";\r\nbut it is forgotten that adaptation, however produced, must have the\r\nappearance of design. The channel of a river looks as if made _for_ the\r\nriver, although it is made _by_ it; the fine layers and beds in a\r\ndeposit of sand, often look as if they had been sorted, and sifted, and\r\nlevelled, designedly; the sides and angles of a crystal exactly resemble\r\nsimilar forms designed by man; but we do not therefore conclude that\r\nthese effects have, in each individual case, required the directing\r\naction of a creative mind, or see any difficulty in their being produced\r\nby natural Law.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Beauty in Nature._\r\n\r\nLet us, however, leave this general argument for a while, and turn to\r\nanother special case, which has been appealed to as conclusive against\r\nMr. Darwin's views. \"Beauty\" is, to some persons, as great a\r\nstumbling-block as \"contrivance.\" They cannot conceive a system of the\r\nUniverse, so perfect, as necessarily to develop every form of Beauty,\r\nbut suppose that when anything specially beautiful occurs, it is a step\r\nbeyond what that system could have produced, something which the Creator\r\nhas added for his own delectation.\r\n\r\nSpeaking of the Humming Birds, the Duke of Argyll says: \"In the first\r\nplace, it is to be observed of the whole group, that there is no\r\nconnection which can be traced or conceived, between the splendour of\r\nthe humming birds and any function essential to their life. If there\r\nwere any such connection, that splendour could not be confined, as it\r\nalmost exclusively is, to only one sex. The female birds are, of course,\r\nnot placed at any disadvantage in the struggle for existence by their\r\nmore sombre colouring.\" And after describing the various ornaments of\r\nthese birds, he says: \"Mere ornament and variety of form, and these for\r\ntheir own sake, is the only principle or rule with reference to which\r\nCreative Power seems to have worked in these wonderful and beautiful\r\nbirds.... A crest of topaz is no better in the struggle for existence\r\nthan a crest of sapphire. A frill ending in spangles of the emerald is\r\nno better in the battle of life than a frill ending in spangles of the\r\nruby. A tail is not affected for the purposes of flight, whether its\r\nmarginal or its central feathers are decorated with white.... Mere\r\nbeauty and mere variety, for their own sake, are objects which we\r\nourselves seek when we can make the Forces of Nature subordinate to the\r\nattainment of them. There seems to be no conceivable reason why we\r\nshould doubt or question, that these are ends and aims also in the forms\r\ngiven to living organisms\" (\"Reign of Law,\" p. 248).\r\n\r\nHere the statement that \"no connection can be conceived between the\r\nsplendour of the humming birds and any function essential to their\r\nlife,\" is met by the fact, that Mr. Darwin has not only conceived but\r\nhas shown, both by observation and reasoning, how beauty of colour and\r\nform may have a direct influence on the most important of all the\r\nfunctions of life, that of reproduction. In the variations to which\r\nbirds are subject, any more brilliant colour than usual would be\r\nattractive to the females, and would lead to the individuals so adorned\r\nleaving more than the average number of offspring. Experiment and\r\nobservation have shown, that this kind of sexual selection does actually\r\ntake place; and the laws of inheritance would necessarily lead to the\r\nfurther development of any individual peculiarity that was attractive,\r\nand thus the splendour of the humming birds is directly connected with\r\ntheir very existence. It is true that \"a crest of topaz may be no better\r\nthan a crest of sapphire,\" but either of these may be much better than\r\nno crest at all; and the different conditions under which the parent\r\nform must have existed in different parts of its range, will have\r\ndetermined different variations of tint, either of which were\r\nadvantageous. The reason why female birds are not adorned with equally\r\nbrilliant plumes is sufficiently clear; they would be injurious, by\r\nrendering their possessors too conspicuous during incubation. Survival\r\nof the fittest, has therefore favoured the development of those dark\r\ngreen tints on the upper surface of so many female humming birds, which\r\nare most conducive to their protection while the important functions of\r\nhatching and rearing the young are being carried on. Keeping in mind the\r\nlaws of multiplication, variation, and survival of the fittest, which\r\nare for ever in action, these varied developments of beauty and\r\nharmonious adjustments to conditions, are not only conceivable but\r\ndemonstrable results.\r\n\r\nThe objection I am now combating is solely founded on the supposed\r\nanalogy of the Creator's mind to ours, as regards the love of Beauty for\r\nits own sake; but if this analogy is to be trusted, then there ought to\r\nbe no natural objects which are disagreeable or ungraceful in our eyes.\r\nAnd yet it is undoubtedly the fact that there are many such. Just as\r\nsurely as the Horse and Deer are beautiful and graceful, the Elephant,\r\nRhinoceros, Hippopotamus, and Camel are the reverse. The majority of\r\nMonkeys and Apes are not beautiful; the majority of Birds have no beauty\r\nof colour; a vast number of Insects and Reptiles are positively ugly.\r\nNow, if the Creator's mind is like ours, whence this ugliness? It is\r\nuseless to say \"that is a mystery we cannot explain,\" because we have\r\nattempted to explain one-half of creation by a method that will not\r\napply to the other half. We know that a man with the highest taste and\r\nwith unlimited wealth, practically does abolish all ungraceful and\r\ndisagreeable forms and colours from his own domains. If the beauty of\r\ncreation is to be explained by the Creator's love of beauty, we are\r\nbound to ask why he has not banished deformity from the earth, as the\r\nwealthy and enlightened man does from his estate and from his dwelling;\r\nand if we can get no satisfactory answer, we shall do well to reject the\r\nexplanation offered. Again, in the case of flowers, which are always\r\nespecially referred to, as the surest evidence of beauty being an end of\r\nitself in creation, the whole of the facts are never fairly met. At\r\nleast half the plants in the world have not bright-coloured or beautiful\r\nflowers; and Mr. Darwin has lately arrived at the wonderful\r\ngeneralization, that flowers have become beautiful solely to attract\r\ninsects to assist in their fertilization. He adds, \"I have come to this\r\nconclusion from finding it an invariable rule, that when a flower is\r\nfertilized by the wind it never has a gaily-coloured corolla.\" Here is a\r\nmost wonderful case of beauty being _useful_, when it might be least\r\nexpected. But much more is proved; for when beauty is of no use to the\r\nplant it is not given. It cannot be imagined to do any harm. It is\r\nsimply not necessary, and is therefore withheld! We ought surely to have\r\nbeen told how this fact is consistent with beauty being \"an end in\r\nitself,\" and with the statement of its being given to natural objects\r\n\"for its own sake.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_How new Forms are produced by Variation and Selection._\r\n\r\nLet us now consider another of the popular objections which the Duke of\r\nArgyll thus sets forth:--\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Darwin does not pretend to have discovered any law or rule,\r\naccording to which new Forms have been born from old Forms. He does not\r\nhold that outward conditions, however changed, are sufficient to account\r\nfor them.... His theory seems to be far better than a mere theory--to be\r\nan established scientific truth--in so far as it accounts, in part at\r\nleast, for the success and establishment and spread of new Forms _when\r\nthey have arisen_. But it does not even suggest the law under which, or\r\nby or according to which, such new Forms are introduced. Natural\r\nSelection can do nothing, except with the materials presented to its\r\nhands. It cannot select except among the things open to selection....\r\nStrictly speaking, therefore, Mr. Darwin's theory is not a theory on the\r\nOrigin of Species at all, but only a theory on the causes which lead to\r\nthe relative success or failure of such new forms as may be born into\r\nthe world.\" (\"Reign of Law,\" p. 230.)\r\n\r\nIn this, and many other passages in his work, the Duke of Argyll sets\r\nforth his idea of Creation as a \"Creation by birth,\" but maintains that\r\neach birth of a new form from parents differing from itself, has been\r\nproduced by a special interference of the Creator, in order to direct\r\nthe process of development into certain channels; that each new species\r\nis in fact a \"special creation,\" although brought into existence through\r\nthe ordinary laws of reproduction. He maintains therefore, that the laws\r\nof multiplication and variation cannot furnish the right kinds of\r\nmaterials at the right times for natural selection to work on. I\r\nbelieve, on the contrary, that it can be logically _proved_ from the six\r\naxiomatic laws before laid down, that such materials would be furnished;\r\nbut I prefer to show there are abundance of _facts_ which demonstrate\r\nthat they are furnished.\r\n\r\nThe experience of all cultivators of plants and breeders of animals\r\nshows, that when a sufficient number of individuals are examined,\r\nvariations of any required kind can always be met with. On this depends\r\nthe possibility of obtaining breeds, races, and fixed varieties of\r\nanimals and plants; and it is found, that any one form of variation may\r\nbe accumulated by selection, without materially affecting the other\r\ncharacters of the species; each _seems_ to vary in the one required\r\ndirection only. For example, in turnips, radishes, potatoes, and\r\ncarrots, the root or tuber varies in size, colour, form, and flavour,\r\nwhile the foliage and flowers seem to remain almost stationary; in the\r\ncabbage and lettuce, on the contrary, the foliage can be modified into\r\nvarious forms and modes of growth, the root, flower, and fruit remaining\r\nlittle altered; in the cauliflower and brocoli the flower heads vary; in\r\nthe garden pea the pod only changes. We get innumerable forms of fruit\r\nin the apple and pear, while the leaves and flowers remain\r\nundistinguishable; the same occurs in the gooseberry and garden currant.\r\nDirectly however, (in the very same genus) we want the flower to vary in\r\nthe Ribes sanguineum, it does so, although mere cultivation for hundreds\r\nof years has not produced marked differences in the flowers of Ribes\r\ngrossularia. When fashion demands any particular change in the form or\r\nsize, or colour of a flower, sufficient variation always occurs in the\r\nright direction, as is shown by our roses, auriculas, and geraniums;\r\nwhen, as recently, ornamental leaves come into fashion sufficient\r\nvariation is found to meet the demand, and we have zoned pelargoniums,\r\nand variegated ivy, and it is discovered that a host of our commonest\r\nshrubs and herbaceous plants have taken to vary in this direction just\r\nwhen we want them to do so! This rapid variation is not confined to old\r\nand well-known plants subjected for a long series of generations to\r\ncultivation, but the Sikim Rhododendrons, the Fuchsias, and Calceolarias\r\nfrom the Andes, and the Pelargoniums from the Cape are equally\r\naccommodating, and vary just when and where and how we require them.\r\n\r\nTurning to animals we find equally striking examples. If we want any\r\nspecial quality in any animal we have only to breed it in sufficient\r\nquantities and watch carefully, and the required variety is _always_\r\nfound, and can be increased to almost any desired extent. In Sheep, we\r\nget flesh, fat, and wool; in Cows, milk; in Horses, colour, strength,\r\nsize, and speed; in Poultry, we have got almost any variety of colour,\r\ncurious modifications of plumage, and the capacity of perpetual\r\negg-laying. In Pigeons we have a still more remarkable proof of the\r\nuniversality of variation, for it has been at one time or another the\r\nfancy of breeders to change the form of every part of these birds, and\r\nthey have never found the required variations absent. The form, size,\r\nand shape of bill and feet, have been changed to such a degree as is\r\nfound only in distinct genera of wild birds; the number of tail feathers\r\nhas been increased, a character which is generally one of the most\r\npermanent nature, and is of high importance in the classification of\r\nbirds; and the size, the colour, and the habits, have been also changed\r\nto a marvellous extent. In Dogs, the degree of modification and the\r\nfacility with which it is effected, is almost equally apparent. Look at\r\nthe constant amount of variation in opposite directions that must have\r\nbeen going on, to develop the poodle and the greyhound from the same\r\noriginal stock! Instincts, habits, intelligence, size, speed, form, and\r\ncolour, have always varied, so as to produce the very races which the\r\nwants or fancies or passions of men may have led them to desire. Whether\r\nthey wanted a bull-dog to torture another animal, a greyhound to catch\r\na hare, or a bloodhound to hunt down their oppressed fellow-creatures,\r\nthe required variations have always appeared.\r\n\r\nNow this great mass of facts, of which a mere sketch has been here\r\ngiven, are fully accounted for by the \"Law of Variation\" as laid down at\r\nthe commencement of this paper. Universal variability--small in amount\r\nbut in every direction, ever fluctuating about a mean condition until\r\nmade to advance in a given direction by \"election,\" natural or\r\nartificial,--is the simple basis for the indefinite modification of the\r\nforms of life;--partial, unbalanced, and consequently unstable\r\nmodifications being produced by man, while those developed under the\r\nunrestrained action of natural laws, are at every step self-adjusted to\r\nexternal conditions by the dying out of all unadjusted forms, and are\r\ntherefore stable and comparatively permanent. To be consistent in their\r\nviews, our opponents must maintain that every one of the variations that\r\nhave rendered possible the changes produced by man, have been determined\r\nat the right time and place by the will of the Creator. Every race\r\nproduced by the florist or the breeder, the dog or the pigeon fancier,\r\nthe ratcatcher, the sporting man, or the slave-hunter, must have been\r\nprovided for by varieties occurring when wanted; and as these variations\r\nwere never withheld, it would prove, that the sanction of an all-wise\r\nand all-powerful Being, has been given to that which the highest human\r\nminds consider to be trivial, mean, or debasing.\r\n\r\nThis appears to be a complete answer to the theory, that variation\r\nsufficient in amount to be accumulated in a given direction must be the\r\ndirect act of the Creative Mind, but it is also sufficiently condemned\r\nby being so entirely unnecessary. The facility with which man obtains\r\nnew races, depends chiefly upon the number of individuals he can procure\r\nto select from. When hundreds of florists or breeders are all aiming at\r\nthe same object, the work of change goes on rapidly. But a common\r\nspecies in nature contains a thousand-or a million-fold more individuals\r\nthan any domestic race; and survival of the fittest must unerringly\r\npreserve all that vary in the right direction, not only in obvious\r\ncharacters but in minute details, not only in external but in internal\r\norgans; so that if the materials are sufficient for the needs of man,\r\nthere can be no want of them to fulfil the grand purpose of keeping up a\r\nsupply of modified organisms, exactly adapted to the changed conditions\r\nthat are always occurring in the inorganic world.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Objection that there are Limits to Variation._\r\n\r\nHaving now, I believe, fairly answered the chief objections of the Duke\r\nof Argyll, I proceed to notice one or two of those adduced in an able\r\nand argumentative essay on the \"Origin of Species\" in the _North British\r\nReview_ for July, 1867. The writer first attempts to prove that there\r\nare strict limits to variation. When we begin to select variations in\r\nany one direction, the process is comparatively rapid, but after a\r\nconsiderable amount of change has been effected it becomes slower and\r\nslower, till at length its limits are reached and no care in breeding\r\nand selection can produce any further advance. The race-horse is chosen\r\nas an example. It is admitted that, with any ordinary lot of horses to\r\nbegin with, careful selection would in a few years make a great\r\nimprovement, and in a comparatively short time the standard of our best\r\nracers might be reached. But that standard has not for many years been\r\nmaterially raised, although unlimited wealth and energy are expended in\r\nthe attempt. This is held to prove that there are definite limits to\r\nvariation in any special direction, and that we have no reason to\r\nsuppose that mere time, and the selective process being carried on by\r\nnatural law, could make any material difference. But the writer does not\r\nperceive that this argument fails to meet the real question, which is,\r\nnot whether indefinite and unlimited change in any or all directions is\r\npossible, but whether such differences as do occur in nature could have\r\nbeen produced by the accumulation of variations by selection. In the\r\nmatter of speed, a limit of a definite kind as regards land animals does\r\nexist in nature. All the swiftest animals--deer, antelopes, hares,\r\nfoxes, lions, leopards, horses, zebras, and many others, have reached\r\nvery nearly the same degree of speed. Although the swiftest of each must\r\nhave been for ages preserved, and the slowest must have perished, we\r\nhave no reason to believe there is any advance of speed. The possible\r\nlimit under existing conditions, and perhaps under possible terrestrial\r\nconditions, has been long ago reached. In cases, however, where this\r\nlimit had not been so nearly reached as in the horse, we have been\r\nenabled to make a more marked advance and to produce a greater\r\ndifference of form. The wild dog is an animal that hunts much in\r\ncompany, and trusts more to endurance than to speed. Man has produced\r\nthe greyhound, which differs much more from the wolf or the dingo than\r\nthe racer does from the wild Arabian. Domestic dogs, again, have varied\r\nmore in size and in form than the whole family of Canidæ in a state of\r\nnature. No wild dog, fox, or wolf, is either so small as some of the\r\nsmallest terriers and spaniels, or so large as the largest varieties of\r\nhound or Newfoundland dog. And, certainly, no two wild animals of the\r\nfamily differ so widely in form and proportions as the Chinese pug and\r\nthe Italian greyhound, or the bulldog and the common greyhound. The\r\nknown range of variation is, therefore, more than enough for the\r\nderivation of all the forms of Dogs, Wolves, and Foxes from a common\r\nancestor.\r\n\r\nAgain, it is objected that the Pouter or the Fan-tail pigeon cannot be\r\nfurther developed in the same direction. Variation seems to have reached\r\nits limits in these birds. But so it has in nature. The Fan-tail has not\r\nonly more tail feathers than any of the three hundred and forty existing\r\nspecies of pigeons, but more than any of the eight thousand known\r\nspecies of birds. There is, of course, some limit to the number of\r\nfeathers of which a tail useful for flight can consist, and in the\r\nFan-tail we have probably reached that limit. Many birds have the\r\noesophagus or the skin of the neck more or less dilatable, but in no\r\nknown bird is it so dilatable as in the Pouter pigeon. Here again the\r\npossible limit, compatible with a healthy existence, has probably been\r\nreached. In like manner the differences in the size and form of the beak\r\nin the various breeds of the domestic Pigeon, is greater than that\r\nbetween the extreme forms of beak in the various genera and sub-families\r\nof the whole Pigeon tribe. From these facts, and many others of the same\r\nnature, we may fairly infer, that if rigid selection were applied to any\r\norgan, we could in a comparatively short time produce a much greater\r\namount of change than that which occurs between species and species in a\r\nstate of nature, since the differences which we do produce are often\r\ncomparable with those which exist between distinct genera or distinct\r\nfamilies. The facts adduced by the writer of the article referred to, of\r\nthe definite limits to variability in certain directions in domesticated\r\nanimals, are, therefore, no objection whatever to the view, that all the\r\nmodifications which exist in nature have been produced by the\r\naccumulation, by natural selection, of small and useful variations,\r\nsince those very modifications have equally definite and very similar\r\nlimits.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Objection to the Argument from Classification._\r\n\r\nTo another of this writer's objections--that by Professor Thomson's\r\ncalculations the sun can only have existed in a solid state 500,000,000\r\nof years, and that therefore _time_ would not suffice for the slow\r\nprocess of development of all living organisms--it is hardly necessary\r\nto reply, as it cannot be seriously contended, even if this calculation\r\nhas claims to approximate accuracy, that the process of change and\r\ndevelopment may not have been sufficiently rapid to have occurred within\r\nthat period. His objection to the Classification argument is, however,\r\nmore plausible. The uncertainty of opinion among Naturalists as to which\r\nare species and which varieties, is one of Mr. Darwin's very strong\r\narguments that these two names cannot belong to things quite distinct in\r\nnature and origin. The Reviewer says that this argument is of no weight,\r\nbecause the works of man present exactly the same phenomena; and he\r\ninstances patent inventions, and the excessive difficulty of determining\r\nwhether they are new or old. I accept the analogy though it is a very\r\nimperfect one, and maintain that such as it is, it is all in favour of\r\nMr. Darwin's views. For are not all inventions of the same kind directly\r\naffiliated to a common ancestor? Are not improved Steam Engines or\r\nClocks the lineal descendants of some existing Steam Engine or Clock? Is\r\nthere ever a new Creation in Art or Science any more than in Nature? Did\r\never patentee absolutely originate any complete and entire invention, no\r\nportion of which was derived from anything that had been made or\r\ndescribed before? It is therefore clear that the difficulty of\r\ndistinguishing the various classes of inventions which claim to be new,\r\nis of the same nature as the difficulty of distinguishing varieties and\r\nspecies, because neither are absolute new creations, but both are alike\r\ndescendants of pre-existing forms, from which and from each other they\r\ndiffer by varying and often imperceptible degrees. It appears, then,\r\nthat however plausible this writer's objections may seem, whenever he\r\ndescends from generalities to any specific statement, his supposed\r\ndifficulties turn out to be in reality strongly confirmatory of Mr.\r\nDarwin's view.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The \"Times,\" on Natural Selection._\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary misconception of the whole subject by popular writers\r\nand reviewers, is well shown by an article which appeared in the _Times_\r\nnewspaper on \"The Reign of Law.\" Alluding to the supposed economy of\r\nnature, in the adaptation of each species to its own place and its\r\nspecial use, the reviewer remarks: \"To this universal law of the\r\ngreatest economy, the law of natural selection stands in direct\r\nantagonism as the law of 'greatest possible waste' of time and of\r\ncreative power. To conceive a duck with webbed feet and a spoon-shaped\r\nbill, living by suction, to pass naturally into a gull with webbed feet\r\nand a knife-like bill, living on flesh, in the longest possible time and\r\nin the most laborious possible way, we may conceive it to pass from the\r\none to the other state by natural selection. The battle of life the\r\nducks will have to fight will increase in peril continually as they\r\ncease (with the change of their bill) to be ducks, and attain a\r\n_maximum_ of danger in the condition in which they begin to be gulls;\r\nand ages must elapse and whole generations must perish, and countless\r\ngenerations of the one species be created and sacrificed, to arrive at\r\none single pair of the other.\"\r\n\r\nIn this passage the theory of natural selection is so absurdly\r\nmisrepresented that it would be amusing, did we not consider the\r\nmisleading effect likely to be produced by this kind of teaching in so\r\npopular a journal. It is assumed that the duck and the gull are\r\nessential parts of nature, each well fitted for its place, and that if\r\none had been produced from the other by a gradual metamorphosis, the\r\nintermediate forms would have been useless, unmeaning, and unfitted for\r\nany place, in the system of the universe. Now, this idea can only exist\r\nin a mind ignorant of the very foundation and essence of the theory of\r\nnatural selection, which is, the preservation of _useful_ variations\r\nonly, or, as has been well expressed, in other words, the \"survival of\r\nthe fittest.\" Every intermediate form which could possibly have arisen\r\nduring the transition from the duck to the gull, so far from having an\r\nunusually severe battle to fight for existence, or incurring any\r\n\"_maximum_ of danger,\" would necessarily have been as accurately\r\nadjusted to the rest of nature, and as well fitted to maintain and to\r\nenjoy its existence, as the duck or the gull actually are. If it were\r\nnot so, it never could have been produced under the law of natural\r\nselection.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Intermediate or generalized Forms of extinct Animals, an indication of\r\nTransmutation or Development._\r\n\r\nThe misconception of this writer illustrates another point very\r\nfrequently overlooked. It is an essential part of Mr. Darwin's theory,\r\nthat one existing animal has not been derived from any other existing\r\nanimal, but that both are the descendants of a common ancestor, which\r\nwas at once different from either, but, in essential characters,\r\nintermediate between them both. The illustration of the duck and the\r\ngull is therefore misleading; one of these birds has not been derived\r\nfrom the other, but both from a common ancestor. This is not a mere\r\nsupposition invented to support the theory of natural selection, but is\r\nfounded on a variety of indisputable facts. As we go back into past\r\ntime, and meet with the fossil remains of more and more ancient races of\r\nextinct animals, we find that many of them actually are intermediate\r\nbetween distinct groups of existing animals. Professor Owen continually\r\ndwells on this fact: he says in his \"Palæontology,\" p. 284: \"A more\r\ngeneralized vertebrate structure is illustrated, in the extinct\r\nreptiles, by the affinities to ganoid fishes, shown by Ganocephala,\r\nLabyrinthodontia, and Icthyopterygia; by the affinities of the\r\nPterosauria to Birds, and by the approximation of the Dinosauria to\r\nMammals. (These have been recently shown by Professor Huxley to have\r\nmore affinity to Birds.) It is manifested by the combination of modern\r\ncrocodilian, chelonian, and lacertian characters in the Cryptodontia\r\nand the Dicnyodontia, and by the combined lacertian and crocodilian\r\ncharacters in the Thecodontia and Sauropterygia.\" In the same work he\r\ntells us that, \"the Anoplotherium, in several important characters\r\nresembled the embryo Ruminant, but retained throughout life those marks\r\nof adhesion to a generalized mammalian type;\"--and assures us that he\r\nhas \"never omitted a proper opportunity for impressing the results of\r\nobservations showing the more generalized structures of extinct as\r\ncompared with the more specialized forms of recent animals.\" Modern\r\npalæontologists have discovered hundreds of examples of these more\r\ngeneralized or ancestral types. In the time of Cuvier, the Ruminants and\r\nthe Pachyderms were looked upon as two of the most distinct orders of\r\nanimals; but it is now demonstrated that there once existed a variety of\r\ngenera and species, connecting by almost imperceptible grades such\r\nwidely different animals as the pig and the camel. Among living\r\nquadrupeds we can scarcely find a more isolated group than the genus\r\nEquus, comprising the horses, asses, and Zebras; but through many\r\nspecies of Paloplotherium, Hippotherium, and Hipparion, and numbers of\r\nextinct forms of Equus found in Europe, India, and America, an almost\r\ncomplete transition is established with the Eocene Anoplothorium and\r\nPaleotherium, which are also generalized or ancestral types of the Tapir\r\nand Rhinoceros. The recent researches of M. Gaudry in Greece have\r\nfurnished much new evidence of the same character. In the Miocene beds\r\nof Pikermi he has discovered the group of the Simocyonidæ intermediate\r\nbetween bears and wolves; the genus Hyænictis which connects the hyænas\r\nwith the civets; the Ancylotherium, which is allied both to the extinct\r\nmastodon and to the living pangolin or scaly ant-eater; and the\r\nHelladotherium, which connects the now isolated giraffe with the deer\r\nand antelopes.\r\n\r\nBetween reptiles and fishes an intermediate type has been found in the\r\nArchegosaurus of the Coal formation; while the Labyrinthodon of the\r\nTrias combined characters of the Batrachia with those of crocodiles,\r\nlizards, and ganoid fishes. Even birds, the most apparently isolated of\r\nall living forms, and the most rarely preserved in a fossil state, have\r\nbeen shown to possess undoubted affinities with reptiles; and in the\r\nOolitic Archæopteryx, with its lengthened tail, feathered on each side,\r\nwe have one of the connecting links from the side of birds; while\r\nProfessor Huxley has recently shown that the entire order of\r\nDinosaurians have remarkable affinities to birds, and that one of them,\r\nthe Compsognathus, makes a nearer approach to bird organisation than\r\ndoes Archæopteryx to that of reptiles.\r\n\r\nAnalogous facts to those occur in other classes of animals, as\r\nan example of which we have the authority of a distinguished\r\npaleontologist, M. Barande, quoted by Mr. Darwin, for the statement,\r\nthat although the Palæozoic Invertebrata can certainly be classed under\r\nexisting groups, yet at this ancient period the groups were not so\r\ndistinctly separated from each other as they are now; while Mr. Scudder\r\ntells us, that some of the fossil insects discovered in the Coal\r\nformation of America offer characters intermediate between those of\r\nexisting orders. Agassiz, again, insists strongly that the more ancient\r\nanimals resemble the embryonic forms of existing species; but as the\r\nembryos of distinct groups are known to resemble each other more than\r\nthe adult animals (and in fact to be undistinguishable at a very early\r\nage), this is the same as saying that the ancient animals are exactly\r\nwhat, on Darwin's theory, the ancestors of existing animals ought to be;\r\nand this, it must be remembered, is the evidence of one of the strongest\r\nopponents of the theory of natural selection.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Conclusion._\r\n\r\nI have thus endeavoured to meet fairly, and to answer plainly, a few of\r\nthe most common objections to the theory of natural selection, and I\r\nhave done so in every case by referring to admitted facts and to logical\r\ndeductions from those facts.\r\n\r\nAs an indication and general summary of the line of argument I have\r\nadopted, I here give a brief demonstration in a tabular form of the\r\nOrigin of Species by means of Natural Selection, referring for the\r\n_facts_ to Mr. Darwin's works, and to the pages in this volume, where\r\nthey are more or less fully treated.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Demonstration of the Origin of Species by Natural Selection_.\r\n\r\n   ___________________________________________________________________\r\n  |                                 |                                 |\r\n  |_PROVED FACTS_.                  |_NECESSARY CONSEQUENCES_         |\r\n  |                                 |(_afterwards taken as Proved     |\r\n  |                                 |Facts_).                         |\r\n  |_________________________________|_________________________________|\r\n  |                                 |                                 |\r\n  |RAPID INCREASE OF ORGANISMS,     |                                 |\r\n  |pp. 29, 265; (\"Origin            |STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE,          |\r\n  |of Species,\" p. 75, 5th Ed.)     |the deaths equalling the         |\r\n  |                                 |births on the average, p. 30;    |\r\n  |TOTAL NUMBER OF INDIVIDUALS      |(\"Origin of Species,\" chap.      |\r\n  |STATIONARY, pp. 30,              |III.)                            |\r\n  |266.                             |                                 |\r\n  |_________________________________|_________________________________|\r\n  |                                 |                                 |\r\n  |STRUGGLE FOR EXISTENCE.          |SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST,         |\r\n  |                                 |or Natural Selection; meaning    |\r\n  |HEREDITY WITH VARIATION,         |simply, that on the              |\r\n  |or general likeness with         |whole those die who are          |\r\n  |individual differences of parents|least fitted to maintain their   |\r\n  |and offspring, pp.               |existence; (\"Origin of Species,\" |\r\n  |266, 287-291, 308; (\"Origin      |chap.

Anthropologists are now, indeed, pretty well agreed that man is\r\nnot a recent introduction into the earth. All who have studied the\r\nquestion, now admit that his antiquity is very great; and that, though\r\nwe have to some extent ascertained the minimum of time during which he\r\n_must_ have existed, we have made no approximation towards determining\r\nthat far greater period during which he _may_ have, and probably _has_\r\nexisted. We can with tolerable certainty affirm that man must have\r\ninhabited the earth a thousand centuries ago, but we cannot assert that\r\nhe positively did not exist, or that there is any good evidence against\r\nhis having existed, for a period of ten thousand centuries. We know\r\npositively, that he was contemporaneous with many now extinct animals,\r\nand has survived changes of the earth's surface fifty or a hundred times\r\ngreater than any that have occurred during the historical period; but we\r\ncannot place any definite limit to the number of species he may have\r\noutlived, or to the amount of terrestrial change he may have witnessed.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wide differences of opinion as to Man's Origin._\r\n\r\nBut while on this question of man's antiquity there is a very general\r\nagreement,--and all are waiting eagerly for fresh evidence to clear up\r\nthose points which all admit to be full of doubt,--on other, and not\r\nless obscure and difficult questions, a considerable amount of dogmatism\r\nis exhibited; doctrines are put forward as established truths, no doubt\r\nor hesitation is admitted, and it seems to be supposed that no further\r\nevidence is required, or that any new facts can modify our convictions.\r\nThis is especially the case when we inquire,--Are the various forms\r\nunder which man now exists primitive, or derived from pre-existing\r\nforms; in other words, is man of one or many species? To this question\r\nwe immediately obtain distinct answers diametrically opposed to each\r\nother: the one party positively maintaining, that man is a _species_ and\r\nis essentially _one_--that all differences are but local and temporary\r\nvariations, produced by the different physical and moral conditions by\r\nwhich he is surrounded; the other party maintaining with equal\r\nconfidence, that man is a genus of _many species_, each of which is\r\npractically unchangeable, and has ever been as distinct, or even more\r\ndistinct, than we now behold them. This difference of opinion is\r\nsomewhat remarkable, when we consider that both parties are well\r\nacquainted with the subject; both use the same vast accumulation of\r\nfacts; both reject those early traditions of mankind which profess to\r\ngive an account of his origin; and both declare that they are seeking\r\nfearlessly after truth alone; yet each will persist in looking only at\r\nthe portion of truth on his own side of the question, and at the error\r\nwhich is mingled with his opponent's doctrine. It is my wish to show how\r\nthe two opposing views can be combined, so as to eliminate the error and\r\nretain the truth in each, and it is by means of Mr. Darwin's celebrated\r\ntheory of \"Natural Selection\" that I hope to do this, and thus to\r\nharmonise the conflicting theories of modern anthropologists.\r\n\r\nLet us first see what each party has to say for itself. In favour of the\r\nunity of mankind it is argued, that there are no races without\r\ntransitions to others; that every race exhibits within itself variations\r\nof colour, of hair, of feature, and of form, to such a degree as to\r\nbridge over, to a large extent, the gap that separates it from other\r\nraces. It is asserted that no race is homogeneous; that there is a\r\ntendency to vary; that climate, food, and habits produce, and render\r\npermanent, physical peculiarities, which, though slight in the limited\r\nperiods allowed to our observation, would, in the long ages during which\r\nthe human race has existed, have sufficed to produce all the differences\r\nthat now appear. It is further asserted that the advocates of the\r\nopposite theory do not agree among themselves; that some would make\r\nthree, some five, some fifty or a hundred and fifty species of man; some\r\nwould have had each species created in pairs, while others require\r\nnations to have at once sprung into existence, and that there is no\r\nstability or consistency in any doctrine but that of one primitive\r\nstock.\r\n\r\nThe advocates of the original diversity of man, on the other hand, have\r\nmuch to say for themselves. They argue that proofs of change in man have\r\nnever been brought forward except to the most trifling amount, while\r\nevidence of his permanence meets us everywhere. The Portuguese and\r\nSpaniards, settled for two or three centuries in South America, retain\r\ntheir chief physical, mental, and moral characteristics; the Dutch boers\r\nat the Cape, and the descendants of the early Dutch settlers in the\r\nMoluccas, have not lost the features or the colour of the Germanic\r\nraces; the Jews, scattered over the world in the most diverse climates,\r\nretain the same characteristic lineaments everywhere; the Egyptian\r\nsculptures and paintings show us that, for at least 4000 or 5000 years,\r\nthe strongly contrasted features of the Negro and the Semitic races have\r\nremained altogether unchanged; while more recent discoveries prove, that\r\nthe mound-builders of the Mississippi valley, and the dwellers on\r\nBrazilian mountains, had, even in the very infancy of the human race,\r\nsome traces of the same peculiar and characteristic type of cranial\r\nformation that now distinguishes them.\r\n\r\nIf we endeavour to decide impartially on the merits of this difficult\r\ncontroversy, judging solely by the evidence that each party has brought\r\nforward, it certainly seems that the best of the argument is on the\r\nside of those who maintain the primitive diversity of man. Their\r\nopponents have not been able to refute the permanence of existing races\r\nas far back as we can trace them, and have failed to show, in a single\r\ncase, that at any former epoch the well marked varieties of mankind\r\napproximated more closely than they do at the present day. At the same\r\ntime this is but negative evidence. A condition of immobility for four\r\nor five thousand years, does not preclude an advance at an earlier\r\nepoch, and--if we can show that there are causes in nature which would\r\ncheck any further physical change when certain conditions were\r\nfulfilled--does not even render such an advance improbable, if there are\r\nany general arguments to be adduced in its favour. Such a cause, I\r\nbelieve, does exist; and I shall now endeavour to point out its nature\r\nand its mode of operation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Outline of the Theory of Natural Selection._\r\n\r\nIn order to make my argument intelligible, it is necessary for me to\r\nexplain very briefly the theory of \"Natural Selection\" promulgated by\r\nMr. Darwin, and the power which it possesses of modifying the forms of\r\nanimals and plants. The grand feature in the multiplication of organic\r\nlife is, that close general resemblance is combined with more or less\r\nindividual variation. The child resembles its parents or ancestors more\r\nor less closely in all its peculiarities, deformities, or beauties; it\r\nresembles them in general more than it does any other individuals; yet\r\nchildren of the same parents are not all alike, and it often happens\r\nthat they differ very considerably from their parents and from each\r\nother. This is equally true, of man, of all animals, and of all plants.\r\nMoreover, it is found that individuals do not differ from their parents\r\nin certain particulars only, while in all others they are exact\r\nduplicates of them. They differ from them and from each other, in every\r\nparticular: in form, in size, in colour; in the structure of internal as\r\nwell as of external organs; in those subtle peculiarities which produce\r\ndifferences of constitution, as well as in those still more subtle ones\r\nwhich lead to modifications of mind and character. In other words, in\r\nevery possible way, in every organ and in every function, individuals of\r\nthe same stock vary.\r\n\r\nNow, health, strength, and long life, are the results of a harmony\r\nbetween the individual and the universe that surrounds it. Let us\r\nsuppose that at any given moment this harmony is perfect. A certain\r\nanimal is exactly fitted to secure its prey, to escape from its enemies,\r\nto resist the inclemencies of the seasons, and to rear a numerous and\r\nhealthy offspring. But a change now takes place. A series of cold\r\nwinters, for instance, come on, making food scarce, and bringing an\r\nimmigration of some other animals to compete with the former inhabitants\r\nof the district. The new immigrant is swift of foot, and surpasses its\r\nrivals in the pursuit of game; the winter nights are colder, and require\r\na thicker fur as a protection, and more nourishing food to keep up the\r\nheat of the system. Our supposed perfect animal is no longer in harmony\r\nwith its universe; it is in danger of dying of cold or of starvation.\r\nBut the animal varies in its offspring. Some of these are swifter than\r\nothers--they still manage to catch food enough; some are hardier and\r\nmore thickly furred--they manage in the cold nights to keep warm enough;\r\nthe slow, the weak, and the thinly clad soon die off. Again and again,\r\nin each succeeding generation, the same thing takes place. By this\r\nnatural process, which is so inevitable that it cannot be conceived not\r\nto act, those best adapted to live, live; those least adapted, die. It\r\nis sometimes said that we have no direct evidence of the action of this\r\nselecting power in nature. But it seems to me we have better evidence\r\nthan even direct observation would be, because it is more universal,\r\nviz., the evidence of necessity. It must be so; for, as all wild animals\r\nincrease in a geometrical ratio, while their actual numbers remain on\r\nthe average stationary, it follows, that as many die annually as are\r\nborn. If, therefore, we deny natural selection, it can only be by\r\nasserting that, in such a case as I have supposed, the strong, the\r\nhealthy, the swift, the well clad, the well organised animals in every\r\nrespect, have no advantage over,--do not on the average live longer\r\nthan, the weak, the unhealthy, the slow, the ill-clad, and the\r\nimperfectly organised individuals; and this no sane man has yet been\r\nfound hardy enough to assert. But this is not all; for the offspring on\r\nthe average resemble their parents, and the selected portion of each\r\nsucceeding generation will therefore be stronger, swifter, and more\r\nthickly furred than the last; and if this process goes on for thousands\r\nof generations, our animal will have again become thoroughly in harmony\r\nwith the new conditions in which it is placed. But it will now be a\r\ndifferent creature. It will be not only swifter and stronger, and more\r\nfurry, it will also probably have changed in colour, in form, perhaps\r\nhave acquired a longer tail, or differently shaped ears; for it is an\r\nascertained fact, that when one part of an animal is modified, some\r\nother parts almost always change, as it were in sympathy with it. Mr.\r\nDarwin calls this \"correlation of growth,\" and gives as instances, that\r\nhairless dogs have imperfect teeth; white cats, when blue-eyed, are\r\ndeaf; small feet accompany short beaks in pigeons; and other equally\r\ninteresting cases.\r\n\r\nGrant, therefore, the premises: 1st. That peculiarities of every kind\r\nare more or less hereditary. 2nd. That the offspring of every animal\r\nvary more or less in all parts of their organization. 3rd. That\r\nthe universe in which these animals live, is not absolutely\r\ninvariable;--none of which propositions can be denied; and then\r\nconsider, that the animals in any country (those at least which are not\r\ndying out) must at each successive period be brought into harmony with\r\nthe surrounding conditions; and we have all the elements for a change of\r\nform and structure in the animals, keeping exact pace with changes of\r\nwhatever nature in the surrounding universe. Such changes must be slow,\r\nfor the changes in the universe are very slow; but just as these slow\r\nchanges become important, when we look at results after long periods of\r\naction, as we do when we perceive the alterations of the earth's surface\r\nduring geological epochs; so the parallel changes in animal form become\r\nmore and more striking, in proportion as the time they have been going\r\non is great; as we see when we compare our living animals with those\r\nwhich we disentomb from each successively older geological formation.\r\n\r\nThis is, briefly, the theory of \"natural selection,\" which explains the\r\nchanges in the organic world as being parallel with, and in part\r\ndependent on, those in the inorganic. What we now have to inquire\r\nis,--Can this theory be applied in any way to the question of the origin\r\nof the races of man? or is there anything in human nature that takes him\r\nout of the category of those organic existences, over whose successive\r\nmutations it has had such powerful sway?\r\n\r\n\r\n_Different effects of Natural Selection on Animals and on Man._\r\n\r\nIn order to answer these questions, we must consider why it is that\r\n\"natural selection\" acts so powerfully upon animals; and we shall, I\r\nbelieve, find, that its effect depends mainly upon their self-dependence\r\nand individual isolation. A slight injury, a temporary illness, will\r\noften end in death, because it leaves the individual powerless against\r\nits enemies. If an herbivorous animal is a little sick and has not fed\r\nwell for a day or two, and the herd is then pursued by a beast of prey,\r\nour poor invalid inevitably falls a victim. So, in a carnivorous animal,\r\nthe least deficiency of vigour prevents its capturing food, and it soon\r\ndies of starvation. There is, as a general rule, no mutual assistance\r\nbetween adults, which enables them to tide over a period of sickness.\r\nNeither is there any division of labour; each must fulfil _all_ the\r\nconditions of its existence, and, therefore, \"natural selection\" keeps\r\nall up to a pretty uniform standard.\r\n\r\nBut in man, as we now behold him, this is different. He is social and\r\nsympathetic. In the rudest tribes the sick are assisted, at least with\r\nfood; less robust health and vigour than the average does not entail\r\ndeath. Neither does the want of perfect limbs, or other organs, produce\r\nthe same effects as among animals. Some division of labour takes place;\r\nthe swiftest hunt, the less active fish, or gather fruits; food is, to\r\nsome extent, exchanged or divided. The action of natural selection is\r\ntherefore checked; the weaker, the dwarfish, those of less active limbs,\r\nor less piercing eyesight, do not suffer the extreme penalty which falls\r\nupon animals so defective.\r\n\r\nIn proportion as these physical characteristics become of less\r\nimportance, mental and moral qualities will have increasing influence on\r\nthe well-being of the race. Capacity for acting in concert for\r\nprotection, and for the acquisition of food and shelter; sympathy, which\r\nleads all in turn to assist each other; the sense of right, which checks\r\ndepredations upon our fellows; the smaller development of the combative\r\nand destructive propensities; self-restraint in present appetites; and\r\nthat intelligent foresight which prepares for the future, are all\r\nqualities, that from their earliest appearance must have been for the\r\nbenefit of each community, and would, therefore, have become the\r\nsubjects of \"natural selection.\" For it is evident that such qualities\r\nwould be for the well-being of man; would guard him against external\r\nenemies, against internal dissensions, and against the effects of\r\ninclement seasons and impending famine, more surely than could any\r\nmerely physical modification. Tribes in which such mental and moral\r\nqualities were predominant, would therefore have an advantage in the\r\nstruggle for existence over other tribes in which they were less\r\ndeveloped, would live and maintain their numbers, while the others would\r\ndecrease and finally succumb.\r\n\r\nAgain, when any slow changes of physical geography, or of climate, make\r\nit necessary for an animal to alter its food, its clothing, or its\r\nweapons, it can only do so by the occurrence of a corresponding change\r\nin its own bodily structure and internal organization. If a larger or\r\nmore powerful beast is to be captured and devoured, as when a\r\ncarnivorous animal which has hitherto preyed on antelopes is obliged\r\nfrom their decreasing numbers to attack buffaloes, it is only the\r\nstrongest who can hold,--those with most powerful claws, and formidable\r\ncanine teeth, that can struggle with and overcome such an animal.\r\nNatural selection immediately comes into play, and by its action these\r\norgans gradually become adapted to their new requirements. But man,\r\nunder similar circumstances, does not require longer nails or teeth,\r\ngreater bodily strength or swiftness. He makes sharper spears, or a\r\nbetter bow, or he constructs a cunning pitfall, or combines in a hunting\r\nparty to circumvent his new prey. The capacities which enable him to do\r\nthis are what he requires to be strengthened, and these will, therefore,\r\nbe gradually modified by \"natural selection,\" while the form and\r\nstructure of his body will remain unchanged. So, when a glacial epoch\r\ncomes on, some animals must acquire warmer fur, or a covering of fat, or\r\nelse die of cold. Those best clothed by nature are, therefore, preserved\r\nby natural selection. Man, under the same circumstances, will make\r\nhimself warmer clothing, and build better houses; and the necessity of\r\ndoing this will react upon his mental organization and social\r\ncondition--will advance them while his natural body remains naked as\r\nbefore.\r\n\r\nWhen the accustomed food of some animal becomes scarce or totally fails,\r\nit can only exist by becoming adapted to a new kind of food, a food\r\nperhaps less nourishing and less digestible. \"Natural selection\" will\r\nnow act upon the stomach and intestines, and all their individual\r\nvariations will be taken advantage of, to modify the race into harmony\r\nwith its new food. In many cases, however, it is probable that this\r\ncannot be done. The internal organs may not vary quick enough, and then\r\nthe animal will decrease in numbers, and finally become extinct. But\r\nman guards himself from such accidents by superintending and guiding the\r\noperations of nature. He plants the seed of his most agreeable food, and\r\nthus procures a supply, independent of the accidents of varying seasons\r\nor natural extinction. He domesticates animals, which serve him either\r\nto capture food or for food itself, and thus, changes of any great\r\nextent in his teeth or digestive organs are rendered unnecessary. Man,\r\ntoo, has everywhere the use of fire, and by its means can render\r\npalatable a variety of animal and vegetable substances, which he could\r\nhardly otherwise make use of; and thus obtains for himself a supply of\r\nfood far more varied and abundant than that which any animal can\r\ncommand.\r\n\r\nThus man, by the mere capacity of clothing himself, and making weapons\r\nand tools, has taken away from nature that power of slowly but\r\npermanently changing the external form and structure, in accordance with\r\nchanges in the external world, which she exercises over all other\r\nanimals. As the competing races by which they are surrounded, the\r\nclimate, the vegetation, or the animals which serve them for food, are\r\nslowly changing, they must undergo a corresponding change in their\r\nstructure, habits, and constitution, to keep them in harmony with the\r\nnew conditions--to enable them to live and maintain their numbers. But\r\nman does this by means of his intellect alone, the variations of which\r\nenable him, with an unchanged body, still to keep in harmony with the\r\nchanging universe.\r\n\r\nThere is one point, however, in which nature will still act upon him as\r\nit does on animals, and, to some extent, modify his external characters.\r\nMr. Darwin has shown, that the colour of the skin is correlated with\r\nconstitutional peculiarities both in vegetables and animals, so that\r\nliability to certain diseases or freedom from them is often accompanied\r\nby marked external characters. Now, there is every reason to believe\r\nthat this has acted, and, to some extent, may still continue to act, on\r\nman. In localities where certain diseases are prevalent, those\r\nindividuals of savage races which were subject to them would rapidly die\r\noff; while those who were constitutionally free from the disease would\r\nsurvive, and form the progenitors of a new race. These favoured\r\nindividuals would probably be distinguished by peculiarities of\r\n_colour_, with which again peculiarities in the texture or the abundance\r\nof _hair_ seem to be correlated, and thus may have been brought about\r\nthose racial differences of colour, which seem to have no relation to\r\nmere temperature or other obvious peculiarities of climate.\r\n\r\nFrom the time, therefore, when the social and sympathetic feelings came\r\ninto active operation, and the intellectual and moral faculties became\r\nfairly developed, man would cease to be influenced by \"natural\r\nselection\" in his physical form and structure. As an animal he would\r\nremain almost stationary, the changes of the surrounding universe\r\nceasing to produce in him that powerful modifying effect which they\r\nexercise over other parts of the organic world. But from the moment\r\nthat the form of his body became stationary, his mind would become\r\nsubject to those very influences from which his body had escaped; every\r\nslight variation in his mental and moral nature which should enable him\r\nbetter to guard against adverse circumstances, and combine for mutual\r\ncomfort and protection, would be preserved and accumulated; the better\r\nand higher specimens of our race would therefore increase and spread,\r\nthe lower and more brutal would give way and successively die out, and\r\nthat rapid advancement of mental organization would occur, which has\r\nraised the very lowest races of man so far above the brutes (although\r\ndiffering so little from some of them in physical structure), and, in\r\nconjunction with scarcely perceptible modifications of form, has\r\ndeveloped the wonderful intellect of the European races.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Influence of external Nature in the development of the Human Mind._\r\n\r\nBut from the time when this mental and moral advance commenced, and\r\nman's physical character became fixed and almost immutable, a new series\r\nof causes would come into action, and take part in his mental growth.\r\nThe diverse aspects of nature would now make themselves felt, and\r\nprofoundly influence the character of the primitive man.\r\n\r\nWhen the power that had hitherto modified the body had its action\r\ntransferred to the mind, then races would advance and become improved,\r\nmerely by the harsh discipline of a sterile soil and inclement seasons.\r\nUnder their influence, a hardier, a more provident, and a more social\r\nrace would be developed, than in those regions where the earth produces\r\na perennial supply of vegetable food, and where neither foresight nor\r\ningenuity are required to prepare for the rigours of winter. And is it\r\nnot the fact that in all ages, and in every quarter of the globe, the\r\ninhabitants of temperate have been superior to those of hotter\r\ncountries? All the great invasions and displacements of races have been\r\nfrom North to South, rather than the reverse; and we have no record of\r\nthere ever having existed, any more than there exists to-day, a solitary\r\ninstance of an indigenous inter-tropical civilization. The Mexican\r\ncivilization and government came from the North, and, as well as the\r\nPeruvian, was established, not in the rich tropical plains, but on the\r\nlofty and sterile plateaux of the Andes. The religion and civilization\r\nof Ceylon were introduced from North India; the successive conquerors of\r\nthe Indian peninsula came from the North-west; the northern Mongols\r\nconquered the more Southern Chinese; and it was the bold and adventurous\r\ntribes of the North that overran and infused new life into Southern\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extinction of Lower Races._\r\n\r\nIt is the same great law of \"the preservation of favoured races in the\r\nstruggle for life,\" which leads to the inevitable extinction of all\r\nthose low and mentally undeveloped populations with which Europeans come\r\nin contact. The red Indian in North America, and in Brazil; the\r\nTasmanian, Australian, and New Zealander in the southern hemisphere, die\r\nout, not from any one special cause, but from the inevitable effects of\r\nan unequal mental and physical struggle. The intellectual and moral, as\r\nwell as the physical, qualities of the European are superior; the same\r\npowers and capacities which have made him rise in a few centuries from\r\nthe condition of the wandering savage with a scanty and stationary\r\npopulation, to his present state of culture and advancement, with a\r\ngreater average longevity, a greater average strength, and a capacity of\r\nmore rapid increase,--enable him when in contact with the savage man, to\r\nconquer in the struggle for existence, and to increase at his expense,\r\njust as the better adapted, increase at the expense of the less adapted\r\nvarieties in the animal and vegetable kingdoms,--just as the weeds of\r\nEurope overrun North America and Australia, extinguishing native\r\nproductions by the inherent vigour of their organization, and by their\r\ngreater capacity for existence and multiplication.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Origin of the Races of Man._\r\n\r\nIf these views are correct; if in proportion as man's social, moral, and\r\nintellectual faculties became developed, his physical structure would\r\ncease to be affected by the operation of \"natural selection,\" we have a\r\nmost important clue to the origin of races. For it will follow, that\r\nthose great modifications of structure and of external form, which\r\nresulted in the development of man out of some lower type of animal,\r\nmust have occurred before his intellect had raised him above the\r\ncondition of the brutes, at a period when he was gregarious, but\r\nscarcely social, with a mind perceptive but not reflective, ere any\r\nsense of _right_ or feelings of _sympathy_ had been developed in him. He\r\nwould be still subject, like the rest of the organic world, to the\r\naction of \"natural selection,\" which would retain his physical form and\r\nconstitution in harmony with the surrounding universe. He was probably\r\nat a very early period a dominant race, spreading widely over the warmer\r\nregions of the earth as it then existed, and in agreement with what we\r\nsee in the case of other dominant species, gradually becoming modified\r\nin accordance with local conditions. As he ranged farther from his\r\noriginal home, and became exposed to greater extremes of climate, to\r\ngreater changes of food, and had to contend with new enemies, organic\r\nand inorganic, slight useful variations in his constitution would be\r\nselected and rendered permanent, and would, on the principle of\r\n\"correlation of growth,\" be accompanied by corresponding external\r\nphysical changes. Thus might have arisen those striking characteristics\r\nand special modifications which still distinguish the chief races of\r\nmankind. The red, black, yellow, or blushing white skin; the straight,\r\nthe curly, the woolly hair; the scanty or abundant beard; the straight\r\nor oblique eyes; the various forms of the pelvis, the cranium, and other\r\nparts of the skeleton.\r\n\r\nBut while these changes had been going on, his mental development had,\r\nfrom some unknown cause, greatly advanced, and had now reached that\r\ncondition in which it began powerfully to influence his whole existence,\r\nand would therefore become subject to the irresistible action of\r\n\"natural selection.\" This action would quickly give the ascendency to\r\nmind: speech would probably now be first developed, leading to a still\r\nfurther advance of the mental faculties; and from that moment man, as\r\nregards the form and structure of most parts of his body, would remain\r\nalmost stationary. The art of making weapons, division of labour,\r\nanticipation of the future, restraint of the appetites, moral, social,\r\nand sympathetic feelings, would now have a preponderating influence on\r\nhis well being, and would therefore be that part of his nature on which\r\n\"natural selection\" would most powerfully act; and we should thus have\r\nexplained that wonderful persistence of mere physical characteristics,\r\nwhich is the stumbling-block of those who advocate the unity of mankind.\r\n\r\nWe are now, therefore, enabled to harmonise the conflicting views of\r\nanthropologists on this subject. Man may have been, indeed I believe\r\nmust have been, once a homogeneous race; but it was at a period of which\r\nwe have as yet discovered no remains, at a period so remote in his\r\nhistory, that he had not yet acquired that wonderfully developed brain,\r\nthe organ of the mind, which now, even in his lowest examples, raises\r\nhim far above the highest brutes;--at a period when he had the form but\r\nhardly the nature of man, when he neither possessed human speech, nor\r\nthose sympathetic and moral feelings which in a greater or less degree\r\neverywhere now distinguish the race. Just in proportion as these truly\r\nhuman faculties became developed in him, would his physical features\r\nbecome fixed and permanent, because the latter would be of less\r\nimportance to his well being; he would be kept in harmony with the\r\nslowly changing universe around him, by an advance in mind, rather than\r\nby a change in body. If, therefore, we are of opinion that he was not\r\nreally man till these higher faculties were fully developed, we may\r\nfairly assert that there were many originally distinct races of men;\r\nwhile, if we think that a being closely resembling us in form and\r\nstructure, but with mental faculties scarcely raised above the brute,\r\nmust still be considered to have been human, we are fully entitled to\r\nmaintain the common origin of all mankind.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Bearing of these Views on the Antiquity of Man._\r\n\r\nThese considerations, it will be seen, enable us to place the origin of\r\nman at a much more remote geological epoch than has yet been thought\r\npossible. He may even have lived in the Miocene or Eocene period, when\r\nnot a single mammal was identical in form with any existing species.\r\nFor, in the long series of ages during which these primeval animals were\r\nbeing slowly changed into the species which now inhabit the earth, the\r\npower which acted to modify them would only affect the mental\r\norganization of man. His brain alone would have increased in size and\r\ncomplexity, and his cranium have undergone corresponding changes of\r\nform, while the whole structure of lower animals was being changed. This\r\nwill enable us to understand how the fossil crania of Denise and Engis\r\nagree so closely with existing forms, although they undoubtedly existed\r\nin company with large mammalia now extinct. The Neanderthal skull may be\r\na specimen of one of the lowest races then existing, just as the\r\nAustralians are the lowest of our modern epoch. We have no reason to\r\nsuppose that mind and brain and skull modification, could go on quicker\r\nthan that of the other parts of the organization; and we must therefore\r\nlook back very far in the past, to find man in that early condition in\r\nwhich his mind was not sufficiently developed, to remove his body from\r\nthe modifying influence of external conditions and the cumulative action\r\nof \"natural selection.\" I believe, therefore, that there is no _à\r\npriori_ reason against our finding the remains of man or his works in\r\nthe tertiary deposits. The absence of all such remains in the European\r\nbeds of this age has little weight, because, as we go further back in\r\ntime, it is natural to suppose that man's distribution over the surface\r\nof the earth was less universal than at present.\r\n\r\nBesides, Europe was in a great measure submerged during the tertiary\r\nepoch; and though its scattered islands may have been uninhabited by\r\nman, it by no means follows that he did not at the same time exist in\r\nwarm or tropical continents. If geologists can point out to us the most\r\nextensive land in the warmer regions of the earth, which has not been\r\nsubmerged since Eocene or Miocene times, it is there that we may expect\r\nto find some traces of the very early progenitors of man. It is there\r\nthat we may trace back the gradually decreasing brain of former races,\r\ntill we come to a time when the body also begins materially to differ.\r\nThen we shall have reached the starting point of the human family.\r\nBefore that period, he had not mind enough to preserve his body from\r\nchange, and would, therefore, have been subject to the same\r\ncomparatively rapid modifications of form as the other mammalia.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Their Bearing on the Dignity and Supremacy of Man._\r\n\r\nIf the views I have here endeavoured to sustain have any foundation,\r\nthey give us a new argument for placing man apart, as not only the head\r\nand culminating point of the grand series of organic nature, but as in\r\nsome degree a new and distinct order of being. From those infinitely\r\nremote ages, when the first rudiments of organic life appeared upon the\r\nearth, every plant, and every animal has been subject to one great law\r\nof physical change. As the earth has gone through its grand cycles of\r\ngeological, climatal, and organic progress, every form of life has been\r\nsubject to its irresistible action, and has been continually, but\r\nimperceptibly moulded into such new shapes as would preserve their\r\nharmony with the ever-changing universe. No living thing could escape\r\nthis law of its being; none (except, perhaps, the simplest and most\r\nrudimentary organisms), could remain unchanged and live, amid the\r\nuniversal change around it.\r\n\r\nAt length, however, there came into existence a being in whom that\r\nsubtle force we term _mind_, became of greater importance than his mere\r\nbodily structure. Though with a naked and unprotected body, _this_ gave\r\nhim clothing against the varying inclemencies of the seasons. Though\r\nunable to compete with the deer in swiftness, or with the wild bull in\r\nstrength, _this_ gave him weapons with which to capture or overcome\r\nboth. Though less capable than most other animals of living on the herbs\r\nand the fruits that unaided nature supplies, this wonderful faculty\r\ntaught him to govern and direct nature to his own benefit, and make her\r\nproduce food for him, when and where he pleased. From the moment when\r\nthe first skin was used as a covering, when the first rude spear was\r\nformed to assist in the chase, when fire was first used to cook his\r\nfood, when the first seed was sown or shoot planted, a grand revolution\r\nwas effected in nature, a revolution which in all the previous ages of\r\nthe earth's history had had no parallel, for a being had arisen who was\r\nno longer necessarily subject to change with the changing universe--a\r\nbeing who was in some degree superior to nature, inasmuch as he knew how\r\nto control and regulate her action, and could keep himself in harmony\r\nwith her, not by a change in body, but by an advance of mind.\r\n\r\nHere, then, we see the true grandeur and dignity of man. On this view of\r\nhis special attributes, we may admit, that even those who claim for him\r\na position as an order, a class, or a sub-kingdom by himself, have some\r\nshow of reason on their side. He is, indeed, a being apart, since he is\r\nnot influenced by the great laws which irresistibly modify all other\r\norganic beings. Nay more; this victory which he has gained for himself,\r\ngives him a directing influence over other existences. Man has not only\r\nescaped \"natural selection\" himself, but he is actually able to take\r\naway some of that power from nature which before his appearance she\r\nuniversally exercised. We can anticipate the time when the earth will\r\nproduce only cultivated plants and domestic animals; when man's\r\nselection shall have supplanted \"natural selection;\" and when the ocean\r\nwill be the only domain in which that power can be exerted, which for\r\ncountless cycles of ages ruled supreme over all the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Their Bearing on the future Development of Man._\r\n\r\nWe now find ourselves enabled to answer those who maintain, that if Mr.\r\nDarwin's theory of the Origin of Species is true, man too must change in\r\nform, and become developed into some other animal as different from his\r\npresent self as he is from the Gorilla or the Chimpanzee; and who\r\nspeculate on what this form is likely to be. But it is evident that such\r\nwill not be the case; for no change of conditions is conceivable, which\r\nwill render any important alteration of his form and organization so\r\nuniversally useful and necessary to him, as to give those possessing it\r\nalways the best chance of surviving, and thus lead to the development\r\nof a new species, genus, or higher group of man. On the other hand, we\r\nknow that far greater changes of conditions and of his entire\r\nenvironment have been undergone by man, than any other highly organized\r\nanimal could survive unchanged, and have been met by mental, not\r\ncorporeal adaptation. The difference of habits, of food, clothing,\r\nweapons, and enemies, between savage and civilized man, is enormous.\r\nDifference in bodily form and structure there is practically none,\r\nexcept a slightly increased size of brain, corresponding to his higher\r\nmental development.\r\n\r\nWe have every reason to believe, then, that man may have existed and may\r\ncontinue to exist, through a series of geological periods which shall\r\nsee all other forms of animal life again and again changed; while he\r\nhimself remains unchanged, except in the two particulars already\r\nspecified--the head and face, as immediately connected with the organ of\r\nthe mind and as being the medium of expressing the most refined emotions\r\nof his nature,--and to a slight extent in colour, hair, and proportions,\r\nso far as they are correlated with constitutional resistance to disease.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Summary._\r\n\r\nBriefly to recapitulate the argument;--in two distinct ways has man\r\nescaped the influence of those laws which have produced unceasing change\r\nin the animal world. 1. By his superior intellect he is enabled to\r\nprovide himself with clothing and weapons, and by cultivating the soil\r\nto obtain a constant supply of congenial food. This renders it\r\nunnecessary for his body, like those of the lower animals, to be\r\nmodified in accordance with changing conditions--to gain a warmer\r\nnatural covering, to acquire more powerful teeth or claws, or to become\r\nadapted to obtain and digest new kinds of food, as circumstances may\r\nrequire. 2. By his superior sympathetic and moral feelings, he becomes\r\nfitted for the social state; he ceases to plunder the weak and helpless\r\nof his tribe; he shares the game which he has caught with less active or\r\nless fortunate hunters, or exchanges it for weapons which even the weak\r\nor the deformed can fashion; he saves the sick and wounded from death;\r\nand thus the power which leads to the rigid destruction of all animals\r\nwho cannot in every respect help themselves, is prevented from acting on\r\nhim.\r\n\r\nThis power is \"natural selection;\" and, as by no other means can it be\r\nshown, that individual variations can ever become accumulated and\r\nrendered permanent so as to form well-marked races, it follows that the\r\ndifferences which now separate mankind from other animals, must have\r\nbeen produced before he became possessed of a human intellect or human\r\nsympathies. This view also renders possible, or even requires, the\r\nexistence of man at a comparatively remote geological epoch. For, during\r\nthe long periods in which other animals have been undergoing\r\nmodification in their whole structure, to such an amount as to\r\nconstitute distinct genera and families, man's _body_ will have\r\nremained generically, or even specifically, the same, while his _head_\r\nand _brain_ alone will have undergone modification equal to theirs. We\r\ncan thus understand how it is that, judging from the head and brain,\r\nProfessor Owen places man in a distinct sub-class of mammalia, while as\r\nregards the bony structure of his body, there is the closest anatomical\r\nresemblance to the anthropoid apes, \"every tooth, every bone, strictly\r\nhomologous--which makes the determination of the difference between\r\n_Homo_ and _Pithecus_ the anatomist's difficulty.\" The present theory\r\nfully recognises and accounts for these facts; and we may perhaps claim\r\nas corroborative of its truth, that it neither requires us to depreciate\r\nthe intellectual chasm which separates man from the apes, nor refuses\r\nfull recognition of the striking resemblances to them, which exist in\r\nother parts of his structure.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Conclusion._\r\n\r\nIn concluding this brief sketch of a great subject, I would point out\r\nits bearing upon the future of the human race. If my conclusions are\r\njust, it must inevitably follow that the higher--the more intellectual\r\nand moral--must displace the lower and more degraded races; and the\r\npower of \"natural selection,\" still acting on his mental organization,\r\nmust ever lead to the more perfect adaptation of man's higher faculties\r\nto the conditions of surrounding nature, and to the exigencies of the\r\nsocial state. While his external form will probably ever remain\r\nunchanged, except in the development of that perfect beauty which\r\nresults from a healthy and well organized body, refined and ennobled by\r\nthe highest intellectual faculties and sympathetic emotions, his mental\r\nconstitution may continue to advance and improve, till the world is\r\nagain inhabited by a single nearly homogeneous race, no individual of\r\nwhich will be inferior to the noblest specimens of existing humanity.\r\n\r\nOur progress towards such a result is very slow, but it still seems to\r\nbe a progress. We are just now living at an abnormal period of the\r\nworld's history, owing to the marvellous developments and vast practical\r\nresults of science, having been given to societies too low morally and\r\nintellectually, to know how to make the best use of them, and to whom\r\nthey have consequently been curses as well as blessings. Among civilized\r\nnations at the present day, it does not seem possible for natural\r\nselection to act in any way, so as to secure the permanent advancement\r\nof morality and intelligence; for it is indisputably the mediocre, if\r\nnot the low, both as regards morality and intelligence, who succeed best\r\nin life and multiply fastest. Yet there is undoubtedly an advance--on\r\nthe whole a steady and a permanent one--both in the influence on public\r\nopinion of a high morality, and in the general desire for intellectual\r\nelevation; and as I cannot impute this in any way to \"survival of the\r\nfittest,\" I am forced to conclude that it is due, to the inherent\r\nprogressive power of those glorious qualities which raise us so\r\nimmeasurably above our fellow animals, and at the same time afford us\r\nthe surest proof that there are other and higher existences than\r\nourselves, from whom these qualities may have been derived, and towards\r\nwhom we may be ever tending.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nX.\r\n\r\nTHE LIMITS OF NATURAL SELECTION AS APPLIED TO MAN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThroughout this volume I have endeavoured to show, that the known laws\r\nof variation, multiplication, and heredity, resulting in a \"struggle for\r\nexistence\" and the \"survival of the fittest,\" have probably sufficed to\r\nproduce all the varieties of structure, all the wonderful adaptations,\r\nall the beauty of form and of colour, that we see in the animal and\r\nvegetable kingdoms. To the best of my ability I have answered the most\r\nobvious and the most often repeated objections to this theory, and have,\r\nI hope, added to its general strength, by showing how colour--one of the\r\nstrongholds of the advocates of special creation--may be, in almost all\r\nits modifications, accounted for by the combined influence of sexual\r\nselection and the need of protection. I have also endeavoured to show,\r\nhow the same power which has modified animals has acted on man; and\r\nhave, I believe, proved that, as soon as the human intellect became\r\ndeveloped above a certain low stage, man's body would cease to be\r\nmaterially affected by natural selection, because the development of his\r\nmental faculties would render important modifications of its form and\r\nstructure unnecessary. It will, therefore, probably excite some\r\nsurprise among my readers, to find that I do not consider that all\r\nnature can be explained on the principles of which I am so ardent an\r\nadvocate; and that I am now myself going to state objections, and to\r\nplace limits, to the power of \"natural selection.\" I believe, however,\r\nthat there are such limits; and that just as surely as we can trace the\r\naction of natural laws in the development of organic forms, and can\r\nclearly conceive that fuller knowledge would enable us to follow step by\r\nstep the whole process of that development, so surely can we trace the\r\naction of some unknown higher law, beyond and independent of all those\r\nlaws of which we have any knowledge. We can trace this action more or\r\nless distinctly in many phenomena, the two most important of which\r\nare--the origin of sensation or consciousness, and the development of\r\nman from the lower animals. I shall first consider the latter difficulty\r\nas more immediately connected with the subjects discussed in this\r\nvolume.\r\n\r\n\r\n_What Natural Selection can Not do._\r\n\r\nIn considering the question of the development of man by known natural\r\nlaws, we must ever bear in mind the first principle of \"natural\r\nselection,\" no less than of the general theory of evolution, that all\r\nchanges of form or structure, all increase in the size of an organ or in\r\nits complexity, all greater specialization or physiological division of\r\nlabour, can only be brought about, in as much as it is for the good of\r\nthe being so modified. Mr. Darwin himself has taken care to impress\r\nupon us, that \"natural selection\" has no power to produce absolute\r\nperfection but only relative perfection, no power to advance any being\r\nmuch beyond his follow beings, but only just so much beyond them as to\r\nenable it to survive them in the struggle for existence. Still less has\r\nit any power to produce modifications which are in any degree injurious\r\nto its possessor, and Mr. Darwin frequently uses the strong expression,\r\nthat a single case of this kind would be fatal to his theory. If,\r\ntherefore, we find in man any characters, which all the evidence we can\r\nobtain goes to show would have been actually injurious to him on their\r\nfirst appearance, they could not possibly have been produced by natural\r\nselection. Neither could any specially developed organ have been so\r\nproduced if it had been merely useless to him, or if its use were not\r\nproportionate to its degree of development. Such cases as these would\r\nprove, that some other law, or some other power, than \"natural\r\nselection\" had been at work. But if, further, we could see that these\r\nvery modifications, though hurtful or useless at the time when they\r\nfirst appeared, became in the highest degree useful at a much later\r\nperiod, and are now essential to the full moral and intellectual\r\ndevelopment of human nature, we should then infer the action of mind,\r\nforeseeing the future and preparing for it, just as surely as we do,\r\nwhen we see the breeder set himself to work with the determination to\r\nproduce a definite improvement in some cultivated plant or domestic\r\nanimal. I would further remark that this enquiry is as thoroughly\r\nscientific and legitimate as that into the origin of species itself. It\r\nis an attempt to solve the inverse problem, to deduce the existence of a\r\nnew power of a definite character, in order to account for facts which\r\naccording to the theory of natural selection ought not to happen. Such\r\nproblems are well known to science, and the search after their solution\r\nhas often led to the most brilliant results. In the case of man, there\r\nare facts of the nature above alluded to, and in calling attention to\r\nthem, and in inferring a cause for them, I believe that I am as strictly\r\nwithin the bounds of scientific investigation as I have been in any\r\nother portion of my work.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Brain of the Savage shown to be Larger than he Needs it to be._\r\n\r\n_Size of Brain an important Element of Mental Power._--The brain is\r\nuniversally admitted to be the organ of the mind; and it is almost as\r\nuniversally admitted, that size of brain is one of the most important of\r\nthe elements which determine mental power or capacity. There seems to be\r\nno doubt that brains differ considerably in quality, as indicated by\r\ngreater or less complexity of the convolutions, quantity of grey matter,\r\nand perhaps unknown peculiarities of organization; but this difference\r\nof quality seems merely to increase or diminish the influence of\r\nquantity, not to neutralize it. Thus, all the most eminent modern\r\nwriters see an intimate connection between the diminished size of the\r\nbrain in the lower races of mankind, and their intellectual\r\ninferiority. The collections of Dr. J. B. Davis and Dr. Morton give the\r\nfollowing as the average internal capacity of the cranium in the chief\r\nraces:--Teutonic family, 94 cubic inches; Esquimaux, 91 cubic inches;\r\nNegroes, 85 cubic inches; Australians and Tasmanians, 82 cubic inches;\r\nBushmen, 77 cubic inches. These last numbers, however, are deduced from\r\ncomparatively few specimens, and may be below the average, just as a\r\nsmall number of Finns and Cossacks give 98 cubic inches, or considerably\r\nmore than that of the German races. It is evident, therefore, that the\r\nabsolute bulk of the brain is not necessarily much less in savage than\r\nin civilised man, for Esquimaux skulls are known with a capacity of 113\r\ninches, or hardly less than the largest among Europeans. But what is\r\nstill more extraordinary, the few remains yet known of pre-historic man\r\ndo not indicate any material diminution in the size of the brain case. A\r\nSwiss skull of the stone age, found in the lake dwelling of Meilen,\r\ncorresponded exactly to that of a Swiss youth of the present day. The\r\ncelebrated Neanderthal skull had a larger circumference than the\r\naverage, and its capacity, indicating actual mass of brain, is estimated\r\nto have been not less than 75 cubic inches, or nearly the average of\r\nexisting Australian crania. The Engis skull, perhaps the oldest known,\r\nand which, according to Sir John Lubbock, \"there seems no doubt was\r\nreally contemporary with the mammoth and the cave bear,\" is yet,\r\naccording to Professor Huxley, \"a fair average skull, which might have\r\nbelonged to a philosopher, or might have contained the thoughtless\r\nbrains of a savage.\" Of the cave men of Les Eyzies, who were undoubtedly\r\ncontemporary with the reindeer in the South of France, Professor Paul\r\nBroca says (in a paper read before the Congress of Pre-historic\r\nArchæology in 1868)--\"The great capacity of the brain, the development\r\nof the frontal region, the fine elliptical form of the anterior part of\r\nthe profile of the skull, are incontestible characteristics of\r\nsuperiority, such as we are accustomed to meet with in civilised races;\"\r\nyet the great breadth of the face, the enormous development of the\r\nascending ramus of the lower jaw, the extent and roughness of the\r\nsurfaces for the attachment of the muscles, especially of the\r\nmasticators, and the extraordinary development of the ridge of the\r\nfemur, indicate enormous muscular power, and the habits of a savage and\r\nbrutal race.\r\n\r\nThese facts might almost make us doubt whether the size of the brain is\r\nin any direct way an index of mental power, had we not the most\r\nconclusive evidence that it is so, in the fact that, whenever an adult\r\nmale European has a skull less than nineteen inches in circumference, or\r\nhas less than sixty-five cubic inches of brain, he is invariably\r\nidiotic. When we join with this the equally undisputed fact, that great\r\nmen--those who combine acute perception with great reflective power,\r\nstrong passions, and general energy of character, such as Napoleon,\r\nCuvier, and O'Connell, have always heads far above the average size, we\r\nmust feel satisfied that volume of brain is one, and perhaps the most\r\nimportant, measure of intellect; and this being the case, we cannot fail\r\nto be struck with the apparent anomaly, that many of the lowest savages\r\nshould have as much brains as average Europeans. The idea is suggested\r\nof a surplusage of power; of an instrument beyond the needs of its\r\npossessor.\r\n\r\n_Comparison of the Brains of Man and of Anthropoid Apes._--In order to\r\ndiscover if there is any foundation for this notion, let us compare the\r\nbrain of man with that of animals. The adult male Orang-utan is quite as\r\nbulky as a small sized man, while the Gorilla is considerably above the\r\naverage size of man, as estimated by bulk and weight; yet the former has\r\na brain of only 28 cubic inches, the latter, one of 30, or, in the\r\nlargest specimen yet known, of 34½ cubic inches. We have seen that the\r\naverage cranial capacity of the lowest savages is probably not less than\r\n_five-sixths_ of that of the highest civilized races, while the brain of\r\nthe anthropoid apes scarcely amounts to _one-third_ of that of man, in\r\nboth cases taking the average; or the proportions may be more clearly\r\nrepresented by the following figures--anthropoid apes, 10; savages, 26;\r\ncivilized man, 32. But do these figures at all approximately represent\r\nthe relative intellect of the three groups? Is the savage really no\r\nfarther removed from the philosopher, and so much removed from the ape,\r\nas these figures would indicate? In considering this question, we must\r\nnot forget that the heads of savages vary in size, almost as much as\r\nthose of civilized Europeans. Thus, while the largest Teutonic skull in\r\nDr. Davis' collection is 112·4 cubic inches, there is an Araucanian of\r\n115·5, an Esquimaux of 113·1, a Marquesan of 11O·6, a Negro of 105·8,\r\nand even an Australian of 104·5 cubic inches. We may, therefore, fairly\r\ncompare the savage with the highest European on the one side, and with\r\nthe Orang, Chimpanzee, or Gorilla, on the other, and see whether there\r\nis any relative proportion between brain and intellect.\r\n\r\n_Range of intellectual power in Man._--First, let us consider what this\r\nwonderful instrument, the brain, is capable of in its higher\r\ndevelopments. In Mr. Galton's interesting work on \"Hereditary Genius,\"\r\nhe remarks on the enormous difference between the intellectual power and\r\ngrasp of the well-trained mathematician or man of science, and the\r\naverage Englishman. The number of marks obtained by high wranglers, is\r\noften more than thirty times as great as that of the men at the bottom\r\nof the honour list, who are still of fair mathematical ability; and it\r\nis the opinion of skilled examiners, that even this does not represent\r\nthe full difference of intellectual power. If, now, we descend to those\r\nsavage tribes who only count to three or five, and who find it\r\nimpossible to comprehend the addition of two and three without having\r\nthe objects actually before them, we feel that the chasm between them\r\nand the good mathematician is so vast, that a thousand to one will\r\nprobably not fully express it. Yet we know that the mass of brain might\r\nbe nearly the same in both, or might not differ in a greater proportion\r\nthan as 5 to 6; whence we may fairly infer that the savage possesses a\r\nbrain capable, if cultivated and developed, of performing work of a kind\r\nand degree far beyond what he ever requires it to do.\r\n\r\nAgain, let us consider the power of the higher or even the average\r\ncivilized man, of forming abstract ideas, and carrying on more or less\r\ncomplex trains of reasoning. Our languages are full of terms to express\r\nabstract conceptions. Our business and our pleasures involve the\r\ncontinual foresight of many contingencies. Our law, our government, and\r\nour science, continually require us to reason through a variety of\r\ncomplicated phenomena to the expected result. Even our games, such as\r\nchess, compel us to exercise all these faculties in a remarkable degree.\r\nCompare this with the savage languages, which contain no words for\r\nabstract conceptions; the utter want of foresight of the savage man\r\nbeyond his simplest necessities; his inability to combine, or to\r\ncompare, or to reason on any general subject that does not immediately\r\nappeal to his senses. So, in his moral and æsthetic faculties, the\r\nsavage has none of those wide sympathies with all nature, those\r\nconceptions of the infinite, of the good, of the sublime and beautiful,\r\nwhich are so largely developed in civilized man. Any considerable\r\ndevelopment of these would, in fact, be useless or even hurtful to him,\r\nsince they would to some extent interfere with the supremacy of those\r\nperceptive and animal faculties on which his very existence often\r\ndepends, in the severe struggle he has to carry on against nature and\r\nhis fellow-man. Yet the rudiments of all these powers and feelings\r\nundoubtedly exist in him, since one or other of them frequently manifest\r\nthemselves in exceptional cases, or when some special circumstances call\r\nthem forth. Some tribes, such as the Santals, are remarkable for as pure\r\na love of truth as the most moral among civilized men. The Hindoo and\r\nthe Polynesian have a high artistic feeling, the first traces of which\r\nare clearly visible in the rude drawings of the palæolithic men who were\r\nthe contemporaries in France of the Reindeer and the Mammoth. Instances\r\nof unselfish love, of true gratitude, and of deep religious feeling,\r\nsometimes occur among most savage races.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, then, we may conclude, that the general moral and\r\nintellectual development of the savage, is not less removed from that of\r\ncivilized man than has been shown to be the case in the one department\r\nof mathematics; and from the fact that all the moral and intellectual\r\nfaculties do occasionally manifest themselves, we may fairly conclude\r\nthat they are always latent, and that the large brain of the savage man\r\nis much beyond his actual requirements in the savage state.\r\n\r\n_Intellect of Savages and of Animals compared._--Let us now compare the\r\nintellectual wants of the savage, and the actual amount of intellect he\r\nexhibits, with those of the higher animals. Such races as the Andaman\r\nIslanders, the Australians, and the Tasmanians, the Digger Indians of\r\nNorth America, or the natives of Fuegia, pass their lives so as to\r\nrequire the exercise of few faculties not possessed in an equal degree\r\nby many animals. In the mode of capture of game or fish, they by no\r\nmeans surpass the ingenuity or forethought of the jaguar, who drops\r\nsaliva into the water, and seizes the fish as they come to eat it; or of\r\nwolves and jackals, who hunt in packs; or of the fox, who buries his\r\nsurplus food till he requires it. The sentinels placed by antelopes and\r\nby monkeys, and the various modes of building adopted by field mice and\r\nbeavers, as well as the sleeping place of the orang-utan, and the\r\ntree-shelter of some of the African anthropoid apes, may well be\r\ncompared with the amount of care and forethought bestowed by many\r\nsavages in similar circumstances. His possession of free and perfect\r\nhands, not required for locomotion, enable man to form and use weapons\r\nand implements which are beyond the physical powers of brutes; but\r\nhaving done this, he certainly does not exhibit more mind in using them\r\nthan do many lower animals. What is there in the life of the savage, but\r\nthe satisfying of the cravings of appetite in the simplest and easiest\r\nway? What thoughts, ideas, or actions are there, that raise him many\r\ngrades above the elephant or the ape? Yet he possesses, as we have seen,\r\na brain vastly superior to theirs in size and complexity; and this brain\r\ngives him, in an undeveloped state, faculties which he never requires to\r\nuse. And if this is true of existing savages, how much more true must\r\nit have been of the men whose sole weapons were rudely chipped flints,\r\nand some of whom, we may fairly conclude, were lower than any existing\r\nrace; while the only evidence yet in our possession shows them to have\r\nhad brains fully as capacious as those of the average of the lower\r\nsavage races.\r\n\r\nWe see, then, that whether we compare the savage with the higher\r\ndevelopments of man, or with the brutes around him, we are alike driven\r\nto the conclusion that in his large and well-developed brain he\r\npossesses an organ quite disproportionate to his actual requirements--an\r\norgan that seems prepared in advance, only to be fully utilized as he\r\nprogresses in civilization. A brain slightly larger than that of the\r\ngorilla would, according to the evidence before us, fully have sufficed\r\nfor the limited mental development of the savage; and we must therefore\r\nadmit, that the large brain he actually possesses could never have been\r\nsolely developed by any of those laws of evolution, whose essence is,\r\nthat they lead to a degree of organization exactly proportionate to the\r\nwants of each species, never beyond those wants--that no preparation can\r\nbe made for the future development of the race--that one part of the\r\nbody can never increase in size or complexity, except in strict\r\nco-ordination to the pressing wants of the whole. The brain of\r\npre-historic and of savage man seems to me to prove the existence of\r\nsome power, distinct from that which has guided the development of the\r\nlower animals through their ever-varying forms of being.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Use of the Hairy Covering of Mammalia._\r\n\r\nLet us now consider another point in man's organization, the bearing of\r\nwhich has been almost entirely overlooked by writers on both sides of\r\nthis question. One of the most general external characters of the\r\nterrestrial mammalia is the hairy covering of the body, which, whenever\r\nthe skin is flexible, soft, and sensitive, forms a natural protection\r\nagainst the severities of climate, and particularly against rain. That\r\nthis is its most important function, is well shown by the manner in\r\nwhich the hairs are disposed so as to carry off the water, by being\r\ninvariably directed downwards from the most elevated parts of the body.\r\nThus, on the under surface the hair is always less plentiful, and, in\r\nmany cases, the belly is almost bare. The hair lies downwards, on the\r\nlimbs of all walking mammals, from the shoulder to the toes, but in the\r\norang-utan it is directed from the shoulder to the elbow, and again from\r\nthe wrist to the elbow, in a reverse direction. This corresponds to the\r\nhabits of the animal, which, when resting, holds its long arms upwards\r\nover its head, or clasping a branch above it, so that the rain would\r\nflow down both the arm and fore-arm to the long hair which meets at the\r\nelbow. In accordance with this principle, the hair is always longer or\r\nmore dense along the spine or middle of the back from the nape to the\r\ntail, often rising into a crest of hair or bristles on the ridge of the\r\nback. This character prevails through the entire series of the mammalia,\r\nfrom the marsupials to the quadrumana, and by this long persistence it\r\nmust have acquired such a powerful hereditary tendency, that we should\r\nexpect it to reappear continually even after it had been abolished by\r\nages of the most rigid selection; and we may feel sure that it never\r\ncould have been completely abolished under the law of natural selection,\r\nunless it had become so positively injurious as to lead to the almost\r\ninvariable extinction of individuals possessing it.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The constant absence of Hair from certain parts of Man's Body a\r\nremarkable Phenomenon._\r\n\r\nIn man the hairy covering of the body has almost totally disappeared,\r\nand, what is very remarkable, it has disappeared more completely from\r\nthe back than from any other part of the body. Bearded and beardless\r\nraces alike have the back smooth, and even when a considerable quantity\r\nof hair appears on the limbs and breast, the back, and especially the\r\nspinal region, is absolutely free, thus completely reversing the\r\ncharacteristics of all other mammalia. The Ainos of the Kurile Islands\r\nand Japan are said to be a hairy race; but Mr. Bickmore, who saw some of\r\nthem, and described them in a paper read before the Ethnological\r\nSociety, gives no details as to where the hair was most abundant, merely\r\nstating generally, that \"their chief peculiarity is their great\r\nabundance of hair, not only on the head and face, but over the whole\r\nbody.\" This might very well be said of any man who had hairy limbs and\r\nbreast, unless it was specially stated that his back was hairy, which\r\nis not done in this case. The hairy family in Birmah have, indeed, hair\r\non the back rather longer than on the breast, thus reproducing the true\r\nmammalian character, but they have still longer hair on the face,\r\nforehead, and inside the ears, which is quite abnormal; and the fact\r\nthat their teeth are all very imperfect, shows that this is a case of\r\nmonstrosity rather than one of true reversion to the ancestral type of\r\nman before he lost his hairy covering.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Savage Man feels the Want of this Hairy Covering._\r\n\r\nWe must now enquire if we have any evidence to show, or any reason to\r\nbelieve, that a hairy covering to the back would be in any degree\r\nhurtful to savage man, or to man in any stage of his progress from his\r\nlower animal form; and if it were merely useless, could it have been so\r\nentirely and completely removed as not to be continually reappearing in\r\nmixed races? Let us look to savage man for some light on these points.\r\nOne of the most common habits of savages is to use some covering for the\r\nback and shoulders, even when they have none on any other part of the\r\nbody. The early voyagers observed with surprise, that the Tasmanians,\r\nboth men and women, wore the kangaroo-skin, which was their only\r\ncovering, not from any feeling of modesty, but over the shoulders to\r\nkeep the back dry and warm. A cloth over the shoulders was also the\r\nnational dress of the Maories. The Patagonians wear a cloak or mantle\r\nover the shoulders, and the Fuegians often wear a small piece of skin on\r\nthe back, laced on, and shifted from side to side as the wind blows.\r\nThe Hottentots also wore a somewhat similar skin over the back, which\r\nthey never removed, and in which they were buried. Even in the tropics\r\nmost savages take precautions to keep their backs dry. The natives of\r\nTimor use the leaf of a fan palm, carefully stitched up and folded,\r\nwhich they always carry with them, and which, held over the back, forms\r\nan admirable protection from the rain. Almost all the Malay races, as\r\nwell as the Indians of South America, make great palm-leaf hats, four\r\nfeet or more across, which they use during their canoe voyages to\r\nprotect their bodies from heavy showers of rain; and they use smaller\r\nhats of the same kind when travelling by land.\r\n\r\nWe find, then, that so far from there being any reason to believe that a\r\nhairy covering to the back could have been hurtful or even useless to\r\npre-historic man, the habits of modern savages indicate exactly the\r\nopposite view, as they evidently feel the want of it, and are obliged to\r\nprovide substitutes of various kinds. The perfectly erect posture of\r\nman, may be supposed to have something to do with the disappearance of\r\nthe hair from his body, while it remains on his head; but when walking,\r\nexposed to rain and wind, a man naturally stoops forwards, and thus\r\nexposes his back; and the undoubted fact, that most savages feel the\r\neffects of cold and wet most severely in that part of the body,\r\nsufficiently demonstrates that the hair could not have ceased to grow\r\nthere merely because it was useless, even if it were likely that a\r\ncharacter so long persistent in the entire order of mammalia, could have\r\nso completely disappeared, under the influence of so weak a selective\r\npower as a diminished usefulness.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Man's Naked Skin could not have been produced by Natural Selection._\r\n\r\nIt seems to me, then, to be absolutely certain, that \"Natural Selection\"\r\ncould not have produced man's hairless body by the accumulation of\r\nvariations from a hairy ancestor. The evidence all goes to show that\r\nsuch variations could not have been useful, but must, on the contrary,\r\nhave been to some extent hurtful. If even, owing to an unknown\r\ncorrelation with other hurtful qualities, it had been abolished in the\r\nancestral tropical man, we cannot conceive that, as man spread into\r\ncolder climates, it should not have returned under the powerful\r\ninfluence of reversion to such a long persistent ancestral type. But the\r\nvery foundation of such a supposition as this is untenable; for we\r\ncannot suppose that a character which, like hairiness, exists throughout\r\nthe whole of the mammalia, can have become, in one form only, so\r\nconstantly correlated with an injurious character, as to lead to its\r\npermanent suppression--a suppression so complete and effectual that it\r\nnever, or scarcely ever, reappears in mongrels of the most widely\r\ndifferent races of man.\r\n\r\nTwo characters could hardly be wider apart, than the size and\r\ndevelopment of man's brain, and the distribution of hair upon the\r\nsurface of his body; yet they both lead us to the same conclusion--that\r\nsome other power than Natural Selection has been engaged in his\r\nproduction.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Feet and Hands of Man, considered as Difficulties on the Theory of\r\nNatural Selection._\r\n\r\nThere are a few other physical characteristics of man, that may just be\r\nmentioned as offering similar difficulties, though I do not attach the\r\nsame importance to them as to those I have already dwelt on. The\r\nspecialization and perfection of the hands and feet of man seems\r\ndifficult to account for. Throughout the whole of the quadrumana the\r\nfoot is prehensile; and a very rigid selection must therefore have been\r\nneeded to bring about that arrangement of the bones and muscles, which\r\nhas converted the thumb into a great toe, so completely, that the power\r\nof opposability is totally lost in every race, whatever some travellers\r\nmay vaguely assert to the contrary. It is difficult to see why the\r\nprehensile power should have been taken away. It must certainly have\r\nbeen useful in climbing, and the case of the baboons shows that it is\r\nquite compatible with terrestrial locomotion. It may not be compatible\r\nwith perfectly easy erect locomotion; but, then, how can we conceive\r\nthat early man, _as an animal_, gained anything by purely erect\r\nlocomotion? Again, the hand of man contains latent capacities and powers\r\nwhich are unused by savages, and must have been even less used by\r\npalæolithic man and his still ruder predecessors. It has all the\r\nappearance of an organ prepared for the use of civilized man, and one\r\nwhich was required to render civilization possible. Apes make little use\r\nof their separate fingers and opposable thumbs. They grasp objects\r\nrudely and clumsily, and look as if a much less specialized extremity\r\nwould have served their purpose as well. I do not lay much stress on\r\nthis, but, if it be proved that some intelligent power has guided or\r\ndetermined the development of man, then we may see indications of that\r\npower, in facts which, by themselves, would not serve to prove its\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n_The voice of man._--The same remark will apply to another peculiarly\r\nhuman character, the wonderful power, range, flexibility, and sweetness,\r\nof the musical sounds producible by the human larynx, especially in the\r\nfemale sex. The habits of savages give no indication of how this faculty\r\ncould have been developed by natural selection; because it is never\r\nrequired or used by them. The singing of savages is a more or less\r\nmonotonous howling, and the females seldom sing at all. Savages\r\ncertainly never choose their wives for fine voices, but for rude health,\r\nand strength, and physical beauty. Sexual selection could not therefore\r\nhave developed this wonderful power, which only comes into play among\r\ncivilized people. It seems as if the organ had been prepared in\r\nanticipation of the future progress of man, since it contains latent\r\ncapacities which are useless to him in his earlier condition. The\r\ndelicate correlations of structure that give it such marvellous powers,\r\ncould not therefore have been acquired by means of natural selection.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Origin of some of Man's Mental Faculties, by the preservation of\r\nUseful Variations, not possible._\r\n\r\nTurning to the mind of man, we meet with many difficulties in attempting\r\nto understand, how those mental faculties, which are especially human,\r\ncould have been acquired by the preservation of useful variations. At\r\nfirst sight, it would seem that such feelings as those of abstract\r\njustice and benevolence could never have been so acquired, because they\r\nare incompatible with the law of the strongest, which is the essence of\r\nnatural selection. But this is, I think, an erroneous view, because we\r\nmust look, not to individuals but to societies; and justice and\r\nbenevolence, exercised towards members of the same tribe, would\r\ncertainly tend to strengthen that tribe, and give it a superiority over\r\nanother in which the right of the strongest prevailed, and where\r\nconsequently the weak and the sickly were left to perish, and the few\r\nstrong ruthlessly destroyed the many who were weaker.\r\n\r\nBut there is another class of human faculties that do not regard our\r\nfellow men, and which cannot, therefore, be thus accounted for. Such are\r\nthe capacity to form ideal conceptions of space and time, of eternity\r\nand infinity--the capacity for intense artistic feelings of pleasure, in\r\nform, colour, and composition--and for those abstract notions of form\r\nand number which render geometry and arithmetic possible. How were all\r\nor any of these faculties first developed, when they could have been of\r\nno possible use to man in his early stages of barbarism? How could\r\n\"natural selection,\" or survival of the fittest in the struggle for\r\nexistence, at all favour the development of mental powers so entirely\r\nremoved from the material necessities of savage men, and which even now,\r\nwith our comparatively high civilization, are, in their farthest\r\ndevelopments, in advance of the age, and appear to have relation rather\r\nto the future of the race than to its actual status?\r\n\r\n\r\n_Difficulty as to the Origin of the Moral Sense._\r\n\r\nExactly the same difficulty arises, when we endeavour to account for the\r\ndevelopment of the moral sense or conscience in savage man; for although\r\nthe _practice_ of benevolence, honesty, or truth, may have been useful\r\nto the tribe possessing these virtues, that does not at all account for\r\nthe peculiar _sanctity_, attached to actions which each tribe considers\r\nright and moral, as contrasted with the very different feelings with\r\nwhich they regard what is merely _useful_. The utilitarian hypothesis\r\n(which is the theory of natural selection applied to the mind) seems\r\ninadequate to account for the development of the moral sense. This\r\nsubject has been recently much discussed, and I will here only give one\r\nexample to illustrate my argument. The utilitarian sanction for\r\ntruthfulness is by no means very powerful or universal. Few laws enforce\r\nit. No very severe reprobation follows untruthfulness. In all ages and\r\ncountries, falsehood has been thought allowable in love, and laudable in\r\nwar; while, at the present day, it is held to be venial by the majority\r\nof mankind, in trade, commerce, and speculation. A certain amount of\r\nuntruthfulness is a necessary part of politeness in the east and west\r\nalike, while even severe moralists have held a lie justifiable, to elude\r\nan enemy or prevent a crime. Such being the difficulties with which this\r\nvirtue has had to struggle, with so many exceptions to its practice,\r\nwith so many instances in which it brought ruin or death to its too\r\nardent devotee, how can we believe that considerations of utility could\r\never invest it with the mysterious sanctity of the highest\r\nvirtue,--could ever induce men to value truth for its own sake, and\r\npractice it regardless of consequences?\r\n\r\nYet, it is a fact, that such a mystical sense of wrong does attach to\r\nuntruthfulness, not only among the higher classes of civilized people,\r\nbut among whole tribes of utter savages. Sir Walter Elliott tells us (in\r\nhis paper \"On the Characteristics of the Population of Central and\r\nSouthern India,\" published in the Journal of the Ethnological Society of\r\nLondon, vol. i., p. 107) that the Kurubars and Santals, barbarous\r\nhill-tribes of Central India, are noted for veracity. It is a common\r\nsaying that \"a Kurubar _always_ speaks the truth;\" and Major Jervis\r\nsays, \"the Santals are the most truthful men I ever met with.\" As a\r\nremarkable instance of this quality the following fact is given. A\r\nnumber of prisoners, taken during the Santal insurrection, were allowed\r\nto go free on parole, to work at a certain spot for wages. After some\r\ntime cholera attacked them and they were obliged to leave, but every man\r\nof them returned and gave up his earnings to the guard. Two hundred\r\nsavages with money in their girdles, walked thirty miles back to prison\r\nrather than break their word! My own experience among savages has\r\nfurnished me with similar, although less severely tested, instances; and\r\nwe cannot avoid asking, how is it, that in these few cases \"experiences\r\nof utility\" have left such an overwhelming impression, while in so many\r\nothers they have left none? The experiences of savage men as regards the\r\nutility of truth, must, in the long run, be pretty nearly equal. How is\r\nit, then, that in some cases the result is a sanctity which overrides\r\nall considerations of personal advantage, while in others there is\r\nhardly a rudiment of such a feeling?\r\n\r\nThe intuitional theory, which I am now advocating, explains this by the\r\nsupposition, that there is a feeling--a sense of right and wrong--in our\r\nnature, antecedent to and independent of experiences of utility. Where\r\nfree play is allowed to the relations between man and man, this feeling\r\nattaches itself to those acts of universal utility or self-sacrifice,\r\nwhich are the products of our affections and sympathies, and which we\r\nterm moral; while it may be, and often is, perverted, to give the same\r\nsanction to acts of narrow and conventional utility which are really\r\nimmoral,--as when the Hindoo will tell a lie, but will sooner starve\r\nthan eat unclean food; and looks upon the marriage of adult females as\r\ngross immorality.\r\n\r\nThe strength of the moral feeling will depend upon individual or racial\r\nconstitution, and on education and habit;--the acts to which its\r\nsanctions are applied, will depend upon how far the simple feelings and\r\naffections of our nature, have been modified by custom, by law, or by\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to conceive that such an intense and mystical feeling of\r\nright and wrong, (so intense as to overcome all ideas of personal\r\nadvantage or utility), could have been developed out of accumulated\r\nancestral experiences of utility; and still more difficult to\r\nunderstand, how feelings developed by one set of utilities, could be\r\ntransferred to acts of which the utility was partial, imaginary, or\r\naltogether absent. But if a moral sense is an essential part of our\r\nnature, it is easy to see, that its sanction may often be given to acts\r\nwhich are useless or immoral; just as the natural appetite for drink, is\r\nperverted by the drunkard into the means of his destruction.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Summary of the Argument as to the Insufficiency of Natural Selection to\r\naccount for the Development of Man._\r\n\r\nBriefly to resume my argument--I have shown that the brain of the lowest\r\nsavages, and, as far as we yet know, of the pre-historic races, is\r\nlittle inferior in size to that of the highest types of man, and\r\nimmensely superior to that of the higher animals; while it is\r\nuniversally admitted that quantity of brain is one of the most\r\nimportant, and probably the most essential, of the elements which\r\ndetermine mental power. Yet the mental requirements of savages, and the\r\nfaculties actually exercised by them, are very little above those of\r\nanimals. The higher feelings of pure morality and refined emotion, and\r\nthe power of abstract reasoning and ideal conception, are useless to\r\nthem, are rarely if ever manifested, and have no important relations to\r\ntheir habits, wants, desires, or well-being. They possess a mental organ\r\nbeyond their needs. Natural Selection could only have endowed savage man\r\nwith a brain a little superior to that of an ape, whereas he actually\r\npossesses one very little inferior to that of a philosopher.\r\n\r\nThe soft, naked, sensitive skin of man, entirely free from that hairy\r\ncovering which is so universal among other mammalia, cannot be explained\r\non the theory of natural selection. The habits of savages show that they\r\nfeel the want of this covering, which is most completely absent in man\r\nexactly where it is thickest in other animals. We have no reason\r\nwhatever to believe, that it could have been hurtful, or even useless to\r\nprimitive man; and, under these circumstances, its complete abolition,\r\nshown by its never reverting in mixed breeds, is a demonstration of the\r\nagency of some other power than the law of the survival of the fittest,\r\nin the development of man from the lower animals.\r\n\r\nOther characters show difficulties of a similar kind, though not perhaps\r\nin an equal degree. The structure of the human foot and hand seem\r\nunnecessarily perfect for the needs of savage man, in whom they are as\r\ncompletely and as humanly developed as in the highest races. The\r\nstructure of the human larynx, giving the power of speech and of\r\nproducing musical sounds, and especially its extreme development in the\r\nfemale sex, are shown to be beyond the needs of savages, and from their\r\nknown habits, impossible to have been acquired either by sexual\r\nselection, or by survival of the fittest.\r\n\r\nThe mind of man offers arguments in the same direction, hardly less\r\nstrong than those derived from his bodily structure. A number of his\r\nmental faculties have no relation to his fellow men, or to his material\r\nprogress. The power of conceiving eternity and infinity, and all those\r\npurely abstract notions of form, number, and harmony, which play so\r\nlarge a part in the life of civilised races, are entirely outside of the\r\nworld of thought of the savage, and have no influence on his individual\r\nexistence or on that of his tribe. They could not, therefore, have been\r\ndeveloped by any preservation of useful forms of thought; yet we find\r\noccasional traces of them amidst a low civilization, and at a time when\r\nthey could have had no practical effect on the success of the\r\nindividual, the family, or the race; and the development of a moral\r\nsense or conscience by similar means is equally inconceivable.\r\n\r\nBut, on the other hand, we find that every one of these characteristics\r\nis necessary for the full development of human nature. The rapid\r\nprogress of civilization under favourable conditions, would not be\r\npossible, were not the organ of the mind of man prepared in advance,\r\nfully developed as regards size, structure, and proportions, and only\r\nneeding a few generations of use and habit to co-ordinate its complex\r\nfunctions. The naked and sensitive skin, by necessitating clothing and\r\nhouses, would lead to the more rapid development of man's inventive and\r\nconstructive faculties; and, by leading to a more refined feeling of\r\npersonal modesty, may have influenced, to a considerable extent, his\r\nmoral nature. The erect form of man, by freeing the hands from all\r\nlocomotive uses, has been necessary for his intellectual advancement;\r\nand the extreme perfection of his hands, has alone rendered possible\r\nthat excellence in all the arts of civilization which raises him so far\r\nabove the savage, and is perhaps but the forerunner of a higher\r\nintellectual and moral advancement. The perfection of his vocal organs\r\nhas first led to the formation of articulate speech, and then to the\r\ndevelopment of those exquisitely toned sounds, which are only\r\nappreciated by the higher races, and which are probably destined for\r\nmore elevated uses and more refined enjoyment, in a higher condition\r\nthan we have yet attained to. So, those faculties which enable us to\r\ntranscend time and space, and to realize the wonderful conceptions of\r\nmathematics and philosophy, or which give us an intense yearning for\r\nabstract truth, (all of which were occasionally manifested at such an\r\nearly period of human history as to be far in advance of any of the few\r\npractical applications which have since grown out of them), are\r\nevidently essential to the perfect development of man as a spiritual\r\nbeing, but are utterly inconceivable as having been produced through the\r\naction of a law which looks only, and can look only, to the immediate\r\nmaterial welfare of the individual or the race.\r\n\r\nThe inference I would draw from this class of phenomena is, that a\r\nsuperior intelligence has guided the development of man in a definite\r\ndirection, and for a special purpose, just as man guides the development\r\nof many animal and vegetable forms. The laws of evolution alone would,\r\nperhaps, never have produced a grain so well adapted to man's use as\r\nwheat and maize; such fruits as the seedless banana and bread-fruit; or\r\nsuch animals as the Guernsey milch cow, or the London dray-horse. Yet\r\nthese so closely resemble the unaided productions of nature, that we may\r\nwell imagine a being who had mastered the laws of development of organic\r\nforms through past ages, refusing to believe that any new power had been\r\nconcerned in their production, and scornfully rejecting the theory (as\r\nmy theory will be rejected by many who agree with me on other points),\r\nthat in these few cases a controlling intelligence had directed the\r\naction of the laws of variation, multiplication, and survival, for his\r\nown purposes. We know, however, that this has been done; and we must\r\ntherefore admit the possibility that, if we are not the highest\r\nintelligences in the universe, some higher intelligence may have\r\ndirected the process by which the human race was developed, by means of\r\nmore subtle agencies than we are acquainted with. At the same time I\r\nmust confess, that this theory has the disadvantage of requiring the\r\nintervention of some distinct individual intelligence, to aid in the\r\nproduction of what we can hardly avoid considering as the ultimate aim\r\nand outcome of all organized existence--intellectual, ever-advancing,\r\nspiritual man. It therefore implies, that the great laws which govern\r\nthe material universe were insufficient for his production, unless we\r\nconsider (as we may fairly do) that the controlling action of such\r\nhigher intelligences is a necessary part of those laws, just as the\r\naction of all surrounding organisms is one of the agencies in organic\r\ndevelopment. But even if my particular view should not be the true one,\r\nthe difficulties I have put forward remain, and I think prove, that some\r\nmore general and more fundamental law underlies that of \"natural\r\nselection.\" The law of \"unconscious intelligence\" pervading all organic\r\nnature, put forth by Dr. Laycock and adopted by Mr. Murphy, is such a\r\nlaw; but to my mind it has the double disadvantage of being both\r\nunintelligible and incapable of any kind of proof. It is more probable,\r\nthat the true law lies too deep for us to discover it; but there seems\r\nto me, to be ample indications that such a law does exist, and is\r\nprobably connected with the absolute origin of life and organization.\r\n(_Note A._)\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Origin of Consciousness._\r\n\r\nThe question of the origin of sensation and of thought can be but\r\nbriefly discussed in this place, since it is a subject wide enough to\r\nrequire a separate volume for its proper treatment. No physiologist or\r\nphilosopher has yet ventured to propound an intelligible theory, of how\r\nsensation may possibly be a product of organization; while many have\r\ndeclared the passage from matter to mind to be inconceivable. In his\r\npresidential address to the Physical Section of the British Association\r\nat Norwich, in 1868, Professor Tyndall expressed himself as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"The passage from the physics of the brain to the corresponding facts of\r\nconsciousness is unthinkable. Granted that a definite thought, and a\r\ndefinite molecular action in the brain occur simultaneously, we do not\r\npossess the intellectual organ, nor apparently any rudiment of the\r\norgan, which would enable us to pass by a process of reasoning from the\r\none phenomenon to the other. They appear together, but we do not know\r\nwhy. Were our minds and senses so expanded, strengthened, and\r\nilluminated as to enable us to see and feel the very molecules of the\r\nbrain; were we capable of following all their motions, all their\r\ngroupings, all their electric discharges, if such there be, and were we\r\nintimately acquainted with the corresponding states of thought and\r\nfeeling, we should be as far as ever from the solution of the problem,\r\n'How are these physical processes connected with the facts of\r\nconsciousness?' The chasm between the two classes of phenomena would\r\nstill remain intellectually impassable.\"\r\n\r\nIn his latest work (\"An Introduction to the Classification of Animals,\")\r\npublished in 1869, Professor Huxley unhesitatingly adopts the \"well\r\nfounded doctrine, that life is the cause and not the consequence of\r\norganization.\" In his celebrated article \"On the Physical Basis of\r\nLife,\" however, he maintains, that life is a property of protoplasm, and\r\nthat protoplasm owes its properties to the nature and disposition of its\r\nmolecules. Hence he terms it \"the matter of life,\" and believes that all\r\nthe physical properties of organized beings are due to the physical\r\nproperties of protoplasm. So far we might, perhaps, follow him, but he\r\ndoes not stop here. He proceeds to bridge over that chasm which\r\nProfessor Tyndall has declared to be \"intellectually impassable,\" and,\r\nby means which he states to be logical, arrives at the conclusion, that\r\nour \"_thoughts are the expression of molecular changes in that matter of\r\nlife which is the source of our other vital phenomena_.\" Not having been\r\nable to find any clue in Professor Huxley's writings, to the steps by\r\nwhich he passes from those vital phenomena, which consist only, in their\r\nlast analysis, of movements of particles of matter, to those other\r\nphenomena which we term thought, sensation, or consciousness; but,\r\nknowing that so positive an expression of opinion from him will have\r\ngreat weight with many persons, I shall endeavour to show, with as much\r\nbrevity as is compatible with clearness, that this theory is not only\r\nincapable of proof, but is also, as it appears to me, inconsistent with\r\naccurate conceptions of molecular physics. To do this, and in order\r\nfurther to develop my views, I shall have to give a brief sketch of the\r\nmost recent speculations and discoveries, as to the ultimate nature and\r\nconstitution of matter.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The Nature of Matter._\r\n\r\nIt has been long seen by the best thinkers on the subject, that\r\natoms,--considered as minute solid bodies from which emanate the\r\nattractive and repulsive forces which give what we term matter its\r\nproperties,--could serve no purpose whatever; since it is universally\r\nadmitted that the supposed atoms never touch each other, and it cannot\r\nbe conceived that these homogeneous, indivisible, solid units, are\r\nthemselves the ultimate _cause_ of the forces that emanate from their\r\ncentres. As, therefore, none of the properties of matter can be due to\r\nthe atoms themselves, but only to the forces which emanate from the\r\npoints in space indicated by the atomic centres, it is logical\r\ncontinually to diminish their size till they vanish, leaving only\r\nlocalized centres of force to represent them. Of the various attempts\r\nthat have been made to show how the properties of matter may be due to\r\nsuch modified atoms (considered as mere centres of force), the most\r\nsuccessful, because the simplest and the most logical, is that of Mr.\r\nBayma, who, in his \"Molecular Mechanics,\" has demonstrated how, from the\r\nsimple assumption of such centres having attractive and repulsive forces\r\n(both varying according to the same law of the inverse squares as\r\ngravitation), and by grouping them in symmetrical figures, consisting of\r\na repulsive centre, an attractive nucleus, and one or more repulsive\r\nenvelopes, we may explain all the general properties of matter; and, by\r\nmore and more complex arrangements, even the special chemical,\r\nelectrical, and magnetic properties of special forms of matter.[I] Each\r\nchemical element will thus consist of a molecule formed of simple atoms,\r\n(or as Mr. Bayma terms them to avoid confusion, \"material elements\") in\r\ngreater or less number and of more or less complex arrangement; which\r\nmolecule is in stable equilibrium, but liable to be changed in form by\r\nthe attractive or repulsive influences of differently constituted\r\nmolecules, constituting the phenomena of chemical combination, and\r\nresulting in new forms of molecule of greater complexity and more or\r\nless stability.\r\n\r\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n  | [I] Mr. Bayma's work, entitled \"The Elements of Molecular    |\r\n  | Mechanics,\" was published in 1866, and has received less     |\r\n  | attention than it deserves. It is characterised by great     |\r\n  | lucidity, by logical arrangement, and by comparatively       |\r\n  | simple geometrical and algebraical demonstrations, so that   |\r\n  | it may be understood and appreciated with a very moderate    |\r\n  | knowledge of mathematics. It consists of a series of         |\r\n  | Propositions, deduced from the known properties of matter;   |\r\n  | from these are derived a number of Theorems, by whose help   |\r\n  | the more complicated Problems are solved. Nothing is taken   |\r\n  | for granted throughout the work, and the only valid mode of  |\r\n  | escaping from its conclusions is, by either disproving the   |\r\n  | fundamental Propositions, or by detecting fallacies in the   |\r\n  | subsequent reasoning.                                        |\r\n  +--------------------------------------------------------------+\r\n\r\nThose organic compounds of which organized beings are built up, consist,\r\nas is well known, of matter of an extreme complexity. and great\r\ninstability; whence result the changes of form to which it is\r\ncontinually subject. This view enables us to comprehend the\r\n_possibility_, of the phenomena of vegetative life being due to an\r\nalmost infinite complexity of molecular combinations, subject to\r\ndefinite changes under the stimuli of heat, moisture, light,\r\nelectricity, and probably some unknown forces. But this greater and\r\ngreater complexity, even if carried to an infinite extent, cannot, of\r\nitself, have the slightest tendency to originate consciousness in such\r\nmolecules or groups of molecules. If a material element, or a\r\ncombination of a thousand material elements in a molecule, are alike\r\nunconscious, it is impossible for us to believe, that the mere addition\r\nof one, two, or a thousand other material elements to form a more\r\ncomplex molecule, could in any way tend to produce a self-conscious\r\nexistence. The things are radically distinct. To say that mind is a\r\nproduct or function of protoplasm, or of its molecular changes, is to\r\nuse words to which we can attach no clear conception. You cannot have,\r\nin the whole, what does not exist in any of the parts; and those who\r\nargue thus should put forth a definite conception of matter, with\r\nclearly enunciated properties, and show, that the necessary result of a\r\ncertain complex arrangement of the elements or atoms of that matter,\r\nwill be the production of self-consciousness. There is no escape from\r\nthis dilemma,--either all matter is conscious, or consciousness is\r\nsomething distinct from matter, and in the latter case, its presence in\r\nmaterial forms is a proof of the existence of conscious beings, outside\r\nof, and independent of, what we term matter. (_Note B._)\r\n\r\n_Matter is Force._--The foregoing considerations lead us to the very\r\nimportant conclusion, that matter is essentially force, and nothing but\r\nforce; that matter, as popularly understood, does not exist, and is, in\r\nfact, philosophically inconceivable. When we touch matter, we only\r\nreally experience sensations of resistance, implying repulsive force;\r\nand no other sense can give us such apparently solid proofs of the\r\nreality of matter, as touch does. This conclusion, if kept constantly\r\npresent in the mind, will be found to have a most important bearing on\r\nalmost every high scientific and philosophical problem, and especially\r\non such as relate to our own conscious existence.\r\n\r\n_All Force is probably Will-Force._--If we are satisfied that force or\r\nforces are all that exist in the material universe, we are next led to\r\nenquire what is force? We are acquainted with two radically distinct or\r\napparently distinct kinds of force--the first consists of the primary\r\nforces of nature, such as gravitation, cohesion, repulsion, heat,\r\nelectricity, &c.; the second is our own will-force. Many persons will at\r\nonce deny that the latter exists. It will be said, that it is a mere\r\ntransformation of the primary forces before alluded to; that the\r\ncorrelation of forces includes those of animal life, and that _will_\r\nitself is but the result of molecular change in the brain. I think,\r\nhowever, that it can be shown, that this latter assertion has neither\r\nbeen proved, nor even been proved to be possible; and that in making it,\r\na great leap in the dark has been taken from the known to the unknown.\r\nIt may be at once admitted that the _muscular force_ of animals and men,\r\nis merely the transformed energy derived from the primary forces of\r\nnature. So much has been, if not rigidly proved, yet rendered highly\r\nprobable, and it is in perfect accordance with all our knowledge of\r\nnatural forces and natural laws. But it cannot be contended that the\r\nphysiological balance-sheet has ever been so accurately struck, that we\r\nare entitled to say, not one-thousandth part of a grain more of force\r\nhas been exerted by any organized body or in any part of it, than has\r\nbeen derived from the known primary forces of the material world. If\r\nthat were so, it would absolutely negative the existence of will; for if\r\nwill is anything, it is a power that _directs_ the action of the forces\r\nstored up in the body, and it is not conceivable that this _direction_\r\ncan take place, without the exercise of some force in some part of the\r\norganism. However delicately a machine may be constructed, with the most\r\nexquisitely contrived detents to release a weight or spring by the\r\nexertion of the smallest possible amount of force, _some_ external force\r\nwill always, be required; so, in the animal machine, however minute may\r\nbe the changes required in the cells or fibres of the brain, to set in\r\nmotion the nerve currents which loosen or excite the pent up forces of\r\ncertain muscles, _some force_ must be required to effect those changes.\r\nIf it is said, \"those changes are automatic, and are set in motion by\r\nexternal causes,\" then one essential part of our consciousness, a\r\ncertain amount of freedom in willing, is annihilated; and it is\r\ninconceivable how or why there should have arisen any consciousness or\r\nany apparent will, in such purely automatic organisms. If this were so,\r\nour apparent WILL would be a delusion, and Professor Huxley's\r\nbelief--\"that our volition counts for something as a condition of the\r\ncourse of events,\" would be fallacious, since our volition would then be\r\nbut one link in the chain of events, counting for neither more nor less\r\nthan any other link whatever.\r\n\r\nIf, therefore, we have traced one force, however minute, to an origin in\r\nour own WILL, while we have no knowledge of any other primary cause of\r\nforce, it does not seem an improbable conclusion that all force may be\r\nwill-force; and thus, that the whole universe, is not merely dependent\r\non, but actually _is_, the WILL of higher intelligences or of one\r\nSupreme Intelligence. It has been often said that the true poet is a\r\nseer; and in the noble verse of an American poetess, we find expressed,\r\nwhat may prove to be the highest fact of science, the noblest truth of\r\nphilosophy:\r\n\r\n    God of the Granite and the Rose!\r\n      Soul of the Sparrow and the Bee!\r\n    The mighty tide of Being flows\r\n      Through countless channels, Lord, from thee.\r\n    It leaps to life in grass and flowers,\r\n      Through every grade of being runs,\r\n    While from Creation's radiant towers\r\n      Its glory flames in Stars and Suns.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Conclusion._\r\n\r\nThese speculations are usually held to be far beyond the bounds of\r\nscience; but they appear to me to be more legitimate deductions from the\r\nfacts of science, than those which consist in reducing the whole\r\nuniverse, not merely to matter, but to matter conceived and defined so\r\nas to be philosophically inconceivable. It is surely a great step in\r\nadvance, to get rid of the notion that _matter_ is a thing of itself,\r\nwhich can exist _per se_, and must have been eternal, since it is\r\nsupposed to be indestructible and uncreated,--that force, or the forces\r\nof nature, are another thing, given or added to matter, or else its\r\nnecessary properties,--and that mind is yet another thing, either a\r\nproduct of this matter and its supposed inherent forces, or distinct\r\nfrom and co-existent with it;--and to be able to substitute for this\r\ncomplicated theory, which leads to endless dilemmas and contradictions,\r\nthe far simpler and more consistent belief, that matter, as an entity\r\ndistinct from force, does not exist; and that FORCE is a product of\r\nMIND. Philosophy had long demonstrated our incapacity to prove the\r\nexistence of matter, as usually conceived; while it admitted the\r\ndemonstration to each of us of our own self-conscious, ideal existence.\r\nScience has now worked its way up to the same result, and this agreement\r\nbetween them should give us some confidence in their combined teaching.\r\n\r\nThe view we have now arrived at seems to me more grand and sublime, as\r\nwell as far simpler, than any other. It exhibits the universe, as a\r\nuniverse of intelligence and will-power; and by enabling us to rid\r\nourselves of the impossibility of thinking of mind, but as connected\r\nwith our old notions of matter, opens up infinite possibilities of\r\nexistence, connected with infinitely varied manifestations of force,\r\ntotally distinct from, yet as real as, what we term matter.\r\n\r\nThe grand law of continuity which we see pervading our universe, would\r\nlead us to infer infinite gradations of existence, and to people all\r\nspace with intelligence and will-power; and, if so, we have no\r\ndifficulty in believing that for so noble a purpose as the progressive\r\ndevelopment of higher and higher intelligences, those primal and general\r\nwill-forces, which have sufficed for the production of the lower\r\nanimals, should have been guided into new channels and made to converge\r\nin definite directions. And if, as seems to me probable, this has been\r\ndone, I cannot admit that it in any degree affects the truth or\r\ngenerality of Mr. Darwin's great discovery. It merely shows, that the\r\nlaws of organic development have been occasionally used for a special\r\nend, just as man uses them for his special ends; and, I do not see that\r\nthe law of \"natural selection\" can be said to be disproved, if it can be\r\nshown that man does not owe his entire physical and mental development\r\nto its unaided action, any more than it is disproved by the existence of\r\nthe poodle or the pouter pigeon, the production of which may have been\r\nequally beyond its undirected power.\r\n\r\nThe objections which in this essay I have taken, to the view,--that the\r\nsame law which appears to have sufficed for the development of animals,\r\nhas been alone the cause of man's superior physical and mental\r\nnature,--will, I have no doubt, be over-ruled and explained away. But I\r\nventure to think they will nevertheless maintain their ground, and that\r\nthey can only be met by the discovery of new facts or new laws, of a\r\nnature very different from any yet known to us. I can only hope that my\r\ntreatment of the subject, though necessarily very meagre, has been clear\r\nand intelligible; and that it may prove suggestive, both to the\r\nopponents and to the upholders of the theory of Natural Selection.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNOTES.\r\n\r\n\r\n_NOTE A._ (_Page_ 360.)\r\n\r\nSome of my critics seem quite to have misunderstood my meaning in this\r\npart of the argument. They have accused me of unnecessarily and\r\nunphilosophically appealing to \"first causes\" in order to get over a\r\ndifficulty--of believing that \"our brains are made by God and our lungs\r\nby natural selection;\" and that, in point of fact, \"man is God's\r\ndomestic animal.\" An eminent French critic, M. Claparède, makes me\r\ncontinually call in the aid of--\"_une Force supérieure_,\" the capital F,\r\nmeaning I imagine that this \"higher Force\" is the Deity. I can only\r\nexplain this misconception by the incapacity of the modern cultivated\r\nmind to realise the existence of any higher intelligence between itself\r\nand Deity. Angels and archangels, spirits and demons, have been so long\r\nbanished from our belief as to have become actually unthinkable as\r\nactual existences, and nothing in modern philosophy takes their place.\r\nYet the grand law of \"continuity,\" the last outcome of modern science,\r\nwhich seems absolute throughout the realms of matter, force, and mind,\r\nso far as we can explore them, cannot surely fail to be true beyond the\r\nnarrow sphere of our vision, and leave an infinite chasm between man and\r\nthe Great Mind of the universe. Such a supposition seems to me in the\r\nhighest degree improbable.\r\n\r\nNow, in referring to the origin of man, and its possible determining\r\ncauses, I have used the words \"some other power\"--\"some intelligent\r\npower\"--\"a superior intelligence\"--\"a controlling intelligence,\" and\r\nonly in reference to the origin of universal forces and laws have I\r\nspoken of the will or power of \"one Supreme Intelligence.\" These are the\r\nonly expressions I have used in alluding to the power which I believe\r\nhas acted in the case of man, and they were purposely chosen to show,\r\nthat I reject the hypothesis of \"first causes\" for any and every\r\n_special_ effect in the universe, except in the same sense that the\r\naction of man or of any other intelligent being is a first cause. In\r\nusing such terms I wished to show plainly, that I contemplated the\r\npossibility that the development of the essentially human portions of\r\nman's structure and intellect may have been determined by the directing\r\ninfluence of some higher intelligent beings, acting through natural and\r\nuniversal laws. A belief of this nature may or may not have a\r\nfoundation, but it is an intelligible theory, and is not, _in its\r\nnature_, incapable of proof; and it rests on facts and arguments of an\r\nexactly similar kind to those, which would enable a sufficiently\r\npowerful intellect to deduce, from the existence on the earth of\r\ncultivated plants and domestic animals, the presence of some intelligent\r\nbeing of a higher nature than themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n_NOTE B._ (_Page_ 365.)\r\n\r\nA friend has suggested that I have not here explained myself\r\nsufficiently, and objects, that _life_ does not exist in matter any more\r\nthan _consciousness_, and if the one can be produced by the laws of\r\nmatter, why may not the other? I reply, that there is a radical\r\ndifference between the two. Organic or vegetative life consists\r\nessentially in chemical transformations and molecular motions, occurring\r\nunder certain conditions and in a certain order. The matter, and the\r\nforces which act upon it, are for the most part known; and if there are\r\nany forces engaged in the manifestation of vegetative life yet\r\nundiscovered (which is a moot question), we can conceive them as\r\nanalogous to such forces as heat, electricity, or chemical affinity,\r\nwith which we are already acquainted. We can thus clearly _conceive_ of\r\nthe transition from dead matter to living matter. A complex mass which\r\nsuffers decomposition or decay is dead, but if this mass has the power\r\nof attracting to itself, from the surrounding medium, matter like that\r\nof which it is composed, we have the first rudiment of vegetative life.\r\nIf the mass can do this for a considerable time, and if its absorption\r\nof new matter more than replaces that lost by decomposition, and if it\r\nis of such a nature as to resist the mechanical or chemical forces to\r\nwhich it is usually exposed, and to retain a tolerably constant form, we\r\nterm it a living organism. We can _conceive_ an organism to be so\r\nconstituted, and we can further conceive that any fragments, which may\r\nbe accidentally broken from it, or which may fall away when its bulk has\r\nbecome too great for the cohesion of all its parts, may begin to\r\nincrease anew and run the same course as the parent mass. This is growth\r\nand reproduction in their simplest forms; and from such a simple\r\nbeginning it is possible to conceive a series of slight modifications of\r\ncomposition, and of internal and external forces, which should\r\nultimately lead to the development of more complex organisms. The LIFE\r\nof such an organism may, perhaps, be nothing added to it, but merely the\r\nname we give to the result of a balance of internal and external forces\r\nin maintaining the permanence of the form and structure of the\r\nindividual. The simplest conceivable form of such life would be the\r\ndewdrop, which owes its existence to the balance between the\r\ncondensation of aqueous vapour in the atmosphere and the evaporation of\r\nits substance. If either is in excess, it soon ceases to maintain an\r\nindividual existence. I do not maintain that vegetative life _is_ wholly\r\ndue to such a complex balance of forces, but only that it is\r\n_conceivable_ as such.\r\n\r\nWith CONSCIOUSNESS the case is very different. Its phenomena are not\r\ncomparable with those of any kind of _matter_ subjected to any of the\r\nknown or conceivable _forces_ of nature; and we cannot _conceive_ a\r\ngradual transition from absolute unconsciousness to consciousness, from\r\nan unsentient organism to a sentient being. The merest rudiment of\r\nsensation or self-consciousness is infinitely removed from absolutely\r\nnon-sentient or unconscious matter. We can conceive of no physical\r\naddition to, or modification of, an unconscious mass which should create\r\nconsciousness; no step in the series of changes organised matter may\r\nundergo, which should bring in sensation where there was no sensation\r\nor power of sensation at the preceding step. It is because the things\r\nare utterly incomparable and incommensurable that we can only conceive\r\nof _sensation_ coming to matter from without, while _life_ may be\r\nconceived as merely a specific combination and co-ordination of the\r\nmatter and the forces that compose the universe, and with which we are\r\nseparately acquainted. We may admit with Professor Huxley that\r\n_protoplasm_ is the \"matter of life\" and the cause of organisation, but\r\nwe cannot admit or conceive that _protoplasm_ is the primary source of\r\nsensation and consciousness, or that it can ever of itself become\r\n_conscious_ in the same way as we may perhaps conceive that it may\r\nbecome _alive_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _ABRAXAS grossulariata_, 119.\r\n\r\n  _Acanthotritus dorsalis_, 94.\r\n\r\n  _Accipiter pileatus_, 107.\r\n\r\n  ACRÆIDÆ, the subjects of mimicry, 85, 86.\r\n\r\n  _Acronycta psi_, protective colouring of, 62.\r\n\r\n  ADAPTATION brought about by general laws, 276;\r\n    looks like design, 281.\r\n\r\n  ÆGERIIDÆ mimic Hymenoptera, 90.\r\n\r\n  AGASSIZ, or embryonic character of ancient animals, 301.\r\n\r\n  _Agnia fasciata_, mimics another Longicorn, 95.\r\n\r\n  _Agriopis aprilina_, protective colouring of, 62.\r\n\r\n  ALCEDINIDÆ, sexual colouring and nidification of, 240.\r\n\r\n  AMADINA, sexual colouring and nidification of, 243.\r\n\r\n  AMPELIDÆ, sexual colouring and nidification of, 243.\r\n\r\n  ANCYLOTHERIUM, 300.\r\n\r\n  ANDRENIDÆ, 98.\r\n\r\n  _Angræcum sesquipedale_, 272;\r\n    its fertilization by a large moth, 275.\r\n\r\n  ANIMALS, senses and faculties of, 127;\r\n    intellect of, compared with that of savages, 341.\r\n\r\n  ANISOCERINÆ, 92.\r\n\r\n  ANOA, 196.\r\n\r\n  ANOPLOTHERIUM, 299.\r\n\r\n  ANTHRIBIDÆ, mimicry of, 94;\r\n    dimorphism in, 155.\r\n\r\n  _Anthrocera filipendulæ_, 120.\r\n\r\n  ANTHROPOLOGISTS, wide difference of opinion among, as to origin of\r\n      human races, 304;\r\n    conflicting views of, harmonized, 321.\r\n\r\n  ANTIQUITY of man, 303, 322.\r\n\r\n  APATHUS, 98.\r\n\r\n  APPARENT exceptions to law of colour and nidification, 253.\r\n\r\n  AQUATIC BIRDS, why abundant, 32.\r\n\r\n  _Araschnia prorsa_, 154.\r\n\r\n  ARCHEGOSAURUS, 300.\r\n\r\n  ARCHÆOPTERYX, 300.\r\n\r\n  ARCHITECTURE of most nations derivative, 228;\r\n    Grecian, false in principle, 226.\r\n\r\n  ARCTIC animals, white colour of, 50, 51.\r\n\r\n  ARGYLL, Duke of, on colours of Woodcock, 53;\r\n    on mind in nature, 265;\r\n    criticism on Darwin's works, 269;\r\n    on humming birds 282;\r\n    on creation by birth, 287.\r\n\r\n  ASILUS, 97.\r\n\r\n  ASPECTS of nature as influencing man's development, 317.\r\n\r\n\r\n  BABIRUSA, 196.\r\n\r\n  BALANCE in nature, 42.\r\n\r\n  BARRINGTON, Hon.
