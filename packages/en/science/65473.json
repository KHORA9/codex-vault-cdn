BIOGRAPHICAL NOTE\r\n\r\n\r\nJonathan Swift, whose name stands unchallenged at the head of the list\r\nof English satirists, was born on Irish soil, for it was in Dublin on\r\nNovember 30, 1667, that he opened his eyes upon a career in which fortune\r\nand misfortune alternated in swift succession for seventy-eight years.\r\nBefore his birth his father died, and his youth was embittered by the\r\ngrudging provision made by an uncle for his education. Though a keen\r\nlover of history and poetry, he held in high disdain the ordinary study\r\nroutine and the various regulations which govern institutions, obtaining\r\nhis degree from Trinity College in Ireland’s capital city only by grace\r\nof special indulgence.\r\n\r\nRestless and resentful and unhappy, when the Revolution of 1688 drove him\r\nforth from the Emerald Isle, he sought employment in England, and while\r\nsecretary to Sir William Temple, a statesman of no ordinary culture and\r\nability, qualified himself for the literary work which has made his name\r\nfamous for two centuries. Then wearying of dependence, he returned to\r\nIreland and resolved to enter the Church.\r\n\r\nAs prelate and later as politician his name never rang with the\r\npraise which early rewarded the efforts of his pen, for as a master\r\nof “humor, irony, and invective he has no superior.” His love affairs\r\nwere disastrous and reflect only discredit upon his manhood, but to\r\nthe strength of his passion for Esther Johnson, or “Stella,” whom it\r\nis contended that he secretly married but never acknowledged, and for\r\nVanessa—Miss Vanhomrigh—are due the great works that immortalized them.\r\n\r\n_The Tale of the Tub_ first betrayed his transcendent genius and\r\nirresistible wit, but the grave humor of all his other productions which\r\nwere not really serious in character, paled before the keen satire and\r\nludicrous exaggeration of _Gulliver’s Travels_. Its covert ridicule of\r\nrulers, courts, statesmen, and political organizations was so severe\r\nand cut so ruthlessly and cruelly deep, that only its diabolical\r\ncleverness prevented its suppression and instead lent it an unprecedented\r\npopularity. It is so true, so simple in expression, its searching irony\r\nso based on the frailties of human nature; it is so comic, and yet its\r\ntone so whimsically solemn, that it provides prodigious enjoyment for\r\nthousands who never catch a glimpse of—much less grasp—its inner meaning.\r\n\r\nBut the veiled significance is unmistakably there, for the voyage to\r\nLilliput is merely a revelation of the policy of the English court during\r\nthe reign of George I; the trip to Brobdingnag affords opportunity for\r\npicturing an ideal ruler and government; the journey to Laputa holds up\r\nto contumely the proceedings of the British Royal Society, while the\r\nvisit to the Houyhnhnms is a rabid satire against humanity.\r\n\r\nAnd after achievements which deservedly won the plaudits of the master\r\nbrains among his contemporaries, and continue to reflect on him lasting\r\nglory, this gifted man four years before his death on October 19,\r\n1745, sank into a condition of dementia. But though the powers of his\r\nmarvelous, eccentric mind weakened and finally failed, “his works do\r\nfollow him,” for he contributed to the world’s literature one of the most\r\ndelightful children’s books ever written, and his name echoes through\r\nhistory as the clerical exposer of human frailties in a manner to call\r\nforth only innocent mirth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA VOYAGE TO LILLIPUT\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n    THE AUTHOR GIVES SOME ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF AND FAMILY—HIS FIRST\r\n    INDUCEMENTS TO TRAVEL—HE IS SHIPWRECKED, AND SWIMS FOR HIS\r\n    LIFE—GETS SAFE ON SHORE IN THE COUNTRY OF LILLIPUT—IS MADE A\r\n    PRISONER, AND CARRIED UP THE COUNTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy father had a small estate in Nottinghamshire; I was the third of five\r\nsons. He sent me to Emanuel College in Cambridge, at fourteen years old,\r\nwhere I resided three years, and applied myself close to my studies; but\r\nthe charge of maintaining me, although I had a very scanty allowance,\r\nbeing too great for a narrow fortune, I was bound apprentice to Mr. James\r\nBates, an eminent surgeon in London, with whom I continued four years;\r\nand my father now and then sending me small sums of money, I laid them\r\nout in learning navigation, and other parts of the mathematics, useful\r\nto those who intend to travel, as I always believed it would be, some\r\ntime or other, my fortune to do. When I left Mr. Bates, I went down to my\r\nfather; where, by the assistance of him and my uncle John, and some other\r\nrelations, I got forty pounds, and a promise of thirty pounds a year to\r\nmaintain me at Leyden; there I studied physic two years and seven months,\r\nknowing it would be useful in long voyages.\r\n\r\nSoon after my return from Leyden, I was recommended by my good master,\r\nMr. Bates, to be surgeon to the Swallow, Captain Abraham Pannell,\r\ncommander; with whom I continued three years and a half, making a voyage\r\nor two into the Levant, and some other parts. When I came back I resolved\r\nto settle in London; to which Mr. Bates, my master, encouraged me, and\r\nby him I was recommended to several patients. I took part of a small\r\nhouse in the Old-Jury; and being advised to alter my condition, I married\r\nMistress Mary Burton, second daughter to Mr. Edmund Burton, hosier, in\r\nNewgate Street, with whom I received four hundred pounds for a portion.\r\n\r\nBut my good master Bates dying two years after, and I having few\r\nfriends, my business began to fail; for my conscience would not suffer\r\nme to imitate the bad practice of too many among my brethren. Having,\r\ntherefore, consulted with my wife and some of my acquaintance, I\r\ndetermined to go again to sea. I was surgeon successively in two ships,\r\nand made several voyages, for six years, to the East and West Indies, by\r\nwhich I got some addition to my fortune. My hours of leisure I spent in\r\nreading the best authors, ancient and modern, being always provided with\r\na good number of books; and when I was ashore, in observing the manners\r\nand dispositions of the people, as well as learning their language,\r\nwherein I had a great facility, by the strength of my memory.\r\n\r\nThe last of these voyages not proving very fortunate, I grew weary of the\r\nsea, and intended to stay at home with my wife and family. I removed from\r\nthe Old-Jury to Fetter Lane, and from thence to Wapping, hoping to get\r\nbusiness among the sailors, but it would not turn to account. After three\r\nyears’ expectation that things would mend, I accepted an advantageous\r\noffer from Captain William Prichard, master of the Antelope, who was\r\nmaking a voyage to the South Sea. We set sail from Bristol, May 4, 1699,\r\nand our voyage at first was very prosperous.\r\n\r\nIt would not be proper, for some reasons, to trouble the reader with\r\nthe particulars of our adventures in those seas; let it suffice to\r\ninform him, that in our passage from thence to the East Indies, we were\r\ndriven by a violent storm to the northwest of Van Diemen’s Land. By an\r\nobservation, we found ourselves in the latitude of 30 degrees 2 minutes\r\nsouth. Twelve of our crew were dead by immoderate labor and ill food: the\r\nrest were in a very weak condition. On the 5th of November, which was\r\nthe beginning of summer in those parts, the weather being very hazy, the\r\nseamen spied a rock within half a cable’s length of the ship, but the\r\nwind was so strong that we were driven directly upon it, and immediately\r\nsplit. Six of the crew, of whom I was one, having let down the boat into\r\nthe sea, made a shift to get clear of the ship and the rock. We rowed, by\r\nmy computation, about three leagues, till we were able to work no longer,\r\nbeing already spent with labor while we were in the ship. We therefore\r\ntrusted ourselves to the mercy of the waves, and in about half an hour\r\nthe boat was overset by a sudden flurry from the north. What became of my\r\ncompanions in the boat, as well as of those who escaped on the rock, or\r\nwere left in the vessel, I cannot tell, but conclude they were all lost.\r\nFor my own part, I swam as fortune directed me, and was pushed forward\r\nby wind and tide. I often let my legs drop, and could feel no bottom,\r\nbut when I was almost gone, and able to struggle no longer, I found\r\nmyself within my depth; and by this time the storm was much abated. The\r\ndeclivity was so small, that I walked near a mile before I got to the\r\nshore, which I conjectured was about eight o’clock in the evening. I then\r\nadvanced forward near half a mile, but could not discover any sign of\r\nhouses or inhabitants; at least I was in so weak a condition that I did\r\nnot observe them. I was extremely tired, and with that, and the heat of\r\nthe weather, and about half a pint of brandy that I drank as I left the\r\nship, I found myself much inclined to sleep. I lay down on the grass,\r\nwhich was very short and soft, where I slept sounder than ever I remember\r\nto have done in my life, and, as I reckoned, about nine hours; for when I\r\nawakened, it was just daylight. I attempted to rise, but was not able to\r\nstir; for, as I happened to lie on my back, I found my arms and legs were\r\nstrongly fastened on each side to the ground; and my hair, which was long\r\nand thick, tied down in the same manner. I likewise felt several slender\r\nligatures across my body, from my arm-pits to my thighs. I could only\r\nlook upwards; the sun began to grow hot, and the light offended my eyes.\r\nI heard a confused noise about me; but in the posture I lay, could see\r\nnothing except the sky. In a little time, I felt something alive moving\r\non my left leg, which advancing gently forward over my breast, came\r\nalmost up to my chin; when, bending my eyes downwards as much as I could,\r\nI perceived it to be a human creature not six inches high, with a bow and\r\nan arrow in his hands and a quiver at his back. In the meantime I felt at\r\nleast forty more of the same kind (as I conjectured) following the first.\r\nI was in the utmost astonishment, and roared so loud that they all ran\r\nback in a fright, and some of them, as I was afterwards told, were hurt\r\nby the falls they got by leaping from my sides upon the ground. However,\r\nthey soon returned, and one of them who ventured so far as to get a full\r\nsight of my face, lifting up his hands and eyes by way of admiration,\r\ncried out in a shrill but distinct voice, _Hekinah degul!_ The others\r\nrepeated the same words several times, but I then knew not what it meant.\r\nI lay all this while, as the reader may believe, in great uneasiness; at\r\nlength, struggling to get loose, I had the fortune to break the strings,\r\nand wrench out the pegs that fastened my left arm to the ground, for, by\r\nlifting it up to my face, I discovered the methods they had taken to bind\r\nme, and at the same time with a violent pull, which gave me excessive\r\npain, I a little loosened the strings that tied down my hair on the left\r\nside, so that I was just able to turn my head about two inches. But the\r\ncreatures ran off a second time, before I could seize them; whereupon\r\nthere was a great shout in a very shrill accent, and after it had ceased\r\nI heard one of them cry aloud, _Tolgo phonac_; when in an instant I felt\r\nabove a hundred arrows discharged on my left hand, which pricked me like\r\nso many needles; and besides they shot another flight into the air, as\r\nwe do bombs in Europe, whereof many, I suppose, fell on my body (though\r\nI felt them not) and some on my face, which I immediately covered with\r\nmy left hand. When this shower of arrows was over, I fell a-groaning with\r\ngrief and pain, and then striving again to get loose, they discharged\r\nanother volley larger than the first, and some of them attempted with\r\nspears to stick me in the sides; but by good luck I had on me a buff\r\njerkin, which they could not pierce. I thought it the most prudent method\r\nto lie still, and my design was to continue so till night, when, my left\r\nhand being already loose, I could easily free myself: and as for the\r\ninhabitants, I had reason to believe I might be a match for the greatest\r\narmy they could bring against me, if they were all of the same size with\r\nhim that I saw. But fortune disposed otherwise of me. When the people\r\nobserved I was quiet, they discharged no more arrows; but, by the noise I\r\nheard, I knew their numbers increased; and about four yards from me, over\r\nagainst my right ear, I heard a knocking for above an hour, like that of\r\npeople at work; when turning my head that way, as well as the pegs and\r\nstrings would permit me, I saw a stage erected about a foot and a half\r\nfrom the ground, capable of holding four of the inhabitants, with two or\r\nthree ladders to mount it: whence one of them, who seemed to be a person\r\nof quality, made me a long speech, whereof I understood not a syllable.\r\nBut I should have mentioned, that before the principal person began his\r\noration, he cried out three times, _Langro dehul san_ (these words and\r\nthe former were afterwards repeated and explained to me). Whereupon,\r\nimmediately about fifty of the inhabitants came and cut the string that\r\nfastened the left side of my head, which gave me the liberty of turning\r\nit to the right, and of observing the person and gesture of him that was\r\nto speak. He appeared to be of middle age, and taller than any of the\r\nother three who attended him, whereof one was a page that held up his\r\ntrain, and seemed to be somewhat longer than my middle finger; the other\r\ntwo stood one on each side to support him. He acted every part of an\r\norator, and I could observe many periods of threatenings, and others of\r\npromises, pity, and kindness. I answered in a few words, but in the most\r\nsubmissive manner, lifting up my left hand and both my eyes to the sun,\r\nas calling him for a witness; and being almost famished with hunger, not\r\nhaving eaten a morsel for some hours before I left the ship, I found the\r\ndemands of nature so strong upon me that I could not forbear showing my\r\nimpatience (perhaps against the strict rules of decency), by putting my\r\nfinger frequently to my mouth, to signify that I wanted food. The _hurgo_\r\n(for so they call a great lord, as I afterwards learned) understood\r\nme very well. He descended from the stage, and commanded that several\r\nladders should be applied to my sides, on which about a hundred of the\r\ninhabitants mounted, and walked towards my mouth, laden with baskets full\r\nof meat, which had been provided and sent thither by the king’s orders,\r\nupon the first intelligence he received of me. I observed there was the\r\nflesh of several animals, but could not distinguish them by the taste.\r\nThere were shoulders, legs and loins, shaped like those of mutton, and\r\nvery well dressed, but smaller than the wings of a lark. I ate them by\r\ntwo or three at a mouthful, and took three loaves at a time about the\r\nbigness of musketballs. They supplied me as fast as they could, showing a\r\nthousand marks of wonder and astonishment at my bulk and appetite.\r\n\r\nI then made another sign that I wanted drink. They found by my eating\r\nthat a small quantity would not suffice me; and being a most ingenious\r\npeople, they slung up, with great dexterity, one of their largest\r\nhogsheads, then rolled it towards my hand, and beat out the top; I drank\r\nit off at a draught, which I might well do, for it did not hold half a\r\npint, and tasted like a small wine of Burgundy, but much more delicious.\r\nThey brought me a second hogshead, which I drank in the same manner, and\r\nmade signs for more: but they had none to give me. When I had performed\r\nthese wonders they shouted for joy, and danced upon my breast, repeating\r\nseveral times as they did at first, _Hekinah degul_. They made me a sign\r\nthat I should throw down the two hogsheads, but first warned the people\r\nbelow to stand out of the way, crying aloud, _Borach mevola_: and when\r\nthey saw the vessels in the air there was a universal shout of _Hekinah\r\ndegul_. I confess I was often tempted, while they were passing backwards\r\nand forwards on my body, to seize forty or fifty of the first that came\r\nin my reach and dash them against the ground. But the remembrance of what\r\nI had felt, which probably might not be the worst they could do, and\r\nthe promise of honor I made to them—for so I interpreted my submissive\r\nbehavior—soon drove out these imaginations. Besides, I now considered\r\nmyself as bound by the laws of hospitality to a people who had treated me\r\nwith so much expense and magnificence. However, in my thoughts I could\r\nnot sufficiently wonder at the intrepidity of these diminutive mortals,\r\nwho durst venture to mount and walk upon my body while one of my hands\r\nwas at liberty, without trembling at the very sight of so prodigious a\r\ncreature as I must appear to them. After some time, when they observed\r\nthat I made no more demands for meat, there appeared before me a person\r\nof high rank from his imperial majesty. His excellency, having mounted\r\non the small of my right leg, advanced forwards up to my face, with\r\nabout a dozen of his retinue, and producing his credentials under the\r\nsignet royal, which he applied close to my eyes, spoke about ten minutes\r\nwithout any signs of anger, but with a kind of determinate resolution:\r\noften pointing forwards, which, as I afterwards found, was towards the\r\ncapital city, about half a mile distant, whither it was agreed by his\r\nmajesty in council that I must be conveyed. I answered in few words, but\r\nto no purpose, and made a sign with my hand that was loose, putting it to\r\nthe other (but over his excellency’s head for fear of hurting him or his\r\ntrain), and then to my own head and body, to signify that I desired my\r\nliberty. It appeared that he understood me well enough, for he shook his\r\nhead by way of disapprobation, and held his hands in a posture to show\r\nthat I must be carried as a prisoner. However, he made other signs, to\r\nlet me understand that I should have meat and drink enough, and very good\r\ntreatment. Whereupon I once more thought of attempting to break my bonds;\r\nbut again, when I felt the smart of their arrows upon my face and hands,\r\nwhich were all in blisters, and many of the darts still sticking in them,\r\nand observing likewise that the number of my enemies increased, I gave\r\ntokens to let them know that they might do with me what they pleased.\r\nUpon this the _hurgo_ and his train withdrew, with much civility and\r\ncheerful countenances. Soon after I heard a general shout, with frequent\r\nrepetitions of the words, _peplom selan_; and I felt great numbers of\r\npeople on my left side relaxing the cords to such a degree that I was\r\nable to turn upon my right. But, before this, they had daubed my face\r\nand both my hands with a sort of ointment, very pleasant to the smell,\r\nwhich in a few minutes removed all the smart of their arrows. These\r\ncircumstances, added to the refreshment I had received by their victuals\r\nand drink, which were very nourishing, disposed me to sleep. I slept\r\nabout eight hours, as I was afterwards assured; and it was no wonder, for\r\nthe physicians, by the emperor’s order, had mingled a sleepy potion in\r\nthe hogsheads of wine.\r\n\r\nIt seems that upon the first moment I was discovered sleeping on the\r\nground, after my landing, the emperor had early notice of it by an\r\nexpress; and determined in council that I should be tied in the manner I\r\nhave related (which was done in the night while I slept), that plenty of\r\nmeat and drink should be sent me, and a machine prepared to carry me to\r\nthe capital city.\r\n\r\nThis resolution perhaps may appear very bold and dangerous, and I am\r\nconfident would not be imitated by any prince in Europe on the like\r\noccasion. However, in my opinion, it was extremely prudent, as well as\r\ngenerous; for supposing these people had endeavored to kill me with their\r\nspears and arrows while I was asleep, I should certainly have awaked with\r\nthe first sense of smart, which might have so far aroused my rage and\r\nstrength as to have enabled me to break the strings wherewith I was tied;\r\nafter which, as they were not able to make resistance, so they could\r\nexpect no mercy.\r\n\r\nThese people are most excellent mathematicians, and arrived to a great\r\nperfection in mechanics by the countenance and encouragement of the\r\nemperor, who is a renowned patron of learning. This prince has several\r\nmachines fixed on wheels for the carriage of trees and other great\r\nweights. He often builds his largest men of war, whereof some are nine\r\nfeet long, in the woods where the timber grows, and has them carried\r\non these engines three or four hundred yards to the sea. Five hundred\r\ncarpenters and engineers were immediately set at work to prepare the\r\ngreatest engine they had. It was a frame of wood raised three inches from\r\nthe ground, about seven feet long and four wide, moving upon twenty-two\r\nwheels. The shout I heard was upon the arrival of this engine, which, it\r\nseems, set out in four hours after my landing. It was brought parallel\r\nto me as I lay. But the principal difficulty was to raise and place me\r\nin this vehicle. Eighty poles, each one foot high, were erected for\r\nthis purpose, and very strong cords, of the bigness of packthread, were\r\nfastened by hooks to many bandages, which the workmen had girt round\r\nmy neck, my hands, my body, and my legs. Nine hundred of the strongest\r\nmen were employed to draw up these cords by many pulleys fastened on\r\nthe poles; and thus, in less than three hours, I was raised and slung\r\ninto the engine, and there tied fast. All this I was told; for while the\r\noperation was performing I lay in a profound sleep, by the force of that\r\nsoporiferous medicine infused into my liquor. Fifteen hundred of the\r\nemperor’s largest horses, each about four inches and a half high, were\r\nemployed to draw me towards the metropolis, which, as I said, was half a\r\nmile distant.\r\n\r\nAbout four hours after we began our journey I awaked by a very ridiculous\r\naccident; for the carriage being stopped awhile, to adjust something that\r\nwas out of order, two or three of the young natives had the curiosity to\r\nsee how I looked when I was asleep; they climbed up into the engine, and,\r\nadvancing very softly to my face, one of them, an officer in the guards,\r\nput the sharp end of his half-pike a good way up into my left nostril,\r\nwhich tickled my nose like a straw, and made me sneeze violently;\r\nwhereupon they stole off unperceived, and it was three weeks before\r\nI knew the cause of my awaking so suddenly. We made a long march the\r\nremaining part of that day, and rested at night with five hundred guards\r\non each side of me, half with torches, and half with bows and arrows,\r\nready to shoot me if I should offer to stir. The next morning at sunrise\r\nwe continued our march, and arrived within two hundred yards of the city\r\ngates about noon. The emperor and all his court came out to meet us; but\r\nhis great officers would by no means suffer his majesty to endanger his\r\nperson by mounting on my body.\r\n\r\nAt the place where the carriage stopped there stood an ancient temple,\r\nesteemed to be the largest in the whole kingdom, which, having been\r\npolluted some years before by an unnatural murder, was, according to\r\nthe zeal of those people looked upon as profane, and therefore had been\r\napplied to common uses, and all the ornaments and furniture carried\r\naway. In this edifice it was determined I should lodge. The great gate\r\nfronting to the north was about four feet high and almost two feet wide,\r\nthrough which I could easily creep. On each side of the gate was a small\r\nwindow, not above six inches from the ground; into that on the left side\r\nthe king’s smiths conveyed fourscore and eleven chains, like those that\r\nhang to a lady’s watch in Europe, and almost as large, which were locked\r\nto my left leg with six-and-thirty padlocks. Over against this temple,\r\non the other side of the great highway, at twenty feet distance, there\r\nwas a turret at least five feet high. Here the emperor ascended, with\r\nmany principal lords of his court, to have an opportunity of viewing me,\r\nas I was told, for I could not see them. It was reckoned that above a\r\nhundred thousand inhabitants came out of the town upon the same errand;\r\nand, in spite of my guards, I believe there could not be fewer than ten\r\nthousand, at several times, who mounted my body, by the help of ladders.\r\nBut a proclamation was soon issued to forbid it upon pain of death. When\r\nthe workmen found it was impossible for me to break loose they cut all\r\nthe strings that bound me; whereupon I rose up, with as melancholy a\r\ndisposition as ever I had in my life. But the noise and astonishment of\r\nthe people at seeing me rise and walk are not to be expressed. The chains\r\nthat held my left leg were about two yards long, and gave me not only\r\nthe liberty of walking backwards and forwards in a semicircle, but being\r\nfixed within four inches of the gate, allowed me to creep in and lie at\r\nmy full length in the temple.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n    THE EMPEROR OF LILLIPUT, ATTENDED BY SEVERAL OF THE NOBILITY,\r\n    COMES TO SEE THE AUTHOR IN HIS CONFINEMENT—THE EMPEROR’S PERSON\r\n    AND HABITS DESCRIBED—LEARNED MEN APPOINTED TO TEACH THE AUTHOR\r\n    THEIR LANGUAGE—HE GAINS FAVOR BY HIS MILD DISPOSITION—HIS\r\n    POCKETS ARE SEARCHED, AND HIS SWORD AND PISTOLS TAKEN FROM HIM.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen I found myself on my feet I looked about me, and must confess I\r\nnever beheld a more entertaining prospect. The country around appeared\r\nlike a continued garden, and the inclosed fields, which were generally\r\nforty feet square, resembled so many beds of flowers. These fields were\r\nintermingled with woods of half a stang, and the tallest trees, as I\r\ncould judge, appeared to be seven feet high. I viewed the town on my left\r\nhand, which looked like the painted scene of a city in a theater.\r\n\r\nThe emperor was already descended from the tower and advancing on\r\nhorseback towards me, which had like to have cost him dear; for the\r\nbeast, though very well trained, yet wholly unused to such a sight, which\r\nappeared as if a mountain moved before him, reared up on his hindfeet;\r\nbut that prince, who is an excellent horseman, kept his seat, till his\r\nattendants ran in and held the bridle, while his majesty had time to\r\ndismount. When he alighted he surveyed me round with great admiration;\r\nbut kept without the length of my chain. He ordered his cooks and\r\nbutlers, who were already prepared, to give me victuals and drink, which\r\nthey pushed forward in a sort of vehicles upon wheels till I could reach\r\nthem, I took these vehicles and soon emptied them all; twenty of them\r\nwere filled with meat, and ten with liquor; each of the former afforded\r\nme two or three good mouthfuls; and I emptied the liquor of ten vessels,\r\nwhich was contained in earthen vials, into one vehicle, drinking it off\r\nat a draught; and so I did with the rest. The empress and young princes\r\nof the blood of both sexes, attended by many ladies, sat at some distance\r\nin their chairs; but, upon the accident that happened to the emperor’s\r\nhorse, they alighted, and came near his person, which I am now going to\r\ndescribe. He is taller by almost the breadth of my nail, than any of\r\nhis court, which alone is enough to strike an awe into the beholders.\r\nHis features are strong and masculine, with an Austrian lip and arched\r\nnose, his complexion olive, his countenance erect, his body and limbs\r\nwell proportioned, all his motions graceful and his deportment majestic.\r\nHe was then past his prime, being twenty-eight years and three-quarters\r\nold, of which he had reigned about seven in great felicity and generally\r\nvictorious. For the better convenience of beholding him I lay on my side,\r\nso that my face was parallel to his, and he stood but three yards off;\r\nhowever, I have had him since many times in my hand, and therefore cannot\r\nbe deceived in the description. His dress was very plain and simple,\r\nand the fashion of it between the Asiatic and the European; but he had\r\non his head a light helmet of gold, adorned with jewels, and a plume\r\non the crest. He held his sword drawn in his hand to defend himself,\r\nif I should happen to break loose: it was almost three inches long;\r\nthe hilt and scabbard were gold enriched with diamonds. His voice was\r\nshrill, but very clear and articulate, and I could distinctly hear it\r\nwhen I stood up. The ladies and courtiers were all most magnificently\r\nclad, so that the spot they stood upon seemed to resemble a petticoat\r\nspread on the ground, embroidered with figures of gold and silver. His\r\nimperial majesty spoke often to me, and I returned answers, but neither\r\nof us could understand a syllable. There were several of his priests and\r\nlawyers present (as I conjectured by their habits), who were commanded\r\nto address themselves to me, and I spoke to them in as many languages\r\nas I had the least smattering of, which were High and Low Dutch, Latin,\r\nFrench, Spanish, Italian, and Lingua Franca; but all to no purpose. After\r\nabout two hours the court retired, and I was left with a strong guard to\r\nprevent the impertinence, and probably the malice of the rabble, who were\r\nvery impatient to crowd about me as near as they durst; and some of them\r\nhad the impudence to shoot their arrows at me as I sat on the ground by\r\nthe door of my house, whereof one very narrowly missed my left eye. But\r\nthe colonel ordered six of the ringleaders to be seized, and thought no\r\npunishment so proper as to deliver them bound into my hands; which some\r\nof his soldiers accordingly did, pushing them forwards with the butt-ends\r\nof their pikes into my reach. I took them all in my right hand, put five\r\nof them into my coat pocket, and as to the sixth, I made a countenance as\r\nif I would eat him alive. The poor man squalled terribly, and the colonel\r\nand his officers were in much pain, especially when they saw me take\r\nout my penknife; but I soon put them out of fear; for, looking mildly,\r\nand immediately cutting the strings he was bound with, I set him gently\r\non the ground and away he ran. I treated the rest in the same manner,\r\ntaking them one by one out of my pocket; and I observed both the soldiers\r\nand people were highly obliged at this mark of my clemency, which was\r\nrepresented very much to my advantage at court.\r\n\r\nTowards night I got with some difficulty into my house, where I lay on\r\nthe ground, and continued so to do about a fortnight; during which time\r\nthe emperor gave orders to have a bed prepared for me. Six hundred beds\r\nof the common measure were brought in carriages, and worked up in my\r\nhouse; a hundred and fifty of their beds, sewn together, made up the\r\nbreadth and length; and these were four double, which however kept me but\r\nvery indifferently from the hardness of the floor, that was of smooth\r\nstone. By the same computation they provided me with sheets, blankets,\r\nand coverlets, tolerable enough for one who had been so long inured to\r\nhardships as I.\r\n\r\nAs the news of my arrival spread through the kingdom it brought\r\nprodigious numbers of rich, idle, and curious people to see me; so\r\nthat the villages were almost emptied, and great neglect of tillage\r\nand household affairs must have ensued if his imperial majesty had\r\nnot provided by several proclamations and orders of state against\r\nthis inconveniency. He directed that those who had already beheld me\r\nshould return home and not presume to come within fifty yards of my\r\nhouse without license from court; whereby the secretaries of state got\r\nconsiderable fees.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the emperor held frequent councils to debate what course\r\nshould be taken with me; and I was afterwards assured by a particular\r\nfriend, a person of great quality, who was looked upon to be as much\r\nin the secret as any, that the court was under many difficulties\r\nconcerning me. They apprehended my breaking loose, that my diet would be\r\nvery expensive and might cause a famine. Sometimes they determined to\r\nstarve me, or at least to shoot me in the face and hands with poisoned\r\narrows which would soon dispatch me; but again they considered that the\r\nstench of so large a carcass might produce a plague in the metropolis\r\nand probably spread through the whole kingdom. In the midst of these\r\nconsultations several officers of the army went to the door of the great\r\ncouncil chamber and two of them being admitted, gave an account of my\r\nbehavior to the six criminals above mentioned; which made so favorable\r\nan impression in the breast of his majesty and the whole board in my\r\nbehalf that an imperial commission was issued out, obliging all the\r\nvillages nine hundred yards round the city, to deliver in every morning\r\nsix beeves, forty sheep, and other victuals for my sustenance; together\r\nwith a proportionable quantity of bread, and wine and other liquors;\r\nfor the due payment of which his majesty gave assignments upon his\r\ntreasury. For this prince lives chiefly upon his own demesnes, seldom\r\nexcept upon great occasions raising any subsidies upon his subjects,\r\nwho are bound to attend him in his wars at their own expense. An\r\nestablishment was also made of six hundred persons to be my domestics,\r\nwho had board-wages allowed for their maintenance and tents built for\r\nthem very conveniently on each side of my door. It was likewise ordered\r\nthat three hundred tailors should make me a suit of clothes after the\r\nfashion of the country; that six of his majesty’s greatest scholars\r\nshould be employed to instruct me in their language; and, lastly, that\r\nthe emperor’s horses, and those of the nobility and troops of guards,\r\nshould be frequently exercised in my sight, to accustom themselves to me.\r\nAll these orders were duly put in execution, and in about three weeks I\r\nmade a great progress in learning their language; during which time the\r\nemperor frequently honored me with his visits, and was pleased to assist\r\nmy masters in teaching me. We began already to converse together in some\r\nsort; and the first words I learned were to express my desire that he\r\nwould please to give me my liberty; which I every day repeated on my\r\nknees. His answer, as I could apprehend it, was that this must be a work\r\nof time, not to be thought on without the advice of his council, and\r\nthat first I must _lumos kelmin pesso desmar lon emposo_; that is, swear\r\na peace with him and his kingdom: however, that I should be used with\r\nall kindness, and he advised me to acquire, by my patience and discreet\r\nbehavior the good opinion of himself and his subjects. He desired I would\r\nnot take it ill if he gave orders to certain proper officers to search\r\nme; for probably I might carry about me several weapons, which must\r\nneeds be dangerous things, if they answered the bulk of so prodigious\r\na person. I said his majesty should be satisfied, for I was ready to\r\nstrip myself and turn up my pockets before him. This I delivered part in\r\nwords and part in signs. He replied that, by the laws of the kingdom I\r\nmust be searched by two of his officers; that he knew this could not be\r\ndone without my consent and assistance; that he had so good an opinion\r\nof my generosity and justice as to trust their persons in my hands; that\r\nwhatever they took from me should be returned when I left the country\r\nor paid for at the rate which I would set upon them. I took up the two\r\nofficers in my hands, put them first into my coat pockets and then into\r\nevery other pocket about me, except my two fobs, and another secret\r\npocket which I had no mind should be searched, wherein I had some little\r\nnecessaries that were of no consequence to any but myself. In one of\r\nmy fobs there was a silver watch and in the other a small quantity of\r\ngold in a purse. These gentlemen, having pen, ink, and paper about them,\r\nmade an exact inventory of everything they saw; and when they had done,\r\ndesired I would set them down, that they might deliver it to the emperor.\r\nThis inventory I afterwards translated into English, and is word for word\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n    “IMPRIMIS, In the right coat pocket of the great Man-mountain\r\n    (for so I interpret the words _quinbus flestrin_), after the\r\n    strictest search, we found only one great piece of coarse\r\n    cloth, large enough to be a foot-cloth for your majesty’s\r\n    chief room of state. In the left pocket we saw a huge silver\r\n    chest, with a cover of the same metal, which we the searchers\r\n    were not able to lift. We desired it should be opened, and one\r\n    of us stepping into it, found himself up to the mid-leg in a\r\n    sort of dust, some part whereof flying up to our faces, set us\r\n    both a-sneezing several times together. In his right waistcoat\r\n    pocket we found a prodigious bundle of white thin substances,\r\n    folded one over another, about the bigness of three men, tied\r\n    with a strong cable and marked with black figures; which we\r\n    humbly conceive to be writings, every letter almost half as\r\n    large as the palm of our hands. In the left there was a sort\r\n    of engine, from the back of which were extended twenty long\r\n    poles, resembling the palisadoes before your majesty’s court;\r\n    wherewith we conjecture the Man-mountain combs his head, for\r\n    we did not always trouble him with questions, because we found\r\n    it a great difficulty to make him understand us. In the large\r\n    pocket on the right side of his middle cover (so I translate\r\n    _ranfu-lo_, by which they meant my breeches), we saw a hollow\r\n    pillar of iron, about the length of a man, fastened to a strong\r\n    piece of timber larger than the pillar, and upon one side of\r\n    the pillar were huge pieces of iron sticking out, cut into\r\n    strange figures, which we know not what to make of. In the\r\n    left pocket another engine of the same kind. In the smaller\r\n    pocket on the right side, were several round flat pieces of\r\n    white and red metal, of different bulk; some of the white,\r\n    which seemed to be silver, were so large and heavy that my\r\n    comrade and I could hardly lift them. In the left pocket were\r\n    two black pillars irregularly shaped; we could not, without\r\n    difficulty, reach the top of them, as we stood at the bottom of\r\n    his pocket. One of them was covered and seemed all of a piece;\r\n    but at the upper end of the other there appeared a white round\r\n    substance, about twice the bigness of our heads. Within each\r\n    of these was inclosed a prodigious plate of steel; which, by\r\n    our orders, we obliged him to show us, because we apprehended\r\n    they might be dangerous engines. He took them out of their\r\n    cases, and told us that in his own country his practice was to\r\n    shave his beard with one of these and to cut his meat with the\r\n    other. There were two pockets which we could not enter; these\r\n    he called his fobs; they were two large slits cut into the top\r\n    of his middle cover, but squeezed close by the pressure of his\r\n    belly. Out of the right fob hung a great silver chain, with\r\n    a wonderful kind of engine at the bottom. We directed him to\r\n    draw out whatever was fastened to that chain, which appeared to\r\n    be a globe, half silver, and half of some transparent metal;\r\n    for on the transparent side we saw certain strange figures\r\n    circularly drawn, and thought we could touch them till we\r\n    found our fingers stopped by that lucid substance. He put his\r\n    engine to our ears, which made an incessant noise, like that\r\n    of a watermill; and we conjecture it is either some unknown\r\n    animal or the god that he worships; but we are more inclined\r\n    to the latter opinion, because he assures us (if we understood\r\n    him right, for he expressed himself very imperfectly) that he\r\n    seldom did anything without consulting it. He called it his\r\n    oracle, and said it pointed out the time for every action of\r\n    his life. From the left fob he took out a net almost large\r\n    enough for a fisherman, but contrived to open and shut like a\r\n    purse, and which served him for the same use; we found therein\r\n    several massy pieces of yellow metal, which, if they be real\r\n    gold, must be of immense value.\r\n\r\n    “Having thus, in obedience to your majesty’s commands,\r\n    diligently searched all his pockets, we observed a girdle about\r\n    his waist, made of the hide of some prodigious animal, from\r\n    which, on the left side, hung a sword of the length of five\r\n    men; and on the right a bag or pouch divided into two cells,\r\n    each cell capable of holding three of your majesty’s subjects.\r\n    In one of these cells were several globes or balls of a most\r\n    ponderous metal, about the bigness of our heads, and required\r\n    a strong hand to lift them; the other cell contained a heap of\r\n    certain black grains, but of no great bulk or weight, for we\r\n    could hold above fifty of them in the palms of our hands.\r\n\r\n    “This is an exact inventory of what we found about the body\r\n    of the Man-mountain, who used us with great civility, and\r\n    due respect to your majesty’s commission. Signed and sealed\r\n    on the fourth day of the eighty-ninth moon of your majesty’s\r\n    auspicious reign.”\r\n\r\n                                    CLEFREN FRELOCK, MARSI FRELOCK.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen this inventory was read over to the emperor he directed me, although\r\nin very gentle terms, to deliver up the several particulars. He first\r\ncalled for my scimitar, which I took out, scabbard and all. In the\r\nmeantime he ordered three thousand of his choicest troops (who then\r\nattended him) to surround me at a distance, with their bows and arrows\r\njust ready to discharge; but I did not observe it, for my eyes were\r\nwholly fixed upon his majesty. He then desired me to draw my scimitar,\r\nwhich, although it had got some rust by the sea water, was in most parts\r\nexceeding bright. I did so, and immediately all the troops gave a shout\r\nbetween terror and surprise; for the sun shone clear, and the reflection\r\ndazzled their eyes as I waved the scimitar to and fro in my hand. His\r\nmajesty, who is a most magnanimous prince, was less daunted than I could\r\nexpect; he ordered me to return it into the scabbard and cast it on the\r\nground as gently as I could, about six feet from the end of my chain. The\r\nnext thing he demanded was one of the hollow iron pillars, by which he\r\nmeant my pocket pistols. I drew it out, and at his desire, as well as I\r\ncould, expressed to him the use of it; and charging it only with powder,\r\nwhich by the closeness of my pouch happened to escape wetting in the sea\r\n(an inconvenience against which all prudent mariners take special care\r\nto provide), I first cautioned the emperor not to be afraid, and then\r\nI let it off in the air. The astonishment here was much greater than\r\nat the sight of the scimitar. Hundreds fell down as if they had been\r\nstruck dead; and even the emperor, although he stood his ground, could\r\nnot recover himself in some time. I delivered up both my pistols in the\r\nsame manner as I had done my scimitar, and then my pouch of powder and\r\nbullets; begging him that the former might be kept from the fire, for it\r\nwould kindle with the smallest spark and blow up his imperial palace into\r\nthe air. I likewise delivered up my watch, which the emperor was very\r\ncurious to see, and commanded two of his tallest yeomen of the guards to\r\nbear it on a pole upon their shoulders, as draymen in England do a barrel\r\nof ale. He was amazed at the continual noise it made, and the motion of\r\nthe minute hand, which he could easily discern; for their sight is much\r\nmore acute than ours; and asked the opinions of his learned men about\r\nhim, which were various and remote, as the reader may imagine without\r\nmy repeating; although, indeed, I could not very perfectly understand\r\nthem. I then gave up my silver and copper money, my purse with nine large\r\npieces of gold, and some smaller ones; my knife and razor, my comb and\r\nsilver snuff box, my handkerchief and journal book. My scimitar, pistols,\r\nand pouch were conveyed in carriages to his majesty’s stores, but the\r\nrest of my goods were returned me.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “_I likewise delivered up my watch, which the emperor was\r\nvery curious to see_”\r\n\r\n_Page 28_]\r\n\r\nI had, as I before observed, one private pocket which escaped their\r\nsearch, wherein there was a pair of spectacles (which I sometimes use for\r\nthe weakness of my eyes) a pocket perspective, and some other little\r\nconveniences which, being of no consequence to the emperor, I did not\r\nthink myself bound in honor to discover, and I apprehended they might be\r\nlost or spoiled if I ventured them out of my possession.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n    THE AUTHOR DIVERTS THE EMPEROR, AND HIS NOBILITY OF BOTH SEXES,\r\n    IN A VERY UNCOMMON MANNER—THE DIVERSIONS OF THE COURT OF\r\n    LILLIPUT DESCRIBED—THE AUTHOR HAS HIS LIBERTY GRANTED HIM, UPON\r\n    CERTAIN CONDITIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy gentleness and good behavior had gained so far on the emperor and his\r\ncourt, and indeed upon the army and people in general, that I began to\r\nconceive hopes of getting my liberty in a short time. I took all possible\r\nmethods to cultivate this favorable disposition. The natives came by\r\ndegrees to be less apprehensive of any danger from me. I would sometimes\r\nlie down and let five or six of them dance on my hand; and at last the\r\nboys and girls would venture to come and play at hide-and-seek in my\r\nhair. I had now made a good progress in understanding and speaking their\r\nlanguage. The emperor had a mind one day to entertain me with several of\r\nthe country shows, wherein they exceed all nations I have known, both for\r\ndexterity and magnificence. I was diverted with none so much as that of\r\nthe rope dancers, performed upon a slender white thread, extended about\r\ntwo feet and twelve inches from the ground. Upon which I shall desire\r\nliberty, with the reader’s patience, to enlarge a little.\r\n\r\nThis diversion is only practiced by those persons who are candidates\r\nfor great employments and high favor at court. They are trained in this\r\nart from their youth, and are not always of noble birth, or liberal\r\neducation. When a great office is vacant, either by death or disgrace\r\n(which often happens), five or six of those candidates petition the\r\nemperor to entertain his majesty and the court with a dance on the rope;\r\nand whoever jumps the highest without falling succeeds in the office.\r\nVery often the chief ministers themselves are commanded to show their\r\nskill, and to convince the emperor that they have not lost their faculty.\r\nFlimnap, the treasurer, is allowed to cut a caper on the straight rope,\r\nat least an inch higher than any other lord in the whole empire. I have\r\nseen him do the somersault several times together upon a trencher fixed\r\non the rope, which is no thicker than a common packthread in England.\r\nMy friend Reldresal, principal secretary for private affairs, is, in my\r\nopinion, if I am not partial, the second after the treasurer; the rest of\r\nthe great officers are much upon a par.\r\n\r\nThese diversions are often attended with fatal accidents, whereof great\r\nnumbers are on record. I myself have seen two or three candidates break\r\na limb. But the danger is much greater when the ministers themselves are\r\ncommanded to show their dexterity; for, by contending to excel themselves\r\nand their fellows, they strain so far that there is hardly one of them\r\nwho has not received a fall, and some of them two or three. I was assured\r\nthat, a year or two before my arrival, Flimnap would infallibly have\r\nbroke his neck, if one of the king’s cushions, that accidentally lay on\r\nthe ground, had not weakened the force of his fall.\r\n\r\nThere is likewise another diversion which is only shown before the\r\nemperor and empress, and first minister, upon particular occasions. The\r\nemperor lays on the table three fine silken threads of six inches long;\r\none is purple, the other yellow, and the third white. These threads\r\nare proposed as prizes for those persons whom the emperor has a mind to\r\ndistinguish by a peculiar mark of his favor. The ceremony is performed in\r\nhis majesty’s great chamber of state, where the candidates are to undergo\r\na trial of dexterity very different from the former, and such as I have\r\nnot observed the least resemblance of in any other country of the old or\r\nthe new world. The emperor holds a stick in his hands, both ends parallel\r\nto the horizon, while the candidates advancing, one by one, sometimes\r\nleap over the stick, sometimes creep under it, backwards and forwards,\r\nseveral times, according as the stick is advanced or depressed. Sometimes\r\nthe emperor holds one end of the stick, and his first minister the other;\r\nsometimes the minister has it entirely to himself. Whoever performs his\r\npart with most agility and holds out the longest in leaping and creeping,\r\nis rewarded with the purple-colored silk; the yellow is given to the\r\nnext, and the white to the third, which they all wear girt twice round\r\nabout the middle; and you see few great persons about this court who are\r\nnot adorned with one of these girdles.\r\n\r\nThe horses of the army, and those of the royal stables, having been daily\r\nled before me, were no longer shy, but would come up to my very feet\r\nwithout starting. The riders would leap them over my hand, as I held it\r\non the ground; and one of the emperor’s huntsmen, upon a large courser,\r\ntook my foot, shoe and all, which was indeed a prodigious leap. I had the\r\ngood fortune to divert the emperor one day after a very extraordinary\r\nmanner. I desired he would order several sticks of two feet high, and the\r\nthickness of an ordinary cane, to be brought me; whereupon his majesty\r\ncommanded the master of his woods to give directions accordingly, and the\r\nnext morning six woodmen arrived with as many carriages, drawn by eight\r\nhorses to each. I took nine of these sticks and fixing them firmly in the\r\nground in a quadrangular figure, two feet and a half square, I took four\r\nother sticks and tied them parallel at each corner, about two feet from\r\nthe ground; then I fastened my handkerchief to the nine sticks that stood\r\nerect, and extended it on all sides, till it was tight as the top of a\r\ndrum; and the four parallel sticks, rising about five inches higher than\r\nthe handkerchief, served as ledges on each side. When I had finished my\r\nwork I desired the emperor to let a troop of his best horse, twenty-four\r\nin number, come and exercise upon this plane. His majesty approved of\r\nthe proposal, and I took them up one by one in my hands, ready mounted\r\nand armed, with the proper officers to exercise them. As soon as they\r\ngot into order they divided into two parties, performed mock skirmishes,\r\ndischarged blunt arrows, drew their swords, fled and pursued, attacked\r\nand retired, and in short, discovered the best military discipline I ever\r\nbeheld. The parallel sticks secured them and their horses from falling\r\nover the stage; and the emperor was so much delighted that he ordered\r\nthis entertainment to be repeated several days, and once was pleased to\r\nbe lifted up and give the word of command; and, with great difficulty,\r\npersuaded even the empress herself to let me hold her in her close\r\nchair within two yards of the stage, from whence she was able to take a\r\nfull view of the whole performance. It was my good fortune that no ill\r\naccident happened in these entertainments; only once a fiery horse that\r\nbelonged to one of the captains, pawing with his hoof, struck a hole\r\nin my handkerchief, and, his foot slipping, he overthrew his rider and\r\nhimself; but I immediately relieved them both, and, covering the hole\r\nwith one hand, I set down the troop with the other, in the same manner as\r\nI took them up. The horse that fell was strained in the left shoulder,\r\nbut the rider got no hurt, and I repaired my handkerchief as well as I\r\ncould; however, I would not trust to the strength of it any more in such\r\ndangerous enterprises.\r\n\r\nAbout two or three days before I was set at liberty, as I was\r\nentertaining the court with this kind of feats, there arrived an express\r\nto inform his majesty that some of his subjects, riding near the place\r\nwhere I was first taken up, had seen a great black substance lying on\r\nthe ground, very oddly shaped, extending its edges round as wide as his\r\nmajesty’s bedchamber, and rising up in the middle as high as a man; that\r\nit was no living creature, as they at first apprehended, for it lay on\r\nthe grass without motion, and some of them had walked round it several\r\ntimes; that, by mounting upon each other’s shoulders, they had got to\r\nthe top, which was flat and even, and stamping upon it, they found that\r\nit was hollow within; that they humbly conceived it might be something\r\nbelonging to the Man-mountain; and if his majesty pleased they would\r\nundertake to bring it with only five horses. I presently knew what they\r\nmeant, and was glad at heart to receive this intelligence. It seems,\r\nupon my first reaching the shore after our shipwreck, I was in such\r\nconfusion that before I came to the place where I went to sleep, my\r\nhat, which I had fastened with a string to my head while I was rowing,\r\nand had stuck on all the time I was swimming, fell off after I came\r\nto land; the string, as I conjecture, breaking by some accident which\r\nI never observed, but thought my hat had been lost at sea. I entreated\r\nhis imperial majesty to give orders it might be brought to me as soon as\r\npossible, describing to him the use and the nature of it; and the next\r\nday the wagoners arrived with it, but not in a very good condition; they\r\nhad bored two holes in the brim, within an inch and a half of the edge,\r\nand fastened two hooks in the holes; these hooks were tied by a long\r\ncord to the harness, and thus my hat was dragged along for above half an\r\nEnglish mile, but the ground in that country being extremely smooth and\r\nlevel, it received less damage than I expected.\r\n\r\nTwo days after this adventure, the emperor, having ordered that part of\r\nhis army which quarters in and about his metropolis to be in readiness,\r\ntook a fancy of diverting himself in a very singular manner. He desired\r\nthat I would stand like a colossus, with my legs as far asunder as\r\nI conveniently could. He then commanded his general (who was an old\r\nexperienced leader, and a great patron of mine) to draw up the troops in\r\nclose order, and march them under me; the foot by twenty-four abreast,\r\nand the horse by sixteen, with drums beating, colors flying, and pikes\r\nadvanced. This body consisted of three thousand foot, and a thousand\r\nhorse.\r\n\r\nI had sent so many memorials and petitions for my liberty that his\r\nmajesty at length mentioned the matter, first in the cabinet and then in\r\na full council, where it was opposed by none except Skyresh Bolgolam,\r\nwho was pleased, without any provocation, to be my mortal enemy. But it\r\nwas carried against him by the whole board and confirmed by the emperor.\r\nThat minister was _galbet_, or admiral of the realm, very much in his\r\nmaster’s confidence, and a person well versed in affairs, but of a morose\r\nand sour complexion. However, he was at length persuaded to comply, but\r\nprevailed that the articles and conditions upon which I should be set\r\nfree, and to which I must swear, should be drawn up by himself. These\r\narticles were brought to me by Skyresh Bolgolam in person, attended by\r\ntwo under-secretaries and several persons of distinction. After they\r\nwere read, I was demanded to swear to the performance of them, first in\r\nthe manner of my own country, and afterwards in the methods prescribed\r\nby their laws, which was to hold my right foot in my left hand, and to\r\nplace the middle finger of my right hand on the crown of my head, and my\r\nthumb on the tip of my right ear. But because the reader may perhaps be\r\ncurious to have some idea of the style and manner of expression peculiar\r\nto that people, as well as to know the articles upon which I recovered\r\nmy liberty, I have made a translation of the whole instrument, word for\r\nword, as near as I was able, which I here offer to the public:\r\n\r\n    GOLBASTO MOMAREN EVLAME GURDILO SHEFIN MULLY ULLY GUE, most\r\n    mighty Emperor of Lilliput, delight and terror of the universe,\r\n    whose dominions extend five thousand _blustrogs_ (about twelve\r\n    miles in circumference) to the extremities of the globe;\r\n    monarch of all monarchs, taller than the sons of men; whose\r\n    feet press down to the center, and whose head strikes against\r\n    the sun; at whose nod the princes of the earth shake their\r\n    knees; pleasant as the spring, comfortable as the summer,\r\n    fruitful as autumn, dreadful as winter. His most sublime\r\n    majesty proposes to the Man-mountain, lately arrived at our\r\n    celestial dominions, the following articles, which, by a solemn\r\n    oath, he shall be obliged to perform:\r\n\r\n    I. The Man-mountain shall not depart from our dominions without\r\n    our license under our great seal.\r\n\r\n    II. He shall not presume to come into our metropolis without\r\n    our express order; at which time, the inhabitants shall have\r\n    two hours’ warning to keep within their doors.\r\n\r\n    III. The said Man-mountain shall confine his walks to our\r\n    principal highroads, and not offer to walk or lie down in a\r\n    meadow or field of corn.\r\n\r\n    IV. As he walks the said roads, he shall take the utmost care\r\n    not to trample upon the bodies of any of our loving subjects,\r\n    their horses or carriages, nor take any of our said subjects\r\n    into his hands without their own consent.\r\n\r\n    V. If an express requires extraordinary dispatch, the\r\n    Man-mountain shall be obliged to carry, in his pocket, the\r\n    messenger and horse a six days’ journey once in every moon, and\r\n    return the said messenger back (if so required) safe to our\r\n    imperial presence.\r\n\r\n    VI. He shall be our ally against our enemies in the island of\r\n    Blefuscu, and do his utmost to destroy their fleet, which is\r\n    now preparing to invade us.\r\n\r\n    VII. That the said Man-mountain shall, at his times of\r\n    leisure, be aiding and assisting to our workmen, in helping to\r\n    raise certain great stones, towards covering the wall of the\r\n    principal park, and other of our royal buildings.\r\n\r\n    VIII. That the said Man-mountain shall, in two moons’ time,\r\n    deliver in an exact survey of the circumference of our\r\n    dominions, by a computation of his own paces round the coast.\r\n\r\n    Lastly, That upon his solemn oath to observe the above\r\n    articles, the said Man-mountain shall have a daily allowance\r\n    of meat and drink sufficient for the support of 1728 of our\r\n    subjects, with free access to our royal person, and other marks\r\n    of our favor. Given at our palace at Belfaborac, the twelfth\r\n    day of the ninety-first moon of our reign.\r\n\r\nI swore and subscribed to these articles with great cheerfulness and\r\ncontent, although some of them were not so honorable as I could have\r\nwished; which proceeded wholly from the malice of Skyresh Bolgolam, the\r\nhigh-admiral; whereupon my chains were immediately unlocked, and I was at\r\nfull liberty. The emperor himself, in person, did me the honor to be by\r\nat the whole ceremony. I made my acknowledgments by prostrating myself at\r\nhis majesty’s feet; but he commanded me to rise; and after many gracious\r\nexpressions, which to avoid the censure of vanity I shall not repeat, he\r\nadded that he hoped I should prove a useful servant, and well deserve all\r\nthe favors he had already conferred upon me, or might do for the future.\r\n\r\nThe reader may please to observe, that in the last article for the\r\nrecovery of my liberty the emperor stipulates to allow me a quantity\r\nof meat and drink sufficient for the support of 1728 Lilliputians.\r\nSome time after, asking a friend at court how they came to fix on that\r\ndeterminate number, he told me that his majesty’s mathematicians, having\r\ntaken the height of my body by the help of a quadrant, and finding it\r\nto exceed theirs in the proportion of twelve to one, they concluded from\r\nthe similarity of their bodies, that mine must contain at least 1728 of\r\ntheirs, and consequently would require as much food as was necessary to\r\nsupport that number of Lilliputians. By which the reader may conceive an\r\nidea of the ingenuity of that people, as well as the prudent and exact\r\neconomy of so great a prince.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n    MILDENDO, THE METROPOLIS OF LILLIPUT, DESCRIBED, TOGETHER WITH\r\n    THE EMPEROR’S PALACE—A CONVERSATION BETWEEN THE AUTHOR AND A\r\n    PRINCIPAL SECRETARY, CONCERNING THE AFFAIRS OF THAT EMPIRE—THE\r\n    AUTHOR’S OFFERS TO SERVE THE EMPEROR IN HIS WARS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first request I made after I had obtained my liberty, was that I\r\nmight have license to see Mildendo, the metropolis; which the emperor\r\neasily granted me, but with a special charge to do no hurt either to the\r\ninhabitants or their houses. The people had notice, by proclamation,\r\nof my design to visit the town. The wall which encompassed it, is two\r\nfeet and a half high, and at least eleven inches broad, so that a coach\r\nand horses may be driven very safely round it; and it is flanked with\r\nstrong towers at ten feet distance. I stepped over the great western\r\ngate, and passed very gently and sideling through the two principal\r\nstreets, only in my short waistcoat, for fear of damaging the roofs and\r\neaves of the houses with the skirts of my coat. I walked with the utmost\r\ncircumspection, to avoid treading on any stragglers that might remain in\r\nthe streets; although the orders were very strict that all people should\r\nkeep in their houses, at their own peril. The garret windows and tops of\r\nhouses were so crowded with spectators that I thought in all my travels\r\nI had not seen a more populous place. The city is an exact square, each\r\nside of the wall being five hundred feet long. The two great streets\r\nwhich run across and divide it into four quarters, are five feet wide.\r\nThe lanes and alleys, which I could not enter, but only viewed them as\r\nI passed, are from twelve to eighteen inches. The town is capable of\r\nholding five hundred thousand souls. The houses are from three to five\r\nstories; the shops and markets well provided.\r\n\r\nThe emperor’s palace is in the center of the city, where the two great\r\nstreets meet. It is inclosed by a wall of two feet high, and twenty feet\r\ndistant from the buildings. I had his majesty’s permission to step over\r\nthis wall; and the space being so wide between that and the palace, I\r\ncould easily view it on every side. The outward court is a square of\r\nforty feet, and includes two other courts; in the inmost are the royal\r\napartments, which I was very desirous to see, but found it extremely\r\ndifficult; for the great gates, from one square into another, were but\r\neighteen inches high and seven inches wide. Now the buildings of the\r\nouter court were at least five feet high, and it was impossible for me to\r\nstride over them without infinite damage to the pile, though the walls\r\nwere strongly built of hewn stone, and four inches thick. At the same\r\ntime the emperor had a great desire that I should see the magnificence of\r\nhis palace; but this I was not able to do till three days after, which\r\nI spent in cutting down with my knife some of the largest trees in the\r\nroyal park, about a hundred yards’ distance from the city. Of these trees\r\nI made two stools, each about three feet high, and strong enough to bear\r\nmy weight. The people having received notice a second time, I went again\r\nthrough the city to the palace with my two stools in my hands. When I\r\ncame to the side of the outer court, I stood upon one stool and took the\r\nother in my hand; this I lifted over the roof, and gently set it down on\r\nthe space between the first and second court, which was eight feet wide.\r\nI then stepped over the buildings very conveniently from one stool to the\r\nother, and drew up the first one after me with a hooked stick. By this\r\ncontrivance I got into the inmost court; and, lying down upon my side,\r\nI applied my face to the windows of the middle stories, which were left\r\nopen on purpose, and discovered the most splendid apartments that can be\r\nimagined.\r\n\r\nThere I saw the empress and the young princes, in their several lodgings,\r\nwith their chief attendants about them. Her imperial majesty was pleased\r\nto smile very graciously upon me, and gave me out of the window her hand\r\nto kiss.\r\n\r\nBut I shall not anticipate the reader with further descriptions of\r\nthis kind, because I reserve them for a greater work, which is now\r\nalmost ready for the press; containing a general description of this\r\nempire, from its first erection, through a long series of princes; with\r\na particular account of their wars and politics, laws, learning and\r\nreligion, their plants and animals, their peculiar manners and customs,\r\nwith other matters very curious and useful; my chief design at present\r\nbeing only to relate such events and transactions as happened to the\r\npublic or to myself during a residence of about nine months in that\r\nempire.\r\n\r\nOne morning, about a fortnight after I had obtained my liberty,\r\nReldresal, principal secretary (as they style him) for private affairs,\r\ncame to my house attended only by one servant. He ordered his coach to\r\nwait at a distance, and desired I would give him an hour’s audience;\r\nwhich I readily consented to, on account of his quality and personal\r\nmerits, as well as the many good offices he had done me during my\r\nsolicitations at court. I offered to lie down, that he might the more\r\nconveniently reach my ear; but he chose rather to let me hold him in my\r\nhand during our conversation. He began with compliments on my liberty;\r\nsaid he might pretend to some merit in it; but, however, added, that if\r\nit had not been for the present situation of things at court, perhaps I\r\nmight not have obtained it so soon. “For,” said he, “as flourishing a\r\ncondition as we may appear to be in to foreigners, we labor under two\r\nmighty evils: a violent faction at home, and the danger of an invasion by\r\na most potent enemy from abroad. As to the first, you are to understand\r\nthat for above seventy moons past there have been two struggling parties\r\nin this empire, under the names of _Tramecksan_ and _Slamecksan_,\r\nfrom the high and low heels of their shoes, by which they distinguish\r\nthemselves. It is alleged, indeed, that the high heels are most agreeable\r\nto our ancient constitution; but, however this may be, his majesty has\r\ndetermined to make use of only low heels in the administration of the\r\ngovernment, and all offices in the gift of the crown, as you cannot\r\nbut observe; and particularly, that his majesty’s imperial heels are\r\nlower at least by a _drurr_ than any of his court (_drurr_ is a measure\r\nabout the fourteenth part of an inch). The animosities between these\r\ntwo parties run so high, that they will neither eat nor drink nor\r\ntalk with each other. We compute the _Tramecksan_, or High-heels, to\r\nexceed us in number; but the power is wholly on our side. We apprehend\r\nhis imperial highness, the heir to the crown, to have some tendency\r\ntowards the High-heels; at least, we can plainly discover one of his\r\nheels higher than the other, which gives him a hobble in his gait. Now,\r\nin the midst of these intestine disquiets, we are threatened with an\r\ninvasion from the island of Blefuscu, which is the other great empire of\r\nthe universe, almost as large and powerful as this of his majesty. For\r\nas to what we have heard you affirm, that there are other kingdoms and\r\nstates in the world, inhabited by human creatures as large as yourself,\r\nour philosophers are in much doubt, and would rather conjecture that\r\nyou dropped from the moon, or one of the stars; because it is certain\r\nthat a hundred mortals of your bulk would in a short time destroy all\r\nthe fruits and cattle of his majesty’s dominions; besides, our histories\r\nof six thousand moons make no mention of any other regions than the\r\ntwo great empires of Lilliput and Blefuscu. Which two mighty powers\r\nhave, as I was going to tell you, been engaged in a most obstinate war\r\nfor six-and-thirty moons past. It began upon the following occasion:\r\nIt is allowed on all hands, that the primitive way of breaking eggs,\r\nbefore we eat them, was upon the larger end; but his present majesty’s\r\ngrandfather, while he was a boy, going to eat an egg, and breaking it\r\naccording to the ancient practice, happened to cut one of his fingers;\r\nwhereupon the emperor, his father, published an edict, commanding all\r\nhis subjects, upon great penalties, to break the smaller end of their\r\neggs. The people so highly resented this law, that our histories tell\r\nus there have been six rebellions raised on that account; wherein one\r\nemperor lost his life, and another his crown. These civil commotions\r\nwere constantly fomented by the monarchs of Blefuscu; and when they\r\nwere quelled, the exiles always fled for refuge to that empire. It is\r\ncomputed that eleven thousand persons have, at several times, suffered\r\ndeath, rather than submit to break their eggs at the smaller end. Many\r\nhundred large volumes have been published upon this controversy; but the\r\nbooks of the Big-endians have been long forbidden, and the whole party\r\nrendered incapable by law of holding employments. During the course of\r\nthese troubles, the emperors of Blefuscu did frequently expostulate\r\nby their ambassadors, accusing us of making a schism in religion by\r\noffending against a fundamental doctrine of our great prophet Lustrog, in\r\nthe fifty-fourth chapter of the Blundecral, which is their Alcoran. This,\r\nhowever, is thought to be a mere strain upon the text; for the words are\r\nthese: That all true believers shall break their eggs at the convenient\r\nend; and which is the convenient end seems, in my humble opinion, to be\r\nleft to every man’s conscience, or at least in the power of the chief\r\nmagistrate to determine. Now, the Big-endian exiles have found so much\r\ncredit in the emperor of Blefuscu’s court, and so much private assistance\r\nand encouragement from their party here at home, that a bloody war has\r\nbeen carried on between the two empires for six-and-thirty moons, with\r\nvarious success; during which time we have lost forty capital ships, and\r\na much greater number of smaller vessels, together with thirty thousand\r\nof our best seamen and soldiers; and the damage received by the enemy\r\nis reckoned to be somewhat greater than ours. However, they have now\r\nequipped a numerous fleet, and are just preparing to make a descent upon\r\nus; and his imperial majesty, placing great confidence in your valor and\r\nstrength, has commanded me to lay this account of his affairs before you.”\r\n\r\nI desired the secretary to present my humble duty to the emperor; and to\r\nlet him know that I thought it would not become me, who was a foreigner,\r\nto interfere with parties; but I was ready, with the hazard of my life,\r\nto defend his person and state against all invaders.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n    THE AUTHOR, BY AN EXTRAORDINARY STRATAGEM, PREVENTS\r\n    AN INVASION—A HIGH TITLE OF HONOR IS CONFERRED UPON\r\n    HIM—AMBASSADORS ARRIVE FROM THE EMPEROR OF BLEFUSCU, AND SUE\r\n    FOR PEACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe empire of Blefuscu is an island situated to the northeast of\r\nLilliput, from which it is parted only by a channel eight hundred\r\nyards wide. I had not yet seen it, and upon this notice of an intended\r\ninvasion, I avoided appearing on that side of the coast, for fear of\r\nbeing discovered by some of the enemy’s ships, who had received no\r\nintelligence of me; all intercourse between the two empires having been\r\nstrictly forbidden during the war, upon pain of death, and an embargo\r\nlaid by our emperor upon all vessels whatsoever. I communicated to his\r\nmajesty a project I had formed of seizing the enemy’s whole fleet; which,\r\nas our scouts assured us, lay at anchor in the harbor, ready to sail with\r\nthe first fair wind. I consulted the most experienced seamen upon the\r\ndepth of the channel, which they had often plumbed; who told me, that in\r\nthe middle, at high water, it was seventy _glumgluffs_ deep, which is\r\nabout six feet of European measure; and the rest of it fifty _glumgluffs_\r\nat most. I walked towards the northeast coast, over against Blefuscu,\r\nand lying down behind a hillock, I took out my small pocket perspective\r\nglass, and viewed the enemy’s fleet at anchor, consisting of about fifty\r\nmen of war, and a great number of transports; I then came back to my\r\nhouse, and gave orders (for which I had a warrant) for a great quantity\r\nof the strongest cable and bars of iron. The cable was about as thick as\r\npackthread, and the bars of the length and size of a knitting needle. I\r\ntrebled the cable to make it stronger, and for the same reason I twisted\r\nthree of the iron bars together, bending the extremities into a hook.\r\nHaving thus fixed fifty hooks to as many cables, I went back to the\r\nnortheast coast, and putting off my coat, shoes, and stockings, walked\r\ninto the sea in my leathern jerkin, about half an hour before high water.\r\nI waded with what haste I could, and swam in the middle about thirty\r\nyards, till I felt ground. I arrived at the fleet in less than half an\r\nhour. The enemy were so frightened when they saw me, that they leaped out\r\nof their ships, and swam to shore, where there could not be fewer than\r\nthirty thousand souls. I then took my tackling, and fastening a hook to\r\nthe hole at the prow of each, I tied all the cords together at the end.\r\nWhile I was thus employed, the enemy discharged several thousand arrows,\r\nmany of which stuck in my hands and face; and besides the excessive\r\nsmart, gave me much disturbance in my work. My greatest apprehension was\r\nfor my eyes, which I should have infallibly lost, if I had not suddenly\r\nthought of an expedient. I kept, among other little necessaries, a\r\npair of spectacles in a private pocket, which, as I observed before,\r\nhad escaped the emperor’s searchers. These I took out and fastened as\r\nstrongly as I could upon my nose, and, thus armed, went on boldly with my\r\nwork, in spite of the enemy’s arrows, many of which struck against the\r\nglasses of my spectacles, but without any other effect further than a\r\nlittle to discompose them. I had now fastened all the hooks, and taking\r\nthe knot in my hand, began to pull; but not a ship would stir, for they\r\nwere all too fast held by their anchors, so that the boldest part of\r\nmy enterprise remained. I therefore let go the cord, and leaving the\r\nhooks fixed to the ships, I resolutely cut with my knife the cables that\r\nfastened the anchors, receiving about two hundred arrows in my face and\r\nhands; then I took up the knotted end of the cables to which my hooks\r\nwere tied, and with great ease drew fifty of the enemy’s largest men of\r\nwar after me.\r\n\r\nThe Blefuscudians, who had not the least imagination of what I intended,\r\nwere at first confounded with astonishment. They had seen me cut the\r\ncables, and thought my design was only to let the ships run adrift, or\r\nfall foul on each other; but when they perceived the whole fleet moving\r\nin order, and saw me pulling at the end, they set up such a scream of\r\ngrief and despair as is almost impossible to describe or conceive. When I\r\nhad got out of danger, I stopped awhile to pick out the arrows that stuck\r\nin my hands and face; and rubbed on some of the same ointment that was\r\ngiven me at my first arrival, as I have formerly mentioned. I then took\r\noff my spectacles, and waiting about an hour till the tide was a little\r\nfallen, I waded through the middle with my cargo, and arrived safe at the\r\nroyal port of Lilliput.\r\n\r\nThe emperor and his whole court stood on the shore, expecting the issue\r\nof this great adventure. They saw the ships move forward in a large\r\nhalf-moon, but could not discern me, who was up to my breast in water.\r\nWhen I advanced to the middle of the channel, they were yet more in pain,\r\nbecause I was under water to my neck. The emperor concluded me to be\r\ndrowned, and that the enemy’s fleet was approaching in a hostile manner.\r\nBut he was soon eased of his fears; for the channel growing shallower\r\nevery step I made, I came in a short time within hearing, and holding\r\nup the end of the cable, by which the fleet was fastened, I cried in a\r\nloud voice, “Long live the most puissant emperor of Lilliput!” This great\r\nprince received me at my landing with all possible encomiums, and created\r\nme a _nardac_ upon the spot, which is the highest title of honor among\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nHis majesty desired I would take some other opportunity of bringing all\r\nthe rest of the enemy’s ships into his ports. And so unmeasurable is\r\nthe ambition of princes, that he seemed to think of nothing less than\r\nreducing the whole empire of Blefuscu into a province, and governing it\r\nby a viceroy; of destroying the Big-endian exiles, and compelling that\r\npeople to break the smaller end of their eggs, by which he would remain\r\nthe sole monarch of the whole world. But I endeavored to divert him from\r\nthis design, by many arguments drawn from the topics of policy as well as\r\njustice; and I plainly protested that I would never be an instrument of\r\nbringing a free and brave people into slavery. And when the latter was\r\ndebated in council, the wisest part of the ministry were of my opinion.\r\n\r\nThis open, bold declaration of mine was so opposite to the schemes\r\nand politics of his imperial majesty, that he could never forgive me.\r\nHe mentioned it in a very artful manner at council, where I was told\r\nthat some of the wisest appeared, at least, by their silence, to be of\r\nmy opinion; but others, who were my secret enemies, could not forbear\r\nsome expressions which by a side wind reflected on me; and from this\r\ntime began an intrigue between his majesty, and a junto of ministers\r\nmaliciously bent against me, which broke out in less than two months,\r\nand had like to have ended in my utter destruction. Of so little weight\r\nare the greatest services to princes when put into the balance with a\r\nrefusal to gratify their passions.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “_They perceived the whole fleet moving in order_”\r\n\r\n_Page 49_]\r\n\r\nAbout three weeks after this exploit there arrived a solemn embassy\r\nfrom Blefuscu, with humble offers of a peace; which was soon concluded\r\nupon conditions very advantageous to our emperor, wherewith I shall not\r\ntrouble the reader. There were six ambassadors with a train of about\r\nfive hundred persons; and their entry was very magnificent, suitable\r\nto the grandeur of their master and the importance of their business.\r\nWhen their treaty was finished, wherein I did them several good offices\r\nby the credit I now had, or at least appeared to have, at court, their\r\nexcellencies, who were privately told how much I had been their friend,\r\nmade me a visit in form. They began with many compliments upon my valor\r\nand generosity, invited me to that kingdom in the emperor their master’s\r\nname, and desired me to show them some proofs of my prodigious strength,\r\nof which they had heard so many wonders; wherein I readily obliged them,\r\nbut shall not trouble the reader with the particulars.\r\n\r\nWhen I had for some time entertained their excellencies, to their\r\ninfinite satisfaction and surprise, I desired they would do me the\r\nhonor to present my most humble respects to the emperor their master,\r\nthe renown of whose virtues had so justly filled the whole world with\r\nadmiration, and whose royal person I resolved to attend before I returned\r\nto my own country. Accordingly, the next time I had the honor to see\r\nour emperor, I desired his general license to wait on the Blefuscudian\r\nmonarch, which he was pleased to grant me, as I could perceive, in a very\r\ncold manner; but could not guess the reason, till I had a whisper from a\r\ncertain person, that Flimnap and Bolgolam had represented my intercourse\r\nwith those ambassadors as a mark of disaffection; from which I am sure my\r\nheart was wholly free. And this was the first time I began to conceive\r\nsome imperfect idea of courts and ministers.\r\n\r\nIt is to be observed, that these ambassadors spoke to me by an\r\ninterpreter, the languages of both empires differing as much from each\r\nother as any two in Europe, and each nation priding itself upon the\r\nantiquity, beauty, and energy of their own tongues, with an avowed\r\ncontempt for that of their neighbor; yet our emperor, standing upon\r\nthe advantage he had got by the seizure of their fleet, obliged them\r\nto deliver their credentials, and make their speech in the Lilliputian\r\ntongue. And it must be confessed, that from the great intercourse of\r\ntrade and commerce between both realms, from the continual reception of\r\nexiles which is mutual among them, and from the custom in each empire to\r\nsend their young nobility and richer gentry to the other, in order to\r\npolish themselves by seeing the world, and understanding men and manners,\r\nthere are few persons of distinction, or merchants, or seamen, who dwell\r\nin the maritime parts, but what can hold conversation in both tongues; as\r\nI found some weeks after, when I went to pay my respects to the emperor\r\nof Blefuscu, which, in the midst of great misfortunes through the malice\r\nof my enemies, proved a very happy adventure to me, as I shall relate in\r\nits proper place.\r\n\r\nThe reader may remember, that when I signed those articles upon which I\r\nrecovered my liberty, there were some which I disliked upon account of\r\ntheir being too servile; neither could anything but an extreme necessity\r\nhave forced me to submit. But being now a _nardac_ of the highest rank in\r\nthat empire, such offices were looked upon as below my dignity, and the\r\nemperor (to do him justice) never once mentioned them to me.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n    OF THE INHABITANTS OF LILLIPUT; THEIR LEARNING, LAWS, AND\r\n    CUSTOMS; THE MANNER OF EDUCATING THEIR CHILDREN—THE AUTHOR’S\r\n    WAY OF LIVING IN THAT COUNTRY—HIS VINDICATION OF A GREAT LADY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough I intend to leave the description of this empire to a particular\r\ntreatise, yet in the meantime I am content to gratify the curious reader\r\nwith some general ideas. As the common size of the natives is somewhat\r\nunder six inches high, so there is an exact proportion in all other\r\nanimals, as well as plants and trees; for instance, the tallest horses\r\nand oxen are between four and five inches in height, the sheep an inch\r\nand a half, more or less; their geese about the bigness of a sparrow,\r\nand so the several gradations downwards, till you come to the smallest,\r\nwhich to my sight were almost invisible; but nature has adapted the eyes\r\nof the Lilliputians to all objects proper for their view; they see with\r\ngreat exactness, but at no great distance. And to show the sharpness of\r\ntheir sight towards objects that are near, I have been much pleased in\r\nobserving a cook pulling a lark, which was not so large as a common fly;\r\nand a young girl threading an invisible needle with invisible silk. Their\r\ntallest trees are about seven feet high: I mean some of those in the\r\ngreat royal park, the tops whereof I could but just reach with my fist\r\nclenched. The other vegetables are in the same proportion; but this I\r\nleave to the reader’s imagination.\r\n\r\nI shall say but little at present of their learning, which for many\r\nages has flourished in all its branches among them; but their manner\r\nof writing is very peculiar, being neither from the left to the right,\r\nlike the Europeans; nor from the right to the left, like the Arabians;\r\nnor from up to down, like the Chinese; nor from down to up, like the\r\nCascagians; but aslant, from one corner of the paper to the other, like\r\nladies in England.\r\n\r\nThey bury their dead with their heads directly downward, because they\r\nhold an opinion that in eleven thousand moons they are all to rise\r\nagain; in which period the earth (which they conceive to be flat) will\r\nturn upside down, and by this means they shall, at their resurrection,\r\nbe found ready standing on their feet. The learned among them confess\r\nthe absurdity of this doctrine; but the practice still continues, in\r\ncompliance to the vulgar.\r\n\r\nThere are some laws and customs in this empire very peculiar; and if\r\nthey were not so directly contrary to those of my own dear country, I\r\nshould be tempted to say a little in their justification. It is only to\r\nbe wished they were as well executed. The first I shall mention relates\r\nto informers. All crimes against the state are punished here with the\r\nutmost severity; but if the person accused makes his innocence plainly to\r\nappear upon his trial, the accuser is immediately put to an ignominious\r\ndeath; and out of his goods or lands the innocent person is quadruply\r\nrecompensed for the loss of his time, for the danger he underwent, for\r\nthe hardship of his imprisonment, and for all the charges he has been\r\nat in making his defense; or, if that fund be deficient, it is largely\r\nsupplied by the crown. The emperor does also confer on him some public\r\nmark of his favor, and proclamation is made of his innocence through the\r\nwhole city.\r\n\r\nThey look upon fraud as a greater crime than theft, and therefore\r\nseldom fail to punish it with death; for they allege, that care and\r\nvigilance, with a very common understanding, may preserve a man’s goods\r\nfrom thieves, but honesty has no fence against superior cunning; and\r\nsince it is necessary that there should be a perpetual intercourse of\r\nbuying and selling, and dealing upon credit, where fraud is permitted\r\nand connived at, or has no law to punish it, the honest dealer is always\r\nundone, and the knave gets the advantage. I remember, when I was once\r\ninterceding with the king for a criminal who had wronged his master of a\r\ngreat sum of money, which he had received by order, and ran away with;\r\nand happening to tell his majesty by way of extenuation, that it was only\r\na breach of trust, the emperor thought it monstrous in me to offer as a\r\ndefense the greatest aggravation of the crime; and truly I had little to\r\nsay in return, farther than the common answer that different nations had\r\ndifferent customs; for I confess I was heartily ashamed.\r\n\r\nAlthough we call reward and punishment the two hinges upon which all\r\ngovernment turns, yet I could never observe this maxim to be put in\r\npractice by any nation except that of Lilliput. Whoever can there bring\r\nsufficient proof that he has strictly observed the laws of his country\r\nfor seventy-three moons, has a claim to certain privileges, according to\r\nhis quality and condition of life, with a proportionable sum of money out\r\nof a fund appropriated for that use: he likewise acquires the title of\r\nsnilpall, or legal, which is added to his name, but does not descend to\r\nhis posterity. And these people thought it a prodigious defect of policy\r\namong us, when I told them our laws were enforced only by penalties,\r\nwithout any mention of reward. It is upon this account that the image\r\nof Justice, in their courts of judicature, is formed with six eyes, two\r\nbefore, as many behind, and on each side one, to signify circumspection;\r\nwith a bag of gold open in her right hand, and a sword sheathed in her\r\nleft, to show that she is more disposed to reward than to punish.\r\n\r\nIn choosing persons for all employments, they have more regard to good\r\nmorals than to great abilities; for, since government is necessary to\r\nmankind, they believe that the common size of human understandings is\r\nfitted to some station or other; and that Providence never intended to\r\nmake the management of public affairs a mystery to be comprehended only\r\nby a few persons of sublime genius, of which there seldom are three born\r\nin an age. But they suppose truth, justice, temperance, and the like,\r\nto be in every man’s power; the practice of which virtues, assisted by\r\nexperience and a good intention, would qualify any man for the service of\r\nhis country, except where a course of study is required. But they thought\r\nthe want of moral virtues was so far from being supplied by superior\r\nendowments of the mind, that employments could never be put into such\r\ndangerous hands as those of persons so qualified; and at least, that the\r\nmistakes committed by ignorance, in a virtuous disposition, would never\r\nbe of such fatal consequence to the public weal, as the practices of a\r\nman whose inclinations led him to be corrupt, and who had great abilities\r\nto manage, and multiply, and defend his corruptions.\r\n\r\nIn like manner, the disbelief of a Divine Providence renders a man\r\nincapable of holding any public station; for since kings avow themselves\r\nto be the deputies of Providence, the Lilliputians think nothing can be\r\nmore absurd than for a prince to employ such men as disown the authority\r\nunder which he acts.\r\n\r\nIn relating these and the following laws, I would only be understood to\r\nmean the original institutions, and not the most scandalous corruptions,\r\ninto which these people are fallen by the degenerate nature of man. For,\r\nas to that infamous practice of acquiring great employments by dancing\r\non the ropes, or badges of favor and distinction by leaping over sticks\r\nand creeping under them, the reader is to observe that they were first\r\nintroduced by the grandfather of the emperor now reigning, and grew to\r\nthe present height by the gradual increase of party and faction.\r\n\r\nIngratitude is among them a capital crime, as we read it to have been\r\nin some other countries; for they reason thus: That whosoever makes ill\r\nreturns to his benefactor, must needs be a common enemy to the rest of\r\nmankind, from whom he has received no obligation, and therefore such a\r\nman is not fit to live.\r\n\r\nTheir notions relating to the duties of parents and children differ\r\nextremely from ours. For since the conjunction of male and female is\r\nfounded upon the great law of nature, in order to propagate and continue\r\nthe species, the Lilliputians will needs have it, that men and women are\r\njoined together, like other animals, by the motives of concupiscence; and\r\nthat their tenderness toward their young proceeds from the like natural\r\nprinciple: for which reason, they will never allow that a child is under\r\nany obligation to his father for begetting him, or to his mother for\r\nbringing him into the world; which, considering the miseries of human\r\nlife, was neither a benefit in itself, nor intended so by his parents,\r\nwhose thoughts, in their love encounters, were otherwise employed. Upon\r\nthese, and the like reasonings, their opinion is, that parents are\r\nthe last of all others to be trusted with the education of their own\r\nchildren; and therefore they have in every town public nurseries, where\r\nall parents, except cottagers and laborers, are obliged to send their\r\ninfants of both sexes to be reared and educated when they come to the age\r\nof twenty moons, at which time they are supposed to have some rudiments\r\nof docility. These schools are of several kinds, suited to different\r\nqualities and to both sexes. They have certain professors well skilled\r\nin preparing children for such a condition of life as befits the rank of\r\ntheir parents, and their own capacities as well as inclinations. I shall\r\nfirst say something of the male nurseries, and then of the female.\r\n\r\nThe nurseries for males of noble or eminent birth are provided with\r\ngrave and learned professors, and their several deputies. The clothes\r\nand food of the children are plain and simple. They are bred up in the\r\nprinciples of honor, justice, courage, modesty, clemency, religion, and\r\nlove of their country; they are always employed in some business, except\r\nin the times of eating and sleeping, which are very short, and two hours\r\nfor diversions, consisting of bodily exercises. They are dressed by\r\nmen till four years of age, and then are obliged to dress themselves,\r\nalthough their quality be ever so great; and the women attendants, who\r\nare aged proportionably to ours at fifty, perform only the most menial\r\noffices. They are never suffered to converse with servants, but go\r\ntogether, in smaller or greater numbers, to take their diversions, and\r\nalways in the presence of a professor or one of his deputies; whereby\r\nthey avoid those early bad impressions of folly and vice to which our\r\nchildren are subject. Their parents are suffered to see them only twice\r\na year; the visit is to last but an hour; they are allowed to kiss the\r\nchild at meeting and parting; but a professor, who always stands by on\r\nthose occasions, will not suffer them to whisper, or use any fondling\r\nexpressions, or bring any presents of toys, sweetmeats, and the like.\r\n\r\nThe pension from each family for the education and entertainment of a\r\nchild, upon failure of due payment, is levied by the emperor’s officers.\r\n\r\nThe nurseries for children of ordinary gentlemen, merchants, traders, and\r\nhandicrafts, are managed proportionably after the same manner; only those\r\ndesigned for trades are put out apprentices at eleven years old: whereas\r\nthose of persons of quality continue in their nurseries till fifteen,\r\nwhich answers to twenty-one with us; but the confinement is gradually\r\nlessened for the last three years.\r\n\r\nIn the female nurseries, the young girls of quality are educated much\r\nlike the males, only they are dressed by orderly servants of their own\r\nsex; but always in the presence of a professor or deputy, till they come\r\nto dress themselves, which is at five years old. And if it be found\r\nthat these nurses ever presume to entertain the girls with frightful or\r\nfoolish stories, or the common follies practiced by chambermaids among\r\nus, they are publicly whipped thrice about the city, imprisoned for a\r\nyear, and banished for life to the most desolate part of the country.\r\nThus the young ladies there are as much ashamed of being cowards and\r\nfools as the men, and despise all personal ornaments beyond decency and\r\ncleanliness. Neither did I perceive any difference in their education\r\nmade by their difference of sex, only that the exercises of the females\r\nwere not altogether so robust; and that some rules were given them\r\nrelating to domestic life, and a smaller compass of learning was enjoined\r\nthem: for their maxim is, that among people of quality, a wife should be\r\nalways a reasonable and agreeable companion, because she cannot always\r\nbe young. When the girls are twelve years old, which among them is the\r\nmarriageable age, their parents or guardians take them home with great\r\nexpressions of gratitude to the professors, and seldom without the tears\r\nof the young lady and her companions.\r\n\r\nIn the nurseries of females of the meaner sort, the children are\r\ninstructed in all kinds of work proper for their sex, and their several\r\ndegrees; those intended for apprentices are dismissed at nine years old,\r\nthe rest are kept to thirteen.\r\n\r\nThe meaner families who have children at these nurseries are obliged,\r\nbesides their annual pension, which is as low as possible, to return to\r\nthe steward of the nursery a small monthly share of their gettings, to\r\nbe a portion for the child; and therefore all parents are limited in\r\ntheir expenses by the law. For the Lilliputians think nothing can be more\r\nunjust, than for people, in subservience to their own appetites, to bring\r\nchildren into the world, and leave the burden of supporting them on the\r\npublic. As to persons of quality, they give security to appropriate a\r\ncertain sum for each child, suitable to their condition; and these funds\r\nare always managed with good husbandry and the most exact justice.\r\n\r\nThe cottagers and laborers keep their children at home, their business\r\nbeing to till and cultivate the earth, and therefore their education\r\nis of little consequence to the public; but the old and diseased among\r\nthem are supported by hospitals; for begging is a trade unknown in this\r\nkingdom.\r\n\r\nAnd here it may, perhaps, divert the curious reader, to give some account\r\nof my domestics, and my manner of living in this country, during a\r\nresidence of nine months and thirteen days. Having a head mechanically\r\nturned, and being likewise forced by necessity, I had made for myself a\r\ntable and chair convenient enough, out of the largest trees in the royal\r\npark. Two hundred seamstresses were employed to make me shirts, and\r\nlinen for my bed and table, all of the strongest and coarsest kind they\r\ncould get, which, however, they were forced to quilt together in several\r\nfolds, for the thickest was some degrees finer than lawn. Their linen is\r\nusually three inches wide, and three feet make a piece. The seamstresses\r\ntook my measure as I lay on the ground, one standing at my neck, and\r\nanother at my mid-leg, with a strong cord extended, that each held by the\r\nend, while a third measured the length of the cord with a rule an inch\r\nlong. Then they measured my right thumb, and desired no more; for by a\r\nmathematical computation, that twice round the thumb is once round the\r\nwrist, and so on to the neck and waist, and by the help of my old shirt,\r\nwhich I displayed on the ground before them for a pattern, they fitted me\r\nexactly. Three hundred tailors were employed in the same manner to make\r\nme clothes; but they had another contrivance for taking my measure. I\r\nkneeled down, and they raised a ladder from the ground to my neck; upon\r\nthis ladder one of them mounted, and let fall a plumb line from my collar\r\nto the floor, which just answered the length of my coat; but my waist and\r\narms I measured myself. When my clothes were finished, which was done\r\nin my house (for the largest of theirs would not have been able to hold\r\nthem) they looked like the patchwork made by the ladies in England, only\r\nthat mine were all of a color.\r\n\r\nI had three hundred cooks to dress my victuals, in little convenient huts\r\nbuilt about my house, where they and their families lived, and prepared\r\nme two dishes apiece. I took up twenty waiters in my hand, and placed\r\nthem on the table; a hundred more attended below on the ground, some with\r\ndishes of meat, and some with barrels of wine, and other liquors, slung\r\non their shoulders; all which the waiters above drew up as I wanted, in a\r\nvery ingenious manner by certain cords, as we draw a bucket up a well in\r\nEurope. A dish of their meat was a good mouthful, and a barrel of their\r\nliquor a reasonable draught. Their mutton yields to ours, but their beef\r\nis excellent. I have had a sirloin so large, that I have been forced to\r\nmake three bites of it; but this is rare. My servants were astonished to\r\nsee me eat it, bones and all, as in our country we do the leg of a lark.\r\nTheir geese and turkeys I usually ate at a mouthful, and I confess they\r\nfar exceed ours. Of their smaller fowl I could take up twenty or thirty\r\nat the end of my knife.\r\n\r\nOne day his imperial majesty, being informed of my way of living, desired\r\nthat himself and his royal consort, with the young princes of the blood\r\nof both sexes, might have the happiness, as he was pleased to call it, of\r\ndining with me. They came accordingly, and I placed them in chairs of\r\nstate on my table, just over against me, with their guards about them.\r\nFlimnap, the lord high-treasurer, attended there likewise, with his white\r\nstaff; and I observed he often looked on me with a sour countenance,\r\nwhich I would not seem to regard, but ate more than usual, in honor to my\r\ndear country, as well as to fill the court with admiration. I have some\r\nprivate reasons to believe that this visit from his majesty gave Flimnap\r\nan opportunity of doing me ill offices to his master. That minister had\r\nalways been my secret enemy, though he outwardly caressed me more than\r\nwas usual to the moroseness of his nature. He represented to the emperor\r\nthe low condition of his treasury; that he was forced to take up money at\r\ngreat discount; that exchequer bills would not circulate under nine per\r\ncent below par; that, in short, I had cost his majesty above a million\r\nand a half of _sprugs_ (their greatest gold coin, about the bigness of a\r\nspangle); and, upon the whole, it would be advisable in the emperor to\r\ntake the first fair occasion of dismissing me.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “_I have passed many an afternoon very agreeably in these\r\nconversations_”\r\n\r\n_Page 65_]\r\n\r\nI am here obliged to vindicate the reputation of an excellent lady, who\r\nwas an innocent sufferer on my account. The treasurer took a fancy to be\r\njealous of his wife, from the malice of some evil tongues, who informed\r\nhim that her grace had taken a violent affection for my person, and the\r\ncourt scandal ran for some time, that she once came privately to my\r\nlodging. This I solemnly declare to be a most infamous falsehood, without\r\nany grounds, farther than that her grace was pleased to treat me with\r\nall innocent marks of freedom and friendship. I own she came often to my\r\nhouse, but always publicly, nor ever without three more in the coach,\r\nwho were usually her sister and young daughter, and some particular\r\nacquaintance; but this was common to many other ladies of the court. And\r\nI still appeal to my servants round, whether they at any time saw a coach\r\nat my door without knowing what persons were in it. On these occasions,\r\nwhen a servant had given me notice, my custom was to go immediately to\r\nthe door; and after paying my respects, to take up the coach and two\r\nhorses very carefully in my hands (for, if there were six horses, the\r\npostilion always unharnessed four), and place them on a table, where I\r\nhad fixed a movable rim quite round, of five inches high, to prevent\r\naccidents; and I have often had four coaches and horses at once on my\r\ntable full of company, while I sat in my chair, leaning my face towards\r\nthem; and when I was engaged with one set, the coachman would gently\r\ndrive the others round my table. I have passed many an afternoon very\r\nagreeably in these conversations. But I defy the treasurer, or his two\r\ninformers (I will name them, and let ’em make the best of it), Clustril\r\nand Drunlo, to prove that any person ever came to me incognito, except\r\nthe secretary Reldresal, who was sent by express command of his imperial\r\nmajesty, as I have before related. I should not have dwelt so long upon\r\nthis particular, if it had not been a point wherein the reputation of a\r\ngreat lady is so nearly concerned, to say nothing of my own; though I\r\nhad then the honor to be a _nardac_, which the treasurer himself is not;\r\nfor all the world knows that he is only a _clumglum_, a title inferior\r\nby one degree, as that of a marquis is to a duke in England; although\r\nI allow he preceded me in right of his post. These false informations,\r\nwhich I afterwards came to the knowledge of by an accident not proper to\r\nmention, made Flimnap the treasurer show his lady for some time an ill\r\ncountenance, and me a worse; and although he was at last undeceived and\r\nreconciled to her, yet I lost all credit with him, and found my interest\r\ndecline very fast with the emperor himself, who was, indeed, too much\r\ngoverned by that favorite.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n    THE AUTHOR BEING INFORMED OF A DESIGN TO ACCUSE HIM OF HIGH\r\n    TREASON, MAKES HIS ESCAPE TO BLEFUSCU—HIS RECEPTION THERE.\r\n\r\n\r\nBefore I proceed to give an account of my leaving this kingdom, it may be\r\nproper to inform the reader of a private intrigue which had been for two\r\nmonths forming against me. I had been hitherto, all my life, a stranger\r\nto courts, for which I was unqualified by the meanness of my condition. I\r\nhad indeed heard and read enough of the dispositions of great princes and\r\nministers; but never expected to have found such terrible effects of them\r\nin so remote a country, governed, as I thought, by very different maxims\r\nfrom those in Europe.\r\n\r\nWhen I was just preparing to pay my attendance on the emperor of\r\nBlefuscu, a considerable person at court (to whom I had been very\r\nserviceable at a time when he lay under the highest displeasure of his\r\nimperial majesty), came to my house very privately at night, in a close\r\nchair, and, without sending his name, desired admittance. The chairmen\r\nwere dismissed: I put the chair, with his lordship in it, into my coat\r\npocket; and giving orders to a trusty servant to say I was indisposed\r\nand gone to sleep, I fastened the door of my house, placed the chair on\r\nthe table, according to my usual custom, and sat down by it. After the\r\ncommon salutations were over, observing his lordship’s countenance full\r\nof concern, and inquiring into the reason, he desired I would hear him\r\nwith patience in a matter that highly concerned my honor and my life. His\r\nspeech was to the following effect, for I took notes of it as soon as he\r\nleft me:\r\n\r\n“You are to know,” said he, “that several committees of council have been\r\nlately called, in the most private manner, on your account; and it is but\r\ntwo days since his majesty came to a full resolution.\r\n\r\n“You are very sensible that Skyresh Bolgolam (_galbet_, or high-admiral)\r\nhas been your mortal enemy almost ever since your arrival. His original\r\nreasons I know not; but his hatred is increased since your great success\r\nagainst Blefuscu, by which his glory as admiral is much obscured. This\r\nlord, in conjunction with Flimnap the high-treasurer, whose enmity\r\nagainst you is notorious on account of his lady, Limtoc the general,\r\nLalcon the chamberlain, and Balmuff the grand justiciary, have prepared\r\narticles of impeachment against you, for treason and other capital\r\ncrimes.”\r\n\r\nThis preface made me so impatient, being conscious of my own merits and\r\ninnocence, that I was going to interrupt him; when he entreated me to be\r\nsilent, and thus proceeded:\r\n\r\n“Out of gratitude for the favors you have done me, I procured information\r\nof the whole proceedings, and a copy of the articles; wherein I venture\r\nmy head for your service.”\r\n\r\n                      ARTICLES OF IMPEACHMENT\r\n                              AGAINST\r\n                QUINBUS FLESTRIN, THE MAN-MOUNTAIN\r\n\r\n                             ARTICLE I\r\n\r\n    That the said Quinbus Flestrin, having brought the imperial\r\n    fleet of Blefuscu into the royal port, and being afterwards\r\n    commanded by his imperial majesty to seize all the other\r\n    ships of the said empire of Blefuscu, and reduce that empire\r\n    to a province, to be governed by a viceroy from hence, and\r\n    to destroy and put to death not only all the Big-endian\r\n    exiles, but likewise all the people of that empire who would\r\n    not immediately forsake the Big-endian heresy; he, the said\r\n    Flestrin, like a false traitor against his most auspicious,\r\n    serene, imperial majesty, did petition to be excused from the\r\n    said service, upon pretence or unwillingness to force the\r\n    consciences, or destroy the liberties and lives of an innocent\r\n    people.\r\n\r\n                             ARTICLE 2\r\n\r\n    That whereas certain ambassadors arrived from the court of\r\n    Blefuscu to sue for peace in his majesty’s court, he, the\r\n    said Flestrin, did, like a false traitor, aid, abet, comfort,\r\n    and divert the said ambassadors, although he knew them to\r\n    be servants to a prince who was lately an open enemy to his\r\n    imperial majesty, and in an open war against his said majesty.\r\n\r\n                             ARTICLE 3\r\n\r\n    That the said Quinbus Flestrin, contrary to the duty of a\r\n    faithful subject, is now preparing to make a voyage to the\r\n    court and empire of Blefuscu, for which he has received only\r\n    verbal license from his imperial majesty, and, under color of\r\n    the said license does falsely and traitorously intend to take\r\n    the said voyage, and thereby to aid, comfort, and abet the\r\n    emperor of Blefuscu, so late an enemy, and in open war with his\r\n    imperial majesty aforesaid.\r\n\r\n    “There are some other articles; but these are the most\r\n    important, of which I have read you an abstract.\r\n\r\n    “In the several debates upon this impeachment, it must be\r\n    confessed that his majesty gave many marks of his great lenity,\r\n    often urging the services you had done him, and endeavoring to\r\n    extenuate your crimes. The treasurer and admiral insisted that\r\n    you should be put to the most painful and ignominious death by\r\n    setting fire to your house at night; and the general was to\r\n    attend with twenty thousand men, armed with poisoned arrows to\r\n    shoot you on the face and hands. Some of your servants were to\r\n    have private orders to strew a poisonous juice on your shirts,\r\n    which would soon make you tear your own flesh, and die in the\r\n    utmost torture. The general came into the same opinion, so\r\n    that for a long time there was a majority against you; but his\r\n    majesty, resolving, if possible, to spare your life, at last\r\n    brought off the chamberlain.\r\n\r\n    “Upon this incident, Reldresal, principal secretary for private\r\n    affairs, who always approved himself your true friend, was\r\n    commanded by the emperor to deliver his opinion, which he\r\n    accordingly did, and therein justified the good thoughts you\r\n    have of him. He allowed your crimes to be great, but that still\r\n    there was room for mercy, the most commendable virtue in a\r\n    prince, and for which his majesty was so justly celebrated.\r\n    He said the friendship between you and him was so well known\r\n    to the world that perhaps the most honorable board might\r\n    think him partial; however, in obedience to the command he\r\n    had received, he would freely offer his sentiments. That if\r\n    his majesty, in consideration of your services, and pursuant\r\n    to his own merciful disposition, would please to spare your\r\n    life, and only give orders to put out both your eyes, he humbly\r\n    conceived that, by this expedient, justice might in some\r\n    measure be satisfied, and all the world applaud the lenity of\r\n    the emperor, as well as the fair and generous proceedings of\r\n    those who have the honor to be his counselors. That the loss of\r\n    your eyes would be no impediment to your bodily strength, by\r\n    which you might still be useful to his majesty; that blindness\r\n    is an addition to courage, by concealing dangers from us; that\r\n    the fear you had for your eyes was the greatest difficulty in\r\n    bringing over the enemy’s fleet; and it would be sufficient for\r\n    you to see by the eyes of the ministers, since the greatest\r\n    princes do no more.\r\n\r\n    “This proposal was received with the utmost disapprobation by\r\n    the whole board. Bolgolam, the admiral, could not preserve\r\n    his temper; but, rising up in fury, said he wondered how the\r\n    secretary durst presume to give his opinion for preserving the\r\n    life of a traitor; that the services you had performed were,\r\n    by all true reasons of state, the great aggravation of your\r\n    crimes; that the same strength which enabled you to bring over\r\n    the enemy’s fleet, might serve, upon the first discontent, to\r\n    carry it back; that he had good reasons to think you were a\r\n    Big-endian in your heart; and, as treason begins in the heart\r\n    before it appears in overt acts, so he accused you as a traitor\r\n    on that account, and therefore insisted you should be put to\r\n    death.\r\n\r\n    “The treasurer was of the same opinion: he showed to what\r\n    straits his majesty’s revenue was reduced by the charge of\r\n    maintaining you, which would soon grow insupportable; that\r\n    the secretary’s expedient of putting out your eyes was so far\r\n    from being a remedy against this evil, that it would probably\r\n    increase it, as is manifest from the common practice of\r\n    blinding some kind of fowl, after which they fed the faster and\r\n    grew sooner fat; that his sacred majesty and the council, who\r\n    are your judges, were in their own consciences fully convinced\r\n    of your guilt, which was a sufficient argument to condemn you\r\n    to death, without the formal proofs required by the strict\r\n    letter of the law.\r\n\r\n    “But his imperial majesty, fully determined against capital\r\n    punishment, was graciously pleased to say, that since the\r\n    council thought the loss of your eyes too easy a censure,\r\n    some other may be inflicted hereafter. And your friend the\r\n    secretary, humbly desiring to be heard again, in answer to what\r\n    the treasurer had objected concerning the great charge his\r\n    majesty was at in maintaining you, said that his excellency,\r\n    who had the sole disposal of the emperor’s revenue, might\r\n    easily provide against that evil by gradually lessening your\r\n    establishment; by which, for want of sufficient food, you will\r\n    grow weak and faint, and lose your appetite, and consequently\r\n    decay and consume in a few months; neither would the stench\r\n    of your carcass be then so dangerous, when it should become\r\n    more than half diminished; and immediately upon your death,\r\n    five or six thousand of his majesty’s subjects might, in two\r\n    or three days, cut your flesh from your bones, take it away by\r\n    cartloads, and bury it in distant parts, to prevent infection,\r\n    leaving the skeleton as a monument of admiration to posterity.\r\n\r\n    “Thus by the great friendship of the secretary, the whole\r\n    affair was compromised. It was strictly enjoined that the\r\n    project of starving you by degrees should be kept a secret;\r\n    but the sentence of putting out your eyes was entered on the\r\n    books; none dissenting except Bolgolam the admiral, who, being\r\n    a creature of the empress, was perpetually instigated by her\r\n    majesty to insist upon your death, she having borne perpetual\r\n    malice against you.\r\n\r\n    “In three days your friend the secretary will be directed\r\n    to come to your house, and read before you the articles of\r\n    impeachment; and then to signify the great lenity and favor\r\n    of his majesty and council, whereby you are only condemned to\r\n    the loss of your eyes, which his majesty does not question\r\n    you will gratefully and humbly submit to; and twenty of his\r\n    majesty’s surgeons will attend, in order to see the operation\r\n    well performed, by discharging very sharp-pointed arrows into\r\n    the balls of your eyes, as you lie on the ground.\r\n\r\n    “I leave to your prudence what measures you will take; and to\r\n    avoid suspicion, I must immediately return in as private a\r\n    manner as I came.”\r\n\r\nHis lordship did so; and I remained alone, under many doubts and\r\nperplexities of mind.\r\n\r\nIt was a custom introduced by this prince and his ministry (very\r\ndifferent, as I have been assured, from the practices of former times),\r\nthat after the court had decreed any cruel execution, either to gratify\r\nthe monarch’s resentment, or the malice of a favorite, the emperor made a\r\nspeech to his whole council, expressing his great lenity and tenderness\r\nas qualities known and confessed by all the world. This speech was\r\nimmediately published through the kingdom; nor did anything terrify the\r\npeople so much as those encomiums on his majesty’s mercy; because it was\r\nobserved that the more these praises were enlarged and insisted on, the\r\nmore inhuman was the punishment, and the sufferer more innocent. And\r\nas to myself, I must confess, having never been designed for a courtier\r\neither by my birth or education, I was so ill a judge of things that I\r\ncould not discover the lenity and favor of this sentence, but conceived\r\nit (perhaps erroneously) rather to be rigorous than gentle. I sometimes\r\nthought of standing my trial; for, although I could not deny the facts\r\nalleged in the several articles, yet I hoped they would admit of some\r\nextenuations. But having in my life perused many state trials, which I\r\never observed to terminate as the judges thought fit to direct, I durst\r\nnot rely on so dangerous a decision, in so critical a juncture, and\r\nagainst such powerful enemies. Once I was strongly bent upon resistance;\r\nfor while I had liberty, the whole strength of that empire could hardly\r\nsubdue me, and I might easily with stones pelt the metropolis to pieces;\r\nbut I soon rejected that project with horror, by remembering the oath I\r\nhad made to the emperor, the favors I received from him, and the high\r\ntitle of _nardac_ he conferred upon me. Neither had I so soon learned the\r\ngratitude of courtiers, to persuade myself that his majesty’s present\r\nseverities quitted me of all past obligations.\r\n\r\nAt last I fixed upon a resolution for which it is probable I may incur\r\nsome censure, and not unjustly, for I confess I owe the preserving of\r\nmy eyes, and consequently my liberty, to my own great rashness and want\r\nof experience; because, if I had then known the nature of princes and\r\nministers, which I have since observed in many other courts, and their\r\nmethods of treating criminals less obnoxious than myself, I should with\r\ngreat alacrity and readiness have submitted to so easy a punishment.\r\nBut hurried on by the precipitancy of youth, and having his imperial\r\nmajesty’s license to pay my attendance upon the emperor of Blefuscu, I\r\ntook this opportunity, before the three days were elapsed, to send a\r\nletter to my friend the secretary signifying my resolution of setting\r\nout that morning for Blefuscu, pursuant to the leave I had got; and\r\nwithout waiting for an answer, I went to that side of the island where\r\nour fleet lay. I seized a large man of war, tied a cable to the prow, and\r\nlifting up the anchors, I stripped myself, put my clothes (together with\r\nmy coverlet, which I brought under my arm) into the vessel, and drawing\r\nit after me, between wading and swimming, arrived at the royal port of\r\nBlefuscu, where the people had long expected me; they lent me two guides\r\nto direct me to the capital city, which is of the same name. I held them\r\nin my hands till I came within two hundred yards of the gate, and desired\r\nthem to signify my arrival to one of the secretaries, and let him know I\r\nthere waited his majesty’s commands. I had an answer in about an hour,\r\nthat his majesty, attended by the royal family, and great officers of\r\nthe court, was coming out to receive me. I advanced a hundred yards. The\r\nemperor and his train alighted from their horses, the empress and ladies\r\nfrom their coaches, and I did not perceive they were in any fright or\r\nconcern. I lay on the ground to kiss his majesty’s and the empress’s\r\nhands. I told his majesty that I was come according to my promise, and\r\nwith the license of the emperor my master, to have the honor of seeing so\r\nmighty a monarch, and to offer him any service in my power, consistent\r\nwith my duty to my own prince; not mentioning a word of my disgrace,\r\nbecause I had hitherto no regular information of it, and might suppose\r\nmyself wholly ignorant of any such design; neither could I reasonably\r\nconceive that the emperor would discover the secret while I was out of\r\nhis power; wherein, however, it soon appeared I was deceived.\r\n\r\nI shall not trouble the reader with the particular account of my\r\nreception at this court, which was suitable to the generosity of so great\r\na prince; nor of the difficulties I was in for want of a house and bed,\r\nbeing forced to lie on the ground, wrapped up in my coverlet.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n    THE AUTHOR, BY A LUCKY ACCIDENT, FINDS MEANS TO LEAVE BLEFUSCU;\r\n    AND, AFTER SOME DIFFICULTIES, RETURNS SAFE TO HIS NATIVE\r\n    COUNTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThree days after my arrival, walking out of curiosity to the northeast\r\ncoast of the island, I observed, about half a league off in the sea,\r\nsomewhat that looked like a boat overturned. I pulled off my shoes and\r\nstockings, and wading two or three hundred yards, I found the object to\r\napproach nearer by force of the tide; and then plainly saw it to be a\r\nreal boat, which I supposed might by some tempest have been driven from\r\na ship; whereupon I returned immediately towards the city, and desired\r\nhis imperial majesty to lend me twenty of the tallest vessels he had\r\nleft after the loss of his fleet, and three thousand seamen, under the\r\ncommand of his vice-admiral. This fleet sailed round, while I went back\r\nthe shortest way to the coast where I first discovered the boat. I found\r\nthe tide had driven it still nearer. The seamen were all provided with\r\ncordage, which I had beforehand twisted to a sufficient strength. When\r\nthe ships came up, I stripped myself, and waded till I came within a\r\nhundred yards of the boat, after which I was forced to swim till I got\r\nup to it. The seamen threw me the end of the cord, which I fastened to a\r\nhole in the fore part of the boat, and the other end to a man of war; but\r\nI found all my labor to little purpose; for, being out of my depth, I was\r\nnot able to work. In this necessity I was forced to swim behind, and push\r\nthe boat forward as often as I could, with one of my hands; and the tide\r\nfavoring me, I advanced so far that I could just hold up my chin and\r\nfeel the ground. I rested two or three minutes, and then gave the boat\r\nanother shove, and so on, till the sea was no higher than my arm-pits;\r\nand now the most laborious part being over, I took out my other cables,\r\nwhich were stowed in one of the ships, and fastening them first to the\r\nboat, and then to nine of the vessels which attended me; the wind being\r\nfavorable, the seamen towed, and I shoved, until we arrived within forty\r\nyards of the shore, and waiting till the tide was out, I got dry to the\r\nboat, and by the assistance of two thousand men with ropes and engines,\r\nI made a shift to turn it on its bottom, and found it was but little\r\ndamaged.\r\n\r\nI shall not trouble the reader with the difficulties I was under by\r\nthe help of certain paddles, which cost me ten days’ making, to get my\r\nboat to the royal port of Blefuscu, where a mighty concourse of people\r\nappeared upon my arrival, full of wonder at the sight of so prodigious\r\na vessel. I told the emperor that my good fortune had thrown this boat\r\nin my way, to carry me to some place whence I might return into my\r\nnative country; and begged his majesty’s orders for getting materials to\r\nfit it up, together with his license to depart; which, after some kind\r\nexpostulations, he was pleased to grant.\r\n\r\nI did very much wonder, in all this time, not to have heard of any\r\nexpress relating to me from our emperor to the court of Blefuscu. But I\r\nwas afterwards given privately to understand that his imperial majesty,\r\nnever imagining I had the least notice of his designs, believed I was\r\nonly gone to Blefuscu in performance of my promise, according to the\r\nlicense he had given me, which was well known at our court, and would\r\nreturn in a few days, when that ceremony was ended. But he was at last\r\nin pain at my long absence; and after consulting with the treasurer and\r\nthe rest of that cabal, a person of quality was dispatched with the copy\r\nof the articles against me. This envoy had instructions to represent to\r\nthe monarch of Blefuscu, the great lenity of his master, who was content\r\nto punish me no further than with the loss of my eyes; that I had fled\r\nfrom justice, and if I did not return in two hours, I should be deprived\r\nof my title of nardac and declared a traitor. The envoy further added,\r\nthat in order to maintain the peace and amity between both empires, his\r\nmaster expected that his brother of Blefuscu would give orders to have me\r\nsent back to Lilliput, bound hand and foot, to be punished as a traitor.\r\n\r\nThe emperor of Blefuscu, having taken three days to consult, returned an\r\nanswer consisting of many civilities and excuses. He said that, as for\r\nsending me bound, his brother knew it was impossible; that although I\r\nhad deprived him of his fleet, yet he owed great obligations to me for\r\nmany good offices I had done him in making the peace. That, however, both\r\ntheir majesties would soon be made easy; for I had found a prodigious\r\nvessel on the shore, able to carry me on the sea, which he had given\r\norders to fit up, with my own assistance and direction; and he hoped\r\nin a few weeks both empires would be freed from so insupportable an\r\nincumbrance.\r\n\r\nWith this answer the envoy returned to Lilliput, and the monarch of\r\nBlefuscu related to me all that had passed, offering me at the same time\r\n(but under the strictest confidence) his gracious protection if I would\r\ncontinue in his service; wherein, although I believed him sincere, yet I\r\nresolved never more to put any confidence in princes or ministers, where\r\nI could possibly avoid it; and therefore, with all due acknowledgments\r\nfor his favorable intentions, I humbly begged to be excused. I told him\r\nthat since fortune, whether good or evil, had thrown a vessel in my way,\r\nI was resolved to venture myself on the ocean, rather than be an occasion\r\nof difference between two such mighty monarchs. Neither did I find the\r\nemperor at all displeased; and I discovered, by a certain accident, that\r\nhe was very glad of my resolution, and so were most of his ministers.\r\n\r\nThese considerations moved me to hasten my departure somewhat sooner than\r\nI intended; to which the court, impatient to have me gone, very readily\r\ncontributed. Five hundred workmen were employed to make two sails to my\r\nboat, according to my directions, by quilting thirteen folds of their\r\nstrongest linen together. I was at the pains of making ropes and cables,\r\nby twisting ten, twenty, or thirty of the thickest and strongest of\r\ntheirs. A great stone that I happened to find, after a long search, by\r\nthe seashore, served me for an anchor. I had the tallow of three hundred\r\ncows for greasing my boat, and other uses. I was at incredible pains in\r\ncutting down some of the largest timber trees for oars and masts, wherein\r\nI was, however, much assisted by his majesty’s ship-carpenters, who\r\nhelped me in smoothing them, after I had done the rough work.\r\n\r\nIn about a month, when all was prepared, I sent to receive his majesty’s\r\ncommands, and to take my leave. The emperor and royal family came out\r\nof the palace; I lay down on my face to kiss his hand, which he very\r\ngraciously gave me; so did the empress and young princess of the blood.\r\nHis majesty presented me with fifty purses of two hundred _sprugs_\r\napiece, together with his picture at full length, which I put immediately\r\ninto one of my gloves, to keep it from being hurt. The ceremonies at my\r\ndeparture were too many to trouble the reader with at this time.\r\n\r\nI stored the boat with the carcasses of a hundred oxen and three hundred\r\nsheep, with bread and drink proportionable, and as much meat ready\r\ndressed as four hundred cooks could provide. I took with me six cows and\r\ntwo bulls alive, with as many ewes and rams, intending to carry them\r\ninto my own country and propagate the breed; and to feed them on board,\r\nI had a good bundle of hay and a bag of corn. I would gladly have taken\r\na dozen of the natives, but this was a thing the emperor would by no\r\nmeans permit; and besides a diligent search into my pockets, his majesty\r\nengaged my honor not to carry away any of his subjects, although with\r\ntheir own consent and desire.\r\n\r\nHaving thus prepared all things as well as I was able, I set sail on\r\nthe twenty-fourth day of September, 1701, at six in the morning; and\r\nwhen I had gone about four leagues to the northward, the wind being at\r\nsoutheast, at six in the evening I descried a small island about half a\r\nleague to the northwest. I advanced forward, and cast anchor on the lee\r\nside of the island, which seemed to be uninhabited. I then took some\r\nrefreshment and went to my rest. I slept well, and I conjecture at least\r\nsix hours, for I found the day broke in two hours after I awaked. It was\r\na clear night. I ate my breakfast before the sun was up, and heaving\r\nanchor, the wind being favorable, I steered the same course that I had\r\ndone the day before, wherein I was directed by my pocket compass. My\r\nintention was to reach, if possible, one of those islands which I had\r\nreason to believe lay to the northeast of Van Diemen’s Land. I discovered\r\nnothing all that day; but upon the next, about three in the afternoon,\r\nwhen I had by my computation made twenty-four leagues from Blefuscu, I\r\ndescried a sail steering to the southeast; my course was due east. I\r\nhailed her, but could get no answer; yet I found I gained upon her, for\r\nthe wind slackened. I made all the sail I could, and in half an hour she\r\nspied me, then hung out her ancient, and discharged a gun. It is not\r\neasy to express the joy I was in, upon the unexpected hope of once more\r\nseeing my beloved country and the dear pledges I had left in it. The\r\nship slackened her sails, and I came up with her between five and six in\r\nthe evening, September twenty-sixth; but my heart leaped within me to\r\nsee her English colors. I put my cows and sheep into my coat pockets and\r\ngot on board with all my little cargo of provisions. The vessel was an\r\nEnglish merchantman returning from Japan by the North and South seas; the\r\ncaptain, Mr. John Biddel of Deptford, a very civil man and an excellent\r\nsailor. We were now in the latitude of 30 degrees south. There were about\r\nfifty men in the ship; and here I met an old comrade of mine, one Peter\r\nWilliams, who gave me a good character to the captain. This gentleman\r\ntreated me with kindness and desired I would let him know what place I\r\ncame from last, and whither I was bound; which I did in few words, but he\r\nthought I was raving, and that the dangers I underwent had disturbed my\r\nhead; whereupon I took my black cattle and sheep out of my pocket, which,\r\nafter great astonishment, clearly convinced him of my veracity. I then\r\nshowed him the gold given me by the emperor of Blefuscu, together with\r\nhis majesty’s picture at full length, and some other rarities of that\r\ncountry. I gave him two purses of two hundred _sprugs_ each, and promised\r\nwhen we arrived in England to make him a present of a cow and a sheep big\r\nwith young.\r\n\r\nI shall not trouble the reader with a particular account of this voyage,\r\nwhich was very prosperous for the most part. We arrived in the Downs on\r\nthe 13th of April, 1702. I had only one misfortune, that the rats on\r\nboard carried away one of my sheep; I found her bones in a hole, picked\r\nclean from the flesh. The rest of my cattle I got safe on shore, and\r\nset them a-grazing on a bowling green at Greenwich, where the fineness\r\nof the grass made them feed very heartily, though I had always feared\r\nthe contrary: neither could I possibly have preserved them in so long a\r\nvoyage if the captain had not allowed me some of his best biscuit, which,\r\nrubbed to powder and mingled with water, was their constant food. The\r\nshort time I continued in England I made a considerable profit by showing\r\nmy cattle to many persons of quality and others; and before I began my\r\nsecond voyage I sold them for six hundred pounds. Since my last return I\r\nfind the breed is considerably increased, especially the sheep; which I\r\nhope will prove much to the advantage of the woolen manufacture, by the\r\nfineness of the fleeces.\r\n\r\nI stayed but two months with my wife and family, for my insatiable desire\r\nof seeing foreign countries would suffer me to continue no longer. I\r\nleft fifteen hundred pounds with my wife, and fixed her in a good house\r\nat Redriff. My remaining stock I carried with me, part in money and part\r\nin goods, in hopes to improve my fortunes. My eldest uncle, John, had\r\nleft me an estate in land near Epping of about thirty pounds a year, and\r\nI had a long lease of the Black Bull in Fetter Lane, which yielded me\r\nas much more; so that I was not in any danger of leaving my family upon\r\nthe parish. My son Johnny, named so after his uncle, was at the grammar\r\nschool, and a towardly child. My daughter Betty (who is now well married\r\nand has children) was then at her needlework. I took leave of my wife and\r\nboy and girl with tears on both sides, and went on board the Adventure,\r\na merchant ship of three hundred tons, bound for Surat, Captain John\r\nNicholas of Liverpool, commander. But my account of this voyage must be\r\nreferred to the Second Part of my travels.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END OF THE FIRST PART.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA VOYAGE TO BROBDINGNAG\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n    A GREAT STORM DESCRIBED; THE LONGBOAT SENT TO FETCH WATER;\r\n    THE AUTHOR GOES WITH IT TO DISCOVER THE COUNTRY—HE IS LEFT\r\n    ON SHORE; IS SEIZED BY ONE OF THE NATIVES, AND CARRIED TO A\r\n    FARMER’S HOUSE— HIS RECEPTION THERE, WITH SEVERAL ACCIDENTS\r\n    THAT HAPPENED TO HIM—A DESCRIPTION OF THE INHABITANTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving been condemned by nature and fortune to an active and restless\r\nlife, in two months after my return I again left my native country\r\nand took shipping in the Downs on the 20th day of June, 1702, in the\r\nAdventure, Captain John Nicholas, a Cornishman, commander, bound for\r\nSurat. We had a very prosperous gale till we arrived at the Cape of\r\nGood Hope, where we landed for fresh water; but discovering a leak, we\r\nunshipped our goods and wintered there; for the captain falling sick of\r\nan ague, we could not leave the Cape till the end of March. We then set\r\nsail, and had a good voyage till we passed the straits of Madagascar;\r\nbut having got northward of that island, and to about five degrees south\r\nlatitude, the winds, which in those seas are observed to blow a constant\r\nequal gale between the north and west from the beginning of December\r\nto the beginning of May, on the 19th of April began to blow with much\r\ngreater violence and more westerly than usual, continuing so for twenty\r\ndays together; during which time we were driven a little to the east of\r\nthe Molucca Islands, and about three degrees northward of the line, as\r\nour captain found by an observation he took the 2d of May, at which time\r\nthe wind ceased, and it was a perfect calm; whereat I was not a little\r\nrejoiced. But he, being a man well experienced in the navigation of those\r\nseas, bid us all prepare against a storm, which accordingly happened on\r\nthe day following; for a southern wind, called the southern monsoon,\r\nbegan to set in.\r\n\r\nFinding it was like to overblow, we took in our spritsail, and stood by\r\nto hand the foresail; but making foul weather, we looked if the guns\r\nwere all fast, and handed the mizzen. The ship lay very broad off, so we\r\nthought it better spooning before the sea, than trying or hulling. We\r\nreefed the foresail and set him, and hauled aft the foresheet; the helm\r\nwas hard a-weather. The ship wore bravely. We belayed the fore-downhaul;\r\nbut the sail was split, and we hauled down the yard and got the sail\r\ninto the ship, and unbound all the things clear of it. It was a very\r\nfierce storm; the sea broke strange and dangerous. We hauled off upon the\r\nlanyard of the whipstaff and helped the man at helm. We would not get\r\ndown our topmast, but let all stand, because she scudded before the sea\r\nvery well, and we knew that the topmast being aloft, the ship was the\r\nwholesomer and made better way through the sea, seeing we had sea room.\r\nWhen the storm was over we set foresail and mainsail and brought the ship\r\nto. Then we set the mizzen, main-topsail and the fore-topsail. Our course\r\nwas east-north-east, the wind was at southwest. We got the starboard\r\ntacks aboard; we cast off our weather braces and lifts; we set in the lee\r\nbraces and hauled forward by the weather bowlings, and hauled them tight,\r\nand belayed them, and hauled over the mizzen-tack to windward, and kept\r\nher full and by as near as she would lie.\r\n\r\nDuring this storm, which was followed by a strong wind west-south-west,\r\nwe were carried, by my computation, about five hundred leagues to the\r\neast, so that the oldest sailor on board could not tell in what part of\r\nthe world we were. Our provisions held out well, our ship was stanch, and\r\nour crew all in good health; but we lay in the utmost distress for water.\r\nWe thought it best to hold on the same course rather than turn more\r\nnortherly, which might have brought us to the northwest parts of Great\r\nTartary and into the Frozen Sea.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th day of June, 1703, a boy on the topmast discovered land. On\r\nthe 17th we came in full view of a great island, or continent (for we\r\nknew not whether), on the south side whereof was a small neck of land\r\njutting out into the sea, and a creek too shallow to hold a ship of above\r\none hundred tons. We cast anchor within a league of this creek, and our\r\ncaptain sent a dozen of his men well armed in the longboat, with vessels\r\nfor water, if any could be found. I desired his leave to go with them,\r\nthat I might see the country and make what discoveries I could. When we\r\ncame to land we saw no river or spring, nor any sign of inhabitants. Our\r\nmen therefore wandered on the shore to find out some fresh water near the\r\nsea, and I walked alone about a mile on the other side, where I observed\r\nthe country all barren and rocky. I now began to be weary, and seeing\r\nnothing to entertain my curiosity, I returned gently down towards the\r\ncreek; and the sea being full in my view, I saw our men already got into\r\nthe boat and rowing for life to the ship. I was going to holla after\r\nthem, although it had been to little purpose, when I observed a huge\r\ncreature walking after them in the sea, as fast as he could; he waded\r\nnot much deeper than his knees, and took prodigious strides. But our\r\nmen had the start of him half a league, and the sea thereabouts being\r\nfull of sharp-pointed rocks, the monster was not able to overtake the\r\nboat. This I was afterwards told, for I durst not stay to see the issue\r\nof that adventure, but ran as fast as I could the way I first went, and\r\nthen climbed up a steep hill which gave me some prospect of the country.\r\nI found it fully cultivated; but that which first surprised me was the\r\nlength of the grass, which, in those grounds that seemed to be kept for\r\nhay, was above twenty feet high.\r\n\r\nI fell into a highroad, for so I took it to be, though it served to the\r\ninhabitants only as a footpath through a field of barley. Here I walked\r\non for some time, but could see little on either side, it being now\r\nnear harvest, and the corn rising at least forty feet. I was an hour\r\nwalking to the end of this field, which was fenced in with a hedge of at\r\nleast one hundred and twenty feet high, and the trees so lofty that I\r\ncould make no computation of their altitude. There was a stile to pass\r\nfrom this field into the next. It had four steps, and a stone to cross\r\nover when you came to the uppermost. It was impossible for me to climb\r\nthis stile, because every step was six feet high, and the upper stone\r\nabove twenty. I was endeavoring to find some gap in the hedge, when I\r\ndiscovered one of the inhabitants in the next field advancing towards\r\nthe stile, of the same size with him whom I saw in the sea pursuing our\r\nboat. He appeared as tall as an ordinary spire steeple, and took about\r\nten yards at every stride, as near as I could guess. I was struck with\r\nthe utmost fear and astonishment, and ran to hide myself in the corn,\r\nwhence I saw him at the top of the stile looking back into the next field\r\non the right hand, and heard him call in a voice many degrees louder than\r\na speaking trumpet; but the noise was so high in the air, that at first I\r\ncertainly thought it was thunder. Whereupon seven monsters like himself\r\ncame towards him with reaping hooks in their hands, each hook about the\r\nlargeness of six scythes. These people were not so well clad as the\r\nfirst, whose servants or laborers they seemed to be; for, upon some words\r\nhe spoke, they went to reap the corn in the field where I lay. I kept\r\nfrom them at as great a distance as I could, but was forced to move with\r\nextreme difficulty, for the stalks of the corn were sometimes not above\r\na foot distant, so that I could hardly squeeze my body betwixt them.\r\nHowever, I made a shift to go forward till I came to a part of the field\r\nwhere the corn had been laid by the rain and wind. Here it was impossible\r\nfor me to advance a step; for the stalks were so interwoven that I\r\ncould not creep through, and the beards of the fallen ears so strong\r\nand pointed that they pierced through my clothes into my flesh. At the\r\nsame time I heard the reapers not above a hundred yards behind me. Being\r\nquite dispirited with toil, and wholly overcome by grief and despair, I\r\nlay down between two ridges, and heartily wished I might there end my\r\ndays. I bemoaned my desolate widow and fatherless children. I lamented\r\nmy own folly and willfulness in attempting a second voyage against the\r\nadvice of all my friends and relations. In this terrible agitation of\r\nmind I could not forbear thinking of Lilliput, whose inhabitants looked\r\nupon me as the greatest prodigy that ever appeared in the world; where\r\nI was able to draw an imperial fleet in my hand, and perform those\r\nother actions which will be recorded forever in the chronicles of that\r\nempire, while posterity shall hardly believe them, although attested by\r\nmillions. I reflected what a mortification it must prove to me to appear\r\nas inconsiderable in this nation as one single Lilliputian would be among\r\nus. But this I conceived was to be the least of my misfortunes; for, as\r\nhuman creatures are observed to be more savage and cruel in proportion to\r\ntheir bulk, what could I expect but to be a morsel in the mouth of the\r\nfirst among these enormous barbarians that should happen to seize me?\r\nUndoubtedly philosophers are in the right when they tell us that nothing\r\nis great or little otherwise than by comparison. It might have pleased\r\nfortune to let the Lilliputians find some nation where the people were as\r\ndiminutive with respect to them, as they were to me. And who knows but\r\nthat even this prodigious race of mortals might be equally overmatched\r\nin some distant part of the world, whereof we have yet no discovery?\r\nScared and confounded as I was, I could not forbear going on with these\r\nreflections, when one of the reapers approaching within ten yards of the\r\nridge where I lay, made me apprehend that with the next step I should be\r\nsquashed to death under his foot, or cut in two with his reaping hook.\r\nAnd therefore when he was again about to move, I screamed as loud as fear\r\ncould make me; whereupon the huge creature trod short, and looking round\r\nabout under him for some time, at last espied me as I lay on the ground.\r\nHe considered awhile, with the caution of one who endeavors to lay hold\r\non a small dangerous animal in such a manner that it shall not be\r\nable either to scratch or to bite him, as I myself have sometimes done\r\nwith a weasel in England. At length he ventured to take me up behind,\r\nby the middle, between his forefinger and thumb, and brought me within\r\nthree yards of his eyes, that he might behold my shape more perfectly.\r\nI guessed his meaning, and my good fortune gave me so much presence of\r\nmind, that I resolved not to struggle in the least as he held me in the\r\nair above sixty feet from the ground, although he grievously pinched\r\nmy sides, for fear I should slip through his fingers. All I ventured\r\nwas to raise my eyes towards the sun and place my hands together in a\r\nsupplicating posture, and to speak some words in a humble melancholy\r\ntone, suitable to the condition I then was in; for I apprehended every\r\nmoment that he would dash me against the ground, as we usually do any\r\nlittle hateful animal which we have a mind to destroy. But my good star\r\nwould have it, that he appeared pleased with my voice and gestures, and\r\nbegan to look upon me as a curiosity, much wondering to hear me pronounce\r\narticulate words, although he could not understand them. In the meantime\r\nI was not able to forbear groaning and shedding tears, and turning\r\nmy head towards my sides; letting him know, as well as I could, how\r\ncruelly I was hurt by the pressure of his thumb and finger. He seemed to\r\napprehend my meaning; for, lifting up the lappet of his coat, he put me\r\ngently into it, and immediately ran along with me to his master, who was\r\na substantial farmer, and the same person I had first seen in the field.\r\n\r\nThe farmer having (as I supposed by their talk) received such an account\r\nof me as his servant could give him, took a piece of a small straw, about\r\nthe size of a walking staff, and therewith lifted up the lappets of\r\nmy coat, which, it seems, he thought to be some kind of covering that\r\nnature had given me. He blew my hair aside to take a better view of my\r\nface. He called his hands about him, and asked them, as I afterwards\r\nlearned, whether they had ever seen in the fields any little creature\r\nthat resembled me. He then placed me softly on the ground upon all fours,\r\nbut I got immediately up, and walked slowly backwards and forwards, to\r\nlet those people see I had no intent to run away. They all sat down in a\r\ncircle about me, the better to observe my motions. I pulled off my hat,\r\nand made a low bow towards the farmer. I fell on my knees, and lifted up\r\nmy hands and eyes, and spoke several words as loud as I could. I took\r\na purse of gold out of my pocket, and humbly presented it to him. He\r\nreceived it on the palm of his hand, then applied it close to his eye to\r\nsee what it was, and afterwards turned it several times with the point of\r\na pin (which he took out of his sleeve), but could make nothing of it.\r\nWhereupon I made a sign that he should place his hand on the ground. I\r\nthen took the purse, and opening it, poured all the gold into his palm.\r\nThere were six Spanish pieces of four pistoles each, besides twenty or\r\nthirty smaller coins. I saw him wet the tip of his little finger upon\r\nhis tongue, and take up one of my largest pieces, and then another, but\r\nhe seemed to be wholly ignorant what they were. He made me a sign to put\r\nthem again into my purse, and the purse again into my pocket, which after\r\noffering it to him several times, I thought it best to do.\r\n\r\nThe farmer by this time was convinced I must be a rational creature.\r\nHe spoke often to me, but the sound of his voice pierced my ears like\r\nthat of a watermill, yet his words were articulate enough. I answered as\r\nloud as I could in several languages, and he often laid his ear within\r\ntwo yards of me, but all in vain, for we were wholly unintelligible to\r\neach other. He then sent his servants to their work, and taking his\r\nhandkerchief out of his pocket, he doubled and spread it on his left\r\nhand, which he placed flat on the ground with the palm upwards, making\r\nme a sign to step into it, as I could easily do, for it was not above\r\na foot in thickness. I thought it my part to obey, and, for fear of\r\nfalling, laid myself at full length upon the handkerchief, with the\r\nremainder of which he lapped me up to the head for further security, and\r\nin this manner carried me home to his house. There he called his wife,\r\nand showed me to her; but she screamed and ran back, as women in England\r\ndo at the sight of a toad or a spider. However, when she had awhile seen\r\nmy behavior, and how well I observed the signs her husband made, she was\r\nsoon reconciled, and by degrees grew extremely tender of me.\r\n\r\nIt was about twelve at noon and a servant brought in dinner. It was\r\nonly one substantial dish of meat (fit for the plain condition of a\r\nhusbandman), in a dish of about four-and-twenty feet diameter. The\r\ncompany were the farmer and his wife, three children, and an old\r\ngrandmother. When they were sat down, the farmer placed me at some\r\ndistance from him on the table, which was thirty feet high from the\r\nfloor. I was in a terrible fright, and kept as far as I could from the\r\nedge for fear of falling. The wife minced a bit of meat, then crumbled\r\nsome bread on a trencher, and placed it before me. I made her a low bow,\r\ntook out my knife and fork, and fell to eat, which gave them exceeding\r\ndelight. The mistress sent her maid for a small dram cup, which held\r\nabout three gallons, and filled it with drink; I took up the vessel\r\nwith much difficulty in both hands, and in a most respectful manner\r\ndrank to her ladyship’s health, expressing the words as loud as I could\r\nin English, which made the company laugh so heartily that I was almost\r\ndeafened with the noise. This liquor tasted like a small cider, and was\r\nnot unpleasant. Then the master made me a sign to come to his trencher\r\nside; but as I walked on the table, being in great surprise all the time,\r\nas the indulgent reader will easily conceive and excuse, I happened\r\nto stumble against a crust, and fell flat on my face, but received no\r\nhurt. I got up immediately, and observing the good people to be in much\r\nconcern, I took my hat (which I held under my arm out of good manners),\r\nand waving it over my head, gave three huzzas, to show I had got no\r\nmischief by my fall. But advancing forwards towards my master (as I shall\r\nhenceforth call him), his youngest son, who sat next to him, an arch boy\r\nof about ten years old, took me up by the legs, and held me so high in\r\nthe air that I trembled in every limb; but his father snatched me from\r\nhim, and at the same time gave him such a box on the left ear as would\r\nhave felled a European troop of horse to the earth, ordering him to be\r\ntaken from the table. But being afraid the boy might owe me a spite, and\r\nwell remembering how mischievous all children among us naturally are to\r\nsparrows, rabbits, young kittens, and puppy dogs, I fell on my knees, and\r\npointing to the boy, made my master to understand as well as I could,\r\nthat I desired his son might be pardoned. The father complied, and the\r\nlad took his seat again, whereupon I went to him and kissed his hand,\r\nwhich my master took, and made him stroke me gently with it.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of dinner, my mistress’s favorite cat leaped into her lap.\r\nI heard a noise behind me like that of a dozen stocking weavers at work;\r\nand turning my head, I found it proceeded from the purring of this\r\nanimal, who seemed to be three times larger than an ox, as I computed\r\nby the view of her head, and one of her paws, while her mistress was\r\nfeeding and stroking her. The fierceness of this creature’s countenance\r\naltogether discomposed me, though I stood at the further end of the\r\ntable, above fifty feet off; and though my mistress held her fast,\r\nfor fear she might give a spring, and seize me in her talons. But it\r\nhappened there was no danger, for the cat took not the least notice of me\r\nwhen my master placed me within three yards of her. And as I have been\r\nalways told, and found true by experience in my travels, that flying,\r\nor discovering fear, before a fierce animal is a certain way to make it\r\npursue or attack you; so I resolved, in this dangerous juncture, to show\r\nno manner of concern. I walked with intrepidity five or six times before\r\nthe very head of the cat, and came within half a yard of her; whereupon\r\nshe drew herself back, as if she were more afraid of me. I had less\r\napprehension concerning the dogs, whereof three or four came into the\r\nroom, as it is usual in farmers’ houses; one of which was a mastiff equal\r\nin bulk to four elephants, and a grey-hound somewhat taller than the\r\nmastiff, but not so large.\r\n\r\nWhen dinner was almost done, the nurse came in with a child of a year old\r\nin her arms, who immediately spied me, and began a squall that you might\r\nhave heard from London Bridge to Chelsea, after the usual oratory of\r\ninfants, to get me for a plaything. The mother, out of pure indulgence,\r\ntook me up, and put me towards the child, who presently seized me by the\r\nmiddle, and got my head in his mouth, where I roared so loud that the\r\nurchin was frighted, and let me drop; and I should infallibly have broke\r\nmy neck, if the mother had not held her apron under me. The nurse, to\r\nquiet her babe, made use of a rattle, which was a kind of hollow vessel\r\nfilled with great stones, and fastened by a cable to the child’s waist;\r\nbut all in vain, so that she was forced to apply the last remedy by\r\ngiving it suck. I must confess no object ever disgusted me so much as the\r\nsight of her monstrous breast, which I cannot tell what to compare with,\r\nso as to give the curious reader an idea of its bulk, shape, and color. I\r\nhad a near sight of her, she sitting down the more conveniently to give\r\nsuck, and I standing on the table. This made me reflect upon the fair\r\nskins of our English ladies, who appear so beautiful to us only because\r\nthey are of our own size, and their defects not to be seen but through\r\na magnifying glass; where we find by experiment that the smoothest and\r\nwhitest skins look rough and coarse, and ill colored.\r\n\r\nI remember when I was at Lilliput, the complexions of those diminutive\r\npeople appeared to me the fairest in the world; and talking upon this\r\nsubject with a person of learning there, who was an intimate friend of\r\nmine, he said that my face appeared much fairer and smoother when he\r\nlooked on me from the ground, than it did upon a nearer view when I took\r\nhim up in my hand and brought him close, which he confessed was at first\r\na very shocking sight. He said he could discover great holes in my skin;\r\nthat the stumps of my beard were ten times stronger than the bristles\r\nof a boar, and my complexion made up of several colors, altogether\r\ndisagreeable. Although I must beg leave to say for myself, that I am as\r\nfair as most of my sex and country, and very little sunburned by all my\r\ntravels. On the other side, discoursing of the ladies in that emperor’s\r\ncourt, he used to tell me one had freckles, another too wide a mouth, a\r\nthird too large a nose; nothing of which I was able to distinguish. I\r\nconfess this reflection was obvious enough; which, however, I could not\r\nforbear, lest the reader might think those vast creatures were actually\r\ndeformed: for I must do them the justice to say they are a comely race\r\nof people; and particularly the features of my master’s countenance,\r\nalthough he were but a farmer, when I beheld him from the height of sixty\r\nfeet, appeared very well proportioned.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “_These horrible animals had the boldness to attack me on\r\nboth sides_”\r\n\r\n_Page 98_]\r\n\r\nWhen dinner was done, my master went out to his laborers, and as I could\r\ndiscover by his voice and gesture, gave his wife a strict charge to\r\ntake care of me. I was very much tired and disposed to sleep, which my\r\nmistress perceiving, she put me on her own bed, and covered me with a\r\nclean white handkerchief, but larger and coarser than the mainsail of a\r\nman of war.\r\n\r\nI slept about two hours, and dreamed I was at home with my wife and\r\nchildren, which aggravated my sorrows when I awaked and found myself\r\nalone in a vast room, between two and three hundred feet wide, and above\r\ntwo hundred high, lying in a bed twenty yards wide. My mistress was gone\r\nabout her household affairs, and had locked me in. The bed was eight\r\nyards from the floor. While I was under these circumstances, two rats\r\ncrept up the curtains, and ran smelling backwards and forwards on the\r\nbed. One of them came up almost to my face, whereupon I rose in a fright,\r\nand drew out my hanger to defend myself. These horrible animals had the\r\nboldness to attack me on both sides, and one of them held his forefeet at\r\nmy collar; but I had the good fortune to rip up his belly before he could\r\ndo me any mischief. He fell down at my feet, and the other, seeing the\r\nfate of his comrade, made his escape, but not without one good wound on\r\nthe back, which I gave him as he fled, and made the blood run trickling\r\nfrom him. After this exploit I walked gently to and fro on the bed, to\r\nrecover my breath and loss of spirits. These creatures were of the size\r\nof a large mastiff, but infinitely more nimble and fierce; so that if I\r\nhad taken off my belt before I went to sleep, I must have infallibly been\r\ntorn to pieces and devoured. I measured the tail of the dead rat, and\r\nfound it to be two yards long, wanting an inch; but it went against my\r\nstomach to drag the carcass off the bed, where it lay still bleeding. I\r\nobserved it had yet some life, but with a strong slash across the neck I\r\nthoroughly dispatched it.\r\n\r\nSoon after, my mistress came into the room, who seeing me all bloody, ran\r\nand took me up in her hand. I pointed to the dead rat, smiling and making\r\nother signs to show I was not hurt, whereat she was extremely rejoiced,\r\ncalling the maid to take up the dead rat with a pair of tongs, and throw\r\nit out of the window. Then she set me on a table, where I showed her my\r\nhanger all bloody, and wiping it on the lappet of my coat returned it to\r\nthe scabbard.\r\n\r\nI hope the gentle reader will excuse me for dwelling on particulars,\r\nwhich, however insignificant they may appear to groveling vulgar minds,\r\nyet will certainly help a philosopher to enlarge his thoughts and\r\nimagination, and apply them to the benefit of public as well as private\r\nlife, which was my sole design in presenting this and other accounts of\r\nmy travels to the world; wherein I have been chiefly studious of truth,\r\nwithout affecting any ornaments of learning or of style. But the whole\r\nscene of this voyage made so strong an impression on my mind, and is so\r\ndeeply fixed in my memory, that in committing it to paper I did not omit\r\none material circumstance; however, upon a strict review, I blotted out\r\nseveral passages of less moment which were in my first copy, for fear\r\nof being censured as tedious and trifling, whereof travelers are often,\r\nperhaps not without justice, accused.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n    A DESCRIPTION OF THE FARMER’S DAUGHTER—THE AUTHOR CARRIED TO A\r\n    MARKET TOWN, AND THEN TO THE METROPOLIS—THE PARTICULARS OF HIS\r\n    JOURNEY.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy mistress had a daughter of nine years old, a child of forward parts\r\nfor her age, very dexterous at her needle, and skillful in dressing her\r\nbaby. Her mother and she contrived to fit up the baby’s cradle for me\r\nagainst night. The cradle was put into a small drawer of a cabinet, and\r\nthe drawer placed upon a hanging shelf for fear of the rats. This was my\r\nbed all the time I stayed with those people, though made more convenient\r\nby degrees, as I began to learn their language and make my wants known.\r\nThis young girl was so handy, that after I had once or twice pulled off\r\nmy clothes before her, she was able to dress and undress me, though I\r\nnever gave her that trouble when she would let me do either myself. She\r\nmade me seven shirts, and some other linen, of as fine cloth as could be\r\ngot, which indeed was coarser than sackcloth; and these she constantly\r\nwashed for me with her own hands. She was likewise my school-mistress,\r\nto teach me the language; when I pointed to anything, she told me the\r\nname of it in her own tongue, so that in a few days I was able to call\r\nfor whatever I had a mind to. She was very good-natured, and not above\r\nforty feet high, being little for her age. She gave me the name of\r\nGrildrig, which the family took up, and afterwards the whole kingdom.\r\nThe word imports what the Latins call _nanunculus_, the Italians\r\n_homunceletino_, and the English _mannikin_. To her I chiefly owe my\r\npreservation in that country; we never parted while I was there; I called\r\nher my Glumdalclitch, or little nurse; and I should be guilty of great\r\ningratitude if I omitted this honorable mention of her care and affection\r\ntowards me, which I heartily wish it lay in my power to requite as she\r\ndeserves, instead of being the innocent but unhappy instrument of her\r\ndisgrace, as I have too much reason to fear.\r\n\r\nIt now began to be known and talked of in the neighborhood, that my\r\nmaster had found a strange animal in the field, about the bigness of a\r\n_splacknuck_, but exactly shaped in every part like a human creature;\r\nwhich it likewise imitated in all its actions; seemed to speak in a\r\nlittle language of its own, had already learned several words of theirs,\r\nwent erect upon two legs, was tame and gentle, would come when it was\r\ncalled, do whatever it was bid, had the finest limbs in the world, and a\r\ncomplexion fairer than a nobleman’s daughter of three years old. Another\r\nfarmer, who lived hard by, and was a particular friend of my master,\r\ncame on a visit on purpose to inquire into the truth of this story. I\r\nwas immediately produced and placed upon a table, where I walked as I\r\nwas commanded, drew my hanger, put it up again, made my reverence to my\r\nmaster’s guest, asked him in his own language how he did, and told him\r\nhe was welcome, just as my little nurse had instructed me. This man, who\r\nwas old and dim-sighted, put on his spectacles to behold me better; at\r\nwhich I could not forbear laughing very heartily, for his eyes appeared\r\nlike the full moon shining into a chamber at two windows. Our people,\r\nwho discovered the cause of my mirth, bore me company in laughing, at\r\nwhich the old fellow was fool enough to be angry and out of countenance.\r\nHe had the character of a great miser; and, to my misfortune, he well\r\ndeserved it by the cursed advice he gave my master to show me as a sight\r\nupon a market day in the next town, which was half an hour’s riding,\r\nabout two-and-twenty miles from our house. I guessed there was some\r\nmischief contriving, when I observed my master and his friend whispering\r\nlong together, sometimes pointing at me; and my fears made me fancy that\r\nI overheard and understood some of their words. But the next morning\r\nGlumdalclitch, my little nurse, told me the whole matter, which she had\r\ncunningly picked out from her mother. The poor girl laid me on her bosom,\r\nand fell a-weeping with shame and grief. She apprehended some mischief\r\nwould happen to me from rude vulgar folks, who might squeeze me to death\r\nor break one of my limbs by taking me in their hands. She had also\r\nobserved how modest I was in my nature, how nicely I regarded my honor,\r\nand what an indignity I should conceive it to be exposed for money as a\r\npublic spectacle to the meanest of the people. She said, her papa and\r\nmamma had promised that Grildrig should be hers; but now she found they\r\nmeant to serve her as they did last year, when they pretended to give\r\nher a lamb, and yet, as soon as it was fat, sold it to a butcher. For my\r\nown part, I may truly affirm that I was less concerned than my nurse. I\r\nhad a strong hope which never left me, that I should one day recover my\r\nliberty; and as to the ignominy of being carried about for a monster,\r\nI considered myself to be a perfect stranger in the country, and that\r\nsuch a misfortune could never be charged upon me as a reproach if ever I\r\nshould return to England; since the king of Great Britain himself, in my\r\ncondition, must have undergone the same distress.\r\n\r\nMy master, pursuant to the advice of his friend, carried me in a box\r\nthe next market day to the neighboring town, and took along with him\r\nhis little daughter, my nurse, upon a pillion behind him. The box was\r\nclose on every side, with a little door for me to go in and out, and a\r\nfew gimlet holes to let in air. The girl had been so careful as to put\r\nthe quilt of her baby’s bed into it for me to lie down on. However, I\r\nwas terribly shaken and discomposed in this journey, though it were but\r\nof half an hour; for the horse went about forty feet at every step, and\r\ntrotted so high, that the agitation was equal to the rising and falling\r\nof a ship in a great storm, but much more frequent. Our journey was\r\nsomewhat further than from London to St. Albans. My master alighted\r\nat an inn which he used to frequent; and after consulting awhile with\r\nthe innkeeper, and making some necessary preparations, he hired the\r\n_grultrud_, or crier, to give notice through the town of a strange\r\ncreature to be seen at the sign of the Green Eagle, not so big as a\r\n_splacknuck_ (an animal in that country very finely shaped, about six\r\nfeet long), and in every part of the body resembling a human creature,\r\ncould speak several words, and perform a hundred diverting tricks.\r\n\r\nI was placed upon a table in the largest room of the inn, which might\r\nbe near three hundred feet square. My little nurse stood on a low stool\r\nclose to the table, to take care of me, and direct what I should do. My\r\nmaster, to avoid a crowd, would suffer only thirty people at a time to\r\nsee me. I walked about on the table as the girl commanded; she asked me\r\nquestions as far as she knew my understanding of the language reached,\r\nand I answered them as loud as I could. I turned about several times\r\nto the company, paid my humble respects, said they were welcome, and\r\nused some other speeches I had been taught. I took up a thimble filled\r\nwith liquor, which Glumdalclitch had given me for a cup, and drank their\r\nhealth. I drew out my hanger, and flourished with it after the manner of\r\nfencers in England. My nurse gave me part of a straw, which I exercised\r\nas a pike, having learned the art in my youth. I was that day shown\r\nto twelve sets of company, and as often forced to go over again with\r\nthe same fopperies, till I was half dead with weariness and vexation;\r\nfor those who had seen me made such wonderful reports, that the people\r\nwere ready to break down the doors to come in. My master, for his own\r\ninterest, would not suffer any one to touch me except my nurse; and to\r\nprevent danger, benches were set round the table at such a distance as\r\nto put me out of everybody’s reach. However, an unlucky schoolboy aimed\r\na hazelnut directly at my head, which very narrowly missed me; otherwise\r\nit came with so much violence that it would have infallibly knocked out\r\nmy brains, for it was almost as large as a small pumpkin; but I had the\r\nsatisfaction to see the young rogue well beaten, and turned out of the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\nMy master gave public notice that he would show me again the next market\r\nday; and in the meantime he prepared a more convenient vehicle for me,\r\nwhich he had reason enough to do; for I was so tired with my first\r\njourney, and with entertaining company for eight hours together, that I\r\ncould hardly stand upon my legs, or speak a word. It was at least three\r\ndays before I recovered my strength; and that I might have no rest at\r\nhome, all the neighboring gentlemen from a hundred miles round, hearing\r\nof my fame, came to see me at my master’s own house. There could not\r\nbe fewer than thirty persons with their wives and children (for the\r\ncountry is very populous); and my master demanded the rate of a full room\r\nwhenever he showed me at home, although it were only to a single family;\r\nso that for some time I had but little ease every day of the week (except\r\nWednesday, which is their Sabbath), although I were not carried to the\r\ntown.\r\n\r\nMy master, finding how profitable I was like to be, resolved to carry me\r\nto the most considerable cities of the kingdom. Having therefore provided\r\nhimself with all things necessary for a long journey, and settled his\r\naffairs at home, he took leave of his wife, and upon the 17th of August,\r\n1703, about two months after my arrival, we set out for the metropolis,\r\nsituated near the middle of that empire, and about three thousand miles’\r\ndistance from our house. My master made his daughter Glumdalclitch ride\r\nbehind him. She carried me on her lap in a box tied about her waist. The\r\ngirl had lined it on all sides with the softest cloth she could get, well\r\nquilted underneath, furnished it with her baby’s bed, provided me with\r\nlinen and other necessaries, and made everything as convenient as she\r\ncould. We had no other company but a boy of the house, who rode after us\r\nwith the luggage.\r\n\r\nMy master’s design was to show me in all the towns by the way, and to\r\nstep out of the road, for fifty or a hundred miles, to any village\r\nor person of quality’s house where he might expect custom. We made\r\neasy journeys, of not above seven or eight score miles a day; for\r\nGlumdalclitch, on purpose to spare me, complained she was tired with the\r\ntrotting of the horse. She often took me out of my box at my own desire,\r\nto give me air, and show me the country, but always held me fast by a\r\nleading string. We passed over five or six rivers many degrees broader\r\nand deeper than the Nile or the Ganges; and there was hardly a rivulet so\r\nsmall as the Thames at London Bridge. We were ten weeks in our journey,\r\nand I was shown in eighteen large towns, besides many villages and\r\nprivate families.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th day of October we arrived at the metropolis, called in their\r\nlanguage Lorbrulgrud, or Pride of the Universe. My master took a lodging\r\nin the principal street of the city, not far from the royal palace, and\r\nput out bills in the usual form, containing an exact description of my\r\nperson and parts. He hired a large room between three and four hundred\r\nfeet wide. He provided a table sixty feet in diameter, upon which I\r\nwas to act my part, and palisadoed round three feet from the edge, and\r\nas many high, to prevent my falling over. I was shown ten times a day,\r\nto the wonder and satisfaction of all people. I could now speak the\r\nlanguage tolerably well, and perfectly understood every word that was\r\nspoken to me. Besides, I had learned their alphabet, and could make a\r\nshift to explain a sentence here and there; for Glumdalclitch had been\r\nmy instructor while we were at home, and at leisure hours during our\r\njourney. She carried a little book in her pocket, not much larger than\r\na Sanson’s Atlas; it was a common treatise for the use of young girls,\r\ngiving a short account of their religion; out of this she taught me my\r\nletters, and interpreted the words.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n    THE AUTHOR SENT FOR TO COURT—THE QUEEN BUYS HIM OF HIS MASTER,\r\n    THE FARMER, AND PRESENTS HIM TO THE KING—HE DISPUTES WITH HIS\r\n    MAJESTY’S GREAT SCHOLARS—AN APARTMENT AT COURT PROVIDED FOR THE\r\n    AUTHOR—HE IS IN HIGH FAVOR WITH THE QUEEN—HE STANDS UP FOR THE\r\n    HONOR OF HIS OWN COUNTRY—HIS QUARRELS WITH THE QUEEN’S DWARF.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe frequent labors I underwent every day made in a few weeks a very\r\nconsiderable change in my health. The more my master got by me, the more\r\ninsatiable he grew. I had quite lost my stomach, and was almost reduced\r\nto a skeleton. The farmer observed it, and concluding I must soon die,\r\nresolved to make as good a hand of me as he could. While he was thus\r\nreasoning and resolving with himself, a _slardral_, or gentleman usher,\r\ncame from court, commanding my master to carry me immediately thither for\r\nthe diversion of the queen and her ladies. Some of the latter had already\r\nbeen to see me, and reported strange things of my beauty, behavior, and\r\ngood sense. Her majesty and those who attended her were beyond measure\r\ndelighted with my demeanor. I fell on my knees, and begged the honor of\r\nkissing her imperial foot; but this gracious princess held out her little\r\nfinger towards me (after I was set on a table) which I embraced in both\r\nmy arms, and put the tip of it with the utmost respect to my lip. She\r\nmade me some general questions about my country and my travels, which I\r\nanswered as distinctly and in as few words as I could. She asked whether\r\nI would be content to live at court. I bowed down to the board of the\r\ntable, and humbly answered that I was my master’s slave, but if I were\r\nat my own disposal, I should be proud to devote my life to her majesty’s\r\nservice. She then asked my master whether he were willing to sell me at\r\na good price. He, who apprehended I could not live a month, was ready\r\nenough to part with me, and demanded a thousand pieces of gold, which\r\nwere ordered him on the spot, each piece being about the bigness of eight\r\nhundred moidores; but allowing for the proportion of all things between\r\nthat country and Europe, and the high price of gold among them, was\r\nhardly so great a sum as a thousand guineas would be in England. I then\r\nsaid to the queen, since I was now her majesty’s most humble creature and\r\nvassal, I must beg the favor that Glumdalclitch, who had always tended me\r\nwith so much care and kindness, and understood to do it so well, might be\r\nadmitted into her service, and continue to be my nurse and instructor.\r\nHer majesty agreed to my petition, and easily got the farmer’s consent,\r\nwho was glad enough to have his daughter preferred at court; and the\r\npoor girl herself was not able to hide her joy. My late master withdrew,\r\nbidding me farewell, and saying he had left me in a good service; to\r\nwhich I replied not a word, only making him a slight bow.\r\n\r\nThe queen observed my coldness, and, when the farmer was gone out of the\r\napartment, asked me the reason. I made bold to tell her majesty that I\r\nowed no other obligation to my late master than his not dashing out the\r\nbrains of a poor harmless creature found by chance in his field, which\r\nobligation was amply recompensed by the gain he had made in showing me\r\nthrough half the kingdom, and the price he had now sold me for. That\r\nthe life I had since led was laborious enough to kill an animal of ten\r\ntimes my strength. That my health was much impaired by the continual\r\ndrudgery of entertaining the rabble every hour of the day; and that\r\nif my master had not thought my life in danger, her majesty, perhaps,\r\nwould not have got so cheap a bargain. But as I was out of all fear\r\nof being ill treated, under the protection of so great and good an\r\nempress, the ornament of nature, the darling of the world, the delight\r\nof her subjects, the phœnix of the creation; so I hoped my late master’s\r\napprehensions would appear to be groundless, for I already found my\r\nspirits to revive by the influence of her most august presence.\r\n\r\nThis was the sum of my speech, delivered with great improprieties and\r\nhesitation. The latter part was altogether framed in the style peculiar\r\nto that people, whereof I learned some phrases from Glumdalclitch, while\r\nshe was carrying me to court.\r\n\r\nThe queen, giving great allowance for my defectiveness in speaking, was,\r\nhowever, surprised at so much wit and good sense in so diminutive an\r\nanimal. She took me in her own hand, and carried me to the king, who was\r\nthen retired to his cabinet. His majesty, a prince of much gravity and\r\naustere countenance, not well observing my shape at first view, asked\r\nthe queen, after a cold manner, how long it was since she grew fond of a\r\n_splacknuck_; for such it seems he took me to be, as I lay upon my breast\r\nin her majesty’s right hand. But this princess, who has an infinite\r\ndeal of wit and humor, set me gently on my feet upon the scrutoire, and\r\ncommanded me to give his majesty an account of myself, which I did in a\r\nvery few words; and Glumdalclitch, who attended at the cabinet door, and\r\ncould not endure I should be out of her sight, being admitted, confirmed\r\nall that had passed from my arrival at her father’s house.\r\n\r\nThe king, although he be as learned a person as any in his dominions,\r\nand had been educated in the study of philosophy, and particularly\r\nmathematics; yet when he observed my shape exactly, and saw me walk\r\nerect, before I began to speak conceived I might be a piece of clockwork\r\n(which is in that country arrived to a very great perfection) contrived\r\nby some ingenious artist. But when he heard my voice and found what\r\nI delivered to be regular and rational, he could not conceal his\r\nastonishment. He was by no means satisfied with the relation I gave him\r\nof the manner I came into his kingdom, but thought it a story concerted\r\nbetween Glumdalclitch and her father, who had taught me a set of words\r\nto make me sell at a higher price. Upon this imagination he put several\r\nother questions to me, and still received rational answers, no otherwise\r\ndefective than by a foreign accent, and an imperfect knowledge in the\r\nlanguage, with some rustic phrases which I had learned at the farmer’s\r\nhouse, and did not suit the polite style of a court.\r\n\r\nHis majesty sent for three great scholars who were then in their weekly\r\nwaiting, according to the custom of that country. These gentlemen, after\r\nthey had awhile examined my shape with much nicety, were of different\r\nopinions concerning me. They all agreed that I could not be produced\r\naccording to the regular laws of nature, because I was not framed with\r\na capacity of preserving my life, either by swiftness, or climbing of\r\ntrees, or digging holes in the earth. They observed by my teeth, which\r\nthey viewed with great exactness, that I was a carnivorous animal;\r\nyet most quadrupeds being an overmatch for me, and field mice, with\r\nsome others, too nimble, they could not imagine how I should be able\r\nto support myself, unless I fed upon snails and other insects, which\r\nthey offered, by many learned arguments, to evince that I could not\r\npossibly do. One of these virtuosi seemed to think that I might be an\r\nembryo, or abortive birth. But this opinion was rejected by the other\r\ntwo, who observed my limbs to be perfect and finished, and that I had\r\nlived several years, as it was manifested from my beard, the stumps\r\nwhereof they plainly discovered through a magnifying glass. They would\r\nnot allow me to be a dwarf, because my littleness was beyond all degrees\r\nof comparison; for the queen’s favorite dwarf, the smallest ever known\r\nin that kingdom, was near thirty feet high. After much debate, they\r\nconcluded unanimously that I was only _relplum scalcath_, which is,\r\ninterpreted literally, _lusus naturæ_; a determination exactly agreeable\r\nto the modern philosophy of Europe, whose professors, disdaining the old\r\nevasion of occult causes, whereby the followers of Aristotle endeavor in\r\nvain to disguise their ignorance, have invented this wonderful solution\r\nof all difficulties, to the unspeakable advancement of human knowledge.\r\n\r\nAfter this decisive conclusion, I entreated to be heard a word or two.\r\nI applied myself to the king, and assured his majesty that I came from\r\na country which abounded with several millions of both sexes, and of my\r\nown stature; where the animals, trees, and houses were all in proportion,\r\nand where, by consequence, I might be as able to defend myself, and\r\nto find sustenance, as any of his majesty’s subjects could do here;\r\nwhich I took for a full answer to those gentlemen’s arguments. To this\r\nthey only replied with a smile of contempt, saying that the farmer had\r\ninstructed me very well in my lesson. The king, who had a much better\r\nunderstanding, dismissing his learned men, sent for the farmer, who\r\nby good fortune was not yet gone out of town. Having therefore first\r\nexamined him privately, and then confronted him with me and the young\r\ngirl, his majesty began to think that what we told him might possibly\r\nbe true. He desired the queen to order that a particular care should be\r\ntaken of me; and was of opinion that Glumdalclitch should still continue\r\nin her office of tending me, because he observed we had a great affection\r\nfor each other. A convenient apartment was provided for her at court;\r\nshe had a sort of governess appointed to take care of her education, a\r\nmaid to dress her, and two other servants for menial offices; but the\r\ncare of me was wholly appropriated to herself. The queen commanded her\r\nown cabinetmaker to contrive a box that might serve me for a bedchamber,\r\nafter the model that Glumdalclitch and I should agree upon. This man was\r\na most ingenious artist, and according to my directions, in three weeks\r\nfinished for me a wooden chamber of sixteen feet square, and twelve high,\r\nwith sash windows, a door, and two closets, like a London bedchamber. The\r\nboard that made the ceiling was to be lifted up and down by two hinges,\r\nto put in a bed ready furnished by her majesty’s upholsterer, which\r\nGlumdalclitch took out every day to air, made it with her own hands, and\r\nletting it down at night, locked up the roof over me. A nice workman,\r\nwho was famous for little curiosities, undertook to make me two chairs,\r\nwith backs and frames, of a substance not unlike ivory, and two tables,\r\nwith a cabinet to put my things in. The room was quilted on all sides,\r\nas well as the floor and the ceiling, to prevent any accident from the\r\ncarelessness of those who carried me, and to break the force of a jolt\r\nwhen I went in a coach. I desired a lock for my door, to prevent rats and\r\nmice from coming in. The smith, after several attempts, made the smallest\r\nthat ever was seen among them, for I have known a larger at the gate\r\nof a gentleman’s house in England. I made a shift to keep the key in a\r\npocket of my own, fearing Glumdalclitch might lose it. The queen likewise\r\nordered the thinnest silks that could be gotten, to make me clothes,\r\nnot much thicker than an English blanket, very cumbersome till I was\r\naccustomed to them. They were after the fashion of the kingdom, partly\r\nresembling the Persian, and partly the Chinese, and are a very grave\r\ndecent habit.\r\n\r\nThe queen became so fond of my company that she could not dine without\r\nme. I had a table placed upon the same at which her majesty ate, just at\r\nher left elbow, and a chair to sit on. Glumdalclitch stood on a stool\r\non the floor, near my table, to assist and take care of me. I had an\r\nentire set of silver dishes and plates, and other necessaries, which\r\nin proportion to those of the queen, were not much bigger than what I\r\nhave seen of the same kind in a London toy-shop, for the furniture of a\r\nbaby-house; these my little nurse kept in her pocket in a silver box,\r\nand gave me at meals as I wanted them, always cleaning them herself.\r\nNo person dined with the queen but the two princesses royal, the elder\r\nsixteen years old, and the younger at that time thirteen and a month. Her\r\nmajesty used to put a bit of meat upon one of my dishes, out of which I\r\ncarved for myself; and her diversion was to see me eat in miniature; for\r\nthe queen (who had indeed but a weak stomach) took up at one mouthful as\r\nmuch as a dozen English farmers could eat at a meal, which to me was for\r\nsome time a very nauseous sight. She would crunch the wing of a lark,\r\nbones and all, between her teeth, although it were nine times as large\r\nas that of a full-grown turkey; and put a bit of bread in her mouth, as\r\nbig as two twelve-penny loaves. She drank out of a golden cup, above a\r\nhogshead at a draught. Her knives were twice as long as a scythe set\r\nstraight upon the handle; the spoons, forks, and other instruments were\r\nall in the same proportion. I remember when Glumdalclitch carried me, out\r\nof curiosity, to see some of the tables at court, where ten or a dozen of\r\nthese enormous knives and forks were lifted up together, I thought I had\r\nnever till then beheld so terrible a sight.\r\n\r\nIt is the custom that every Wednesday (which, as I have observed, is\r\ntheir Sabbath) the king and queen, with the royal issue of both sexes,\r\ndine together in the apartment of his majesty, to whom I was now become\r\na great favorite; and at these times my little chair and table were\r\nplaced at his left hand before one of the salt-cellars. This prince took\r\na pleasure in conversing with me, inquiring into the manners, religion,\r\nlaws, government, and learning of Europe, wherein I gave him the best\r\naccount I was able. His apprehension was so clear and his judgment so\r\nexact that he made very wise reflections and observations upon all I\r\nsaid. But I confess that after I had been a little too copious in talking\r\nof my own beloved country, of our trade and wars by sea and land, of our\r\nschisms in religion, and parties in the state, the prejudices of his\r\neducation prevailed so far that he could not forbear taking me up in his\r\nright hand and stroking me gently with the other, after a hearty fit of\r\nlaughing, asked me whether I were a Whig or a Tory. Then turning to his\r\nfirst minister, who waited behind him with a white staff, near as tall as\r\nthe mainmast of the Royal Sovereign, he observed how contemptible a thing\r\nwas human grandeur, which could be mimicked by such diminutive insects as\r\nI. “And yet,” said he, “I dare engage these creatures have their titles\r\nand distinctions of honor; they contrive little nests and burrows, that\r\nthey call houses and cities; they make a figure in dress and equipage;\r\nthey love, they fight, they dispute, they cheat, they betray.” And\r\nthus he continued on, while my color came and went several times with\r\nindignation to hear our noble country, the mistress of arts and arms, the\r\nscourge of France, the arbitress of Europe, the seat of virtue, piety,\r\nhonor, and truth, the pride and envy of the world, so contemptuously\r\ntreated.\r\n\r\nBut as I was not in a condition to resent injuries, so upon mature\r\nthoughts I began to doubt whether I were injured or no. For, after\r\nhaving been accustomed several months to the sight and converse of this\r\npeople, and observed every object upon which I cast my eyes to be of\r\nproportionable magnitude, the horror I had at first conceived from their\r\nbulk and aspect was so far worn off that if I had then beheld a company\r\nof English lords and ladies in their finery and birthday clothes, acting\r\ntheir several parts in the most courtly manner of strutting, and bowing,\r\nand prating, to say the truth, I should have been strongly tempted to\r\nlaugh as much at them as the king and his grandees did at me. Neither,\r\nindeed, could I forbear smiling at myself when the queen used to place\r\nme upon her hand towards a looking-glass, by which both our persons\r\nappeared before me in full view together; and there could nothing be more\r\nridiculous than the comparison; so that I really began to imagine myself\r\ndwindled many degrees below my usual size.\r\n\r\nNothing angered and mortified me so much as the queen’s dwarf, who,\r\nbeing of the lowest stature that was ever in that country (for I verily\r\nthink he was not full thirty feet high), became so insolent at seeing\r\na creature so much beneath him, that he would always affect to swagger\r\nand look big as he passed by me in the queen’s antechamber, while I was\r\nstanding on some table talking with the lords or ladies of the court,\r\nand he seldom failed of a small word or two upon my littleness; against\r\nwhich I could only revenge myself by calling him brother, challenging\r\nhim to wrestle, and such repartees as are usual in the mouths of court\r\npages. One day at dinner, this malicious little cub was so nettled with\r\nsomething I had said to him, that, raising himself upon the frame of her\r\nmajesty’s chair, he took me up by the middle, as I was sitting down, not\r\nthinking any harm, and let me drop into a large silver bowl of cream,\r\nand then ran away as fast as he could. I fell over head and ears, and\r\nif I had not been a good swimmer it might have gone very hard with me;\r\nfor Glumdalclitch in that instant happened to be at the other end of the\r\nroom, and the queen was in such a fright that she wanted presence of mind\r\nto assist me. But my little nurse ran to my relief, and took me out,\r\nafter I had swallowed above a quart of cream. I was put to bed; however,\r\nI received no other damage than the loss of a suit of clothes, which\r\nwas utterly spoiled. The dwarf was soundly whipped, and as a further\r\npunishment, forced to drink up the bowl of cream into which he had thrown\r\nme. Neither was he ever restored to favor; for soon after the queen\r\nbestowed him on a lady of high quality, so that I saw him no more, to my\r\nvery great satisfaction: for I could not tell to what extremity such a\r\nmalicious urchin might have carried his resentment.\r\n\r\nHe had before served me a scurvy trick, which set the queen a-laughing,\r\nalthough at the same time she were heartily vexed, and would have\r\nimmediately cashiered him, if I had not been so generous as to intercede.\r\nHer majesty had taken a marrowbone upon her plate, and, after knocking\r\nout the marrow, placed the bone again on the dish erect, as it stood\r\nbefore; the dwarf, watching his opportunity, while Glumdalclitch was gone\r\nto the sideboard, mounted upon the stool she stood on to take care of\r\nme at meals, took me up in both hands, and squeezing my legs together,\r\nwedged them into the marrowbone above my waist, where I stuck for some\r\ntime, and made a very ridiculous figure. I believe it was near a minute\r\nbefore any one knew what was become of me, for I thought it below me to\r\ncry out. But, as princes seldom get their meat hot, my legs were not\r\nscalded, only my stockings and breeches in a sad condition. The dwarf, at\r\nmy entreaty, had no other punishment than a sound whipping.\r\n\r\nI was frequently rallied by the queen upon account of my fearfulness; and\r\nshe used to ask me whether the people of my country were as great cowards\r\nas myself! The occasion was this: The kingdom is much pestered with flies\r\nin summer; and these odious insects, each of them as big as a Dunstable\r\nlark, hardly gave me any rest while I sat at dinner, with their continual\r\nhumming and buzzing about my ears. They would sometimes alight upon my\r\nvictuals. Sometimes they would fix upon my nose or forehead, where they\r\nstung me to the quick, smelling very offensively; and I could easily\r\ntrace that viscous matter which, our naturalists tell us, enables those\r\ncreatures to walk with their feet upwards upon a ceiling. I had much ado\r\nto defend myself against these detestable animals, and could not forbear\r\nstarting when they came on my face. It was the common practice of the\r\ndwarf to catch a number of these insects in his hand, as schoolboys do\r\namong us, and let them out suddenly under my nose, on purpose to frighten\r\nme, and divert the queen. My remedy was to cut them in pieces with my\r\nknife as they flew in the air, wherein my dexterity was much admired.\r\n\r\nI remember one morning when Glumdalclitch had set me in my box upon a\r\nwindow, as she usually did in fair days to give me air (for I durst not\r\nventure to let the box be hung on a nail out of the window, as we do\r\nwith cages in England), after I had lifted up one of my sashes, and sat\r\ndown at my table to eat a piece of sweet cake for my breakfast, above\r\ntwenty wasps, allured by the smell, came flying into the room, humming\r\nlouder than the drones of as many bagpipes. Some of them seized my cake\r\nand carried it piecemeal away; others flew about my head and face,\r\nconfounding me with the noise, and putting me in the utmost terror of\r\ntheir stings. However, I had the courage to rise and draw my hanger,\r\nand attack them in the air. I dispatched four of them, but the rest got\r\naway, and I presently shut my window. These creatures were as large as\r\npartridges; I took out their stings, found them an inch and a half long,\r\nand as sharp as needles. I carefully preserved them all; and having since\r\nshown them, with some other curiosities, in several parts of Europe, upon\r\nmy return to England I gave three of them to Gresham College and kept the\r\nfourth for myself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n    THE COUNTRY DESCRIBED—A PROPOSAL FOR CORRECTING MODERN MAPS—THE\r\n    KING’S PALACE, AND SOME ACCOUNT OF THE METROPOLIS—THE AUTHOR’S\r\n    WAY OF TRAVELING—THE CHIEF TEMPLE DESCRIBED.\r\n\r\n\r\nI now intend to give the reader a short description of this country, as\r\nfar as I traveled in it, which was not above two thousand miles round\r\nLorbrulgrud, the metropolis. For the queen, whom I always attended,\r\nnever went further when she accompanied the king in his progresses, and\r\nthere stayed till his majesty returned from viewing his frontiers. The\r\nwhole extent of this prince’s dominions reaching about six thousand\r\nmiles in length, and from three to five in breadth; from whence I cannot\r\nbut conclude that our geographers of Europe are in a great error, by\r\nsupposing nothing but sea between Japan and California; for it was ever\r\nmy opinion that there must be a balance of earth to counterpoise the\r\ngreat continent of Tartary; and therefore they ought to correct their\r\nmaps and charts by joining this vast tract of land to the northwest parts\r\nof America, wherein I shall be ready to lend them my assistance.\r\n\r\nThe kingdom is a peninsula, terminated to the northeast by a ridge of\r\nmountains thirty miles high, which are altogether impassable, by reason\r\nof the volcanoes upon the tops; neither do the most learned know what\r\nsort of mortals inhabit beyond those mountains, or whether they be\r\ninhabited at all. On the three other sides, it is bounded by the ocean.\r\nThere is not one seaport in the whole kingdom; and those parts of the\r\ncoasts into which the rivers issue, are so full of pointed rocks, and the\r\nsea generally so rough, that there is no venturing with the smallest of\r\ntheir boats; so that these people are wholly excluded from any commerce\r\nwith the rest of the world. But the large rivers are full of vessels, and\r\nabound with excellent fish; for they seldom get any from the sea, because\r\nthe sea fish are of the same size with those in Europe, and consequently\r\nnot worth catching; whereby it is manifest, that nature, in the\r\nproduction of plants and animals of so extraordinary a bulk, is wholly\r\nconfined to this continent, of which I leave the reasons to be determined\r\nby philosophers. However, now and then they take a whale that happens to\r\nbe dashed against the rocks, which the common people feed on heartily.\r\nThese whales I have known so large, that a man could hardly carry one\r\nupon his shoulders; and sometimes, for curiosity, they are brought in\r\nhampers to Lorbrulgrud; I saw one of them in a dish at the king’s table,\r\nwhich passed for a rarity, but I did not observe he was fond of it; for\r\nI think, indeed, the bigness disgusted him, although I have seen one\r\nsomewhat larger in Greenland.\r\n\r\nThe country is well inhabited, for it contains fifty-one cities, near\r\na hundred walled towns, and a great number of villages. To satisfy my\r\ncurious reader, it may be sufficient to describe Lorbrulgrud. This city\r\nstands upon almost two equal parts on each side of the river that passes\r\nthrough. It contains above eighty thousand houses, and about six hundred\r\nthousand inhabitants. It is in length three _glongluns_ (which make about\r\nfifty-four English miles), and two and a half in breadth, as I measured\r\nit myself in the royal map made by the king’s order, which was laid on\r\nthe ground on purpose for me, and extended a hundred feet; I paced the\r\ndiameter and circumference several times barefoot, and computing by the\r\nscale, measured it pretty exactly.\r\n\r\nThe king’s palace is no regular edifice, but a heap of buildings about\r\nseven miles round; the chief rooms are generally two hundred and forty\r\nfeet high, and broad and long in proportion. A coach was allowed to\r\nGlumdalclitch and me, wherein her governess frequently took her out to\r\nsee the town, or go among the shops; and I was always of the party,\r\ncarried in my box; although the girl, at my own desire, would often take\r\nme out, and hold me in her hand, that I might more conveniently view\r\nthe houses and the people, as we passed along the streets. I reckoned\r\nour coach to be about a square of Westminster Hall, but not altogether\r\nso high; however, I cannot be very exact. One day the governess ordered\r\nour coachman to stop at several shops, where the beggars, watching their\r\nopportunity, crowded to the sides of the coach, and gave me the most\r\nhorrible spectacles that ever an English eye beheld.\r\n\r\nBeside the large box in which I was usually carried, the queen ordered\r\na smaller one to be made for me, of about twelve feet square, and ten\r\nhigh, for the convenience of traveling; because the other was somewhat\r\ntoo large for Glumdalclitch’s lap, and cumbersome in the coach; it was\r\nmade by the same artist, whom I directed in the whole contrivance. This\r\ntraveling closet was an exact square, with a window in the middle of\r\nthree of the squares, and each window was latticed with iron wire on the\r\noutside, to prevent accidents in long journeys. On the fourth side, which\r\nhad no window, two strong staples were fixed, through which the person\r\nthat carried me, when I had a mind to be on horseback, put in a leather\r\nbelt, and buckled it about his waist. This was always the office of some\r\ngrave trusty servant in whom I could confide, whether I attended the king\r\nand queen in their progresses, or were disposed to see the gardens, or\r\npay a visit to some great lady or minister of state in the court, when\r\nGlumdalclitch happened to be out of order; for I soon began to be known\r\nand esteemed among the greatest officers, I suppose more upon account\r\nof their majesties’ favor than any merit of my own. In journeys, when I\r\nwas weary of the coach, a servant on horseback would buckle my box, and\r\nplace it on a cushion before him; and there I had a full prospect of the\r\ncountry on three sides from my three windows. I had in this closet a\r\nfield bed, and a hammock hung from the ceiling, two chairs and a table,\r\nneatly screwed to the floor, to prevent being tossed by the agitation of\r\nthe horse or the coach. And having long been used to sea voyages, those\r\nmotions, although sometimes very violent, did not much discompose me.\r\n\r\nWhenever I had a mind to see the town, it was always in my traveling\r\ncloset, which Glumdalclitch held in her lap in a kind of open sedan,\r\nafter the fashion of the country, borne by four men, and attended by two\r\nothers in the queen’s livery. The people, who had often heard of me,\r\nwere very curious to crowd about the sedan, and the girl was complaisant\r\nenough to make the bearers stop, and to take me in her hand that I might\r\nbe more conveniently seen.\r\n\r\nI was very desirous to see the chief temple, and particularly the\r\ntower belonging to it, which is reckoned the highest in the kingdom.\r\nAccordingly, one day my nurse carried me thither, but I may truly say\r\nI came back disappointed; for the height is not above three thousand\r\nfeet, and reckoning from the ground to the highest pinnacle top; which,\r\nallowing for the difference between the size of those people and us in\r\nEurope, is no great matter for admiration, nor at all equal in proportion\r\n(if I rightly remember) to Salisbury steeple. But, not to detract from\r\na nation to which, during my life, I shall acknowledge myself extremely\r\nobliged, it must be allowed that whatever this famous tower wants in\r\nheight, is amply made up in beauty and strength; for the walls are near a\r\nhundred feet thick, built of hewn stone, whereof each is about forty feet\r\nsquare, and adorned on all sides with statues of gods and emperors cut in\r\nmarble larger than the life, placed in their several niches. I measured\r\na little finger which had fallen down from one of these statues, and\r\nlay unperceived among some rubbish, and found it exactly four feet and\r\nan inch in length. Glumdalclitch wrapped it up in her handkerchief, and\r\ncarried it home in her pocket, to keep among other trinkets, of which the\r\ngirl was very fond, as children at her age usually are.\r\n\r\nThe king’s kitchen is indeed a noble building, vaulted at top, and about\r\nsix hundred feet high. The great oven is not so wide by ten paces as the\r\ncupola at St. Paul’s; for I measured the latter on purpose, after my\r\nreturn. But if I should describe the kitchen grate, the prodigious pots\r\nand kettles, the joints of meat turning on the spits, with many other\r\nparticulars, perhaps I should be hardly believed; at least a severe\r\ncritic would be apt to think I enlarged a little, as travelers are often\r\nsuspected to do. To avoid which censure, I fear I have run too much\r\ninto the other extreme, and that if this treatise should happen to be\r\ntranslated into the language of Brobdingnag (which is the general name\r\nof that kingdom), and transmitted thither, the king and his people would\r\nhave reason to complain that I had done them an injury by a false and\r\ndiminutive representation.\r\n\r\nHis majesty seldom keeps above six hundred horses in his stables; they\r\nare generally from fifty-four to sixty feet high. But when he goes abroad\r\non solemn days, he is attended, for state, by a militia guard of five\r\nhundred horse, which indeed I thought was the most splendid sight that\r\ncould be ever beheld, till I saw part of his army in battalia, whereof I\r\nshall find another occasion to speak.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n    SEVERAL ADVENTURES THAT HAPPENED TO THE AUTHOR—THE EXECUTION OF\r\n    A CRIMINAL—THE AUTHOR SHOWS HIS SKILL IN NAVIGATION.\r\n\r\n\r\nI should have lived happy enough in that country, if my littleness had\r\nnot exposed me to several ridiculous and troublesome accidents; some of\r\nwhich I shall venture to relate. Glumdalclitch often carried me into the\r\ngardens of the court in my smaller box, and would sometimes take me out\r\nof it and hold me in her hand, or set me down to walk. I remember, before\r\nthe dwarf left the queen, he followed us one day into those gardens, and\r\nmy nurse having set me down, he and I being close together, near some\r\ndwarf apple trees, I must need show my wit by a silly allusion between\r\nhim and the trees, which happens to hold in their language as it does\r\nin ours. Whereupon, the malicious rogue, watching his opportunity, when\r\nI was walking under one of them, shook it directly over my head, by\r\nwhich a dozen apples, each of them near as large as a Bristol barrel,\r\ncame tumbling about my ears; one of them hit me on the back as I chanced\r\nto stoop, and knocked me down flat on my face; but I received no other\r\nhurt, and the dwarf was pardoned at my desire, because I had given the\r\nprovocation.\r\n\r\nAnother day, Glumdalclitch left me on a smooth grassplot to divert\r\nmyself, while she walked at some distance with her governess. In the\r\nmeantime, there suddenly fell such a violent shower of hail, that I was\r\nimmediately, by the force of it, struck to the ground; and when I was\r\ndown, the hailstones gave me such cruel bangs all over the body, as if\r\nI had been pelted with tennis balls; however, I made a shift to creep on\r\nall fours, and shelter myself by lying flat on my face on the lee side of\r\na border of lemon-thyme; but so bruised from head to foot that I could\r\nnot go abroad in ten days. Neither is this at all to be wondered at,\r\nbecause nature in that country observing the same proportion through all\r\nher operations, a hailstone is near eighteen hundred times as large as\r\none in Europe; which I can assert upon experience, having been so curious\r\nto weigh and measure them.\r\n\r\nBut a more dangerous accident happened to me in the same garden, when my\r\nlittle nurse, believing she had put me in a secure place (which I often\r\nentreated her to do, that I might enjoy my own thoughts), and having left\r\nmy box at home to avoid the trouble of carrying it, went to another part\r\nof the garden with her governess and some ladies of her acquaintance.\r\nWhile she was absent, and out of hearing, a small white spaniel belonging\r\nto one of the chief gardeners, having got by accident into the garden,\r\nhappened to range near the place where I lay: the dog following the\r\nscent, came directly up, and taking me in his mouth, ran straight to\r\nhis master, wagging his tail, and set me gently on the ground. By good\r\nfortune he had been so well taught, that I was carried between his\r\nteeth without the least hurt, or even tearing my clothes. But the poor\r\ngardener, who knew me well, and had a great kindness for me, was in a\r\nterrible fright; he gently took me up in both his hands, and asked me\r\nhow I did; but I was so amazed and out of breath, that I could not speak\r\na word. In a few minutes I came to myself, and he carried me safe to my\r\nlittle nurse, who by this time had returned to the place where she had\r\nleft me, and was in cruel agonies when I did not appear, nor answer when\r\nshe called. She severely reprimanded the gardener on account of his dog.\r\nBut the thing was hushed up, and never known at court, for the girl was\r\nafraid of the queen’s anger; and truly, as to myself, I thought it would\r\nnot be for my reputation that such a story should go about.\r\n\r\nThis accident absolutely determined Glumdalclitch never to trust me\r\nabroad for the future out of her sight. I had been long afraid of\r\nthis resolution, and therefore concealed from her some little unlucky\r\nadventures that happened in those times when I was left by myself. Once\r\na kite, hovering over the garden, made a stoop at me, and if I had not\r\nresolutely drawn my hanger, and run under a thick espalier, he would have\r\ncertainly carried me away in his talons. Another time, walking to the top\r\nof a fresh molehill, I fell to my neck in the hole through which that\r\nanimal had cast up the earth, and coined some lie, not worth remembering,\r\nto excuse myself for spoiling my clothes. I likewise broke my right shin\r\nagainst the shell of a snail, which I happened to stumble over as I was\r\nwalking alone and thinking on poor England.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “_I banged it a good while with one of my sculls_”\r\n\r\n_Page 132_]\r\n\r\nI cannot tell whether I were more pleased or mortified to observe, in\r\nthose solitary walks, that the smaller birds did not appear to be at all\r\nafraid of me, but would hop about within a yard’s distance, looking for\r\nworms and other food, with as much indifference and security as if no\r\ncreature at all were near them. I remember, a thrush had the confidence\r\nto snatch out of my hand with his bill a piece of cake that Glumdalclitch\r\nhad just given me for my breakfast. When I attempted to catch any of\r\nthese birds, they would boldly turn against me, endeavoring to pick my\r\nfingers, which I durst not venture within their reach; and then they\r\nwould hop back unconcerned, to hunt for worms or snails as they did\r\nbefore. But one day, I took a thick cudgel, and threw it with all my\r\nstrength so luckily at a linnet, that I knocked him down, and seizing\r\nhim by the neck with both my hands, ran with him in triumph to my nurse.\r\nHowever, the bird, who had only been stunned, recovering himself, gave me\r\nso many boxes with his wings on both sides of my head and body, though\r\nI held him at arm’s length, and was out of the reach of his claws, that\r\nI was twenty times thinking to let him go. But I was soon relieved by\r\none of our servants, who wrung off the bird’s neck, and I had him next\r\nday for dinner, by the queen’s command. This linnet, as near as I can\r\nremember, seemed to be somewhat larger than an English swan.\r\n\r\nOne day a young gentleman who was nephew to my nurse’s governess, came\r\nand pressed them both to see an execution. It was of a man who had\r\nmurdered one of that gentleman’s intimate acquaintance. Glumdalclitch was\r\nprevailed on to be of the company, very much against her inclination, for\r\nshe was naturally tender-hearted; and as for myself, although I abhorred\r\nsuch kind of spectacles, yet my curiosity tempted me to see something\r\nthat I thought must be extraordinary. The malefactor was fixed in a chair\r\nupon a scaffold erected for the purpose, and his head cut off at a blow\r\nwith a sword of about forty feet long. The veins and arteries spouted up\r\nsuch a prodigious quantity of blood, and so high in the air, that the\r\ngreat _jet d’eau_ at Versailles was not equal for the time it lasted;\r\nand the head, when it fell on the scaffold floor, gave such a bounce as\r\nmade me start, although I were at least half an English mile distant.\r\n\r\nThe queen, who often used to hear me talk of my sea voyages, and took\r\nall occasions to divert me when I was melancholy, asked me whether I\r\nunderstood how to handle a sail or an oar, and whether a little exercise\r\nof rowing might not be convenient for my health. I answered that I\r\nunderstood both very well; for although my proper employment had been to\r\nbe surgeon or doctor to the ship, yet often, upon a pinch, I was forced\r\nto work like a common mariner. But I could not see how this could be done\r\nin their country, where the smallest wherry was equal to a first-rate man\r\nof war among us; and such a boat as I could manage would never live in\r\nany of their rivers. Her majesty said, if I would contrive a boat, her\r\nown joiner should make it, and she would provide a place for me to sail\r\nin. The fellow was an ingenious workman, and by my instructions, in ten\r\ndays finished a pleasure boat, with all its tackling, able conveniently\r\nto hold eight Europeans. When it was finished, the queen was so delighted\r\nthat she ran with it in her lap to the king, who ordered it to be put in\r\na cistern full of water, with me in it, by way of trial, where I could\r\nnot manage my two sculls or little oars for want of room. But the queen\r\nhad before contrived another project. She ordered the joiner to make a\r\nwooden trough of three hundred feet long, fifty broad, and eight deep;\r\nwhich being well pitched to prevent leaking, was placed on the floor\r\nalong the wall, in an outer room of the palace. It had a cock near the\r\nbottom to let out the water when it began to grow stale; and two servants\r\ncould easily fill it in half an hour. Here I often used to row for my\r\nown diversion, as well as that of the queen and her ladies, who thought\r\nthemselves well entertained with my skill and agility. Sometimes I would\r\nput up my sail, and then my business was only to steer, while the ladies\r\ngave me a gale with their fans; and when they were weary, some of the\r\npages would blow my sail forward with their breath, while I showed my\r\nart by steering starboard or larboard as I pleased. When I had done,\r\nGlumdalclitch always carried back my boat into her closet, and hung it on\r\na nail to dry.\r\n\r\nIn this exercise I once met an accident which had like to have cost me\r\nmy life; for, one of the pages having put my boat into the trough, the\r\ngoverness who attended Glumdalclitch very officiously lifted me up, to\r\nplace me in the boat; but I happened to slip through her fingers, and\r\nshould have infallibly fallen down forty feet, upon the floor, if by the\r\nluckiest chance in the world I had not been stopped by a corking-pin that\r\nstuck in the good gentlewoman’s stomacher; the head of the pin passed\r\nbetween my shirt and the waistband of my breeches, and thus I was held by\r\nthe middle in the air till Glumdalclitch ran to my relief.\r\n\r\nAnother time, one of the servants, whose office it was to fill my trough\r\nevery third day with fresh water, was so careless to let a huge frog (not\r\nperceiving it) slip out of his pail. The frog lay concealed till I was\r\nput into my boat, but then, seeing a resting place, climbed up, and made\r\nit lean so much on one side, that I was forced to balance it with all my\r\nweight on the other, to prevent overturning. When the frog was got in,\r\nit hopped at once half the length of the boat, and then over my head,\r\nbackwards and forwards, daubing my face and clothes with its odious\r\nslime. The largeness of its features made it appear the most deformed\r\nanimal that can be conceived. However, I desired Glumdalclitch to let me\r\ndeal with it alone. I banged it a good while with one of my sculls, and\r\nat last forced it to leap out of the boat.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest danger I ever underwent in that kingdom was from a\r\nmonkey, who belonged to one of the clerks of the kitchen. Glumdalclitch\r\nhad locked me up in her closet, while she went somewhere upon business,\r\nor a visit. The weather being very warm, the closet window was left\r\nopen, as well as the windows and door of my bigger box, in which I\r\nusually lived, because of its largeness and conveniency. As I sat quietly\r\nmeditating at my table, I heard something bounce in at the closet window,\r\nand skip about from one side to the other; whereat, although I was much\r\nalarmed, yet I ventured to look out, but stirred not from my seat; and\r\nthen I saw this frolicsome animal frisking and leaping up and down, till\r\nat last he came to my box, which he seemed to view with great pleasure\r\nand curiosity, peeping in at the door and every window. I retreated to\r\nthe farther corner of my room, or box; but the monkey, looking in at\r\nevery side, put me into such a fright, that I wanted presence of mind to\r\nconceal myself under the bed, as I might easily have done. After some\r\ntime spent in peeping, grinning, and chattering, he at last espied me;\r\nand reaching one of his paws in at the door, as a cat does when she plays\r\nwith a mouse, although I often shifted place to avoid him, he at length\r\nseized the lappet of my coat (which being made of that country cloth, was\r\nvery thick and strong) and dragged me out. He took me up in his right\r\nforefoot, and held me as a nurse does a child she is going to suckle,\r\njust as I have seen the same sort of creature do with a kitten in Europe;\r\nand when I offered to struggle, he squeezed me so hard, that I thought\r\nit more prudent to submit. I have good reason to believe that he took me\r\nfor a young one of his own species, by his often stroking my face very\r\ngently with his other paw. In these diversions he was interrupted by a\r\nnoise at the closet door, as if somebody were opening it; whereupon he\r\nsuddenly leaped up to the window at which he had come in, and thence upon\r\nthe leads and gutters, walking upon three legs, and holding me in the\r\nfourth, till he clambered up to a roof that was next to ours. I heard\r\nGlumdalclitch give a shriek at the moment he was carrying me out. The\r\npoor girl was almost distracted; that quarter of the palace was all in an\r\nuproar; the servants ran for ladders; the monkey was seen by hundreds in\r\nthe court, sitting upon the ridge of a building, holding me like a baby\r\nin one of his forepaws, and feeding me with the other, by cramming into\r\nmy mouth some victuals he had squeezed out of the bag on one side of his\r\nchaps, and patting me when I would not eat; whereat many of the rabble\r\nbelow could not forbear laughing; neither do I think they justly ought\r\nto be blamed, for, without question, the sight was ridiculous enough to\r\neverybody but myself. Some of the people threw up stones, hoping to drive\r\nthe monkey down; but this was strictly forbidden, or else very probably\r\nmy brains had been dashed out.\r\n\r\nThe ladders were now applied, and mounted by several men: which the\r\nmonkey observing, and finding himself almost encompassed, not being able\r\nto make speed enough with his three legs, let me drop on a ridge tile,\r\nand made his escape. Here I sat for some time, three hundred yards from\r\nthe ground, expecting every moment to be blown down by the wind, or to\r\nfall by my own giddiness, and come tumbling over and over from the ridge\r\nto the eaves; but an honest lad, one of my nurse’s footmen, climbed up,\r\nand putting me into his breeches pocket, brought me down safe.\r\n\r\nI was almost choked with the filthy stuff the monkey had crammed down my\r\nthroat; but my dear little nurse picked it out of my mouth with a small\r\nneedle, and then I fell a-vomiting, which gave me great relief. Yet I\r\nwas so weak and bruised in the sides with the squeezes given me by this\r\nodious animal, that I was forced to keep my bed a fortnight. The king,\r\nqueen, and all the court sent every day to inquire after my health; and\r\nher majesty made me several visits during my sickness. The monkey was\r\nkilled, and an order made that no such animal should be kept about the\r\npalace.\r\n\r\nWhen I attended the king after my recovery, to return him thanks for\r\nhis favors, he was pleased to rally me a good deal upon this adventure.\r\nHe asked me what my thoughts and speculations were while I lay in the\r\nmonkey’s paw, how I liked the victuals he gave me, his manner of feeding,\r\nand whether the fresh air on the roof had sharpened my stomach. He\r\ndesired to know what I would have done upon such an occasion in my own\r\ncountry. I told his majesty, that in Europe we had no monkeys except such\r\nas were brought for curiosities from other places, and so small that I\r\ncould deal with a dozen of them together, if they presumed to attack\r\nme. And as for that monstrous animal with whom I was so lately engaged\r\n(it was indeed as large as an elephant), if my fears had suffered me to\r\nthink so far as to make use of my hanger (looking fiercely and clapping\r\nmy hand upon the hilt as I spoke) when he poked his paw into my chamber,\r\nperhaps I should have given him such a wound as would have made him glad\r\nto withdraw it with more haste than he put it in. This I delivered in\r\na firm tone, like a person who was jealous lest his courage should be\r\ncalled in question. However, my speech produced nothing else besides a\r\nloud laughter, which all the respect due to his majesty from those about\r\nhim could not make them contain. This made me reflect how vain an attempt\r\nit is for a man to endeavor doing himself honor among those who are out\r\nof all degree of equality or comparison with him. And yet I have seen\r\nthe moral of my own behavior very frequently in England since my return;\r\nwhere a little contemptible varlet, without the least title to birth,\r\nperson, wit, or common sense, shall presume to look with importance, and\r\nput himself upon a foot with the greatest persons of the kingdom.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n    SEVERAL CONTRIVANCES OF THE AUTHOR TO PLEASE THE KING AND\r\n    QUEEN—HE SHOWS HIS SKILL IN MUSIC—THE KING INQUIRES INTO THE\r\n    STATE OF EUROPE, WHICH THE AUTHOR RELATES TO HIM—THE KING’S\r\n    OBSERVATIONS THEREON.\r\n\r\n\r\nI used to attend the king’s levee once or twice a week, and had often\r\nseen him under the barber’s hand, which indeed was at first very terrible\r\nto behold; for the razor was almost twice as long as an ordinary scythe.\r\nHis majesty, according to the custom of the country, was only shaved\r\ntwice a week. I once prevailed on the barber to give me some of the suds\r\nor lather, out of which I picked forty or fifty of the strongest stumps\r\nof hair. I then took a piece of fine wood, and cut it like the back of a\r\ncomb, making several holes in it at equal distance with as small a needle\r\nas I could get from Glumdalclitch. I fixed in the stumps so artificially,\r\nscraping and sloping them with my knife towards the points, that I made a\r\nvery tolerable comb; which was a seasonable supply, my own being so much\r\nbroken in the teeth that it was almost useless: neither did I know any\r\nartist in that country so nice and exact, as would undertake to make me\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nAnd this puts me in mind of an amusement wherein I spent many of my\r\nleisure hours. I desired the queen’s woman to save for me the combings of\r\nher majesty’s hair, whereof in time I got a good quantity; and consulting\r\nwith my friend the cabinetmaker, who had received general orders to do\r\nlittle jobs for me, I directed him to make two chair frames, no larger\r\nthan those I had in my box, and to bore little holes with a fine awl\r\nround those parts where I designed the backs and seats; through these\r\nholes I wove the strongest hairs I could pick out, just after the manner\r\nof cane chairs in England. When they were finished, I made a present\r\nof them to her majesty, who kept them in her cabinet, and used to show\r\nthem for curiosities, as indeed they were the wonder of every one that\r\nbeheld them. The queen would have me sit upon one of these chairs,\r\nbut I absolutely refused to obey her, protesting I would rather die\r\na thousand deaths than place part of my body on those precious hairs\r\nthat once adorned her majesty’s head. Of these hairs (as I had always a\r\nmechanical genius) I likewise made a neat little purse about five feet\r\nlong, with her majesty’s name deciphered in gold letters, which I gave\r\nto Glumdalclitch by the queen’s consent. To say the truth, it was more\r\nfor show than use, being not of strength to bear the weight of the larger\r\ncoins, and therefore she kept nothing in it but some little toys that\r\ngirls are fond of.\r\n\r\nThe king, who delighted in music, had frequent concerts at court, to\r\nwhich I was sometimes carried, and set in my box on a table to hear them;\r\nbut the noise was so great that I could hardly distinguish the tunes. I\r\nam confident that all the drums and trumpets of a royal army, beating and\r\nsounding together just at your ears, could not equal it. My practice was\r\nto have my box removed from the places where the performers sat, as far\r\nas I could, then to shut the doors and windows of it, and draw the window\r\ncurtains, after which I found their music not disagreeable.\r\n\r\nI had learned in my youth to play a little upon the spinet. Glumdalclitch\r\nkept one in her chamber, and a master attended twice a week to teach\r\nher. I call it a spinet, because it somewhat resembled that instrument,\r\nand was played upon in the same manner. A fancy came into my head that\r\nI would entertain the king and queen with an English tune upon this\r\ninstrument. But this appeared extremely difficult; for the spinet was\r\nnear sixty feet long, each key being almost a foot wide, so that with my\r\narms extended I could not reach to above five keys, and to press them\r\ndown required a good smart stroke with my fist, which would be too great\r\na labor and to no purpose. The method I contrived was this: I prepared\r\ntwo round sticks about the bigness of common cudgels; they were thicker\r\nat one end than the other, and I covered the thicker ends with a piece\r\nof a mouse’s skin, that by rapping on them I might neither damage the\r\ntops of the keys nor interrupt the sound. Before the spinet a bench was\r\nplaced, about four feet below the keys, and I was put upon the bench. I\r\nran sideling upon it, that way and this, as fast as I could, banging the\r\nproper keys with my two sticks, and made a shift to play a jig, to the\r\ngreat satisfaction of both their majesties; but it was the most violent\r\nexercise I ever underwent; and yet I could not strike above sixteen keys,\r\nnor, consequently, play the bass and treble together, as other artists\r\ndo; which was a great disadvantage to my performance.\r\n\r\nThe king, who, as I before observed, was a prince of excellent\r\nunderstanding, would frequently order that I should be brought in my\r\nbox, and set upon the table in his closet. He would then command me to\r\nbring one of my chairs out of the box, and sit down within three yards’\r\ndistance upon the top of the cabinet, which brought me almost to a level\r\nwith his face. In this manner I had several conversations with him. I one\r\nday took the freedom to tell his majesty that the contempt he discovered\r\ntowards Europe, and the rest of the world, did not seem answerable to\r\nthose excellent qualities of mind he was master of; that reason did not\r\nextend itself with the bulk of the body; on the contrary, we observed\r\nin our country that the tallest persons were usually least provided\r\nwith it; that among other animals, bees and ants had the reputation of\r\nmore industry, art, and sagacity than many of the larger kinds; and\r\nthat, as inconsiderable as he took me to be, I hoped I might live to do\r\nhis majesty some signal service. The king heard me with attention, and\r\nbegan to conceive a much better opinion of me than he had ever before.\r\nHe desired I would give him as exact an account of the government of\r\nEngland as I possibly could; because, as fond as princes commonly are of\r\ntheir own customs (for so he conjectured of other monarchs by my former\r\ndiscourses), he should be glad to hear of anything that might deserve\r\nimitation.\r\n\r\nImagine with thyself, courteous reader, how often I then wished for the\r\ntongue of Demosthenes or Cicero, that might have enabled me to celebrate\r\nthe praises of my own dear native country in a style equal to its merits\r\nand felicity.\r\n\r\nI began my discourse by informing his majesty that our dominions\r\nconsisted of two islands, which composed three mighty kingdoms under one\r\nsovereign, besides our plantations in America. I dwelt long upon the\r\nfertility of our soil, and the temperature of our climate. I then spoke\r\nat large upon the constitution of an English Parliament, partly made up\r\nof an illustrious body called the House of Peers, persons of the noblest\r\nblood, and of the most ancient and ample patrimonies. I described that\r\nextraordinary care always taken of their education in arts and arms,\r\nto qualify them for being counselors born to the king and kingdom, to\r\nhave a share in the legislature; to be members of the highest court of\r\njudicature, from whence there could be no appeal; and to be champions\r\nalways ready for the defense of their prince and country, by their\r\nvalor, conduct, and fidelity. That these were the ornament and bulwark\r\nof the kingdom, worthy followers of their most renowned ancestors, whose\r\nhonor had been the reward of their virtue, from which their posterity\r\nwere never once known to degenerate. To these were joined several holy\r\npersons, as part of that assembly, under the title of bishops, whose\r\npeculiar business it is to take care of religion, and of those who\r\ninstruct the people therein. These were searched and sought out through\r\nthe whole nation, by the prince and his wisest counselors, among such\r\nof the priesthood as were most deservedly distinguished by the sanctity\r\nof their lives, and the depth of their erudition; who were indeed the\r\nspiritual fathers of the clergy and the people.\r\n\r\nThat the other part of the Parliament consisted of an assembly called\r\nthe House of Commons, who were all principal gentlemen, freely picked\r\nand culled out by the people themselves, for their great abilities and\r\nlove of their country, to represent the wisdom of the whole nation. And\r\nthese two bodies make up the most august assembly in Europe, to whom, in\r\nconjunction with the prince, the whole legislature is committed.\r\n\r\nI then descended to the courts of justice, over which the judges, those\r\nvenerable sages and interpreters of the law, presided, for determining\r\nthe disputed rights and properties of men, as well as for the punishment\r\nof vice and protection of innocence. I mentioned the prudent management\r\nof our treasury; the valor and achievements of our forces by sea and\r\nland. I computed the number of our people, by reckoning how many millions\r\nthere might be of each religious sect or political party among us. I did\r\nnot omit even our sports and pastimes, or any other particular which I\r\nthought might redound to the honor of my country. And I finished all with\r\na brief historical account of affairs and events in England for about a\r\nhundred years past.\r\n\r\nThis conversation was not ended under five audiences, each of several\r\nhours; and the king heard the whole with great attention, frequently\r\ntaking notes of what I spoke, as well as memorandums of several questions\r\nhe intended to ask me.\r\n\r\nWhen I had put an end to these long discourses, his majesty in a sixth\r\naudience consulting his notes, proposed many doubts, queries, and\r\nobjections, upon every article. He asked what methods were used to\r\ncultivate the minds and bodies of our young nobility, and in what kind\r\nof business they commonly spent the first and teachable part of their\r\nlives. What course was taken to supply that assembly when any noble\r\nfamily became extinct. What qualifications were necessary in those who\r\nwere to be created new lords. Whether the humor of the prince, a sum of\r\nmoney to a court lady or a Prime Minister, or a design of strengthening\r\na party opposite to the public interest, ever happened to be motives in\r\nthose advancements. What share of knowledge these lords had in the laws\r\nof their country, and how they came by it, so as to enable them to decide\r\nthe properties of their fellow subjects in the last resort. Whether they\r\nwere always so free from avarice, partialities, or want, that a bribe, or\r\nsome other sinister view, could have no place among them. Whether those\r\nholy lords I spoke of were always promoted to that rank upon account of\r\ntheir knowledge in religious matters, and the sanctity of their lives,\r\nhad never been compliers with the times while they were common priests,\r\nor slavish prostitute chaplains to some nobleman, whose opinions they\r\ncontinued servilely to follow after they were admitted into that assembly.\r\n\r\nHe then desired to know what arts were practiced in electing those whom\r\nI called commoners; whether a stranger with a strong purse might not\r\ninfluence the vulgar voters to choose him before their own landlord,\r\nor the most considerable gentleman in the neighborhood. How it came to\r\npass, that people were so violently bent upon getting into this assembly,\r\nwhich I allowed to be a great trouble and expense, often to the ruin of\r\ntheir families, without any salary or pension; because this appeared\r\nsuch an exalted strain of virtue and public spirit, that his majesty\r\nseemed to doubt it might possibly not be always sincere. And he desired\r\nto know whether such zealous gentlemen could have any views of refunding\r\nthemselves for the charges and trouble they were at, by sacrificing the\r\npublic good to the designs of a weak and vicious prince in conjunction\r\nwith a corrupted ministry. He multiplied his questions, and sifted me\r\nthoroughly upon every part of this head, proposing numberless inquiries\r\nand objections, which I think it not prudent or convenient to repeat.\r\n\r\nUpon what I said in relation to our courts of justice his majesty desired\r\nto be satisfied in several points; and this I was the better able to do,\r\nhaving been formerly almost ruined by a long suit in chancery, which\r\nwas decreed for me with costs. He asked what time was usually spent in\r\ndetermining between right and wrong, and what degree of expense. Whether\r\nadvocates and orators had liberty to plead in causes manifestly known\r\nto be unjust, vexatious, or oppressive. Whether party in religion or\r\npolitics were observed to be of any weight in the scale of justice.\r\nWhether those pleading orators were persons educated in the general\r\nknowledge of equity, or only in provincial, national, and other local\r\ncustoms. Whether they or their judges had any part in penning those laws\r\nwhich they assumed the liberty of interpreting and glossing upon at their\r\npleasure. Whether they had ever, at different times, pleaded for and\r\nagainst the same cause, and cited precedents to prove contrary opinions.\r\nWhether they were a rich or a poor corporation. Whether they received\r\nany pecuniary reward for pleading, or delivering their opinions. And\r\nparticularly, whether they were ever admitted as members in the lower\r\nsenate.\r\n\r\nHe fell next upon the management of our treasury; and said he thought my\r\nmemory had failed me, because I computed our taxes at about five or six\r\nmillions a year, and when I came to mention the issues, he found they\r\nsometimes amounted to more than double: for the notes he had taken were\r\nvery particular in this point, because he hoped, as he told me, that the\r\nknowledge of our conduct might be useful to him, and he could not be\r\ndeceived in his calculations. But if what I told him were true, he was\r\nstill at a loss how a kingdom could run out of its estate like a private\r\nperson. He asked me who were our creditors; and where we should find\r\nmoney to pay them. He wondered to hear me talk of such chargeable and\r\nextensive wars; that certainly we must be a quarrelsome people, or live\r\namong very bad neighbors, and that our generals must needs be richer than\r\nour kings. He asked what business we had out of our own islands, unless\r\nupon the score of trade or treaty, or to defend the coasts with our\r\nfleet. Above all, he was amazed to hear me talk of a mercenary standing\r\narmy in the midst of peace, and among a free people. He said if we were\r\ngoverned by our own consent in the persons of our representatives, he\r\ncould not imagine of whom we were afraid, or against whom we were to\r\nfight; and would hear my opinion, whether a private man’s house might not\r\nbetter be defended by himself, his children, and family, than by half a\r\ndozen rascals picked up at a venture in the streets for small wages, who\r\nmight get a hundred times more by cutting their throats.\r\n\r\nHe laughed at my odd kind of arithmetic, as he was pleased to call it,\r\nin reckoning the numbers of our people by a computation drawn from the\r\nseveral sects among us in religion and politics. He said he knew no\r\nreason why those who entertain opinions prejudicial to the public, should\r\nbe obliged to change, or should not be obliged to conceal them. And as it\r\nwas tyranny in any government to require the first, so it was weakness\r\nnot to enforce the second: for a man may be allowed to keep poisons in\r\nhis closet, but not to vend them about for cordials.\r\n\r\nHe observed, that among the diversions of our nobility and gentry, I\r\nhad mentioned gaming. He desired to know at what age this entertainment\r\nwas usually taken up, and when it was laid down; how much of their time\r\nit employed; whether it ever went so high as to affect their fortunes;\r\nwhether mean vicious people by their dexterity in that art might not\r\narrive at great riches, and sometimes keep our very nobles in dependence,\r\nas well as habituate them to vile companions, wholly take from them the\r\nimprovement of their minds, and force them, by the losses they have\r\nreceived, to learn and practice that infamous dexterity upon others.\r\n\r\nHe was perfectly astonished with the historical account I gave him of\r\nour affairs during the last century, protesting it was only a heap of\r\nconspiracies, rebellions, murders, massacres, revolutions, banishments,\r\nthe very worst effects that avarice, faction, hypocrisy, perfidiousness,\r\ncruelty, rage, madness, hatred, envy, lust, malice, or ambition could\r\nproduce.\r\n\r\nHis majesty, in another audience, was at the pains to recapitulate the\r\nsum of all I had spoken; compared the questions he made with the answers\r\nI had given; then taking me into his hands, and stroking me gently,\r\ndelivered himself in these words, which I shall never forget, nor the\r\nmanner he spoke them in: “My little friend Grildrig, you have made a\r\nmost admirable panegyric upon your country; you have clearly proved that\r\nignorance, idleness, and vice may be sometimes the only ingredients for\r\nqualifying a legislator; that laws are best explained, interpreted,\r\nand applied, by those whose interest and abilities lie in perverting,\r\nconfounding, and eluding them. I observe among you some lines of an\r\ninstitution which in its original might have been tolerable, but these\r\nhalf erased, and the rest wholly blurred and blotted by corruptions. It\r\ndoes not appear, from all you have said, how any one virtue is required\r\ntowards the procurement of any one station among you; much less that men\r\nare ennobled on account of their virtue; that priests are advanced by\r\ntheir piety or learning; soldiers for their conduct or valor; judges for\r\ntheir integrity; senators for the love of their country; or counselors\r\nfor their wisdom. As for yourself,” continued the king, “who have spent\r\nthe greatest part of your life in traveling, I am well disposed to hope\r\nyou may hitherto have escaped many vices of your country. But by what I\r\nhave gathered from your own relation, and the answers I have with much\r\npains wringed and extorted from you, I cannot but conclude the bulk of\r\nyour natives to be the most pernicious race of little odious vermin that\r\nnature ever suffered to crawl upon the surface of the earth.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n    THE AUTHOR’S LOVE OF HIS COUNTRY—HE MAKES A PROPOSAL OF MUCH\r\n    ADVANTAGE TO THE KING, WHICH IS REJECTED—THE KING’S GREAT\r\n    IGNORANCE IN POLITICS—THE LEARNING OF THAT COUNTRY VERY\r\n    IMPERFECT AND CONFINED—THE LAWS, AND MILITARY AFFAIRS, AND\r\n    PARTIES IN THE STATE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNothing but an extreme love of truth could have hindered me from\r\nconcealing this part of my story. It was in vain to discover my\r\nresentments, which were always turned into ridicule; and I was forced to\r\nrest with patience while my noble and beloved country was so injuriously\r\ntreated. I am heartily sorry as any of my readers can possibly be, that\r\nsuch an occasion was given; but this prince happened to be so curious\r\nand inquisitive upon every particular, that it could not consist either\r\nwith gratitude or good manners to refuse giving him what satisfaction I\r\nwas able. Yet thus much I may be allowed to say in my own vindication,\r\nthat I artfully eluded many of his questions, and gave to every point\r\na more favorable turn, by many degrees, than the strictness of truth\r\nwould allow. For I have always borne that laudable partiality to my\r\nown country, which Dionysius Halicarnassensis with so much justice\r\nrecommends to an historian: I would hide the frailties and deformities\r\nof my political mother, and place her virtues and beauties in the most\r\nadvantageous light. This was my sincere endeavor in those many discourses\r\nI had with that monarch, although it unfortunately failed of success.\r\n\r\nBut great allowances should be given to a king who lives wholly\r\nsecluded from the rest of the world, and must therefore be altogether\r\nunacquainted with the manners and customs that most prevail in other\r\nnations; the want of which knowledge will ever produce many prejudices,\r\nand a certain narrowness of thinking, from which we and the politer\r\ncountries of Europe are wholly exempted. And it would be hard indeed, if\r\nso remote a prince’s notions of virtue and vice were to be offered as a\r\nstandard for all mankind.\r\n\r\nTo confirm what I have now said, and further to show the miserable\r\neffects of a confined education, I shall here insert a passage which\r\nwill hardly obtain belief. In hopes to ingratiate myself further into\r\nhis majesty’s favor, I told him of an invention discovered between three\r\nand four hundred years ago, to make a certain powder, into a heap of\r\nwhich the smallest spark of fire falling, would kindle the whole in a\r\nmoment, although it were as big as a mountain, and make it all fly up in\r\nthe air together, with a noise and agitation greater than thunder. That\r\na proper quantity of this powder rammed into a hollow tube of brass or\r\niron, according to its bigness, would drive a ball of iron or lead with\r\nsuch a violence and speed as nothing was able to sustain its force. That\r\nthe largest balls thus discharged, would not only destroy whole ranks of\r\nan army at once, but batter the strongest walls to the ground; sink down\r\nships with a thousand men in each, to the bottom of the sea; and when\r\nlinked together by a chain, would cut through masts and rigging, divide\r\nhundreds of bodies in the middle, and lay all waste before them. That we\r\noften put this powder into large hollow balls of iron, and discharged\r\nthem by an engine into some city we were besieging, which would rip up\r\nthe pavements, tear the houses to pieces, burst and throw splinters on\r\nevery side, dashing out the brains of all who came near. That I knew the\r\ningredients very well, which were cheap and common; I understood the\r\nmanner of compounding them, and could direct his workmen how to make\r\nthose tubes of a size proportionable to all other things in his majesty’s\r\nkingdom, and the largest need not be above a hundred feet long; twenty\r\nor thirty of which tubes, charged with the proper quantity of powder and\r\nballs, would batter down the walls of the strongest town in his dominions\r\nin a few hours, or destroy the whole metropolis, if ever it should\r\npretend to dispute his absolute commands. This I humbly offered to his\r\nmajesty as a small tribute of acknowledgment in return of so many marks\r\nthat I had received of his royal favor and protection.\r\n\r\nThe king was struck with horror at the description I had given of those\r\nterrible engines, and the proposal I had made. He was amazed how so\r\nimpotent and groveling an insect as I (these were his expressions)\r\ncould entertain such inhuman ideas, and in so familiar a manner as to\r\nappear wholly unmoved at all the scenes of blood and desolation which\r\nI had painted as the common effects of those destructive machines;\r\nwhereof, he said, some evil genius, enemy to mankind, must have been the\r\nfirst contriver. As for himself, he protested that although few things\r\ndelighted him so much as new discoveries in art or in nature, yet he\r\nwould rather lose half his kingdom than be privy to such a secret, which\r\nhe commanded me, as I valued my life, never to mention any more.\r\n\r\nA strange effect of narrow principles and short views! that a prince\r\npossessed of every quality which procures veneration, love, and esteem;\r\nof strong parts, great wisdom, and profound learning; indued with\r\nadmirable talents for government, and almost adored by his subjects,\r\nshould from a nice unnecessary scruple, whereof in Europe we can have no\r\nconception, let slip an opportunity put into his hands that would have\r\nmade him absolute master of the lives, the liberties, and the fortunes\r\nof his people. Neither do I say this with the least intention to detract\r\nfrom the many virtues of that excellent king, whose character, I am\r\nsensible, will on this account be very much lessened in the opinion\r\nof an English reader; but I take this defect among them to have risen\r\nfrom their ignorance, they not having hitherto reduced politics into a\r\nscience, as the more acute wits of Europe have done. For, I remember very\r\nwell, in a discourse one day with the king, when I happened to say there\r\nwere several thousand books among us written upon the art of government,\r\nit gave him (directly contrary to my intention) a very mean opinion\r\nof our understandings. He professed both to abominate and despise all\r\nmystery, refinement, and intrigue, either in a prince or a minister. He\r\ncould not tell what I meant by secrets of state, where an enemy or some\r\nrival nation were not in the case. He confined the knowledge of governing\r\nwithin very narrow bounds, to common sense and reason, to justice and\r\nlenity, to the speedy determination of civil and criminal causes; with\r\nsome other obvious topics which are not worth considering. And he gave it\r\nfor his opinion, that whoever could make two ears of corn, or two blades\r\nof grass, to grow upon a spot of ground where only one grew before, would\r\ndeserve better of mankind, and do more essential service to his country\r\nthan the whole race of politicians put together.\r\n\r\nThe learning of this people is very defective, consisting only in\r\nmorality, history, poetry, and mathematics, wherein they must be allowed\r\nto excel. But the last of these is wholly applied to what may be useful\r\nin life, to the improvement of agriculture and all mechanical arts; so\r\nthat among us it would be little esteemed. And as to ideas, entities,\r\nabstractions, and transcendentals, I could never drive the least\r\nconception into their heads.\r\n\r\nNo law of that country must exceed in words the number of letters in\r\ntheir alphabet, which consists only in two-and-twenty. But indeed few of\r\nthem extend even to that length. They are expressed in the most plain and\r\nsimple terms, wherein those people are not mercurial enough to discover\r\nabove one interpretation; and to write a comment upon any law is a\r\ncapital crime. As to the decision of civil causes, or proceedings against\r\ncriminals, their precedents are so few, that they have little reason to\r\nboast of any extraordinary skill in either.\r\n\r\nThey have had the art of printing, as well as the Chinese, time out of\r\nmind. But their libraries are not very large; for that of the king, which\r\nis reckoned the biggest, does not amount to above a thousand volumes,\r\nplaced in a gallery of twelve hundred feet long, whence I had liberty to\r\nborrow what books I pleased. The queen’s joiner had contrived in one of\r\nGlumdalclitch’s rooms a kind of wooden machine five-and-twenty feet high,\r\nformed like a standing ladder; the steps were each fifty feet long; it\r\nwas indeed a moveable pair of stairs, the lowest end placed at ten feet\r\ndistance from the wall of the chamber. The book I had a mind to read,\r\nwas put up leaning against the wall. I first mounted to the upper step\r\nof the ladder, and turning my face towards the book, began at the top of\r\nthe page, and so walking to the right and left about eight or ten paces,\r\naccording to the length of the lines, till I had gotten a little below\r\nthe level of mine eyes, and then descending gradually till I came to the\r\nbottom; after which I mounted again, and began the other page in the same\r\nmanner, and so turned over the leaf, which I could easily do with both my\r\nhands, for it was as thick and stiff as a pasteboard, and in the largest\r\nfolios not above eighteen or twenty feet long.\r\n\r\nTheir style is clear, masculine, and smooth, but not florid; for they\r\navoid nothing more than multiplying unnecessary words, or using various\r\nexpressions. I have perused many of their books, especially those\r\nin history and morality. Among the rest, I was much diverted with a\r\nlittle old treatise, which always lay in Glumdalclitch’s bedchamber,\r\nand belonged to her governess, a grave elderly gentlewoman, who dealt\r\nin writings of morality and devotion. The book treats of the weakness\r\nof human kind, and is in little esteem except among the women and the\r\nvulgar. However, I was curious to see what an author of that country\r\ncould say upon such a subject. This writer went through all the usual\r\ntopics of European moralists, showing how diminutive, contemptible,\r\nand helpless an animal was man in his own nature; how unable to defend\r\nhimself from the inclemencies of the air, or the fury of wild beasts; how\r\nmuch he was excelled by one creature in strength, by another in speed,\r\nby a third in foresight, by a fourth in industry. He added that nature\r\nwas degenerated in these latter declining ages of the world, and could\r\nnow produce only small abortive births in comparison of those in ancient\r\ntimes. He said it was very reasonable to think, not only that the species\r\nof men were originally much larger, but also that there must have been\r\ngiants in former ages, which, as it is asserted by history and tradition,\r\nso it has been confirmed by huge bones and skulls casually dug up in\r\nseveral parts of the kingdom, far exceeding the common dwindled race\r\nof man in our days. He argued that the very laws of nature absolutely\r\nrequired we should have been made, in the beginning, of a size more large\r\nand robust, not so liable to destruction from every little accident of a\r\ntile falling from a house or a stone cast from the hand of a boy, or of\r\nbeing drowned in a little brook. From this way of reasoning the author\r\ndrew several moral applications, useful in the conduct of life, but\r\nneedless here to repeat. For my own part, I could not avoid reflecting\r\nhow universally this talent was spread of drawing lectures in morality,\r\nor indeed rather matter of discontent and repining, from the quarrels we\r\nraise with nature. And I believe, upon a strict inquiry, those quarrels\r\nmight be shown as ill-grounded among us as they are among that people.\r\n\r\nAs to their military affairs, they boast that the king’s army consists of\r\na hundred and seventy-six thousand foot and thirty-two thousand horse:\r\nif that may be called an army which is made up of tradesmen in the\r\nseveral cities, and farmers in the country, whose commanders are only\r\nthe nobility and gentry, without pay or reward. They are indeed perfect\r\nenough in their exercises, and under very good discipline, wherein I saw\r\nno great merit; for how should it be otherwise, where every farmer is\r\nunder the command of his own landlord, and every citizen under that of\r\nthe principal men in his own city, chosen, after the manner of Venice,\r\nby ballot? I have often seen the militia of Lorbrulgrud drawn out to\r\nexercise in a great field near the city, of twenty miles square. They\r\nwere in all not above twenty-five thousand foot, and six thousand horse;\r\nbut it was impossible for me to compute their number, considering the\r\nspace of ground they took up. A cavalier mounted on a large steed might\r\nbe about a hundred feet high. I have seen this whole body of horse,\r\nupon a word of command, draw their swords at once and brandish them in\r\nthe air. Imagination can figure nothing so grand, so surprising, and\r\nso astonishing! It looked as if ten thousand flashes of lightning were\r\ndarting at the same time from every quarter of the sky.\r\n\r\nI was curious to know how this prince, to whose dominions there is no\r\naccess from any other country, came to think of armies, or to teach his\r\npeople the practice of military discipline. But I was soon informed,\r\nboth by conversation and reading their histories; for in the course of\r\nmany ages they have been troubled with the same disease to which so many\r\nother governments are subject: the nobility often contending for power,\r\nthe people for liberty, and the king for absolute dominion. All which,\r\nhowever happily tempered by the laws of the kingdom, have been sometimes\r\nviolated by each of the three parties, and have once or more occasioned\r\ncivil wars; the last whereof was happily put an end to by this prince’s\r\ngrandfather by a general composition; and the militia then settled with\r\ncommon consent has been ever since kept in the strictest duty.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n    THE KING AND QUEEN MAKE A PROGRESS TO THE FRONTIERS—THE AUTHOR\r\n    ATTENDS THEM—THE MANNER IN WHICH HE LEAVES THE COUNTRY VERY\r\n    PARTICULARLY RELATED—HE RETURNS TO ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had always a strong impulse that I should sometime recover my liberty,\r\nthough it was impossible to conjecture by what means, or to form any\r\nproject with the least hope of succeeding. The ship in which I sailed\r\nwas the first ever known to be driven within sight of that coast, and\r\nthe king had given strict orders that if at any time another appeared,\r\nit should be taken ashore, and with all its crew and passengers brought\r\nin a tumbril to Lorbrulgrud. He was strongly bent to get me a woman of\r\nmy own size, by whom I might propagate the breed; but I think I should\r\nrather have died than undergone the disgrace of leaving a posterity to\r\nbe kept in cages like tame canary birds, and perhaps in time sold about\r\nthe kingdom to persons of quality, for curiosities. I was indeed treated\r\nwith much kindness: I was the favorite of a great king and queen, and\r\nthe delight of the whole court; but it was upon such a footing as ill\r\nbecame the dignity of human kind. I could never forget those domestic\r\npledges I had left behind me. I wanted to be among people with whom I\r\ncould converse upon even terms, and walk about the streets and fields\r\nwithout fear of being trod to death like a frog or a young puppy. But my\r\ndeliverance came sooner than I expected, and in a manner not very common;\r\nthe whole story and circumstances of which I shall faithfully relate.\r\n\r\nI had now been two years in this country; and about the beginning of the\r\nthird, Glumdalclitch and I attended the king and queen in a progress to\r\nthe south coast of the kingdom. I was carried as usual in my traveling\r\nbox, which, as I have already described, was a very convenient closet\r\nof twelve feet wide. And I had ordered a hammock to be fixed by silken\r\nropes from the four corners at the top, to break the jolts when a servant\r\ncarried me before him on horseback, as I sometimes desired; and would\r\noften sleep in my hammock while we were upon the road. On the roof of my\r\ncloset, not directly over the middle of the hammock, I ordered the joiner\r\nto cut out a hole of a foot square, to give me air in hot weather as I\r\nslept; which hole I shut at pleasure with a board that drew backwards and\r\nforwards through a groove.\r\n\r\nWhen we came to our journey’s end, the king thought proper to pass a\r\nfew days at a palace he has near Flanflasnic, a city within eighteen\r\nEnglish miles of the seaside. Glumdalclitch and I were much fatigued; I\r\nhad gotten a small cold, but the poor girl was so ill as to be confined\r\nto her chamber. I longed to see the ocean, which must be the only scene\r\nof my escape, if ever it should happen. I pretended to be worse than I\r\nreally was, and desired leave to take the fresh air of the sea, with a\r\npage whom I was very fond of, and who had sometimes been trusted with me.\r\nI shall never forget with what unwillingness Glumdalclitch consented,\r\nnor the strict charge she gave the page to be careful of me, bursting at\r\nthe same time into a flood of tears, as if she had some foreboding of\r\nwhat was to happen. The boy took me out in my box, about half an hour’s\r\nwalk from the palace, towards the rocks on the seashore. I ordered him\r\nto set me down, and lifting up one of my sashes, cast many a wistful\r\nmelancholy look towards the sea. I found myself not very well, and told\r\nthe page that I had a mind to take a nap in my hammock, which I hoped\r\nwould do me good. I got in, and the boy shut the window close down to\r\nkeep out the cold. I soon fell asleep, and all I can conjecture is that\r\nwhile I slept, the page, thinking no danger could happen, went among the\r\nrocks to look for birds’ eggs, having before observed him from my window\r\nsearching about, and picking up one or two in the clefts. Be that as it\r\nwill, I found myself suddenly awakened with a violent pull upon the ring\r\nwhich was fastened at the top of my box for the conveniency of carriage.\r\nI felt my box raised very high in the air, and then borne forward with\r\nprodigious speed. The first jolt had like to have shaken me out of my\r\nhammock, but afterwards the motion was easy enough. I called out several\r\ntimes as loud as I could raise my voice, but all to no purpose. I looked\r\ntowards my windows, and could see nothing but the clouds and sky. I\r\nheard a noise over my head like the clapping of wings, and then began\r\nto perceive the woeful condition I was in; that some eagle had got the\r\nring of my box in his beak, with an intent to let it fall on a rock like\r\na tortoise in a shell, and then pick out my body and devour it: for the\r\nsagacity and smell of this bird enable him to discover his quarry at a\r\ngreat distance, though better concealed than I could be within a two-inch\r\nboard.\r\n\r\nIn a little time I observed the noise and flutter of wings to increase\r\nvery fast, and my box was tossed up and down like a signpost in a windy\r\nday. I heard several bangs or buffets, as I thought, given to the eagle\r\n(for such I am certain it must have been that held the ring of my box in\r\nhis beak), and then all on a sudden felt myself falling perpendicularly\r\ndown for above a minute, but with such incredible swiftness that I almost\r\nlost my breath. My fall was stopped by a terrible squash, that sounded\r\nlouder to my ears than the cataract of Niagara; after which, I was quite\r\nin the dark for another minute, and then my box began to rise so high\r\nthat I could see light from the tops of my windows. I now perceived I was\r\nfallen into the sea. My box, by the weight of my body, the goods that\r\nwere in it, and the broad plates of iron fixed for strength at the four\r\ncorners of the top and bottom, floated about five feet deep in water.\r\nI did then and do now suppose that the eagle which flew away with my\r\nbox was pursued by two or three others, and forced to let me drop while\r\nhe was defending himself against the rest, who hoped to share in the\r\nprey. The plates of iron fastened at the bottom of the box (for those\r\nwere the strongest) preserved the balance while it fell, and hindered\r\nit from being broken on the surface of the water. Every joint of it was\r\nwell grooved; and the door did not move on hinges, but up and down like\r\na sash, which kept my closet so tight that very little water came in. I\r\ngot with much difficulty out of my hammock, having first ventured to draw\r\nback the slip-board on the roof already mentioned, contrived on purpose\r\nto let in air, for want of which I found myself almost stifled.\r\n\r\nHow often did I then wish myself with my dear Glumdalclitch, from whom\r\none single hour had so far divided me! And I may say with truth, that\r\nin the midst of my own misfortunes I could not forbear lamenting my\r\npoor nurse, the grief she would suffer for my loss, the displeasure of\r\nthe queen, and the ruin of her fortune. Perhaps many travelers have\r\nnot been under greater difficulties and distress than I was at this\r\njuncture, expecting every moment to see my box dashed in pieces, or at\r\nleast overset by the first violent blast, or a rising wave. A breach\r\nin one single pane of glass would have been immediate death; nor could\r\nanything have preserved the windows but the strong lattice wires placed\r\non the outside against accidents in traveling. I saw the water ooze in\r\nat several crannies, although the leaks were not considerable, and I\r\nendeavored to stop them as well as I could. I was not able to lift up\r\nthe roof of my closet, which otherwise I certainly should have done,\r\nand sat on the top of it, where I might at least preserve myself some\r\nhours longer than by being shut up, as I may call it, in the hold. Or\r\nif I escaped these dangers for a day or two, what could I expect but\r\na miserable death of cold and hunger? I was four hours under these\r\ncircumstances, expecting and indeed wishing every moment to be my last.\r\n\r\nI have already told the reader that there were two strong staples fixed\r\nupon that side of my box which had no window, and into which the servant\r\nwho used to carry me on horseback would put a leathern belt, and buckle\r\nit about his waist. Being in this disconsolate state, I heard, or at\r\nleast thought I heard, some kind of grating noise on that side of my\r\nbox where the staples were fixed, and soon after I began to fancy that\r\nthe box was pulled or towed along in the sea; for I now and then felt a\r\nsort of tugging which made the waves rise near the tops of my windows,\r\nleaving me almost in the dark. This gave me some faint hopes of relief,\r\nalthough I was not able to imagine how it could be brought about. I\r\nventured to unscrew one of my chairs, which were always fastened to the\r\nfloor; and having made a hard shift to screw it down again directly under\r\nthe slipping-board that I had lately opened, I mounted on the chair, and\r\nputting my mouth as near as I could to the hole, I called for help in a\r\nloud voice, and in all the languages I understood. I then fastened my\r\nhandkerchief to a stick I usually carried, and thrusting it up the hole,\r\nwaved it several times in the air, that if any boat or ship were near,\r\nthe seamen might conjecture some unhappy mortal to be shut up in this\r\nbox.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “_I heard a noise over my head like the clapping of wings_”\r\n\r\n_Page 157_]\r\n\r\nI found no effect from all I could do, but plainly perceived my closet to\r\nbe moved along; and in the space of an hour, or better, that side of the\r\nbox where the staples were, and had no window, struck against something\r\nthat was hard. I apprehended it to be a rock, and found myself tossed\r\nmore than ever. I plainly heard a noise upon the cover of my closet, like\r\nthat of a cable, and the grating of it as it passed through the ring.\r\nI then found myself hoisted up, by degrees, at least three feet higher\r\nthan I was before. Whereupon I again thrust up my stick and handkerchief,\r\ncalling for help till I was almost hoarse. In return to which, I heard\r\na great shout repeated three times, giving me such transports of joy\r\nas are not to be conceived but by those who feel them. I now heard a\r\ntrampling over my head, and somebody calling through the hole with a loud\r\nvoice, in the English tongue, “If there be anybody below let him speak.”\r\nI answered, I was an Englishman, drawn by ill fortune into the greatest\r\ncalamity that ever any creature underwent, and begged, by all that is\r\nmoving, to be delivered out of the dungeon I was in. The voice replied,\r\nI was safe, for my box was fastened to their ship; and the carpenter\r\nshould immediately come and saw a hole in the cover, large enough to pull\r\nme out. I answered, that was needless, and would take up too much time;\r\nfor there was no more to be done but let one of the crew put his finger\r\ninto the ring, and take the box out of the sea into the ship, and so\r\ninto the captain’s cabin. Some of them, upon hearing me talk so wildly,\r\nthought I was mad; others laughed; for indeed it never came into my head\r\nthat I was now among people of my own stature and strength. The carpenter\r\ncame, and in a few minutes sawed a passage about four feet square, then\r\nlet down a small ladder, upon which I mounted, and from thence was taken\r\ninto the ship in a very weak condition.\r\n\r\nThe sailors were all in amazement, and asked me a thousand questions,\r\nwhich I had no inclination to answer. I was equally confounded at the\r\nsight of so many pigmies, for such I took them to be, after having so\r\nlong accustomed my eyes to the monstrous objects I had left. But the\r\ncaptain, Mr. Thomas Wilcocks, an honest worthy Shropshire man, observing\r\nI was ready to faint, took me into his cabin, gave me a cordial to\r\ncomfort me, and made me turn in upon his own bed, advising me to take a\r\nlittle rest, of which I had great need. Before I went to sleep, I gave\r\nhim to understand that I had some valuable furniture in my box, too good\r\nto be lost: a fine hammock, a handsome field bed, two chairs, a table,\r\nand a cabinet; that my closet was hung on all sides, or rather quilted,\r\nwith silk and cotton; that if he would let one of the crew bring my\r\ncloset into his cabin, I would open it there before him, and show him my\r\ngoods. The captain, hearing me utter these absurdities, concluded I was\r\nraving; however (I suppose to pacify me), he promised to give order as I\r\ndesired, and going upon deck, sent some of his men down into my closet,\r\nfrom whence (as I afterwards found), they drew up all my goods, and\r\nstripped off the quilting; but the chairs, cabinet, and bedstead, being\r\nscrewed to the floor, were much damaged by the ignorance of the seamen,\r\nwho tore them up by force. They then knocked off some of the boards for\r\nthe use of the ship, and when they had got all they had a mind for, let\r\nthe hulk drop into the sea, which, by reason of many breaches made in the\r\nbottom and sides, sunk to rights. And, indeed, I was glad not to have\r\nbeen a spectator of the havoc they made; because I am confident it would\r\nhave sensibly touched me, by bringing former passages into my mind which\r\nI had rather forget.\r\n\r\nI slept some hours, but perpetually disturbed with dreams of the place\r\nI had left, and the dangers I had escaped. However, upon waking I found\r\nmyself much recovered. It was now about eight o’clock at night, and the\r\ncaptain ordered supper immediately, thinking I had already fasted too\r\nlong. He entertained me with great kindness, observing me not to look\r\nwildly, or talk inconsistently; and when we were left alone, desired I\r\nwould relate to him my travels, and by what accident I came to be set\r\nadrift in that monstrous wooden chest. He said that about twelve o’clock\r\nat noon, as he was looking through his glass, he spied it at a distance,\r\nand thought it was a sail, which he had a mind to make, being not much\r\nout of his course, in hopes of buying some biscuit, his own beginning to\r\nfall short. That upon coming nearer, and finding his error, he sent out\r\nhis longboat, to discover what I was; that his men came back in a fright,\r\nswearing they had seen a swimming house. That he laughed at their folly,\r\nand went himself in the boat, ordering his men to take a strong cable\r\nalong with them. That the weather being calm, he rowed round me several\r\ntimes, observed my windows and the wire lattices that defended them.\r\nThat he discovered two staples upon one side, which was all of boards,\r\nwithout any passage for light. He then commanded his men to row up to\r\nthat side, and fastening a cable to one of the staples, ordered them to\r\ntow my chest, as he called it, towards the ship. When it was there, he\r\ngave directions to fasten another cable to the ring fixed in the cover,\r\nand to raise my chest with pulleys, which all the sailors were not able\r\nto do above two or three feet. He said they saw my stick and handkerchief\r\nthrust out of the hole, and concluded that some unhappy man must be shut\r\nup in the cavity. I asked whether he or the crew had seen any prodigious\r\nbirds in the air, about the time he first discovered me. To which he\r\nanswered, that discussing this matter with the sailors while I was\r\nasleep, one of them said he had observed three eagles flying towards the\r\nnorth, but remarked nothing of their being larger than the usual size,\r\nwhich I suppose must be imputed to the great height they were at; and\r\ncould not guess the reason of my question. I then asked the captain how\r\nfar he reckoned we might be from land. He said, by the best computation\r\nhe could make, we were at least a hundred leagues. I assured him that he\r\nmust be mistaken by almost half, for I had not left the country whence I\r\ncame above two hours before I dropped into the sea. Whereupon he began\r\nagain to think my brain was disturbed, of which he gave me a hint, and\r\nadvised me to go to bed in a cabin he had provided. I assured him I was\r\nwell refreshed with his good entertainment and company, and as much in\r\nmy senses as ever I was in my life. He then grew serious, and desired to\r\nask me freely whether I were not troubled in mind by the consciousness\r\nof some enormous crime, for which I was punished at the command of\r\nsome prince, by exposing me in that chest; as great criminals in other\r\ncountries have been forced to sea in a leaky vessel, without provisions;\r\nfor although he should be sorry to have taken so ill a man into his ship,\r\nyet he would engage his word to set me safe on shore, in the first port\r\nwhere we arrived. He added, that his suspicions were much increased by\r\nsome very absurd speeches I had delivered at first to the sailors, and\r\nafterwards to himself, in relation to my closet or chest, as well as by\r\nmy odd looks and behavior while I was at supper.\r\n\r\nI begged his patience to hear me tell my story, which I faithfully did,\r\nfrom the last time I left England to the moment he first discovered me.\r\nAnd as truth always forces its way into rational minds, so this honest\r\nworthy gentleman, who had some tincture of learning, and very good sense,\r\nwas immediately convinced of my candor and veracity. But, further to\r\nconfirm all I had said, I entreated him to give order that my cabinet\r\nbe brought, of which I had the key in my pocket; for he had already\r\ninformed me how the seamen disposed of my closet. I opened it in his\r\npresence, and showed him the small collection of rarities I made in the\r\ncountry from whence I had been so strangely delivered. There was the comb\r\nI had contrived out of the stumps of the king’s beard, and another of\r\nthe same material, but fixed into a paring of her majesty’s thumb nail,\r\nwhich served for the back. There was a collection of needles and pins,\r\nfrom a foot to half a yard long; four wasp stings like joiners’ tacks;\r\nsome combings of the queen’s hair; a gold ring which one day she made\r\nme a present of in a most obliging manner, taking it from her little\r\nfinger and throwing it over my head like a collar. I desired the captain\r\nwould please to accept this ring in return of his civilities; which he\r\nabsolutely refused. Lastly, I desired him to see the breeches I had then\r\non, which were made of a mouse’s skin.\r\n\r\nI could force nothing on him but a footman’s tooth, which I observed\r\nhim to examine with great curiosity, and found he had a fancy for it.\r\nHe received it with abundance of thanks, more than such a trifle could\r\ndeserve. It was drawn by an unskillful surgeon, in a mistake, from one of\r\nGlumdalclitch’s men, who was afflicted with the toothache, but it was as\r\nsound as any in his head. I got it cleaned, and put it into my cabinet.\r\nIt was about a foot long, and four inches in diameter.\r\n\r\nThe captain was very well satisfied with this plain relation I had given\r\nhim, and said he hoped, when we returned to England, I would oblige the\r\nworld by putting it on paper, and making it public. My answer was, that\r\nI thought we were already overstocked with books of travel; that nothing\r\ncould now pass which was not extraordinary; wherein I doubted some\r\nauthors less consulted truth than their own vanity or interest, or the\r\ndiversion of ignorant readers; that my story could contain little besides\r\ncommon events, without those ornamental descriptions of strange plants,\r\ntrees, birds, and other animals, or of the barbarous customs and idolatry\r\nof savage people, with which most writers abound. However, I thanked him\r\nfor his good opinion, and promised to take the matter into my thoughts.\r\n\r\nHe said he wondered at one thing very much, which was to hear me speak so\r\nloud; asking me whether the king and queen of that country were thick of\r\nhearing. I told him it was what I had been used to for above two years\r\npast, and that I admired as much at the voices of him and his men, who\r\nseemed to me only to whisper, and yet I could hear them well enough. But\r\nwhen I spoke in that country, it was like a man talking in the street to\r\nanother looking out from the top of a steeple, unless when I was placed\r\non a table, or held in any person’s hand. I told him, I had likewise\r\nobserved another thing, that when I first got into the ship, and the\r\nsailors stood all about me, I thought they were the most contemptible\r\nlittle creatures I had ever beheld. For, indeed, while I was in that\r\nprince’s country, I could never endure to look in a glass after my eyes\r\nhad been accustomed to such prodigious objects, because the comparison\r\ngave me so despicable a conceit of myself. The captain said that while\r\nwe were at supper he observed me to look at everything with a sort of\r\nwonder, and that I often seemed hardly able to contain my laughter, which\r\nhe knew not well how to take, but imputed it to some disorder in my\r\nbrain. I answered, it was very true; and I wondered how I could forbear,\r\nwhen I saw his dishes of the size of a silver threepence, a leg of pork\r\nhardly a mouthful, a cup not so big as a nutshell; and so I went on,\r\ndescribing the rest of his household stuff and provisions after the same\r\nmanner. For, although the queen had ordered a little equipage of all\r\nthings necessary for me, while I was in her service, yet my ideas were\r\nwholly taken up with what I saw on every side of me, and I winked at my\r\nown littleness as people do at their own faults. The captain understood\r\nmy raillery very well, and merrily replied with the old English proverb,\r\nthat he doubted my eyes were bigger than my belly, for he did not observe\r\nmy stomach so good, although I had fasted all day; and continuing in his\r\nmirth, protested he would have gladly given a hundred pounds to have seen\r\nmy closet in the eagle’s bill, and afterwards in its fall from so great a\r\nheight into the sea; which would certainly have been a most astonishing\r\nobject, worthy to have the description of it transmitted to future ages;\r\nand the comparison of Phaëthon was so obvious that he could not forbear\r\napplying it, although I did not much admire the conceit.\r\n\r\nThe captain, having been at Tonquin, was in his return to England\r\ndriven northeastward to the latitude of 44 degrees, and of longitude\r\n143. But meeting a trade-wind two days after I came on board him, we\r\nsailed southward a long time, and coasting New Holland, kept our course\r\nwest-south-west, and then south-south-west, till we doubled the Cape of\r\nGood Hope. Our voyage was very prosperous, but I shall not trouble the\r\nreader with a journal of it. The captain called in at one or two ports,\r\nand sent in his longboat for provisions and fresh water; but I never went\r\nout of the ship till we came into the Downs, which was on the third day\r\nof June, 1706, about nine months after my escape. I offered to leave my\r\ngoods in security for payment of my freight, but the captain protested he\r\nwould not receive one farthing. We took kind leave of each other, and I\r\nmade him promise he would come to see me at my house in Redriff. I hired\r\na horse and guide for five shillings, which I borrowed of the captain.\r\n\r\nAs I was on the road, observing the littleness of the houses, the trees,\r\nthe cattle, and the people, I began to think myself in Lilliput. I was\r\nafraid of trampling on every traveler I met, and often called aloud to\r\nhave them stand out of the way, so that I had like to have gotten one or\r\ntwo broken heads for my impertinence.\r\n\r\nWhen I came to my own house, for which I was forced to inquire, one of\r\nthe servants opening the door, I bent down to go in (like a goose under\r\na gate), for fear of striking my head. My wife ran out to embrace me,\r\nbut I stooped lower than her knees, thinking she could otherwise never\r\nbe able to reach my mouth. My daughter kneeled to ask my blessing, but\r\nI could not see her till she arose, having been so long used to stand\r\nwith my head and eyes erect to above sixty feet, and then I went to take\r\nher up with one hand by the waist. I looked down upon the servants, and\r\none or two friends who were in the house, as if they had been pigmies,\r\nand I a giant. I told my wife she had been too thrifty, for I found she\r\nhad starved herself and her daughter to nothing. In short, I behaved\r\nmyself so unaccountably that they were all of the captain’s opinion when\r\nhe first saw me, and concluded I had lost my wits. This I mention as an\r\ninstance of the great power of habit and prejudice.\r\n\r\nIn a little time, I and my family and friends came to a right\r\nunderstanding, but my wife protested I should never go to sea any more;\r\nalthough my evil destiny so ordered that she had not power to hinder me,\r\nas the reader may know hereafter. In the meantime, I here conclude the\r\nsecond part of my unfortunate voyages.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END OF THE SECOND PART.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA VOYAGE TO LAPUTA, BALNIBARBI, LUGGNAGG, GLUBBDUBDRIB, AND JAPAN\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n    THE AUTHOR SETS OUT ON HIS THIRD VOYAGE—IS TAKEN BY PIRATES—THE\r\n    MALICE OF A DUTCHMAN—HIS ARRIVAL AT AN ISLAND—HE IS RECEIVED\r\n    INTO LAPUTA.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had not been at home above ten days, when Captain William Robinson,\r\na Cornishman, commander of the Hopewell, a stout ship of three hundred\r\ntons, came to my house. I had formerly been surgeon of another ship\r\nwhere he was master and a fourth-part owner, in a voyage to the Levant.\r\nHe had always treated me more like a brother than an inferior officer;\r\nand hearing of my arrival, made me a visit, as I apprehended only out\r\nof friendship, for nothing passed more than what is usual after long\r\nabsences. But repeating his visits often, expressing his joy to find\r\nme in good health, asking whether I were now settled for life, adding\r\nthat he intended a voyage to the East Indies in about two months; at\r\nlast he plainly invited me, though with some apologies, to be surgeon of\r\nthe ship; that I should have another surgeon under me, besides our two\r\nmates; that my salary should be double to the usual pay; and that having\r\nexperienced my knowledge in sea affairs to be at least equal to his, he\r\nwould enter into any engagement to follow my advice, as much as if I had\r\nshared in the command.\r\n\r\nHe said so many other obliging things, and I knew him to be so honest a\r\nman, that I could not reject his proposal; the thirst I had of seeing\r\nthe world, notwithstanding my past misfortunes, continuing as violent as\r\never. The only difficulty that remained, was to persuade my wife, whose\r\nconsent, however, I at last obtained by the prospect of advantage she\r\nproposed to her children.\r\n\r\nWe set out on the 5th of August, 1706, and arrived at Fort St. George\r\nthe 11th of April, 1707, stayed there three weeks to refresh our crew,\r\nmany of whom were sick. From thence we went to Tonquin, where the captain\r\nresolved to continue some time, because many of the goods he intended\r\nto buy were not ready, nor could he expect to be dispatched in some\r\nmonths. Therefore, in hopes to defray some of the charges he must be\r\nat, he bought a sloop, loaded it with several sorts of goods wherewith\r\nthe Tonquinese usually trade to the neighboring islands, and putting\r\nfourteen men on board, whereof three were of the country, he appointed me\r\nmaster of the sloop, and gave me power to traffic for two months while he\r\ntransacted his affairs at Tonquin.\r\n\r\nWe had not sailed above three days, when a great storm arising, we were\r\ndriven five days to the north-north-east, and then to the east; after\r\nwhich we had fair weather, but still with a pretty strong gale from the\r\nwest. Upon the tenth day we were chased by two pirates, who soon overtook\r\nus; for my sloop was so deep laden, that she sailed very slow, neither\r\nwere we in a condition to defend ourselves. We were boarded about the\r\nsame time by both the pirates, who entered furiously at the head of their\r\nmen; but finding us all prostrate upon our faces (for so I gave order),\r\nthey pinioned us with strong ropes, and setting a guard upon us, went to\r\nsearch the sloop.\r\n\r\nI observed among them a Dutchman, who seemed to be of some authority,\r\nthough he was not commander of either ship. He knew us by our\r\ncountenances to be Englishmen, and jabbering to us in his own language,\r\nswore we should be tied back to back and thrown into the sea. I spoke\r\nDutch tolerably well; I told him who we were, and begged him, in\r\nconsideration of our being Christians and Protestants, of neighboring\r\ncountries in strict alliance, that he would move the captains to take\r\nsome pity on us. This inflamed his rage; he repeated his threatenings,\r\nand turning to his companions, spoke with great vehemence in the Japanese\r\nlanguage, as I suppose, often using the word _Christianos_.\r\n\r\nThe largest of the two pirate ships was commanded by a Japanese captain\r\nwho spoke a little Dutch, but very imperfectly. He came up to me, and\r\nafter several questions, which I answered in great humility, he said we\r\nshould not die. I made the captain a very low bow, and then turning to\r\nthe Dutchman, said I was sorry to find more mercy in a heathen than in a\r\nbrother Christian. But I had soon reason to repent those foolish words;\r\nfor that malicious reprobate, having often endeavored in vain to persuade\r\nboth the captains that I might be thrown into the sea (which they would\r\nnot yield to, after the promise made me that I should not die), however\r\nprevailed so far as to have a punishment inflicted on me, worse in all\r\nhuman appearance than death itself. My men were sent by an equal division\r\ninto both the pirate ships, and my sloop new manned. As to myself, it was\r\ndetermined that I should be set adrift in a small canoe, with paddles\r\nand a sail, and four days’ provisions; which last the Japanese captain\r\nwas so kind to double out of his own stores, and would permit no man to\r\nsearch me. I got down into the canoe, while the Dutchman, standing upon\r\nthe deck, loaded me with all the curses and injurious terms his language\r\ncould afford.\r\n\r\nAbout an hour before we saw the pirates, I had taken an observation,\r\nand found we were in the latitude of 46 N. and of longitude 183. When I\r\nwas at some distance from the pirates, I discovered by my pocket glass\r\nseveral islands to the southeast. I set up my sail, the wind being fair,\r\nwith a design to reach the nearest of those islands, which I made a shift\r\nto do in about three hours. It was all rocky; however, I got many birds’\r\neggs; and striking fire, I kindled some heath and dry seaweed, by which\r\nI roasted my eggs. I ate no other supper, being resolved to spare my\r\nprovisions as much as I could. I passed the night under the shelter of a\r\nrock, strewing some heath under me, and slept pretty well.\r\n\r\nThe next day I sailed to another island, and thence to a third and\r\nfourth, sometimes using my sail, and sometimes my paddles. But not to\r\ntrouble the reader with a particular account of my distresses, let it\r\nsuffice that on the fifth day I arrived at the last island in my sight,\r\nwhich lay south-south-east to the former.\r\n\r\nThis island was at a greater distance than I expected, and I did not\r\nreach it in less than five hours. I encompassed it almost round before\r\nI could find a convenient place to land in; which was a small creek,\r\nabout three times the wideness of my canoe. I found the island to be all\r\nrocky, only a little intermingled with tufts of grass, and sweet-smelling\r\nherbs. I took out my small provisions, and after having refreshed myself,\r\nI secured the remainder in a cave, whereof there were great numbers; I\r\ngathered plenty of eggs upon the rocks, and got a quantity of dry seaweed\r\nand parched grass, which I designed to kindle the next day, and roast\r\nmy eggs as well as I could, for I had about me my flint, steel, match,\r\nand burning-glass. I lay all night in the cave where I had lodged my\r\nprovisions. My bed was the same dry grass and seaweed which I intended\r\nfor fuel. I slept very little, for the disquiets of my mind prevailed\r\nover my weariness, and kept me awake. I considered how impossible it was\r\nto preserve my life in so desolate a place, and how miserable my end must\r\nbe: yet I found myself so listless and desponding, that I had not the\r\nheart to rise; and before I could get spirits enough to creep out of my\r\ncave, the day was far advanced. I walked awhile among the rocks; the sky\r\nwas perfectly clear, and the sun so hot, that I was forced to turn my\r\nface from it; when all on a sudden it became obscured, as I thought, in a\r\nmanner very different from what happens by the interposition of a cloud.\r\nI turned back, and perceived a vast opaque body between me and the sun,\r\nmoving forwards towards the island; it seemed to be about two miles high,\r\nand hid the sun six or seven minutes; but I did not observe the air to\r\nbe much colder, or the sky more darkened, than if I had stood under the\r\nshade of a mountain. As it approached nearer over the place where I was,\r\nit appeared to me a firm substance, the bottom flat, smooth, and shining\r\nvery bright from the reflection of the sea below. I stood upon a height\r\nabout two hundred yards from the shore, and saw this vast body descending\r\nalmost to a parallel with me, at less than an English mile distance. I\r\ntook out my pocket perspective, and could plainly discover numbers of\r\npeople moving up and down the sides of it, which appeared to be sloping;\r\nbut what those people were doing I was not able to distinguish.\r\n\r\nThe natural love of life gave me some inward motions of joy, and I was\r\nready to entertain a hope that this adventure might, someway or other,\r\nhelp to deliver me from the desolate place and condition I was in. But at\r\nthe same time, the reader can hardly conceive my astonishment, to behold\r\nan island in the air, inhabited by men, who were able (as it should\r\nseem) to raise or sink, or put it into a progressive motion, as they\r\npleased. But not being at that time in a disposition to philosophize upon\r\nthis phenomenon, I rather chose to observe what course the island would\r\ntake, because it seemed for awhile to stand still. Yet soon after, it\r\nadvanced nearer, and I could see the sides of it encompassed with several\r\ngradations of galleries, and stairs at certain intervals to descend from\r\none to the other. In the lowest gallery, I beheld some people fishing\r\nwith long angling rods, and others looking on. I waved my cap (for my hat\r\nwas long since worn out) and my handkerchief towards the island; and upon\r\nits nearer approach, I called and shouted with the utmost strength of my\r\nvoice; and then looking circumspectly, I beheld a crowd gathered to that\r\nside which was most in my view. I found by their pointing towards me and\r\nto each other, that they plainly discovered me, although they made no\r\nreturn to my shouting. But I could see four or five men running in great\r\nhaste up the stairs to the top of the island, who then disappeared. I\r\nhappened rightly to conjecture that these were sent for orders to some\r\nperson in authority upon this occasion.\r\n\r\nThe number of people increased, and in less than half an hour the island\r\nwas moved, and raised in such a manner that the lowest gallery appeared\r\nin a parallel of less than a hundred yards’ distance from the height\r\nwhere I stood. I then put myself in the most supplicating postures,\r\nand spoke in the humblest accent, but received no answer. Those who\r\nstood nearest over against me, seemed to be persons of distinction, as\r\nI supposed by their habit. They conferred earnestly with each other,\r\nlooking often upon me. At length, one of them called out in a clear,\r\npolite, smooth dialect, not unlike in sound to the Italian; and therefore\r\nI returned an answer in that language, hoping at least that the cadence\r\nmight be more agreeable to his ears. Although neither of us understood\r\nthe other, yet my meaning was easily known, for the people saw the\r\ndistress I was in.\r\n\r\nThey made signs for me to come down from the rock, and go towards the\r\nshore, which I accordingly did; and the flying island being raised to a\r\nconvenient height, the verge directly over me, a chain was let down from\r\nthe lowest gallery, with a seat fastened to the bottom, to which I fixed\r\nmyself, and was drawn up by pulleys.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n    THE HUMORS AND DISPOSITIONS OF THE LAPUTIANS DESCRIBED—AN\r\n    ACCOUNT OF THEIR LEARNING—OF THE KING AND HIS COURT—THE\r\n    AUTHOR’S RECEPTION THERE—THE INHABITANTS SUBJECT TO FEARS AND\r\n    DISQUIETUDES—AN ACCOUNT OF THE WOMEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt my alighting, I was surrounded with a crowd of people, but those who\r\nstood nearest seemed to be of better quality. They beheld me with all the\r\nmarks and circumstances of wonder, neither indeed was I much in their\r\ndebt, having never till then seen a race of mortals so singular in their\r\nshapes, habits, and countenances. Their heads were all reclined either\r\nto the right or the left; one of their eyes turned inward, and the other\r\ndirectly up to the zenith. Their outward garments were adorned with the\r\nfigures of suns, moons, and stars, interwoven with those of fiddles,\r\nflutes, harps, trumpets, guitars, harpsichords, and many more instruments\r\nof music unknown to us in Europe. I observed, here and there, many in\r\nthe habit of servants, with a blown bladder fastened like a flail to\r\nthe end of a short stick, which they carried in their hands. In each\r\nbladder was a small quantity of dried peas, or little pebbles (as I was\r\nafterwards informed). With these bladders they now and then flapped the\r\nmouths and ears of those who stood near them, of which practice I could\r\nnot then conceive the meaning. It seems the minds of these people are\r\nso taken up with intense speculations, that they neither can speak, nor\r\nattend to the discourses of others without being roused by some external\r\ntaction upon the organs of speech and hearing; for which reason, those\r\npersons who are able to afford it always keep a flapper (the original is\r\n_climenole_) in their family, as one of their domestics; nor ever walk\r\nabroad or make visits without him. And the business of this officer is,\r\nwhen two or three more persons are in company, gently to strike with\r\nhis bladder the mouth of him who is to speak, and the right ear of him\r\nor them to whom the speaker addresses himself. This flapper is likewise\r\nemployed diligently to attend his master in his walks, and upon occasion\r\nto give him a soft flap on his eyes; because he is always so wrapped\r\nup in cogitation, that he is in manifest danger of falling down every\r\nprecipice, and bouncing his head against every post; and in the streets,\r\nof jostling others or being jostled himself into the kennel.\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to give the reader this information, without which he\r\nwould be at the same loss with me to understand the proceedings of these\r\npeople, as they conducted me up the stairs to the top of the island, and\r\nthence to the royal palace. While we were ascending they forgot several\r\ntimes what they were about, and left me to myself, till their memories\r\nwere again roused by their flappers: for they appeared altogether unmoved\r\nby the sight of my foreign habit and countenance, and by the shouts of\r\nthe vulgar, whose thoughts and minds were more disengaged.\r\n\r\nAt last we entered the palace, and proceeded into the chamber of\r\npresence, where I saw the king seated on his throne, attended on each\r\nside by persons of prime quality. Before the throne was a large table\r\nfilled with globes and spheres, and mathematical instruments of all\r\nkinds. His majesty took not the least notice of us, although our\r\nentrance was not without sufficient noise, by the concourse of all\r\npersons belonging to the court. But he was then deep in a problem; and\r\nwe attended at least an hour, before he could solve it. There stood by\r\nhim on each side a young page, with flaps in their hands, and when they\r\nsaw he was at leisure, one of them gently struck his mouth, and the other\r\nhis right ear; at which he started like one awaked on the sudden, and\r\nlooking towards me and the company I was in, recollected the occasion of\r\nour coming, whereof he had been informed before. He spoke some words,\r\nwhereupon immediately a young man with a flap came up to my side, and\r\nflapped me gently on the right ear; but I made signs, as well as I could,\r\nthat I had no occasion for such an instrument; which, as I afterwards\r\nfound, gave his majesty and the whole court a very mean opinion of my\r\nunderstanding. The king, as far as I could conjecture, asked me several\r\nquestions, and I addressed myself to him in all the languages I had. When\r\nit was found that I could neither understand nor be understood, I was\r\nconducted by the king’s order to an apartment in his palace (this prince\r\nbeing distinguished above all his predecessors for his hospitality to\r\nstrangers), where two servants were appointed to attend me. My dinner\r\nwas brought, and four persons of quality, whom I remembered to have\r\nseen very near the king’s person, did me the honor to dine with me. We\r\nhad two courses of three dishes each. In the first course, there was a\r\nshoulder of mutton cut into an equilateral triangle, a piece of beef\r\ninto a rhomboid, and a pudding into a cycloid. The second course was two\r\nducks trussed up in the form of fiddles; sausages and puddings resembling\r\nflutes and hautboys, and a breast of veal in the shape of a harp. The\r\nservants cut our bread into cones, cylinders, parallelograms, and several\r\nother mathematical figures.\r\n\r\nWhile we were at dinner, I made bold to ask the names of several things\r\nin their language, and those noble persons, by the assistance of their\r\nflappers, delighted to give me answers, hoping to raise my admiration of\r\ntheir great abilities, if I could be brought to converse with them. I was\r\nsoon able to call for bread and drink, or whatever else I wanted.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner my company withdrew, and a person was sent to me by the\r\nking’s order, attended by a flapper. He brought with him pen, ink, and\r\npaper, and three or four books, giving me to understand by signs that\r\nhe was sent to teach me the language. We sat together four hours, in\r\nwhich time I wrote down a great number of words in columns, with the\r\ntranslations over against them; I likewise made a shift to learn several\r\nshort sentences, for my tutor would order one of my servants to fetch\r\nsomething, to turn about, to make a bow, to sit, or stand, or walk,\r\nand the like. Then I took down the sentence in writing. He showed me\r\nalso, in one of his books, the figures of the sun, moon, and stars, the\r\nzodiac, the tropics, and polar circles, together with the denominations\r\nof many planes and solids. He gave me the names and descriptions of all\r\nthe musical instruments, and the general terms of art in playing on\r\neach of them. After he had left me, I placed all my words, with their\r\ninterpretations, in alphabetical order. And thus, in a few days, by the\r\nhelp of a very faithful memory, I got some insight into their language.\r\n\r\nThe word which I interpret the Flying or Floating Island, is in the\r\noriginal _Laputa_, whereof I could never learn the true etymology. _Lap_,\r\nin the old obsolete language, signifies high; and _untuh_, a governor;\r\nfrom which they say, by corruption, was derived _Laputa_ from _Lapuntah_.\r\nBut I do not approve of this derivation, which seems to be a little\r\nstrained. I ventured to offer to the learned among them a conjecture of\r\nmy own, that Laputa was _quasi lap outed_; _lap_, signifying properly the\r\ndancing of the sunbeams in the sea, and _outed_, a wing; which, however,\r\nI shall not obtrude, but submit to the judicious reader.\r\n\r\nThose to whom the king had intrusted me, observing how ill I was clad,\r\nordered a tailor to come next morning, and take my measure for a suit of\r\nclothes. This operator did his office after a different manner from those\r\nof his trade in Europe. He first took my altitude by a quadrant, and\r\nthen, with rule and compasses, described the dimensions and outlines of\r\nmy whole body, all which he entered upon paper; and in six days brought\r\nmy clothes very ill made, and quite out of shape, by happening to mistake\r\na figure in the calculation. But my comfort was, that I observed such\r\naccidents very frequent, and little regarded.\r\n\r\nDuring my confinement for want of clothes, and by an indisposition that\r\nheld me some days longer, I much enlarged my dictionary; and when I went\r\nnext to court, was able to understand many things the king spoke, and\r\nto return him some kind of answers. His majesty had given orders that\r\nthe island should move northeast-and-by-east to the vertical point over\r\nLagado, the metropolis of the whole kingdom below, upon the firm earth.\r\nIt was about ninety leagues distant, and our voyage lasted four days and\r\na half. I was not in the least sensible of the progressive motion made\r\nin the air by the island. On the second morning, about eleven o’clock,\r\nthe king himself in person, attended by his nobility, courtiers, and\r\nofficers, having prepared all their musical instruments, played on them\r\nfor three hours without intermission, so that I was quite stunned with\r\nthe noise; neither could I possibly guess the meaning till my tutor\r\ninformed me. He said that the people of their island had their ears\r\nadapted to hear the music of the spheres, which always played at certain\r\nperiods, and the court was now prepared to bear their part, in whatever\r\ninstrument they most excelled.\r\n\r\nIn our journey towards Lagado, the capital city, his majesty ordered\r\nthat the island should stop over certain towns and villages, whence he\r\nmight receive the petitions of his subjects. And to this purpose several\r\npackthreads were let down, with small weights at the bottom. On these\r\npackthreads the people strung their petitions, which mounted up directly,\r\nlike the scraps of paper fastened by schoolboys at the end of the string\r\nthat holds their kite. Sometimes we received wine and victuals from\r\nbelow, which were drawn up by pulleys.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge I had in mathematics gave me great assistance in acquiring\r\ntheir phraseology, which depended much upon that science and music; and\r\nin the latter I was not unskilled. Their ideas are perpetually conversant\r\nin lines and figures. If they would, for example, praise the beauty\r\nof a woman or any other animal, they describe it by rhombs, circles,\r\nparallelograms, ellipses, and other geometrical terms, or by words of\r\nart drawn from music, needless here to repeat. I observed in the king’s\r\nkitchen all sorts of mathematical and musical instruments, after the\r\nfigures of which they cut up the joints that were served to his majesty’s\r\ntable.\r\n\r\nTheir houses are very ill-built, the walls bevel, without one right\r\nangle in any apartment; and this defect arises from the contempt they\r\nbear to practical geometry, which they despise as vulgar and mechanic;\r\nthose instructions they give being too refined for the intellects of\r\ntheir workmen, which occasions perpetual mistakes. And although they are\r\ndexterous enough upon a piece of paper, in the management of the rule,\r\nthe pencil, and the divider, yet in the common actions and behavior of\r\nlife, I have not seen a more clumsy, awkward, and unhandy people, nor\r\nso slow and perplexed in their conceptions upon all other subjects,\r\nexcept those of mathematics and music. They are very bad reasoners,\r\nand vehemently given to opposition, unless when they happen to be of\r\nthe right opinion, which is seldom their case. Imagination, fancy, and\r\ninvention they are wholly strangers to, nor have any words in their\r\nlanguage by which those ideas can be expressed; the whole compass of\r\ntheir thoughts and mind being shut up within the two forementioned\r\nsciences.\r\n\r\nMost of them, and especially those who deal in the astronomical part,\r\nhave great faith in judicial astrology, although they are ashamed to\r\nown it publicly. But what I chiefly admired, and thought altogether\r\nunaccountable, was the strong disposition I observed in them towards news\r\nand politics, perpetually inquiring into public affairs, giving their\r\njudgments in matters of state, and passionately disputing every inch of\r\na party opinion. I have indeed observed the same disposition among most\r\nof the mathematicians I have known in Europe, although I could never\r\ndiscover the least analogy between the two sciences; unless those people\r\nsuppose, that because the smallest circle has as many degrees as the\r\nlargest, therefore the regulation and management of the world require no\r\nmore abilities than the handling and turning of a globe; but I rather\r\ntake this quality to spring from a very common infirmity of human nature,\r\ninclining us to be more curious and conceited in matters where we have\r\nleast concern, and for which we are at least adapted either by study or\r\nnature.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “_At last we entered the palace_”\r\n\r\n_Page 177_]\r\n\r\nThese people are under continual disquietudes, never enjoying a minute’s\r\npeace of mind; and their disturbances proceed from causes which very\r\nlittle affect the rest of mortals. Their apprehensions arise from several\r\nchanges they dread in the celestial bodies: for instance, that the\r\nearth, by the continual approaches of the sun towards it, must in course\r\nof time be absorbed or swallowed up; that the face of the sun will by\r\ndegrees be incrusted with its own effluvia, and give no more light to\r\nthe world; that the earth very narrowly escaped a brush from the tail\r\nof the last comet, which would have infallibly reduced it to ashes; and\r\nthat the next, which they have calculated for one-and-thirty years hence,\r\nwill probably destroy us. For if, in its perihelion, it should approach\r\nwithin a certain degree of the sun (as by their calculations they have\r\nreason to dread), it will conceive a degree of heat ten thousand times\r\nmore intense than that of red-hot glowing iron; and, in its absence\r\nfrom the sun, carry a blazing tail ten hundred thousand and fourteen\r\nmiles long, through which if the earth should pass at the distance of\r\none hundred thousand miles from the nucleus or main body of the comet,\r\nit must in its passage be set on fire, and reduced to ashes; that the\r\nsun, daily spending its rays without any nutriment to supply them, will\r\nat last be wholly consumed and annihilated; which must be attended with\r\nthe destruction of this earth, and of all the planets that receive their\r\nlight from it.\r\n\r\nThey are so perpetually alarmed with the apprehensions of these and the\r\nlike impending dangers, that they can neither sleep quietly in their\r\nbeds, nor have any relish for the common pleasures or amusements of\r\nlife. When they meet an acquaintance in the morning, the first question\r\nis about the sun’s health; how he looked at his setting and rising,\r\nand what hopes they have to avoid the stroke of the approaching comet.\r\nThis conversation they are apt to run into with the same temper that\r\nboys discover in delighting to hear terrible stories of sprites and\r\nhobgoblins, which they greedily listen to, and dare not go to bed for\r\nfear.\r\n\r\nThe women of the island have abundance of vivacity; they contemn their\r\nhusbands, and are exceedingly fond of strangers, whereof there is always\r\na considerable number from the continent below, attending at court,\r\neither upon affairs of the several towns and corporations, or their\r\nown particular occasions, but are much despised, because they want the\r\nsame endowments. Among these the ladies choose their gallants. But the\r\nvexation is, that they act with too much ease and security; for the\r\nhusband is always so wrapped in speculation, that the mistress and lover\r\nmay proceed to the greatest familiarities before his face, if he be but\r\nprovided with paper and implements, and without his flapper at his side.\r\n\r\nThe wives and daughters lament their confinement to the island, although\r\nI think it the most delicious spot of ground in the world: and although\r\nthey live here in the greatest plenty and magnificence, and are allowed\r\nto do whatever they please, they long to see the world, and take the\r\ndiversions of the metropolis; which they are not allowed to do without a\r\nparticular license from the king; and this is not easy to be obtained,\r\nbecause the people of quality have found, by frequent experience, how\r\nhard it is to persuade their women to return from below. I was told that\r\na great court lady, who had several children, is married to the prime\r\nminister (the richest subject in the kingdom, a very graceful person,\r\nextremely fond of her) and lives in the finest palace in the island, went\r\ndown to Lagado, on the pretense of health, there hid herself for several\r\nmonths, till the king sent a warrant to search for her, and she was found\r\nin an obscure eating house all in rags, having pawned her clothes to\r\nmaintain an old deformed footman, who beat her every day, and in whose\r\ncompany she was taken, much against her will. And although her husband\r\nreceived her with all possible kindness, and without the least reproach,\r\nshe soon after contrived to steal down again with all her jewels, to the\r\nsame gallant, and has not been heard of since.\r\n\r\nThis may perhaps pass with the reader rather for a European or English\r\nstory, than for one of a country so remote. But he may please to\r\nconsider, that the caprices of womankind are not limited by any climate\r\nor nation, and that they are much more uniform than can be easily\r\nimagined.\r\n\r\nIn about a month’s time I had made a tolerable proficiency in their\r\nlanguage, and was able to answer most of the king’s questions, when I had\r\nthe honor to attend him. His majesty discovered not the least curiosity\r\nto inquire into the laws, government, history, religion, or manners of\r\nthe countries where I had been; but confined his questions to the state\r\nof mathematics, and received the account I gave him with great contempt\r\nand indifference, though often roused by his flapper on each side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n    A PHENOMENON SOLVED BY MODERN PHILOSOPHY AND ASTRONOMY—THE\r\n    LAPUTIANS’ GREAT IMPROVEMENTS IN THE LATTER—THE KING’S METHOD\r\n    OF SUPPRESSING INSURRECTIONS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI desired leave of this prince to see the curiosities of the island,\r\nwhich he was graciously pleased to grant, and ordered my tutor to attend\r\nme. I chiefly wanted to know to what cause in art or in nature it owed\r\nits several motions, whereof I will now give a philosophical account to\r\nthe reader.\r\n\r\nThe flying or floating island is exactly circular, its diameter 7837\r\nyards, or about four miles and a half, and consequently contains ten\r\nthousand acres. It is three hundred yards thick. The bottom or under\r\nsurface, which appears to those who view it from below, is one even\r\nregular plate of adamant, shooting up to the height of about two hundred\r\nyards. Above it lie the several minerals in their usual order, and over\r\nall is a coat of rich mold, ten or twelve feet deep. This declivity of\r\nthe upper surface, from the circumference to the center, is the natural\r\ncause why all the dews and rains which fall upon the island are conveyed\r\nin small rivulets towards the middle, where they are emptied into four\r\nlarge basins, each of about half a mile in circuit, and two hundred yards\r\ndistant from the center. From these basins the water is continually\r\nexhaled by the sun in the daytime, which effectually prevents their\r\noverflowing. Besides, as it is in the power of the monarch to raise the\r\nisland above the region of clouds and vapors, he can prevent the falling\r\nof dews and rains whenever he pleases. For the highest clouds cannot\r\nrise above two miles, as naturalists agree; at least they were never\r\nknown to do so in that country.\r\n\r\nAt the center of the island there is a chasm about fifty yards in\r\ndiameter, whence the astronomers descend into a large dome, which is\r\ntherefore called _flandona gagnole_, or the Astronomer’s Cave, situated\r\nat the depth of a hundred yards beneath the upper surface of the\r\nadamant. In this cave are twenty lamps continually burning, which from\r\nthe reflection of the adamant cast a strong light into every part. The\r\nplace is stored with great variety of sextants, quadrants, telescopes,\r\nastrolabes, and other astronomical instruments. But the greatest\r\ncuriosity, upon which the fate of the island depends, is a loadstone of a\r\nprodigious size, in shape resembling a weaver’s shuttle. It is in length\r\nsix yards, and in the thickest part at least three yards over. This\r\nmagnet is sustained by a very strong axle of adamant passing through its\r\nmiddle, upon which it plays, and is poised so exactly that the weakest\r\nhand can turn it. It is hooped round with a hollow cylinder of adamant,\r\nfour feet deep, as many thick, and twelve yards in diameter, placed\r\nhorizontally, and supported by eight adamantine feet, each six yards\r\nhigh. In the middle of the concave side there is a groove twelve inches\r\ndeep, in which the extremities of the axle are lodged, and turned round\r\nas there is occasion.\r\n\r\nThe stone cannot be moved from its place by any force, because the hoop\r\nand its feet are one continued piece with that body of adamant which\r\nconstitutes the bottom of the island.\r\n\r\nBy means of this loadstone, the island is made to rise and fall, and\r\nmove from one place to another. For, with respect to that part of the\r\nearth over which the monarch presides, the stone is indued at one of\r\nits sides with an attractive power, and at the other with a repulsive.\r\nUpon placing the magnet erect, with its attracting end toward the earth,\r\nthe island descends; but when the repelling extremity points downwards,\r\nthe island mounts directly upwards. When the position of the stone is\r\noblique, the motion of the island is so too: for in this magnet the\r\nforces always act in lines parallel to its direction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBy this oblique motion the island is conveyed to different parts of the\r\nmonarch’s dominions. To explain the manner of its progress, let _A B_\r\nrepresent a line drawn across the dominions of Balnibarbi. Let the line\r\n_c d_ represent the loadstone, of which let _d_ be the repelling end\r\nand _c_ the attracting end, the island being over _C_; let the stone be\r\nplaced in the position _c d_, with its repelling end downwards; then the\r\nisland will be driven upwards obliquely towards _D_. When it is arrived\r\nat _D_, let the stone be turned upon its axle till its attracting end\r\npoints towards _E_, and then the island will be carried obliquely towards\r\n_E_; where, if the stone be again turned upon its axle till it stands\r\nin the position _E F_, with its repelling point downwards, the island\r\nwill rise obliquely towards _F_, where, by directing the attracting end\r\ntowards _G_, the island may be carried to _G_, and from _G_ to _H_, by\r\nturning the stone so as to make its repelling extremity point directly\r\ndownwards. And thus by changing the situation of the stone as often as\r\nthere is occasion, the island is made to rise and fall by turns in an\r\noblique direction, and by those alternate risings and fallings (the\r\nobliquity being not considerable) is conveyed from one part of the\r\ndominions to the other.\r\n\r\nBut it must be observed, that this island cannot move beyond the extent\r\nof the dominions below, nor can it rise above the height of four miles.\r\nFor which the astronomers (who have written large systems concerning the\r\nstone) assign the following reason: that the magnetic virtue does not\r\nextend beyond the distance of four miles, and that the mineral which\r\nacts upon the stone in the bowels of the earth, and in the sea about six\r\nleagues distant from the shore, is not diffused through the whole globe,\r\nbut terminated with the limits of the king’s dominions; and it was easy,\r\nfrom the great advantage of such a superior situation, for a prince to\r\nbring under his obedience whatever country lay within the attraction of\r\nthat magnet.\r\n\r\nWhen the stone is put parallel to the plane of the horizon, the island\r\nstands still; for in that case, the extremities of it being at equal\r\ndistance from the earth, act with equal force, the one in drawing\r\ndownwards, the other in pushing upwards, and consequently no motion can\r\ninsue.\r\n\r\nThis loadstone is under the care of certain astronomers, who from time\r\nto time give it such positions as the monarch directs. They spend the\r\ngreatest part of their lives in observing the celestial bodies, which\r\nthey do by the assistance of glasses far excelling ours in goodness. This\r\nadvantage has enabled them to extend their discoveries much farther than\r\nour astronomers in Europe; for they have made a catalogue of ten thousand\r\nfixed stars, whereas the largest of ours do not contain above one-third\r\npart of that number. They have likewise discovered two lesser stars, or\r\nsatellites, which revolve about Mars; whereof the innermost is distant\r\nfrom the center of the primary planet exactly three of the diameters,\r\nand the outermost, five; the former revolves in the space of ten hours,\r\nand the latter in twenty-one and a half; so that the squares of their\r\nperiodical times are very near in the same proportion with the cubes of\r\ntheir distance from the center of Mars; which evidently shows them to\r\nbe governed by the same law of gravitation that influences the other\r\nheavenly bodies.\r\n\r\nThey have observed ninety-three different comets, and settled their\r\nperiods with great exactness. If this be true (and they affirm it with\r\ngreat confidence), it is much to be wished that their observations were\r\nmade public, whereby the theory of comets, which at present is very lame\r\nand defective, might be brought to the same perfection with other parts\r\nof astronomy.\r\n\r\nThe king would be the most absolute prince in the universe, if he\r\ncould but prevail on a ministry to join with him; but these, having\r\ntheir estates below on the continent, and considering that the office\r\nof a favorite has a very uncertain tenure, would never consent to the\r\nenslaving their country.\r\n\r\nIf any town should engage in rebellion or mutiny, fall into violent\r\nfactions, or refuse to pay the usual tribute, the king has two methods\r\nof reducing them to obedience. The first and the mildest course is by\r\nkeeping the island hovering over such a town, and the lands about it,\r\nwhereby he can deprive them of the benefit of the sun and the rain, and\r\nconsequently afflict the inhabitants with dearth and diseases and if\r\nthe crime deserve it, they are at the same time pelted from above with\r\ngreat stones, against which they have no defense but by creeping into\r\ncellars or caves, while the roofs of their houses are beaten to pieces.\r\nBut if they still continue obstinate, or offer to raise insurrections,\r\nhe proceeds to the last remedy, by letting the island drop directly\r\nupon their heads, which makes a universal destruction both of houses\r\nand men. However, this is an extremity to which the prince is seldom\r\ndriven, neither indeed is he willing to put it in execution; nor dare his\r\nministers advise him to an action, which, as it would render them odious\r\nto the people, so it would be a great damage to their own estates, which\r\nlie all below, for the island is the king’s demesne.\r\n\r\nBut there is still indeed a more weighty reason, why the kings of this\r\ncountry have been always averse from executing so terrible an action,\r\nunless upon the utmost necessity. For if the town intended to be\r\ndestroyed should have in it any tall rocks, as it generally falls out in\r\nthe larger cities, a situation probably chosen at first with a view to\r\nprevent such a catastrophe; or if it abound in high spires or pillars\r\nof stone, a sudden fall might endanger the bottom or under surface of\r\nthe island, which, although it consists, as I have said, of one entire\r\nadamant, two hundred yards thick, might happen to crack by too great a\r\nshock, or burst by approaching too near the fires from the houses below,\r\nas the backs, both of iron and stone, will often do in our chimneys. Of\r\nall this the people are well apprised, and understand how far to carry\r\ntheir obstinacy, where their liberty or property is concerned. And the\r\nking, when he is highest provoked, and most determined to press a city\r\nto rubbish, orders the island to descend with great gentleness, out of\r\na pretense of tenderness to his people, but indeed for fear of breaking\r\nthe adamantine bottom; in which case, it is the opinion of all their\r\nphilosophers, that the loadstone could no longer hold it up, and the\r\nwhole mass would fall to the ground.\r\n\r\nBy a fundamental law of this realm, neither the king nor either of his\r\ntwo elder sons are permitted to leave the island; nor the queen, till she\r\nis past childbearing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n    THE AUTHOR LEAVES LAPUTA—IS CONVEYED TO BALNIBARBI—ARRIVES AT\r\n    THE METROPOLIS—A DESCRIPTION OF THE METROPOLIS AND THE COUNTRY\r\n    ADJOINING—THE AUTHOR HOSPITABLY RECEIVED BY A GREAT LORD—HIS\r\n    CONVERSATION WITH THAT LORD.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough I cannot say that I was ill-treated in this island, yet I must\r\nconfess I thought myself too much neglected, not without some degree of\r\ncontempt; for neither prince nor people appeared to be curious in any\r\npart of knowledge, except mathematics and music, wherein I was far their\r\ninferior, and upon that account very little regarded.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, after having seen all the curiosities of the island,\r\nI was very desirous to leave it, being heartily weary of those people.\r\nThey were indeed excellent in two sciences for which I have great esteem,\r\nand wherein I am not unversed; but at the same time so abstracted\r\nand involved in speculation that I never met with such disagreeable\r\ncompanions. I conversed only with women, tradesmen, flappers, and court\r\npages, during two months of my abode there, by which at last I rendered\r\nmyself extremely contemptible; yet these were the only people from whom I\r\ncould ever receive a reasonable answer.\r\n\r\nI had obtained, by hard study, a good degree of knowledge in their\r\nlanguage; I was weary of being confined to an island where I received so\r\nlittle countenance, and resolved to leave it with the first opportunity.\r\n\r\nThere was a great lord at court, nearly related to the king, and for\r\nthat reason alone used with respect. He was universally reckoned the\r\nmost ignorant and stupid person among them. He had performed many\r\neminent services for the crown, had great natural and acquired parts,\r\nadorned with integrity and honor; but so ill an ear for music, that his\r\ndetractors reported he had been often known to beat time in the wrong\r\nplace; neither could his tutors without extreme difficulty teach him to\r\ndemonstrate the most easy proposition in mathematics. He was pleased to\r\nshow me many marks of favor, often did me the honor of a visit, desired\r\nto be informed in the affairs of Europe, the laws and customs, the\r\nmanners and learning of the several countries where I had traveled. He\r\nlistened to me with great attention, and made very wise observations on\r\nall I spoke. He had two flappers attending him for state, but never made\r\nuse of them, except at court and in visits of ceremony; and would always\r\ncommand them to withdraw when we were alone together.\r\n\r\nI entreated this illustrious person to intercede in my behalf with his\r\nmajesty for leave to depart; which he accordingly did, as he was pleased\r\nto tell me, with regret; for indeed he had made me several offers, very\r\nadvantageous, which, however, I refused, with expressions of the highest\r\nacknowledgment.\r\n\r\nOn the 16th day of February I took leave of his majesty and the court.\r\nThe king made me a present to the value of about two hundred pounds\r\nEnglish, and my protector his kinsman as much more, together with a\r\nletter of recommendation to a friend of his in Lagado, the metropolis;\r\nthe island being then hovering over a mountain about two miles from it,\r\nI was let down from the lowest gallery, in the same manner as I had been\r\ntaken up.\r\n\r\nThe continent, as far as it is subject to the monarch of the flying\r\nisland, passes under the general name of Balnibarbi; and the metropolis,\r\nas I said before, is called Lagado. I felt some little satisfaction in\r\nfinding myself on firm ground. I walked to the city without any concern,\r\nbeing clad like one of the natives, and sufficiently instructed to\r\nconverse with them. I soon found out the person’s house to whom I was\r\nrecommended, presented my letter from his friend the grandee in the\r\nisland, and was received with much kindness. This great lord, whose name\r\nwas Munodi, ordered me an apartment in his own house, where I continued\r\nduring my stay, and was entertained in a most hospitable manner.\r\n\r\nThe next morning after my arrival he took me in his chariot to see the\r\ntown, which is about half the bigness of London, but the houses very\r\nstrangely built, and most of them out of repair. The people in the\r\nstreets walked fast, looked wild, their eyes fixed, and were generally in\r\nrags. We passed through one of the town gates, and went about three miles\r\ninto the country, where I saw many laborers working with several sorts of\r\ntools in the ground, but was not able to conjecture what they were about;\r\nneither did I observe any expectation either of corn or grass, although\r\nthe soil appeared to be excellent. I could not forbear admiring at these\r\nodd appearances, both in town and country; and I made bold to desire my\r\nconductor that he would be pleased to explain to me what could be meant\r\nby so many busy heads, hands, and faces, both in the streets and the\r\nfields, because I did not discover any good effects they produced; but\r\non the contrary, I never knew a soil so unhappily cultivated, houses so\r\nill-contrived and so ruinous, or a people whose countenances and habit\r\nexpressed so much misery and want.\r\n\r\nThis Lord Munodi was a person of the first rank, and had been some\r\nyears governor of Lagado; but by a cabal of ministers was discharged\r\nfor insufficiency. However, the king treated him with tenderness, as a\r\nwell-meaning man, but of a low contemptible understanding.\r\n\r\nWhen I gave that free censure of the country and its inhabitants, he\r\nmade no further answer than by telling me that I had not been long\r\nenough among them to form a judgment; and that the different nations of\r\nthe world had different customs, with other common topics to the same\r\npurpose. But when we returned to his palace, he asked me how I liked\r\nthe building, what absurdities I observed, and what quarrel I had with\r\nthe dress and looks of his domestics. This he might safely do, because\r\neverything about him was magnificent, regular, and polite. I answered\r\nthat his excellency’s prudence, quality, and fortune had exempted him\r\nfrom those defects which folly and beggary had produced in others. He\r\nsaid if I would go with him to his country house, about twenty miles\r\ndistant, where his estate lay, there would be more leisure for this\r\nkind of conversation. I told his excellency that I was entirely at his\r\ndisposal, and accordingly we set out next morning.\r\n\r\nDuring our journey he made me observe the several methods used by farmers\r\nin managing their lands, which to me were wholly unaccountable; for,\r\nexcept in some very few places, I could not discover one ear of corn or\r\nblade of grass. But, in three hours’ traveling, the scene was wholly\r\naltered; we came into a most beautiful country; farmers’ houses at small\r\ndistances, neatly built; the fields enclosed, containing vineyards,\r\ncorn-grounds and meadows. Neither do I remember to have seen a more\r\ndelightful prospect. His excellency observed my countenance to clear up;\r\nhe told me with a sigh that there his estate began, and would continue\r\nthe same till we should come to his house; that his countrymen ridiculed\r\nand despised him for managing his affairs no better, and for setting so\r\nill an example to the kingdom, which however was followed by very few,\r\nsuch as were old and willful and weak, like himself.\r\n\r\nWe came at length to the house, which was indeed a noble structure, built\r\naccording to the best rules of ancient architecture. The fountains,\r\ngardens, walks, avenues, and groves, were all disposed with exact\r\njudgment and taste. I gave due praises to everything I saw, whereof his\r\nexcellency took not the least notice till after supper; when, there being\r\nno third companion, he told me with a melancholy air, that he doubted\r\nhe must throw down his houses in town and country, to rebuild them\r\nafter the present mode, destroy all his plantations, and cast others in\r\nsuch a form as modern usage required, and give the same directions to\r\nall his tenants, unless he would submit to incur the censure of pride,\r\nsingularity, affectation, ignorance, caprice, and perhaps increase his\r\nmajesty’s displeasure.\r\n\r\nThat the admiration I appeared to be under would cease or diminish when\r\nhe had informed me of some particulars which probably I never heard\r\nof at court, the people there being too much taken up in their own\r\nspeculations, to have regard to what passed here below.\r\n\r\nThe sum of his discourse was to this effect: That about forty years ago,\r\ncertain persons went up to Laputa, either upon business or diversion,\r\nand after five months’ continuance, came back with a very little\r\nsmattering in mathematics, but full of volatile spirits acquired in that\r\nairy region. That these persons upon their return began to dislike\r\nthe management of everything below, and fell into schemes of putting\r\nall arts, sciences, languages, and mechanics upon a new foot. To this\r\nend they procured a royal patent for erecting an academy of projectors\r\nin Lagado; and the humor prevailed so strongly among the people, that\r\nthere is not a town of any consequence in the kingdom without such an\r\nacademy. In these colleges the professors contrive new rules and methods\r\nof agriculture and building, and new instruments and tools for all trades\r\nand manufactures; whereby, as they undertake, one man shall do the work\r\nof ten; a palace may be built in a week, of materials so durable as to\r\nlast forever without repairing; all the fruits of the earth shall come\r\nto maturity at whatever season we think fit to choose, and increase a\r\nhundredfold more than they do at present, with innumerable other happy\r\nproposals. The only inconvenience is, that none of these projects are\r\nyet brought to perfection; and in the meantime, the whole country lies\r\nmiserably waste, the houses in ruins, and the people without food or\r\nclothes. By all which, instead of being discouraged, they are fifty times\r\nmore violently bent upon prosecuting their schemes, driven equally on\r\nby hope and despair; that as for himself, being not of an enterprising\r\nspirit, he was content to go on in the old forms, to live in the houses\r\nhis ancestors had built, and act as they did in every part of life\r\nwithout innovation; that some few other persons of quality and gentry had\r\ndone the same, but were looked on with an eye of contempt and ill will,\r\nas enemies to art, ignorant, and ill commonwealthsmen, preferring their\r\nown ease and sloth before the general improvement of their country.\r\n\r\nHis lordship added that he would not by any further particulars prevent\r\nthe pleasure I should certainly take in viewing the grand academy,\r\nwhither he was resolved I should go. He only desired me to observe a\r\nruined building upon the side of a mountain about three miles distant,\r\nof which he gave me this account. That he had a very convenient mill\r\nwithin half a mile of his house, turned by a current from a large river,\r\nand sufficient for his own family as well as a great number of his\r\ntenants; that about seven years ago a club of these projectors came to\r\nhim with proposals to destroy this mill, and build another on the side\r\nof that mountain, on the long ridge whereof a long canal must be cut for\r\na repository of water, to be conveyed up by pipes and engines to supply\r\nthe mill; because the wind and air upon a height agitated the water, and\r\nthereby made it fitter for motion; and because the water, descending a\r\ndeclivity, would turn the mill with half the current of a river whose\r\ncourse is more upon a level. He said that being then not very well with\r\nthe court, and pressed by many of his friends, he complied with the\r\nproposal; and after employing a hundred men for two years, the work\r\nmiscarried, the projectors went off, laying the blame entirely upon him,\r\nrailing at him ever since, and putting others upon the same experiment,\r\nwith equal assurance of success, as well as equal disappointment.\r\n\r\nIn a few days we came back to town; and his excellency, considering the\r\nbad character he had in the academy, would not go with me himself, but\r\nrecommended me to a friend of his to bear me company thither. My lord was\r\npleased to represent me as a great admirer of projects, and a person of\r\nmuch curiosity and easy belief; which indeed was not without truth, for I\r\nhad myself been a sort of projector in my younger days.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n    THE AUTHOR PERMITTED TO SEE THE GRAND ACADEMY OF LAGADO—THE\r\n    ACADEMY LARGELY DESCRIBED—THE ARTS WHEREIN THE PROFESSORS\r\n    EMPLOY THEMSELVES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis academy is not an entire single building, but a continuation of\r\nseveral houses on both sides of a street which, growing waste, was\r\npurchased and applied to that use.\r\n\r\nI was received very kindly by the warden, and went for many days to the\r\nacademy. Every room has in it one or more projectors; and I believe I\r\ncould not be in fewer than five hundred rooms.\r\n\r\nThe first man I saw was of a meager aspect, with sooty hands and face,\r\nhis hair and beard long, ragged, and singed in several places. His\r\nclothes, shirt, and skin were all of the same color. He had been eight\r\nyears upon a project for extracting sunbeams out of cucumbers, which were\r\nto be put into phials hermetically sealed, and let out to warm the air in\r\nraw inclement summers. He told me, he did not doubt in eight years more\r\nhe should be able to supply the governor’s gardens with sunshine at a\r\nreasonable rate; but he complained that his stock was low, and entreated\r\nme to give him something as an encouragement to ingenuity, especially\r\nsince this had been a very dear season for cucumbers. I made him a small\r\npresent, for my lord had furnished me with money on purpose, because he\r\nknew their practice of begging from all who go to see them.\r\n\r\nI saw one at work to calcine ice into gunpowder, who likewise showed me\r\na treatise he had written concerning the malleability of fire, which he\r\nintended to publish.\r\n\r\nThere was a most ingenious architect who had contrived a new method for\r\nbuilding houses, by beginning at the roof and working downwards to the\r\nfoundation; which he justified to me by the like practice of those two\r\nprudent insects the bee and the spider.\r\n\r\nThere was a man born blind, who had several apprentices in his own\r\ncondition; their employment was to mix colors for painters, which their\r\nmaster taught them to distinguish by feeling and smelling. It was indeed\r\nmy misfortune to find them at that time not very perfect in their\r\nlessons, and the professor himself happened to be generally mistaken.\r\nThis artist is much encouraged and esteemed by the whole fraternity.\r\n\r\nIn another apartment, I was highly pleased with a projector who had\r\nfound a device of ploughing the ground with hogs, to save the charges\r\nof ploughs, cattle, and labor. The method is this: In an acre of ground\r\nyou bury at six inches’ distance, and eight deep, a quantity of acorns,\r\ndates, chestnuts, and other mast or vegetables whereof these animals are\r\nfondest; then you drive six hundred or more of them into the field, where\r\nin a few days they will root up the whole ground in search of their food,\r\nand make it fit for sowing, at the same time manuring it with their dung;\r\nit is true upon experiment they found the charge and trouble very great,\r\nand they had little or no crop. However, it is not doubted that this\r\ninvention may be capable of great improvement.\r\n\r\nI went into another room, where the walls and ceiling were all hung round\r\nwith cobwebs, except a narrow passage for the artist to go in and out. At\r\nmy entrance, he called aloud to me not to disturb his webs. He lamented\r\nthe fatal mistake the world had been so long in of using silkworms,\r\nwhile he had such plenty of domestic insects who infinitely excelled the\r\nformer, because they understood how to weave as well as spin. And he\r\nproposed further, that by employing spiders, the charge of dyeing silks\r\nshould be wholly saved; whereof I was fully convinced when he showed me\r\na vast number of flies most beautifully colored, wherewith he fed his\r\nspiders, assuring us that the webs would take a tincture from them; and\r\nas he had them of all hues, he hoped to fit everybody’s fancy, as soon as\r\nhe could find proper food for the flies, of certain gums, oils, and other\r\nglutinous matter, to give a strength and consistence to the threads.\r\n\r\nThere was an astronomer who had undertaken to place a sundial upon the\r\ngreat weathercock on the townhouse, by adjusting the annual and diurnal\r\nmotions of the earth and sun, so as to answer and coincide with all\r\naccidental turnings by the wind.\r\n\r\nI visited many other apartments, but shall not trouble my reader with all\r\nthe curiosities I observed, being studious of brevity.\r\n\r\nI had hitherto seen only one side of the academy, the other being\r\nappropriated to the advancers of speculative learning, of whom I shall\r\nsay something when I have mentioned one illustrious person more, who is\r\ncalled among them “the universal artist.” He told us he had been thirty\r\nyears employing his thoughts for the improvement of human life. He had\r\ntwo large rooms full of wonderful curiosities, and fifty men at work.\r\nSome were condensing air into a dry tangible substance, by extracting\r\nthe niter, and letting the aqueous or fluid particles percolate; others\r\nsoftening marble for pillows and pincushions; others petrifying the hoofs\r\nof a living horse to preserve them from foundering. The artist himself\r\nwas at that time busy upon two great designs; the first to sow land with\r\nchaff, wherein he affirmed the true seminal virtue to be contained, as he\r\ndemonstrated by several experiments which I was not skillful enough to\r\ncomprehend. The other was, by a certain composition of gums, minerals,\r\nand vegetables, outwardly applied, to prevent the growth of wool upon two\r\nyoung lambs; and he hoped in a reasonable time to propagate the breed of\r\nnaked sheep all over the kingdom.\r\n\r\nWe crossed a walk to the other part of the academy, where, as I have\r\nalready said, the projector in speculative learning resided.\r\n\r\nThe first professor I saw was in a very large room, with forty pupils\r\nabout him. After salutation, observing me to look earnestly upon a frame,\r\nwhich took up the greatest part of both the length and breadth of the\r\nroom, he said perhaps I might wonder to see him employed in a project for\r\nimproving speculative knowledge by practical and mechanical operations.\r\nBut the world would soon be sensible of its usefulness, and he flattered\r\nhimself that a more noble exalted thought never sprang in any other man’s\r\nhead. Every one knew how laborious the usual method is of attaining to\r\narts and sciences; whereas by his contrivance the most ignorant person,\r\nat a reasonable charge, and with a little bodily labor, may write books\r\nin philosophy, poetry, politics, law, mathematics, and theology, without\r\nthe least assistance from genius or study. He then led me to the frame,\r\nabout the sides whereof all his pupils stood in ranks. It was twenty feet\r\nsquare, placed in the middle of the room. The superficies was composed of\r\nseveral bits of wood, about the bigness of a die, but some larger than\r\nothers. They were all linked together by slender wires. These bits of\r\nwood were covered on every square with paper pasted on them; and on these\r\npapers were written all the words of their language in their several\r\nmoods, tenses, and declensions, but without any order. The professor then\r\ndesired me to observe, for he was going to set his engine at work. The\r\npupils, at his command, took each of them hold of an iron handle, whereof\r\nthere were forty fixed round the edges of the frame, and giving them a\r\nsudden turn, the whole disposition of the words was entirely changed.\r\nHe then commanded six-and-thirty of the lads to read the several lines\r\nsoftly as they appeared upon the frame; and where they found three or\r\nfour words together that might make part of a sentence, they dictated to\r\nthe four remaining boys, who were scribes. This work was repeated three\r\nor four times; and at every turn the engine was so contrived, that the\r\nwords shifted into new places, as the square bits of wood moved upside\r\ndown.\r\n\r\nSix hours a day the young students were employed in this labor; and the\r\nprofessor showed me several volumes in large folio, already collected,\r\nof broken sentences, which he intended to piece together, and out of\r\nthose rich materials to give the world a complete body of all arts and\r\nsciences; which, however, might be still improved, and much expedited, if\r\nthe public would raise a fund for making and employing five hundred such\r\nframes in Lagado, and oblige the managers to contribute in common their\r\nseveral collections.\r\n\r\nHe assured me that this invention had employed all his thoughts from his\r\nyouth; that he had employed the whole vocabulary into his frame, and\r\nmade the strictest computation of the general proportion there is in\r\nbooks between the numbers of particles, nouns, and verbs, and other parts\r\nof speech.\r\n\r\nI made my humblest acknowledgment to this illustrious person for his\r\ngreat communicativeness, and promised if ever I had the good fortune to\r\nreturn to my native country, that I would do him justice, as the sole\r\ninventor of this wonderful machine, the form and contrivance of which I\r\ndesired leave to delineate upon paper. I told him, although it were the\r\ncustom of our learned in Europe to steal inventions from each other, who\r\nhad thereby at least this advantage, that it became a controversy which\r\nwas the right owner yet I would take such caution, that he should have\r\nthe honor entire, without a rival.\r\n\r\nWe next went to the school of language, where three professors sat in\r\nconsultation upon improving that of their own country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “_He had been eight years upon a project for extracting\r\nsunbeams out of cucumbers_”\r\n\r\n_Page 201_]\r\n\r\nThe first project was to shorten discourse by cutting polysyllables into\r\none, and leaving out verbs and participles; because in reality all things\r\nimaginable are but nouns.\r\n\r\nThe other was a scheme for entirely abolishing all words whatsoever;\r\nand this was urged as a great advantage in point of health as well as\r\nbrevity. For it is plain, that every word we speak is in some degree a\r\ndiminution of our lungs by corrosion, and consequently contributes to\r\nthe shortening of our lives. An expedient was therefore offered, that\r\nsince words are only names for things, it would be more convenient for\r\nall men to carry about them such things as were necessary to express the\r\nparticular business they are to discourse on. And this invention would\r\ncertainly have taken place, to the great ease as well as health of the\r\nsubject, if the women, in conjunction with the vulgar and illiterate,\r\nhad not threatened to raise a rebellion unless they might be allowed the\r\nliberty to speak with their tongues, after the manner of their ancestors;\r\nsuch constant irreconcilable enemies to science are the common people.\r\nHowever, many of the most learned and wise adhere to the new scheme\r\nof expressing themselves by things; which has only this inconvenience\r\nattending it, that if a man’s business be very great, and of various\r\nkinds, he must be obliged in proportion to carry a greater bundle of\r\nthings upon his back, unless he can afford one or two strong servants\r\nto attend him. I have often beheld two of those sages almost sinking\r\nunder the weight of their packs, like peddlers among us; who when they\r\nmet in the street would lay down their loads, open their sacks, and hold\r\nconversation for an hour together; then put up their implements, help\r\neach other to resume their burdens, and take their leave.\r\n\r\nBut for short conversations a man may carry implements in his pockets and\r\nunder his arms, enough to supply him; and in his house he cannot be at\r\na loss. Therefore the room where company meet who practice this art, is\r\nfull of all things, ready at hand, requisite to furnish matter for this\r\nkind of artificial converse.\r\n\r\nAnother great advantage proposed by this invention was, that it would\r\nserve as a universal language, to be understood in all civilized\r\nnations, whose goods and utensils are generally of the same kind, or\r\nnearly resembling, so that their uses might easily be comprehended. And\r\nthus ambassadors would be qualified to treat with foreign princes, or\r\nministers of state, to whose tongues they were utter strangers.\r\n\r\nI was at the mathematical school, where the master taught his pupils\r\nafter a method scarce imaginable to us in Europe. The proposition and\r\ndemonstration were fairly written on a thin wafer, with ink composed\r\nof cephalic tincture. This the student was to swallow upon a fasting\r\nstomach, and for three days following eat nothing but bread and water.\r\nAs the wafer digested, the tincture mounted to his brain, bearing\r\nthe proposition along with it. But the success has not hitherto been\r\nanswerable, partly by some error in the _quantum_ or composition, and\r\npartly by the perverseness of lads, to whom this bolus is so nauseous\r\nthat they generally steal aside and discharge it upwards before it\r\ncan operate; neither have they been yet persuaded to use so long an\r\nabstinence as the prescription requires.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n    A FURTHER ACCOUNT OF THE ACADEMY—THE AUTHOR PROPOSES SOME\r\n    IMPROVEMENTS, WHICH ARE HONORABLY RECEIVED.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the school of political projectors I was but ill entertained, the\r\nprofessors appearing to me wholly out of their senses, which is a scene\r\nthat never fails to make me melancholy. These unhappy people were\r\nproposing schemes for persuading monarchs to choose favorites upon the\r\nscore of their wisdom, capacity, and virtue; of teaching ministers to\r\nconsult the public good; of rewarding merit, great abilities, and eminent\r\nservices; of instructing princes to know their true interest by placing\r\nit on the same foundation with that of their people; of choosing for\r\nemployments persons qualified to exercise them; with many other wild,\r\nimpossible chimeras, that never entered before into the heart of man\r\nto conceive, and confirmed in me the old observation, that “there is\r\nnothing so extravagant and irrational, which some philosophers have not\r\nmaintained for truth.”\r\n\r\nBut, however, I shall so far do justice to this part of the academy, as\r\nto acknowledge that all of them were not so visionary. There was a most\r\ningenious doctor who seemed to be perfectly versed in the whole nature\r\nand system of government. This illustrious person had very usefully\r\nemployed his studies in finding out effectual remedies for all diseases\r\nand corruptions to which the several kinds of public administration are\r\nsubject, by the vices or infirmities of those who govern, as well as\r\nby the licentiousness of those who are to obey. For instance, whereas\r\nall writers and reasoners have agreed that there is a strict universal\r\nresemblance between the natural and the political body, can there be\r\nanything more evident, than that the health of both must be preserved,\r\nand the diseases cured by the same prescription? It is allowed, that\r\nsenates and great councils are often troubled with redundant, ebullient,\r\nand other peccant humors; with many diseases of the head, and more of\r\nthe heart; with strong convulsions, with grievous contractions of the\r\nnerves and sinews in both hands, but especially the right; with spleen,\r\nflatus, vertigoes, and deliriums; with scrofulous tumors, full of fetid\r\npurulent matter; with sour, frothy eructations; with canine appetites\r\nand crudeness of digestion, besides many others, needless to mention.\r\nThis doctor therefore proposed that upon the meeting of a senate, certain\r\nphysicians should attend at the three first days of their sitting, and at\r\nthe close of each day’s debate feel the pulses of every senator; after\r\nwhich, having maturely considered and consulted upon the nature of the\r\nseveral maladies, and the methods of cure, they should on the fourth\r\nday return to the senate house, attended by their apothecaries, stored\r\nwith proper, medicines, and before the members sat, administer to each\r\nof them lenitives, aperitives, abstersives, corrosives, restringents,\r\npalliatives, laxatives, cephalalgics, icterics, apophlegmatics, acoustics,\r\nas their several cases required, and according as these medicines should\r\noperate, repeat, alter, or omit them at the next meeting.\r\n\r\nThis project could not be of any great expense to the public, and would\r\nin my poor opinion be of much use for the dispatch of business, in those\r\ncountries where senates have any share in the legislative power, beget\r\nunanimity, shorten debates, open a few mouths which are now closed, and\r\nclose many more which are now open; curb the petulancy of the young, and\r\ncorrect the positiveness of the old; rouse the stupid, and damp the pert.\r\n\r\nAgain, because it is a general complaint that the favorites of princes\r\nare troubled with short and weak memories, the same doctor proposed that\r\nwhoever attended a first minister, after having told his business with\r\nthe utmost brevity and in the plainest words, should at his departure\r\ngive the said minister a tweak by the nose, or a kick in the belly, or\r\ntread on his corns, or lug him thrice by both ears, or run a pin into his\r\nbreech, or pinch his arm black and blue, to prevent forgetfulness; and at\r\nevery levee day repeat the same operation, till the business were done or\r\nabsolutely refused.\r\n\r\nHe likewise directed that every senator in the great council of a nation,\r\nafter he had delivered his opinion and argued in the defense of it,\r\nshould be obliged to give his vote directly contrary; because if that\r\nwere done, the result would infallibly terminate in the good of the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nWhen parties in a state are violent, he offered a wonderful contrivance\r\nto reconcile them. The method is this: You take a hundred leaders of each\r\nparty; you dispose them into couples of such whose heads are nearest of a\r\nsize; then let two nice operators saw off the occiput of each couple at\r\nthe same time, in such a manner that the brain may be equally divided.\r\nLet the occiputs thus cut off be interchanged, applying each to the head\r\nof his opposite party man. It seems indeed to be a work that requires\r\nsome exactness, but the professor assured us that if it were dexterously\r\nperformed, the cure would be infallible. For he argued thus: that the two\r\nhalf brains being left to debate the matter between themselves within\r\nthe space of one skull, would soon come to a good understanding, and\r\nproduce that moderation, as well as regularity of thinking, so much to\r\nbe wished for in the heads of those who imagine they come into the world\r\nonly to watch and govern its motion; and as to the difference of brains,\r\nin quantity or quality, among those who are directors in faction, the\r\ndoctor assured us, from his own knowledge, that it was a perfect trifle.\r\n\r\nI heard a very warm debate between two professors, about the most\r\ncommodious and effectual ways and means of raising money without grieving\r\nthe subject. The first affirmed, the justest method would be to lay a\r\ncertain tax upon vices and folly, and the sum fixed upon every man to be\r\nrated after the fairest manner by a jury of his neighbors. The second\r\nwas of an opinion directly contrary: to tax those qualities of body and\r\nmind for which men chiefly value themselves, the rate to be more or less\r\naccording to the degrees of excelling, the decision whereof should be\r\nleft entirely to their own breast. The highest tax was upon men who are\r\nthe greatest favorites of the other sex, and the assessments according\r\nto the number and natures of the favors they have received; for which\r\nthey are allowed to be their own vouchers. Wit, valor, and politeness\r\nwere likewise proposed to be largely taxed, and collected in the same\r\nmanner, by every person’s giving his own word for the quantum of what he\r\npossessed. But as to honor, justice, wisdom, and learning, they should\r\nnot be taxed at all, because they are qualifications of so singular a\r\nkind, that no man will either allow them in his neighbor or value them in\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nThe women were proposed to be taxed according to their beauty and skill\r\nin dressing, wherein they had the same privilege with the men, to be\r\ndetermined by their own judgment. But constancy, chastity, good sense,\r\nand good nature, were not rated, because they would not bear the charge\r\nof collecting.\r\n\r\nTo keep senators in the interest of the crown, it was proposed that the\r\nmembers shall raffle for employments, every man first taking an oath, and\r\ngiving security that he would vote for the court, whether he won or no,\r\nafter which the losers had in their turn the liberty of raffling upon the\r\nnext vacancy. Thus hope and expectation would be kept alive; none would\r\ncomplain of broken promises, but impute their disappointments wholly\r\nto fortune, whose shoulders are broader and stronger than those of a\r\nministry.\r\n\r\nThe whole discourse was written with great acuteness, containing many\r\nobservations both curious and useful for politicians, but as I conceived\r\nnot altogether complete. This I ventured to tell the author, and\r\noffered if he pleased to supply him with some additions. He received my\r\nproposition with more compliance than is usual among writers, especially\r\nthose of the projecting species, professing he would be glad to receive\r\nfurther information.\r\n\r\nI told him that were I to live in a kingdom where the bulk of the people\r\nindulged in plots and conspiracies, I would take care to encourage the\r\nbreed of discoverers, witnesses, informers, accusers, prosecutors,\r\nevidences, swearers, together with their several subservient and\r\nsubaltern instruments, placing them all under the pay and the protection\r\nof ministers of state or other powerful persons who desire to raise their\r\nown characters as profound politicians. Men thus qualified and empowered\r\nmight restore new vigor to a crazy administration; stifle or divert\r\ngeneral discontents; fill their pockets with forfeitures, and advance\r\nor sink the opinion of public credit, as either shall best answer their\r\nprivate advantage. This might be done by first agreeing and settling\r\namong themselves what suspected persons shall be accused of a plot; then,\r\neffectual care being taken to secure all their letters and papers, and\r\nthe criminal placed in secure custody, these papers might be delivered\r\nto a set of artists sufficiently dexterous to find out the mysterious\r\nmeanings of words, syllables, and letters. They should be allowed to\r\nplace what interpretation they please upon them, even if it is contrary\r\nto their true intent and meaning; for instance, they may, if they so\r\nfancy, interpret a sieve to signify a court lady; a lame dog, an invader;\r\nthe plague, a standing army; a buzzard, a great statesman; the gout,\r\na high priest; a broom, a revolution; a mouse-trap, an employment; a\r\nbottomless pit, a treasury; a sink, a court; a cap and bells, a favorite;\r\na broken reed, a court of justice; an empty tun, a general; a running\r\nsore, an administration.\r\n\r\nBut should this method fail, recourse might be had to others more\r\neffectual, which learned men call acrostics and anagrams. First, might\r\nbe found men of skill and penetration who can discern that all initial\r\nletters have political meanings. Thus N shall signify a plot, B a\r\nregiment of horse, L a fleet at sea. Or, secondly, by transposing the\r\nletters of the alphabet in any suspected paper, they can discover the\r\ndeepest designs of a discontented party. So, for example, if I should\r\nsay in a letter to a friend: “Our brother Tom has just got the measles,”\r\na man of skill in this art would discover that the same letters which\r\ncompose that sentence might be analyzed into the following words:\r\nResist.—A Plot is brought home.—The Tower. And this is the anagrammatic\r\nmethod.\r\n\r\nThe professor made me great acknowledgments for communicating these\r\nobservations, and promised to make honorable mention of me in his\r\ntreatise.\r\n\r\nI saw nothing in this country that could invite me to a longer\r\ncontinuance, and began to think of returning home to England.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n    THE AUTHOR LEAVES LAGADO—ARRIVES AT MALDONADA—NO SHIP READY—HE\r\n    TAKES A SHORT VOYAGE TO GLUBBDUBDRIB—HIS RECEPTION BY THE\r\n    GOVERNOR.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe continent, of which this kingdom is a part, extends itself, as I have\r\nreason to believe, eastward to that unknown tract of America, westward of\r\nCalifornia, and north to the Pacific Ocean, which is not above a hundred\r\nand fifty miles from Lagado, where there is a good port and much commerce\r\nwith the great island of Luggnagg, situated to the northwest about 29\r\ndegrees north latitude, and 140 longitude. This island of Luggnagg stands\r\nsoutheastward of Japan, about a hundred leagues distant. There is a\r\nstrict alliance between the Japanese emperor and the king of Luggnagg,\r\nwhich affords frequent opportunities of sailing from one island to the\r\nother. I determined therefore to direct my course this way, in order to\r\nmy return to Europe. I hired two mules, with a guide to show me the way,\r\nand carry my small baggage. I took leave of my noble protector, who had\r\nshown me so much favor, and made me a generous present at my departure.\r\n\r\nMy journey was without any accident or adventure worth relating. When I\r\narrived at the port of Maldonada (for so it is called) there was no ship\r\nin the harbor bound for Luggnagg, nor like to be in some time. The town\r\nis about as large as Portsmouth. I soon fell into some acquaintance,\r\nand was very hospitably received. A gentleman of distinction said to\r\nme, that since the ships bound for Luggnagg could not be ready in less\r\nthan a month, it might be no disagreeable amusement for me to take a\r\ntrip to the little island of Glubbdubdrib, about five leagues off to the\r\nsouthwest. He offered himself and a friend to accompany me, and that I\r\nshould be provided with a small convenient bark for the voyage.\r\n\r\nGlubbdubdrib, as nearly as I can interpret the word, signifies the Island\r\nof Sorcerers or Magicians. It is about one-third as large as the Isle of\r\nWight, and extremely fruitful; it is governed by the head of a certain\r\ntribe, who are all magicians. This tribe marries only among each other,\r\nand the eldest in succession is prince or governor. He has a noble\r\npalace, and a park of about three thousand acres, surrounded by a wall of\r\nhewn stone twenty feet high. In this park are several small enclosures\r\nfor cattle, corn, and gardening.\r\n\r\nThe governor and his family are served and attended by domestics of a\r\nkind somewhat unusual. By his skill in necromancy, he has a power of\r\ncalling whom he pleases from the dead, and commanding their service for\r\ntwenty-four hours, but no longer; nor can he call the same persons up\r\nagain in less than three months, except upon very extraordinary occasions.\r\n\r\nWhen we arrived at the island, which was about eleven in the morning,\r\none of the gentlemen who accompanied me went to the governor and desired\r\nadmittance for a stranger, who came on purpose to have the honor of\r\nattending on his highness. This was immediately granted, and we all three\r\nentered the gate of the palace between two rows of guards, armed and\r\ndressed after a very antic manner, and something in their countenances\r\nthat made my flesh creep with a horror I cannot express. We passed\r\nthrough several apartments, between servants of the same sort, ranked\r\non each side as before, till we came to the chamber of presence,\r\nwhere after three profound obeisances and a few general questions,\r\nwe were permitted to sit on three stools near the lowest step of his\r\nhighness’s throne. He understood the language of Balnibarbi, although\r\nit were different from that of this island. He desired me to give him\r\nsome account of my travels; and to let me see that I should be treated\r\nwithout ceremony, he dismissed all his attendants with a turn of his\r\nfinger; at which, to my great astonishment, they vanished in an instant,\r\nlike visions in a dream when we awake on a sudden. I could not recover\r\nmyself in some time, till the governor assured me that I should receive\r\nno hurt; and observing my two companions to be under no concern, who had\r\nbeen often entertained in the same manner, I began to take courage, and\r\nrelated to his highness a short history of my several adventures, yet not\r\nwithout some hesitation, and frequently looking behind me to the place\r\nwhere I had seen those domestic specters. I had the honor to dine with\r\nthe governor, where a new set of ghosts served up the meat, and waited at\r\ntable. I now observed myself to be less terrified than I had been in the\r\nmorning. I stayed till sunset, but humbly desired his highness to excuse\r\nme for not accepting his invitation of lodging in the palace. My two\r\nfriends and I lay at a private house in the town adjoining, which is the\r\ncapital of this little island; and the next morning we returned to pay\r\nour duty to the governor, as he was pleased to command us.\r\n\r\nAfter this manner we continued in the island for ten days, most part of\r\nevery day with the governor, and at night in our lodging. I soon grew\r\nso familiarized to the sight of spirits, that after the third or fourth\r\ntime they gave me no emotion at all; or if I had any apprehensions left,\r\nmy curiosity prevailed over them. For his highness the governor ordered\r\nme to call up whatever persons I would choose to name, and in whatever\r\nnumbers, among all the dead from the beginning of the world to the\r\npresent time, and command them to answer any questions I should think fit\r\nto ask; with this condition, that my questions must be confined within\r\nthe compass of the times they lived in. And one thing I might depend\r\nupon, that they would certainly tell me truth, for lying was a talent of\r\nno use in the lower world.\r\n\r\nI made my humble acknowledgments to his highness for so great a favor.\r\nWe were in a chamber whence there was a fair prospect into the park. And\r\nbecause my first inclination was to be entertained with scenes of pomp\r\nand magnificence, I desired to see Alexander the Great at the head of\r\nhis army, just after the battle of Arbela; which, upon a motion of the\r\ngovernor’s finger, immediately appeared in a large field under the window\r\nwhere we stood. Alexander was called up into the room; it was with great\r\ndifficulty that I understood his Greek, and had but little of my own. He\r\nassured me upon his honor that he was not poisoned, but died of a fever,\r\nby excessive drinking.\r\n\r\nNext I saw Hannibal passing the Alps, who told me he had not a drop of\r\nvinegar in his camp.\r\n\r\nI saw Cæsar and Pompey at the head of their troops, just ready to engage.\r\nI saw the former in his last great triumph. I desired that the senate\r\nof Rome might appear before me in one large chamber, and an assembly of\r\nsomewhat a later age, in counterview, in another. The first seemed to\r\nbe an assembly of heroes and demigods; the other, a knot of peddlers,\r\npickpockets, highwaymen, and bullies.\r\n\r\nThe governor, at my request, gave the sign for Cæsar and Brutus to\r\nadvance towards us. I was struck with a profound veneration at the\r\nsight of Brutus, and could easily discover the most consummate virtue,\r\nthe greatest intrepidity and firmness of mind, the truest love of his\r\ncountry, and general benevolence for mankind, in every lineament of\r\nhis countenance. I observed with much pleasure, that these two persons\r\nwere in good intelligence with each other; and Cæsar freely confessed\r\nto me that the greatest actions of his own life were not equal by\r\nmany degrees to the glory of taking it away. I had the honor to have\r\nmuch conversation with Brutus; and was told that his ancestor Junius,\r\nSocrates, Epaminondas, Cato the Younger, Sir Thomas More, and himself,\r\nwere perpetually together; a sextumvirate to which all the ages of the\r\nworld cannot add a seventh.\r\n\r\nIt would be tedious to trouble the reader with relating what vast numbers\r\nof illustrious persons were called up, to gratify that insatiable desire\r\nI had to see the world in every period of antiquity placed before me.\r\nI chiefly fed mine eyes with beholding the destroyers of tyrants and\r\nusurpers, and the restorers of liberty to oppressed and injured nations.\r\nBut it is impossible to express the satisfaction I received in my own\r\nmind, after such a manner as to make it a suitable entertainment to the\r\nreader.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n    A FURTHER ACCOUNT OF GLUBBDUBDRIB—ANCIENT AND MODERN HISTORY\r\n    CORRECTED.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving a desire to see those ancients who were most renowned for wit\r\nand learning, I set apart one day on purpose. I proposed that Homer and\r\nAristotle might appear at the head of all their commentators; but these\r\nwere so numerous that some hundreds were forced to attend in the court\r\nand outward rooms of the palace. I knew and could distinguish those two\r\nheroes at first sight, not only from the crowd, but from each other.\r\nHomer was the taller and comelier person of the two, walked very erect\r\nfor one of his age, and his eyes were the most quick and piercing I ever\r\nbeheld. Aristotle stooped much, and made use of a staff. His visage was\r\nmeager, his hair lank and thin, and his voice hollow. I soon discovered\r\nthat both of them were perfect strangers to the rest of the company,\r\nand had never seen or heard of them before. And I had a whisper from a\r\nghost, who shall be nameless, that these commentators always kept in\r\nthe most distant quarters from their principals, in the lower world,\r\nthrough a consciousness of shame and guilt, because they had so horribly\r\nmisrepresented the meaning of those authors to posterity. I introduced\r\nDidymus and Eustathius to Homer, and prevailed on him to treat them\r\nbetter than perhaps they deserved, for he soon found they wanted a genius\r\nto enter into the spirit of a poet. But Aristotle was out of all patience\r\nwith the account I gave him of Scotus and Ramus, as I presented them to\r\nhim, and he asked them whether the rest of the tribe were as great dunces\r\nas themselves.\r\n\r\nI then desired the governor to call up Descartes and Gassendi, with whom\r\nI prevailed to explain their systems to Aristotle. This great philosopher\r\nfreely acknowledged his own mistakes in natural philosophy, because he\r\nproceeded in many things upon conjecture, as all men must do; and he\r\nfound that Gassendi, who had made the doctrine of Epicurus as palatable\r\nas he could, and the vortices of Descartes, were equally exploded. He\r\npredicted the same fate to attraction, whereof the present learned are\r\nsuch zealous assertors. He said that new systems of nature were but new\r\nfashions which would vary in every age; and even those who pretend to\r\ndemonstrate them from mathematical principles, would flourish but a short\r\nperiod of time, and be out of vogue when that was determined.\r\n\r\nI spent five days in conversing with many others of the ancient learned.\r\nI saw most of the first Roman emperors. I prevailed on the governor to\r\ncall up Eliogabulus’s cooks to dress us a dinner, but they could not\r\nshow us much of their skill, for want of materials. A helot of Agesilaus\r\nmade us a dish of Spartan broth, but I was not able to get down a second\r\nspoonful.\r\n\r\nThe two gentlemen who conducted me to the island were pressed by their\r\nprivate affairs to return in three days, which I employed in seeing some\r\nof the modern dead, who had made the greatest figure for two or three\r\nhundred years past, in our own and other countries of Europe; and having\r\nbeen always a great admirer of old illustrious families, I desired the\r\ngovernor would call up a dozen or two of kings, with their ancestors in\r\norder, for eight or nine generations. But my disappointment was grievous\r\nand unexpected. For, instead of a long train with royal diadems, I\r\nsaw in one family two fiddlers, three spruce courtiers, and an Italian\r\nprelate. In another, a barber, an abbot, and two cardinals. I have too\r\ngreat a veneration for crowned heads to dwell any longer on so nice a\r\nsubject. But as to counts, marquises, dukes, earls, and the like, I was\r\nnot so scrupulous. And I confess it was not without some pleasure that\r\nI found myself able to trace the particular features by which certain\r\nfamilies are distinguished, up to their originals. I could plainly\r\ndiscover from whence one family derives a long chin; why a second has\r\nabounded with knaves for two generations, and fools for two more; why a\r\nthird happened to be crack-brained, and a fourth to be sharpers; whence\r\nit came, what Polydore Virgil says of a certain great house, _Nec vir\r\nfortis; nec fæmina casta_; how cruelty, falsehood, and cowardice grew to\r\nbe characteristics by which certain families are distinguished as much\r\nas by their coat of arms. Neither could I wonder at all this, when I saw\r\nsuch an interruption of lineages, by pages, lackeys, valets, coachmen,\r\ngamesters, captains, and pickpockets.\r\n\r\nI was chiefly disgusted with modern history. For having strictly examined\r\nall the persons of greatest name in the courts of princes for a hundred\r\nyears past, I found how the world had been misled by prostitute writers,\r\nto ascribe the greatest exploits in war to cowards, the wisest counsel\r\nto fools, sincerity to flatterers, Roman virtue to betrayers of their\r\ncountry, piety to atheists, truth to informers; how many innocent and\r\nexcellent persons had been condemned to death or banishment by the\r\npracticing of great ministers upon the corruption of judges, and the\r\nmalice of factions; how many villains had been exalted to the highest\r\nplaces of trust, power, dignity, and profit; how great a share in the\r\nmotions and events of courts, councils, and senates might be challenged\r\nby pimps, parasites, and buffoons. How low an opinion I had of human\r\nwisdom and integrity when I was truly informed of the springs and\r\nmotives of great enterprises and revolutions in the world, and of the\r\ncontemptible accidents to which they owed their success!\r\n\r\nHere I discovered the roguery and ignorance of those who pretend to write\r\nanecdotes, or secret history; who send so many kings to their graves with\r\na cup of poison; will repeat the discourse between a prince and a chief\r\nminister, where no witness was by; unlock the thoughts and cabinets of\r\nambassadors and secretaries of state; and have the perpetual misfortune\r\nto be mistaken. Here I discovered the secret causes of many great events\r\nthat have surprised the world. A general confessed in my presence, that\r\nhe got a victory purely by the force of cowardice and ill conduct; and an\r\nadmiral, that for want of proper intelligence, he beat the enemy to whom\r\nhe intended to betray the fleet. Three kings protested to me, that in\r\ntheir whole reigns they did never once prefer any person of merit, unless\r\nby mistake or treachery of some minister in whom they confided; neither\r\nwould they do it if they were to live again; and they showed, with great\r\nstrength of reason, that the royal throne could not be supported without\r\ncorruption, because that positive, confident, restive temper which virtue\r\ninfused into man, was a perpetual clog to public business.\r\n\r\nI had the curiosity to inquire in a particular manner, by what method\r\ngreat numbers had procured to themselves high titles of honor, and\r\nprodigious estates; and I confined my inquiry to a very modern period;\r\nhowever, without grating upon present times because I would be sure to\r\ngive no offense even to foreigners; for I hope the reader need not be\r\ntold, that I do not in the least intend my own country in what I say upon\r\nthis occasion. A great number of persons concerned were called up, and\r\nupon a very slight examination, discovered such a scene of infamy, that\r\nI cannot reflect upon it without some seriousness. Perjury, oppression,\r\nsubornation, fraud, panderism, and the like infirmities, were among the\r\nmost excusable arts they had to mention; and for these I gave, as it was\r\nreasonable, great allowance. But when some confessed they owed their\r\ngreatness and wealth to vice; others to the betraying their country\r\nor their prince; some to poisoning, more to the perverting of justice\r\nin order to destroy the innocent, I hope I may be pardoned if these\r\ndiscoveries inclined me a little to abate of that profound veneration\r\nwhich I am naturally apt to pay to persons of high rank, who ought to be\r\ntreated with the utmost respect due to their sublime dignity, by us their\r\ninferiors.\r\n\r\nI had often read of some great services done to princes and states, and\r\ndesired to see the persons by whom those services were performed. Upon\r\ninquiry, I was told that their names were to be found on no record,\r\nexcept a few of them whom history has represented as the vilest rogues\r\nand traitors. As to the rest, I had never once heard of them. They all\r\nappeared with dejected looks, and in the meanest habit, most of them\r\ntelling me they died in poverty and disgrace, and the rest on a scaffold\r\nor a gibbet.\r\n\r\nAmong the rest there was one person whose case appeared a little\r\nsingular. He had a youth about eighteen years old standing by his side.\r\nHe told me he had for many years been commander of a ship, and in the\r\nsea fight at Actium had the good fortune to break through the enemies’\r\ngreat line of battle, sink three of their capital ships, and take a\r\nfourth, which was the sole cause of Antony’s flight, and of the victory\r\nthat insued; that the youth standing by him, his only son, was killed in\r\nthe action. He added that upon the confidence of some merit, this war\r\nbeing at an end, he went to Rome, and solicited at the court of Augustus\r\nto be preferred to a greater ship, whose commander had been killed;\r\nbut without any regard to his pretensions, it was given to a youth who\r\nhad never seen the sea, the son of Libertina, who waited on one of the\r\nemperor’s mistresses. Returning to his own vessel, he was charged with\r\nneglect of duty, and the ship given to a favorite page of Publicola, the\r\nvice-admiral; whereupon he retired to a poor farm at a great distance\r\nfrom Rome, and there ended his life. I was so curious to know the truth\r\nof this story, that I desired Agrippa might be called, who was admiral in\r\nthat fight. He appeared, and confirmed the whole account; but with much\r\nmore advantage to the captain, whose modesty had extenuated or concealed\r\na great part of his merit.\r\n\r\nI was surprised to find corruption grown so high and so quick in that\r\nempire, by the force of luxury so lately introduced; which made me less\r\nwonder at many parallel cases in other countries, where vices of all\r\nkinds have reigned so much longer, and where the whole praise as well as\r\npillage has been engrossed by the chief commander, who perhaps had the\r\nleast title to either.\r\n\r\nAs every person called up made exactly the same appearance he had done in\r\nthe world, it gave me melancholy reflections to observe how much the race\r\nof human kind was degenerate among us, within these hundred years past.\r\n\r\nI descended so low as to desire that some English yeomen of the old stamp\r\nmight be summoned to appear, once so famous for the simplicity of their\r\nmanners, diet, and dress; for justice in their dealings; for their true\r\nspirit of liberty; for their valor, and love of their country. Neither\r\ncould I be wholly unmoved after comparing the living with the dead, when\r\nI considered how all these pure native virtues were prostituted for a\r\npiece of money by their grandchildren, who, in selling their votes and\r\nmanaging at elections, have acquired every vice and corruption that can\r\npossibly be learned in a court.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n    THE AUTHOR’S RETURN TO MALDONADA—SAILS TO THE KINGDOM OF\r\n    LUGGNAGG—THE AUTHOR CONFINED—HE IS SENT FOR TO COURT—THE MANNER\r\n    OF HIS ADMITTANCE—THE KING’S GREAT LENITY TO HIS SUBJECTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day of our departure being come, I took leave of his highness\r\nthe governor of Glubbdubdrib, and returned with my two companions to\r\nMaldonada, where, after a fortnight’s waiting, a ship was ready to sail\r\nfor Luggnagg. The two gentlemen and some others were so generous and kind\r\nas to furnish me with provisions, and see me on board. I was a month\r\nin this voyage. We had one violent storm, and were under a necessity\r\nof steering westward to get into the trade wind, which holds for above\r\nsixty leagues. On the 21st of April, 1709, we sailed into the river of\r\nClumegnig, which is a seaport town, at the southeast point of Luggnagg.\r\nWe cast anchor within a league of the town, and made a signal for a\r\npilot. Two of them came on board in less than half an hour, by whom we\r\nwere guided between certain shoals and rocks which are very dangerous in\r\nthe passage to a large basin, where a fleet may ride in safety within a\r\ncable’s length of the town wall.\r\n\r\nSome of our sailors, whether out of treachery or inadvertence, had\r\ninformed the pilots that I was a stranger and a great traveler, whereof\r\nthese gave notice to a customhouse officer, by whom I was examined very\r\nstrictly upon my landing. This officer spoke to me in the language of\r\nBalnibarbi, which by the force of much commerce is generally understood\r\nin that town, especially by seamen and those employed in the customs.\r\nI gave him a short account of some particulars, and made my story as\r\nplausible and consistent as I could; but I thought it necessary to\r\ndisguise my country, and call myself a Hollander, because my intentions\r\nwere for Japan, and I knew the Dutch were the only Europeans permitted\r\nto enter into that kingdom. I therefore told the officer that having\r\nbeen shipwrecked on the coast of Balnibarbi, and cast on a rock, I was\r\nreceived up into Laputa, or the flying island (of which he had often\r\nheard), and was now endeavoring to get to Japan, whence I might find a\r\nconvenience of returning to my own country. The officer said I must be\r\nconfined till he could receive orders from court, for which he would\r\nwrite immediately, and hoped to receive an answer in a fortnight. I\r\nwas carried to a convenient lodging, with a sentry placed at the door;\r\nhowever I had the liberty of a large garden, and was treated with\r\nhumanity enough, being maintained all the time at the king’s charge. I\r\nwas visited by several persons, chiefly out of curiosity, because it was\r\nreported that I came from countries very remote, of which they had never\r\nheard.\r\n\r\nI hired a young man who came in the same ship to be an interpreter; he\r\nwas a native of Luggnagg, but had lived some years at Maldonada, and was\r\na perfect master of both languages. By his assistance I was able to hold\r\na conversation with those who came to visit me; but this consisted only\r\nof their questions and my answers.\r\n\r\nThe dispatch came from court about the time we expected. It contained a\r\nwarrant for conducting me and my retinue to Traldragdubh, or Trildrogdrib\r\n(for it is pronounced both ways as near as I can remember), by a party\r\nof ten horse. All my retinue was that poor lad for an interpreter, whom\r\nI persuaded into my service, and at my humble request, we had each of\r\nus a mule to ride on. A messenger was dispatched half a day’s journey\r\nbefore us, to give the king notice of my approach; and to desire that\r\nhis majesty would please to appoint a day and hour, when it would be his\r\ngracious pleasure that I might have the honor to lick the dust before\r\nhis footstool. This is the court style, and I found it to be more than\r\nmatter of form: for, upon my admittance two days after my arrival, I\r\nwas commanded to crawl on my belly, and lick the floor as I advanced;\r\nbut on account of my being a stranger, care was taken to have it swept\r\nso clean that the dust was not offensive. However, this was a peculiar\r\ngrace, not allowed to any but persons of the highest rank, when they\r\ndesire an admittance. Nay, sometimes the floor is strewed with dust\r\non purpose, when the person to be admitted happens to have powerful\r\nenemies at court; and I have seen a great lord with his mouth so crammed,\r\nthat when he had crept to the proper distance from the throne, he was\r\nnot able to speak a word. Neither is there any remedy, because it is\r\ncapital for those who receive an audience to spit or wipe their mouths\r\nin his majesty’s presence. There is indeed another custom which I cannot\r\naltogether approve of: When the king has a mind to put any of his nobles\r\nto death in a gentle indulgent manner, he commands to have the floor\r\nstrewn with a certain brown powder of a deadly composition, which, being\r\nlicked up, infallibly kills him in twenty-four hours. But in justice to\r\nthis prince’s great clemency, and the care he has of his subjects’ lives\r\n(wherein it were much to be wished that the monarchs of Europe would\r\nimitate him), it must be mentioned for his honor, that strict orders are\r\ngiven to have the infected parts of the floor well washed after every\r\nsuch execution, which if his domestics neglect, they are in danger of\r\nincurring his royal displeasure. I myself heard him give directions that\r\none of his pages should be whipped, whose turn it was to give notice\r\nabout washing the floor after an execution, but maliciously had omitted\r\nit, by which neglect a young lord of great hopes, coming to an audience,\r\nwas unfortunately poisoned, although the king at that time had no design\r\nagainst his life. But this good prince was so gracious as to forgive the\r\npoor page his whipping, upon promise that he would do so no more, without\r\nspecial orders.\r\n\r\nTo return from this digression: When I had crept within four yards of\r\nthe throne, I raised myself gently upon my knees, and then striking my\r\nforehead seven times on the ground, I pronounced the following words, as\r\nthey had been taught me the night before: _Ickpling gloffthrobb spuut\r\nserumm blhiop mlashnalt zwin tnodbalkuffh slhiophad gurdlubh asht._ This\r\nis the compliment established by the laws of the land for all persons\r\nadmitted to the king’s presence. It may be rendered into English thus:\r\n“May your celestial majesty outlive the sun, eleven moons and a half!”\r\nTo this the king returned some answer, which although I could not\r\nunderstand, yet I replied as I had been directed: _Fluft drin yalerick\r\ndwuldom prastrad mirpush_, which properly signifies, “My tongue is in\r\nthe mouth of my friend”; and by this expression was meant that I desired\r\nleave to bring my interpreter; whereupon the young man already mentioned\r\nwas accordingly introduced, by whose intervention I answered as many\r\nquestions as his majesty could put in above an hour. I spoke in the\r\nBalnibarbian tongue, and my interpreter delivered my meaning in that of\r\nLuggnagg.\r\n\r\nThe king was much delighted with my company, and ordered his\r\n_bliffmarklub_, or high-chamberlain, to appoint a lodging in the court\r\nfor me and my interpreter, with a daily allowance for my table, and a\r\nlarge purse of gold for my common expenses.\r\n\r\nI stayed three months in this country out of perfect obedience to his\r\nmajesty, who was pleased highly to favor me, and made me very honorable\r\noffers. But I thought it more consistent with prudence and justice to\r\npass the remainder of my days with my wife and family.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n    THE LUGGNAGGIANS COMMENDED—A PARTICULAR DESCRIPTION OF THE\r\n    STRULDBRUGS, WITH MANY CONVERSATIONS BETWEEN THE AUTHOR AND\r\n    SOME EMINENT PERSONS UPON THAT SUBJECT.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Luggnaggians are a polite and generous people, and although they are\r\nnot without some share of that pride which is peculiar to all Eastern\r\ncountries, yet they show themselves courteous to strangers, especially\r\nsuch who are countenanced by the court. I had many acquaintances among\r\npersons of the best fashion, and being always attended by my interpreter,\r\nthe conversation we had was not disagreeable.\r\n\r\nOne day in much good company I was asked by a person of quality whether\r\nI had seen any of their _struldbrugs_, or immortals. I said I had not,\r\nand desired he would explain to me what he meant by such an appellation\r\napplied to a mortal creature. He told me that sometimes, though very\r\nrarely, a child happened to be born in a family with a red circular\r\nspot in the forehead, directly over the left eyebrow, which was an\r\ninfallible mark that it should never die. The spot, as he described\r\nit, was about the compass of a silver threepence, but in the course of\r\ntime grew larger, and changed its color; for at twelve years old it\r\nbecame green, so continued till five-and-twenty, then turned to a deep\r\nblue; at five-and-forty it grew coal-black, and as large as an English\r\nshilling, but never admitted any farther alteration. He said these\r\nbirths were so rare, that he did not believe there could be above eleven\r\nhundred _struldbrugs_ of both sexes in the whole kingdom, of which he\r\ncomputed about fifty in the metropolis, and among the rest a young girl\r\nborn about three years ago; that these productions were not peculiar\r\nto any family, but a mere effect of chance, and the children of the\r\n_struldbrugs_ themselves were equally mortal with the rest of the people.\r\n\r\nI freely own myself to have been struck with inexpressible delight\r\nupon hearing this account; and the person who gave it me happening\r\nto understand the Balnibarbian language, which I spoke very well, I\r\ncould not forbear breaking out into expressions perhaps a little too\r\nextravagant. I cried out, as in a rapture, “Happy nation, where every\r\nchild has at least a chance for being immortal! Happy people, who enjoy\r\nso many living examples of ancient virtue, and have masters ready to\r\ninstruct them in the wisdom of all former ages! but happiest beyond all\r\ncomparison are those excellent _struldbrugs_, who, born exempt from\r\nthat universal calamity of human nature, have their minds free and\r\ndisengaged, without the weight and depression of spirits caused by the\r\ncontinual apprehension of death.” I discovered my admiration that I had\r\nnot observed any of these illustrious persons at court; the black spot\r\non the forehead being so remarkable a distinction, that I could not have\r\neasily overlooked it; and it was impossible that his majesty, a most\r\njudicious prince, should not provide himself with a good number of such\r\nwise and able counselors. Yet perhaps the virtue of those reverend sages\r\nwas too strict for the corrupt and libertine manners of a court; and we\r\noften find by experience, that young men are too opinionated and volatile\r\nto be guided by the sober dictates of their seniors. However, since the\r\nking was pleased to allow me access to his royal person, I was resolved\r\nupon the very first occasion, to deliver my opinion to him on this\r\nmatter freely and at large, by the help of my interpreter; and whether he\r\nwould please to take my advice or no, yet in one thing I was determined,\r\nthat his majesty having frequently offered me an establishment in this\r\ncountry, I would with great thankfulness accept the favor, and pass my\r\nlife here in the conversation of those superior beings the _struldbrugs_,\r\nif they would please to admit me.\r\n\r\nThe gentleman to whom I addressed my discourse, because (as I have\r\nalready observed) he spoke the language of Balnibarbi, said to me with a\r\nsort of a smile which usually arises from pity to the ignorant, that he\r\nwas glad of any occasion to keep me among them, and desired my permission\r\nto explain to the company what I had spoken. He did so, and they talked\r\ntogether for some time in their own language, whereof I understood not a\r\nsyllable, neither could I observe by their countenances what impression\r\nmy discourse had made on them. After a short silence, the same person\r\ntold me that his friends and mine (so he thought fit to express himself)\r\nwere very much pleased with the judicious remarks I had made on the great\r\nhappiness and advantages of immortal life, and they were desirous to know\r\nin a particular manner, what scheme of living I should have formed to\r\nmyself if it had fallen to my lot to have been born a _struldbrug_.\r\n\r\nI answered, it was easy to be eloquent on so copious and delightful a\r\nsubject, especially to me, who had been often apt to amuse myself with\r\nvisions of what I should do if I were a king, a general, or a great lord;\r\nand upon this very case I had frequently run over the whole system how I\r\nshould employ myself, and pass the time, if I were sure to live forever.\r\n\r\nThat if it had been my good fortune to come into the world a\r\n_struldbrug_, as soon as I could discover my own happiness by\r\nunderstanding the difference between life and death, I would first\r\nresolve, by all arts and methods whatsoever, to procure myself riches; in\r\nthe pursuit of which, by thrift and management, I might reasonably expect\r\nin about two hundred years to be the wealthiest man in the kingdom. In\r\nthe second place, I would from my earliest youth apply myself to the\r\nstudy of arts and sciences, by which I should arrive in time to excel all\r\nothers in learning. Lastly, I would carefully record every action and\r\nevent of consequence that happened in the public, impartially draw the\r\ncharacters of the several successions of princes and great ministers of\r\nstate, with my own observations on every point. I would exactly set down\r\nthe several changes in customs, language, fashions of dress, diet, and\r\ndiversions. By all which acquirements I should be a living treasury of\r\nknowledge and wisdom, and certainly become the oracle of the nation.\r\n\r\nI would never marry after threescore, but live in a hospitable manner,\r\nyet still on the saving side. I would entertain myself in forming and\r\ndirecting the minds of hopeful young men, by convincing them from my own\r\nremembrance, experience, and observation, fortified by numerous examples,\r\nof the usefulness of virtue in public and private life. But my choice\r\nand constant companions should be a set of my own immortal brotherhood,\r\namong whom I would elect a dozen from the most ancient down to my own\r\ncontemporaries. Where any of these wanted fortunes, I would provide them\r\nwith convenient lodges round my own estate, and have some of them always\r\nat my table; only mingling a few of the most valuable among you mortals,\r\nwhom length of time would harden me to lose with little or no reluctance,\r\nand treat your posterity after the same manner; just as a man diverts\r\nhimself with the annual succession of pinks and tulips in his garden,\r\nwithout regretting the loss of those which withered the preceding year.\r\n\r\nThese _struldbrugs_ and I would mutually communicate our observations\r\nand memorials, through the course of time; remark the several gradations\r\nby which corruption steals into the world, and oppose it in every step,\r\nby giving perpetual warning and instruction to mankind; which, added to\r\nthe strong influence of our own example, would probably prevent that\r\ncontinual degeneracy of human nature so unjustly complained of in all\r\nages.\r\n\r\nAdd to all this the pleasure of seeing the various revolutions of\r\nstates and empires; the changes in the lower and upper world; ancient\r\ncities in ruins, and obscure villages become the seats of kings; famous\r\nrivers lessening into shallow brooks; the ocean leaving one coast dry,\r\nand overwhelming another; the discovery of many countries yet unknown;\r\nbarbarity overrunning the politest nations, and the most barbarous\r\nbecome civilized. I should then see the discovery of the longitude, the\r\nperpetual motion, the universal medicine, and many other great inventions\r\nbrought to the utmost perfection.\r\n\r\nWhat wonderful discoveries should we make in astronomy, by outliving and\r\nconfirming our own predictions; by observing the progress and returns of\r\ncomets, with the changes of motion in the sun, moon, and stars!\r\n\r\nI enlarged upon many other topics which the natural desire of endless\r\nlife and sublunary happiness could easily furnish me with. When I had\r\nended, and the sum of my discourse had been interpreted as before, to\r\nthe rest of the company, there was a good deal of talk among them in the\r\nlanguage of the country, not without some laughter at my expense. At last\r\nthe same gentleman who had been my interpreter said he was desired by the\r\nrest to set me right in a few mistakes which I had fallen into through\r\nthe common imbecility of human nature, and upon that allowance was less\r\nanswerable for them. That this breed of _struldbrugs_ was peculiar to\r\ntheir country, for there were no such people either in Balnibarbi or\r\nJapan, where he had the honor to be ambassador from his majesty, and\r\nfound the natives in both those kingdoms very hard to believe that the\r\nfact was possible, and it appeared from my astonishment when he first\r\nmentioned the matter to me, that I received it as a thing wholly new, and\r\nscarcely to be credited. That in the two kingdoms above mentioned, where\r\nduring his residence he had conversed very much, he observed long life to\r\nbe the universal desire and wish of mankind. That whoever had one foot in\r\nthe grave was sure to hold back the other as strongly as he could. That\r\nthe oldest had still hopes of living one day longer, and looked on death\r\nas the greatest evil, from which nature always prompted him to retreat.\r\nOnly in this island of Luggnagg the appetite for living was not so eager,\r\nfrom the continual example of the _struldbrugs_ before their eyes.\r\n\r\nThat the system of living contrived by me was unreasonable and unjust,\r\nbecause it supposed a perpetuity of youth, health, and vigor, which no\r\nman could be so foolish to hope, however extravagant he may be in his\r\nwishes. That the question therefore was not whether a man would choose\r\nto be always in the prime of youth, attended with prosperity and health,\r\nbut how he would pass a perpetual life under all the usual disadvantages\r\nwhich old age brings along with it. For although few men will avow their\r\ndesires of being immortal upon such hard conditions, yet in the two\r\nkingdoms before mentioned, of Balnibarbi and Japan, he observed that\r\nevery man desired to put off death for some time longer, let it approach\r\never so late; and he rarely heard of any man who died willingly, except\r\nhe were incited by the extremity of grief or torture. And he appealed to\r\nme, whether in those countries I had traveled, as well as my own, I had\r\nnot observed the same general disposition.\r\n\r\nAfter this preface, he gave me a particular account of the _struldbrugs_\r\namong them. He said they commonly acted like mortals till about thirty\r\nyears old; after which, by degrees, they grew melancholy and dejected,\r\nincreasing in both till they came to fourscore. This he learned from\r\ntheir own confession; for otherwise, there not being above two or\r\nthree of that species born in an age, they were too few to form a\r\ngeneral observation by. When they came to fourscore years, which is\r\nreckoned the extremity of living in this country, they had not only\r\nall the follies and infirmities of other old men, but many more which\r\narose from the dreadful prospect of never dying. They were not only\r\nopinionative, peevish, covetous, morose, vain, talkative, but incapable\r\nof friendship, and dead to all natural affection, which never descended\r\nbelow their grandchildren. Envy and impotent desires are their prevailing\r\npassions. But those objects against which their envy seems principally\r\ndirected, are the vices of the younger sort, and the deaths of the old.\r\nBy reflecting on the former, they find themselves cut off from all\r\npossibility of pleasure; and whenever they see a funeral they lament and\r\nrepine that others are gone to a harbor of rest, to which they themselves\r\nnever can hope to arrive. They have no remembrance of anything but what\r\nthey learned and observed in their youth and middle age, and even that is\r\nvery imperfect; and for the truth or particulars of any fact it is safer\r\nto depend on common traditions than upon their best recollections. The\r\nleast miserable among them appear to be those who turn to dotage, and\r\nentirely lose their memories; these meet with more pity and assistance,\r\nbecause they want many bad qualities which abound in others.\r\n\r\nIf a _struldbrug_ happen to marry one of his own kind, the marriage\r\nis dissolved of course by the courtesy of the kingdom, as soon as the\r\nyounger of the two comes to be fourscore; for the law thinks it a\r\nreasonable indulgence, that those who are condemned without any fault of\r\ntheir own to a perpetual continuance in the world, should not have their\r\nmisery doubled by the load of a wife.\r\n\r\nAs soon as they have completed the term of eighty years, they are looked\r\non as dead in law; their heirs immediately succeed to their estates,\r\nonly a small pittance is reserved for their support, and the poor ones\r\nare maintained at the public charge. After that period they are held\r\nincapable of any employment of trust or profit; they cannot purchase\r\nlands or take leases; neither are they allowed to be witnesses in any\r\ncause, either civil or criminal, not even for the decision of meres and\r\nbounds.\r\n\r\nAt ninety they lose their teeth and hair; they have at that age no\r\ndistinction of taste, but eat and drink whatever they can get, without\r\nrelish or appetite. The diseases they were subject to still continue,\r\nwithout increasing or diminishing. In talking they forget the common\r\nappellation of things, and the names of persons, even of those who are\r\ntheir nearest friends and relations. For the same reason, they never\r\ncan amuse themselves with reading, because their memory will not serve\r\nto carry them from the beginning of a sentence to the end; and by this\r\ndefect they are deprived of the only entertainment whereof they might\r\notherwise be capable.\r\n\r\nThe language of this country being always upon the flux, the\r\n_struldbrugs_ of one age do not understand those of another; neither are\r\nthey able after two hundred years to hold any conversation (farther than\r\nby a few general words) with their neighbors the mortals; and thus they\r\nlie under the disadvantage of living like foreigners in their own country.\r\n\r\nThis was the account given me of the _struldbrugs_, as near as I can\r\nremember. I afterwards saw five or six of different ages, the youngest\r\nnot above two hundred years old, who were brought to me at several times\r\nby some of my friends; but although they were told that I was a great\r\ntraveler and had seen all the world, they had not the least curiosity to\r\nask me a question; only desired I would give them _slumskudask_, or a\r\ntoken of remembrance, which is a modest way of begging, to avoid the law\r\nthat strictly forbids it, because they are provided for by the public,\r\nalthough indeed with a very scanty allowance.\r\n\r\nThey are despised and hated by all sorts of people. When one of them\r\nis born it is reckoned ominous, and their birth is recorded very\r\nparticularly; so that you may know their age by consulting the registry,\r\nwhich however has not been kept above a thousand years past, or at least\r\nhas been destroyed by time or public disturbances. But the usual way of\r\ncomputing how old they are, is by asking them what kings or great persons\r\nthey can remember, and then consulting history; for infallibly the last\r\nprince in their mind did not begin his reign after they were fourscore\r\nyears old.\r\n\r\nThey were the most mortifying sight I ever beheld; and the women were\r\nmore horrible than the men. Besides the usual deformities in extreme\r\nold age, they acquired an additional ghastliness in proportion to their\r\nnumber of years, which is not to be described; and among half a dozen, I\r\nsoon distinguished which was the eldest, although there was not above a\r\ncentury or two between them.\r\n\r\nThe reader will easily believe, that from what I had heard and seen, my\r\nkeen appetite for perpetuity of life was much abated. I grew heartily\r\nashamed of the pleasing visions I had formed, and thought no tyrant could\r\ninvent a death into which I would not run with pleasure from such a life.\r\nThe king heard of all that had passed between me and my friends upon this\r\noccasion, and rallied me very pleasantly, wishing I would send a couple\r\nof _struldbrugs_ to my own country, to arm our people against the fear of\r\ndeath; but this, it seems, is forbidden by the fundamental laws of the\r\nkingdom, or else I should have been well content with the trouble and\r\nexpense of transporting them.\r\n\r\nI could not but agree that the laws of this kingdom relative to the\r\n_struldbrugs_ were founded upon the strongest reasons, and such as\r\nany other country would be under the necessity of enacting in the like\r\ncircumstances. Otherwise, as avarice is the necessary consequent of\r\nold age, those immortals would in time become proprietors of the whole\r\nnation, and engross the civil power, which, for want of abilities to\r\nmanage, must end in the ruin of the public.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n    THE AUTHOR LEAVES LUGGNAGG AND SAILS TO JAPAN—FROM THENCE HE\r\n    RETURNS IN A DUTCH SHIP TO AMSTERDAM, AND FROM AMSTERDAM TO\r\n    ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nI thought this account of the _struldbrugs_ might be some entertainment\r\nto the reader, because it seems to be a little out of the common way; at\r\nleast I do not remember to have met the like in any book of travels that\r\nhas come to my hands. And if I am deceived, my excuse must be, that it\r\nis necessary for travelers who describe the same country, very often to\r\nagree in dwelling on the same particulars, without deserving the censure\r\nof having borrowed or transcribed from those who wrote before them.\r\n\r\nThere is indeed a perpetual commerce between this kingdom and the great\r\nempire of Japan, and it is very probable that the Japanese authors may\r\nhave given some account of the _struldbrugs_; but my stay in Japan was so\r\nshort, and I was so entirely a stranger to that language, that I was not\r\nqualified to make any inquiries. But I hope the Dutch, upon this notice,\r\nwill be curious and able enough to supply my defects.\r\n\r\nHis majesty having often pressed me to accept some employment in his\r\ncourt, and finding me absolutely determined to return to my native\r\ncountry, was pleased to give me his license to depart, and honored me\r\nwith a letter of recommendation under his own hand, to the Emperor of\r\nJapan. He likewise presented me with four hundred and forty-four large\r\npieces of gold (this nation delighting in even numbers), and a red\r\ndiamond which I sold in England for eleven hundred pounds.\r\n\r\nOn the sixth of May, 1709, I took a solemn leave of his majesty and all\r\nmy friends. This prince was so gracious as to order a guard to conduct\r\nme to Glanguenstald, which is a royal port to the southwest part of\r\nthe island. In six days I found a vessel ready to carry me to Japan,\r\nand spent fifteen days in the voyage. We landed at a small port town\r\ncalled Xamoschi, situated on the southeast part of Japan; the town lies\r\non the western point, where there is a narrow strait leading northward\r\ninto a long arm of the sea, upon the northwest part of which Yedo, the\r\nmetropolis, stands. At landing I showed the customhouse officers my\r\nletter from the king of Luggnagg to his imperial majesty. They knew\r\nthe seal perfectly well; it was as broad as the palm of my hand. The\r\nimpression was a king lifting up a lame beggar from the earth. The\r\nmagistrates of the town, hearing of my letter, received me as a public\r\nminister; they provided me with carriages and servants, and bore my\r\ncharges to Yedo, where I was admitted to an audience, and delivered\r\nmy letter, which was opened with great ceremony, and explained to the\r\nemperor by an interpreter, who then gave me notice, by his majesty’s\r\norder, that I should signify my request, and whatever it were, it\r\nshould be granted for the sake of his royal brother of Luggnagg.\r\nThis interpreter was a person employed to transact affairs with the\r\nHollanders; he soon conjectured by my countenance, that I was a European,\r\nand therefore repeated his majesty’s commands in Low Dutch, which he\r\nspoke perfectly well. I answered, as I had before determined, that I was\r\na Dutch merchant, shipwrecked in a remote country, whence I traveled\r\nby sea and land to Luggnagg, and then took shipping for Japan, where\r\nI knew my countrymen often traded, and with some of these I hoped to\r\nget an opportunity of returning into Europe. I therefore most humbly\r\nentreated his royal favor, to give order that I should be conducted\r\nin safety to Nangasac. To this I added another petition, that for the\r\nsake of my patron the king of Luggnagg his majesty would condescend to\r\nexcuse my performing the ceremony imposed on my countrymen of trampling\r\nupon the crucifix, because I had been thrown into his kingdom by my\r\nmisfortunes, without any intention of trading. When this latter petition\r\nwas interpreted to the emperor, he seemed a little surprised, and said\r\nhe believed I was the first of my countrymen who ever made any scruple\r\nin this point, and that he began to doubt whether I was a real Hollander\r\nor no; but rather suspected that I must be a Christian. However, for the\r\nreasons I had offered, but chiefly to gratify the king of Luggnagg by an\r\nuncommon mark of his favor, he would comply with the singularity of my\r\nhumor; but the affair must be managed with dexterity, and his officers\r\nshould be commanded to let me pass as it were by forgetfulness; for he\r\nassured me that if the secret should be discovered by my countrymen, the\r\nDutch, they would cut my throat on the voyage. I returned my thanks, by\r\nthe interpreter, for so unusual a favor; and some troops being at that\r\ntime on the march to Nangasac, the commanding officer had orders to\r\nconvey me safe thither, with particular instructions about the business\r\nof the crucifix.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th day of June, 1709, I arrived at Nangasac, after a very long\r\nand troublesome journey. I soon fell into company of some Dutch sailors\r\nbelonging to the Amboyna of Amsterdam, a stout ship of 450 tons. I had\r\nlived long in Holland, pursuing my studies at Leyden, and I spoke Dutch\r\nwell. The seamen soon knew whence I came last; they were curious to\r\ninquire into my voyages and course of life. I made up a story as short\r\nand probable as I could, but concealed the greatest part. I knew many\r\npersons in Holland; I was able to invent names for my parents, whom I\r\npretended to be obscure people in the province of Gelderland. I would\r\nhave given the captain (one Theodorus Vangrult) what he pleased to ask\r\nfor my voyage to Holland; but understanding I was a surgeon, he was\r\ncontented to take half the usual rate, on condition that I would serve\r\nhim in the way of my calling. Before we took ship, I was often asked by\r\nsome of the crew whether I had performed the ceremony above mentioned. I\r\nevaded the question by general answers that I had satisfied the emperor\r\nand court in all particulars. However, a malicious rogue of a skipper\r\nwent to an officer, and pointing to me, told him I had not yet trampled\r\non the crucifix; but the other, who had received instructions to let me\r\npass, gave the rascal twenty strokes on the shoulders with a bamboo;\r\nafter which I was no more troubled with such questions.\r\n\r\nNothing happened worth mentioning in this voyage. We sailed with a fair\r\nwind to the Cape of Good Hope, where we stayed only to take in fresh\r\nwater. On the 16th of April we arrived safe at Amsterdam, having lost\r\nonly three men by sickness in the voyage, and a fourth who fell from the\r\nforemast into the sea, not far from the coast of Guinea. From Amsterdam I\r\nsoon after set sail for England, in a small vessel belonging to that city.\r\n\r\nOn the 10th of April, 1710, we put in at the Downs. I landed the next\r\nmorning, and saw once more my native country, after an absence of\r\nfive years and six months complete. I went straight to Redriff, where\r\nI arrived the same day at two in the afternoon, and found my wife and\r\nfamily in good health.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END OF THE THIRD PART.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA VOYAGE TO THE COUNTRY OF THE HOUYHNHNMS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n    THE AUTHOR SETS OUT AS CAPTAIN OF A SHIP—HIS MEN CONSPIRE\r\n    AGAINST HIM, CONFINE HIM A LONG TIME TO HIS CABIN, AND SET HIM\r\n    ON SHORE IN AN UNKNOWN LAND—HE TRAVELS UP IN THE COUNTRY—THE\r\n    YAHOOS, A STRANGE SORT OF ANIMAL, DESCRIBED—THE AUTHOR MEETS\r\n    TWO HOUYHNHNMS.\r\n\r\n\r\nI continued at home with my wife and children about five months in a\r\nvery happy condition, if I could have learned the lesson of knowing\r\nwhen I was well. I left my poor wife big with child, and accepted an\r\nadvantageous offer made me to be captain of the Adventure, a stout\r\nmerchantman of 350 tons: for I understood navigation well, and being\r\ngrown weary of a surgeon’s employment at sea, which, however, I could\r\nexercise upon occasion, I took a skillful young man of that calling, one\r\nRobert Purefoy, into my ship. We set sail from Portsmouth upon the 7th\r\nday of August, 1710; on the 14th, we met with Captain Pocock of Bristol,\r\nat Tenerife, who was going to the bay of Campeachy to cut logwood. On the\r\n16th, he was parted from us by a storm: I heard since my return, that his\r\nship foundered, and none escaped but one cabin-boy. He was an honest man,\r\nand a good sailor, but a little too positive in his own opinions; which\r\nwas the cause of his destruction, as it has been of several others: for\r\nif he had followed my advice, he might have been safe at home with his\r\nfamily at this time as well as myself.\r\n\r\nI had several men died in my ship of calentures, so that I was forced to\r\nget recruits out of Barbadoes and the Leeward Islands, where I touched\r\nby the direction of the merchants who employed me; which I had soon too\r\nmuch cause to repent; for I found afterwards that most of them had been\r\nbuccaneers. I had fifty hands on board, and my orders were, that I should\r\ntrade with the Indians in the South Sea, and make what discoveries I\r\ncould. These rogues whom I had picked up debauched my other men, and\r\nthey all formed a conspiracy to seize the ship and secure me; which they\r\ndid one morning, rushing into my cabin, and binding me hand and foot,\r\nthreatening to throw me overboard if I offered to stir. I told them I was\r\ntheir prisoner and would submit. This they made me swear to do, and then\r\nthey unbound me, only fastening one of my legs with a chain, near my bed,\r\nand placed a sentry at my door with his piece charged, who was commanded\r\nto shoot me dead, if I attempted my liberty. They sent me down victuals\r\nand drink, and took the government of the ship to themselves. Their\r\ndesign was to turn pirates, and plunder the Spaniards, which they could\r\nnot do till they got more men. But first they resolved to sell the goods\r\nin the ship, and then go to Madagascar for recruits, several among them\r\nhaving died since my confinement. They sailed many weeks, and traded with\r\nthe Indians; but I knew not what course they took, being kept a close\r\nprisoner in my cabin, and expecting nothing less than to be murdered, as\r\nthey often threatened me.\r\n\r\nUpon the 9th of May, 1711, one James Welch came down to my cabin, and\r\nsaid he had orders from the captain to set me ashore. I expostulated\r\nwith him, but in vain; neither would he so much as tell me who their\r\nnew captain was. They forced me into the longboat, letting me put on my\r\nbest suit of clothes, which were as good as new, and take a small bundle\r\nof linen, but no arms except my hanger; and they were so civil as not\r\nto search my pockets, into which I conveyed what money I had, with some\r\nother little necessaries. They rowed about a league, and then set me down\r\non a strand. I desired them to tell me what country it was. They all\r\nswore they knew no more than myself, but said that the captain (as they\r\ncalled him) was resolved, after they had sold the lading, to get rid of\r\nme in the first place where they could discover land. They pushed off\r\nimmediately, advising me to make haste for fear of being overtaken by the\r\ntide, and so bade me farewell.\r\n\r\nIn this desolate condition I advanced, and soon got upon firm ground,\r\nwhere I sat down on a bank to rest myself, and consider what I had\r\nbest to do. When I was a little refreshed, I went up into the country,\r\nresolving to deliver myself to the first savages I should meet, and\r\npurchase my life from them by some bracelets, glass rings, and other\r\ntoys which sailors usually provide themselves with in those voyages, and\r\nwhereof I had some about me. The land was divided by long rows of trees,\r\nnot regularly planted, but naturally growing; there was great plenty of\r\ngrass, and several fields of oats. I walked very circumspectly, for fear\r\nof being surprised, or suddenly shot with an arrow from behind or on\r\neither side. I fell into a beaten road, where I saw many tracks of human\r\nfeet, and some of cows, but most of horses. At last I beheld several\r\nanimals in a field, and one or two of the same kind sitting in trees.\r\nTheir shape was very singular and deformed, which a little discomposed\r\nme, so that I lay down behind a thicket to observe them better. Some of\r\nthem coming forward near the place where I lay, gave me an opportunity of\r\ndistinctly marking their form. Their heads and breasts were covered with\r\na thick hair, some frizzled and others lank; they had beards like goats,\r\nand a long ridge of hair down their backs, and the foreparts of their\r\nlegs and feet; but the rest of their bodies was bare, so that I might\r\nsee their skins, which were of a brown buff color. They had no tails, and\r\nused the sitting posture, as well as lying down, and often stood on their\r\nhind feet. They climbed high trees as nimbly as a squirrel, for they had\r\nstrong extended claws before and behind, terminating in sharp points, and\r\nhooked. They would often spring, and bound, and leap, with prodigious\r\nagility. The females were not so large as the males; they had long lank\r\nhair on their backs, but none on their faces, nor anything more than a\r\nsort of down on the rest of their bodies. The hair of both sexes was of\r\nseveral colors, brown, red, black, and yellow. Upon the whole I never\r\nbeheld in all my travels so disagreeable an animal, nor one against which\r\nI naturally conceived so strong an antipathy; so that thinking I had seen\r\nenough, full of contempt and aversion, I got up, and pursued the beaten\r\nroad, hoping it might direct me to the cabin of some Indian. I had not\r\ngone far when I met one of these creatures full in my way, and coming up\r\ndirectly to me. The ugly monster, when he saw me, distorted several ways\r\nevery feature of his visage, and stared as at an object he had never seen\r\nbefore; then approaching nearer, lifted up his forepaw, whether out of\r\ncuriosity or mischief I could not tell; but I drew my hanger, and gave\r\nhim a good blow with the flat side of it, for I durst not strike him with\r\nthe edge, fearing the inhabitants might be provoked against me, if they\r\nshould come to know that I had killed or maimed any of their cattle. When\r\nthe beast felt the smart, he drew back, and roared so loud, that a herd\r\nof at least forty came flocking about me from the next field, howling and\r\nmaking odious faces; but I ran to the body of a tree, and leaning my back\r\nagainst it, kept them off by waving my hanger.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of this distress, I observed all to run away on a sudden as\r\nfast as they could; at which I ventured to leave the tree and pursue the\r\nroad, wondering what it was that could put them into this fright. But\r\nlooking on my left hand I saw a horse walking softly in the field; which\r\nmy persecutors having sooner discovered, was the cause of their flight.\r\nThe horse started a little when he came near me, but soon recovering\r\nhimself, looked full in my face with manifest tokens of wonder. He viewed\r\nmy hands and feet, walking round me several times. I would have pursued\r\nmy journey, but he placed himself directly in the way, yet looking with\r\na very mild aspect, never offering the least violence. We stood gazing\r\nat each other for some time; at last I took the boldness to reach my\r\nhand towards his neck with a design to stroke it, using the common style\r\nand whistle of jockeys when they are going to handle a strange horse.\r\nBut this animal seeming to receive my civilities with disdain, shook his\r\nhead, and bent his brows, softly raising up his right forefoot to remove\r\nmy hand. Then he neighed three or four times, but in so different a\r\ncadence, that I almost began to think he was speaking to himself in some\r\nlanguage of his own.\r\n\r\nWhile he and I were thus employed, another horse came up; who applying\r\nhimself to the first in a very formal manner, they gently struck each\r\nother’s right hoof before, neighing several times by turns, and varying\r\nthe sound, which seemed to be almost articulate. They went some paces\r\noff, as if it were to confer together, walking side by side, backwards\r\nand forwards, like persons deliberating upon some affair of weight, but\r\noften turning their eyes towards me, as it were to watch that I might not\r\nescape. I was amazed to see such actions and behavior in brute beasts;\r\nand concluded with myself, that if the inhabitants of this country were\r\nindued with a proportionable degree of reason, they must needs be the\r\nwisest people upon earth. This thought gave me so much comfort, that I\r\nresolved to go forward until I could discover some house or village,\r\nor meet with any of the natives, leaving the two horses to discourse\r\ntogether as they pleased. But the first, who was a dapple gray, observing\r\nme to steal off, neighed after me in so expressive a tone, that I fancied\r\nmyself to understand what he meant; whereupon I turned back, and came\r\nnear him, to expect his farther commands, but concealing my fear as much\r\nas I could; for I began to be in some pain how this adventure might\r\nterminate; and the reader will easily believe I did not much like my\r\npresent situation.\r\n\r\nThe two horses came up close to me, looking with great earnestness upon\r\nmy face and hands. The gray steed rubbed my hat all round with his\r\nright forehoof, and discomposed it so much that I was forced to adjust\r\nit better by taking it off, and settling it again; whereat both he and\r\nhis companion (who was a brown bay) appeared to be much surprised; the\r\nlatter felt the lappet of my coat, and finding it to hang loose about\r\nme, they both looked with new signs of wonder. He stroked my right hand,\r\nseeming to admire the softness and color; but he squeezed it so hard\r\nbetween his hoof and his pastern, that I was forced to roar; after which\r\nthey both touched me with all possible tenderness. They were under great\r\nperplexity about my shoes and stockings, which they felt very often,\r\nneighing to each other, and using various gestures, not unlike those of\r\na philosopher, when he would attempt to solve some new and difficult\r\nphenomenon.\r\n\r\nUpon the whole, the behavior of these animals was so orderly and\r\nrational, so acute and judicious, that I at last concluded they must\r\nneeds be magicians, who had thus metamorphosed themselves upon some\r\ndesign, and seeing a stranger in the way, were resolved to divert\r\nthemselves with him; or perhaps were really amazed at the sight of a man\r\nso very different in habit, feature, and complexion, from those who might\r\nprobably live in so remote a climate. Upon the strength of this reasoning\r\nI ventured to address them in the following manner: “Gentlemen, if you\r\nbe conjurors, as I have good cause to believe, you can understand any\r\nlanguage; therefore I make bold to let your worships know that I am a\r\npoor distressed Englishman, driven by his misfortunes upon your coast;\r\nand I entreat one of you to let me ride upon his back, as if he were a\r\nreal horse, to some house or village where I can be relieved. In return\r\nof which favor, I will make you a present of this knife and bracelet”\r\n(taking them out of my pocket). The two creatures stood silent while I\r\nspoke, seeming to listen with great attention; and when I had ended, they\r\nneighed frequently towards each other, as if they were engaged in serious\r\nconversation. I plainly observed that their language expressed the\r\npassions very well, and the words might, with little pains, be resolved\r\ninto an alphabet more easily than the Chinese.\r\n\r\nI could frequently distinguish the word _yahoo_, which was repeated\r\nby each of them several times; and although it was impossible for me\r\nto conjecture what it meant, yet, while the two horses were busy in\r\nconversation, I endeavored to practice this word upon my tongue; and as\r\nsoon as they were silent, boldly pronounced _yahoo_ in a loud voice,\r\nimitating at the same time, as near as I could, the neighing of a horse;\r\nat which they were both visibly surprised and the gray repeated the\r\nsame word twice, as if he meant to teach me the right accent, wherein\r\nI spoke after him as well as I could, and found myself perceivably to\r\nimprove every time, though very far from any degree of perfection. Then\r\nthe bay tried me with a second word, much harder to be pronounced; but\r\nreducing it to the English orthography may be spelt thus—Houyhnhnm. I\r\ndid not succeed in this so well as the former; but after two or three\r\nfarther trials, I had better fortune, and they both appeared amazed at my\r\ncapacity.\r\n\r\nAfter some farther discourse, which I then conjectured might relate\r\nto me, the two friends took their leaves, with the same compliment of\r\nstriking each other’s hoof; and the gray made me signs that I should walk\r\nbefore him, wherein I thought it prudent to comply, till I could find a\r\nbetter director. When I offered to slacken my pace, he would cry, _Hhuun,\r\nhhuun_. I guessed his meaning and gave him to understand, as well as I\r\ncould, that I was weary, and not able to walk faster; upon which he would\r\nstand awhile to let me rest.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n    THE AUTHOR CONDUCTED BY A HOUYHNHNM TO HIS HOUSE—THE HOUSE\r\n    DESCRIBED—THE AUTHOR’S RECEPTION—THE FOOD OF THE HOUYHNHNMS—THE\r\n    AUTHOR IN DISTRESS FOR WANT OF MEAT, IS AT LAST RELIEVED—HIS\r\n    MANNER OF FEEDING IN THIS COUNTRY.\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving traveled about three miles, we came to a long kind of building,\r\nmade of timber stuck in the ground, and wattled across; the roof was low,\r\nand covered with straw. I now began to be a little comforted, and took\r\nout some toys which travelers usually carry for presents to the savage\r\nIndians of America and other parts, in hopes the people of the house\r\nwould be thereby encouraged to receive me kindly. The horse made me a\r\nsign to go in first; it was a large room with a smooth clay floor, and a\r\nrack and manger extending the whole length on one side. There were three\r\nnags and two mares, not eating, but some of them sitting down upon their\r\nhams, which I very much wondered at; but wondered more to see the rest\r\nemployed in domestic business. They seemed but ordinary cattle; however,\r\nthis confirmed my first opinion, that a people who could so far civilize\r\nbrute animals must needs excel in wisdom all the nations of the world.\r\nThe gray came in just after, and thereby prevented any ill treatment\r\nwhich the others might have given me. He neighed to them several times in\r\na style of authority, and received answers.\r\n\r\nBeyond this room there were three others, reaching the length of the\r\nhouse, to which you passed through three doors, opposite to each other,\r\nin the manner of a vista; we went through the second room towards the\r\nthird. Here the gray walked in first, beckoning me to attend; I waited in\r\nthe second room, and got ready my presents for the master and mistress\r\nof the house; they were two knives, three bracelets of false pearl, a\r\nsmall looking-glass, and a bead necklace. The horse neighed three or four\r\ntimes, and I waited to hear some answers in a human voice, but I heard no\r\nother returns than in the same dialect, only one or two a little shriller\r\nthan his. I began to think that this house must belong to some person of\r\ngreat note among them, because there appeared so much ceremony before I\r\ncould gain admittance. But, that a man of quality should be served all\r\nby horses was beyond my comprehension. I feared my brain was disturbed\r\nby my sufferings and misfortunes: I roused myself, and looked about me\r\nin the room where I was left alone; this was furnished like the first,\r\nonly after a more elegant manner. I rubbed my eyes often, but the same\r\nobjects still occurred. I pinched my arms and sides to awake myself,\r\nhoping I might be in a dream. I then absolutely concluded that all these\r\nappearances could be nothing else but necromancy and magic. But I had no\r\ntime to pursue these reflections; for the gray horse came to the door,\r\nand made me a sign to follow him into the third room, where I saw a very\r\ncomely mare, together with a colt and foal, sitting on their haunches\r\nupon mats of straw, not unartfully made and perfectly neat and clean.\r\n\r\nThe mare soon after my entrance rose from her mat, and coming up\r\nclose, after having nicely observed my hands and face, gave me a most\r\ncontemptuous look; then turning to the horse, I heard the word _yahoo_\r\noften repeated betwixt them; the meaning of which word I could not then\r\ncomprehend, although it were the first I had learned to pronounce; but I\r\nwas soon better informed, to my everlasting mortification; for the horse\r\nbeckoning to me with his head, and repeating the _hhuun, hhuun_, as he\r\ndid upon the road, which I understood was to attend him, led me out into\r\na kind of court, where was another building at some distance from the\r\nhouse. Here we entered, and I saw three of these detestable creatures,\r\nwhom I first met after my landing, feeding upon roots, and the flesh of\r\nsome animals, which I afterwards found to be that of asses and dogs,\r\nand now and then a cow, dead by accident or disease. They were all tied\r\nby the neck with strong withes fastened to a beam; they held their food\r\nbetween the claws of their forefeet, and tore it with their teeth.\r\n\r\nThe master horse ordered a sorrel nag, one of his servants, to untie the\r\nlargest of these animals, and take him into the yard. The beast and I\r\nwere brought close together, and our countenances diligently compared\r\nboth by master and servant, who thereupon repeated several times the\r\nword _yahoo_. My horror and astonishment are not to be described, when I\r\nobserved in this abominable animal, a perfect human figure; the face of\r\nit indeed was flat and broad, the nose depressed, the lips large, and the\r\nmouth wide; but these differences are common to all savage nations, where\r\nthe lineaments of the countenance are distorted by the natives suffering\r\ntheir infants to lie groveling on the earth, or by carrying them on their\r\nbacks, nuzzling with their faces against the mother’s shoulders. The\r\nforefoot of the _yahoo_ differed from my hands in nothing else but the\r\nlength of the nails, the coarseness and brownness of the palms, and the\r\nhairiness on the backs. There was the same resemblance between our feet,\r\nwith the same differences, which I knew very well, though the horses did\r\nnot, because of my shoes and stockings; the same in every part of our\r\nbodies, except as to hairiness and color, which I have already described.\r\n\r\nThe great difficulty that seemed to stick with the two horses, was to see\r\nthe rest of my body so very different from that of a _yahoo_, for which\r\nI was obliged to my clothes, whereof they had no conception. The sorrel\r\nnag offered me a root, which he held (after their manner, which we shall\r\ndescribe in its proper place) between his hoof and pastern; I took it\r\nin my hand, and having smelt it, returned it to him again as civilly as\r\nI could. He brought out of the _yahoo’s_ kennel a piece of ass’s flesh,\r\nbut it smelt so offensively that I turned from it with loathing; he then\r\nthrew it to the _yahoo_, by whom it was greedily devoured. He afterwards\r\nshowed me a wisp of hay, and a fetlock full of oats; but I shook my\r\nhead, to signify that neither of these were food for me. And indeed I\r\nnow apprehended that I must absolutely starve, if I did not get to some\r\nof my own species; for as to those filthy _yahoos_, although there were\r\nfew greater lovers of mankind at that time than myself, yet I confess\r\nI never saw any sensitive being so detestable on all accounts; and the\r\nmore I came near them the more hateful they grew, while I stayed in that\r\ncountry. This the master horse observed by my behavior, and therefore\r\nsent the _yahoo_ back to his kennel. He then put his forehoof to his\r\nmouth, at which I was much surprised, although he did it with ease, and\r\nwith a motion that appeared perfectly natural; and made other signs to\r\nknow what I would eat; but I could not return him such an answer as he\r\nwas able to apprehend; and if he had understood me, I did not see how I\r\nwas possibly to contrive any way for finding myself nourishment. While\r\nwe were thus engaged, I observed a cow passing by, whereupon I pointed\r\nto her, and expressed a desire to go and milk her. This had its effect;\r\nfor he led me back into the house, and ordered a mare-servant to open a\r\nroom, where a good store of milk lay in earthen and wooden vessels, after\r\na very orderly and cleanly manner. She gave me a large bowlful, of which\r\nI drank very heartily, and found myself well refreshed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: “_I saw coming towards the house a kind of vehicle drawn\r\nlike a sledge by four yahoos_”\r\n\r\n_Page 261_]\r\n\r\nAbout noon, I saw coming towards the house a kind of vehicle drawn like a\r\nsledge by four _yahoos_. There was in it an old steed, who seemed to be\r\nof quality; he alighted with his hindfeet forward, having by accident got\r\nhurt in his left forefoot. He came to dine with our horse, who received\r\nhim with great civility. They dined in the best room, and had oats\r\nboiled in milk for the second course, which the old horse ate warm, but\r\nthe rest cold. Their mangers were placed circular in the middle of the\r\nroom, and divided into several partitions, round which they sat on their\r\nhaunches, upon bosses of straw. In the middle was a large rack, with\r\nangles answering to every partition of the manger; so that each horse and\r\nmare ate their own hay, and their own mash of oats and milk, with much\r\ndecency and regularity. The behavior of the young colt and foal appeared\r\nvery modest, and that of the master and mistress extremely cheerful and\r\ncomplaisant to their guest. The gray ordered me to stand by him; and much\r\ndiscourse passed between him and his friend concerning me, as I found by\r\nthe stranger’s often looking on me, and the frequent repetition of the\r\nword _yahoo_.\r\n\r\nI happened to wear my gloves, which the master gray observing, seemed\r\nperplexed, discovering signs of wonder what I had done to my forefeet; he\r\nput his hoof three or four times to them, as if he would signify that I\r\nshould reduce them to their former shape, which I presently did, pulling\r\noff both my gloves, and putting them into my pocket.\r\n\r\nThis occasioned farther talk, and I saw the company was pleased with my\r\nbehavior, whereof I soon found the good effects. I was ordered to speak\r\nthe few words I understood; and while they were at dinner, the master\r\ntaught me the names for oats, milk, fire, water, and some others; which I\r\ncould readily pronounce after him, having from my youth a great facility\r\nfor learning languages.\r\n\r\nWhen dinner was done, the master horse took me aside, and by signs and\r\nwords made me understand the concern he was in that I had nothing to\r\neat. Oats in their tongue are called _hluunh_. This word I pronounced\r\ntwo or three times; for although I had refused them at first, yet upon\r\nsecond thoughts I considered that I could contrive to make of them a\r\nkind of bread, which might be sufficient, with milk, to keep me alive,\r\ntill I could make my escape to some other country, and to creatures of\r\nmy own species. The horse immediately ordered a white mare-servant of\r\nhis family to bring me a good quantity of oats in a sort of wooden tray.\r\nThese I heated before the fire, as well as I could, and rubbed them till\r\nthe husks came off, which I made a shift to winnow from the grain: I\r\nground and beat them between two stones, then took water, and made them\r\ninto a kind of paste or cake, which I toasted at the fire, and ate warm\r\nwith milk. It was at first a very insipid diet, though common enough in\r\nmany parts of Europe, but grew tolerable by time; and having been often\r\nreduced to hard fare in my life, this was not the first experiment I had\r\nmade how easily nature is satisfied. And I cannot but observe, that I\r\nnever had one hour’s sickness while I stayed in this island. ’Tis true\r\nI sometimes made a shift to catch a rabbit or bird, by springs made of\r\n_yahoo’s_ hairs; and I often gathered wholesome herbs, which I boiled\r\nor ate as salads with my bread; and now and then, for a rarity, I made\r\na little butter and drank the whey. I was at first at a great loss for\r\nsalt, but custom soon reconciled me to the want of it; and I am confident\r\nthat the frequent use of salt among us is an effect of luxury, and was\r\nfirst introduced as a provocative to drink, except where it is necessary\r\nfor preserving of flesh in long voyages, or in places remote from great\r\nmarkets: for we observe no animal to be fond of it but man; and as to\r\nmyself, when I left this country, it was a great while before I could\r\nendure the taste of it in anything that I ate.\r\n\r\nThis is enough to say upon the subject of my diet, wherewith other\r\ntravelers fill their books, as if the readers were personally concerned\r\nwhether we fared well or ill. However, it was necessary to mention this\r\nmatter, lest the world should think it impossible that I could find\r\nsustenance for three years in such a country, and among such inhabitants.\r\n\r\nWhen it grew towards evening, the master horse ordered a place for me to\r\nlodge in; it was but six yards from the house, and separated from the\r\nstable of the _yahoos_. Here I got some straw, and covering myself with\r\nmy own clothes, slept very sound. But I was in a very short time better\r\naccommodated, as the reader shall know hereafter, when I come to treat\r\nmore particularly about my way of living.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n    THE AUTHOR STUDIOUS TO LEARN THE LANGUAGE—THE HOUYHNHNM HIS\r\n    MASTER ASSISTS IN TEACHING HIM—THE LANGUAGE DESCRIBED—SEVERAL\r\n    HOUYHNHNMS OF QUALITY COME OUT OF CURIOSITY TO SEE THE\r\n    AUTHOR—HE GIVES HIS MASTER A SHORT ACCOUNT OF HIS VOYAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy principal endeavor was to learn the language, which my master (for so\r\nI shall henceforth call him) and his children, and every servant of his\r\nhouse, were desirous to teach me; for they looked upon it as a prodigy\r\nthat a brute animal should discover such marks of a rational creature. I\r\npointed to everything, and inquired the name of it, which I wrote down\r\nin my journal book when I was alone, and corrected my bad accent, by\r\ndesiring those of the family to pronounce it often. In this employment, a\r\nsorrel nag, one of the under servants, was ready to assist me.\r\n\r\nIn speaking, they pronounce through the nose and throat, and their\r\nlanguage approaches nearest to the High Dutch or German, of any I know in\r\nEurope; but it is much more graceful and significant. The emperor Charles\r\nV. made almost the same observation when he said that if he were to speak\r\nto his horse, it should be in High Dutch.\r\n\r\nThe curiosity and impatience of my master were so great that he spent\r\nmany hours of his leisure to instruct me. He was convinced (as he\r\nafterwards told me) that I must be a _yahoo_, but my teachableness,\r\ncivility, and cleanliness, astonished him; which were qualities\r\naltogether so opposite to those animals. He was most perplexed about my\r\nclothes, reasoning sometimes with himself, whether they were a part of\r\nmy body; for I never pulled them off till the family were asleep, and\r\ngot them on before they waked in the morning. My master was eager to\r\nlearn whence I came; how I acquired those appearances of reason which I\r\ndiscovered in all my actions; and to know my story from my own mouth,\r\nwhich he hoped he should soon do by the great proficiency I made in\r\nlearning and pronouncing their words and sentences. To help my memory, I\r\nformed all I learned in the English alphabet, and wrote the words down,\r\nwith the translations. This last, after some time, I ventured to do in my\r\nmaster’s presence. It cost me much trouble to explain to him what I was\r\ndoing; for the inhabitants have not the least idea of books or literature.\r\n\r\nIn about ten weeks’ time I was able to understand most of his questions;\r\nand in three months could give him some tolerable answers. He was\r\nextremely curious to know from what part of the country I came, and how\r\nI was taught to imitate a rational creature; because the _yahoos_ (whom\r\nhe saw I exactly resembled in my head, hands and face, that were only\r\nvisible), with some appearance of cunning, and the strongest disposition\r\nto mischief, were observed to be the most unteachable of all brutes, I\r\nanswered that I came over the sea from a far place, with many others of\r\nmy own kind, in a great hollow vessel made of the bodies of trees; that\r\nmy companions forced me to land on this coast, and then left me to shift\r\nfor myself. It was with some difficulty, and by the help of many signs,\r\nthat I brought him to understand me. He replied, that I must needs be\r\nmistaken, or that I said the thing which was not. (For they have no\r\nword in their language to express lying or falsehood.) He knew it was\r\nimpossible that there could be a country beyond the sea, or that a parcel\r\nof brutes could move a wooden vessel whither they pleased upon water. He\r\nwas sure no Houyhnhnm alive could make such a vessel, nor would trust\r\n_yahoos_ to manage it.\r\n\r\nThe word Houyhnhnm, in their tongue, signifies a horse, and, in its\r\netymology, the perfection of nature. I told my master that I was at a\r\nloss for expression, but would improve as fast as I could; and hoped in\r\na short time I should be able to tell him wonders. He was pleased to\r\ndirect his own mare, his colt and foal, and the servants of the family,\r\nto take all opportunities of instructing me; and every day, for two or\r\nthree hours, he was at the same pains himself; several horses and mares\r\nof quality in the neighborhood came often to our house upon the report\r\nspread of a wonderful _yahoo_, that could speak like a Houyhnhnm, and\r\nseemed in his words and actions to discover some glimmerings of reason.\r\nThese delighted to converse with me; they put many questions and received\r\nsuch answers as I was able to return. By all these advantages I made\r\nso great a progress, that in five months from my arrival, I understood\r\nwhatever was spoken, and could express myself tolerably well.\r\n\r\nThe Houyhnhnms who came to visit my master out of a design of seeing and\r\ntalking with me, could hardly believe me to be a right _yahoo_, because\r\nmy body had a different covering from others of my kind. They were\r\nastonished to observe me without the usual hair or skin, except on my\r\nhead, face, and hands; but I discovered that secret to my master upon an\r\naccident which happened about a fortnight before.\r\n\r\nI have already told the reader, that every night, when the family were\r\ngone to bed, it was my custom to strip, and cover myself with my clothes:\r\nit happened one morning early, that my master sent for me by the sorrel\r\nnag, who was his valet; when he came I was fast asleep, my clothes\r\nfallen off on one side, and my shirt above my waist. I awaked at the\r\nnoise he made, and observed him to deliver his message in some disorder;\r\nafter which he went to my master, and in a great fright gave him a very\r\nconfused account of what he had seen. This I presently discovered; for\r\ngoing as soon as I was dressed to pay attendance upon his honor, he asked\r\nme the meaning of what his servant had reported, that I was not the same\r\nthing when I slept as I appeared to be at other times.\r\n\r\nI had hitherto concealed the secret of my dress, in order to distinguish\r\nmyself as much as possible from that cursed race of _yahoos_; but now\r\nI found it in vain to do so any longer. Besides, I considered that my\r\nclothes and shoes would soon wear out, which already were in a declining\r\ncondition, and must be supplied by some contrivance from the hides of\r\n_yahoos_ or other brutes; whereby the whole secret would be known. I\r\ntherefore told my master that in the country whence I came, those of\r\nmy kind always covered their bodies with the hairs of certain animals\r\nprepared by art, as well for decency as to avoid the inclemencies of\r\nair, both hot and cold; of which, as to my own person, I would give him\r\nimmediate conviction, if he pleased to command me. Whereupon I first\r\nunbuttoned my coat, and pulled it off. I did the same with my waistcoat.\r\nI drew off my shoes, stockings, and breeches.\r\n\r\nMy master observed the whole performance with great signs of curiosity\r\nand admiration. He took up all my clothes in his pastern, one piece\r\nafter another, and examined them diligently; he then stroked my body\r\nvery gently, and looked round me several times; after which he said, it\r\nwas plain I must be a perfect _yahoo_; but that I differed very much\r\nfrom the rest of my species, in the softness, whiteness, and smoothness\r\nof my skin; my want of hair on several parts of my body; the shape and\r\nshortness of my claws behind and before; and my affectation of walking\r\ncontinually on my two hinder feet. He desired to see no more; and gave me\r\nleave to put on my clothes again, for I was shuddering with cold.\r\n\r\nI expressed my uneasiness at his giving me so often the appellation\r\nof _yahoo_, an odious animal, for which I had so utter a hatred and\r\ncontempt; I begged he would forbear applying that word to me, and take\r\nthe same order in his family and among his friends whom he suffered\r\nto see me. I requested likewise, that the secret of my having a false\r\ncovering to my body might be known to none but himself, at least as long\r\nas my present clothing should last; for, as to what the sorrel nag, his\r\nvalet, had observed, his honor might command him to conceal it.\r\n\r\nAll this my master very graciously consented to, and thus the secret was\r\nkept till my clothes began to wear out, which I was forced to supply by\r\nseveral contrivances that shall hereafter be mentioned. In the meantime,\r\nhe desired I would go on with my utmost diligence to learn their\r\nlanguage, because he was more astonished at my capacity for speech and\r\nreason, than at the figure of my body, whether it were covered or no;\r\nadding, that he waited with some impatience to hear the wonders which I\r\npromised to tell him.\r\n\r\nThenceforward he doubled the pains he had been at to instruct me; he\r\nbrought me into all company, and made them treat me with civility,\r\nbecause, as he told them privately, this would put me into good humor,\r\nand make me more diverting.\r\n\r\nEvery day, when I waited on him, besides the trouble he was at in\r\nteaching, he would ask me several questions concerning myself, which I\r\nanswered as well as I could; and by these means he had already received\r\nsome general ideas, though very imperfect. It would be tedious to relate\r\nthe several steps by which I advanced to a more regular conversation, but\r\nthe first account I gave of myself in any order and length was to this\r\npurpose:\r\n\r\nThat I came from a very far country, as I already had attempted to tell\r\nhim, with about fifty more of my own species; that we traveled upon the\r\nseas in a great hollow vessel made of wood, and larger than his honor’s\r\nhouse. I described the ship to him in the best terms I could, and\r\nexplained, by the help of my handkerchief displayed, how it was driven\r\nforward by the wind. That upon a quarrel among us, I was set on shore\r\non this coast, where I walked forward, without knowing whither, till he\r\ndelivered me from the persecution of those execrable yahoos. He asked\r\nme who made the ship, and how it was possible that the Houyhnhnms of\r\nmy country would leave it to the management of brutes. My answer was,\r\nthat I durst proceed no farther in my relation, unless he would give me\r\nhis word and honor that he would not be offended, and then I would tell\r\nhim the wonders I had so often promised. He agreed; and I went on by\r\nassuring him that the ship was made by creatures like myself, who, in\r\nall the countries I had traveled, as well as in my own, were the only\r\ngoverning, rational animals; and that upon my arrival hither I was as\r\nmuch astonished to see the Houyhnhnms act like rational beings, as he or\r\nhis friends could be in finding some marks of reason in a creature he\r\nwas pleased to call a _yahoo_, to which I owned my resemblance in every\r\npart, but could not account for their degenerate and brutal nature. I\r\nsaid farther, that if good fortune ever restored me to my native country,\r\nto relate my travels hither, as I resolved to do, everybody would believe\r\nthat I said the thing which was not; that I invented the story out of\r\nmy own head; and—with all possible respect to himself, his family, and\r\nfriends, and under his promise of not being offended—our countrymen\r\nwould hardly think it probable that a Houyhnhnm should be the presiding\r\ncreature of a nation, and a _yahoo_ the brute.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n    THE HOUYHNHNMS’ NOTION OF TRUTH AND FALSEHOOD—THE AUTHOR’S\r\n    DISCOURSE DISAPPROVED BY HIS MASTER—THE AUTHOR GIVES A MORE\r\n    PARTICULAR ACCOUNT OF HIMSELF, AND THE ACCIDENTS OF HIS VOYAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy master heard me with great appearances of uneasiness in his\r\ncountenance; because doubting or not believing, are so little known in\r\nthis country, that the inhabitants cannot tell how to behave themselves\r\nunder such circumstances; and I remember, in frequent discourses with my\r\nmaster concerning the nature of manhood, in other parts of the world,\r\nhaving occasion to talk of lying and false representation, it was with\r\nmuch difficulty that he comprehended what I meant, although he had\r\notherwise a most acute judgment. For he argued thus: that the use of\r\nspeech was to make us understand one another, and to receive information\r\nof facts; now, if any one said the thing which was not, these ends were\r\ndefeated, because I cannot properly be said to understand him; and I\r\nam so far from receiving information, that he leaves me worse than in\r\nignorance, for I am led to believe a thing black when it is white, and\r\nshort when it is long. And these were all the notions he had concerning\r\nthat faculty of lying, so perfectly well understood among human creatures.\r\n\r\nTo return from this digression: When I asserted that the _yahoos_\r\nwere the only governing animals in my country, which my master said\r\nwas altogether past his conception, he desired to know whether we had\r\nHouyhnhnms among us, and what was their employment. I told him we had\r\ngreat numbers; that in summer they grazed in the fields, and in winter\r\nwere kept in houses, with hay and oats, where _yahoo_ servants were\r\nemployed to rub their skins smooth, comb their manes, pick their feet,\r\nserve them with food, and make their beds. “I understand you well,” said\r\nmy master; “it is very plain, from all you have spoken, that whatever\r\nshare of reason the _yahoos_ pretend to, the Houyhnhnms are your masters.\r\nI heartily wish our _yahoos_ would be so tractable.” I begged his honor\r\nwould please excuse me from proceeding any farther, because I was very\r\ncertain that the account he expected from me would be highly displeasing.\r\nBut he insisted in commanding me to let him know the best and the worst.\r\nI told him he should be obeyed. I owned that the Houyhnhnms among us,\r\nwhom we called horses, were the most generous and comely animals we had;\r\nthat they excelled in strength and swiftness; and when they belonged\r\nto persons of quality, were employed in traveling, racing, or drawing\r\nchariots; they were treated with much kindness and care, till they fell\r\ninto diseases, or became foundered in the feet; and then they were sold,\r\nand used to all kind of drudgery till they died; after which their skins\r\nwere stripped, and sold for what they were worth, and their bodies left\r\nto be devoured by dogs and birds of prey. But the common race of horses\r\nhad not so good fortune, being kept by farmers and carriers and other\r\nmean people, who put them to great labor, and fed them worse. I described\r\nas well as I could, our way of riding; the shape and use of a bridle,\r\na saddle, a spur, and a whip; of harness and wheels. I added, that we\r\nfastened plates of a certain hard substance, called iron, at the bottom\r\nof their feet, to preserve their hoofs from being broken by the stony\r\nways on which we often traveled.\r\n\r\nMy master, after some expressions of great indignation, wondered how\r\nwe dared to venture upon a Houyhnhnm’s back; for he was sure, that the\r\nweakest servant in his house would be able to shake off the strongest\r\n_yahoo_; or by lying down, and rolling on his back, squeeze the brute to\r\ndeath. I answered that our horses were trained up, from three or four\r\nyears old, to the several uses we intended them for; that if any of them\r\nproved intolerably vicious, they were employed for carriages; that they\r\nwere severely beaten, while they were young, for any mischievous tricks;\r\nthat they were indeed sensible of rewards and punishments; but his honor\r\nwould please to consider, that they had not the least tincture of reason,\r\nany more than the _yahoos_ in this country.\r\n\r\nIt put me to the pains of many circumlocutions, to give my master a right\r\nidea of what I spoke; for their language does not abound in variety of\r\nwords, because their wants and passions are fewer than among us. But it\r\nis impossible to represent his noble resentment at our savage treatment\r\nof the Houyhnhnm race. He said, if it were possible there could be any\r\ncountry where _yahoos_ alone were indued with reason, they certainly\r\nmust be the governing animal; because reason in time will always prevail\r\nagainst brutal strength. But, considering the frames of our bodies,\r\nand especially of mine, he thought no creature of equal bulk was so\r\nill contrived for employing that reason in the common offices of life;\r\nwhereupon he desired to know whether those among whom I lived resembled\r\nme or the _yahoos_ of this country. I assured him that I was as well\r\nshaped as most of my age; but the younger, and the females, were much\r\nmore soft and tender, and the skins of the latter generally as white\r\nas milk. He said I differed indeed from other _yahoos_, being much more\r\ncleanly, and not altogether so deformed; but, in point of real advantage,\r\nhe thought I differed for the worse: that my nails were of no use either\r\nto my fore or hinder feet; as to my forefeet, he could not properly call\r\nthem by that name, for he never observed me to walk upon them; that\r\nthey were too soft to bear the ground; that I generally went with them\r\nuncovered; neither was the covering I sometimes wore on them of the same\r\nshape, or so strong as that on my feet behind; that I could not walk with\r\nany security, for if either of my hinder feet slipped, I must inevitably\r\nfall. He then began to find fault with other parts of my body: the\r\nflatness of my face, the prominence of my nose, my eyes placed directly\r\nin front, so that I could not look on either side without turning my\r\nhead. That I was not able to feed myself, without lifting one of my\r\nforefeet to my mouth; and therefore nature had placed those joints to\r\nanswer that necessity. He knew not what could be the use of those several\r\nclefts and divisions in my feet behind; that these were too soft to bear\r\nthe hardness and sharpness of stones without a covering made from the\r\nskin of some other brute; that my whole body wanted a fence against heat\r\nand cold, which I was forced to put on and off every day with tediousness\r\nand trouble. And lastly, that he observed every animal in this country\r\nnaturally to abhor the _yahoos_, whom the weaker avoided and the stronger\r\ndrove from them. So that, supposing us to have the gift of reason, he\r\ncould not see how it were possible to cure that natural antipathy which\r\nevery creature discovered against us; nor consequently, how we could tame\r\nand render them serviceable. However, he would, as he said, debate the\r\nmatter no farther, because he was more desirous to know my own story, the\r\ncountry where I was born, and the several actions and events of my life\r\nbefore I came hither.\r\n\r\nI assured him how extremely desirous I was that he should be satisfied\r\non every point; but I doubted much, whether it would be possible for\r\nme to explain myself on several subjects whereof his honor could have\r\nno conception; because I saw nothing in his country to which I could\r\nresemble them. That, however, I would do my best, and strive to express\r\nmyself by similitudes, humbly desiring his assistance when I wanted\r\nproper words; which he was pleased to promise me.\r\n\r\nI said my birth was of honest parents, in an island called England, which\r\nwas remote from this country, as many days’ journey as the strongest of\r\nhis honor’s servants could travel in the annual course of the sun; that\r\nI was bred a surgeon, whose trade it is to cure wounds and hurts in the\r\nbody, got by accident or violence; that my country was governed by a\r\nfemale man, called a queen; that I left it to get riches whereby I might\r\nmaintain myself and family when I should return; that in my last voyage,\r\nI was commander of the ship, and had about fifty _yahoos_ under me, many\r\nof which died at sea, and I was forced to supply them by others picked\r\nout from several nations; that our ship was twice in danger of being\r\nsunk, the first time by a great storm, and the second by striking against\r\na rock. Here my master interposed, by asking me how I could persuade\r\nstrangers out of different countries to venture with me, after the losses\r\nI had sustained, and the hazards I had run. I said they were fellows of\r\ndesperate fortunes, forced to fly from the places of their birth on\r\naccount of their poverty or their crimes. Some were undone by lawsuits;\r\nothers spent all they had in drinking and gaming; others fled for\r\ntreason; many for murder, theft, poisoning, robbery, perjury, forgery,\r\ncoining false money, for flying from their colors, or deserting to the\r\nenemy; and most of them had broken prison; none of these durst return to\r\ntheir native countries, for fear of being hanged, or of starving in a\r\njail; and therefore were under the necessity of seeking a livelihood in\r\nother places.\r\n\r\nDuring this discourse my master was pleased to interrupt me several\r\ntimes. I had made use of many circumlocutions in describing to him the\r\nnature of several crimes for which most of our crew had been forced to\r\nfly their country. This labor took up several days’ conversation before\r\nhe was able to comprehend me. He was wholly at a loss to know what could\r\nbe the use or necessity of practicing those vices. To clear up which I\r\nendeavored to give him some idea of the desire of power and riches; of\r\nthe terrible effects of lust, intemperance, malice, and envy. All this\r\nI was forced to define and describe by putting of cases and making of\r\nsuppositions. After which, like one whose imagination was struck with\r\nsomething never seen or heard of before, he would lift up his eyes with\r\namazement and indignation. Power, government, war, law, punishment, and\r\na thousand other things had no terms wherein that language could express\r\nthem; which made the difficulty almost insuperable to give my master any\r\nconception of what I meant. But, being of an excellent understanding,\r\nmuch improved by contemplation and converse, he at last arrived at a\r\ncompetent knowledge of what human nature, in our parts of the world, is\r\ncapable to perform, and desired I would give him some particular account\r\nof that land which we call Europe, but especially of my own country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n    THE AUTHOR AT HIS MASTER’S COMMAND, INFORMS HIM OF THE STATE\r\n    OF ENGLAND—THE CAUSES OF WAR AMONG THE PRINCES OF EUROPE—THE\r\n    AUTHOR BEGINS TO EXPLAIN THE ENGLISH CONSTITUTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader may please to observe that the following extract of many of\r\nthe conversations I had with my master, contains a summary of the most\r\nmaterial points, which were discoursed at several times for above two\r\nyears; his honor often desiring fuller satisfaction as I farther improved\r\nin the Houyhnhnm tongue. I laid before him, as well as I could, the\r\nwhole state of Europe; I discoursed of trade and manufactures, of arts\r\nand sciences; and the answers I gave to all the questions he made, as\r\nthey arose upon several subjects, were a fund of conversation not to be\r\nexhausted. But I shall here only set down the substance of what passed\r\nbetween us concerning my own country, reducing it into order as well as I\r\ncan, without any regard to time or other circumstances, while I strictly\r\nadhere to truth. My only concern is, that I shall hardly be able to do\r\njustice to my master’s arguments and expressions, which must needs suffer\r\nby my want of capacity, as well as by a translation into our barbarous\r\nEnglish.\r\n\r\nIn obedience, therefore, to his honor’s commands, I related to him the\r\nrevolution under the Prince of Orange, the long war with France entered\r\ninto by the said prince, and renewed by his successor, the present queen;\r\nwherein the greatest powers of Christendom were engaged, and which still\r\ncontinued. I computed, at his request, that about a million of _yahoos_\r\nmight have been killed in the whole progress of it; and perhaps a hundred\r\nor more cities taken, and thrice as many ships burnt or sunk.\r\n\r\nHe asked me what were the usual causes or motives that made one country\r\ngo to war with another. I answered, they were innumerable; but I should\r\nonly mention a few of the chief. Sometimes the ambition of princes,\r\nwho never think they have land or people enough to govern; sometimes\r\nthe corruption of ministers, who engage their master in a war in order\r\nto stifle or divert the clamor of the subjects against their evil\r\nadministration. Difference in opinions has cost many millions of lives:\r\nfor instance, whether flesh be bread, or bread be flesh; whether the\r\njuice of a certain berry be blood or wine; whether whistling be a vice or\r\nvirtue; whether it be better to kiss a post or throw it into the fire;\r\nwhat is the best color for a coat, whether black, white, red, or gray,\r\nand whether it should be long or short, narrow or wide, dirty or clean,\r\nwith many more. Neither are any wars so furious and bloody, or of so long\r\ncontinuance, as those occasioned by difference in opinion, especially if\r\nit be in things indifferent.\r\n\r\nSometimes the quarrel between two princes is to decide which of them\r\nshall dispossess a third of his dominions, where neither of them pretend\r\nto any right. Sometimes one prince quarrels with another, for fear the\r\nother should quarrel with him. Sometimes a war is entered upon, because\r\nthe enemy is too strong, and sometimes because he is too weak. Sometimes\r\nour neighbors want the things which we have, or have the things which we\r\nwant, and we both fight, till they take ours, or give us theirs. It is\r\na very justifiable cause of war to invade a country after the people\r\nhave been wasted by famine, destroyed by pestilence, or embroiled by\r\nfactions among themselves. It is justifiable to enter into war against\r\nour nearest ally, when one of his towns lies convenient for us, or a\r\nterritory of land that would render our dominions round and complete.\r\nIf a prince sends forces into a nation where the people are poor and\r\nignorant, he may lawfully put half of them to death, and make slaves of\r\nthe rest, in order to civilize and reduce them from their barbarous way\r\nof living. It is a very kingly, honorable, and frequent practice, when\r\none prince desires the assistance of another to secure him against an\r\ninvasion, that the assistant, when he has driven out the invader, should\r\nseize on the dominions himself, and kill, imprison, or banish the prince\r\nhe came to relieve. Alliance by blood or marriage, is a frequent cause of\r\nwar between princes; and the nearer the kindred is, the greater is their\r\ndisposition to quarrel. Poor nations are hungry, and rich nations are\r\nproud, and pride and hunger will ever be at variance. For these reasons,\r\nthe trade of a soldier is held the most honorable of all others; because\r\na soldier is a _yahoo_ hired to kill in cold blood as many of his own\r\nspecies, who have never offended him, as possibly he can.\r\n\r\nThere is likewise a kind of princes in Europe, not able to make war by\r\nthemselves, who hire out their troops to richer nations, for so much a\r\nday to each man; of which they keep three-fourths to themselves, and it\r\nis the best part of their maintenance; such are those in many northern\r\nparts of Europe.\r\n\r\n“What you have told me,” said my master, “upon the subject of war, does\r\nindeed discover most admirably the effects of that reason you pretend\r\nto: however, it is happy that the shame is greater than the danger; and\r\nthat nature has left you utterly incapable of doing much mischief. For\r\nyour mouths lying flat with your faces, you can hardly bite each other\r\nto any purpose, unless by consent. Then as to the claws upon your feet\r\nbefore and behind, they are so short and tender, that one of our _yahoos_\r\nwould drive a dozen of yours before him. And therefore in recounting the\r\nnumbers of those who have been killed in battle, I cannot but think you\r\nhave said the thing which is not.”\r\n\r\nI could not forbear shaking my head and smiling a little at his\r\nignorance. And being no stranger to the art of war, I gave him a\r\ndescription of cannons, culverins, muskets, carabines, pistols, bullets,\r\npowder, swords, bayonets, sieges, retreats, attacks, undermines,\r\ncountermines, bombardments, sea fights; ships sunk with a thousand men,\r\ntwenty thousand killed on each side; dying groans, limbs flying in the\r\nair, smoke, noise, confusion, trampling to death under horses’ feet;\r\nflight, pursuit, victory; fields strewed with carcasses, left for food to\r\ndogs, and wolves, and birds of prey; plundering, stripping, ravishing,\r\nburning, and destroying. And, to set forth the valor of my own dear\r\ncountrymen, I assured him that I had seen them blow up a hundred enemies\r\nat once in a siege, and as many in a ship, and beheld the dead bodies\r\ndrop down in pieces from the clouds, to the great diversion of the\r\nspectators.\r\n\r\nI was going on to more particulars, when my master commanded me silence.\r\nHe said, whoever understood the nature of _yahoos_ might easily believe\r\nit possible for so vile an animal to be capable of every action I had\r\nnamed, if their strength and cunning equaled their malice. But as my\r\ndiscourse had increased his abhorrence of the whole species, so he\r\nfound it gave him a disturbance in his mind, to which he was wholly\r\na stranger before. He thought his ears being used to such abominable\r\nwords, might by degrees admit them with less detestation. That although\r\nhe hated the _yahoos_ of this country, yet he no more blamed them for\r\ntheir odious qualities than he did a _gnnayh_ (a bird of prey) for its\r\ncruelty, or a sharp stone for cutting his hoof. But when a creature\r\npretending to reason could be capable of such enormities, he dreaded lest\r\nthe corruption of that faculty might be worse than brutality itself.\r\nHe seemed therefore confident, that instead of reason, we were only\r\npossessed of some quality fitted to increase our natural vices; as the\r\nreflection from a troubled stream returns the image of an ill-shapen\r\nbody, not only larger, but more distorted.\r\n\r\nHe added that he had heard too much upon the subject of war, both\r\nin this and some former discourses. There was another point which a\r\nlittle perplexed him at present. I had informed him that some of our\r\ncrew left their country on account of being ruined by law; that I had\r\nalready explained the meaning of the word; but he was at a loss how\r\nit should come to pass, that the law, which was intended for every\r\nman’s preservation, should be any man’s ruin. Therefore he desired to\r\nbe farther satisfied what I meant by law, and what sort of dispensers\r\nthey could be by whose practices the property of any person could be\r\nlost instead of preserved. He added that he saw no occasion for this\r\nthing called law, as all its intents and purposes might be answered by\r\nfollowing the dictates of nature and reason, which were sufficient guides\r\nfor a reasonable animal, as we pretended to be, in showing us what we\r\nought to do, and what to avoid.\r\n\r\nI assured his honor that law was a science in which I was little\r\nconversant, having only such knowledge of it as I had obtained by\r\nemploying advocates, in vain, upon some injustices that had been done me,\r\nand by conversing with others who by the same method had first lost their\r\nsubstance and then left their country under the mortification of such\r\ndisappointments. However, I would give him all the satisfaction I was\r\nable.\r\n\r\nI said that those who professed this science were exceedingly numerous,\r\nbeing almost equal to the caterpillars in number; they were of diverse\r\ndegrees, distinctions, and denominations. Their number was such that\r\nthe fair and justifiable advantage and income of the profession was not\r\nsufficient for the decent and handsome maintenance of multitudes who\r\nfollowed it. The result was that it was found needful to supply that\r\nby artifice and cunning which could not be procured by just and honest\r\nmethods; the better to bring which about, there was among us a society of\r\nmen bred from their youth in the art of proving, by words multiplied for\r\nthe purpose, that white is black, and black is white, according as they\r\nare paid. The greatness of the assurance of these men, and the boldness\r\nof their pretensions, gained the adherence of the mass of the people,\r\nof whom in a manner they made slaves, and got into their hands much the\r\nlargest share of the practice of their profession. These practitioners\r\nwere by men of discernment called pettifoggers (that is, confounders,\r\nor rather, destroyers of right), and it was my ill luck as well as the\r\nmisfortune of my acquaintances, to have been at the mercy of this species\r\nof the profession. I desired his honor to understand the description I\r\nhad to give, and the ruin I had complained of, related to these sectaries\r\nonly, and the means by which the misfortunes we met had been brought upon\r\nus by these men might be more easily conceived by explaining to him their\r\nmethod of proceeding, which could not better be done than by giving him\r\nan example.\r\n\r\nI will suppose that my neighbor has a mind to my cow; he hires one of\r\nthese advocates to prove that he ought to have my cow from me. I must\r\nthen hire another to defend my right, it being against all rules of law\r\nthat any man shall be allowed to speak for himself. Now, in this case,\r\nI who am the right owner, lie under two great disadvantages. First, my\r\nadvocate, being practiced almost from the cradle in defending falsehood,\r\nis quite out of his element when he would argue for right, which, being\r\nunnatural to him, he attempts with great awkwardness, if not with ill\r\nwill. The second disadvantage is that my advocate must proceed with great\r\ncaution, for since the maintenance of so many depends on the practice of\r\nlaw not being lessened by too summary proceedings, even should he fail to\r\nincur the displeasure of the judges he is sure to gain the ill will and\r\nhatred of his brethren. This being the case, I have but two methods to\r\npreserve my cow. The first is to gain over my adversary’s advocate with\r\na double fee, his education being such that it is reasonable to expect\r\nhe can be induced to betray his client and let the balance fall on my\r\nside. The second way is for my advocate to refrain from insisting on the\r\njustice of my cause, by allowing the cow to belong to my adversary;\r\nand this, if it be skillfully done, will go a long way toward obtaining\r\na favorable verdict, it having been found by careful observation of\r\nissues and events, that under the management of such practitioners,\r\nthe wrong side has the fairer chance of success, more especially if it\r\nshould happen, as it did in my own and my friend’s case, that the person\r\nappointed to decide all controversies concerning property as well as\r\nto try criminals, who should be chosen from among the most learned and\r\nwise of his profession, is by the recommendation of a great favorite or\r\ncourt mistress taken from the sect before mentioned, and so having been\r\nstrongly biased all his life against equity and fair dealing, lies, as it\r\nwere, under a fatal necessity of favoring, double dealing and oppression,\r\nand besides, through age, infirmity, and distemper having become lazy and\r\ninattentive, he is almost incapacitated from doing anything becoming the\r\nduty of his office. The decisions of men so bred and qualified may with\r\nreason be expected to be on the wrong side of the cause, for it is little\r\nwonder that those who can take harangue and noise (if pursued with warmth\r\nand drawn out to great length) for reasoning, will infer the weight of\r\nthe argument from the heaviness of the pleading.\r\n\r\nIt is a maxim among these men that whatever has been done before may\r\nlegally be done again, and therefore they take special care to record\r\nall the decisions formerly made, even those which have through ignorance\r\nor corruption contradicted the rules of common justice. These, under the\r\nname of precedents, they produce as authorities, and thereby endeavor\r\nto justify the most iniquitous opinions; and they are so lucky in this\r\npractice that they rarely fail to secure decrees according to their\r\nexpectation.\r\n\r\nIn pleading, they studiously avoid entering into the merits of the cause;\r\nbut are loud, violent, and tedious in dwelling upon all circumstances\r\nwhich are not to the purpose. For instance, in the case already\r\nmentioned, they never desire to know what claim or title my adversary has\r\nto my cow; but whether the said cow were red or black; her horns long or\r\nshort; whether the field I grazed her in be round or square; whether she\r\nwas milked at home or abroad; what diseases she is subject to, and the\r\nlike; after which they consult precedents, adjourn the cause from time to\r\ntime, and in ten, twenty, or thirty years come to an issue.\r\n\r\nIt is likewise to be observed, that this society has a peculiar cant and\r\njargon of their own, that no other mortal can understand, and wherein all\r\ntheir laws are written, which they take special care to multiply; whereby\r\nthey have gone near to confound the very essence of truth and falsehood,\r\nof right and wrong; so that it may take thirty years to decide whether\r\nthe field, left me by my ancestors for six generations, belongs to me or\r\nto a stranger three hundred miles off.\r\n\r\nIn the trial of persons accused for crimes against the state, the method\r\nis much more short and commendable: for if those in power, who know well\r\nhow to select instruments fit to carry out their purpose, are careful to\r\nrecommend a proper person, his course of education and method of practice\r\nmake it easy for him, when his patron’s disposition is understood,\r\nwithout difficulty either to condemn or acquit the criminal and at the\r\nsame time strictly preserve all due forms of law.\r\n\r\nHere my master interposing said it was a pity that creatures endowed with\r\nsuch prodigious abilities of mind as these advocates by the description\r\nof them must certainly be, were not rather encouraged to be instructors\r\nof others in wisdom and knowledge. In answer to which I assured his honor\r\nthat the business and study of their own profession so took up all their\r\nthoughts and time, that they attended to nothing else, and therefore\r\nin all points out of their own trade many of them were so ignorant\r\nand stupid that it would be difficult to pick out of any profession a\r\ngeneration of men more despicable in common conversation or so much\r\nlooked upon as avowed enemies of all knowledge and learning, and equally\r\ndisposed to pervert the general reasons of mankind in every other subject\r\nof discourse, as in that of their own calling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n    A CONTINUATION OF THE STATE OF ENGLAND UNDER QUEEN ANNE—THE\r\n    CHARACTER OF A FIRST MINISTER OF STATE IN SOME EUROPEAN COURTS.\r\n\r\n\r\nMy master was yet wholly at a loss to understand what motives could\r\nincite this race of lawyers to perplex, disquiet, and weary themselves,\r\nand engage in a confederacy of injustice, merely for the sake of injuring\r\ntheir fellow animals; neither could he comprehend what I meant in saying\r\nthey did it for hire. Whereupon I was at much pains to describe to him\r\nthe use of money, the materials it was made of, and the value of the\r\nmetals; that when a _yahoo_ had got a great store of this precious\r\nsubstance, he was able to purchase whatever he had a mind to, the finest\r\nclothing, the noblest houses, great tracts of land, the most costly meats\r\nand drinks, and have his choice of the most beautiful females. Therefore\r\nsince money alone was able to perform all these feats, our _yahoos_\r\nthought they could never have enough of it to spend or save, as they\r\nfound themselves inclined from their natural bent either to profusion or\r\navarice. That the rich man enjoyed the fruit of the poor man’s labor, and\r\nthe latter were a thousand to one in proportion to the former. That the\r\nbulk of our people were forced to live miserably, by laboring every day\r\nfor small wages to make a few live plentifully. I enlarged myself much\r\non these and many other particulars to the same purpose. But his honor\r\nwas still to seek; for he went upon a supposition that all animals had\r\na title to their share in the productions of the earth, and especially\r\nthose who presided over the rest. Therefore he desired I would let him\r\nknow what these costly meats were, and how any of us happened to want\r\nthem. Whereupon I enumerated as many sorts as came into my head, with\r\nthe various methods of dressing them, which could not be done without\r\nsending vessels by sea to every part of the world, as well for liquors to\r\ndrink as for sauces, and innumerable other conveniencies. I assured him\r\nthat this whole globe of earth must be at least three times gone round,\r\nbefore one of our better female _yahoos_ could get her breakfast, or a\r\ncup to put it in. He said that must needs be a miserable country which\r\ncannot furnish food for its own inhabitants. But what he chiefly wondered\r\nat was how such vast tracts of ground as I described should be wholly\r\nwithout fresh water, and the people put to the necessity of sending over\r\nthe sea for drink. I replied that England (the dear place of my nativity)\r\nwas computed to produce three times the quantity of food more than its\r\ninhabitants are able to consume, as well as liquors extracted from grain,\r\nor pressed out of the fruit of certain trees, which made excellent drink;\r\nand the same proportion in every other convenience of life. But, in order\r\nto feed the luxury and intemperance of the males, and the vanity of the\r\nfemales, we sent away the greatest part of our necessary things to other\r\ncountries, whence in return we brought the materials of diseases, folly,\r\nand vice, to spend among ourselves. Hence it follows of necessity, that\r\nvast numbers of our people are compelled to seek their livelihood by\r\nbegging, robbing, stealing, cheating, flattering, suborning, forswearing,\r\nforging, gaming, lying, fawning, hectoring, voting, scribbling,\r\nstar-gazing, poisoning, canting, libeling, free-thinking, and the like\r\noccupations; every one of which terms I was at much pains to make him\r\nunderstand.\r\n\r\nThat wine was not imported among us from foreign countries to supply the\r\nwant of water or other drinks, but because it was a sort of liquid which\r\nmade us merry by putting us out of our senses; diverted all melancholy\r\nthoughts, begat wild extravagant imaginations in the brain, raised our\r\nhopes and banished our fears, suspended every office of reason for a time\r\nand deprived us of the use of our limbs till we fell into a profound\r\nsleep; although it must be confessed that we always awaked sick and\r\ndispirited, and that the use of this liquor filled us with diseases which\r\nmade our lives uncomfortable and short.\r\n\r\nBut beside all this, the bulk of our people supported themselves by\r\nfurnishing the necessities or conveniencies of life to the rich and to\r\neach other. For instance, when I am at home, and dressed as I ought\r\nto be, I carry on my body the workmanship of a hundred tradesmen; the\r\nbuilding and furniture of my house employ as many more, and five times\r\nthe number to adorn my wife.\r\n\r\nI was going on to tell him of another sort of people, who get their\r\nlivelihood by attending the sick, having upon some occasions informed\r\nhis honor that many of my crew had died of diseases. But it was with\r\nthe utmost difficulty that I brought him to apprehend what I meant. He\r\ncould easily conceive that a Houyhnhnm grew weak and heavy a few days\r\nbefore his death, or by some accident might hurt a limb; but that Nature,\r\nwho works all things to perfection, should suffer any pains to breed in\r\nour bodies he thought it impossible, and desired to know the reason of\r\nso unaccountable an evil. I told him that we fed on a thousand things\r\nwhich operated contrary to each other; that we ate when we were not\r\nhungry, and drank without the provocation of thirst; that we sat whole\r\nnights drinking strong liquors, without eating a bit, which disposed us\r\nto sloth, inflamed our bodies, and precipitated or prevented digestion.\r\nThat it would be endless to give him a catalogue of all diseases incident\r\nto human bodies, for they would not be fewer than five or six hundred,\r\nspread over every limb and joint—in short, every part, external and\r\nintestine, having diseases appropriated to them. To remedy which, there\r\nwas a sort of people bred up among us in the profession, or pretense, of\r\ncuring the sick. And because I had some skill in the faculty, I would,\r\nin gratitude to his honor, let him know the whole mystery and method by\r\nwhich they proceed.\r\n\r\nTheir fundamental is, that all diseases arise from repletion; whence\r\nthey conclude, that a great evacuation of the body is necessary, either\r\nthrough the natural passage, or upwards at the mouth. Their next business\r\nis, from herbs, minerals, gums, oils, shells, salts, juices, seaweed,\r\nbarks of trees, serpents, toads, frogs, spiders, dead men’s flesh and\r\nbones, beasts, and fishes, to form a composition for smell and taste the\r\nmost abominable, nauseous, and detestable they can possibly contrive,\r\nwhich the stomach immediately rejects with loathing, and this they call\r\na vomit; or else, from the same storehouse, with some other poisonous\r\nadditions, they command us to take in a medicine equally annoying and\r\ndisgustful to the bowels, which relaxing the belly, drives down all\r\nbefore it, and this they call a purge, or a clyster.\r\n\r\nBut besides real diseases, we are subject to many that are only\r\nimaginary, for which the physicians have invented imaginary cures; these\r\nhave their several names, and so have the drugs that are proper for\r\nthem, and with these our female _yahoos_ are always infested.\r\n\r\nOne great excellency in this tribe is their skill at prognostics, wherein\r\nthey seldom fail; their predictions in real diseases, when they rise to\r\nany degree of malignity, generally portending death, which is always in\r\ntheir power, when recovery is not. And therefore, upon any unexpected\r\nsigns of amendment, after they have pronounced their sentence, rather\r\nthan be accused as false prophets, they know how to approve their\r\nsagacity to the world by a seasonable dose.\r\n\r\nThey are likewise of special use to husbands and wives who are grown\r\nweary of their mates, to eldest sons, to great ministers of state, and\r\noften to princes.\r\n\r\nI had formerly, upon occasion, discoursed with my master upon the nature\r\nof government in general, particularly of our own excellent constitution,\r\ndeservedly the wonder and envy of the whole world. But having here\r\naccidentally mentioned a minister of state, he commanded me some time\r\nafter to inform him what species of _yahoo_ I particularly meant by that\r\nappellation.\r\n\r\nI told him that our first or chief minister of state was a person wholly\r\nexempt from joy and grief, love and hatred, pity and anger; at least\r\nmakes use of no other passions but a violent desire of wealth, power, and\r\ntitles. That he applies his words to all uses except to the indication of\r\nhis mind; that he never tells a truth but with an intent that you should\r\ntake it for a lie; nor a lie but with a design that you should take it\r\nfor a truth. That those he speaks worst of behind their backs are in the\r\nsurest way of preferment; and whenever he begins to praise you to others\r\nor to yourself, you are from that day forlorn. The worst mark you can\r\nreceive is a promise, especially when it is confirmed with an oath; after\r\nwhich every wise man retires, and gives over all hopes.\r\n\r\nThere are three methods by which a man may rise to be chief minister.\r\nThe first is, by knowing how, with prudence, to dispose of a wife, a\r\ndaughter, or a sister; the second, by betraying or undermining his\r\npredecessor; and the third is by a furious zeal in public assemblies\r\nagainst the corruptions of the court. But a wise prince would rather\r\nchoose to employ those who practice the last of these methods; because\r\nsuch zealots prove always the most obsequious and subservient to the\r\nwill and passions of their master. That these ministers, having all\r\nemployments at their disposal, preserve themselves in power by bribing\r\nthe majority of a senate or great council; and at last, by an act\r\nof indemnity (whereof I described the nature to him), they secured\r\nthemselves from after reckonings, and retired from the public laden with\r\nthe spoils of the nation.\r\n\r\nThe palace of a chief minister is a seminary to breed up others in his\r\nown trade; the pages, lackeys, and porter, by imitating their master,\r\nbecome ministers of state in their several districts, and learn to excel\r\nin the three principal ingredients, of insolence, lying, and bribery.\r\nAccordingly, they have a subaltern court paid to them by persons of the\r\nbest rank, and sometimes by the force of dexterity and impudence, arrive,\r\nthrough several gradations, to be successors to their lord.\r\n\r\nHe is usually governed by a decayed wench or favorite footman, who are\r\nthe tunnels through which all graces are conveyed, and may properly be\r\ncalled, in the last resort, the governors of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nOne day in discourse, my master, having heard me mention the nobility of\r\nmy country, was pleased to make me a compliment which I could not pretend\r\nto deserve: that he was sure I must have been born of some noble family,\r\nbecause I far exceeded in shape, color, and cleanliness, all the _yahoos_\r\nof his nation, although I seemed to fail in strength and agility, which\r\nmust be imputed to my different way of living from those other brutes;\r\nand besides, I was not only endowed with the faculty of speech, but\r\nlikewise with some rudiments of reason, to a degree that with all his\r\nacquaintance I passed for a prodigy.\r\n\r\nHe made me observe, that among the Houyhnhnms, the white, the sorrel, and\r\nthe iron-gray were not so exactly shaped as the bay, the dapple-gray,\r\nand the black; nor born with equal talents of the mind, or a capacity\r\nto improve them; and therefore continued always in the condition of\r\nservants, without ever aspiring to match out of their own race, which in\r\nthat country would be reckoned monstrous and unnatural.\r\n\r\nI made his honor my most humble acknowledgments for the good opinion he\r\nwas pleased to conceive of me; but assured him at the same time, that my\r\nbirth was of the lower sort, having been born of plain honest parents,\r\nwho were just able to give me a tolerable education. That nobility, among\r\nus, was altogether a different thing from the idea he had of it; that\r\nour young noblemen are bred from their childhood in idleness and luxury;\r\nand when their fortunes are almost ruined, they marry some woman of mean\r\nbirth, disagreeable person, and unsound constitution (merely for the\r\nsake of money), whom they hate and despise. That the productions of such\r\nmarriages are generally scrofulous, rickety, or deformed children; by\r\nwhich means the family seldom continues above three generations. That a\r\nweak diseased body, a meager countenance, and sallow complexion, are no\r\nuncommon marks of a great man; and a healthy robust appearance is so far\r\ndisgraceful in a man of quality, that the world is apt to conclude his\r\nreal father to have been one of the inferiors of the family, especially\r\nwhen it is seen that the imperfections of his mind run parallel with\r\nthose of his body, and are little else than a composition of spleen,\r\ndullness, ignorance, caprice, sensuality and pride.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n    THE AUTHOR’S GREAT LOVE OF HIS NATIVE COUNTRY—HIS MASTER’S\r\n    OBSERVATIONS UPON THE CONSTITUTION AND ADMINISTRATION OF\r\n    ENGLAND, AS DESCRIBED BY THE AUTHOR, WITH PARALLEL CASES AND\r\n    COMPARISONS—HIS MASTER’S OBSERVATIONS UPON HUMAN NATURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe reader may be disposed to wonder how I could prevail on myself to\r\ngive so free a representation of my own species, among a race of mortals\r\nwho were already too apt to conceive the vilest opinion of human kind,\r\nfrom that entire congruity betwixt me and their _yahoos_. But I must\r\nfreely confess, that the many virtues of these excellent quadrupeds\r\nplaced in opposite view to human corruptions, had so far opened my eyes\r\nand enlarged my understanding, that I began to view the actions and\r\npassions of man in a very different light, and to think the honor of my\r\nown kind not worth managing; which, besides, it was impossible for me\r\nto do before a person of so acute a judgment as my master, who daily\r\nconvinced me of a thousand faults in myself, whereof I had not the least\r\nperception before, and which among us would never be numbered even among\r\nhuman infirmities. I had likewise learned from his example an utter\r\ndetestation of all falsehood or disguise; and truth appeared so amiable\r\nto me, that I determined upon sacrificing everything to it.\r\n\r\nLet me deal so candidly with the reader as to confess that there was yet\r\na much stronger motive for the freedom I took in my representation of\r\nthings. I had not been a year in this country before I contracted such\r\na love and veneration for the inhabitants, that I entered on a firm\r\nresolution never to return to human kind, but to pass the rest of my life\r\namong these admirable Houyhnhnms, in the contemplation and practice of\r\nevery virtue; where I could have no example or incitement to vice. But\r\nit was decreed by fortune, my perpetual enemy, that so great a felicity\r\nshould not fall to my share. However, it is now some comfort to reflect,\r\nthat in what I said of my countrymen, I extenuated their faults as much\r\nas I durst before so strict an examiner, and upon every article gave as\r\nfavorable a turn as the matter would bear. For, indeed, who is there\r\nalive that will not be swayed by his bias and partiality to the place of\r\nhis birth?\r\n\r\nI have related the substance of several conversations I had with my\r\nmaster, during the greatest part of the time I had the honor to be in his\r\nservice; but have, indeed, for brevity’s sake, omitted much more than is\r\nhere set down.\r\n\r\nWhen I had answered all his questions, and his curiosity seemed to be\r\nfully satisfied, he sent for me one morning early, and commanding me to\r\nsit down at some distance (an honor which he had never before conferred\r\nupon me), he said he had been very seriously considering my whole story,\r\nas far as it related both to myself and to my country. That he looked\r\nupon us as a sort of animals to whose share, by what accident he could\r\nnot conjecture, some small pittance of reason had fallen, whereof we made\r\nno other use than by its assistance to aggravate our natural corruptions,\r\nand to acquire new ones which Nature had not given us. That we disarmed\r\nourselves of the few abilities she had bestowed; had been very successful\r\nin multiplying our original wants, and seemed to spend our whole lives in\r\nvain endeavors to supply them by our own inventions. That as to myself,\r\nit was manifest I had neither the strength nor agility of a common yahoo,\r\nthat I walked infirmly on my hinder feet; had found out a contrivance to\r\nmake my claws of no use, or defense, and to remove the hair from my chin,\r\nwhich was intended as a shelter from the sun and the weather. Lastly,\r\nthat I could neither run with speed, nor climb trees like my brethren, as\r\nhe called them, the _yahoos_ in this country.\r\n\r\nThat our institutions of government and law were plainly owing to our\r\ngross defects in reason, and by consequence, in virtue; because reason\r\nalone is sufficient to govern a rational creature; which was therefore a\r\ncharacter we had no pretense to challenge, even from the account I had\r\ngiven of my own people; although he manifestly perceived, that in order\r\nto favor them, I had concealed many particulars, and often said the thing\r\nwhich was not.\r\n\r\nHe was the more confirmed in this opinion, because he observed, that as I\r\nagreed in every feature of my body with other _yahoos_, except where it\r\nwas to my real disadvantage in point of strength, speed, and activity,\r\nthe shortness of my claws, and some particulars where nature had no part;\r\nso from the representation I had given him of our lives, our manners,\r\nand our actions, he found as near a resemblance in the disposition of\r\nour minds. He said the _yahoos_ were known to hate one another more\r\nthan they did any different species of animals; and the reason usually\r\nassigned, was the odiousness of their own shapes, which all could see in\r\nthe rest, but not in themselves. He had therefore begun to think it not\r\nunwise in us to cover our bodies, and by that invention conceal many of\r\nour deformities from each other, which would else be hardly supportable.\r\nBut he now found he had been mistaken, and that the dissensions of these\r\nbrutes in his country were owing to the same cause with ours, as I had\r\ndescribed them. “For if,” said he, “you throw among five _yahoos_ as\r\nmuch food as would be sufficient for fifty, they will, instead of eating\r\npeaceably, fall together by the ears, each single one impatient to have\r\nall to itself; and therefore a servant was usually employed to stand\r\nby while they were feeding abroad, and those kept at home were tied\r\nat a distance from each other; that if a cow died of age or accident,\r\nbefore a Houyhnhnm could secure it for his own _yahoos_, those in the\r\nneighborhood would come in herds to seize it, and then would insue such\r\na battle as I had described, with terrible wounds made by their claws\r\non both sides, although they seldom were able to kill one another, for\r\nwant of such convenient instruments of death as we had invented. At other\r\ntimes the like battles have been fought between the _yahoos_ of several\r\nneighborhoods, without any visible cause; those of one district watching\r\nall opportunities to surprise the next before they are prepared. But if\r\nthey find their project has miscarried, they return home, and for want of\r\nenemies, engage in what I call a civil war among themselves.”\r\n\r\nThat in some fields of his country, there are certain shining stones of\r\nseveral colors, whereof the _yahoos_ are violently fond; and when part\r\nof these stones is fixed in the earth, as it sometimes happens, they\r\nwill dig with their claws for whole days to get them out, then carry\r\nthem away and hide them by heaps in their kennels; but still looking\r\nround with great caution, for fear their comrades should find out their\r\ntreasure. My master said he could never discover the reason of this\r\nunnatural appetite, or how these stones could be of any use to a _yahoo_;\r\nbut now he believed it might proceed from the same principle of avarice\r\nwhich I had ascribed to mankind. That he had once, by way of experiment,\r\nprivately removed a heap of these stones from the place where one of\r\nhis _yahoos_ had buried it; whereupon the sordid animal, missing his\r\ntreasure, by his loud lamenting brought the whole herd to the place,\r\nthere miserably howled, then fell to biting and tearing the rest; began\r\nto pine away; would neither eat, nor sleep, nor work, till he ordered a\r\nservant privately to convey the stones into the same hole, and hide them\r\nas before; which when his _yahoo_ had found, he presently recovered his\r\nspirits and good humor, but took good care to remove them to a better\r\nhiding place, and has ever since been a very serviceable brute.\r\n\r\nMy master farther assured me, which I also observed myself, that in the\r\nfields where these shining stones abound, the fiercest and most frequent\r\nbattles are fought, occasioned by perpetual inroads of the neighboring\r\n_yahoos_.\r\n\r\nHe said it was common when two _yahoos_ discovered such a stone in a\r\nfield, and were contending which of them should be the proprietor, a\r\nthird would take the advantage and carry it away from them both; which\r\nmy master would needs contend to have some kind of resemblance with our\r\nsuits at law; wherein I thought it for our credit not to undeceive him;\r\nsince the decision he mentioned was much more equitable than many decrees\r\namong us; because the plaintiff and defendant there lost nothing beside\r\nthe stone they contended for; whereas our courts of equity would never\r\nhave dismissed the cause while either of them had anything left.\r\n\r\nMy master continuing his discourse, said there was nothing that rendered\r\nthe _yahoos_ more odious than their undistinguishing appetite to devour\r\neverything that came in their way, whether herbs, roots, berries, the\r\ncorrupted flesh of animals, or all mingled together; and it was peculiar\r\nin their temper, that they were fonder of what they could get by rapine\r\nor stealth at a greater distance, than much better food provided for them\r\nat home.\r\n\r\nThere was also another kind of root, very juicy, but somewhat rare and\r\ndifficult to be found, which the _yahoos_ sought for with much eagerness,\r\nand would suck it with great delight; and it produced in them the same\r\neffects that wine has upon us. It would make them sometimes hug and\r\nsometimes tear one another; they would howl, and grin, and chatter, and\r\nreel, and tumble, and then fall asleep in the mud.\r\n\r\nI did indeed observe that the _yahoos_ were the only animals in the\r\ncountry subject to any diseases; which, however, were much fewer than\r\nhorses have among us, and contracted not by any ill treatment they\r\nmeet with, but by the nastiness and greediness of that sordid brute.\r\nNeither has their language any more than a general appellation for those\r\nmaladies, which is borrowed from the name of the beast, and called _hnea\r\nyahoo_, or the _yahoo’s_ evil.\r\n\r\nAs to learning, government, arts, manufactures, and the like, my master\r\nconfessed he could find little or no resemblance between the _yahoos_ of\r\nthat country and those in ours. For he only meant to observe what parity\r\nthere was in our natures. He had heard, indeed, some curious Houyhnhnms\r\nobserve, that in most herds there was a sort of ruling _yahoo_ (as among\r\nus there is generally some leading or principal stag in a park), who was\r\nalways more deformed in body and mischievous in disposition than any of\r\nthe rest. That this leader had usually a favorite as like himself as he\r\ncould get. This favorite is hated by the whole herd, and therefore, to\r\nprotect himself, keeps always near the person of his leader. He usually\r\ncontinues in office till a worse can be found; but the very moment he\r\nis discarded, his successor, at the head of all the _yahoos_ in that\r\ndistrict, young and old, male and female, come in a body, and attack him.\r\nBut how far this might be applicable to our courts, and favorites, and\r\nministers of state, my master said I could best determine.\r\n\r\nI durst make no return to this malicious insinuation, which debased human\r\nunderstanding below the sagacity of a common hound, who has judgment\r\nenough to distinguish and follow the cry of the ablest dog in the pack,\r\nwithout being ever mistaken.\r\n\r\nMy master told me that a thing he wondered at in the _yahoos_, was their\r\nstrange disposition to nastiness and dirt, whereas there appears to be a\r\nnatural love of cleanliness in all other animals. As to the two former\r\naccusations, I was glad to let them pass without any reply, because I had\r\nnot a word to offer upon them in defense of my species, which otherwise\r\nI certainly had done from my own inclinations. But I could have easily\r\nvindicated human kind from the imputation of singularity upon the last\r\narticle, if there had been any swine in that country (as unluckily\r\nfor me there were not), which although it may be a sweeter quadruped\r\nthan a _yahoo_, cannot, I humbly conceive, in justice, pretend to more\r\ncleanliness; and so his honor himself must have owned, if he had seen\r\ntheir filthy way of feeding, and their custom of wallowing and sleeping\r\nin the mud.\r\n\r\nMy master likewise mentioned another quality which his servants had\r\ndiscovered in several _yahoos_, and to him was wholly unaccountable.\r\nHe said a fancy would sometimes take a _yahoo_ to retire to a corner,\r\nto lie down and howl and groan, and spurn away all that came near him,\r\nalthough he were young and fat, wanted neither food nor water; nor did\r\nthe servants imagine what could possibly ail him. And the only remedy\r\nthey found was to set him to hard work, after which he would infallibly\r\ncome to himself. To this I was silent out of partiality to my own kind;\r\nyet here I could plainly discover the true seeds of spleen, which only\r\nseizes on the lazy, the luxurious, and the rich; who, if they were forced\r\nto undergo the same regimen, I would undertake for the cure.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n    THE AUTHOR RELATES SEVERAL PARTICULARS OF THE YAHOOS—THE GREAT\r\n    VIRTUES OF THE HOUYHNHNMS—THE EDUCATION AND EXERCISE OF THEIR\r\n    YOUTH—THEIR GENERAL ASSEMBLY.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs I ought to have understood human nature much better than I supposed\r\nit possible for my master to do, it was easy to apply the character\r\nhe gave of the _yahoos_ to myself and my countrymen; and I believed I\r\ncould yet make farther discoveries from my own observation. I therefore\r\noften begged his favor to let me go among the herds of _yahoos_ in\r\nthe neighborhood; to which he always very graciously consented, being\r\nperfectly convinced that the hatred I bore those brutes would never\r\nsuffer me to be corrupted by them; and his honor ordered one of his\r\nservants, a strong sorrel nag, very honest and good-natured, to be my\r\nguard, without whose protection I durst not undertake such adventures.\r\nFor I have already told the reader how much I was pestered by these\r\nodious animals, upon my first arrival; and I afterwards failed very\r\nnarrowly three or four times of falling into their clutches, when I\r\nhappened to stray at any distance without my hanger. And I have reason to\r\nbelieve they had some imagination that I was of their own species, which\r\nI often assisted myself by stripping up my sleeves, and showing my naked\r\narms and breast in their sight, when my protector was with me. At which\r\ntimes they would approach as near as they durst, and imitate my actions\r\nafter the manner of monkeys, but ever with great signs of hatred; as a\r\ntame jackdaw with cap and stockings is always persecuted by the wild\r\nones, when he happens to get among them.\r\n\r\nThey are prodigiously nimble from their infancy. However, I once caught\r\na young male of three years old, and endeavored, by all marks of\r\ntenderness, to make it quiet; but the little imp fell a-squalling, and\r\nscratching, and biting with such violence, that I was forced to let it\r\ngo; and it was high time, for a whole troop of old ones came about us\r\nat the noise, but finding the cub was safe (for away it ran), and my\r\nsorrel nag being by, they durst not venture near us. I observed the young\r\nanimal’s flesh to smell very rank, and the stink was somewhat between a\r\nweasel and a fox, but much more disagreeable.\r\n\r\nBy what I could discover, the _yahoos_ appear to be the most unteachable\r\nof all animals; their capacities never reaching higher than to draw or\r\ncarry burdens. Yet I am of opinion, this defect arises chiefly from\r\na perverse, restive disposition. For they are cunning, malicious,\r\ntreacherous, and revengeful. They are strong and hardy, but of a cowardly\r\nspirit, and by consequence insolent, abject, and cruel. It is observed,\r\nthat the red-haired of both sexes are more mischievous than the rest,\r\nwhom they yet much exceed in strength and activity.\r\n\r\nThe Houyhnhnms keep the _yahoos_ for present use in huts not far from\r\nthe house; but the rest are sent abroad to certain fields, where they\r\ndig up roots, eat several kinds of herbs, and search about for carrion,\r\nor sometimes catch weasels and _luhimuhs_ (a sort of wild rat), which\r\nthey greedily devour. Nature has taught them to dig deep holes with their\r\nnails on the side of a rising ground, wherein they lie by themselves;\r\nonly the kennels of the females are larger, sufficient to hold two or\r\nthree cubs.\r\n\r\nThey swim from their infancy like frogs, and are able to continue long\r\nunder water, where they often take fish, which the females carry home to\r\ntheir young.\r\n\r\nHaving lived three years in this country, the reader, I suppose, will\r\nexpect that I should, like other travelers, give some account of the\r\nmanners and customs of its inhabitants, which it was, indeed, my\r\nprincipal study to learn.\r\n\r\nAs these noble Houyhnhnms are endowed by nature with a general\r\ndisposition to all virtues, and have no conceptions or ideas of what is\r\nevil in a rational creature; so their grand maxim is to cultivate reason,\r\nand to be wholly governed by it. Neither is reason among them a point\r\nproblematical, as with us, where men can argue with plausibility on both\r\nsides of the question; but strikes you with immediate conviction, as\r\nit must needs do where it is not mingled, obscured, or discolored, by\r\npassion and interest. I remember it was with extreme difficulty that I\r\ncould bring my master to understand the meaning of the word opinion, or\r\nhow a point could be disputable; because reason taught us to affirm or\r\ndeny only where we are certain; and beyond our knowledge we cannot do\r\neither. So that controversies, wranglings, disputes, and positiveness in\r\nfalse or dubious propositions are evils unknown among the Houyhnhnms. In\r\nthe like manner, when I used to explain to him our several systems of\r\nnatural philosophy, he would laugh that a creature pretending to reason,\r\nshould value itself upon the knowledge of other people’s conjectures,\r\nand in things where that knowledge, if it were certain, could be of no\r\nuse. Wherein he agreed entirely with the sentiments of Socrates, as Plato\r\ndelivers them; which I mention as the highest honor I can do that prince\r\nof philosophers. I have often since reflected, what destruction such a\r\ndoctrine would make in the libraries of Europe; and how many paths of\r\nfame would be then shut up in the learned world.\r\n\r\nFriendship and benevolence are the two principal virtues among the\r\nHouyhnhnms; and these not confined to particular objects, but universal\r\nto the whole race. For a stranger from the remotest part is equally\r\ntreated with the nearest neighbor, and wherever he goes, looks upon\r\nhimself as at home. They preserve decency and civility in the highest\r\ndegrees, but are altogether ignorant of ceremony. They have no fondness\r\nfor their colts or foals, but the care they take in educating them\r\nproceeds entirely from the dictates of reason. And I observed my master\r\nto show the same affection to his neighbor’s issue that he had for\r\nhis own. They will have it that nature teaches them to love the whole\r\nspecies, and it is reason only that makes a distinction of persons, where\r\nthere is a superior degree of virtue.\r\n\r\nWhen the matron Houyhnhnms have produced one of each sex, they no longer\r\naccompany with their consorts, except they lose one of their issue by\r\nsome casualty, which very seldom happens; but in such a case they meet\r\nagain; or when the like accident befalls a person whose wife is past\r\nbearing, some other couple bestow on him one of their own colts, and then\r\ngo together again until the mother is pregnant. This caution is necessary\r\nto prevent the country from being overburdened with numbers. But the race\r\nof inferior Houyhnhnms bred up to be servants, is not so strictly limited\r\nupon this article; these are allowed to produce three of each sex, to be\r\ndomestics in the noble families.\r\n\r\nIn their marriages, they are exactly careful to choose such colors\r\nas will not make any disagreeable mixture in the breed. Strength is\r\nchiefly valued in the male, and comeliness in the female, not upon the\r\naccount of love, but to preserve the race from degenerating; for where\r\na female happens to excel in strength, a consort is chosen with regard\r\nto comeliness. Courtship, love, presents, jointures, settlements, have\r\nno place in their thoughts; or terms whereby to express them in their\r\nlanguage. The young couple meet, and are joined, merely because it is\r\nthe determination of their parents and friends; it is what they see done\r\nevery day, and they look upon it as one of the necessary actions of a\r\nreasonable being. But the violation of marriage, or any other unchastity,\r\nwas never heard of, and the married pair pass their lives with the\r\nsame friendship and mutual benevolence that they bear to all others of\r\nthe same species who come in their way; without jealousy, fondness,\r\nquarreling, or discontent.\r\n\r\nIn educating the youth of both sexes, their method is admirable, and\r\nhighly deserves our imitation. These are not suffered to taste a grain\r\nof oats, except upon certain days, till eighteen years old; nor milk,\r\nbut very rarely; and in summer they graze two hours in the morning, and\r\nas long in the evening, which their parents likewise observe; but the\r\nservants are not allowed above half that time, and a great part of their\r\ngrass is brought home, which they eat at the most convenient hours, when\r\nthey can be best spared from work.\r\n\r\nTemperance, industry, exercise, and cleanliness, are the lessons equally\r\nenjoined to the young ones of both sexes; and my master thought it\r\nmonstrous in us to give the females a different kind of education from\r\nthe males, except in some articles of domestic management; whereby, as\r\nhe truly observed, one half of our natives were good for nothing but\r\nbringing children into the world. And to trust the care of our children\r\nto such useless animals, he said, was yet a greater instance of brutality.\r\n\r\nBut the Houyhnhnms train up their youth to strength, speed, and\r\nhardiness, by exercising them in running races up and down steep hills,\r\nand over hard stony grounds; and when they are all in a sweat they are\r\nordered to leap over head and ears into a pond or river. Four times a\r\nyear the youth of a certain district meet to show their proficiency in\r\nrunning and leaping, and other feats of strength and agility, where the\r\nvictor is rewarded with a song in his or her praise. On this festival the\r\nservants drive a herd of _yahoos_ into the field, laden with hay, and\r\noats, and milk, for a repast to the Houyhnhnms; after which these brutes\r\nare immediately driven back again, for fear of being noisome to the\r\nassembly.\r\n\r\nEvery fourth year, at the vernal equinox, there is a representative\r\ncouncil of the whole nation, which meets in a plain about twenty miles\r\nfrom our house, and continues about five or six days. Here they inquire\r\ninto the state and condition of the several districts; whether they\r\nabound or be deficient in hay, or oats, or cows, or _yahoos_; and\r\nwherever there is any want (which is but seldom) it is immediately\r\nsupplied by unanimous consent and contribution. Here likewise the\r\nregulation of children is settled; as for instance, if a Houyhnhnm has\r\ntwo males, he changes one of them with another that has two females; and\r\nwhen a child has been lost by any casualty, where the mother is past\r\nbreeding, it is determined what family shall breed another to supply the\r\nloss.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n    A GRAND DEBATE AT THE GENERAL ASSEMBLY OF THE HOUYHNHNMS, AND\r\n    HOW IT WAS DETERMINED—THE LEARNING OF THE HOUYHNHNMS—THEIR\r\n    BUILDINGS—THEIR MANNER OF BURIALS—THE DEFECTIVENESS OF THEIR\r\n    LANGUAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nOne of these grand assemblies was held in my time, about three months\r\nbefore my departure, whither my master went as the representative of our\r\ndistrict. In this council was resumed their old debate, and indeed the\r\nonly debate that ever happened in that country; whereof my master, after\r\nhis return, gave me a very particular account.\r\n\r\nThe question to be debated was, whether the _yahoos_ should be\r\nexterminated from the face of the earth. One of the members for the\r\naffirmative offered several arguments of great strength and weight,\r\nalleging that as the _yahoos_ were the most filthy, noisome, and deformed\r\nanimal which nature ever produced, so they were the most restive and\r\nindocile, mischievous and malicious; they would privately suck the teats\r\nof the Houyhnhnms’ cows, kill and devour their cats, trample down their\r\noats and grass, if they were not continually watched, and commit a\r\nthousand other extravagancies. He took notice of a general tradition that\r\n_yahoos_ had not been always in that country; but that, many ages ago,\r\ntwo of these brutes appeared together upon a mountain, whether produced\r\nby the heat of the sun upon corrupted mud and slime, or from the ooze and\r\nfroth of the sea, was never known. That these _yahoos_ engendered, and\r\ntheir brood, in a short time, grew so numerous as to overrun and infest\r\nthe whole nation. That the Houyhnhnms, to get rid of this evil, made\r\na general hunting, and at last inclosed the whole herd; and destroying\r\nthe elder, every Houyhnhnm kept two young ones in a kennel, and brought\r\nthem to such a degree of tameness, as an animal so savage by nature can\r\nbe capable of acquiring; using them for draught and carriage. That there\r\nseemed to be much truth in this tradition, and that those creatures could\r\nnot be _ylnhniamshy_ (or aborigines of the land), because of the violent\r\nhatred the Houyhnhnms, as well as all other animals, bore them, which,\r\nalthough their evil disposition sufficiently deserved, could never have\r\narrived at so high a degree, if they had been aborigines; or else they\r\nwould have long since been rooted out. That the inhabitants, taking a\r\nfancy to use the service of the _yahoos_, had very imprudently neglected\r\nto cultivate the breed of asses, which are a comely animal, easily kept,\r\nmore tame and orderly, without any offensive smell; strong enough for\r\nlabor, although they yield to the other in agility of body; and if their\r\nbraying be no agreeable sound, it is far preferable to the horrible\r\nhowlings of the _yahoos_.\r\n\r\nSeveral others declared their sentiments to the same purpose, when my\r\nmaster proposed an expedient to the assembly, whereof he had indeed\r\nborrowed the hint from me. He approved of the tradition mentioned by the\r\nhonorable member who spoke before, and affirmed, that the two _yahoos_\r\nsaid to be first seen among them had been driven thither over the sea;\r\nthat coming to land, and being forsaken by their companions, they retired\r\nto the mountains, and degenerating by degrees, became in process of time\r\nmuch more savage than those of their own species in the country whence\r\nthese two originals came. The reason of his assertion was, that he had\r\nnow in his possession a certain wonderful _yahoo_ (meaning myself),\r\nwhich most of them had heard of, and many of them had seen. He then\r\nrelated to them how he first found me; that my body was all covered with\r\nan artificial composure of the skins and hairs of other animals; that\r\nI had a language of my own, and had thoroughly learned theirs; that I\r\nhad related to him the accidents which brought me thither; that when he\r\nsaw me without my covering, I was an exact _yahoo_ in every part, only\r\nof a whiter color, less hairy, and with shorter claws. He added how I\r\nhad endeavored to persuade him, that in my own and other countries the\r\n_yahoos_ acted as the governing, rational animal, and held the Houyhnhnms\r\nin servitude; that he observed in me all the qualities of a _yahoo_, only\r\na little more civilized by some tincture of reason, which, however, was\r\nin a degree as far inferior to the Houyhnhnm race, as the _yahoos_ of\r\ntheir country were to me. That among other things I mentioned a custom we\r\nhad of preventing Houyhnhnms from propagating their kind; that it was no\r\nshame to learn wisdom from brutes, as industry is taught by the ant, and\r\nbuilding by the swallow (for so I translate the word _lyhannh_, although\r\nit be a much larger fowl); that this invention might be practiced upon\r\nthe younger _yahoos_ here, which would in an age put an end to the whole\r\nspecies, without destroying life. That in the meantime the Houyhnhnms\r\nshould be exhorted to cultivate the breed of asses, which as they are in\r\nall respects more valuable brutes, so they have this advantage, to be fit\r\nfor service at five years old, which the others are not till twelve.\r\n\r\nThis was all my master thought fit to tell me at that time, of\r\nwhat passed in the grand council. But he was pleased to conceal one\r\nparticular, which related personally to myself, whereof I soon felt the\r\nunhappy effect, as the reader will know in its proper place, and whence I\r\ndate all the succeeding misfortunes of my life.\r\n\r\nThe Houyhnhnms have no letters, and consequently their knowledge is all\r\ntraditional. But there happening few events of any moment among a people\r\nso well united, naturally disposed of every virtue, wholly governed by\r\nreason, and cut off from all commerce with other nations, the historical\r\npart is easily preserved without burdening their memories. I have already\r\nobserved that they are subject to no diseases, and therefore can have no\r\nneed of physicians. However, they have excellent medicines, composed of\r\nherbs, to cure accidental bruises and cuts in the pastern or frog of the\r\nfoot, by sharp stones, as well as other maims and hurts in the several\r\nparts of the body.\r\n\r\nThey calculate the year by the revolution of the sun and the moon, but\r\nuse no subdivisions into weeks. They are well enough acquainted with the\r\nmotions of those two luminaries, and understand the nature of eclipses;\r\nand this is the utmost progress of their astronomy.\r\n\r\nIn poetry, they must be allowed to excel all other mortals; wherein the\r\njustness of their similes, and the minuteness as well as exactness of\r\ntheir descriptions, are indeed inimitable. Their verses abound very much\r\nin both of these, and usually contain either some exalted notions of\r\nfriendship and benevolence, or the praises of those who were victors in\r\nraces and other bodily exercises. Their buildings, although very rude\r\nand simple, are not inconvenient but well contrived to defend them from\r\nall injuries of cold and heat. They have a kind of tree, which at forty\r\nyears old loosens in the root, and falls with the first storm; they\r\ngrow very straight, and being pointed like stakes with a sharp stone\r\n(for the Houyhnhnms know not the use of iron), they stick them erect in\r\nthe ground, about ten inches asunder, and then weave in oat-straw, or\r\nsometimes wattles between them. The roof is made after the same manner,\r\nand so are the doors.\r\n\r\nThe Houyhnhnms use the hollow part between the pastern and the hoof of\r\nthe forefoot, as we do our hands, and this with greater dexterity than\r\nI could at first imagine. I have seen a white mare of our family thread\r\na needle (which I lent her on purpose) with that joint. They milk their\r\ncows, reap their oats, and do all the work which requires hands, in the\r\nsame manner. They have a kind of hard flints, which by grinding against\r\nother stones, they form into instruments, that serve instead of wedges,\r\naxes, and hammers. With tools made of these flints, they likewise cut\r\ntheir hay, and reap their oats, which there grow naturally in several\r\nfields; the _yahoos_ draw home the sheaves in carriages, and the servants\r\ntread them in certain covered huts to get out the grain, which is kept in\r\nstores. They make a rude kind of earthen and wooden vessels, and bake the\r\nformer in the sun.\r\n\r\nIf they can avoid casualties, they die only of old age, and are buried\r\nin the obscurest places that can be found, their friends and relations\r\nexpressing neither joy nor grief at their departure; nor does the dying\r\nperson discover the least regret that he is leaving the world, any more\r\nthan if he were upon returning home from a visit to one of his neighbors.\r\nI remember my master having once made an appointment with a friend and\r\nhis family to come to his house, upon some affair of importance: on the\r\nday fixed, the mistress and her two children came very late; she made\r\ntwo excuses, first for her husband, who, as she said, happened that very\r\nmorning to _shnuwnh_. The word is strongly expressive in their language,\r\nbut not easily rendered into English; it signifies, “to retire to his\r\nfirst mother.” Her excuse for not coming sooner, was, that her husband\r\ndying late in the morning, she was a good while consulting her servants\r\nabout a convenient place where his body should be laid; and I observed\r\nshe behaved herself at our house as cheerfully as the rest; she died\r\nabout three months after.\r\n\r\nThey live generally to seventy or seventy-five years, very seldom to\r\nfourscore; some weeks before their death, they feel a gradual decay, but\r\nwithout pain. During this time they are much visited by their friends,\r\nbecause they cannot go abroad with their usual ease and satisfaction.\r\nHowever, about ten days before their death, which they seldom fail in\r\ncomputing, they return the visits that have been made them by those who\r\nare nearest in the neighborhood, being carried in a convenient sledge\r\ndrawn by _yahoos_, which vehicle they use, not only upon this occasion,\r\nbut when they grow old, upon long journeys, or when they are lamed by an\r\naccident; and therefore, when the dying Houyhnhnms return those visits,\r\nthey take a solemn leave of their friends, as if they were going to some\r\nremote part of the country where they designed to pass the rest of their\r\nlives.\r\n\r\nI know not whether it may be worth observing that the Houyhnhnms have no\r\nword in their language to express anything that is evil, except what they\r\nborrow from the deformities or ill qualities of the _yahoos_. Thus, they\r\ndenote the folly of a servant, an omission of a child, a stone that cuts\r\ntheir feet, a continuance of foul or unseasonable weather, and the like,\r\nby adding to each the epithet of _yahoo_. For instance, _hhnm yahoo_,\r\n_whnaholm yahoo_, _ynlhmndwihlma yahoo_, and an ill-contrived house,\r\n_ynholmhnmrohlnw yahoo_.\r\n\r\nI could, with great pleasure, enlarge farther upon the manners and\r\nvirtues of this excellent people; but intending in a short time to\r\npublish a volume by itself, expressly upon that subject, I refer the\r\nreader thither; and, in the meantime, proceed to relate my own sad\r\ncatastrophe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n    THE AUTHOR’S ECONOMY AND HAPPY LIFE AMONG THE HOUYHNHNMS—HIS\r\n    GREAT IMPROVEMENT IN VIRTUE BY CONVERSING WITH THEM—THEIR\r\n    CONVERSATIONS—THE AUTHOR HAS NOTICE GIVEN HIM BY HIS MASTER\r\n    THAT HE MUST DEPART FROM THE COUNTRY—HE FALLS INTO A SWOON FOR\r\n    GRIEF, BUT SUBMITS—HE CONTRIVES AND FINISHES A CANOE BY THE\r\n    HELP OF A FELLOW SERVANT, AND PUTS TO SEA AT A VENTURE.\r\n\r\n\r\nI had settled my little economy to my own heart’s content. My master had\r\nordered a room to be made for me, after their manner, about six yards\r\nfrom the house, the sides and floors of which I plastered with clay, and\r\ncovered with rush mats of my own contriving; I had beaten hemp, which\r\nthere grows wild, and made of it a sort of ticking; this I filled with\r\nthe feathers of several birds I had taken with springs made of _yahoos_’\r\nhairs, and were excellent food. I had worked two chairs with my knife,\r\nthe sorrel nag helping me in the grosser and more laborious part. When\r\nmy clothes were worn to rags, I made myself others with the skins of\r\nrabbits, and of a certain beautiful animal, about the same size, called\r\n_nnuhnoh_, the skin of which is covered with a fine down. Of these I\r\nalso made very tolerable stockings. I soled my shoes with wood, which I\r\ncut from a tree, and fitted to the upper leather; and when this was worn\r\nout, I supplied it with the skins of _yahoos_ dried in the sun. I often\r\ngot honey out of hollow trees, which I mingled with water, or ate with\r\nmy bread. No man could more verify the truth of these two maxims, that\r\nnature is very easily satisfied; and that necessity is the mother of\r\ninvention. I enjoyed perfect health of body, and tranquillity of mind; I\r\ndid not find the treachery or inconstancy of a friend, nor the injuries\r\nof a secret or open enemy. I had no occasion of bribing or flattering to\r\nprocure the favor of any great man, or of his minion. I wanted no fence\r\nagainst fraud, or oppression; here was neither physician to destroy my\r\nbody, nor lawyer to ruin my fortune; no informer to watch my words and\r\nactions, or forge accusations against me for hire; here were no gibers,\r\ncensurers, backbiters, pickpockets, highwaymen, housebreakers, attorneys,\r\nbuffoons, gamesters, politicians, wits, splenetics, tedious talkers,\r\ncontrovertists, ravishers, murderers, robbers, virtuosos; no leaders, or\r\nfollowers, of party and faction; no encouragers to vice, by seducement\r\nor example; no dungeon, axes, gibbets, whipping posts, or pillories; no\r\ncheating shopkeepers, or mechanics; no pride, vanity, or affectation; no\r\nfops, bullies, drunkards; no ranting, expensive wives; no stupid, proud\r\npedants; no importunate, overbearing, quarrelsome, noisy, roaring, empty,\r\nconceited, swearing companions; no scoundrels raised from the dust for\r\nthe sake of their vices, or nobility thrown into it on account of their\r\nvirtues; no lords, fiddlers, judges, or dancing masters.\r\n\r\nI had the favor of being admitted to several Houyhnhnms who came to\r\nvisit or dine with my master; where his honor graciously suffered me to\r\nwait in the room, and listen to their discourse. Both he and his company\r\nwould often descend to ask me questions, and receive my answers. I had\r\nalso sometimes the honor of attending my master in his visits to others.\r\nI never presumed to speak, except in answer to a question; and then I\r\ndid it with inward regret, because it was a loss of so much time for\r\nimproving myself: but I was infinitely delighted with the station of\r\na humble auditor in such conversations, where nothing passed but what\r\nwas useful, expressed in the fewest and most significant words; where\r\nthe greatest decency was observed without the least degree of ceremony;\r\nwhere no person spoke without being pleased himself, and pleasing his\r\ncompanions; where there was no interruption, tediousness, heat, or\r\ndifference of sentiments. They have a notion, that when people are met\r\ntogether, a short silence does much improve conversation; this I found\r\nto be true; for during those little intermissions of talk, new ideas\r\nwould arise in their minds, which very much enlivened the discourse.\r\nTheir subjects are generally on friendship and benevolence; on order and\r\neconomy; sometimes upon the visible operations of nature, or ancient\r\ntraditions; upon the bounds and limits of virtue; upon the unerring rules\r\nof reason, or upon some determinations to be taken at the next assembly;\r\nand often upon the various excellencies of poetry. I may add, without\r\nvanity, that my presence often gave them sufficient matter for discourse,\r\nbecause it afforded my master an occasion of letting his friends into\r\nthe history of me and my country, upon which they were all pleased to\r\ndescant, in a manner not very advantageous to human kind; and for that\r\nreason I shall not repeat what they said; only I may be allowed to\r\nobserve, that his honor, to my great admiration, appeared to understand\r\nthe nature of _yahoos_ much better than myself. He went through all our\r\nvices and follies, and discovered many which I had never mentioned to\r\nhim, by only supposing what qualities a _yahoo_ of their country, with a\r\nsmall proportion of reason, might be capable of exerting; and concluded,\r\nwith too much probability, how vile, as well as miserable such a creature\r\nmust be.\r\n\r\nI freely confess, that all the little knowledge I have of any value, was\r\nacquired by the lectures I received from my master, and from hearing\r\nthe discourses of him and his friends; to which I should be prouder to\r\nlisten, than to dictate to the greatest and wisest assembly in Europe. I\r\nadmired the strength, comeliness, and speed of the inhabitants; and such\r\na constellation of virtues, in such amiable persons, produced in me the\r\nhighest veneration. At first, indeed, I did not feel that natural awe\r\nwhich the _yahoos_ and all other animals bear towards them; but it grew\r\nupon me by degrees, much sooner than I imagined, and was mingled with a\r\nrespectful love and gratitude, that they would condescend to distinguish\r\nme from the rest of my species.\r\n\r\nWhen I thought of my family, my friends, my countrymen, or the human\r\nrace in general, I considered them, as they really were, _yahoos_ in\r\nshape and disposition, only a little civilized, and qualified with the\r\ngift of speech; but making no other use of reason than to improve and\r\nmultiply those vices, whereof their brethren in this country had only\r\nthe share that nature allotted them. When I happened to behold the\r\nreflection of my own form in a lake or a fountain, I turned away my\r\nface in horror and detestation of myself; and could better endure the\r\nsight of a common _yahoo_, than of my own person. By conversing with the\r\nHouyhnhnms and looking upon them with delight, I fell to imitate their\r\ngait and gestures, which is now grown into a habit; and my friends often\r\ntell me, in a blunt way, that I trot like a horse, which, however, I take\r\nfor a great compliment; neither shall I disown, that in speaking I am\r\napt to fall into the voice and manner of the Houyhnhnms, and hear myself\r\nridiculed on that account without the least mortification.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of all this happiness, and when I looked upon myself to\r\nbe fully settled for life, my master sent for me one morning a little\r\nearlier than his usual hour. I observed by his countenance that he was in\r\nsome perplexity, and at a loss how to begin what he had to speak. After\r\na short silence he told me he did not know how I would take what he was\r\ngoing to say; that in the last general assembly, when the affair of the\r\n_yahoos_ was entered upon, the representatives had taken offense at his\r\nkeeping a _yahoo_ (meaning myself) in his family more like a Houyhnhnm\r\nthan a brute animal. That he was known frequently to converse with me, as\r\nif he could receive some advantage or pleasure in my company. That such a\r\npractice was not agreeable to reason or nature, nor a thing ever heard of\r\nbefore among them. The assembly did therefore exhort him either to employ\r\nme like the rest of my species, or command me to swim back to the place\r\nwhence I came. That the first of these expedients was utterly rejected by\r\nall the Houyhnhnms who had ever seen me at his house or their own; for\r\nthey alleged, that because I had some rudiments of reason, added to the\r\nnatural depravity of those animals, it was to be feared I might be able\r\nto seduce them into the woody and mountainous parts of the country, and\r\nbring them in troops by night to destroy the Houyhnhnms’ cattle, as being\r\nnaturally of the ravenous kind, and averse from labor.\r\n\r\nMy master added that he was daily pressed by the Houyhnhnms of the\r\nneighborhood, to have the assembly’s exhortation executed, which he\r\ncould not put off much longer. He doubted it would be impossible for me\r\nto swim to another country; and therefore wished I would contrive some\r\nsort of a vehicle, resembling those I had described to him, that might\r\ncarry me on the sea; in which work I should have the assistance of his\r\nown servants, as well as those of his neighbors. He concluded, that for\r\nhis own part, he could have been content to keep me in his service as\r\nlong as I lived; because he found I had cured myself of some bad habits\r\nand dispositions, by endeavoring, as far as my inferior nature was\r\ncapable, to imitate the Houyhnhnms.\r\n\r\nI should here observe to the reader, that a decree of the general\r\nassembly in this country is expressed by the word _hnhloayn_, which\r\nsignifies an exhortation, as near as I can render it: for they have no\r\nconception how a rational creature can be compelled, but only advised,\r\nor exhorted; because no person can disobey reason, without giving up his\r\nclaim to be a rational creature.\r\n\r\nI was struck with the utmost grief and despair at my master’s discourse;\r\nand being unable to support the agonies I was under, I fell into a\r\nswoon at his feet. When I came to myself he told me that he concluded I\r\nhad been dead; for these people are subject to no such imbecilities of\r\nnature. I answered in a faint voice that death would have been too great\r\na happiness; that although I could not blame the assembly’s exhortation,\r\nor the urgency of his friends; yet, in my weak and corrupt judgment, I\r\nthought it might consist with reason to have been less rigorous. That I\r\ncould not swim a league, and probably the nearest land to theirs might\r\nbe distant above a hundred. That many materials necessary for making\r\na small vessel to carry me off, were wholly wanting in this country;\r\nwhich, however, I would attempt, in obedience and gratitude to his honor,\r\nalthough I concluded the thing to be impossible, and therefore looked on\r\nmyself as already devoted to destruction. That the certain prospect of\r\nan unnatural death was the least of my evils; for, supposing I should\r\nescape with life by some strange adventure, how could I think with temper\r\nof passing my days among _yahoos_, and relapsing into my old corruptions\r\nfor want of examples to lead and keep me within the paths of virtue?\r\nThat I knew too well upon what solid reasons all the determinations of\r\nthe wise Houyhnhnms were founded, not to be shaken by arguments of mine,\r\na miserable _yahoo_; and therefore, after presenting him with my humble\r\nthanks for the offer of his servants’ assistance in making a vessel, and\r\ndesiring a reasonable time for so difficult a work, I told him I would\r\nendeavor to preserve a wretched being; and if ever I returned to England,\r\nwas not without hopes of being useful to my own species, by celebrating\r\nthe praises of the renowned Houyhnhnms, and proposing their virtues to\r\nthe imitation of mankind.\r\n\r\nMy master, in a few words, made a very gracious reply; allowed me the\r\nspace of two months to finish my boat; and ordered the sorrel nag, my\r\nfellow servant (for so at this distance I may presume to call him), to\r\nfollow my instruction, because I told my master that his help would be\r\nsufficient, and I knew he had a tenderness for me.\r\n\r\nIn his company, my first business was to go to that part of the coast\r\nwhere my rebellious crew had ordered me to be set on shore. I got upon\r\na height, and looking on every side into the sea, fancied I saw a small\r\nisland towards the northeast. I took out my pocket glass, and could\r\nthen clearly distinguish it about five leagues off, as I computed; but\r\nit appeared to the sorrel nag to be only a blue cloud: for as he had no\r\nconception of any country beside his own, so he could not be as expert in\r\ndistinguishing remote objects at sea, as we who so much converse in that\r\nelement.\r\n\r\nAfter I had discovered this island, I considered no farther; but resolved\r\nit should, if possible, be the first place of my banishment, leaving the\r\nconsequence to fortune.\r\n\r\nI returned home, and consulting with the sorrel nag, we went into a copse\r\nat some distance, where I with my knife, and he with a sharp flint,\r\nfastened very artificially after their manner to a wooden handle, cut\r\ndown several oak wattles, about the thickness of a walking staff, and\r\nsome larger pieces. But I shall not trouble the reader with a particular\r\ndescription of my own mechanics; let it suffice to say, that in six\r\nweeks’ time, with the help of the sorrel nag, who performed the parts\r\nthat required most labor, I finished a sort of Indian canoe, but much\r\nlarger, covering it with the skins of _yahoos_, well stitched together\r\nwith hempen threads of my own making. My sail was likewise composed of\r\nthe skins of the same animal; but I made use of the youngest I could get,\r\nthe older being too tough and thick; and I likewise provided myself with\r\nfour paddles. I laid in a stock of boiled flesh of rabbits and fowls; and\r\ntook with me two vessels, one filled with milk and the other with water.\r\n\r\nI tried my canoe in a large pond, near my master’s house, and then\r\ncorrected in it what was amiss; stopping all the chinks with _yahoos’_\r\ntallow, till I found it stanch, and able to bear me and my freight; and\r\nwhen it was as complete as I could possibly make it, I had it drawn on a\r\ncarriage very gently by _yahoos_ to the seaside, under the conduct of the\r\nsorrel nag and another servant.\r\n\r\nWhen all was ready, and the day came for my departure, I took leave of\r\nmy master, and lady, and the whole family, my eyes flowing with tears,\r\nand my heart quite sunk with grief. But his honor, out of curiosity, and\r\nperhaps (if I may speak it without vanity) partly out of kindness, was\r\ndetermined to see me in my canoe; and got several of his neighboring\r\nfriends to accompany him. I was forced to wait above an hour for the\r\ntide, and then observing the wind very fortunately bearing towards the\r\nisland to which I intended to steer my course, I took a second leave\r\nof my master; but as I was going to prostrate myself to kiss his hoof,\r\nhe did me the honor to raise it gently to my mouth. I am not ignorant\r\nhow much I have been censured for mentioning this last particular. For\r\nmy detractors are pleased to think it improbable that so illustrious\r\na person should descend to give so great a mark of distinction to\r\na creature so inferior as I. Neither have I forgotten how apt some\r\ntravelers are to boast of extraordinary favors they have received. But,\r\nif these censurers were better acquainted with the noble and courteous\r\ndisposition of the Houyhnhnms, they would soon change their opinion.\r\n\r\nI paid my respects to the rest of the Houyhnhnms in his honor’s company;\r\nthen getting into my canoe, I pushed off from the shore.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n    THE AUTHOR’S DANGEROUS VOYAGE—HE ARRIVES AT NEW HOLLAND,\r\n    HOPING TO SETTLE THERE—IS WOUNDED WITH AN ARROW BY ONE OF\r\n    THE NATIVES—IS SEIZED AND CARRIED BY FORCE INTO A PORTUGUESE\r\n    SHIP—THE GREAT CIVILITIES OF THE CAPTAIN—THE AUTHOR ARRIVES AT\r\n    ENGLAND.\r\n\r\n\r\nI began this desperate voyage on February 15, 1714/5, at nine o’clock in\r\nthe morning. The wind was very favorable; however, I made use at first\r\nonly of my paddles; but considering I should soon be weary, and that the\r\nwind might chop about, I ventured to set up my little sail; and thus,\r\nwith the help of the tide, I went at the rate of a league and a half an\r\nhour, as near as I could guess. My master and his friends continued on\r\nthe shore till I was almost out of sight; and I often heard the sorrel\r\nnag (who always loved me) crying out, _Hnuy illa nyha majah yahoo_—“Take\r\ncare of thyself, gentle yahoo.”\r\n\r\nMy design was, if possible, to discover some small island uninhabited,\r\nyet sufficient with my labor to furnish me with the necessaries of life,\r\nwhich I would have thought a greater happiness than to be first minister\r\nin the politest court of Europe; so horrible was the idea I conceived of\r\nreturning to live in the society and under the government of _yahoos_.\r\nFor in such a solitude as I desired, I could at least enjoy my own\r\nthoughts, and reflect with delight on the virtues of those inimitable\r\nHouyhnhnms, without any opportunity of degenerating into the vices and\r\ncorruptions of my own species.\r\n\r\nThe reader may remember what I related when my crew conspired against me,\r\nand confined me to my cabin; how I continued there several weeks without\r\nknowing what course we took, and when I was put ashore in the longboat,\r\nhow the sailors told me with oaths, whether true or false, that they\r\nknew not in what part of the world we were. However, I did then believe\r\nus to be about 10 degrees southward of the Cape of Good Hope, or about\r\n45 degrees southern latitude, as I gathered from some general words\r\nI overheard among them, being, I supposed, to the southeast in their\r\nintended voyage to Madagascar. And although this were little better than\r\nconjecture, yet I resolved to steer my course eastward, hoping to reach\r\nthe southwest coast of New Holland, and perhaps some such island as I\r\ndesired, lying westward of it. The wind was full west, and by six in the\r\nevening I computed I had gone eastward at least eighteen leagues; when I\r\nspied a very small island about half a league off, which I soon reached.\r\nIt was nothing but a rock, with one creek naturally arched by the force\r\nof tempests. Here I put in my canoe, and climbing a part of the rock, I\r\ncould plainly discover land to the east extending from south to north. I\r\nlay all night in my canoe, and repeating my voyage early in the morning,\r\nI arrived in seven hours to the southwest point of New Holland. This\r\nconfirmed me in the opinion I have long entertained, that the maps and\r\ncharts place this country at least three degrees more to the east than\r\nit really is; which thought I communicated many years ago to my worthy\r\nfriend Mr. Herman Moll, and gave him my reasons for it, although he has\r\nrather chosen to follow other authors.\r\n\r\nI saw no inhabitants in the place where I landed, and being unarmed, I\r\nwas afraid of venturing far into the country. I found some shellfish\r\non the shore, and ate them raw, not daring to kindle a fire, for fear\r\nof being discovered by the natives. I continued three days feeding on\r\noysters and limpets, to save my own provisions; and I fortunately found a\r\nbrook of excellent water, which gave me great relief.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth day, venturing out a little too far, I saw twenty or thirty\r\nnatives upon a height not above five hundred yards from me. They were\r\nstark naked, men, women and children round a fire, as I could discover\r\nby the smoke. One of them spied me, and gave notice to the rest; five of\r\nthem advanced towards me, leaving the women and children at the fire. I\r\nmade what haste I could to the shore, and, getting into my canoe, shoved\r\noff: the savages, observing me retreat, ran after me, and before I could\r\nget far enough into the sea, discharged an arrow, which wounded me deeply\r\non the inside of my left knee (I shall carry the mark to my grave). I\r\napprehended the arrow might be poisoned, and paddling out of the reach\r\nof their darts (being a calm day), I made a shift to suck the wound, and\r\ndress it as well as I could.\r\n\r\nI was at a loss what to do, for I durst not return to the same landing\r\nplace, but stood to the north, and was forced to paddle; for the wind,\r\nthough very gentle, was against me, blowing northwest. As I was looking\r\nabout for a secure landing place, I saw a sail to the north-north-east,\r\nwhich appearing every minute more visible, I was in some doubt whether I\r\nshould wait for them or not; but at last my detestation of the _yahoo_\r\nrace prevailed; and turning my canoe, I sailed and paddled together to\r\nthe south, and got into the same creek whence I set out in the morning,\r\nchoosing rather to trust myself among these barbarians, than live with\r\nEuropean _yahoos_. I drew up my canoe as close as I could to the shore,\r\nand hid myself behind a stone by the little brook, which, as I have\r\nalready said, was excellent water.\r\n\r\nThe ship came within half a league of this creek, and sent her longboat\r\nwith vessels to take in fresh water (for the place, it seems, was very\r\nwell known), but I did not observe it till the boat was almost on shore;\r\nand it was too late to seek another hiding place. The seamen at their\r\nlanding observed my canoe, and rummaging it all over, easily conjectured\r\nthat the owner could not be far off. Four of them, well armed, searched\r\nevery cranny and lurking hole, till at last they found me flat on my face\r\nbehind the stone. They gazed awhile in admiration at my strange uncouth\r\ndress; my coat made of skins, my wooden shoes and my furred stockings;\r\nwhence, however, they concluded I was not a native of the place, who all\r\ngo naked. One of the seamen, in Portuguese, bid me rise, and asked me who\r\nI was. I understood that language very well, and getting upon my feet,\r\nsaid I was a poor _yahoo_, banished from the Houyhnhnms, and desired\r\nthey would please to let me depart. They admired to hear me answer them\r\nin their own tongue, and saw by my complexion I must be a European; but\r\nwere at a loss to know what I meant by _yahoos_ and Houyhnhnms; and at\r\nthe same time fell a-laughing at my strange tone in speaking, which\r\nresembled the neighing of a horse. I trembled all the while betwixt fear\r\nand hatred. I again desired leave to depart, and was gently moving to\r\nmy canoe; but they laid hold of me, desiring to know what country I was\r\nof, whence I came, with many other questions. I told them I was born\r\nin England, whence I came about five years ago, and then their country\r\nand ours were at peace. I therefore hoped they would not treat me as an\r\nenemy, since I meant them no harm; but was a poor _yahoo_, seeking some\r\ndesolate place where to pass the remainder of his unfortunate life.\r\n\r\nWhen they began to talk, I thought I never heard or saw anything so\r\nunnatural; for it appeared to me as monstrous as if a dog or a cow should\r\nspeak in England, or a _yahoo_ in Houyhnhnmland. The honest Portuguese\r\nwere equally amazed at my strange dress, and the odd manner of delivering\r\nmy words, which, however, they understood very well. They spoke to me\r\nwith great humanity, and said they were sure the captain would carry me\r\ngratis to Lisbon, whence I might return to my own country; that two of\r\nthe seamen would go back to the ship, inform the captain of what they had\r\nseen, and receive his orders; in the meantime, unless I would give my\r\nsolemn oath not to fly, they would secure me by force. I thought it best\r\nto comply with their proposal. They were very curious to know my story,\r\nbut I gave them very little satisfaction, and they all conjectured that\r\nmy misfortunes had impaired my reason. In two hours the boat, which went\r\nladen with vessels of water, returned with the captain’s command to fetch\r\nme on board. I fell on my knees to preserve my liberty; but all was in\r\nvain; and the men having tied me with cords, heaved me into the boat,\r\nwhence I was taken into the ship, and thence into the captain’s cabin.\r\n\r\nHis name was Pedro de Mendez; he was a very courteous and generous\r\nperson. He entreated me to give some account of myself, and desired\r\nto know what I would eat or drink; said I should be used as well as\r\nhimself; and spoke so many obliging things, that I wondered to find such\r\ncivilities from a _yahoo_. However, I remained silent and sullen; I was\r\nready to faint at the very smell of him and his men. At last I desired\r\nsomething to eat out of my own canoe; but he ordered me a chicken, and\r\nsome excellent wine, and then directed that I should be put to bed in a\r\nvery clean cabin. I would not undress myself, but lay on the bedclothes,\r\nand in half an hour stole out when I thought the crew were at dinner, and\r\ngetting to the side of the ship, was going to leap into the sea and swim\r\nfor my life, rather than continue among _yahoos_. But one of the seamen\r\nprevented me, and having informed the captain, I was chained to my cabin.\r\n\r\nAfter dinner, Don Pedro came to me, and desired to know my reason for so\r\ndesperate an attempt; assured me he only meant to do me all the service\r\nhe was able; and spoke so very movingly, that at last I descended to\r\ntreat him like an animal which had some little portion of reason. I\r\ngave him a very short relation of my voyage; of the conspiracy against\r\nme by my own men; of the country where they set me on shore, and of my\r\nfive years’ residence there. All which he looked upon as if it were a\r\ndream or a vision; whereat I took great offense; for I had quite forgot\r\nthe faculty of lying, so peculiar to _yahoos_ in all countries where\r\nthey preside, and consequently, the disposition of suspecting truth in\r\nothers of their own species. I asked him whether it were the custom in\r\nhis country to say the thing which was not. I assured him I had almost\r\nforgot what he meant by falsehood, and if I had lived a thousand years in\r\nHouyhnhnmland, I should never have heard a lie from the meanest servant;\r\nthat I was altogether indifferent whether he believed me or no; but\r\nhowever, in return for his favors, I would give so much allowance to the\r\ncorruption of his nature, as to answer any objection he might please to\r\nmake, and then he might easily discover the truth.\r\n\r\nThe captain, a wise man, after many endeavors to catch me tripping in\r\nsome part of my story, at last began to have a better opinion of my\r\nveracity, and the rather because he confessed he met with a Dutch skipper\r\nwho pretended to have landed with five others of his crew on a certain\r\nisland or continent south of New Holland, where they went for fresh\r\nwater, and observed a horse driving before him several animals exactly\r\nresembling those I described under the name of _yahoos_, with some other\r\nparticulars which the captain said he had forgotten, because he then\r\nconsidered them all to be lies. But he added that since I professed so\r\ninviolable an attachment to truth, I must give him my word and honor to\r\nbear him company in this voyage without attempting anything against my\r\nlife, or else he would continue to hold me a prisoner till we arrived at\r\nLisbon. I gave him the required promise, but at the same time I protested\r\nthat I would suffer the greatest hardships rather than return to live\r\namong _yahoos_.\r\n\r\nOur voyage passed without any considerable accident. In gratitude to the\r\ncaptain, I sometimes sat with him at his earnest request, and strove to\r\nconceal my antipathy against human kind, although it often broke out,\r\nwhich he suffered to pass without observation. But the greatest part of\r\nthe day I confined myself to my cabin, to avoid seeing any of the crew.\r\nThe captain had often entreated me to strip myself of my savage dress,\r\nand offered to lend me the best suit of clothes he had. This I would not\r\nbe prevailed on to accept, abhorring to cover myself with anything that\r\nhad been on the back of a _yahoo_; I only desired he would lend me two\r\nclean shirts, which having been washed since he wore them, I believed\r\nwould not so much defile me. These I changed every second day, and washed\r\nthem myself.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Lisbon, November 5th, 1715. At our landing, the captain\r\nforced me to cover myself with his cloak, to prevent the rabble from\r\ncrowding about me. I was conveyed to his own house; and at my earnest\r\nrequest he led me up to the highest room backwards. I conjured him to\r\nconceal from all persons what I had told him of the Houyhnhnms; because\r\nthe least hint of such a story would not only draw numbers of people to\r\nsee me, but probably put me in danger of being imprisoned, or burnt by\r\nthe Inquisition. The captain persuaded me to accept a suit of clothes\r\nnewly made, but I would not suffer the tailor to take my measure;\r\nhowever, Don Pedro being almost of my size, they fitted me well enough.\r\nHe accoutered me with other necessaries, all new, which I aired for\r\ntwenty-four hours before I would use them.\r\n\r\nThe captain had no wife, nor above three servants, none of which were\r\nsuffered to attend at meals; and his whole deportment was so obliging,\r\nadded to very good human understanding, that I really began to tolerate\r\nhis company. He gained so far upon me, that I ventured to look out of the\r\nback window. By degrees I was brought into another room, whence I peeped\r\ninto the street, but drew my head back in a fright. In a week’s time he\r\nseduced me down to the door. I found my terror gradually lessened, but my\r\nhatred and contempt seemed to increase. I was at last bold enough to walk\r\nthe street in his company, but kept my nose well stopped with rue, and\r\nsometimes with tobacco.\r\n\r\nIn ten days, Don Pedro, to whom I had given some account of my domestic\r\naffairs, put it upon me, as a matter of honor and conscience, that I\r\nought to return to my native country, and live at home with my wife and\r\nchildren. He told me there was an English ship in port just ready to\r\nsail, and he would furnish me with all things necessary. It would be\r\ntedious to repeat his arguments, and my contradictions. He said it was\r\naltogether impossible to find such a solitary island as I had desired\r\nto live in; but I might command in my own house, and pass my time in a\r\nmanner as recluse as I pleased.\r\n\r\nI complied at last, finding I could do no better. I left Lisbon the 24th\r\nday of November, in an English merchantman, but who was the master I\r\nnever inquired. Don Pedro accompanied me to the ship, and lent me twenty\r\npounds. He took kind leave of me, and embraced me at parting, which I\r\nbore as well as I could. During the last voyage I had no commerce with\r\nthe master or any of his men; but pretending I was sick, kept close in my\r\ncabin. On the 5th of December, 1715, we cast anchor at the Downs, about\r\nnine in the morning, and at three in the afternoon I got safe to my house\r\nat Redriff.\r\n\r\nMy wife and family received me with great surprise and joy, because they\r\nconcluded me certainly dead; but I must freely confess the sight of them\r\nfilled me only with hatred, disgust, and contempt, and the more, by\r\nreflecting on the near alliance I had to them. For although, since my\r\nunfortunate exile from the Houyhnhnm country, I had compelled myself to\r\ntolerate the sight of _yahoos_, and to converse with Don Pedro de Mendez,\r\nyet my memory and imagination were perpetually filled with the virtues\r\nand ideas of those exalted Houyhnhnms.\r\n\r\nAs soon as I entered the house, my wife took me in her arms and kissed\r\nme; at which, having not been used to the touch of that odious animal\r\nfor so many years, I fell into a swoon for almost an hour. At the time\r\nI am writing, it is five years since my last return to England. During\r\nthe first year, I could not endure my wife and children in my presence;\r\nthe smell of them was intolerable; much less could I suffer them to\r\neat in the same room. To this hour they dare not presume to touch my\r\nbread, or drink out of the same cup, neither was I ever able to let one\r\nof them take me by the hand. The first money I laid out was to buy two\r\nyoung horses, which I keep in a good stable; and next to them the groom\r\nis my greatest favorite; for I feel my spirits revived by the smell\r\nhe contracts in the stable. My horses understand me tolerably well; I\r\nconverse with them at least four hours every day. They are strangers to\r\nbridle and saddle; they live in great amity with me, and friendship to\r\neach other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n    THE AUTHOR’S VERACITY—HIS DESIGN IN PUBLISHING THIS WORK—HIS\r\n    CENSURE OF THOSE TRAVELERS WHO SWERVE FROM THE TRUTH—THE AUTHOR\r\n    CLEARS HIMSELF FROM ANY SINISTER ENDS IN WRITING—AN OBJECTION\r\n    ANSWERED—THE METHOD OF PLANTING COLONIES—HIS NATIVE COUNTRY\r\n    COMMENDED—THE RIGHT OF THE CROWN TO THOSE COUNTRIES DESCRIBED\r\n    BY THE AUTHOR IS JUSTIFIED—THE DIFFICULTY OF CONQUERING\r\n    THEM—THE AUTHOR TAKES HIS LAST LEAVE OF THE READER; PROPOSES\r\n    HIS MANNER OF LIVING FOR THE FUTURE; GIVES GOOD ADVICE, AND\r\n    CONCLUDES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThus gentle reader, I have given thee a faithful history of my travels\r\nfor sixteen years and above seven months; wherein I have not been so\r\nstudious of ornament as of truth. I could perhaps, like others, have\r\nastonished thee with strange improbable tales; but I rather chose to\r\nrelate plain matter of fact in the simplest manner and style, because my\r\nprincipal design was to inform, and not to amuse thee.\r\n\r\nIt is easy for us to travel into remote countries, which are seldom\r\nvisited by Englishmen or other Europeans, to form descriptions of\r\nwonderful animals both at sea and land. Whereas a traveler’s chief aim\r\nshould be to make men wiser and better, and to improve their minds by the\r\nbad, as well as good example, of what they deliver concerning foreign\r\nplaces.\r\n\r\nI could heartily wish a law was enacted, that every traveler, before\r\nhe were permitted to publish his voyages, should be obliged to make\r\noath before the lord high chancellor, that all he intended to print\r\nwas absolutely true to the best of his knowledge; for then the world\r\nwould no longer be deceived, as it usually is, while some writers, to\r\nmake their works pass the better upon the public, impose the grossest\r\nfalsities on the unwary reader. I have perused several books of travels\r\nwith great delight in my younger days; but having since gone over most\r\nparts of the globe, and been able to contradict many fabulous accounts\r\nfrom my own observation, it has given me a great disgust against this\r\npart of reading, and some indignation to see the credulity of mankind so\r\nimpudently abused. Therefore, since my acquaintance were pleased to think\r\nmy poor endeavors might not be unacceptable to my country, I imposed on\r\nmyself as a maxim never to be swerved from, that I would strictly adhere\r\nto truth; neither indeed can I be ever under the least temptation to vary\r\nfrom it, while I retain in my mind the lectures and example of my noble\r\nmaster and the other illustrious Houyhnhnms of whom I had so long the\r\nhonor to be a humble hearer.\r\n\r\n    _... Nec si miserum Fortuna Sinonem_\r\n    _Finxit, vanum etiam, mendacemque improba finget._\r\n\r\nI know very well, how little reputation is to be got by writings which\r\nrequire neither genius nor learning, nor indeed any other talent except\r\na good memory, or an exact journal. I know likewise, that writers of\r\ntravels, like dictionary-makers, are sunk into oblivion by the weight\r\nand bulk of those who come after, and therefore lie uppermost. As it\r\nis highly probable, that such travelers who shall hereafter visit the\r\ncountries described in this work of mine, may, by detecting my errors (if\r\nthere be any), and adding many new discoveries of their own, jostle me\r\nout of vogue, and stand in my place, making the world forget that I was\r\never an author. This indeed would be too great a mortification, if I\r\nwrote for fame; but as my sole intention was the public good, I cannot be\r\naltogether disappointed. For who can read of the virtues I have mentioned\r\nin the glorious Houyhnhnms, without being ashamed of his own vices, when\r\nhe considers himself as the reasoning, governing animal of his country?\r\nI shall say nothing of those remote nations where the _yahoos_ preside;\r\namong which the least corrupted are the Brobdingnagians, whose wise\r\nmaxims in morality and government it would be our happiness to observe.\r\nBut I forbear descanting farther, and rather leave the judicious reader\r\nto his own remarks and application.\r\n\r\nI am not a little pleased that this work of mine can possibly meet\r\nwith no censurers; for what objections can be made against a writer\r\nwho relates only plain facts that happened in such distant countries,\r\nwhere we have not the least interest with respect either to trade or\r\nnegotiations? I have carefully avoided every fault with which common\r\nwriters of travels are often too justly charged. Besides, I meddle not\r\nwith any party, but write without passion, prejudice, or ill will against\r\nany man, or number of men whatsoever. I write for the noblest end, to\r\ninform and instruct mankind; over whom I may, without breach of modesty,\r\npretend to some superiority, from the advantages I received by conversing\r\nso long among the most accomplished Houyhnhnms. I write without any view\r\nto profit or praise. I never suffer a word to pass that may look like\r\nreflection, or possibly give the least offense, even to those who are\r\nmost ready to take it. So that I hope I may with justice pronounce myself\r\nan author perfectly blameless; against whom the tribes of answerers,\r\nconsiderers, observers, reflectors, detecters, remarkers, will never be\r\nable to find matter for exercising their talents.\r\n\r\nI confess, it was whispered to me that I was bound in duty, as a subject\r\nof England, to have given in a memorial to a secretary of state at my\r\nfirst coming over; because whatever lands are discovered by a subject,\r\nbelong to the crown. But I doubt whether our conquests in the countries I\r\ntreat of, would be as easy as those of Ferdinando Cortez over the naked\r\nAmericans. The Lilliputians, I think, are hardly worth the charge of a\r\nfleet and an army to reduce them; and I question whether it might be\r\nprudent or safe to attempt the Brobdingnagians; or whether an English\r\narmy would be much at their ease with the Flying Island over their\r\nheads. The Houyhnhnms indeed appear not to be so well prepared for war,\r\na science to which they are perfect strangers, and especially against\r\nmissive weapons. However, supposing myself to be a minister of state, I\r\ncould never give my advice for invading them. Their prudence, unanimity,\r\nunacquaintedness with fear, and their love of their country, would amply\r\nsupply all defects in the military art. Imagine twenty thousand of them\r\nbreaking into the midst of a European army, confounding the ranks,\r\noverturning the carriages, battering the warriors’ faces into mummy by\r\nterrible yerks from their hinder hoofs; for they would well deserve the\r\ncharacter given to Augustus, _Recalcitrat undique tutus_. But instead\r\nof proposals for conquering that magnanimous nation, I rather wish they\r\nwere in a capacity, or disposition, to send a sufficient number of their\r\ninhabitants for civilizing Europe, by teaching us the first principles of\r\nhonor, justice, truth, temperance, public spirit, fortitude, chastity,\r\nfriendship, benevolence, and fidelity. The names of all which virtues are\r\nstill retained among us in most languages, and are to be met with in\r\nmodern as well as ancient authors; which I am able to assert from my own\r\nsmall reading.\r\n\r\nBut I had another reason, which made me less forward to enlarge his\r\nmajesty’s dominions by my discoveries. To say the truth, I had conceived\r\na few scruples with relation to the distributive justice of princes upon\r\nthose occasions. For instance, a crew of pirates are driven by a storm\r\nthey know not whither; at length a boy discovers land from the topmast;\r\nthey go on shore to rob and plunder; they see a harmless people; are\r\nentertained with kindness; they give the country a new name; they take\r\nformal possession of it for their king; they set up a rotten plank, or\r\na stone, for a memorial; they murder two or three dozen of the natives,\r\nbring away a couple more by force, for a sample; return home, and get\r\ntheir pardon. Here commences a new dominion, acquired with a title by\r\ndivine right. Ships are sent with the first opportunity; the natives\r\ndriven out, or destroyed; their princes tortured to discover their gold;\r\na free license given to all acts of inhumanity and lust, the earth\r\nreeking with the blood of its inhabitants; and this execrable crew of\r\nbutchers, employed in so pious an expedition, is a modern colony, sent to\r\nconvert and civilize an idolatrous and barbarous people.\r\n\r\nBut this description, I confess, does by no means affect the British\r\nnation, who may be an example to the whole world for their wisdom,\r\ncare, and justice in planting colonies; their liberal endowments for\r\nthe advancement of religion and learning; their choice of devout and\r\nable pastors to propagate Christianity; their caution in stocking their\r\nprovinces with people of sober lives and conversations from this the\r\nmother kingdom; their strict regard to the distribution of justice,\r\nin supplying the civil administration through all their colonies with\r\nofficers of the greatest abilities, utter strangers to corruption; and,\r\nto crown all, by sending the most vigilant and virtuous governors, who\r\nhave no other views than the happiness of the people over whom they\r\npreside, and the honor of the king their master.\r\n\r\nBut as those countries which I have described, do not appear to have\r\nany desire of being conquered and enslaved, murdered or driven out, by\r\ncolonies; nor abound either in gold, silver, sugar, or tobacco; I did\r\nhumbly conceive, they were by no means proper objects of our zeal, our\r\nvalor or our interest. However, if those whom it more concerns think fit\r\nto be of another opinion, I am ready to depose, when I shall be lawfully\r\ncalled, that no European did ever visit those countries before me. I\r\nmean, if the inhabitants ought to be believed, unless a dispute may arise\r\nconcerning the two _yahoos_, said to have been seen many years ago upon\r\na mountain in Houyhnhnmland, whence the opinion is, that the race of\r\nthose brutes has descended; and these, for anything I know, may have been\r\nEnglish. This, indeed, I was apt to suspect from the lineaments of their\r\nposterity’s countenances, although they were much defaced. But how far\r\nthat will go toward making out a title, I leave to the learned in colony\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nBut as to the formality of taking possession in my sovereign’s name, it\r\nnever came once into my thoughts; and if it had, yet, as my affairs then\r\nstood, I should perhaps, in point of prudence and self-preservation, have\r\nput it off to a better opportunity.\r\n\r\nHaving thus answered the only objection that can ever be raised against\r\nme as a traveler, I here take a final leave of all my courteous readers,\r\nand return to enjoy my own speculations in my little garden at Redriff;\r\nto apply those excellent lessons of virtue which I learned among the\r\nHouyhnhnms; to instruct the _yahoos_ of my own family, as far as I shall\r\nfind them docile animals; to behold my figure often in a glass, and thus,\r\nif possible, habituate myself by time to tolerate the sight of a human\r\ncreature; to lament the brutality of Houyhnhnms in my own country, but\r\nalways treat their persons with respect, for the sake of my noble master,\r\nhis family, his friends, and the whole Houyhnhnm race, whom these of\r\nours have the honor to resemble in all their lineaments, however their\r\nintellectuals came to degenerate.\r\n\r\nI began last week to permit my wife to sit at dinner with me, at the\r\nfarthest end of a long table; and to answer (but with the utmost brevity)\r\nthe few questions I asked her. Yet the smell of a _yahoo_ continuing very\r\noffensive, I always keep my nose well stopped with rue, lavender, or\r\ntobacco leaves. And although it be hard for a man late in life to remove\r\nold habits, I am not altogether out of hopes, in some time, to suffer a\r\nneighbor _yahoo_ in my company, without the apprehensions I am yet under\r\nof his teeth or his claws.\r\n\r\nMy reconcilement to the _yahoo_ kind in general might not be so\r\ndifficult, if they would be content with those vices and follies only,\r\nwhich nature has entitled them to. I am not in the least provoked at the\r\nsight of a lawyer, a pickpocket, a colonel, a fool, a lord, a gamester, a\r\npolitician, a physician, an evidence, a suborner, an attorney, a traitor,\r\nor the like; this is all according to the due course of things: but when\r\nI behold a lump of deformity and diseases, both in body and mind, smitten\r\nwith pride, it immediately breaks all the measures of my patience;\r\nneither shall I be ever able to comprehend how such an animal, and such a\r\nvice, could tally together. The wise and virtuous Houyhnhnms, who abound\r\nin all the excellencies that can adorn a rational creature, have no name\r\nfor this vice in their language; which has no terms to express anything\r\nthat is evil, except those whereby they describe the detestable qualities\r\nof their _yahoos_; among which they were not able to distinguish this\r\nof pride for want of thoroughly understanding human nature, as it shows\r\nitself in other countries where that animal presides. But I, who had more\r\nexperience, could plainly observe some rudiments of it among the wild\r\n_yahoos_.\r\n\r\nBut the Houyhnhnms, who live under the government of reason, are no more\r\nproud of the good qualities they possess than I should be for not wanting\r\na leg or an arm; which no man in his wits would boast of, although he\r\nmust be miserable without them. I dwell the longer upon this subject,\r\nfrom the desire I have to make the society of an English _yahoo_ by any\r\nmeans not insupportable; and therefore I here entreat those who have any\r\ntincture of this absurd vice, that they will not presume to come in my\r\nsight.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE END",
