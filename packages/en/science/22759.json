Z----, Richard\r\nShandon mate, will start from New Prince's Docks for an unknown\r\ndestination.\"\r\n\r\nThe foregoing might have been read in the _Liverpool Herald_ of April\r\n5th, 1860. The departure of a brig is an event of little importance\r\nfor the most commercial port in England. Who would notice it in the\r\nmidst of vessels of all sorts of tonnage and nationality that six\r\nmiles of docks can hardly contain? However, from daybreak on the 6th\r\nof April a considerable crowd covered the wharfs of New Prince's\r\nDocks--the innumerable companies of sailors of the town seemed to\r\nhave met there. Workmen from the neighbouring wharfs had left their\r\nwork, merchants their dark counting-houses, tradesmen their shops.\r\nThe different-coloured omnibuses that ran along the exterior wall\r\nof the docks brought cargoes of spectators at every moment; the town\r\nseemed to have but one pre-occupation, and that was to see the\r\n_Forward_ go out.\r\n\r\nThe _Forward_ was a vessel of a hundred and seventy tons, charged\r\nwith a screw and steam-engine of a hundred and twenty horse-power.\r\nIt might easily have been confounded with the other brigs in the port.\r\nBut though it offered nothing curious to the eyes of the public,\r\nconnoisseurs remarked certain peculiarities in it that a sailor\r\ncannot mistake. On board the _Nautilus_, anchored at a little distance,\r\na group of sailors were hazarding a thousand conjectures about the\r\ndestination of the _Forward_.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know what to think about its masting,\" said one; \"it isn't\r\nusual for steamboats to have so much sail.\"\r\n\r\n\"That ship,\" said a quartermaster with a big red face--\"that ship\r\nwill have to depend more on her masts than her engine, and the topsails\r\nare the biggest because the others will be often useless. I haven't\r\ngot the slightest doubt that the _Forward_ is destined for the Arctic\r\nor Antarctic seas, where the icebergs stop the wind more than is good\r\nfor a brave and solid ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must be right, Mr. Cornhill,\" said a third sailor. \"Have you\r\nnoticed her stern, how straight it falls into the sea?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said the quartermaster, \"and it is furnished with a steel\r\ncutter as sharp as a razor and capable of cutting a three-decker in\r\ntwo if the _Forward_ were thrown across her at top speed.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's certain,\" said a Mersey pilot; \"for that 'ere vessel runs\r\nher fourteen knots an hour with her screw. It was marvellous to see\r\nher cutting the tide when she made her trial trip. I believe you,\r\nshe's a quick un.\"\r\n\r\n\"The canvas isn't intricate either,\" answered Mr. Cornhill; \"it goes\r\nstraight before the wind, and can be managed by hand. That ship is\r\ngoing to try the Polar seas, or my name isn't what it is. There's\r\nsomething else--do you see the wide helm-port that the head of her\r\nhelm goes through?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's there, sure enough,\" answered one; \"but what does that prove?\"\r\n\r\n\"That proves, my boys,\" said Mr. Cornhill with disdainful\r\nsatisfaction, \"that you don't know how to put two and two together\r\nand make it four; it proves that they want to be able to take off\r\nthe helm when they like, and you know it's a manoeuvre that's often\r\nnecessary when you have ice to deal with.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's certain,\" answered the crew of the _Nautilus_.\r\n\r\n\"Besides,\" said one of them, \"the way she's loaded confirms Mr.\r\nCornhill's opinion. Clifton told me. The _Forward_ is victualled and\r\ncarries coal enough for five or six years. Coals and victuals are\r\nall its cargo, with a stock of woollen garments and sealskins.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said the quartermaster, \"there is no more doubt on the matter;\r\nbut you, who know Clifton, didn't he tell you anything about her\r\ndestination?\"\r\n\r\n\"He couldn't tell me; he doesn't know; the crew was engaged without\r\nknowing. He'll only know where he's going when he gets there.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shouldn't wonder if they were going to the devil,\" said an\r\nunbeliever: \"it looks like it.\"\r\n\r\n\"And such pay,\" said Clifton's friend, getting warm--\"five times more\r\nthan the ordinary pay. If it hadn't been for that, Richard Shandon\r\nwouldn't have found a soul to go with him. A ship with a queer shape,\r\ngoing nobody knows where, and looking more like not coming back than\r\nanything else, it wouldn't have suited this child.\"\r\n\r\n\"Whether it would have suited you or not,\" answered Cornhill, \"you\r\ncouldn't have been one of the crew of the _Forward_.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why, pray?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because you don't fulfil the required conditions. I read that all\r\nmarried men were excluded, and you are in the category, so you needn't\r\ntalk. Even the very name of the ship is a bold one. The\r\n_Forward_--where is it to be forwarded to? Besides, nobody knows who\r\nthe captain is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, they do,\" said a simple-faced young sailor.\r\n\r\n\"Why, you don't mean to say that you think Shandon is the captain\r\nof the _Forward_?\" said Cornhill.\r\n\r\n\"But----\" answered the young sailor--\r\n\r\n\"Why, Shandon is commander, and nothing else; he's a brave and bold\r\nsailor, an experienced whaler, and a jolly fellow worthy in every\r\nrespect to be the captain, but he isn't any more captain than you\r\nor I. As to who is going to command after God on board he doesn't\r\nknow any more than we do. When the moment has come the true captain\r\nwill appear, no one knows how nor where, for Richard Shandon has not\r\nsaid and hasn't been allowed to say to what quarter of the globe he\r\nis going to direct his ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Mr. Cornhill,\" continued the young sailor, \"I assure you that\r\nthere is someone on board who was announced in the letter, and that\r\nMr. Shandon was offered the place of second to.\"\r\n\r\n\"What!\" said Cornhill, frowning, \"do you mean to maintain that the\r\n_Forward_ has a captain on board?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Mr. Cornhill.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where did you get your precious information from?\"\r\n\r\n\"From Johnson, the boatswain.\"\r\n\r\n\"From Johnson?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Johnson told you so?\"\r\n\r\n\"He not only told me so, but he showed me the captain.\"\r\n\r\n\"He showed him to you!\" said Cornhill, stupefied. \"And who is it,\r\npray?\"\r\n\r\n\"A dog.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by a dog?\"\r\n\r\n\"A dog on four legs.\"\r\n\r\nStupefaction reigned amongst the crew of the _Nautilus_. Under any\r\nother circumstances they would have burst out laughing. A dog captain\r\nof a vessel of a hundred and seventy tons burden! It was enough to\r\nmake them laugh. But really the _Forward_ was such an extraordinary\r\nship that they felt it might be no laughing matter, and they must\r\nbe sure before they denied it. Besides, Cornhill himself didn't laugh.\r\n\r\n\"So Johnson showed you the new sort of captain, did he?\" added he,\r\naddressing the young sailor, \"and you saw him?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, as plainly as I see you now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, and what do you think about it?\" asked the sailors of the\r\nquartermaster.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think anything,\" he answered shortly. \"I don't think anything,\r\nexcept that the _Forward_ is a ship belonging to the devil, or madmen\r\nfit for nothing but Bedlam.\"\r\n\r\nThe sailors continued silently watching the _Forward_, whose\r\npreparations for departure were drawing to an end; there was not one\r\nof them who pretended that Johnson had only been laughing at the young\r\nsailor. The history of the dog had already made the round of the town,\r\nand amongst the crowd of spectators many a one looked out for the\r\ndog-captain and believed him to be a supernatural animal. Besides,\r\nthe _Forward_ had been attracting public attention for some months\r\npast. Everything about her was marvellous; her peculiar shape, the\r\nmystery which surrounded her, the incognito kept by the captain, the\r\nway Richard Shandon had received the proposition to direct her, the\r\ncareful selection of the crew, her unknown destination, suspected\r\nonly by a few--all about her was strange.\r\n\r\nTo a thinker, dreamer, or philosopher nothing is more affecting than\r\nthe departure of a ship; his imagination plays round the sails, sees\r\nher struggles with the sea and the wind in the adventurous journey\r\nwhich does not always end in port; when in addition to the ordinary\r\nincidents of departure there are extraordinary ones, even minds\r\nlittle given to credulity let their imagination run wild.\r\n\r\nSo it was with the _Forward_, and though the generality of people\r\ncould not make the knowing remarks of Quartermaster Cornhill, it did\r\nnot prevent the ship forming the subject of Liverpool gossip for three\r\nlong months. The ship had been put in dock at Birkenhead, on the\r\nopposite side of the Mersey. The builders, Scott and Co., amongst\r\nthe first in England, had received an estimate and detailed plan from\r\nRichard Shandon; it informed them of the exact tonnage, dimensions,\r\nand store room that the brig was to have. They saw by the details\r\ngiven that they had to do with a consummate seaman. As Shandon had\r\nconsiderable funds at his disposal, the work advanced rapidly,\r\naccording to the recommendation of the owner. The brig was constructed\r\nof a solidity to withstand all tests; it was evident that she was\r\ndestined to resist enormous pressure, for her ribs were built of\r\nteak-wood, a sort of Indian oak, remarkable for its extreme hardness,\r\nand were, besides, plated with iron. Sailors asked why the hull of\r\na vessel made so evidently for resistance was not built of sheet-iron\r\nlike other steamboats, and were told it was because the mysterious\r\nengineer had his own reasons for what he did.\r\n\r\nLittle by little the brig grew on the stocks, and her qualities of\r\nstrength and delicacy struck connoisseurs. As the sailors of the\r\n_Nautilus_ had remarked, her stern formed a right angle with her keel;\r\nher steel prow, cast in the workshop of R. Hawthorn, of Newcastle,\r\nshone in the sun and gave a peculiar look to the brig, though otherwise\r\nshe had nothing particularly warlike about her. However, a 16-pounder\r\ncannon was installed on the forecastle; it was mounted on a pivot,\r\nso that it might easily be turned in any direction; but neither the\r\ncannon nor the stern, steel-clad as they were, succeeded in looking\r\nwarlike.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of February, 1860, this strange vessel was launched in\r\nthe midst of an immense concourse of spectators, and the trial trip\r\nwas perfectly successful. But if the brig was neither a man-of-war,\r\na merchant vessel, nor a pleasure yacht--for a pleasure trip is not\r\nmade with six years' provisions in the hold--what was it? Was it a\r\nvessel destined for another Franklin expedition? It could not be,\r\nbecause in 1859, the preceding year, Captain McClintock had returned\r\nfrom the Arctic seas, bringing the certain proof of the loss of the\r\nunfortunate expedition. Was the _Forward_ going to attempt the famous\r\nNorth-West passage? What would be the use? Captain McClure had\r\ndiscovered it in 1853, and his lieutenant, Creswell, was the first\r\nwho had the honour of rounding the American continent from Behring's\r\nStraits to Davis's Straits. Still it was certain to competent judges\r\nthat the _Forward_ was prepared to face the ice regions. Was it going\r\nto the South Pole, farther than the whaler Weddell or Captain James\r\nRoss? But, if so, what for?\r\n\r\nThe day after the brig was floated her engine was sent from Hawthorn's\r\nfoundry at Newcastle. It was of a hundred and twenty horse-power,\r\nwith oscillating cylinders, taking up little room; its power was\r\nconsiderable for a hundred-and-seventy-ton brig, with so much sail,\r\ntoo, and of such fleetness. Her trial trips had left no doubt on that\r\nsubject, and even the boatswain, Johnson, had thought right to express\r\nhis opinion to Clifton's friend--\r\n\r\n\"When the _Forward_ uses her engine and sails at the same time, her\r\nsails will make her go the quickest.\"\r\n\r\nClifton's friend did not understand him, but he thought anything\r\npossible of a ship commanded by a dog. After the engine was installed\r\non board, the stowage of provisions began. This was no slight work,\r\nfor the vessel was to carry enough for six years. They consisted of\r\ndry and salted meat, smoked fish, biscuit, and flour; mountains of\r\ntea and coffee were thrown down the shafts in perfect avalanches.\r\nRichard Shandon presided over the management of this precious cargo\r\nlike a man who knows what he is about; all was stowed away, ticketed,\r\nand numbered in perfect order; a very large provision of the Indian\r\npreparation called pemmican, which contains many nutritive elements\r\nin a small volume, was also embarked. The nature of the provisions\r\nleft no doubt about the length of the cruise, and the sight of the\r\nbarrels of lime-juice, lime-drops, packets of mustard, grains of\r\nsorrel and _cochlearia_, all antiscorbutic, confirmed the opinion\r\non the destination of the brig for the ice regions; their influence\r\nis so necessary in Polar navigation. Shandon had doubtless received\r\nparticular instructions about this part of the cargo, which, along\r\nwith the medicine-chest, he attended to particularly.\r\n\r\nAlthough arms were not numerous on board, the powder-magazine\r\noverflowed. The one cannon could not pretend to use the contents.\r\nThat gave people more to think about. There were also gigantic saws\r\nand powerful instruments, such as levers, leaden maces, handsaws,\r\nenormous axes, etc., without counting a considerable quantity of\r\nblasting cylinders, enough to blow up the Liverpool Customs--all that\r\nwas strange, not to say fearful, without mentioning rockets, signals,\r\npowder-chests, and beacons of a thousand different sorts. The\r\nnumerous spectators on the wharfs of Prince's Docks admired likewise\r\na long mahogany whaler, a tin _pirogue_ covered with gutta-percha,\r\nand a certain quantity of halkett-boats, a sort of indiarubber cloaks\r\nthat can be transformed into canoes by blowing in their lining.\r\nExpectation was on the _qui vive_, for the _Forward_ was going out\r\nwith the tide.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nAN UNEXPECTED LETTER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe letter received by Richard Shandon, eight months before, ran as\r\nfollows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \"ABERDEEN,\r\n\r\n                         \"August 2nd, 1859.\r\n\r\n\"To Mr. Richard Shandon,\r\n\r\n          \"Liverpool.\r\n\r\n\"SIR,--I beg to advise you that the sum of sixteen thousand pounds\r\nsterling has been placed in the hands of Messrs. Marcuart and Co.,\r\nbankers, of Liverpool. I join herewith a series of cheques, signed\r\nby me, which will allow you to draw upon the said Messrs. Marcuart\r\nfor the above-mentioned sum. You do not know me, but that is of no\r\nconsequence. I know you: that is sufficient. I offer you the place\r\nof second on board the brig _Forward_ for a voyage that may be long\r\nand perilous. If you agree to my conditions you will receive a salary\r\nof 500 pounds, and all through the voyage it will be augmented\r\none-tenth at the end of each year. The _Forward_ is not yet in\r\nexistence. You must have it built so as to be ready for sea at the\r\nbeginning of April, 1860, at the latest. Herewith is a detailed plan\r\nand estimate. You will take care that it is scrupulously followed.\r\nThe ship is to be built by Messrs. Scott and Co., who will settle\r\nwith you. I particularly recommend you the choice of the _Forward's_\r\ncrew; it will be composed of a captain, myself, of a second, you,\r\nof a third officer, a boatswain, two engineers, an ice pilot, eight\r\nsailors, and two others, eighteen men in all, comprising Dr. Clawbonny,\r\nof this town, who will introduce himself to you when necessary. The\r\n_Forward's_ crew must be composed of Englishmen without incumbrance;\r\nthey should be all bachelors and sober--for no spirits, nor even beer,\r\nwill be allowed on board--ready to undertake anything, and to bear\r\nwith anything. You will give the preference to men of a sanguine\r\nconstitution, as they carry a greater amount of animal heat. Offer\r\nthem five times the usual pay, with an increase of one-tenth for each\r\nyear of service. At the end of the voyage five hundred pounds will\r\nbe placed at the disposition of each, and two thousand at yours. These\r\nfunds will be placed with Messrs. Marcuart and Co. The voyage will\r\nbe long and difficult, but honourable, so you need not hesitate to\r\naccept my conditions. Be good enough to send your answer to K. Z.,\r\nPoste Restante, Goteborg, Sweden.\r\n\r\n\"P.S.--On the 15th of February next you will receive a large Danish\r\ndog, with hanging lips, and tawny coat with black stripes. You will\r\ntake it on board and have it fed with oaten bread, mixed with tallow\r\ngrease. You will acknowledge the reception of the said dog to me under\r\nthe same initials as above, Poste Restante, Leghorn, Italy.\r\n\r\n\"The captain of the _Forward_ will introduce himself to you when\r\nnecessary. When you are ready to start you will receive further\r\ninstructions.\r\n\r\n                              \"THE CAPTAIN OF THE 'FORWARD,'\r\n\r\n                                                         \"K. Z.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nDR. CLAWBONNY\r\n\r\n\r\nRichard Shandon was a good sailor; he had been commander of whalers\r\nin the Arctic seas for many years, and had a wide reputation for skill.\r\nHe might well be astonished at such a letter, and so he was, but\r\nastonished like a man used to astonishments. He fulfilled, too, all\r\nthe required conditions: he had no wife, children, or relations; he\r\nwas as free as a man could be. Having no one to consult, he went straight\r\nto Messrs. Marcuart's bank.\r\n\r\n\"If the money is there,\" he said to himself, \"I'll undertake the rest.\"\r\n\r\nHe was received by the firm with all the attention due to a man with\r\nsixteen thousand pounds in their safes. Sure of that fact, Shandon\r\nasked for a sheet of letter-paper, and sent his acceptance in a large\r\nsailor's hand to the address indicated. The same day he put himself\r\nin communication with the Birkenhead shipbuilders, and twenty-four\r\nhours later the keel of the _Forward_ lay on the stocks in the\r\ndockyard.\r\n\r\nRichard Shandon was a bachelor of forty, robust, energetic, and brave,\r\nthree sailor-like qualities, giving their possessor confidence,\r\nvigour, and _sang-froid_. He was reputed jealous and hard to be\r\npleased, so he was more feared than loved by his sailors. But this\r\nreputation did not increase the difficulty of finding a crew, for\r\nhe was known to be a clever commander. He was afraid that the mystery\r\nof the enterprise would embarrass his movements, and he said to\r\nhimself, \"The best thing I can do is to say nothing at all; there\r\nare sea-dogs who will want to know the why and the wherefore of the\r\nbusiness, and as I know nothing myself, I can't tell them. K. Z. is\r\na queer fish, but after all he knows me, and has confidence in me;\r\nthat's enough. As to the ship, she will be a handsome lass, and my\r\nname isn't Richard Shandon if she is not destined for the Frozen Seas.\r\nBut I shall keep that to myself and my officers.\"\r\n\r\nUpon which Richard Shandon set about recruiting his crew upon the\r\nconditions of family and health exacted by the captain. He knew a\r\nbrave fellow and capital sailor, named James Wall. Wall was about\r\nthirty, and had made more than one trip to the North Seas. Shandon\r\noffered him the post of third officer, and he accepted blindly; all\r\nhe cared for was to sail, as he was devoted to his profession. Shandon\r\ntold him and Johnson (whom he engaged as boatswain) all he knew about\r\nthe business.\r\n\r\n\"Just as soon go there as anywhere else,\" answered Wall. \"If it's\r\nto seek the North-West passage, many have been and come back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Been, yes; but come back I don't answer for,\" said Johnson; \"but\r\nthat's no reason for not going.\"\r\n\r\n\"Besides, if we are not mistaken in our conjectures,\" said Shandon,\r\n\"the voyage will be undertaken under good conditions. The _Forward's_\r\na bonny lass, with a good engine, and will stand wear and tear.\r\nEighteen men are all the crew we want.\"\r\n\r\n\"Eighteen men?\" said Johnson. \"That's just the number that the\r\nAmerican, Kane, had on board when he made his famous voyage towards\r\nthe North Pole.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a singular fact that there's always some private individual\r\ntrying to cross the sea from Davis's Straits to Behring's Straits.\r\nThe Franklin expeditions have already cost England more than seven\r\nhundred and sixty thousand pounds without producing any practical\r\nresult. Who the devil means to risk his fortune in such an enterprise?\"\r\n\r\n\"We are reasoning now on a simple hypothesis,\" said Shandon. \"I don't\r\nknow if we are really going to the Northern or Southern Seas. Perhaps\r\nwe are going on a voyage of discovery. We shall know more when Dr.\r\nClawbonny comes; I daresay he will tell us all about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's nothing for it but to wait,\" answered Johnson; \"I'll go and\r\nhunt up some solid subjects, captain; and as to their animal heat,\r\nI guarantee beforehand you can trust me for that.\"\r\n\r\nJohnson was a valuable acquisition; he understood the navigation of\r\nthese high latitudes. He was quartermaster on board the _Phoenix_,\r\none of the vessels of the Franklin expedition of 1853. He was witness\r\nof the death of the French lieutenant Bellot, whom he had accompanied\r\nin his expedition across the ice. Johnson knew the maritime population\r\nof Liverpool, and started at once on his recruiting expedition.\r\nShandon, Wall, and he did their work so well that the crew was complete\r\nin the beginning of December. It had been a difficult task; many,\r\ntempted by the high pay, felt frightened at the risk, and more than\r\none enlisted boldly who came afterwards to take back his word and\r\nenlistment money, dissuaded by his friends from undertaking such an\r\nenterprise. All of them tried to pierce the mystery, and worried\r\nShandon with questions; he sent them to Johnson.\r\n\r\n\"I can't tell you what I don't know,\" he answered invariably; \"you'll\r\nbe in good company, that's all I can tell you. You can take it or\r\nleave it alone.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the greater number took it.\r\n\r\n\"I have only to choose,\" added the boatswain; \"such salary has never\r\nbeen heard of in the memory of sailors, and then the certainty of\r\nfinding a handsome capital when we come back. Only think: it's\r\ntempting enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"The fact is,\" answered the sailor, \"it is tempting; enough to live\r\non till the end of one's days.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't hide from you,\" continued Johnson, \"that the cruise will\r\nbe long, painful, and perilous; that is formally stated in our\r\ninstructions, and you ought to know what you undertake; you will very\r\nlikely be required to attempt all that it is possible for human beings\r\nto do, and perhaps more. If you are the least bit frightened, if you\r\ndon't think you may just as well finish yonder as here, you'd better\r\nnot enlist, but give way to a bolder man.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, Mr. Johnson,\" continued the sailor, for the want of something\r\nbetter to say, \"at least you know the captain?\"\r\n\r\n\"The captain is Richard Shandon till another comes.\"\r\n\r\nRichard Shandon, in his secret heart, hoped that the command would\r\nremain with him, and that at the last moment he should receive precise\r\ninstructions as to the destination of the _Forward_. He did all he\r\ncould to spread the report in his conversations with his officers,\r\nor when following the construction of the brig as it grew in the\r\nBirkenhead dockyard, looking like the ribs of a whale turned upside\r\ndown. Shandon and Johnson kept strictly to their instructions\r\ntouching the health of the sailors who were to form the crew; they\r\nall looked hale and hearty, and had enough heat in their bodies to\r\nsuffice for the engine of the _Forward_; their supple limbs, their\r\nclear and florid complexions were fit to react against the action\r\nof intense cold. They were confident and resolute men, energetically\r\nand solidly constituted. Of course they were not all equally vigorous;\r\nShandon had even hesitated about taking some of them, such as the\r\nsailors Gripper and Garry, and the harpooner Simpson, because they\r\nlooked rather thin; but, on the whole, their build was good; they\r\nwere a warm-hearted lot, and their engagement was signed.\r\n\r\nAll the crew belonged to the same sect of the Protestant religion;\r\nduring these long campaigns prayer in common and the reading of the\r\nBible have a good influence over the men and sustain them in the hour\r\nof discouragement; it was therefore important that they should be\r\nall of the same way of thinking. Shandon knew by experience the utility\r\nof these practices, and their influence on the mind of the crew; they\r\nare always employed on board ships that are intended to winter in\r\nthe Polar Seas. The crew once got together, Shandon and his two\r\nofficers set about the provisions; they strictly followed the\r\ninstructions of the captain; these instructions were clear, precise,\r\nand detailed, and the least articles were put down with their quality\r\nand quantity. Thanks to the cheques at the commander's disposition,\r\nevery article was paid for at once with a discount of 8 per cent,\r\nwhich Richard carefully placed to the credit of K. Z.\r\n\r\nCrew, provisions, and cargo were ready by January, 1860; the _Forward_\r\nbegan to look shipshape, and Shandon went daily to Birkenhead. On\r\nthe morning of the 23rd of January he was, as usual, on board one\r\nof the Mersey ferry-boats with a helm at either end to prevent having\r\nto turn it; there was a thick fog, and the sailors of the river were\r\nobliged to direct their course by means of the compass, though the\r\npassage lasts scarcely ten minutes. But the thickness of the fog did\r\nnot prevent Shandon seeing a man of short stature, rather fat, with\r\nan intelligent and merry face and an amiable look, who came up to\r\nhim, took him by the two hands, and shook them with an ardour, a\r\npetulance, and a familiarity \"quite meridional,\" as a Frenchman would\r\nhave said. But if this person did not come from the South, he had\r\ngot his temperament there; he talked and gesticulated with\r\nvolubility; his thought must come out or the machine would burst.\r\nHis eyes, small as those of witty men generally are, his mouth, large\r\nand mobile, were safety-pipes which allowed him to give passage to\r\nhis overflowing thoughts; he talked, and talked, and talked so much\r\nand so fast that Shandon couldn't understand a word he said. However,\r\nthis did not prevent the _Forward's_ mate from recognising the little\r\nman he had never seen before; a lightning flash traversed his mind,\r\nand when the other paused to take breath, Shandon made haste to get\r\nout the words, \"Doctor Clawbonny!\"\r\n\r\n\"Himself in person, commander! I've been at least half a quarter of\r\nan hour looking for you, asking everybody everywhere! Just think how\r\nimpatient I got; five minutes more and I should have lost my head!\r\nAnd so you are the commander Richard? You really exist? You are not\r\na myth? Your hand, your hand! I want to shake it again. It is Richard\r\nShandon's hand, and if there is a commander Shandon, there's a brig\r\n_Forward_ to command; and if he commands he will start, and if he\r\nstarts he'll take Dr. Clawbonny on board.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, yes, doctor, I am Richard Shandon; there is a brig _Forward_,\r\nand it will start.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's logic,\" answered the doctor, after taking in a large provision\r\nof breathing air--\"that's logic. And I am ready to jump for joy at\r\nhaving my dearest wishes gratified. I've wanted to undertake such\r\na voyage. Now with you, commander----\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't----\" began Shandon.\r\n\r\n\"With you,\" continued Clawbonny, without hearing him, \"we are sure\r\nto go far and not to draw back for a trifle.\"\r\n\r\n\"But----\" began Shandon again.\r\n\r\n\"For you have shown what you are made of, commander; I know your deeds\r\nof service. You are a fine sailor!\"\r\n\r\n\"If you will allow me----\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I won't have your bravery, audacity, and skill put an instant\r\nin doubt, even by you! The captain who chose you for his mate is a\r\nman who knows what he's about, I can tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"But that's nothing to do with it,\" said Shandon, impatient.\r\n\r\n\"What is it, then? Don't keep me in suspense another minute.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't give me time to speak. Tell me, if you please, doctor,\r\nhow it comes that you are to take part in the expedition of the\r\n_Forward_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Read this letter, this worthy letter, the letter of a brave\r\ncaptain--very laconic, but quite sufficient.\"\r\n\r\nSaying which the doctor held out the following letter to Shandon:--\r\n\r\n\r\n                    \"INVERNESS,\r\n\r\n                         \"Jan. 22nd, 1860.\r\n\r\n\"To Dr. Clawbonny.\r\n\r\n\"If Dr. Clawbonny wishes to embark on board the _Forward_ for a long\r\ncruise, he may introduce himself to the commander, Richard Shandon,\r\nwho has received orders concerning him.\r\n\r\n                              \"THE CAPTAIN OF THE 'FORWARD,'\r\n\r\n                                                         \"K. Z.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"This letter reached me this morning, and here I am, ready to embark.\"\r\n\r\n\"But, doctor, do you know where we are going to?\"\r\n\r\n\"I haven't the slightest idea, and I do not care so that it is somewhere.\r\nThey pretend that I am learned; they are mistaken, commander. I know\r\nnothing, and if I have published a few books that don't sell badly,\r\nI ought not to have done it; the public is silly for buying them.\r\nI know nothing, I tell you. I am only an ignorant man. When I have\r\nthe offer of completing, or rather of going over again, my knowledge\r\nof medicine, surgery, history, geography, botany, mineralogy,\r\nconchology, geodesy, chemistry, natural philosophy, mechanics, and\r\nhydrography, why I accept, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said Shandon, disappointed, \"you do not know where the\r\n_Forward_ is bound for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I do; it is bound for where there is something to learn, to\r\ndiscover, and to compare--where we shall meet with other customs,\r\nother countries, other nations, to study in the exercise of their\r\nfunctions; it is going, in short, where I have never been.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I want to know something more definite than that,\" cried Shandon.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I have heard that we are bound for the Northern Seas.\"\r\n\r\n\"At least,\" asked Shandon, \"you know the captain?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not the least bit in the world! But he is an honest fellow, you may\r\nbelieve me.\"\r\n\r\nThe commander and the doctor disembarked at Birkenhead; the former\r\ntold the doctor all he knew about the situation of things, and the\r\nmystery inflamed the imagination of the doctor. The sight of the brig\r\ncaused him transports of joy. From that day he stopped with Shandon,\r\nand went every day to pay a visit to the shell of the _Forward_. Besides,\r\nhe was specially appointed to overlook the installation of the ship's\r\nmedicine-chest. For Dr. Clawbonny was a doctor, and a good one, though\r\npractising little. At the age of twenty-five he was an ordinary\r\npractitioner; at the age of forty he was a _savant_, well known in\r\nthe town; he was an influential member of all the literary and\r\nscientific institutions of Liverpool. His fortune allowed him to\r\ndistribute counsels which were none the worse for being gratuitous;\r\nbeloved as a man eminently lovable must always be, he had never wronged\r\nany one, not even himself; lively and talkative, he carried his heart\r\nin his hand, and put his hand into that of everybody. When it was\r\nknown in Liverpool that he was going to embark on board the _Forward_\r\nhis friends did all they could to dissuade him, and only fixed him\r\nmore completely in his determination, and when the doctor was\r\ndetermined to do anything no one could prevent him. From that time\r\nthe suppositions and apprehensions increased, but did not prevent\r\nthe _Forward_ being launched on the 5th of February, 1860. Two months\r\nlater she was ready to put to sea. On the 15th of March, as the letter\r\nof the captain had announced, a dog of Danish breed was sent by railway\r\nfrom Edinburgh to Liverpool, addressed to Richard Shandon. The animal\r\nseemed surly, peevish, and even sinister, with quite a singular look\r\nin his eyes. The name of the _Forward_ was engraved on his brass collar.\r\nThe commander installed it on board the same day, and acknowledged\r\nits reception to K. Z. at Leghorn. Thus, with the exception of the\r\ncaptain, the crew was complete. It was composed as follows:--\r\n\r\n1. K. Z., captain; 2. Richard Shandon, commander; 3. James Wall, third\r\nofficer; 4. Dr. Clawbonny; 5. Johnson, boatswain; 6. Simpson,\r\nharpooner; 7. Bell, carpenter; 8. Brunton, chief engineer; 9. Plover,\r\nsecond engineer; 10. Strong (negro), cook; 11. Foker, ice-master;\r\n12. Wolsten, smith; 13. Bolton, sailor; 14. Garry, sailor; 15. Clifton,\r\nsailor; 16. Gripper, sailor; 17. Pen, sailor; 18. Warren, stoker.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nDOG-CAPTAIN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe day of departure arrived with the 5th of April. The admission\r\nof the doctor on board had given the crew more confidence. They knew\r\nthat where the worthy doctor went they could follow. However, the\r\nsailors were still uneasy, and Shandon, fearing that some of them\r\nwould desert, wished to be off. With the coast out of sight, they\r\nwould make up their mind to the inevitable.\r\n\r\nDr. Clawbonny's cabin was situated at the end of the poop, and occupied\r\nall the stern of the vessel. The captain's and mate's cabins gave\r\nupon deck. The captain's remained hermetically closed, after being\r\nfurnished with different instruments, furniture, travelling\r\ngarments, books, clothes for changing, and utensils, indicated in\r\na detailed list. According to the wish of the captain, the key of\r\nthe cabin was sent to Lubeck; he alone could enter his room.\r\n\r\nThis detail vexed Shandon, and took away all chance of the chief\r\ncommand. As to his own cabin, he had perfectly appropriated it to\r\nthe needs of the presumed voyage, for he thoroughly understood the\r\nneeds of a Polar expedition. The room of the third officer was placed\r\nunder the lower deck, which formed a vast sleeping-room for the\r\nsailors' use; the men were very comfortably lodged, and would not\r\nhave found anything like the same convenience on board any other ship;\r\nthey were cared for like the most priceless cargo: a vast stove\r\noccupied all the centre of the common room. Dr. Clawbonny was in his\r\nelement; he had taken possession of his cabin on the 6th of February,\r\nthe day after the _Forward_ was launched.\r\n\r\n\"The happiest of animals,\" he used to say, \"is a snail, for it can\r\nmake a shell exactly to fit it; I shall try to be an intelligent snail.\"\r\n\r\nAnd considering that the shell was to be his lodging for a considerable\r\ntime, the cabin began to look like home; the doctor had a _savant's_\r\nor a child's pleasure in arranging his scientific traps. His books,\r\nhis herbals, his set of pigeon-holes, his instruments of precision,\r\nhis chemical apparatus, his collection of thermometers, barometers,\r\nhygrometers, rain-gauges, spectacles, compasses, sextants, maps,\r\nplans, flasks, powders, bottles for medicine-chest, were all classed\r\nin an order that would have shamed the British Museum. The space of\r\nsix square feet contained incalculable riches: the doctor had only\r\nto stretch out his hand without moving to become instantaneously a\r\ndoctor, a mathematician, an astronomer, a geographer, a botanist,\r\nor a conchologist. It must be acknowledged that he was proud of his\r\nmanagement and happy in his floating sanctuary, which three of his\r\nthinnest friends would have sufficed to fill. His friends came to\r\nit in such numbers that even a man as easy-going as the doctor might\r\nhave said with Socrates, \"My house is small, but may it please Heaven\r\nnever to fill it with friends!\"\r\n\r\nTo complete the description of the _Forward_ it is sufficient to say\r\nthat the kennel of the large Danish dog was constructed under the\r\nwindow of the mysterious cabin but its savage inhabitant preferred\r\nwandering between decks and in the hold; it seemed impossible to tame\r\nhim, and no one had been able to become his master; during the night\r\nhe howled lamentably, making the hollows of the ship ring in a sinister\r\nfashion. Was it regret for his absent master? Was it the instinct\r\nof knowing that he was starting for a perilous voyage? Was it a\r\npresentiment of dangers to come? The sailors decided that it was for\r\nthe latter reason, and more than one pretended to joke who believed\r\nseriously that the dog was of a diabolical kind. Pen, who was a brutal\r\nman, was going to strike him once, when he fell, unfortunately,\r\nagainst the angle of the capstan, and made a frightful wound in his\r\nhead. Of course this accident was placed to the account of the\r\nfantastic animal. Clifton, the most superstitious of the crew, made\r\nthe singular observation that when the dog was on the poop he always\r\nwalked on the windward side, and afterwards, when the brig was out\r\nat sea, and altered its tack, the surprising animal changed its\r\ndirection with the wind the same as the captain of the _Forward_ would\r\nhave done in his place. Dr. Clawbonny, whose kindness and caresses\r\nwould have tamed a tiger, tried in vain to win the good graces of\r\nthe dog; he lost his time and his pains. The animal did not answer\r\nto any name ever written in the dog calendar, and the crew ended by\r\ncalling him Captain, for he appeared perfectly conversant with ship\r\ncustoms; it was evident that it was not his first trip. From such\r\nfacts it is easy to understand the boatswain's answer to Clifton's\r\nfriend, and the credulity of those who heard it; more than one repeated\r\njokingly that he expected one day to see the dog take human shape\r\nand command the manoeuvres with a resounding voice.\r\n\r\nIf Richard Shandon did not feel the same apprehensions he was not\r\nwithout anxiety, and the day before the departure, in the evening\r\nof April 5th, he had a conversation on the subject with the doctor,\r\nWall, and Johnson in the poop cabin. These four persons were tasting\r\ntheir tenth grog, and probably their last, for the letter from\r\nAberdeen had ordered that all the crew, from the captain to the stoker,\r\nshould be teetotallers, and that there should be no wine, beer, nor\r\nspirits on board except those given by the doctor's orders. The\r\nconversation had been going on about the departure for the last hour.\r\nIf the instructions of the captain were realised to the end, Shandon\r\nwould receive his last instructions the next day.\r\n\r\n\"If the letter,\" said the commander, \"does not tell me the captain's\r\nname, it must at least tell me the destination of the brig, or I shall\r\nnot know where to take her to.\"\r\n\r\n\"If I were you,\" said the impatient doctor, \"I should start whether\r\nI get a letter or no; they'll know how to send after you, you may\r\ndepend.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are ready for anything, doctor; but if so, to what quarter of\r\nthe globe should you set sail?\"\r\n\r\n\"To the North Pole, of course; there's not the slightest doubt about\r\nthat.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should it not be the South Pole?\" asked Wall.\r\n\r\n\"The South Pole is out of the question. No one with any sense would\r\nsend a brig across the whole of the Atlantic. Just reflect a minute,\r\nand you'll see the impossibility.\"\r\n\r\n\"The doctor has an answer to everything,\" said Wall.\r\n\r\n\"Well, we'll say north,\" continued Shandon. \"But where north? To\r\nSpitzbergen or Greenland? Labrador or Hudson's Bay? Although all\r\ndirections end in insuperable icebergs, I am not less puzzled as to\r\nwhich to take. Have you an answer to that, doctor?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he answered, vexed at having nothing to say; \"but if you don't\r\nget a letter what shall you do?\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall do nothing; I shall wait.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean to say you won't start?\" cried Dr. Clawbonny, agitating\r\nhis glass in despair.\r\n\r\n\"Certainly I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that would be the wisest plan,\" said Johnson tranquilly, while\r\nthe doctor began marching round the table, for he could not keep still;\r\n\"but still, if we wait too long, the consequences may be deplorable;\r\nthe season is good now if we are really going north, as we ought to\r\nprofit by the breaking up of the ice to cross Davis's Straits; besides,\r\nthe crew gets more and more uneasy; the friends and companions of\r\nour men do all they can to persuade them to leave the _Forward_, and\r\ntheir influence may be pernicious for us.\"\r\n\r\n\"Besides,\" added Wall, \"if one of them deserted they all would, and\r\nthen I don't know how you would get another crew together.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what can I do?\" cried Shandon.\r\n\r\n\"What you said you would do,\" replied the doctor; \"wait and wait till\r\nto-morrow before you despair. The captain's promises have all been\r\nfulfilled up to now with the greatest regularity, and there's no\r\nreason to believe we shan't be made acquainted with our destination\r\nwhen the proper time comes. I haven't the slightest doubt that\r\nto-morrow we shall be sailing in the Irish Channel, and I propose\r\nwe drink a last grog to our pleasant voyage. It begins in an\r\nunaccountable fashion, but with sailors like you there are a thousand\r\nchances that it will end well.\"\r\n\r\nAnd all four drank to their safe return.\r\n\r\n\"Now, commander,\" continued Johnson, \"if you will allow me to advise\r\nyou, you will prepare everything to start; the crew must think that\r\nyou know what you are about. If you don't get a letter to-morrow,\r\nset sail; do not get up the steam, the wind looks like holding out,\r\nand it will be easy enough to sail; let the pilot come on board; go\r\nout of the docks with the tide, and anchor below Birkenhead; our men\r\nwon't be able to communicate with land, and if the devil of a letter\r\ncomes it will find us as easily there as elsewhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"By heavens! you are right, Johnson!\" cried the doctor, holding out\r\nhis hand to the old sailor.\r\n\r\n\"So be it,\" answered Shandon.\r\n\r\nThen each one entered his cabin, and waited in feverish sleep for\r\nthe rising of the sun. The next day the first distribution of letters\r\ntook place in the town, and not one bore the address of the commander,\r\nRichard Shandon. Nevertheless, he made his preparations for\r\ndeparture, and the news spread at once all over Liverpool, and, as\r\nwe have already seen, an extraordinary affluence of spectators\r\ncrowded the wharfs of New Prince's Docks. Many of them came on board\r\nto shake hands for the last time with a comrade, or to try and dissuade\r\na friend, or to take a look at the brig, and to know its destination;\r\nthey were disappointed at finding the commander more taciturn and\r\nreserved than ever. He had his reasons for that.\r\n\r\nTen o'clock struck. Eleven followed. The tide began to go out that\r\nday at about one o'clock in the afternoon. Shandon from the top of\r\nthe poop was looking at the crowd with uneasy eyes, trying to read\r\nthe secret of his destiny on one of the faces. But in vain. The sailors\r\nof the _Forward_ executed his orders in silence, looking at him all\r\nthe time, waiting for orders which did not come. Johnson went on\r\npreparing for departure. The weather was cloudy and the sea rough;\r\na south-easter blew with violence, but it was easy to get out of the\r\nMersey.\r\n\r\nAt twelve o'clock nothing had yet been received. Dr. Clawbonny marched\r\nup and down in agitation, looking through his telescope,\r\ngesticulating, impatient for the sea, as he said. He felt moved,\r\nthough he struggled against it. Shandon bit his lips till the blood\r\ncame. Johnson came up to him and said--\r\n\r\n\"Commander, if we want to profit by the tide, there is no time to\r\nbe lost; we shall not be clear of the docks for at least an hour.\"\r\n\r\nShandon looked round him once more and consulted his watch. The twelve\r\no'clock letters had been distributed. In despair he told Johnson to\r\nstart. The boatswain ordered the deck to be cleared of spectators,\r\nand the crowd made a general movement to regain the wharves while\r\nthe last moorings were unloosed. Amidst the confusion a dog's bark\r\nwas distinctly heard, and all at once the animal broke through the\r\ncompact mass, jumped on to the poop, and, as a thousand spectators\r\ncan testify, dropped a letter at Shandon's feet.\r\n\r\n\"A letter!\" cried Shandon. \"_He_ is on board, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"He was, that's certain, but he isn't now,\" said Johnson, pointing\r\nto the deserted deck.\r\n\r\nShandon held the letter without opening it in his astonishment.\r\n\r\n\"But read it, read it, I say,\" said the doctor.\r\n\r\nShandon looked at it. The envelope had no postmark or date; it was\r\naddressed simply to:\r\n\r\n\r\n                          \"RICHARD SHANDON,\r\n\r\n                    \"Commander on board the brig\r\n\r\n                             \"_Forward_.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nShandon opened the letter and read as follows:--\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Sail for Cape Farewell. You will reach it by the 20th of April. If\r\nthe captain does not appear on board, cross Davis's Straits, and sail\r\nup Baffin's Sea to Melville Bay.\r\n\r\n                              \"THE CAPTAIN OF THE 'FORWARD,'\r\n\r\n                                                         \"K. Z.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nShandon carefully folded this laconic epistle, put it in his pocket,\r\nand gave the order for departure. His voice, which rang above the\r\neast wind, had something solemn in it.\r\n\r\nSoon the _Forward_ had passed the docks, and directed by a Liverpool\r\npilot whose little cutter followed, went down the Mersey with the\r\ncurrent. The crowd precipitated itself on to the exterior wharf along\r\nthe Victoria Docks in order to get a last glimpse of the strange brig.\r\nThe two topsails, the foresail and the brigantine sail were rapidly\r\nset up, and the _Forward_, worthy of its name, after having rounded\r\nBirkenhead Point, sailed with extraordinary fleetness into the Irish\r\nSea.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nOUT AT SEA\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wind was favourable, though it blew in April gales. The _Forward_\r\ncut through the waves, and towards three o'clock crossed the mail\r\nsteamer between Liverpool and the Isle of Man. The captain hailed\r\nfrom his deck the last adieu that the _Forward_ was destined to hear.\r\n\r\nAt five o'clock the pilot left the command in the hands of Richard\r\nShandon, the commander of the brig, and regained his cutter, which,\r\nturning round, soon disappeared on the south-west. Towards evening\r\nthe brig doubled the Calf of Man at the southern extremity of the\r\nisland. During the night the sea was very rough, but the _Forward_\r\nbehaved well, left the point of Ayr to the north-west, and directed\r\nits course for the Northern Channel. Johnson was right; once out at\r\nsea the maritime instinct of the sailors gained the upper hand. Life\r\non board went on with regularity.\r\n\r\nThe doctor breathed in the sea air with delight; he walked about\r\nvigorously in the squalls, and for a _savant_ he was not a bad sailor.\r\n\r\n\"The sea is splendid,\" said he to Johnson, coming up on deck after\r\nbreakfast. \"I have made its acquaintance rather late, but I shall\r\nmake up for lost time.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right, Mr. Clawbonny. I would give all the continents of\r\nthe world for a corner of the ocean. They pretend that sailors soon\r\nget tired of their profession, but I've been forty years on the sea\r\nand I love it as much as the first day.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a great pleasure to feel a good ship under one's feet, and\r\nif I'm not a bad judge the _Forward_ behaves herself well.\"\r\n\r\n\"You judge rightly, doctor,\" answered Shandon, who had joined the\r\ntalkers; \"she is a good ship, and I acknowledge that a vessel destined\r\nfor navigation amongst ice has never been better equipped. That\r\nreminds me that thirty years ago Captain James Ross, sailing for the\r\nNorth-West passage----\"\r\n\r\n\"In the _Victory_,\" added the doctor quickly, \"a brig about the same\r\ntonnage as ours, with a steam-engine too.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! you know about that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Judge if I do,\" answered the doctor. \"Machines were then in their\r\ninfancy, and the _Victory's_ kept her back; the captain, James Ross,\r\nafter having vainly repaired it bit by bit, finished by taking it\r\ndown, and abandoned it at his first winter quarters.\"\r\n\r\n\"The devil!\" said Shandon. \"You know all about it, I see.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. I've read the works of Parry, Ross, and Franklin, and the reports\r\nof McClure, Kennedy, Kane, and McClintock, and I remember something\r\nof what I've read. I can tell you, too, that this same McClintock,\r\non board the _Fox_, a screw brig in the style of ours, went easier\r\nto his destination than any of the men who preceded him.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's perfectly true,\" answered Shandon; \"he was a bold sailor was\r\nMcClintock; I saw him at work. You may add that, like him, we shall\r\nfind ourselves in Davis's Straits in April, and if we succeed in\r\npassing the ice our voyage will be considerably advanced.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unless,\" added the doctor, \"it happens to us like it did to the _Fox_\r\nin 1857, to be caught the very first year by the ice in Baffin's Sea,\r\nand have to winter in the midst of the icebergs.\"\r\n\r\n\"We must hope for better luck,\" answered Johnson. \"If a ship like\r\nthe _Forward_ can't take us where we want to go, we must renounce\r\nall hope for ever.\"\r\n\r\n\"Besides,\" said the doctor, \"if the captain is on board he will know\r\nbetter than we do what must be done. We know nothing as yet; his letter\r\nsays nothing about what our voyage is for.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a good deal to know which way to go,\" answered Shandon quickly.\r\n\"We can do without the captain and his instructions for another month\r\nat least. Besides, you know what I think about it.\"\r\n\r\n\"A short time ago,\" said the doctor, \"I thought like you that the\r\ncaptain would never appear, and that you would remain commander of\r\nthe ship; but now----\"\r\n\r\n\"Now what?\" replied Shandon in an impatient tone.\r\n\r\n\"Since the arrival of the second letter I have modified that opinion.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, doctor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because the letter tells you the route to follow, but leaves you\r\nignorant of the _Forward's_ destination; and we must know where we\r\nare going to. How the deuce are you to get a letter now we are out\r\nat sea? On the coast of Greenland the service of the post must leave\r\nmuch to wish for. I believe that our gentleman is waiting for us in\r\nsome Danish settlement--at Holsteinborg or Uppernawik; he has\r\nevidently gone there to complete his cargo of sealskins, buy his\r\nsledges and dog, and, in short, get together all the tackle wanted\r\nfor a voyage in the Arctic Seas. I shouldn't be at all surprised to\r\nsee him come out of his cabin one of these fine mornings and begin\r\ncommanding the ship in anything but a supernatural way.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's possible,\" answered Shandon drily; \"but in the meantime the\r\nwind is getting up, and I can't risk my gallant sails in such weather.\"\r\n\r\nShandon left the doctor and gave the order to reef the topsails.\r\n\r\n\"He takes it to heart,\" said the doctor to the boatswain.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered the latter, \"and it's a great pity, for you may be\r\nright, Mr. Clawbonny.\"\r\n\r\nIn the evening of Saturday the _Forward_ doubled the Mull of Galloway,\r\nwhose lighthouse shone to the north-east; during the night they left\r\nthe Mull of Cantyre to the north, and Cape Fair, on the coast of Ireland,\r\nto the east. Towards three o'clock in the morning, the brig, leaving\r\nRathlin Island on her starboard side, disembogued by the Northern\r\nChannel into the ocean. It was Sunday, the 8th of April, and the doctor\r\nread some chapters of the Bible to the assembled seamen. The wind\r\nthen became a perfect hurricane, and tended to throw the brig on to\r\nthe Irish coast; she pitched, and rolled, and tossed, and if the doctor\r\nwas not seasick it was because he would not be, for nothing was easier.\r\nAt noon Cape Malinhead disappeared towards the south; it was the last\r\nEuropean ground that these bold sailors were to perceive, and more\r\nthan one watched it out of sight, destined never to see it again.\r\nThey were then in 55 degrees 57 minutes latitude and 7 degrees 40\r\nminutes longitude by the Greenwich meridian.\r\n\r\nThe storm spent itself out about nine o'clock in the evening; the\r\n_Forward_, like a good sailor, maintained her route north-west. She\r\nshowed by her behaviour during the day what her sailing capacities\r\nwere, and as the Liverpool connoisseurs had remarked, she was above\r\nall, a sailing vessel. During the following days the _Forward_ gained\r\nthe north-west with rapidity; the wind veered round south, and the\r\nsea had a tremendous swell on; the brig was then going along under\r\nfull sail. Some petrels and puffins came sailing over the poop; the\r\ndoctor skilfully shot one of the latter, and it fell, fortunately,\r\non the deck. The harpooner, Simpson, picked it up and brought it to\r\nits owner.\r\n\r\n\"Nasty game that, Mr. Clawbonny,\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"It will make an excellent meal, on the contrary,\" said the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean to say you are going to eat that thing?\"\r\n\r\n\"And so are you, old fellow,\" said the doctor, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"Poh!\" replied Simpson, \"but it's oily and rancid, like all other\r\nsea birds.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind!\" answered the doctor, \"I have a peculiar way of cooking\r\nthat game, and if you recognise it for a sea bird I'll consent never\r\nto kill another in my life.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you know how to cook, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"A _savant_ ought to know how to do a little of everything.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'd better take care, Simpson,\" said the boatswain; \"the doctor's\r\na clever man, and he'll make you take this puffin for a grouse.\"\r\n\r\nThe fact is that the doctor was quite right about his fowl; he took\r\noff all the fat, which all lies under the skin, principally on the\r\nthighs, and with it disappeared the rancidity and taste of fish which\r\nis so disagreeable in a sea bird. Thus prepared the puffin was declared\r\nexcellent, and Simpson acknowledged it the first.\r\n\r\nDuring the late storm Richard Shandon had been able to judge of the\r\nqualities of his crew; he had watched each man narrowly, and knew\r\nhow much each was to be depended upon.\r\n\r\nJames Wall was devoted to Richard, understood quickly and executed\r\nwell, but he might fail in initiative; he placed him in the third\r\nrank. Johnson was used to struggle with the sea; he was an old stager\r\nin the Arctic Ocean, and had nothing to learn either in audacity or\r\n_sang-froid_. The harpooner, Simpson, and the carpenter, Bell, were\r\nsure men, faithful to duty and discipline. The ice-master, Foker,\r\nwas an experienced sailor, and, like Johnson, was capable of rendering\r\nimportant service. Of the other sailors Garry and Bolton seemed to\r\nbe the best; Bolton was a gay and talkative fellow; Garry was\r\nthirty-five, with an energetic face, but rather pale and sad-looking.\r\nThe three sailors, Clifton, Gripper, and Pen, seemed less ardent and\r\nresolute; they easily grumbled. Gripper wanted to break his\r\nengagement even before the departure of the _Forward_; a sort of shame\r\nkept him on board. If things went on all right, if there were not\r\ntoo many risks to run, no dangers to encounter, these three men might\r\nbe depended upon; but they must be well fed, for it might be said\r\nthat they were led by their stomachs. Although warned beforehand,\r\nthey grumbled at having to be teetotallers; at their meals they\r\nregretted the brandy and gin; it did not, however, make them spare\r\nthe tea and coffee, which was prodigally given out on board. As to\r\nthe two engineers, Brunton and Plover, and the stoker, Warren, there\r\nhad been nothing for them to do as yet, and Shandon could not tell\r\nanything about their capabilities.\r\n\r\nOn the 14th of April the _Forward_ got into the grand current of the\r\nGulf Stream, which, after ascending the eastern coast of America to\r\nNewfoundland, inclines to the north-east along the coast of Norway.\r\nThey were then in 57 degrees 37 minutes latitude by 22 degrees 58\r\nminutes longitude, at two hundred miles from the point of Greenland.\r\nThe weather grew colder, and the thermometer descended to thirty-two\r\ndegrees, that is to say to freezing point.\r\n\r\nThe doctor had not yet begun to wear the garments he destined for\r\nthe Arctic Seas, but he had donned a sailor's dress like the rest;\r\nhe was a queer sight with his top-boots, in which his legs disappeared,\r\nhis vast oilcloth hat, his jacket and trousers of the same; when\r\ndrenched with heavy rains or enormous waves the doctor looked like\r\na sort of sea-animal, and was proud of the comparison.\r\n\r\nDuring two days the sea was extremely rough; the wind veered round\r\nto the north-west, and delayed the progress of the _Forward_. From\r\nthe 14th to the 16th of April the swell was great, but on the Monday\r\nthere came such a torrent of rain that the sea became calm immediately.\r\nShandon spoke to the doctor about this phenomenon.\r\n\r\n\"It confirms the curious observations of the whaler Scoresby, who\r\nlaid it before the Royal Society of Edinburgh, of which I have the\r\nhonour to be an honorary member. You see that when it rains the waves\r\nare not very high, even under the influence of a violent wind, and\r\nwhen the weather is dry the sea is more agitated, even when there\r\nis less wind.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how is this phenomenon accounted for?\"\r\n\r\n\"Very simply; it is not accounted for at all.\"\r\n\r\nJust then the ice-master, who was keeping watch on the crossbars of\r\nthe topsails, signalled a floating mass on the starboard, at about\r\nfifteen miles distance before the wind.\r\n\r\n\"An iceberg here!\" cried the doctor.\r\n\r\nShandon pointed his telescope in the direction indicated, and\r\nconfirmed the pilot's announcement.\r\n\r\n\"That is curious!\" said the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"What! you are astonished at last!\" said the commander, laughing.\r\n\r\n\"I am surprised, but not astonished,\" answered the doctor, laughing;\r\n\"for the brig _Ann_, of Poole, from Greenspond, was caught in 1813\r\nin perfect ice-fields, in the forty-fourth degree of north latitude,\r\nand her captain, Dayernent, counted them by hundreds!\"\r\n\r\n\"I see you can teach us something, even upon that subject.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very little,\" answered Clawbonny modestly; \"it is only that ice has\r\nbeen met with in even lower latitudes.\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew that already, doctor, for when I was cabinboy on board the\r\nwar-sloop _Fly_----\"\r\n\r\n\"In 1818,\" continued the doctor, \"at the end of March, almost in April,\r\nyou passed between two large islands of floating ice under the\r\nforty-second degree of latitude.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, I declare you astonish me!\" cried Shandon.\r\n\r\n\"But the iceberg doesn't astonish me, as we are two degrees further\r\nnorth.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are a well, doctor,\" answered the commander, \"and all we have\r\nto do is to be water-buckets.\"\r\n\r\n\"You will draw me dry sooner than you think for; and now, Shandon,\r\nif we could get a nearer look at this phenomenon, I should be the\r\nhappiest of doctors.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just so, Johnson,\" said Shandon, calling his boatswain. \"It seems\r\nto me that the breeze is getting up.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, commander,\" answered Johnson; \"we are making very little way,\r\nand the currents of Davis's Straits will soon be against us.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right, Johnson, and if we wish to be in sight of Cape Farewell\r\non the 20th of April we must put the steam on, or we shall be thrown\r\non the coasts of Labrador. Mr. Wall, will you give orders to light\r\nthe fires?\"\r\n\r\nThe commander's orders were executed, an hour afterwards the steam\r\nwas up, the sails were furled, and the screw cutting the waves sent\r\nthe _Forward_ against the north-west wind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nTHE GREAT POLAR CURRENT\r\n\r\n\r\nA short time after the flights of birds became more and more numerous.\r\nPetrels, puffins, and mates, inhabitants of those desolate quarters,\r\nsignalled the approach of Greenland. The _Forward_ was rapidly\r\nnearing the north, leaving to her leeward a long line of black smoke.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday the 17th of April, about eleven o'clock in the morning,\r\nthe ice-master signalled the first sight of the ice-blink; it was\r\nabout twenty miles to the N.N.W. This glaring white strip was\r\nbrilliantly lighted up, in spite of the presence of thick clouds in\r\nthe neighbouring parts of the sky. Experienced people on board could\r\nmake no mistake about this phenomenon, and declared, from its\r\nwhiteness, that the blink was owing to a large ice-field, situated\r\nat about thirty miles out of sight, and that it proceeded from the\r\nreflection of luminous rays. Towards evening the wind turned round\r\nto the south, and became favourable; Shandon put on all sail, and\r\nfor economy's sake caused the fires to be put out. The _Forward_,\r\nunder her topsails and foresails, glided on towards Cape Farewell.\r\n\r\nAt three o'clock on the 18th they came across the ice-stream, and\r\na white thick line of a glaring colour cut brilliantly the lines of\r\nthe sea and sky. It was evidently drifting from the eastern coast\r\nof Greenland more than from Davis's Straits, for ice generally keeps\r\nto the west coast of Baffin's Sea. An hour afterwards the _Forward_\r\npassed in the midst of isolated portions of the ice-stream, and in\r\nthe most compact parts, the icebergs, though welded together, obeyed\r\nthe movements of the swell. The next day the man at the masthead\r\nsignalled a vessel. It was the _Valkirien_, a Danish corvette, running\r\nalongside the _Forward_, and making for the bank of Newfoundland.\r\nThe current of the Strait began to make itself felt, and Shandon had\r\nto put on sail to go up it. At this moment the commander, the doctor,\r\nJames Wall, and Johnson were assembled on the poop examining the\r\ndirection and strength of the current. The doctor wanted to know if\r\nthe current existed also in Baffin's Sea.\r\n\r\n\"Without the least doubt,\" answered Shandon, \"and the sailing vessels\r\nhave much trouble to stem it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Besides there,\" added Wall, \"you meet with it on the eastern coast\r\nof America, as well as on the western coast of Greenland.\"\r\n\r\n\"There,\" said the doctor, \"that is what gives very singular reason\r\nto the seekers of the North-West passage! That current runs about\r\nfive miles an hour, and it is a little difficult to suppose that it\r\nsprings from the bottom of a gulf.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is so much the more probable, doctor,\" replied Shandon, \"that\r\nif this current runs from north to south we find in Behring's Straits\r\na contrary current which runs from south to north, and which must\r\nbe the origin of this one.\"\r\n\r\n\"According to that,\" replied the doctor, \"we must admit that America\r\nis totally unconnected with the Polar lands, and that the waters of\r\nthe Pacific run round the coasts of America into the Atlantic. On\r\nthe other hand, the greater elevation of the waters of the Pacific\r\ngives reason to the supposition that they fall into the European\r\nseas.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" sharply replied Shandon, \"there must be facts to establish\r\nthat theory, and if there are any,\" added he with irony, \"our\r\nuniversally well-informed doctor ought to know them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" replied the above-mentioned, with amiable satisfaction, \"if\r\nit interests you, I can tell you that whales, wounded in Davis's\r\nStraits, are caught some time afterwards in the neighbourhood of\r\nTartary with the European harpoon still in their flanks.\"\r\n\r\n\"And unless they have been able to double Cape Horn or the Cape of\r\nGood Hope,\" replied Shandon, \"they must necessarily have rounded the\r\nseptentrional coasts of America--that's what I call indisputable,\r\ndoctor.\"\r\n\r\n\"However, if you were not convinced, my dear fellow,\" said the doctor,\r\nsmiling, \"I could still produce other facts, such as drift-wood, of\r\nwhich Davis's Straits are full, larch, aspen, and other tropical trees.\r\nNow we know that the Gulf Stream hinders those woods from entering\r\nthe Straits. If, then, they come out of it they can only get in from\r\nBehring's Straits.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am convinced, doctor, and I avow that it would be difficult to\r\nremain incredulous with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Upon my honour,\" said Johnson, \"there's something that comes just\r\nin time to help our discussion. I perceive in the distance a lump\r\nof wood of certain dimensions; if the commander permits it we'll haul\r\nit in, and ask it the name of its country.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's it,\" said the doctor, \"the example after the rule.\"\r\n\r\nShandon gave the necessary orders; the brig was directed towards the\r\npiece of wood signalled, and soon afterwards, not without trouble,\r\nthe crew hoisted it on deck. It was the trunk of a mahogany tree,\r\ngnawed right into the centre by worms, but for which circumstance\r\nit would not have floated.\r\n\r\n\"This is glorious,\" said the doctor enthusiastically, \"for as the\r\ncurrents of the Atlantic could not carry it to Davis's Straits, and\r\nas it has not been driven into the Polar basin by the streams of\r\nseptentrional America, seeing that this tree grew under the Equator,\r\nit is evident that it comes in a straight line from Behring; and look\r\nhere, you see those sea-worms which have eaten it, they belong to\r\na hot-country species.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is evident,\" replied Wall, \"that the people who do not believe\r\nin the famous passage are wrong.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, this circumstance alone ought to convince them,\" said the\r\ndoctor; \"I will just trace you out the itinerary of that mahogany;\r\nit has been floated towards the Pacific by some river of the Isthmus\r\nof Panama or Guatemala, from thence the current has dragged it along\r\nthe American coast as far as Behring's Straits, and in spite of\r\neverything it was obliged to enter the Polar Seas. It is neither so\r\nold nor so soaked that we need fear to assign a recent date to its\r\nsetting out; it has had the good luck to get clear of the obstacles\r\nin that long suite of straits which lead out of Baffin's Bay, and\r\nquickly seized by the boreal current came by Davis's Straits to be\r\nmade prisoner by the _Forward_ to the great joy of Dr. Clawbonny,\r\nwho asks the commander's permission to keep a sample of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do so,\" said Shandon, \"but allow me to tell you that you will not\r\nbe the only proprietor of such a wreck. The Danish governor of the\r\nIsle of Disko----\"\r\n\r\n\"On the coast of Greenland,\" continued the doctor, \"possesses a\r\nmahogany table made from a trunk fished up under the same\r\ncircumstances. I know it, but I don't envy him his table, for if it\r\nwere not for the bother, I should have enough there for a whole\r\nbedroom.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the night, from Wednesday to Thursday, the wind blew with\r\nextreme violence, and driftwood was seen more frequently. Nearing\r\nthe coast offered many dangers at an epoch in which icebergs were\r\nso numerous; the commander caused some of the sails to be furled,\r\nand the _Forward_ glided away under her foresail and foremast only.\r\nThe thermometer sank below freezing-point. Shandon distributed\r\nsuitable clothing to the crew, a woollen jacket and trousers, a\r\nflannel shirt, wadmel stockings, the same as those the Norwegian\r\ncountry-people wear, and a pair of perfectly waterproof sea-boots.\r\nAs to the captain, he contented himself with his natural fur, and\r\nappeared little sensible to the change in the temperature; he had,\r\nno doubt, gone through more than one trial of this kind, and besides,\r\na Dane had no right to be difficult. He was seen very little, as he\r\nkept himself concealed in the darkest parts of the vessel.\r\n\r\nTowards evening the coast of Greenland peeped out through an opening\r\nin the fog. The doctor, armed with his glass, could distinguish for\r\nan instant a line of peaks, ridged with large blocks of ice; but the\r\nfog closed rapidly on this vision, like the curtain of a theatre\r\nfalling in the most interesting moment of the piece.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 20th of April the _Forward_ was in sight of\r\nan iceberg a hundred and fifty feet high, stranded there from time\r\nimmemorial; the thaws had taken no effect on it, and had respected\r\nits strange forms. Snow saw it; James Ross took an exact sketch of\r\nit in 1829; and in 1851 the French lieutenant Bellot saw it from the\r\ndeck of the _Prince Albert_. Of course the doctor wished to keep a\r\nmemento of the celebrated mountain, and made a clever sketch of it.\r\nIt is not surprising that such masses should be stranded and adhere\r\nto the land, for to each foot above water they have two feet below,\r\ngiving, therefore, to this one about eighty fathoms of depth.\r\n\r\nAt last, under a temperature which at noon was only 12 degrees, under\r\na snowy and foggy sky, Cape Farewell was perceived. The _Forward_\r\narrived on the day fixed; if it pleased the unknown captain to come\r\nand occupy his position in such diabolical weather he would have no\r\ncause to complain.\r\n\r\n\"There you are, then,\" said the doctor to himself, \"cape so celebrated\r\nand so well named! Many have cleared it like us who were destined\r\nnever to see it again. Is it, then, an eternal adieu said to one's\r\nEuropean friends? You have all passed it. Frobisher, Knight, Barlow,\r\nVaughan, Scroggs, Barentz, Hudson, Blosseville, Franklin, Crozier,\r\nBellot, never to come back to your domestic hearth, and that cape\r\nhas been really for you the cape of adieus.\"\r\n\r\nIt was about the year 970 that some navigators left Iceland and\r\ndiscovered Greenland. Sebastian Cabot forced his way as far as\r\nlatitude 56 degrees in 1498. Gaspard and Michel Cotreal, in 1500 and\r\n1502, went as far north as 60 degrees; and Martin Frobisher, in 1576,\r\narrived as far as the bay that bears his name. To John Davis belongs\r\nthe honour of having discovered the Straits in 1585; and two years\r\nlater, in a third voyage, that bold navigator and great whaler reached\r\nthe sixty-third parallel, twenty-seven degrees from the Pole.\r\n\r\nBarentz in 1596, Weymouth in 1602, James Hall in 1605 and 1607, Hudson,\r\nwhose name was given to that vast bay which hollows out so profoundly\r\nthe continent of America, James Poole, in 1611, advanced far into\r\nthe Strait in search of that North-West passage the discovery of which\r\nwould have considerably shortened the track of communication between\r\nthe two worlds. Baffin, in 1616, found the Straits of Lancaster in\r\nthe sea that bears his own name; he was followed, in 1619, by James\r\nMunk, and in 1719 by Knight, Barlow, Vaughan, and Scroggs, of whom\r\nno news has ever been heard. In 1776 Lieutenant Pickersgill, sent\r\nout to meet Captain Cook, who tried to go up Behring's Straits, reached\r\nthe sixty-eighth degree; the following year Young, for the same\r\npurpose, went as far north as Woman's Island.\r\n\r\nAfterwards came Captain James Ross, who, in 1818, rounded the coasts\r\nof Baffin's Sea, and corrected the hydrographic errors of his\r\npredecessors. Lastly, in 1819 and 1820, the celebrated Parry passed\r\nthrough Lancaster Straits, and penetrated, in spite of unnumbered\r\ndifficulties, as far as Melville Island, and won the prize of 5,000\r\npounds promised by Act of Parliament to the English sailors who would\r\nreach the hundred and seventeenth meridian by a higher latitude than\r\nthe seventy-seventh parallel.\r\n\r\nIn 1826 Beechey touched Chamisso Island; James Ross wintered from\r\n1829 to 1833 in Prince Regent Straits, and amongst other important\r\nworks discovered the magnetic pole. During this time Franklin, by\r\nan overland route, traversed the septentrional coasts of America from\r\nthe River Mackenzie to Turnagain Point. Captain Back followed in his\r\nsteps from 1823 to 1835, and these explorations were completed in\r\n1839 by Messrs. Dease and Simpson and Dr. Rae.\r\n\r\nLastly, Sir John Franklin, wishing to discover the North-West passage,\r\nleft England in 1845 on board the _Erebus_ and the _Terror_; he\r\npenetrated into Baffin's Sea, and since his passage across Disko\r\nIsland no news had been heard of his expedition.\r\n\r\nThat disappearance determined the numerous investigations which have\r\nbrought about the discovery of the passage, and the survey of these\r\nPolar continents, with such indented coast lines. The most daring\r\nEnglish, French, and American sailors made voyages towards these\r\nterrible countries, and, thanks to their efforts, the maps of that\r\ncountry, so difficult to make, figured in the list of the Royal\r\nGeographical Society of London. The curious history of these\r\ncountries was thus presented to the doctor's imagination as he leaned\r\non the rail, and followed with his eyes the long track left by the\r\nbrig. Thoughts of the bold navigators weighed upon his mind, and he\r\nfancied he could perceive under the frozen arches of the icebergs\r\nthe pale ghosts of those who were no more.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nDAVIS'S STRAITS\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring that day the _Forward_ cut out an easy road amongst the\r\nhalf-broken ice; the wind was good, but the temperature very low;\r\nthe currents of air blowing across the ice-fields brought with them\r\ntheir penetrating cold. The night required the severest attention;\r\nthe floating icebergs drew together in that narrow pass; a hundred\r\nat once were often counted on the horizon; they broke off from the\r\nelevated coasts under the teeth of the grinding waves and the\r\ninfluence of the spring season, in order to go and melt or to be\r\nswallowed up in the depths of the ocean. Long rafts of wood, with\r\nwhich it was necessary to escape collision, kept the crew on the alert;\r\nthe crow's nest was put in its place on the mizenmast; it consisted\r\nof a cask, in which the ice-master was partly hidden to protect him\r\nfrom the cold winds while he kept watch over the sea and the icebergs\r\nin view, and from which he signalled danger and sometimes gave orders\r\nto the crew. The nights were short; the sun had reappeared since the\r\n31st of January in consequence of the refraction, and seemed to get\r\nhigher and higher above the horizon. But the snow impeded the view,\r\nand if it did not cause complete obscurity it rendered navigation\r\nlaborious.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of April Desolation Cape appeared in the midst of thick\r\nmists; the crew were tired out with the constant strain on their\r\nenergies rendered necessary ever since they had got amongst the\r\nicebergs; the sailors had not had a minute's rest; it was soon\r\nnecessary to have recourse to steam to cut a way through the heaped-up\r\nblocks. The doctor and Johnson were talking together on the stern,\r\nwhilst Shandon was snatching a few hours' sleep in his cabin.\r\nClawbonny was getting information from the old sailor, whose numerous\r\nvoyages had given him an interesting and sensible education. The\r\ndoctor felt much friendship for him, and the boatswain repaid it with\r\ninterest.\r\n\r\n\"You see, Mr. Clawbonny,\" Johnson used to say, \"this country is not\r\nlike all others; they call it _Green_land, but there are very few\r\nweeks in the year when it justifies its name.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who knows if in the tenth century this land did not justify its name?\"\r\nadded the doctor. \"More than one revolution of this kind has been\r\nproduced upon our globe, and I daresay I should astonish you if I\r\nwere to tell you that according to Icelandic chronicles two thousand\r\nvillages flourished upon this continent about eight or nine hundred\r\nyears ago.\"\r\n\r\n\"You would so much astonish me, Mr. Clawbonny, that I should have\r\nsome difficulty in believing you, for it is a miserable country.\"\r\n\r\n\"However miserable it may be, it still offers a sufficient retreat\r\nto its inhabitants, and even to civilised Europeans.\"\r\n\r\n\"Without doubt! We met men at Disko and Uppernawik who consented to\r\nlive in such climates; but my ideas upon the matter were that they\r\nlived there by compulsion and not by choice.\"\r\n\r\n\"I daresay you are right, though men get accustomed to everything,\r\nand the Greenlanders do not appear to me so unfortunate as the workmen\r\nof our large towns; they may be unfortunate, but they are certainly\r\nnot unhappy. I say unhappy, but the word does not translate my thought,\r\nfor if these people have not the comforts of temperate countries,\r\nthey are formed for a rude climate, and find pleasures in it which\r\nwe are not able to conceive.\"\r\n\r\n\"I suppose we must think so, as Heaven is just. Many, many voyages\r\nhave brought me upon these coasts, and my heart always shrinks at\r\nthe sight of these wretched solitudes; but they ought to have cheered\r\nup these capes, promontories, and bays with more engaging names, for\r\nFarewell Cape and Desolation Cape are not names made to attract\r\nnavigators.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have also remarked that,\" replied the doctor, \"but these names\r\nhave a geographical interest that we must not overlook. They describe\r\nthe adventures of those who gave them those names. Next to the names\r\nof Davis, Baffin, Hudson, Ross, Parry, Franklin, and Bellot, if I\r\nmeet with Cape Desolation I soon find Mercy Bay; Cape Providence is\r\na companion to Port Anxiety; Repulsion Bay brings me back to Cape\r\nEden, and leaving Turnagain Point I take refuge in Refuge Bay. I have\r\nthere under my eyes an unceasing succession of perils, misfortunes,\r\nobstacles, successes, despairs, and issues, mixed with great names\r\nof my country, and, like a series of old-fashioned medals, that\r\nnomenclature retraces in my mind the whole history of these seas.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are quite right, Mr. Clawbonny, and I hope we shall meet with\r\nmore Success Bays than Despair Capes in our voyage.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope so too, Johnson; but, I say, is the crew come round a little\r\nfrom its terrors?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, a little; but since we got into the Straits they have begun\r\nto talk about the fantastic captain; more than one of them expected\r\nto see him appear at the extremity of Greenland; but between you and\r\nme, doctor, doesn't it astonish you a little too?\"\r\n\r\n\"It does indeed, Johnson.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you believe in the captain's existence?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course I do.\"\r\n\r\n\"But what can be his reasons for acting in that manner?\"\r\n\r\n\"If I really must tell you the whole of my thoughts, Johnson, I believe\r\nthat the captain wished to entice the crew far enough out to prevent\r\nthem being able to come back. Now if he had been on board when we\r\nstarted they would all have wanted to know our destination, and he\r\nmight have been embarrassed.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why so?\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose he should wish to attempt some superhuman enterprise, and\r\nto penetrate where others have never been able to reach, do you believe\r\nif the crew knew it they would ever have enlisted? As it is, having\r\ngot so far, going farther becomes a necessity.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's very probable, Mr. Clawbonny. I have known more than one\r\nintrepid adventurer whose name alone was a terror, and who would never\r\nhave found any one to accompany him in his perilous expeditions----\"\r\n\r\n\"Excepting me,\" ventured the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"And me, after you,\" answered Johnson, \"and to follow you; I can\r\nventure to affirm that our captain is amongst the number of such\r\nadventurers. No matter, we shall soon see; I suppose the unknown will\r\ncome as captain on board from the coast of Uppernawik or Melville\r\nBay, and will tell us at last where it is his good pleasure to conduct\r\nthe ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am of your opinion, Johnson, but the difficulty will be to get\r\nas far as Melville Bay. See how the icebergs encircle us from every\r\npoint! They scarcely leave a passage for the _Forward_. Just examine\r\nthat immense plain over there.\"\r\n\r\n\"The whalers call that in our language an ice-field, that is to say\r\na continued surface of ice the limits of which cannot be perceived.\"\r\n\r\n\"And on that side, that broken field, those long pieces of ice more\r\nor less joined at their edges?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a pack; if it was of a circular form we should call it a\r\npatch; and, if the form was longer, a stream.\"\r\n\r\n\"And there, those floating icebergs?\"\r\n\r\n\"Those are drift-ice; if they were a little higher they would be\r\nicebergs or hills; their contact with vessels is dangerous, and must\r\nbe carefully avoided. Here, look over there: on that ice-field there\r\nis a protuberance produced by the pressure of the icebergs; we call\r\nthat a hummock; if that protuberance was submerged to its base we\r\nshould call it a calf. It was very necessary to give names to all\r\nthose forms in order to recognise them.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is truly a marvellous spectacle!\" exclaimed the doctor,\r\ncontemplating the wonders of the Boreal Seas; \"there is a field for\r\nthe imagination in such pictures!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Johnson, \"ice often takes fantastic shapes, and our\r\nmen are not behindhand in explaining them according to their own\r\nnotions.\"\r\n\r\n\"Isn't that assemblage of ice-blocks admirable? Doesn't it look like\r\na foreign town, an Eastern town, with its minarets and mosques under\r\nthe pale glare of the moon? Further on there is a long series of Gothic\r\nvaults, reminding one of Henry the Seventh's chapel or the Houses\r\nof Parliament.\"\r\n\r\n\"They would be houses and towns very dangerous to inhabit, and we\r\nmust not sail too close to them. Some of those minarets yonder totter\r\non their base, and the least of them would crush a vessel like the\r\n_Forward_.\"\r\n\r\n\"And yet sailors dared to venture into these seas before they had\r\nsteam at their command! How ever could a sailing vessel be steered\r\namongst these moving rocks?\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, it has been accomplished, Mr. Clawbonny. When the wind\r\nbecame contrary--and that has happened to me more than once--we\r\nquietly anchored to one of those blocks, and we drifted more or less\r\nwith it and waited for a favourable moment to set sail again. I must\r\nacknowledge that such a manner of voyaging required months, whilst\r\nwith a little good fortune we shall only want a few days.\"\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me,\" said the doctor, \"that the temperature has a tendency\r\nto get lower.\"\r\n\r\n\"That would be a pity,\" answered Johnson, \"for a thaw is necessary\r\nto break up these masses and drive them away into the Atlantic; besides,\r\nthey are more numerous in Davis's Straits, for the sea gets narrower\r\nbetween Capes Walsingham and Holsteinborg; but on the other side of\r\nthe 67th degree we shall find the seas more navigable during the months\r\nof May and June.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but first of all we must get to the other side.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we must get there, Mr. Clawbonny. In June and July we should\r\nhave found an open passage, like the whalers do, but our orders were\r\nprecise; we were to be here in April. I am very much mistaken if our\r\ncaptain has not his reasons for getting us out here so early.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor was right in stating that the temperature was lowering;\r\nthe thermometer at noon only indicated 6 degrees, and a north-west\r\nbreeze was getting up, which, although it cleared the sky, assisted\r\nthe current in precipitating the floating masses of ice into the path\r\nof the _Forward_. All of them did not obey the same impulsion, and\r\nit was not uncommon to encounter some of the highest masses drifting\r\nin an opposite direction, seized at their base by an undercurrent.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand the difficulties of this kind of navigation;\r\nthe engineers had not a minute's rest; the engines were worked from\r\nthe deck by means of levers, which opened, stopped, and reversed them\r\naccording to the orders of the officers on watch. Sometimes the brig\r\nhad to hasten through an opening in the ice-fields, sometimes to\r\nstruggle against the swiftness of an iceberg which threatened to close\r\nthe only practicable issue, or, again, some block, suddenly\r\noverthrown, compelled the brig to back quickly so as not to be crushed\r\nto pieces. This mass of ice, carried along, broken up and amalgamated\r\nby the northern current, crushed up the passage, and if seized by\r\nthe frost would oppose an impassable barrier to the passage of the\r\n_Forward_.\r\n\r\nBirds were found in innumerable quantities on these coasts, petrels\r\nand other sea-birds fluttered about here and there with deafening\r\ncries, a great number of big-headed, short-necked sea-gulls were\r\namongst them; they spread out their long wings and braved in their\r\nplay the snow whipped by the hurricane. This animation of the winged\r\ntribe made the landscape more lively.\r\n\r\nNumerous pieces of wood were floating to leeway, clashing with noise;\r\na few enormous, bloated-headed sharks approached the vessel, but\r\nthere was no question of chasing them, although Simpson, the harpooner,\r\nwas longing to have a hit at them. Towards evening several seals made\r\ntheir appearance, nose above water, swimming between the blocks.\r\n\r\nOn the 22nd the temperature again lowered; the _Forward_ put on all\r\nsteam to catch the favourable passes: the wind was decidedly fixed\r\nin the north-west; all sails were furled.\r\n\r\nDuring that day, which was Sunday, the sailors had little to do. After\r\nthe reading of Divine service, which was conducted by Shandon, the\r\ncrew gave chase to sea-birds, of which they caught a great number.\r\nThey were suitably prepared according to the doctor's method, and\r\nfurnished an agreeable increase of provisions to the tables of the\r\nofficers and crew.\r\n\r\nAt three o'clock in the afternoon the _Forward_ had attained Thin\r\nde Sael, Sukkertop Mountain; the sea was very rough; from time to\r\ntime a vast and inopportune fog fell from the grey sky; however, at\r\nnoon an exact observation could be taken. The vessel was in 65 degrees\r\n20 minutes latitude by 54 degrees 22 minutes longitude. It was\r\nnecessary to attain two degrees more in order to meet with freer and\r\nmore favourable navigation.\r\n\r\nDuring the three following days, the 24th, 25th, and 26th of April,\r\nthe _Forward_ had a continual struggle with the ice; the working of\r\nthe machines became very fatiguing. The steam was turned off quickly\r\nor got up again at a moment's notice, and escaped whistling from its\r\nvalves. During the thick mist the nearing of icebergs was only known\r\nby dull thundering produced by the avalanches; the brig was instantly\r\nveered; it ran the risk of being crushed against the heaps of\r\nfresh-water ice, remarkable for its crystal transparency, and as hard\r\nas a rock.\r\n\r\nRichard Shandon never missed completing his provision of water by\r\nembarking several tons of ice every day. The doctor could not accustom\r\nhimself to the optical delusions that refraction produces on these\r\ncoasts. An iceberg sometimes appeared to him like a small white lump\r\nwithin reach, when it was at least at ten or twelve miles' distance.\r\nHe endeavoured to accustom his eyesight to this singular phenomenon,\r\nso that he might be able to correct its errors rapidly.\r\n\r\nAt last the crew were completely worn out by their labours in hauling\r\nthe vessel alongside of the ice-fields and by keeping it free from\r\nthe most menacing blocks by the aid of long perches. Nevertheless,\r\nthe _Forward_ was still held back in the impassable limits of the\r\nPolar Circle on Friday, the 27th of April.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nGOSSIP OF THE CREW\r\n\r\n\r\nHowever, the _Forward_ managed, by cunningly slipping into narrow\r\npassages, to gain a few more minutes north; but instead of avoiding\r\nthe enemy, it was soon necessary to attack it. The ice-fields, several\r\nmiles in extent, were getting nearer, and as these moving heaps often\r\nrepresent a pressure of more than ten millions of tons, it was\r\nnecessary to give a wide berth to their embraces. The ice-saws were\r\nat once installed in the interior of the vessel, in such a manner\r\nas to facilitate immediate use of them. Part of the crew\r\nphilosophically accepted their hard work, but the other complained\r\nof it, if it did not refuse to obey. At the same time that they assisted\r\nin the installation of the instruments, Garry, Bolton, Pen and Gripper\r\nexchanged their opinions.\r\n\r\n\"By Jingo!\" said Bolton gaily, \"I don't know why the thought strikes\r\nme that there's a very jolly tavern in Water-street where it's\r\ncomfortable to be between a glass of gin and a bottle of porter. Can't\r\nyou imagine it, Gripper?\"\r\n\r\n\"To tell you the truth,\" quickly answered the questioned sailor, who\r\ngenerally professed to be in a bad temper, \"I don't imagine it here.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's for the sake of talking, Gripper; it's evident that the snow\r\ntowns Dr. Clawbonny admires so don't contain the least public where\r\na poor sailor can get a half-pint of brandy.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's sure enough, Bolton; and you may as well add that there's\r\nnothing worth drinking here. It's a nice idea to deprive men of their\r\ngrog when they are in the Northern Seas.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you know,\" said Garry, \"that the doctor told us it was to prevent\r\nus getting the scurvy. It's the only way to make us go far.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I don't want to go far, Garry; it's pretty well to have come\r\nthis far without trying to go where the devil is determined we shan't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we shan't go, that's all,\" replied Pen. \"I declare I've almost\r\nforgotten the taste of gin.\"\r\n\r\n\"But remember what the doctor says,\" replied Bolton.\r\n\r\n\"It's all very fine for them to talk. It remains to be seen if it\r\nisn't an excuse for being skinny with the drink.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pen may be right, after all,\" said Gripper.\r\n\r\n\"His nose is too red for that,\" answered Bolton. \"Pen needn't grumble\r\nif it loses a little of its colour in the voyage.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's my nose got to do with you?\" sharply replied the sailor,\r\nattacked in the most sensitive place. \"My nose doesn't need any of\r\nyour remarks; take care of your own.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, then, don't get angry, Pen; I didn't know your nose was so touchy.\r\nI like a glass of whisky as well as anybody, especially in such a\r\ntemperature; but if I know it'll do me more harm than good, I go\r\nwithout.\"\r\n\r\n\"You go without,\" said Warren, the stoker; \"but everyone don't go\r\nwithout.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, Warren?\" asked Garry, looking fixedly at him.\r\n\r\n\"I mean that for some reason or other there are spirits on board,\r\nand I know they don't go without in the stern.\"\r\n\r\n\"And how do you know that?\" asked Garry.\r\n\r\nWarren did not know what to say: he talked for the sake of talking.\r\n\r\n\"You see Warren don't know anything about it, Garry,\" said Bolton.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Pen, \"we'll ask the commander for a ration of gin; we've\r\nearned it well and we'll see what he says.\"\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't if I were you,\" answered Garry.\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" cried Pen and Gripper.\r\n\r\n\"Because he'll refuse. You knew you weren't to have any when you\r\nenlisted; you should have thought of it then.\"\r\n\r\n\"Besides,\" replied Bolton, who took Garry's part because he liked\r\nhis character, \"Richard Shandon isn't master on board; he obeys, like\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who is master if he isn't?\"\r\n\r\n\"The captain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Always that unfortunate captain!\" exclaimed Pen. \"Don't you see that\r\non these ice-banks there's no more a captain than there is a public?\r\nIt's a polite way of refusing us what we've a right to claim.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if there's a captain,\" replied Bolton, \"I'll bet two months'\r\npay we shall see him before long.\"\r\n\r\n\"I should like to tell the captain a bit of my mind,\" said Pen.\r\n\r\n\"Who's talking about the captain?\" said a new-comer. It was Clifton,\r\nthe sailor, a superstitious and envious man. \"Is anything new known\r\nabout the captain?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" they all answered at once.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I believe we shall find him one fine morning installed in his\r\ncabin, and no one will know how he got there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Get along, do!\" replied Bolton. \"Why, Clifton, you imagine that he's\r\na hobgoblin--a sort of wild child of the Highlands.\"\r\n\r\n\"Laugh as much as you like, Bolton, you won't change my opinion. Every\r\nday as I pass his cabin I look through the keyhole. One of these fine\r\nmornings I shall come and tell you what he's like.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why, he'll be like everyone else,\" said Pen, \"and if he thinks he'll\r\nbe able to do what he likes with us, he'll find himself mistaken,\r\nthat's all!\"\r\n\r\n\"Pen don't know him yet,\" said Bolton, \"and he's beginning to quarrel\r\nwith him already.\"\r\n\r\n\"Who doesn't know him?\" said Clifton, looking knowing; \"I don't know\r\nthat he don't!\"\r\n\r\n\"What the devil do you mean?\" asked Gripper.\r\n\r\n\"I know very well what I mean.\"\r\n\r\n\"But we don't.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Pen has quarrelled with him before.\"\r\n\r\n\"With the captain?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the dog-captain--it's all one.\"\r\n\r\nThe sailors looked at one another, afraid to say anything.\r\n\r\n\"Man or dog,\" muttered Pen, \"I declare that that animal will have\r\nhis account one of these days.\"\r\n\r\n\"Come, Clifton,\" asked Bolton seriously, \"you don't mean to say that\r\nyou believe the dog is the real captain?\"\r\n\r\n\"Indeed I do,\" answered Clifton with conviction. \"If you noticed\r\nthings like I do, you would have noticed what a queer beast it is.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, tell us what you've noticed.\"\r\n\r\n\"Haven't you noticed the way he walks on the poop with such an air\r\nof authority, looking up at the sails as if he were on watch?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's true enough,\" added Gripper, \"and one evening I actually found\r\nhim with his paws on the paddle-wheel.\"\r\n\r\n\"You don't mean it!\" said Bolton.\r\n\r\n\"And now what do you think he does but go for a walk on the ice-fields,\r\nminding neither the bears nor the cold?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's true enough,\" said Bolton.\r\n\r\n\"Do you ever see that 'ere animal, like an honest dog, seek men's\r\ncompany, sneak about the kitchen, and set his eyes on Mr. Strong when's\r\nhe taking something good to the commander? Don't you hear him in the\r\nnight when he goes away two or three miles from the vessel, howling\r\nfit to make your blood run cold, as if it weren't easy enough to feel\r\nthat sensation in such a temperature as this? Again, have you ever\r\nseen him feed? He takes nothing from any one. His food is always\r\nuntouched and unless a secret hand feeds him on board, I may say that\r\nhe lives without eating, and if he's not unearthly, I'm a fool!\"\r\n\r\n\"Upon my word,\" said Bell, the carpenter, who had heard all Clifton's\r\nreasoning, \"I shouldn't be surprised if such was the case.\" The other\r\nsailors were silenced.\r\n\r\n\"Well, at any rate, where's the _Forward_ going to?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know anything about it,\" replied Bell. \"Richard Shandon will\r\nreceive the rest of his instructions in due time.\"\r\n\r\n\"But from whom?\"\r\n\r\n\"From whom?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, how?\" asked Bolton, becoming pressing.\r\n\r\n\"Now then, answer, Bell!\" chimed in all the other sailors.\r\n\r\n\"By whom? how? Why, I don't know,\" said the carpenter, embarrassed\r\nin his turn.\r\n\r\n\"Why, by the dog-captain,\" exclaimed Clifton. \"He has written once\r\nalready; why shouldn't he again? If I only knew half of what that\r\n'ere animal knows, I shouldn't be embarrassed at being First Lord\r\nof the Admiralty!\"\r\n\r\n\"So then you stick to your opinion that the dog is the captain?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Pen in a hoarse voice, \"if that 'ere animal don't want\r\nto turn up his toes in a dog's skin, he's only got to make haste and\r\nbecome a man, or I'm hanged if I don't settle him.\"\r\n\r\n\"What for?\" asked Garry.\r\n\r\n\"Because I choose,\" replied Pen brutally; \"besides, it's no business\r\nof any one.\"\r\n\r\n\"Enough talking, my boys,\" called out Mr. Johnson, interfering just\r\nin time, for the conversation was getting hot. \"Get on with your work,\r\nand set up your saws quicker than that. We must clear the iceberg.\"\r\n\r\n\"What! on a Friday?\" replied Clifton, shrugging his shoulders.\r\n\"You'll see she won't get over the Polar circle as easily as you\r\nthink.\"\r\n\r\nThe efforts of the crew were almost powerless during the whole day.\r\nThe _Forward_ could not separate the ice-fields even by going against\r\nthem full speed, and they were obliged to anchor for the night. On\r\nSaturday the temperature lowered again under the influence of an\r\neasterly wind. The weather cleared up, and the eye could sweep over\r\nthe white plains in the distance, which the reflection of the sun's\r\nrays rendered dazzling. At seven in the morning the thermometer marked\r\neight degrees below zero. The doctor was tempted to stay quietly in\r\nhis cabin, and read the Arctic voyages over again; but, according\r\nto his custom, he asked himself what would be the most disagreeable\r\nthing he could do, which he settled was to go on deck and assist the\r\nmen to work in such a temperature. Faithful to the line of conduct\r\nhe had traced out for himself, he left his well-warmed cabin and came\r\nto help in hauling the vessel. His was a pleasant face, in spite of\r\nthe green spectacles by which he preserved his eyes from the biting\r\nof the reflected rays; in his future observations he was always\r\ncareful in making use of his snow spectacles, in order to avoid\r\nophthalmia, very frequent in these high latitudes.\r\n\r\nTowards evening the _Forward_ had made several miles further north,\r\nthanks to the activity of the men and Shandon's skill, which made\r\nhim take advantage of every favourable circumstance; at midnight he\r\nhad got beyond the sixty-sixth parallel, and the fathom line declared\r\ntwenty-three fathoms of water; Shandon discovered that he was on the\r\nshoal where Her Majesty's ship _Victoria_ struck, and that land was\r\ndrawing near, thirty miles to the east. But now the heaps of ice,\r\nwhich up till now had been motionless, divided and began to move;\r\nicebergs seemed coming from every point of the horizon; the brig was\r\nentangled in a series of moving rocks, the crushing force of which\r\nit was impossible to resist. Moving became so difficult that Garry,\r\nthe best helmsman, took the wheel; the mountains had a tendency to\r\nclose up behind the brig; it then became essential to cut through\r\nthe floating ice, and prudence as well as duty ordered them to go\r\nahead. Difficulties became greater from the impossibility that\r\nShandon found in establishing the direction of the vessel amongst\r\nsuch changing points, which kept moving without offering one firm\r\nperspective. The crew was divided into two tacks, larboard and\r\nstarboard; each one, armed with a long perch with an iron point, drove\r\nback the two threatening blocks. Soon the _Forward_ entered into a\r\npass so narrow, between two high blocks, that the extremity of her\r\nyards struck against the walls, hard as rock; by degrees she entangled\r\nherself in the midst of a winding valley, filled up with eddies of\r\nsnow, whilst the floating ice was crashing and splitting with sinister\r\ncracklings. But it soon became certain that there was no egress from\r\nthis gullet. An enormous block, caught in the channel, was driving\r\nrapidly on to the _Forward_! It seemed impossible to avoid it, and\r\nequally impossible to back out along a road already obstructed.\r\n\r\nShandon and Johnson, standing on the prow, were contemplating the\r\nposition. Shandon was pointing with his right hand at the direction\r\nthe helmsman was to take, and with his left was conveying to James\r\nWall, posted near the engineer, his orders for the working of the\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\n\"How will this end?\" asked the doctor of Johnson.\r\n\r\n\"As it may please God,\" replied the boatswain.\r\n\r\nThe block of ice, at least a hundred feet high, was only about a cable's\r\nlength from the _Forward_, and threatened to pound her under it.\r\n\r\n\"Cursed luck!\" exclaimed Pen, swearing frightfully.\r\n\r\n\"Silence!\" exclaimed a voice which it was impossible to recognise\r\nin the midst of the storm.\r\n\r\nThe block seemed to be precipitating itself upon the brig; there was\r\na moment of undefinable anguish; the men forsook their poles and\r\nflocked to the stern in spite of Shandon's orders.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a frightful sound was heard; a genuine waterspout fell upon\r\ndeck, heaved up by an enormous wave. A cry of terror rang out from\r\nthe crew whilst Garry, at the helm, held the _Forward_ in a straight\r\nline in spite of the frightful incumbrance. When their frightened\r\nlooks were drawn towards the mountain of ice it had disappeared; the\r\npass was free, and further on a long channel, illuminated by the\r\noblique rays of the sun, allowed the brig to pursue her track.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mr. Clawbonny,\" said Johnson, \"can you explain to me the cause\r\nof that phenomenon?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is a very simple one,\" answered the doctor, \"and happens very\r\noften. When those floating bodies are disengaged from each other by\r\nthe thaw, they sail away separately, maintaining their balance; but\r\nby degrees, as they near the south, where the water is relatively\r\nwarmer, their base, shaken by the collision with other icebergs,\r\nbegins to melt and weaken; it then happens that their centre of gravity\r\nis displaced, and, naturally, they overturn. Only, if that one had\r\nturned over two minutes later, it would have crushed our vessel to\r\npieces.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nNEWS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Polar circle was cleared at last. On the 30th of April, at midday,\r\nthe _Forward_ passed abreast of Holsteinborg; picturesque mountains\r\nrose up on the eastern horizon. The sea appeared almost free from\r\nicebergs, and the few there were could easily be avoided. The wind\r\nveered round to the south-east, and the brig, under her mizensail,\r\nbrigantine, topsails, and her topgallant sail, sailed up Baffin's\r\nSea. It had been a particularly calm day, and the crew were able to\r\ntake a little rest. Numerous birds were swimming and fluttering about\r\nround the vessel; amongst others, the doctor observed some\r\n_alca-alla_, very much like the teal, with black neck, wings and back,\r\nand white breast; they plunged with vivacity, and their immersion\r\noften lasted forty seconds.\r\n\r\nThe day would not have been remarkable if the following fact, however\r\nextraordinary it may appear, had not occurred on board. At six o'clock\r\nin the morning Richard Shandon, re-entering his cabin after having\r\nbeen relieved, found upon the table a letter with this address:\r\n\r\n\r\n     \"To the Commander,\r\n\r\n          \"RICHARD SHANDON,\r\n\r\n               \"On board the 'FORWARD,'\r\n\r\n                    \"Baffin's Sea.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nShandon could not believe his own eyes, and before reading such a\r\nstrange epistle he caused the doctor, James Wall and Johnson to be\r\ncalled, and showed them the letter.\r\n\r\n\"That grows very strange,\" said Johnson.\r\n\r\n\"It's delightful!\" thought the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"At last,\" cried Shandon, \"we shall know the secret.\"\r\n\r\nWith a quick hand he tore the envelope and read as follows:\r\n\r\n\r\n\"COMMANDER,--The captain of the _Forward_ is pleased with the\r\ncoolness, skill, and courage that your men, your officers, and\r\nyourself have shown on the late occasions, and begs you to give\r\nevidence of his gratitude to the crew.\r\n\r\n\"Have the goodness to take a northerly direction towards Melville\r\nBay, and from thence try and penetrate into Smith's Straits.\r\n\r\n                              \"THE CAPTAIN OF THE _Forward_,\r\n\r\n                                                           \"K. Z.\r\n\r\n     \"Monday, April 30th,\r\n\r\n          \"Abreast of Cape Walsingham.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\"Is that all?\" cried the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"That's all,\" replied Shandon, and the letter fell from his hands.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Wall, \"this chimerical captain doesn't even mention\r\ncoming on board, so I conclude that he never will come.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how did this letter get here?\" said Johnson.\r\n\r\nShandon was silent.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Wall is right,\" replied the doctor, after picking up the letter\r\nand turning it over in every direction; \"the captain won't come on\r\nboard for an excellent reason----\"\r\n\r\n\"And what's that?\" asked Shandon quickly.\r\n\r\n\"Because he is here already,\" replied the doctor simply.\r\n\r\n\"Already!\" said Shandon. \"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you explain the arrival of this letter if such is not the\r\ncase?\"\r\n\r\nJohnson nodded his head in sign of approbation.\r\n\r\n\"It is not possible!\" said Shandon energetically. \"I know every man\r\nof the crew. We should have to believe, in that case, that the captain\r\nhas been with us ever since we set sail. It is not possible, I tell\r\nyou. There isn't one of them that I haven't seen for more than two\r\nyears in Liverpool; doctor, your supposition is inadmissible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then what do you admit, Shandon?\"\r\n\r\n\"Everything but that! I admit that the captain, or one of his men,\r\nhas profited by the darkness, the fog, or anything you like, in order\r\nto slip on board; we are not very far from land; there are Esquimaux\r\nkayaks that pass unperceived between the icebergs; someone may have\r\ncome on board and left the letter; the fog was intense enough to favour\r\ntheir design.\"\r\n\r\n\"And to hinder them from seeing the brig,\" replied the doctor; \"if\r\nwe were not able to perceive an intruder slip on board, how could\r\n_he_ have discovered the _Forward_ in the midst of a fog?\"\r\n\r\n\"That is evident,\" exclaimed Johnson.\r\n\r\n\"I come back, then,\" said the doctor, \"to my first hypothesis. What\r\ndo you think about it, Shandon?\"\r\n\r\n\"I think what you please,\" replied Shandon fiercely, \"with the\r\nexception of supposing that this man is on board my vessel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps,\" added Wall, \"there may be amongst the crew a man of his\r\nwho has received instructions from him.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's very likely,\" added the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"But which man?\" asked Shandon. \"I tell you I have known all my men\r\na long time.\"\r\n\r\n\"Anyhow,\" replied Johnson, \"if this captain shows himself, let him\r\nbe man or devil, we'll receive him; but we have another piece of\r\ninformation to draw from this letter.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" asked Shandon.\r\n\r\n\"Why, that we are to direct our path not only towards Melville Bay,\r\nbut again into Smith's Straits.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right,\" answered the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"Smith's Straits?\" echoed Shandon mechanically.\r\n\r\n\"It is evident,\" replied Johnson, \"that the destination of the\r\n_Forward_ is not to seek a North-West passage, as we shall leave to\r\nour left the only track that leads to it--that is to say, Lancaster\r\nStraits; that's what forebodes us difficult navigation in unknown\r\nseas.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Smith's Straits,\" replied Shandon, \"that's the route the\r\nAmerican Kane followed in 1853, and at the price of what dangers!\r\nFor a long time he was thought to be lost in those dreadful latitudes!\r\nHowever, as we must go, go we must. But where? how far? To the Pole?\"\r\n\r\n\"And why not?\" cried the doctor.\r\n\r\nThe idea of such an insane attempt made the boatswain shrug his\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\n\"After all,\" resumed James Wall, \"to come back to the captain, if\r\nhe exists, I see nowhere on the coast of Greenland except Disko or\r\nUppernawik where he can be waiting for us; in a few days we shall\r\nknow what we may depend upon.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" asked the doctor of Shandon, \"aren't you going to make known\r\nthe contents of that letter to the crew?\"\r\n\r\n\"With the commander's permission,\" replied Johnson, \"I should do\r\nnothing of the kind.\"\r\n\r\n\"And why so?\" asked Shandon.\r\n\r\n\"Because all that mystery tends to discourage the men: they are\r\nalready very anxious about the fate of our expedition, and if the\r\nsupernatural side of it is increased it may produce very serious\r\nresults, and in a critical moment we could not rely upon them. What\r\ndo you say about it, commander?\"\r\n\r\n\"And you, doctor--what do you think?\" asked Shandon.\r\n\r\n\"I think Johnson's reasoning is just.\"\r\n\r\n\"And you, Wall?\"\r\n\r\n\"Unless there's better advice forthcoming, I shall stick to the\r\nopinion of these gentlemen.\"\r\n\r\nShandon reflected seriously during a few minutes, and read the letter\r\nover again carefully.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" said he, \"your opinion on this subject is certainly\r\nexcellent, but I cannot adopt it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why not, Shandon?\" asked the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"Because the instructions of this letter are formal: they command\r\nme to give the captain's congratulations to the crew, and up till\r\nto-day I have always blindly obeyed his orders in whatever manner\r\nthey have been transmitted to me, and I cannot----\"\r\n\r\n\"But----\" said Johnson, who rightly dreaded the effect of such a\r\ncommunication upon the minds of the sailors.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Johnson,\" answered Shandon, \"your reasons are excellent,\r\nbut read--'he begs you to give evidence of his gratitude to the crew.'\"\r\n\r\n\"Act as you think best,\" replied Johnson, who was besides a very strict\r\nobserver of discipline. \"Are we to muster the crew on deck?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do so,\" replied Shandon.\r\n\r\nThe news of a communication having been received from the captain\r\nspread like wildfire on deck; the sailors quickly arrived at their\r\npost, and the commander read out the contents of the mysterious letter.\r\nThe reading of it was received in a dead silence; the crew dispersed,\r\na prey to a thousand suppositions. Clifton had heard enough to give\r\nhimself up to all the wanderings of his superstitious imagination;\r\nhe attributed a considerable share in this incident to the dog-captain,\r\nand when by chance he met him in his passage he never failed to salute\r\nhim. \"I told you the animal could write,\" he used to say to the sailors.\r\nNo one said anything in answer to this observation, and even Bell,\r\nthe carpenter himself, would not have known what to answer.\r\n\r\nNevertheless it was certain to all that, in default of the captain,\r\nhis spirit or his shadow watched on board; and henceforward the wisest\r\nof the crew abstained from exchanging their opinions about him.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of May, at noon, they were in 68 degrees latitude and 56\r\ndegrees 32 minutes longitude. The temperature was higher and the\r\nthermometer marked twenty-five degrees above zero. The doctor was\r\namusing himself with watching the antics of a white bear and two cubs\r\non the brink of a pack that lengthened out the land. Accompanied by\r\nWall and Simpson, he tried to give chase to them by means of the canoe;\r\nbut the animal, of a rather warlike disposition, rapidly led away\r\nits offspring, and consequently the doctor was compelled to renounce\r\nfollowing them up.\r\n\r\nChilly Cape was doubled during the night under the influence of a\r\nfavourable wind, and soon the high mountains of Disko rose in the\r\nhorizon. Godhavn Bay, the residence of the Governor-General of the\r\nDanish Settlements, was left to the right. Shandon did not consider\r\nit worth while to stop, and soon outran the Esquimaux pirogues who\r\nwere endeavouring to reach his ship.\r\n\r\nThe Island of Disko is also called Whale Island. It was from this\r\npoint that on the 12th of July, 1845, Sir John Franklin wrote to the\r\nAdmiralty for the last time. It was also on that island on the 27th\r\nof August, 1859, that Captain McClintock set foot on his return,\r\nbringing back, alas! proofs too complete of the loss of the expedition.\r\nThe coincidence of these two facts were noted by the doctor; that\r\nmelancholy conjunction was prolific in memories, but soon the heights\r\nof Disko disappeared from his view.\r\n\r\nThere were, at that time, numerous icebergs on the coasts, some of\r\nthose which the strongest thaws are unable to detach; the continual\r\nseries of ridges showed themselves under the strangest forms.\r\n\r\nThe next day, towards three o'clock, they were bearing on to Sanderson\r\nHope to the north-east. Land was left on the starboard at a distance\r\nof about fifteen miles; the mountains seemed tinged with a\r\nred-coloured bistre. During the evening, several whales of the\r\nfinners species, which have fins on their backs, came playing about\r\nin the midst of the ice-trails, throwing out air and water from their\r\nblow-holes. It was during the night between the 3rd and 4th of May\r\nthat the doctor saw for the first time the sun graze the horizon\r\nwithout dipping his luminous disc into it. Since the 31st of January\r\nthe days had been getting longer and longer till the sun went down\r\nno more. To strangers not accustomed to the persistence of this\r\nperpetual light it was a constant subject of astonishment, and even\r\nof fatigue; it is almost impossible to understand to what extent\r\nobscurity is requisite for the well-being of our eyes. The doctor\r\nexperienced real pain in getting accustomed to this light, rendered\r\nstill more acute by the reflection of the sun's rays upon the plains\r\nof ice.\r\n\r\nOn May 5th the _Forward_ headed the seventy-second parallel; two\r\nmonths later they would have met with numerous whalers under these\r\nhigh latitudes, but at present the straits were not sufficiently open\r\nto allow them to penetrate into Baffin's Bay. The following day the\r\nbrig, after having headed Woman's Island, came in sight of Uppernawik,\r\nthe most northerly settlement that Denmark possesses on these coasts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nDANGEROUS NAVIGATION\r\n\r\n\r\nShandon, Dr. Clawbonny, Johnson, Foker, and Strong, the cook, went\r\non shore in the small boat. The governor, his wife, and five children,\r\nall of the Esquimaux race, came politely to meet the visitors. The\r\ndoctor knew enough Danish to enable him to establish a very agreeable\r\nacquaintance with them; besides, Foker, who was interpreter of the\r\nexpedition, as well as ice-master, knew about twenty words of the\r\nGreenland language, and if not ambitious, twenty words will carry\r\nyou far. The governor was born on the island, and had never left his\r\nnative country. He did the honours of the town, which is composed\r\nof three wooden huts, for himself and the Lutheran minister, of a\r\nschool, and magazines stored with the produce of wrecks. The remainder\r\nconsists of snow-huts, the entrance to which is attained by creeping\r\nthrough a hole.\r\n\r\nThe greater part of the population came down to greet the _Forward_,\r\nand more than one native advanced as far as the middle of the bay\r\nin his kayak, fifteen feet long and scarcely two wide. The doctor\r\nknew that the word Esquimaux signified raw-fish-eater, and he\r\nlikewise knew that the name was considered an insult in the country,\r\nfor which reason he did not fail to address them by the title of\r\nGreenlanders, and nevertheless only by the look of their oily sealskin\r\nclothing, their boots of the same material, and all their greasy\r\ntainted appearance, it was easy to discover their accustomed food.\r\nLike all Ichthyophagans, they were half-eaten up with leprosy; and\r\nyet, for all that, were in no worse health.\r\n\r\nThe Lutheran minister and his wife, with whom the doctor promised\r\nhimself a private chat, were on a journey towards Proven on the south\r\nof Uppernawik; he was therefore reduced to getting information out\r\nof the governor. This chief magistrate did not seem to be very learned;\r\na little less and he would have been an ass, a little more and he\r\nwould have known how to read. The doctor, however, questioned him\r\nupon the commercial affairs, the customs and manners of the Esquimaux,\r\nand learnt by signs that seals were worth about 40 pounds delivered\r\nin Copenhagen, a bearskin forty Danish dollars, a blue foxskin four,\r\nand a white one two or three dollars. The doctor also wished, with\r\nan eye to completing his personal education, to visit one of the\r\nEsquimaux huts; it is almost impossible to imagine of what a learned\r\nman who is desirous of knowledge is capable. Happily the opening of\r\nthose hovels was too narrow, and the enthusiastic fellow was not able\r\nto crawl in; it was very lucky for him, for there is nothing more\r\nrepulsive than that accumulation of things living and dead, seal flesh\r\nor Esquimaux flesh, rotten fish and infectious wearing apparel, which\r\nconstitute a Greenland hovel; no window to revive the unbreathable\r\nair, only a hole at the top of the hut, which gives free passage to\r\nthe smoke, but does not allow the stench to go out.\r\n\r\nFoker gave these details to the doctor, who did not curse his\r\ncorpulence the less for that. He wished to judge for himself about\r\nthese emanations, _sui generis_.\r\n\r\n\"I am sure,\" said he, \"one gets used to it in the long run.\"\r\n\r\n_In the long run_ depicts Dr. Clawbonny in a single phrase. During\r\nthe ethnographical studies of the worthy doctor, Shandon, according\r\nto his instructions, was occupied in procuring means of transport\r\nto cross the ice. He had to pay 4 pounds for a sledge and six dogs,\r\nand even then he had great difficulty in persuading the natives to\r\npart with them. Shandon wanted also to engage Hans Christian, the\r\nclever dog-driver, who made one of the party of Captain McClintock's\r\nexpedition; but, unfortunately, Hans was at that time in Southern\r\nGreenland. Then came the grand question, the topic of the day, was\r\nthere in Uppernawik a European waiting for the passage of the\r\n_Forward_? Did the governor know if any foreigner, an Englishman\r\nprobably, had settled in those countries? To what epoch could he trace\r\nhis last relations with whale or other ships? To these questions the\r\ngovernor replied that not one single foreigner had landed on that\r\nside of the coast for more than ten months.\r\n\r\nShandon asked for the names of the last whalers seen there; he knew\r\nnone of them. He was in despair.\r\n\r\n\"You must acknowledge, doctor, that all this is quite inconceivable.\r\nNothing at Cape Farewell, nothing at Disko Island, nothing at\r\nUppernawik.\"\r\n\r\n\"If when we get there you repeat 'Nothing in Melville Bay,' I shall\r\ngreet you as the only captain of the _Forward_.\"\r\n\r\nThe small boat came back to the brig towards evening, bringing back\r\nthe visitors. Strong, in order to change the food a little, had\r\nprocured several dozens of eider-duck eggs, twice as big as hens'\r\neggs, and of greenish colour. It was not much, but the change was\r\nrefreshing to a crew fed on salted meat. The wind became favourable\r\nthe next day, but, however, Shandon did not command them to get under\r\nsail; he still wished to stay another day, and for conscience' sake\r\nto give any human being time to join the _Forward_. He even caused\r\nthe 16-pounder to be fired from hour to hour; it thundered out with\r\na great crash amidst the icebergs, but the noise only frightened the\r\nswarms of molly-mokes and rotches. During the night several rockets\r\nwere sent up, but in vain. And thus they were obliged to set sail.\r\n\r\nOn the 8th of May, at six o'clock in the morning, the _Forward_ under\r\nher topsails, foresails, and topgallant, lost sight of the Uppernawik\r\nsettlement, and the hideous stakes to which were hung seal-guts and\r\ndeer-paunches. The wind was blowing from the south-east, and the\r\ntemperature went up to thirty-two degrees. The sun pierced through\r\nthe fog, and the ice was getting a little loosened under its dissolving\r\naction. But the reflection of the white rays produced a sad effect\r\non the eyesight of several of the crew. Wolsten, the gunsmith, Gripper,\r\nClifton, and Bell were struck with snow blindness, a kind of weakness\r\nin the eyes very frequent in spring, and which determines, amongst\r\nthe Esquimaux, numerous cases of blindness. The doctor advised those\r\nwho were so afflicted and their companions in general to cover their\r\nfaces with green gauze, and he was the first to put his own\r\nprescription into execution.\r\n\r\nThe dogs bought by Shandon at Uppernawik were of a rather savage nature,\r\nbut in the end they became accustomed to the ship; the captain did\r\nnot take the arrival of these new comrades too much to heart, and\r\nhe seemed to know their habits. Clifton was not the last to remark\r\nthe fact that the captain must already have been in communication\r\nwith his Greenland brethren, as on land they were always famished\r\nand reduced by incomplete nourishment; they only thought of\r\nrecruiting themselves by the diet on board.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th of May the _Forward_ touched within a few cables' length\r\nthe most westerly of the Baffin Isles. The doctor noticed several\r\nrocks in the bay between the islands and the continent, those called\r\nCrimson Cliffs; they were covered over with snow as red as carmine,\r\nto which Dr. Kane gives a purely vegetable origin. Clawbonny wanted\r\nto consider this phenomenon nearer, but the ice prevented them\r\napproaching the coast; although the temperature had a tendency to\r\nrise, it was easy enough to see that the icebergs and ice-streams\r\nwere accumulating to the north of Baffin's Sea. The land offered a\r\nvery different aspect from that of Uppernawik; immense glaciers were\r\noutlined on the horizon against a greyish sky. On the 10th the\r\n_Forward_ left Hingston Bay on the right, near to the seventy-fourth\r\ndegree of latitude. Several hundred miles westward the Lancaster\r\nChannel opened out into the sea.\r\n\r\nBut afterwards that immense extent of water disappeared under\r\nenormous fields of ice, upon which hummocks rose up as regularly as\r\na crystallisation of the same substance. Shandon had the steam put\r\non, and up to the 11th of May the _Forward_ wound amongst the sinuous\r\nrocks, leaving the print of a track on the sky, caused by the black\r\nsmoke from her funnels. But new obstacles were soon encountered; the\r\npaths were getting closed up in consequence of the incessant\r\ndisplacement of the floating masses; at every minute a failure of\r\nwater in front of the _Forward's_ prow became imminent, and if she\r\nhad been nipped it would have been difficult to extricate her. They\r\nall knew it, and thought about it.\r\n\r\nOn board this vessel, without aim or known destination, foolishly\r\nseeking to advance towards the north, some symptoms of hesitation\r\nwere manifested amongst those men, accustomed to an existence of\r\ndanger; many, forgetting the advantages offered, regretted having\r\nventured so far, and already a certain demoralisation prevailed in\r\ntheir minds, still more increased by Clifton's fears, and the idle\r\ntalk of two or three of the leaders, such as Pen, Gripper, Warren,\r\nand Wolston.\r\n\r\nTo the uneasiness of the crew were joined overwhelming fatigues, for\r\non the 12th of May the brig was closed in on every side; her steam\r\nwas powerless, and it was necessary to force a road through the\r\nice-fields. The working of the saws was very difficult in the floes,\r\nwhich measured from six to seven feet in thickness. When two parallel\r\ngrooves divided the ice for the length of a hundred feet, they had\r\nto break the interior part with hatchets or handspikes; then took\r\nplace the elongation of the anchors, fixed in a hole by means of a\r\nthick auger; afterwards the working of the capstan began, and in this\r\nway the vessel was hauled over. The greatest difficulty consisted\r\nin driving the smashed pieces under the floes in order to open up\r\na free passage for the ship, and to thrust them away they were\r\ncompelled to use long iron-spiked poles.\r\n\r\nAt last, what with the working of the saws, the hauling, the capstan\r\nand poles, incessant, dangerous, and forced work, in the midst of\r\nfogs or thick snow, the temperature relatively low, ophthalmic\r\nsuffering and moral uneasiness, all contributed to discourage the\r\ncrew, and react on the men's imagination. When sailors have an\r\nenergetic, audacious, and convinced man to do with, who knows what\r\nhe wants, where he is bound for, and what end he has in view, confidence\r\nsustains them in spite of everything. They make one with their chief,\r\nfeeling strong in his strength, and quiet in his tranquillity; but\r\non the brig it was felt that the commander was not sure of himself,\r\nthat he hesitated before his unknown end and destination. In spite\r\nof his energetic nature, his weakness showed itself in his changing\r\norders, incomplete manoeuvres, stormy reflections, and a thousand\r\ndetails which could not escape the notice of the crew.\r\n\r\nBesides, Shandon was not captain of the ship, a sufficient reason\r\nfor argument about his orders; from argument to a refusal to obey\r\nthe step is easy. The discontented soon added to their number the\r\nfirst engineer, who up to now had remained a slave to his duty.\r\n\r\nOn May 16th, six days after the _Forward's_ arrival at the icebergs,\r\nShandon had not gained two miles northward, and the ice threatened\r\nto freeze in the brig till the following season. This was becoming\r\ndangerous. Towards eight in the evening Shandon and the doctor,\r\naccompanied by Garry, went on a voyage of discovery in the midst of\r\nthe immense plains; they took care not to go too far away from the\r\nvessel, as it was difficult to fix any landmarks in those white\r\nsolitudes, the aspects of which changed constantly.\r\n\r\nThe refraction produced strange effects; they still astonished the\r\ndoctor; where he thought he had only one foot to leap he found it\r\nwas five or six, or the contrary; and in both cases the result was\r\na fall, if not dangerous, at least painful, on the frozen ice as hard\r\nas glass.\r\n\r\nShandon and his two companions went in search of a practicable passage.\r\nThree miles from the ship they succeeded, not without trouble, in\r\nclimbing the iceberg, which was perhaps three hundred feet high.\r\n\r\nFrom this point their view extended over that desolated mass which\r\nlooked like the ruins of a gigantic town with its beaten-down obelisks,\r\nits overthrown steeples and palaces turned upside down all in a\r\nlump--in fact, a genuine chaos. The sun threw long oblique rays of\r\na light without warmth, as if heat-absorbing substances were placed\r\nbetween it and that gloomy country. The sea seemed to be frozen to\r\nthe remotest limits of view.\r\n\r\n\"How shall we get through?\" exclaimed the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"I have not the least idea,\" replied Shandon; \"but we will get through,\r\neven if we are obliged to employ powder to blow up those mountains,\r\nfor I certainly won't let that ice shut me up till next spring.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nevertheless, such was the fate of the _Fox_, almost in these same\r\nquarters. Never mind,\" continued the doctor, \"we shall get through\r\nwith a little philosophy. Believe me, that is worth all the engines\r\nin the world.\"\r\n\r\n\"You must acknowledge,\" replied Shandon, \"that the year doesn't begin\r\nunder very favourable auspices.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is incontestable, and I notice that Baffin's Sea has a tendency\r\nto return to the same state in which it was before 1817.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you think, doctor, that the present state of things has not\r\nalways existed?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; from time to time there are vast breakings up which scientific\r\nmen can scarcely explain; thus, up to 1817 this sea was constantly\r\nobstructed, when suddenly an immense cataclysm took place which drove\r\nback these icebergs into the ocean, the great part of which were\r\nstranded on Newfoundland Bank. From that time Baffin's Bay has been\r\nalmost free, and has become the haunt of numerous whalers.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then, since that epoch, voyages to the north have been easier?\"\r\n\r\n\"Incomparably so; but for the last few years it has been observed\r\nthat the bay has a tendency to be closed up again, and according to\r\ninvestigations made by navigators, it may probably be so for a long\r\ntime--a still greater reason for us to go on as far as possible. Just\r\nnow we look like people who get into unknown galleries, the doors\r\nof which are always shut behind them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you advise me to back out?\" asked Shandon, endeavouring to read\r\nthe answer in the doctor's eyes.\r\n\r\n\"I! I have never known how to take a step backward, and should we\r\nnever return, I say 'Go ahead.' However, I should like to make known\r\nto you that if we do anything imprudent, we know very well what we\r\nare exposed to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, Garry, what do you think about it?\" asked Shandon of the sailor.\r\n\r\n\"I? Commander, I should go on; I'm of the same opinion as Mr.\r\nClawbonny; but you do as you please; command, and we will obey.\"\r\n\r\n\"They don't all speak like you, Garry,\" replied Shandon. \"They aren't\r\nall in an obedient humour! Suppose they were to refuse to execute\r\nmy orders?\"\r\n\r\n\"Commander,\" replied Garry coldly, \"I have given you my advice because\r\nyou asked me for it; but you are not obliged to act upon it.\"\r\n\r\nShandon did not reply; he attentively examined the horizon, and\r\ndescended with his two companions on to the ice-field.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nTHE DEVIL'S THUMB\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the commander's absence the men had gone through divers works\r\nin order to make the ship fit to avoid the pressure of the ice-fields.\r\nPen, Clifton, Gripper, Bolton, and Simpson were occupied in this\r\nlaborious work; the stoker and the two engineers were even obliged\r\nto come to the aid of their comrades, for, from the instant they were\r\nnot wanted at the engine, they again became sailors, and, as such,\r\nthey could be employed in all kinds of work on board. But this was\r\nnot accomplished without a great deal of grumbling.\r\n\r\n\"I'll tell you what,\" said Pen, \"I've had enough of it, and if in\r\nthree days the breaking up isn't come, I'll swear to God that I'll\r\nchuck up!\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll chuck up?\" replied Gripper; \"you'd do better to help us to\r\nback out. Do you think we are in the humour to winter here till next\r\nyear?\"\r\n\r\n\"To tell you the truth, it would be a dreary winter,\" said Plover,\r\n\"for the ship is exposed from every quarter.\"\r\n\r\n\"And who knows,\" added Brunton, \"if even next spring we should find\r\nthe sea freer than it is now?\"\r\n\r\n\"We aren't talking about next spring,\" said Pen; \"to-day's Thursday;\r\nif next Sunday morning the road ain't clear, we'll back out south.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's the ticket!\" cried Clifton.\r\n\r\n\"Are you all agreed?\" said Pen.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered all his comrades.\r\n\r\n\"That's right enough,\" answered Warren, \"for if we are obliged to\r\nwork like this, hauling the ship by the strength of our arms, my advice\r\nis to backwater.\"\r\n\r\n\"We'll see about that on Sunday,\" answered Wolsten.\r\n\r\n\"As soon as I get the order,\" said Brunton, \"I'll soon get my steam\r\nup.\"\r\n\r\n\"Or we'd manage to get it up ourselves,\" said Clifton.\r\n\r\n\"If any of the officers,\" said Pen, \"wants to have the pleasure of\r\nwintering here, we'll let him. He can build himself a snow-hut like\r\nthe Esquimaux.\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing of the kind, Pen,\" replied Brunton; \"we won't leave anybody.\r\nYou understand that, you others. Besides, I don't think it would be\r\ndifficult to persuade the commander; he already seems very uncertain,\r\nand if we were quietly to propose it----\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know that,\" said Plover; \"Richard Shandon is a hard,\r\nheadstrong man, and we should have to sound him carefully.\"\r\n\r\n\"When I think,\" replied Bolton, with a covetous sigh, \"that in a month\r\nwe might be back in Liverpool; we could soon clear the southern\r\nice-line. The pass in Davis's Straits will be open in the beginning\r\nof June, and we shall only have to let ourselves drift into the\r\nAtlantic.\"\r\n\r\n\"Besides,\" said the prudent Clifton, \"if we bring back the commander\r\nwith us, acting under his responsibility, our pay and bounty money\r\nwill be sure; whilst if we return alone it won't be so certain.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's certain!\" said Plover; \"that devil of a Clifton speaks like\r\na book. Let us try to have nothing to explain to the Admiralty; it's\r\nmuch safer to leave no one behind us.\"\r\n\r\n\"But if the officers refuse to follow us?\" replied Pen, who wished\r\nto push his comrades to an extremity.\r\n\r\nTo such a question they were puzzled to reply.\r\n\r\n\"We shall see about it when the time comes,\" replied Bolton; \"besides,\r\nit would be enough to win Richard Shandon over to our side. We shall\r\nhave no difficulty about that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Anyhow,\" said Pen, swearing, \"there's something I'll leave here if\r\nI get an arm eaten in the attempt.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah! you mean the dog,\" said Plover.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, the dog; and before long I'll settle his hash!\"\r\n\r\n\"The more so,\" replied Clifton, coming back to his favourite theme,\r\n\"that the dog is the cause of all our misfortunes.\"\r\n\r\n\"He's cast an evil spell over us,\" said Plover.\r\n\r\n\"It's through him we're in an iceberg,\" said Gripper.\r\n\r\n\"He's the cause that we've had more ice against us than has ever been\r\nseen at this time of year,\" said Wolsten.\r\n\r\n\"He's the cause of my bad eyes,\" said Brunton.\r\n\r\n\"He's cut off the gin and brandy,\" added Pen.\r\n\r\n\"He's the cause of everything,\" said the assembly, getting excited.\r\n\r\n\"And he's captain into the bargain!\" cried Clifton.\r\n\r\n\"Well, captain of ill-luck,\" said Pen, whose unreasonable fury grew\r\nstronger at every word; \"you wanted to come here, and here you'll\r\nstay.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how are we to nap him?\" said Plover.\r\n\r\n\"We've a good opportunity,\" replied Clifton; \"the commander isn't\r\non deck, the lieutenant is asleep in his cabin, and the fog's thick\r\nenough to stop Johnson seeing us.\"\r\n\r\n\"But where's the dog?\" cried Pen.\r\n\r\n\"He's asleep near the coalhole,\" replied Clifton, \"and if anybody\r\nwants----\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll take charge of him,\" answered Pen furiously.\r\n\r\n\"Look out, Pen, he's got teeth that could snap an iron bar in two.\"\r\n\r\n\"If he moves I'll cut him open,\" cried Pen, taking his knife in one\r\nhand. He bounced in between decks, followed by Warren, who wanted\r\nto help him in his undertaking. They quickly came back, carrying the\r\nanimal in their arms, strongly muzzled, with his paws bound tightly\r\ntogether. They had taken him by surprise whilst he slept, so that\r\nthe unfortunate dog could not escape them.\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah for Pen!\" cried Plover.\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean to do with him now you've got him?\" asked Clifton.\r\n\r\n\"Why, drown him, and if ever he gets over it----\" replied Pen, with\r\na fearful smile of satisfaction.\r\n\r\nAbout two hundred steps from the vessel there was a seal-hole, a kind\r\nof circular crevice cut out by the teeth of that amphibious animal,\r\nhollowed out from underneath, and through which the seal comes up\r\nto breathe on to the surface of the ice. To keep this aperture from\r\nclosing up he has to be very careful because the formation of his\r\njaws would not enable him to bore through the hole again from the\r\noutside, and in a moment of danger he would fall a prey to his enemies.\r\nPen and Warren directed their steps towards this crevice, and there,\r\nin spite of the dog's energetic efforts, he was unmercifully\r\nprecipitated into the sea. An enormous lump of ice was then placed\r\nover the opening, thus closing all possible issue to the poor animal,\r\nwalled up in a watery prison.\r\n\r\n\"Good luck to you, captain,\" cried the brutal sailor.\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards Pen and Warren returned on deck. Johnson had seen\r\nnothing of this performance. The fog thickened round about the ship,\r\nand snow began to fall with violence. An hour later, Richard Shandon,\r\nthe doctor, and Garry rejoined the _Forward_. Shandon had noticed\r\na pass in a north-eastern direction of which he was resolved to take\r\nadvantage, and gave his orders in consequence. The crew obeyed with\r\na certain activity, not without hinting to Shandon that it was\r\nimpossible to go further on, and that they only gave him three more\r\ndays' obedience. During a part of the night and the following day\r\nthe working of the saws and the hauling were actively kept up; the\r\n_Forward_ gained about two miles further north. On the 18th she was\r\nin sight of land, and at five or six cable-lengths from a peculiar\r\npeak, called from its strange shape the Devil's Thumb.\r\n\r\nIt was there that the _Prince Albert_ in 1851, and the _Advance_ with\r\nKane, in 1853, were kept prisoners by the ice for several weeks. The\r\nodd form of the Devil's Thumb, the dreary deserts in its vicinity,\r\nthe vast circus of icebergs--some of them more than three hundred\r\nfeet high--the cracking of the ice, reproduced by the echo in so\r\nsinister a manner, rendered the position of the _Forward_ horribly\r\ndreary. Shandon understood the necessity of getting out of it and\r\ngoing further ahead. Twenty-four hours later, according to his\r\nestimation, he had been able to clear the fatal coast for about two\r\nmiles, but this was not enough. Shandon, overwhelmed with fear, and\r\nthe false situation in which he was placed, lost both courage and\r\nenergy; in order to obey his instructions and get further north, he\r\nhad thrown his vessel into an excessively perilous situation. The\r\nmen were worn out by the hauling; it required more than three hours\r\nto hollow out a channel twenty feet long, through ice that was usually\r\nfrom four to five feet thick. The health of the crew threatened to\r\nbreak down. Shandon was astonished at the silence of his men and their\r\nunaccustomed obedience, but he feared that it was the calm before\r\nthe storm. Who can judge, then, of his painful disappointment,\r\nsurprise, and despair when he perceived that in consequence of an\r\ninsensible movement of the ice-field the _Forward_ had, during the\r\nnight from the 18th to the 19th, lost all the advantage she had gained\r\nwith so much toil? On the Saturday morning they were once more opposite\r\nthe ever-threatening Devil's Thumb, and in a still more critical\r\nposition. The icebergs became more numerous, and drifted by in the\r\nfog like phantoms. Shandon was in a state of complete demoralisation,\r\nfor fright had taken possession of the dauntless man and his crew.\r\nShandon had heard the dog's disappearance spoken about, but dared\r\nnot punish those who were guilty of it. He feared that a rebellion\r\nmight be the consequence. The weather was fearful during the whole\r\nday; the snow rose up in thick whirlpools, wrapping up the _Forward_\r\nin an impenetrable cloak. Sometimes, under the action of the storm,\r\nthe fog was torn asunder, and displayed towards land, raised up like\r\na spectre, the Devil's Thumb.\r\n\r\nThe _Forward_ was anchored to an immense block of ice; it was all\r\nthat could be done; there was nothing more to attempt; the obscurity\r\nbecame denser, and the man at the helm could not see James Wall, who\r\nwas on duty in the bow. Shandon withdrew to his cabin, a prey to\r\nunremitting uneasiness; the doctor was putting his voyage notes in\r\norder; one half the crew remained on deck, the other half stayed in\r\nthe common cabin. At one moment, when the storm increased in fury,\r\nthe Devil's Thumb seemed to rise up out of all proportion in the midst\r\nof the fog.\r\n\r\n\"Good God!\" cried Simpson, drawing back with fright.\r\n\r\n\"What the devil's that?\" said Foker, and exclamations rose up in every\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n\"It is going to smash us!\"\r\n\r\n\"We are lost!\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Wall! Mr. Wall!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's all over with us!\"\r\n\r\n\"Commander! Commander!\"\r\n\r\nThese cries were simultaneously uttered by the men on watch. Wall\r\nfled to the quarter-deck, and Shandon, followed by the doctor, rushed\r\non deck to look. In the midst of the fog the Devil's Thumb seemed\r\nto have suddenly neared the brig, and seemed to have grown in a most\r\nfantastic manner. At its summit rose up a second cone, turned upside\r\ndown and spindled on its point; its enormous mass threatened to crush\r\nthe ship, as it was oscillating and ready to fall. It was a most fearful\r\nsight; every one instinctively drew back, and several sailors,\r\nleaping on to the ice, abandoned the ship.\r\n\r\n\"Let no one move!\" cried the commander in a severe voice. \"Every one\r\nto his post!\"\r\n\r\n\"How now, my friends? There's nothing to be frightened at!\" said the\r\ndoctor. \"There's no danger! Look, commander, look ahead, Mr. Wall;\r\nit's only an effect of the mirage, nothing else.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are quite right, Mr. Clawbonny,\" answered Johnson; \"those fools\r\nwere frightened at a shadow.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the doctor had spoken most of the sailors drew near, and their\r\nfear changed to admiration at the wonderful phenomenon, which shortly\r\ndisappeared from sight.\r\n\r\n\"They call that a mirage?\" said Clifton. \"Well, you may believe me\r\nthat the devil has something to do with it.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's certain!\" replied Gripper.\r\n\r\nBut when the fog cleared away it disclosed to the eyes of the commander\r\nan immense free and unexpected passage; it seemed to run away from\r\nthe coast, and he therefore determined to seize such a favourable\r\nhazard. Men were placed on each side of the creek, hawsers were lowered\r\ndown to them, and they began to tow the vessel in a northerly direction.\r\nDuring long hours this work was actively executed in silence. Shandon\r\ncaused the steam to be got up, in order to take advantage of the\r\nfortunate discovery of this channel.\r\n\r\n\"This,\" said he to Johnson, \"is a most providential hazard, and if\r\nwe can only get a few miles ahead, we shall probably get to the end\r\nof our misfortunes.\"\r\n\r\n\"Brunton! stir up the fires, and as soon as there's enough pressure\r\nlet me know. In the meantime our men will pluck up their courage--that\r\nwill be so much gained. They are in a hurry to run away from the Devil's\r\nThumb; we'll take advantage of their good inclinations!\"\r\n\r\nAll at once the progress of the _Forward_ was abruptly arrested.\r\n\r\n\"What's up?\" cried Shandon. \"I say, Wall! have we broken our\r\ntow-ropes?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all, commander,\" answered Wall, looking over the side. \"Hallo!\r\nHere are the men coming back again. They are climbing the ship's side\r\nas if the devil was at their heels.\"\r\n\r\n\"What the deuce can it be?\" cried Shandon, rushing forward.\r\n\r\n\"On board! On board!\" cried the terrified sailors.\r\n\r\nShandon looked in a northerly direction, and shuddered in spite of\r\nhimself. A strange animal, with appalling movements, whose foaming\r\ntongue emerged from enormous jaws, was leaping about at a cable's\r\nlength from the ship. In appearance he seemed to be about twenty feet\r\nhigh, with hair like bristles; he was following up the sailors, whilst\r\nhis formidable tail, ten feet long, was sweeping the snow and throwing\r\nit up in thick whirlwinds. The sight of such a monster riveted the\r\nmost daring to the spot.\r\n\r\n\"It's a bear!\" said one.\r\n\r\n\"It's the Gevaudan beast!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's the lion of the Apocalypse!\"\r\n\r\nShandon ran to his cabin for a gun he always kept loaded. The doctor\r\narmed himself, and held himself in readiness to fire upon an animal\r\nwhich, by its dimensions, recalled the antediluvian quadrupeds. He\r\nneared the ship in immense leaps; Shandon and the doctor fired at\r\nthe same time, when, suddenly, the report of their firearms, shaking\r\nthe atmospheric stratum, produced an unexpected effect. The doctor\r\nlooked attentively, and burst out laughing.\r\n\r\n\"It's the refraction!\" he exclaimed.\r\n\r\n\"Only the refraction!\" repeated Shandon. But a fearful exclamation\r\nfrom the crew interrupted them.\r\n\r\n\"The dog!\" said Clifton.\r\n\r\n\"The dog, captain!\" repeated all his comrades.\r\n\r\n\"Himself!\" cried Pen; \"always that cursed brute.\"\r\n\r\nThey were not mistaken--it was the dog. Having got loose from his\r\nshackles, he had regained the surface by another crevice. At that\r\ninstant the refraction, through a phenomenon common to these\r\nlatitudes, caused him to appear under formidable dimensions, which\r\nthe shaking of the air had dispersed; but the vexatious effect was\r\nnone the less produced upon the minds of the sailors, who were very\r\nlittle disposed to admit an explanation of the fact by purely physical\r\nreasons. The adventure of the Devil's Thumb, the reappearance of the\r\ndog under such fantastic circumstances, gave the finishing touch to\r\ntheir mental faculties, and murmurs broke out on all sides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\nCAPTAIN HATTERAS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Forward_, under steam, rapidly made its way between the\r\nice-mountains and the icebergs. Johnson was at the wheel. Shandon,\r\nwith his snow spectacles, was examining the horizon, but his joy was\r\nof short duration, for he soon discovered that the passage ended in\r\na circus of mountains. However, he preferred going on, in spite of\r\nthe difficulty, to going back. The dog followed the brig at a long\r\ndistance, running along the plain, but if he lagged too far behind\r\na singular whistle could be distinguished, which he immediately\r\nobeyed. The first time this whistle was heard the sailors looked round\r\nabout them; they were alone on deck all together, and no stranger\r\nwas to be seen; and yet the whistle was again heard from time to time.\r\nClifton was the first alarmed.\r\n\r\n\"Do you hear?\" said he. \"Just look how that animal answers when he\r\nhears the whistle.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can scarcely believe my eyes,\" answered Gripper.\r\n\r\n\"It's all over!\" cried Pen. \"I don't go any further.\"\r\n\r\n\"Pen's right!\" replied Brunton; \"it's tempting God!\"\r\n\r\n\"Tempting the devil!\" replied Clifton. \"I'd sooner lose my bounty\r\nmoney than go a step further.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall never get back!\" said Bolton in despair.\r\n\r\nThe crew had arrived at the highest pitch of insubordination.\r\n\r\n\"Not a step further!\" cried Wolsten. \"Are you all of the same mind?\"\r\n\r\n\"Ay! ay!\" answered all the sailors.\r\n\r\n\"Come on, then,\" said Bolton; \"let's go and find the commander; I'll\r\nundertake the talking.\"\r\n\r\nThe sailors in a tight group swayed away towards the poop. The\r\n_Forward_ at the time was penetrating into a vast circus, which\r\nmeasured perhaps 800 feet in diameter, and with the exception of one\r\nentrance--that by which the vessel had come--was entirely closed up.\r\n\r\nShandon said that he had just imprisoned himself; but what was he\r\nto do? How were they to retrace their steps? He felt his responsibility,\r\nand his hand grasped the telescope. The doctor, with folded arms,\r\nkept silent; he was contemplating the walls of ice, the medium\r\naltitude of which was over 300 feet. A foggy dome remained suspended\r\nabove the gulf. It was at this instant that Bolton addressed his speech\r\nto the commander.\r\n\r\n\"Commander!\" said he in a trembling voice, \"we can't go any further.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you say?\" replied Shandon, whose consciousness of\r\ndisregarded authority made the blood rise to the roots of his hair.\r\n\r\n\"Commander,\" replied Bolton, \"we say that we've done enough for that\r\ninvisible captain, and we are decided to go no further ahead.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are decided?\" cried Shandon. \"You talk thus, Bolton? Take care!\"\r\n\r\n\"Your threats are all the same to us,\" brutally replied Pen; \"we won't\r\ngo an inch further.\"\r\n\r\nShandon advanced towards the mutineers; at the same time the mate\r\ncame up and said in a whisper: \"Commander, if you wish to get out\r\nof here we haven't a minute to lose; there's an iceberg drifting up\r\nthe pass, and it is very likely to cork up all issue and keep us\r\nprisoners.\"\r\n\r\nShandon examined the situation.\r\n\r\n\"You will give an account of your conduct later on, you fellows,\"\r\nsaid he. \"Now heave aboard!\"\r\n\r\nThe sailors rushed to their posts, and the _Forward_ quickly veered\r\nround; the fires were stuffed with coals; the great question was to\r\noutrun the floating mountain. It was a struggle between the brig and\r\nthe iceberg. The former, in order to get through, was running south;\r\nthe latter was drifting north, ready to close up every passage.\r\n\r\n\"Steam up! steam up!\" cried Shandon. \"Do you hear, Brunton?\"\r\n\r\nThe _Forward_ glided like a bird amidst the struggling icebergs, which\r\nher prow sent to the right-about; the brig's hull shivered under the\r\naction of the screw, and the manometer indicated a prodigious tension\r\nof steam, for it whistled with a deafening noise.\r\n\r\n\"Load the valves!\" cried Shandon, and the engineer obeyed at the risk\r\nof blowing up the ship; but his despairing efforts were in vain. The\r\niceberg, caught up by an undercurrent, rapidly approached the pass.\r\nThe brig was still about three cables' length from it, when the\r\nmountain, entering like a corner-stone into the open space, strongly\r\nadhered to its neighbours and closed up all issue.\r\n\r\n\"We are lost!\" cried Shandon, who could not retain the imprudent\r\nwords.\r\n\r\n\"Lost!\" repeated the crew.\r\n\r\n\"Let them escape who can!\" said some.\r\n\r\n\"Lower the shore boats!\" said others.\r\n\r\n\"To the steward's room!\" cried Pen and several of his band, \"and if\r\nwe are to be drowned, let's drown ourselves in gin!\"\r\n\r\nDisorder among the men was at its height. Shandon felt himself\r\novercome; when he wished to command, he stammered and hesitated. His\r\nthought was unable to make way through his words. The doctor was\r\nwalking about in agitation. Johnson stoically folded his arms and\r\nsaid nothing. All at once a strong, imperious, and energetic voice\r\nwas heard to pronounce these words:\r\n\r\n\"Every man to his post and tack about!\"\r\n\r\nJohnson started, and, hardly knowing what he did, turned the wheel\r\nrapidly. He was just in time, for the brig, launched at full speed,\r\nwas about to crush herself against her prison walls. But while Johnson\r\nwas instinctively obeying, Shandon, Clawbonny, the crew, and all down\r\nto the stoker Warren, who had abandoned his fires, even black Strong,\r\nwho had left his cooking, were all mustered on deck, and saw emerge\r\nfrom that cabin the only man who was in possession of the key, and\r\nthat man was Garry, the sailor.\r\n\r\n\"Sir!\" cried Shandon, becoming pale. \"Garry--you--by what right do\r\nyou command here?\"\r\n\r\n\"Dick,\" called out Garry, reproducing that whistle which had so much\r\nsurprised the crew. The dog, at the sound of his right name, jumped\r\nwith one bound on to the poop and lay quietly down at his master's\r\nfeet. The crew did not say a word. The key which the captain of the\r\n_Forward_ alone possessed, the dog sent by him, and who came thus\r\nto verify his identity, that commanding accent which it was impossible\r\nto mistake--all this acted strongly on the minds of the sailors, and\r\nwas sufficient to establish Garry's authority.\r\n\r\nBesides, Garry was no longer recognisable; he had cut off the long\r\nwhiskers which had covered his face, which made it look more energetic\r\nand imperious than ever; dressed in the clothes of his rank which\r\nhad been deposited in the cabin, he appeared in the insignia of\r\ncommander.\r\n\r\nThen immediately, with that mobility which characterised them, the\r\ncrew of the _Forward_ cried out--\"Three cheers for the captain!\"\r\n\r\n\"Shandon!\" said the latter to his second, \"muster the crew; I am going\r\nto inspect it!\"\r\n\r\nShandon obeyed and gave orders with an altered voice. The captain\r\nadvanced to meet his officers and men, saying something suitable to\r\neach, and treating each according to his past conduct. When he had\r\nfinished the inspection, he returned on to the poop, and with a calm\r\nvoice pronounced the following words:\r\n\r\n\"Officers and sailors, like you, I am English, and my motto is that\r\nof Nelson, 'England expects that every man will do his duty.' As an\r\nEnglishman I am resolved, we are resolved, that no bolder men shall\r\ngo further than we have been. As an Englishman I will not allow, we\r\nwill not allow, other people to have the glory of pushing further\r\nnorth themselves. If ever human foot can step upon the land of the\r\nNorth Pole, it shall be the foot of an Englishman. Here is our\r\ncountry's flag. I have equipped this vessel, and consecrated my\r\nfortune to this enterprise, and, if necessary, I shall consecrate\r\nto it my life and yours; for I am determined that these colours shall\r\nfloat on the North Pole. Take courage. From this day, for every degree\r\nwe can gain northwards the sum of a thousand pounds will be awarded\r\nto you. There are ninety, for we are now in the seventy-second. Count\r\nthem. Besides, my name is enough. It means energy and patriotism.\r\nI am Captain Hatteras!\"\r\n\r\n\"Captain Hatteras!\" exclaimed Shandon, and that name, well known to\r\nEnglish sailors, was whispered amongst the crew.\r\n\r\n\"Now,\" continued Hatteras, \"anchor the brig to the ice, put out the\r\nfires, and each of you return to your usual work. Shandon, I wish\r\nto hold a council with you relative to affairs on board. Join me with\r\nthe doctor, Wall, and the boatswain in my cabin. Johnson, disperse\r\nthe men.\"\r\n\r\nHatteras, calm and haughty, quietly left the poop. In the meantime\r\nShandon was anchoring the brig.\r\n\r\nWho, then, was this Hatteras, and for what reason did his name make\r\nsuch a profound impression upon the crew? John Hatteras was the only\r\nson of a London brewer, who died in 1852 worth six millions of money.\r\nStill young, he embraced the maritime career in spite of the splendid\r\nfortune awaiting him. Not that he felt any vocation for commerce,\r\nbut the instinct of geographical discoveries was dear to him. He had\r\nalways dreamt of placing his foot where no mortal foot had yet soiled\r\nthe ground.\r\n\r\nAt the age of twenty he was already in possession of the vigorous\r\nconstitution of a thin and sanguine man; an energetic face, with lines\r\ngeometrically traced; a high and perpendicular forehead; cold but\r\nhandsome eyes; thin lips, which set off a mouth from which words rarely\r\nissued; a middle stature; solidly-jointed limbs, put in motion by\r\niron muscles; the whole forming a man endowed with a temperament fit\r\nfor anything. When you saw him you felt he was daring; when you heard\r\nhim you knew he was coldly determined; his was a character that never\r\ndrew back, ready to stake the lives of others as well as his own.\r\nIt was well to think twice before following him in his expeditions.\r\n\r\nJohn Hatteras was proud of being an Englishman. A Frenchman once said\r\nto him, with what he thought was refined politeness and amiability:\r\n\r\n\"If I were not a Frenchman I should like to be an Englishman.\"\r\n\r\n\"And if I were not an Englishman,\" answered Hatteras, \"I should like\r\nto be an Englishman.\"\r\n\r\nThat answer revealed the character of the man. It was a great grief\r\nto him that Englishmen had not the monopoly of geographical\r\ndiscoveries, and were, in fact, rather behind other nations in that\r\nfield.\r\n\r\nChristopher Columbus, the discoverer of America, was a Genoese; Vasco\r\nda Gama, a Portuguese, discovered India; another Portuguese,\r\nFernando de Andrada, China; and a third, Magellan, the Terra del Fuego.\r\nCanada was discovered by Jacques Cartier, a Frenchman; Labrador,\r\nBrazil, the Cape of Good Hope, the Azores, Madeira, Newfoundland,\r\nGuinea, Congo, Mexico, Cape Blanco, Greenland, Iceland, the South\r\nSeas, California, Japan, Cambodia, Peru, Kamtchatka, the Philippines,\r\nSpitzbergen, Cape Horn, Behring's Straits, Tasmania, New Zealand,\r\nNew Brittany, New Holland, Louisiana, Jean Mayen Island, were\r\ndiscovered by Icelanders, Scandinavians, French, Russians,\r\nPortuguese, Danes, Spaniards, Genoese, and Dutch, but not one by an\r\nEnglishman. Captain Hatteras could not reconcile himself to the fact\r\nthat Englishmen were excluded from the glorious list of navigators\r\nwho made the great discoveries of the 15th and 16th centuries.\r\n\r\nHatteras consoled himself a little when he turned to more modern times.\r\nThen Englishmen had the best of it with Sturt, Burke, Wills, King,\r\nand Grey in Australia; with Palliser in America; with Cyril Graham,\r\nWadington, and Cummingham in India; with Burton, Speke, Grant, and\r\nLivingstone in Africa.\r\n\r\nBut for a man like Hatteras this was not enough; from his point of\r\nview these bold travellers were _improvers_ rather than _inventors_;\r\nand he was determined to do something better, and he would have\r\ninvented a country if he could, only to have the honour of discovering\r\nit. Now he had noticed that, although Englishmen did not form a\r\nmajority amongst ancient discoverers, and that he had to go back to\r\nCook in 1774 to obtain New Caledonia and the Sandwich Isles, where\r\nthe unfortunate captain perished in 1778, yet there existed,\r\nnevertheless, a corner of the globe where they seemed to have united\r\nall their efforts. This corner was precisely the boreal lands and\r\nseas of North America. The list of Polar discoveries may be thus\r\nwritten:\r\n\r\nNova Zembla, discovered by Willoughby, in 1553; Weigatz Island, by\r\nBarrough, in 1556; the West Coast of Greenland, by Davis, in 1585;\r\nDavis's Straits, by Davis, in 1587; Spitzbergen, by Willoughby, in\r\n1596; Hudson's Bay, by Hudson, in 1610; Baffin's Bay, by Baffin, in\r\n1616.\r\n\r\nIn more modern times, Hearne, Mackenzie, John Ross, Parry, Franklin,\r\nRichardson, Beechey, James Ross, Back, Dease, Simpson, Rae,\r\nInglefield, Belcher, Austin, Kellett, Moore, McClure, Kennedy, and\r\nMcClintock have continually searched those unknown lands.\r\n\r\nThe limits of the northern coasts of America had been fixed, and the\r\nNorth-West passage almost discovered, but this was not enough; there\r\nwas something better still to be done, and John Hatteras had twice\r\nattempted it by equipping two ships at his own expense. He wanted\r\nto reach the North Pole, and thus crown the series of English\r\ndiscoveries by one of the most illustrious attempts. To attain the\r\nPole was the aim of his life.\r\n\r\nAfter a few successful cruises in the Southern seas, Hatteras\r\nendeavoured for the first time, in 1846, to go north by Baffin's Sea;\r\nbut he could not get beyond the seventy-fourth degree of latitude;\r\nhe was then commanding the sloop _Halifax_. His crew suffered\r\natrocious torments, and John Hatteras pushed his adventurous\r\nrashness so far, that, afterwards, sailors were little tempted to\r\nre-commence similar expeditions under such a chief.\r\n\r\nHowever, in 1850 Hatteras succeeded in enrolling on the schooner\r\n_Farewell_ about twenty determined men, tempted principally by the\r\nhigh prize offered for their audacity. It was upon that occasion that\r\nDr. Clawbonny entered into correspondence with John Hatteras, whom\r\nhe did not know, requesting to join the expedition, but happily for\r\nthe doctor the post was already filled up. The _Farewell_, following\r\nthe track taken in 1817 by the _Neptune_ from Aberdeen, got up to\r\nthe north of Spitzbergen as far as the seventy-sixth degree of\r\nlatitude. There the expedition was compelled to winter. But the\r\nsufferings of the crew from the intense cold were so great that not\r\na single man saw England again, with the exception of Hatteras himself,\r\nwho was brought back to his own country by a Danish whaler after a\r\nwalk of more than two hundred miles across the ice.\r\n\r\nThe sensation produced by the return of this one man was immense.\r\nWho in future would dare to follow Hatteras in his mad attempts?\r\nHowever, he did not despair of beginning again. His father, the brewer,\r\ndied, and he became possessor of a nabob's fortune. Soon after a\r\ngeographical fact bitterly stirred up John Hatteras. A brig, the\r\n_Advance_, manned by seventeen men, equipped by a merchant named\r\nGrinnell, under the command of Dr. Kane, and sent in search of Sir\r\nJohn Franklin, advanced in 1853 through Baffin's Sea and Smith's\r\nStrait, beyond the eighty-second degree of boreal latitude, much\r\nnearer the Pole than any of his predecessors. Now, this vessel was\r\nAmerican, Grinnell was American, and Kane was American. The\r\nEnglishman's disdain for the Yankee will be easily understood; in\r\nthe heart of Hatteras it changed to hatred; he was resolved to outdo\r\nhis audacious competitor and reach the Pole itself.\r\n\r\nFor two years he had been living incognito in Liverpool, passing\r\nhimself off as a sailor; he recognised in Richard Shandon the man\r\nhe wanted; he sent him an offer by an anonymous letter, and one to\r\nDr. Clawbonny at the same time. The _Forward_ was built, armed, and\r\nequipped. Hatteras took great care to conceal his name, for had it\r\nbeen known he would not have found a single man to accompany him.\r\nHe was determined not to take the command of the brig except in a\r\nmoment of danger, and when his crew had gone too far to draw back.\r\nHe had in reserve, as we have seen, such offers of money to make to\r\nthe men that not one of them would refuse to follow him to the other\r\nend of the world; and, in fact, it was right to the other end of the\r\nworld that he meant to go. Circumstances had become critical, and\r\nJohn Hatteras had made himself known. His dog, the faithful Dick,\r\nthe companion of his voyages, was the first to recognise him. Luckily\r\nfor the brave and unfortunately for the timid, it was well and duly\r\nestablished that John Hatteras was the captain of the _Forward_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\nTHE PROJECTS OF HATTERAS\r\n\r\n\r\nThe appearance of this bold personage was appreciated in different\r\nways by the crew; part of them completely rallied round him, either\r\nfrom love of money or daring; others submitted because they could\r\nnot help themselves, reserving their right to protest later on;\r\nbesides, resistance to such a man seemed, for the present, difficult.\r\nEach man went back to his post. The 20th of May fell on a Sunday,\r\nand was consequently a day of rest for the crew. A council was held\r\nby the captain, composed of the officers, Shandon, Wall, Johnson,\r\nand the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" said the captain in that voice at the same time soft\r\nand imperious which characterised him, \"you are aware that I intend\r\nto go as far as the Pole. I wish to know your opinion about this\r\nenterprise. Shandon, what do you think about it?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not for me to think, captain,\" coldly replied Shandon; \"I have\r\nonly to obey.\"\r\n\r\nHatteras was not surprised at the answer.\r\n\r\n\"Richard Shandon,\" continued he, not less coldly, \"I beg you will\r\nsay what you think about our chance of success.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, captain,\" answered Shandon, \"facts are there, and answer\r\nfor me; attempts of the same kind up till now have always failed;\r\nI hope we shall be more fortunate.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall be. What do you think, gentlemen?\"\r\n\r\n\"As far as I am concerned,\" replied the doctor, \"I consider your plan\r\npracticable, as it is certain that some day navigators will attain\r\nthe boreal Pole. I don't see why the honour should not fall to our\r\nlot.\"\r\n\r\n\"There are many things in our favour,\" answered Hatteras; \"our\r\nmeasures are taken in consequence, and we shall profit by the\r\nexperience of those who have gone before us. And thereupon, Shandon,\r\naccept my thanks for the care you have taken in fitting out this ship;\r\nthere are a few evil-disposed fellows amongst the crew that I shall\r\nhave to bring to reason, but on the whole I have only praises to give\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nShandon bowed coldly. His position on the _Forward_, which he thought\r\nto command, was a false one. Hatteras understood this, and did not\r\ninsist further.\r\n\r\n\"As to you, gentlemen,\" he continued, turning to Wall and Johnson,\r\n\"I could not have secured officers more distinguished for courage\r\nand experience.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, captain, I'm your man,\" answered Johnson, \"and although your\r\nenterprise seems to me rather daring, you may rely upon me till the\r\nend.\"\r\n\r\n\"And on me too,\" said James Wall.\r\n\r\n\"As to you, doctor, I know what you are worth.\"\r\n\r\n\"You know more than I do, then,\" quickly replied the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"Now, gentlemen,\" continued Hatteras, \"it is well you should learn\r\nupon what undeniable facts my pretension to arrive at the Pole is\r\nfounded. In 1817 the _Neptune_ got up to the north of Spitzbergen,\r\nas far as the eighty-second degree. In 1826 the celebrated Parry,\r\nafter his third voyage to the Polar Seas, started also from\r\nSpitzbergen Point, and by the aid of sledge-boats went a hundred and\r\nfifty miles northward. In 1852 Captain Inglefield penetrated into\r\nSmith's Inlet as far as seventy-eight degrees thirty-five minutes\r\nlatitude. All these vessels were English, and Englishmen, our\r\ncountrymen, commanded them.\" Here Hatteras paused. \"I ought to add,\"\r\nhe continued, with a constrained look, and as though the words were\r\nunable to leave his lips--\"I must add that, in 1854, Kane, the American,\r\ncommanding the brig _Advance_, went still higher, and that his\r\nlieutenant, Morton, going across the ice-fields, hoisted the United\r\nStates standard on the other side of the eighty-second degree. This\r\nsaid, I shall not return to the subject. Now what remains to be known\r\nis this, that the captains of the _Neptune_, the _Enterprise_, the\r\n_Isabel_, and the _Advance_ ascertained that proceeding from the\r\nhighest latitudes there existed a Polar basin entirely free from ice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Free from ice!\" exclaimed Shandon, interrupting the captain, \"that\r\nis impossible!\"\r\n\r\n\"You will notice, Shandon,\" quietly replied Hatteras, whose eye shone\r\nfor an instant, \"that I quote names and facts as a proof. I may even\r\nadd that during Captain Parry's station on the border of Wellington\r\nChannel, in 1851, his lieutenant, Stewart, also found himself in the\r\npresence of open sea, and this peculiarity was confirmed during Sir\r\nEdward Beecher's wintering in 1853, in Northumberland Bay, in 76\r\ndegrees 52 minutes N. latitude, and 99 degrees 20 minutes longitude.\r\nThe reports are incontestable, and it would be most unjust not to\r\nadmit them.\"\r\n\r\n\"However, captain,\" continued Shandon, \"those reports are so\r\ncontradictory.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are mistaken, Shandon,\" cried Dr. Clawbonny. \"These reports do\r\nnot contradict any scientific assertion, the captain will allow me\r\nto tell you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Go on, doctor,\" answered Hatteras.\r\n\r\n\"Well, listen, Shandon; it evidently follows from geographical facts,\r\nand from the study of isotherm lines, that the coldest point of the\r\nglobe is not at the Pole itself; like the magnetic point, it deviates\r\nseveral degrees from the Pole. The calculations of Brewster, Bergham,\r\nand several other natural philosophers show us that in our hemisphere\r\nthere are two cold Poles; one is situated in Asia at 79 degrees 30\r\nminutes N. latitude, and by 120 degrees E. longitude, and the other\r\nin America at 78 degrees N. latitude, and 97 degrees W. longitude.\r\nIt is with the latter that we have to do, and you see, Shandon, we\r\nhave met with it at more than twelve degrees below the Pole. Well,\r\nwhy should not the Polar Sea be as equally disengaged from ice as\r\nthe sixty-sixth parallel is in summer--that is to say, the south of\r\nBaffin's Bay?\"\r\n\r\n\"That's what I call well pleaded,\" replied Johnson. \"Mr. Clawbonny\r\nspeaks upon these matters like a professional man.\"\r\n\r\n\"It appears very probable,\" chimed in James Wall.\r\n\r\n\"All guess-work,\" answered Shandon obstinately.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Shandon,\" said Hatteras, \"let us take into consideration\r\neither case; either the sea is free from ice or it is not so, and\r\nneither of these suppositions can hinder us from attaining the Pole.\r\nIf the sea is free the _Forward_ will take us there without trouble;\r\nif it is frozen we will attempt the adventure upon our sledges. This,\r\nyou will allow, is not impracticable. When once our brig has attained\r\nthe eighty-third degree we shall only have six hundred miles to\r\ntraverse before reaching the Pole.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what are six hundred miles?\" quickly answered the doctor, \"when\r\nit is known that a Cossack, Alexis Markoff, went over the ice sea\r\nalong the northern coast of the Russian Empire, in sledges drawn by\r\ndogs, for the space of eight hundred miles in twenty-four days?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you hear that, Shandon?\" said Hatteras; \"can't Englishmen do as\r\nmuch as a Cossack?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course they can,\" cried the impetuous doctor.\r\n\r\n\"Of course,\" added the boatswain.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Shandon?\" said the captain.\r\n\r\n\"I can only repeat what I said before, captain,\" said Shandon--\"I\r\nwill obey.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good. And now,\" continued Hatteras, \"let us consider our present\r\nsituation. We are caught by the ice, and it seems to me impossible,\r\nfor this year at least, to get into Smith's Strait. Well, here, then,\r\nthis is what I propose.\"\r\n\r\nHatteras laid open upon the table one of the excellent maps published\r\nin 1859 by the order of the Admiralty.\r\n\r\n\"Be kind enough to follow me. If Smith's Strait is closed up from\r\nus, Lancaster Strait, on the west coast of Baffin's Sea, is not. I\r\nthink we ought to ascend that strait as far as Barrow Strait, and\r\nfrom there sail to Beechey Island; the same track has been gone over\r\na hundred times by sailing vessels; consequently with a screw we can\r\ndo it easily. Once at Beechey Island we will go north as far as possible,\r\nby Wellington Channel, up to the outlet of the creek which joins\r\nWellington's and Queen's Channels, at the very point where the open\r\nsea was perceived. It is now only the 20th of May; in a month, if\r\ncircumstances favour us, we shall have attained that point, and from\r\nthere we'll drive forward towards the Pole. What do you think about\r\nit, gentlemen?\"\r\n\r\n\"It is evidently the only track to follow,\" replied Johnson.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, we will take it from to-morrow. I shall let them rest\r\nto-day as it is Sunday. Shandon, you will take care that religious\r\nservice be attended to; it has a beneficial effect on the minds of\r\nmen, and a sailor above all needs to place confidence in the Almighty.\"\r\n\r\n\"It shall be attended to, captain,\" answered Shandon, who went out\r\nwith the lieutenant and the boatswain.\r\n\r\n\"Doctor!\" said Hatteras, pointing towards Shandon, \"there's a man\r\nwhose pride is wounded; I can no longer rely upon him.\"\r\n\r\nEarly the following day the captain caused the pirogue to be lowered\r\nin order to reconnoitre the icebergs in the vicinity, the breadth\r\nof which did not exceed 200 yards. He remarked that through a slow\r\npressure of the ice the basin threatened to become narrower. It became\r\nurgent, therefore, to make an aperture to prevent the ship being\r\ncrushed in a vice of the mountains. By the means employed by John\r\nHatteras, it is easy to observe that he was an energetic man.\r\n\r\nHe first had steps cut out in the walls of ice, and by their means\r\nclimbed to the summit of an iceberg. From that point he saw that it\r\nwas easy for him to cut out a road towards the south-west. By his\r\norders a blasting furnace was hollowed nearly in the heart of the\r\nmountain. This work, rapidly put into execution, was terminated by\r\nnoon on Monday. Hatteras could not rely on his eight or ten pound\r\nblasting cylinders, which would have had no effect on such masses\r\nas those. They were only sufficient to shatter ice-fields. He\r\ntherefore had a thousand pounds of powder placed in the blasting\r\nfurnace, of which the diffusive direction was carefully calculated.\r\nThis mine was provided with a long wick, bound in gutta-percha, the\r\nend of which was outside. The gallery conducting to the mine was filled\r\nup with snow and lumps of ice, which the cold of the following night\r\nmade as hard as granite. The temperature, under the influence of an\r\neasterly wind, came down to twelve degrees.\r\n\r\nAt seven the next morning the _Forward_ was held under steam, ready\r\nto profit by the smallest issue. Johnson was charged with setting\r\nfire to the wick, which, according to calculation, would burn for\r\nhalf an hour before setting fire to the mine. Johnson had, therefore,\r\nplenty of time to regain the brig; ten minutes after having executed\r\nHatteras's order he was again at his post. The crew remained on deck,\r\nfor the weather was dry and bright; it had left off snowing.\r\n\r\nHatteras was on the poop, chronometer in hand, counting the minutes;\r\nShandon and the doctor were with him. At eight thirty-five a dull\r\nexplosion was heard, much less loud than any one would have supposed.\r\nThe outline of the mountains was changed all at once as if by an\r\nearthquake; thick white smoke rose up to a considerable height in\r\nthe sky, leaving long crevices in the iceberg, the top part of which\r\nfell in pieces all round the _Forward_. But the path was not yet free;\r\nlarge blocks of ice remained suspended above the pass on the adjacent\r\nmountains, and there was every reason to fear that they would fall\r\nand close up the passage. Hatteras took in the situation at one glance.\r\n\r\n\"Wolsten!\" cried he.\r\n\r\nThe gunsmith hastened up.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, captain?\" cried he.\r\n\r\n\"Load the gun in the bow with a triple charge,\" said Hatteras, \"and\r\nwad it as hard as possible.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are we going to attack the mountain with cannon-balls?\" asked the\r\ndoctor.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered Hatteras, \"that would be useless. No bullet, Wolsten,\r\nbut a triple charge of powder. Look sharp!\"\r\n\r\nA few minutes after the gun was loaded.\r\n\r\n\"What does he mean to do without a bullet?\" muttered Shandon between\r\nhis teeth.\r\n\r\n\"We shall soon see,\" answered the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"Ready, captain!\" called out Wolsten.\r\n\r\n\"All right!\" replied Hatteras.\r\n\r\n\"Brunton!\" he called out to the engineer, \"a few turns ahead.\"\r\n\r\nBrunton opened the sliders, and the screw being put in movement, the\r\n_Forward_ neared the mined mountain.\r\n\r\n\"Aim at the pass!\" cried the captain to the gunsmith. The latter obeyed,\r\nand when the brig was only half a cable's length from it, Hatteras\r\ncalled out:\r\n\r\n\"Fire!\"\r\n\r\nA formidable report followed his order, and the blocks, shaken by\r\nthe atmospheric commotion, were suddenly precipitated into the sea;\r\nthe disturbance amongst the strata of the air had been sufficient\r\nto accomplish this.\r\n\r\n\"All steam on, Brunton! Straight for the pass, Johnson!\"\r\n\r\nThe latter was at the helm; the brig, driven along by her screw, which\r\nturned in the foaming waves, dashed into the middle of the then opened\r\npass; it was time, for scarcely had the _Forward_ cleared the opening\r\nthan her prison closed up again behind her. It was a thrilling moment,\r\nand on board there was only one stout and undisturbed heart--that\r\nof the captain. The crew, astonished at the manoeuvre, cried out:\r\n\r\n\"Hurrah for the captain!\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nEXPEDITION IN SEARCH OF FRANKLIN\r\n\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday, the 23rd of May, the _Forward_ had again taken up her\r\nadventurous navigation, cleverly tacking amongst the packs and\r\nicebergs. Thanks to steam, that obedient force which so many of our\r\nPolar sea navigators have had to do without, she appeared to be playing\r\nin the midst of the moving rocks. She seemed to recognise the hand\r\nof an experienced master, and like a horse under an able rider, she\r\nobeyed the thought of her captain. The temperature rose. At six\r\no'clock in the morning the thermometer marked twenty-six degrees,\r\nat six in the evening twenty-nine degrees, and at midnight twenty-five\r\ndegrees; the wind was lightly blowing from the south-east.\r\n\r\nOn Thursday, towards three in the morning, the _Forward_ was in sight\r\nof Possession Bay, on the coast of America. At the entrance to\r\nLancaster Strait, shortly after, the crew caught a glimpse of Burney\r\nCape. A few Esquimaux pulled off towards the vessel, but Hatteras\r\ndid not take the trouble to wait for them. The Byam-Martin peaks,\r\nwhich overlook Cape Liverpool, were sighted to the left, and soon\r\ndisappeared in the evening mists, which also prevented any\r\nobservation being taken from Cape Hay. This cape is so low that it\r\ngets confounded with the ice on the coast, a circumstance which often\r\nrenders the hydrographic determination of the Polar seas extremely\r\ndifficult.\r\n\r\nPuffins, ducks, and white sea-gulls showed up in very great numbers.\r\nThe _Forward_ was then in latitude 74 degrees 1 minute, and in\r\nlongitude 77 degrees 15 minutes. The snowy hoods of the two mountains,\r\nCatherine and Elizabeth, rose up above the clouds.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, at six o'clock, Cape Warender was passed on the right side\r\nof the strait, and on the left Admiralty Inlet, a bay that has been\r\nlittle explored by navigators, who are generally in a hurry to sail\r\naway west. The sea became rather rough, and the waves often swept\r\nthe deck of the brig, throwing up pieces of ice. The land on the north\r\ncoast, with its high table lands almost level, and which reverberated\r\nthe sun's rays, offered a very curious appearance.\r\n\r\nHatteras wanted to run along the north coast, in order to reach Beechey\r\nIsland and the entrance to Wellington Channel sooner; but continual\r\nicebergs compelled him, to his great annoyance, to follow the southern\r\npasses. That was why, on the 26th of May, the _Forward_ was abreast\r\nof Cape York in a thick fog interspersed with snow; a very high\r\nmountain, almost perpendicular, caused it to be recognised. The\r\nweather cleared up a little, and the sun, towards noon, appeared for\r\nan instant, allowing a tolerably good observation to be taken; 74\r\ndegrees 4 minutes latitude and 84 degrees 23 minutes longitude. The\r\n_Forward_ was then at the extremity of Lancaster Strait.\r\n\r\nHatteras pointed out to the doctor on his map the route already taken,\r\nand the one he meant to follow. The position of the brig at the time\r\nwas very interesting.\r\n\r\n\"I should like to have been further north,\" said he, \"but no one can\r\ndo the impossible; see, this is our exact situation.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the captain pricked his map at a short distance from Cape York.\r\n\r\n\"We are in the centre of this four-road way, open to every wind, fenced\r\nby the outlets of Lancaster Strait, Barrow Strait, Wellington Channel,\r\nand Regent's Passage; it is a point that all navigators in these seas\r\nhave been obliged to come to.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" replied the doctor, \"it must have puzzled them greatly; four\r\ncross-roads with no sign-posts to tell them which to take. How did\r\nParry, Ross, and Franklin manage?\"\r\n\r\n\"They did not manage at all, they were managed; they had no choice,\r\nI can assure you; sometimes Barrow Strait was closed to one of them,\r\nand the next year another found it open; sometimes the vessel was\r\nirresistibly drawn towards Regent's Passage, so that we have ended\r\nby becoming acquainted with these inextricable seas.\"\r\n\r\n\"What a singular country!\" said the doctor, examining the map. \"It\r\nis all in pieces, and they seem to have no logical connection. It\r\nseems as if the land in the vicinity of the North Pole had been cut\r\nup like this on purpose to make access to it more difficult, whilst\r\nthat in the other hemisphere quietly terminates in tapered-out points\r\nlike those of Cape Horn, the Cape of Good Hope, and the Indian\r\nPeninsula. Is it the greater rapidity of the equator which has thus\r\nmodified matters, whilst the land at the extremities, yet fluid from\r\nthe creation, has not been able to get condensed or agglomerated\r\ntogether, for want of a sufficiently rapid rotation?\"\r\n\r\n\"That must be the case, for everything on earth is logical, and\r\n'nothing is that errs from law,' and God often allows men to discover\r\nHis laws; make use of His permission, doctor.\"\r\n\r\n\"Unfortunately, I shall not be able to take much advantage of it,\"\r\nsaid the doctor, \"but the wind here is something dreadful,\" added\r\nhe, muffling himself up as well as he could.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, we are quite exposed to the north wind, and it is turning us\r\nout of our road.\"\r\n\r\n\"Anyhow it ought to drive the ice down south, and level a clear road.\"\r\n\r\n\"It ought to do so, doctor, but the wind does not always do what it\r\nought. Look, that ice-bank seems impenetrable. Never mind, we will\r\ntry to reach Griffith Island, sail round Cornwallis Island, and get\r\ninto Queen's Channel without going by Wellington Channel.\r\nNevertheless I positively desire to touch at Beechey Island in order\r\nto renew my coal provision.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" asked the astonished doctor.\r\n\r\n\"I mean that, according to orders from the Admiralty, large provisions\r\nhave been deposited on that island in order to provide for future\r\nexpeditions, and although Captain McClintock took some in 1859, I\r\nassure you that there will be some left for us.\"\r\n\r\n\"By-the-bye,\" said the doctor, \"these parts have been explored for\r\nthe last fifteen years, and since the day when the proof of the loss\r\nof Franklin was acquired, the Admiralty has always kept five or six\r\ncruisers in these seas. If I am not mistaken, Griffith Island, which\r\nI see there on the map, almost in the middle of the cross-roads, has\r\nbecome a general meeting-place for navigators.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is so, doctor; and Franklin's unfortunate expedition resulted\r\nin making known these distant countries to us.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is true, captain, for since 1845 expeditions have been very\r\nnumerous. It was not until 1848 that we began to be uneasy about the\r\ndisappearance of the _Erebus_ and the _Terror_, Franklin's two\r\nvessels. It was then that we saw the admiral's old friend, Dr.\r\nRichardson, at the age of seventy, go to Canada, and ascend Coppermine\r\nRiver as far as the Polar Sea; and James Ross, commanding the\r\n_Enterprise_ and _Investigation_, set out from Uppernawik in 1848\r\nand arrived at Cape York, where we now are. Every day he threw a tub\r\ncontaining papers into the sea, for the purpose of making known his\r\nwhereabouts. During the mists he caused the cannon to be fired, and\r\nhad sky-rockets sent up at night along with Bengal lights, and kept\r\nunder sail continually. He wintered in Port Leopold from 1848 to 1849,\r\nwhere he took possession of a great number of white foxes, and caused\r\nbrass collars, upon which was engraved the indication of the\r\nwhereabouts of ships and the store depots, to be riveted on their\r\nnecks. Afterwards they were dispersed in all directions; in the\r\nfollowing spring he began to search the coasts of North Somerset on\r\nsledges in the midst of dangers and privations from which almost all\r\nhis men fell ill or lame. He built up cairns in which he inclosed\r\nbrass cylinders with the necessary memoranda for rallying the lost\r\nexpedition. While he was away his lieutenant McClure explored the\r\nnorthern coasts of Barrow Strait, but without result. James Ross had\r\nunder his orders two officers who, later on, were destined to become\r\ncelebrities--McClure, who cleared the North-West passage, and\r\nMcClintock, who discovered the remains of Sir John Franklin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; they are now two good and brave English captains. You know the\r\nhistory of these seas well, doctor, and you will benefit us by telling\r\nus about it. There is always something to be gained by hearing about\r\nsuch daring attempts.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, to finish all I know about James Ross: he tried to reach\r\nMelville Island by a more westerly direction, but he nearly lost his\r\ntwo vessels, for he was caught by the ice and driven back into Baffin's\r\nSea.\"\r\n\r\n\"Driven back?\" repeated Hatteras, contracting his brows; \"forced\r\nback in spite of himself?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, and without having discovered anything,\" continued the doctor;\r\n\"and ever since that year, 1850, English vessels have never ceased\r\nto plough these seas, and a reward of twenty thousand pounds was\r\noffered to any one who might find the crews of the _Erebus_ and\r\n_Terror_. Captains Kellett and Moore had already, in 1848, attempted\r\nto get through Behring's Strait. In 1850 and 1851 Captain Austin\r\nwintered in Cornwallis Island; Captain Parry, on board the\r\n_Assistance_ and the _Resolute_, explored Wellington Channel; John\r\nRoss, the venerable hero of the magnetic pole, set out again with\r\nhis yacht, the _Felix_, in search of his friend; the brig _Prince\r\nAlbert_ went on a first cruise at the expense of Lady Franklin; and,\r\nlastly, two American ships, sent out by Grinnell with Captain Haven,\r\nwere drifted out of Wellington Channel and thrown back into Lancaster\r\nStrait. It was during this year that McClintock, who was then Austin's\r\nlieutenant, pushed on as far as Melville Island and Cape Dundas, the\r\nextreme points attained by Parry in 1819; it was then that he found\r\ntraces of Franklin's wintering on Beechey Island in 1845.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Hatteras, \"three of his sailors had been buried\r\nthere--three men more fortunate than the others!\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor nodded in approval of Hatteras's remark, and continued:\r\n\r\n\"During 1851 and 1852 the _Prince Albert_ went on a second voyage\r\nunder the French lieutenant, Bellot; he wintered at Batty Bay, in\r\nPrince Regent Strait, explored the south-west of Somerset, and\r\nreconnoitred the coast as far as Cape Walker. During that time the\r\n_Enterprise_ and the _Investigator_ returned to England and passed\r\nunder the command of Collinson and McClure for the purpose of\r\nrejoining Kellett and Moore in Behring's Straits; whilst Collinson\r\ncame back to winter at Hong-Kong, McClure made the best of his way\r\nonward, and after being obliged to winter three times--from 1850 to\r\n'51; from 1851 to '52; and from 1852 to '53--he discovered the\r\nNorth-West passage without learning anything of Franklin's fate.\r\nDuring 1852 and '53 a new expedition composed of three sailing vessels,\r\nthe _Resolute_, the _Assistance_, the _North Star_, and two steamers,\r\nthe _Pioneer_ and _Intrepid_, set sail under the command of Sir Edward\r\nBelcher, with Captain Kellett under him; Sir Edward visited\r\nWellington Channel, wintered in Northumberland Bay, and went over\r\nthe coast, whilst Kellett, pushing on to Bridport in Melville Island,\r\nexplored, without success, that part of the boreal land. It was at\r\nthis time that news was spread in England that two ships, abandoned\r\nin the midst of icebergs, had been descried near the coast of New\r\nScotland. Lady Franklin immediately had prepared the little screw\r\n_Isabelle_, and Captain Inglefield, after having steamed up Baffin's\r\nBay as far as Victoria Point on the eightieth parallel, came back\r\nto Beechey Island no more successful than his predecessors. At the\r\nbeginning of 1855, Grinnell, an American, fitted up a fresh expedition,\r\nand Captain Kane tried to penetrate to the Pole----\"\r\n\r\n\"But he didn't do it,\" cried Hatteras violently; \"and what he didn't\r\ndo we will, with God's help!\"\r\n\r\n\"I know, captain,\" answered the doctor, \"and I mention it because\r\nthis expedition is of necessity connected with the search for Franklin.\r\nBut it had no result. I was almost forgetting to tell you that the\r\nAdmiralty, considering Beechey Island as the general rendezvous of\r\nexpeditions, charged Captain Inglefield, who then commanded the\r\nsteamer _Phoenix_, to transport provisions there in 1853; Inglefield\r\nset out with Lieutenant Bellot, and lost the brave officer who for\r\nthe second time had devoted his services to England; we can have more\r\nprecise details upon this catastrophe, as our boatswain, Johnson,\r\nwas witness to the misfortune.\"\r\n\r\n\"Lieutenant Bellot was a brave Frenchman,\" said Hatteras, \"and his\r\nmemory is honoured in England.\"\r\n\r\n\"By that time,\" continued the doctor, \"Belcher's fleet began to come\r\nback little by little; not all of it, for Sir Edward had been obliged\r\nto abandon the _Assistance_ in 1854, as McClure had done with the\r\n_Investigator_ in 1853. In the meantime, Dr. Rae, in a letter dated\r\nthe 29th of July, 1854, and addressed from Repulse Bay, which he had\r\nsucceeded in reaching through America, sent word that the Esquimaux\r\nof King William's Land were in possession of different objects taken\r\nfrom the wrecks of the _Erebus_ and _Terror_; there was then not the\r\nleast doubt about the fate of the expedition; the _Phoenix_, the\r\n_North Star_, and Collinson's vessel then came back to England,\r\nleaving the Arctic Seas completely abandoned by English ships. But\r\nif the Government seemed to have lost all hope it was not so with\r\nLady Franklin, and with the remnants of her fortune she fitted out\r\nthe _Fox_, commanded by McClintock, who set sail in 1857, and wintered\r\nin the quarters where you made your apparition; he reached Beechey\r\nIsland on the 11th of August, 1858, wintered a second time in Bellot's\r\nStrait, began his search again in February, 1859, and on the 6th of\r\nMay found the document which cleared away all doubt about the fate\r\nof the _Erebus_ and the _Terror_, and returned to England at the end\r\nof the year. That is all that has happened for fifteen years in these\r\nfateful countries, and since the return of the _Fox_ not a single\r\nvessel has returned to attempt success in the midst of these dangerous\r\nseas.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" replied Hatteras, \"we will attempt it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\nTHE \"FORWARD\" DRIVEN BACK SOUTH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe weather cleared up towards evening, and land was clearly\r\ndistinguished between Cape Sepping and Cape Clarence, which runs east,\r\nthen south, and is joined to the coast on the west by a rather low\r\nneck of land. The sea at the entrance to Regent Strait was free from\r\nice, with the exception of an impenetrable ice-bank, a little further\r\nthan Port Leopold, which threatened to stop the _Forward_ in her\r\nnorth-westerly course. Hatteras was greatly vexed, but he did not\r\nshow it; he was obliged to have recourse to petards in order to force\r\nan entrance to Port Leopold; he reached it on Sunday, the 27th of\r\nMay; the brig was solidly anchored to the enormous icebergs, which\r\nwere as upright, hard, and solid as rocks.\r\n\r\nThe captain, followed by the doctor, Johnson, and his dog Dick,\r\nimmediately leaped upon the ice, and soon reached land. Dick leaped\r\nwith joy, for since he had recognised the captain he had become more\r\nsociable, keeping his grudge against certain men of the crew for whom\r\nhis master had no more friendship than he. The port was not then\r\nblocked up with ice that the east winds generally heaped up there;\r\nthe earth, intersected with peaks, offered at their summits graceful\r\nundulations of snow. The house and lantern erected by James Ross were\r\nstill in a tolerable state of preservation; but the provisions seemed\r\nto have been ransacked by foxes and bears, the recent traces of which\r\nwere easily distinguished. Men, too, had had something to do with\r\nthe devastation, for a few remains of Esquimaux huts remained upon\r\nthe shores of the Bay. The six graves inclosing the remains of the\r\nsix sailors of the _Enterprise_ and the _Investigator_ were\r\nrecognisable by a slight swelling of the ground; they had been\r\nrespected both by men and animals. In placing his foot for the first\r\ntime on boreal land, the doctor experienced much emotion. It is\r\nimpossible to imagine the feelings with which the heart is assailed\r\nat the sight of the remains of houses, tents, huts, and magazines\r\nthat Nature so marvellously preserves in those cold countries.\r\n\r\n\"There is that residence,\" he said to his companions, \"which James\r\nRoss himself called the Camp of Refuge; if Franklin's expedition had\r\nreached this spot, it would have been saved. There is the engine which\r\nwas abandoned here, and the stove at which the crew of the _Prince\r\nAlbert_ warmed themselves in 1851. Things have remained just as they\r\nwere, and any one would think that Captain Kennedy had only left\r\nyesterday. Here is the long boat which sheltered him and his for a\r\nfew days, for this Kennedy, separated from his ship, was in reality\r\nsaved by Lieutenant Bellot, who braved the October temperature in\r\norder to go to his assistance.\"\r\n\r\n\"I knew that brave and worthy officer,\" said Johnson.\r\n\r\nWhilst the doctor was examining with all an antiquarian's enthusiasm\r\nthe vestiges of previous winterings, Hatteras was occupied in piling\r\ntogether the various provisions and articles of fuel, which were only\r\nto be found in very small quantities. The following day was employed\r\nin transporting them on board. The doctor, without going too far from\r\nthe ship, surveyed the country, and took sketches of the most\r\nremarkable points of view. The temperature rose by degrees, and the\r\nheaped-up snow began to melt. The doctor made an almost complete\r\ncollection of northern birds, such as gulls, divers, eider-down ducks,\r\nwhich are very much like common ducks, with white breasts and backs,\r\nblue bellies, the top of the head blue, and the remainder of the\r\nplumage white, shaded with green; several of them had already their\r\nbreasts stripped of that beautiful down with which the male and female\r\nline their nests. The doctor also perceived large seals taking breath\r\non the surface of the ice, but could not shoot one. In his excursions\r\nhe discovered the high water mark, a stone upon which the following\r\nsigns are engraved:\r\n\r\n                                 (E. I.)\r\n                                  1849,\r\n\r\nand which indicate the passage of the _Enterprise_ and\r\n_Investigator_; he pushed forward as far as Cape Clarence to the spot\r\nwhere John and James Ross, in 1833, waited with so much impatience\r\nfor the breaking up of the ice. The land was strewn with skulls and\r\nbones of animals, and traces of Esquimaux habitations could be still\r\ndistinguished.\r\n\r\nThe doctor wanted to raise up a cairn on Port Leopold, and deposit\r\nin it a note indicating the passage of the _Forward_, and the aim\r\nof the expedition. But Hatteras would not hear of it; he did not want\r\nto leave traces behind of which a competitor might take advantage.\r\nIn spite of his good motives the doctor was forced to yield to the\r\ncaptain's will. Shandon blamed the captain's obstinacy, which\r\nprevented any ships following the trace of the _Forward_ in case of\r\naccident. Hatteras would not give way. His lading was finished on\r\nMonday night, and he attempted once more to gain the north by breaking\r\nopen the ice-bank; but after dangerous efforts he was forced to resign\r\nhimself, and to go down Regent's Channel again; he would not stop\r\nat Port Leopold, which, open to-day, might be closed again to-morrow\r\nby an unexpected displacement of ice-fields, a very frequent\r\nphenomenon in these seas, and which navigators ought particularly\r\nto take into consideration.\r\n\r\nIf Hatteras did not allow his uneasiness to be outwardly perceived,\r\nit did not prevent him feeling it inwardly. His desire was to push\r\nnorthward, whilst, on the contrary, he found himself constrained to\r\nput back southward. Where should he get to in that case? Should he\r\nbe obliged to put back to Victoria Harbour, in Boothia Gulf, where\r\nSir John Ross wintered in 1833? Would he find Bellot Strait open at\r\nthat epoch, and could he ascend Peel Strait by rounding North\r\nSomerset? Or, again, should he, like his predecessors, find himself\r\ncaptured during several winters, and be compelled to exhaust his\r\nstrength and provisions? These fears were fermenting in his brain;\r\nhe must decide one way or other. He heaved about, and struck out south.\r\nThe width of Prince Regent's Channel is about the same from Port\r\nLeopold to Adelaide Bay. The _Forward_, more favoured than the ships\r\nwhich had preceded her, and of which the greater number had required\r\nmore than a month to descend the channel, even in a more favourable\r\nseason, made her way rapidly amongst the icebergs; it is true that\r\nother ships, with the exception of the _Fox_, had no steam at their\r\ndisposal, and had to endure the caprices of an uncertain and often\r\nfoul wind.\r\n\r\nIn general the crew showed little wish to push on with the enterprising\r\nHatteras; the men were only too glad to perceive that the vessel was\r\ntaking a southerly direction. Hatteras would have liked to go on\r\nregardless of consequences.\r\n\r\nThe _Forward_ rushed along under the pressure of her engines, the\r\nsmoke from which twisted round the shining points of the icebergs;\r\nthe weather was constantly changing from dry cold to snowy fogs. The\r\nbrig, which drew little water, sailed along the west coast; Hatteras\r\ndid not wish to miss the entrance to Bellot Strait, as the only outlet\r\nto the Gulf of Boothia on the south was the strait, only partially\r\nknown to the _Fury_ and the _Hecla_; if he missed the Bellot Strait,\r\nhe might be shut up without possibility of egress.\r\n\r\nIn the evening the _Forward_ was in sight of Elwin Bay, known by its\r\nhigh perpendicular rocks; on the Tuesday morning Batty Bay was sighted,\r\nwhere the _Prince Albert_ anchored for its long wintering on the 10th\r\nof September, 1851. The doctor swept the whole coast with his\r\ntelescope. It was from this point that the expeditions radiated that\r\nestablished the geographical configuration of North Somerset. The\r\nweather was clear, and the profound ravines by which the bay is\r\nsurrounded could be clearly distinguished.\r\n\r\nThe doctor and Johnson were perhaps the only beings on board who took\r\nany interest in these deserted countries. Hatteras was always intent\r\nupon his maps, and said little; his taciturnity increased as the brig\r\ngot more and more south; he often mounted the poop, and there with\r\nfolded arms, and eyes lost in vacancy, he stood for hours. His orders,\r\nwhen he gave any, were curt and rough. Shandon kept a cold silence,\r\nand kept himself so much aloof by degrees that at last he had no\r\nrelations with Hatteras except those exacted by the service; James\r\nWall remained devoted to Shandon, and regulated his conduct\r\naccordingly. The remainder of the crew waited for something to turn\r\nup, ready to take any advantage in their own interest. There was no\r\nlonger that unity of thought and communion of ideas on board which\r\nare so necessary for the accomplishment of anything great, and this\r\nHatteras knew to his sorrow.\r\n\r\nDuring the day two whales were perceived rushing towards the south;\r\na white bear was also seen, and was shot at without any apparent\r\nsuccess. The captain knew the value of an hour under the circumstances,\r\nand would not allow the animal to be chased.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday morning the extremity of Regent's Channel was passed;\r\nthe angle on the west coast was followed by a deep curve in the land.\r\nBy consulting his map the doctor recognised the point of Somerset\r\nHouse, or Fury Point.\r\n\r\n\"There,\" said he to his habitual companion--\"there is the very spot\r\nwhere the first English ship, sent into these seas in 1815, was lost,\r\nduring the third of Parry's voyages to the Pole; the _Fury_ was so\r\ndamaged by the ice on her second wintering, that her crew were obliged\r\nto desert her and return to England on board her companion ship the\r\n_Hecla_.\"\r\n\r\n\"That shows the advantage of having a second ship,\" answered Johnson.\r\n\"It is a precaution that Polar navigators ought not to neglect, but\r\nCaptain Hatteras wasn't the sort of man to trouble himself with\r\nanother ship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you think he is imprudent, Johnson?\" asked the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"I? I think nothing, Mr. Clawbonny. Do you see those stakes over there\r\nwith some rotten tent-rags still hanging to them?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; that's where Parry disembarked his provisions from his ship,\r\nand, if I remember rightly, the roof of his tent was a topsail.\"\r\n\r\n\"Everything must be greatly changed since 1825!\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so much as any one might think. John Ross owed the health and\r\nsafety of his crew to that fragile habitation in 1829. When the _Prince\r\nAlbert_ sent an expedition there in 1851, it was still existing;\r\nCaptain Kennedy had it repaired, nine years ago now. It would be\r\ninteresting to visit it, but Hatteras isn't in the humour to stop!\"\r\n\r\n\"I daresay he is right, Mr. Clawbonny; if time is money in England,\r\nhere it is life, and a day's or even an hour's delay might make all\r\nthe difference.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the day of Thursday, the 1st of June, the _Forward_ cut across\r\nCreswell Bay; from Fury Point the coast rose towards the north in\r\nperpendicular rocks three hundred feet high; it began to get lower\r\ntowards the south; some snow summits looked like neatly-cut tables,\r\nwhilst others were shaped like pyramids, and had other strange forms.\r\n\r\nThe weather grew milder during that day, but was not so clear; land\r\nwas lost to sight, and the thermometer went up to thirty-two degrees;\r\nseafowl fluttered about, the flocks of wild ducks were seen flying\r\nnorth; the crew could divest themselves of some of their garments,\r\nand the influence of the Arctic summer began to be felt. Towards\r\nevening the _Forward_ doubled Cape Garry at a quarter of a mile from\r\nthe shore, where the soundings gave from ten to twelve fathoms; from\r\nthence she kept near the coast as far as Brentford Bay. It was under\r\nthis latitude that Bellot Strait was to be met with; a strait the\r\nexistence of which Sir John Ross did not even guess at during his\r\nexpedition in 1828; his maps indicated an uninterrupted coast-line,\r\nwhose irregularities he noted with the utmost care; the entrance to\r\nthe strait must therefore have been blocked up by ice at the time.\r\nIt was really discovered by Kennedy in April, 1852, and he gave it\r\nthe name of his lieutenant, Bellot, as \"a just tribute,\" he said,\r\n\"to the important services rendered to our expedition by the French\r\nofficer.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\nTHE MAGNETIC POLE\r\n\r\n\r\nHatteras felt his anxiety increase as he neared the strait; the fate\r\nof his voyage depended upon it; up till now he had done more than\r\nhis predecessors, the most fortunate of whom, McClintock, had taken\r\nfifteen months to reach this part of the Polar Seas; but it was little\r\nor nothing if he did not succeed in clearing Bellot Strait; he could\r\nnot retrace his steps, and would be blocked up till the following\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nHe trusted the care of examining the coast to no one but himself;\r\nhe mounted the crow's nest and passed several hours there during the\r\nmorning of Saturday. The crew perfectly understood the ship's\r\nposition; profound silence reigned on board; the engine slackened\r\nsteam, and the _Forward_ kept as near land as possible; the coast\r\nbristled with icebergs, which the warmest summers do not melt; an\r\nexperienced eye alone could distinguish an opening between them.\r\nHatteras compared his maps with the land. As the sun showed himself\r\nfor an instant towards noon, he caused Shandon and Wall to take a\r\npretty exact observation, which was shouted to him. All the crew\r\nsuffered the tortures of anxiety for half the day, but towards two\r\no'clock these words were shouted from the top of the mizenmast:\r\n\r\n\"Veer to the west, all steam on.\"\r\n\r\nThe brig instantly obeyed; her prow was directed towards the point\r\nindicated; the sea foamed under the screws, and the _Forward_, with\r\nall speed on, entered between two ice-streams. The road was found,\r\nHatteras descended upon deck, and the ice-master took his place.\r\n\r\n\"Well, captain,\" said the doctor, \"we are in the famous strait at\r\nlast.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered Hatteras, lowering his voice; \"but getting in isn't\r\neverything; we must get out too,\" and so saying he regained his cabin.\r\n\r\n\"He's right,\" said the doctor; \"we are here in a sort of mousetrap,\r\nwith scarcely enough space for working the brig, and if we are forced\r\nto winter in the strait!... Well, we shan't be the first that have\r\nhad to do it, and they got over it, and so shall we.\"\r\n\r\nThe doctor was not mistaken. It was in that very place, in a little\r\nsheltered harbour called Kennedy Harbour by McClintock himself, that\r\nthe _Fox_ wintered in 1858. The high granite chain and the steep cliffs\r\nof the two banks were clearly discernible.\r\n\r\nBellot Strait is seventeen miles long and a mile wide, and about six\r\nor seven fathoms deep. It lies between mountains whose height is\r\nestimated at 1,600 feet. It separates North Somerset from Boothia\r\nLand.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand that there is not much elbow-room for vessels\r\nin such a strait. The _Forward_ advanced slowly, but it did advance;\r\ntempests are frequent in the strait, and the brig did not escape them;\r\nby Hatteras's order all sails were furled; but, notwithstanding all\r\nprecautions, the brig was much knocked about; the waves dashed over\r\nher, and her smoke fled towards the east with astonishing rapidity;\r\nher course was not certain amongst the moving ice; the barometer fell;\r\nit was difficult to stop on deck, and most of the men stayed below\r\nto avoid useless suffering.\r\n\r\nHatteras, Johnson, and Shandon remained on the poop in spite of the\r\ngales of snow and rain; as usual the doctor had asked himself what\r\nwould be the most disagreeable thing he could do, and answered himself\r\nby going on deck at once; it was impossible to hear and difficult\r\nto see one another, so that he kept his reflections to himself.\r\nHatteras tried to see through the fog; he calculated that they would\r\nbe at the mouth of the strait at six o'clock, but when the time came\r\nall issue seemed closed up; he was obliged to wait and anchor the\r\nbrig to an iceberg; but he stopped under pressure all night.\r\n\r\nThe weather was frightful. The _Forward_ threatened to break her\r\nchains at every instant; it was feared that the iceberg to which they\r\nwere anchored, torn away at its base under the violent west wind,\r\nwould float away with the brig. The officers were constantly on the\r\nlook-out and under extreme apprehension; along with the snow there\r\nfell a perfect hail of ice torn off from the surface of the icebergs\r\nby the strength of the wind; it was like a shower of arrows bristling\r\nin the atmosphere. The temperature rose singularly during this\r\nterrible night; the thermometer marked fifty-seven degrees, and the\r\ndoctor, to his great astonishment, thought he saw flashes of lightning\r\nin the south, followed by the roar of far-off thunder that seemed\r\nto corroborate the testimony of the whaler Scoresby, who observed\r\na similar phenomenon above the sixty-fifth parallel. Captain Parry\r\nwas also witness to a similar meteorological wonder in 1821.\r\n\r\nTowards five o'clock in the morning the weather changed with\r\nastonishing rapidity; the temperature went down to freezing point,\r\nthe wind turned north, and became calmer. The western opening to the\r\nstrait was in sight, but entirely obstructed. Hatteras looked eagerly\r\nat the coast, asking himself if the passage really existed. However,\r\nthe brig got under way, and glided slowly amongst the ice-streams,\r\nwhilst the icebergs pressed noisily against her planks, the packs\r\nat that epoch were still from six to seven feet thick; they were\r\nobliged carefully to avoid their pressure, for if the brig had\r\nresisted them she would have run the risk of being lifted up and turned\r\nover on her side. At noon, for the first time, they could admire a\r\nmagnificent solar phenomenon, a halo with two parhelia; the doctor\r\nobserved it, and took its exact dimensions; the exterior bow was only\r\nvisible over an extent of thirty degrees on each side of its horizontal\r\ndiameter; the two images of the sun were remarkably clear; the colours\r\nof the luminous bows proceeded from inside to outside, and were red,\r\nyellow, green, and very light blue--in short, white light without\r\nany assignable exterior limit. The doctor remembered the ingenious\r\ntheory of Thomas Young about these meteors; this natural philosopher\r\nsupposed that certain clouds composed of prisms of ice are suspended\r\nin the atmosphere; the rays of the sun that fall on the prisms are\r\ndecomposed at angles of sixty and ninety degrees. Halos cannot,\r\ntherefore, exist in a calm atmosphere. The doctor thought this theory\r\nvery probable. Sailors accustomed to the boreal seas generally\r\nconsider this phenomenon as the precursor of abundant snow. If their\r\nobservation was just, the position of the _Forward_ became very\r\ndifficult. Hatteras, therefore, resolved to go on fast; during the\r\nremainder of the day and following night he did not take a minute's\r\nrest, sweeping the horizon with his telescope, taking advantage of\r\nthe least opening, and losing no occasion of getting out of the strait.\r\n\r\nBut in the morning he was obliged to stop before the insuperable\r\nice-bank. The doctor joined him on the poop. Hatteras went with him\r\napart where they could talk without fear of being overheard.\r\n\r\n\"We are in for it,\" began Hatteras; \"it is impossible to go any\r\nfurther.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is there no means of getting out?\" asked the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"None. All the powder in the _Forward_ would not make us gain half\r\na mile!\"\r\n\r\n\"What shall we do, then?\" said the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. This cursed year has been unfavourable from the\r\nbeginning.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" answered the doctor, \"if we must winter here, we must. One\r\nplace is as good as another.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" said Hatteras, lowering his voice, \"we must not winter here,\r\nespecially in the month of June. Wintering is full of physical and\r\nmoral danger. The crew would be unmanageable during a long inaction\r\nin the midst of real suffering. I thought I should be able to stop\r\nmuch nearer the Pole than this!\"\r\n\r\n\"Luck would have it so, or Baffin's Bay wouldn't have been closed.\"\r\n\r\n\"It was open enough for that American!\" cried Hatteras in a rage.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Hatteras,\" said the doctor, interrupting him on purpose,\r\n\"to-day is only the 5th of June; don't despair; a passage may suddenly\r\nopen up before us; you know that the ice has a tendency to break up\r\ninto several blocks, even in the calmest weather, as if a force of\r\nrepulsion acted upon the different parts of it; we may find the sea\r\nfree at any minute.\"\r\n\r\n\"If that minute comes we shall take advantage of it. It is quite\r\npossible that, once out of Bellot Strait, we shall be able to go north\r\nby Peel Strait or McClintock Channel, and then----\"\r\n\r\n\"Captain,\" said James Wall, who had come up while Hatteras was\r\nspeaking, \"the ice nearly carries off our rudder.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" answered Hatteras, \"we must risk it. We must be ready day\r\nand night. You must do all you can to protect it, Mr. Wall, but I\r\ncan't have it removed.\"\r\n\r\n\"But----\" added Wall.\r\n\r\n\"That is my business,\" said Hatteras severely, and Wall went back\r\nto his post.\r\n\r\n\"I would give five years of my life,\" said Hatteras, in a rage, \"to\r\nbe up north. I know no more dangerous passage. To add to the difficulty,\r\nthe compass is no guide at this distance from the magnetic pole: the\r\nneedle is constantly shifting its direction.\"\r\n\r\n\"I acknowledge,\" answered the doctor, \"that navigation is difficult,\r\nbut we knew what we had to expect when we began our enterprise, and\r\nwe ought not to be surprised at it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, doctor, my crew is no longer what it was; the officers are\r\nspoiling the men. I could make them do what I want by offering them\r\na pecuniary reward, but I am not seconded by my officers, but they\r\nshall pay dearly for it!\"\r\n\r\n\"You are exaggerating, Hatteras.\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I am not. Do you think the crew is sorry for the obstacles that\r\nI meet with? On the contrary, they hope they will make me abandon\r\nmy projects. They do not complain now, and they won't as long as the\r\n_Forward_ is making for the south. The fools! They think they are\r\ngetting nearer England! But once let me go north and you'll see how\r\nthey'll change! I swear, though, that no living being will make me\r\ndeviate from my line of conduct. Only let me find a passage, that's\r\nall!\"\r\n\r\nOne of the captain's wishes was fulfilled soon enough. There was a\r\nsudden change during the evening; under some influence of the wind,\r\nthe current, or the temperature, the ice-fields were separated; the\r\n_Forward_ went along boldly, breaking up the ice with her steel prow;\r\nshe sailed along all night, and the next morning about six cleared\r\nBellot Strait. But that was all; the northern passage was completely\r\nobstructed--to the great disgust of Hatteras. However, he had\r\nsufficient strength of character to hide his disappointment, and as\r\nif the only passage open was the one he preferred, he let the _Forward_\r\nsail down Franklin Strait again; not being able to get up Peel Strait,\r\nhe resolved to go round Prince of Wales's Land to get into McClintock\r\nChannel. But he felt he could not deceive Shandon and Wall as to the\r\nextent of his disappointment. The day of the 6th of June was\r\nuneventful; the sky was full of snow, and the prognostics of the halo\r\nwere fulfilled.\r\n\r\nDuring thirty-six hours the _Forward_ followed the windings of\r\nBoothia Land, unable to approach Prince of Wales's Land; the captain\r\ncounted upon getting supplies at Beechey Island; he arrived on the\r\nThursday at the extremity of Franklin Strait, where he again found\r\nthe road to the north blocked up. It was enough to make him despair;\r\nhe could not even retrace his steps; the icebergs pushed him onwards,\r\nand he saw the passages close up behind him as if there never had\r\nexisted open sea where he had passed an hour before. The _Forward_\r\nwas, therefore, not only prevented from going northwards, but could\r\nnot stop still an instant for fear of being caught, and she fled before\r\nthe ice as a ship flies before a storm.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, the 8th of June, they arrived near the shore of Boothia,\r\nat the entrance to James Ross Strait, which they were obliged to avoid,\r\nas its only issue is on the west, near the American coasts.\r\n\r\nObservations taken at noon from this point gave 70 degrees 5 minutes\r\n17 seconds latitude, and 96 degrees 46 minutes 45 seconds longitude;\r\nwhen the doctor heard that he consulted his map, and saw they were\r\nat the magnetic pole, at the very place where James Ross, the nephew\r\nof Sir John, had fixed it. The land was low near the coast, and at\r\nabout a mile's distance became slightly elevated, sixty feet only.\r\nThe _Forward's_ boiler wanted cleaning, and the captain caused the\r\nbrig to be anchored to an ice-field, and allowed the doctor and the\r\nboatswain to land. He himself cared for nothing but his pet project,\r\nand stayed in his cabin, consulting his map of the Pole.\r\n\r\nThe doctor and his companion easily succeeded in reaching land; the\r\ndoctor took a compass to make experiments with. He wished to try if\r\nJames Ross's conclusions hold good. He easily discovered the\r\nlimestone heap raised by Ross; he ran to it; an opening allowed him\r\nto see, in the interior, the tin case in which James Ross had placed\r\nthe official report of his discoveries. No living being seemed to\r\nhave visited this desolate coast for the last thirty years. In this\r\nspot a loadstone needle, suspended as delicately as possible,\r\nimmediately moved into an almost vertical position under the magnetic\r\ninfluence; if the centre of attraction was not immediately under the\r\nneedle, it could only be at a trifling distance. The doctor made the\r\nexperiment carefully, and found that the imperfect instruments of\r\nJames Ross had given his vertical needle an inclination of 89 degrees\r\n59 minutes, making the real magnetic point at a minute's distance\r\nfrom the spot, but that his own at a little distance gave him an\r\ninclination of 90 degrees.\r\n\r\n\"Here is the exact spot of the world's magnetic pole,\" said the doctor,\r\nrapping the earth.\r\n\r\n\"Then,\" said the boatswain, \"there's no loadstone mountain, after\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course not; that mountain was only a credulous hypothesis. As\r\nyou see, there isn't the least mountain capable of attracting ships,\r\nof attracting their iron anchor after anchor and nail after nail,\r\nand you see it respects your shoes as much as any other land on the\r\nglobe.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then how do you explain----\"\r\n\r\n\"Nothing is explained, Johnson; we don't know enough for that yet.\r\nBut it is certain, exact, mathematical, that the magnetic pole is\r\nin this very spot!\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Mr. Clawbonny! how happy the captain would be to say as much\r\nof the boreal pole!\"\r\n\r\n\"He will some day, Johnson, you will see.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope he will,\" answered the boatswain.\r\n\r\nHe and the doctor elevated a cairn on the exact spot where the\r\nexperiment had been made, and returned on board at five o'clock in\r\nthe evening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\nTHE FATE OF SIR JOHN FRANKLIN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Forward_ succeeded in cutting straight across James Ross Strait,\r\nbut not without difficulty; the crew were obliged to work the saws\r\nand use petards, and they were worn out with fatigue. Happily the\r\ntemperature was bearable, and thirty degrees higher than that\r\nexperienced by James Ross at the same epoch. The thermometer marked\r\nthirty-four degrees.\r\n\r\nOn Saturday they doubled Cape Felix at the northern extremity of King\r\nWilliam's Land, one of the middle-sized isles of the northern seas.\r\nThe crew there experienced a strong and painful sensation, and many\r\na sad look was turned towards the island as they sailed by the coast.\r\nThis island had been the theatre of the most terrible tragedy of modern\r\ntimes. Some miles to the west the _Erebus_ and the _Terror_ had been\r\nlost for ever. The sailors knew about the attempts made to find Admiral\r\nFranklin and the results, but they were ignorant of the affecting\r\ndetails of the catastrophe. While the doctor was following the\r\nprogress of the ship on his map, several of them, Bell, Bolton, and\r\nSimpson, approached and entered into conversation with him. Their\r\ncomrades, animated by curiosity, soon followed them; while the brig\r\nflew along with extreme rapidity, and the coast with its bays, capes,\r\nand promontories passed before their eyes like a gigantic panorama.\r\n\r\nHatteras was marching up and down the poop with quick steps. The doctor,\r\non the deck, looked round, and saw himself surrounded by almost the\r\nwhole crew. He saw how powerful a recital would be in such a situation,\r\nand he continued the conversation begun with Johnson as follows:--\r\n\r\n\"You know how Franklin began, my friends; he was a cabin-boy like\r\nCook and Nelson; after having employed his youth in great maritime\r\nexpeditions, he resolved in 1845 to launch out in search of the\r\nNorth-West passage; he commanded the _Erebus_ and the _Terror_, two\r\nvessels, already famous, that had just made an Antarctic campaign\r\nunder James Ross, in 1840. The _Erebus_, equipped by Franklin, carried\r\na crew of seventy men, officers and sailors, with Fitz-James as\r\ncaptain; Gore and Le Vesconte, lieutenants; Des Voeux, Sargent, and\r\nCouch, boatswains; and Stanley as surgeon. The _Terror_ had\r\nsixty-eight men, Captain Crozier; Lieutenants Little, Hodgson, and\r\nIrving; Horesby and Thomas were the boatswains, and Peddie the surgeon.\r\nIn the names on the map of the capes, straits, points, and channels,\r\nyou may read those of these unfortunate men, not one of whom was\r\ndestined ever again to see his native land. There were a hundred and\r\nthirty-eight men in all! We know that Franklin's last letters were\r\naddressed from Disko Island, and were dated July 12th, 1845. 'I hope,'\r\nhe said, 'to get under way to-night for Lancaster Strait.' What\r\nhappened after his departure from Disko Bay? The captains of two\r\nwhalers, the _Prince of Wales_ and the _Enterprise_, perceived the\r\ntwo ships in Melville Bay for the last time, and after that day nothing\r\nwas heard of them. However, we can follow Franklin in his westerly\r\ncourse: he passed through Lancaster and Barrow Straits, and arrived\r\nat Beechey Island, where he passed the winter of 1845 and '46.\"\r\n\r\n\"But how do you know all this?\" asked Bell, the carpenter.\r\n\r\n\"By three tombs which Austin discovered on that island in 1850. Three\r\nof Franklin's sailors were buried there, and by a document which was\r\nfound by Lieutenant Hobson, of the _Fox_, which bears the date of\r\nApril 25th, 1848, we know that after their wintering the _Erebus_\r\nand the _Terror_ went up Wellington Strait as far as the\r\nseventy-seventh parallel; but instead of continuing their route\r\nnorthwards, which was, probably, not practicable, they returned\r\nsouth.\"\r\n\r\n\"And that was their ruin!\" said a grave voice. \"Safety lay to the\r\nnorth.\"\r\n\r\nEvery one turned round. Hatteras, leaning on the rail of the poop,\r\nhad just uttered that terrible observation.\r\n\r\n\"There is not a doubt,\" continued the doctor, \"that Franklin's\r\nintention was to get back to the American coast; but tempests stopped\r\nhim, and on the 12th September, 1846, the two ships were seized by\r\nthe ice, at a few miles from here, to the north-west of Cape Felix;\r\nthey were dragged along N.N.W. to Victoria Point over there,\" said\r\nthe doctor, pointing to a part of the sea. \"Now,\" he continued, \"the\r\nships were not abandoned till the 22nd of April, 1848. What happened\r\nduring these nineteen months? What did the poor unfortunate men do?\r\nThey, doubtless, explored the surrounding land, attempting any\r\nchance of safety, for the admiral was an energetic man, and if he\r\ndid not succeed----\"\r\n\r\n\"Very likely his crew betrayed him,\" added Hatteras.\r\n\r\nThe sailors dared not raise their eyes; these words pricked their\r\nconscience.\r\n\r\n\"To end my tale, the fatal document informs us also that John Franklin\r\nsuccumbed to fatigue on the 11th of June, 1847. Honour to his memory!\"\r\nsaid the doctor, taking off his hat. His audience imitated him in\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n\"What became of the poor fellows for the next ten months after they\r\nhad lost their chief? They remained on board their vessels, and only\r\nresolved to abandon them in April, 1848; a hundred and five men out\r\nof a hundred and thirty-eight were still living; thirty-three were\r\ndead! Then Captain Crozier and Captain Fitz-James raised a cairn on\r\nVictory Point, and there deposited their last document. See, my\r\nfriends, we are passing the point now! You can still see the remains\r\nof the cairn placed on the extreme point, reached by John Ross in\r\n1831. There is Jane Franklin Cape. There is Franklin Point. There\r\nis Le Vesconte Point. There is Erebus Bay, where the boat made out\r\nof the _debris_ of one of the vessels was found on a sledge. Silver\r\nspoons, provisions in abundance, chocolate, tea, and religious books\r\nwere found there too. The hundred and five survivors, under Captain\r\nCrozier, started for Great Fish River. Where did they get to? Did\r\nthey succeed in reaching Hudson's Bay? Did any survive? What became\r\nof them after this last departure?\"\r\n\r\n\"I will tell you what became of them,\" said John Hatteras in a firm\r\nvoice. \"Yes, they did try to reach Hudson's Bay, and they split up\r\ninto several parties! Yes, they did make for the south! A letter from\r\nDr. Rae in 1854 contained the information that in 1850 the Esquimaux\r\nhad met on King William's Land a detachment of forty men travelling\r\non the ice, and dragging a boat, thin, emaciated, worn out by fatigue\r\nand suffering! Later on they discovered thirty corpses on the\r\ncontinent and five on a neighbouring island, some half-buried, some\r\nleft without burial, some under a boat turned upside down, others\r\nunder the remains of a tent; here an officer with his telescope on\r\nhis shoulder and a loaded gun at his side, further on a boiler with\r\nthe remnants of a horrible meal! When the Admiralty received these\r\ntidings it begged the Hudson's Bay Company to send its most\r\nexperienced agents to the scene. They descended Back River to its\r\nmouth. They visited the islands of Montreal, Maconochie, and Ogle\r\nPoint. But they discovered nothing. All the poor wretches had died\r\nfrom misery, suffering, and hunger, whilst trying to prolong their\r\nexistence by the dreadful resource of cannibalism. That is what became\r\nof them on the southern route. Well! Do you still wish to march in\r\ntheir footsteps?\"\r\n\r\nHis trembling voice, his passionate gestures and beaming face,\r\nproduced an indescribable effect. The crew, excited by its emotion\r\nbefore this fatal land, cried out with one voice: \"To the north! To\r\nthe north!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, to the north! Safety and glory lie to the north. Heaven is for\r\nus! The wind is changing; the pass is free!\"\r\n\r\nSo saying, Hatteras gave orders to turn the vessel; the sailors went\r\nto work with alacrity; the ice streams got clear little by little;\r\nthe _Forward_, with all steam on, made for McClintock Channel.\r\nHatteras was right when he counted upon a more open sea; he followed\r\nup the supposed route taken by Franklin, sailing along the western\r\ncoast of Prince of Wales's Land, then pretty well known, whilst the\r\nopposite shore is still unknown. It was evident that the breaking\r\nup of the ice had taken place in the eastern locks, for this strait\r\nappeared entirely free; the _Forward_ made up for lost time; she fled\r\nalong so quickly that she passed Osborne Bay on the 14th of June,\r\nand the extreme points attained by the expeditions of 1851. Icebergs\r\nwere still numerous, but the sea did not threaten to quit the keel\r\nof the _Forward_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\nTHE NORTHERN ROUTE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe crew seemed to have returned to its habits of discipline and\r\nobedience. There was little fatiguing work to do, and they had a good\r\ndeal of leisure. The temperature kept above freezing point, and it\r\nseemed as if the thaw had removed the great obstacles to navigation.\r\n\r\nDick, now sociable and familiar, had made great friends with Dr.\r\nClawbonny. But as in most friendships one friend has to give way to\r\nthe other, it must be acknowledged it was not the dog. Dick did what\r\nhe liked with the doctor, who obeyed him as if he were the dog. He\r\nwas amiable with most of the sailors and officers on board, only by\r\ninstinct, doubtless, he shunned Shandon's society; he also kept up\r\na grudge against Pen and Foker; he vented his hatred of them by\r\ngrowling at their approach. But they dare not now attack the captain's\r\ndog--his \"familiar,\" as Clifton called him. On the whole the crew\r\nhad plucked up courage again and worked well.\r\n\r\n\"It seems to me,\" said James Wall one day to Richard Shandon, \"that\r\nour men took the captain's speech seriously; they no longer seem to\r\nbe doubtful of success.\"\r\n\r\n\"The more fools they!\" answered Shandon. \"If they reflected, if they\r\nexamined the situation, they would see that we are going out of one\r\nimprudence into another.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" continued Wall, \"the sea is open now, and we are getting back\r\ninto well-known tracks; aren't you exaggerating a bit, Shandon?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, I am not exaggerating; the dislike I feel to Hatteras is not\r\nblinding me. Have you seen the coal-holes lately?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" answered Wall.\r\n\r\n\"Well, then, go and examine them: you will see how much there's left.\r\nHe ought to have navigated under sail, and have kept the engine for\r\ncurrents and contrary winds; he ought only to have used his coal where\r\nhe was obliged; who can tell where we shall be kept, and for how many\r\nyears? But Hatteras only thinks about getting north. Whether the wind\r\nis contrary or not, he goes along at full steam, and if things go\r\non as they are doing now, we shall soon be in a pretty pickle.\"\r\n\r\n\"If what you say is true, it is very serious.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it is, because of the wintering. What shall we do without coal\r\nin a country where even the thermometer freezes?\"\r\n\r\n\"But, if I am not mistaken, the captain counts upon renewing his stock\r\nof coal at Beechey Island. It appears there is a large provision\r\nthere.\"\r\n\r\n\"And suppose we can't reach Beechey Island, what will become of us\r\nthen?\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right, Shandon; Hatteras seems to me very imprudent; but\r\nwhy don't you expostulate with him on the subject?\"\r\n\r\n\"No,\" said Shandon, with ill-concealed bitterness, \"I won't say a\r\nword. It is nothing to do with me now. I shall wait to see what turns\r\nup; I shall obey orders, and not give my opinion where it isn't\r\nwanted.\"\r\n\r\n\"Allow me to tell you that you are in the wrong, Shandon; you have\r\nas much interest in setting yourself against the captain's imprudence\r\nas we have.\"\r\n\r\n\"He wouldn't listen to me if I were to speak; do you think he would?\"\r\n\r\nWall dared not answer in the affirmative, and he added--\r\n\r\n\"But perhaps he would listen to the crew.\"\r\n\r\n\"The crew!\" answered Shandon, shrugging his shoulders; \"you don't\r\nknow the crew. The men know they are nearing the 72nd parallel, and\r\nthat they will earn a thousand pounds for every degree above that.\"\r\n\r\n\"The captain knew what he was doing when he offered them that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course he did, and for the present he can do what he likes with\r\nthem.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean that while they have nothing to do, and there is an open sea,\r\nthey will go on right enough; but wait till difficulty and danger\r\ncome, and you will see how much they'll think about the money!\"\r\n\r\n\"Then you don't think Hatteras will succeed?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, he will not; to succeed in such an enterprise there must be a\r\ngood understanding between him and his officers, and that does not\r\nexist. Hatteras is a madman; all his past career proves it. Well,\r\nwe shall see; perhaps circumstances will force them to give the\r\ncommand to a less adventurous captain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Still,\" said Wall, shaking his head, \"he will always have on his\r\nside----\"\r\n\r\n\"Dr. Clawbonny, a man who only cares for science, and Johnson, a sailor\r\nwho only cares to obey, and perhaps two more men like Bell, the\r\ncarpenter; four at the most, and we are eighteen on board! No, Wall,\r\nHatteras has not got the confidence of his men, and he knows it, so\r\nhe bribes them; he profited cleverly by the Franklin affair, but that\r\nwon't last, I tell you, and if he doesn't reach Beechey Island he's\r\na lost man!\"\r\n\r\n\"Suppose the crew should take it into its head----\"\r\n\r\n\"Don't tell the crew what I think,\" answered Shandon quickly; \"the\r\nmen will soon see for themselves. Besides, just now we must go north.\r\nWho knows if Hatteras won't find that way will bring us back sooner?\r\nAt the end of McClintock Channel lies Melville Bay, and from thence\r\ngo the straits that lead to Baffin's Bay. Hatteras must take care!\r\nThe way to the east is easier than the road to the north!\"\r\n\r\nHatteras was not mistaken in his opinion that Shandon would betray\r\nhim if he could. Besides, Shandon was right in attributing the\r\ncontentment of the men to the hope of gain. Clifton had counted exactly\r\nhow much each man would have. Without reckoning the captain and the\r\ndoctor, who would not expect a share in the bounty-money, there\r\nremained sixteen men to divide it amongst. If ever they succeeded\r\nin reaching the Pole, each man would have 1,125 pounds--that is to\r\nsay, a fortune. It would cost the captain 18,000 pounds, but he could\r\nafford it. The thoughts of the money inflamed the minds of the crew,\r\nand they were now as anxious to go north as before they had been eager\r\nto turn south. The _Forward_ during the day of June 16th passed Cape\r\nAworth. Mount Rawlinson raised its white peaks towards the sky; the\r\nsnow and fog made it appear colossal, as they exaggerated its\r\ndistance; the temperature still kept some degrees above freezing\r\npoint; improvised cascades and cataracts showed themselves on the\r\nsides of the mountains, and avalanches roared down with the noise\r\nof artillery discharges. The glaciers, spread out in long white sheets,\r\nprojected an immense reverberation into space. Boreal nature, in its\r\nstruggle with the frost, presented a splendid spectacle. The brig\r\nwent very near the coast; on some sheltered rocks rare heaths were\r\nto be seen, the pink flowers lifting their heads timidly out of the\r\nsnows, and some meagre lichens of a reddish colour and the shoots\r\nof a dwarf willow.\r\n\r\nAt last, on the 19th of June, at the famous seventy-third parallel,\r\nthey doubled Cape Minto, which forms one of the extremities of Ommaney\r\nBay; the brig entered Melville Bay, surnamed by Bolton Money Bay;\r\nthe merry sailors joked about the name, and made Dr. Clawbonny laugh\r\nheartily. Notwithstanding a strong breeze from the northeast, the\r\n_Forward_ made considerable progress, and on the 23rd of June she\r\npassed the 74th degree of latitude. She was in the midst of Melville\r\nBay, one of the most considerable seas in these regions. This sea\r\nwas crossed for the first time by Captain Parry in his great expedition\r\nof 1819, and it was then that his crew earned the prize of 5,000 pounds\r\npromised by Act of Parliament. Clifton remarked that there were two\r\ndegrees from the 72nd to the 74th; that already placed 125 pounds\r\nto his credit. But they told him that a fortune was not worth much\r\nthere, and that it was of no use being rich if he could not drink\r\nhis riches, and he had better wait till he could roll under a Liverpool\r\ntable before he rejoiced and rubbed his hands.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\nA WHALE IN SIGHT\r\n\r\n\r\nMelville Bay, though easily navigable, was not free from ice;\r\nice-fields lay as far as the utmost limits of the horizon; a few\r\nicebergs appeared here and there, but they were immovable, as if\r\nanchored in the midst of the frozen fields. The _Forward_, with all\r\nsteam on, followed the wide passes where it was easy to work her.\r\nThe wind changed frequently from one point of the compass to another.\r\nThe variability of the wind in the Arctic Seas is a remarkable fact;\r\nsometimes a dead calm is followed in a few minutes by a violent tempest,\r\nas the _Forward_ found to her cost on the 23rd of June in the midst\r\nof the immense bay. The more constant winds blow from off the ice-bank\r\non to the open sea, and are intensely cold. On that day the thermometer\r\nfell several degrees; the wind veered round to the south, and violent\r\ngusts, sweeping over the ice-fields, brought a thick snow along with\r\nthem. Hatteras immediately caused the sails that helped the screw\r\nto be furled, but not quickly enough to prevent his little foresail\r\nbeing carried away in the twinkling of an eye. Hatteras worked his\r\nship with the greatest composure, and did not leave the deck during\r\nthe tempest; he was obliged to fly before the weather and to turn\r\nwestward. The wind raised up enormous waves, in the midst of which\r\nblocks of ice balanced themselves; these blocks were of all sizes\r\nand shapes, and had been struck off the surrounding ice-fields; the\r\nbrig was tossed about like a child's plaything, and morsels of the\r\npacks were thrown over her hull; at one instant she was lying\r\nperpendicularly along the side of a liquid mountain; her steel prow\r\nconcentrated the light, and shone like a melting metal bar; at another\r\nshe was down an abyss, plunging her head into whirlwinds of snow,\r\nwhilst her screws, out of the water, turned in space with a sinister\r\nnoise, striking the air with their paddles. Rain mixed with the snow\r\nand fell in torrents.\r\n\r\nThe doctor could not miss such an occasion of getting wet to the skin;\r\nhe remained on deck, a prey to that emotional admiration which a\r\nscientific man must necessarily feel during such a spectacle. His\r\nnearest neighbour could not have heard him speak, so he said nothing\r\nand watched; but whilst watching he was witness to an odd phenomenon,\r\npeculiar to hyperborean regions. The tempest was confined to a\r\nrestricted area, and only extended for about three or four miles;\r\nthe wind that passes over ice-fields loses much of its strength and\r\ncannot carry its violence far out; the doctor perceived from time\r\nto time, through an opening in the tempest, a calm sky and a quiet\r\nsea beyond some ice-fields. The _Forward_ would therefore only have\r\nto take advantage of some channels left by the ice to find a peaceful\r\nnavigation again, but she ran the risk of being thrown on to one of\r\nthe moving banks which followed the movement of the swell. However,\r\nin a few hours Hatteras succeeded in getting his ship into a calm\r\nsea, whilst the violence of the hurricane spent itself at a few cables'\r\nlength from the _Forward_. Melville Bay no longer presented the same\r\naspect; under the influence of the winds and the waves a great number\r\nof icebergs, detached from the coast, floated northward, running\r\nagainst one another in every direction. There were several hundreds\r\nof them, but the bay is very wide, and the brig easily avoided them.\r\nThe spectacle of these floating masses was magnificent; they seemed\r\nto be having a grand race for it on the open sea. The doctor was getting\r\nquite excited with watching them, when the harpooner, Simpson, came\r\nup and made him look at the changing tints in the sea; they varied\r\nfrom a deep blue to olive green; long stripes stretched north and\r\nsouth in such decided lines that the eye could follow each shade out\r\nof sight. Sometimes a transparent sheet of water would follow a\r\nperfectly opaque sheet.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mr. Clawbonny, what do you think of that?\" said Simpson.\r\n\r\n\"I am of the same opinion as the whaler Scoresby on the nature of\r\nthe different coloured waters; blue water has no animalculae, and\r\ngreen water is full of them. Scoresby has made several experiments\r\non this subject, and I think he is right.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, sir, I know something else about the colours in the sea, and\r\nif I were a whaler I should be precious glad to see them.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I don't see any whales,\" answered the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"You won't be long before you do, though, I can tell you. A whaler\r\nis lucky when he meets with those green stripes under this latitude.\"\r\n\r\n\"Why?\" asked the doctor, who always liked to get information from\r\nanybody who understood what they were talking about.\r\n\r\n\"Because whales are always found in great quantities in green water.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's the reason of that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Because they find plenty of food in them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are you sure of that?\"\r\n\r\n\"I've seen it a hundred times, at least, in Baffin Sea; why shouldn't\r\nit be the same in Melville Bay? Besides, look there, Mr. Clawbonny,\"\r\nadded Simpson, leaning over the barricading.\r\n\r\n\"Why any one would think it was the wake of a ship!\"\r\n\r\n\"It is an oily substance that the whale leaves behind. The animal\r\ncan't be far off!\"\r\n\r\nThe atmosphere was impregnated with a strong oily odour, and the\r\ndoctor attentively watched the surface of the water. The prediction\r\nof the harpooner was soon accomplished. Foker called out from the\r\nmasthead--\r\n\r\n\"A whale alee!\"\r\n\r\nAll looks turned to the direction indicated. A small spout was\r\nperceived coming up out of the sea about a mile from the brig.\r\n\r\n\"There she spouts!\" cried Simpson, who knew what that meant.\r\n\r\n\"She has disappeared!\" answered the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we could find her again easily enough if necessary!\" said Simpson,\r\nwith an accent of regret. To his great astonishment, and although\r\nno one dared ask for it, Hatteras gave orders to man the whaler.\r\nJohnson went aft to the stern, while Simpson, harpoon in hand, stood\r\nin the bow. They could not prevent the doctor joining the expedition.\r\nThe sea was pretty calm. The whaler soon got off, and in ten minutes\r\nwas a mile from the brig. The whale had taken in another provision\r\nof air, and had plunged again; but she soon returned to the surface\r\nand spouted out that mixture of gas and mucus that escapes from her\r\nair-holes.\r\n\r\n\"There! There!\" said Simpson, pointing to a spot about eight hundred\r\nyards from the boat. It was soon alongside the animal, and as they\r\nhad seen her from the brig too, she came nearer, keeping little steam\r\non. The enormous cetacean disappeared and reappeared as the waves\r\nrose and fell, showing its black back like a rock in open sea. Whales\r\ndo not swim quickly unless they are pursued, and this one only rocked\r\nitself in the waves. The boat silently approached along the green\r\nwater; its opacity prevented the animal seeing the enemy. It is always\r\nan agitating spectacle when a fragile boat attacks one of these\r\nmonsters; this one was about 130 feet long, and it is not rare, between\r\nthe 72nd and the 80th degree, to meet with whales more than 180 feet\r\nlong. Ancient writers have described animals more than 700 feet long,\r\nbut they drew upon their imagination for their facts. The boat soon\r\nneared the whale; on a sign from Simpson the men rested on their oars,\r\nand brandishing his harpoon, the experienced sailor threw it with\r\nall his strength; it went deep into the thick covering of fat. The\r\nwounded whale struck the sea with its tail and plunged. The four oars\r\nwere immediately raised perpendicularly; the cord fastened to the\r\nharpoon, and attached to the bow, rolled rapidly out and dragged the\r\nboat along, steered cleverly by Johnson.\r\n\r\nThe whale got away from the brig and made for the moving icebergs;\r\nshe kept on for more than half-an-hour; they were obliged to wet the\r\ncord fastened to the harpoon to prevent it catching fire by rubbing\r\nagainst the boat. When the whale seemed to be going along a little\r\nmore slowly, the cord was pulled in little by little and rolled up;\r\nthe whale soon reappeared on the surface of the sea, which she beat\r\nwith her formidable tail: veritable waterspouts fell in a violent\r\nrain on to the boat. It was getting nearer. Simpson had seized a long\r\nlance, and was preparing to give close battle to the animal, when\r\nall at once the whale glided into a pass between two mountainous\r\nicebergs. The pursuit then became really dangerous.\r\n\r\n\"The devil!\" said Johnson.\r\n\r\n\"Go ahead,\" cried Simpson; \"we've got her!\"\r\n\r\n\"But we can't follow her into the icebergs!\" said Johnson, steering\r\nsteadily.\r\n\r\n\"Yes we can!\" cried Simpson.\r\n\r\n\"No, no!\" cried some of the sailors.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, yes!\" said others.\r\n\r\nDuring the discussion the whale had got between two floating mountains\r\nwhich the swell was bringing close together. The boat was being\r\ndragged into this dangerous part when Johnson rushed to the fore,\r\nan axe in his hand, and cut the cord. He was just in time; the two\r\nmountains came together with a tremendous crash, crushing the\r\nunfortunate animal.\r\n\r\n\"The whale's lost!\" cried Simpson.\r\n\r\n\"But we are saved!\" answered Johnson.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said the doctor, who had not moved, \"that was worth seeing!\"\r\n\r\nThe crushing force of these ice-mountains is enormous. The whale was\r\nvictim to an accident that often happens in these seas. Scoresby\r\nrelates that in the course of a single summer thirty whales perished\r\nin the same way in Baffin's Sea; he saw a three-master flattened in\r\na minute between two immense walls of ice. Other vessels were split\r\nthrough, as if with a lance, by pointed icicles a hundred feet long,\r\nmeeting through the planks. A few minutes afterwards the boat hailed\r\nthe brig, and was soon in its accustomed place on deck.\r\n\r\n\"It is a lesson for those who are imprudent enough to adventure into\r\nthe channels amongst the ice!\" said Shandon in a loud voice.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\nBEECHEY ISLAND\r\n\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of June the _Forward_ arrived in sight of Cape Dundas\r\nat the north-western extremity of Prince of Wales's Land. There the\r\ndifficulty of navigating amongst the ice grew greater. The sea is\r\nnarrower there, and the line made by Crozier, Young, Day, Lowther,\r\nand Garret Islands, like a chain of forts before a roadstead, forced\r\nthe ice-streams to accumulate in this strait. The brig took from the\r\n25th to the 30th of June to make as much way as she would have done\r\nin one day under any other circumstances; she stopped, retraced her\r\nsteps, waiting for a favourable occasion so as not to miss Beechey\r\nIsland, using a great deal of coal, as the fires were only moderated\r\nwhen she had to halt, but were never put out, so that she might be\r\nunder pressure day and night. Hatteras knew the extent of his coal\r\nprovision as well as Shandon, but as he was certain of getting his\r\nprovision renewed at Beechey Island he would not lose a minute for\r\nthe sake of economy; he had been much delayed by his forced march\r\nsouthward, and although he had taken the precaution of leaving England\r\nbefore the month of April, he did not find himself more advanced than\r\npreceding expeditions had been at the same epoch. On the 30th they\r\nsighted Cape Walker at the north-eastern extremity of Prince of\r\nWales's Land; it was the extreme point that Kennedy and Bellot\r\nperceived on the 3rd of May, 1852, after an excursion across the whole\r\nof North Somerset. Before that, in 1851, Captain Ommaney, of the\r\nAustin expedition, had the good luck to revictual his detachments\r\nthere. This cape is very high, and remarkable for its reddish-brown\r\ncolour; from there, when the weather is clear, the view stretches\r\nas far as the entrance to Wellington Channel. Towards evening they\r\nsaw Cape Bellot, separated from Cape Walker by McLeon Bay. Cape Bellot\r\nwas so named in the presence of the young French officer, for whom\r\nthe English expedition gave three cheers. At this spot the coast is\r\nmade of yellowish limestone, presenting a very rugged outline; it\r\nis defended by enormous icebergs which the north winds pile up there\r\nin a most imposing way. It was soon lost to sight by the _Forward_\r\nas she opened a passage amongst the ice to get to Beechey Island\r\nthrough Barrow Strait. Hatteras resolved to go straight on, and, so\r\nas not to be drifted further than the island, scarcely quitted his\r\npost during the following days; he often went to the masthead to look\r\nout for the most advantageous channels. All that pluck, skill, and\r\ngenius could do he did while they were crossing the strait. Fortune\r\ndid not favour him, for the sea is generally more open at this epoch.\r\nBut at last, by dint of sparing neither his steam, his crew, nor\r\nhimself, he attained his end.\r\n\r\nOn the 3rd of July, at 11 o'clock in the morning, the ice-master\r\nsignalled land to the north. After taking an observation Hatteras\r\nrecognised Beechey Island, that general meeting-place of Arctic\r\nnavigators. Almost all ships that adventure in these seas stop there.\r\nFranklin wintered there for the first time before getting into\r\nWellington Strait, and Creswell, with Lieutenant McClure, after\r\nhaving cleared 170 miles on the ice, rejoined the _Phoenix_ and\r\nreturned to England. The last ship which anchored at Beechey Island\r\nbefore the _Forward_ was the _Fox_; McClintock revictualled there\r\nthe 11th of August, 1858, and repaired the habitations and magazines;\r\nonly two years had elapsed since then, and Hatteras knew all these\r\ndetails. The boatswain's heart beat with emotion at the sight of this\r\nisland; when he had visited it he was quartermaster on board the\r\n_Phoenix_; Hatteras questioned him about the coast line, the\r\nfacilities for anchoring, how far they could go inland, &c.; the\r\nweather was magnificent, and the temperature kept at 57 degrees.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Johnson,\" said the captain, \"do you know where you are?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir, that is Beechey Island; only you must let us get further\r\nnorth--the coast is more easy of access.\"\r\n\r\n\"But where are the habitations and the magazines?\" said Hatteras.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, you can't see them till you land; they are sheltered behind those\r\nlittle hills you see yonder.\"\r\n\r\n\"And is that where you transported a considerable quantity of\r\nprovisions?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir; the Admiralty sent us here in 1853, under the command of\r\nCaptain Inglefield, with the steamer _Phoenix_ and a transport ship,\r\nthe _Breadalbane_, loaded with provisions; we brought enough with\r\nus to revictual a whole expedition.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the commander of the _Fox_ took a lot of them in 1858,\" said\r\nHatteras.\r\n\r\n\"That doesn't matter, sir; there'll be plenty left for you; the cold\r\npreserves them wonderfully, and we shall find them as fresh and in\r\nas good a state of preservation as the first day.\"\r\n\r\n\"What I want is coal,\" said Hatteras; \"I have enough provisions for\r\nseveral years.\"\r\n\r\n\"We left more than a thousand tons there, so you can make your mind\r\neasy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are we getting near?\" said Hatteras, who, telescope in hand, was\r\nwatching the coast.\r\n\r\n\"You see that point?\" continued Johnson. \"When we have doubled it\r\nwe shall be very near where we drop anchor. It was from that place\r\nthat we started for England with Lieutenant Creswell and the twelve\r\ninvalids from the _Investigator_. We were fortunate enough to bring\r\nback McClure's lieutenant, but the officer Bellot, who accompanied\r\nus on board the _Phoenix_, never saw his country again! It is a painful\r\nthing to think about. But, captain, I think we ought to drop anchor\r\nhere.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" answered Hatteras, and he gave his orders in consequence.\r\nThe _Forward_ was in a little bay naturally sheltered on the north,\r\neast, and south, and at about a cable's length from the coast.\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Wall,\" said Hatteras, \"have the long boat got ready to transport\r\nthe coal on board. I shall land in the pirogue with the doctor and\r\nthe boatswain. Will you accompany us, Mr. Shandon?\"\r\n\r\n\"As you please,\" answered Shandon.\r\n\r\nA few minutes later the doctor, armed as a sportsman and a _savant_,\r\ntook his place in the pirogue along with his companions; in ten minutes\r\nthey landed on a low and rocky coast.\r\n\r\n\"Lead the way, Johnson,\" said Hatteras. \"You know it, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly, sir; only there's a monument here that I did not expect\r\nto find!\"\r\n\r\n\"That!\" cried the doctor; \"I know what it is; let us go up to it;\r\nthe stone itself will tell us.\"\r\n\r\nThe four men advanced, and the doctor said, after taking off his hat--\r\n\r\n\"This, my friends, is a monument in memory of Franklin and his\r\ncompanions.\"\r\n\r\nLady Franklin had, in 1855, confided a black marble tablet to Doctor\r\nKane, and in 1858 she gave a second to McClintock to be raised on\r\nBeechey Island. McClintock accomplished this duty religiously, and\r\nplaced the stone near a funeral monument erected to the memory of\r\nBellot by Sir John Barrow.\r\n\r\nThe tablet bore the following inscription:\r\n\r\n\r\n                          \"TO THE MEMORY OF\r\n                    FRANKLIN, CROZIER, FITZ-JAMES,\r\n                    AND ALL THEIR VALIANT BRETHREN\r\n                   OFFICERS AND FAITHFUL COMPANIONS\r\nwho suffered for the cause of science and for their country's glory.\r\n\r\n\"This stone is erected near the place where they passed their first\r\nArctic winter, and from whence they departed to conquer obstacles\r\nor to die.\r\n\r\n\"It perpetuates the regret of their countrymen and friends who admire\r\nthem, and the anguish, conquered by Faith, of her who lost in the\r\nchief of the expedition the most devoted and most affectionate of\r\nhusbands.\r\n\r\n\"It is thus that He led them to the supreme haven where all men take\r\ntheir rest.\r\n\r\n                               \"1855.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nThis stone, on a forlorn coast of these far-off regions, appealed\r\nmournfully to the heart; the doctor, in presence of these touching\r\nregrets, felt his eyes fill with tears. At the very same place which\r\nFranklin and his companions passed full of energy and hope, there\r\nonly remained a block of marble in remembrance! And notwithstanding\r\nthis sombre warning of destiny, the _Forward_ was going to follow\r\nin the track of the _Erebus_ and the _Terror_. Hatteras was the first\r\nto rouse himself from the perilous contemplation, and quickly climbed\r\na rather steep hill, almost entirely bare of snow.\r\n\r\n\"Captain,\" said Johnson, following him, \"we shall see the magazines\r\nfrom here.\"\r\n\r\nShandon and the doctor joined them on the summit. But from there the\r\neye contemplated the vast plains, on which there remained no vestige\r\nof a habitation.\r\n\r\n\"That is singular!\" cried the boatswain.\r\n\r\n\"Well, and where are the magazines?\" said Hatteras quickly.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know--I don't see----\" stammered Johnson.\r\n\r\n\"You have mistaken the way,\" said the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"It seemed to me that this was the very place,\" continued Johnson.\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Hatteras, impatiently \"where are we to go now?\"\r\n\r\n\"We had better go down, for I may be mistaken. I may have forgotten\r\nthe exact locality in seven years!\"\r\n\r\n\"Especially when the country is so uniformly monotonous!\" added the\r\ndoctor.\r\n\r\n\"And yet----\" murmured Johnson.\r\n\r\nShandon had not spoken a word. After walking for a few minutes, Johnson\r\nstopped.\r\n\r\n\"But no,\" he cried, \"I am not mistaken!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well?\" said Hatteras, looking round him.\r\n\r\n\"Do you see that swell of the ground?\" asked the boatswain, pointing\r\nto a sort of mound with three distinct swells on it.\r\n\r\n\"What do you conclude from that?\" asked the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"Those are the three graves of Franklin's sailors. I am sure now that\r\nI am not mistaken; the habitations ought to be about a hundred feet\r\nfrom here, and if they are not, they----\"\r\n\r\nHe dared not finish his sentence; Hatteras had rushed forward, a prey\r\nto violent despair. There, where the wished-for stores on which he\r\nhad counted ought to have been, there ruin, pillage and destruction\r\nhad been before him. Who had done it? Animals would only have attacked\r\nthe provisions, and there did not remain a single rag from the tent,\r\na piece of wood or iron, and, more terrible still, not a fragment\r\nof coal! It was evident that the Esquimaux had learnt the value of\r\nthese objects from their frequent relations with Europeans; since\r\nthe departure of the _Fox_ they had fetched everything away, and had\r\nnot left a trace even of their passage. A slight coating of snow\r\ncovered the ground. Hatteras was confounded. The doctor looked and\r\nshook his head. Shandon still said nothing, but an attentive observer\r\nwould have noticed his lips curl with a cruel smile. At this moment\r\nthe men sent by Lieutenant Wall came up; they soon saw the state of\r\naffairs. Shandon advanced towards the captain, and said:\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Hatteras, we need not despair; happily we are near the entrance\r\nto Barrow Strait, which will take us back to Baffin's Sea!\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Shandon,\" answered Hatteras, \"happily we are near the entrance\r\nto Wellington Strait, and that will take us north!\"\r\n\r\n\"But how shall we get along, captain?\"\r\n\r\n\"With the sails, sir. We have two months' firing left, and that is\r\nenough for our wintering.\"\r\n\r\n\"But allow me to tell you----\" added Shandon.\r\n\r\n\"I will allow you to follow me on board my ship, sir,\" answered\r\nHatteras, and turning his back on his second, he returned to the brig\r\nand shut himself up in his cabin. For the next two days the wind was\r\ncontrary, and the captain did not show up on deck. The doctor profited\r\nby the forced sojourn to go over Beechey Island; he gathered some\r\nplants, which the temperature, relatively high, allowed to grow here\r\nand there on the rocks that the snow had left, some heaths, a few\r\nlichens, a sort of yellow ranunculus, a sort of plant something like\r\nsorrel, with wider leaves and more veins, and some pretty vigorous\r\nsaxifrages. He found the fauna of this country much richer than the\r\nflora; he perceived long flocks of geese and cranes going northward,\r\npartridges, eider ducks of a bluish black, sandpipers, a sort of\r\nwading bird of the scolopax class, northern divers, plungers with\r\nvery long bodies, numerous ptarmites, a sort of bird very good to\r\neat, dovekies with black bodies, wings spotted with white, feet and\r\nbeak red as coral; noisy bands of kittywakes and fat loons with white\r\nbreasts, represented the ornithology of the island. The doctor was\r\nfortunate enough to kill a few grey hares, which had not yet put on\r\ntheir white winter fur, and a blue fox which Dick ran down skilfully.\r\nSome bears, evidently accustomed to dread the presence of men, would\r\nnot allow themselves to be got at, and the seals were extremely timid,\r\ndoubtless for the same reason as their enemies the bears. The class\r\nof articulated animals was represented by a single mosquito, which\r\nthe doctor caught to his great delight, though not till it had stung\r\nhim. As a conchologist he was less favoured, and only found a sort\r\nof mussel and some bivalve shells.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\nTHE DEATH OF BELLOT\r\n\r\n\r\nThe temperature during the days of the 3rd and 4th of July kept up\r\nto 57 degrees; this was the highest thermometric point observed during\r\nthe campaign. But on Thursday, the 5th, the wind turned to the\r\nsouth-east, and was accompanied by violent snow-storms. The\r\nthermometer fell during the preceding night to 23 degrees. Hatteras\r\ntook no notice of the murmurs of the crew, and gave orders to get\r\nunder way. For the last thirteen days, from Cape Dundas, the _Forward_\r\nhad not been able to gain one more degree north, so the party\r\nrepresented by Clifton was no longer satisfied, but wished like\r\nHatteras to get into Wellington Channel, and worked away with a will.\r\nThe brig had some difficulty in getting under sail; but Hatteras\r\nhaving set his mizensail, his topsails, and his gallantsails during\r\nthe night, advanced boldly in the midst of fields of ice which the\r\ncurrent was drifting south. The crew were tired out with this winding\r\nnavigation, which kept them constantly at work at the sails.\r\nWellington Channel is not very wide; it is bounded by North Devon\r\non the east and Cornwallis Island on the west; this island was long\r\nbelieved to be a peninsula. It was Sir John Franklin who first sailed\r\nround it in 1846, starting west, and coming back to the same point\r\nto the north of the channel. The exploration of Wellington Channel\r\nwas made in 1851 by Captain Penny in the whalers _Lady Franklin_ and\r\n_Sophia_; one of his lieutenants, Stewart, reached Cape Beecher in\r\nlatitude 76 degrees 20 minutes, and discovered the open sea--that\r\nopen sea which was Hatteras's dream!\r\n\r\n\"What Stewart found I shall find,\" said he to the doctor; \"then I\r\nshall be able to set sail to the Pole.\"\r\n\r\n\"But aren't you afraid that your crew----\"\r\n\r\n\"My crew!\" said Hatteras severely. Then in a low tone--\"Poor fellows!\"\r\nmurmured he, to the great astonishment of the doctor. It was the first\r\nexpression of feeling he had heard the captain deliver.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" he repeated with energy, \"they must follow me! They shall follow\r\nme!\"\r\n\r\nHowever, although the _Forward_ had nothing to fear from the collision\r\nof the ice-streams, which were still pretty far apart, they made very\r\nlittle progress northward, for contrary winds often forced them to\r\nstop. They passed Capes Spencer and Innis slowly, and on Tuesday,\r\nthe 10th, cleared 75 degrees to the great delight of Clifton. The\r\n_Forward_ was then at the very place where the American ships, the\r\n_Rescue_ and the _Advance_, encountered such terrible dangers.\r\nDoctor Kane formed part of this expedition; towards the end of\r\nSeptember, 1850, these ships got caught in an ice-bank, and were\r\nforcibly driven into Lancaster Strait. It was Shandon who related\r\nthis catastrophe to James Wall before some of the brig's crew.\r\n\r\n\"The _Advance_ and the _Rescue_,\" he said to them, \"were so knocked\r\nabout by the ice, that they were obliged to leave off fires on board;\r\nbut that did not prevent the temperature sinking 18 degrees below\r\nzero. During the whole winter the unfortunate crews were kept\r\nprisoners in the ice-bank, ready to abandon their ships at any moment;\r\nfor three weeks they did not even change their clothes. They floated\r\nalong in that dreadful situation for more than a thousand miles, when\r\nat last they were thrown into the middle of Baffin's Sea.\"\r\n\r\nThe effect of this speech upon a crew already badly disposed can be\r\nwell imagined. During this conversation Johnson was talking to the\r\ndoctor about an event that had taken place in those very quarters;\r\nhe asked the doctor to tell him when the brig was in latitude 75 degrees\r\n30 minutes, and when they passed it he cried:\r\n\r\n\"Yes, it was just there!\" in saying which tears filled his eyes.\r\n\r\n\"You mean that Lieutenant Bellot died there?\" said the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Mr. Clawbonny. He was as good and brave a fellow as ever lived!\r\nIt was upon this very North Devon coast! It was to be, I suppose,\r\nbut if Captain Pullen had returned on board sooner it would not have\r\nhappened.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, Johnson?\"\r\n\r\n\"Listen to me, Mr. Clawbonny, and you will see on what a slight thread\r\nexistence often hangs. You know that Lieutenant Bellot went his first\r\ncampaign in search of Franklin in 1850?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, on the _Prince Albert_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, when he got back to France he obtained permission to embark\r\non board the _Phoenix_ under Captain Inglefield; I was a sailor on\r\nboard. We came with the _Breadalbane_ to transport provisions to\r\nBeechey Island!\"\r\n\r\n\"Those provisions we, unfortunately, did not find. Well?\"\r\n\r\n\"We reached Beechey Island in the beginning of August; on the 10th\r\nCaptain Inglefield left the _Phoenix_ to rejoin Captain Pullen, who\r\nhad been separated from his ship, the _North Star_, for a month. When\r\nhe came back he thought of sending his Admiralty despatches to Sir\r\nEdward Belcher, who was wintering in Wellington Channel. A little\r\nwhile after the departure of our captain, Captain Pullen got back\r\nto his ship. Why did he not arrive before the departure of Captain\r\nInglefield? Lieutenant Bellot, fearing that our captain would be long\r\naway, and knowing that the Admiralty despatches ought to be sent at\r\nonce, offered to take them himself. He left the command of the two\r\nships to Captain Pullen, and set out on the 12th of August with a\r\nsledge and an indiarubber boat. He took the boatswain of the _North\r\nStar_ (Harvey) with him, and three sailors, Madden, David Hook, and\r\nme. We supposed that Sir Edward Belcher was to be found in the\r\nneighbourhood of Beecher Cape, to the north of the channel; we made\r\nfor it with our sledge along the eastern coast. The first day we\r\nencamped about three miles from Cape Innis; the next day we stopped\r\non a block of ice about three miles from Cape Bowden. As land lay\r\nat about three miles' distance, Lieutenant Bellot resolved to go and\r\nencamp there during the night, which was as light as the day; he tried\r\nto get to it in his indiarubber canoe; he was twice repulsed by a\r\nviolent breeze from the south-east; Harvey and Madden attempted the\r\npassage in their turn, and were more fortunate; they took a cord with\r\nthem, and established a communication between the coast and the\r\nsledge; three objects were transported by means of the cord, but at\r\nthe fourth attempt we felt our block of ice move; Mr. Bellot called\r\nout to his companions to drop the cord, and we were dragged to a great\r\ndistance from the coast. The wind blew from the south-east, and it\r\nwas snowing; but we were not in much danger, and the lieutenant might\r\nhave come back as we did.\"\r\n\r\nHere Johnson stopped an instant to take a glance at the fatal coast,\r\nand continued:\r\n\r\n\"After our companions were lost to sight we tried to shelter ourselves\r\nunder the tent of our sledge, but in vain; then, with our knives,\r\nwe began to cut out a house in the ice. Mr. Bellot helped us for half\r\nan hour, and talked to us about the danger of our situation. I told\r\nhim I was not afraid. 'By God's help,' he answered, 'we shall not\r\nlose a hair of our heads.' I asked him what o'clock it was, and he\r\nanswered, 'About a quarter-past six.' It was a quarter-past six in\r\nthe morning of Thursday, August 18th. Then Mr. Bellot tied up his\r\nbooks, and said he would go and see how the ice floated; he had only\r\nbeen gone four minutes when I went round the block of ice to look\r\nfor him; I saw his stick on the opposite side of a crevice, about\r\nfive fathoms wide, where the ice was broken, but I could not see him\r\nanywhere. I called out, but no one answered. The wind was blowing\r\ngreat guns. I looked all round the block of ice, but found no trace\r\nof the poor lieutenant.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you think had become of him?\" said the doctor, much moved.\r\n\r\n\"I think that when Mr. Bellot got out of shelter the wind blew him\r\ninto the crevice, and, as his greatcoat was buttoned up he could not\r\nswim. Oh! Mr. Clawbonny, I never was more grieved in my life! I could\r\nnot believe it! He was a victim to duty, for it was in order to obey\r\nCaptain Pullen's instructions that he tried to get to land. He was\r\na good fellow, everybody liked him; even the Esquimaux, when they\r\nlearnt his fate from Captain Inglefield on his return from Pound Bay,\r\ncried while they wept, as I am doing now, 'Poor Bellot! poor Bellot!'\"\r\n\r\n\"But you and your companion, Johnson,\" said the doctor, \"how did you\r\nmanage to reach land?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! we stayed twenty-four hours more on the block of ice, without\r\nfood or firing; but at last we met with an ice-field; we jumped on\r\nto it, and with the help of an oar we fastened ourselves to an iceberg\r\nthat we could guide like a raft, and we got to land, but without our\r\nbrave officer.\"\r\n\r\nBy the time Johnson had finished his story the _Forward_ had passed\r\nthe fatal coast, and Johnson lost sight of the place of the painful\r\ncatastrophe. The next day they left Griffin Bay to the starboard,\r\nand, two days after, Capes Grinnell and Helpmann; at last, on the\r\n14th of July, they doubled Osborn Point, and on the 15th the brig\r\nanchored in Baring Bay, at the extremity of the channel. Navigation\r\nhad not been very difficult; Hatteras met with a sea almost as free\r\nas that of which Belcher profited to go and winter with the _Pioneer_\r\nand the _Assistance_ as far north as 77 degrees. It was in 1852 and\r\n1853, during his first wintering, for he passed the winter of 1853\r\nto 1854 in Baring Bay, where the _Forward_ was now at anchor. He\r\nsuffered so much that he was obliged to leave the _Assistance_ in\r\nthe midst of the ice. Shandon told all these details to the already\r\ndiscontented sailors. Did Hatteras know how he was betrayed by his\r\nfirst officer? It is impossible to say; if he did, he said nothing\r\nabout it.\r\n\r\nAt the top of Baring Bay there is a narrow channel which puts\r\nWellington and Queen's Channel into communication with each other.\r\nThere the rafts of ice lie closely packed. Hatteras tried, in vain,\r\nto clear the passes to the north of Hamilton Island; the wind was\r\ncontrary; five precious days were lost in useless efforts. The\r\ntemperature still lowered, and, on the 19th of July, fell to 26\r\ndegrees; it got higher the following day; but this foretaste of winter\r\nmade Hatteras afraid of waiting any longer. The wind seemed to be\r\ngoing to keep in the west, and to stop the progress of the ship. However,\r\nhe was in a hurry to gain the point where Stewart had met with the\r\nopen sea. On the 19th he resolved to get into the Channel at any price;\r\nthe wind blew right on the brig, which might, with her screw, have\r\nstood against it, had not Hatteras been obliged to economise his fuel;\r\non the other hand, the Channel was too wide to allow the men to haul\r\nthe brig along. Hatteras, not considering the men's fatigue, resolved\r\nto have recourse to means often employed by whalers under similar\r\ncircumstances. The men took it in turns to row, so as to push the\r\nbrig on against the wind. The _Forward_ advanced slowly up the Channel.\r\nThe men were worn out and murmured loudly. They went on in that manner\r\ntill the 23rd of July, when they reached Baring Island in Queen's\r\nChannel. The wind was still against them. The doctor thought the\r\nhealth of the men much shaken, and perceived the first symptoms of\r\nscurvy amongst them; he did all he could to prevent the spread of\r\nthe wretched malady, and distributed lime-juice to the men.\r\n\r\nHatteras saw that he could no longer count upon his crew; reasoning\r\nand kindness were ineffectual, so he resolved to employ severity for\r\nthe future; he suspected Shandon and Wall, though they dare not speak\r\nout openly. Hatteras had the doctor, Johnson, Bell, and Simpson for\r\nhim; they were devoted to him body and soul; amongst the undecided\r\nwere Foker, Bolton, Wolsten the gunsmith, and Brunton the first\r\nengineer; and they might turn against the captain at any moment; as\r\nto Pen, Gripper, Clifton, and Warren, they were in open revolt; they\r\nwished to persuade their comrades to force the captain to return to\r\nEngland. Hatteras soon saw that he could not continue to work his\r\nship with such a crew. He remained twenty-four hours at Baring Island\r\nwithout taking a step forward. The weather grew cooler still, for\r\nwinter begins to be felt in July in these high latitudes. On the 24th\r\nthe thermometer fell to 22 degrees. Young ice formed during the night,\r\nand if snow fell it would soon be thick enough to bear the weight\r\nof a man. The sea began already to have that dirty colour which\r\nprecedes the formation of the first crystals. Hatteras could not\r\nmistake these alarming symptoms; if the channels got blocked up, he\r\nshould be obliged to winter there at a great distance from the point\r\nhe had undertaken the voyage in order to reach, without having caught\r\na glimpse of that open sea which his predecessors made out was so\r\nnear. He resolved, then, to gain several degrees further north, at\r\nwhatever cost; seeing that he could not employ oars without the rowers\r\nwere willing, nor sail in a contrary wind, he gave orders to put steam\r\non again.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\nBEGINNING OF REVOLT\r\n\r\n\r\nAt this unexpected command, the surprise was great on board the\r\n_Forward_.\r\n\r\n\"Light the fires!\" exclaimed some.\r\n\r\n\"What with?\" asked others.\r\n\r\n\"When we've only two months' coal in the hold!\" said Pen.\r\n\r\n\"What shall we warm ourselves with in the winter?\" asked Clifton.\r\n\r\n\"We shall be obliged to burn the brig down to her water-line,\" answered\r\nGripper.\r\n\r\n\"And stuff the stove with the masts,\" added Warren. Shandon looked\r\nat Wall. The stupefied engineers hesitated to go down to the\r\nmachine-room.\r\n\r\n\"Did you hear me?\" cried the captain in an irritated tone.\r\n\r\nBrunton made for the hatchway, but before going down he stopped.\r\n\r\n\"Don't go, Brunton!\" called out a voice.\r\n\r\n\"Who spoke?\" cried Hatteras.\r\n\r\n\"I did,\" said Pen, advancing towards the captain.\r\n\r\n\"And what did you say?\" asked Hatteras.\r\n\r\n\"I say,\" answered Pen with an oath--\"I say, we've had enough of it,\r\nand we won't go any further. You shan't kill us with hunger and work\r\nin the winter, and they shan't light the fires!\"\r\n\r\n\"Mr. Shandon,\" answered Hatteras calmly, \"have that man put in irons!\"\r\n\r\n\"But, captain,\" replied Shandon, \"what the man says----\"\r\n\r\n\"If you repeat what the man says,\" answered Hatteras, \"I'll have you\r\nshut up in your cabin and guarded! Seize that man! Do you hear?\"\r\nJohnson, Bell, and Simpson advanced towards the sailor, who was in\r\na terrible passion.\r\n\r\n\"The first who touches me----\" he said, brandishing a handspike.\r\nHatteras approached him.\r\n\r\n\"Pen,\" said he tranquilly, \"if you move, I shall blow out your brains!\"\r\nSo speaking, he cocked a pistol and aimed it at the sailor. A murmur\r\nwas heard.\r\n\r\n\"Not a word, men,\" said Hatteras, \"or that man falls dead!\" Johnson\r\nand Bell disarmed Pen, who no longer made any resistance, and placed\r\nhim in the hold.\r\n\r\n\"Go, Brunton,\" said Hatteras. The engineer, followed by Plover and\r\nWarren, went down to his post. Hatteras returned to the poop.\r\n\r\n\"That Pen is a wretched fellow!\" said the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"No man has ever been nearer death!\" answered the captain, simply.\r\n\r\nThe steam was soon got up, the anchors were weighed, and the _Forward_\r\nveered away east, cutting the young ice with her steel prow. Between\r\nBaring Island and Beecher Point there are a considerable quantity\r\nof islands in the midst of ice-fields; the streams crowd together\r\nin the little channels which cut up this part of the sea; they had\r\na tendency to agglomerate under the relatively low temperature;\r\nhummocks were formed here and there, and these masses, already more\r\ncompact, denser, and closer together, would soon form an impenetrable\r\nmass. The _Forward_ made its way with great difficulty amidst the\r\nsnowstorms. However, with the mobility that characterises the\r\nclimate of these regions, the sun appeared from time to time, the\r\ntemperature went up several degrees, obstacles melted as if by magic,\r\nand a fine sheet of water lay where icebergs bristled all the passes.\r\nThe horizon glowed with those magnificent orange shades which rest\r\nthe eye, tired with the eternal white of the snow.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of July the _Forward_ passed Dundas Island, and veered\r\nafterwards more to the north; but there Hatteras found himself\r\nopposite an ice-bank eight or nine feet high, formed of little\r\nicebergs detached from the coast; he was obliged to turn west. The\r\nuninterrupted cracking of the ice, added to the noise of the steamer,\r\nwas like sighs or groans. At last the brig found a channel, and\r\nadvanced painfully along it; often an enormous iceberg hindered her\r\ncourse for hours; the fog hindered the pilot's look-out; as long as\r\nhe can see for a mile in front of him, he can easily avoid obstacles;\r\nbut in the midst of the fog it was often impossible to see a cable's\r\nlength, and the swell was very strong. Sometimes the clouds looked\r\nsmooth and white as though they were reflections of the ice-banks;\r\nbut there were entire days when the yellow rays of the sun could not\r\npierce the tenacious fog. Birds were still very numerous, and their\r\ncries were deafening; seals, lying idle on the floating ice, raised\r\ntheir heads, very little frightened, and moved their long necks as\r\nthe brig passed. Pieces from the ship's sheathing were often rubbed\r\noff in her contact with the ice. At last, after six days of slow\r\nnavigation, Point Beecher was sighted to the north on the 1st of August.\r\nHatteras passed the last few hours at his masthead; the open sea that\r\nStewart had perceived on May 30th, 1851, about latitude 76 degrees\r\n20 minutes, could not be far off; but as far as the eye could reach,\r\nHatteras saw no indication of it. He came down without saying a word.\r\n\r\n\"Do you believe in an open sea?\" asked Shandon of the lieutenant.\r\n\r\n\"I am beginning not to,\" answered Wall.\r\n\r\n\"Wasn't I right to say the pretended discovery was purely imagination?\r\nBut they would not believe me, and even you were against me, Wall.\"\r\n\r\n\"We shall believe in you for the future, Shandon.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said he, \"when it's too late,\" and so saying he went back to\r\nhis cabin, where he had stopped almost ever since his dispute with\r\nthe captain. The wind veered round south towards evening; Hatteras\r\nordered the brig to be put under sail and the fires to be put out;\r\nthe crew had to work very hard for the next few days; they were more\r\nthan a week getting to Barrow Point. The _Forward_ had only made thirty\r\nmiles in ten days. There the wind turned north again, and the screw\r\nwas set to work. Hatteras still hoped to find an open sea beyond the\r\n77th parallel, as Sir Edward Belcher had done. Ought he to treat these\r\naccounts as apocryphal? or had the winter come upon him earlier? On\r\nthe 15th of August Mount Percy raised its peak, covered with eternal\r\nsnow, through the mist. The next day the sun set for the first time,\r\nending thus the long series of days with twenty-four hours in them.\r\nThe men had ended by getting accustomed to the continual daylight,\r\nbut it had never made any difference to the animals; the Greenland\r\ndogs went to their rest at their accustomed hour, and Dick slept as\r\nregularly every evening as though darkness had covered the sky. Still,\r\nduring the nights which followed the 15th of August, darkness was\r\nnever profound; although the sun set, he still gave sufficient light\r\nby refraction. On the 19th of August, after a pretty good observation,\r\nthey sighted Cape Franklin on the east coast and Cape Lady Franklin\r\non the west coast; the gratitude of the English people had given these\r\nnames to the two opposite points--probably the last reached by\r\nFranklin: the name of the devoted wife, opposite to that of her husband,\r\nis a touching emblem of the sympathy which always united them.\r\n\r\nThe doctor, by following Johnson's advice, accustomed himself to\r\nsupport the low temperature; he almost always stayed on deck braving\r\nthe cold, the wind, and the snow. He got rather thinner, but his\r\nconstitution did not suffer. Besides, he expected to be much worse\r\noff, and joyfully prepared for the approaching winter.\r\n\r\n\"Look at those birds,\" he said to Johnson one day; \"they are emigrating\r\nsouth in flocks! They are shrieking out their good-byes!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Mr. Clawbonny, some instinct tells them they must go, and they\r\nset out.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's more than one amongst us who would like to imitate them,\r\nI think.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are cowards, Mr. Clawbonny; those animals have no provisions\r\nas we have, and are obliged to seek their food where it is to be found.\r\nBut sailors, with a good ship under their feet, ought to go to the\r\nworld's end.\"\r\n\r\n\"You hope that Hatteras will succeed, then?\"\r\n\r\n\"He certainly will, Mr. Clawbonny.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am of the same opinion as you, Johnson, and if he only wanted one\r\nfaithful companion----\"\r\n\r\n\"He'll have two!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Johnson,\" answered the doctor, shaking hands with the brave\r\nsailor.\r\n\r\nPrince Albert Land, which the _Forward_ was then coasting, bears also\r\nthe name of Grinnell Land, and though Hatteras, from his hatred to\r\nthe Yankees, would never call it by its American name, it is the one\r\nit generally goes by. It owes its double appellation to the following\r\ncircumstances: At the same time that Penny, an Englishman, gave it\r\nthe name of Prince Albert, Lieutenant Haven, commander of the _Rescue_,\r\ncalled it Grinnell Land in honour of the American merchant who had\r\nfitted out the expedition from New York at his own expense. Whilst\r\nthe brig was coasting it, she experienced a series of unheard-of\r\ndifficulties, navigating sometimes under sail, sometimes by steam.\r\nOn the 18th of August they sighted Britannia Mountain, scarcely\r\nvisible through the mist, and the _Forward_ weighed anchor the next\r\nday in Northumberland Bay. She was hemmed in on all sides.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\nATTACKED BY ICEBERGS\r\n\r\n\r\nHatteras, after seeing to the anchoring of his ship, re-entered his\r\ncabin and examined his map attentively. He found himself in latitude\r\n76 degrees 57 minutes and longitude 99 degrees 20 minutes--that is\r\nto say, at only three minutes from the 77th parallel. It was at this\r\nvery spot that Sir Edward Belcher passed his first winter with the\r\n_Pioneer_ and the _Assistance_. It was thence that he organised his\r\nsledge and boat excursions. He discovered Table Isle, North Cornwall,\r\nVictoria Archipelago, and Belcher Channel. He reached the 78th\r\nparallel, and saw that the coast was depressed on the south-east.\r\nIt seemed to go down to Jones's Strait, the entrance to which lies\r\nin Baffin's Bay. But to the north-west, on the contrary, says his\r\nreport, an open sea lay as far as the eye could reach.\r\n\r\nHatteras considered attentively the white part of the map, which\r\nrepresented the Polar basin free from ice.\r\n\r\n\"After such testimony as that of Stewart, Penny, and Belcher, I can't\r\nhave a doubt about it,\" he said to himself. \"They saw it with their\r\nown eyes. But if the winter has already frozen it! But no; they made\r\ntheir discoveries at intervals of several years. It exists, and I\r\nshall find it! I shall see it.\"\r\n\r\nHatteras went on to the poop. An intense fog enveloped the _Forward_;\r\nthe masthead could scarcely be distinguished from the deck. However,\r\nHatteras called down the ice-master from his crow's nest, and took\r\nhis place. He wished to profit by the shortest clear interval to\r\nexamine the north-western horizon. Shandon did not let the occasion\r\nslip for saying to the lieutenant:\r\n\r\n\"Well, Wall, where is the open sea?\"\r\n\r\n\"You were right, Shandon, and we have only six weeks' coal in the\r\nhold.\"\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps the doctor will find us some scientific fuel to warm us in\r\nthe place of coal,\" answered Shandon. \"I have heard say you can turn\r\nfire to ice; perhaps he'll turn ice to fire.\" And he entered his cabin,\r\nshrugging his shoulders. The next day was the 20th of August, and\r\nthe fog cleared away for several minutes. They saw Hatteras look\r\neagerly at the horizon, and then come down without speaking; but it\r\nwas easy to see that his hopes had again been crushed. The _Forward_\r\nweighed anchor, and took up her uncertain march northward. As the\r\n_Forward_ began to be weather-worn, the masts were unreeved, for they\r\ncould no longer rely on the variable wind, and the sails were nearly\r\nuseless in the winding channels. Large white marks appeared here and\r\nthere on the sea like oil spots; they presaged an approaching frost;\r\nas soon as the breeze dropped the sea began to freeze immediately;\r\nbut as soon as the wind got up again, the young ice was broken up\r\nand dispersed. Towards evening the thermometer went down to 17\r\ndegrees.\r\n\r\nWhen the brig came to a closed-up pass she acted as a battering ram,\r\nand ran at full steam against the obstacle, which she sunk. Sometimes\r\nthey thought she was stopped for good; but an unexpected movement\r\nof the streams opened her a new passage, and she took advantage of\r\nit boldly. When the brig stopped, the steam which escaped from the\r\nsafety-pipes was condensed by the cold air and fell in snow on to\r\nthe deck. Another impediment came in the way; the ice-blocks sometimes\r\ngot entangled in the paddles, and they were so hard that all the\r\nstrength of the machine was not sufficient to break them; it was then\r\nnecessary to back the engine and send men to clear the screws with\r\ntheir handspikes. All this delayed the brig; it lasted thirteen days.\r\nThe _Forward_ dragged herself painfully along Penny Strait; the crew\r\ngrumbled, but obeyed: the men saw now that it was impossible to go\r\nback. Keeping north was less dangerous than retreating south. They\r\nwere obliged to think about wintering. The sailors talked together\r\nabout their present position, and one day they mentioned it to Richard\r\nShandon, who, they knew, was on their side. The second officer forgot\r\nhis duty as an officer, and allowed them to discuss the authority\r\nof the captain before him.\r\n\r\n\"You say, then, Mr. Shandon, that we can't go back now?\" said Gripper.\r\n\r\n\"No, it's too late now,\" answered Shandon.\r\n\r\n\"Then we must think about wintering,\" said another sailor.\r\n\r\n\"It's the only thing we can do. They wouldn't believe me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Another time,\" said Pen, who had been released, \"we shall believe\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\"But as I am not the master----\" replied Shandon.\r\n\r\n\"Who says you mayn't be?\" answered Pen. \"John Hatteras may go as far\r\nas he likes, but we aren't obliged to follow him.\"\r\n\r\n\"You all know what became of the crew that did follow him in his first\r\ncruise to Baffin's Sea?\" said Gripper.\r\n\r\n\"And the cruise of the _Farewell_ under him that got lost in the\r\nSpitzbergen seas!\" said Clifton.\r\n\r\n\"He was the only man that came back,\" continued Gripper.\r\n\r\n\"He and his dog,\" answered Clifton.\r\n\r\n\"We won't die for his pleasure,\" added Pen.\r\n\r\n\"Nor lose the bounty we've been at so much trouble to earn,\" cried\r\nClifton. \"When we've passed the 78th degree--and we aren't far off\r\nit, I know--that will make just the 375 pounds each.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" answered Gripper, \"shan't we lose it if we go back without\r\nthe captain?\"\r\n\r\n\"Not if we prove that we were obliged to,\" answered Clifton.\r\n\r\n\"But it's the captain----\"\r\n\r\n\"You never mind, Gripper,\" answered Pen; \"we'll have a captain and\r\na good one--that Mr. Shandon knows. When one commander goes mad, folks\r\nhave done with him, and they take another; don't they, Mr. Shandon?\"\r\n\r\nShandon answered evasively that they could reckon upon him, but that\r\nthey must wait to see what turned up. Difficulties were getting thick\r\nround Hatteras, but he was as firm, calm, energetic, and confident\r\nas ever. After all, he had done in five months what other navigators\r\nhad taken two or three years to do! He should be obliged to winter\r\nnow, but there was nothing to frighten brave sailors in that. Sir\r\nJohn Ross and McClure had passed three successive winters in the\r\nArctic regions. What they had done he could do too!\r\n\r\n\"If I had only been able to get up Smith Strait at the north of Baffin's\r\nSea, I should be at the Pole by now!\" he said to the doctor regretfully.\r\n\r\n\"Never mind, captain!\" answered the doctor, \"we shall get at it by\r\nthe 99th meridian instead of by the 75th; if all roads lead to Rome,\r\nit's more certain still that all meridians lead to the Pole.\"\r\n\r\nOn the 31st of August the thermometer marked 13 degrees. The end of\r\nthe navigable season was approaching; the _Forward_ left Exmouth\r\nIsland to the starboard, and three days after passed Table Island\r\nin the middle of Belcher Channel. At an earlier period it would perhaps\r\nhave been possible to regain Baffin's Sea by this channel, but it\r\nwas not to be dreamt of then; this arm of the sea was entirely\r\nbarricaded by ice; ice-fields extended as far as the eye could reach,\r\nand would do so for eight months longer. Happily they could still\r\ngain a few minutes further north on the condition of breaking up the\r\nice with huge clubs and petards. Now the temperature was so low, any\r\nwind, even a contrary one, was welcome, for in a calm the sea froze\r\nin a single night. The _Forward_ could not winter in her present\r\nsituation, exposed to winds, icebergs, and the drift from the channel;\r\na shelter was the first thing to find; Hatteras hoped to gain the\r\ncoast of New Cornwall, and to find above Albert Point a bay of refuge\r\nsufficiently sheltered. He therefore pursued his course northward\r\nwith perseverance. But on the 8th an impenetrable ice-bank lay in\r\nfront of him, and the temperature was at 10 degrees. Hatteras did\r\nall he could to force a passage, continually risking his ship and\r\ngetting out of danger by force of skill. He could be accused of\r\nimprudence, want of reflection, folly, blindness, but he was a good\r\nsailor, and one of the best! The situation of the _Forward_ became\r\nreally dangerous; the sea closed up behind her, and in a few hours\r\nthe ice got so hard that the men could run along it and tow the ship\r\nin all security.\r\n\r\nHatteras found he could not get round the obstacle, so he resolved\r\nto attack it in front; he used his strongest blasting cylinders of\r\neight to ten pounds of powder; they began by making a hole in the\r\nthick of the ice, and filled it with snow, taking care to place the\r\ncylinder in a horizontal position, so that a greater portion of the\r\nice might be submitted to the explosion; lastly, they lighted the\r\nwick, which was protected by a gutta-percha tube. They worked at the\r\nblasting, as they could not saw, for the saws stuck immediately in\r\nthe ice. Hatteras hoped to pass the next day. But during the night\r\na violent wind raged, and the sea rose under her crust of ice as if\r\nshaken by some submarine commotion, and the terrified voice of the\r\npilot was heard crying:\r\n\r\n\"Look out aft!\"\r\n\r\nHatteras turned to the direction indicated, and what he saw by the\r\ndim twilight was frightful. A high iceberg, driven back north, was\r\nrushing on to the ship with the rapidity of an avalanche.\r\n\r\n\"All hands on deck!\" cried the captain.\r\n\r\nThe rolling mountain was hardly half a mile off; the blocks of ice\r\nwere driven about like so many huge grains of sand; the tempest raged\r\nwith fury.\r\n\r\n\"There, Mr. Clawbonny,\" said Johnson to the doctor, \"we are in\r\nsomething like danger now.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" answered the doctor tranquilly, \"it looks frightful enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's an assault we shall have to repulse,\" replied the boatswain.\r\n\r\n\"It looks like a troop of antediluvian animals, those that were\r\nsupposed to inhabit the Pole. They are trying which shall get here\r\nfirst!\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" added Johnson, \"I hope we shan't get one of their spikes into\r\nus!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a siege--let's run to the ramparts!\"\r\n\r\nAnd they made haste aft, where the crew, armed with poles, bars of\r\niron, and handspikes, were getting ready to repulse the formidable\r\nenemy. The avalanche came nearer, and got bigger by the addition of\r\nthe blocks of ice which it caught in its passage; Hatteras gave orders\r\nto fire the cannon in the bow to break the threatening line. But it\r\narrived and rushed on to the brig; a great crackling noise was heard,\r\nand as it struck on the brig's starboard a part of her barricading\r\nwas broken. Hatteras gave his men orders to keep steady and prepare\r\nfor the ice. It came along in blocks; some of them weighing several\r\nhundredweight came over the ship's side; the smaller ones, thrown\r\nup as high as the topsails, fell in little spikes, breaking the shrouds\r\nand cutting the rigging. The ship was boarded by these innumerable\r\nenemies, which in a block would have crushed a hundred ships like\r\nthe _Forward_. Some of the sailors were badly wounded whilst trying\r\nto keep off the ice, and Bolton had his left shoulder torn open. The\r\nnoise was deafening. Dick barked with rage at this new kind of enemy.\r\nThe obscurity of the night came to add to the horror of the situation,\r\nbut did not hide the threatening blocks, their white surface reflected\r\nthe last gleams of light. Hatteras's orders were heard in the midst\r\nof the crew's strange struggle with the icebergs. The ship giving\r\nway to the tremendous pressure, bent to the larboard, and the\r\nextremity of her mainyard leaned like a buttress against the iceberg\r\nand threatened to break her mast.\r\n\r\nHatteras saw the danger; it was a terrible moment; the brig threatened\r\nto turn completely over, and the masting might be carried away. An\r\nenormous block, as big as the steamer itself, came up alongside her\r\nhull; it rose higher and higher on the waves; it was already above\r\nthe poop; it fell over the _Forward_. All was lost; it was now upright,\r\nhigher than the gallant yards, and it shook on its foundation. A cry\r\nof terror escaped the crew. Everyone fled to starboard. But at this\r\nmoment the steamer was lifted completely up, and for a little while\r\nshe seemed to be suspended in the air, and fell again on to the\r\nice-blocks; then she rolled over till her planks cracked again. After\r\na minute, which appeared a century, she found herself again in her\r\nnatural element, having been turned over the ice-bank that blocked\r\nher passage by the rising of the sea.\r\n\r\n\"She's cleared the ice-bank!\" shouted Johnson, who had rushed to the\r\nfore of the brig.\r\n\r\n\"Thank God!\" answered Hatteras.\r\n\r\nThe brig was now in the midst of a pond of ice, which hemmed her in\r\non every side, and though her keel was in the water, she could not\r\nmove; she was immovable, but the ice-field moved for her.\r\n\r\n\"We are drifting, captain!\" cried Johnson.\r\n\r\n\"We must drift,\" answered Hatteras; \"we can't help ourselves.\"\r\n\r\nWhen daylight came, it was seen that the brig was drifting rapidly\r\nnorthward, along with a submarine current. The floating mass carried\r\nthe _Forward_ along with it. In case of accident, when the brig might\r\nbe thrown on her side, or crushed by the pressure of the ice, Hatteras\r\nhad a quantity of provisions brought up on deck, along with materials\r\nfor encamping, the clothes and blankets of the crew. Taking example\r\nfrom Captain McClure under similar circumstances, he caused the brig\r\nto be surrounded by a belt of hammocks, filled with air, so as to\r\nshield her from the thick of the damage; the ice soon accumulated\r\nunder a temperature of 7 degrees, and the ship was surrounded by a\r\nwall of ice, above which her masts only were to be seen. They navigated\r\nthus for seven days; Point Albert, the western extremity of New\r\nCornwall, was sighted on the 10th of September, but soon disappeared;\r\nfrom thence the ice-field drifted east. Where would it take them to?\r\nWhere should they stop? Who could tell? The crew waited, and the men\r\nfolded their arms. At last, on the 15th of September, about three\r\no'clock in the afternoon, the ice-field, stopped, probably, by\r\ncollision with another field, gave a violent shake to the brig, and\r\nstood still. Hatteras found himself out of sight of land in latitude\r\n78 degrees 15 minutes and longitude 95 degrees 35 minutes in the midst\r\nof the unknown sea, where geographers have placed the Frozen Pole.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\nPREPARATIONS FOR WINTERING\r\n\r\n\r\nThe southern hemisphere is colder in parallel latitudes than the\r\nnorthern hemisphere; but the temperature of the new continent is still\r\n15 degrees below that of the other parts of the world; and in America\r\nthe countries known under the name of the Frozen Pole are the most\r\nformidable. The average temperature of the year is 2 degrees below\r\nzero. Scientific men, and Dr. Clawbonny amongst them, explain the\r\nfact in the following way. According to them, the prevailing winds\r\nof the northern regions of America blow from the south-west; they\r\ncome from the Pacific Ocean with an equal and bearable temperature;\r\nbut in order to reach the Arctic Seas they have to cross the immense\r\nAmerican territory, covered with snow, they get cold by contact with\r\nit, and then cover the hyperborean regions with their frigid violence.\r\nHatteras found himself at the Frozen Pole beyond the countries seen\r\nby his predecessors; he, therefore, expected a terrible winter on\r\na ship lost in the midst of the ice with a crew nearly in revolt.\r\nHe resolved to face these dangers with his accustomed energy. He began\r\nby taking, with the help of Johnson's experience, all the measures\r\nnecessary for wintering. According to his calculations he had been\r\ndragged two hundred and fifty miles beyond New Cornwall, the last\r\ncountry discovered; he was clasped in an ice-field as securely as\r\nin a bed of granite, and no power on earth could extricate him.\r\n\r\nThere no longer existed a drop of water in the vast seas over which\r\nthe Arctic winter reigned. Ice-fields extended as far as the eye could\r\nreach, bristling with icebergs, and the _Forward_ was sheltered by\r\nthree of the highest on three points of the compass; the south-east\r\nwind alone could reach her. If instead of icebergs there had been\r\nrocks, verdure instead of snow, and the sea in its liquid state again,\r\nthe brig would have been safely anchored in a pretty bay sheltered\r\nfrom the worst winds. But in such a latitude it was a miserable state\r\nof things. They were obliged to fasten the brig by means of her anchors,\r\nnotwithstanding her immovability; they were obliged to prepare for\r\nthe submarine currents and the breaking up of the ice. When Johnson\r\nheard where they were, he took the greatest precautions in getting\r\neverything ready for wintering.\r\n\r\n\"It's the captain's usual luck,\" said he to the doctor; \"we've got\r\nnipped in the most disagreeable point of the whole glove! Never mind;\r\nwe'll get out of it!\"\r\n\r\nAs to the doctor, he was delighted at the situation. He would not\r\nhave changed it for any other! A winter at the Frozen Pole seemed\r\nto him desirable. The crew were set to work at the sails, which were\r\nnot taken down, and put into the hold, as the first people who wintered\r\nin these regions had thought prudent; they were folded up in their\r\ncases, and the ice soon made them an impervious envelope. The crow's\r\nnest, too, remained in its place, serving as a nautical observatory;\r\nthe rigging alone was taken away. It became necessary to cut away\r\nthe part of the field that surrounded the brig, which began to suffer\r\nfrom the pressure. It was a long and painful work. In a few days the\r\nkeel was cleared, and on examination was found to have suffered little,\r\nthanks to the solidity of its construction, only its copper plating\r\nwas almost all torn off. When the ship was once liberated she rose\r\nat least nine inches; the crew then bevelled the ice in the shape\r\nof the keel, and the field formed again under the brig, and offered\r\nsufficient opposition to pressure from without. The doctor helped\r\nin all this work; he used the ice-knife skilfully; he incited the\r\nsailors by his happy disposition. He instructed himself and others,\r\nand was delighted to find the ice under the ship.\r\n\r\n\"It's a very good precaution!\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"We couldn't do without it, Mr. Clawbonny,\" said Johnson. \"Now we\r\ncan raise a snow-wall as high as the gunwale, and if we like we can\r\nmake it ten feet thick, for we've plenty of materials.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's an excellent idea,\" answered the doctor. \"Snow is a bad\r\nconductor of heat; it reflects it instead of absorbing it, and the\r\nheat of the interior does not escape.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's true,\" said Johnson. \"We shall raise a fortification against\r\nthe cold, and against animals too, if they take it into their heads\r\nto pay us a visit; when the work is done it will answer, I can tell\r\nyou. We shall make two flights of steps in the snow, one from the\r\nship and the other from outside; when once we've cut out the steps\r\nwe shall pour water over them, and it will make them as hard as rock.\r\nWe shall have a royal staircase.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's a good thing that cold makes ice and snow, and so gives us the\r\nmeans of protecting ourselves against it. I don't know what we should\r\ndo if it did not.\"\r\n\r\nA roofing of tarred cloth was spread over the deck and descended to\r\nthe sides of the brig. It was thus sheltered from all outside\r\nimpression, and made a capital promenade; it was covered with two\r\nfeet and a-half of snow, which was beaten down till it became very\r\nhard, and above that they put a layer of sand, completely macadamising\r\nit.\r\n\r\n\"With a few trees I should imagine myself in Hyde Park,\" said the\r\ndoctor, \"or in one of the hanging gardens of Babylon.\"\r\n\r\nThey made a hole at a short distance from the brig; it was round,\r\nlike a well; they broke the ice every morning. This well was useful\r\nin case of fire or for the frequent baths ordered to keep the crew\r\nin health. In order to spare their fuel, they drew the water from\r\na greater depth by means of an apparatus invented by a Frenchman,\r\nFrancois Arago. Generally, when a ship is wintering, all the objects\r\nwhich encumber her are placed in magazines on the coast, but it was\r\nimpossible to do this in the midst of an ice-field. Every precaution\r\nwas taken against cold and damp; men have been known to resist the\r\ncold and succumb to damp; therefore both had to be guarded against.\r\nThe _Forward_ had been built expressly for these regions, and the\r\ncommon room was wisely arranged. They had made war on the corners,\r\nwhere damp takes refuge at first. If it had been quite circular it\r\nwould have done better, but warmed by a vast stove and well ventilated,\r\nit was very comfortable; the walls were lined with buckskins and not\r\nwith woollen materials, for wool condenses the vapours and\r\nimpregnates the atmosphere with damp. The partitions were taken down\r\nin the poop, and the officers had a large comfortable room, warmed\r\nby a stove. Both this room and that of the crew had a sort of antechamber,\r\nwhich prevented all direct communication with the exterior, and\r\nprevented the heat going out; it also made the crew pass more gradually\r\nfrom one temperature to another. They left their snow-covered\r\ngarments in these antechambers, and scraped their feet on scrapers\r\nput there on purpose to prevent any unhealthy element getting in.\r\n\r\nCanvas hose let in the air necessary to make the stoves draw; other\r\nhose served for escape-pipes for the steam. Two condensers were fixed\r\nin the two rooms; they gathered the vapour instead of letting it escape,\r\nand were emptied twice a week; sometimes they contained several\r\nbushels of ice. By means of the air-pipes the fires could be easily\r\nregulated, and it was found that very little fuel was necessary to\r\nkeep up a temperature of 50 degrees in the rooms. But Hatteras saw\r\nwith grief that he had only enough coal left for two months' firing.\r\nA drying-room was prepared for the garments that were obliged to be\r\nwashed, as they could not be hung in the air or they would have been\r\nfrozen and spoiled. The delicate parts of the machine were taken to\r\npieces carefully, and the room where they were placed was closed up\r\nhermetically. The rules for life on board were drawn up by Hatteras\r\nand hung up in the common room. The men got up at six in the morning,\r\nand their hammocks were exposed to the air three times a week; the\r\nfloors of the two rooms were rubbed with warm sand every morning;\r\nboiling tea was served out at every meal, and the food varied as much\r\nas possible, according to the different days of the week; it consisted\r\nof bread, flour, beef suet and raisins for puddings, sugar, cocoa,\r\ntea, rice, lemon-juice, preserved meat, salted beef and pork, pickled\r\ncabbage and other vegetables; the kitchen was outside the common rooms,\r\nand the men were thus deprived of its heat, but cooking is a constant\r\nsource of evaporation and humidity.\r\n\r\nThe health of men depends a great deal on the food they eat; under\r\nthese high latitudes it is of great importance to consume as much\r\nanimal food as possible. The doctor presided at the drawing up of\r\nthe bill of fare.\r\n\r\n\"We must take example from the Esquimaux,\" said he; \"they have\r\nreceived their lessons from nature, and are our teachers here;\r\nalthough Arabians and Africans can live on a few dates and a handful\r\nof rice, it is very different here, where we must eat a great deal\r\nand often. The Esquimaux absorb as much as ten and fifteen pounds\r\nof oil in a day. If you do not like oil, you must have recourse to\r\nthings rich in sugar and fat. In a word, you want carbon in the stove\r\ninside you as much as the stove there wants coal.\"\r\n\r\nEvery man was forced to take a bath in the half-frozen water condensed\r\nfrom the fire. The doctor set the example; he did it at first as we\r\ndo all disagreeable things that we feel obliged to do, but he soon\r\nbegan to take extreme pleasure in it. When the men had to go out either\r\nto hunt or work they had to take great care not to get frost-bitten;\r\nand if by accident it happened, they made haste to rub the part\r\nattacked with snow to bring back the circulation of the blood. Besides\r\nbeing carefully clothed in wool from head to foot, the men wore hoods\r\nof buckskin and sealskin trousers, through which it is impossible\r\nfor the wind to penetrate. All these preparations took about three\r\nweeks, and the 10th of October came round without anything remarkable\r\nhappening.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\nAN OLD FOX\r\n\r\n\r\nThat day the thermometer went down to 3 degrees below zero. The weather\r\nwas pretty calm, and the cold without breeze was bearable. Hatteras\r\nprofited by the clearness of the atmosphere to reconnoitre the\r\nsurrounding plains; he climbed one of the highest icebergs to the\r\nnorth, and could see nothing, as far as his telescope would let him,\r\nbut ice-fields and icebergs. No land anywhere, but the image of chaos\r\nin its saddest aspect. He came back on board trying to calculate the\r\nprobable duration of his captivity. The hunters, and amongst them\r\nthe doctor, James Wall, Simpson, Johnson, and Bell, did not fail to\r\nsupply the ship with fresh meat. Birds had disappeared; they were\r\ngone to less rigorous southern climates. The ptarmigans, a sort of\r\npartridge, alone stay the winter in these latitudes; they are easily\r\nkilled, and their great number promised an abundant supply of game.\r\nThere were plenty of hares, foxes, wolves, ermine, and bears; there\r\nwere enough for any sportsman, English, French, or Norwegian; but\r\nthey were difficult to get at, and difficult to distinguish on the\r\nwhite plains from the whiteness of their fur; when the intense cold\r\ncomes their fur changes colour, and white is their winter colour.\r\nThe doctor found that this change of fur is not caused by the change\r\nof temperature, for it takes place in the month of October, and is\r\nsimply a precaution of Providence to guard them from the rigour of\r\na boreal winter.\r\n\r\nSeals were abundant in all their varieties, and were particularly\r\nsought after by the hunters for the sake, not only of their skins,\r\nbut their fat, which is very warming; besides which, the liver of\r\nthese animals makes excellent fuel: hundreds of them were to be seen,\r\nand two or three miles to the north of the brig the ice was literally\r\nperforated all over with the holes these enormous amphibians make;\r\nonly they smelt the hunters from afar, and many were wounded that\r\nescaped by plunging under the ice. However, on the 19th, Simpson\r\nmanaged to catch one at about a hundred yards from the ship; he had\r\ntaken the precaution to block up its hole of refuge so that it was\r\nat the mercy of the hunters. It took several bullets to kill the animal,\r\nwhich measured nine feet in length; its bulldog head, the sixteen\r\nteeth in its jaws, its large pectoral fins in the shape of pinions,\r\nand its little tail, furnished with another pair of fins, made it\r\na good specimen of the family of dog-hound fish. The doctor, wishing\r\nto preserve the head for his natural history collection, and its skin\r\nfor his future use, had them prepared by a rapid and inexpensive\r\nprocess. He plunged the body of the animal into the hole in the ice,\r\nand thousands of little prawns soon ate off all the flesh; in half\r\na day the work was accomplished, and the most skilful of the honourable\r\ncorporation of Liverpool tanners could not have succeeded better.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the sun had passed the autumnal equinox--that is to say,\r\non the 23rd of September--winter may be said to begin in the Arctic\r\nregions. The sun disappears entirely on the 23rd of October, lighting\r\nup with its oblique rays the summits of the frozen mountains. The\r\ndoctor wished him a traveller's farewell; he was not going to see\r\nhim again till February. But obscurity is not complete during this\r\nlong absence of the sun; the moon comes each month to take its place\r\nas well as she can; starlight is very bright, and there is besides\r\nfrequent aurora borealis, and a refraction peculiar to the snowy\r\nhorizons; besides, the sun at the very moment of his greatest austral\r\ndeclination, the 21st of December, is still only 13 degrees from the\r\nPolar horizon, so that there is twilight for a few hours; only fogs,\r\nmists, and snowstorms often plunge these regions into complete\r\nobscurity. However, at this epoch the weather was pretty favourable;\r\nthe partridges and the hares were the only animals that had a right\r\nto complain, for the sportsmen did not give them a moment's peace;\r\nthey set several fox-traps, but the suspicious animals did not let\r\nthemselves be caught so easily; they would often come and eat the\r\nsnare by scratching out the snow from under the trap; the doctor wished\r\nthem at the devil, as he could not get them himself. On the 25th of\r\nOctober the thermometer marked more than 4 degrees below zero. A\r\nviolent tempest set in; the air was thick with snow, which prevented\r\na ray of light reaching the _Forward_. During several hours they were\r\nvery uneasy about Bell and Simpson, who had gone too far whilst\r\nhunting; they did not reach the ship till the next day, after having\r\nlain for a whole day in their buckskins, whilst the tempest swept\r\nthe air about them, and buried them under five feet of snow. They\r\nwere nearly frozen, and the doctor had some trouble to restore their\r\ncirculation.\r\n\r\nThe tempest lasted a week without interruption. It was impossible\r\nto stir out. In a single day the temperature varied fifteen and twenty\r\ndegrees. During their forced idleness each one lived to himself; some\r\nslept, others smoked, or talked in whispers, stopping when they saw\r\nthe doctor or Johnson approach; there was no moral union between the\r\nmen; they only met for evening prayers, and on Sunday for Divine\r\nservice. Clifton had counted that once the 78th parallel cleared,\r\nhis share in the bounty would amount to 375 pounds; he thought that\r\nenough, and his ambition did not go beyond. The others were of the\r\nsame opinion, and only thought of enjoying the fortune acquired at\r\nsuch a price. Hatteras was hardly ever seen. He neither took part\r\nin the hunting nor other excursions. He felt no interest in the\r\nmeteorological phenomena which excited the doctor's admiration. He\r\nlived for one idea; it was comprehended in three words--the North\r\nPole. He was constantly looking forward to the moment when the\r\n_Forward_, once more free, would begin her adventurous voyage again.\r\n\r\nIn short, it was a melancholy life; the brig, made for movement, seemed\r\nquite out of place as a stationary dwelling; her original form could\r\nnot be distinguished amidst the ice and snow that covered her, and\r\nshe was anything but a lively spectacle. During these unoccupied hours\r\nthe doctor put his travelling notes in order--the notes from which\r\nthis history is taken; he was never idle, and the evenness of his\r\nhumour remained the same, only he was very glad to see the tempest\r\nclearing off so as to allow him to set off hunting once more. On the\r\n3rd of November, at six in the morning, with a temperature at 5 degrees\r\nbelow zero, he started, accompanied by Johnson and Bell; the plains\r\nof ice were level; the snow, which covered the ground thickly,\r\nsolidified by the frost, made the ground good for walking; a dry and\r\nkeen cold lightened the atmosphere; the moon shone in all her\r\nsplendour, and threw an astonishing light on all the asperities of\r\nthe field; their footsteps left marks on the snow, and the moon lighted\r\nup their edges, so that they looked like a luminous track behind the\r\nhunters whose shadows fell on the ice with astonishing outlines.\r\n\r\nThe doctor had taken his friend Dick with him; he preferred him to\r\nthe Greenland dogs to run down the game for a good reason; the latter\r\ndo not seem to have the scent of their brethren of more temperate\r\nclimates. Dick ran on and often pointed out the track of a bear, but\r\nin spite of his skill the hunters had not even killed a hare after\r\ntwo hours' walking.\r\n\r\n\"Do you think the game has gone south too?\" asked the doctor, halting\r\nat the foot of a hummock.\r\n\r\n\"It looks like it, Mr. Clawbonny,\" answered the carpenter.\r\n\r\n\"I don't think so,\" answered Johnson; \"hares, foxes, and bears are\r\naccustomed to the climate; I believe the late tempest is the cause\r\nof their disappearance; but with the south winds they'll soon come\r\nback. Ah! if you said reindeers or musk-oxen it would be a different\r\nthing.\"\r\n\r\n\"But it appears those, too, are found in troops in Melville Island,\"\r\nreplied the doctor; \"that is much further south, I grant you; when\r\nParry wintered there he always had as much game as he wanted.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are not so well off,\" said Bell; \"if we could only get plenty\r\nof bear's flesh I should not complain.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bears are very difficult to get at,\" answered the doctor; \"it seems\r\nto me they want civilising.\"\r\n\r\n\"Bell talks about the bear's flesh, but we want its fat more than\r\nits flesh or its skin,\" said Johnson.\r\n\r\n\"You are right, Johnson; you are always thinking about the fuel.\"\r\n\r\n\"How can I help thinking about it? I know if we are ever so careful\r\nof it we've only enough left for three weeks.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" replied the doctor, \"that is our greatest danger, for we are\r\nonly at the beginning of November, and February is the coldest month\r\nof the year in the Frozen Zone; however, if we can't get bear's grease\r\nwe can rely on that of the seals.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not for long, Mr. Clawbonny,\" answered Johnson. \"They'll soon desert\r\nus too; either through cold or fright, they'll soon leave off coming\r\non to the surface of the ice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we must get at the bears,\" said the doctor; \"they are the most\r\nuseful animals in these countries: they furnish food, clothes, light,\r\nand fuel. Do you hear, Dick?\" continued he, caressing his friend;\r\n\"we must have a bear, so look out.\"\r\n\r\nDick, who was smelling the ice as the doctor spoke, started off all\r\nat once, quick as an arrow. He barked loudly, and, notwithstanding\r\nhis distance, the sportsmen heard him distinctly. The extreme\r\ndistance to which sound is carried in these low temperatures is\r\nastonishing; it is only equalled by the brilliancy of the\r\nconstellations in the boreal sky.\r\n\r\nThe sportsmen, guided by Dick's barking, rushed on his traces; they\r\nhad to run about a mile, and arrived quite out of breath, for the\r\nlungs are rapidly suffocated in such an atmosphere. Dick was pointing\r\nat about fifty paces from an enormous mass at the top of a mound of\r\nice.\r\n\r\n\"We've got him,\" said the doctor, taking aim.\r\n\r\n\"And a fine one,\" added Bell, imitating the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"It's a queer bear,\" said Johnson, waiting to fire after his two\r\ncompanions.\r\n\r\nDick barked furiously. Bell advanced to within twenty feet and fired,\r\nbut the animal did not seem to be touched. Johnson advanced in his\r\nturn, and after taking a careful aim, pulled the trigger.\r\n\r\n\"What,\" cried the doctor, \"not touched yet? Why, it's that cursed\r\nrefraction. The bear is at least a thousand paces off.\"\r\n\r\nThe three sportsmen ran rapidly towards the animal, whom the firing\r\nhad not disturbed; he seemed to be enormous, and without calculating\r\nthe dangers of the attack, they began to rejoice in their conquest.\r\nArrived within reasonable distance they fired again; the bear,\r\nmortally wounded, gave a great jump and fell at the foot of the mound.\r\nDick threw himself upon it.\r\n\r\n\"That bear wasn't difficult to kill,\" said the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"Only three shots,\" added Bell in a tone of disdain, \"and he's down.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's very singular,\" said Johnson.\r\n\r\n\"Unless we arrived at the very moment when it was dying of old age,\"\r\nsaid the doctor, laughing.\r\n\r\nSo speaking, the sportsmen reached the foot of the mound, and, to\r\ntheir great stupefaction, they found Dick with his fangs in the body\r\nof a white fox.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I never!\" cried Bell.\r\n\r\n\"We kill a bear and a fox falls,\" added the doctor.\r\n\r\nJohnson did not know what to say.\r\n\r\n\"Why!\" said the doctor, with a roar of laughter, \"it's the refraction\r\nagain!\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, Mr. Clawbonny?\" asked the carpenter.\r\n\r\n\"Why, it deceived us about the size as it did about the distance.\r\nIt made us see a bear in a fox's skin.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" answered Johnson, \"now we've got him, we'll eat him.\"\r\n\r\nJohnson was going to lift the fox on to his shoulders, when he cried\r\nlike Bell--\"Well, I never!\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" asked the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"Look, Mr. Clawbonny--look what the animal's got on its neck; it's\r\na collar, sure enough.\"\r\n\r\n\"A collar?\" echoed the doctor, leaning over the animal. A half\r\nworn-out collar encircled the fox's neck, and the doctor thought he\r\nsaw something engraved on it; he took it off and examined it.\r\n\r\n\"That bear is more than twelve years old, my friends,\" said the doctor;\r\n\"it's one of James Ross's foxes, and the collar has been round its\r\nneck ever since 1848.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is it possible?\" cried Bell.\r\n\r\n\"There isn't a doubt about it, and I'm sorry we've shot the poor animal.\r\nDuring his wintering James Ross took a lot of white foxes in his traps,\r\nand had brass collars put round their necks on which were engraved\r\nthe whereabouts of his ships, the _Enterprise_ and the _Investigator_,\r\nand the store magazines. He hoped one of them might fall into the\r\nhands of some of the men belonging to Franklin's expedition. The poor\r\nanimal might have saved the lives of the ship's crews, and it has\r\nfallen under our balls.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, we won't eat him,\" said Johnson, \"especially as he's twelve\r\nyears old. Anyway, we'll keep his skin for curiosity sake.\" So saying\r\nhe lifted the animal on his shoulders, and they made their way to\r\nthe ship, guided by the stars; still their expedition was not quite\r\nfruitless: they bagged several brace of ptarmigans. An hour before\r\nthey reached the _Forward_, a phenomenon occurred which excited the\r\nastonishment of the doctor; it was a very rain of shooting stars;\r\nthey could be counted by thousands, like rockets in a display of\r\nfireworks. They paled the light of the moon, and the admirable\r\nspectacle lasted several hours. A like meteor was observed at\r\nGreenland by the Moravian brothers in 1799. The doctor passed the\r\nwhole night watching it, till it ceased, at seven in the morning,\r\namidst the profound silence of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\nTHE LAST LUMP OF COAL\r\n\r\n\r\nIt seemed certain that no bears were to be had; several seals were\r\nkilled during the days of the 4th, 5th, and 6th of November; then\r\nthe wind changed, and the thermometer went up several degrees; but\r\nthe snow-drifts began again with great violence. It became impossible\r\nto leave the vessel, and the greatest precaution was needed to keep\r\nout the damp. At the end of the week there were several bushels of\r\nice in the condensers. The weather changed again on the 15th of\r\nNovember, and the thermometer, under the influence of certain\r\natmospherical conditions, went down to 24 degrees below zero. It was\r\nthe lowest temperature observed up till then. This cold would have\r\nbeen bearable in a quiet atmosphere, but there was a strong wind which\r\nseemed to fill the atmosphere with sharp blades. The doctor was vexed\r\nat being kept prisoner, for the ground was covered with snow, made\r\nhard by the wind, and was easy to walk upon; he wanted to attempt\r\nsome long excursion.\r\n\r\nIt is very difficult to work when it is so cold, because of the\r\nshortness of breath it causes. A man can only do a quarter of his\r\naccustomed work; iron implements become impossible to touch; if one\r\nis taken up without precaution, it causes a pain as bad as a burn,\r\nand pieces of skin are left on it. The crew, confined to the ship,\r\nwere obliged to walk for two hours on the covered deck, where they\r\nwere allowed to smoke, which was not allowed in the common room. There,\r\ndirectly the fire got low, the ice invaded the walls and the joins\r\nin the flooring; every bolt, nail, or metal plate became immediately\r\ncovered with a layer of ice. The doctor was amazed at the instantaneity\r\nof the phenomenon. The breath of the men condensed in the air, and\r\npassing quickly from a fluid to a solid state, fell round them in\r\nsnow. At a few feet only from the stoves the cold was intense, and\r\nthe men stood near the fire in a compact group. The doctor advised\r\nthem to accustom their skin to the temperature, which would certainly\r\nget worse, and he himself set the example; but most of them were too\r\nidle or too benumbed to follow his advice, and preferred remaining\r\nin the unhealthy heat. However, according to the doctor, there was\r\nno danger in the abrupt changes of temperature in going from the warm\r\nroom into the cold. It is only dangerous for people in perspiration;\r\nbut the doctor's lessons were thrown away on the greater part of the\r\ncrew.\r\n\r\nAs to Hatteras, he did not seem to feel the influence of the\r\ntemperature. He walked silently about at his ordinary pace. Had the\r\ncold no empire over his strong constitution, or did he possess in\r\na supreme degree the natural heat he wished his sailors to have? Was\r\nhe so armed in his one idea as to be insensible to exterior\r\nimpressions? His men were profoundly astonished at seeing him facing\r\nthe 24 degrees below zero; he left the ship for hours, and came back\r\nwithout his face betraying the slightest mark of cold.\r\n\r\n\"He is a strange man,\" said the doctor to Johnson; \"he even astonishes\r\nme. He is one of the most powerful natures I have ever studied in\r\nmy life.\"\r\n\r\n\"The fact is,\" answered Johnson, \"that he comes and goes in the open\r\nair without clothing himself more warmly than in the month of June.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh! the question of clothes is not of much consequence,\" replied\r\nthe doctor; \"it is of no use clothing people who do not produce heat\r\nnaturally. It is the same as if we tried to warm a piece of ice by\r\nwrapping it up in a blanket! Hatteras does not want that; he is\r\nconstituted so, and I should not be surprised if being by his side\r\nwere as good as being beside a stove.\"\r\n\r\nJohnson had the job of clearing the water-hole the next day, and\r\nremarked that the ice was more than ten feet thick. The doctor could\r\nobserve magnificent aurora borealis almost every night; from four\r\ntill eight p.m. the sky became slightly coloured in the north; then\r\nthis colouring took the regular form of a pale yellow border, whose\r\nextremities seemed to buttress on to the ice-field. Little by little\r\nthe brilliant zone rose in the sky, following the magnetic meridian,\r\nand appeared striated with blackish bands; jets of some luminous\r\nmatter, augmenting and diminishing, shot out lengthways; the meteor,\r\narrived at its zenith, was often composed of several bows, bathed\r\nin floods of red, yellow, or green light. It was a dazzling spectacle.\r\nSoon the different curves all joined in one point, and formed boreal\r\ncrowns of a heavenly richness. At last the bows joined, the splendid\r\naurora faded, the intense rays melted into pale, vague, undetermined\r\nshades, and the marvellous phenomenon, feeble, and almost\r\nextinguished, fainted insensibly into the dark southern clouds.\r\nNothing can equal the wonders of such a spectacle under the high\r\nlatitudes less than eight degrees from the Pole; the aurora borealis\r\nperceived in temperate regions gives no idea of them--not even a\r\nfeeble one; it seems as if Providence wished to reserve its most\r\nastonishing marvels for these climates.\r\n\r\nDuring the duration of the moon several images of her are seen in\r\nthe sky, increasing her brilliancy; often simple lunar halos surround\r\nher, and she shines from the centre of her luminous circle with a\r\nsplendid intensity.\r\n\r\nOn the 26th of November there was a high tide, and the water escaped\r\nwith violence from the water-hole; the thick layer of ice was shaken\r\nby the rising of the sea, and sinister crackings announced the\r\nsubmarine struggle; happily the ship kept firm in her bed, and her\r\nchains only were disturbed. Hatteras had had them fastened in\r\nanticipation of the event. The following days were still colder; there\r\nwas a penetrating fog, and the wind scattered the piled-up snow; it\r\nbecame difficult to see whether the whirlwinds began in the air or\r\non the ice-fields; confusion reigned.\r\n\r\nThe crew were occupied in different works on board, the principal\r\nof which consisted in preparing the grease and oil produced by the\r\nseals; they had become blocks of ice, which had to be broken with\r\naxes into little bits, and ten barrels were thus preserved.\r\n\r\nAll sorts of vessels were useless, and the liquid they contained would\r\nonly have broken them when the temperature changed. On the 28th the\r\nthermometer went down to 32 degrees below zero; there was only coal\r\nenough left for ten days, and everyone looked forward to its\r\ndisappearance with dread. Hatteras had the poop stove put out for\r\neconomy's sake, and from that time Shandon, the doctor, and he stayed\r\nin the common room. Hatteras was thus brought into closer contact\r\nwith the men, who threw ferocious and stupefied looks at him. He heard\r\ntheir reproaches, their recriminations, and even their threats, and\r\nhe could not punish them. But he seemed to be deaf to everything.\r\nHe did not claim the place nearest the fire, but stopped in a corner,\r\nhis arms folded, never speaking.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the doctor's recommendations, Pen and his friends refused\r\nto take the least exercise; they passed whole days leaning against\r\nthe stove or lying under the blankets of their hammocks. Their health\r\nsoon began to suffer; they could not bear up against the fatal\r\ninfluence of the climate, and the terrible scurvy made its appearance\r\non board. The doctor had, however, begun, some time ago, to distribute\r\nlimejuice and lime pastilles every morning; but these preservatives,\r\ngenerally so efficacious, had very little effect on the malady, which\r\nsoon presented the most horrible symptoms. The sight of the poor\r\nfellows, whose nerves and muscles contracted with pain, was pitiable.\r\nTheir legs swelled in an extraordinary fashion, and were covered with\r\nlarge blackish blue spots; their bloody gums and ulcerated lips only\r\ngave passage to inarticulate sounds; the vitiated blood no longer\r\nwent to the extremities.\r\n\r\nClifton was the first attacked; then Gripper, Brunton, and Strong\r\ntook to their hammocks. Those that the malady still spared could not\r\nlose sight of their sufferings; they were obliged to stay there, and\r\nit was soon transformed into a hospital, for out of eighteen sailors\r\nof the _Forward_, thirteen were attacked in a few days. Pen seemed\r\ndestined to escape contagion; his vigorous nature preserved him from\r\nit. Shandon felt the first symptoms, but they did not go further,\r\nand exercise kept the two in pretty good health.\r\n\r\nThe doctor nursed the invalids with the greatest care, and it made\r\nhim miserable to see the sufferings he could not alleviate. He did\r\nall he could to keep his companions in good spirits; he talked to\r\nthem, read to them, and told them tales, which his astonishing memory\r\nmade it easy for him to do. He was often interrupted by the complaints\r\nand groans of the invalids, and he stopped his talk to become once\r\nmore the attentive and devoted doctor. His health kept up well; he\r\ndid not get thinner, and he used to say that it was a good thing for\r\nhim that he was dressed like a seal or a whale, who, thanks to its\r\nthick layer of fat, easily supports the Arctic atmosphere. Hatteras\r\nfelt nothing, either physically or morally. Even the sufferings of\r\nhis crew did not seem to touch him. Perhaps it was because he would\r\nnot let his face betray his emotions; but an attentive observer would\r\nhave remarked that a man's heart beat beneath the iron envelope. The\r\ndoctor analysed him, studied him, but did not succeed in classifying\r\nso strange an organisation, a temperament so supernatural. The\r\nthermometer lowered again; the walk on deck was deserted; the\r\nEsquimaux dogs alone frequented it, howling lamentably.\r\n\r\nThere was always one man on guard near the stove to keep up the fire;\r\nit was important not to let it go out. As soon as the fire got lower,\r\nthe cold glided into the room; ice covered the walls, and the humidity,\r\nrapidly condensed, fell in snow on the unfortunate inhabitants of\r\nthe brig. It was in the midst of these unutterable tortures that the\r\n8th of December was reached. That morning the doctor went as usual\r\nto consult the exterior thermometer. He found the mercury completely\r\nfrozen.\r\n\r\n\"Forty-four degrees below zero!\" he cried with terror. And that day\r\nthey threw the last lump of coal into the stove.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII\r\n\r\nCHRISTMAS\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was then a movement of despair. The thought of death, and death\r\nfrom cold, appeared in all its horror; the last piece of coal burnt\r\naway as quickly as the rest, and the temperature of the room lowered\r\nsensibly. But Johnson went to fetch some lumps of the new fuel which\r\nthe marine animals had furnished him with, and he stuffed it into\r\nthe stove; he added some oakum, impregnated with frozen oil, and soon\r\nobtained enough heat. The smell of the grease was abominable, but\r\nhow could they get rid of it? They were obliged to get used to it.\r\nJohnson agreed that his expedient left much to wish for, and would\r\nhave no success in a Liverpool house.\r\n\r\n\"However,\" added he, \"the smell may have one good result.\"\r\n\r\n\"What's that?\" asked the carpenter.\r\n\r\n\"It will attract the bears; they are very fond of the stink.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what do we want with bears?\" added Bell.\r\n\r\n\"You know, Bell, we can't depend on the seals; they've disappeared\r\nfor a good while to come; if the bears don't come to be turned into\r\nfuel too, I don't know what will become of us.\"\r\n\r\n\"There would be only one thing left; but I don't see how----\"\r\n\r\n\"The captain would never consent; but perhaps we shall be obliged.\"\r\n\r\nJohnson shook his head sadly, and fell into a silent reverie, which\r\nBell did not interrupt. He knew that their stock of grease would not\r\nlast more than a week with the strictest economy.\r\n\r\nThe boatswain was not mistaken. Several bears, attracted by the fetid\r\nexhalations, were signalled to the windward; the healthy men gave\r\nchase to them, but they are extraordinarily quick, and did not allow\r\nthemselves to be approached, and the most skilful shots could not\r\ntouch them. The ship's crew was seriously menaced with death from\r\ncold; it was impossible to resist such a temperature more than\r\nforty-eight hours, and every one feared the end of the fuel. The\r\ndreaded moment arrived at three o'clock p.m. on the 20th of December.\r\nThe fire went out; the sailors looked at each other with haggard eyes.\r\nHatteras remained immovable in his corner. The doctor as usual marched\r\nup and down in agitation; he was at his wits' end. The temperature\r\nof the room fell suddenly to 7 degrees below zero. But if the doctor\r\ndid not know what to do, some of the others did. Shandon, calm and\r\nresolute, and Pen with anger in his eyes, and two or three of their\r\ncomrades, who could still walk, went up to Hatteras.\r\n\r\n\"Captain!\" said Shandon.\r\n\r\nHatteras, absorbed in thought, did not hear him.\r\n\r\n\"Captain!\" repeated Shandon, touching his hand.\r\n\r\nHatteras drew himself up.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" he said.\r\n\r\n\"Our fire is out!\"\r\n\r\n\"What then?\" answered Hatteras.\r\n\r\n\"If you mean to kill us with cold, you had better say so,\" said Shandon\r\nironically.\r\n\r\n\"I mean,\" said Hatteras gravely, \"to require every man to do his duty\r\nto the end.\"\r\n\r\n\"There's something higher than duty, captain--there's the right to\r\none's own preservation. I repeat that the fire is out, and if it is\r\nnot relighted, not one of us will be alive in two days.\"\r\n\r\n\"I have no fuel,\" answered Hatteras, with a hollow voice.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" cried Pen violently, \"if you have no fuel, we must take\r\nit where we can!\"\r\n\r\nHatteras grew pale with anger.\r\n\r\n\"Where?\" said he.\r\n\r\n\"On board,\" answered the sailor insolently.\r\n\r\n\"On board!\" echoed the captain, his fists closed, his eyes sparkling.\r\n\r\nHe had seized an axe, and he now raised it over Pen's head.\r\n\r\n\"Wretch!\" he cried.\r\n\r\nThe doctor rushed between the captain and Pen; the axe fell to the\r\nground, its sharp edge sinking into the flooring. Johnson, Bell, and\r\nSimpson were grouped round Hatteras, and appeared determined to give\r\nhim their support. But lamentable and plaintive voices came from the\r\nbeds.\r\n\r\n\"Some fire! Give us some fire!\" cried the poor fellows.\r\n\r\nHatteras made an effort, and said calmly:\r\n\r\n\"If we destroy the brig, how shall we get back to England?\"\r\n\r\n\"We might burn some of the rigging and the gunwale, sir,\" said Johnson.\r\n\r\n\"Besides, we should still have the boats left,\" answered Shandon;\r\n\"and we could build a smaller vessel with the remains of the old one!\"\r\n\r\n\"Never!\" answered Hatteras.\r\n\r\n\"But----\" began several sailors, raising their voices.\r\n\r\n\"We have a great quantity of spirits of wine,\" answered Hatteras;\r\n\"burn that to the last drop.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ah, we didn't think of that!\" said Johnson, with affected\r\ncheerfulness, and by the help of large wicks steeped in spirits he\r\nsucceeded in raising the temperature a few degrees.\r\n\r\nDuring the days that followed this melancholy scene the wind went\r\nround to the south, and the thermometer went up. Some of the men could\r\nleave the vessel during the least damp part of the day; but ophthalmia\r\nand scurvy kept the greater number on board; besides, neither fishing\r\nnor hunting was practicable. But it was only a short respite from\r\nthe dreadful cold, and on the 25th, after an unexpected change in\r\nthe wind, the mercury again froze; they were then obliged to have\r\nrecourse to the spirits of wine thermometer, which never freezes.\r\nThe doctor found, to his horror, that it marked 66 degrees below zero;\r\nmen had never been able to support such a temperature. The ice spread\r\nitself in long tarnished mirrors on the floor; a thick fog invaded\r\nthe common room; the damp fell in thick snow; they could no longer\r\nsee one another; the extremities became blue as the heat of the body\r\nleft them; a circle of iron seemed to be clasping their heads, and\r\nmade them nearly delirious. A still more fearful symptom was that\r\ntheir tongues could no longer articulate a word.\r\n\r\nFrom the day they had threatened to burn his ship, Hatteras paced\r\nthe deck for hours. He was guarding his treasures; the wood of the\r\nship was his own flesh, and whoever cut a piece off cut off one of\r\nhis limbs. He was armed, and mounted guard, insensible to the cold,\r\nthe snow, and the ice, which stiffened his garments and enveloped\r\nhim in granite armour. His faithful Dick accompanied him, and seemed\r\nto understand why he was there.\r\n\r\nHowever, on Christmas Day he went down to the common room. The doctor,\r\ntaking advantage of what energy he had left, went straight to him,\r\nand said--\r\n\r\n\"Hatteras, we shall all die if we get no fuel.\"\r\n\r\n\"Never!\" said Hatteras, knowing what was coming.\r\n\r\n\"We must,\" said the doctor gently.\r\n\r\n\"Never!\" repeated Hatteras with more emphasis still. \"I will never\r\nconsent! They can disobey me if they like!\"\r\n\r\nJohnson and Bell took advantage of the half-permission, and rushed\r\non deck. Hatteras heard the wood crack under the axe. He wept. What\r\na Christmas Day for Englishmen was that on board the _Forward_! The\r\nthought of the great difference between their position and that of\r\nthe happy English families who rejoiced in their roast beef, plum\r\npudding, and mince pies added another pang to the miseries of the\r\nunfortunate crew. However, the fire put a little hope and confidence\r\ninto the men; the boiling of coffee and tea did them good, and the\r\nnext week passed less miserably, ending the dreadful year 1860; its\r\nearly winter had defeated all Hatteras's plans.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of January, 1861, the doctor made a discovery. It was not\r\nquite so cold, and he had resumed his interrupted studies; he was\r\nreading Sir Edward Belcher's account of his expedition to the Polar\r\nSeas; all at once a passage struck him; he read it again and again.\r\nIt was where Sir Edward Belcher relates that after reaching the\r\nextremity of Queen's Channel he had discovered important traces of\r\nthe passage and residence of men. \"They were,\" said he, \"very superior\r\nhabitations to those which might be attributed to the wandering\r\nEsquimaux. The walls had foundations, the floors of the interior had\r\nbeen covered with a thick layer of fine gravel, and were paved.\r\nReindeer, seal, and walrus bones were seen in great quantities. _We\r\nfound some coal._\" At the last words the doctor was struck with an\r\nidea; he carried the book to Hatteras and showed him the passage.\r\n\r\n\"They could not have found coal on this deserted coast,\" said\r\nHatteras; \"it is not possible!\"\r\n\r\n\"Why should we doubt what Belcher says? He would not have recorded\r\nsuch a fact unless he had been certain and had seen it with his own\r\neyes.\"\r\n\r\n\"And what then, doctor?\"\r\n\r\n\"We aren't a hundred miles from the coast where Belcher saw the coal,\r\nand what is a hundred miles' excursion? Nothing. Longer ones than\r\nthat have often been made across the ice.\"\r\n\r\n\"We will go,\" said Hatteras.\r\n\r\nJohnson was immediately told of their resolution, of which he strongly\r\napproved; he told his companions about it: some were glad, others\r\nindifferent.\r\n\r\n\"Coal on these coasts!\" said Wall, stretched on his bed of pain.\r\n\r\n\"Let them go,\" answered Shandon mysteriously.\r\n\r\nBut before Hatteras began his preparations for the journey, he wished\r\nto be exactly certain of the _Forward's_ position. He was obliged\r\nto be mathematically accurate as to her whereabouts, because of\r\nfinding her again. His task was very difficult; he went upon deck\r\nand took at different moments several lunar distances and the meridian\r\nheights of the principal stars. These observations were hard to make,\r\nfor the glass and mirrors of the instrument were covered with ice\r\nfrom Hatteras's breath; he burnt his eyelashes more than once by\r\ntouching the brass of the glasses. However, he obtained exact bases\r\nfor his calculations, and came down to make them in the room. When\r\nhis work was over, he raised his head in astonishment, took his map,\r\npricked it, and looked at the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" asked the latter.\r\n\r\n\"In what latitude were we at the beginning of our wintering?\"\r\n\r\n\"We were in latitude 78 degrees 15 minutes, by longitude 95 degrees\r\n35 minutes; exactly at the Frozen Pole.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well,\" said Hatteras, in a low tone, \"our ice-field has been\r\ndrifting! We are two degrees farther north and farther west, and three\r\nhundred miles at least from your store of coal!\"\r\n\r\n\"And those poor fellows don't know,\" said the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"Hush!\" said Hatteras, putting his finger on his lips.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII\r\n\r\nPREPARATIONS FOR DEPARTURE\r\n\r\n\r\nHatteras would not inform his crew of their situation, for if they\r\nhad known that they had been dragged farther north they would very\r\nlikely have given themselves up to the madness of despair. The captain\r\nhad hidden his own emotions at his discovery. It was his first happy\r\nmoment during the long months passed in struggling with the elements.\r\nHe was a hundred and fifty miles farther north, scarcely eight degrees\r\nfrom the Pole! But he hid his delight so profoundly that even the\r\ndoctor did not suspect it; he wondered at seeing an unwonted\r\nbrilliancy in the captain's eyes; but that was all, and he never once\r\nthought of the reason.\r\n\r\nThe _Forward_, by getting nearer the Pole, had got farther away from\r\nthe coal repository observed by Sir Edward Belcher; instead of one\r\nhundred, it lay at two hundred and fifty miles farther south. However,\r\nafter a short discussion about it between Hatteras and Clawbonny,\r\nthe journey was persisted in. If Belcher had written the truth--and\r\nthere was no reason for doubting his veracity--they should find things\r\nexactly in the same state as he had left them, for no new expedition\r\nhad gone to these extreme continents since 1853. There were few or\r\nno Esquimaux to be met with in that latitude. They could not be\r\ndisappointed on the coast of New Cornwall as they had been on Beechey\r\nIsland. The low temperature preserves the objects abandoned to its\r\ninfluence for any length of time. All probabilities were therefore\r\nin favour of this excursion across the ice. It was calculated that\r\nthe expedition would take, at the most, forty days, and Johnson's\r\npreparations were made in consequence.\r\n\r\nThe sledge was his first care; it was in the Greenland style,\r\nthirty-five inches wide and twenty-four feet long. The Esquimaux\r\noften make them more than fifty feet long. This one was made of long\r\nplanks, bent up front and back, and kept bent like a bow by two thick\r\ncords; the form thus given to it gave it increased resistance to\r\nshocks; it ran easily on the ice, but when the snow was soft on the\r\nground it was put upon a frame; to make it glide more easily it was\r\nrubbed, Esquimaux fashion, with sulphur and snow. Six dogs drew it;\r\nnotwithstanding their leanness these animals did not appear to suffer\r\nfrom the cold; their buckskin harness was in good condition, and they\r\ncould draw a weight of two thousand pounds without fatigue. The\r\nmaterials for encampment consisted of a tent, should the construction\r\nof a snow-house be impossible, a large piece of mackintosh to spread\r\nover the snow, to prevent it melting in contact with the human body,\r\nand lastly, several blankets and buffalo-skins. They took the halkett\r\nboat too.\r\n\r\nThe provisions consisted of five cases of pemmican, weighing about\r\nfour hundred and fifty pounds; they counted one pound of pemmican\r\nfor each man and each dog; there were seven dogs including Dick, and\r\nfour men. They also took twelve gallons of spirits of wine--that is\r\nto say, about one hundred fifty pounds weight--a sufficient quantity\r\nof tea and biscuit, a portable kitchen with plenty of wicks, oakum,\r\npowder, ammunition, and two double-barrelled guns. They also used\r\nCaptain Parry's invention of indiarubber belts, in which the warmth\r\nof the body and the movement of walking keeps coffee, tea, and water\r\nin a liquid state. Johnson was very careful about the snow-shoes;\r\nthey are a sort of wooden patten, fastened on with leather straps;\r\nwhen the ground was quite hard and frozen they could be replaced by\r\nbuckskin moccasins; each traveller had two pairs of both.\r\n\r\nThese preparations were important, for any detail omitted might\r\noccasion the loss of an expedition; they took four whole days. Each\r\nday at noon Hatteras took care to set the position of his ship; they\r\nhad ceased to drift; he was obliged to be certain in order to get\r\nback. He next set about choosing the men he should take with him;\r\nsome of them were not fit either to take or leave, but the captain\r\ndecided to take none but sure companions, as the common safety\r\ndepended upon the success of the excursion. Shandon was, therefore,\r\nexcluded, which he did not seem to regret. James Wall was ill in bed.\r\nThe state of the sick got no worse, however, and as the only thing\r\nto do for them was to rub them with lime-juice, and give them doses\r\nof it, the doctor was not obliged to stop, and he made one of the\r\ntravellers. Johnson very much wished to accompany the captain in his\r\nperilous enterprise, but Hatteras took him aside, and said, in an\r\naffectionate tone:\r\n\r\n\"Johnson, I have confidence in you alone. You are the only officer\r\nin whose hands I can leave my ship. I must know that you are there\r\nto overlook Shandon and the others. They are kept prisoners here by\r\nthe winter, but I believe them capable of anything. You will be\r\nfurnished with my formal instructions, which, in case of need, will\r\ngive you the command. You will take my place entirely. Our absence\r\nwill last four or five weeks at the most. I shall not be anxious,\r\nknowing you are where I cannot be. You must have wood, Johnson, I\r\nknow, but, as far as possible, spare my poor ship. Do you understand\r\nme, Johnson?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir,\" answered the old sailor, \"I'll stop if you wish.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" said Hatteras, shaking his boatswain's hand; \"and if\r\nwe don't come back, wait for the next breaking-up time, and try to\r\npush forward towards the Pole. But if the others won't go, don't mind\r\nus, and take the _Forward_ back to England.\"\r\n\r\n\"Are those your last commands, captain?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, my express commands,\" answered Hatteras.\r\n\r\n\"Very well, sir, they shall be carried out,\" said Johnson simply.\r\n\r\nThe doctor regretted his friend, but he thought Hatteras had acted\r\nwisely in leaving him. Their other two travelling companions were\r\nBell the carpenter and Simpson. The former was in good health, brave\r\nand devoted, and was the right man to render service during the\r\nencampments on the snow; Simpson was not so sure, but he accepted\r\na share in the expedition, and his hunting and fishing capabilities\r\nmight be of the greatest use. The expedition consisted, therefore,\r\nof four men, Hatteras, Clawbonny, Bell, and Simpson, and seven dogs.\r\nThe provisions had been calculated in consequence. During the first\r\ndays of January the temperature kept at an average of 33 degrees below\r\nzero. Hatteras was very anxious for the weather to change; he often\r\nconsulted the barometer, but it is of little use in such high latitudes.\r\nA clear sky in these regions does not always bring cold, and the snow\r\ndoes not make the temperature rise; the barometer is uncertain; it\r\ngoes down with the north and east winds; low, it brought fine weather;\r\nhigh, snow or rain. Its indications could not, therefore, be relied\r\nupon.\r\n\r\nAt last, on January 5th, the mercury rose to 18 degrees below zero,\r\nand Hatteras resolved to start the next day; he could not bear to\r\nsee his ship burnt piece by piece before his eyes; all the poop had\r\ngone into the stove. On the 6th, then, in the midst of whirlwinds\r\nof snow, the order for departure was given. The doctor gave his last\r\norders about the sick; Bell and Simpson shook hands silently with\r\ntheir companions. Hatteras wished to say his good-byes aloud, but\r\nhe saw himself surrounded by evil looks and thought he saw Shandon\r\nsmile ironically. He was silent, and perhaps hesitated for an instant\r\nabout leaving the _Forward_, but it was too late to turn back; the\r\nloaded sledge, with the dogs harnessed to it, awaited him on the\r\nice-field. Bell started the first; the others followed.\r\n\r\nJohnson accompanied the travellers for a quarter of a mile, then\r\nHatteras begged him to return on board, and the old sailor went back\r\nafter making a long farewell gesture. At that moment Hatteras turned\r\na last look towards the brig, and saw the extremity of her masts\r\ndisappear in the dark clouds of the sky.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX\r\n\r\nACROSS THE ICE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe little troop descended towards the south-east. Simpson drove the\r\nsledge. Dick helped him with zeal, and did not seem astonished at\r\nthe new occupation of his companions. Hatteras and the doctor walked\r\nbehind, whilst Bell went on in front, sounding the ice with his\r\niron-tipped stick. The rising of the thermometer indicated\r\napproaching snow; it soon fell in thick flakes, and made the journey\r\ndifficult for the travellers; it made them deviate from the straight\r\nline, and obliged them to walk slower; but, on an average, they made\r\nthree miles an hour. The surface of the ice was unequal, and the sledge\r\nwas often in danger of being overturned, but by great care it was\r\nkept upright.\r\n\r\nHatteras and his companions were clothed in skins more useful than\r\nelegant. Their heads and faces were covered with hoods, their mouths,\r\neyes, and noses alone coming into contact with the air. If they had\r\nnot been exposed the breath would have frozen their coverings, and\r\nthey would have been obliged to take them off with the help of an\r\naxe--an awkward way of undressing. The interminable plain kept on\r\nwith fatiguing monotony; icebergs of uniform aspect and hummocks\r\nwhose irregularity ended by seeming always the same; blocks cast in\r\nthe same mould, and icebergs between which tortuous valleys wound.\r\nThe travellers spoke little, and marched on, compass in hand. It is\r\npainful to open one's mouth in such an atmosphere; sharp icicles form\r\nimmediately between one's lips, and the breath is not warm enough\r\nto melt them. Bell's steps were marked in the soft ground, and they\r\nfollowed them attentively, certain of being able to go where he had\r\nbeen before.\r\n\r\nNumerous traces of bears and foxes crossed their path, but not an\r\nanimal was seen that day. It would have been dangerous and useless\r\nto hunt them, as the sledge was sufficiently freighted. Generally\r\nin this sort of excursion travellers leave provision-stores along\r\ntheir route; they place them in hiding-places of snow, out of reach\r\nof animals; unload during the journey, and take up the provisions\r\non their return. But Hatteras could not venture to do this on moveable\r\nice-fields, and the uncertainty of the route made the return the same\r\nway exceedingly problematic. At noon Hatteras caused his little troop\r\nto halt under shelter of an ice-wall. Their breakfast consisted of\r\npemmican and boiling tea; the latter beverage comforted the cold\r\nwayfarers. They set out again after an hour's rest. The first day\r\nthey walked about twenty miles, and in the evening both men and dogs\r\nwere exhausted. However, notwithstanding their fatigue, they were\r\nobliged to construct a snow-house in which to pass the night. It took\r\nabout an hour and a half to build. Bell showed himself very skilful.\r\nThe ice-blocks were cut out and placed above one another in the form\r\nof a dome; a large block at the top made the vault. Snow served for\r\nmortar and filled up the chinks. It soon hardened and made a single\r\nblock of the entire structure. It was reached by a narrow opening,\r\nthrough which the doctor squeezed himself painfully, and the others\r\nfollowed him. The supper was rapidly prepared with spirits of wine.\r\nThe interior temperature of the snow-house was bearable, as the wind\r\nwhich raged outside could not penetrate. When their repast, which\r\nwas always the same, was over, they began to think of sleep. A\r\nmackintosh was spread over the floor and kept them from the damp.\r\nTheir stockings and shoes were dried by the portable grate, and then\r\nthree of the travellers wrapped themselves up in their blankets,\r\nleaving the fourth to keep watch; he watched over the common safety,\r\nand prevented the opening getting blocked up, for if it did they would\r\nbe buried alive.\r\n\r\nDick shared the snow-house; the other dogs remained outside, and after\r\ntheir supper they squatted down in the snow, which made them a blanket.\r\nThe men were tired out with their day's walk, and soon slept. The\r\ndoctor took his turn on guard at three o'clock in the morning. There\r\nwas a tempest during the night, the gusts of which thickened the walls\r\nof the snow-house. The next day, at six o'clock, they set out again\r\non their monotonous march. The temperature lowered several degrees,\r\nand hardened the ground so that walking was easier. They often met\r\nwith mounds or cairns something like the Esquimaux hiding-places.\r\nThe doctor had one demolished, and found nothing but a block of ice.\r\n\r\n\"What did you expect, Clawbonny?\" said Hatteras. \"Are we not the first\r\nmen who have set foot here?\"\r\n\r\n\"It's very likely we are, but who knows?\" answered the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"I do not want to lose my time in useless search,\" continued the\r\ncaptain; \"I want to be quick back to my ship, even if we don't find\r\nthe fuel.\"\r\n\r\n\"I believe we are certain of doing that,\" said the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"I often wish I had not left the _Forward_,\" said Hatteras; \"a\r\ncaptain's place is on board.\"\r\n\r\n\"Johnson is there.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; but--well, we must make haste, that's all.\"\r\n\r\nThe procession marched along rapidly; Simpson excited the dogs by\r\ncalling to them; in consequence of a phosphorescent phenomenon they\r\nseemed to be running on a ground in flames, and the sledges seemed\r\nto raise a dust of sparks. The doctor went on in front to examine\r\nthe state of the snow, but all at once he disappeared. Bell, who was\r\nnearest to him, ran up.\r\n\r\n\"Well, Mr. Clawbonny,\" he called out in anxiety, \"where are you?\"\r\n\r\n\"Doctor!\" called the captain.\r\n\r\n\"Here, in a hole,\" answered a reassuring voice; \"throw me a cord,\r\nand I shall soon be on the surface of the globe again.\"\r\n\r\nThey threw a cord to the doctor, who was at the bottom of a hole about\r\nten feet deep; he fastened it round his waist, and his companions\r\nhauled him up with difficulty.\r\n\r\n\"Are you hurt?\" asked Hatteras.\r\n\r\n\"Not a bit,\" answered the doctor, shaking his kind face, all covered\r\nwith snow.\r\n\r\n\"But how did you tumble down there?\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, it was the refraction's fault,\" he answered laughing. \"I thought\r\nI was stepping across about a foot's distance, and I fell into a hole\r\nten feet deep! I never shall get used to it. It will teach us to sound\r\nevery step before we advance. Ears hear and eyes see all topsy-turvy\r\nin this enchanted spot.\"\r\n\r\n\"Can you go on?\" asked the captain.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, yes; the little fall has done me more good than harm.\"\r\n\r\nIn the evening the travellers had marched twenty-five miles; they\r\nwere worn out, but it did not prevent the doctor climbing up an iceberg\r\nwhile the snow-house was being built. The full moon shone with\r\nextraordinary brilliancy in the clearest sky; the stars were\r\nsingularly bright; from the top of the iceberg the view stretched\r\nover an immense plain, bristling with icebergs; they were of all sizes\r\nand shapes, and made the field look like a vast cemetery, in which\r\ntwenty generations slept the sleep of death. Notwithstanding the cold,\r\nthe doctor remained a long time in contemplation of the spectacle,\r\nand his companions had much trouble to get him away; but they were\r\nobliged to think of rest; the snow-hut was ready; the four companions\r\nburrowed into it like moles, and soon slept the sleep of the just.\r\n\r\nThe next day and the following ones passed without any particular\r\nincident; the journey was easy or difficult according to the weather;\r\nwhen it was cold and clear they wore their moccasins and advanced\r\nrapidly, when damp and penetrating, their snow-shoes, and made little\r\nway. They reached thus the 15th of January; the moon was in her last\r\nquarter, and was only visible for a short time; the sun, though still\r\nhidden below the horizon, gave six hours of a sort of twilight, not\r\nsufficient to see the way by; they were obliged to stake it out\r\naccording to the direction given by the compass. Bell led the way;\r\nHatteras marched in a straight line behind him; then Simpson and the\r\ndoctor, taking it in turns, so as only to see Hatteras, and keep in\r\na straight line. But notwithstanding all their precautions, they\r\ndeviated sometimes thirty or forty degrees; they were then obliged\r\nto stake it out again. On Sunday, the 15th of January, Hatteras\r\nconsidered he had made a hundred miles to the south; the morning was\r\nconsecrated to the mending of different articles of clothing and\r\nencampment; divine service was not forgotten. They set out again at\r\nnoon; the temperature was cold, the thermometer marked only 32 degrees\r\nbelow zero in a very clear atmosphere.\r\n\r\nAll at once, without warning of any kind, a vapour rose from the ground\r\nin a complete state of congelation, reaching a height of about ninety\r\nfeet, and remaining stationary; they could not see a foot before them;\r\nit clung to their clothing, and bristled it with ice. Our travellers,\r\nsurprised by the frost-rime, had all the same idea--that of getting\r\nnear one another. They called out, \"Bell!\" \"Simpson!\" \"This way,\r\ndoctor!\" \"Where are you, captain?\" But no answers were heard; the\r\nvapour did not conduct sound. They all fired as a sign of rallying.\r\nBut if the sound of the voice appeared too weak, the detonation of\r\nthe firearms was too strong, for it was echoed in all directions,\r\nand produced a confused rumble without appreciable direction. Each\r\nacted then according to his instincts. Hatteras stopped, folded his\r\narms, and waited. Simpson contented himself with stopping his sledge.\r\nBell retraced his steps, feeling the traces with his hands. The doctor\r\nran hither and thither, bumping against the icebergs, falling down,\r\ngetting up, and losing himself more and more. At the end of five\r\nminutes he said:\r\n\r\n\"I can't go on like this! What a queer climate! It changes too suddenly,\r\nand the icicles are cutting my face. Captain! I say, captain!\"\r\n\r\nBut he obtained no answer; he discharged his gun, and notwithstanding\r\nhis thick gloves, burnt his hand with the trigger. During this\r\noperation he thought he saw a confused mass moving at a few steps\r\nfrom him.\r\n\r\n\"At last!\" said he. \"Hatteras! Bell! Simpson! Is it you? Answer, do!\"\r\n\r\nA hollow growl was the only answer.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever is that?\" thought the doctor. The mass approached, and its\r\noutline was more distinctly seen. \"Why, it's a bear!\" thought the\r\nterrified doctor. It was a bear, lost too in the frost-rime, passing\r\nwithin a few steps of the men of whose existence it was ignorant.\r\nThe doctor saw its enormous paws beating the air, and did not like\r\nthe situation. He jumped back and the mass disappeared like a phantom.\r\nThe doctor felt the ground rising under his feet; climbing on\r\nall-fours he got to the top of a block, then another, feeling the\r\nend with his stick. \"It's an iceberg!\" he said to himself: \"if I get\r\nto the top I shall be saved.\" So saying he climbed to a height of\r\nabout eighty feet; his head was higher than the frozen fog, of which\r\nhe could clearly see the top. As he looked round he saw the heads\r\nof his three companions emerging from the dense fluid.\r\n\r\n\"Hatteras!\"\r\n\r\n\"Doctor!\"\r\n\r\n\"Bell!\"\r\n\r\n\"Simpson!\"\r\n\r\nThe four names were all shouted at the same time; the sky, lightened\r\nby a magnificent halo, threw pale rays which coloured the frost-rime\r\nlike clouds, and the summits of the icebergs seemed to emerge from\r\nliquid silver. The travellers found themselves circumscribed by a\r\ncircle less than a hundred feet in diameter. Thanks to the purity\r\nof the upper layers of air, they could hear each other distinctly,\r\nand could talk from the top of their icebergs. After the first shots\r\nthey had all thought the best thing they could do was to climb.\r\n\r\n\"The sledge!\" cried the captain.\r\n\r\n\"It's eighty feet below us,\" answered Simpson.\r\n\r\n\"In what condition?\"\r\n\r\n\"In good condition.\"\r\n\r\n\"What about the bear?\" asked the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"What bear?\" asked Bell.\r\n\r\n\"The bear that nearly broke my head,\" answered the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"If there is a bear we must go down,\" said Hatteras.\r\n\r\n\"If we do we shall get lost again,\" said the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"And our dogs?\" said Hatteras.\r\n\r\nAt this moment Dick's bark was heard through the fog.\r\n\r\n\"That's Dick,\" said Hatteras; \"there's something up; I shall go down.\"\r\n\r\nGrowls and barks were heard in a fearful chorus. In the fog it sounded\r\nlike an immense humming in a wadded room. Some struggle was evidently\r\ngoing on.\r\n\r\n\"Dick! Dick!\" cried the captain, re-entering the frost-rime.\r\n\r\n\"Wait a minute, Hatteras; I believe the fog is clearing off,\" called\r\nout the doctor. So it was, but lowering like the waters of a pond\r\nthat is being emptied; it seemed to enter the ground from whence it\r\nsprang; the shining summits of the icebergs grew above it; others,\r\nsubmerged till then, came out like new islands; by an optical illusion\r\nthe travellers seemed to be mounting with their icebergs above the\r\nfog. Soon the top of the sledge appeared, then the dogs, then about\r\nthirty other animals, then enormous moving masses, and Dick jumping\r\nabout in and out of the fog.\r\n\r\n\"Foxes!\" cried Bell.\r\n\r\n\"Bears!\" shouted the doctor. \"Five!\"\r\n\r\n\"Our dogs! Our provisions!\" cried Simpson. A band of foxes and bears\r\nhad attacked the sledge, and were making havoc with the provisions.\r\nThe instinct of pillage made them agree; the dogs barked furiously,\r\nbut the herd took no notice, and the scene of destruction was\r\nlamentable.\r\n\r\n\"Fire!\" cried the captain, discharging his gun. His companions\r\nimitated him. Upon hearing the quadruple detonation the bears raised\r\ntheir heads, and with a comical growl gave the signal for departure;\r\nthey went faster than a horse could gallop, and, followed by the herd\r\nof foxes, soon disappeared amongst the northern icebergs.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX\r\n\r\nTHE CAIRN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe frost-rime had lasted about three-quarters of an hour; quite long\r\nenough for the bears and foxes to make away with a considerable\r\nquantity of provisions which they attacked all the more greedily,\r\narriving, as they did, when the animals were perishing with hunger\r\nfrom the long winter. They had torn open the covering of the sledge\r\nwith their enormous paws; the cases of pemmican were open, and\r\nhalf-empty; the biscuit-bags pillaged, the provisions of tea spilt\r\nover the snow, a barrel of spirits of wine broken up, and its precious\r\ncontents run out; the camping materials lying all about. The wild\r\nanimals had done their work.\r\n\r\n\"The devils have done for us!\" said Bell.\r\n\r\n\"What shall we do now?\" said Simpson.\r\n\r\n\"Let us first see how much we've lost,\" said the doctor; \"we can talk\r\nafter.\"\r\n\r\nHatteras said nothing, but began picking up the scattered objects.\r\nThey picked up all the pemmican and biscuit that was still eatable.\r\nThe loss of so much spirits of wine was deplorable, as without it\r\nit was impossible to get any hot drinks--no tea nor coffee.\r\n\r\nThe doctor made an inventory of the provisions that were left, and\r\nfound that the animals had eaten two hundred pounds of pemmican and\r\na hundred and fifty pounds of biscuit; if the travellers continued\r\ntheir journey they would be obliged to put themselves on half-rations.\r\nThey deliberated about what was to be done under the circumstances.\r\nShould they return to the brig and begin their expedition again? But\r\nhow could they resolve to lose the hundred and fifty miles already\r\ncleared? and coming back without the fuel, how would they be received\r\nby the crew? and which of them would begin the excursion again? It\r\nwas evident that the best thing to do was to go on, even at the price\r\nof the worst privations. The doctor, Hatteras, and Bell were for going\r\non, but Simpson wanted to go back; his health had severely suffered\r\nfrom the fatigues of the journey, and he grew visibly weaker; but\r\nat last, seeing he was alone in his opinion, he took his place at\r\nthe head of the sledge, and the little caravan continued its route.\r\nDuring the three following days, from the 15th to the 17th of January,\r\nthe monotonous incidents of the journey took place again. They went\r\non more slowly; the travellers were soon tired; their legs ached with\r\nfatigue, and the dogs drew with difficulty. Their insufficient food\r\ntold upon them. The weather changed with its usual quickness, going\r\nsuddenly from intense cold to damp and penetrating fogs.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of January the aspect of the ice-field changed all at\r\nonce. A great number of peaks, like pyramids, ending in a sharp point\r\nat a great elevation, showed themselves on the horizon. The soil in\r\ncertain places was seen through the layer of snow; it seemed to consist\r\nof schist and quartz, with some appearance of calcareous rock. At\r\nlast the travellers had reached _terra firma_, and, according to their\r\nestimation, the continent must be New Cornwall. The doctor was\r\ndelighted to tread on solid ground once more; the travellers had only\r\na hundred more miles to go before reaching Belcher Cape; but the\r\ntrouble of walking increased on this rocky soil, full of inequalities,\r\ncrevices, and precipices; they were obliged to plunge into the\r\ninterior of the land and climb the high cliffs on the coast, across\r\nnarrow gorges, in which the snow was piled up to a height of thirty\r\nor forty feet. The travellers soon had cause to regret the levels\r\nthey had left, on which the sledge rolled so easily. Now they were\r\nobliged to drag it with all their strength. The dogs were worn out,\r\nand had to be helped; the men harnessed themselves along with them,\r\nand wore themselves out too. They were often obliged to unload the\r\nprovisions in order to get over a steep hill, whose frozen surface\r\ngave no hold. Some passages ten feet long took hours to clear. During\r\nthe first day they only made about five miles on that land, so well\r\nnamed Cornwall. The next day the sledge attained the upper part of\r\nthe cliffs; the travellers were too exhausted to construct their\r\nsnow-house, and were obliged to pass the night under the tent,\r\nenveloped in their buffalo-skins, and drying their stockings by\r\nplacing them on their chests. The consequences of such a state of\r\nthings may be readily imagined; during the night the thermometer went\r\ndown to 44 degrees below zero, and the mercury froze.\r\n\r\nThe health of Simpson became alarming; an obstinate cold, violent\r\nrheumatism, and intolerable pain forced him to lie down on the sledge,\r\nwhich he could no longer guide. Bell took his place; he was not well,\r\nbut was obliged not to give in. The doctor also felt the influence\r\nof his terrible winter excursion, but he did not utter a complaint;\r\nhe marched on in front, leaning on his stick; he lighted the way;\r\nhe helped in everything. Hatteras, impassive, impenetrable,\r\ninsensible, in as good health as the first day, with his iron\r\nconstitution, followed the sledge in silence. On the 20th of January\r\nthe weather was so bad that the least effort caused immediate\r\nprostration; but the difficulties of the ground became so great that\r\nHatteras and Bell harnessed themselves along with the dogs; the front\r\nof the sledge was broken by an unexpected shock, and they were forced\r\nto stop and mend it. Such delays occurred several times a day. The\r\ntravellers were journeying along a deep ravine up to their waists\r\nin snow, and perspiring, notwithstanding the violent cold. No one\r\nspoke. All at once Bell looked at the doctor in alarm, picked up a\r\nhandful of snow, and began to rub his companion's face with all his\r\nmight.\r\n\r\n\"What the deuce, Bell?\" said the doctor, struggling.\r\n\r\nBut Bell went on rubbing.\r\n\r\n\"Are you mad? You've filled my eyes, nose, and mouth with snow. What\r\nis it?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why,\" answered Bell, \"if you've got a nose left, you owe it to me.\"\r\n\r\n\"A nose?\" said the doctor, putting his hand to his face.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Mr. Clawbonny, you were quite frostbitten; your nose was quite\r\nwhite when I looked at you, and without my bit of rubbing you would\r\nbe minus nose.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks, Bell,\" said the doctor; \"I'll do the same for you in case\r\nof need.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope you will, Mr. Clawbonny, and I only wish we had nothing worse\r\nto look forward to!\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean Simpson! Poor fellow, he is suffering dreadfully!\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you fear for him?\" asked Hatteras quickly.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, captain,\" answered the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"What do you fear?\"\r\n\r\n\"A violent attack of scurvy. His legs swell already, and his gums\r\nare attacked; the poor fellow is lying under his blankets on the sledge,\r\nand every shock increases his pain. I pity him, but I can't do anything\r\nfor him!\"\r\n\r\n\"Poor Simpson!\" said Bell.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps we had better stop a day or two,\" said the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"Stop!\" cried Hatteras, \"when the lives of eighteen men depend upon\r\nour return! You know we have only enough provisions left for twenty\r\ndays.\"\r\n\r\nNeither the doctor nor Bell could answer that, and the sledge went\r\non its way. In the evening they stopped at the foot of an ice-hill,\r\nout of which Bell soon cut a cavern; the travellers took refuge in\r\nit, and the doctor passed the night in nursing Simpson; he was a prey\r\nto the scurvy, and constant groans issued from his terrified lips.\r\n\r\n\"Ah, Mr. Clawbonny, I shall never get over it. I wish I was dead\r\nalready.\"\r\n\r\n\"Take courage, my poor fellow!\" answered the doctor, with pity in\r\nhis tone, and he answered Simpson's complaints by incessant attention.\r\nThough half-dead with fatigue, he employed a part of the night in\r\nmaking the sick man a soothing draught, and rubbed him with lime-juice.\r\nUnfortunately it had little effect, and did not prevent the terrible\r\nmalady spreading. The next day they were obliged to lift the poor\r\nfellow on to the sledge, although he begged and prayed them to leave\r\nhim to die in peace, and begin their painful march again.\r\n\r\nThe freezing mists wet the three men to the skin; the snow and sleet\r\nbeat in their faces; they did the work of beasts of burden, and had\r\nnot even sufficient food. Dick ran hither and thither, discovering\r\nby instinct the best route to follow. During the morning of the 23rd\r\nof January, when it was nearly dark, for the new moon had not yet\r\nmade her appearance, Dick ran on first; he was lost to sight for\r\nseveral hours. Hatteras became anxious, as there were many bear-marks\r\non the ground; he was considering what had better be done, when a\r\nloud barking was heard in front. The little procession moved on\r\nquicker, and soon came upon the faithful animal in the depth of a\r\nravine. Dick was set as if he had been petrified in front of a sort\r\nof cairn, made of limestone, and covered with a cement of ice.\r\n\r\n\"This time,\" said the doctor, disengaging himself from the traces,\r\n\"it's really a cairn; we can't be mistaken.\"\r\n\r\n\"What does it matter to us?\" said Hatteras.\r\n\r\n\"Why, if it is a cairn, it may inclose something that would be useful\r\nto us--some provisions perhaps.\"\r\n\r\n\"As if Europeans had ever been here!\" said Hatteras, shrugging his\r\nshoulders.\r\n\r\n\"But if not Europeans, it may be that the Esquimaux have hidden some\r\nproduct of their hunting here. They are accustomed to doing it, I\r\nthink.\"\r\n\r\n\"Well, look if you like, Clawbonny, but I don't think it is worth\r\nyour while.\"\r\n\r\nClawbonny and Bell, armed with their pickaxes made for the cairn.\r\nDick kept on barking furiously. The cairn was soon demolished, and\r\nthe doctor took out a damp paper. Hatteras took the document and read:\r\n\r\n\"Altam..., _Porpoise_, Dec... 13th, 1860,\r\n12.. degrees long... 8.. degrees 35 minutes lat...\"\r\n\r\n\"The _Porpoise_!\" said the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"I don't know any ship of that name frequenting these seas,\" said\r\nHatteras.\r\n\r\n\"It is evident,\" continued the doctor, \"that some sailors, or perhaps\r\nsome shipwrecked fellows, have passed here within the last two\r\nmonths.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's certain,\" said Bell.\r\n\r\n\"What shall we do?\" asked the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"Continue our route,\" said Hatteras coldly. \"I don't know anything\r\nabout the _Porpoise_, but I do know that the _Forward_ is waiting\r\nfor our return.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI\r\n\r\nTHE DEATH OF SIMPSON\r\n\r\n\r\nThe travellers went on their weary way, each thinking of the discovery\r\nthey had just made. Hatteras frowned with uneasiness.\r\n\r\n\"What can the _Porpoise_ be?\" he asked himself. \"Is it a ship? and\r\nif so, what was it doing so near the Pole?\"\r\n\r\nAt this thought he shivered, but not from the cold. The doctor and\r\nBell only thought of the result their discovery might have for others\r\nor for themselves. But the difficulties and obstacles in their way\r\nsoon made them oblivious to everything but their own preservation.\r\n\r\nSimpson's condition grew worse; the doctor saw that death was near.\r\nHe could do nothing, and was suffering cruelly on his own account\r\nfrom a painful ophthalmia which might bring on blindness if neglected.\r\nThe twilight gave them enough light to hurt the eyes when reflected\r\nby the snow; it was difficult to guard against the reflection, for\r\nthe spectacle-glasses got covered with a layer of opaque ice which\r\nobstructed the view, and when so much care was necessary for the\r\ndangers of the route, it was important to see clearly; however, the\r\ndoctor and Bell took it in turns to cover their eyes or to guide the\r\nsledge. The soil was volcanic, and by its inequalities made it very\r\ndifficult to draw the sledge, the frame of which was getting worn\r\nout. Another difficulty was the effect of the uniform brilliancy of\r\nthe snow; the ground seemed to fall beneath the feet of the travellers,\r\nand they experienced the same sensation as that of the rolling of\r\na ship; they could not get accustomed to it, and it made them sleepy,\r\nand they often walked on half in a dream. Then some unexpected shock,\r\nfall, or obstacle would wake them up from their inertia, which\r\nafterwards took possession of them again.\r\n\r\nOn the 25th of January they began to descend, and their dangers\r\nincreased. The least slip might send them down a precipice, and there\r\nthey would have been infallibly lost. Towards evening an extremely\r\nviolent tempest swept the snow-clad summits; they were obliged to\r\nlie down on the ground, and the temperature was so low that they were\r\nin danger of being frozen to death. Bell, with the help of Hatteras,\r\nbuilt a snow-house, in which the poor fellows took shelter; there\r\nthey partook of a little pemmican and warm tea; there were only a\r\nfew gallons of spirits of wine left, and they were obliged to use\r\nthem to quench their thirst, as they could not take snow in its natural\r\nstate; it must be melted. In temperate countries, where the\r\ntemperature scarcely falls below freezing point, it is not injurious;\r\nbut above the Polar circle it gets so cold that it cannot be touched\r\nmore than a red-hot iron; there is such a difference of temperature\r\nthat its absorption produces suffocation. The Esquimaux would rather\r\nsuffer the greatest torments than slake their thirst with snow.\r\n\r\nThe doctor took his turn to watch at three o'clock in the morning,\r\nwhen the tempest was at its height; he was leaning in a corner of\r\nthe snow-house, when a lamentable groan from Simpson drew his\r\nattention; he rose to go to him, and struck his head against the roof;\r\nwithout thinking of the accident he began to rub Simpson's swollen\r\nlimbs; after about a quarter of an hour he got up again, and bumped\r\nhis head again, although he was kneeling then.\r\n\r\n\"That's very queer,\" he said to himself.\r\n\r\nHe lifted his hand above his head, and felt that the roof was lowering.\r\n\r\n\"Good God!\" he cried; \"Hatteras! Bell!\"\r\n\r\nHis cries awoke his companions, who got up quickly, and bumped\r\nthemselves too; the darkness was thick.\r\n\r\n\"The roof is falling in!\" cried the doctor.\r\n\r\nThey all rushed out, dragging Simpson with them; they had no sooner\r\nleft their dangerous retreat, than it fell in with a great noise.\r\nThe poor fellows were obliged to take refuge under the tent covering,\r\nwhich was soon covered with a thick layer of snow, which, as a bad\r\nconductor, prevented the travellers being frozen alive. The tempest\r\ncontinued all through the night. When Bell harnessed the dogs the\r\nnext morning he found that some of them had begun to eat their leather\r\nharness, and that two of them were very ill, and could not go much\r\nfurther. However, the caravan set out again; there only remained sixty\r\nmiles to go. On the 26th, Bell, who went on in front, called out\r\nsuddenly to his companions. They ran up to him, and he pointed to\r\na gun leaning against an iceberg.\r\n\r\n\"A gun!\" cried the doctor.\r\n\r\nHatteras took it; it was loaded and in good condition.\r\n\r\n\"The men from the _Porpoise_ can't be far off,\" said the doctor.\r\n\r\nHatteras remarked that the gun was of American manufacture, and his\r\nhands crisped the frozen barrel. He gave orders to continue the march,\r\nand they kept on down the mountain slope. Simpson seemed deprived\r\nof all feeling; he had no longer the strength to complain. The tempest\r\nkept on, and the sledge proceeded more and more slowly; they scarcely\r\nmade a few miles in twenty-four hours, and in spite of the strictest\r\neconomy, the provisions rapidly diminished; but as long as they had\r\nenough for the return journey, Hatteras kept on.\r\n\r\nOn the 27th they found a sextant half-buried in the snow, then a\r\nleather bottle; the latter contained brandy, or rather a lump of ice,\r\nwith a ball of snow in the middle, which represented the spirit; it\r\ncould not be used. It was evident that they were following in the\r\nsteps of some poor shipwrecked fellows who, like them, had taken the\r\nonly practicable route. The doctor looked carefully round for other\r\ncairns, but in vain. Sad thoughts came into his mind; he could not\r\nhelp thinking that it would be a good thing not to meet with their\r\npredecessors; what could he and his companions do for them? They\r\nwanted help themselves; their clothes were in rags, and they had not\r\nenough to eat. If their predecessors were numerous they would all\r\ndie of hunger. Hatteras seemed to wish to avoid them, and could he\r\nbe blamed? But these men might be their fellow-countrymen, and,\r\nhowever slight might be the chance of saving them, ought they not\r\nto try it? He asked Bell what he thought about it, but the poor fellow's\r\nheart was hardened by his own suffering, and he did not answer.\r\nClawbonny dared not question Hatteras, so he left it to Providence.\r\n\r\nIn the evening of the 27th, Simpson appeared to be at the last\r\nextremity; his limbs were already stiff and frozen; his difficult\r\nbreathing formed a sort of mist round his head, and convulsive\r\nmovements announced that his last hour was come. The expression of\r\nhis face was terrible, desperate, and he threw looks of powerless\r\nanger towards the captain. He accused him silently, and Hatteras\r\navoided him and became more taciturn and wrapped up in himself than\r\never. The following night was frightful; the tempest redoubled in\r\nviolence; the tent was thrown down three times, and the snowdrifts\r\nburied the poor fellows, blinded them, froze them, and wounded them\r\nwith the sharp icicles struck off the surrounding icebergs. The dogs\r\nhowled lamentably. Simpson lay exposed to the cruel atmosphere. Bell\r\nsucceeded in getting up the tent again, which, though it did not\r\nprotect them from the cold, kept out the snow. But a more violent\r\ngust blew it down a fourth time, and dragged it along in its fury.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, we can't bear it any longer!\" cried Bell.\r\n\r\n\"Courage, man, courage!\" answered the doctor, clinging to him in order\r\nto prevent themselves rolling down a ravine. Simpson's death-rattle\r\nwas heard. All at once, with a last effort, he raised himself up and\r\nshook his fist at Hatteras, who was looking at him fixedly, then gave\r\na fearful cry, and fell back dead in the midst of his unfinished\r\nthreat.\r\n\r\n\"He is dead!\" cried the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"Dead!\" repeated Bell.\r\n\r\nHatteras advanced towards the corpse, but was driven back by a gust\r\nof wind.\r\n\r\nPoor Simpson was the first victim to the murderous climate, the first\r\nto pay with his life the unreasonable obstinacy of the captain. The\r\ndead man had called Hatteras an assassin, but he did not bend beneath\r\nthe accusation. A single tear escaped from his eyes and froze on his\r\npale cheek. The doctor and Bell looked at him with a sort of terror.\r\nLeaning on his stick, he looked like the genius of the North, upright\r\nin the midst of the whirlwind, and frightful in his immobility.\r\n\r\nHe remained standing thus till the first dawn of twilight, bold,\r\ntenacious, indomitable, and seemed to defy the tempest that roared\r\nround him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII\r\n\r\nTHE RETURN\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wind went down about six in the morning, and turning suddenly\r\nnorth cleared the clouds from the sky; the thermometer marked 33\r\ndegrees below zero. The first rays of the sun reached the horizon\r\nwhich they would gild a few days later. Hatteras came up to his two\r\ndejected companions, and said to them, in a low, sad voice:\r\n\r\n\"We are still more than sixty miles from the spot indicated by Sir\r\nEdward Belcher. We have just enough provisions to allow us to get\r\nback to the brig. If we go on any further we shall meet with certain\r\ndeath, and that will do good to no one. We had better retrace our\r\nsteps.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is a sensible resolution, Hatteras,\" answered the doctor; \"I\r\nwould have followed you as far as you led us, but our health gets\r\ndaily weaker; we can scarcely put one foot before the other; we ought\r\nto go back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that your opinion too, Bell?\" asked Hatteras.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, captain,\" answered the carpenter.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" said Hatteras; \"we will take two days' rest. We want\r\nit. The sledge wants mending. I think we had better build ourselves\r\na snow-house, and try to regain a little strength.\"\r\n\r\nAfter this was settled, our three men set to work with vigour. Bell\r\ntook the necessary precautions to assure the solidity of the\r\nconstruction, and they soon had a good shelter at the bottom of the\r\nravine where the last halt had taken place. It had cost Hatteras a\r\ngreat effort to interrupt his journey. All their trouble and pain\r\nlost! A useless excursion, which one man had paid for with his life.\r\nWhat would become of the crew now that all hope of coal was over?\r\nWhat would Shandon think? Notwithstanding all these painful thoughts,\r\nhe felt it impossible to go on any further. They began their\r\npreparations for the return journey at once. The sledge was mended;\r\nit had now only two hundred pounds weight to carry. They mended their\r\nclothes, worn-out, torn, soaked with snow, and hardened by the frost;\r\nnew moccasins and snow-shoes replaced those that were worn out. This\r\nwork took the whole day of the 29th and the morning of the 30th; the\r\nthree travellers rested and comforted themselves as well as they\r\ncould.\r\n\r\nDuring the thirty-six hours passed in the snow-house and on the\r\nicebergs of the ravine, the doctor had noticed that Dick's conduct\r\nwas very strange; he crept smelling about a sort of rising in the\r\nground made by several layers of ice; he kept wagging his tail with\r\nimpatience, and trying to draw the attention of his master to the\r\nspot. The doctor thought that the dog's uneasiness might be caused\r\nby the presence of Simpson's body, which he and his companions had\r\nnot yet had time to bury. He resolved to put it off no longer,\r\nespecially as they intended starting early the next morning. Bell\r\nand the doctor took their pickaxes and directed their steps towards\r\nthe lowest part of the ravine; the mound indicated by Dick seemed\r\nto be a good spot to place the corpse in; they were obliged to bury\r\nit deep to keep it from the bears. They began by removing the layer\r\nof soft snow, and then attacked the ice. At the third blow of his\r\npickaxe the doctor broke some hard obstacle; he took out the pieces\r\nand saw that it was a glass bottle; Bell discovered a small\r\nbiscuit-sack with a few crumbs at the bottom.\r\n\r\n\"Whatever does this mean?\" said the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"I can't think,\" answered Bell, suspending his work.\r\n\r\nThey called Hatteras, who came immediately. Dick barked loudly, and\r\nbegan scratching at the ice.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps we have found a provision-store,\" said the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"It is possible,\" said Bell.\r\n\r\n\"Go on,\" said Hatteras.\r\n\r\nSome remains of food were drawn out, and a case a quarter full of\r\npemmican.\r\n\r\n\"If it is a hiding-place,\" said Hatteras, \"the bears have been before\r\nus. See, the provisions are not intact.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am afraid so,\" answered the doctor; \"for----\"\r\n\r\nHe was interrupted by a cry from Bell, who had come upon a man's leg,\r\nstiffened and frozen.\r\n\r\n\"A corpse,\" cried the doctor.\r\n\r\n\"It is a tomb,\" answered Hatteras.\r\n\r\nWhen the corpse was disinterred it turned out to be that of a sailor,\r\nabout thirty years old, perfectly preserved. He wore the clothes of\r\nan Arctic navigator. The doctor could not tell how long he had been\r\ndead. But after this corpse, Bell discovered a second, that of a man\r\nof fifty, bearing the mark of the suffering that had killed him on\r\nhis face.\r\n\r\n\"These are not buried bodies,\" cried the doctor, \"the poor fellows\r\nwere surprised by death just as we find them.\"\r\n\r\n\"You are right, Mr. Clawbonny,\" answered Bell.\r\n\r\n\"Go on! go on!\" said Hatteras.\r\n\r\nBell obeyed tremblingly; for who knew how many human bodies the mound\r\ncontained?\r\n\r\n\"These men have been the victims of the same accident that almost\r\nhappened to us,\" said the doctor. \"Their snow-house tumbled in. Let\r\nus see if any one of them is still alive.\"\r\n\r\nThe place was soon cleared, and Bell dug out a third body, that of\r\na man of forty, who had not the cadaverous look of the others. The\r\ndoctor examined him and thought he recognised some symptoms of\r\nexistence.\r\n\r\n\"He is alive!\" he cried.\r\n\r\nBell and he carried the body into the snow-house whilst Hatteras,\r\nunmoved, contemplated their late habitation. The doctor stripped the\r\nresuscitated man and found no trace of a wound on him. He and Bell\r\nrubbed him vigorously with oakum steeped in spirits of wine, and they\r\nsaw signs of returning consciousness; but the unfortunate man was\r\nin a state of complete prostration, and could not speak a word. His\r\ntongue stuck to his palate as if frozen. The doctor searched his\r\npockets, but they were empty. He left Bell to continue the friction,\r\nand rejoined Hatteras. The captain had been down into the depths of\r\nthe snow-house, and had searched about carefully. He came up holding\r\na half-burnt fragment of a letter. These words were on it:\r\n\r\n    ... tamont\r\n    ... orpoise\r\n    ... w York.\r\n\r\n\"Altamont!\" cried the doctor, of the ship _Porpoise_, of New York.\"\r\n\r\n\"An American,\" said Hatteras.\r\n\r\n\"I'll save him,\" said the doctor, \"and then we shall know all about\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nHe went back to Altamont whilst Hatteras remained pensive. Thanks\r\nto his attentions, the doctor succeeded in recalling the unfortunate\r\nman to life, but not to feeling; he neither saw, heard, nor spoke,\r\nbut he lived. The next day Hatteras said to the doctor:\r\n\r\n\"We must start at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. The sledge is not loaded; we'll put the poor fellow on it and\r\ntake him to the brig.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well; but we must bury these bodies first.\"\r\n\r\nThe two unknown sailors were placed under the ruins of the snow-house\r\nagain, and Simpson's corpse took Altamont's place. The three\r\ntravellers buried their companion, and at seven o'clock in the morning\r\nthey set out again. Two of the Greenland dogs were dead, and Dick\r\noffered himself in their place. He pulled with energy.\r\n\r\nDuring the next twenty days the travellers experienced the same\r\nincidents as before. But as it was in the month of February they did\r\nnot meet with the same difficulty from the ice. It was horribly cold,\r\nbut there was not much wind. The sun reappeared for the first time\r\non the 31st of January, and every day he stopped longer above the\r\nhorizon. Bell and the doctor were almost blinded and half-lame; the\r\ncarpenter was obliged to walk upon crutches. Altamont still lived,\r\nbut he was in a state of complete insensibility. The doctor took great\r\ncare of him, although he wanted attention himself; he was getting\r\nill with fatigue. Hatteras thought of nothing but his ship. What state\r\nshould he find it in?\r\n\r\nOn the 24th of February he stopped all of a sudden. A red light appeared\r\nabout 300 paces in front, and a column of black smoke went up to the\r\nsky.\r\n\r\n\"Look at that smoke! my ship is burning,\" said he with a beating heart.\r\n\r\n\"We are three miles off yet,\" said Bell; \"it can't be the _Forward_.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes it is,\" said the doctor; \"the mirage makes it seem nearer.\"\r\n\r\nThe three men, leaving the sledge to the care of Dick, ran on, and\r\nin an hour's time were in sight of the ship. She was burning in the\r\nmidst of the ice, which melted around her. A hundred steps farther\r\na man met them, wringing his hands before the _Forward_ in flames.\r\nIt was Johnson. Hatteras ran to him.\r\n\r\n\"My ship! My ship!\" cried he.\r\n\r\n\"Is that you, captain? Oh, don't come any nearer,\" said Johnson.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" said Hatteras.\r\n\r\n\"The wretches left forty-eight hours ago, after setting fire to the\r\nship.\"\r\n\r\n\"Curse them!\" cried Hatteras.\r\n\r\nA loud explosion was then heard; the ground trembled; the icebergs\r\nfell upon the ice-field; a column of smoke went up into the clouds,\r\nand the _Forward_ blew up. The doctor and Bell reached Hatteras, who\r\nout of the depths of despair cried:\r\n\r\n\"The cowards have fled! The strong will succeed! Johnson and Bell,\r\nyou are courageous. Doctor, you have science. I have faith. To the\r\nNorth Pole! To the North Pole!\"\r\n\r\nHis companions heard these energetic words, and they did them good;\r\nbut it was a terrible situation for these four men, alone, under the\r\n80th degree of latitude, in the midst of the Polar Regions!\r\n\r\n\r\nEND OF PART I OF THE ADVENTURES OF CAPTAIN HATTERAS\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEnd of Project Gutenberg's The English at the North Pole, by Jules Verne",
