Had Phaidor’s slim blade found that beloved heart? Time only\r\nwould reveal the truth.\r\n\r\nSix hundred and eighty-seven Martian days must come and go before the\r\ncell’s door would again come opposite the tunnel’s end where last I had\r\nseen my ever-beautiful Dejah Thoris.\r\n\r\nHalf of them had passed, or would on the morrow, yet vivid in my\r\nmemory, obliterating every event that had come before or after, there\r\nremained the last scene before the gust of smoke blinded my eyes and\r\nthe narrow slit that had given me sight of the interior of her cell\r\nclosed between me and the Princess of Helium for a long Martian year.\r\n\r\nAs if it were yesterday, I still saw the beautiful face of Phaidor,\r\ndaughter of Matai Shang, distorted with jealous rage and hatred as she\r\nsprang forward with raised dagger upon the woman I loved.\r\n\r\nI saw the red girl, Thuvia of Ptarth, leap forward to prevent the\r\nhideous deed.\r\n\r\nThe smoke from the burning temple had come then to blot out the\r\ntragedy, but in my ears rang the single shriek as the knife fell. Then\r\nsilence, and when the smoke had cleared, the revolving temple had shut\r\noff all sight or sound from the chamber in which the three beautiful\r\nwomen were imprisoned.\r\n\r\nMuch there had been to occupy my attention since that terrible moment;\r\nbut never for an instant had the memory of the thing faded, and all the\r\ntime that I could spare from the numerous duties that had devolved upon\r\nme in the reconstruction of the government of the First Born since our\r\nvictorious fleet and land forces had overwhelmed them, had been spent\r\nclose to the grim shaft that held the mother of my boy, Carthoris of\r\nHelium.\r\n\r\nThe race of blacks that for ages had worshiped Issus, the false deity\r\nof Mars, had been left in a state of chaos by my revealment of her as\r\nnaught more than a wicked old woman. In their rage they had torn her to\r\npieces.\r\n\r\nFrom the high pinnacle of their egotism the First Born had been plunged\r\nto the depths of humiliation. Their deity was gone, and with her the\r\nwhole false fabric of their religion. Their vaunted navy had fallen in\r\ndefeat before the superior ships and fighting men of the red men of\r\nHelium.\r\n\r\nFierce green warriors from the ocher sea bottoms of outer Mars had\r\nridden their wild thoats across the sacred gardens of the Temple of\r\nIssus, and Tars Tarkas, Jeddak of Thark, fiercest of them all, had sat\r\nupon the throne of Issus and ruled the First Born while the allies were\r\ndeciding the conquered nation’s fate.\r\n\r\nAlmost unanimous was the request that I ascend the ancient throne of\r\nthe black men, even the First Born themselves concurring in it; but I\r\nwould have none of it. My heart could never be with the race that had\r\nheaped indignities upon my princess and my son.\r\n\r\nAt my suggestion Xodar became Jeddak of the First Born. He had been a\r\ndator, or prince, until Issus had degraded him, so that his fitness for\r\nthe high office bestowed was unquestioned.\r\n\r\nThe peace of the Valley Dor thus assured, the green warriors dispersed\r\nto their desolate sea bottoms, while we of Helium returned to our own\r\ncountry. Here again was a throne offered me, since no word had been\r\nreceived from the missing Jeddak of Helium, Tardos Mors, grandfather of\r\nDejah Thoris, or his son, Mors Kajak, Jed of Helium, her father.\r\n\r\nOver a year had elapsed since they had set out to explore the northern\r\nhemisphere in search of Carthoris, and at last their disheartened\r\npeople had accepted as truth the vague rumors of their death that had\r\nfiltered in from the frozen region of the pole.\r\n\r\nOnce again I refused a throne, for I would not believe that the mighty\r\nTardos Mors, or his no less redoubtable son, was dead.\r\n\r\n“Let one of their own blood rule you until they return,” I said to the\r\nassembled nobles of Helium, as I addressed them from the Pedestal of\r\nTruth beside the Throne of Righteousness in the Temple of Reward, from\r\nthe very spot where I had stood a year before when Zat Arras pronounced\r\nthe sentence of death upon me.\r\n\r\nAs I spoke I stepped forward and laid my hand upon the shoulder of\r\nCarthoris where he stood in the front rank of the circle of nobles\r\nabout me.\r\n\r\nAs one, the nobles and the people lifted their voices in a long cheer\r\nof approbation. Ten thousand swords sprang on high from as many\r\nscabbards, and the glorious fighting men of ancient Helium hailed\r\nCarthoris Jeddak of Helium.\r\n\r\nHis tenure of office was to be for life or until his great-grandfather,\r\nor grandfather, should return. Having thus satisfactorily arranged this\r\nimportant duty for Helium, I started the following day for the Valley\r\nDor that I might remain close to the Temple of the Sun until the\r\nfateful day that should see the opening of the prison cell where my\r\nlost love lay buried.\r\n\r\nHor Vastus and Kantos Kan, with my other noble lieutenants, I left with\r\nCarthoris at Helium, that he might have the benefit of their wisdom,\r\nbravery, and loyalty in the performance of the arduous duties which had\r\ndevolved upon him. Only Woola, my Martian hound, accompanied me.\r\n\r\nAt my heels tonight the faithful beast moved softly in my tracks. As\r\nlarge as a Shetland pony, with hideous head and frightful fangs, he was\r\nindeed an awesome spectacle, as he crept after me on his ten short,\r\nmuscular legs; but to me he was the embodiment of love and loyalty.\r\n\r\nThe figure ahead was that of the black dator of the First Born, Thurid,\r\nwhose undying enmity I had earned that time I laid him low with my bare\r\nhands in the courtyard of the Temple of Issus, and bound him with his\r\nown harness before the noble men and women who had but a moment before\r\nbeen extolling his prowess.\r\n\r\nLike many of his fellows, he had apparently accepted the new order of\r\nthings with good grace, and had sworn fealty to Xodar, his new ruler;\r\nbut I knew that he hated me, and I was sure that in his heart he envied\r\nand hated Xodar, so I had kept a watch upon his comings and goings, to\r\nthe end that of late I had become convinced that he was occupied with\r\nsome manner of intrigue.\r\n\r\nSeveral times I had observed him leaving the walled city of the First\r\nBorn after dark, taking his way out into the cruel and horrible Valley\r\nDor, where no honest business could lead any man.\r\n\r\nTonight he moved quickly along the edge of the forest until well beyond\r\nsight or sound of the city, then he turned across the crimson sward\r\ntoward the shore of the Lost Sea of Korus.\r\n\r\nThe rays of the nearer moon, swinging low across the valley, touched\r\nhis jewel-incrusted harness with a thousand changing lights and glanced\r\nfrom the glossy ebony of his smooth hide. Twice he turned his head back\r\ntoward the forest, after the manner of one who is upon an evil errand,\r\nthough he must have felt quite safe from pursuit.\r\n\r\nI did not dare follow him there beneath the moonlight, since it best\r\nsuited my plans not to interrupt his—I wished him to reach his\r\ndestination unsuspecting, that I might learn just where that\r\ndestination lay and the business that awaited the night prowler there.\r\n\r\nSo it was that I remained hidden until after Thurid had disappeared\r\nover the edge of the steep bank beside the sea a quarter of a mile\r\naway. Then, with Woola following, I hastened across the open after the\r\nblack dator.\r\n\r\nThe quiet of the tomb lay upon the mysterious valley of death,\r\ncrouching deep in its warm nest within the sunken area at the south\r\npole of the dying planet. In the far distance the Golden Cliffs raised\r\ntheir mighty barrier faces far into the starlit heavens, the precious\r\nmetals and scintillating jewels that composed them sparkling in the\r\nbrilliant light of Mars’s two gorgeous moons.\r\n\r\nAt my back was the forest, pruned and trimmed like the sward to\r\nparklike symmetry by the browsing of the ghoulish plant men.\r\n\r\nBefore me lay the Lost Sea of Korus, while farther on I caught the\r\nshimmering ribbon of Iss, the River of Mystery, where it wound out from\r\nbeneath the Golden Cliffs to empty into Korus, to which for countless\r\nages had been borne the deluded and unhappy Martians of the outer world\r\nupon the voluntary pilgrimage to this false heaven.\r\n\r\nThe plant men, with their blood-sucking hands, and the monstrous white\r\napes that make Dor hideous by day, were hidden in their lairs for the\r\nnight.\r\n\r\nThere was no longer a Holy Thern upon the balcony in the Golden Cliffs\r\nabove the Iss to summon them with weird cry to the victims floating\r\ndown to their maws upon the cold, broad bosom of ancient Iss.\r\n\r\nThe navies of Helium and the First Born had cleared the fortresses and\r\nthe temples of the therns when they had refused to surrender and accept\r\nthe new order of things that had swept their false religion from\r\nlong-suffering Mars.\r\n\r\nIn a few isolated countries they still retained their age-old power;\r\nbut Matai Shang, their hekkador, Father of Therns, had been driven from\r\nhis temple. Strenuous had been our endeavors to capture him; but with a\r\nfew of the faithful he had escaped, and was in hiding—where we knew\r\nnot.\r\n\r\nAs I came cautiously to the edge of the low cliff overlooking the Lost\r\nSea of Korus I saw Thurid pushing out upon the bosom of the shimmering\r\nwater in a small skiff—one of those strangely wrought craft of\r\nunthinkable age which the Holy Therns, with their organization of\r\npriests and lesser therns, were wont to distribute along the banks of\r\nthe Iss, that the long journey of their victims might be facilitated.\r\n\r\nDrawn up on the beach below me were a score of similar boats, each with\r\nits long pole, at one end of which was a pike, at the other a paddle.\r\nThurid was hugging the shore, and as he passed out of sight round a\r\nnear-by promontory I shoved one of the boats into the water and,\r\ncalling Woola into it, pushed out from shore.\r\n\r\nThe pursuit of Thurid carried me along the edge of the sea toward the\r\nmouth of the Iss. The farther moon lay close to the horizon, casting a\r\ndense shadow beneath the cliffs that fringed the water. Thuria, the\r\nnearer moon, had set, nor would it rise again for near four hours, so\r\nthat I was ensured concealing darkness for that length of time at\r\nleast.\r\n\r\nOn and on went the black warrior. Now he was opposite the mouth of the\r\nIss. Without an instant’s hesitation he turned up the grim river,\r\npaddling hard against the strong current.\r\n\r\nAfter him came Woola and I, closer now, for the man was too intent upon\r\nforcing his craft up the river to have any eyes for what might be\r\ntranspiring behind him. He hugged the shore where the current was less\r\nstrong.\r\n\r\nPresently he came to the dark cavernous portal in the face of the\r\nGolden Cliffs, through which the river poured. On into the Stygian\r\ndarkness beyond he urged his craft.\r\n\r\nIt seemed hopeless to attempt to follow him here where I could not see\r\nmy hand before my face, and I was almost on the point of giving up the\r\npursuit and drifting back to the mouth of the river, there to await his\r\nreturn, when a sudden bend showed a faint luminosity ahead.\r\n\r\nMy quarry was plainly visible again, and in the increasing light from\r\nthe phosphorescent rock that lay embedded in great patches in the\r\nroughly arched roof of the cavern I had no difficulty in following him.\r\n\r\nIt was my first trip upon the bosom of Iss, and the things I saw there\r\nwill live forever in my memory.\r\n\r\nTerrible as they were, they could not have commenced to approximate the\r\nhorrible conditions which must have obtained before Tars Tarkas, the\r\ngreat green warrior, Xodar, the black dator, and I brought the light of\r\ntruth to the outer world and stopped the mad rush of millions upon the\r\nvoluntary pilgrimage to what they believed would end in a beautiful\r\nvalley of peace and happiness and love.\r\n\r\nEven now the low islands which dotted the broad stream were choked with\r\nthe skeletons and half devoured carcasses of those who, through fear or\r\na sudden awakening to the truth, had halted almost at the completion of\r\ntheir journey.\r\n\r\nIn the awful stench of these frightful charnel isles haggard maniacs\r\nscreamed and gibbered and fought among the torn remnants of their\r\ngrisly feasts; while on those which contained but clean-picked bones\r\nthey battled with one another, the weaker furnishing sustenance for the\r\nstronger; or with clawlike hands clutched at the bloated bodies that\r\ndrifted down with the current.\r\n\r\nThurid paid not the slightest attention to the screaming things that\r\neither menaced or pleaded with him as the mood directed them—evidently\r\nhe was familiar with the horrid sights that surrounded him. He\r\ncontinued up the river for perhaps a mile; and then, crossing over to\r\nthe left bank, drew his craft up on a low ledge that lay almost on a\r\nlevel with the water.\r\n\r\nI dared not follow across the stream, for he most surely would have\r\nseen me. Instead I stopped close to the opposite wall beneath an\r\noverhanging mass of rock that cast a dense shadow beneath it. Here I\r\ncould watch Thurid without danger of discovery.\r\n\r\nThe black was standing upon the ledge beside his boat, looking up the\r\nriver, as though he were awaiting one whom he expected from that\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nAs I lay there beneath the dark rocks I noticed that a strong current\r\nseemed to flow directly toward the center of the river, so that it was\r\ndifficult to hold my craft in its position. I edged farther into the\r\nshadow that I might find a hold upon the bank; but, though I proceeded\r\nseveral yards, I touched nothing; and then, finding that I would soon\r\nreach a point from where I could no longer see the black man, I was\r\ncompelled to remain where I was, holding my position as best I could by\r\npaddling strongly against the current which flowed from beneath the\r\nrocky mass behind me.\r\n\r\nI could not imagine what might cause this strong lateral flow, for the\r\nmain channel of the river was plainly visible to me from where I sat,\r\nand I could see the rippling junction of it and the mysterious current\r\nwhich had aroused my curiosity.\r\n\r\nWhile I was still speculating upon the phenomenon, my attention was\r\nsuddenly riveted upon Thurid, who had raised both palms forward above\r\nhis head in the universal salute of Martians, and a moment later his\r\n“Kaor!” the Barsoomian word of greeting, came in low but distinct\r\ntones.\r\n\r\nI turned my eyes up the river in the direction that his were bent, and\r\npresently there came within my limited range of vision a long boat, in\r\nwhich were six men. Five were at the paddles, while the sixth sat in\r\nthe seat of honor.\r\n\r\nThe white skins, the flowing yellow wigs which covered their bald\r\npates, and the gorgeous diadems set in circlets of gold about their\r\nheads marked them as Holy Therns.\r\n\r\nAs they drew up beside the ledge upon which Thurid awaited them, he in\r\nthe bow of the boat arose to step ashore, and then I saw that it was\r\nnone other than Matai Shang, Father of Therns.\r\n\r\nThe evident cordiality with which the two men exchanged greetings\r\nfilled me with wonder, for the black and white men of Barsoom were\r\nhereditary enemies—nor ever before had I known of two meeting other\r\nthan in battle.\r\n\r\nEvidently the reverses that had recently overtaken both peoples had\r\nresulted in an alliance between these two individuals—at least against\r\nthe common enemy—and now I saw why Thurid had come so often out into\r\nthe Valley Dor by night, and that the nature of his conspiring might be\r\nsuch as to strike very close to me or to my friends.\r\n\r\nI wished that I might have found a point closer to the two men from\r\nwhich to have heard their conversation; but it was out of the question\r\nnow to attempt to cross the river, and so I lay quietly watching them,\r\nwho would have given so much to have known how close I lay to them, and\r\nhow easily they might have overcome and killed me with their superior\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nSeveral times Thurid pointed across the river in my direction, but that\r\nhis gestures had any reference to me I did not for a moment believe.\r\nPresently he and Matai Shang entered the latter’s boat, which turned\r\nout into the river and, swinging round, forged steadily across in my\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nAs they advanced I moved my boat farther and farther in beneath the\r\noverhanging wall, but at last it became evident that their craft was\r\nholding the same course. The five paddlers sent the larger boat ahead\r\nat a speed that taxed my energies to equal.\r\n\r\nEvery instant I expected to feel my prow crash against solid rock. The\r\nlight from the river was no longer visible, but ahead I saw the faint\r\ntinge of a distant radiance, and still the water before me was open.\r\n\r\nAt last the truth dawned upon me—I was following a subterranean river\r\nwhich emptied into the Iss at the very point where I had hidden.\r\n\r\nThe rowers were now quite close to me. The noise of their own paddles\r\ndrowned the sound of mine, but in another instant the growing light\r\nahead would reveal me to them.\r\n\r\nThere was no time to be lost. Whatever action I was to take must be\r\ntaken at once. Swinging the prow of my boat toward the right, I sought\r\nthe river’s rocky side, and there I lay while Matai Shang and Thurid\r\napproached up the center of the stream, which was much narrower than\r\nthe Iss.\r\n\r\nAs they came nearer I heard the voices of Thurid and the Father of\r\nTherns raised in argument.\r\n\r\n“I tell you, Thern,” the black dator was saying, “that I wish only\r\nvengeance upon John Carter, Prince of Helium. I am leading you into no\r\ntrap. What could I gain by betraying you to those who have ruined my\r\nnation and my house?”\r\n\r\n“Let us stop here a moment that I may hear your plans,” replied the\r\nhekkador, “and then we may proceed with a better understanding of our\r\nduties and obligations.”\r\n\r\nTo the rowers he issued the command that brought their boat in toward\r\nthe bank not a dozen paces beyond the spot where I lay.\r\n\r\nHad they pulled in below me they must surely have seen me against the\r\nfaint glow of light ahead, but from where they finally came to rest I\r\nwas as secure from detection as though miles separated us.\r\n\r\nThe few words I had already overheard whetted my curiosity, and I was\r\nanxious to learn what manner of vengeance Thurid was planning against\r\nme. Nor had I long to wait. I listened intently.\r\n\r\n“There are no obligations, Father of Therns,” continued the First Born.\r\n“Thurid, Dator of Issus, has no price. When the thing has been\r\naccomplished I shall be glad if you will see to it that I am well\r\nreceived, as is befitting my ancient lineage and noble rank, at some\r\ncourt that is yet loyal to thy ancient faith, for I cannot return to\r\nthe Valley Dor or elsewhere within the power of the Prince of Helium;\r\nbut even that I do not demand—it shall be as your own desire in the\r\nmatter directs.”\r\n\r\n“It shall be as you wish, Dator,” replied Matai Shang; “nor is that\r\nall—power and riches shall be yours if you restore my daughter,\r\nPhaidor, to me, and place within my power Dejah Thoris, Princess of\r\nHelium.\r\n\r\n“Ah,” he continued with a malicious snarl, “but the Earth man shall\r\nsuffer for the indignities he has put upon the holy of holies, nor\r\nshall any vileness be too vile to inflict upon his princess. Would that\r\nit were in my power to force him to witness the humiliation and\r\ndegradation of the red woman.”\r\n\r\n“You shall have your way with her before another day has passed, Matai\r\nShang,” said Thurid, “if you but say the word.”\r\n\r\n“I have heard of the Temple of the Sun, Dator,” replied Matai Shang,\r\n“but never have I heard that its prisoners could be released before the\r\nallotted year of their incarceration had elapsed. How, then, may you\r\naccomplish the impossible?”\r\n\r\n“Access may be had to any cell of the temple at any time,” replied\r\nThurid. “Only Issus knew this; nor was it ever Issus’ way to divulge\r\nmore of her secrets than were necessary. By chance, after her death, I\r\ncame upon an ancient plan of the temple, and there I found, plainly\r\nwrit, the most minute directions for reaching the cells at any time.\r\n\r\n“And more I learned—that many men had gone thither for Issus in the\r\npast, always on errands of death and torture to the prisoners; but\r\nthose who thus learned the secret way were wont to die mysteriously\r\nimmediately they had returned and made their reports to cruel Issus.”\r\n\r\n“Let us proceed, then,” said Matai Shang at last. “I must trust you,\r\nyet at the same time you must trust me, for we are six to your one.”\r\n\r\n“I do not fear,” replied Thurid, “nor need you. Our hatred of the\r\ncommon enemy is sufficient bond to insure our loyalty to each other,\r\nand after we have defiled the Princess of Helium there will be still\r\ngreater reason for the maintenance of our allegiance—unless I greatly\r\nmistake the temper of her lord.”\r\n\r\nMatai Shang spoke to the paddlers. The boat moved on up the tributary.\r\n\r\nIt was with difficulty that I restrained myself from rushing upon them\r\nand slaying the two vile plotters; but quickly I saw the mad rashness\r\nof such an act, which would cut down the only man who could lead the\r\nway to Dejah Thoris’ prison before the long Martian year had swung its\r\ninterminable circle.\r\n\r\nIf he should lead Matai Shang to that hallowed spot, then, too, should\r\nhe lead John Carter, Prince of Helium.\r\n\r\nWith silent paddle I swung slowly into the wake of the larger craft.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nUNDER THE MOUNTAINS\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we advanced up the river which winds beneath the Golden Cliffs out\r\nof the bowels of the Mountains of Otz to mingle its dark waters with\r\nthe grim and mysterious Iss the faint glow which had appeared before us\r\ngrew gradually into an all-enveloping radiance.\r\n\r\nThe river widened until it presented the aspect of a large lake whose\r\nvaulted dome, lighted by glowing phosphorescent rock, was splashed with\r\nthe vivid rays of the diamond, the sapphire, the ruby, and the\r\ncountless, nameless jewels of Barsoom which lay incrusted in the virgin\r\ngold which forms the major portion of these magnificent cliffs.\r\n\r\nBeyond the lighted chamber of the lake was darkness—what lay behind the\r\ndarkness I could not even guess.\r\n\r\nTo have followed the thern boat across the gleaming water would have\r\nbeen to invite instant detection, and so, though I was loath to permit\r\nThurid to pass even for an instant beyond my sight, I was forced to\r\nwait in the shadows until the other boat had passed from my sight at\r\nthe far extremity of the lake.\r\n\r\nThen I paddled out upon the brilliant surface in the direction they had\r\ntaken.\r\n\r\nWhen, after what seemed an eternity, I reached the shadows at the upper\r\nend of the lake I found that the river issued from a low aperture, to\r\npass beneath which it was necessary that I compel Woola to lie flat in\r\nthe boat, and I, myself, must need bend double before the low roof\r\ncleared my head.\r\n\r\nImmediately the roof rose again upon the other side, but no longer was\r\nthe way brilliantly lighted. Instead only a feeble glow emanated from\r\nsmall and scattered patches of phosphorescent rock in wall and roof.\r\n\r\nDirectly before me the river ran into this smaller chamber through\r\nthree separate arched openings.\r\n\r\nThurid and the therns were nowhere to be seen—into which of the dark\r\nholes had they disappeared? There was no means by which I might know,\r\nand so I chose the center opening as being as likely to lead me in the\r\nright direction as another.\r\n\r\nHere the way was through utter darkness. The stream was narrow—so\r\nnarrow that in the blackness I was constantly bumping first one rock\r\nwall and then another as the river wound hither and thither along its\r\nflinty bed.\r\n\r\nFar ahead I presently heard a deep and sullen roar which increased in\r\nvolume as I advanced, and then broke upon my ears with all the\r\nintensity of its mad fury as I swung round a sharp curve into a dimly\r\nlighted stretch of water.\r\n\r\nDirectly before me the river thundered down from above in a mighty\r\nwaterfall that filled the narrow gorge from side to side, rising far\r\nabove me several hundred feet—as magnificent a spectacle as I ever had\r\nseen.\r\n\r\nBut the roar—the awful, deafening roar of those tumbling waters penned\r\nin the rocky, subterranean vault! Had the fall not entirely blocked my\r\nfurther passage and shown me that I had followed the wrong course I\r\nbelieve that I should have fled anyway before the maddening tumult.\r\n\r\nThurid and the therns could not have come this way. By stumbling upon\r\nthe wrong course I had lost the trail, and they had gained so much\r\nahead of me that now I might not be able to find them before it was too\r\nlate, if, in fact, I could find them at all.\r\n\r\nIt had taken several hours to force my way up to the falls against the\r\nstrong current, and other hours would be required for the descent,\r\nalthough the pace would be much swifter.\r\n\r\nWith a sigh I turned the prow of my craft down stream, and with mighty\r\nstrokes hastened with reckless speed through the dark and tortuous\r\nchannel until once again I came to the chamber into which flowed the\r\nthree branches of the river.\r\n\r\nTwo unexplored channels still remained from which to choose; nor was\r\nthere any means by which I could judge which was the more likely to\r\nlead me to the plotters.\r\n\r\nNever in my life, that I can recall, have I suffered such an agony of\r\nindecision. So much depended upon a correct choice; so much depended\r\nupon haste.\r\n\r\nThe hours that I had already lost might seal the fate of the\r\nincomparable Dejah Thoris were she not already dead—to sacrifice other\r\nhours, and maybe days in a fruitless exploration of another blind lead\r\nwould unquestionably prove fatal.\r\n\r\nSeveral times I essayed the right-hand entrance only to turn back as\r\nthough warned by some strange intuitive sense that this was not the\r\nway. At last, convinced by the oft-recurring phenomenon, I cast my all\r\nupon the left-hand archway; yet it was with a lingering doubt that I\r\nturned a parting look at the sullen waters which rolled, dark and\r\nforbidding, from beneath the grim, low archway on the right.\r\n\r\nAnd as I looked there came bobbing out upon the current from the\r\nStygian darkness of the interior the shell of one of the great,\r\nsucculent fruits of the sorapus tree.\r\n\r\nI could scarce restrain a shout of elation as this silent, insensate\r\nmessenger floated past me, on toward the Iss and Korus, for it told me\r\nthat journeying Martians were above me on that very stream.\r\n\r\nThey had eaten of this marvelous fruit which nature concentrates within\r\nthe hard shell of the sorapus nut, and having eaten had cast the husk\r\noverboard. It could have come from no others than the party I sought.\r\n\r\nQuickly I abandoned all thought of the left-hand passage, and a moment\r\nlater had turned into the right. The stream soon widened, and recurring\r\nareas of phosphorescent rock lighted my way.\r\n\r\nI made good time, but was convinced that I was nearly a day behind\r\nthose I was tracking. Neither Woola nor I had eaten since the previous\r\nday, but in so far as he was concerned it mattered but little, since\r\npractically all the animals of the dead sea bottoms of Mars are able to\r\ngo for incredible periods without nourishment.\r\n\r\nNor did I suffer. The water of the river was sweet and cold, for it was\r\nunpolluted by decaying bodies—like the Iss—and as for food, why the\r\nmere thought that I was nearing my beloved princess raised me above\r\nevery material want.\r\n\r\nAs I proceeded, the river became narrower and the current swift and\r\nturbulent—so swift in fact that it was with difficulty that I forced my\r\ncraft upward at all. I could not have been making to exceed a hundred\r\nyards an hour when, at a bend, I was confronted by a series of rapids\r\nthrough which the river foamed and boiled at a terrific rate.\r\n\r\nMy heart sank within me. The sorapus nutshell had proved a false\r\nprophet, and, after all, my intuition had been correct—it was the\r\nleft-hand channel that I should have followed.\r\n\r\nHad I been a woman I should have wept. At my right was a great,\r\nslow-moving eddy that circled far beneath the cliff’s overhanging side,\r\nand to rest my tired muscles before turning back I let my boat drift\r\ninto its embrace.\r\n\r\nI was almost prostrated by disappointment. It would mean another\r\nhalf-day’s loss of time to retrace my way and take the only passage\r\nthat yet remained unexplored. What hellish fate had led me to select\r\nfrom three possible avenues the two that were wrong?\r\n\r\nAs the lazy current of the eddy carried me slowly about the periphery\r\nof the watery circle my boat twice touched the rocky side of the river\r\nin the dark recess beneath the cliff. A third time it struck, gently as\r\nit had before, but the contact resulted in a different sound—the sound\r\nof wood scraping upon wood.\r\n\r\nIn an instant I was on the alert, for there could be no wood within\r\nthat buried river that had not been man brought. Almost coincidentally\r\nwith my first apprehension of the noise, my hand shot out across the\r\nboat’s side, and a second later I felt my fingers gripping the gunwale\r\nof another craft.\r\n\r\nAs though turned to stone I sat in tense and rigid silence, straining\r\nmy eyes into the utter darkness before me in an effort to discover if\r\nthe boat were occupied.\r\n\r\nIt was entirely possible that there might be men on board it who were\r\nstill ignorant of my presence, for the boat was scraping gently against\r\nthe rocks upon one side, so that the gentle touch of my boat upon the\r\nother easily could have gone unnoticed.\r\n\r\nPeer as I would I could not penetrate the darkness, and then I listened\r\nintently for the sound of breathing near me; but except for the noise\r\nof the rapids, the soft scraping of the boats, and the lapping of the\r\nwater at their sides I could distinguish no sound. As usual, I thought\r\nrapidly.\r\n\r\nA rope lay coiled in the bottom of my own craft. Very softly I gathered\r\nit up, and making one end fast to the bronze ring in the prow I stepped\r\ngingerly into the boat beside me. In one hand I grasped the rope, in\r\nthe other my keen long-sword.\r\n\r\nFor a full minute, perhaps, I stood motionless after entering the\r\nstrange craft. It had rocked a trifle beneath my weight, but it had\r\nbeen the scraping of its side against the side of my own boat that had\r\nseemed most likely to alarm its occupants, if there were any.\r\n\r\nBut there was no answering sound, and a moment later I had felt from\r\nstem to stern and found the boat deserted.\r\n\r\nGroping with my hands along the face of the rocks to which the craft\r\nwas moored, I discovered a narrow ledge which I knew must be the avenue\r\ntaken by those who had come before me. That they could be none other\r\nthan Thurid and his party I was convinced by the size and build of the\r\nboat I had found.\r\n\r\nCalling to Woola to follow me I stepped out upon the ledge. The great,\r\nsavage brute, agile as a cat, crept after me.\r\n\r\nAs he passed through the boat that had been occupied by Thurid and the\r\ntherns he emitted a single low growl, and when he came beside me upon\r\nthe ledge and my hand rested upon his neck I felt his short mane\r\nbristling with anger. I think he sensed telepathically the recent\r\npresence of an enemy, for I had made no effort to impart to him the\r\nnature of our quest or the status of those we tracked.\r\n\r\nThis omission I now made haste to correct, and, after the manner of\r\ngreen Martians with their beasts, I let him know partially by the weird\r\nand uncanny telepathy of Barsoom and partly by word of mouth that we\r\nwere upon the trail of those who had recently occupied the boat through\r\nwhich we had just passed.\r\n\r\nA soft purr, like that of a great cat, indicated that Woola understood,\r\nand then, with a word to him to follow, I turned to the right along the\r\nledge, but scarcely had I done so than I felt his mighty fangs tugging\r\nat my leathern harness.\r\n\r\nAs I turned to discover the cause of his act he continued to pull me\r\nsteadily in the opposite direction, nor would he desist until I had\r\nturned about and indicated that I would follow him voluntarily.\r\n\r\nNever had I known him to be in error in a matter of tracking, so it was\r\nwith a feeling of entire security that I moved cautiously in the huge\r\nbeast’s wake. Through Cimmerian darkness he moved along the narrow\r\nledge beside the boiling rapids.\r\n\r\nAs we advanced, the way led from beneath the overhanging cliffs out\r\ninto a dim light, and then it was that I saw that the trail had been\r\ncut from the living rock, and that it ran up along the river’s side\r\nbeyond the rapids.\r\n\r\nFor hours we followed the dark and gloomy river farther and farther\r\ninto the bowels of Mars. From the direction and distance I knew that we\r\nmust be well beneath the Valley Dor, and possibly beneath the Sea of\r\nOmean as well—it could not be much farther now to the Temple of the\r\nSun.\r\n\r\nEven as my mind framed the thought, Woola halted suddenly before a\r\nnarrow, arched doorway in the cliff by the trail’s side. Quickly he\r\ncrouched back away from the entrance, at the same time turning his eyes\r\ntoward me.\r\n\r\nWords could not have more plainly told me that danger of some sort lay\r\nnear by, and so I pressed quietly forward to his side, and passing him\r\nlooked into the aperture at our right.\r\n\r\nBefore me was a fair-sized chamber that, from its appointments, I knew\r\nmust have at one time been a guardroom. There were racks for weapons,\r\nand slightly raised platforms for the sleeping silks and furs of the\r\nwarriors, but now its only occupants were two of the therns who had\r\nbeen of the party with Thurid and Matai Shang.\r\n\r\nThe men were in earnest conversation, and from their tones it was\r\napparent that they were entirely unaware that they had listeners.\r\n\r\n“I tell you,” one of them was saying, “I do not trust the black one.\r\nThere was no necessity for leaving us here to guard the way. Against\r\nwhat, pray, should we guard this long-forgotten, abysmal path? It was\r\nbut a ruse to divide our numbers.\r\n\r\n“He will have Matai Shang leave others elsewhere on some pretext or\r\nother, and then at last he will fall upon us with his confederates and\r\nslay us all.”\r\n\r\n“I believe you, Lakor,” replied the other, “there can never be aught\r\nelse than deadly hatred between thern and First Born. And what think\r\nyou of the ridiculous matter of the light? ‘Let the light shine with\r\nthe intensity of three radium units for fifty tals, and for one xat let\r\nit shine with the intensity of one radium unit, and then for\r\ntwenty-five tals with nine units.’ Those were his very words, and to\r\nthink that wise old Matai Shang should listen to such foolishness.”\r\n\r\n“Indeed, it is silly,” replied Lakor. “It will open nothing other than\r\nthe way to a quick death for us all. He had to make some answer when\r\nMatai Shang asked him flatly what he should do when he came to the\r\nTemple of the Sun, and so he made his answer quickly from his\r\nimagination—I would wager a hekkador’s diadem that he could not now\r\nrepeat it himself.”\r\n\r\n“Let us not remain here longer, Lakor,” spoke the other thern.\r\n“Perchance if we hasten after them we may come in time to rescue Matai\r\nShang, and wreak our own vengeance upon the black dator. What say you?”\r\n\r\n“Never in a long life,” answered Lakor, “have I disobeyed a single\r\ncommand of the Father of Therns. I shall stay here until I rot if he\r\ndoes not return to bid me elsewhere.”\r\n\r\nLakor’s companion shook his head.\r\n\r\n“You are my superior,” he said; “I cannot do other than you sanction,\r\nthough I still believe that we are foolish to remain.”\r\n\r\nI, too, thought that they were foolish to remain, for I saw from\r\nWoola’s actions that the trail led through the room where the two\r\ntherns held guard. I had no reason to harbor any considerable love for\r\nthis race of self-deified demons, yet I would have passed them by were\r\nit possible without molesting them.\r\n\r\nIt was worth trying anyway, for a fight might delay us considerably, or\r\neven put an end entirely to my search—better men than I have gone down\r\nbefore fighters of meaner ability than that possessed by the fierce\r\nthern warriors.\r\n\r\nSignaling Woola to heel I stepped suddenly into the room before the two\r\nmen. At sight of me their long-swords flashed from the harness at their\r\nsides, but I raised my hand in a gesture of restraint.\r\n\r\n“I seek Thurid, the black dator,” I said. “My quarrel is with him, not\r\nwith you. Let me pass then in peace, for if I mistake not he is as much\r\nyour enemy as mine, and you can have no cause to protect him.”\r\n\r\nThey lowered their swords and Lakor spoke.\r\n\r\n“I know not whom you may be, with the white skin of a thern and the\r\nblack hair of a red man; but were it only Thurid whose safety were at\r\nstake you might pass, and welcome, in so far as we be concerned.\r\n\r\n“Tell us who you be, and what mission calls you to this unknown world\r\nbeneath the Valley Dor, then maybe we can see our way to let you pass\r\nupon the errand which we should like to undertake would our orders\r\npermit.”\r\n\r\nI was surprised that neither of them had recognized me, for I thought\r\nthat I was quite sufficiently well known either by personal experience\r\nor reputation to every thern upon Barsoom as to make my identity\r\nimmediately apparent in any part of the planet. In fact, I was the only\r\nwhite man upon Mars whose hair was black and whose eyes were gray, with\r\nthe exception of my son, Carthoris.\r\n\r\nTo reveal my identity might be to precipitate an attack, for every\r\nthern upon Barsoom knew that to me they owed the fall of their age-old\r\nspiritual supremacy. On the other hand my reputation as a fighting man\r\nmight be sufficient to pass me by these two were their livers not of\r\nthe right complexion to welcome a battle to the death.\r\n\r\nTo be quite candid I did not attempt to delude myself with any such\r\nsophistry, since I knew well that upon war-like Mars there are few\r\ncowards, and that every man, whether prince, priest, or peasant,\r\nglories in deadly strife. And so I gripped my long-sword the tighter as\r\nI replied to Lakor.\r\n\r\n“I believe that you will see the wisdom of permitting me to pass\r\nunmolested,” I said, “for it would avail you nothing to die uselessly\r\nin the rocky bowels of Barsoom merely to protect a hereditary enemy,\r\nsuch as Thurid, Dator of the First Born.\r\n\r\n“That you shall die should you elect to oppose me is evidenced by the\r\nmoldering corpses of all the many great Barsoomian warriors who have\r\ngone down beneath this blade—I am John Carter, Prince of Helium.”\r\n\r\nFor a moment that name seemed to paralyze the two men; but only for a\r\nmoment, and then the younger of them, with a vile name upon his lips,\r\nrushed toward me with ready sword.\r\n\r\nHe had been standing a little behind his companion, Lakor, during our\r\nparley, and now, ere he could engage me, the older man grasped his\r\nharness and drew him back.\r\n\r\n“Hold!” commanded Lakor. “There will be plenty of time to fight if we\r\nfind it wise to fight at all. There be good reasons why every thern\r\nupon Barsoom should yearn to spill the blood of the blasphemer, the\r\nsacrilegist; but let us mix wisdom with our righteous hate. The Prince\r\nof Helium is bound upon an errand which we ourselves, but a moment\r\nsince, were wishing that we might undertake.\r\n\r\n“Let him go then and slay the black. When he returns we shall still be\r\nhere to bar his way to the outer world, and thus we shall have rid\r\nourselves of two enemies, nor have incurred the displeasure of the\r\nFather of Therns.”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke I could not but note the crafty glint in his evil eyes, and\r\nwhile I saw the apparent logic of his reasoning I felt, subconsciously\r\nperhaps, that his words did but veil some sinister intent. The other\r\nthern turned toward him in evident surprise, but when Lakor had\r\nwhispered a few brief words into his ear he, too, drew back and nodded\r\nacquiescence to his superior’s suggestion.\r\n\r\n“Proceed, John Carter,” said Lakor; “but know that if Thurid does not\r\nlay you low there will be those awaiting your return who will see that\r\nyou never pass again into the sunlight of the upper world. Go!”\r\n\r\nDuring our conversation Woola had been growling and bristling close to\r\nmy side. Occasionally he would look up into my face with a low,\r\npleading whine, as though begging for the word that would send him\r\nheadlong at the bare throats before him. He, too, sensed the villainy\r\nbehind the smooth words.\r\n\r\nBeyond the therns several doorways opened off the guardroom, and toward\r\nthe one upon the extreme right Lakor motioned.\r\n\r\n“That way leads to Thurid,” he said.\r\n\r\nBut when I would have called Woola to follow me there the beast whined\r\nand held back, and at last ran quickly to the first opening at the\r\nleft, where he stood emitting his coughing bark, as though urging me to\r\nfollow him upon the right way.\r\n\r\nI turned a questioning look upon Lakor.\r\n\r\n“The brute is seldom wrong,” I said, “and while I do not doubt your\r\nsuperior knowledge, Thern, I think that I shall do well to listen to\r\nthe voice of instinct that is backed by love and loyalty.”\r\n\r\nAs I spoke I smiled grimly that he might know without words that I\r\ndistrusted him.\r\n\r\n“As you will,” the fellow replied with a shrug. “In the end it shall be\r\nall the same.”\r\n\r\nI turned and followed Woola into the left-hand passage, and though my\r\nback was toward my enemies, my ears were on the alert; yet I heard no\r\nsound of pursuit. The passageway was dimly lighted by occasional radium\r\nbulbs, the universal lighting medium of Barsoom.\r\n\r\nThese same lamps may have been doing continuous duty in these\r\nsubterranean chambers for ages, since they require no attention and are\r\nso compounded that they give off but the minutest of their substance in\r\nthe generation of years of luminosity.\r\n\r\nWe had proceeded for but a short distance when we commenced to pass the\r\nmouths of diverging corridors, but not once did Woola hesitate. It was\r\nat the opening to one of these corridors upon my right that I presently\r\nheard a sound that spoke more plainly to John Carter, fighting man,\r\nthan could the words of my mother tongue—it was the clank of metal—the\r\nmetal of a warrior’s harness—and it came from a little distance up the\r\ncorridor upon my right.\r\n\r\nWoola heard it, too, and like a flash he had wheeled and stood facing\r\nthe threatened danger, his mane all abristle and all his rows of\r\nglistening fangs bared by snarling, backdrawn lips. With a gesture I\r\nsilenced him, and together we drew aside into another corridor a few\r\npaces farther on.\r\n\r\nHere we waited; nor did we have long to wait, for presently we saw the\r\nshadows of two men fall upon the floor of the main corridor athwart the\r\ndoorway of our hiding place. Very cautiously they were moving now—the\r\naccidental clank that had alarmed me was not repeated.\r\n\r\nPresently they came opposite our station; nor was I surprised to see\r\nthat the two were Lakor and his companion of the guardroom.\r\n\r\nThey walked very softly, and in the right hand of each gleamed a keen\r\nlong-sword. They halted quite close to the entrance of our retreat,\r\nwhispering to each other.\r\n\r\n“Can it be that we have distanced them already?” said Lakor.\r\n\r\n“Either that or the beast has led the man upon a wrong trail,” replied\r\nthe other, “for the way which we took is by far the shorter to this\r\npoint—for him who knows it. John Carter would have found it a short\r\nroad to death had he taken it as you suggested to him.”\r\n\r\n“Yes,” said Lakor, “no amount of fighting ability would have saved him\r\nfrom the pivoted flagstone. He surely would have stepped upon it, and\r\nby now, if the pit beneath it has a bottom, which Thurid denies, he\r\nshould have been rapidly approaching it. Curses on that calot of his\r\nthat warned him toward the safer avenue!”\r\n\r\n“There be other dangers ahead of him, though,” spoke Lakor’s fellow,\r\n“which he may not so easily escape—should he succeed in escaping our\r\ntwo good swords. Consider, for example, what chance he will have,\r\ncoming unexpectedly into the chamber of—”\r\n\r\nI would have given much to have heard the balance of that conversation\r\nthat I might have been warned of the perils that lay ahead, but fate\r\nintervened, and just at the very instant of all other instants that I\r\nwould not have elected to do it, I sneezed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TEMPLE OF THE SUN\r\n\r\n\r\nThere was nothing for it now other than to fight; nor did I have any\r\nadvantage as I sprang, sword in hand, into the corridor before the two\r\ntherns, for my untimely sneeze had warned them of my presence and they\r\nwere ready for me.\r\n\r\nThere were no words, for they would have been a waste of breath. The\r\nvery presence of the two proclaimed their treachery. That they were\r\nfollowing to fall upon me unawares was all too plain, and they, of\r\ncourse, must have known that I understood their plan.\r\n\r\nIn an instant I was engaged with both, and though I loathe the very\r\nname of thern, I must in all fairness admit that they are mighty\r\nswordsmen; and these two were no exception, unless it were that they\r\nwere even more skilled and fearless than the average among their race.\r\n\r\nWhile it lasted it was indeed as joyous a conflict as I ever had\r\nexperienced. Twice at least I saved my breast from the mortal thrust of\r\npiercing steel only by the wondrous agility with which my earthly\r\nmuscles endow me under the conditions of lesser gravity and air\r\npressure upon Mars.\r\n\r\nYet even so I came near to tasting death that day in the gloomy\r\ncorridor beneath Mars’s southern pole, for Lakor played a trick upon me\r\nthat in all my experience of fighting upon two planets I never before\r\nhad witnessed the like of.\r\n\r\nThe other thern was engaging me at the time, and I was forcing him\r\nback—touching him here and there with my point until he was bleeding\r\nfrom a dozen wounds, yet not being able to penetrate his marvelous\r\nguard to reach a vulnerable spot for the brief instant that would have\r\nbeen sufficient to send him to his ancestors.\r\n\r\nIt was then that Lakor quickly unslung a belt from his harness, and as\r\nI stepped back to parry a wicked thrust he lashed one end of it about\r\nmy left ankle so that it wound there for an instant, while he jerked\r\nsuddenly upon the other end, throwing me heavily upon my back.\r\n\r\nThen, like leaping panthers, they were upon me; but they had reckoned\r\nwithout Woola, and before ever a blade touched me, a roaring embodiment\r\nof a thousand demons hurtled above my prostrate form and my loyal\r\nMartian calot was upon them.\r\n\r\nImagine, if you can, a huge grizzly with ten legs armed with mighty\r\ntalons and an enormous froglike mouth splitting his head from ear to\r\near, exposing three rows of long, white tusks. Then endow this creature\r\nof your imagination with the agility and ferocity of a half-starved\r\nBengal tiger and the strength of a span of bulls, and you will have\r\nsome faint conception of Woola in action.\r\n\r\nBefore I could call him off he had crushed Lakor into a jelly with a\r\nsingle blow of one mighty paw, and had literally torn the other thern\r\nto ribbons; yet when I spoke to him sharply he cowed sheepishly as\r\nthough he had done a thing to deserve censure and chastisement.\r\n\r\nNever had I had the heart to punish Woola during the long years that\r\nhad passed since that first day upon Mars when the green jed of the\r\nTharks had placed him on guard over me, and I had won his love and\r\nloyalty from the cruel and loveless masters of his former life, yet I\r\nbelieve he would have submitted to any cruelty that I might have\r\ninflicted upon him, so wondrous was his affection for me.\r\n\r\nThe diadem in the center of the circlet of gold upon the brow of Lakor\r\nproclaimed him a Holy Thern, while his companion, not thus adorned, was\r\na lesser thern, though from his harness I gleaned that he had reached\r\nthe Ninth Cycle, which is but one below that of the Holy Therns.\r\n\r\nAs I stood for a moment looking at the gruesome havoc Woola had\r\nwrought, there recurred to me the memory of that other occasion upon\r\nwhich I had masqueraded in the wig, diadem, and harness of Sator Throg,\r\nthe Holy Thern whom Thuvia of Ptarth had slain, and now it occurred to\r\nme that it might prove of worth to utilize Lakor’s trappings for the\r\nsame purpose.\r\n\r\nA moment later I had torn his yellow wig from his bald pate and\r\ntransferred it and the circlet, as well as all his harness, to my own\r\nperson.\r\n\r\nWoola did not approve of the metamorphosis. He sniffed at me and\r\ngrowled ominously, but when I spoke to him and patted his huge head he\r\nat length became reconciled to the change, and at my command trotted\r\noff along the corridor in the direction we had been going when our\r\nprogress had been interrupted by the therns.\r\n\r\nWe moved cautiously now, warned by the fragment of conversation I had\r\noverheard. I kept abreast of Woola that we might have the benefit of\r\nall our eyes for what might appear suddenly ahead to menace us, and\r\nwell it was that we were forewarned.\r\n\r\nAt the bottom of a flight of narrow steps the corridor turned sharply\r\nback upon itself, immediately making another turn in the original\r\ndirection, so that at that point it formed a perfect letter S, the top\r\nleg of which debouched suddenly into a large chamber, illy lighted, and\r\nthe floor of which was completely covered by venomous snakes and\r\nloathsome reptiles.\r\n\r\nTo have attempted to cross that floor would have been to court instant\r\ndeath, and for a moment I was almost completely discouraged. Then it\r\noccurred to me that Thurid and Matai Shang with their party must have\r\ncrossed it, and so there was a way.\r\n\r\nHad it not been for the fortunate accident by which I overheard even so\r\nsmall a portion of the therns’ conversation we should have blundered at\r\nleast a step or two into that wriggling mass of destruction, and a\r\nsingle step would have been all-sufficient to have sealed our doom.\r\n\r\nThese were the only reptiles I had ever seen upon Barsoom, but I knew\r\nfrom their similarity to the fossilized remains of supposedly extinct\r\nspecies I had seen in the museums of Helium that they comprised many of\r\nthe known prehistoric reptilian genera, as well as others undiscovered.\r\n\r\nA more hideous aggregation of monsters had never before assailed my\r\nvision. It would be futile to attempt to describe them to Earth men,\r\nsince substance is the only thing which they possess in common with any\r\ncreature of the past or present with which you are familiar—even their\r\nvenom is of an unearthly virulence that, by comparison, would make the\r\ncobra de capello seem quite as harmless as an angleworm.\r\n\r\nAs they spied me there was a concerted rush by those nearest the\r\nentrance where we stood, but a line of radium bulbs inset along the\r\nthreshold of their chamber brought them to a sudden halt—evidently they\r\ndared not cross that line of light.\r\n\r\nI had been quite sure that they would not venture beyond the room in\r\nwhich I had discovered them, though I had not guessed at what deterred\r\nthem. The simple fact that we had found no reptiles in the corridor\r\nthrough which we had just come was sufficient assurance that they did\r\nnot venture there.\r\n\r\nI drew Woola out of harm’s way, and then began a careful survey of as\r\nmuch of the Chamber of Reptiles as I could see from where I stood. As\r\nmy eyes became accustomed to the dim light of its interior I gradually\r\nmade out a low gallery at the far end of the apartment from which\r\nopened several exits.\r\n\r\nComing as close to the threshold as I dared, I followed this gallery\r\nwith my eyes, discovering that it circled the room as far as I could\r\nsee. Then I glanced above me along the upper edge of the entrance to\r\nwhich we had come, and there, to my delight, I saw an end of the\r\ngallery not a foot above my head. In an instant I had leaped to it and\r\ncalled Woola after me.\r\n\r\nHere there were no reptiles—the way was clear to the opposite side of\r\nthe hideous chamber—and a moment later Woola and I dropped down to\r\nsafety in the corridor beyond.\r\n\r\nNot ten minutes later we came into a vast circular apartment of white\r\nmarble, the walls of which were inlaid with gold in the strange\r\nhieroglyphics of the First Born.\r\n\r\nFrom the high dome of this mighty apartment a huge circular column\r\nextended to the floor, and as I watched I saw that it slowly revolved.\r\n\r\nI had reached the base of the Temple of the Sun!\r\n\r\nSomewhere above me lay Dejah Thoris, and with her were Phaidor,\r\ndaughter of Matai Shang, and Thuvia of Ptarth. But how to reach them,\r\nnow that I had found the only vulnerable spot in their mighty prison,\r\nwas still a baffling riddle.\r\n\r\nSlowly I circled the great shaft, looking for a means of ingress. Part\r\nway around I found a tiny radium flash torch, and as I examined it in\r\nmild curiosity as to its presence there in this almost inaccessible and\r\nunknown spot, I came suddenly upon the insignia of the house of Thurid\r\njewel-inset in its metal case.\r\n\r\nI am upon the right trail, I thought, as I slipped the bauble into the\r\npocket-pouch which hung from my harness. Then I continued my search for\r\nthe entrance, which I knew must be somewhere about; nor had I long to\r\nsearch, for almost immediately thereafter I came upon a small door so\r\ncunningly inlaid in the shaft’s base that it might have passed\r\nunnoticed by a less keen or careful observer.\r\n\r\nThere was the door that would lead me within the prison, but where was\r\nthe means to open it? No button or lock were visible. Again and again I\r\nwent carefully over every square inch of its surface, but the most that\r\nI could find was a tiny pinhole a little above and to the right of the\r\ndoor’s center—a pinhole that seemed only an accident of manufacture or\r\nan imperfection of material.\r\n\r\nInto this minute aperture I attempted to peer, but whether it was but a\r\nfraction of an inch deep or passed completely through the door I could\r\nnot tell—at least no light showed beyond it. I put my ear to it next\r\nand listened, but again my efforts brought negligible results.\r\n\r\nDuring these experiments Woola had been standing at my side gazing\r\nintently at the door, and as my glance fell upon him it occurred to me\r\nto test the correctness of my hypothesis, that this portal had been the\r\nmeans of ingress to the temple used by Thurid, the black dator, and\r\nMatai Shang, Father of Therns.\r\n\r\nTurning away abruptly, I called to him to follow me. For a moment he\r\nhesitated, and then leaped after me, whining and tugging at my harness\r\nto draw me back. I walked on, however, some distance from the door\r\nbefore I let him have his way, that I might see precisely what he would\r\ndo. Then I permitted him to lead me wherever he would.\r\n\r\nStraight back to that baffling portal he dragged me, again taking up\r\nhis position facing the blank stone, gazing straight at its shining\r\nsurface. For an hour I worked to solve the mystery of the combination\r\nthat would open the way before me.\r\n\r\nCarefully I recalled every circumstance of my pursuit of Thurid, and my\r\nconclusion was identical with my original belief—that Thurid had come\r\nthis way without other assistance than his own knowledge and passed\r\nthrough the door that barred my progress, unaided from within. But how\r\nhad he accomplished it?\r\n\r\nI recalled the incident of the Chamber of Mystery in the Golden Cliffs\r\nthat time I had freed Thuvia of Ptarth from the dungeon of the therns,\r\nand she had taken a slender, needle-like key from the keyring of her\r\ndead jailer to open the door leading back into the Chamber of Mystery\r\nwhere Tars Tarkas fought for his life with the great banths. Such a\r\ntiny keyhole as now defied me had opened the way to the intricate lock\r\nin that other door.\r\n\r\nHastily I dumped the contents of my pocket-pouch upon the ground before\r\nme. Could I but find a slender bit of steel I might yet fashion a key\r\nthat would give me ingress to the temple prison.\r\n\r\nAs I examined the heterogeneous collection of odds and ends that is\r\nalways to be found in the pocket-pouch of a Martian warrior my hand\r\nfell upon the emblazoned radium flash torch of the black dator.\r\n\r\nAs I was about to lay the thing aside as of no value in my present\r\npredicament my eyes chanced upon a few strange characters roughly and\r\nfreshly scratched upon the soft gold of the case.\r\n\r\nCasual curiosity prompted me to decipher them, but what I read carried\r\nno immediate meaning to my mind. There were three sets of characters,\r\none below another:\r\n\r\n3\t|—|\t50 T 1\t|—|\t  1 X 9\t|—|\t25 T\r\n\r\nFor only an instant my curiosity was piqued, and then I replaced the\r\ntorch in my pocket-pouch, but my fingers had not unclasped from it when\r\nthere rushed to my memory the recollection of the conversation between\r\nLakor and his companion when the lesser thern had quoted the words of\r\nThurid and scoffed at them: “And what think you of the ridiculous\r\nmatter of the light? Let the light shine with the intensity of three\r\nradium units for fifty tals”—ah, there was the first line of characters\r\nupon the torch’s metal case—3—50 T; “and for one xat let it shine with\r\nthe intensity of one radium unit”—there was the second line; “and then\r\nfor twenty-five tals with nine units.”\r\n\r\nThe formula was complete; but—what did it mean?\r\n\r\nI thought I knew, and, seizing a powerful magnifying glass from the\r\nlitter of my pocket-pouch, I applied myself to a careful examination of\r\nthe marble immediately about the pinhole in the door. I could have\r\ncried aloud in exultation when my scrutiny disclosed the almost\r\ninvisible incrustation of particles of carbonized electrons which are\r\nthrown off by these Martian torches.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that for countless ages radium torches had been applied\r\nto this pinhole, and for what purpose there could be but a single\r\nanswer—the mechanism of the lock was actuated by light rays; and I,\r\nJohn Carter, Prince of Helium, held the combination in my\r\nhand—scratched by the hand of my enemy upon his own torch case.\r\n\r\nIn a cylindrical bracelet of gold about my wrist was my Barsoomian\r\nchronometer—a delicate instrument that records the tals and xats and\r\nzodes of Martian time, presenting them to view beneath a strong crystal\r\nmuch after the manner of an earthly odometer.\r\n\r\nTiming my operations carefully, I held the torch to the small aperture\r\nin the door, regulating the intensity of the light by means of the\r\nthumb-lever upon the side of the case.\r\n\r\nFor fifty tals I let three units of light shine full in the pinhole,\r\nthen one unit for one xat, and for twenty-five tals nine units. Those\r\nlast twenty-five tals were the longest twenty-five seconds of my life.\r\nWould the lock click at the end of those seemingly interminable\r\nintervals of time?\r\n\r\nTwenty-three! Twenty-four! Twenty-five!\r\n\r\nI shut off the light with a snap. For seven tals I waited—there had\r\nbeen no appreciable effect upon the lock’s mechanism. Could it be that\r\nmy theory was entirely wrong?\r\n\r\nHold! Had the nervous strain resulted in a hallucination, or did the\r\ndoor really move? Slowly the solid stone sank noiselessly back into the\r\nwall—there was no hallucination here.\r\n\r\nBack and back it slid for ten feet until it had disclosed at its right\r\na narrow doorway leading into a dark and narrow corridor that\r\nparalleled the outer wall. Scarcely was the entrance uncovered than\r\nWoola and I had leaped through—then the door slipped quietly back into\r\nplace.\r\n\r\nDown the corridor at some distance I saw the faint reflection of a\r\nlight, and toward this we made our way. At the point where the light\r\nshone was a sharp turn, and a little distance beyond this a brilliantly\r\nlighted chamber.\r\n\r\nHere we discovered a spiral stairway leading up from the center of the\r\ncircular room.\r\n\r\nImmediately I knew that we had reached the center of the base of the\r\nTemple of the Sun—the spiral runway led upward past the inner walls of\r\nthe prison cells. Somewhere above me was Dejah Thoris, unless Thurid\r\nand Matai Shang had already succeeded in stealing her.\r\n\r\nWe had scarcely started up the runway when Woola suddenly displayed the\r\nwildest excitement. He leaped back and forth, snapping at my legs and\r\nharness, until I thought that he was mad, and finally when I pushed him\r\nfrom me and started once more to ascend he grasped my sword arm between\r\nhis jaws and dragged me back.\r\n\r\nNo amount of scolding or cuffing would suffice to make him release me,\r\nand I was entirely at the mercy of his brute strength unless I cared to\r\nuse my dagger upon him with my left hand; but, mad or no, I had not the\r\nheart to run the sharp blade into that faithful body.\r\n\r\nDown into the chamber he dragged me, and across it to the side opposite\r\nthat at which we had entered. Here was another doorway leading into a\r\ncorridor which ran directly down a steep incline. Without a moment’s\r\nhesitation Woola jerked me along this rocky passage.\r\n\r\nPresently he stopped and released me, standing between me and the way\r\nwe had come, looking up into my face as though to ask if I would now\r\nfollow him voluntarily or if he must still resort to force.\r\n\r\nLooking ruefully at the marks of his great teeth upon my bare arm I\r\ndecided to do as he seemed to wish me to do. After all, his strange\r\ninstinct might be more dependable than my faulty human judgment.\r\n\r\nAnd well it was that I had been forced to follow him. But a short\r\ndistance from the circular chamber we came suddenly into a brilliantly\r\nlighted labyrinth of crystal glass partitioned passages.\r\n\r\nAt first I thought it was one vast, unbroken chamber, so clear and\r\ntransparent were the walls of the winding corridors, but after I had\r\nnearly brained myself a couple of times by attempting to pass through\r\nsolid vitreous walls I went more carefully.\r\n\r\nWe had proceeded but a few yards along the corridor that had given us\r\nentrance to this strange maze when Woola gave mouth to a most frightful\r\nroar, at the same time dashing against the clear partition at our left.\r\n\r\nThe resounding echoes of that fearsome cry were still reverberating\r\nthrough the subterranean chambers when I saw the thing that had\r\nstartled it from the faithful beast.\r\n\r\nFar in the distance, dimly through the many thicknesses of intervening\r\ncrystal, as in a haze that made them seem unreal and ghostly, I\r\ndiscerned the figures of eight people—three females and five men.\r\n\r\nAt the same instant, evidently startled by Woola’s fierce cry, they\r\nhalted and looked about. Then, of a sudden, one of them, a woman, held\r\nher arms out toward me, and even at that great distance I could see\r\nthat her lips moved—it was Dejah Thoris, my ever beautiful and ever\r\nyouthful Princess of Helium.\r\n\r\nWith her were Thuvia of Ptarth, Phaidor, daughter of Matai Shang, and\r\nThurid, and the Father of Therns, and the three lesser therns that had\r\naccompanied them.\r\n\r\nThurid shook his fist at me, and then two of the therns grasped Dejah\r\nThoris and Thuvia roughly by their arms and hurried them on. A moment\r\nlater they had disappeared into a stone corridor beyond the labyrinth\r\nof glass.\r\n\r\nThey say that love is blind; but so great a love as that of Dejah\r\nThoris that knew me even beneath the thern disguise I wore and across\r\nthe misty vista of that crystal maze must indeed be far from blind.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SECRET TOWER\r\n\r\n\r\nI have no stomach to narrate the monotonous events of the tedious days\r\nthat Woola and I spent ferreting our way across the labyrinth of glass,\r\nthrough the dark and devious ways beyond that led beneath the Valley\r\nDor and Golden Cliffs to emerge at last upon the flank of the Otz\r\nMountains just above the Valley of Lost Souls—that pitiful purgatory\r\npeopled by the poor unfortunates who dare not continue their abandoned\r\npilgrimage to Dor, or return to the various lands of the outer world\r\nfrom whence they came.\r\n\r\nHere the trail of Dejah Thoris’ abductors led along the mountains’\r\nbase, across steep and rugged ravines, by the side of appalling\r\nprecipices, and sometimes out into the valley, where we found fighting\r\naplenty with the members of the various tribes that make up the\r\npopulation of this vale of hopelessness.\r\n\r\nBut through it all we came at last to where the way led up a narrow\r\ngorge that grew steeper and more impracticable at every step until\r\nbefore us loomed a mighty fortress buried beneath the side of an\r\noverhanging cliff.\r\n\r\nHere was the secret hiding place of Matai Shang, Father of Therns.\r\nHere, surrounded by a handful of the faithful, the hekkador of the\r\nancient faith, who had once been served by millions of vassals and\r\ndependents, dispensed the spiritual words among the half dozen nations\r\nof Barsoom that still clung tenaciously to their false and discredited\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nDarkness was just falling as we came in sight of the seemingly\r\nimpregnable walls of this mountain stronghold, and lest we be seen I\r\ndrew back with Woola behind a jutting granite promontory, into a clump\r\nof the hardy, purple scrub that thrives upon the barren sides of Otz.\r\n\r\nHere we lay until the quick transition from daylight to darkness had\r\npassed. Then I crept out to approach the fortress walls in search of a\r\nway within.\r\n\r\nEither through carelessness or over-confidence in the supposed\r\ninaccessibility of their hiding place, the triple-barred gate stood\r\najar. Beyond were a handful of guards, laughing and talking over one of\r\ntheir incomprehensible Barsoomian games.\r\n\r\nI saw that none of the guardsmen had been of the party that accompanied\r\nThurid and Matai Shang; and so, relying entirely upon my disguise, I\r\nwalked boldly through the gateway and up to the thern guard.\r\n\r\nThe men stopped their game and looked up at me, but there was no sign\r\nof suspicion. Similarly they looked at Woola, growling at my heel.\r\n\r\n“Kaor!” I said in true Martian greeting, and the warriors arose and\r\nsaluted me. “I have but just found my way hither from the Golden\r\nCliffs,” I continued, “and seek audience with the hekkador, Matai\r\nShang, Father of Therns. Where may he be found?”\r\n\r\n“Follow me,” said one of the guard, and, turning, led me across the\r\nouter courtyard toward a second buttressed wall.\r\n\r\nWhy the apparent ease with which I seemingly deceived them did not\r\nrouse my suspicions I know not, unless it was that my mind was still so\r\nfull of that fleeting glimpse of my beloved princess that there was\r\nroom in it for naught else. Be that as it may, the fact is that I\r\nmarched buoyantly behind my guide straight into the jaws of death.\r\n\r\nAfterward I learned that thern spies had been aware of my coming for\r\nhours before I reached the hidden fortress.\r\n\r\nThe gate had been purposely left ajar to tempt me on. The guards had\r\nbeen schooled well in their part of the conspiracy; and I, more like a\r\nschoolboy than a seasoned warrior, ran headlong into the trap.\r\n\r\nAt the far side of the outer court a narrow door let into the angle\r\nmade by one of the buttresses with the wall. Here my guide produced a\r\nkey and opened the way within; then, stepping back, he motioned me to\r\nenter.\r\n\r\n“Matai Shang is in the temple court beyond,” he said; and as Woola and\r\nI passed through, the fellow closed the door quickly upon us.\r\n\r\nThe nasty laugh that came to my ears through the heavy planking of the\r\ndoor after the lock clicked was my first intimation that all was not as\r\nit should be.\r\n\r\nI found myself in a small, circular chamber within the buttress. Before\r\nme a door opened, presumably, upon the inner court beyond. For a moment\r\nI hesitated, all my suspicions now suddenly, though tardily, aroused;\r\nthen, with a shrug of my shoulders, I opened the door and stepped out\r\ninto the glare of torches that lighted the inner court.\r\n\r\nDirectly opposite me a massive tower rose to a height of three hundred\r\nfeet. It was of the strangely beautiful modern Barsoomian style of\r\narchitecture, its entire surface hand carved in bold relief with\r\nintricate and fanciful designs. Thirty feet above the courtyard and\r\noverlooking it was a broad balcony, and there, indeed, was Matai Shang,\r\nand with him were Thurid and Phaidor, Thuvia, and Dejah Thoris—the last\r\ntwo heavily ironed. A handful of thern warriors stood just behind the\r\nlittle party.\r\n\r\nAs I entered the enclosure the eyes of those in the balcony were full\r\nupon me.\r\n\r\nAn ugly smile distorted the cruel lips of Matai Shang. Thurid hurled a\r\ntaunt at me and placed a familiar hand upon the shoulder of my\r\nprincess. Like a tigress she turned upon him, striking the beast a\r\nheavy blow with the manacles upon her wrist.\r\n\r\nHe would have struck back had not Matai Shang interfered, and then I\r\nsaw that the two men were not over-friendly; for the manner of the\r\nthern was arrogant and domineering as he made it plain to the First\r\nBorn that the Princess of Helium was the personal property of the\r\nFather of Therns. And Thurid’s bearing toward the ancient hekkador\r\nsavored not at all of liking or respect.\r\n\r\nWhen the altercation in the balcony had subsided Matai Shang turned\r\nagain to me.\r\n\r\n“Earth man,” he cried, “you have earned a more ignoble death than now\r\nlies within our weakened power to inflict upon you; but that the death\r\nyou die tonight may be doubly bitter, know you that when you have\r\npassed, your widow becomes the wife of Matai Shang, Hekkador of the\r\nHoly Therns, for a Martian year.\r\n\r\n“At the end of that time, as you know, she shall be discarded, as is\r\nthe law among us, but not, as is usual, to lead a quiet and honored\r\nlife as high priestess of some hallowed shrine. Instead, Dejah Thoris,\r\nPrincess of Helium, shall become the plaything of my\r\nlieutenants—perhaps of thy most hated enemy, Thurid, the black dator.”\r\n\r\nAs he ceased speaking he awaited in silence evidently for some outbreak\r\nof rage upon my part—something that would have added to the spice of\r\nhis revenge. But I did not give him the satisfaction that he craved.\r\n\r\nInstead, I did the one thing of all others that might rouse his anger\r\nand increase his hatred of me; for I knew that if I died Dejah Thoris,\r\ntoo, would find a way to die before they could heap further tortures or\r\nindignities upon her.\r\n\r\nOf all the holy of holies which the thern venerates and worships none\r\nis more revered than the yellow wig which covers his bald pate, and\r\nnext thereto comes the circlet of gold and the great diadem, whose\r\nscintillant rays mark the attainment of the Tenth Cycle.\r\n\r\nAnd, knowing this, I removed the wig and circlet from my head, tossing\r\nthem carelessly upon the flagging of the court. Then I wiped my feet\r\nupon the yellow tresses; and as a groan of rage arose from the balcony\r\nI spat full upon the holy diadem.\r\n\r\nMatai Shang went livid with anger, but upon the lips of Thurid I could\r\nsee a grim smile of amusement, for to him these things were not holy;\r\nso, lest he should derive too much amusement from my act, I cried: “And\r\nthus did I with the holies of Issus, Goddess of Life Eternal, ere I\r\nthrew Issus herself to the mob that once had worshiped her, to be torn\r\nto pieces in her own temple.”\r\n\r\nThat put an end to Thurid’s grinning, for he had been high in the favor\r\nof Issus.\r\n\r\n“Let us have an end to this blaspheming!” he cried, turning to the\r\nFather of Therns.\r\n\r\nMatai Shang rose and, leaning over the edge of the balcony, gave voice\r\nto the weird call that I had heard from the lips of the priests upon\r\nthe tiny balcony upon the face of the Golden Cliffs overlooking the\r\nValley Dor, when, in times past, they called the fearsome white apes\r\nand the hideous plant men to the feast of victims floating down the\r\nbroad bosom of the mysterious Iss toward the silian-infested waters of\r\nthe Lost Sea of Korus. “Let loose the death!” he cried, and immediately\r\na dozen doors in the base of the tower swung open, and a dozen grim and\r\nterrible banths sprang into the arena.\r\n\r\nThis was not the first time that I had faced the ferocious Barsoomian\r\nlion, but never had I been pitted, single-handed, against a full dozen\r\nof them. Even with the assistance of the fierce Woola, there could be\r\nbut a single outcome to so unequal a struggle.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the beasts hesitated beneath the brilliant glare of the\r\ntorches; but presently their eyes, becoming accustomed to the light,\r\nfell upon Woola and me, and with bristling manes and deep-throated\r\nroars they advanced, lashing their tawny sides with their powerful\r\ntails.\r\n\r\nIn the brief interval of life that was left me I shot a last, parting\r\nglance toward my Dejah Thoris. Her beautiful face was set in an\r\nexpression of horror; and as my eyes met hers she extended both arms\r\ntoward me as, struggling with the guards who now held her, she\r\nendeavored to cast herself from the balcony into the pit beneath, that\r\nshe might share my death with me. Then, as the banths were about to\r\nclose upon me, she turned and buried her dear face in her arms.\r\n\r\nSuddenly my attention was drawn toward Thuvia of Ptarth. The beautiful\r\ngirl was leaning far over the edge of the balcony, her eyes bright with\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\nIn another instant the banths would be upon me, but I could not force\r\nmy gaze from the features of the red girl, for I knew that her\r\nexpression meant anything but the enjoyment of the grim tragedy that\r\nwould so soon be enacted below her; there was some deeper, hidden\r\nmeaning which I sought to solve.\r\n\r\nFor an instant I thought of relying on my earthly muscles and agility\r\nto escape the banths and reach the balcony, which I could easily have\r\ndone, but I could not bring myself to desert the faithful Woola and\r\nleave him to die alone beneath the cruel fangs of the hungry banths;\r\nthat is not the way upon Barsoom, nor was it ever the way of John\r\nCarter.\r\n\r\nThen the secret of Thuvia’s excitement became apparent as from her lips\r\nthere issued the purring sound I had heard once before; that time that,\r\nwithin the Golden Cliffs, she called the fierce banths about her and\r\nled them as a shepherdess might lead her flock of meek and harmless\r\nsheep.\r\n\r\nAt the first note of that soothing sound the banths halted in their\r\ntracks, and every fierce head went high as the beasts sought the origin\r\nof the familiar call. Presently they discovered the red girl in the\r\nbalcony above them, and, turning, roared out their recognition and\r\ntheir greeting.\r\n\r\nGuards sprang to drag Thuvia away, but ere they had succeeded she had\r\nhurled a volley of commands at the listening brutes, and as one they\r\nturned and marched back into their dens.\r\n\r\n“You need not fear them now, John Carter!” cried Thuvia, before they\r\ncould silence her. “Those banths will never harm you now, nor Woola,\r\neither.”\r\n\r\nIt was all I cared to know. There was naught to keep me from that\r\nbalcony now, and with a long, running leap I sprang far aloft until my\r\nhands grasped its lowest sill.\r\n\r\nIn an instant all was wild confusion. Matai Shang shrank back. Thurid\r\nsprang forward with drawn sword to cut me down.\r\n\r\nAgain Dejah Thoris wielded her heavy irons and fought him back. Then\r\nMatai Shang grasped her about the waist and dragged her away through a\r\ndoor leading within the tower.\r\n\r\nFor an instant Thurid hesitated, and then, as though fearing that the\r\nFather of Therns would escape him with the Princess of Helium, he, too,\r\ndashed from the balcony in their wake.\r\n\r\nPhaidor alone retained her presence of mind. Two of the guards she\r\nordered to bear away Thuvia of Ptarth; the others she commanded to\r\nremain and prevent me from following. Then she turned toward me.\r\n\r\n“John Carter,” she cried, “for the last time I offer you the love of\r\nPhaidor, daughter of the Holy Hekkador. Accept and your princess shall\r\nbe returned to the court of her grandfather, and you shall live in\r\npeace and happiness. Refuse and the fate that my father has threatened\r\nshall fall upon Dejah Thoris.\r\n\r\n“You cannot save her now, for by this time they have reached a place\r\nwhere even you may not follow. Refuse and naught can save you; for,\r\nthough the way to the last stronghold of the Holy Therns was made easy\r\nfor you, the way hence hath been made impossible. What say you?”\r\n\r\n“You knew my answer, Phaidor,” I replied, “before ever you spoke. Make\r\nway,” I cried to the guards, “for John Carter, Prince of Helium, would\r\npass!”\r\n\r\nWith that I leaped over the low baluster that surrounded the balcony,\r\nand with drawn long-sword faced my enemies.\r\n\r\nThere were three of them; but Phaidor must have guessed what the\r\noutcome of the battle would be, for she turned and fled from the\r\nbalcony the moment she saw that I would have none of her proposition.\r\n\r\nThe three guardsmen did not wait for my attack. Instead, they rushed\r\nme—the three of them simultaneously; and it was that which gave me an\r\nadvantage, for they fouled one another in the narrow precincts of the\r\nbalcony, so that the foremost of them stumbled full upon my blade at\r\nthe first onslaught.\r\n\r\nThe red stain upon my point roused to its full the old blood-lust of\r\nthe fighting man that has ever been so strong within my breast, so that\r\nmy blade flew through the air with a swiftness and deadly accuracy that\r\nthrew the two remaining therns into wild despair.\r\n\r\nWhen at last the sharp steel found the heart of one of them the other\r\nturned to flee, and, guessing that his steps would lead him along the\r\nway taken by those I sought, I let him keep ever far enough ahead to\r\nthink that he was safely escaping my sword.\r\n\r\nThrough several inner chambers he raced until he came to a spiral\r\nrunway. Up this he dashed, I in close pursuit. At the upper end we came\r\nout into a small chamber, the walls of which were blank except for a\r\nsingle window overlooking the slopes of Otz and the Valley of Lost\r\nSouls beyond.\r\n\r\nHere the fellow tore frantically at what appeared to be but a piece of\r\nthe blank wall opposite the single window. In an instant I guessed that\r\nit was a secret exit from the room, and so I paused that he might have\r\nan opportunity to negotiate it, for I cared nothing to take the life of\r\nthis poor servitor—all I craved was a clear road in pursuit of Dejah\r\nThoris, my long-lost princess.\r\n\r\nBut, try as he would, the panel would yield neither to cunning nor\r\nforce, so that eventually he gave it up and turned to face me.\r\n\r\n“Go thy way, Thern,” I said to him, pointing toward the entrance to the\r\nrunway up which we had but just come. “I have no quarrel with you, nor\r\ndo I crave your life. Go!”\r\n\r\nFor answer he sprang upon me with his sword, and so suddenly, at that,\r\nthat I was like to have gone down before his first rush. So there was\r\nnothing for it but to give him what he sought, and that as quickly as\r\nmight be, that I might not be delayed too long in this chamber while\r\nMatai Shang and Thurid made way with Dejah Thoris and Thuvia of Ptarth.\r\n\r\nThe fellow was a clever swordsman—resourceful and extremely tricky. In\r\nfact, he seemed never to have heard that there existed such a thing as\r\na code of honor, for he repeatedly outraged a dozen Barsoomian fighting\r\ncustoms that an honorable man would rather die than ignore.\r\n\r\nHe even went so far as to snatch his holy wig from his head and throw\r\nit in my face, so as to blind me for a moment while he thrust at my\r\nunprotected breast.\r\n\r\nWhen he thrust, however, I was not there, for I had fought with therns\r\nbefore; and while none had ever resorted to precisely that same\r\nexpedient, I knew them to be the least honorable and most treacherous\r\nfighters upon Mars, and so was ever on the alert for some new and\r\ndevilish subterfuge when I was engaged with one of their race.\r\n\r\nBut at length he overdid the thing; for, drawing his shortsword, he\r\nhurled it, javelinwise, at my body, at the same instant rushing upon me\r\nwith his long-sword. A single sweeping circle of my own blade caught\r\nthe flying weapon and hurled it clattering against the far wall, and\r\nthen, as I sidestepped my antagonist’s impetuous rush, I let him have\r\nmy point full in the stomach as he hurtled by.\r\n\r\nClear to the hilt my weapon passed through his body, and with a\r\nfrightful shriek he sank to the floor, dead.\r\n\r\nHalting only for the brief instant that was required to wrench my sword\r\nfrom the carcass of my late antagonist, I sprang across the chamber to\r\nthe blank wall beyond, through which the thern had attempted to pass.\r\nHere I sought for the secret of its lock, but all to no avail.\r\n\r\nIn despair I tried to force the thing, but the cold, unyielding stone\r\nmight well have laughed at my futile, puny endeavors. In fact, I could\r\nhave sworn that I caught the faint suggestion of taunting laughter from\r\nbeyond the baffling panel.\r\n\r\nIn disgust I desisted from my useless efforts and stepped to the\r\nchamber’s single window.\r\n\r\nThe slopes of Otz and the distant Valley of Lost Souls held nothing to\r\ncompel my interest then; but, towering far above me, the tower’s carved\r\nwall riveted my keenest attention.\r\n\r\nSomewhere within that massive pile was Dejah Thoris. Above me I could\r\nsee windows. There, possibly, lay the only way by which I could reach\r\nher. The risk was great, but not too great when the fate of a world’s\r\nmost wondrous woman was at stake.\r\n\r\nI glanced below. A hundred feet beneath lay jagged granite boulders at\r\nthe brink of a frightful chasm upon which the tower abutted; and if not\r\nupon the boulders, then at the chasm’s bottom, lay death, should a foot\r\nslip but once, or clutching fingers loose their hold for the fraction\r\nof an instant.\r\n\r\nBut there was no other way and with a shrug, which I must admit was\r\nhalf shudder, I stepped to the window’s outer sill and began my\r\nperilous ascent.\r\n\r\nTo my dismay I found that, unlike the ornamentation upon most\r\nHeliumetic structures, the edges of the carvings were quite generally\r\nrounded, so that at best my every hold was most precarious.\r\n\r\nFifty feet above me commenced a series of projecting cylindrical stones\r\nsome six inches in diameter. These apparently circled the tower at\r\nsix-foot intervals, in bands six feet apart; and as each stone cylinder\r\nprotruded some four or five inches beyond the surface of the other\r\nornamentation, they presented a comparatively easy mode of ascent could\r\nI but reach them.\r\n\r\nLaboriously I climbed toward them by way of some windows which lay\r\nbelow them, for I hoped that I might find ingress to the tower through\r\none of these, and thence an easier avenue along which to prosecute my\r\nsearch.\r\n\r\nAt times so slight was my hold upon the rounded surfaces of the\r\ncarving’s edges that a sneeze, a cough, or even a slight gust of wind\r\nwould have dislodged me and sent me hurtling to the depths below.\r\n\r\nBut finally I reached a point where my fingers could just clutch the\r\nsill of the lowest window, and I was on the point of breathing a sigh\r\nof relief when the sound of voices came to me from above through the\r\nopen window.\r\n\r\n“He can never solve the secret of that lock.” The voice was Matai\r\nShang’s. “Let us proceed to the hangar above that we may be far to the\r\nsouth before he finds another way—should that be possible.”\r\n\r\n“All things seem possible to that vile calot,” replied another voice,\r\nwhich I recognized as Thurid’s.\r\n\r\n“Then let us haste,” said Matai Shang. “But to be doubly sure, I will\r\nleave two who shall patrol this runway. Later they may follow us upon\r\nanother flier—overtaking us at Kaol.”\r\n\r\nMy upstretched fingers never reached the window’s sill. At the first\r\nsound of the voices I drew back my hand and clung there to my perilous\r\nperch, flattened against the perpendicular wall, scarce daring to\r\nbreathe.\r\n\r\nWhat a horrible position, indeed, in which to be discovered by Thurid!\r\nHe had but to lean from the window to push me with his sword’s point\r\ninto eternity.\r\n\r\nPresently the sound of the voices became fainter, and once again I took\r\nup my hazardous ascent, now more difficult, since more circuitous, for\r\nI must climb so as to avoid the windows.\r\n\r\nMatai Shang’s reference to the hangar and the fliers indicated that my\r\ndestination lay nothing short of the roof of the tower, and toward this\r\nseemingly distant goal I set my face.\r\n\r\nThe most difficult and dangerous part of the journey was accomplished\r\nat last, and it was with relief that I felt my fingers close about the\r\nlowest of the stone cylinders.\r\n\r\nIt is true that these projections were too far apart to make the\r\nbalance of the ascent anything of a sinecure, but I at least had always\r\nwithin my reach a point of safety to which I might cling in case of\r\naccident.\r\n\r\nSome ten feet below the roof, the wall inclined slightly inward\r\npossibly a foot in the last ten feet, and here the climbing was indeed\r\nimmeasurably easier, so that my fingers soon clutched the eaves.\r\n\r\nAs I drew my eyes above the level of the tower’s top I saw a flier all\r\nbut ready to rise.\r\n\r\nUpon her deck were Matai Shang, Phaidor, Dejah Thoris, Thuvia of\r\nPtarth, and a few thern warriors, while near her was Thurid in the act\r\nof clambering aboard.\r\n\r\nHe was not ten paces from me, facing in the opposite direction; and\r\nwhat cruel freak of fate should have caused him to turn about just as\r\nmy eyes topped the roof’s edge I may not even guess.\r\n\r\nBut turn he did; and when his eyes met mine his wicked face lighted\r\nwith a malignant smile as he leaped toward me, where I was hastening to\r\nscramble to the secure footing of the roof.\r\n\r\nDejah Thoris must have seen me at the same instant, for she screamed a\r\nuseless warning just as Thurid’s foot, swinging in a mighty kick,\r\nlanded full in my face.\r\n\r\nLike a felled ox, I reeled and tumbled backward over the tower’s side.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nON THE KAOLIAN ROAD\r\n\r\n\r\nIf there be a fate that is sometimes cruel to me, there surely is a\r\nkind and merciful Providence which watches over me.\r\n\r\nAs I toppled from the tower into the horrid abyss below I counted\r\nmyself already dead; and Thurid must have done likewise, for he\r\nevidently did not even trouble himself to look after me, but must have\r\nturned and mounted the waiting flier at once.\r\n\r\nTen feet only I fell, and then a loop of my tough, leathern harness\r\ncaught upon one of the cylindrical stone projections in the tower’s\r\nsurface—and held. Even when I had ceased to fall I could not believe\r\nthe miracle that had preserved me from instant death, and for a moment\r\nI hung there, cold sweat exuding from every pore of my body.\r\n\r\nBut when at last I had worked myself back to a firm position I\r\nhesitated to ascend, since I could not know that Thurid was not still\r\nawaiting me above.\r\n\r\nPresently, however, there came to my ears the whirring of the\r\npropellers of a flier, and as each moment the sound grew fainter I\r\nrealized that the party had proceeded toward the south without assuring\r\nthemselves as to my fate.\r\n\r\nCautiously I retraced my way to the roof, and I must admit that it was\r\nwith no pleasant sensation that I raised my eyes once more above its\r\nedge; but, to my relief, there was no one in sight, and a moment later\r\nI stood safely upon its broad surface.\r\n\r\nTo reach the hangar and drag forth the only other flier which it\r\ncontained was the work of but an instant; and just as the two thern\r\nwarriors whom Matai Shang had left to prevent this very contingency\r\nemerged upon the roof from the tower’s interior, I rose above them with\r\na taunting laugh.\r\n\r\nThen I dived rapidly to the inner court where I had last seen Woola,\r\nand to my immense relief found the faithful beast still there.\r\n\r\nThe twelve great banths lay in the doorways of their lairs, eyeing him\r\nand growling ominously, but they had not disobeyed Thuvia’s injunction;\r\nand I thanked the fate that had made her their keeper within the Golden\r\nCliffs, and endowed her with the kind and sympathetic nature that had\r\nwon the loyalty and affection of these fierce beasts for her.\r\n\r\nWoola leaped in frantic joy when he discovered me; and as the flier\r\ntouched the pavement of the court for a brief instant he bounded to the\r\ndeck beside me, and in the bearlike manifestation of his exuberant\r\nhappiness all but caused me to wreck the vessel against the courtyard’s\r\nrocky wall.\r\n\r\nAmid the angry shouting of thern guardsmen we rose high above the last\r\nfortress of the Holy Therns, and then raced straight toward the\r\nnortheast and Kaol, the destination which I had heard from the lips of\r\nMatai Shang.\r\n\r\nFar ahead, a tiny speck in the distance, I made out another flier late\r\nin the afternoon. It could be none other than that which bore my lost\r\nlove and my enemies.\r\n\r\nI had gained considerably on the craft by night; and then, knowing that\r\nthey must have sighted me and would show no lights after dark, I set my\r\ndestination compass upon her—that wonderful little Martian mechanism\r\nwhich, once attuned to the object of destination, points away toward\r\nit, irrespective of every change in its location.\r\n\r\nAll that night we raced through the Barsoomian void, passing over low\r\nhills and dead sea bottoms; above long-deserted cities and populous\r\ncenters of red Martian habitation upon the ribbon-like lines of\r\ncultivated land which border the globe-encircling waterways, which\r\nEarth men call the canals of Mars.\r\n\r\nDawn showed that I had gained appreciably upon the flier ahead of me.\r\nIt was a larger craft than mine, and not so swift; but even so, it had\r\ncovered an immense distance since the flight began.\r\n\r\nThe change in vegetation below showed me that we were rapidly nearing\r\nthe equator. I was now near enough to my quarry to have used my bow\r\ngun; but, though I could see that Dejah Thoris was not on deck, I\r\nfeared to fire upon the craft which bore her.\r\n\r\nThurid was deterred by no such scruples; and though it must have been\r\ndifficult for him to believe that it was really I who followed them, he\r\ncould not very well doubt the witness of his own eyes; and so he\r\ntrained their stern gun upon me with his own hands, and an instant\r\nlater an explosive radium projectile whizzed perilously close above my\r\ndeck.\r\n\r\nThe black’s next shot was more accurate, striking my flier full upon\r\nthe prow and exploding with the instant of contact, ripping wide open\r\nthe bow buoyancy tanks and disabling the engine.\r\n\r\nSo quickly did my bow drop after the shot that I scarce had time to\r\nlash Woola to the deck and buckle my own harness to a gunwale ring\r\nbefore the craft was hanging stern up and making her last long drop to\r\nground.\r\n\r\nHer stern buoyancy tanks prevented her dropping with great rapidity;\r\nbut Thurid was firing rapidly now in an attempt to burst these also,\r\nthat I might be dashed to death in the swift fall that would instantly\r\nfollow a successful shot.\r\n\r\nShot after shot tore past or into us, but by a miracle neither Woola\r\nnor I was hit, nor were the after tanks punctured. This good fortune\r\ncould not last indefinitely, and, assured that Thurid would not again\r\nleave me alive, I awaited the bursting of the next shell that hit; and\r\nthen, throwing my hands above my head, I let go my hold and crumpled,\r\nlimp and inert, dangling in my harness like a corpse.\r\n\r\nThe ruse worked, and Thurid fired no more at us. Presently I heard the\r\ndiminishing sound of whirring propellers and realized that again I was\r\nsafe.\r\n\r\nSlowly the stricken flier sank to the ground, and when I had freed\r\nmyself and Woola from the entangling wreckage I found that we were upon\r\nthe verge of a natural forest—so rare a thing upon the bosom of dying\r\nMars that, outside of the forest in the Valley Dor beside the Lost Sea\r\nof Korus, I never before had seen its like upon the planet.\r\n\r\nFrom books and travelers I had learned something of the little-known\r\nland of Kaol, which lies along the equator almost halfway round the\r\nplanet to the east of Helium.\r\n\r\nIt comprises a sunken area of extreme tropical heat, and is inhabited\r\nby a nation of red men varying but little in manners, customs, and\r\nappearance from the balance of the red men of Barsoom.\r\n\r\nI knew that they were among those of the outer world who still clung\r\ntenaciously to the discredited religion of the Holy Therns, and that\r\nMatai Shang would find a ready welcome and safe refuge among them;\r\nwhile John Carter could look for nothing better than an ignoble death\r\nat their hands.\r\n\r\nThe isolation of the Kaolians is rendered almost complete by the fact\r\nthat no waterway connects their land with that of any other nation, nor\r\nhave they any need of a waterway since the low, swampy land which\r\ncomprises the entire area of their domain self-waters their abundant\r\ntropical crops.\r\n\r\nFor great distances in all directions rugged hills and arid stretches\r\nof dead sea bottom discourage intercourse with them, and since there is\r\npractically no such thing as foreign commerce upon warlike Barsoom,\r\nwhere each nation is sufficient to itself, really little has been known\r\nrelative to the court of the Jeddak of Kaol and the numerous strange,\r\nbut interesting, people over whom he rules.\r\n\r\nOccasional hunting parties have traveled to this out-of-the-way corner\r\nof the globe, but the hostility of the natives has usually brought\r\ndisaster upon them, so that even the sport of hunting the strange and\r\nsavage creatures which haunt the jungle fastnesses of Kaol has of later\r\nyears proved insufficient lure even to the most intrepid warriors.\r\n\r\nIt was upon the verge of the land of the Kaols that I now knew myself\r\nto be, but in what direction to search for Dejah Thoris, or how far\r\ninto the heart of the great forest I might have to penetrate I had not\r\nthe faintest idea.\r\n\r\nBut not so Woola.\r\n\r\nScarcely had I disentangled him than he raised his head high in air and\r\ncommenced circling about at the edge of the forest. Presently he\r\nhalted, and, turning to see if I were following, set off straight into\r\nthe maze of trees in the direction we had been going before Thurid’s\r\nshot had put an end to our flier.\r\n\r\nAs best I could, I stumbled after him down a steep declivity beginning\r\nat the forest’s edge.\r\n\r\nImmense trees reared their mighty heads far above us, their broad\r\nfronds completely shutting off the slightest glimpse of the sky. It was\r\neasy to see why the Kaolians needed no navy; their cities, hidden in\r\nthe midst of this towering forest, must be entirely invisible from\r\nabove, nor could a landing be made by any but the smallest fliers, and\r\nthen only with the greatest risk of accident.\r\n\r\nHow Thurid and Matai Shang were to land I could not imagine, though\r\nlater I was to learn that to the level of the forest top there rises in\r\neach city of Kaol a slender watchtower which guards the Kaolians by day\r\nand by night against the secret approach of a hostile fleet. To one of\r\nthese the hekkador of the Holy Therns had no difficulty in approaching,\r\nand by its means the party was safely lowered to the ground.\r\n\r\nAs Woola and I approached the bottom of the declivity the ground became\r\nsoft and mushy, so that it was with the greatest difficulty that we\r\nmade any headway whatever.\r\n\r\nSlender purple grasses topped with red and yellow fern-like fronds grew\r\nrankly all about us to the height of several feet above my head.\r\n\r\nMyriad creepers hung festooned in graceful loops from tree to tree, and\r\namong them were several varieties of the Martian “man-flower,” whose\r\nblooms have eyes and hands with which to see and seize the insects\r\nwhich form their diet.\r\n\r\nThe repulsive calot tree was, too, much in evidence. It is a\r\ncarnivorous plant of about the bigness of a large sage-brush such as\r\ndots our western plains. Each branch ends in a set of strong jaws,\r\nwhich have been known to drag down and devour large and formidable\r\nbeasts of prey.\r\n\r\nBoth Woola and I had several narrow escapes from these greedy,\r\narboreous monsters.\r\n\r\nOccasional areas of firm sod gave us intervals of rest from the arduous\r\nlabor of traversing this gorgeous, twilight swamp, and it was upon one\r\nof these that I finally decided to make camp for the night which my\r\nchronometer warned me would soon be upon us.\r\n\r\nMany varieties of fruit grew in abundance about us; and as Martian\r\ncalots are omnivorous, Woola had no difficulty in making a square meal\r\nafter I had brought down the viands for him. Then, having eaten, too, I\r\nlay down with my back to that of my faithful hound, and dropped into a\r\ndeep and dreamless sleep.\r\n\r\nThe forest was shrouded in impenetrable darkness when a low growl from\r\nWoola awakened me. All about us I could hear the stealthy movement of\r\ngreat, padded feet, and now and then the wicked gleam of green eyes\r\nupon us. Arising, I drew my long-sword and waited.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a deep-toned, horrid roar burst from some savage throat almost\r\nat my side. What a fool I had been not to have found safer lodgings for\r\nmyself and Woola among the branches of one of the countless trees that\r\nsurrounded us!\r\n\r\nBy daylight it would have been comparatively easy to have hoisted Woola\r\naloft in one manner or another, but now it was too late. There was\r\nnothing for it but to stand our ground and take our medicine, though,\r\nfrom the hideous racket which now assailed our ears, and for which that\r\nfirst roar had seemed to be the signal, I judged that we must be in the\r\nmidst of hundreds, perhaps thousands, of the fierce, man-eating\r\ndenizens of the Kaolian jungle.\r\n\r\nAll the balance of the night they kept up their infernal din, but why\r\nthey did not attack us I could not guess, nor am I sure to this day,\r\nunless it is that none of them ever venture upon the patches of scarlet\r\nsward which dot the swamp.\r\n\r\nWhen morning broke they were still there, walking about as in a circle,\r\nbut always just beyond the edge of the sward. A more terrifying\r\naggregation of fierce and blood-thirsty monsters it would be difficult\r\nto imagine.\r\n\r\nSingly and in pairs they commenced wandering off into the jungle\r\nshortly after sunrise, and when the last of them had departed Woola and\r\nI resumed our journey.\r\n\r\nOccasionally we caught glimpses of horrid beasts all during the day;\r\nbut, fortunately, we were never far from a sward island, and when they\r\nsaw us their pursuit always ended at the verge of the solid sod.\r\n\r\nToward noon we stumbled upon a well-constructed road running in the\r\ngeneral direction we had been pursuing. Everything about this highway\r\nmarked it as the work of skilled engineers, and I was confident, from\r\nthe indications of antiquity which it bore, as well as from the very\r\nevident signs of its being still in everyday use, that it must lead to\r\none of the principal cities of Kaol.\r\n\r\nJust as we entered it from one side a huge monster emerged from the\r\njungle upon the other, and at sight of us charged madly in our\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\nImagine, if you can, a bald-faced hornet of your earthly experience\r\ngrown to the size of a prize Hereford bull, and you will have some\r\nfaint conception of the ferocious appearance and awesome formidability\r\nof the winged monster that bore down upon me.\r\n\r\nFrightful jaws in front and mighty, poisoned sting behind made my\r\nrelatively puny long-sword seem a pitiful weapon of defense indeed. Nor\r\ncould I hope to escape the lightning-like movements or hide from those\r\nmyriad facet eyes which covered three-fourths of the hideous head,\r\npermitting the creature to see in all directions at one and the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nEven my powerful and ferocious Woola was as helpless as a kitten before\r\nthat frightful thing. But to flee were useless, even had it ever been\r\nto my liking to turn my back upon a danger; so I stood my ground, Woola\r\nsnarling at my side, my only hope to die as I had always\r\nlived—fighting.\r\n\r\nThe creature was upon us now, and at the instant there seemed to me a\r\nsingle slight chance for victory. If I could but remove the terrible\r\nmenace of certain death hidden in the poison sacs that fed the sting\r\nthe struggle would be less unequal.\r\n\r\nAt the thought I called to Woola to leap upon the creature’s head and\r\nhang there, and as his mighty jaws closed upon that fiendish face, and\r\nglistening fangs buried themselves in the bone and cartilage and lower\r\npart of one of the huge eyes, I dived beneath the great body as the\r\ncreature rose, dragging Woola from the ground, that it might bring its\r\nsting beneath and pierce the body of the thing hanging to its head.\r\n\r\nTo put myself in the path of that poison-laden lance was to court\r\ninstant death, but it was the only way; and as the thing shot\r\nlightning-like toward me I swung my long-sword in a terrific cut that\r\nsevered the deadly member close to the gorgeously marked body.\r\n\r\nThen, like a battering-ram, one of the powerful hind legs caught me\r\nfull in the chest and hurled me, half stunned and wholly winded, clear\r\nacross the broad highway and into the underbrush of the jungle that\r\nfringes it.\r\n\r\nFortunately, I passed between the boles of trees; had I struck one of\r\nthem I should have been badly injured, if not killed, so swiftly had I\r\nbeen catapulted by that enormous hind leg.\r\n\r\nDazed though I was, I stumbled to my feet and staggered back to Woola’s\r\nassistance, to find his savage antagonist circling ten feet above the\r\nground, beating madly at the clinging calot with all six powerful legs.\r\n\r\nEven during my sudden flight through the air I had not once released my\r\ngrip upon my long-sword, and now I ran beneath the two battling\r\nmonsters, jabbing the winged terror repeatedly with its sharp point.\r\n\r\nThe thing might easily have risen out of my reach, but evidently it\r\nknew as little concerning retreat in the face of danger as either Woola\r\nor I, for it dropped quickly toward me, and before I could escape had\r\ngrasped my shoulder between its powerful jaws.\r\n\r\nTime and again the now useless stub of its giant sting struck futilely\r\nagainst my body, but the blows alone were almost as effective as the\r\nkick of a horse; so that when I say futilely, I refer only to the\r\nnatural function of the disabled member—eventually the thing would have\r\nhammered me to a pulp. Nor was it far from accomplishing this when an\r\ninterruption occurred that put an end forever to its hostilities.\r\n\r\nFrom where I hung a few feet above the road I could see along the\r\nhighway a few hundred yards to where it turned toward the east, and\r\njust as I had about given up all hope of escaping the perilous position\r\nin which I now was I saw a red warrior come into view from around the\r\nbend.\r\n\r\nHe was mounted on a splendid thoat, one of the smaller species used by\r\nred men, and in his hand was a wondrous long, light lance.\r\n\r\nHis mount was walking sedately when I first perceived them, but the\r\ninstant that the red man’s eyes fell upon us a word to the thoat\r\nbrought the animal at full charge down upon us. The long lance of the\r\nwarrior dipped toward us, and as thoat and rider hurtled beneath, the\r\npoint passed through the body of our antagonist.\r\n\r\nWith a convulsive shudder the thing stiffened, the jaws relaxed,\r\ndropping me to the ground, and then, careening once in mid air, the\r\ncreature plunged headforemost to the road, full upon Woola, who still\r\nclung tenaciously to its gory head.\r\n\r\nBy the time I had regained my feet the red man had turned and ridden\r\nback to us. Woola, finding his enemy inert and lifeless, released his\r\nhold at my command and wriggled from beneath the body that had covered\r\nhim, and together we faced the warrior looking down upon us.\r\n\r\nI started to thank the stranger for his timely assistance, but he cut\r\nme off peremptorily.\r\n\r\n“Who are you,” he asked, “who dare enter the land of Kaol and hunt in\r\nthe royal forest of the jeddak?”\r\n\r\nThen, as he noted my white skin through the coating of grime and blood\r\nthat covered me, his eyes went wide and in an altered tone he\r\nwhispered: “Can it be that you are a Holy Thern?”\r\n\r\nI might have deceived the fellow for a time, as I had deceived others,\r\nbut I had cast away the yellow wig and the holy diadem in the presence\r\nof Matai Shang, and I knew that it would not be long ere my new\r\nacquaintance discovered that I was no thern at all.\r\n\r\n“I am not a thern,” I replied, and then, flinging caution to the winds,\r\nI said: “I am John Carter, Prince of Helium, whose name may not be\r\nentirely unknown to you.”\r\n\r\nIf his eyes had gone wide when he thought that I was a Holy Thern, they\r\nfairly popped now that he knew that I was John Carter. I grasped my\r\nlong-sword more firmly as I spoke the words which I was sure would\r\nprecipitate an attack, but to my surprise they precipitated nothing of\r\nthe kind.\r\n\r\n“John Carter, Prince of Helium,” he repeated slowly, as though he could\r\nnot quite grasp the truth of the statement. “John Carter, the mightiest\r\nwarrior of Barsoom!”\r\n\r\nAnd then he dismounted and placed his hand upon my shoulder after the\r\nmanner of most friendly greeting upon Mars.\r\n\r\n“It is my duty, and it should be my pleasure, to kill you, John\r\nCarter,” he said, “but always in my heart of hearts have I admired your\r\nprowess and believed in your sincerity the while I have questioned and\r\ndisbelieved the therns and their religion.\r\n\r\n“It would mean my instant death were my heresy to be suspected in the\r\ncourt of Kulan Tith, but if I may serve you, Prince, you have but to\r\ncommand Torkar Bar, Dwar of the Kaolian Road.”\r\n\r\nTruth and honesty were writ large upon the warrior’s noble countenance,\r\nso that I could not but have trusted him, enemy though he should have\r\nbeen. His title of Captain of the Kaolian Road explained his timely\r\npresence in the heart of the savage forest, for every highway upon\r\nBarsoom is patrolled by doughty warriors of the noble class, nor is\r\nthere any service more honorable than this lonely and dangerous duty in\r\nthe less frequented sections of the domains of the red men of Barsoom.\r\n\r\n“Torkar Bar has already placed a great debt of gratitude upon my\r\nshoulders,” I replied, pointing to the carcass of the creature from\r\nwhose heart he was dragging his long spear.\r\n\r\nThe red man smiled.\r\n\r\n“It was fortunate that I came when I did,” he said. “Only this poisoned\r\nspear pricking the very heart of a sith can kill it quickly enough to\r\nsave its prey. In this section of Kaol we are all armed with a long\r\nsith spear, whose point is smeared with the poison of the creature it\r\nis intended to kill; no other virus acts so quickly upon the beast as\r\nits own.\r\n\r\n“Look,” he continued, drawing his dagger and making an incision in the\r\ncarcass a foot above the root of the sting, from which he presently\r\ndrew forth two sacs, each of which held fully a gallon of the deadly\r\nliquid.\r\n\r\n“Thus we maintain our supply, though were it not for certain commercial\r\nuses to which the virus is put, it would scarcely be necessary to add\r\nto our present store, since the sith is almost extinct.\r\n\r\n“Only occasionally do we now run upon one. Of old, however, Kaol was\r\noverrun with the frightful monsters that often came in herds of twenty\r\nor thirty, darting down from above into our cities and carrying away\r\nwomen, children, and even warriors.”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke I had been wondering just how much I might safely tell this\r\nman of the mission which brought me to his land, but his next words\r\nanticipated the broaching of the subject on my part, and rendered me\r\nthankful that I had not spoken too soon.\r\n\r\n“And now as to yourself, John Carter,” he said, “I shall not ask your\r\nbusiness here, nor do I wish to hear it. I have eyes and ears and\r\nordinary intelligence, and yesterday morning I saw the party that came\r\nto the city of Kaol from the north in a small flier. But one thing I\r\nask of you, and that is: the word of John Carter that he contemplates\r\nno overt act against either the nation of Kaol or its jeddak.”\r\n\r\n“You may have my word as to that, Torkar Bar,” I replied.\r\n\r\n“My way leads along the Kaolian road, away from the city of Kaol,” he\r\ncontinued. “I have seen no one—John Carter least of all. Nor have you\r\nseen Torkar Bar, nor ever heard of him. You understand?”\r\n\r\n“Perfectly,” I replied.\r\n\r\nHe laid his hand upon my shoulder.\r\n\r\n“This road leads directly into the city of Kaol,” he said. “I wish you\r\nfortune,” and vaulting to the back of his thoat he trotted away without\r\neven a backward glance.\r\n\r\nIt was after dark when Woola and I spied through the mighty forest the\r\ngreat wall which surrounds the city of Kaol.\r\n\r\nWe had traversed the entire way without mishap or adventure, and though\r\nthe few we had met had eyed the great calot wonderingly, none had\r\npierced the red pigment with which I had smoothly smeared every square\r\ninch of my body.\r\n\r\nBut to traverse the surrounding country, and to enter the guarded city\r\nof Kulan Tith, Jeddak of Kaol, were two very different things. No man\r\nenters a Martian city without giving a very detailed and satisfactory\r\naccount of himself, nor did I delude myself with the belief that I\r\ncould for a moment impose upon the acumen of the officers of the guard\r\nto whom I should be taken the moment I applied at any one of the gates.\r\n\r\nMy only hope seemed to lie in entering the city surreptitiously under\r\ncover of the darkness, and once in, trust to my own wits to hide myself\r\nin some crowded quarter where detection would be less liable to occur.\r\n\r\nWith this idea in view I circled the great wall, keeping within the\r\nfringe of the forest, which is cut away for a short distance from the\r\nwall all about the city, that no enemy may utilize the trees as a means\r\nof ingress.\r\n\r\nSeveral times I attempted to scale the barrier at different points, but\r\nnot even my earthly muscles could overcome that cleverly constructed\r\nrampart. To a height of thirty feet the face of the wall slanted\r\noutward, and then for almost an equal distance it was perpendicular,\r\nabove which it slanted in again for some fifteen feet to the crest.\r\n\r\nAnd smooth! Polished glass could not be more so. Finally I had to admit\r\nthat at last I had discovered a Barsoomian fortification which I could\r\nnot negotiate.\r\n\r\nDiscouraged, I withdrew into the forest beside a broad highway which\r\nentered the city from the east, and with Woola beside me lay down to\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nA HERO IN KAOL\r\n\r\n\r\nIt was daylight when I was awakened by the sound of stealthy movement\r\nnear by.\r\n\r\nAs I opened my eyes Woola, too, moved and, coming up to his haunches,\r\nstared through the intervening brush toward the road, each hair upon\r\nhis neck stiffly erect.\r\n\r\nAt first I could see nothing, but presently I caught a glimpse of a bit\r\nof smooth and glossy green moving among the scarlet and purple and\r\nyellow of the vegetation.\r\n\r\nMotioning Woola to remain quietly where he was, I crept forward to\r\ninvestigate, and from behind the bole of a great tree I saw a long line\r\nof the hideous green warriors of the dead sea bottoms hiding in the\r\ndense jungle beside the road.\r\n\r\nAs far as I could see, the silent line of destruction and death\r\nstretched away from the city of Kaol. There could be but one\r\nexplanation. The green men were expecting an exodus of a body of red\r\ntroops from the nearest city gate, and they were lying there in ambush\r\nto leap upon them.\r\n\r\nI owed no fealty to the Jeddak of Kaol, but he was of the same race of\r\nnoble red men as my own princess, and I would not stand supinely by and\r\nsee his warriors butchered by the cruel and heartless demons of the\r\nwaste places of Barsoom.\r\n\r\nCautiously I retraced my steps to where I had left Woola, and warning\r\nhim to silence, signaled him to follow me. Making a considerable detour\r\nto avoid the chance of falling into the hands of the green men, I came\r\nat last to the great wall.\r\n\r\nA hundred yards to my right was the gate from which the troops were\r\nevidently expected to issue, but to reach it I must pass the flank of\r\nthe green warriors within easy sight of them, and, fearing that my plan\r\nto warn the Kaolians might thus be thwarted, I decided upon hastening\r\ntoward the left, where another gate a mile away would give me ingress\r\nto the city.\r\n\r\nI knew that the word I brought would prove a splendid passport to Kaol,\r\nand I must admit that my caution was due more to my ardent desire to\r\nmake my way into the city than to avoid a brush with the green men. As\r\nmuch as I enjoy a fight, I cannot always indulge myself, and just now I\r\nhad more weighty matters to occupy my time than spilling the blood of\r\nstrange warriors.\r\n\r\nCould I but win beyond the city’s wall, there might be opportunity in\r\nthe confusion and excitement which were sure to follow my announcement\r\nof an invading force of green warriors to find my way within the palace\r\nof the jeddak, where I was sure Matai Shang and his party would be\r\nquartered.\r\n\r\nBut scarcely had I taken a hundred steps in the direction of the\r\nfarther gate when the sound of marching troops, the clank of metal, and\r\nthe squealing of thoats just within the city apprised me of the fact\r\nthat the Kaolians were already moving toward the other gate.\r\n\r\nThere was no time to be lost. In another moment the gate would be\r\nopened and the head of the column pass out upon the death-bordered\r\nhighway.\r\n\r\nTurning back toward the fateful gate, I ran rapidly along the edge of\r\nthe clearing, taking the ground in the mighty leaps that had first made\r\nme famous upon Barsoom. Thirty, fifty, a hundred feet at a bound are\r\nnothing for the muscles of an athletic Earth man upon Mars.\r\n\r\nAs I passed the flank of the waiting green men they saw my eyes turned\r\nupon them, and in an instant, knowing that all secrecy was at an end,\r\nthose nearest me sprang to their feet in an effort to cut me off before\r\nI could reach the gate.\r\n\r\nAt the same instant the mighty portal swung wide and the head of the\r\nKaolian column emerged. A dozen green warriors had succeeded in\r\nreaching a point between me and the gate, but they had but little idea\r\nwho it was they had elected to detain.\r\n\r\nI did not slacken my speed an iota as I dashed among them, and as they\r\nfell before my blade I could not but recall the happy memory of those\r\nother battles when Tars Tarkas, Jeddak of Thark, mightiest of Martian\r\ngreen men, had stood shoulder to shoulder with me through long, hot\r\nMartian days, as together we hewed down our enemies until the pile of\r\ncorpses about us rose higher than a tall man’s head.\r\n\r\nWhen several pressed me too closely, there before the carved gateway of\r\nKaol, I leaped above their heads, and fashioning my tactics after those\r\nof the hideous plant men of Dor, struck down upon my enemies’ heads as\r\nI passed above them.\r\n\r\nFrom the city the red warriors were rushing toward us, and from the\r\njungle the savage horde of green men were coming to meet them. In a\r\nmoment I was in the very center of as fierce and bloody a battle as I\r\nhad ever passed through.\r\n\r\nThese Kaolians are most noble fighters, nor are the green men of the\r\nequator one whit less warlike than their cold, cruel cousins of the\r\ntemperate zone. There were many times when either side might have\r\nwithdrawn without dishonor and thus ended hostilities, but from the mad\r\nabandon with which each invariably renewed hostilities I soon came to\r\nbelieve that what need not have been more than a trifling skirmish\r\nwould end only with the complete extermination of one force or the\r\nother.\r\n\r\nWith the joy of battle once roused within me, I took keen delight in\r\nthe fray, and that my fighting was noted by the Kaolians was often\r\nevidenced by the shouts of applause directed at me.\r\n\r\nIf I sometimes seem to take too great pride in my fighting ability, it\r\nmust be remembered that fighting is my vocation. If your vocation be\r\nshoeing horses, or painting pictures, and you can do one or the other\r\nbetter than your fellows, then you are a fool if you are not proud of\r\nyour ability. And so I am very proud that upon two planets no greater\r\nfighter has ever lived than John Carter, Prince of Helium.\r\n\r\nAnd I outdid myself that day to impress the fact upon the natives of\r\nKaol, for I wished to win a way into their hearts—and their city. Nor\r\nwas I to be disappointed in my desire.\r\n\r\nAll day we fought, until the road was red with blood and clogged with\r\ncorpses. Back and forth along the slippery highway the tide of battle\r\nsurged, but never once was the gateway to Kaol really in danger.\r\n\r\nThere were breathing spells when I had a chance to converse with the\r\nred men beside whom I fought, and once the jeddak, Kulan Tith himself,\r\nlaid his hand upon my shoulder and asked my name.\r\n\r\n“I am Dotar Sojat,” I replied, recalling a name given me by the Tharks\r\nmany years before, from the surnames of the first two of their warriors\r\nI had killed, which is the custom among them.\r\n\r\n“You are a mighty warrior, Dotar Sojat,” he replied, “and when this day\r\nis done I shall speak with you again in the great audience chamber.”\r\n\r\nAnd then the fight surged upon us once more and we were separated, but\r\nmy heart’s desire was attained, and it was with renewed vigor and a\r\njoyous soul that I laid about me with my long-sword until the last of\r\nthe green men had had enough and had withdrawn toward their distant sea\r\nbottom.\r\n\r\nNot until the battle was over did I learn why the red troops had\r\nsallied forth that day. It seemed that Kulan Tith was expecting a visit\r\nfrom a mighty jeddak of the north—a powerful and the only ally of the\r\nKaolians, and it had been his wish to meet his guest a full day’s\r\njourney from Kaol.\r\n\r\nBut now the march of the welcoming host was delayed until the following\r\nmorning, when the troops again set out from Kaol. I had not been bidden\r\nto the presence of Kulan Tith after the battle, but he had sent an\r\nofficer to find me and escort me to comfortable quarters in that part\r\nof the palace set aside for the officers of the royal guard.\r\n\r\nThere, with Woola, I had spent a comfortable night, and rose much\r\nrefreshed after the arduous labors of the past few days. Woola had\r\nfought with me through the battle of the previous day, true to the\r\ninstincts and training of a Martian war dog, great numbers of which are\r\noften to be found with the savage green hordes of the dead sea bottoms.\r\n\r\nNeither of us had come through the conflict unscathed, but the\r\nmarvelous, healing salves of Barsoom had sufficed, overnight, to make\r\nus as good as new.\r\n\r\nI breakfasted with a number of the Kaolian officers, whom I found as\r\ncourteous and delightful hosts as even the nobles of Helium, who are\r\nrenowned for their ease of manners and excellence of breeding. The meal\r\nwas scarcely concluded when a messenger arrived from Kulan Tith\r\nsummoning me before him.\r\n\r\nAs I entered the royal presence the jeddak rose, and stepping from the\r\ndais which supported his magnificent throne, came forward to meet me—a\r\nmark of distinction that is seldom accorded to other than a visiting\r\nruler.\r\n\r\n“Kaor, Dotar Sojat!” he greeted me. “I have summoned you to receive the\r\ngrateful thanks of the people of Kaol, for had it not been for your\r\nheroic bravery in daring fate to warn us of the ambuscade we must\r\nsurely have fallen into the well-laid trap. Tell me more of\r\nyourself—from what country you come, and what errand brings you to the\r\ncourt of Kulan Tith.”\r\n\r\n“I am from Hastor,” I said, for in truth I had a small palace in that\r\nsouthern city which lies within the far-flung dominions of the\r\nHeliumetic nation.\r\n\r\n“My presence in the land of Kaol is partly due to accident, my flier\r\nbeing wrecked upon the southern fringe of your great forest. It was\r\nwhile seeking entrance to the city of Kaol that I discovered the green\r\nhorde lying in wait for your troops.”\r\n\r\nIf Kulan Tith wondered what business brought me in a flier to the very\r\nedge of his domain he was good enough not to press me further for an\r\nexplanation, which I should indeed have had difficulty in rendering.\r\n\r\nDuring my audience with the jeddak another party entered the chamber\r\nfrom behind me, so that I did not see their faces until Kulan Tith\r\nstepped past me to greet them, commanding me to follow and be\r\npresented.\r\n\r\nAs I turned toward them it was with difficulty that I controlled my\r\nfeatures, for there, listening to Kulan Tith’s eulogistic words\r\nconcerning me, stood my arch-enemies, Matai Shang and Thurid.\r\n\r\n“Holy Hekkador of the Holy Therns,” the jeddak was saying, “shower thy\r\nblessings upon Dotar Sojat, the valorous stranger from distant Hastor,\r\nwhose wondrous heroism and marvelous ferocity saved the day for Kaol\r\nyesterday.”\r\n\r\nMatai Shang stepped forward and laid his hand upon my shoulder. No\r\nslightest indication that he recognized me showed upon his\r\ncountenance—my disguise was evidently complete.\r\n\r\nHe spoke kindly to me and then presented me to Thurid. The black, too,\r\nwas evidently entirely deceived. Then Kulan Tith regaled them, much to\r\nmy amusement, with details of my achievements upon the field of battle.\r\n\r\nThe thing that seemed to have impressed him most was my remarkable\r\nagility, and time and again he described the wondrous way in which I\r\nhad leaped completely over an antagonist, cleaving his skull wide open\r\nwith my long-sword as I passed above him.\r\n\r\nI thought that I saw Thurid’s eyes widen a bit during the narrative,\r\nand several times I surprised him gazing intently into my face through\r\nnarrowed lids. Was he commencing to suspect? And then Kulan Tith told\r\nof the savage calot that fought beside me, and after that I saw\r\nsuspicion in the eyes of Matai Shang—or did I but imagine it?\r\n\r\nAt the close of the audience Kulan Tith announced that he would have me\r\naccompany him upon the way to meet his royal guest, and as I departed\r\nwith an officer who was to procure proper trappings and a suitable\r\nmount for me, both Matai Shang and Thurid seemed most sincere in\r\nprofessing their pleasure at having had an opportunity to know me. It\r\nwas with a sigh of relief that I quitted the chamber, convinced that\r\nnothing more than a guilty conscience had prompted my belief that\r\neither of my enemies suspected my true identity.\r\n\r\nA half-hour later I rode out of the city gate with the column that\r\naccompanied Kulan Tith upon the way to meet his friend and ally. Though\r\nmy eyes and ears had been wide open during my audience with the jeddak\r\nand my various passages through the palace, I had seen or heard nothing\r\nof Dejah Thoris or Thuvia of Ptarth. That they must be somewhere within\r\nthe great rambling edifice I was positive, and I should have given much\r\nto have found a way to remain behind during Kulan Tith’s absence, that\r\nI might search for them.\r\n\r\nToward noon we came in touch with the head of the column we had set out\r\nto meet.\r\n\r\nIt was a gorgeous train that accompanied the visiting jeddak, and for\r\nmiles it stretched along the wide, white road to Kaol. Mounted troops,\r\ntheir trappings of jewel and metal-incrusted leather glistening in the\r\nsunlight, formed the vanguard of the body, and then came a thousand\r\ngorgeous chariots drawn by huge zitidars.\r\n\r\nThese low, commodious wagons moved two abreast, and on either side of\r\nthem marched solid ranks of mounted warriors, for in the chariots were\r\nthe women and children of the royal court. Upon the back of each\r\nmonster zitidar rode a Martian youth, and the whole scene carried me\r\nback to my first days upon Barsoom, now twenty-two years in the past,\r\nwhen I had first beheld the gorgeous spectacle of a caravan of the\r\ngreen horde of Tharks.\r\n\r\nNever before today had I seen zitidars in the service of red men. These\r\nbrutes are huge mastodonian animals that tower to an immense height\r\neven beside the giant green men and their giant thoats; but when\r\ncompared to the relatively small red man and his breed of thoats they\r\nassume Brobdingnagian proportions that are truly appalling.\r\n\r\nThe beasts were hung with jeweled trappings and saddlepads of gay silk,\r\nembroidered in fanciful designs with strings of diamonds, pearls,\r\nrubies, emeralds, and the countless unnamed jewels of Mars, while from\r\neach chariot rose a dozen standards from which streamers, flags, and\r\npennons fluttered in the breeze.\r\n\r\nJust in front of the chariots the visiting jeddak rode alone upon a\r\npure white thoat—another unusual sight upon Barsoom—and after them came\r\ninterminable ranks of mounted spearmen, riflemen, and swordsmen. It was\r\nindeed a most imposing sight.\r\n\r\nExcept for the clanking of accouterments and the occasional squeal of\r\nan angry thoat or the low guttural of a zitidar, the passage of the\r\ncavalcade was almost noiseless, for neither thoat nor zitidar is a\r\nhoofed animal, and the broad tires of the chariots are of an elastic\r\ncomposition, which gives forth no sound.\r\n\r\nNow and then the gay laughter of a woman or the chatter of children\r\ncould be heard, for the red Martians are a social, pleasure-loving\r\npeople—in direct antithesis to the cold and morbid race of green men.\r\n\r\nThe forms and ceremonials connected with the meeting of the two jeddaks\r\nconsumed an hour, and then we turned and retraced our way toward the\r\ncity of Kaol, which the head of the column reached just before dark,\r\nthough it must have been nearly morning before the rear guard passed\r\nthrough the gateway.\r\n\r\nFortunately, I was well up toward the head of the column, and after the\r\ngreat banquet, which I attended with the officers of the royal guard, I\r\nwas free to seek repose. There was so much activity and bustle about\r\nthe palace all during the night with the constant arrival of the noble\r\nofficers of the visiting jeddak’s retinue that I dared not attempt to\r\nprosecute a search for Dejah Thoris, and so, as soon as it was seemly\r\nfor me to do so, I returned to my quarters.\r\n\r\nAs I passed along the corridors between the banquet hall and the\r\napartments that had been allotted me, I had a sudden feeling that I was\r\nunder surveillance, and, turning quickly in my tracks, caught a glimpse\r\nof a figure which darted into an open doorway the instant I wheeled\r\nabout.\r\n\r\nThough I ran quickly back to the spot where the shadower had\r\ndisappeared I could find no trace of him, yet in the brief glimpse that\r\nI had caught I could have sworn that I had seen a white face surmounted\r\nby a mass of yellow hair.\r\n\r\nThe incident gave me considerable food for speculation, since if I were\r\nright in the conclusion induced by the cursory glimpse I had had of the\r\nspy, then Matai Shang and Thurid must suspect my identity, and if that\r\nwere true not even the service I had rendered Kulan Tith could save me\r\nfrom his religious fanaticism.\r\n\r\nBut never did vague conjecture or fruitless fears for the future lie\r\nwith sufficient weight upon my mind to keep me from my rest, and so\r\ntonight I threw myself upon my sleeping silks and furs and passed at\r\nonce into dreamless slumber.\r\n\r\nCalots are not permitted within the walls of the palace proper, and so\r\nI had had to relegate poor Woola to quarters in the stables where the\r\nroyal thoats are kept. He had comfortable, even luxurious apartments,\r\nbut I would have given much to have had him with me; and if he had\r\nbeen, the thing which happened that night would not have come to pass.\r\n\r\nI could not have slept over a quarter of an hour when I was suddenly\r\nawakened by the passing of some cold and clammy thing across my\r\nforehead. Instantly I sprang to my feet, clutching in the direction I\r\nthought the presence lay. For an instant my hand touched against human\r\nflesh, and then, as I lunged headforemost through the darkness to seize\r\nmy nocturnal visitor, my foot became entangled in my sleeping silks and\r\nI fell sprawling to the floor.\r\n\r\nBy the time I had resumed my feet and found the button which controlled\r\nthe light my caller had disappeared. Careful search of the room\r\nrevealed nothing to explain either the identity or business of the\r\nperson who had thus secretly sought me in the dead of night.\r\n\r\nThat the purpose might be theft I could not believe, since thieves are\r\npractically unknown upon Barsoom. Assassination, however, is rampant,\r\nbut even this could not have been the motive of my stealthy friend, for\r\nhe might easily have killed me had he desired.\r\n\r\nI had about given up fruitless conjecture and was on the point of\r\nreturning to sleep when a dozen Kaolian guardsmen entered my apartment.\r\nThe officer in charge was one of my genial hosts of the morning, but\r\nnow upon his face was no sign of friendship.\r\n\r\n“Kulan Tith commands your presence before him,” he said. “Come!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW ALLIES\r\n\r\n\r\nSurrounded by guardsmen I marched back along the corridors of the\r\npalace of Kulan Tith, Jeddak of Kaol, to the great audience chamber in\r\nthe center of the massive structure.\r\n\r\nAs I entered the brilliantly lighted apartment, filled with the nobles\r\nof Kaol and the officers of the visiting jeddak, all eyes were turned\r\nupon me. Upon the great dais at the end of the chamber stood three\r\nthrones, upon which sat Kulan Tith and his two guests, Matai Shang, and\r\nthe visiting jeddak.\r\n\r\nUp the broad center aisle we marched beneath deadly silence, and at the\r\nfoot of the thrones we halted.\r\n\r\n“Prefer thy charge,” said Kulan Tith, turning to one who stood among\r\nthe nobles at his right; and then Thurid, the black dator of the First\r\nBorn, stepped forward and faced me.\r\n\r\n“Most noble Jeddak,” he said, addressing Kulan Tith, “from the first I\r\nsuspected this stranger within thy palace. Your description of his\r\nfiendish prowess tallied with that of the arch-enemy of truth upon\r\nBarsoom.\r\n\r\n“But that there might be no mistake I despatched a priest of your own\r\nholy cult to make the test that should pierce his disguise and reveal\r\nthe truth. Behold the result!” and Thurid pointed a rigid finger at my\r\nforehead.\r\n\r\nAll eyes followed the direction of that accusing digit—I alone seemed\r\nat a loss to guess what fatal sign rested upon my brow.\r\n\r\nThe officer beside me guessed my perplexity; and as the brows of Kulan\r\nTith darkened in a menacing scowl as his eyes rested upon me, the noble\r\ndrew a small mirror from his pocket-pouch and held it before my face.\r\n\r\nOne glance at the reflection it gave back to me was sufficient.\r\n\r\nFrom my forehead the hand of the sneaking thern had reached out through\r\nthe concealing darkness of my bed-chamber and wiped away a patch of the\r\ndisguising red pigment as broad as my palm. Beneath showed the tanned\r\ntexture of my own white skin.\r\n\r\nFor a moment Thurid ceased speaking, to enhance, I suspect, the\r\ndramatic effect of his disclosure. Then he resumed.\r\n\r\n“Here, O Kulan Tith,” he cried, “is he who has desecrated the temples\r\nof the Gods of Mars, who has violated the persons of the Holy Therns\r\nthemselves and turned a world against its age-old religion. Before you,\r\nin your power, Jeddak of Kaol, Defender of the Holies, stands John\r\nCarter, Prince of Helium!”\r\n\r\nKulan Tith looked toward Matai Shang as though for corroboration of\r\nthese charges. The Holy Thern nodded his head.\r\n\r\n“It is indeed the arch-blasphemer,” he said. “Even now he has followed\r\nme to the very heart of thy palace, Kulan Tith, for the sole purpose of\r\nassassinating me. He—”\r\n\r\n“He lies!” I cried. “Kulan Tith, listen that you may know the truth.\r\nListen while I tell you why John Carter has followed Matai Shang to the\r\nheart of thy palace. Listen to me as well as to them, and then judge if\r\nmy acts be not more in accord with true Barsoomian chivalry and honor\r\nthan those of these revengeful devotees of the spurious creeds from\r\nwhose cruel bonds I have freed your planet.”\r\n\r\n“Silence!” roared the jeddak, leaping to his feet and laying his hand\r\nupon the hilt of his sword. “Silence, blasphemer! Kulan Tith need not\r\npermit the air of his audience chamber to be defiled by the heresies\r\nthat issue from your polluted throat to judge you.\r\n\r\n“You stand already self-condemned. It but remains to determine the\r\nmanner of your death. Even the service that you rendered the arms of\r\nKaol shall avail you naught; it was but a base subterfuge whereby you\r\nmight win your way into my favor and reach the side of this holy man\r\nwhose life you craved. To the pits with him!” he concluded, addressing\r\nthe officer of my guard.\r\n\r\nHere was a pretty pass, indeed! What chance had I against a whole\r\nnation? What hope for me of mercy at the hands of the fanatical Kulan\r\nTith with such advisers as Matai Shang and Thurid. The black grinned\r\nmalevolently in my face.\r\n\r\n“You shall not escape this time, Earth man,” he taunted.\r\n\r\nThe guards closed toward me. A red haze blurred my vision. The fighting\r\nblood of my Virginian sires coursed hot through my veins. The lust of\r\nbattle in all its mad fury was upon me.\r\n\r\nWith a leap I was beside Thurid, and ere the devilish smirk had faded\r\nfrom his handsome face I had caught him full upon the mouth with my\r\nclenched fist; and as the good, old American blow landed, the black\r\ndator shot back a dozen feet, to crumple in a heap at the foot of Kulan\r\nTith’s throne, spitting blood and teeth from his hurt mouth.\r\n\r\nThen I drew my sword and swung round, on guard, to face a nation.\r\n\r\nIn an instant the guardsmen were upon me, but before a blow had been\r\nstruck a mighty voice rose above the din of shouting warriors, and a\r\ngiant figure leaped from the dais beside Kulan Tith and, with drawn\r\nlong-sword, threw himself between me and my adversaries.\r\n\r\nIt was the visiting jeddak.\r\n\r\n“Hold!” he cried. “If you value my friendship, Kulan Tith, and the\r\nage-old peace that has existed between our peoples, call off your\r\nswordsmen; for wherever or against whomsoever fights John Carter,\r\nPrince of Helium, there beside him and to the death fights Thuvan Dihn,\r\nJeddak of Ptarth.”\r\n\r\nThe shouting ceased and the menacing points were lowered as a thousand\r\neyes turned first toward Thuvan Dihn in surprise and then toward Kulan\r\nTith in question. At first the Jeddak of Kaol went white in rage, but\r\nbefore he spoke he had mastered himself, so that his tone was calm and\r\neven as befitted intercourse between two great jeddaks.\r\n\r\n“Thuvan Dihn,” he said slowly, “must have great provocation thus to\r\ndesecrate the ancient customs which inspire the deportment of a guest\r\nwithin the palace of his host. Lest I, too, should forget myself as has\r\nmy royal friend, I should prefer to remain silent until the Jeddak of\r\nPtarth has won from me applause for his action by relating the causes\r\nwhich provoked it.”\r\n\r\nI could see that the Jeddak of Ptarth was of half a mind to throw his\r\nmetal in Kulan Tith’s face, but he controlled himself even as well as\r\nhad his host.\r\n\r\n“None knows better than Thuvan Dihn,” he said, “the laws which govern\r\nthe acts of men in the domains of their neighbors; but Thuvan Dihn owes\r\nallegiance to a higher law than these—the law of gratitude. Nor to any\r\nman upon Barsoom does he owe a greater debt of gratitude than to John\r\nCarter, Prince of Helium.\r\n\r\n“Years ago, Kulan Tith,” he continued, “upon the occasion of your last\r\nvisit to me, you were greatly taken with the charms and graces of my\r\nonly daughter, Thuvia. You saw how I adored her, and later you learned\r\nthat, inspired by some unfathomable whim, she had taken the last, long,\r\nvoluntary pilgrimage upon the cold bosom of the mysterious Iss, leaving\r\nme desolate.\r\n\r\n“Some months ago I first heard of the expedition which John Carter had\r\nled against Issus and the Holy Therns. Faint rumors of the atrocities\r\nreported to have been committed by the therns upon those who for\r\ncountless ages have floated down the mighty Iss came to my ears.\r\n\r\n“I heard that thousands of prisoners had been released, few of whom\r\ndared to return to their own countries owing to the mandate of terrible\r\ndeath which rests against all who return from the Valley Dor.\r\n\r\n“For a time I could not believe the heresies which I heard, and I\r\nprayed that my daughter Thuvia might have died before she ever\r\ncommitted the sacrilege of returning to the outer world. But then my\r\nfather’s love asserted itself, and I vowed that I would prefer eternal\r\ndamnation to further separation from her if she could be found.\r\n\r\n“So I sent emissaries to Helium, and to the court of Xodar, Jeddak of\r\nthe First Born, and to him who now rules those of the thern nation that\r\nhave renounced their religion; and from each and all I heard the same\r\nstory of unspeakable cruelties and atrocities perpetrated upon the poor\r\ndefenseless victims of their religion by the Holy Therns.\r\n\r\n“Many there were who had seen or known my daughter, and from therns who\r\nhad been close to Matai Shang I learned of the indignities that he\r\npersonally heaped upon her; and I was glad when I came here to find\r\nthat Matai Shang was also your guest, for I should have sought him out\r\nhad it taken a lifetime.\r\n\r\n“More, too, I heard, and that of the chivalrous kindness that John\r\nCarter had accorded my daughter. They told me how he fought for her and\r\nrescued her, and how he spurned escape from the savage Warhoons of the\r\nsouth, sending her to safety upon his own thoat and remaining upon foot\r\nto meet the green warriors.\r\n\r\n“Can you wonder, Kulan Tith, that I am willing to jeopardize my life,\r\nthe peace of my nation, or even your friendship, which I prize more\r\nthan aught else, to champion the Prince of Helium?”\r\n\r\nFor a moment Kulan Tith was silent. I could see by the expression of\r\nhis face that he was sore perplexed. Then he spoke.\r\n\r\n“Thuvan Dihn,” he said, and his tone was friendly though sad, “who am I\r\nto judge my fellow-man? In my eyes the Father of Therns is still holy,\r\nand the religion which he teaches the only true religion, but were I\r\nfaced by the same problem that has vexed you I doubt not that I should\r\nfeel and act precisely as you have.\r\n\r\n“In so far as the Prince of Helium is concerned I may act, but between\r\nyou and Matai Shang my only office can be one of conciliation. The\r\nPrince of Helium shall be escorted in safety to the boundary of my\r\ndomain ere the sun has set again, where he shall be free to go whither\r\nhe will; but upon pain of death must he never again enter the land of\r\nKaol.\r\n\r\n“If there be a quarrel between you and the Father of Therns, I need not\r\nask that the settlement of it be deferred until both have passed beyond\r\nthe limits of my power. Are you satisfied, Thuvan Dihn?”\r\n\r\nThe Jeddak of Ptarth nodded his assent, but the ugly scowl that he bent\r\nupon Matai Shang harbored ill for that pasty-faced godling.\r\n\r\n“The Prince of Helium is far from satisfied,” I cried, breaking rudely\r\nin upon the beginnings of peace, for I had no stomach for peace at the\r\nprice that had been named.\r\n\r\n“I have escaped death in a dozen forms to follow Matai Shang and\r\novertake him, and I do not intend to be led, like a decrepit thoat to\r\nthe slaughter, from the goal that I have won by the prowess of my sword\r\narm and the might of my muscles.\r\n\r\n“Nor will Thuvan Dihn, Jeddak of Ptarth, be satisfied when he has heard\r\nme through. Do you know why I have followed Matai Shang and Thurid, the\r\nblack dator, from the forests of the Valley Dor across half a world\r\nthrough almost insurmountable difficulties?\r\n\r\n“Think you that John Carter, Prince of Helium, would stoop to\r\nassassination? Can Kulan Tith be such a fool as to believe that lie,\r\nwhispered in his ear by the Holy Thern or Dator Thurid?\r\n\r\n“I do not follow Matai Shang to kill him, though the God of mine own\r\nplanet knows that my hands itch to be at his throat. I follow him,\r\nThuvan Dihn, because with him are two prisoners—my wife, Dejah Thoris,\r\nPrincess of Helium, and your daughter, Thuvia of Ptarth.\r\n\r\n“Now think you that I shall permit myself to be led beyond the walls of\r\nKaol unless the mother of my son accompanies me, and thy daughter be\r\nrestored?”\r\n\r\nThuvan Dihn turned upon Kulan Tith. Rage flamed in his keen eyes; but\r\nby the masterfulness of his self-control he kept his tones level as he\r\nspoke.\r\n\r\n“Knew you this thing, Kulan Tith?” he asked. “Knew you that my daughter\r\nlay a prisoner in your palace?”\r\n\r\n“He could not know it,” interrupted Matai Shang, white with what I am\r\nsure was more fear than rage. “He could not know it, for it is a lie.”\r\n\r\nI would have had his life for that upon the spot, but even as I sprang\r\ntoward him Thuvan Dihn laid a heavy hand upon my shoulder.\r\n\r\n“Wait,” he said to me, and then to Kulan Tith. “It is not a lie. This\r\nmuch have I learned of the Prince of Helium—he does not lie. Answer me,\r\nKulan Tith—I have asked you a question.”\r\n\r\n“Three women came with the Father of Therns,” replied Kulan Tith.\r\n“Phaidor, his daughter, and two who were reported to be her slaves. If\r\nthese be Thuvia of Ptarth and Dejah Thoris of Helium I did not know\r\nit—I have seen neither. But if they be, then shall they be returned to\r\nyou on the morrow.”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke he looked straight at Matai Shang, not as a devotee should\r\nlook at a high priest, but as a ruler of men looks at one to whom he\r\nissues a command.\r\n\r\nIt must have been plain to the Father of Therns, as it was to me, that\r\nthe recent disclosures of his true character had done much already to\r\nweaken the faith of Kulan Tith, and that it would require but little\r\nmore to turn the powerful jeddak into an avowed enemy; but so strong\r\nare the seeds of superstition that even the great Kaolian still\r\nhesitated to cut the final strand that bound him to his ancient\r\nreligion.\r\n\r\nMatai Shang was wise enough to seem to accept the mandate of his\r\nfollower, and promised to bring the two slave women to the audience\r\nchamber on the morrow.\r\n\r\n“It is almost morning now,” he said, “and I should dislike to break in\r\nupon the slumber of my daughter, or I would have them fetched at once\r\nthat you might see that the Prince of Helium is mistaken,” and he\r\nemphasized the last word in an effort to affront me so subtlely that I\r\ncould not take open offense.\r\n\r\nI was about to object to any delay, and demand that the Princess of\r\nHelium be brought to me forthwith, when Thuvan Dihn made such\r\ninsistence seem unnecessary.\r\n\r\n“I should like to see my daughter at once,” he said, “but if Kulan Tith\r\nwill give me his assurance that none will be permitted to leave the\r\npalace this night, and that no harm shall befall either Dejah Thoris or\r\nThuvia of Ptarth between now and the moment they are brought into our\r\npresence in this chamber at daylight I shall not insist.”\r\n\r\n“None shall leave the palace tonight,” replied the Jeddak of Kaol, “and\r\nMatai Shang will give us assurance that no harm will come to the two\r\nwomen?”\r\n\r\nThe thern assented with a nod. A few moments later Kulan Tith indicated\r\nthat the audience was at an end, and at Thuvan Dihn’s invitation I\r\naccompanied the Jeddak of Ptarth to his own apartments, where we sat\r\nuntil daylight, while he listened to the account of my experiences upon\r\nhis planet and to all that had befallen his daughter during the time\r\nthat we had been together.\r\n\r\nI found the father of Thuvia a man after my own heart, and that night\r\nsaw the beginning of a friendship which has grown until it is second\r\nonly to that which obtains between Tars Tarkas, the green Jeddak of\r\nThark, and myself.\r\n\r\nThe first burst of Mars’s sudden dawn brought messengers from Kulan\r\nTith, summoning us to the audience chamber where Thuvan Dihn was to\r\nreceive his daughter after years of separation, and I was to be\r\nreunited with the glorious daughter of Helium after an almost unbroken\r\nseparation of twelve years.\r\n\r\nMy heart pounded within my bosom until I looked about me in\r\nembarrassment, so sure was I that all within the room must hear. My\r\narms ached to enfold once more the divine form of her whose eternal\r\nyouth and undying beauty were but outward manifestations of a perfect\r\nsoul.\r\n\r\nAt last the messenger despatched to fetch Matai Shang returned. I\r\ncraned my neck to catch the first glimpse of those who should be\r\nfollowing, but the messenger was alone.\r\n\r\nHalting before the throne he addressed his jeddak in a voice that was\r\nplainly audible to all within the chamber.\r\n\r\n“O Kulan Tith, Mightiest of Jeddaks,” he cried, after the fashion of\r\nthe court, “your messenger returns alone, for when he reached the\r\napartments of the Father of Therns he found them empty, as were those\r\noccupied by his suite.”\r\n\r\nKulan Tith went white.\r\n\r\nA low groan burst from the lips of Thuvan Dihn who stood next me, not\r\nhaving ascended the throne which awaited him beside his host. For a\r\nmoment the silence of death reigned in the great audience chamber of\r\nKulan Tith, Jeddak of Kaol. It was he who broke the spell.\r\n\r\nRising from his throne he stepped down from the dais to the side of\r\nThuvan Dihn. Tears dimmed his eyes as he placed both his hands upon the\r\nshoulders of his friend.\r\n\r\n“O Thuvan Dihn,” he cried, “that this should have happened in the\r\npalace of thy best friend! With my own hands would I have wrung the\r\nneck of Matai Shang had I guessed what was in his foul heart. Last\r\nnight my life-long faith was weakened—this morning it has been\r\nshattered; but too late, too late.\r\n\r\n“To wrest your daughter and the wife of this royal warrior from the\r\nclutches of these archfiends you have but to command the resources of a\r\nmighty nation, for all Kaol is at your disposal. What may be done? Say\r\nthe word!”\r\n\r\n“First,” I suggested, “let us find those of your people who be\r\nresponsible for the escape of Matai Shang and his followers. Without\r\nassistance on the part of the palace guard this thing could not have\r\ncome to pass. Seek the guilty, and from them force an explanation of\r\nthe manner of their going and the direction they have taken.”\r\n\r\nBefore Kulan Tith could issue the commands that would initiate the\r\ninvestigation a handsome young officer stepped forward and addressed\r\nhis jeddak.\r\n\r\n“O Kulan Tith, Mightiest of Jeddaks,” he said, “I alone be responsible\r\nfor this grievous error. Last night it was I who commanded the palace\r\nguard. I was on duty in other parts of the palace during the audience\r\nof the early morning, and knew nothing of what transpired then, so that\r\nwhen the Father of Therns summoned me and explained that it was your\r\nwish that his party be hastened from the city because of the presence\r\nhere of a deadly enemy who sought the Holy Hekkador’s life I did only\r\nwhat a lifetime of training has taught me was the proper thing to do—I\r\nobeyed him whom I believed to be the ruler of us all, mightier even\r\nthan thou, mightiest of jeddaks.\r\n\r\n“Let the consequences and the punishment fall on me alone, for I alone\r\nam guilty. Those others of the palace guard who assisted in the flight\r\ndid so under my instructions.”\r\n\r\nKulan Tith looked first at me and then at Thuvan Dihn, as though to ask\r\nour judgment upon the man, but the error was so evidently excusable\r\nthat neither of us had any mind to see the young officer suffer for a\r\nmistake that any might readily have made.\r\n\r\n“How left they,” asked Thuvan Dihn, “and what direction did they take?”\r\n\r\n“They left as they came,” replied the officer, “upon their own flier.\r\nFor some time after they had departed I watched the vessel’s lights,\r\nwhich vanished finally due north.”\r\n\r\n“Where north could Matai Shang find an asylum?” asked Thuvan Dihn of\r\nKulan Tith.\r\n\r\nFor some moments the Jeddak of Kaol stood with bowed head, apparently\r\ndeep in thought. Then a sudden light brightened his countenance.\r\n\r\n“I have it!” he cried. “Only yesterday Matai Shang let drop a hint of\r\nhis destination, telling me of a race of people unlike ourselves who\r\ndwell far to the north. They, he said, had always been known to the\r\nHoly Therns and were devout and faithful followers of the ancient cult.\r\nAmong them would he find a perpetual haven of refuge, where no ‘lying\r\nheretics’ might seek him out. It is there that Matai Shang has gone.”\r\n\r\n“And in all Kaol there be no flier wherein to follow,” I cried.\r\n\r\n“Nor nearer than Ptarth,” replied Thuvan Dihn.\r\n\r\n“Wait!” I exclaimed, “beyond the southern fringe of this great forest\r\nlies the wreck of the thern flier which brought me that far upon my\r\nway. If you will loan me men to fetch it, and artificers to assist me,\r\nI can repair it in two days, Kulan Tith.”\r\n\r\nI had been more than half suspicious of the seeming sincerity of the\r\nKaolian jeddak’s sudden apostasy, but the alacrity with which he\r\nembraced my suggestion, and the despatch with which a force of officers\r\nand men were placed at my disposal entirely removed the last vestige of\r\nmy doubts.\r\n\r\nTwo days later the flier rested upon the top of the watchtower, ready\r\nto depart. Thuvan Dihn and Kulan Tith had offered me the entire\r\nresources of two nations—millions of fighting men were at my disposal;\r\nbut my flier could hold but one other than myself and Woola.\r\n\r\nAs I stepped aboard her, Thuvan Dihn took his place beside me. I cast a\r\nlook of questioning surprise upon him. He turned to the highest of his\r\nown officers who had accompanied him to Kaol.\r\n\r\n“To you I entrust the return of my retinue to Ptarth,” he said. “There\r\nmy son rules ably in my absence. The Prince of Helium shall not go\r\nalone into the land of his enemies. I have spoken. Farewell!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHROUGH THE CARRION CAVES\r\n\r\n\r\nStraight toward the north, day and night, our destination compass led\r\nus after the fleeing flier upon which it had remained set since I first\r\nattuned it after leaving the thern fortress.\r\n\r\nEarly in the second night we noticed the air becoming perceptibly\r\ncolder, and from the distance we had come from the equator were assured\r\nthat we were rapidly approaching the north arctic region.\r\n\r\nMy knowledge of the efforts that had been made by countless expeditions\r\nto explore that unknown land bade me to caution, for never had flier\r\nreturned who had passed to any considerable distance beyond the mighty\r\nice-barrier that fringes the southern hem of the frigid zone.\r\n\r\nWhat became of them none knew—only that they passed forever out of the\r\nsight of man into that grim and mysterious country of the pole.\r\n\r\nThe distance from the barrier to the pole was no more than a swift\r\nflier should cover in a few hours, and so it was assumed that some\r\nfrightful catastrophe awaited those who reached the “forbidden land,”\r\nas it had come to be called by the Martians of the outer world.\r\n\r\nThus it was that I went more slowly as we approached the barrier, for\r\nit was my intention to move cautiously by day over the ice-pack that I\r\nmight discover, before I had run into a trap, if there really lay an\r\ninhabited country at the north pole, for there only could I imagine a\r\nspot where Matai Shang might feel secure from John Carter, Prince of\r\nHelium.\r\n\r\nWe were flying at a snail’s pace but a few feet above the\r\nground—literally feeling our way along through the darkness, for both\r\nmoons had set, and the night was black with the clouds that are to be\r\nfound only at Mars’s two extremities.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a towering wall of white rose directly in our path, and though\r\nI threw the helm hard over, and reversed our engine, I was too late to\r\navoid collision. With a sickening crash we struck the high looming\r\nobstacle three-quarters on.\r\n\r\nThe flier reeled half over; the engine stopped; as one, the patched\r\nbuoyancy tanks burst, and we plunged, headforemost, to the ground\r\ntwenty feet beneath.\r\n\r\nFortunately none of us was injured, and when we had disentangled\r\nourselves from the wreckage, and the lesser moon had burst again from\r\nbelow the horizon, we found that we were at the foot of a mighty\r\nice-barrier, from which outcropped great patches of the granite hills\r\nwhich hold it from encroaching farther toward the south.\r\n\r\nWhat fate! With the journey all but completed to be thus wrecked upon\r\nthe wrong side of that precipitous and unscalable wall of rock and ice!\r\n\r\nI looked at Thuvan Dihn. He but shook his head dejectedly.\r\n\r\nThe balance of the night we spent shivering in our inadequate sleeping\r\nsilks and furs upon the snow that lies at the foot of the ice-barrier.\r\n\r\nWith daylight my battered spirits regained something of their\r\naccustomed hopefulness, though I must admit that there was little\r\nenough for them to feed upon.\r\n\r\n“What shall we do?” asked Thuvan Dihn. “How may we pass that which is\r\nimpassable?”\r\n\r\n“First we must disprove its impassability,” I replied. “Nor shall I\r\nadmit that it is impassable before I have followed its entire circle\r\nand stand again upon this spot, defeated. The sooner we start, the\r\nbetter, for I see no other way, and it will take us more than a month\r\nto travel the weary, frigid miles that lie before us.”\r\n\r\nFor five days of cold and suffering and privation we traversed the\r\nrough and frozen way which lies at the foot of the ice-barrier. Fierce,\r\nfur-bearing creatures attacked us by daylight and by dark. Never for a\r\nmoment were we safe from the sudden charge of some huge demon of the\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\nThe apt was our most consistent and dangerous foe.\r\n\r\nIt is a huge, white-furred creature with six limbs, four of which,\r\nshort and heavy, carry it swiftly over the snow and ice; while the\r\nother two, growing forward from its shoulders on either side of its\r\nlong, powerful neck, terminate in white, hairless hands, with which it\r\nseizes and holds its prey.\r\n\r\nIts head and mouth are more similar in appearance to those of a\r\nhippopotamus than to any other earthly animal, except that from the\r\nsides of the lower jawbone two mighty horns curve slightly downward\r\ntoward the front.\r\n\r\nIts two huge eyes inspired my greatest curiosity. They extend in two\r\nvast, oval patches from the center of the top of the cranium down\r\neither side of the head to below the roots of the horns, so that these\r\nweapons really grow out from the lower part of the eyes, which are\r\ncomposed of several thousand ocelli each.\r\n\r\nThis eye structure seemed remarkable in a beast whose haunts were upon\r\na glaring field of ice and snow, and though I found upon minute\r\nexamination of several that we killed that each ocellus is furnished\r\nwith its own lid, and that the animal can at will close as many of the\r\nfacets of his huge eyes as he chooses, yet I was positive that nature\r\nhad thus equipped him because much of his life was to be spent in dark,\r\nsubterranean recesses.\r\n\r\nShortly after this we came upon the hugest apt that we had seen. The\r\ncreature stood fully eight feet at the shoulder, and was so sleek and\r\nclean and glossy that I could have sworn that he had but recently been\r\ngroomed.\r\n\r\nHe stood head-on eyeing us as we approached him, for we had found it a\r\nwaste of time to attempt to escape the perpetual bestial rage which\r\nseems to possess these demon creatures, who rove the dismal north\r\nattacking every living thing that comes within the scope of their\r\nfar-seeing eyes.\r\n\r\nEven when their bellies are full and they can eat no more, they kill\r\npurely for the pleasure which they derive from taking life, and so when\r\nthis particular apt failed to charge us, and instead wheeled and\r\ntrotted away as we neared him, I should have been greatly surprised had\r\nI not chanced to glimpse the sheen of a golden collar about its neck.\r\n\r\nThuvan Dihn saw it, too, and it carried the same message of hope to us\r\nboth. Only man could have placed that collar there, and as no race of\r\nMartians of which we knew aught ever had attempted to domesticate the\r\nferocious apt, he must belong to a people of the north of whose very\r\nexistence we were ignorant—possibly to the fabled yellow men of\r\nBarsoom; that once powerful race which was supposed to be extinct,\r\nthough sometimes, by theorists, thought still to exist in the frozen\r\nnorth.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously we started upon the trail of the great beast. Woola was\r\nquickly made to understand our desires, so that it was unnecessary to\r\nattempt to keep in sight of the animal whose swift flight over the\r\nrough ground soon put him beyond our vision.\r\n\r\nFor the better part of two hours the trail paralleled the barrier, and\r\nthen suddenly turned toward it through the roughest and seemingly most\r\nimpassable country I ever had beheld.\r\n\r\nEnormous granite boulders blocked the way on every hand; deep rifts in\r\nthe ice threatened to engulf us at the least misstep; and from the\r\nnorth a slight breeze wafted to our nostrils an unspeakable stench that\r\nalmost choked us.\r\n\r\nFor another two hours we were occupied in traversing a few hundred\r\nyards to the foot of the barrier.\r\n\r\nThen, turning about the corner of a wall-like outcropping of granite,\r\nwe came upon a smooth area of two or three acres before the base of the\r\ntowering pile of ice and rock that had baffled us for days, and before\r\nus beheld the dark and cavernous mouth of a cave.\r\n\r\nFrom this repelling portal the horrid stench was emanating, and as\r\nThuvan Dihn espied the place he halted with an exclamation of profound\r\nastonishment.\r\n\r\n“By all my ancestors!” he ejaculated. “That I should have lived to\r\nwitness the reality of the fabled Carrion Caves! If these indeed be\r\nthey, we have found a way beyond the ice-barrier.\r\n\r\n“The ancient chronicles of the first historians of Barsoom—so ancient\r\nthat we have for ages considered them mythology—record the passing of\r\nthe yellow men from the ravages of the green hordes that overran\r\nBarsoom as the drying up of the great oceans drove the dominant races\r\nfrom their strongholds.\r\n\r\n“They tell of the wanderings of the remnants of this once powerful\r\nrace, harassed at every step, until at last they found a way through\r\nthe ice-barrier of the north to a fertile valley at the pole.\r\n\r\n“At the opening to the subterranean passage that led to their haven of\r\nrefuge a mighty battle was fought in which the yellow men were\r\nvictorious, and within the caves that gave ingress to their new home\r\nthey piled the bodies of the dead, both yellow and green, that the\r\nstench might warn away their enemies from further pursuit.\r\n\r\n“And ever since that long-gone day have the dead of this fabled land\r\nbeen carried to the Carrion Caves, that in death and decay they might\r\nserve their country and warn away invading enemies. Here, too, is\r\nbrought, so the fable runs, all the waste stuff of the\r\nnation—everything that is subject to rot, and that can add to the foul\r\nstench that assails our nostrils.\r\n\r\n“And death lurks at every step among rotting dead, for here the fierce\r\napts lair, adding to the putrid accumulation with the fragments of\r\ntheir own prey which they cannot devour. It is a horrid avenue to our\r\ngoal, but it is the only one.”\r\n\r\n“You are sure, then, that we have found the way to the land of the\r\nyellow men?” I cried.\r\n\r\n“As sure as may be,” he replied; “having only ancient legend to support\r\nmy belief. But see how closely, so far, each detail tallies with the\r\nworld-old story of the hegira of the yellow race. Yes, I am sure that\r\nwe have discovered the way to their ancient hiding place.”\r\n\r\n“If it be true, and let us pray that such may be the case,” I said,\r\n“then here may we solve the mystery of the disappearance of Tardos\r\nMors, Jeddak of Helium, and Mors Kajak, his son, for no other spot upon\r\nBarsoom has remained unexplored by the many expeditions and the\r\ncountless spies that have been searching for them for nearly two years.\r\nThe last word that came from them was that they sought Carthoris, my\r\nown brave son, beyond the ice-barrier.”\r\n\r\nAs we talked we had been approaching the entrance to the cave, and as\r\nwe crossed the threshold I ceased to wonder that the ancient green\r\nenemies of the yellow men had been halted by the horrors of that awful\r\nway.\r\n\r\nThe bones of dead men lay man high upon the broad floor of the first\r\ncave, and over all was a putrid mush of decaying flesh, through which\r\nthe apts had beaten a hideous trail toward the entrance to the second\r\ncave beyond.\r\n\r\nThe roof of this first apartment was low, like all that we traversed\r\nsubsequently, so that the foul odors were confined and condensed to\r\nsuch an extent that they seemed to possess tangible substance. One was\r\nalmost tempted to draw his short-sword and hew his way through in\r\nsearch of pure air beyond.\r\n\r\n“Can man breathe this polluted air and live?” asked Thuvan Dihn,\r\nchoking.\r\n\r\n“Not for long, I imagine,” I replied; “so let us make haste. I will go\r\nfirst, and you bring up the rear, with Woola between. Come,” and with\r\nthe words I dashed forward, across the fetid mass of putrefaction.\r\n\r\nIt was not until we had passed through seven caves of different sizes\r\nand varying but little in the power and quality of their stenches that\r\nwe met with any physical opposition. Then, within the eighth cave, we\r\ncame upon a lair of apts.\r\n\r\nA full score of the mighty beasts were disposed about the chamber. Some\r\nwere sleeping, while others tore at the fresh-killed carcasses of\r\nnew-brought prey, or fought among themselves in their love-making.\r\n\r\nHere in the dim light of their subterranean home the value of their\r\ngreat eyes was apparent, for these inner caves are shrouded in\r\nperpetual gloom that is but little less than utter darkness.\r\n\r\nTo attempt to pass through the midst of that fierce herd seemed, even\r\nto me, the height of folly, and so I proposed to Thuvan Dihn that he\r\nreturn to the outer world with Woola, that the two might find their way\r\nto civilization and come again with a sufficient force to overcome not\r\nonly the apts, but any further obstacles that might lie between us and\r\nour goal.\r\n\r\n“In the meantime,” I continued, “I may discover some means of winning\r\nmy way alone to the land of the yellow men, but if I am unsuccessful\r\none life only will have been sacrificed. Should we all go on and\r\nperish, there will be none to guide a succoring party to Dejah Thoris\r\nand your daughter.”\r\n\r\n“I shall not return and leave you here alone, John Carter,” replied\r\nThuvan Dihn. “Whether you go on to victory or death, the Jeddak of\r\nPtarth remains at your side. I have spoken.”\r\n\r\nI knew from his tone that it were useless to attempt to argue the\r\nquestion, and so I compromised by sending Woola back with a hastily\r\npenned note enclosed in a small metal case and fastened about his neck.\r\nI commanded the faithful creature to seek Carthoris at Helium, and\r\nthough half a world and countless dangers lay between I knew that if\r\nthe thing could be done Woola would do it.\r\n\r\nEquipped as he was by nature with marvelous speed and endurance, and\r\nwith frightful ferocity that made him a match for any single enemy of\r\nthe way, his keen intelligence and wondrous instinct should easily\r\nfurnish all else that was needed for the successful accomplishment of\r\nhis mission.\r\n\r\nIt was with evident reluctance that the great beast turned to leave me\r\nin compliance with my command, and ere he had gone I could not resist\r\nthe inclination to throw my arms about his great neck in a parting hug.\r\nHe rubbed his cheek against mine in a final caress, and a moment later\r\nwas speeding through the Carrion Caves toward the outer world.\r\n\r\nIn my note to Carthoris I had given explicit directions for locating\r\nthe Carrion Caves, impressing upon him the necessity for making\r\nentrance to the country beyond through this avenue, and not to attempt\r\nunder any circumstances to cross the ice-barrier with a fleet. I told\r\nhim that what lay beyond the eighth cave I could not even guess; but I\r\nwas sure that somewhere upon the other side of the ice-barrier his\r\nmother lay in the power of Matai Shang, and that possibly his\r\ngrandfather and great-grandfather as well, if they lived.\r\n\r\nFurther, I advised him to call upon Kulan Tith and the son of Thuvan\r\nDihn for warriors and ships that the expedition might be sufficiently\r\nstrong to insure success at the first blow.\r\n\r\n“And,” I concluded, “if there be time bring Tars Tarkas with you, for\r\nif I live until you reach me I can think of few greater pleasures than\r\nto fight once more, shoulder to shoulder, with my old friend.”\r\n\r\nWhen Woola had left us Thuvan Dihn and I, hiding in the seventh cave,\r\ndiscussed and discarded many plans for crossing the eighth chamber.\r\nFrom where we stood we saw that the fighting among the apts was growing\r\nless, and that many that had been feeding had ceased and lain down to\r\nsleep.\r\n\r\nPresently it became apparent that in a short time all the ferocious\r\nmonsters might be peacefully slumbering, and thus a hazardous\r\nopportunity be presented to us to cross through their lair.\r\n\r\nOne by one the remaining brutes stretched themselves upon the bubbling\r\ndecomposition that covered the mass of bones upon the floor of their\r\nden, until but a single apt remained awake. This huge fellow roamed\r\nrestlessly about, nosing among his companions and the abhorrent litter\r\nof the cave.\r\n\r\nOccasionally he would stop to peer intently toward first one of the\r\nexits from the chamber and then the other. His whole demeanor was as of\r\none who acts as sentry.\r\n\r\nWe were at last forced to the belief that he would not sleep while the\r\nother occupants of the lair slept, and so cast about in our minds for\r\nsome scheme whereby we might trick him. Finally I suggested a plan to\r\nThuvan Dihn, and as it seemed as good as any that we had discussed we\r\ndecided to put it to the test.\r\n\r\nTo this end Thuvan Dihn placed himself close against the cave’s wall,\r\nbeside the entrance to the eighth chamber, while I deliberately showed\r\nmyself to the guardian apt as he looked toward our retreat. Then I\r\nsprang to the opposite side of the entrance, flattening my body close\r\nto the wall.\r\n\r\nWithout a sound the great beast moved rapidly toward the seventh cave\r\nto see what manner of intruder had thus rashly penetrated so far within\r\nthe precincts of his habitation.\r\n\r\nAs he poked his head through the narrow aperture that connects the two\r\ncaves a heavy long-sword was awaiting him upon either hand, and before\r\nhe had an opportunity to emit even a single growl his severed head\r\nrolled at our feet.\r\n\r\nQuickly we glanced into the eighth chamber—not an apt had moved.\r\nCrawling over the carcass of the huge beast that blocked the doorway\r\nThuvan Dihn and I cautiously entered the forbidding and dangerous den.\r\n\r\nLike snails we wound our silent and careful way among the huge,\r\nrecumbent forms. The only sound above our breathing was the sucking\r\nnoise of our feet as we lifted them from the ooze of decaying flesh\r\nthrough which we crept.\r\n\r\nHalfway across the chamber and one of the mighty beasts directly before\r\nme moved restlessly at the very instant that my foot was poised above\r\nhis head, over which I must step.\r\n\r\nBreathlessly I waited, balancing upon one foot, for I did not dare move\r\na muscle. In my right hand was my keen short-sword, the point hovering\r\nan inch above the thick fur beneath which beat the savage heart.\r\n\r\nFinally the apt relaxed, sighing, as with the passing of a bad dream,\r\nand resumed the regular respiration of deep slumber. I planted my\r\nraised foot beyond the fierce head and an instant later had stepped\r\nover the beast.\r\n\r\nThuvan Dihn followed directly after me, and another moment found us at\r\nthe further door, undetected.\r\n\r\nThe Carrion Caves consist of a series of twenty-seven connecting\r\nchambers, and present the appearance of having been eroded by running\r\nwater in some far-gone age when a mighty river found its way to the\r\nsouth through this single breach in the barrier of rock and ice that\r\nhems the country of the pole.\r\n\r\nThuvan Dihn and I traversed the remaining nineteen caverns without\r\nadventure or mishap.\r\n\r\nWe were afterward to learn that but once a month is it possible to find\r\nall the apts of the Carrion Caves in a single chamber.\r\n\r\nAt other times they roam singly or in pairs in and out of the caves, so\r\nthat it would have been practically impossible for two men to have\r\npassed through the entire twenty-seven chambers without encountering an\r\napt in nearly every one of them. Once a month they sleep for a full\r\nday, and it was our good fortune to stumble by accident upon one of\r\nthese occasions.\r\n\r\nBeyond the last cave we emerged into a desolate country of snow and\r\nice, but found a well-marked trail leading north. The way was\r\nboulder-strewn, as had been that south of the barrier, so that we could\r\nsee but a short distance ahead of us at any time.\r\n\r\nAfter a couple of hours we passed round a huge boulder to come to a\r\nsteep declivity leading down into a valley.\r\n\r\nDirectly before us we saw a half dozen men—fierce, black-bearded\r\nfellows, with skins the color of a ripe lemon.\r\n\r\n“The yellow men of Barsoom!” ejaculated Thuvan Dihn, as though even now\r\nthat he saw them he found it scarce possible to believe that the very\r\nrace we expected to find hidden in this remote and inaccessible land\r\ndid really exist.\r\n\r\nWe withdrew behind an adjacent boulder to watch the actions of the\r\nlittle party, which stood huddled at the foot of another huge rock,\r\ntheir backs toward us.\r\n\r\nOne of them was peering round the edge of the granite mass as though\r\nwatching one who approached from the opposite side.\r\n\r\nPresently the object of his scrutiny came within the range of my vision\r\nand I saw that it was another yellow man. All were clothed in\r\nmagnificent furs—the six in the black and yellow striped hide of the\r\norluk, while he who approached alone was resplendent in the pure white\r\nskin of an apt.\r\n\r\nThe yellow men were armed with two swords, and a short javelin was\r\nslung across the back of each, while from their left arms hung cuplike\r\nshields no larger than a dinner plate, the concave sides of which\r\nturned outward toward an antagonist.\r\n\r\nThey seemed puny and futile implements of safety against an even\r\nordinary swordsman, but I was later to see the purpose of them and with\r\nwhat wondrous dexterity the yellow men manipulate them.\r\n\r\nOne of the swords which each of the warriors carried caught my\r\nimmediate attention. I call it a sword, but really it was a sharp-edged\r\nblade with a complete hook at the far end.\r\n\r\nThe other sword was of about the same length as the hooked instrument,\r\nand somewhere between that of my long-sword and my short-sword. It was\r\nstraight and two-edged. In addition to the weapons I have enumerated\r\neach man carried a dagger in his harness.\r\n\r\nAs the white-furred one approached, the six grasped their swords more\r\nfirmly—the hooked instrument in the left hand, the straight sword in\r\nthe right, while above the left wrist the small shield was held rigid\r\nupon a metal bracelet.\r\n\r\nAs the lone warrior came opposite them the six rushed out upon him with\r\nfiendish yells that resembled nothing more closely than the savage war\r\ncry of the Apaches of the South-west.\r\n\r\nInstantly the attacked drew both his swords, and as the six fell upon\r\nhim I witnessed as pretty fighting as one might care to see.\r\n\r\nWith their sharp hooks the combatants attempted to take hold of an\r\nadversary, but like lightning the cupshaped shield would spring before\r\nthe darting weapon and into its hollow the hook would plunge.\r\n\r\nOnce the lone warrior caught an antagonist in the side with his hook,\r\nand drawing him close ran his sword through him.\r\n\r\nBut the odds were too unequal, and, though he who fought alone was by\r\nfar the best and bravest of them all, I saw that it was but a question\r\nof time before the remaining five would find an opening through his\r\nmarvelous guard and bring him down.\r\n\r\nNow my sympathies have ever been with the weaker side of an argument,\r\nand though I knew nothing of the cause of the trouble I could not stand\r\nidly by and see a brave man butchered by superior numbers.\r\n\r\nAs a matter of fact I presume I gave little attention to seeking an\r\nexcuse, for I love a good fight too well to need any other reason for\r\njoining in when one is afoot.\r\n\r\nSo it was that before Thuvan Dihn knew what I was about he saw me\r\nstanding by the side of the white-clad yellow man, battling like mad\r\nwith his five adversaries.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nWITH THE YELLOW MEN\r\n\r\n\r\nThuvan Dihn was not long in joining me; and, though we found the hooked\r\nweapon a strange and savage thing with which to deal, the three of us\r\nsoon despatched the five black-bearded warriors who opposed us.\r\n\r\nWhen the battle was over our new acquaintance turned to me, and\r\nremoving the shield from his wrist, held it out. I did not know the\r\nsignificance of his act, but judged that it was but a form of\r\nexpressing his gratitude to me.\r\n\r\nI afterward learned that it symbolized the offering of a man’s life in\r\nreturn for some great favor done him; and my act of refusing, which I\r\nhad immediately done, was what was expected of me.\r\n\r\n“Then accept from Talu, Prince of Marentina,” said the yellow man,\r\n“this token of my gratitude,” and reaching beneath one of his wide\r\nsleeves he withdrew a bracelet and placed it upon my arm. He then went\r\nthrough the same ceremony with Thuvan Dihn.\r\n\r\nNext he asked our names, and from what land we hailed. He seemed quite\r\nfamiliar with the geography of the outerworld, and when I said I was\r\nfrom Helium he raised his brows.\r\n\r\n“Ah,” he said, “you seek your ruler and his company?”\r\n\r\n“Know you of them?” I asked.\r\n\r\n“But little more than that they were captured by my uncle, Salensus\r\nOll, Jeddak of Jeddaks, Ruler of Okar, land of the yellow men of\r\nBarsoom. As to their fate I know nothing, for I am at war with my\r\nuncle, who would crush my power in the principality of Marentina.\r\n\r\n“These from whom you have just saved me are warriors he has sent out to\r\nfind and slay me, for they know that often I come alone to hunt and\r\nkill the sacred apt which Salensus Oll so much reveres. It is partly\r\nbecause I hate his religion that Salensus Oll hates me; but mostly does\r\nhe fear my growing power and the great faction which has arisen\r\nthroughout Okar that would be glad to see me ruler of Okar and Jeddak\r\nof Jeddaks in his place.\r\n\r\n“He is a cruel and tyrannous master whom all hate, and were it not for\r\nthe great fear they have of him I could raise an army overnight that\r\nwould wipe out the few that might remain loyal to him. My own people\r\nare faithful to me, and the little valley of Marentina has paid no\r\ntribute to the court of Salensus Oll for a year.\r\n\r\n“Nor can he force us, for a dozen men may hold the narrow way to\r\nMarentina against a million. But now, as to thine own affairs. How may\r\nI aid you? My palace is at your disposal, if you wish to honor me by\r\ncoming to Marentina.”\r\n\r\n“When our work is done we shall be glad to accept your invitation,” I\r\nreplied. “But now you can assist us most by directing us to the court\r\nof Salensus Oll, and suggesting some means by which we may gain\r\nadmission to the city and the palace, or whatever other place we find\r\nour friends to be confined.”\r\n\r\nTalu gazed ruefully at our smooth faces and at Thuvan Dihn’s red skin\r\nand my white one.\r\n\r\n“First you must come to Marentina,” he said, “for a great change must\r\nbe wrought in your appearance before you can hope to enter any city in\r\nOkar. You must have yellow faces and black beards, and your apparel and\r\ntrappings must be those least likely to arouse suspicion. In my palace\r\nis one who can make you appear as truly yellow men as does Salensus Oll\r\nhimself.”\r\n\r\nHis counsel seemed wise; and as there was apparently no other way to\r\ninsure a successful entry to Kadabra, the capital city of Okar, we set\r\nout with Talu, Prince of Marentina, for his little, rock-bound country.\r\n\r\nThe way was over some of the worst traveling I have ever seen, and I do\r\nnot wonder that in this land where there are neither thoats nor fliers\r\nthat Marentina is in little fear of invasion; but at last we reached\r\nour destination, the first view of which I had from a slight elevation\r\na half-mile from the city.\r\n\r\nNestled in a deep valley lay a city of Martian concrete, whose every\r\nstreet and plaza and open space was roofed with glass. All about lay\r\nsnow and ice, but there was none upon the rounded, domelike, crystal\r\ncovering that enveloped the whole city.\r\n\r\nThen I saw how these people combated the rigors of the arctic, and\r\nlived in luxury and comfort in the midst of a land of perpetual ice.\r\nTheir cities were veritable hothouses, and when I had come within this\r\none my respect and admiration for the scientific and engineering skill\r\nof this buried nation was unbounded.\r\n\r\nThe moment we entered the city Talu threw off his outer garments of\r\nfur, as did we, and I saw that his apparel differed but little from\r\nthat of the red races of Barsoom. Except for his leathern harness,\r\ncovered thick with jewels and metal, he was naked, nor could one have\r\ncomfortably worn apparel in that warm and humid atmosphere.\r\n\r\nFor three days we remained the guests of Prince Talu, and during that\r\ntime he showered upon us every attention and courtesy within his power.\r\nHe showed us all that was of interest in his great city.\r\n\r\nThe Marentina atmosphere plant will maintain life indefinitely in the\r\ncities of the north pole after all life upon the balance of dying Mars\r\nis extinct through the failure of the air supply, should the great\r\ncentral plant again cease functioning as it did upon that memorable\r\noccasion that gave me the opportunity of restoring life and happiness\r\nto the strange world that I had already learned to love so well.\r\n\r\nHe showed us the heating system that stores the sun’s rays in great\r\nreservoirs beneath the city, and how little is necessary to maintain\r\nthe perpetual summer heat of the glorious garden spot within this\r\narctic paradise.\r\n\r\nBroad avenues of sod sewn with the seed of the ocher vegetation of the\r\ndead sea bottoms carried the noiseless traffic of light and airy ground\r\nfliers that are the only form of artificial transportation used north\r\nof the gigantic ice-barrier.\r\n\r\nThe broad tires of these unique fliers are but rubber-like gas bags\r\nfilled with the eighth Barsoomian ray, or ray of propulsion—that\r\nremarkable discovery of the Martians that has made possible the great\r\nfleets of mighty airships that render the red man of the outer world\r\nsupreme. It is this ray which propels the inherent or reflected light\r\nof the planet off into space, and when confined gives to the Martian\r\ncraft their airy buoyancy.\r\n\r\nThe ground fliers of Marentina contain just sufficient buoyancy in\r\ntheir automobile-like wheels to give the cars traction for steering\r\npurposes; and though the hind wheels are geared to the engine, and aid\r\nin driving the machine, the bulk of this work is carried by a small\r\npropeller at the stern.\r\n\r\nI know of no more delightful sensation than that of riding in one of\r\nthese luxuriously appointed cars which skim, light and airy as\r\nfeathers, along the soft, mossy avenues of Marentina. They move with\r\nabsolute noiselessness between borders of crimson sward and beneath\r\narching trees gorgeous with the wondrous blooms that mark so many of\r\nthe highly cultivated varieties of Barsoomian vegetation.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the third day the court barber—I can think of no other\r\nearthly appellation by which to describe him—had wrought so remarkable\r\na transformation in both Thuvan Dihn and myself that our own wives\r\nwould never have known us. Our skins were of the same lemon color as\r\nhis own, and great, black beards and mustaches had been deftly affixed\r\nto our smooth faces. The trappings of warriors of Okar aided in the\r\ndeception; and for wear beyond the hothouse cities we each had suits of\r\nthe black- and yellow-striped orluk.\r\n\r\nTalu gave us careful directions for the journey to Kadabra, the capital\r\ncity of the Okar nation, which is the racial name of the yellow men.\r\nThis good friend even accompanied us part way, and then, promising to\r\naid us in any way that he found possible, bade us adieu.\r\n\r\nOn parting he slipped upon my finger a curiously wrought ring set with\r\na dead-black, lusterless stone, which appeared more like a bit of\r\nbituminous coal than the priceless Barsoomian gem which in reality it\r\nis.\r\n\r\n“There had been but three others cut from the mother stone,” he said,\r\n“which is in my possession. These three are worn by nobles high in my\r\nconfidence, all of whom have been sent on secret missions to the court\r\nof Salensus Oll.\r\n\r\n“Should you come within fifty feet of any of these three you will feel\r\na rapid, pricking sensation in the finger upon which you wear this\r\nring. He who wears one of its mates will experience the same feeling;\r\nit is caused by an electrical action that takes place the moment two of\r\nthese gems cut from the same mother stone come within the radius of\r\neach other’s power. By it you will know that a friend is at hand upon\r\nwhom you may depend for assistance in time of need.\r\n\r\n“Should another wearer of one of these gems call upon you for aid do\r\nnot deny him, and should death threaten you swallow the ring rather\r\nthan let it fall into the hands of enemies. Guard it with your life,\r\nJohn Carter, for some day it may mean more than life to you.”\r\n\r\nWith this parting admonition our good friend turned back toward\r\nMarentina, and we set our faces in the direction of the city of Kadabra\r\nand the court of Salensus Oll, Jeddak of Jeddaks.\r\n\r\nThat very evening we came within sight of the walled and glass-roofed\r\ncity of Kadabra. It lies in a low depression near the pole, surrounded\r\nby rocky, snow-clad hills. From the pass through which we entered the\r\nvalley we had a splendid view of this great city of the north. Its\r\ncrystal domes sparkled in the brilliant sunlight gleaming above the\r\nfrost-covered outer wall that circles the entire one hundred miles of\r\nits circumference.\r\n\r\nAt regular intervals great gates give entrance to the city; but even at\r\nthe distance from which we looked upon the massive pile we could see\r\nthat all were closed, and, in accordance with Talu’s suggestion, we\r\ndeferred attempting to enter the city until the following morning.\r\n\r\nAs he had said, we found numerous caves in the hillsides about us, and\r\ninto one of these we crept for the night. Our warm orluk skins kept us\r\nperfectly comfortable, and it was only after a most refreshing sleep\r\nthat we awoke shortly after daylight on the following morning.\r\n\r\nAlready the city was astir, and from several of the gates we saw\r\nparties of yellow men emerging. Following closely each detail of the\r\ninstructions given us by our good friend of Marentina, we remained\r\nconcealed for several hours until one party of some half dozen warriors\r\nhad passed along the trail below our hiding place and entered the hills\r\nby way of the pass along which we had come the previous evening.\r\n\r\nAfter giving them time to get well out of sight of our cave, Thuvan\r\nDihn and I crept out and followed them, overtaking them when they were\r\nwell into the hills.\r\n\r\nWhen we had come almost to them I called aloud to their leader, when\r\nthe whole party halted and turned toward us. The crucial test had come.\r\nCould we but deceive these men the rest would be comparatively easy.\r\n\r\n“Kaor!” I cried as I came closer to them.\r\n\r\n“Kaor!” responded the officer in charge of the party.\r\n\r\n“We be from Illall,” I continued, giving the name of the most remote\r\ncity of Okar, which has little or no intercourse with Kadabra. “Only\r\nyesterday we arrived, and this morning the captain of the gate told us\r\nthat you were setting out to hunt orluks, which is a sport we do not\r\nfind in our own neighborhood. We have hastened after you to pray that\r\nyou allow us to accompany you.”\r\n\r\nThe officer was entirely deceived, and graciously permitted us to go\r\nwith them for the day. The chance guess that they were bound upon an\r\norluk hunt proved correct, and Talu had said that the chances were ten\r\nto one that such would be the mission of any party leaving Kadabra by\r\nthe pass through which we entered the valley, since that way leads\r\ndirectly to the vast plains frequented by this elephantine beast of\r\nprey.\r\n\r\nIn so far as the hunt was concerned, the day was a failure, for we did\r\nnot see a single orluk; but this proved more than fortunate for us,\r\nsince the yellow men were so chagrined by their misfortune that they\r\nwould not enter the city by the same gate by which they had left it in\r\nthe morning, as it seemed that they had made great boasts to the\r\ncaptain of that gate about their skill at this dangerous sport.\r\n\r\nWe, therefore, approached Kadabra at a point several miles from that at\r\nwhich the party had quitted it in the morning, and so were relieved of\r\nthe danger of embarrassing questions and explanations on the part of\r\nthe gate captain, whom we had said had directed us to this particular\r\nhunting party.\r\n\r\nWe had come quite close to the city when my attention was attracted\r\ntoward a tall, black shaft that reared its head several hundred feet\r\ninto the air from what appeared to be a tangled mass of junk or\r\nwreckage, now partially snow-covered.\r\n\r\nI did not dare venture an inquiry for fear of arousing suspicion by\r\nevident ignorance of something which as a yellow man I should have\r\nknown; but before we reached the city gate I was to learn the purpose\r\nof that grim shaft and the meaning of the mighty accumulation beneath\r\nit.\r\n\r\nWe had come almost to the gate when one of the party called to his\r\nfellows, at the same time pointing toward the distant southern horizon.\r\nFollowing the direction he indicated, my eyes descried the hull of a\r\nlarge flier approaching rapidly from above the crest of the encircling\r\nhills.\r\n\r\n“Still other fools who would solve the mysteries of the forbidden\r\nnorth,” said the officer, half to himself. “Will they never cease their\r\nfatal curiosity?”\r\n\r\n“Let us hope not,” answered one of the warriors, “for then what should\r\nwe do for slaves and sport?”\r\n\r\n“True; but what stupid beasts they are to continue to come to a region\r\nfrom whence none of them ever has returned.”\r\n\r\n“Let us tarry and watch the end of this one,” suggested one of the men.\r\n\r\nThe officer looked toward the city.\r\n\r\n“The watch has seen him,” he said; “we may remain, for we may be\r\nneeded.”\r\n\r\nI looked toward the city and saw several hundred warriors issuing from\r\nthe nearest gate. They moved leisurely, as though there were no need\r\nfor haste—nor was there, as I was presently to learn.\r\n\r\nThen I turned my eyes once more toward the flier. She was moving\r\nrapidly toward the city, and when she had come close enough I was\r\nsurprised to see that her propellers were idle.\r\n\r\nStraight for that grim shaft she bore. At the last minute I saw the\r\ngreat blades move to reverse her, yet on she came as though drawn by\r\nsome mighty, irresistible power.\r\n\r\nIntense excitement prevailed upon her deck, where men were running\r\nhither and thither, manning the guns and preparing to launch the small,\r\none-man fliers, a fleet of which is part of the equipment of every\r\nMartian war vessel. Closer and closer to the black shaft the ship sped.\r\nIn another instant she must strike, and then I saw the familiar signal\r\nflown that sends the lesser boats in a great flock from the deck of the\r\nmother ship.\r\n\r\nInstantly a hundred tiny fliers rose from her deck, like a swarm of\r\nhuge dragon flies; but scarcely were they clear of the battleship than\r\nthe nose of each turned toward the shaft, and they, too, rushed on at\r\nfrightful speed toward the same now seemingly inevitable end that\r\nmenaced the larger vessel.\r\n\r\nA moment later the collision came. Men were hurled in every direction\r\nfrom the ship’s deck, while she, bent and crumpled, took the last, long\r\nplunge to the scrap-heap at the shaft’s base.\r\n\r\nWith her fell a shower of her own tiny fliers, for each of them had\r\ncome in violent collision with the solid shaft.\r\n\r\nI noticed that the wrecked fliers scraped down the shaft’s side, and\r\nthat their fall was not as rapid as might have been expected; and then\r\nsuddenly the secret of the shaft burst upon me, and with it an\r\nexplanation of the cause that prevented a flier that passed too far\r\nacross the ice-barrier ever returning.\r\n\r\nThe shaft was a mighty magnet, and when once a vessel came within the\r\nradius of its powerful attraction for the aluminum steel that enters so\r\nlargely into the construction of all Barsoomian craft, no power on\r\nearth could prevent such an end as we had just witnessed.\r\n\r\nI afterward learned that the shaft rests directly over the magnetic\r\npole of Mars, but whether this adds in any way to its incalculable\r\npower of attraction I do not know. I am a fighting man, not a\r\nscientist.\r\n\r\nHere, at last, was an explanation of the long absence of Tardos Mors\r\nand Mors Kajak. These valiant and intrepid warriors had dared the\r\nmysteries and dangers of the frozen north to search for Carthoris,\r\nwhose long absence had bowed in grief the head of his beautiful mother,\r\nDejah Thoris, Princess of Helium.\r\n\r\nThe moment that the last of the fliers came to rest at the base of the\r\nshaft the black-bearded, yellow warriors swarmed over the mass of\r\nwreckage upon which they lay, making prisoners of those who were\r\nuninjured and occasionally despatching with a sword-thrust one of the\r\nwounded who seemed prone to resent their taunts and insults.\r\n\r\nA few of the uninjured red men battled bravely against their cruel\r\nfoes, but for the most part they seemed too overwhelmed by the horror\r\nof the catastrophe that had befallen them to do more than submit\r\nsupinely to the golden chains with which they were manacled.\r\n\r\nWhen the last of the prisoners had been confined, the party returned to\r\nthe city, at the gate of which we met a pack of fierce, gold-collared\r\napts, each of which marched between two warriors, who held them with\r\nstrong chains of the same metal as their collars.\r\n\r\nJust beyond the gate the attendants loosened the whole terrible herd,\r\nand as they bounded off toward the grim, black shaft I did not need to\r\nask to know their mission. Had there not been those within the cruel\r\ncity of Kadabra who needed succor far worse than the poor unfortunate\r\ndead and dying out there in the cold upon the bent and broken carcasses\r\nof a thousand fliers I could not have restrained my desire to hasten\r\nback and do battle with those horrid creatures that had been despatched\r\nto rend and devour them.\r\n\r\nAs it was I could but follow the yellow warriors, with bowed head, and\r\ngive thanks for the chance that had given Thuvan Dihn and me such easy\r\ningress to the capital of Salensus Oll.\r\n\r\nOnce within the gates, we had no difficulty in eluding our friends of\r\nthe morning, and presently found ourselves in a Martian hostelry.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nIN DURANCE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe public houses of Barsoom, I have found, vary but little. There is\r\nno privacy for other than married couples.\r\n\r\nMen without their wives are escorted to a large chamber, the floor of\r\nwhich is usually of white marble or heavy glass, kept scrupulously\r\nclean. Here are many small, raised platforms for the guest’s sleeping\r\nsilks and furs, and if he have none of his own clean, fresh ones are\r\nfurnished at a nominal charge.\r\n\r\nOnce a man’s belongings have been deposited upon one of these platforms\r\nhe is a guest of the house, and that platform his own until he leaves.\r\nNo one will disturb or molest his belongings, as there are no thieves\r\nupon Mars.\r\n\r\nAs assassination is the one thing to be feared, the proprietors of the\r\nhostelries furnish armed guards, who pace back and forth through the\r\nsleeping-rooms day and night. The number of guards and gorgeousness of\r\ntheir trappings quite usually denote the status of the hotel.\r\n\r\nNo meals are served in these houses, but generally a public eating\r\nplace adjoins them. Baths are connected with the sleeping chambers, and\r\neach guest is required to bathe daily or depart from the hotel.\r\n\r\nUsually on a second or third floor there is a large sleeping-room for\r\nsingle women guests, but its appointments do not vary materially from\r\nthe chamber occupied by men. The guards who watch the women remain in\r\nthe corridor outside the sleeping chamber, while female slaves pace\r\nback and forth among the sleepers within, ready to notify the warriors\r\nshould their presence be required.\r\n\r\nI was surprised to note that all the guards with the hotel at which we\r\nstopped were red men, and on inquiring of one of them I learned that\r\nthey were slaves purchased by the proprietors of the hotels from the\r\ngovernment. The man whose post was past my sleeping platform had been\r\ncommander of the navy of a great Martian nation; but fate had carried\r\nhis flagship across the ice-barrier within the radius of power of the\r\nmagnetic shaft, and now for many tedious years he had been a slave of\r\nthe yellow men.\r\n\r\nHe told me that princes, jeds, and even jeddaks of the outer world,\r\nwere among the menials who served the yellow race; but when I asked him\r\nif he had heard of the fate of Mors Kajak or Tardos Mors he shook his\r\nhead, saying that he never had heard of their being prisoners here,\r\nthough he was very familiar with the reputations and fame they bore in\r\nthe outer world.\r\n\r\nNeither had he heard any rumor of the coming of the Father of Therns\r\nand the black dator of the First Born, but he hastened to explain that\r\nhe knew little of what took place within the palace. I could see that\r\nhe wondered not a little that a yellow man should be so inquisitive\r\nabout certain red prisoners from beyond the ice-barrier, and that I\r\nshould be so ignorant of customs and conditions among my own race.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I had forgotten my disguise upon discovering a red man pacing\r\nbefore my sleeping platform; but his growing expression of surprise\r\nwarned me in time, for I had no mind to reveal my identity to any\r\nunless some good could come of it, and I did not see how this poor\r\nfellow could serve me yet, though I had it in my mind that later I\r\nmight be the means of serving him and all the other thousands of\r\nprisoners who do the bidding of their stern masters in Kadabra.\r\n\r\nThuvan Dihn and I discussed our plans as we sat together among our\r\nsleeping silks and furs that night in the midst of the hundreds of\r\nyellow men who occupied the apartment with us. We spoke in low\r\nwhispers, but, as that is only what courtesy demands in a public\r\nsleeping place, we roused no suspicion.\r\n\r\nAt last, determining that all must be but idle speculation until after\r\nwe had had a chance to explore the city and attempt to put into\r\nexecution the plan Talu had suggested, we bade each other good night\r\nand turned to sleep.\r\n\r\nAfter breakfasting the following morning we set out to see Kadabra, and\r\nas, through the generosity of the prince of Marentina, we were well\r\nsupplied with the funds current in Okar we purchased a handsome ground\r\nflier. Having learned to drive them while in Marentina, we spent a\r\ndelightful and profitable day exploring the city, and late in the\r\nafternoon at the hour Talu told us we would find government officials\r\nin their offices, we stopped before a magnificent building on the plaza\r\nopposite the royal grounds and the palace.\r\n\r\nHere we walked boldly in past the armed guard at the door, to be met by\r\na red slave within who asked our wishes.\r\n\r\n“Tell Sorav, your master, that two warriors from Illall wish to take\r\nservice in the palace guard,” I said.\r\n\r\nSorav, Talu had told us, was the commander of the forces of the palace,\r\nand as men from the further cities of Okar—and especially Illall—were\r\nless likely to be tainted with the germ of intrigue which had for years\r\ninfected the household of Salensus Oll, he was sure that we would be\r\nwelcomed and few questions asked us.\r\n\r\nHe had primed us with such general information as he thought would be\r\nnecessary for us to pass muster before Sorav, after which we would have\r\nto undergo a further examination before Salensus Oll that he might\r\ndetermine our physical fitness and our ability as warriors.\r\n\r\nThe little experience we had had with the strange hooked sword of the\r\nyellow man and his cuplike shield made it seem rather unlikely that\r\neither of us could pass this final test, but there was the chance that\r\nwe might be quartered in the palace of Salensus Oll for several days\r\nafter being accepted by Sorav before the Jeddak of Jeddaks would find\r\ntime to put us to the final test.\r\n\r\nAfter a wait of several minutes in an ante-chamber we were summoned\r\ninto the private office of Sorav, where we were courteously greeted by\r\nthis ferocious-appearing, black-bearded officer. He asked us our names\r\nand stations in our own city, and having received replies that were\r\nevidently satisfactory to him, he put certain questions to us that Talu\r\nhad foreseen and prepared us for.\r\n\r\nThe interview could not have lasted over ten minutes when Sorav\r\nsummoned an aid whom he instructed to record us properly, and then\r\nescort us to the quarters in the palace which are set aside for\r\naspirants to membership in the palace guard.\r\n\r\nThe aid took us to his own office first, where he measured and weighed\r\nand photographed us simultaneously with a machine ingeniously devised\r\nfor that purpose, five copies being instantly reproduced in five\r\ndifferent offices of the government, two of which are located in other\r\ncities miles distant. Then he led us through the palace grounds to the\r\nmain guardroom of the palace, there turning us over to the officer in\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\nThis individual again questioned us briefly, and finally despatched a\r\nsoldier to guide us to our quarters. These we found located upon the\r\nsecond floor of the palace in a semi-detached tower at the rear of the\r\nedifice.\r\n\r\nWhen we asked our guide why we were quartered so far from the guardroom\r\nhe replied that the custom of the older members of the guard of picking\r\nquarrels with aspirants to try their metal had resulted in so many\r\ndeaths that it was found difficult to maintain the guard at its full\r\nstrength while this custom prevailed. Salensus Oll had, therefore, set\r\napart these quarters for aspirants, and here they were securely locked\r\nagainst the danger of attack by members of the guard.\r\n\r\nThis unwelcome information put a sudden check to all our well-laid\r\nplans, for it meant that we should virtually be prisoners in the palace\r\nof Salensus Oll until the time that he should see fit to give us the\r\nfinal examination for efficiency.\r\n\r\nAs it was this interval upon which we had banked to accomplish so much\r\nin our search for Dejah Thoris and Thuvia of Ptarth, our chagrin was\r\nunbounded when we heard the great lock click behind our guide as he had\r\nquitted us after ushering us into the chambers we were to occupy.\r\n\r\nWith a wry face I turned to Thuvan Dihn. My companion but shook his\r\nhead disconsolately and walked to one of the windows upon the far side\r\nof the apartment.\r\n\r\nScarcely had he gazed beyond them than he called to me in a tone of\r\nsuppressed excitement and surprise. In an instant I was by his side.\r\n\r\n“Look!” said Thuvan Dihn, pointing toward the courtyard below.\r\n\r\nAs my eyes followed the direction indicated I saw two women pacing back\r\nand forth in an enclosed garden.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment I recognized them—they were Dejah Thoris and Thuvia\r\nof Ptarth!\r\n\r\nThere were they whom I had trailed from one pole to another, the length\r\nof a world. Only ten feet of space and a few metal bars separated me\r\nfrom them.\r\n\r\nWith a cry I attracted their attention, and as Dejah Thoris looked up\r\nfull into my eyes I made the sign of love that the men of Barsoom make\r\nto their women.\r\n\r\nTo my astonishment and horror her head went high, and as a look of\r\nutter contempt touched her finely chiseled features she turned her back\r\nfull upon me. My body is covered with the scars of a thousand\r\nconflicts, but never in all my long life have I suffered such anguish\r\nfrom a wound, for this time the steel of a woman’s look had entered my\r\nheart.\r\n\r\nWith a groan I turned away and buried my face in my arms. I heard\r\nThuvan Dihn call aloud to Thuvia, but an instant later his exclamation\r\nof surprise betokened that he, too, had been repulsed by his own\r\ndaughter.\r\n\r\n“They will not even listen,” he cried to me. “They have put their hands\r\nover their ears and walked to the farther end of the garden. Ever heard\r\nyou of such mad work, John Carter? The two must be bewitched.”\r\n\r\nPresently I mustered the courage to return to the window, for even\r\nthough she spurned me I loved her, and could not keep my eyes from\r\nfeasting upon her divine face and figure, but when she saw me looking\r\nshe again turned away.\r\n\r\nI was at my wit’s end to account for her strange actions, and that\r\nThuvia, too, had turned against her father seemed incredible. Could it\r\nbe that my incomparable princess still clung to the hideous faith from\r\nwhich I had rescued her world? Could it be that she looked upon me with\r\nloathing and contempt because I had returned from the Valley Dor, or\r\nbecause I had desecrated the temples and persons of the Holy Therns?\r\n\r\nTo naught else could I ascribe her strange deportment, yet it seemed\r\nfar from possible that such could be the case, for the love of Dejah\r\nThoris for John Carter had been a great and wondrous love—far above\r\nracial distinctions, creed, or religion.\r\n\r\nAs I gazed ruefully at the back of her haughty, royal head a gate at\r\nthe opposite end of the garden opened and a man entered. As he did so\r\nhe turned and slipped something into the hand of the yellow guardsman\r\nbeyond the gate, nor was the distance too great that I might not see\r\nthat money had passed between them.\r\n\r\nInstantly I knew that this newcomer had bribed his way within the\r\ngarden. Then he turned in the direction of the two women, and I saw\r\nthat he was none other than Thurid, the black dator of the First Born.\r\n\r\nHe approached quite close to them before he spoke, and as they turned\r\nat the sound of his voice I saw Dejah Thoris shrink from him.\r\n\r\nThere was a nasty leer upon his face as he stepped close to her and\r\nspoke again. I could not hear his words, but her answer came clearly.\r\n\r\n“The granddaughter of Tardos Mors can always die,” she said, “but she\r\ncould never live at the price you name.”\r\n\r\nThen I saw the black scoundrel go upon his knees beside her, fairly\r\ngroveling in the dirt, pleading with her. Only part of what he said\r\ncame to me, for though he was evidently laboring under the stress of\r\npassion and excitement, it was equally apparent that he did not dare\r\nraise his voice for fear of detection.\r\n\r\n“I would save you from Matai Shang,” I heard him say. “You know the\r\nfate that awaits you at his hands. Would you not choose me rather than\r\nthe other?”\r\n\r\n“I would choose neither,” replied Dejah Thoris, “even were I free to\r\nchoose, as you know well I am not.”\r\n\r\n“You ARE free!” he cried. “John Carter, Prince of Helium, is dead.”\r\n\r\n“I know better than that; but even were he dead, and I must needs\r\nchoose another mate, it should be a plant man or a great white ape in\r\npreference to either Matai Shang or you, black calot,” she answered\r\nwith a sneer of contempt.\r\n\r\nOf a sudden the vicious beast lost all control of himself, as with a\r\nvile oath he leaped at the slender woman, gripping her tender throat in\r\nhis brute clutch. Thuvia screamed and sprang to aid her\r\nfellow-prisoner, and at the same instant I, too, went mad, and tearing\r\nat the bars that spanned my window I ripped them from their sockets as\r\nthey had been but copper wire.\r\n\r\nHurling myself through the aperture I reached the garden, but a hundred\r\nfeet from where the black was choking the life from my Dejah Thoris,\r\nand with a single great bound I was upon him. I spoke no word as I tore\r\nhis defiling fingers from that beautiful throat, nor did I utter a\r\nsound as I hurled him twenty feet from me.\r\n\r\nFoaming with rage, Thurid regained his feet and charged me like a mad\r\nbull.\r\n\r\n“Yellow man,” he shrieked, “you knew not upon whom you had laid your\r\nvile hands, but ere I am done with you, you will know well what it\r\nmeans to offend the person of a First Born.”\r\n\r\nThen he was upon me, reaching for my throat, and precisely as I had\r\ndone that day in the courtyard of the Temple of Issus I did here in the\r\ngarden of the palace of Salensus Oll. I ducked beneath his outstretched\r\narms, and as he lunged past me I planted a terrific right upon the side\r\nof his jaw.\r\n\r\nJust as he had done upon that other occasion he did now. Like a top he\r\nspun round, his knees gave beneath him, and he crumpled to the ground\r\nat my feet. Then I heard a voice behind me.\r\n\r\nIt was the deep voice of authority that marks the ruler of men, and\r\nwhen I turned to face the resplendent figure of a giant yellow man I\r\ndid not need to ask to know that it was Salensus Oll. At his right\r\nstood Matai Shang, and behind them a score of guardsmen.\r\n\r\n“Who are you,” he cried, “and what means this intrusion within the\r\nprecincts of the women’s garden? I do not recall your face. How came\r\nyou here?”\r\n\r\nBut for his last words I should have forgotten my disguise entirely and\r\ntold him outright that I was John Carter, Prince of Helium; but his\r\nquestion recalled me to myself. I pointed to the dislodged bars of the\r\nwindow above.\r\n\r\n“I am an aspirant to membership in the palace guard,” I said, “and from\r\nyonder window in the tower where I was confined awaiting the final test\r\nfor fitness I saw this brute attack the—this woman. I could not stand\r\nidly by, O Jeddak, and see this thing done within the very palace\r\ngrounds, and yet feel that I was fit to serve and guard your royal\r\nperson.”\r\n\r\nI had evidently made an impression upon the ruler of Okar by my fair\r\nwords, and when he had turned to Dejah Thoris and Thuvia of Ptarth, and\r\nboth had corroborated my statements it began to look pretty dark for\r\nThurid.\r\n\r\nI saw the ugly gleam in Matai Shang’s evil eyes as Dejah Thoris\r\nnarrated all that had passed between Thurid and herself, and when she\r\ncame to that part which dealt with my interference with the dator of\r\nthe First Born her gratitude was quite apparent, though I could see by\r\nher eyes that something puzzled her strangely.\r\n\r\nI did not wonder at her attitude toward me while others were present;\r\nbut that she should have denied me while she and Thuvia were the only\r\noccupants of the garden still cut me sorely.\r\n\r\nAs the examination proceeded I cast a glance at Thurid and startled him\r\nlooking wide-eyed and wonderingly at me, and then of a sudden he\r\nlaughed full in my face.\r\n\r\nA moment later Salensus Oll turned toward the black.\r\n\r\n“What have you to say in explanation of these charges?” he asked in a\r\ndeep and terrible voice. “Dare you aspire to one whom the Father of\r\nTherns has chosen—one who might even be a fit mate for the Jeddak of\r\nJeddaks himself?”\r\n\r\nAnd then the black-bearded tyrant turned and cast a sudden greedy look\r\nupon Dejah Thoris, as though with the words a new thought and a new\r\ndesire had sprung up within his mind and breast.\r\n\r\nThurid had been about to reply and, with a malicious grin upon his\r\nface, was pointing an accusing finger at me, when Salensus Oll’s words\r\nand the expression of his face cut him short.\r\n\r\nA cunning look crept into his eyes, and I knew from the expression of\r\nhis face that his next words were not the ones he had intended to\r\nspeak.\r\n\r\n“O Mightiest of Jeddaks,” he said, “the man and the women do not speak\r\nthe truth. The fellow had come into the garden to assist them to\r\nescape. I was beyond and overheard their conversation, and when I\r\nentered, the woman screamed and the man sprang upon me and would have\r\nkilled me.\r\n\r\n“What know you of this man? He is a stranger to you, and I dare say\r\nthat you will find him an enemy and a spy. Let him be put on trial,\r\nSalensus Oll, rather than your friend and guest, Thurid, Dator of the\r\nFirst Born.”\r\n\r\nSalensus Oll looked puzzled. He turned again and looked upon Dejah\r\nThoris, and then Thurid stepped quite close to him and whispered\r\nsomething in his ear—what, I know not.\r\n\r\nPresently the yellow ruler turned to one of his officers.\r\n\r\n“See that this man be securely confined until we have time to go deeper\r\ninto this affair,” he commanded, “and as bars alone seem inadequate to\r\nrestrain him, let chains be added.”\r\n\r\nThen he turned and left the garden, taking Dejah Thoris with him—his\r\nhand upon her shoulder. Thurid and Matai Shang went also, and as they\r\nreached the gateway the black turned and laughed again aloud in my\r\nface.\r\n\r\nWhat could be the meaning of his sudden change toward me? Could he\r\nsuspect my true identity? It must be that, and the thing that had\r\nbetrayed me was the trick and blow that had laid him low for the second\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nAs the guards dragged me away my heart was very sad and bitter indeed,\r\nfor now to the two relentless enemies that had hounded her for so long\r\nanother and a more powerful one had been added, for I would have been\r\nbut a fool had I not recognized the sudden love for Dejah Thoris that\r\nhad just been born in the terrible breast of Salensus Oll, Jeddak of\r\nJeddaks, ruler of Okar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PIT OF PLENTY\r\n\r\n\r\nI did not languish long within the prison of Salensus Oll. During the\r\nshort time that I lay there, fettered with chains of gold, I often\r\nwondered as to the fate of Thuvan Dihn, Jeddak of Ptarth.\r\n\r\nMy brave companion had followed me into the garden as I attacked\r\nThurid, and when Salensus Oll had left with Dejah Thoris and the\r\nothers, leaving Thuvia of Ptarth behind, he, too, had remained in the\r\ngarden with his daughter, apparently unnoticed, for he was appareled\r\nsimilarly to the guards.\r\n\r\nThe last I had seen of him he stood waiting for the warriors who\r\nescorted me to close the gate behind them, that he might be alone with\r\nThuvia. Could it be possible that they had escaped? I doubted it, and\r\nyet with all my heart I hoped that it might be true.\r\n\r\nThe third day of my incarceration brought a dozen warriors to escort me\r\nto the audience chamber, where Salensus Oll himself was to try me. A\r\ngreat number of nobles crowded the room, and among them I saw Thurid,\r\nbut Matai Shang was not there.\r\n\r\nDejah Thoris, as radiantly beautiful as ever, sat upon a small throne\r\nbeside Salensus Oll. The expression of sad hopelessness upon her dear\r\nface cut deep into my heart.\r\n\r\nHer position beside the Jeddak of Jeddaks boded ill for her and me, and\r\non the instant that I saw her there, there sprang to my mind the firm\r\nintention never to leave that chamber alive if I must leave her in the\r\nclutches of this powerful tyrant.\r\n\r\nI had killed better men than Salensus Oll, and killed them with my bare\r\nhands, and now I swore to myself that I should kill him if I found that\r\nthe only way to save the Princess of Helium. That it would mean almost\r\ninstant death for me I cared not, except that it would remove me from\r\nfurther efforts in behalf of Dejah Thoris, and for this reason alone I\r\nwould have chosen another way, for even though I should kill Salensus\r\nOll that act would not restore my beloved wife to her own people. I\r\ndetermined to wait the final outcome of the trial, that I might learn\r\nall that I could of the Okarian ruler’s intentions, and then act\r\naccordingly.\r\n\r\nScarcely had I come before him than Salensus Oll summoned Thurid also.\r\n\r\n“Dator Thurid,” he said, “you have made a strange request of me; but,\r\nin accordance with your wishes and your promise that it will result\r\nonly to my interests, I have decided to accede.\r\n\r\n“You tell me that a certain announcement will be the means of\r\nconvicting this prisoner and, at the same time, open the way to the\r\ngratification of my dearest wish.”\r\n\r\nThurid nodded.\r\n\r\n“Then shall I make the announcement here before all my nobles,”\r\ncontinued Salensus Oll. “For a year no queen has sat upon the throne\r\nbeside me, and now it suits me to take to wife one who is reputed the\r\nmost beautiful woman upon Barsoom. A statement which none may\r\ntruthfully deny.\r\n\r\n“Nobles of Okar, unsheathe your swords and do homage to Dejah Thoris,\r\nPrincess of Helium and future Queen of Okar, for at the end of the\r\nallotted ten days she shall become the wife of Salensus Oll.”\r\n\r\nAs the nobles drew their blades and lifted them on high, in accordance\r\nwith the ancient custom of Okar when a jeddak announces his intention\r\nto wed, Dejah Thoris sprang to her feet and, raising her hand aloft,\r\ncried in a loud voice that they desist.\r\n\r\n“I may not be the wife of Salensus Oll,” she pleaded, “for already I be\r\na wife and mother. John Carter, Prince of Helium, still lives. I know\r\nit to be true, for I overheard Matai Shang tell his daughter Phaidor\r\nthat he had seen him in Kaor, at the court of Kulan Tith, Jeddak. A\r\njeddak does not wed a married woman, nor will Salensus Oll thus violate\r\nthe bonds of matrimony.”\r\n\r\nSalensus Oll turned upon Thurid with an ugly look.\r\n\r\n“Is this the surprise you held in store for me?” he cried. “You assured\r\nme that no obstacle which might not be easily overcome stood between me\r\nand this woman, and now I find that the one insuperable obstacle\r\nintervenes. What mean you, man? What have you to say?”\r\n\r\n“And should I deliver John Carter into your hands, Salensus Oll, would\r\nyou not feel that I had more than satisfied the promise that I made\r\nyou?” answered Thurid.\r\n\r\n“Talk not like a fool,” cried the enraged jeddak. “I am no child to be\r\nthus played with.”\r\n\r\n“I am talking only as a man who knows,” replied Thurid. “Knows that he\r\ncan do all that he claims.”\r\n\r\n“Then turn John Carter over to me within ten days or yourself suffer\r\nthe end that I should mete out to him were he in my power!” snapped the\r\nJeddak of Jeddaks, with an ugly scowl.\r\n\r\n“You need not wait ten days, Salensus Oll,” replied Thurid; and then,\r\nturning suddenly upon me as he extended a pointing finger, he cried:\r\n“There stands John Carter, Prince of Helium!”\r\n\r\n“Fool!” shrieked Salensus Oll. “Fool! John Carter is a white man. This\r\nfellow be as yellow as myself. John Carter’s face is smooth—Matai Shang\r\nhas described him to me. This prisoner has a beard and mustache as\r\nlarge and black as any in Okar. Quick, guardsmen, to the pits with the\r\nblack maniac who wishes to throw his life away for a poor joke upon\r\nyour ruler!”\r\n\r\n“Hold!” cried Thurid, and springing forward before I could guess his\r\nintention, he had grasped my beard and ripped the whole false fabric\r\nfrom my face and head, revealing my smooth, tanned skin beneath and my\r\nclose-cropped black hair.\r\n\r\nInstantly pandemonium reigned in the audience chamber of Salensus Oll.\r\nWarriors pressed forward with drawn blades, thinking that I might be\r\ncontemplating the assassination of the Jeddak of Jeddaks; while others,\r\nout of curiosity to see one whose name was familiar from pole to pole,\r\ncrowded behind their fellows.\r\n\r\nAs my identity was revealed I saw Dejah Thoris spring to her\r\nfeet—amazement writ large upon her face—and then through that jam of\r\narmed men she forced her way before any could prevent. A moment only\r\nand she was before me with outstretched arms and eyes filled with the\r\nlight of her great love.\r\n\r\n“John Carter! John Carter!” she cried as I folded her to my breast, and\r\nthen of a sudden I knew why she had denied me in the garden beneath the\r\ntower.\r\n\r\nWhat a fool I had been! Expecting that she would penetrate the\r\nmarvelous disguise that had been wrought for me by the barber of\r\nMarentina! She had not known me, that was all; and when she saw the\r\nsign of love from a stranger she was offended and righteously\r\nindignant. Indeed, but I had been a fool.\r\n\r\n“And it was you,” she cried, “who spoke to me from the tower! How could\r\nI dream that my beloved Virginian lay behind that fierce beard and that\r\nyellow skin?”\r\n\r\nShe had been wont to call me her Virginian as a term of endearment, for\r\nshe knew that I loved the sound of that beautiful name, made a thousand\r\ntimes more beautiful and hallowed by her dear lips, and as I heard it\r\nagain after all those long years my eyes became dimmed with tears and\r\nmy voice choked with emotion.\r\n\r\nBut an instant did I crush that dear form to me ere Salensus Oll,\r\ntrembling with rage and jealousy, shouldered his way to us.\r\n\r\n“Seize the man,” he cried to his warriors, and a hundred ruthless hands\r\ntore us apart.\r\n\r\nWell it was for the nobles of the court of Okar that John Carter had\r\nbeen disarmed. As it was, a dozen of them felt the weight of my\r\nclenched fists, and I had fought my way half up the steps before the\r\nthrone to which Salensus Oll had carried Dejah Thoris ere ever they\r\ncould stop me.\r\n\r\nThen I went down, fighting, beneath a half-hundred warriors; but before\r\nthey had battered me into unconsciousness I heard that from the lips of\r\nDejah Thoris that made all my suffering well worth while.\r\n\r\nStanding there beside the great tyrant, who clutched her by the arm,\r\nshe pointed to where I fought alone against such awful odds.\r\n\r\n“Think you, Salensus Oll, that the wife of such as he is,” she cried,\r\n“would ever dishonor his memory, were he a thousand times dead, by\r\nmating with a lesser mortal? Lives there upon any world such another as\r\nJohn Carter, Prince of Helium? Lives there another man who could fight\r\nhis way back and forth across a warlike planet, facing savage beasts\r\nand hordes of savage men, for the love of a woman?\r\n\r\n“I, Dejah Thoris, Princess of Helium, am his. He fought for me and won\r\nme. If you be a brave man you will honor the bravery that is his, and\r\nyou will not kill him. Make him a slave if you will, Salensus Oll; but\r\nspare his life. I would rather be a slave with such as he than be Queen\r\nof Okar.”\r\n\r\n“Neither slave nor queen dictates to Salensus Oll,” replied the Jeddak\r\nof Jeddaks. “John Carter shall die a natural death in the Pit of\r\nPlenty, and the day he dies Dejah Thoris shall become my queen.”\r\n\r\nI did not hear her reply, for it was then that a blow upon my head\r\nbrought unconsciousness, and when I recovered my senses only a handful\r\nof guardsmen remained in the audience chamber with me. As I opened my\r\neyes they goaded me with the points of their swords and bade me rise.\r\n\r\nThen they led me through long corridors to a court far toward the\r\ncenter of the palace.\r\n\r\nIn the center of the court was a deep pit, near the edge of which stood\r\nhalf a dozen other guardsmen, awaiting me. One of them carried a long\r\nrope in his hands, which he commenced to make ready as we approached.\r\n\r\nWe had come to within fifty feet of these men when I felt a sudden\r\nstrange and rapid pricking sensation in one of my fingers.\r\n\r\nFor a moment I was nonplused by the odd feeling, and then there came to\r\nme recollection of that which in the stress of my adventure I had\r\nentirely forgotten—the gift ring of Prince Talu of Marentina.\r\n\r\nInstantly I looked toward the group we were nearing, at the same time\r\nraising my left hand to my forehead, that the ring might be visible to\r\none who sought it. Simultaneously one of the waiting warriors raised\r\nhis left hand, ostensibly to brush back his hair, and upon one of his\r\nfingers I saw the duplicate of my own ring.\r\n\r\nA quick look of intelligence passed between us, after which I kept my\r\neyes turned away from the warrior and did not look at him again, for\r\nfear that I might arouse the suspicion of the Okarians. When we reached\r\nthe edge of the pit I saw that it was very deep, and presently I\r\nrealized I was soon to judge just how far it extended below the surface\r\nof the court, for he who held the rope passed it about my body in such\r\na way that it could be released from above at any time; and then, as\r\nall the warriors grasped it, he pushed me forward, and I fell into the\r\nyawning abyss.\r\n\r\nAfter the first jerk as I reached the end of the rope that had been\r\npaid out to let me fall below the pit’s edge they lowered me quickly\r\nbut smoothly. The moment before the plunge, while two or three of the\r\nmen had been assisting in adjusting the rope about me, one of them had\r\nbrought his mouth close to my cheek, and in the brief interval before I\r\nwas cast into the forbidding hole he breathed a single word into my\r\near:\r\n\r\n“Courage!”\r\n\r\nThe pit, which my imagination had pictured as bottomless, proved to be\r\nnot more than a hundred feet in depth; but as its walls were smoothly\r\npolished it might as well have been a thousand feet, for I could never\r\nhope to escape without outside assistance.\r\n\r\nFor a day I was left in darkness; and then, quite suddenly, a brilliant\r\nlight illumined my strange cell. I was reasonably hungry and thirsty by\r\nthis time, not having tasted food or drink since the day prior to my\r\nincarceration.\r\n\r\nTo my amazement I found the sides of the pit, that I had thought\r\nsmooth, lined with shelves, upon which were the most delicious viands\r\nand liquid refreshments that Okar afforded.\r\n\r\nWith an exclamation of delight I sprang forward to partake of some of\r\nthe welcome food, but ere ever I reached it the light was extinguished,\r\nand, though I groped my way about the chamber, my hands came in contact\r\nwith nothing beside the smooth, hard wall that I had felt on my first\r\nexamination of my prison.\r\n\r\nImmediately the pangs of hunger and thirst began to assail me. Where\r\nbefore I had had but a mild craving for food and drink, I now actually\r\nsuffered for want of it, and all because of the tantalizing sight that\r\nI had had of food almost within my grasp.\r\n\r\nOnce more darkness and silence enveloped me, a silence that was broken\r\nonly by a single mocking laugh.\r\n\r\nFor another day nothing occurred to break the monotony of my\r\nimprisonment or relieve the suffering superinduced by hunger and\r\nthirst. Slowly the pangs became less keen, as suffering deadened the\r\nactivity of certain nerves; and then the light flashed on once again,\r\nand before me stood an array of new and tempting dishes, with great\r\nbottles of clear water and flagons of refreshing wine, upon the outside\r\nof which the cold sweat of condensation stood.\r\n\r\nAgain, with the hunger madness of a wild beast, I sprang forward to\r\nseize those tempting dishes; but, as before, the light went out and I\r\ncame to a sudden stop against a hard wall.\r\n\r\nThen the mocking laugh rang out for a second time.\r\n\r\nThe Pit of Plenty!\r\n\r\nAh, what a cruel mind must have devised this exquisite, hellish\r\ntorture! Day after day was the thing repeated, until I was on the verge\r\nof madness; and then, as I had done in the pits of the Warhoons, I took\r\na new, firm hold upon my reason and forced it back into the channels of\r\nsanity.\r\n\r\nBy sheer will-power I regained control over my tottering mentality, and\r\nso successful was I that the next time that the light came I sat quite\r\nstill and looked indifferently at the fresh and tempting food almost\r\nwithin my reach. Glad I was that I had done so, for it gave me an\r\nopportunity to solve the seeming mystery of those vanishing banquets.\r\n\r\nAs I made no move to reach the food, the torturers left the light\r\nturned on in the hope that at last I could refrain no longer from\r\ngiving them the delicious thrill of enjoyment that my former futile\r\nefforts to obtain it had caused.\r\n\r\nAnd as I sat scrutinizing the laden shelves I presently saw how the\r\nthing was accomplished, and so simple was it that I wondered I had not\r\nguessed it before. The wall of my prison was of clearest glass—behind\r\nthe glass were the tantalizing viands.\r\n\r\nAfter nearly an hour the light went out, but this time there was no\r\nmocking laughter—at least not upon the part of my tormentors; but I, to\r\nbe at quits with them, gave a low laugh that none might mistake for the\r\ncackle of a maniac.\r\n\r\nNine days passed, and I was weak from hunger and thirst, but no longer\r\nsuffering—I was past that. Then, down through the darkness above, a\r\nlittle parcel fell to the floor at my side.\r\n\r\nIndifferently I groped for it, thinking it but some new invention of my\r\njailers to add to my sufferings.\r\n\r\nAt last I found it—a tiny package wrapped in paper, at the end of a\r\nstrong and slender cord. As I opened it a few lozenges fell to the\r\nfloor. As I gathered them up, feeling of them and smelling of them, I\r\ndiscovered that they were tablets of concentrated food such as are\r\nquite common in all parts of Barsoom.\r\n\r\nPoison! I thought.\r\n\r\nWell, what of it? Why not end my misery now rather than drag out a few\r\nmore wretched days in this dark pit? Slowly I raised one of the little\r\npellets to my lips.\r\n\r\n“Good-bye, my Dejah Thoris!” I breathed. “I have lived for you and\r\nfought for you, and now my next dearest wish is to be realized, for I\r\nshall die for you,” and, taking the morsel in my mouth, I devoured it.\r\n\r\nOne by one I ate them all, nor ever did anything taste better than\r\nthose tiny bits of nourishment, within which I knew must lie the seeds\r\nof death—possibly of some hideous, torturing death.\r\n\r\nAs I sat quietly upon the floor of my prison, waiting for the end, my\r\nfingers by accident came in contact with the bit of paper in which the\r\nthings had been wrapped; and as I idly played with it, my mind roaming\r\nfar back into the past, that I might live again for a few brief moments\r\nbefore I died some of the many happy moments of a long and happy life,\r\nI became aware of strange protuberances upon the smooth surface of the\r\nparchment-like substance in my hands.\r\n\r\nFor a time they carried no special significance to my mind—I merely was\r\nmildly wondrous that they were there; but at last they seemed to take\r\nform, and then I realized that there was but a single line of them,\r\nlike writing.\r\n\r\nNow, more interestedly, my fingers traced and retraced them. There were\r\nfour separate and distinct combinations of raised lines. Could it be\r\nthat these were four words, and that they were intended to carry a\r\nmessage to me?\r\n\r\nThe more I thought of it the more excited I became, until my fingers\r\nraced madly back and forth over those bewildering little hills and\r\nvalleys upon that bit of paper.\r\n\r\nBut I could make nothing of them, and at last I decided that my very\r\nhaste was preventing me from solving the mystery. Then I took it more\r\nslowly. Again and again my forefinger traced the first of those four\r\ncombinations.\r\n\r\nMartian writing is rather difficult to explain to an Earth man—it is\r\nsomething of a cross between shorthand and picture-writing, and is an\r\nentirely different language from the spoken language of Mars.\r\n\r\nUpon Barsoom there is but a single oral language.\r\n\r\nIt is spoken today by every race and nation, just as it was at the\r\nbeginning of human life upon Barsoom. It has grown with the growth of\r\nthe planet’s learning and scientific achievements, but so ingenious a\r\nthing it is that new words to express new thoughts or describe new\r\nconditions or discoveries form themselves—no other word could explain\r\nthe thing that a new word is required for other than the word that\r\nnaturally falls to it, and so, no matter how far removed two nations or\r\nraces, their spoken languages are identical.\r\n\r\nNot so their written languages, however. No two nations have the same\r\nwritten language, and often cities of the same nation have a written\r\nlanguage that differs greatly from that of the nation to which they\r\nbelong.\r\n\r\nThus it was that the signs upon the paper, if in reality they were\r\nwords, baffled me for some time; but at last I made out the first one.\r\n\r\nIt was “courage,” and it was written in the letters of Marentina.\r\n\r\nCourage!\r\n\r\nThat was the word the yellow guardsman had whispered in my ear as I\r\nstood upon the verge of the Pit of Plenty.\r\n\r\nThe message must be from him, and he I knew was a friend.\r\n\r\nWith renewed hope I bent my every energy to the deciphering of the\r\nbalance of the message, and at last success rewarded my endeavor—I had\r\nread the four words:\r\n\r\n“Courage! Follow the rope.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“FOLLOW THE ROPE”\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat could it mean?\r\n\r\n“Follow the rope.” What rope?\r\n\r\nPresently I recalled the cord that had been attached to the parcel when\r\nit fell at my side, and after a little groping my hand came in contact\r\nwith it again. It depended from above, and when I pulled upon it I\r\ndiscovered that it was rigidly fastened, possibly at the pit’s mouth.\r\n\r\nUpon examination I found that the cord, though small, was amply able to\r\nsustain the weight of several men. Then I made another discovery—there\r\nwas a second message knotted in the rope at about the height of my\r\nhead. This I deciphered more easily, now that the key was mine.\r\n\r\n“Bring the rope with you. Beyond the knots lies danger.”\r\n\r\nThat was all there was to this message. It was evidently hastily\r\nformed—an afterthought.\r\n\r\nI did not pause longer than to learn the contents of the second\r\nmessage, and, though I was none too sure of the meaning of the final\r\nadmonition, “Beyond the knots lies danger,” yet I was sure that here\r\nbefore me lay an avenue of escape, and that the sooner I took advantage\r\nof it the more likely was I to win to liberty.\r\n\r\nAt least, I could be but little worse off than I had been in the Pit of\r\nPlenty.\r\n\r\nI was to find, however, ere I was well out of that damnable hole that I\r\nmight have been very much worse off had I been compelled to remain\r\nthere another two minutes.\r\n\r\nIt had taken me about that length of time to ascend some fifty feet\r\nabove the bottom when a noise above attracted my attention. To my\r\nchagrin I saw that the covering of the pit was being removed far above\r\nme, and in the light of the courtyard beyond I saw a number of yellow\r\nwarriors.\r\n\r\nCould it be that I was laboriously working my way into some new trap?\r\nWere the messages spurious, after all? And then, just as my hope and\r\ncourage had ebbed to their lowest, I saw two things.\r\n\r\nOne was the body of a huge, struggling, snarling apt being lowered over\r\nthe side of the pit toward me, and the other was an aperture in the\r\nside of the shaft—an aperture larger than a man’s body, into which my\r\nrope led.\r\n\r\nJust as I scrambled into the dark hole before me the apt passed me,\r\nreaching out with his mighty hands to clutch me, and snapping,\r\ngrowling, and roaring in a most frightful manner.\r\n\r\nPlainly now I saw the end for which Salensus Oll had destined me. After\r\nfirst torturing me with starvation he had caused this fierce beast to\r\nbe lowered into my prison to finish the work that the jeddak’s hellish\r\nimagination had conceived.\r\n\r\nAnd then another truth flashed upon me—I had lived nine days of the\r\nallotted ten which must intervene before Salensus Oll could make Dejah\r\nThoris his queen. The purpose of the apt was to insure my death before\r\nthe tenth day.\r\n\r\nI almost laughed aloud as I thought how Salensus Oll’s measure of\r\nsafety was to aid in defeating the very end he sought, for when they\r\ndiscovered that the apt was alone in the Pit of Plenty they could not\r\nknow but that he had completely devoured me, and so no suspicion of my\r\nescape would cause a search to be made for me.\r\n\r\nCoiling the rope that had carried me thus far upon my strange journey,\r\nI sought for the other end, but found that as I followed it forward it\r\nextended always before me. So this was the meaning of the words:\r\n“Follow the rope.”\r\n\r\nThe tunnel through which I crawled was low and dark. I had followed it\r\nfor several hundred yards when I felt a knot beneath my fingers.\r\n“Beyond the knots lies danger.”\r\n\r\nNow I went with the utmost caution, and a moment later a sharp turn in\r\nthe tunnel brought me to an opening into a large, brilliantly lighted\r\nchamber.\r\n\r\nThe trend of the tunnel I had been traversing had been slightly upward,\r\nand from this I judged that the chamber into which I now found myself\r\nlooking must be either on the first floor of the palace or directly\r\nbeneath the first floor.\r\n\r\nUpon the opposite wall were many strange instruments and devices, and\r\nin the center of the room stood a long table, at which two men were\r\nseated in earnest conversation.\r\n\r\nHe who faced me was a yellow man—a little, wizened-up, pasty-faced old\r\nfellow with great eyes that showed the white round the entire\r\ncircumference of the iris.\r\n\r\nHis companion was a black man, and I did not need to see his face to\r\nknow that it was Thurid, for there was no other of the First Born north\r\nof the ice-barrier.\r\n\r\nThurid was speaking as I came within hearing of the men’s voices.\r\n\r\n“Solan,” he was saying, “there is no risk and the reward is great. You\r\nknow that you hate Salensus Oll and that nothing would please you more\r\nthan to thwart him in some cherished plan. There be nothing that he\r\nmore cherishes today than the idea of wedding the beautiful Princess of\r\nHelium; but I, too, want her, and with your help I may win her.\r\n\r\n“You need not more than step from this room for an instant when I give\r\nyou the signal. I will do the rest, and then, when I am gone, you may\r\ncome and throw the great switch back into its place, and all will be as\r\nbefore. I need but an hour’s start to be safe beyond the devilish power\r\nthat you control in this hidden chamber beneath the palace of your\r\nmaster. See how easy,” and with the words the black dator rose from his\r\nseat and, crossing the room, laid his hand upon a large, burnished\r\nlever that protruded from the opposite wall.\r\n\r\n“No! No!” cried the little old man, springing after him, with a wild\r\nshriek. “Not that one! Not that one! That controls the sunray tanks,\r\nand should you pull it too far down, all Kadabra would be consumed by\r\nheat before I could replace it. Come away! Come away! You know not with\r\nwhat mighty powers you play. This is the lever that you seek. Note well\r\nthe symbol inlaid in white upon its ebon surface.”\r\n\r\nThurid approached and examined the handle of the lever.\r\n\r\n“Ah, a magnet,” he said. “I will remember. It is settled then I take\r\nit,” he continued.\r\n\r\nThe old man hesitated. A look of combined greed and apprehension\r\noverspread his none too beautiful features.\r\n\r\n“Double the figure,” he said. “Even that were all too small an amount\r\nfor the service you ask. Why, I risk my life by even entertaining you\r\nhere within the forbidden precincts of my station. Should Salensus Oll\r\nlearn of it he would have me thrown to the apts before the day was\r\ndone.”\r\n\r\n“He dare not do that, and you know it full well, Solan,” contradicted\r\nthe black. “Too great a power of life and death you hold over the\r\npeople of Kadabra for Salensus Oll ever to risk threatening you with\r\ndeath. Before ever his minions could lay their hands upon you, you\r\nmight seize this very lever from which you have just warned me and wipe\r\nout the entire city.”\r\n\r\n“And myself into the bargain,” said Solan, with a shudder.\r\n\r\n“But if you were to die, anyway, you would find the nerve to do it,”\r\nreplied Thurid.\r\n\r\n“Yes,” muttered Solan, “I have often thought upon that very thing.\r\nWell, First Born, is your red princess worth the price I ask for my\r\nservices, or will you go without her and see her in the arms of\r\nSalensus Oll tomorrow night?”\r\n\r\n“Take your price, yellow man,” replied Thurid, with an oath. “Half now\r\nand the balance when you have fulfilled your contract.”\r\n\r\nWith that the dator threw a well-filled money-pouch upon the table.\r\n\r\nSolan opened the pouch and with trembling fingers counted its contents.\r\nHis weird eyes assumed a greedy expression, and his unkempt beard and\r\nmustache twitched with the muscles of his mouth and chin. It was quite\r\nevident from his very mannerism that Thurid had keenly guessed the\r\nman’s weakness—even the clawlike, clutching movement of the fingers\r\nbetokened the avariciousness of the miser.\r\n\r\nHaving satisfied himself that the amount was correct, Solan replaced\r\nthe money in the pouch and rose from the table.\r\n\r\n“Now,” he said, “are you quite sure that you know the way to your\r\ndestination? You must travel quickly to cover the ground to the cave\r\nand from thence beyond the Great Power, all within a brief hour, for no\r\nmore dare I spare you.”\r\n\r\n“Let me repeat it to you,” said Thurid, “that you may see if I be\r\nletter-perfect.”\r\n\r\n“Proceed,” replied Solan.\r\n\r\n“Through yonder door,” he commenced, pointing to a door at the far end\r\nof the apartment, “I follow a corridor, passing three diverging\r\ncorridors upon my right; then into the fourth right-hand corridor\r\nstraight to where three corridors meet; here again I follow to the\r\nright, hugging the left wall closely to avoid the pit.\r\n\r\n“At the end of this corridor I shall come to a spiral runway, which I\r\nmust follow down instead of up; after that the way is along but a\r\nsingle branchless corridor. Am I right?”\r\n\r\n“Quite right, Dator,” answered Solan; “and now begone. Already have you\r\ntempted fate too long within this forbidden place.”\r\n\r\n“Tonight, or tomorrow, then, you may expect the signal,” said Thurid,\r\nrising to go.\r\n\r\n“Tonight, or tomorrow,” repeated Solan, and as the door closed behind\r\nhis guest the old man continued to mutter as he turned back to the\r\ntable, where he again dumped the contents of the money-pouch, running\r\nhis fingers through the heap of shining metal; piling the coins into\r\nlittle towers; counting, recounting, and fondling the wealth the while\r\nhe muttered on and on in a crooning undertone.\r\n\r\nPresently his fingers ceased their play; his eyes popped wider than\r\never as they fastened upon the door through which Thurid had\r\ndisappeared. The croon changed to a querulous muttering, and finally to\r\nan ugly growl.\r\n\r\nThen the old man rose from the table, shaking his fist at the closed\r\ndoor. Now he raised his voice, and his words came distinctly.\r\n\r\n“Fool!” he muttered. “Think you that for your happiness Solan will give\r\nup his life? If you escaped, Salensus Oll would know that only through\r\nmy connivance could you have succeeded. Then would he send for me. What\r\nwould you have me do? Reduce the city and myself to ashes? No, fool,\r\nthere is a better way—a better way for Solan to keep thy money and be\r\nrevenged upon Salensus Oll.”\r\n\r\nHe laughed in a nasty, cackling note.\r\n\r\n“Poor fool! You may throw the great switch that will give you the\r\nfreedom of the air of Okar, and then, in fatuous security, go on with\r\nthy red princess to the freedom of—death. When you have passed beyond\r\nthis chamber in your flight, what can prevent Solan replacing the\r\nswitch as it was before your vile hand touched it? Nothing; and then\r\nthe Guardian of the North will claim you and your woman, and Salensus\r\nOll, when he sees your dead bodies, will never dream that the hand of\r\nSolan had aught to do with the thing.”\r\n\r\nThen his voice dropped once more into mutterings that I could not\r\ntranslate, but I had heard enough to cause me to guess a great deal\r\nmore, and I thanked the kind Providence that had led me to this chamber\r\nat a time so filled with importance to Dejah Thoris and myself as this.\r\n\r\nBut how to pass the old man now! The cord, almost invisible upon the\r\nfloor, stretched straight across the apartment to a door upon the far\r\nside.\r\n\r\nThere was no other way of which I knew, nor could I afford to ignore\r\nthe advice to “follow the rope.” I must cross this room, but however I\r\nshould accomplish it undetected with that old man in the very center of\r\nit baffled me.\r\n\r\nOf course I might have sprung in upon him and with my bare hands\r\nsilenced him forever, but I had heard enough to convince me that with\r\nhim alive the knowledge that I had gained might serve me at some future\r\nmoment, while should I kill him and another be stationed in his place\r\nThurid would not come hither with Dejah Thoris, as was quite evidently\r\nhis intention.\r\n\r\nAs I stood in the dark shadow of the tunnel’s end racking my brain for\r\na feasible plan the while I watched, catlike, the old man’s every move,\r\nhe took up the money-pouch and crossed to one end of the apartment,\r\nwhere, bending to his knees, he fumbled with a panel in the wall.\r\n\r\nInstantly I guessed that here was the hiding place in which he hoarded\r\nhis wealth, and while he bent there, his back toward me, I entered the\r\nchamber upon tiptoe, and with the utmost stealth essayed to reach the\r\nopposite side before he should complete his task and turn again toward\r\nthe room’s center.\r\n\r\nScarcely thirty steps, all told, must I take, and yet it seemed to my\r\noverwrought imagination that that farther wall was miles away; but at\r\nlast I reached it, nor once had I taken my eyes from the back of the\r\nold miser’s head.\r\n\r\nHe did not turn until my hand was upon the button that controlled the\r\ndoor through which my way led, and then he turned away from me as I\r\npassed through and gently closed the door.\r\n\r\nFor an instant I paused, my ear close to the panel, to learn if he had\r\nsuspected aught, but as no sound of pursuit came from within I wheeled\r\nand made my way along the new corridor, following the rope, which I\r\ncoiled and brought with me as I advanced.\r\n\r\nBut a short distance farther on I came to the rope’s end at a point\r\nwhere five corridors met. What was I to do? Which way should I turn? I\r\nwas nonplused.\r\n\r\nA careful examination of the end of the rope revealed the fact that it\r\nhad been cleanly cut with some sharp instrument. This fact and the\r\nwords that had cautioned me that danger lay beyond the KNOTS convinced\r\nme that the rope had been severed since my friend had placed it as my\r\nguide, for I had but passed a single knot, whereas there had evidently\r\nbeen two or more in the entire length of the cord.\r\n\r\nNow, indeed, was I in a pretty fix, for neither did I know which avenue\r\nto follow nor when danger lay directly in my path; but there was\r\nnothing else to be done than follow one of the corridors, for I could\r\ngain nothing by remaining where I was.\r\n\r\nSo I chose the central opening, and passed on into its gloomy depths\r\nwith a prayer upon my lips.\r\n\r\nThe floor of the tunnel rose rapidly as I advanced, and a moment later\r\nthe way came to an abrupt end before a heavy door.\r\n\r\nI could hear nothing beyond, and, with my accustomed rashness, pushed\r\nthe portal wide to step into a room filled with yellow warriors.\r\n\r\nThe first to see me opened his eyes wide in astonishment, and at the\r\nsame instant I felt the tingling sensation in my finger that denoted\r\nthe presence of a friend of the ring.\r\n\r\nThen others saw me, and there was a concerted rush to lay hands upon\r\nme, for these were all members of the palace guard—men familiar with my\r\nface.\r\n\r\nThe first to reach me was the wearer of the mate to my strange ring,\r\nand as he came close he whispered: “Surrender to me!” then in a loud\r\nvoice shouted: “You are my prisoner, white man,” and menaced me with\r\nhis two weapons.\r\n\r\nAnd so John Carter, Prince of Helium, meekly surrendered to a single\r\nantagonist. The others now swarmed about us, asking many questions, but\r\nI would not talk to them, and finally my captor announced that he would\r\nlead me back to my cell.\r\n\r\nAn officer ordered several other warriors to accompany him, and a\r\nmoment later we were retracing the way I had just come. My friend\r\nwalked close beside me, asking many silly questions about the country\r\nfrom which I had come, until finally his fellows paid no further\r\nattention to him or his gabbling.\r\n\r\nGradually, as he spoke, he lowered his voice, so that presently he was\r\nable to converse with me in a low tone without attracting attention.\r\nHis ruse was a clever one, and showed that Talu had not misjudged the\r\nman’s fitness for the dangerous duty upon which he was detailed.\r\n\r\nWhen he had fully assured himself that the other guardsmen were not\r\nlistening, he asked me why I had not followed the rope, and when I told\r\nhim that it had ended at the five corridors he said that it must have\r\nbeen cut by someone in need of a piece of rope, for he was sure that\r\n“the stupid Kadabrans would never have guessed its purpose.”\r\n\r\nBefore we had reached the spot from which the five corridors diverge my\r\nMarentinian friend had managed to drop to the rear of the little column\r\nwith me, and when we came in sight of the branching ways he whispered:\r\n\r\n“Run up the first upon the right. It leads to the watchtower upon the\r\nsouth wall. I will direct the pursuit up the next corridor,” and with\r\nthat he gave me a great shove into the dark mouth of the tunnel, at the\r\nsame time crying out in simulated pain and alarm as he threw himself\r\nupon the floor as though I had felled him with a blow.\r\n\r\nFrom behind the voices of the excited guardsmen came reverberating\r\nalong the corridor, suddenly growing fainter as Talu’s spy led them up\r\nthe wrong passageway in fancied pursuit.\r\n\r\nAs I ran for my life through the dark galleries beneath the palace of\r\nSalensus Oll I must indeed have presented a remarkable appearance had\r\nthere been any to note it, for though death loomed large about me, my\r\nface was split by a broad grin as I thought of the resourcefulness of\r\nthe nameless hero of Marentina to whom I owed my life.\r\n\r\nOf such stuff are the men of my beloved Helium, and when I meet another\r\nof their kind, of whatever race or color, my heart goes out to him as\r\nit did now to my new friend who had risked his life for me simply\r\nbecause I wore the mate to the ring his ruler had put upon his finger.\r\n\r\nThe corridor along which I ran led almost straight for a considerable\r\ndistance, terminating at the foot of a spiral runway, up which I\r\nproceeded to emerge presently into a circular chamber upon the first\r\nfloor of a tower.\r\n\r\nIn this apartment a dozen red slaves were employed polishing or\r\nrepairing the weapons of the yellow men. The walls of the room were\r\nlined with racks in which were hundreds of straight and hooked swords,\r\njavelins, and daggers. It was evidently an armory. There were but three\r\nwarriors guarding the workers.\r\n\r\nMy eyes took in the entire scene at a glance. Here were weapons in\r\nplenty! Here were sinewy red warriors to wield them!\r\n\r\nAnd here now was John Carter, Prince of Helium, in need both of weapons\r\nand warriors!\r\n\r\nAs I stepped into the apartment, guards and prisoners saw me\r\nsimultaneously.\r\n\r\nClose to the entrance where I stood was a rack of straight swords, and\r\nas my hand closed upon the hilt of one of them my eyes fell upon the\r\nfaces of two of the prisoners who worked side by side.\r\n\r\nOne of the guards started toward me. “Who are you?” he demanded. “What\r\ndo you here?”\r\n\r\n“I come for Tardos Mors, Jeddak of Helium, and his son, Mors Kajak,” I\r\ncried, pointing to the two red prisoners, who had now sprung to their\r\nfeet, wide-eyed in astonished recognition.\r\n\r\n“Rise, red men! Before we die let us leave a memorial in the palace of\r\nOkar’s tyrant that will stand forever in the annals of Kadabra to the\r\nhonor and glory of Helium,” for I had seen that all the prisoners there\r\nwere men of Tardos Mors’s navy.\r\n\r\nThen the first guardsman was upon me and the fight was on, but scarce\r\ndid we engage ere, to my horror, I saw that the red slaves were\r\nshackled to the floor.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MAGNET SWITCH\r\n\r\n\r\nThe guardsmen paid not the slightest attention to their wards, for the\r\nred men could not move over two feet from the great rings to which they\r\nwere padlocked, though each had seized a weapon upon which he had been\r\nengaged when I entered the room, and stood ready to join me could they\r\nhave but done so.\r\n\r\nThe yellow men devoted all their attention to me, nor were they long in\r\ndiscovering that the three of them were none too many to defend the\r\narmory against John Carter. Would that I had had my own good long-sword\r\nin my hand that day; but, as it was, I rendered a satisfactory account\r\nof myself with the unfamiliar weapon of the yellow man.\r\n\r\nAt first I had a time of it dodging their villainous hook-swords, but\r\nafter a minute or two I had succeeded in wresting a second straight\r\nsword from one of the racks along the wall, and thereafter, using it to\r\nparry the hooks of my antagonists, I felt more evenly equipped.\r\n\r\nThe three of them were on me at once, and but for a lucky circumstance\r\nmy end might have come quickly. The foremost guardsman made a vicious\r\nlunge for my side with his hook after the three of them had backed me\r\nagainst the wall, but as I sidestepped and raised my arm his weapon but\r\ngrazed my side, passing into a rack of javelins, where it became\r\nentangled.\r\n\r\nBefore he could release it I had run him through, and then, falling\r\nback upon the tactics that have saved me a hundred times in tight\r\npinches, I rushed the two remaining warriors, forcing them back with a\r\nperfect torrent of cuts and thrusts, weaving my sword in and out about\r\ntheir guards until I had the fear of death upon them.\r\n\r\nThen one of them commenced calling for help, but it was too late to\r\nsave them.\r\n\r\nThey were as putty in my hands now, and I backed them about the armory\r\nas I would until I had them where I wanted them—within reach of the\r\nswords of the shackled slaves. In an instant both lay dead upon the\r\nfloor. But their cries had not been entirely fruitless, for now I heard\r\nanswering shouts and the footfalls of many men running and the clank of\r\naccouterments and the commands of officers.\r\n\r\n“The door! Quick, John Carter, bar the door!” cried Tardos Mors.\r\n\r\nAlready the guard was in sight, charging across the open court that was\r\nvisible through the doorway.\r\n\r\nA dozen seconds would bring them into the tower. A single leap carried\r\nme to the heavy portal. With a resounding bang I slammed it shut.\r\n\r\n“The bar!” shouted Tardos Mors.\r\n\r\nI tried to slip the huge fastening into place, but it defied my every\r\nattempt.\r\n\r\n“Raise it a little to release the catch,” cried one of the red men.\r\n\r\nI could hear the yellow warriors leaping along the flagging just beyond\r\nthe door. I raised the bar and shot it to the right just as the\r\nforemost of the guardsmen threw himself against the opposite side of\r\nthe massive panels.\r\n\r\nThe barrier held—I had been in time, but by the fraction of a second\r\nonly.\r\n\r\nNow I turned my attention to the prisoners. To Tardos Mors I went\r\nfirst, asking where the keys might be which would unfasten their\r\nfetters.\r\n\r\n“The officer of the guard has them,” replied the Jeddak of Helium, “and\r\nhe is among those without who seek entrance. You will have to force\r\nthem.”\r\n\r\nMost of the prisoners were already hacking at their bonds with the\r\nswords in their hands. The yellow men were battering at the door with\r\njavelins and axes.\r\n\r\nI turned my attention to the chains that held Tardos Mors. Again and\r\nagain I cut deep into the metal with my sharp blade, but ever faster\r\nand faster fell the torrent of blows upon the portal.\r\n\r\nAt last a link parted beneath my efforts, and a moment later Tardos\r\nMors was free, though a few inches of trailing chain still dangled from\r\nhis ankle.\r\n\r\nA splinter of wood falling inward from the door announced the headway\r\nthat our enemies were making toward us.\r\n\r\nThe mighty panels trembled and bent beneath the furious onslaught of\r\nthe enraged yellow men.\r\n\r\nWhat with the battering upon the door and the hacking of the red men at\r\ntheir chains the din within the armory was appalling. No sooner was\r\nTardos Mors free than he turned his attention to another of the\r\nprisoners, while I set to work to liberate Mors Kajak.\r\n\r\nWe must work fast if we would have all those fetters cut before the\r\ndoor gave way. Now a panel crashed inward upon the floor, and Mors\r\nKajak sprang to the opening to defend the way until we should have time\r\nto release the others.\r\n\r\nWith javelins snatched from the wall he wrought havoc among the\r\nforemost of the Okarians while we battled with the insensate metal that\r\nstood between our fellows and freedom.\r\n\r\nAt length all but one of the prisoners were freed, and then the door\r\nfell with a mighty crash before a hastily improvised battering-ram, and\r\nthe yellow horde was upon us.\r\n\r\n“To the upper chambers!” shouted the red man who was still fettered to\r\nthe floor. “To the upper chambers! There you may defend the tower\r\nagainst all Kadabra. Do not delay because of me, who could pray for no\r\nbetter death than in the service of Tardos Mors and the Prince of\r\nHelium.”\r\n\r\nBut I would have sacrificed the life of every man of us rather than\r\ndesert a single red man, much less the lion-hearted hero who begged us\r\nto leave him.\r\n\r\n“Cut his chains,” I cried to two of the red men, “while the balance of\r\nus hold off the foe.”\r\n\r\nThere were ten of us now to do battle with the Okarian guard, and I\r\nwarrant that that ancient watchtower never looked down upon a more\r\nhotly contested battle than took place that day within its own grim\r\nwalls.\r\n\r\nThe first inrushing wave of yellow warriors recoiled from the slashing\r\nblades of ten of Helium’s veteran fighting men. A dozen Okarian corpses\r\nblocked the doorway, but over the gruesome barrier a score more of\r\ntheir fellows dashed, shouting their hoarse and hideous war-cry.\r\n\r\nUpon the bloody mound we met them, hand to hand, stabbing where the\r\nquarters were too close to cut, thrusting when we could push a foeman\r\nto arm’s length; and mingled with the wild cry of the Okarian there\r\nrose and fell the glorious words: “For Helium! For Helium!” that for\r\ncountless ages have spurred on the bravest of the brave to those deeds\r\nof valor that have sent the fame of Helium’s heroes broadcast\r\nthroughout the length and breadth of a world.\r\n\r\nNow were the fetters struck from the last of the red men, and thirteen\r\nstrong we met each new charge of the soldiers of Salensus Oll. Scarce\r\none of us but bled from a score of wounds, yet none had fallen.\r\n\r\nFrom without we saw hundreds of guardsmen pouring into the courtyard,\r\nand along the lower corridor from which I had found my way to the\r\narmory we could hear the clank of metal and the shouting of men.\r\n\r\nIn a moment we should be attacked from two sides, and with all our\r\nprowess we could not hope to withstand the unequal odds which would\r\nthus divide our attention and our small numbers.\r\n\r\n“To the upper chambers!” cried Tardos Mors, and a moment later we fell\r\nback toward the runway that led to the floors above.\r\n\r\nHere another bloody battle was waged with the force of yellow men who\r\ncharged into the armory as we fell back from the doorway. Here we lost\r\nour first man, a noble fellow whom we could ill spare; but at length\r\nall had backed into the runway except myself, who remained to hold back\r\nthe Okarians until the others were safe above.\r\n\r\nIn the mouth of the narrow spiral but a single warrior could attack me\r\nat a time, so that I had little difficulty in holding them all back for\r\nthe brief moment that was necessary. Then, backing slowly before them,\r\nI commenced the ascent of the spiral.\r\n\r\nAll the long way to the tower’s top the guardsmen pressed me closely.\r\nWhen one went down before my sword another scrambled over the dead man\r\nto take his place; and thus, taking an awful toll with each few feet\r\ngained, I came to the spacious glass-walled watchtower of Kadabra.\r\n\r\nHere my companions clustered ready to take my place, and for a moment’s\r\nrespite I stepped to one side while they held the enemy off.\r\n\r\nFrom the lofty perch a view could be had for miles in every direction.\r\nToward the south stretched the rugged, ice-clad waste to the edge of\r\nthe mighty barrier. Toward the east and west, and dimly toward the\r\nnorth I descried other Okarian cities, while in the immediate\r\nforeground, just beyond the walls of Kadabra, the grim guardian shaft\r\nreared its somber head.\r\n\r\nThen I cast my eyes down into the streets of Kadabra, from which a\r\nsudden tumult had arisen, and there I saw a battle raging, and beyond\r\nthe city’s walls I saw armed men marching in great columns toward a\r\nnear-by gate.\r\n\r\nEagerly I pressed forward against the glass wall of the observatory,\r\nscarce daring to credit the testimony of my own eyes. But at last I\r\ncould doubt no longer, and with a shout of joy that rose strangely in\r\nthe midst of the cursing and groaning of the battling men at the\r\nentrance to the chamber, I called to Tardos Mors.\r\n\r\nAs he joined me I pointed down into the streets of Kadabra and to the\r\nadvancing columns beyond, above which floated bravely in the arctic air\r\nthe flags and banners of Helium.\r\n\r\nAn instant later every red man in the lofty chamber had seen the\r\ninspiring sight, and such a shout of thanksgiving arose as I warrant\r\nnever before echoed through that age-old pile of stone.\r\n\r\nBut still we must fight on, for though our troops had entered Kadabra,\r\nthe city was yet far from capitulation, nor had the palace been even\r\nassaulted. Turn and turn about we held the top of the runway while the\r\nothers feasted their eyes upon the sight of our valiant countrymen\r\nbattling far beneath us.\r\n\r\nNow they have rushed the palace gate! Great battering-rams are dashed\r\nagainst its formidable surface. Now they are repulsed by a deadly\r\nshower of javelins from the wall’s top!\r\n\r\nOnce again they charge, but a sortie by a large force of Okarians from\r\nan intersecting avenue crumples the head of the column, and the men of\r\nHelium go down, fighting, beneath an overwhelming force.\r\n\r\nThe palace gate flies open and a force of the jeddak’s own guard,\r\npicked men from the flower of the Okarian army, sallies forth to\r\nshatter the broken regiments. For a moment it looks as though nothing\r\ncould avert defeat, and then I see a noble figure upon a mighty\r\nthoat—not the tiny thoat of the red man, but one of his huge cousins of\r\nthe dead sea bottoms.\r\n\r\nThe warrior hews his way to the front, and behind him rally the\r\ndisorganized soldiers of Helium. As he raises his head aloft to fling a\r\nchallenge at the men upon the palace walls I see his face, and my heart\r\nswells in pride and happiness as the red warriors leap to the side of\r\ntheir leader and win back the ground that they had but just lost—the\r\nface of him upon the mighty thoat is the face of my son—Carthoris of\r\nHelium.\r\n\r\nAt his side fights a huge Martian war-hound, nor did I need a second\r\nlook to know that it was Woola—my faithful Woola who had thus well\r\nperformed his arduous task and brought the succoring legions in the\r\nnick of time.\r\n\r\n“In the nick of time?”\r\n\r\nWho yet might say that they were not too late to save, but surely they\r\ncould avenge! And such retribution as that unconquered army would deal\r\nout to the hateful Okarians! I sighed to think that I might not be\r\nalive to witness it.\r\n\r\nAgain I turned to the windows. The red men had not yet forced the outer\r\npalace wall, but they were fighting nobly against the best that Okar\r\nafforded—valiant warriors who contested every inch of the way.\r\n\r\nNow my attention was caught by a new element without the city wall—a\r\ngreat body of mounted warriors looming large above the red men. They\r\nwere the huge green allies of Helium—the savage hordes from the dead\r\nsea bottoms of the far south.\r\n\r\nIn grim and terrible silence they sped on toward the gate, the padded\r\nhoofs of their frightful mounts giving forth no sound. Into the doomed\r\ncity they charged, and as they wheeled across the wide plaza before the\r\npalace of the Jeddak of Jeddaks I saw, riding at their head, the mighty\r\nfigure of their mighty leader—Tars Tarkas, Jeddak of Thark.\r\n\r\nMy wish, then, was to be gratified, for I was to see my old friend\r\nbattling once again, and though not shoulder to shoulder with him, I,\r\ntoo, would be fighting in the same cause here in the high tower of\r\nOkar.\r\n\r\nNor did it seem that our foes would ever cease their stubborn attacks,\r\nfor still they came, though the way to our chamber was often clogged\r\nwith the bodies of their dead. At times they would pause long enough to\r\ndrag back the impeding corpses, and then fresh warriors would forge\r\nupward to taste the cup of death.\r\n\r\nI had been taking my turn with the others in defending the approach to\r\nour lofty retreat when Mors Kajak, who had been watching the battle in\r\nthe street below, called aloud in sudden excitement. There was a note\r\nof apprehension in his voice that brought me to his side the instant\r\nthat I could turn my place over to another, and as I reached him he\r\npointed far out across the waste of snow and ice toward the southern\r\nhorizon.\r\n\r\n“Alas!” he cried, “that I should be forced to witness cruel fate betray\r\nthem without power to warn or aid; but they be past either now.”\r\n\r\nAs I looked in the direction he indicated I saw the cause of his\r\nperturbation. A mighty fleet of fliers was approaching majestically\r\ntoward Kadabra from the direction of the ice-barrier. On and on they\r\ncame with ever increasing velocity.\r\n\r\n“The grim shaft that they call the Guardian of the North is beckoning\r\nto them,” said Mors Kajak sadly, “just as it beckoned to Tardos Mors\r\nand his great fleet; see where they lie, crumpled and broken, a grim\r\nand terrible monument to the mighty force of destruction which naught\r\ncan resist.”\r\n\r\nI, too, saw; but something else I saw that Mors Kajak did not; in my\r\nmind’s eye I saw a buried chamber whose walls were lined with strange\r\ninstruments and devices.\r\n\r\nIn the center of the chamber was a long table, and before it sat a\r\nlittle, pop-eyed old man counting his money; but, plainest of all, I\r\nsaw upon the wall a great switch with a small magnet inlaid within the\r\nsurface of its black handle.\r\n\r\nThen I glanced out at the fast-approaching fleet. In five minutes that\r\nmighty armada of the skies would be bent and worthless scrap, lying at\r\nthe base of the shaft beyond the city’s wall, and yellow hordes would\r\nbe loosed from another gate to rush out upon the few survivors\r\nstumbling blindly down through the mass of wreckage; then the apts\r\nwould come. I shuddered at the thought, for I could vividly picture the\r\nwhole horrible scene.\r\n\r\nQuick have I always been to decide and act. The impulse that moves me\r\nand the doing of the thing seem simultaneous; for if my mind goes\r\nthrough the tedious formality of reasoning, it must be a subconscious\r\nact of which I am not objectively aware. Psychologists tell me that, as\r\nthe subconscious does not reason, too close a scrutiny of my mental\r\nactivities might prove anything but flattering; but be that as it may,\r\nI have often won success while the thinker would have been still at the\r\nendless task of comparing various judgments.\r\n\r\nAnd now celerity of action was the prime essential to the success of\r\nthe thing that I had decided upon.\r\n\r\nGrasping my sword more firmly in my hand, I called to the red man at\r\nthe opening to the runway to stand aside.\r\n\r\n“Way for the Prince of Helium!” I shouted; and before the astonished\r\nyellow man whose misfortune it was to be at the fighting end of the\r\nline at that particular moment could gather his wits together my sword\r\nhad decapitated him, and I was rushing like a mad bull down upon those\r\nbehind him.\r\n\r\n“Way for the Prince of Helium!” I shouted as I cut a path through the\r\nastonished guardsmen of Salensus Oll.\r\n\r\nHewing to right and left, I beat my way down that warrior-choked spiral\r\nuntil, near the bottom, those below, thinking that an army was\r\ndescending upon them, turned and fled.\r\n\r\nThe armory at the first floor was vacant when I entered it, the last of\r\nthe Okarians having fled into the courtyard, so none saw me continue\r\ndown the spiral toward the corridor beneath.\r\n\r\nHere I ran as rapidly as my legs would carry me toward the five\r\ncorners, and there plunged into the passageway that led to the station\r\nof the old miser.\r\n\r\nWithout the formality of a knock, I burst into the room. There sat the\r\nold man at his table; but as he saw me he sprang to his feet, drawing\r\nhis sword.\r\n\r\nWith scarce more than a glance toward him I leaped for the great\r\nswitch; but, quick as I was, that wiry old fellow was there before me.\r\n\r\nHow he did it I shall never know, nor does it seem credible that any\r\nMartian-born creature could approximate the marvelous speed of my\r\nearthly muscles.\r\n\r\nLike a tiger he turned upon me, and I was quick to see why Solan had\r\nbeen chosen for this important duty.\r\n\r\nNever in all my life have I seen such wondrous swordsmanship and such\r\nuncanny agility as that ancient bag of bones displayed. He was in forty\r\nplaces at the same time, and before I had half a chance to awaken to my\r\ndanger he was like to have made a monkey of me, and a dead monkey at\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nIt is strange how new and unexpected conditions bring out unguessed\r\nability to meet them.\r\n\r\nThat day in the buried chamber beneath the palace of Salensus Oll I\r\nlearned what swordsmanship meant, and to what heights of sword mastery\r\nI could achieve when pitted against such a wizard of the blade as\r\nSolan.\r\n\r\nFor a time he liked to have bested me; but presently the latent\r\npossibilities that must have been lying dormant within me for a\r\nlifetime came to the fore, and I fought as I had never dreamed a human\r\nbeing could fight.\r\n\r\nThat that duel-royal should have taken place in the dark recesses of a\r\ncellar, without a single appreciative eye to witness it has always\r\nseemed to me almost a world calamity—at least from the viewpoint\r\nBarsoomian, where bloody strife is the first and greatest consideration\r\nof individuals, nations, and races.\r\n\r\nI was fighting to reach the switch, Solan to prevent me; and, though we\r\nstood not three feet from it, I could not win an inch toward it, for he\r\nforced me back an inch for the first five minutes of our battle.\r\n\r\nI knew that if I were to throw it in time to save the oncoming fleet it\r\nmust be done in the next few seconds, and so I tried my old rushing\r\ntactics; but I might as well have rushed a brick wall for all that\r\nSolan gave way.\r\n\r\nIn fact, I came near to impaling myself upon his point for my pains;\r\nbut right was on my side, and I think that that must give a man greater\r\nconfidence than though he knew himself to be battling in a wicked\r\ncause.\r\n\r\nAt least, I did not want in confidence; and when I next rushed Solan it\r\nwas to one side with implicit confidence that he must turn to meet my\r\nnew line of attack, and turn he did, so that now we fought with our\r\nsides towards the coveted goal—the great switch stood within my reach\r\nupon my right hand.\r\n\r\nTo uncover my breast for an instant would have been to court sudden\r\ndeath, but I saw no other way than to chance it, if by so doing I might\r\nrescue that oncoming, succoring fleet; and so, in the face of a wicked\r\nsword-thrust, I reached out my point and caught the great switch a\r\nsudden blow that released it from its seating.\r\n\r\nSo surprised and horrified was Solan that he forgot to finish his\r\nthrust; instead, he wheeled toward the switch with a loud shriek—a\r\nshriek which was his last, for before his hand could touch the lever it\r\nsought, my sword’s point had passed through his heart.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TIDE OF BATTLE\r\n\r\n\r\nBut Solan’s last loud cry had not been without effect, for a moment\r\nlater a dozen guardsmen burst into the chamber, though not before I had\r\nso bent and demolished the great switch that it could not be again used\r\nto turn the powerful current into the mighty magnet of destruction it\r\ncontrolled.\r\n\r\nThe result of the sudden coming of the guardsmen had been to compel me\r\nto seek seclusion in the first passageway that I could find, and that\r\nto my disappointment proved to be not the one with which I was\r\nfamiliar, but another upon its left.\r\n\r\nThey must have either heard or guessed which way I went, for I had\r\nproceeded but a short distance when I heard the sound of pursuit. I had\r\nno mind to stop and fight these men here when there was fighting\r\naplenty elsewhere in the city of Kadabra—fighting that could be of much\r\nmore avail to me and mine than useless life-taking far below the\r\npalace.\r\n\r\nBut the fellows were pressing me; and as I did not know the way at all,\r\nI soon saw that they would overtake me unless I found a place to\r\nconceal myself until they had passed, which would then give me an\r\nopportunity to return the way I had come and regain the tower, or\r\npossibly find a way to reach the city streets.\r\n\r\nThe passageway had risen rapidly since leaving the apartment of the\r\nswitch, and now ran level and well lighted straight into the distance\r\nas far as I could see. The moment that my pursuers reached this\r\nstraight stretch I would be in plain sight of them, with no chance to\r\nescape from the corridor undetected.\r\n\r\nPresently I saw a series of doors opening from either side of the\r\ncorridor, and as they all looked alike to me I tried the first one that\r\nI reached. It opened into a small chamber, luxuriously furnished, and\r\nwas evidently an ante-chamber off some office or audience chamber of\r\nthe palace.\r\n\r\nOn the far side was a heavily curtained doorway beyond which I heard\r\nthe hum of voices. Instantly I crossed the small chamber, and, parting\r\nthe curtains, looked within the larger apartment.\r\n\r\nBefore me were a party of perhaps fifty gorgeously clad nobles of the\r\ncourt, standing before a throne upon which sat Salensus Oll. The Jeddak\r\nof Jeddaks was addressing them.\r\n\r\n“The allotted hour has come,” he was saying as I entered the apartment;\r\n“and though the enemies of Okar be within her gates, naught may stay\r\nthe will of Salensus Oll. The great ceremony must be omitted that no\r\nsingle man may be kept from his place in the defenses other than the\r\nfifty that custom demands shall witness the creation of a new queen in\r\nOkar.\r\n\r\n“In a moment the thing shall have been done and we may return to the\r\nbattle, while she who is now the Princess of Helium looks down from the\r\nqueen’s tower upon the annihilation of her former countrymen and\r\nwitnesses the greatness which is her husband’s.”\r\n\r\nThen, turning to a courtier, he issued some command in a low voice.\r\n\r\nThe addressed hastened to a small door at the far end of the chamber\r\nand, swinging it wide, cried: “Way for Dejah Thoris, future Queen of\r\nOkar!”\r\n\r\nImmediately two guardsmen appeared dragging the unwilling bride toward\r\nthe altar. Her hands were still manacled behind her, evidently to\r\nprevent suicide.\r\n\r\nHer disheveled hair and panting bosom betokened that, chained though\r\nshe was, still had she fought against the thing that they would do to\r\nher.\r\n\r\nAt sight of her Salensus Oll rose and drew his sword, and the sword of\r\neach of the fifty nobles was raised on high to form an arch, beneath\r\nwhich the poor, beautiful creature was dragged toward her doom.\r\n\r\nA grim smile forced itself to my lips as I thought of the rude\r\nawakening that lay in store for the ruler of Okar, and my itching\r\nfingers fondled the hilt of my bloody sword.\r\n\r\nAs I watched the procession that moved slowly toward the throne—a\r\nprocession which consisted of but a handful of priests, who followed\r\nDejah Thoris and the two guardsmen—I caught a fleeting glimpse of a\r\nblack face peering from behind the draperies that covered the wall back\r\nof the dais upon which stood Salensus Oll awaiting his bride.\r\n\r\nNow the guardsmen were forcing the Princess of Helium up the few steps\r\nto the side of the tyrant of Okar, and I had no eyes and no thoughts\r\nfor aught else. A priest opened a book and, raising his hand, commenced\r\nto drone out a sing-song ritual. Salensus Oll reached for the hand of\r\nhis bride.\r\n\r\nI had intended waiting until some circumstance should give me a\r\nreasonable hope of success; for, even though the entire ceremony should\r\nbe completed, there could be no valid marriage while I lived. What I\r\nwas most concerned in, of course, was the rescuing of Dejah Thoris—I\r\nwished to take her from the palace of Salensus Oll, if such a thing\r\nwere possible; but whether it were accomplished before or after the\r\nmock marriage was a matter of secondary import.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, I saw the vile hand of Salensus Oll reach out for the\r\nhand of my beloved princess I could restrain myself no longer, and\r\nbefore the nobles of Okar knew that aught had happened I had leaped\r\nthrough their thin line and was upon the dais beside Dejah Thoris and\r\nSalensus Oll.\r\n\r\nWith the flat of my sword I struck down his polluting hand; and\r\ngrasping Dejah Thoris round the waist, I swung her behind me as, with\r\nmy back against the draperies of the dais, I faced the tyrant of the\r\nnorth and his roomful of noble warriors.\r\n\r\nThe Jeddak of Jeddaks was a great mountain of a man—a coarse, brutal\r\nbeast of a man—and as he towered above me there, his fierce black\r\nwhiskers and mustache bristling in rage, I can well imagine that a less\r\nseasoned warrior might have trembled before him.\r\n\r\nWith a snarl he sprang toward me with naked sword, but whether Salensus\r\nOll was a good swordsman or a poor I never learned; for with Dejah\r\nThoris at my back I was no longer human—I was a superman, and no man\r\ncould have withstood me then.\r\n\r\nWith a single, low: “For the Princess of Helium!” I ran my blade\r\nstraight through the rotten heart of Okar’s rotten ruler, and before\r\nthe white, drawn faces of his nobles Salensus Oll rolled, grinning in\r\nhorrible death, to the foot of the steps below his marriage throne.\r\n\r\nFor a moment tense silence reigned in the nuptial-room. Then the fifty\r\nnobles rushed upon me. Furiously we fought, but the advantage was mine,\r\nfor I stood upon a raised platform above them, and I fought for the\r\nmost glorious woman of a glorious race, and I fought for a great love\r\nand for the mother of my boy.\r\n\r\nAnd from behind my shoulder, in the silvery cadence of that dear voice,\r\nrose the brave battle anthem of Helium which the nation’s women sing as\r\ntheir men march out to victory.\r\n\r\nThat alone was enough to inspire me to victory over even greater odds,\r\nand I verily believe that I should have bested the entire roomful of\r\nyellow warriors that day in the nuptial chamber of the palace at\r\nKadabra had not interruption come to my aid.\r\n\r\nFast and furious was the fighting as the nobles of Salensus Oll sprang,\r\ntime and again, up the steps before the throne only to fall back before\r\na sword hand that seemed to have gained a new wizardry from its\r\nexperience with the cunning Solan.\r\n\r\nTwo were pressing me so closely that I could not turn when I heard a\r\nmovement behind me, and noted that the sound of the battle anthem had\r\nceased. Was Dejah Thoris preparing to take her place beside me?\r\n\r\nHeroic daughter of a heroic world! It would not be unlike her to have\r\nseized a sword and fought at my side, for, though the women of Mars are\r\nnot trained in the arts of war, the spirit is theirs, and they have\r\nbeen known to do that very thing upon countless occasions.\r\n\r\nBut she did not come, and glad I was, for it would have doubled my\r\nburden in protecting her before I should have been able to force her\r\nback again out of harm’s way. She must be contemplating some cunning\r\nstrategy, I thought, and so I fought on secure in the belief that my\r\ndivine princess stood close behind me.\r\n\r\nFor half an hour at least I must have fought there against the nobles\r\nof Okar ere ever a one placed a foot upon the dais where I stood, and\r\nthen of a sudden all that remained of them formed below me for a last,\r\nmad, desperate charge; but even as they advanced the door at the far\r\nend of the chamber swung wide and a wild-eyed messenger sprang into the\r\nroom.\r\n\r\n“The Jeddak of Jeddaks!” he cried. “Where is the Jeddak of Jeddaks? The\r\ncity has fallen before the hordes from beyond the barrier, and but now\r\nthe great gate of the palace itself has been forced and the warriors of\r\nthe south are pouring into its sacred precincts.\r\n\r\n“Where is Salensus Oll? He alone may revive the flagging courage of our\r\nwarriors. He alone may save the day for Okar. Where is Salensus Oll?”\r\n\r\nThe nobles stepped back from about the dead body of their ruler, and\r\none of them pointed to the grinning corpse.\r\n\r\nThe messenger staggered back in horror as though from a blow in the\r\nface.\r\n\r\n“Then fly, nobles of Okar!” he cried, “for naught can save you. Hark!\r\nThey come!”\r\n\r\nAs he spoke we heard the deep roar of angry men from the corridor\r\nwithout, and the clank of metal and the clang of swords.\r\n\r\nWithout another glance toward me, who had stood a spectator of the\r\ntragic scene, the nobles wheeled and fled from the apartment through\r\nanother exit.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately a force of yellow warriors appeared in the doorway\r\nthrough which the messenger had come. They were backing toward the\r\napartment, stubbornly resisting the advance of a handful of red men who\r\nfaced them and forced them slowly but inevitably back.\r\n\r\nAbove the heads of the contestants I could see from my elevated station\r\nupon the dais the face of my old friend Kantos Kan. He was leading the\r\nlittle party that had won its way into the very heart of the palace of\r\nSalensus Oll.\r\n\r\nIn an instant I saw that by attacking the Okarians from the rear I\r\ncould so quickly disorganize them that their further resistance would\r\nbe short-lived, and with this idea in mind I sprang from the dais,\r\ncasting a word of explanation to Dejah Thoris over my shoulder, though\r\nI did not turn to look at her.\r\n\r\nWith myself ever between her enemies and herself, and with Kantos Kan\r\nand his warriors winning to the apartment, there could be no danger to\r\nDejah Thoris standing there alone beside the throne.\r\n\r\nI wanted the men of Helium to see me and to know that their beloved\r\nprincess was here, too, for I knew that this knowledge would inspire\r\nthem to even greater deeds of valor than they had performed in the\r\npast, though great indeed must have been those which won for them a way\r\ninto the almost impregnable palace of the tyrant of the north.\r\n\r\nAs I crossed the chamber to attack the Kadabrans from the rear a small\r\ndoorway at my left opened, and, to my surprise, revealed the figures of\r\nMatai Shang, Father of Therns and Phaidor, his daughter, peering into\r\nthe room.\r\n\r\nA quick glance about they took. Their eyes rested for a moment, wide in\r\nhorror, upon the dead body of Salensus Oll, upon the blood that\r\ncrimsoned the floor, upon the corpses of the nobles who had fallen\r\nthick before the throne, upon me, and upon the battling warriors at the\r\nother door.\r\n\r\nThey did not essay to enter the apartment, but scanned its every corner\r\nfrom where they stood, and then, when their eyes had sought its entire\r\narea, a look of fierce rage overspread the features of Matai Shang, and\r\na cold and cunning smile touched the lips of Phaidor.\r\n\r\nThen they were gone, but not before a taunting laugh was thrown\r\ndirectly in my face by the woman.\r\n\r\nI did not understand then the meaning of Matai Shang’s rage or\r\nPhaidor’s pleasure, but I knew that neither boded good for me.\r\n\r\nA moment later I was upon the backs of the yellow men, and as the red\r\nmen of Helium saw me above the shoulders of their antagonists a great\r\nshout rang through the corridor, and for a moment drowned the noise of\r\nbattle.\r\n\r\n“For the Prince of Helium!” they cried. “For the Prince of Helium!”\r\nand, like hungry lions upon their prey, they fell once more upon the\r\nweakening warriors of the north.\r\n\r\nThe yellow men, cornered between two enemies, fought with the\r\ndesperation that utter hopelessness often induces. Fought as I should\r\nhave fought had I been in their stead, with the determination to take\r\nas many of my enemies with me when I died as lay within the power of my\r\nsword arm.\r\n\r\nIt was a glorious battle, but the end seemed inevitable, when presently\r\nfrom down the corridor behind the red men came a great body of\r\nreenforcing yellow warriors.\r\n\r\nNow were the tables turned, and it was the men of Helium who seemed\r\ndoomed to be ground between two millstones. All were compelled to turn\r\nto meet this new assault by a greatly superior force, so that to me was\r\nleft the remnants of the yellow men within the throneroom.\r\n\r\nThey kept me busy, too; so busy that I began to wonder if indeed I\r\nshould ever be done with them. Slowly they pressed me back into the\r\nroom, and when they had all passed in after me, one of them closed and\r\nbolted the door, effectually barring the way against the men of Kantos\r\nKan.\r\n\r\nIt was a clever move, for it put me at the mercy of a dozen men within\r\na chamber from which assistance was locked out, and it gave the red men\r\nin the corridor beyond no avenue of escape should their new antagonists\r\npress them too closely.\r\n\r\nBut I have faced heavier odds myself than were pitted against me that\r\nday, and I knew that Kantos Kan had battled his way from a hundred more\r\ndangerous traps than that in which he now was. So it was with no\r\nfeelings of despair that I turned my attention to the business of the\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nConstantly my thoughts reverted to Dejah Thoris, and I longed for the\r\nmoment when, the fighting done, I could fold her in my arms, and hear\r\nonce more the words of love which had been denied me for so many years.\r\n\r\nDuring the fighting in the chamber I had not even a single chance to so\r\nmuch as steal a glance at her where she stood behind me beside the\r\nthrone of the dead ruler. I wondered why she no longer urged me on with\r\nthe strains of the martial hymn of Helium; but I did not need more than\r\nthe knowledge that I was battling for her to bring out the best that is\r\nin me.\r\n\r\nIt would be wearisome to narrate the details of that bloody struggle;\r\nof how we fought from the doorway, the full length of the room to the\r\nvery foot of the throne before the last of my antagonists fell with my\r\nblade piercing his heart.\r\n\r\nAnd then, with a glad cry, I turned with outstretched arms to seize my\r\nprincess, and as my lips smothered hers to reap the reward that would\r\nbe thrice ample payment for the bloody encounters through which I had\r\npassed for her dear sake from the south pole to the north.\r\n\r\nThe glad cry died, frozen upon my lips; my arms dropped limp and\r\nlifeless to my sides; as one who reels beneath the burden of a mortal\r\nwound I staggered up the steps before the throne.\r\n\r\nDejah Thoris was gone.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nREWARDS\r\n\r\n\r\nWith the realization that Dejah Thoris was no longer within the\r\nthroneroom came the belated recollection of the dark face that I had\r\nglimpsed peering from behind the draperies that backed the throne of\r\nSalensus Oll at the moment that I had first come so unexpectedly upon\r\nthe strange scene being enacted within the chamber.\r\n\r\nWhy had the sight of that evil countenance not warned me to greater\r\ncaution? Why had I permitted the rapid development of new situations to\r\nefface the recollection of that menacing danger? But, alas, vain regret\r\nwould not erase the calamity that had befallen.\r\n\r\nOnce again had Dejah Thoris fallen into the clutches of that archfiend,\r\nThurid, the black dator of the First Born. Again was all my arduous\r\nlabor gone for naught. Now I realized the cause of the rage that had\r\nbeen writ so large upon the features of Matai Shang and the cruel\r\npleasure that I had seen upon the face of Phaidor.\r\n\r\nThey had known or guessed the truth, and the hekkador of the Holy\r\nTherns, who had evidently come to the chamber in the hope of thwarting\r\nSalensus Oll in his contemplated perfidy against the high priest who\r\ncoveted Dejah Thoris for himself, realized that Thurid had stolen the\r\nprize from beneath his very nose.\r\n\r\nPhaidor’s pleasure had been due to her realization of what this last\r\ncruel blow would mean to me, as well as to a partial satisfaction of\r\nher jealous hatred for the Princess of Helium.\r\n\r\nMy first thought was to look beyond the draperies at the back of the\r\nthrone, for there it was that I had seen Thurid. With a single jerk I\r\ntore the priceless stuff from its fastenings, and there before me was\r\nrevealed a narrow doorway behind the throne.\r\n\r\nNo question entered my mind but that here lay the opening of the avenue\r\nof escape which Thurid had followed, and had there been it would have\r\nbeen dissipated by the sight of a tiny, jeweled ornament which lay a\r\nfew steps within the corridor beyond.\r\n\r\nAs I snatched up the bauble I saw that it bore the device of the\r\nPrincess of Helium, and then pressing it to my lips I dashed madly\r\nalong the winding way that led gently downward toward the lower\r\ngalleries of the palace.\r\n\r\nI had followed but a short distance when I came upon the room in which\r\nSolan formerly had held sway. His dead body still lay where I had left\r\nit, nor was there any sign that another had passed through the room\r\nsince I had been there; but I knew that two had done so—Thurid, the\r\nblack dator, and Dejah Thoris.\r\n\r\nFor a moment I paused uncertain as to which of the several exits from\r\nthe apartment would lead me upon the right path. I tried to recollect\r\nthe directions which I had heard Thurid repeat to Solan, and at last,\r\nslowly, as though through a heavy fog, the memory of the words of the\r\nFirst Born came to me:\r\n\r\n“Follow a corridor, passing three diverging corridors upon the right;\r\nthen into the fourth right-hand corridor to where three corridors meet;\r\nhere again follow to the right, hugging the left wall closely to avoid\r\nthe pit. At the end of this corridor I shall come to a spiral runway\r\nwhich I must follow down instead of up; after that the way is along but\r\na single branchless corridor.”\r\n\r\nAnd I recalled the exit at which he had pointed as he spoke.\r\n\r\nIt did not take me long to start upon that unknown way, nor did I go\r\nwith caution, although I knew that there might be grave dangers before\r\nme.\r\n\r\nPart of the way was black as sin, but for the most it was fairly well\r\nlighted. The stretch where I must hug the left wall to avoid the pits\r\nwas darkest of them all, and I was nearly over the edge of the abyss\r\nbefore I knew that I was near the danger spot. A narrow ledge, scarce a\r\nfoot wide, was all that had been left to carry the initiated past that\r\nfrightful cavity into which the unknowing must surely have toppled at\r\nthe first step. But at last I had won safely beyond it, and then a\r\nfeeble light made the balance of the way plain, until, at the end of\r\nthe last corridor, I came suddenly out into the glare of day upon a\r\nfield of snow and ice.\r\n\r\nClad for the warm atmosphere of the hothouse city of Kadabra, the\r\nsudden change to arctic frigidity was anything but pleasant; but the\r\nworst of it was that I knew I could not endure the bitter cold, almost\r\nnaked as I was, and that I would perish before ever I could overtake\r\nThurid and Dejah Thoris.\r\n\r\nTo be thus blocked by nature, who had had all the arts and wiles of\r\ncunning man pitted against him, seemed a cruel fate, and as I staggered\r\nback into the warmth of the tunnel’s end I was as near hopelessness as\r\nI ever have been.\r\n\r\nI had by no means given up my intention of continuing the pursuit, for\r\nif needs be I would go ahead though I perished ere ever I reached my\r\ngoal, but if there were a safer way it were well worth the delay to\r\nattempt to discover it, that I might come again to the side of Dejah\r\nThoris in fit condition to do battle for her.\r\n\r\nScarce had I returned to the tunnel than I stumbled over a portion of a\r\nfur garment that seemed fastened to the floor of the corridor close to\r\nthe wall. In the darkness I could not see what held it, but by groping\r\nwith my hands I discovered that it was wedged beneath the bottom of a\r\nclosed door.\r\n\r\nPushing the portal aside, I found myself upon the threshold of a small\r\nchamber, the walls of which were lined with hooks from which depended\r\nsuits of the complete outdoor apparel of the yellow men.\r\n\r\nSituated as it was at the mouth of a tunnel leading from the palace, it\r\nwas quite evident that this was the dressing-room used by the nobles\r\nleaving and entering the hothouse city, and that Thurid, having\r\nknowledge of it, had stopped here to outfit himself and Dejah Thoris\r\nbefore venturing into the bitter cold of the arctic world beyond.\r\n\r\nIn his haste he had dropped several garments upon the floor, and the\r\ntelltale fur that had fallen partly within the corridor had proved the\r\nmeans of guiding me to the very spot he would least have wished me to\r\nhave knowledge of.\r\n\r\nIt required but the matter of a few seconds to don the necessary\r\norluk-skin clothing, with the heavy, fur-lined boots that are so\r\nessential a part of the garmenture of one who would successfully\r\ncontend with the frozen trails and the icy winds of the bleak\r\nnorthland.\r\n\r\nOnce more I stepped beyond the tunnel’s mouth to find the fresh tracks\r\nof Thurid and Dejah Thoris in the new-fallen snow. Now, at last, was my\r\ntask an easy one, for though the going was rough in the extreme, I was\r\nno longer vexed by doubts as to the direction I should follow, or\r\nharassed by darkness or hidden dangers.\r\n\r\nThrough a snow-covered canyon the way led up toward the summit of low\r\nhills. Beyond these it dipped again into another canyon, only to rise a\r\nquarter-mile farther on toward a pass which skirted the flank of a\r\nrocky hill.\r\n\r\nI could see by the signs of those who had gone before that when Dejah\r\nThoris had walked she had been continually holding back, and that the\r\nblack man had been compelled to drag her. For other stretches only his\r\nfoot-prints were visible, deep and close together in the heavy snow,\r\nand I knew from these signs that then he had been forced to carry her,\r\nand I could well imagine that she had fought him fiercely every step of\r\nthe way.\r\n\r\nAs I came round the jutting promontory of the hill’s shoulder I saw\r\nthat which quickened my pulses and set my heart to beating high, for\r\nwithin a tiny basin between the crest of this hill and the next stood\r\nfour people before the mouth of a great cave, and beside them upon the\r\ngleaming snow rested a flier which had evidently but just been dragged\r\nfrom its hiding place.\r\n\r\nThe four were Dejah Thoris, Phaidor, Thurid, and Matai Shang. The two\r\nmen were engaged in a heated argument—the Father of Therns threatening,\r\nwhile the black scoffed at him as he went about the work at which he\r\nwas engaged.\r\n\r\nAs I crept toward them cautiously that I might come as near as possible\r\nbefore being discovered, I saw that finally the men appeared to have\r\nreached some sort of a compromise, for with Phaidor’s assistance they\r\nboth set about dragging the resisting Dejah Thoris to the flier’s deck.\r\n\r\nHere they made her fast, and then both again descended to the ground to\r\ncomplete the preparations for departure. Phaidor entered the small\r\ncabin upon the vessel’s deck.\r\n\r\nI had come to within a quarter of a mile of them when Matai Shang\r\nespied me. I saw him seize Thurid by the shoulder, wheeling him around\r\nin my direction as he pointed to where I was now plainly visible, for\r\nthe moment that I knew I had been perceived I cast aside every attempt\r\nat stealth and broke into a mad race for the flier.\r\n\r\nThe two redoubled their efforts at the propeller at which they were\r\nworking, and which very evidently was being replaced after having been\r\nremoved for some purpose of repair.\r\n\r\nThey had the thing completed before I had covered half the distance\r\nthat lay between me and them, and then both made a rush for the\r\nboarding-ladder.\r\n\r\nThurid was the first to reach it, and with the agility of a monkey\r\nclambered swiftly to the boat’s deck, where a touch of the button\r\ncontrolling the buoyancy tanks sent the craft slowly upward, though not\r\nwith the speed that marks the well-conditioned flier.\r\n\r\nI was still some hundred yards away as I saw them rising from my grasp.\r\n\r\nBack by the city of Kadabra lay a great fleet of mighty fliers—the\r\nships of Helium and Ptarth that I had saved from destruction earlier in\r\nthe day; but before ever I could reach them Thurid could easily make\r\ngood his escape.\r\n\r\nAs I ran I saw Matai Shang clambering up the swaying, swinging ladder\r\ntoward the deck, while above him leaned the evil face of the First\r\nBorn. A trailing rope from the vessel’s stern put new hope in me, for\r\nif I could but reach it before it whipped too high above my head there\r\nwas yet a chance to gain the deck by its slender aid.\r\n\r\nThat there was something radically wrong with the flier was evident\r\nfrom its lack of buoyancy, and the further fact that though Thurid had\r\nturned twice to the starting lever the boat still hung motionless in\r\nthe air, except for a slight drifting with a low breeze from the north.\r\n\r\nNow Matai Shang was close to the gunwale. A long, claw-like hand was\r\nreaching up to grasp the metal rail.\r\n\r\nThurid leaned farther down toward his co-conspirator.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a raised dagger gleamed in the upflung hand of the black. Down\r\nit drove toward the white face of the Father of Therns. With a loud\r\nshriek of fear the Holy Hekkador grasped frantically at that menacing\r\narm.\r\n\r\nI was almost to the trailing rope by now. The craft was still rising\r\nslowly, the while it drifted from me. Then I stumbled on the icy way,\r\nstriking my head upon a rock as I fell sprawling but an arm’s length\r\nfrom the rope, the end of which was now just leaving the ground.\r\n\r\nWith the blow upon my head came unconsciousness.\r\n\r\nIt could not have been more than a few seconds that I lay senseless\r\nthere upon the northern ice, while all that was dearest to me drifted\r\nfarther from my reach in the clutches of that black fiend, for when I\r\nopened my eyes Thurid and Matai Shang yet battled at the ladder’s top,\r\nand the flier drifted but a hundred yards farther to the south—but the\r\nend of the trailing rope was now a good thirty feet above the ground.\r\n\r\nGoaded to madness by the cruel misfortune that had tripped me when\r\nsuccess was almost within my grasp, I tore frantically across the\r\nintervening space, and just beneath the rope’s dangling end I put my\r\nearthly muscles to the supreme test.\r\n\r\nWith a mighty, catlike bound I sprang upward toward that slender\r\nstrand—the only avenue which yet remained that could carry me to my\r\nvanishing love.\r\n\r\nA foot above its lowest end my fingers closed. Tightly as I clung I\r\nfelt the rope slipping, slipping through my grasp. I tried to raise my\r\nfree hand to take a second hold above my first, but the change of\r\nposition that resulted caused me to slip more rapidly toward the end of\r\nthe rope.\r\n\r\nSlowly I felt the tantalizing thing escaping me. In a moment all that I\r\nhad gained would be lost—then my fingers reached a knot at the very end\r\nof the rope and slipped no more.\r\n\r\nWith a prayer of gratitude upon my lips I scrambled upward toward the\r\nboat’s deck. I could not see Thurid and Matai Shang now, but I heard\r\nthe sounds of conflict and thus knew that they still fought—the thern\r\nfor his life and the black for the increased buoyancy that relief from\r\nthe weight of even a single body would give the craft.\r\n\r\nShould Matai Shang die before I reached the deck my chances of ever\r\nreaching it would be slender indeed, for the black dator need but cut\r\nthe rope above me to be freed from me forever, for the vessel had\r\ndrifted across the brink of a chasm into whose yawning depths my body\r\nwould drop to be crushed to a shapeless pulp should Thurid reach the\r\nrope now.\r\n\r\nAt last my hand closed upon the ship’s rail and that very instant a\r\nhorrid shriek rang out below me that sent my blood cold and turned my\r\nhorrified eyes downward to a shrieking, hurtling, twisting thing that\r\nshot downward into the awful chasm beneath me.\r\n\r\nIt was Matai Shang, Holy Hekkador, Father of Therns, gone to his last\r\naccounting.\r\n\r\nThen my head came above the deck and I saw Thurid, dagger in hand,\r\nleaping toward me. He was opposite the forward end of the cabin, while\r\nI was attempting to clamber aboard near the vessel’s stern. But a few\r\npaces lay between us. No power on earth could raise me to that deck\r\nbefore the infuriated black would be upon me.\r\n\r\nMy end had come. I knew it; but had there been a doubt in my mind the\r\nnasty leer of triumph upon that wicked face would have convinced me.\r\nBeyond Thurid I could see my Dejah Thoris, wide-eyed and horrified,\r\nstruggling at her bonds. That she should be forced to witness my awful\r\ndeath made my bitter fate seem doubly cruel.\r\n\r\nI ceased my efforts to climb across the gunwale. Instead I took a firm\r\ngrasp upon the rail with my left hand and drew my dagger.\r\n\r\nI should at least die as I had lived—fighting.\r\n\r\nAs Thurid came opposite the cabin’s doorway a new element projected\r\nitself into the grim tragedy of the air that was being enacted upon the\r\ndeck of Matai Shang’s disabled flier.\r\n\r\nIt was Phaidor.\r\n\r\nWith flushed face and disheveled hair, and eyes that betrayed the\r\nrecent presence of mortal tears—above which this proud goddess had\r\nalways held herself—she leaped to the deck directly before me.\r\n\r\nIn her hand was a long, slim dagger. I cast a last look upon my beloved\r\nprincess, smiling, as men should who are about to die. Then I turned my\r\nface up toward Phaidor—waiting for the blow.\r\n\r\nNever have I seen that beautiful face more beautiful than it was at\r\nthat moment. It seemed incredible that one so lovely could yet harbor\r\nwithin her fair bosom a heart so cruel and relentless, and today there\r\nwas a new expression in her wondrous eyes that I never before had seen\r\nthere—an unfamiliar softness, and a look of suffering.\r\n\r\nThurid was beside her now—pushing past to reach me first, and then what\r\nhappened happened so quickly that it was all over before I could\r\nrealize the truth of it.\r\n\r\nPhaidor’s slim hand shot out to close upon the black’s dagger wrist.\r\nHer right hand went high with its gleaming blade.\r\n\r\n“That for Matai Shang!” she cried, and she buried her blade deep in the\r\ndator’s breast. “That for the wrong you would have done Dejah Thoris!”\r\nand again the sharp steel sank into the bloody flesh.\r\n\r\n“And that, and that, and that!” she shrieked, “for John Carter, Prince\r\nof Helium,” and with each word her sharp point pierced the vile heart\r\nof the great villain. Then, with a vindictive shove she cast the\r\ncarcass of the First Born from the deck to fall in awful silence after\r\nthe body of his victim.\r\n\r\nI had been so paralyzed by surprise that I had made no move to reach\r\nthe deck during the awe-inspiring scene which I had just witnessed, and\r\nnow I was to be still further amazed by her next act, for Phaidor\r\nextended her hand to me and assisted me to the deck, where I stood\r\ngazing at her in unconcealed and stupefied wonderment.\r\n\r\nA wan smile touched her lips—it was not the cruel and haughty smile of\r\nthe goddess with which I was familiar. “You wonder, John Carter,” she\r\nsaid, “what strange thing has wrought this change in me? I will tell\r\nyou. It is love—love of you,” and when I darkened my brows in\r\ndisapproval of her words she raised an appealing hand.\r\n\r\n“Wait,” she said. “It is a different love from mine—it is the love of\r\nyour princess, Dejah Thoris, for you that has taught me what true love\r\nmay be—what it should be, and how far from real love was my selfish and\r\njealous passion for you.\r\n\r\n“Now I am different. Now could I love as Dejah Thoris loves, and so my\r\nonly happiness can be to know that you and she are once more united,\r\nfor in her alone can you find true happiness.\r\n\r\n“But I am unhappy because of the wickedness that I have wrought. I have\r\nmany sins to expiate, and though I be deathless, life is all too short\r\nfor the atonement.\r\n\r\n“But there is another way, and if Phaidor, daughter of the Holy\r\nHekkador of the Holy Therns, has sinned she has this day already made\r\npartial reparation, and lest you doubt the sincerity of her\r\nprotestations and her avowal of a new love that embraces Dejah Thoris\r\nalso, she will prove her sincerity in the only way that lies\r\nopen—having saved you for another, Phaidor leaves you to her embraces.”\r\n\r\nWith her last word she turned and leaped from the vessel’s deck into\r\nthe abyss below.\r\n\r\nWith a cry of horror I sprang forward in a vain attempt to save the\r\nlife that for two years I would so gladly have seen extinguished. I was\r\ntoo late.\r\n\r\nWith tear-dimmed eyes I turned away that I might not see the awful\r\nsight beneath.\r\n\r\nA moment later I had struck the bonds from Dejah Thoris, and as her\r\ndear arms went about my neck and her perfect lips pressed to mine I\r\nforgot the horrors that I had witnessed and the suffering that I had\r\nendured in the rapture of my reward.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEW RULER\r\n\r\n\r\nThe flier upon whose deck Dejah Thoris and I found ourselves after\r\ntwelve long years of separation proved entirely useless. Her buoyancy\r\ntanks leaked badly. Her engine would not start. We were helpless there\r\nin mid air above the arctic ice.\r\n\r\nThe craft had drifted across the chasm which held the corpses of Matai\r\nShang, Thurid, and Phaidor, and now hung above a low hill. Opening the\r\nbuoyancy escape valves I permitted her to come slowly to the ground,\r\nand as she touched, Dejah Thoris and I stepped from her deck and, hand\r\nin hand, turned back across the frozen waste toward the city of\r\nKadabra.\r\n\r\nThrough the tunnel that had led me in pursuit of them we passed,\r\nwalking slowly, for we had much to say to each other.\r\n\r\nShe told me of that last terrible moment months before when the door of\r\nher prison cell within the Temple of the Sun was slowly closing between\r\nus. Of how Phaidor had sprung upon her with uplifted dagger, and of\r\nThuvia’s shriek as she had realized the foul intention of the thern\r\ngoddess.\r\n\r\nIt had been that cry that had rung in my ears all the long, weary\r\nmonths that I had been left in cruel doubt as to my princess’ fate; for\r\nI had not known that Thuvia had wrested the blade from the daughter of\r\nMatai Shang before it had touched either Dejah Thoris or herself.\r\n\r\nShe told me, too, of the awful eternity of her imprisonment. Of the\r\ncruel hatred of Phaidor, and the tender love of Thuvia, and of how even\r\nwhen despair was the darkest those two red girls had clung to the same\r\nhope and belief—that John Carter would find a way to release them.\r\n\r\nPresently we came to the chamber of Solan. I had been proceeding\r\nwithout thought of caution, for I was sure that the city and the palace\r\nwere both in the hands of my friends by this time.\r\n\r\nAnd so it was that I bolted into the chamber full into the midst of a\r\ndozen nobles of the court of Salensus Oll. They were passing through on\r\ntheir way to the outside world along the corridors we had just\r\ntraversed.\r\n\r\nAt sight of us they halted in their tracks, and then an ugly smile\r\noverspread the features of their leader.\r\n\r\n“The author of all our misfortunes!” he cried, pointing at me. “We\r\nshall have the satisfaction of a partial vengeance at least when we\r\nleave behind us here the dead and mutilated corpses of the Prince and\r\nPrincess of Helium.\r\n\r\n“When they find them,” he went on, jerking his thumb upward toward the\r\npalace above, “they will realize that the vengeance of the yellow man\r\ncosts his enemies dear. Prepare to die, John Carter, but that your end\r\nmay be the more bitter, know that I may change my intention as to\r\nmeting a merciful death to your princess—possibly she shall be\r\npreserved as a plaything for my nobles.”\r\n\r\nI stood close to the instrument-covered wall—Dejah Thoris at my side.\r\nShe looked up at me wonderingly as the warriors advanced upon us with\r\ndrawn swords, for mine still hung within its scabbard at my side, and\r\nthere was a smile upon my lips.\r\n\r\nThe yellow nobles, too, looked in surprise, and then as I made no move\r\nto draw they hesitated, fearing a ruse; but their leader urged them on.\r\nWhen they had come almost within sword’s reach of me I raised my hand\r\nand laid it upon the polished surface of a great lever, and then, still\r\nsmiling grimly, I looked my enemies full in the face.\r\n\r\nAs one they came to a sudden stop, casting affrighted glances at me and\r\nat one another.\r\n\r\n“Stop!” shrieked their leader. “You dream not what you do!”\r\n\r\n“Right you are,” I replied. “John Carter does not dream. He knows—knows\r\nthat should one of you take another step toward Dejah Thoris, Princess\r\nof Helium, I pull this lever wide, and she and I shall die together;\r\nbut we shall not die alone.”\r\n\r\nThe nobles shrank back, whispering together for a few moments. At last\r\ntheir leader turned to me.\r\n\r\n“Go your way, John Carter,” he said, “and we shall go ours.”\r\n\r\n“Prisoners do not go their own way,” I answered, “and you are\r\nprisoners—prisoners of the Prince of Helium.”\r\n\r\nBefore they could make answer a door upon the opposite side of the\r\napartment opened and a score of yellow men poured into the apartment.\r\nFor an instant the nobles looked relieved, and then as their eyes fell\r\nupon the leader of the new party their faces fell, for he was Talu,\r\nrebel Prince of Marentina, and they knew that they could look for\r\nneither aid nor mercy at his hands.\r\n\r\n“Well done, John Carter,” he cried. “You turn their own mighty power\r\nagainst them. Fortunate for Okar is it that you were here to prevent\r\ntheir escape, for these be the greatest villains north of the\r\nice-barrier, and this one”—pointing to the leader of the party—“would\r\nhave made himself Jeddak of Jeddaks in the place of the dead Salensus\r\nOll. Then indeed would we have had a more villainous ruler than the\r\nhated tyrant who fell before your sword.”\r\n\r\nThe Okarian nobles now submitted to arrest, since nothing but death\r\nfaced them should they resist, and, escorted by the warriors of Talu,\r\nwe made our way to the great audience chamber that had been Salensus\r\nOll’s. Here was a vast concourse of warriors.\r\n\r\nRed men from Helium and Ptarth, yellow men of the north, rubbing elbows\r\nwith the blacks of the First Born who had come under my friend Xodar to\r\nhelp in the search for me and my princess. There were savage, green\r\nwarriors from the dead sea bottoms of the south, and a handful of\r\nwhite-skinned therns who had renounced their religion and sworn\r\nallegiance to Xodar.\r\n\r\nThere was Tardos Mors and Mors Kajak, and tall and mighty in his\r\ngorgeous warrior trappings, Carthoris, my son. These three fell upon\r\nDejah Thoris as we entered the apartment, and though the lives and\r\ntraining of royal Martians tend not toward vulgar demonstration, I\r\nthought that they would suffocate her with their embraces.\r\n\r\nAnd there were Tars Tarkas, Jeddak of Thark, and Kantos Kan, my\r\nold-time friends, and leaping and tearing at my harness in the\r\nexuberance of his great love was dear old Woola—frantic mad with\r\nhappiness.\r\n\r\nLong and loud was the cheering that burst forth at sight of us;\r\ndeafening was the din of ringing metal as the veteran warriors of every\r\nMartian clime clashed their blades together on high in token of success\r\nand victory, but as I passed among the throng of saluting nobles and\r\nwarriors, jeds and jeddaks, my heart still was heavy, for there were\r\ntwo faces missing that I would have given much to have seen\r\nthere—Thuvan Dihn and Thuvia of Ptarth were not to be found in the\r\ngreat chamber.\r\n\r\nI made inquiries concerning them among men of every nation, and at last\r\nfrom one of the yellow prisoners of war I learned that they had been\r\napprehended by an officer of the palace as they sought to reach the Pit\r\nof Plenty while I lay imprisoned there.\r\n\r\nI did not need to ask to know what had sent them thither—the courageous\r\njeddak and his loyal daughter. My informer said that they lay now in\r\none of the many buried dungeons of the palace where they had been\r\nplaced pending a decision as to their fate by the tyrant of the north.\r\n\r\nA moment later searching parties were scouring the ancient pile in\r\nsearch of them, and my cup of happiness was full when I saw them being\r\nescorted into the room by a cheering guard of honor.\r\n\r\nThuvia’s first act was to rush to the side of Dejah Thoris, and I\r\nneeded no better proof of the love these two bore for each other than\r\nthe sincerity with which they embraced.\r\n\r\nLooking down upon that crowded chamber stood the silent and empty\r\nthrone of Okar.\r\n\r\nOf all the strange scenes it must have witnessed since that long-dead\r\nage that had first seen a Jeddak of Jeddaks take his seat upon it, none\r\nmight compare with that upon which it now looked down, and as I\r\npondered the past and future of that long-buried race of black-bearded\r\nyellow men I thought that I saw a brighter and more useful existence\r\nfor them among the great family of friendly nations that now stretched\r\nfrom the south pole almost to their very doors.\r\n\r\nTwenty-two years before I had been cast, naked and a stranger, into\r\nthis strange and savage world. The hand of every race and nation was\r\nraised in continual strife and warring against the men of every other\r\nland and color. Today, by the might of my sword and the loyalty of the\r\nfriends my sword had made for me, black man and white, red man and\r\ngreen rubbed shoulders in peace and good-fellowship. All the nations of\r\nBarsoom were not yet as one, but a great stride forward toward that\r\ngoal had been taken, and now if I could but cement the fierce yellow\r\nrace into this solidarity of nations I should feel that I had rounded\r\nout a great lifework, and repaid to Mars at least a portion of the\r\nimmense debt of gratitude I owed her for having given me my Dejah\r\nThoris.\r\n\r\nAnd as I thought, I saw but one way, and a single man who could insure\r\nthe success of my hopes. As is ever the way with me, I acted then as I\r\nalways act—without deliberation and without consultation.\r\n\r\nThose who do not like my plans and my ways of promoting them have\r\nalways their swords at their sides wherewith to back up their\r\ndisapproval; but now there seemed to be no dissenting voice, as,\r\ngrasping Talu by the arm, I sprang to the throne that had once been\r\nSalensus Oll’s.\r\n\r\n“Warriors of Barsoom,” I cried, “Kadabra has fallen, and with her the\r\nhateful tyrant of the north; but the integrity of Okar must be\r\npreserved. The red men are ruled by red jeddaks, the green warriors of\r\nthe ancient seas acknowledge none but a green ruler, the First Born of\r\nthe south pole take their law from black Xodar; nor would it be to the\r\ninterests of either yellow or red man were a red jeddak to sit upon the\r\nthrone of Okar.\r\n\r\n“There be but one warrior best fitted for the ancient and mighty title\r\nof Jeddak of Jeddaks of the North. Men of Okar, raise your swords to\r\nyour new ruler—Talu, the rebel prince of Marentina!”\r\n\r\nAnd then a great cry of rejoicing rose among the free men of Marentina\r\nand the Kadabran prisoners, for all had thought that the red men would\r\nretain that which they had taken by force of arms, for such had been\r\nthe way upon Barsoom, and that they should be ruled henceforth by an\r\nalien Jeddak.\r\n\r\nThe victorious warriors who had followed Carthoris joined in the mad\r\ndemonstration, and amidst the wild confusion and the tumult and the\r\ncheering, Dejah Thoris and I passed out into the gorgeous garden of the\r\njeddaks that graces the inner courtyard of the palace of Kadabra.\r\n\r\nAt our heels walked Woola, and upon a carved seat of wondrous beauty\r\nbeneath a bower of purple blooms we saw two who had preceded us—Thuvia\r\nof Ptarth and Carthoris of Helium.\r\n\r\nThe handsome head of the handsome youth was bent low above the\r\nbeautiful face of his companion. I looked at Dejah Thoris, smiling, and\r\nas I drew her close to me I whispered: “Why not?”\r\n\r\nIndeed, why not? What matter ages in this world of perpetual youth?\r\n\r\nWe remained at Kadabra, the guests of Talu, until after his formal\r\ninduction into office, and then, upon the great fleet which I had been\r\nso fortunate to preserve from destruction, we sailed south across the\r\nice-barrier; but not before we had witnessed the total demolition of\r\nthe grim Guardian of the North under orders of the new Jeddak of\r\nJeddaks.\r\n\r\n“Henceforth,” he said, as the work was completed, “the fleets of the\r\nred men and the black are free to come and go across the ice-barrier as\r\nover their own lands.\r\n\r\n“The Carrion Caves shall be cleansed, that the green men may find an\r\neasy way to the land of the yellow, and the hunting of the sacred apt\r\nshall be the sport of my nobles until no single specimen of that\r\nhideous creature roams the frozen north.”\r\n\r\nWe bade our yellow friends farewell with real regret, as we set sail\r\nfor Ptarth. There we remained, the guest of Thuvan Dihn, for a month;\r\nand I could see that Carthoris would have remained forever had he not\r\nbeen a Prince of Helium.\r\n\r\nAbove the mighty forests of Kaol we hovered until word from Kulan Tith\r\nbrought us to his single landing-tower, where all day and half a night\r\nthe vessels disembarked their crews. At the city of Kaol we visited,\r\ncementing the new ties that had been formed between Kaol and Helium,\r\nand then one long-to-be-remembered day we sighted the tall, thin towers\r\nof the twin cities of Helium.\r\n\r\nThe people had long been preparing for our coming. The sky was gorgeous\r\nwith gaily trimmed fliers. Every roof within both cities was spread\r\nwith costly silks and tapestries.\r\n\r\nGold and jewels were scattered over roof and street and plaza, so that\r\nthe two cities seemed ablaze with the fires of the hearts of the\r\nmagnificent stones and burnished metal that reflected the brilliant\r\nsunlight, changing it into countless glorious hues.\r\n\r\nAt last, after twelve years, the royal family of Helium was reunited in\r\ntheir own mighty city, surrounded by joy-mad millions before the palace\r\ngates. Women and children and mighty warriors wept in gratitude for the\r\nfate that had restored their beloved Tardos Mors and the divine\r\nprincess whom the whole nation idolized. Nor did any of us who had been\r\nupon that expedition of indescribable danger and glory lack for\r\nplaudits.\r\n\r\nThat night a messenger came to me as I sat with Dejah Thoris and\r\nCarthoris upon the roof of my city palace, where we had long since\r\ncaused a lovely garden to be made that we three might find seclusion\r\nand quiet happiness among ourselves, far from the pomp and ceremony of\r\ncourt, to summon us to the Temple of Reward—“where one is to be judged\r\nthis night,” the summons concluded.\r\n\r\nI racked my brain to try and determine what important case there might\r\nbe pending which could call the royal family from their palaces on the\r\neve of their return to Helium after years of absence; but when the\r\njeddak summons no man delays.\r\n\r\nAs our flier touched the landing stage at the temple’s top we saw\r\ncountless other craft arriving and departing. In the streets below a\r\ngreat multitude surged toward the great gates of the temple.\r\n\r\nSlowly there came to me the recollection of the deferred doom that\r\nawaited me since that time I had been tried here in the Temple by Zat\r\nArras for the sin of returning from the Valley Dor and the Lost Sea of\r\nKorus.\r\n\r\nCould it be possible that the strict sense of justice which dominates\r\nthe men of Mars had caused them to overlook the great good that had\r\ncome out of my heresy? Could they ignore the fact that to me, and me\r\nalone, was due the rescue of Carthoris, of Dejah Thoris, of Mors Kajak,\r\nof Tardos Mors?\r\n\r\nI could not believe it, and yet for what other purpose could I have\r\nbeen summoned to the Temple of Reward immediately upon the return of\r\nTardos Mors to his throne?\r\n\r\nMy first surprise as I entered the temple and approached the Throne of\r\nRighteousness was to note the men who sat there as judges. There was\r\nKulan Tith, Jeddak of Kaol, whom we had but just left within his own\r\npalace a few days since; there was Thuvan Dihn, Jeddak of Ptarth—how\r\ncame he to Helium as soon as we?\r\n\r\nThere was Tars Tarkas, Jeddak of Thark, and Xodar, Jeddak of the First\r\nBorn; there was Talu, Jeddak of Jeddaks of the North, whom I could have\r\nsworn was still in his ice-bound hothouse city beyond the northern\r\nbarrier, and among them sat Tardos Mors and Mors Kajak, with enough\r\nlesser jeds and jeddaks to make up the thirty-one who must sit in\r\njudgment upon their fellow-man.\r\n\r\nA right royal tribunal indeed, and such a one, I warrant, as never\r\nbefore sat together during all the history of ancient Mars.\r\n\r\nAs I entered, silence fell upon the great concourse of people that\r\npacked the auditorium. Then Tardos Mors arose.\r\n\r\n“John Carter,” he said in his deep, martial voice, “take your place\r\nupon the Pedestal of Truth, for you are to be tried by a fair and\r\nimpartial tribunal of your fellow-men.”\r\n\r\nWith level eye and high-held head I did as he bade, and as I glanced\r\nabout that circle of faces that a moment before I could have sworn\r\ncontained the best friends I had upon Barsoom, I saw no single friendly\r\nglance—only stern, uncompromising judges, there to do their duty.\r\n\r\nA clerk rose and from a great book read a long list of the more notable\r\ndeeds that I had thought to my credit, covering a long period of\r\ntwenty-two years since first I had stepped the ocher sea bottom beside\r\nthe incubator of the Tharks. With the others he read of all that I had\r\ndone within the circle of the Otz Mountains where the Holy Therns and\r\nthe First Born had held sway.\r\n\r\nIt is the way upon Barsoom to recite a man’s virtues with his sins when\r\nhe is come to trial, and so I was not surprised that all that was to my\r\ncredit should be read there to my judges—who knew it all by heart—even\r\ndown to the present moment. When the reading had ceased Tardos Mors\r\narose.\r\n\r\n“Most righteous judges,” he exclaimed, “you have heard recited all that\r\nis known of John Carter, Prince of Helium—the good with the bad. What\r\nis your judgment?”\r\n\r\nThen Tars Tarkas came slowly to his feet, unfolding all his mighty,\r\ntowering height until he loomed, a green-bronze statue, far above us\r\nall. He turned a baleful eye upon me—he, Tars Tarkas, with whom I had\r\nfought through countless battles; whom I loved as a brother.\r\n\r\nI could have wept had I not been so mad with rage that I almost whipped\r\nmy sword out and had at them all upon the spot.\r\n\r\n“Judges,” he said, “there can be but one verdict. No longer may John\r\nCarter be Prince of Helium”—he paused—“but instead let him be Jeddak of\r\nJeddaks, Warlord of Barsoom!”\r\n\r\nAs the thirty-one judges sprang to their feet with drawn and upraised\r\nswords in unanimous concurrence in the verdict, the storm broke\r\nthroughout the length and breadth and height of that mighty building\r\nuntil I thought the roof would fall from the thunder of the mad\r\nshouting.\r\n\r\nNow, at last, I saw the grim humor of the method they had adopted to do\r\nme this great honor, but that there was any hoax in the reality of the\r\ntitle they had conferred upon me was readily disproved by the sincerity\r\nof the congratulations that were heaped upon me by the judges first and\r\nthen the nobles.\r\n\r\nPresently fifty of the mightiest nobles of the greatest courts of Mars\r\nmarched down the broad Aisle of Hope bearing a splendid car upon their\r\nshoulders, and as the people saw who sat within, the cheers that had\r\nrung out for me paled into insignificance beside those which thundered\r\nthrough the vast edifice now, for she whom the nobles carried was Dejah\r\nThoris, beloved Princess of Helium.\r\n\r\nStraight to the Throne of Righteousness they bore her, and there Tardos\r\nMors assisted her from the car, leading her forward to my side.\r\n\r\n“Let a world’s most beautiful woman share the honor of her husband,” he\r\nsaid.\r\n\r\nBefore them all I drew my wife close to me and kissed her upon the\r\nlips.",
