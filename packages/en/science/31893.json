And yet, there is, or should be, a report somewhere in\r\nthe musty archives of the Service, covering the incident.\r\n\r\nNot accurately, and not in detail. Among a great mass of old records\r\nwhich I was browsing through the other day, I happened across that\r\nreport; it occupied exactly three lines in the log-book of the\r\n_Ertak_:\r\n\r\n     \"Just before departure, discovered stowaway, apparently\r\n      demented, and ejected him.\"\r\n\r\nFor the hard-headed higher-ups of the Service, that was report enough.\r\nHad I given the facts, they would have called me to the Base for a\r\nlong-winded investigation. It would have taken weeks and weeks, filled\r\nwith fussy questioning. Dozens of stoop-shouldered laboratory men\r\nwould have prodded and snooped and asked for long, written accounts.\r\nIn those days, keeping the log-book was writing enough for me and\r\nbeing grounded at Base for weeks would have been punishment.\r\n\r\nNothing would have been gained by a detailed report. The Service\r\nneeded action rather than reports, anyway. But now that I am an old\r\nman, on the retired list, I have time to write; and it will be a\r\nparticular pleasure to write this account, for it will go to prove\r\nthat these much-honored scientists of ours, with all their tremendous\r\nappropriations and long-winded discussions, are not nearly so\r\nwonderful as they think they are. They are, and always have been, too\r\nmuch interested in abstract formulas, and not enough in their\r\npractical application. I have never had a great deal of use for them.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI had received orders to report to Earth, regarding a dull routine\r\nmatter of reorganizing the emergency Base which had been established\r\nthere. Earth, I might add, for the benefit of those of you who have\r\nforgotten your geography of the Universe, is not a large body, but its\r\npeople furnish almost all of the officer personnel of the Special\r\nPatrol Service. Being a native of Earth, I received the assignment\r\nwith considerable pleasure, despite its dry and uninteresting nature.\r\n\r\nIt was a good sight to see old Earth, bundled up in her cottony\r\nclouds, growing larger and larger in the television disc. No matter\r\nhow much you wander around the Universe, no matter how small and\r\ninsignificant the world of your birth, there is a tie that cannot be\r\ndenied. I have set my ships down upon many a strange and unknown\r\nworld, with danger and adventure awaiting me, but there is, for me, no\r\nthrill which quite duplicates that of viewing again that particular\r\nlittle ball of mud from whence I sprang. I've said that before; I\r\nshall probably say it again. I am proud to claim Earth as my\r\nbirth-place, small and out-of-the way as she is.\r\n\r\nOur Base on Earth was adjacent to the city of Greater Denver, on the\r\nPacific Coast. I could not help wondering, as we settled swiftly over\r\nthe city, whether our historians and geologists and other scientists\r\nwere really right in saying that Denver had at one period been far\r\nfrom the Pacific. It seemed impossible, as I gazed down on that blue,\r\ntranquil sea, that it had engulfed, hundreds of years ago, such a vast\r\nportion of North America. But I suppose the men of science know.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI need not go into the routine business that brought me to Earth.\r\nSuffice it to say that it was settled quickly, by the afternoon of the\r\nsecond day: I am referring, of course, to Earth days, which are\r\nslightly less than half the length of an enaren of Universe time.\r\n\r\nA number of my friends had come to meet me, visit with me during my\r\nbrief stay on Earth; and, having finished my business with such\r\ndispatch, I decided to spend that evening with them, and leave the\r\nfollowing morning. It was very late when my friends departed, and I\r\nstrolled out with them to their mono-car, returning the salute of the\r\n_Ertak's_ lone sentry, who was pacing his post before the huge\r\ncircular exit of the ship.\r\n\r\nBidding my friends farewell, I stood there for a moment under the\r\nheavens, brilliant with blue, cold stars, and watched the car sweep\r\nswiftly and soundlessly away towards the towering mass of the city.\r\nThen, with a little sigh, I turned back to the ship.\r\n\r\nThe _Ertak_ lay lightly upon the earth, her polished sides gleaming in\r\nthe light of the crescent moon. In the side toward me, the circular\r\nentrance gaped like a sleepy mouth; the sentry, knowing the eyes of\r\nhis commander were upon him, strode back and forth with brisk,\r\nmilitary precision. Slowly, still thinking of my friends, I made my\r\nway toward the ship.\r\n\r\nI had taken but a few steps when the sentry's challenge rang out\r\nsharply, \"Halt! Who goes there?\"\r\n\r\nI glanced up in surprise. Shiro, the man on guard, had seen me leave,\r\nand he could have had no difficulty in recognizing me. But--the\r\nchallenge had not been meant for me.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBetween myself and the _Ertak_ there stood a strange figure. An\r\ninstant before, I would have sworn that there was no human in sight,\r\nsave myself and the sentry; now this man stood not twenty feet away,\r\nswaying as though ill or terribly weary, barely able to lift his head\r\nand turn it toward the sentry.\r\n\r\n\"Friend,\" he gasped; \"friend!\" and I think he would have fallen to the\r\nground if I had not clapped an arm around his shoulders and supported\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\"Just ... a moment,\" whispered the stranger. \"I'm a bit faint.... I'll\r\nbe all right....\"\r\n\r\nI stared down at the man, unable to reply. This was a nightmare; no\r\nless. I could feel the sentry staring, too.\r\n\r\nThe man was dressed in a style so ancient that I could not remember\r\nthe period: Twenty-first Century, at least; perhaps earlier. And while\r\nhe spoke English, which is a language of Earth, he spoke it with a\r\nharsh and unpleasant accent that made his words difficult, almost\r\nimpossible, to understand. Their meaning did not fully sink in until\r\nan instant after he had finished speaking.\r\n\r\n\"Shiro!\" I said sharply. \"Help me take this man inside. He's ill.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir!\" The guard leaped to obey the order, and together we led\r\nhim into the _Ertak_, and to my own stateroom. There was some mystery\r\nhere, and I was eager to get at the root of it. The man with the\r\nancient costume and the strange accent had not come to the spot where\r\nwe had seen him by any means with which I was familiar; he had\r\nmaterialized out of the thin air. There was no other way to account\r\nfor his presence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe propped the stranger in my most comfortable chair, and I turned to\r\nthe sentry. He was staring at our weird visitor with wondering,\r\nfearful eyes, and when I spoke he started as though stung by an\r\nelectric shock.\r\n\r\n\"Very well,\" I said briskly. \"That will be all. Resume your post\r\nimmediately. And--Shiro!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir?\"\r\n\r\n\"It will not be necessary for you to make a report of this incident. I\r\nwill attend to that. Understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir!\" And I think it is to the man's everlasting credit, and to\r\nthe credit of the Service which had trained him, that he executed a\r\nsnappy salute, did an about-face, and left the room without another\r\nglance at the man slumped down in my big easy chair.\r\n\r\nWith a feeling of cold, nervous apprehension such as I have seldom\r\nexperienced in a rather varied and active life, I turned then to my\r\nvisitor.\r\n\r\nHe had not moved, save to lift his head. He was staring at me, his\r\neyes fixed in his chalky white face. They were dark, long\r\neyes--abnormally long--and they glittered with a strange, uncanny\r\nlight.\r\n\r\n\"You are feeling better?\" I asked.\r\n\r\nHis thin, bloodless lips moved, but for a moment no sound came from\r\nthem. He tried again.\r\n\r\n\"Water,\" he said.\r\n\r\nI drew him a glass from the tank in the wall of my room. He downed it\r\nat a gulp, and passed the empty glass back to me.\r\n\r\n\"More,\" he whispered. He drank the second glass more slowly, his eyes\r\ndarting swiftly, curiously, around the room. Then his brilliant,\r\npiercing glance fell upon my face.\r\n\r\n\"Tell me,\" he commanded sharply, \"what year is this?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI stared at him. It occurred to me that my friends might have\r\nconceived and executed an elaborate hoax--and then I dismissed the\r\nidea, instantly. There were no scientists among them who could make a\r\nman materialize out of nothingness.\r\n\r\n\"Are you in your right mind?\" I asked slowly. \"Your question strikes\r\nme as damnably odd, sir.\"\r\n\r\nThe man laughed wildly, and slowly straightened up in the chair. His\r\nlong, bony fingers clasped and unclasped slowly, as though feeling\r\nwere just returning to them.\r\n\r\n\"Your question,\" he replied in his odd, unfamiliar accent, \"is not\r\nunnatural, under the circumstances. I assure you that I am of sound\r\nmind; of very sound mind.\" He smiled, rather a ghastly smile, and made\r\na vague, slight gesture with one hand. \"Will you be good enough to\r\nanswer my question? What year is this?\"\r\n\r\n\"Earth year, you mean?\"\r\n\r\nHe stared at me, his eyes flickering.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he said. \"Earth year. There are other ways of ... figuring time\r\nnow?\"\r\n\r\n\"Certainly. Each inhabited world has its own system. There is a master\r\nsystem for the Universe. Who are you, what are you, that you should\r\nask me a question the smallest child should know?\"\r\n\r\n\"First,\" he insisted, \"tell me what year this is, Earth reckoning.\"\r\n\r\nI told him, and the light flickered up in his eyes again--a cruel,\r\ntriumphant light.\r\n\r\n\"Thank you,\" he nodded; and then, slowly and softly, as though he\r\nspoke to himself, he added, \"Less than half a century off. Less than a\r\nhalf a century! And they laughed at me. How--how I shall laugh at\r\nthem, presently!\"\r\n\r\n\"You choose to be mysterious, sir?\" I asked impatiently.\r\n\r\n\"No. Presently you shall understand, and then you will forgive me, I\r\nknow. I have come through an experience such as no man has ever known\r\nbefore. If I am shaken, weak, surprising to you, it is because of that\r\nexperience.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe paused for a moment, his long, powerful fingers gripping the arms\r\nof the chair.\r\n\r\n\"You see,\" he added, \"I have come out of the past into the present. Or\r\nfrom the present into the future. It depends upon one's viewpoint. If\r\nI am distraught, then forgive me. A few minutes ago, I was Jacob\r\nHarbauer, in a little laboratory on the edge of a mountain park, near\r\nDenver; now I am a nameless being hurtled into the future, pausing\r\nhere, many centuries from my own era. Do you wonder now that I am\r\nunnerved?\"\r\n\r\n\"Do you mean,\" I said slowly, trying to understand what he had babbled\r\nforth, \"that you have come out of the past? That you ... that you....\"\r\nIt was too monstrous to put into words.\r\n\r\n\"I mean,\" he replied, \"that I was born in the year 2028. I am\r\nforty-three years old--or I was a few minutes ago. But,\"--and his eyes\r\nflickered again with that strange, mad light--\"I am a scientist! I\r\nhave left my age behind me for a time; I have done what no other human\r\nbeing has ever done: I have gone centuries into the future!\"\r\n\r\n\"I--I do not understand.\" Could he, after all, be a madman? \"How can\r\na man leave his own age and travel ahead to another?\"\r\n\r\n\"Even in this age of yours they have not discovered that secret?\"\r\nHarbauer exulted. \"You travel the Universe, I gather, and yet your\r\nscientists have not yet learned to move in time? Listen! Let me\r\nexplain to you how simple the theory is.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"I take it you are an intelligent man; your uniform and its insignia\r\nwould seem to indicate a degree of rank. Am I correct?\"\r\n\r\n\"I am John Hanson, Commander of the _Ertak_, of the Special Patrol\r\nService,\" I informed him.\r\n\r\n\"Then you will be capable of grasping, in part at least, what I have\r\nto tell you. It is really not so complex. Time is a river, flowing\r\nsteadily, powerful, at a fixed rate of speed. It sweeps the whole\r\nUniverse along on its bosom at that same speed. That is my conception\r\nof it; is it clear to you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I should think,\" I replied, \"that the Universe is more like a great\r\nrock in the middle of your stream of time, that stands motionless\r\nwhile the minutes, the hours, and the days roll by.\"\r\n\r\n\"No! The Universe travels on the breast of the current of time. It\r\nleaves yesterday behind, and sweeps on towards to-morrow. It has\r\nalways been so until I challenged this so-called immutable law. I said\r\nto myself, why should a man be a helpless stick upon the stream of\r\ntime? Why need he be borne on this slow current at the same speed? Why\r\ncannot he do as a man in a boat, paddle backwards or forwards; back to\r\na point already passed; ahead, faster than the current, to a point\r\nthat, drifting, he would not reach so soon? In other words, why can he\r\nnot slip back through time to yesterday; or ahead to to-morrow? And if\r\nto to-morrow, why not to next year, next century?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"These are the questions I asked myself. Other men have asked\r\nthemselves the same questions, I know; they were not new.\r\nBut,\"--Harbauer drew himself far forward in his chair, and leaned\r\nclose to me, almost as though he prepared himself to spring--\"no other\r\nman ever found the answer! That remained for me.\r\n\r\n\"I was not entirely correct, of course. I found that one could not go\r\nback in time. The current was against one. But to go ahead, with the\r\ncurrent at one's back, was different. I spent six years on the\r\nproblem, working day and night, handicapped by lack of funds,\r\nridiculed by the press--Look!\"\r\n\r\nHarbauer reached inside his antiquated costume and drew forth a flat\r\npacket which he passed to me. I unfolded it curiously, my fingers\r\nclumsy with excitement.\r\n\r\nI could hardly believe my eyes. The thing Harbauer had handed me was a\r\nfolded fragment of newspaper, such as I had often seen in museums. I\r\nrecognized the old-fashioned type, and the peculiar arrangement of the\r\ncolumns. But, instead of being yellow and brittle with age, and\r\npreserved in fragments behind sealed glass, this paper was fresh and\r\nwhite, and the ink was as black as the day it had been printed. What\r\nthis man said, then, must be true! He must--\r\n\r\n\"I can understand your amazement,\" said Harbauer. \"It had not occurred\r\nto me that a paper which, to me, was printed only yesterday, would\r\nseem so antique to you. But that must appear as remarkable to you as\r\nfresh papyrus, newly inscribed with the hieroglyphics of the ancient\r\nEgyptians, would seem to one of my own day and age. But read it; you\r\nwill see how my world viewed my efforts!\" There was a sharpness, a\r\nbitterness, in his voice that made me vaguely uneasy; even though he\r\nhad solved the riddle of moving in time as men have always moved in\r\nspace, my first conjecture that I had a madman to deal with might not\r\nbe so far from the truth. Ridicule and persecution have unseated the\r\nreason of all too many men.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe type was unfamiliar to me, and the spelling was archaic, but I\r\nmanaged to stumble through the article. It read, as nearly as I can\r\nrecall it, like this:\r\n\r\n                       Harbauer Says Time\r\n\r\n                       Is Like Great River\r\n\r\n     Jacob Harbauer, local inventor, in an exclusive interview,\r\n     propounds the theory that man can move about in time exactly\r\n     as a boat moves about on the surface of a swift-flowing\r\n     river, save that he cannot go back into time, on account of\r\n     the opposition of the current.\r\n\r\n     That is very fortunate, this writer feels; it would be a\r\n     terrible thing for example, if some good-looking scamp from\r\n     our present Twenty-first Century were to dive into the past\r\n     and steal Cleopatra from Antony, or start an affair with\r\n     Josephine and send Napoleon scurrying back from the front\r\n     and let the Napoleonic wars go to pot. We'd have to have all\r\n     our histories rewritten!\r\n\r\n     Harbauer is well-known in Denver as the eccentric inventor\r\n     who, for the last five or six years, has occupied a lonely\r\n     shack in the mountains, guarded by a high fence of barbed\r\n     wire. He claims that he has now perfected equipment which\r\n     will enable him to project himself forward in time, and\r\n     expects to make the experiment in the very near future.\r\n\r\n     This writer was permitted to view the equipment which\r\n     Harbauer says will shoot him into the future. The apparatus\r\n     is housed in a low, barn-like building in the rear of his\r\n     shack.\r\n\r\n     Along one side of the room is a veritable bank of electrical\r\n     apparatus with innumerable controls, many huge tubes of\r\n     unfamiliar shape and appearance, a mighty generator of some\r\n     kind and an intricate maze of gleaming copper bus-bar.\r\n\r\n     In the center of the room is a circle of metal, about a foot\r\n     in thickness, insulated from the flooring by four truncated\r\n     cones of fluted glass. This disc is composed of two\r\n     unfamiliar metals, arranged in concentric circles.\r\n\r\n     Above this disc, at a height of about eight feet, is\r\n     suspended a sort of grid, composed of extremely fine silvery\r\n     wires, supported on a frame-work of black insulating\r\n     material.\r\n\r\n     Asked for a demonstration of his apparatus, Harbauer finally\r\n     consented to perform an experiment with a dog--a white,\r\n     short-haired mongrel that, Harbauer informed us, he kept to\r\n     warn him of approaching strangers.\r\n\r\n     He bound the dog's legs together securely, and placed the\r\n     struggling animal in the center of the heavy metal disc.\r\n     Then the inventor hurried to the central control panel and\r\n     manipulated several switches, which caused a number of\r\n     things to happen almost at once.\r\n\r\n     The big generator started with a growl, and settled\r\n     immediately into a deep hum; a whole row of tubes glowed\r\n     with a purplish brilliancy. There was a crackling sound in\r\n     the air, and the grid above the disc seemed to become\r\n     incandescent, although it gave forth no apparent heat. From\r\n     the rim of the metal disc, thin blue streamers of electric\r\n     flame shot up toward the grid, and the little white dog\r\n     began to whine nervously.\r\n\r\n     \"Now watch!\" shouted Harbauer. He closed another switch,\r\n     and the space between the disc and the grid became a\r\n     cylinder of livid light, for a period of perhaps two\r\n     seconds. Then Harbauer pulled all the switches, and pointed\r\n     triumphantly to the disc. It was empty.\r\n\r\n     We looked around the room for the dog, but he was not\r\n     visible anywhere.\r\n\r\n     \"I have sent him nearly a century into the future,\" said\r\n     Harbauer. \"We will let him stay there a moment, and then\r\n     bring him back.\"\r\n\r\n     \"You mean to say,\" we asked, \"that the pup is now roaming\r\n     around somewhere in the Twenty-second Century?\" Harbauer\r\n     said he meant just that, and added that he would now bring\r\n     the dog back to the present time. The switches were closed\r\n     again, but this time it was the metal plate that seemed\r\n     incandescent, and the grid above that shot out the streaks\r\n     of thin blue flame. As he closed the last switch, the\r\n     cylinder of light appeared again, and when the switches were\r\n     opened, there was the dog in the center of the disc, howling\r\n     and struggling against his bonds.\r\n\r\n     \"Look!\" cried Harbauer. \"He's been attacked by another dog,\r\n     or some other animal, while in the future. See the blood on\r\n     his shoulders?\"\r\n\r\n     We ventured the humble opinion that the dog had scratched or\r\n     bit himself in struggling to free himself from the cords\r\n     with which Harbauer had bound him, and the inventor flew\r\n     into a terrible rage, cursing and waving his arms as though\r\n     demented. Feeling that discretion was the better part of\r\n     valor, we beat a hasty retreat, pausing at the barbed-wire\r\n     gate only long enough to ask Mr. Harbauer if he would be\r\n     good enough, sometime when he had a few minutes of leisure,\r\n     to dash into next week and bring back some stock market\r\n     reports to aid us in our investment efforts.\r\n\r\n     Under the circumstances, we did not wait for a response, but\r\n     we presume we are persona non grata at the Harbauer\r\n     establishment from this time on.\r\n\r\n     All in all, we are not sorry.\r\n\r\nI folded the paper and passed it back to him; some of the allusions I\r\ndid not understand, but the general tone of the article was very clear\r\nindeed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"You see?\" said Harbauer, his voice grating with anger. \"I tried to be\r\ncourteous to that man; to give him a simple, convincing demonstration\r\nof the greatest scientific achievement in centuries. And the fool\r\nreturned to write _this_: to hold me up to ridicule, to paint me as a\r\ncrack-brained, wild-eyed fanatic.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's hard for the layman to conceive of a great scientific\r\nachievement,\" I said soothingly. \"All great inventions and inventors\r\nhave been laughed at by the populace at large.\"\r\n\r\n\"True. True.\" Harbauer nodded his head solemnly. \"But just the same--\"\r\nHe broke off suddenly, and forced a smile. I found myself wishing that\r\nhe had completed that broken sentence, however; I felt that he had\r\nalmost revealed something that would have been most enlightening.\r\n\r\n\"But enough of that fool and his babblings,\" he continued. \"I am here\r\nas living proof that my experiment is a success, and I have a\r\ntremendous curiosity about the world in which I find myself. This, I\r\ntake it, is a ship for navigating space?\"\r\n\r\n\"Right! The _Ertak_, of the Special Patrol Service. Would you care to\r\nlook around a bit?\"\r\n\r\n\"I would, indeed.\" There was a tremendous eagerness in the man's\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\"You're not too tired?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; I am quite recovered from my experience.\" Harbauer leaped to his\r\nfeet, those abnormally long, slitted eyes of his glowing. \"I am a\r\nscientist, and I am most curious to see what my fellows have created\r\nsince--since my own era.\"\r\n\r\nI picked up my dressing gown and tossed it to him.\r\n\r\n\"Slip this on, then, to cover your clothing. You would be an object of\r\ntoo much curiosity to those men who are on duty,\" I suggested.\r\n\r\nI was taller than he, and the garment came within a few inches of the\r\nfloor. He knotted the cincture around his middle and thrust his hands\r\ninto the pockets, turning to me for approval. I nodded, and motioned\r\nfor him to precede me through the door.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs an officer of the Special Patrol Service, it has often been my duty\r\nto show parties and individuals through my ship. Most of these parties\r\nare composed of females, who have only exclamations to make instead of\r\nintelligent comment, and who possess an unbounded capacity for asking\r\nutterly asinine questions. It was, therefore, a real pleasure to show\r\nHarbauer through the ship.\r\n\r\nHe was a keen, eager listener. When he asked a question, and he asked\r\nmany of them, he showed an amazing grasp of the principles involved.\r\nMy knowledge of our equipment was, of course, only practical, save for\r\nthe rudimentary theoretical knowledge that everyone has of present-day\r\ninventions and devices.\r\n\r\nThe ethon tubes which lighted the ship, interested him but little. The\r\natomic generators, the gravity pads, their generators, and the\r\ndisintegrator-ray, however, he delved into with that frenzied ardor of\r\nwhich only a scientist, I believe, is capable.\r\n\r\nQuestions poured out of him, and I answered them as best I could:\r\nsometimes completely, and satisfactorily, so that he nodded and said,\r\n\"I see! I see!\" and sometimes so poorly that he frowned, and\r\ncross-questioned me insistently until he obtained the desired\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\nIn the big, sound-proof navigating room, I explained the operation of\r\nthe numerous instruments, including the two three-dimensional charts,\r\nactuated by super-radio reflexes, the television disc, the attraction\r\nmeter, the surface-temperature gauge and the complex control system.\r\n\r\n\"Forward,\" I added, \"is the operating room. You can see it through\r\nthese glass partitions. The navigating officer in command relays his\r\norders to men in the operating room, who attend to the actual\r\nexecution of those orders.\"\r\n\r\n\"Just as a pilot, or the navigating officer of a ship of my day gives\r\nhis orders to the quartermaster at the wheel,\" nodded Harbauer, and\r\nbegan firing questions at me again, going over the ground we had\r\ncovered, to check up on his information. I was amazed at the uncanny\r\naccuracy with which he had grasped such a great mass of technical\r\ndetail. It had taken me years of study to pick up what he had taken\r\nfrom me, and apparently retained intact, in something more than an\r\nhour, Earth time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI glanced at the Earth-time clock on the wall of the navigating room\r\nas he triumphantly finished his questioning. Less than an hour\r\nremained before the time set for our return trip.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sorry,\" I commented, \"to be an ungracious host, but I am\r\nwondering what your plans may be? You see, we are due to start in less\r\nthan an hour, and--\"\r\n\r\n\"A passenger would be in your way?\" Harbauer smiled as he uttered the\r\nwords, but there was a gleam in his long eyes that rather startled me,\r\nand I wondered if I only imagined the steeliness of his voice. \"Don't\r\nlet that worry you, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's not worrying me,\" I replied, watching him closely. \"I have\r\nenjoyed a very remarkable, a very pleasant experience. If you should\r\ncare to remain aboard the _Ertak_, I should like exceedingly to have\r\nyou accompany us to our Base, where I could place you in touch with\r\nother laboratory men, with whom you would have much in common.\"\r\n\r\nHarbauer threw back his head and laughed--not pleasantly.\r\n\r\n\"Thanks!\" he said. \"But I have no time for that. They could give me no\r\nknowledge that I need, now; you have told me and showed me enough. I\r\nunderstand how you have released atomic energy; it is a matter so\r\nsimple that a child should have guessed it, and man has wondered about\r\nit for centuries, knowing that the power was there, but lacking a key\r\nto unfetter it. And now I have that key!\"\r\n\r\n\"True. But perhaps our scientists would like, in exchange, the secret\r\nof moving forward in time,\" I suggested, reasonably enough.\r\n\r\n\"What do I care about them?\" snapped Harbauer. He loosened the cord of\r\nthe robe with a quick, impatient gesture, as though it confined him\r\ntoo tightly, and threw the garment from him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen, suddenly, he took a quick stride toward me, and thrust out his\r\nugly head.\r\n\r\n\"I know enough now to give me power over all my world,\" he cried.\r\n\"Haven't you guessed the reason for my interest in your engines of\r\ndestruction? I came down the centuries ahead of my generation so that\r\nI might come back with power in my hand; power to wipe out the fools\r\nwho have made a mock of me. And I have that power--here!\" He tapped\r\nhis forehead dramatically with his left hand.\r\n\r\n\"I will bring a new regime to my era!\" he continued, fairly shouting\r\nnow. \"I will be what many men have tried to be, and what no man has\r\never been--master of the world! Absolute, unquestioned, supreme\r\nmaster!\" He paused, his eyes glaring into mine--and I knew from the\r\nlight that shone behind those long, narrow slits, that I was dealing\r\nwith a madman.\r\n\r\n\"True; you will,\" I said gently, moving carelessly toward the\r\nmicrophone. With that in my hand, a slight pressure on the General\r\nAttention signal, and I would have the whole crew of the _Ertak_ here\r\nin a moment. But I had explained the workings of the navigating room's\r\nequipment only too well.\r\n\r\n\"Stop!\" snarled Harbauer, and his right hand flashed up. \"See this?\r\nPerhaps you don't know what it is; I'll tell you. It's an automatic\r\npistol--not so efficient as your disintegrator-ray, but deadly enough.\r\nThere is certain death for eight men in my hand. Understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Perfectly.\" What an utter fool I had been! I was not armed, and I\r\nknew that Harbauer spoke the truth. I had often seen weapons similar\r\nto the one he held in the military museums. They are still there, if\r\nyou are curious--rusty and broken, but not unlike our present atomic\r\npistols in general appearance. They propelled the bullet by the\r\nexplosion of a sort of powder; inefficient, of course, but, as he had\r\nsaid, deadly enough for the purpose.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Good! You are a good sort Hanson, but don't take any chances. I'm not\r\ngoing to, I promise you. You see,\"--and he laughed again, the light in\r\nhis long eyes dancing with evil--\"I'm not likely to be punished for a\r\nfew killings committed centuries after I'm dead. I have never killed a\r\nman, but I won't hesitate to do so now, if one--or more--should get in\r\nmy way.\"\r\n\r\n\"But why,\" I asked soothingly, \"should you wish to kill anyone? You\r\nhave what you came for, you say; why not depart in peace?\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled crookedly, and his eyes narrowed with cunning.\r\n\r\n\"You approve of my little plan to dominate the world?\" he asked\r\nsoftly, his eyes searching my face.\r\n\r\n\"No,\" I said boldly, refusing to lie to him. \"I do not, and you know\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very true.\" He pulled out his watch with his left hand, and held it\r\nbefore his eyes so that he could observe the time without losing sight\r\nof me for even an instant. \"I doubted that I could secure your willing\r\ncooperation; therefore, I am commanding it.\r\n\r\n\"You see, there are certain instruments and pieces of equipment that I\r\nshould like to take back to my laboratory with me. Perhaps I would be\r\nable to reproduce them without models, but with the models my task\r\nwill be much easier.\r\n\r\n\"The question remaining is a simple one: will you give the proper\r\norders to have this equipment removed to the spot where you first saw\r\nme, or shall I be obliged to return to my own era without this\r\nequipment--leaving behind me a dead commander of the Special Patrol\r\nService, and any other who may try to stop me?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI tried to keep cool under the lash of his mocking voice. I have never\r\nbeen adept at holding my temper when I should, but somehow I managed\r\nit this time. Frowning, I kept him waiting for a reply, utilizing the\r\ntime to do what was perhaps the hardest, fastest thinking of my life.\r\n\r\nThere wasn't a particle of doubt in my mind regarding his ability to\r\nmake good his threat, nor his readiness to do so. I caught the faint\r\nglimmering of an idea and fenced with it eagerly.\r\n\r\n\"How are you going to go back to your own period--your own era?\" I\r\nasked him. \"You told me, I believe, that it was impossible to move\r\nbackward in time.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's not answering my question,\" he said, leering. \"Don't think\r\nyou're fooling me! But I'll tell you, just the same. I can go back to\r\nmy own era: that is, back to my own actual existence. I shall return\r\njust two hours after I leave; I could not go back farther than that,\r\nand it's not necessary that I do so. I can go back only because I came\r\nfrom that present; I am not really of this future at all. I go back\r\nfrom whence I came.\"\r\n\r\n\"But,\" I objected, thinking of something I had read in the clipping he\r\nhad showed me, \"you're not going back to your own era. You cannot. If\r\nyou returned, you would put your project into execution, and history\r\ndoes not record that activity.\" I saw from the sudden narrowing of his\r\nabnormally long eyes that I had caught his interest, and I pressed my\r\nadvantage hastily. \"Remember that all the history of your time is\r\nwritten, Harbauer. It is in the books of Earth's history, with which\r\nevery child of this age, into which you have thrust yourself, is\r\nfamiliar. And those histories do not record the domination of the\r\nworld by yourself. So--you are confronted by an impossibility!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMy reasoning, now, sounds specious, and yet it was a line of thought\r\nwhich could not be waved aside. I saw Harbauer's black brows knit\r\ntogether, and mounting anger darken his face. I do not know, but I\r\nbelieve I was never nearer death than I was at that instant.\r\n\r\n\"Fool!\" he cried. \"Idiot! Imbecile! Do you think you can confuse me,\r\nturn me from my purpose, with words? Do you? Do you believe me to be a\r\nchild, or a weakling? I tell you, I have planned this thing to the\r\nlast detail. If I had not found what I sought on this first trip, I\r\nwould have taken another, a dozen, a score, until I found the\r\ninformation I sought. The last six years of my life I have worked day\r\nand night to this end; your histories and your words--\"\r\n\r\nMy plan had worked. The man was beside himself with insane anger. And\r\nin his rage he forgot, for an instant, that he was my captor.\r\n\r\nTaking a desperate chance, I launched myself at his legs. His weapon\r\nroared over my head, just as I struck. I felt the hot gas from the\r\nthing beat against my neck; I caught the reeking scent of the smoke.\r\nThen we were both on the floor, and locked in a mad embrace.\r\n\r\nHarbauer was a smaller man than myself, but he had the amazing\r\nstrength of a Zenian. He fought viciously, using every ounce of his\r\nstrength against me, striving to bring his weapon into use, hammering\r\nmy head upon the floor, racking my body mercilessly, grunting,\r\ncursing, mumbling constantly as he did so.\r\n\r\nBut I was in better trim than Harbauer. I have never seen a laboratory\r\nman who could stand the strain of prolonged physical exertion. Bending\r\nover test-tubes and meters is no life for a man. At grips with him, I\r\nwas in my own element, and he was out of his. I let him wear himself\r\nout, exerting myself as little as possible, confining my efforts to\r\nkeeping his weapon where he could not use it.\r\n\r\nI felt him weakening at last. His breath was coming in great sobs, and\r\nhis long eyes started from their sockets with the strained effort he\r\nwas putting forth. And then, with a single mighty effort, I knocked\r\nthe pistol from his hand, so that it slid across the floor and brought\r\nup with a crash against a wall of the room.\r\n\r\n\"Now!\" I said, and turned on him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe knew, at that moment when I put forth my strength, that I had been\r\nplaying with him. I read the shock of sudden fear in his eyes. My\r\nright arm went about him in a deadly hold; I had him in a grip that\r\nparalyzed him. Grimly, I jerked him to his feet, and he stood there\r\ntrembling with weakness, his shoulders heaving as his breath came and\r\nwent between his teeth.\r\n\r\n\"You realize, of course, that you're not going back?\" I said quietly.\r\n\r\n\"Back?\" Half dazed, he stared at me through the quivering lids of his\r\npeculiar eyes. \"What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"I mean that you're not going back to your own era. You have come to\r\nus, uninvited, and--you're going to stay here.\"\r\n\r\n\"No!\" he shouted, and struggled so desperately to free himself that I\r\nwas hard put to it to hold him, without tightening my grip\r\nsufficiently to dislocate his shoulders. \"You wouldn't do that! I must\r\nreturn; I must prove to them--\"\r\n\r\n\"That's exactly what must not happen, and what shall not happen,\" I\r\ninterrupted. \"And what will not happen. You are in a strange\r\npredicament, Harbauer; it is already written that you do not return.\r\nCan't you see that, man? If it were to be that you left this age and\r\nreturned to your own, you would make known your discovery. History\r\nwould record it. And history does not record it. You are struggling,\r\nnot against me, but against--against a fate that has been sealed all\r\nthese centuries.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen I had finished, he stared at me as though hypnotized, motionless\r\nand limp in my grasp. Then, suddenly, he began to shake and I saw such\r\ndepths of terror and horror in his eyes as I hope never to see again.\r\n\r\nMechanically, he glanced down at his watch, lifting his wrist into his\r\nline of vision as slowly and ponderously as though it bore a great\r\nweight.\r\n\r\n\"Two ... two minutes,\" he whispered huskily. \"Then the automatic switch\r\nwill close, back in my laboratory. If I am not standing where ... where\r\nyou found me ... between the disc and the grid of my time machine, where\r\nthe reversed energy can reach me, to ... to take me back ... God!\"\r\n\r\nHe sagged in my arms and dropped to his knees, sobbing.\r\n\r\n\"And yet ... what you say is true. It is already written that I did\r\nnot return.\" His sobs cut harshly through the silence of the room.\r\nPitying his despair, I reached down to give him a sympathetic pat on\r\nthe shoulder. It is a terrible thing to see a man break down as\r\nHarbauer had done.\r\n\r\nAs he felt my grip on him relax, he suddenly shot his fist into the\r\npit of my stomach, and leaped to his feet. Groaning, I doubled up,\r\nweak and nerveless, for the instant, from the vicious, unexpected\r\nblow.\r\n\r\n\"Ah!\" shrieked Harbauer. \"You soft-hearted fool!\" He struck me in the\r\nface, sending me crashing to the floor, and snatched up his pistol.\r\n\r\n\"I'm going, now,\" he shouted. \"Going! What do I care for your records\r\nand your histories? They are not yet written; if they were I'd change\r\nthem.\" He bent over me and snatched from my hand the ring of keys, one\r\nof which I had used to unlock the door of the navigating room. I tried\r\nto grip him around the legs, but he tore himself loose, laughing\r\ninsanely in a high-pitched, cackling sound that seemed hardly human.\r\n\r\n\"Farewell!\" he called mockingly from the doorway. Then the door\r\nslammed, and as I staggered to my feet, I heard the lock click.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI must have acted then by instinct or inspiration. There was no time\r\nto think. It would take him not more than three or four seconds to\r\nmake his way to the exit, stroll by the guard to the spot where we had\r\nfound him, and--disappear. By the time I could arouse the crew, and\r\nhave my orders executed, his time would be up, and--unless the whole\r\naffair were some terrible nightmare--he would go hurtling back through\r\ntime to his own era, armed with a devastating knowledge.\r\n\r\nThere was only one possible means of preventing his escape in time. I\r\nran across the room to the emergency operating controls, cut in the\r\natomic generators with one hand and pulled the Vertical-Ascent lever\r\nto Full Power.\r\n\r\nThere was a sudden shriek of air, and my legs almost thrust themselves\r\nthrough my body. Quickly, I pushed the lever back until, with my eye\r\non the altimeter, I held the _Ertak_ at her attained height--something\r\nover a mile, as I recall it. Then I pressed the General Attention\r\nsignal, and snatched up the microphone.\r\n\r\nLess than a minute later Correy and Hendricks, fellow officers, were\r\nin the room and besieging me with solicitous questions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt had been my idea, of course, to keep Harbauer from leaving the\r\nship, but it was not so destined.\r\n\r\nShiro, the sentry on duty outside the _Ertak_, was the only witness to\r\nHarbauer's fate.\r\n\r\n\"I was walking my post, sir,\" he reported, \"watching the sun come up,\r\nwhen suddenly I heard the sound of running feet inside the ship. I\r\nturned towards the entrance and drew my pistol, to be in readiness. I\r\nsaw the stranger we had taken into the ship appear at the exit, which,\r\nas you know, was open.\r\n\r\n\"Just as I opened my mouth to command him to halt, the _Ertak_ shot up\r\nfrom the ground at terrific speed. The stranger had been about to leap\r\nupon me; indeed, he had discharged some sort of weapon at me, for I\r\nheard a crash of sound, and a missile of some kind, as you know,\r\npassed through my left arm.\r\n\r\n\"As the ship left the ground, he tried to draw back, but he was off\r\nbalance, and the inertia of his body momentarily incapacitated him, I\r\nthink. He slipped, clutched at the gangway across the threads which\r\nseal the exit, and then, at a height I estimate to be around five\r\nhundred feet, he fell. The _Ertak_ shot on up until it was lost to\r\nsight, and the stranger crashed to the ground a few feet from where I\r\nwas standing--on almost exactly the spot where we first saw him, sir.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"And now, sir, comes the part I guess you'll find hard to believe.\r\nWhen he struck the ground, he was smashed flat; he died instantly. I\r\nstarted to run toward him, and then--and then I stopped. My eyes had\r\nnot left the spot for a moment, sir, but he--his body, that\r\nis--suddenly disappeared. That's the truth, sir, for I saw it with my\r\nown eyes. There wasn't a sign of him left.\"\r\n\r\n\"I see,\" I replied. I believe that I did. We had gone straight up, and\r\nhis body, by no great coincidence, had fallen upon the spot close to\r\nthe exit of the _Ertak_ where we had first found him. And his machine,\r\nin operation, had brought him, or rather, his mangled body, back to\r\nhis own age. \"You have not mentioned this affair to anyone, Shiro?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, sir. It wasn't anything you'd be likely to tell: nobody would\r\nbelieve you. I went at once to have my arm attended to, and then\r\nreported here according to orders.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very good, Shiro. Keep the entire affair to yourself. I will make all\r\nthe necessary reports. That is an order--understand?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then that will be all. Take good care of your arm.\"\r\n\r\nHe saluted with his good hand and left me.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLater in the day I wrote in the log-book of the Ertak the report I\r\nmentioned at the beginning of this tale:\r\n\r\n     \"Just before departure, discovered stowaway, apparently\r\n      demented, and ejected him.\"\r\n\r\nThat was a perfectly truthful statement, and it served its purpose. I\r\nhave given the whole story in detail just to prove what I have so\r\noften contended: that these owlish laboratory men whom this age\r\nreveres so much are not nearly so wise and omnipotent as they think\r\nthey are.\r\n\r\nI am quite sure that they would have discredited, or attempted to\r\ndiscredit, my story, had I told it at the time. They would have\r\nresented the idea that someone so much ahead of them had discovered a\r\nprinciple that still baffles this age of ours, and I would have had no\r\nevidence to present.\r\n\r\nPerhaps even now the story will be discredited; if so, I do not care.\r\nI am much too old, and too near the portals of that impenetrable\r\nmystery, in the shadow of which I have stood so many times, to concern\r\nmyself with what others may think or say.\r\n\r\nI know that what I have related here is the truth, and in my mind I\r\nhave a vivid and rather pitiful picture of a mangled body, bloody and\r\nalone, in the barn-like structure the ancient paper had described; a\r\nbody, broken and motionless, lying athwart the striated metal disc,\r\nlike a sacrificial victim--a victim and a sacrifice of science.\r\n\r\nThere have been many such.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nManape the Mighty\r\n\r\nA COMPLETE NOVELETTE\r\n\r\n_By Arthur J. Burks_\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\n_Castaway_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _There, the words were written._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: High in jungle treetops swings young Bentley--his human\r\nbrain imprisoned in a mighty ape.]\r\n\r\n\r\nLee Bentley never knew how many others, if any, lived on after the\r\n_Bengal Queen_ struck the hidden reef and sank like a stone. He had\r\nonly a hazy memory of the catastrophe, and recalled that when she had\r\nstruck and the alarm had gone rocketing through the great passenger\r\nboat--though no alarm was really necessary because she went to pieces\r\nso fast--that he had leaped far over the rail and swam straight out,\r\nfast, in order to escape being dragged down by the suction of the\r\nsinking liner.\r\n\r\nThe screaming of frightened women and children would ring in his ears\r\nuntil the day the grave closed over him--screaming that was made all\r\nthe more terrible by the crashing roar of the raging black seas which\r\ncame out of the darkness to make the affair all the more hideous, and\r\nto bear down beneath them into the sea the feeble struggling ones who\r\nhad no chance for their lives. Lifeboats had been smashed in their\r\ndavits.\r\n\r\nBentley swam straight away after he was satisfied at last that he\r\ncould do nothing more. He had helped men and women reach bits of\r\nwreckage until he could scarcely any longer keep his wearied arms to\r\nthe task of keeping his own head above water. He knew even as he\r\nhelped the white-faced ones that few of them would ever live through\r\nit, but he was doing the best he knew--a man's job.\r\n\r\nWhen absolutely sure that he could do nothing further, when he could\r\nno longer hear cries of distress, or discover struggling forms in the\r\nsea which he might aid, he had turned his back on the graveyard of\r\nthe _Bengal Queen_ and had struck for shore. He remembered the\r\ndirection, for before sunset that evening, in company with several\r\nship's under officers, he had studied the navigation charts upon which\r\neach day's run of the _Bengal Queen_ was shown. Ahead of him now was\r\nthe coast of Africa, though what part of it he knew but in the haziest\r\nway. He might not guess within a hundred miles.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne thing only he remembered exactly. The second officer had said,\r\napropos of nothing in particular:\r\n\r\n\"This wouldn't be a happy place to be shipwrecked. This section of the\r\ncoast is a regular hangout of the great anthropoid apes. You know,\r\nthose babies that can pick a man apart as a man would pluck the legs\r\noff a fly.\"\r\n\r\nBentley had merely grinned. The second officer's remarks had sounded\r\nto him as though the fellow had been reading more than his fair share\r\nof lurid fiction of the South African jungles.\r\n\r\nHowever, apes or no apes, the shore would look good to Lee Bentley\r\nnow. And he fully intended making it. He knew he could swim for hours\r\nif it became necessary, and he refused to think of the possibility of\r\nsharks. If one got him, well, that was one of the chances one had to\r\ntake when one was shipwrecked against one's will.\r\n\r\nSo he alternately swam toward where he expected to find land, and\r\nfloated on his back to rest.\r\n\r\n\"A swell ending to a great life, if I don't make it,\" he told himself.\r\n\"I wonder how the old man will take it when the world reads that the\r\n_Bengal Queen_ went down with all on board? He'll be relieved, maybe,\r\nfor he was about ready to wash his hands of me if I can read signs at\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt might be said that Bentley was his own worst critic, for he really\r\nwas not a bad sort of a fellow. He was a good American, over-educated\r\nperhaps, with a yen to delve into forbidden places usually avoided by\r\nhis own kind, and of digging into books which were better left with\r\nthe pages unturned. There were strange ruins in Africa, he knew. He\r\nhad gathered a weird fund of information from such books as he could\r\nunearth relative to ancient ruins and vanished races, to the lurid\r\naccounts of strange deaths of the various scientists who had taken\r\nactive part in the opening of the tomb of Tutankhamen.\r\n\r\nThere were queer things in the heart of darkest Africa, and such\r\nthings intrigued him. He could take whatever chances with his life he\r\nsaw fit, for his only relative was a father, and he had never attached\r\nhimself to any woman nor permitted any woman to attach herself to\r\nhim--because he could never be sure that her interest might not\r\nprimarily be in his bank account.\r\n\r\n\"If, as, and when,\" he told himself as he rode the waves through the\r\nnight, \"I reach the coast I'll be tossed into black Africa in a way I\r\nwas not expecting. Anyway, if I live through, I can at least go about\r\nmy work without the governor interfering. I only hope it won't be hard\r\non the old fellow. He isn't a bad egg at all, and I guess I have given\r\nhim plenty to think about and worry over.\"\r\n\r\nHe turned on his stomach again and struck out. He had managed to rid\r\nhimself of all of his clothing except his underwear. They had only\r\nweighed him down, and he recalled, with a wry grin, that Africa as a\r\nwhole went in but little for the latest in men's sport wear.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt must have been a good hour since he had lost the _Bengal Queen_\r\nback there in the raging deep, that he heard the faint call through\r\nthe murk.\r\n\r\n\"Help, for God's sake!\"\r\n\r\nHe listened for a repetition of the call, minded to believe that his\r\nears had tricked him. He fancied it had been a woman's voice, but no\r\nwoman could have lived so long in those raging seas, in which any\r\nmoment Bentley himself expected to be overwhelmed. For himself he\r\nregarded death more or less philosophically, but a woman out there,\r\ncrying for help, was a different matter entirely. It tore at his\r\nheartstrings, mostly because he realized his inability to be of\r\nmaterial assistance.\r\n\r\nHe was sure that he had been mistaken about the cry, when it came\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"For God's sake, help!\"\r\n\r\nIt came from his left and this time it was unmistakable, piteous and\r\nunnerving. Lee Bentley had the horrible fear that he would never reach\r\nher in time to help--though what help he could give, when he could\r\nbarely manage to keep himself afloat, he could not forsee.\r\n\r\nHe was swimming down the side of a monster wave. He could see\r\nsomething white in the trough, and he struggled manfully to make\r\nheadway, while the angry waters tossed him about like a bit of cork\r\nand seemed bent on defeating his most furious efforts. He saw the bit\r\nof white ride high on the next wave, pass over it and vanish. He dived\r\nstraight through the wave as it towered over him. He came up, gasping,\r\nhis hands all but clutching at a pair of hands that reached out of the\r\nwaters and grasped with a last desperate effort at the sky.\r\n\r\nAhead of the hands was a broken piece of oar. Those hands had just\r\ndespairingly relinquished their grip on the one chance of safety, if\r\nany chance there could possibly be in that mad midnight waste.\r\n\r\nHe pulled on the wrists and a white face came to view. Wild, staring\r\neyes looked into his. Black hair flowed back from a face whose lips\r\nwere blue and thin.\r\n\r\n\"Take it easy,\" he counseled. \"Turn on your back and rest while I see\r\nif I can get back your life-boat.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe captured the oar, and found it practically useless to sustain any\r\nappreciable weight, but he clung to it because it was at least better\r\nthan nothing at all. It had held the girl afloat for over an hour and\r\nmight be made to serve again somehow. With his left hand under the\r\nwoman's head and his right grasping the oar he turned on his back to\r\nregain his breath. He was deep in the water because the woman was now\r\nalmost on top of him; but her face was above water. He knew\r\ninstinctively that she had fainted, and he was a little glad. If she\r\nwere the usual hysterical woman her fighting would drown them both. As\r\na dead weight she was easier to handle.\r\n\r\nThey drifted on, and hope began to mount high in the heart of Lee\r\nBentley--the hope that they might yet reach land. When, hours later,\r\nhe could hear the roaring of breakers he was sure of it--if the\r\nbreakers could be passed in safety. After that their fate was in the\r\nlap of the gods.\r\n\r\nThe girl too must have heard, for she turned at last in Bentley's arms\r\nand began to swim for herself. She was a strong swimmer and the period\r\nduring which she had been out of things had revived her amazingly. She\r\neven managed a smile as she swam beside Bentley into the creamy\r\nbreakers behind which they could make out the blackness of shore.\r\n\r\nThey were so close together that at times their hands touched as they\r\nswam, and could make themselves heard by dint of shouting, though they\r\nboth husbanded their strength and their breathing for swimming.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not dressed for company,\" he told her. \"I left my tuxedo aboard\r\nthe _Bengal Queen_!\"\r\n\r\nIt was then that her lips twisted into a smile.\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't even allow my maid into my stateroom if I were dressed as\r\nI am at the moment,\" she answered strongly, \"but we're both grown up I\r\nthink, and there are times when conventions go by the board. We'll\r\npretend it doesn't matter!\"\r\n\r\nThen mutually helping each other they fought through the breakers into\r\nthe calmer water behind, and managed at last to stand in water hip\r\ndeep, with the undertow dragging at their limbs. They looked at each\r\nother and clasped hands without a word. They strode to the sandy beach\r\nbeyond which the jungle reached away to some invisible horizon, and\r\ncontinued on until they were at last beyond the reach of the waves.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey did not look at each other again, though Bentley did notice that\r\nher garb was as scanty almost as his own, consisting mostly of a slip\r\nwhich the water had pasted fast against her flesh. Beyond noting that\r\nshe seemed to be young, Bentley did not intrude. Nor did he think of\r\nthe future. It was enough for the moment that they had escaped the\r\nmight of angry Neptune, god of the seas.\r\n\r\nThey dropped to the sands side by side, and the sands were warm. That\r\nthe jungle behind them might be alive with wild beasts they did not\r\npause to consider. Bentley had gazed at the jungle a moment before\r\ndropping down.\r\n\r\nHe had noticed but one thing--a moving light somewhere among the\r\ntangled mass, a light as of a monster firefly erratically darting\r\nthrough the deeper gloom.\r\n\r\nThe girl--he had noted she was as much girl as woman--dropped to the\r\nsand and stretched herself out. Bentley looked about him for a\r\nmoment, just now realizing what he had been through. Then he dropped\r\ndown beside the girl, and put one arm over her protectively, an\r\ninstinctive movement. The two were alone in an alien world, and even\r\nthis slight contact gave Bentley a feeling of companionship he found\r\nat the time peculiarly appealing.\r\n\r\nThe girl was in a drugged sort of sleep, but she stirred at the touch\r\nof his arm, and her hand came up so that her fingertips touched his\r\ncheek.\r\n\r\nHe slept heavily, while outside on the raging deep the storm swept on\r\nalong the coast, bearing with it the secret of the rest of those who\r\nonly last night had looked forward to a pleasant voyage aboard the\r\n_Bengal Queen_.\r\n\r\nThe last thought in Bentley's mind was of that flickering light he had\r\nseen. It was not important, but memory of it clung, and followed him\r\ninto his sleep with his dreams--in which he seemed to be following a\r\ndarting, erratic light through a jungle without end.\r\n\r\nHe wakened with the sun burning his face and torso, and turned on his\r\nstomach with a groan. The heat ate into his back unbearably and he\r\nfinally sat up, rubbed his eyes and stared out to sea. Then it all\r\ncame back and he looked about him for the girl. She had disappeared.\r\n\r\nHe rose to his feet and shouted.\r\n\r\nAn answering cry came back to him, and after a moment the girl\r\nappeared around a bend in a shoreline where she had been masked by a\r\nwall of the jungle and came toward him. She was carrying something in\r\nher hands. When she stood at last before him he noted that she carried\r\na bundle of cloth that was dripping wet.\r\n\r\n\"We need something to cover us,\" she said simply. \"I was tempted to\r\ngarb myself, but I did not wish to seem like a simpering prudish\r\nfemale, which I'm not at all. So I brought my findings here so that we\r\ncould get together and fix up something to protect us from the sun.\"\r\n\r\n\"You're a sensible woman,\" said Bentley. \"I've never understood why\r\npeople should be so sensitive about their bodies. Mine isn't bad and\r\nyours, if you'll pardon me, is superb. That's not a compliment, just a\r\nstatement of fact--which will help us to understand each other better.\r\nI've a hunch we're going to be some time in each other's company and\r\nwe may as well know things about each other. My name's Lee Bentley.\"\r\n\r\n\"Mine is Ellen Estabrook.\"\r\n\r\nSolemnly they shook hands. And their hands clung convulsively, for as\r\nthough their handshake had been a signal there came a strange sound\r\nfrom the jungle behind them.\r\n\r\nA burst of laughter that was plainly human--and another sound which\r\ncaused the short hair at the base of Bentley's skull to rise, shift\r\noddly, and settle back again.\r\n\r\nThe sound was like the beating of a skin-tight drumhead by the fists\r\nof a jungle savage. But if such it was the drum was a mighty drum, and\r\nthe savage was a giant, for the sound went rolling through the jungle\r\nlike an invisible tidal wave of sound.\r\n\r\nBoth the laughter and the drumming ceased as suddenly as they had\r\nsounded.\r\n\r\nThe man and woman laughed jerkily, dropped to the sand side by side\r\nand considered the necessity of clothes.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n_Into the Jungle_\r\n\r\nThey had to smile together at the results achieved with the bedraggled\r\nbits of cloth. Bentley suspected that they had been taken from bodies\r\nwashed ashore as gruesome reminders of the catastrophe which had\r\nbefallen the _Bengal Queen_, and because he did suspect this he did\r\nnot ask questions that might cause Ellen to remember any longer than\r\nwas necessary. Not that he doubted her courage, for she had proved\r\nthat sufficiently; and she had proved that she was sensible, with none\r\nof the notions of the proprieties which would have made any other girl\r\nof Bentley's acquaintance a nuisance.\r\n\r\nTheir next concern was food, which they must find in the jungle, or\r\nfrom other wreckage cast ashore from the _Bengal Queen_. Now, hand in\r\nhand--which seemed natural in the circumstances--they began to walk\r\nalong the shore, heading into the north by mutual consent.\r\n\r\nAs they walked Bentley kept pondering on that strange laughter he had\r\nheard and on the sound of savage drumming. The laughter puzzled him.\r\nIf there were anyone in the jungle back of them, why had he or they\r\nfailed to challenge them?\r\n\r\nAs for the drumming sound--Bentley remembered what the second officer\r\nhad said about this section of the coast. It was a bit of jungle\r\ninhabited by the great apes in large numbers. So, that drumming had\r\nbeen a challenge, the man-ape's manner of mocking an enemy by beating\r\nhimself on his barrel chest with his huge fists. But that the ape had\r\nnot been challenging Bentley and the girl Bentley felt quite sure, as\r\nthe brute would certainly have shown himself in that case.\r\n\r\nThey trudged on through the sand, while the sun beat down unmercifully\r\non their uncovered heads. Ellen Estabrook strode along at Bentley's\r\nside without complaint.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAfter perhaps an hour of this unbearable effort, when both felt as\r\nthough the sun had sucked them dry of perspiration, they encountered\r\na rough footpath leading into the jungle. The path suggested human\r\nhabitation somewhere near. The inhabitants might be hostile natives,\r\neven cannibals perhaps, but in this unknown land they would have to\r\ntake a chance on that.\r\n\r\nWith a sigh of relief, and refusing to look ahead too far, or try to\r\nguess what lay in wait for them in the black mystery of the jungle,\r\nthey turned into the footpath. The jungle was fetid and sweaty, but\r\neven this was a relief from the intolerable sun which could not reach\r\nthem here because the jungle had closed its leafy arms over the trail\r\ninstantly. One could not tell from the path whether it had been made\r\nby natives or by whites, for it was packed hard. It led straight away\r\nfrom the shoreline.\r\n\r\n\"We'll have to keep a sharp lookout for possible poisoned spring\r\ndarts, Ellen,\" said Bentley.\r\n\r\n\"I'm not afraid, Lee,\" she answered stoutly. \"Fate wouldn't allow us\r\nto come through what we have only to end things with poisoned darts.\r\nIt just couldn't happen that way!\"\r\n\r\nThus simply they addressed each other. It seemed as though years had\r\nbeen squeezed into a matter of hours. They knew each other as well as\r\nthey would, in other circumstances, have known each other after a year\r\nof constant association. Here barriers of conventions were razed as\r\nsimply and naturally as among children.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey had pressed well into the gloom of the jungle when the first\r\nsound came.\r\n\r\nNot the laughter they had heard before, but the drumming. It was ahead\r\nand somewhat to the left, and as they stopped without speaking they\r\ncould distinctly hear the threshing of a huge body through the\r\nunderbrush. The sound seemed to be approaching and for a minute or so\r\nthey listened. Then the sound was repeated off to the right, a trifle\r\nfurther away.\r\n\r\n\"Can you climb, Ellen?\" asked Bentley simply. \"This section is filled\r\nwith anthropoid apes, according to the second officer of the _Bengal\r\nQueen_. We may have to take to the trees.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can climb,\" she said, \"but from what I've studied of the habits of\r\nthese brutes they do a great deal of bluffing before they actually\r\ncharge, and may not molest us at all if we pay no attention.\"\r\n\r\nBentley felt almost nude because he had no weapons save his own fists.\r\nAnd he would not have admitted even to himself how deeply he was\r\nconcerned over the girl. As far as he knew, this section might be\r\nentirely uninhabited. It might be given over entirely to the\r\nanthropoids. In this case he shuddered to think of what might happen\r\nto Ellen Estabrook if he were slain.\r\n\r\nHe quickened his pace until Ellen kept stride with him with\r\ndifficulty. The object uppermost in Bentley's mind was to get as far\r\naway as possible from the ominous drumbeats.\r\n\r\nThey rounded a bend in the trail and stopped stock-still.\r\n\r\nWithin fifty yards of them, blocking the trail, was a brute whose\r\ngreat size sent a thrill of horror through Bentley. It towered to the\r\nheight of a big man, and must have weighed in the neighborhood of four\r\nhundred pounds. It was larger by far than any bull ape Bentley had\r\nseen in captivity.\r\n\r\nIt had been waiting for them, silently, with almost human cunning; but\r\nnow that it was discovered the shaggy creature rose to his hind legs\r\nand screamed a challenge, at the same time striking his chest with\r\nblows of his hairy fists which rolled in a dull booming of sound\r\nthrough the jungle. At the same time the creature moved forward.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBentley whirled to run, his hand clasping tighter the hand of Ellen\r\nEstabrook. But they had not retreated ten steps down the pathway when\r\ntheir way was blocked by another of the great shaggy brutes. And they\r\ncould hear others on both sides.\r\n\r\nBentley's face was chalk-white as he turned to the girl. Her calm\r\nacceptance of their predicament, an attitude in which he could read no\r\nslightest vestige of fear, helped him to regain control of his own\r\nnerves, which had threatened to send him into a panic. She even\r\nsmiled, and Lee felt a trifle ashamed of himself.\r\n\r\nNow the crashing sounds were closing in. The two brutes before and\r\nbehind on the trail were pressing in upon them. But no general\r\nheadlong charge had yet begun. Bentley looked around him, seeking a\r\ntree with limbs low enough for them to reach and thus climb to safety.\r\n\r\n\"There's one!\" cried Ellen. Tugging at his hand she began to run.\r\n\r\nAt the same moment the great apes bellowed and charged.\r\n\r\nBut the charge was never finished, for through the drumming of their\r\nmighty fists on mighty barrel-like chests, through the sound of their\r\ncharge, through the crackling underbrush came again that sound of\r\nlaughter. There was fierce joy in the laughter, and the laughter was\r\nfollowed by words of a strange gibberish which Bentley could not\r\nrecall as being from any language he had ever heard.\r\n\r\nThe great apes paused. Out of the jungle to the right of the fugitives\r\nburst a white man. He was well past middle age, for his white hair\r\nhung almost to his shoulders, which were stooped with the weight of\r\nyears. He was a wisp of a man whose smooth shaven face was apple-red.\r\nHis eyes were black and expressionless as obsidian, and when Lee\r\nencountered the full gaze of them he was conscious of that feeling\r\nwhich he had experienced at various times in his life when he knew\r\nthat some deadly reptile was close by.\r\n\r\n\"Stand still a moment!\" cried the old man. His voice was strangely\r\nhigh-pitched and cracked.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom his right hand a whip with a long lash uncurled like a snake.\r\n\r\nThis he swung back and hurled to the front, and the snap of it was\r\nlike a pistol shot. The great ape on the path ahead cowered back,\r\nbearing his fangs, roaring in anger. But that he feared the whip of\r\nthe old man was plain to be seen. The crashing sound in the jungle\r\ndied away rapidly, immediately the first report of the whip lash\r\nsounded in the trail.\r\n\r\nFearlessly the little man dashed upon the first of the great brutes\r\nthe castaways had seen. His lash curled about the great beast's body,\r\nand the animal bellowed with pain. It clawed at the lash, but was not\r\nfast enough to capture it. In the end the brute broke and fled.\r\n\r\nThe animal which had blocked their path in the rear had already\r\ndisappeared.\r\n\r\nNow the little man came back to face the fugitives, and his lips were\r\nparted in a cordial smile. He coiled his whip and tucked it under his\r\narm. He was dressed in well worn corduroy with high boots that were\r\nrather the worse for wear. Bentley saw that his lips were too\r\nred--like blood--and somehow he disliked the man instantly.\r\n\r\n\"Welcome to Barterville,\" said the old man. \"It has been years since I\r\nhave seen any of my own kind. People avoid this section of the\r\njungle.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't wonder,\" said Bentley, sighing deeply with relief. \"Those\r\nbrutes would make anybody keep away from here, if they knew about\r\nthem. I thought they had us for a few minutes. They planned an ambush\r\nalmost as well as human beings could have done it--but that's absurd\r\nof course, merely a coincidence.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Coincidence?\" snapped the old man, a hint of asperity in his words.\r\n\"Coincidence? I see you do not know the great apes, sir. I have always\r\nmaintained that apes could be trained to do anything men can do. I\r\nhave maintained that they have a language of their own, and even ways\r\nof communicating without words, a sort of jungle writing which men of\r\ncourse have never yet learned. I've devoted my life to learning the\r\nsecrets of the great apes, their life histories, and so forth. I am\r\nProfessor Caleb Barter!\"\r\n\r\n\"Professor Caleb Barter!\" ejaculated Ellen Estabrook. \"Why I've heard\r\nof him! He went on an expedition among the great apes ten years ago\r\nand was never heard of again.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am Caleb Barter,\" said the old man. \"I decided to disappear from\r\nthe world I knew, to let other fool scientists think me dead in order\r\nthat I might continue my investigations without molestation. And now I\r\nhave almost reached the place where I can go back to civilization with\r\ninformation that will startle the world. There yet remains one\r\nexperiment. Now I hope to make that experiment. No! No! Don't ask me\r\nwhat it is. It is my secret and nobody will ever wrest it from me.\"\r\n\r\nBentley studied the old man. He seemed slightly demented, Bentley\r\nthought, but that might be merely the mental evolution of a man who\r\nhad made a hermit of himself for so many years--if this chap actually\r\nwere Professor Barter.\r\n\r\n\"Professor Barter,\" went on Ellen, \"was the scientific leader of his\r\nday. Others followed where he led. He made greater strides in surgery\r\nand medicine, and in unravelling the mysteries of evolution, than\r\nanyone else up to his time. Of course I believe you are Professor\r\nBarter. My name is Ellen Estabrook, and this gentleman is Lee Bentley.\r\nWe believe ourselves to be the only survivors of the _Bengal Queen_.\r\nPerhaps you can lead us to food and water?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, oh yes! Indeed. One forgets how to be hospitable, I fear. I am\r\nsorry to hear there was a wreck and that lives were lost--but it may\r\nmean a great gain to the world of science. I am happier to see you\r\nthan you can possibly know!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBentley felt the cold chills racing along his spine as he listened to\r\nthe old man's flow of words. He behaved well, but Bentley could feel\r\nin spite of that, that there was a hidden current of menace in the old\r\nman's behavior. He wished that Ellen would keep him talking, would\r\nsomehow make sure of his identity. Perhaps the same thought was in her\r\nmind, for it had scarcely come to him when the girl spoke again.\r\n\r\n\"Before he disappeared Professor Barter wrote a learned treatise on--\"\r\n\r\n\"I am Professor Barter, I tell you, young woman. But if you wish proof\r\nthe title of the treatise was 'The Language of the Great Apes.'\"\r\n\r\nEllen turned quickly to Bentley and nodded. She was satisfied that the\r\nman was the person he claimed to be. He didn't ask how Ellen happened\r\nto know about him, and Bentley himself considered the proof entirely\r\nlacking in conclusiveness. Anyone might know about the last treatise\r\nof Barter.\r\n\r\nHowever, they could but await developments.\r\n\r\nThey followed Barter along the trail. Now and again apes challenged\r\nfrom the jungle, and Barter answered them with that strange laughter\r\nof his, or with a flow of gibberish that was like nothing human.\r\n\r\nBentley shivered. Barter, by his laughter, was identifying himself to\r\nthe great anthropoids. But with his gibberish was he actually\r\nconversing with them?\r\n\r\n\"This experiment of yours,\" said Bentley when the period of silence\r\nbecame unbearable, \"--won't you tell us about it?\"\r\n\r\nThe old man cackled.\r\n\r\n\"You'll know all about it--soon! You'll know everything, but the\r\nsecret will still rest with Caleb Barter. Do not be too curious, my\r\nfriends.\"\r\n\r\n\"We are anxious to reach civilization, Professor,\" said Bentley,\r\ndeciding to be placative with the old man. \"Perhaps you can arrange\r\nfor guides for us?\"\r\n\r\nBarter laughed.\r\n\r\n\"I could not permit you to leave me for some time,\" he said. \"I want\r\nyou to witness my experiment. The world would never believe me without\r\nthe evidence of reliable witnesses.\"\r\n\r\nBarter laughed again.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey entered a clean clearing which was a riot of flowers. At the\r\nfurther edge was a log cabin of huge proportions. The whole thing had\r\na decidedly homely appearance, but it was a welcome sight to the\r\ncastaways. There were cages in which strange birds chattered shrilly\r\nin their own language at sight of the three. A pair of tame monkeys\r\nchased each other on the roof of the house, whose corners were almost\r\nhidden by climbing vines whose growth one could almost see.\r\n\r\nBarter led the way at a swift walk across the clearing and into the\r\nhouse.\r\n\r\nBentley gasped. Ellen Estabrook exclaimed with pleasure.\r\n\r\nThe reception room was as neat as though it received the hourly\r\nattentions of a fussy housewife. It was cozily furnished, yet it was\r\nevident that the furniture had been made on the spot of rough wood\r\nand skins of various animals. Deep skin rugs covered the floor and\r\nwalls. There were three doors giving off of the reception room, all\r\nthree of which were closed.\r\n\r\n\"You are not married?\" he asked the two.\r\n\r\n\"No!\" snapped Bentley.\r\n\r\n\"That center door leads to your room, Bentley. The one next to it is\r\nfor the young lady. The other door? Ah, the other door my friends!\r\nThat door you must never open. But to make sure that curiosity does\r\nnot overcome caution, let me show you!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey followed him to the door. He swung it open.\r\n\r\nBoth visitors started back and a gasp of terror burst from the lips of\r\nEllen Estabrook. Beads of perspiration burst forth on Bentley.\r\n\r\nThey saw a huge room. In one corner was a bed. The other held a great\r\ncage--and in the cage was an anthropoid ape larger even than the great\r\nbrute they had met on the trail!\r\n\r\nBarter laughed. He stepped into the room, uncoiled his whip and hurled\r\nthe lash at the cage. A great bellowing roar fairly shook the house,\r\nwhile the brute tore at the bars which held him prisoner until the\r\nwhole massive cage seemed to dance. Barter laughed and continued to\r\ngoad him.\r\n\r\n\"Barter,\" yelled Bentley, \"stop that! If that beast should ever happen\r\naccidentally to get free he'd tear you to pieces!\"\r\n\r\n\"I know,\" said Barter grimly, \"and that's part of the experiment! Now\r\nwe shall eat, and you, young lady, shall tell me what other fool\r\nscientists had to say about me after I disappeared--to escape their\r\nparrot-like repeating of my discoveries!\"\r\n\r\nBentley started to offer protest as Barter began preparation for the\r\nmeal, which obviously was to be taken in the room which held the cage\r\nof the giant anthropoid, but Ellen put her fingers to her lips and\r\nshook her head. Her eyes were dancing with excitement.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n_A Night of Horror_\r\n\r\nThe meal consisted of various fruits, some meat which Bentley could\r\nnot identify, and wild honey which was delicious. The bread tasted\r\nqueer but was distinctly edible. The castaways ate ravenously, but\r\neven as he ate Bentley noticed that Ellen's face was chalky pale, and\r\nthat in spite of a distinct effort of will she simply had to look at\r\nintervals toward the great beast in the cage.\r\n\r\nCaleb Barter sat with his back to the animal. Bentley sat at the left\r\nof the old scientist, Ellen Estabrook at his right. The great beast\r\nwas quiet now, but he squatted within his prison and his red-rimmed\r\neyes swerved from one person to the other in the room with a peculiar\r\nintentness.\r\n\r\n\"I'd swear that beast can almost read our thoughts!\" ejaculated\r\nBentley at last, after he had somewhat sated his appetite.\r\n\r\nBarter smiled with those too-red lips of his.\r\n\r\n\"He can--almost. You'd be surprised to know how nearly human the great\r\napes are, and how nearly human this particular one is. Ah!\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean, this particular one?\" asked Bentley curiously. \"He\r\ndoesn't look any different to me from the others I've seen except that\r\nhe is far and away the largest.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't see why you should be so curious,\" said Barter testily. \"It's\r\nnone of your business you know--yet.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean?\" demanded Bentley, nettled by Barter's tone.\r\n\r\n\"Lee, hush,\" said Ellen. \"Professor Barter is not on trial for any\r\ncrime.\"\r\n\r\nBentley looked at her in hurt surprise, inclined to be angry with her\r\nfor the tone she was taking, but he saw such a look of appeal in her\r\neyes that he choked back the words that rushed to his lips for\r\nutterance. He was decidedly on edge, more, he felt, than he should\r\nhave been despite what they had gone through. When their eyes met he\r\nsaw her glance quickly toward the ape, and noted a frown of worry\r\nbetween her brows.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBentley glanced at the ape. The brute now was staring at the girl in a\r\nway that made Bentley's flesh crawl. It was preposterous of course,\r\nbut he had the feeling, something which seemed to flow out of that\r\nmighty cage like some evil emanation from a dank tarn, that the ape\r\nknew the girl's sex--and that he desired her! It was horrible in the\r\nextreme to contemplate, yet Bentley knew when he glanced swiftly at\r\nthe girl that she had sensed the same thing and was fighting to keep\r\nthe natural horror she felt at such a ghastly thought from being\r\nnoticeable. It was absurd. The ape was a prisoner. But....\r\n\r\n\"Professor Barter,\" said Bentley, \"you're accustomed to being with\r\nthis brute, but it isn't so nice for us, especially for Miss\r\nEstabrook.\"\r\n\r\nBarter now frowned angrily.\r\n\r\n\"My dear Bentley,\" he said with that odd testiness which he had\r\nassumed toward Bentley before, \"I refuse to have any interference with\r\nmy experiment. This is part of it.\"\r\n\r\n\"You mean--\" began Bentley.\r\n\r\n\"I mean that I'm training that ape--I call him Manape--to behave like\r\nhuman beings. How better can he learn than by watching our behavior?\"\r\n\r\n\"Just the same,\" said Bentley, \"I don't like it.\"\r\n\r\n\"It's all right, Lee,\" said Ellen quickly. \"I don't mind.\"\r\n\r\nBut Bentley knew that it wasn't all right, and that she did mind,\r\nterribly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBarter finished eating. Bentley had noticed that despite the long\r\nyears he had been a virtual hermit, Barter ate as fastidiously as he\r\nprobably had done when he had lived among his own kind. He pushed back\r\nhis chair with a swift movement.\r\n\r\nInstantly the roaring of Manape rang through the room. The great brute\r\nrose to his full height and grasped the bars of his cage, shaking them\r\nwith savage fury. He glared at his master and bestial rage glittered\r\nfrom his red-rimmed eyes. He was a horrible sight. Ellen Estabrook,\r\nwith no apology, stepped around the table and crouched wide-eyed in\r\nthe arm of Lee Bentley.\r\n\r\n\"Lee,\" she said, \"I'm terribly afraid. I almost wish we had trusted\r\nourselves in the jungle.\"\r\n\r\n\"I'll look out for you,\" he whispered, as Barter turned his attention\r\nto the great ape.\r\n\r\nBut Bentley was watching the animal. So was Barter. The eyes of the\r\nscientist were shining like coals of fire. For the moment he appeared\r\nto have forgotten his guests.\r\n\r\n\"It is a success!\" he cried. \"As far as it goes, I mean!\"\r\n\r\nWhat did Barter mean? Seeking some answer to the enigma, Bentley\r\nstudied the ape anew. Now he was positive of another thing: Manape was\r\nscarcely concerned with Barter, whom he appeared to hate with an\r\nutterly satanic hatred. His beady eyes were staring at Bentley\r\ninstead!\r\n\r\n\"The brute is jealous of me!\" thought Bentley. \"Good God, what does it\r\nmean, anyway?\"\r\n\r\nBarter turned back to them and all at once became the genial host.\r\n\r\n\"Shall we return to the other room?\" he asked politely.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was a relief to the castaways to put that awful room behind them.\r\nBarter closed and barred the door with deliberate slowness.\r\n\r\nWhy had this old man shut himself away from civilization like this?\r\nHow long had he held this great ape in captivity? What was the purpose\r\nof it? What experiment was he performing? What part of it had the\r\ncastaways been witnessing that they had not recognized? Bentley,\r\nrecalling the distinct impression that the ape had stared at Ellen\r\nalmost with the eyes of a lustful man, and had even appeared to be\r\njealous of him because the girl had gone into his arms--Bentley felt a\r\nshiver of revulsion course through him as it struck him now how\r\n_human_ the regard and the jealousy of the creature had been!\r\n\r\nHe felt like clutching at the girl and racing with her into the\r\nhazards of the jungle. But he remembered the anthropoids out there,\r\nand Barter's peculiar domination of the brutes.\r\n\r\nBarter was now watching the two with interest, studying them in turn\r\nspeculatively, unmindful of the impertinence of his studious regard\r\nand silence.\r\n\r\n\"I have it!\" he said. \"Will you two be good enough to excuse me? You\r\nwill need rest, I am sure. I am going away for a little time, but I\r\nshall return shortly after dark. Make yourselves at home. But\r\nremember--don't enter that room!\"\r\n\r\n\"You need not worry,\" said Bentley grimly. \"I sincerely hope we take\r\nour next meal in some other room.\"\r\n\r\nBarter laughed and passed out of the door without a backward glance.\r\n\r\nFrom the jungle immediately afterward came the drumming of the great\r\napes, and now and again the laughter of Barter--high-pitched at first,\r\nbut dying away as Barter apparently moved off into the jungle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Ellen,\" said Bentley quickly, \"I don't know what's going on here, but\r\nI'm sure it's something sinister and awful. Let's take a look at our\r\nrooms. If there isn't a door between them which can be left open,\r\nthen you'll have to spend the night in my room while I remain awake on\r\nguard.\"\r\n\r\n\"I was thinking of the same thing, Lee,\" she whispered. \"This place\r\ngives me the horrors. Barter's association with the apes is a terrible\r\nthing.\"\r\n\r\nHand in hand they stepped to the door Barter had designated as that of\r\nEllen Estabrook's. Bentley opened it cautiously, heaving a sigh of\r\nrelief to find it empty. He scarcely knew what he had expected. There\r\nwas a connecting door between the two rooms, open, and they peered\r\ninto the chamber Bentley was to occupy.\r\n\r\nBack they came to her room, to stand before a window which gave onto a\r\nshadowed little clearing in the rear of the cabin.\r\n\r\n\"Look!\" whispered Ellen.\r\n\r\nThere was a single mound of earth, with a white cross set over it, on\r\nwhich was the single word: Mangor.\r\n\r\nIt might have been a word in some native dialect. It might have been\r\nsome native's name. It might have been anything, but, whatever it was,\r\nit added to the sinister atmosphere which seemed to hang like an evil\r\nmist over the home of Caleb Barter.\r\n\r\n\"That settles it, Ellen,\" he said. \"You'll spend the night in my\r\nroom.\"\r\n\r\nEllen retired in Bentley's room, closing the door which led to the\r\nadjoining room, and Bentley walked back and forth in the reception\r\nroom, waiting for Barter to return. When darkness fell he lighted the\r\nlamps he had previously located. Their odor caused him to guess that\r\nthe fuel they used was some sort of animal fat. In the strange glow\r\nfrom the lamps, his shadow on the walls, as he walked to and fro, was\r\ngrotesque, terrible--and at times a grim reminder of the great apes.\r\nIt caused him to consider how, after all, human beings were akin to\r\ngorillas and chimpanzees. Somehow, now, it was a horrible thought.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe night wore on and Bentley's stride became faster. Now and again he\r\npeered into the girl's room. She was sleeping the sleep of utter\r\nexhaustion and he did not waken her. Bentley felt it was near midnight\r\nwhen Barter returned, his return heralded by a strange commotion in\r\nthe clearing, and the frightful drumming of the great apes--or at\r\nleast _one_ great ape. Bentley shuddered as the animal behind the\r\nlocked door answered the drumming challenge with a drumming thunder of\r\nhis own.\r\n\r\nBarter came in, and Bentley accosted him at once.\r\n\r\n\"See here, Barter,\" he began. \"I don't like it here. There's something\r\nstrange going on in this clearing. Miss Estabrook and I wish to leave\r\nimmediately in the morning! And that grave behind the cabin, who or\r\nwhat is it?\"\r\n\r\nBarter studied the almost trembling Bentley for all of a minute.\r\n\r\n\"That grave?\" he said at last, with silken softness. \"It's the grave\r\nof a jungle savage. He died in the interest of science. As for you,\r\nyou'll leave here when I bid you, and not before, understand? I've a\r\nguardian outside that would tear both of you limb from limb.\"\r\n\r\nBut Bentley caught and held fast to certain words the scientist had\r\nspoken.\r\n\r\n\"The savage died in the interest of science?\" he said. \"What do you\r\nmean?\"\r\n\r\nBarter smiled his red-lipped smile.\r\n\r\n\"I took the savage and Manape, who wasn't called Manape then, and\r\nadministered an anesthetic of my own invention. You've heard that I\r\nwas a master of trephining? No matter if you haven't heard, the whole\r\nworld will know soon! While the native and the ape were under\r\nanesthesia I transferred their brains. I put the black man's brain in\r\nthe skull pan of the ape, and the ape's brain in that of the savage.\r\nThe ape lived--and he is Manape. The savage, with the ape's brain,\r\ndied, and I buried him in that grave you asked about!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWith a cry of horror Bentley turned and fled from Barter as though the\r\nman had been His Satanic Majesty himself. He entered the room with\r\nEllen and barred the door behind him. He likewise barred the door\r\nwhich led to that other room. Now in total darkness it was all he\r\ncould do from clambering on the bed where Ellen slept, and begging her\r\nto touch him--anything--if only to prove to him that there still were\r\nsane creatures left in a mad world.\r\n\r\nOutside Barter laughed.\r\n\r\n\"Oh, Bentley,\" he called after a long interval of silence, \"do you\r\nlike the odor of violets? Goodnight, and pleasant dreams!\"\r\n\r\nWhat had Barter meant?\r\n\r\nAgain assuring himself that the connecting door could not be opened if\r\nanything or anybody tried to enter that way, Bentley flung himself\r\ndown before the door which gave on the reception room. He had no\r\nintention of sleeping. But in spite of himself he dozed off, though he\r\nfought against sleep with all his will.\r\n\r\nStrange, but as he gradually slipped away into unconsciousness he was\r\ncognizant of the odor of violets--like invisible tentacles which\r\nreached through the very door and wrapped themselves gently about him.\r\n\r\nHis last conscious thought was of Manape, the ape with the brain of a\r\njungle savage. But in spite of the vague feeling of horror he could\r\nnot fight off the desire for sleep.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n_Grim Awakening_\r\n\r\nBentley returned to consciousness with a dull headache. He rose to a\r\nsitting posture and looked dully about him. Dimwittedly he tried to\r\nrecall all that had passed since he had last been awake. He knew he\r\nhad gone to sleep under the door in the room where Ellen had slept.\r\nYet he was not there now. He peered about him.\r\n\r\nHe recognized the room.\r\n\r\nYonder was the table where they had eaten last night, or yesterday\r\nafternoon. Yonder was the bed he guessed Barter customarily used, and\r\nhe shuddered a little as he fancied a man sleeping in the same room\r\nwith that ghastly travesty which was neither ape nor human--Manape.\r\nThe creature's name was simple, being simply \"man\" and \"ape\" joined\r\ntogether to fit the creature perfectly--too perfectly. Barter's bed\r\nhad been slept in, but Barter was nowhere to be seen. Where was he?\r\nHow came Bentley in this room? Barter had forbidden him to enter the\r\nplace at all, on any pretext whatever. Had he walked in his sleep,\r\ndrawn by some freak of his subconscious mind into the room of Manape?\r\n\r\nSlowly, afraid to look yet forced by something outside himself, he\r\nturned his eyes toward the corner where the beast's cage was.\r\n\r\nThe cage was empty!\r\n\r\nThe door of it was open!\r\n\r\nStunned by his discovery, wondering what had happened during the\r\nnight, Bentley looked about him. He noticed the long narrow table at\r\nthe end of the cage, and the white covering it bore. He recognized it\r\ninstantly as an operating table, and wondered afresh.\r\n\r\nWhere was Barter?\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBentley raised his voice to shout the scientist's name. But before he\r\ncould himself recognize the syllables of the scientist's name, through\r\nthe whole room rang the bellowing challenge of a giant anthropoid ape.\r\nBentley cowered down fearfully and looked around him. Where was the\r\nape that had uttered that frightful noise? The sound had broken in\r\nthat very room, yet save for himself the room was empty.\r\n\r\nBentley turned his head as he heard someone fumbling with the door.\r\n\r\nBarter entered, and his face was a study as his eyes met those of\r\nBentley. Bentley noticed that Barter held that whip in his hand,\r\nuncoiled and ready for action.\r\n\r\nWhat was this that Barter was saying?\r\n\r\n\"I warn you, Bentley, that if anything happens to me you are doomed.\r\nIf I am killed it means a horrible end for you.\"\r\n\r\nBentley tried to answer him, tried to speak, but something appeared to\r\nhave gone wrong with his vocal cords, so that all that came from his\r\nlips was a senseless gibberish that meant nothing at all. He recalled\r\nthe odor of violets, Barter's enigmatic good-night utterance with\r\nreference to violets, and wondered if their odor, stealing into the\r\nroom where he had gone on guard over Ellen, had had anything to do\r\nwith paralyzing his powers of speech.\r\n\r\n\"I see you haven't discovered, Bentley,\" said Barter after a moment of\r\nsearching inspection of Bentley. \"Look at yourself!\"\r\n\r\nSurprised at this puzzling command, Bentley slowly looked down at his\r\nchest. It was broad and hairy, huge as a mighty barrel, and his arms\r\nhung to the floor, the hands half closed as though they grasped\r\nsomething. Horror held Bentley mute for a moment. Then he raised his\r\neyes to Barter, to note that the scientist was smiling and rubbing his\r\nhands with immense satisfaction.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBentley started across the floor toward a mirror near Barter's bed. He\r\nrefused to let his numbed brain dwell upon the instant recognition of\r\nhis manner of progress. For he moved across the floor with a peculiar\r\nrolling gait, aiding his stride with the bent knuckles of his hands\r\npressed against the floor.\r\n\r\nHe fought against the horror that gripped him. He feared to look into\r\nthe mirror, yet knew that he must. He reached it, reared to his full\r\nheight, and gazed into the glass--at the reflection of Manape, the\r\ngreat ape of the cage!\r\n\r\nInstantly a murderous fury possessed him. He whirled on Barter, to\r\nscream out at the man, to beg him to explain what had happened, why\r\nthis ghastly hallucination gripped him. But all he could do was\r\nbellow, and smash his mighty chest with his fists, so that the sound\r\nwent crashing out across the jungle--to be answered almost at once by\r\nthe drumming of other mighty anthropoids outside, beyond the clearing\r\nwhich held the awful cabin of Caleb Barter.\r\n\r\nHe started toward Barter, still bellowing and beating his chest. His\r\none desire was to clutch the scientist and tear him limb from limb,\r\nand he knew that his mighty arms were capable of ripping the scientist\r\napart as though Barter had been a fly.\r\n\r\n\"Back, you fool!\" snarled Barter. \"Back, I say!\"\r\n\r\nThe long lash of the whip cracked like a revolver shot, and the lash\r\ncurled about the chest and neck of Bentley. It ripped and tore like a\r\nhot iron. It struck again and again. Bentley could not stand the awful\r\nbeating the scientist was giving him. In spite of all his power he\r\nfound himself being forced back and back.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe stepped into the cage, cowered back against its side. Barter darted\r\nin close, shut the door and fastened it. Then he stood against the\r\nbars, grinning.\r\n\r\n\"Nod your head if you can understand me, Bentley,\" he said.\r\n\r\nBentley nodded.\r\n\r\n\"I told you I would yet prove to the world the greatness of Caleb\r\nBarter,\" said the scientist. \"And you will bear witness that what I\r\nhave to tell is true. Would you like to know what I have done?\"\r\n\r\nAgain, slowly and laboriously, Bentley nodded his shaggy head.\r\n\r\nBarter grinned.\r\n\r\n\"Wonderful!\" he said. \"You see, you are now Manape. Yesterday you had\r\nthe brain of a black man, and to exchange your brain with Manape's of\r\nyesterday would not have served my purpose in the least. So I had to\r\nfind an ape of more than average intelligence. That's why I spent so\r\nmuch time in the jungle yesterday. I needed a brain to put in the body\r\nof Lee Bentley's--an ape's brain. Your body is a healthy one and I did\r\nnot think it would die as the savage's did. I was right. It is doing\r\nsplendidly. It would interest you to see how your body behaves with an\r\nape's brain to direct it. Your other self, whom I call Apeman, is\r\nunusually handsome. Miss Estabrook, however, who does not know what\r\nhas happened, has taken a strange dislike to the other you! Splendid!\r\nI shall study reactions at first hand that will astound the world!\r\n\r\n\"But remember, whatever your fine brain dictates that you do, don't\r\never forget that I am the only living person who can put you to rights\r\nagain--and if I die before that happens, you will continue on, till\r\nyou die, as Manape!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBarter stopped there. Bentley stiffened.\r\n\r\nFrom the room where he knew Ellen Estabrook to be came her voice,\r\nraised high in a shout of fear.\r\n\r\n\"Lee! Please! I can't understand you. Please don't touch me! Your eyes\r\nburn me--please go away. What in the world has come over you?\"\r\n\r\nBentley listened for the reply of the creature he knew was in the\r\nother room with Ellen Estabrook.\r\n\r\nBut the answer was a gurgling gibberish that made no sense at all! His\r\nown body, directed by the brain of an ape, could not emit speech that\r\nEllen could understand, because the ape could not speak. The ape's\r\nvocal cords, which now were Bentley's, were incapable of speech.\r\n\r\nHow, if Barter continued to keep Ellen in ignorance of what had\r\nhappened, would she ever know the horrible truth--and realize the\r\ndanger that threatened her?\r\n\r\n\"Don't worry for the moment, Bentley,\" said Barter with a smile. \"I am\r\nnot yet ready for your other self to go to undue lengths--though I\r\ndislike intensely to leave the marks of my whip on that handsome body\r\nof yours!\"\r\n\r\nBarter slipped from the room.\r\n\r\nBentley listened, amazed at the clarity with which he heard every\r\nvagrant little sound--until he remembered again that his hearing was\r\nthat of a jungle beast--until he knew that Barter had entered that\r\nother room.\r\n\r\nThen came the crackling reports of the whip, wielded mightily by the\r\nhands of Barter.\r\n\r\nA scream that was half human, half animal, was the result of the\r\nlashing. Bentley cringed as he imagined the bite of that lash which he\r\nhimself had experienced but a few moments before.\r\n\r\n\"Professor Barter! Professor Barter!\" distinctly came the voice of\r\nEllen Estabrook. \"Don't! Don't! He didn't mean anything, I am sure. He\r\nis sick, something dreadful has happened to him. But he wouldn't\r\nreally hurt me. He couldn't--not really. Stop, please! Don't strike\r\nhim again!\"\r\n\r\nBut the sound of the lash continued.\r\n\r\n\"Stop, I tell you!\" Ellen's voice rose to a cry of agonized entreaty.\r\n\"Don't strike him again. See, you've ripped his flesh until he is\r\ncovered with blood! Strike me if you must strike someone--for with\r\nall my heart and soul I love him!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n_Fumbling Hands_\r\n\r\nNow Bentley was beginning to realize to the full the horrible thing\r\nthat had befallen himself and Ellen Estabrook. He knew something else,\r\ntoo. It had come to him when he had heard Ellen's words next\r\ndoor--telling Barter that she loved the creature Barter was beating,\r\nwhich she thought was Lee Bentley. That creature was Lee Bentley; but\r\nonly the earthly casement of Lee Bentley. The ruling power of\r\nBentley's body, the driving force which actuated his body, was the\r\nbrain of an ape.\r\n\r\nAs for Bentley himself, that part of him of which he thought when he\r\nthought of \"I,\" to all intents and purposes, to all outer seeming, had\r\nbecome an ape. His body was an ape's body, his legs were an ape's,\r\neverything about him was simian save one thing--the \"ego,\" that\r\nsomething by which man knows that he is himself, with an individual\r\nidentity. That was buried behind the almost non-existent brow of an\r\nape.\r\n\r\nIn all things save one he was an ape. That thing was \"Bentley's\"\r\nbrain. In all things save one that creature in the room with Ellen\r\nEstabrook was Bentley. Bentley, driven to mad behavior by the brain of\r\nan ape!\r\n\r\nThe horror of it tore at Bentley, as he still thought of himself.\r\n\r\n\"If I were to get out of this cage,\" he told himself voicelessly, \"and\r\nwere to enter that room with Ellen, she would cower into a corner in\r\nterror. She would fly to the arms of that travesty of 'me,' for she\r\nthinks it is 'I' in there with her because it _looks_ like me.\"\r\n\r\nNow that Ellen was beyond his reach, more beyond his reach than if she\r\nhad been dead, he realized how much she meant to him. In the few mad\r\nhours of their association they had come to belong to each other with\r\na possessiveness that was beyond words. Thinking then that the\r\ntravesty in there with her--with Bentley's body--was really Bentley,\r\nto what lengths might she not be persuaded in her love? It was a\r\nghastly thing to contemplate.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut what could Bentley do? He could not speak to her. If he tried she\r\nwould race from him in terror at the bellowing ferocity of his voice.\r\nHow could he tell her his love when his voice was such as to frighten\r\nthe very wild beasts of the jungle?\r\n\r\nYet....\r\n\r\nHow could he allow her to remain with that other Bentley--that body\r\nwhich perhaps was provided with a man's appetites, and the brain of a\r\nbeast which knew nothing of honor and took what it wished if it were\r\nstrong enough?\r\n\r\nThere was one ray of hope in that Barter had hinted he would protect\r\nEllen from the apeman. That meant physically, with all that might\r\nindicate; but who could compensate her for the horror she must be\r\nexperiencing with that speechless imbecile she thought was Bentley? If\r\nthis thing were to continue indefinitely, and Ellen were kept in\r\nignorance, she would eventually grow to hate the \"thing\"--and if ever,\r\nas he had hinted, Barter were to transfer back the entities of the man\r\nand the ape, Ellen would always shudder with horrible memories when\r\nshe looked at the man she had just now admitted she loved.\r\n\r\nBentley was becoming calmer now. He knew exactly what he faced, and\r\nthere was no way out until Barter should be satisfied with his mad\r\nexperiment. Bentley must go through with whatever was in store for\r\nhim. So must the ape who possessed his body--and in the very nature\r\nof things unless Bentley could train himself to a self-saving\r\ndocility, both bodies would repeatedly know the fiery stinging of that\r\nlash of Barter's. Bentley could control himself after a fashion. The\r\nape might be cowed, but long before that time arrived, Bentley's body\r\nwould be made to suffer marks they would bear forever to remind him of\r\nthis horror.\r\n\r\n\"I must somehow manage to continue to care for Ellen,\" he told\r\nhimself. \"But how?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe scarcely realized that his great hands were wandering over his\r\nbody, scratching, scratching. But when he did realize he felt sick,\r\nwithout being able to understand how or where he felt sick. If he felt\r\nsick at the stomach he thought of it as his own stomach. When he\r\nthought of moving the hairy hands he thought of his hands. He grinned\r\nto himself--never realizing the horrible grimace which crossed his\r\nface, though there was none to see it--when he recalled how men of his\r\nacquaintance during the Great War, had complained of aching toes at\r\nthe end of legs that had been amputated!\r\n\r\nHe was learning one thing--that the brain is everything that matters.\r\nThe seat of pain and pleasure, of joy and of sorrow, of hunger and of\r\nthirst even.\r\n\r\nBentley waddled to the door of the cage. He studied the lock which\r\nheld him prisoner, and noted how close he must hold his face to see at\r\nall. All apes might be near-sighted as far as he knew; but he did know\r\nthat this one was. Perhaps he could free himself.\r\n\r\nHe tried to force his massive hands to the task of investigating the\r\nlock. But what an effort! It was like trying to hypnotize a subject\r\nthat did not wish to be hypnotized. A distinct effort of will, like\r\ntrying to force someone to turn and look by staring at the back of\r\nthat someone's neck in a crowd. It was like trying to make an entirely\r\ndifferent person move his arm, or his leg, merely by willing that he\r\nmove it.\r\n\r\nBut the great arms, which might have weighed tons, though Bentley\r\nsensed no strain, raised to the door and fumbled dumbly, clumsily. He\r\ntried to close the gnarled fingers, whose backs were covered with the\r\nrough hair, to manipulate the lock, but he succeeded merely in\r\nfumbling--like a baby senselessly tugging at its father's fingers, the\r\nexistence of which had no shape or form in the baby's brain.\r\n\r\nBut he strove with all his will to force those clumsy hands to do his\r\nbidding. They slipped from the lock, went back again, fumbled over it,\r\nfell away.\r\n\r\n\"You must!\" muttered Bentley. \"You must, you must!\"\r\n\r\nHe would discover the secret of the lock, so that he would be able to\r\nremove it when the time was right--but so slow and uncertain and\r\nclumsy were the movements of his ape hands, he was in mortal fear that\r\nhe would unlock the door and then not be able to lock it again, and\r\nBarter would discover what he had in mind.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut he struggled on, while foul smelling sweat poured from his mighty\r\nbody and dripped to the floor. He concentrated on the lock with all\r\nhis power, knowing as he did so that the lock would have been but a\r\nsimple problem for a child of six or seven. It was nothing more than a\r\nbar held in place with a leather thong. But the powerful fingers which\r\nnow were Bentley's were too blunt and inflexible to master the knot\r\nBarter had left.\r\n\r\nBentley paused to listen.\r\n\r\nFrom Ellen's room came the sound of weeping. From the front room came\r\nBarter's pleased laughter as he talked with the thing which so much\r\nresembled Bentley. That was a relief--to know that his other self had\r\nbeen at least temporarily removed from any possibility of injuring\r\nEllen.\r\n\r\nIn Bentley's mind were certain pictures of Barter. He saw him plainly\r\non his knees begging for mercy, while Bentley's ape hands choked his\r\nlife away. He saw him tossed about like a mere child, and casually\r\ntorn apart, ripped limb from limb by the mighty hands of Manape.\r\n\r\n\"God,\" he told himself, refusing to listen to the slobbering gibberish\r\nwhich came from his thick lips when he addressed himself, \"I can do\r\nnothing to Barter--not until he restores me properly. If he is slain,\r\nit is the end for me, and for Ellen! He is a master, no doubt of that.\r\nHe anesthetized me through the door with something of his own\r\nmanufacture that smelled like violets, and put my brain in Manape\r\nafter removing from Manape the brain of the savage. Then he removed an\r\nape's brain from a second ape and put it in my skull pan--all within\r\nthe space of a few hours! Yet his knowledge of surgery and medicine is\r\nsuch that even in so short a time I suffer little from the operation,\r\nsave for the dull headache which I had on awakening, and which I now\r\nscarcely feel at all.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe straightened, close against the bars, and began again to fumble\r\nwith the leather thong which held him prisoner. In his brain was the\r\nhazy idea that he might after all make a break for it, and carry Ellen\r\naway to a place of safety, taking a chance on finding his way back\r\nhere to force Barter to operate again and restore him to his proper\r\nplace. But would not Ellen die of fright at being borne away through\r\nthe jungle in the arms of an ape? Was there any possibility of forcing\r\nBarter to perform the operation? No, for under the anesthetic again,\r\nBarter, angered by the thwarting of whatever purpose actuated him,\r\nmight do something even worse than he had done--if that were possible.\r\nAgain, even if he reached civilisation with Ellen, every human hand\r\nwould be turned against him. Rifles would hurl their lead into him.\r\nHunters would pursue him....\r\n\r\nNo, it was impossible.\r\n\r\nBentley, Ellen, and the Apeman--his own body, ape-brained--were but\r\npawns in the hands of Barter. Barter might be actuated by a desire to\r\nserve science, that science which was alike his tool and his god.\r\nBentley scarcely doubted that Barter believed himself specially\r\nordained to do this thing, in the name of science; probably,\r\nunquestionably, felt himself entirely justified.\r\n\r\nPlainly, now that Bentley recalled things Barter had said, Barter had\r\nwaited for an opportunity of this kind--had waited for someone to be\r\ntossed into his net--and Ellen and Lee, flotsam of the sea, had come\r\nin answer to the prayer for whose answer Barter had waited.\r\n\r\nIt was horrible, yet there was nothing they could do--at least, to\r\nfree themselves--until it pleased Barter to take the step. It came\r\nthen to Bentley how precious to them both was the life of Caleb\r\nBarter. He could restore Bentley or destroy him--and with him the\r\nwoman who loved him.\r\n\r\nSuppose, came Bentley's sudden thought, Barter should think of\r\nperforming a like operation on Ellen--using in the transfer the brain\r\nof a female ape? God!...\r\n\r\nHe prayed that the thought would never come to Barter. He was afraid\r\nto dwell upon it lest Barter read his thought. He might think of it\r\nnaturally, as a simple corollary to what he had already done. Bentley\r\nthen must do something before Barter planned some new madness.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe sat back and bellowed savagely, beating his chest with his mighty\r\nhands.\r\n\r\nInstantly the outer door opened and Barter came in.\r\n\r\nBentley ceased his bellowing and chest pounding and sat docilely\r\nthere, staring into the eyes of Barter.\r\n\r\n\"Have you discovered there is no use opposing me, Bentley?\" said the\r\nprofessor softly.\r\n\r\nBentley nodded his shaggy head. Then by a superhuman effort of will he\r\nraised the right arm of Manape and pointed. He could not point the\r\nforefinger, but he could point the arm--and look in the direction he\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\n\"You want to come out and go into the front room?\"\r\n\r\nBentley nodded.\r\n\r\n\"You will make no attempt to injure me?\"\r\n\r\nBentley shook his head ponderously from side to side.\r\n\r\n\"You would like to see the Apeman?--the creature that looks so much\r\nlike you that it will be like peering at yourself in the mirror? Or,\r\nrather, as it would have been yesterday had you looked into a mirror?\"\r\n\r\nBentley nodded slowly.\r\n\r\n\"You understand that no matter what the Apeman does, you must not try\r\nto slay him?\"\r\n\r\nBentley did not move.\r\n\r\n\"You understand if you destroy Apeman's body, you are doomed to remain\r\nManape forever, because the true body of Lee Bentley will die and be\r\neventually destroyed?\"\r\n\r\nBentley nodded. He felt a trickle of moisture on the rough skin about\r\nhis flaring nostrils and knew that he was weeping, soundlessly.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut there was no pity in the face of Barter. He was the scientist who\r\nstudied his science, to whom it was the breath of life, and he saw\r\nnothing, thought of nothing, not directly connected with his\r\n\"experiment.\"\r\n\r\n\"You give me your word of honor as a gentleman not to oppose me?\"\r\n\r\nIt was odd, an almost superhumanly intellectual scientist asking for\r\nan ape's word of honor, but that did not occur to Bentley at the\r\nmoment, as he nodded his head.\r\n\r\nBarter still held his lash poised. He unfastened the leather thong\r\nwhich held Bentley prisoner and swung wide the door. Then he turned\r\nhis back on Bentley and led the way to the door.\r\n\r\nBentley followed him on mighty feet and bent knuckles into the room\r\nwhich had first received Lee and Ellen when they had entered the cabin\r\nof the scientist.\r\n\r\nBentley would have gasped had he been capable of gasping at what he\r\nsaw.\r\n\r\nIn a far corner, cowering down in fear at sight of Barter and his\r\ncoiled whip--was the Bentley of the mirror in his stateroom aboard the\r\n_Bengal Queen_, and before that.\r\n\r\nIt was an uncanny sensation, to stand off and peer at himself thus.\r\n\r\nYonder was Bentley, yet _here_ was Bentley, too.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen he noted the difference. The face of that Bentley yonder was\r\ntwisted, savage. _That_ Bentley had seen Manape, and the teeth were\r\nexposed in a snarl of savage hatred. There a man ape stared at another\r\nman ape, and bared his fangs in challenge. The white hands of Bentley\r\nbegan to beat the white chest of Bentley--to beat the chest savagely,\r\nuntil the white skin was red as blood....\r\n\r\nThe Bentley buried within the mighty carcass of an anthropoid ape\r\nwatched and shuddered. That thing yonder was dressed only in a\r\nbreech-clout, and the fair flesh was criss-crossed in scores of places\r\nwith bleeding wounds left by the lash of Barter. The Apeman's brows\r\nwere furrowed in concentration. The human body made ape-like\r\nmovements.\r\n\r\nBentley knew that soon that creature, forgetting everything save that\r\nhe faced a rival man ape, would charge and attempt to measure the\r\npower of Manape--fang against fang. The white form rose.\r\n\r\nBarter caused his whiplash to crack like an explosion.\r\n\r\n\"One moment,\" he said. \"Back, Apeman! I'll bring Miss Estabrook.\r\nPerhaps she can placate you. She has a strange power over you both!\"\r\n\r\nBentley would have cried out as Barter crossed to unlock Ellen's door,\r\nbut he knew that he could not stop Barter, and that his cry would\r\nsimply be a terrible bellow to frighten the woman he loved when she\r\nentered the room.\r\n\r\nThe door opened. White, shaken, her eyes deep wells of terror, circled\r\nwith blue rings which told the effect of the horror she had\r\nexperienced, Ellen Estabrook entered.\r\n\r\nAnd screamed with terror as she saw the hulking figure of Manape.\r\nScreamed with terror and rushed to the arms of the cowering thing in\r\nthe corner!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n_Puppets of Barter_\r\n\r\nThe thing that Barter then contrived was destined to remain forever in\r\nthe memory of Bentley as the most ghastly thing he had ever\r\nexperienced. Ellen hurried into the arms of that thing in the corner.\r\nGropingly, protectively, the white arms encompassed her. But they were\r\nawkward, uncertain, and Bentley was minded of a female ape or monkey\r\nholding her young against her hairy bosom.\r\n\r\nBarter turned toward Bentley and smiled. He rubbed his hands together\r\nwith satisfaction.\r\n\r\n\"A success so far, my experiment,\" he said. \"The human body still\r\nanswers to primal urges, which are closely enough allied to those of\r\nour simian cousins that their outward manifestations--manual gestures,\r\nexpressions in the eyes et cetera--are much the same. When the two are\r\ncombined the action approximates humanness!\"\r\n\r\nThat travesty yonder pressed its face against Ellen, and she drew\r\nback, her eyes wide as they met those of the white figure which held\r\nher.\r\n\r\n\"I am all right,\" she managed, \"please don't hold me so tightly.\"\r\n\r\nShe tried to struggle away, but Apeman held her helpless.\r\n\r\n\"Barter,\" yelled Bentley, \"take her away from that thing! How can you\r\ndo such a horrible thing?\"\r\n\r\nAt least those were the words he intended to shout, but the sound that\r\ncame from his lips was the bellowing of a man ape. That other thing\r\nyonder answered his bellow, bared white teeth in a bestial snarl.\r\nBarter turned to Bentley, however.\r\n\r\n\"You want me to take her away from Bentley and give her to you?\"\r\n\r\nBentley nodded.\r\n\r\nHis bellowing attempt at speech had sent Ellen closer into the arms of\r\nBentley's other self--henceforth to be known as Apeman. Bentley had\r\ndefeated his own purpose by his bellow.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\"Miss Estabrook,\" said Barter softly, \"nothing will happen to you if\r\nyou stand clear of your sweetheart....\"\r\n\r\nNausea gripped Bentley as he heard Apeman referred to as Ellen's\r\nsweetheart, but now he remembered to refrain from attempting speech.\r\n\r\n\"But,\" went on Barter, \"Manape has taken a violent dislike to Bentley,\r\nand may attack him if you do not stand clear. Manape likes you, you\r\nknow. You probably sensed that last evening?\"\r\n\r\nEllen visibly shuddered. She patted the shoulder of Apeman and\r\nstepped away, toward a chair which Barter thrust toward her.\r\n\r\nShe pressed her hands to her throbbing temples, visibly fighting to\r\ncontrol herself. Her whole body was trembling as with the ague.\r\n\r\n\"Professor Barter,\" she said at last. \"I am terribly confused, and\r\nmost awfully frightened. What has happened here? What dreadful thing\r\nhas so awfully changed Lee? I talk to him and he answers nothing that\r\nI understand. Is it some weird fever? At this moment I have the\r\nfeeling that that brute Manape understands more perfectly than Lee,\r\nand the idea is horrible! I love Lee, Professor. See, he hears me say\r\nit, yet I cannot tell from his expression what he thinks. Does he\r\ndespise me for so freely admitting my love? Has he any feeling about\r\nit at all? Has his mind completely gone?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Barter, with a semblance of a smile on his lips, \"his mind\r\nhas completely gone. But it is only temporary, my dear. You forget\r\nthat I am perhaps the world's greatest living medical man, and that I\r\ncan do things no other man can do. I shall restore Lee wholly to\r\nyou--when the time comes. It is not well to hasten things in cases of\r\nthis kind. One never knows but that great harm may be done.\"\r\n\r\n\"But I can nurse him. I can care for him and love him, and help to\r\nmake him well.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBarter looked away from Ellen, his eyes apparently focussed on a spot\r\nsomewhere in the air between Apeman and Manape.\r\n\r\n\"Would that be satisfactory to Bentley, I wonder?\" he said musingly,\r\nyet Bentley recognized it as a question addressed to him. Bentley\r\nlooked at the girl, but her eyes were fixed--alight with love which\r\nwas still filled with questioning--on Apeman. Bentley shook his head,\r\nand Barter laughed a little.\r\n\r\n\"You know, Miss Estabrook,\" he went on, \"that a strange malady like\r\nthat which appears to have attacked Lee Bentley should be studied\r\ncarefully, in order that the observations of a savant may be given to\r\nthe world so that such maladies may be effectually combatted in\r\nfuture. This is one reason why I do not hasten.\"\r\n\r\n\"But you are using a sick man as you would use a rabbit in a\r\nlaboratory experiment!\" she cried. \"Can't you see that there are\r\nthings not even you should do? Don't you understand that some things\r\nshould be left entirely in the hands of God?\"\r\n\r\n\"I do not concede that!\" retorted Barter. \"God makes terrible mistakes\r\nsometimes--as witness cretins, mongoloid idiots, criminals, and the\r\nlike. I know about these things better than you do, my dear, and you\r\nmust trust me.\"\r\n\r\n\"Oh, if I only knew what was right. Poor Lee. You lashed him so, and\r\nhis body is awful with the scars. Was that necessary?\"\r\n\r\n\"Insane persons are not to blame for their insanity,\" said Barter\r\nsoothingly. \"Yet sometimes they must be handled roughly to prevent\r\nthem from causing loss of life, their own or others.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow the eyes of Ellen came to rest on Manape.\r\n\r\nThey were fear filled at first, especially when she discovered that\r\nthe little red eyes of Manape were upon her. But she did not turn her\r\neyes away, nor did Manape. She seemed dazed, unable to orient herself,\r\nunable to distinguish the proper mode of action.\r\n\r\n\"That ape in repose is almost human,\" she said wearily, her brow\r\npuckered as though she sought the answer to some unspoken question\r\nthat eluded her. \"I am not afraid of him at this moment, yet I know\r\nthat in a second he can become an invincible brute, capable of tearing\r\nus all limb from limb.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not so long as I have this whip,\" said Barter grimly. \"But Manape is\r\ndocile at the moment, and it is Bentley who is ferocious.\"\r\n\r\nApeman was still snarling at Manape, lending point to Barter's\r\nstatement. Barter went on.\r\n\r\n\"You know,\" he said, \"apes are almost human in many respects. Manape\r\nlikes you, and I doubt if he would attempt to hurt you. If he knew\r\nthat you cared for Bentley there, he would most assuredly try to be\r\nfriendly to Bentley also. Perhaps you can manage it. Apes are capable\r\nof primitive reasoning, you know. Go to Manape. He won't injure you,\r\nat least while I am here. Stroke him. He will like it. He is a friend\r\nworth having, never fear, and one never knows when one may need a\r\nfriend--or what sort of friend one may need.\"\r\n\r\nEllen hesitated, and her face whitened again.\r\n\r\nBarter went on.\r\n\r\n\"Go ahead. It is necessary that Manape and Bentley remain here\r\ntogether for a time. Manape will be locked up, but if he happens to\r\nbreak loose there is nothing he might not do. With Bentley in the\r\ncondition he is he would be no match for Manape. But if Manape thought\r\nyou desired his friendship for Bentley...?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere he left it, while Bentley wondered what new horror Barter was\r\nplanning. He yearned for Ellen to come to him. But, if he strode\r\ntoward her now, how would Barter explain that Manape had understood\r\nhis words? No, Ellen must take the step, and each one would be\r\nhesitant, as she fought against her natural revulsion at touching this\r\ngreat shaggy creature which was Manape to her, and Bentley to himself.\r\n\r\nSlowly, almost against her will, Ellen rose and moved across the floor\r\ntoward Bentley. Apeman growled ominously. He rose to his feet, his\r\narms writhing like disjoined, broken-backed snakes across his scarred\r\nchest.\r\n\r\nApeman took a step forward. Barter did not notice, apparently, for he\r\nwas watching Manape as Ellen approached.\r\n\r\nShe came quite close. Slowly she put forth her hand to touch the\r\nshaggy shoulder of Manape. Bentley, seeking some way, _any_ way, to\r\nreassure her, put his great shaggy right arm about her waist for the\r\nmerest second.\r\n\r\nThen Apeman charged, bellowing a shrill crescendo that was half human,\r\nhalf simian.\r\n\r\nBefore Bentley could realize Apeman's intentions, Apeman had clutched\r\nEllen about the waist and dashed for the door of the cabin. He was\r\ngone, racing across the clearing with swift strides, bearing the girl\r\nwith him.\r\n\r\nBentley whirled to pursue, but Barter had beaten him to the door and\r\nnow blocked it, whiplash writhing, twisting, curling to strike.\r\n\r\n\"Back, Bentley! Back, I say! In a moment you may follow--as part of my\r\nexperiment. But remember--the end must be here in this cabin, and you\r\nmust remember everything, so that you can tell me all--when you are\r\nrestored!\"\r\n\r\nBentley cowered under the lash. His whole shaggy body trembled\r\nfrightfully.\r\n\r\nFrom the jungle toward which Apeman was racing come the roaring\r\nchallenge of half a dozen anthropoids.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n_Lord of the Jungle_\r\n\r\nApeman, never realizing that his actual strength was that of but a\r\npuny human being, was racing with Ellen Estabrook into the very midst\r\nof animals which would tear him to bits as easily as they would tear\r\nany human being to pieces. Apeman, being but an ape after all, would\r\nmerely think that he was joining his own kind, bearing with him a mate\r\nwith white skin.\r\n\r\nBut to the other apes he would be a human being, a puny hairless\r\nimitation of themselves which they would pounce upon and tear asunder\r\nwith great glee. Apeman would not know this: would not realize his\r\nlimitations. He would try to take to the upper terraces of the jungle,\r\nto swing from tree to tree, carrying his mate--and would find the body\r\nof Bentley incapable of supporting such an effort. Apeman would be a\r\nchild in the hands of his brethren, who could not know him. Apeman\r\ncould probably speak to them after a fashion, but his gibberish would\r\ncome strangely perhaps unintelligibly, through the mouth of Bentley.\r\nThey would suspect him, and destroy him, and with him Ellen Estabrook,\r\nunless other apes discovered also her sex and took her, fighting over\r\nher among themselves.\r\n\r\nBentley made good time across the jungle clearing. Behind him came the\r\nvoice of Barter in final exhortation.\r\n\r\n\"Your human cunning, hampered by your simian body, pitted against the\r\nhighly specialized body of your former self, in turn hampered by the\r\nlack of reasoning of an ape--in a contest in primitive surrounding for\r\na female! A glorious experiment, and all depends now upon you! You\r\nwill save the girl who loves you and whom you love, but you must\r\nreturn to me and be transferred before you can make your love known. I\r\nshall wait for you!\"\r\n\r\nIn Bentley's brain the shouted words of Barter rang as he hurried into\r\nthe jungle in pursuit of Apeman. Ellen Estabrook was crying: \"Hurry,\r\nLee, hurry!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYet she was really yelling to Apeman, the man-beast which carried her,\r\nbidding him race on to escape the pursuit of Manape, in whom she\r\nwould never recognize the man she loved. She must have thought that\r\nBentley had taken a desperate chance to escape the clutches of Barter,\r\nand that Barter had set his trained ape to pursue them. What else\r\ncould she think? How could she know that she was actually in the power\r\nof an ape, and that her loved one actually pursued to save her? With\r\nevery desire of her body she was urging Apeman to take her away from\r\nManape. But she must also have heard the challenges of the man apes in\r\nthe jungle ahead. She was looking back over Apeman's shoulder,\r\nwondering perhaps if Barter would again come out to save them from the\r\nanthropoids.\r\n\r\nBentley could guess at her thoughts as he raced on in pursuit of\r\nApeman.\r\n\r\nWould he be in time? Even if he were, Apeman himself would turn\r\nagainst him. If he were to try to aid Ellen she would fight against\r\nhim, believing him an ape. And how could he fight? Would his brain be\r\nable to direct his mighty arms and his fighting fangs in a battle with\r\nthe apes of the jungle?\r\n\r\nAs he thought of coming to grips with the apes on equal terms,\r\nsomething never in this world before vouchsafed to a human being, he\r\nfelt a fierce exaltation upon him. He felt a desire to take part in\r\nmortal combat with them, to fight them fist and fang, and to destroy\r\nthem, one by one. He had their strength and more--he had the cunning\r\nof a human being to match against the dim wits of the apes. He had a\r\nchance.\r\n\r\nBut he must protect not only Ellen, but Apeman. Both Ellen and Apeman\r\nwould be against him. Ellen would fear him as an ape that desired her.\r\nApeman would fight against him as a rival for the favors of a she....\r\n\r\nAnd he must harm neither. His own body, which Apeman directed, must\r\nbe spared, must be kept alive--while every effort of Apeman would be\r\nto force Bentley to slay!\r\n\r\nIt was a predicament which--well, only Caleb Barter had foreseen it.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe bellowing of the apes was a continuous roar on all sides now.\r\nBentley felt a fierce sensation of joy welling up within him and he\r\nanswered their bellowing with savage bellows of his own. His legs were\r\nobeying his will. His knuckles touched the ground as he raced on all\r\nfours.\r\n\r\nHe could hear the shriek of Ellen there ahead, and knew that Apeman\r\nand the girl were surrounded--that he must make all possible speed if\r\nhe were to be in time.\r\n\r\nApeman and his captive were on the trail, trapped there just as Apeman\r\nhad started into the jungle. Apeman had lifted Ellen so that her hands\r\nmight have grasped a limb; but the girl had refused to attempt to\r\nescape by the trees if her \"lover\" remained behind. She had crumpled\r\nto the ground, and Apeman, snarling, smashing his chest which was so\r\nsickly white as compared to the chests of the other apes, had turned\r\nupon his brethren. They hesitated for a moment as though amazed at the\r\neffrontery of this mere human.\r\n\r\nThen a man ape charged. Apeman met him with arms and fangs, and\r\nBentley saw Apeman's all too small mouth snap out for the vein in the\r\nneck of Apeman's attacker. The ape whose brain reposed in Apeman had\r\nbeen a courageous beast, that was plain. But he was fighting for his\r\nshe.\r\n\r\nAnd he did not know his limitations. Apeman was bowled over as though\r\nhe had been a blade of grass, and the great ape was crouched over him,\r\nnuzzling at his white flesh when Bentley-Manape arrived.\r\n\r\nWith a savage bellow, and with a mighty lunge, Bentley leaped upon\r\nthe attacker of Apeman. His arms obeyed him with more certainty now,\r\nperhaps because the matter was so vitally urgent. Bentley's brain knew\r\njiu-jitsu, boxing, ways of rough and tumble fighting of which the\r\ngreat apes had never learned, nor ever would learn.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe hurled himself upon the animal that was on the point of pulling\r\nApeman apart as though he had indeed been a fly, and literally\r\nflattened him against the ground. His mighty hands searched for the\r\nthroat of the great ape, while he instinctively pulled his stomach out\r\nof the way of possible disemboweling tactics on the part of his\r\nantagonist. But the great ape twisted from his grasp, struggled erect.\r\n\r\nAnd, amazed at what he was doing, surprised that he, Lee Bentley,\r\ncould even conceive of such a thing, he launched his attack with bared\r\nand glistening fangs straight at the throat of his enemy. His mouth\r\nclosed. His fangs ripped home--and the great ape whose throat he had\r\ntorn away, whose blood was salt on his slavering lips, was tossed\r\naside as an empty husk, to die convulsively, a dripping horror which\r\nwas humanlike in a ghastly fashion. Bentley felt like a murderer. Not\r\nlike a murderer, either, but like a man who has slain unavoidably--and\r\nhates himself for doing so.\r\n\r\nEllen was backed against the tree into which Apeman had tried to force\r\nher.\r\n\r\nApeman was up now, moving to stand beside her. Apeman had discovered\r\nthat he was not the invincible creature he had thought himself.\r\n\r\nBentley moved in closer to the two, as other apes charged upon him\r\nfrom both sides, smothering him, giving him no time. He was a\r\nstranger, seemingly, an upstart to be destroyed.\r\n\r\nAnd he was forced to fight them with all his ape strength and human\r\ncunning, while Apeman, whimpering, caught up Ellen and darted away\r\nwith her, straight into the jungle.\r\n\r\nFor Bentley this was a sort of respite. Ellen was not afraid to go\r\nwith Apeman, thinking him Bentley. The great apes were bent on\r\ndestroying this strange ape which had come into their midst and had\r\nalready destroyed one of their number, perhaps their leader.\r\n\r\nHe must be destroyed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBentley fought like a man possessed. His arms were gory with crimson\r\nfrom the slashing fangs of his enemies. His mouth was dripping with\r\nred foam as he slashed in turn, with deadly accuracy. A great arm\r\nclutched at the hair of his chest--and fell away again, broken in two\r\nplaces, as Bentley snapped it like a pipe stem because he knew\r\nleverages and was able to force his ape's body to obey the will of his\r\nhuman mind.\r\n\r\nOne ape whimpering, rolling away to lick at his wounds; whimpering\r\noddly like a baby that has burned its fingers. A great ape weighing\r\nhundreds of pounds, crying like a child! Yet that \"child,\" with his\r\narm unbroken, could have taken a grown man, no matter how much of a\r\ngiant, and torn him to pieces.\r\n\r\nTwo other apes were out of the fray, one dead, the other with only\r\nempty eye-sockets where his red-rimmed eyes had been.\r\n\r\nBentley guessed that Apeman had gone at least a mile into the jungle,\r\nheading directly away from the dwelling of Caleb Barter. He must get\r\nfree and pursue. There was nothing else he could do. If he were slain,\r\nEllen was doomed to a fate he dared not contemplate. Apeman would\r\nnever be accepted by the apes because to all outward seeming he was a\r\nman. His body would never stand the hardship of the jungle, yet Apeman\r\nwould never guess that, and would be slain. Bentley must prevent\r\nthat.\r\n\r\nHe must make sure that Apeman's body at least remained sufficiently\r\nhealthy that it could become his own again without the necessity of a\r\nlong sojourn in some hospital. Ellen must not be left alone with\r\nApeman, who was still an ape, running away with a she.\r\n\r\nA ghastly muddle.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow the apes broke away from Bentley. They broke in all direction into\r\nthe jungle. Some of them seemed on the trail of Apeman. One of them\r\ntook to the trees, swinging himself along with the speed of a running\r\nman, flying from limb to limb with no support save his hands.\r\n\r\nBentley stared after the fleeing ape, and then gave chase. He felt\r\nthat the ape was on the trail of Apeman. Bentley did not know that he\r\nhimself could follow the spoor of Apeman, for he had not yet analyzed\r\nall of his new capabilities. But while he was discovering, he would\r\nfollow something he could see--the fleeing ape, who would overhaul\r\nApeman as though Apeman were standing still.\r\n\r\nSo, in a manner of speaking, Bentley essayed his wings.\r\n\r\nHe took to the trees after the fleeing ape, and was amazed that his\r\ngreat arms worked with ease, that he swung from limb to limb as easily\r\nand as surely as the other apes. He climbed to the upper terrace,\r\nwhere view of the ground was entirely shut off. His eyes took note of\r\nlimbs capable of bearing his weight--after he had made one mistake\r\nthat might easily have proved costly. He had leaped to a limb that\r\nwould have supported Bentley of the _Bengal Queen_, but that was a\r\nmere twig under the weight of Manape. It broke and he fell, clutching\r\nfor support; and fate was kind to him in that he found it, and so\r\nclambered back and swung easily and swiftly along.\r\n\r\nIn his nostrils at intervals was a peculiar odor--a peculiarly human\r\nodor, reminding him of the work-sweat of a man who seldom bathed. He\r\nknew that for the odor of Apeman, and a thrill of exaltation\r\nencompassed him as he realized that he was following a spoor by the\r\ncunning of his nostrils.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was a great leap across space. The ape ahead of him made it with\r\nease. Bentley essayed it without hesitation, hurling himself into\r\nspace, all of a hundred feet above the ground; with all the might of\r\nhis arms--and almost overshot the mark, almost went crashing once more\r\nthrough the branches. But the tree swayed, and held, and Bentley went\r\nswinging on.\r\n\r\nIt was wildly exhilarating, thrilling in a primitive way. Bentley\r\nremembered those dreams of his childhood--dreams of falling endlessly\r\nbut never striking. Racial memories, scientists called them, relics of\r\nour simian forebears. Bentley thought of that and laughed; but his\r\nlaughter was merely a beastly chattering which recalled him to the\r\ngrim necessity of the moment.\r\n\r\nFifteen minutes passed, perhaps. Twenty. Half an hour. He was\r\nfollowing a trace which led away from the coast, and further away from\r\nthe cabin of Caleb Barter. But with his jungle senses, and his human\r\nmemory, Bentley was sure he could return when the time came.\r\n\r\nHad Barter foreseen all that? Was Barter smiling to himself, back\r\nthere in his awful hermitage, waiting for the working out of his\r\n\"experiment\"?\r\n\r\nBut Apeman had jungle knowledge, and must have forced Bentley's body\r\nto the limit of its endurance, for it was near evening when Bentley,\r\nwho had lost the ape ahead of him, but had continued on the spoor of\r\nApeman by the smell, came to swift pause on his race through the\r\ntrees.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe had heard the voice of Ellen Estabrook, and the voice was pleading.\r\n\r\n\"Lee! Lee! If you love me try to regain control of yourself. Please do\r\nnot stare at me like that. Oh, your poor body! The brush and briars\r\nhave literally torn you to bits.\"\r\n\r\nBut the answer of \"Lee\" was a bestial snarl, and traveling as quietly\r\nas he could, Manape dropped down so that he could gaze upon his\r\nbeloved, and the thing she believed she loved.\r\n\r\nEllen was unaware of him. But he had scarcely dropped into view before\r\nApeman became aware of him, and rose weakly to tottering limbs, to\r\nbeat his bruised and bleeding chest in simian challenge. Apeman was\r\nsimply an ape that had run until he was finished, and now was turning\r\nto make a last stand against a male who was stronger--a last bid for\r\nlife and possession of the she he had carried away.\r\n\r\nThen Ellen saw Manape, screamed, and for the first time since she had\r\nbeen saved from the deep by Bentley, fainted dead away.\r\n\r\nThe two so strangely related creatures faced each other across her\r\nsupine body--and both were savagely snarling. Apeman weakly but\r\nangrily, Manape with a sound of such brute savagery that even the\r\ntwittering of birds died away to awed silence.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n_Struggle for Mastery_\r\n\r\nIt was Apeman who charged. Pity for Apeman welled up in Bentley. That\r\nwas his own body which Apeman was so illy using. His own poor bruised\r\nand bleeding body, which Apeman had all but slain by forcing it far\r\nbeyond human endurance. It must be saved, in spite of Apeman.\r\n\r\nBut there was something first to do. Bentley bent over Ellen, caught\r\nher under his arm, and returned to the trees, with Apeman chattering\r\nangrily and futilely behind him. Bentley found a crotch in the tree\r\nwhere he could place Ellen, made sure that she was safely propped\r\nthere and that no snakes were near, and hurried back to the contest\r\nwith Apeman which could not be avoided.\r\n\r\nHe did not fear the battle he knew he must fight. He hurried back\r\nbecause Apeman might realize himself beaten and escape into the\r\njungle. In his weakened condition he could not travel far and would be\r\neasy prey for any prowling leopard, easy prey for the crawling things\r\nwhose fangs held sure death. Or would the cunning of Apeman, denizen\r\nof the jungle, warn him against any such? His ape brain would warn\r\nhim, but would his human strength avail in case of necessity, in case\r\nof attack by another ape, or a four-footed carnivore?\r\n\r\nBentley hurried back because Apeman must be saved, somehow, even\r\nagainst his will. Apeman hated Manape with a deadly hatred. Yet to\r\nsubdue the travesty of a human being, Manape must take care that he\r\ndid not destroy his own casement of humanity. Any moment now and a\r\ngreat cat might charge from the shadows and destroy Apeman.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nApeman, snarling, beating his puny chest with his puny hands, was\r\nwaiting for Manape his enemy.\r\n\r\nManape found himself thinking of the line: \"'O wad some power the\r\ngiftie gie us, to see oursilves as ithers see us,'\" and adding some\r\nthoughts of his own.\r\n\r\n\"If that were actually 'I' down there, my chance of preserving the\r\nlife of myself, and that of Ellen against the rigors of the jungle,\r\nwould be absolutely nil. How helpless we humans are in primitive\r\nsurroundings! The tiniest serpent may slay us. The jungle cats destroy\r\nus with ease, if we be not equipped with artificial weapons which our\r\nbetter brains have created. As Manape, Barter's trained ape, I am\r\nbetter fitted to protect Ellen than if I were Bentley--the Bentley of\r\nthe _Bengal Queen_. Yet she will cower away from me when she wakens.\"\r\n\r\nNow Bentley was down, and Apeman was charging. He charged at a\r\nstaggering run. He stepped on a thorn, hesitated, and whimpered. But\r\nhe possessed unusual courage, for he still came on. Apeman knew the\r\nlaw of the jungle, that the weakest must die. Death was to be his\r\nportion if he could not withstand the assaults of Manape, and he came\r\nto meet his fate with high brute courage.\r\n\r\nApeman was close in. His hands were swinging, fists closed, in a\r\nstrange travesty of a fighting man. Apeman was snarling. He groped for\r\nthe throat of Manape with his human teeth--which sank home in the\r\ntough hide of Manape, hurting him as little as though Apeman were\r\ntoothless.\r\n\r\n\"As Bentley I would have no chance at all against a great ape,\" said\r\nBentley to himself.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHow could he take the pugnacity out of Apeman without destroying him?\r\nIf he struck him he might strike too hard and slay Apeman--which was\r\nthe equivalent of slaying himself. So Manape extended his mighty\r\nhands, caught Apeman under the armpits and held him up, feet swinging\r\nfree. Yet Apeman still struggled, gnashed his teeth, and beat himself\r\non the chest.\r\n\r\nHow utterly futile! As futile as Bentley in his own casement would\r\nhave been against a great ape! Apeman might destroy himself through\r\nhis very rage. How could Bentley render the travesty unconscious and\r\nyet make sure that Apeman did not die?\r\n\r\nIf he struck he might strike too hard and slay.\r\n\r\nWhat should he do?\r\n\r\nA low coughing sound came from somewhere close by. From the deeps of\r\nhis consciousness Bentley knew that sound. He clutched Apeman in his\r\nright arm, swung back to the tree and up among the branches. He was\r\njust in time. The tawny form of a great cat passed beneath, missing\r\nhim by inches.\r\n\r\nBut while he had saved himself and Apeman, he had been clumsy. He had\r\nstruck the head of Apeman against the bole of the tree, and Apeman\r\nhung limp in his arm. Bentley, fear such as he had never before known\r\ngripping him, pressed his huge ear to Apeman's heart. It was beating\r\nsteadily and strongly. With a great inner sigh of relief he climbed to\r\nsafety in the tree, bearing Apeman with him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe reached the crotch where Ellen rested, and disposed Apeman nearby,\r\nhis own gross body between them. He even dared to gather Ellen closer\r\nagainst him for warmth. His left hand held tightly the wrist of the\r\nunconscious Apeman, so that he should not fall and become prey of the\r\nnight denizens of the jungle.\r\n\r\nSo, the two who seemed to be human--Apeman and Ellen, passed from\r\nunconsciousness into natural sleep, while Bentley-Manape remained\r\nmotionless between them, afraid to close his eyes lest something even\r\nmore terrible than hitherto experienced might transpire. But his ears\r\ncaught every sound of the jungle, and his sensitive ape's nostrils\r\nbrought him every scent--which his man's mind strove to analyze,\r\nreaching back and back into the dim and misty past for identification\r\nof odors that were new, or that were really old, yet which had been\r\nlost to man since they had left forever the simian homes of their\r\nancestors and their senses had become more highly specialized.\r\n\r\nThe questions which turned over and over in Bentley's mind were these:\r\n\r\nHow shall I tell Ellen the truth? Will she believe it?\r\n\r\nWhat is the rest of Barter's experiment? How shall I proceed from this\r\nmoment on? How shall I procure food for Ellen? What food will Apeman\r\nchoose for my body to assimilate?\r\n\r\nAnd jungle night drew on. Once Ellen shivered and pressed closer to\r\nManape as she slept.\r\n\r\nWhat would morning bring to this strange trio?\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n_Fate Decides_\r\n\r\nMorning brought the great apes of the jungle--scores of them. They had\r\napproached so silently through the darkness that Bentley had not heard\r\nthem, and his ape's nostrils had not told his human brain the meaning\r\nof their odor. It appeared too that his ape's ears had tricked him.\r\nFor when morning came there were great apes everywhere.\r\n\r\nBentley still held the wrist of Apeman, whose chest was rising and\r\nfalling naturally, though the body was limp and plainly exhausted, and\r\nexuded perspiration that told of some jungle fever or other illness\r\nperhaps, induced by hardship and over-exertion. The ape's brain of\r\nApeman had driven Bentley's body to the uttermost, and now that body\r\nmust pay.\r\n\r\nBentley wondered how far he was now from the cabin of Caleb Barter.\r\n\r\nHe doubted if Apeman could stand the return journey, though Bentley's\r\nape body could have carried Apeman's with ease. But would Apeman\r\nstand the journey? Apeman, Bentley knew, was going into the Valley of\r\nthe Shadow, and something must be done to save him. But what?\r\n\r\nAnd the great apes constituted a new menace, though they were making\r\nno effort to molest the three in the tree. Apeman must be placed in a\r\nshady place and some attention paid to his needs. But the human body\r\nwith the ape's brain could not tell how it hurt or where.\r\n\r\nThe first task was to get the two beings down from the tree, and much\r\ndepended upon chance. To the apes Bentley was another ape, one\r\nmoreover which had slain a number of them. But Apeman was a human\r\nbeing, as was Ellen Estabrook. The whole thing constituted a fine\r\nproblem for the brain of Manape.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIf Manape were to attempt first aid for Apeman, how would such a sight\r\nreact upon Ellen Estabrook? If Manape were to attempt to take Apeman\r\nback to Caleb Barter, leading the way for Ellen, would she follow, and\r\nwhat would his action tell her? She would think herself demented,\r\nimagining things, because a great ape did things which only human\r\nbeings were supposedly capable of doing.\r\n\r\nIf she knew, of course, it would make a difference. But she did not,\r\nand Bentley had no means by which to inform her. That was a problem\r\nfor the future. Ellen was sleeping the sleep of utter exhaustion and\r\nhe felt that he could safely leave her for the moment while he swung\r\nApeman down from the tree. He must work fast, and return for Ellen\r\nbefore the great apes discovered the helpless Apeman at the foot of\r\nthe tree. He hoped to get Ellen down while she slept, knowing that she\r\nwould be in mortal fear of him if she wakened and found herself in his\r\npower.\r\n\r\nBentley got Apeman down, and looked about him. No apes were close\r\nenough, as far as he could tell, to molest Apeman before Bentley could\r\nreturn with Ellen. He raced back into the tree, lifted Ellen so gently\r\nthat she scarcely altered the even motion of her breathing--and for a\r\nmoment he hesitated. So close to him were her tired lips. So\r\nwoe-begone and pathetic her appearance, a great well of pity for her\r\nrose in the heart of Bentley--or what was the seat of this emotion\r\nwithin him? Was the brain the seat of the emotions? Or the heart? But\r\nBentley's true heart was in Apeman's human body, so there must be some\r\nother explanation for the feeling which grew and grew within Bentley\r\nfor Ellen.\r\n\r\nHe leaned forward with the intention of touching his lips to the tired\r\nthin lips of Ellen Estabrook, then drew back in horror.\r\n\r\nHow could he kiss this woman whom he loved with the gross lips of\r\nManape, the great ape?\r\n\r\nHe could, of course, but suppose she wakened at his caress and saw the\r\ngreat figure of the jungle brute, with all man's emotions and desires,\r\nyet with none of man's restraint--bending over her? Women had gone\r\ninsane over less.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe hurried down with Ellen, and placed her beside Apeman.\r\n\r\nBy now the great apes had discovered the strange trio and were coming\r\nclose to investigate. There was a huge brute who came the fastest and\r\nseemed to be the leader of the apes, if any they had. But even this\r\none did not offer a challenge, did not seem perturbed in the least.\r\nBut he did seem filled with childish curiosity. The apes themselves\r\nwere like children, children grown to monstrous proportions, advancing\r\nand retreating, staring at this trio, darting away when Apeman or\r\nEllen made some sort of movement.\r\n\r\nBentley could sense too their curiosity where he was concerned. Their\r\nsenses told them that Bentley was a great ape. Their instincts,\r\nhowever, made them hesitate, uncertain as to his true \"identity\"--or\r\nso Bentley imagined.\r\n\r\nEllen still slept, but she must have sensed the near presence of\r\npotential enemies, for she was stirring fitfully, preparing to waken.\r\n\r\nWhat would her reaction be when she opened her eyes to see Manape near\r\nher, standing guard over Apeman, with the jungle on all sides filled\r\nwith the lurking nightmare figures of other great apes?\r\n\r\nA moan of anguish came from Apeman. He stirred, and groans which\r\nseemed to rack his whole white bruised body came forth. The brain of\r\nthe ape was reacting to the suffering of Bentley's body--and a brute\r\nwas whimpering with its hurts. The advancing apes came to pause. They\r\nseemed to stare at one another in amazement. They were suddenly\r\nfrightened, amazed, unable to understand the thing they saw and were\r\nlistening to. Bentley crouched there, watching the apes, and he\r\nfancied he could understand their sudden new hesitancy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe did not know, but he guessed that the moans and groans of Apeman\r\nwere comprehensible to the great apes. They knew that this strangely\r\nwhite creature was an ape, though he looked like a man. Already they\r\nhad wondered as much as they were capable, about Manape. They had\r\nsensed something not simian about him which puzzled them.\r\n\r\nBut from the lips of Apeman, to add to their mystification, came the\r\ngroans and moans of an ape that was suffering. Bentley held his\r\nposition, wondering what they would do. That they meant no harm he was\r\nsure, else they would long since have charged and overborne the\r\nthree--unless they remembered the super-simian might of Manape and\r\nwere afraid to attack again. Bentley hoped so, for that would make\r\nthings easier for them all.\r\n\r\nNow the nearest apes were almost beside the body of Apeman, which was\r\nstill covered with agony sweat. The lips emitted moans and faint blurs\r\nof gibberish. Bentley noted that the leading ape was a great she. The\r\nfemale came forward hesitantly, making strange sounds in her throat,\r\nand it seemed to Bentley that Apeman answered them. For the she came\r\nforward with the barest trace of hesitancy, stared for a moment at\r\nManape, with a sort of challenge in her savage little red eyes, then\r\ndropped to all fours beside Apeman and began to lick his wounds!\r\n\r\nThe she knew something of the injuries of Apeman and was doing what\r\ninstinct told her to do for him. Now the rest of the apes were all\r\nabout them--and Ellen wakened with a shrill cry of terror.\r\n\r\nBentley remained as a man turned to stone. If he moved toward the\r\nwoman he loved she would flee from him in terror--out among the other\r\napes and into the jungle where she would have no slightest chance for\r\nlife. If he did nothing she might still run.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWildly she looked about her. She screamed again when she saw the she\r\nbending over the travesty she thought to be Bentley, and licking the\r\npoor bruised body. Ellen cast a sidelong look at Manape, and there was\r\nsomething distinctly placating in her eyes. She recognized Manape, and\r\nwanted his friendship. What thoughts crowded her brain as she realized\r\nthat she was in the center of a group of anthropoids who could have\r\ndestroyed her with their fingers in a matter of seconds!\r\n\r\nShe did the one thing which proved to Bentley that she was worthy of\r\nany man's love. The great she who licked the wounds of Apeman was\r\nthrice the size of Ellen. Yet Ellen crawled to Apeman, little sounds\r\nof pity in her throat. Instantly the snarling of the she sent her\r\nback. The she had, for the time being at least, assumed proprietorship\r\nof Apeman, and was bidding Ellen keep her distance. And the she meant\r\nit, too. For she bared her fighting fangs when Ellen again approached\r\nclose enough to have touched the body of Apeman.\r\n\r\nThis time the she advanced a step toward the girl, and her snarl was a\r\nterrible sound. Ellen retreated, but no further than was necessary to\r\nstill that snarl in the throat of the she. Manape moved in quite close\r\nnow, into position to interfere if the she tried to actually injure\r\nEllen Estabrook. If only, Bentley thought, there were some way of\r\nmaking himself known to Ellen! But how could she believe, even if a\r\nway were discovered?\r\n\r\n\"What shall I do?\" moaned Ellen aloud, wringing her hands. \"Poor Lee!\r\nI can't move him. That brute won't let me touch him. Oh, I'm afraid!\"\r\n\r\nBentley wanted to tell her not to be afraid, but had learned from\r\nexperience that when he tried to speak his voice was the bellowing one\r\nof a great ape. And if he were to enunciate words that Ellen could\r\nunderstand, what then? English from the lips of a giant anthropoid!\r\nShe would not believe, would think herself insane--and with excellent\r\nreason. Slowly, as matters were transpiring, she had already been\r\ngiven sufficient reason to believe that her mind was tottering.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nManape stood guard over her. A she had adopted the thing she thought\r\nwas Bentley. A score of great apes, which only three days ago had\r\ntried to destroy both Bentley and herself, now surrounded Bentley and\r\nEllen with all the appearance of amity--crude, true, but\r\nunmistakable. Certainly this was sufficiently beyond all human\r\nexperience to make Ellen believe she were in the throes of some awful\r\nnightmare. What would she think if an ape began to address her in\r\nEnglish, and \"Bentley\" suddenly held speech with the great apes?\r\n\r\nAdd to this possibility, suppose she were suddenly confronted with the\r\ntruth--that the essential entities of Bentley and Manape had been\r\nexchanged, and the whole thing were explained to her from the gross\r\nlips of Manape himself, while \"Bentley\" looked on and chattered a\r\nchallenge in ape language while Manape talked?\r\n\r\nNo, at first she might have understood. Now it would have been even\r\nmore horrifying for her to hear the truth. She must think what she\r\nwould, and be allowed to adjust herself to the astounding state of\r\naffairs. Apeman could not be moved for some time. Ellen would not\r\nleave him, naturally. Nor would Manape. And the apes apparently\r\nintended to remain with them. Which made the problem, after all, a\r\nsimple one. The trio must remain for the time being among the great\r\napes. They needed one another in a strange way, and they needed the\r\napes themselves, which were like a formidable army at their backs, as\r\nprotection against the other beasts of the wilds.\r\n\r\nBentley watched the great she continue her rude first aid for Apeman.\r\nApeman was still moaning, though less fitfully, like a child that\r\nnuzzles the milk bottle, but is drifting away into sleep. The she gave\r\nthe travesty her full attention. There was something horribly human\r\nabout her maternal care of this creature before her. Her great arms\r\nheld Apeman close while her tongue caressed his wounds. Bentley knew\r\nthat that tongue was an excellent antiseptic, too. All animals licked\r\ntheir own wounds, and those wounds healed. Only human beings knew the\r\ndangers of infection, because they had departed from Nature's\r\ndoctrines and had tried to cheat her with substitutes. Only the\r\nanimals, like that great she, still were Nature's children, healing\r\ntheir own wounds in Nature's way.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSatisfied that the apes would not molest Ellen, so long as she kept\r\nher distance from Apeman, Bentley decided to seek food, which Ellen\r\nmust sorely need. The need for water was urgent, too. Bentley knew the\r\ndanger of drinking water found in the jungle--but an ape could\r\nscarcely be expected to build a fire with which to boil the water, nor\r\nto produce a miracle in the shape of something to hold it in over the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nHere were many makeshifts indicated, then. Bentley smiled inwardly,\r\nthe only way he could smile. He must feed himself, too. He must go\r\nwandering through the woods, feeding the body of Manape with grubs,\r\nworms and such nauseous provender, because it was the food to which\r\nManape was accustomed. Apeman, when he was well enough to eat, would\r\nsicken the body of Bentley with the same sort of food, because the\r\nbrain of Apeman would not know what was good or bad for the body of a\r\nhuman being--nor even would understand that his body was human. What\r\n_did_ Apeman think of his condition, anyway?\r\n\r\nThat question, of course, would never be answered--unless Barter could\r\nreally speak the language of the great apes and somehow managed to\r\nsecure from Apeman, if Apeman lived, a recital of these hours in the\r\njungle.\r\n\r\nWhat food should Manape secure for Ellen? What fruits were edible,\r\nwhat poisonous? How could he tell? He watched the other apes, which\r\nwere scattering here and there now, tipping over rocks and sticks to\r\nsearch for grubs and worms--to see what fruits they ate, if any. They\r\nwould know what fruits to avoid.\r\n\r\nAn hour passed before Bentley saw one of the brutes feed upon anything\r\nexcept insects. A cluster of a peculiar fruit which looked like wild\r\ncurrants, but whose real name Bentley did not know. Now, feeling safe\r\nin his choice, because the ape was eating the berries with relish,\r\nBentley searched until he found a quantity of the same berries, and\r\nbore them back to Ellen Estabrook.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBeside Apeman, who now was awake and exchanging crazy gibberish with\r\nthe she who had licked his wounds, Ellen Estabrook, trying to be\r\nbrave, did not cry aloud. But her face was dirty, and her tears made\r\nfurrows through the grime.\r\n\r\nManape dropped the berries beside her. The she snarled as Ellen\r\nreached for the berries. Manape flung himself forward as the she\r\nstrove to take the berries before Ellen could grasp them--and cuffed\r\nher over backward with a cumbersome but lightning-fast right swing.\r\n\r\n\"Manape,\" said Ellen, \"if only you could talk! I feel that you are my\r\nfriend, and my fears are less when you are with me. I'll pretend that\r\nyou can understand me. It helps a little to talk, for one scarcely\r\nseems so much alone. How would you feel, I wonder, Manape, if you were\r\nsuddenly taken entirely out of the life you've always known, and\r\nforced to live in another world entirely? It would not be easy to be\r\nbrave, would it? Suppose you were taken out of the wilds and dropped\r\ninto a ballroom?\"\r\n\r\nBentley could have laughed had the jest not been such a grim one. What\r\nwould Ellen think if he were to answer her:\r\n\r\n\"I would be much more at home in that ballroom than that thing on the\r\nground that you love--as matters are at this moment!\"\r\n\r\nShe would not understand that.\r\n\r\nNor did she understand when the she went away for a time and came back\r\nwith a supply of worms and grubs--which nauseous supply vanished with\r\ngreat speed under the wolfish appetite of Apeman. There was little\r\nwonder that Ellen found it difficult to orient herself.\r\n\r\n\"I must tell her somehow,\" thought Bentley, \"and that soon. Surely\r\nenough has been done to satisfy the devilish curiosity of Caleb\r\nBarter.\"\r\n\r\nToward evening the apes began to drift further into the jungle. The\r\nshe gathered Apeman in her arms and moved off with him. There was\r\nnothing for Manape to do but follow, and nothing for Ellen to do but\r\nfollow, too--if she loved the thing she thought was Bentley. She did\r\nnot hesitate.\r\n\r\nWith unfaltering courage she followed on, and the lumbering forms of\r\nthe great apes drifted further away from the sea, seemingly headed\r\ntoward some mutely agreed upon jungle rendezvous. Everything depended\r\nfor the time upon the return to health of Apeman. All other matters\r\ndepended upon that. Each in his own way, Manape and Ellen, realized\r\nthis. Caleb Barter had schemed better than he could possibly have\r\nforeseen.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n_Written in Dust_\r\n\r\nAs Apeman was borne deeper into the jungle in the great arms of the\r\nshe, what was more natural in the circumstances than that Ellen keep\r\nclose to her only remaining link with the world she had left--Manape,\r\nthe trained anthropoid of Caleb Barter? A natural thing, and one that\r\nfilled Manape with obvious pleasure.\r\n\r\nOnce she touched his hand, rested her own small one in his mighty palm\r\nfor a moment--and Bentley was afraid to return the pressure of her\r\npalm with the hand of Manape, lest he crush every bone in her fingers.\r\nThereafter at intervals, while the whole aggregation drifted deeper\r\ninto the jungle, Ellen clung to Manape; depended upon him. Was it her\r\nwoman's intuition which told her that Manape was a safe guardian?\r\n\r\nBentley refused to dwell on that phase of this wild adventure however,\r\nfor there were other things to think about. It required many hours for\r\nhim to discover the truth, but he knew it at last. He, Manape-Bentley,\r\nwas the lord of the great apes! Before his capture, or before the\r\ncapture of Manape by Caleb Barter, Manape had been leader of these\r\napes. Now he had returned and was their ruler once more. Upstarts had\r\ntaken his place, and he had slain them--back there when Apeman had\r\ntried to escape into the jungle with Ellen in his arms. To the apes\r\nthis must have seemed the way it was.\r\n\r\nBentley was putting things together, hoping and believing that they\r\nmade four--yet not sure but that he was forcing them to equal four\r\nwhen in actuality they were five or six. If Manape--the original ape\r\nof Barter's capture, whose body now was Bentley's--had been the leader\r\nof the great apes, that explained why the animals remained constantly\r\nin the vicinity of Barter's dwelling. Barter had needed them in his\r\nplans, and had made certain their remaining near by making their\r\nleader captive. And of course only an ape sufficiently intelligent to\r\nrule other apes would have suited the evil scheme which must have been\r\ngrowing for years in the mind of Caleb Barter. Barter had merely\r\nwaited with philosophic calmness for human beings to drift into this\r\nterritory--and the _Bengal Queen_ had obligingly gone down off the\r\ncoast, throwing Ellen Estabrook and Lee Bentley into Barter's power.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat was Barter doing now? Would he not be striving to watch the\r\ncourse of his experiment? Would he not think of details hitherto\r\noverlooked and plan further experiments, or an enlarging of this\r\nexperiment of which three creatures were the victims? Surely Barter\r\nwould not remain quietly at Barterville while the subjects of his\r\nexperiment went deeper into the jungle with the great apes. Barter was\r\ntoo thorough a scientist for that. Somehow, Bentley was sure, Barter\r\nwould know what was happening, even at this very moment.\r\n\r\nHe would wish to know how a modern woman would conduct herself if\r\nsuddenly forced to live among apes. Therefore he would try in some\r\nmanner to keep watch over the conduct of Ellen Estabrook. He would\r\nwonder how a modern man would conduct himself if he suddenly found,\r\nhimself the leader of that same group of apes, and how an ape would\r\nbehave if he suddenly discovered himself a man. It was a neat\r\n\"experiment,\" and Bentley was beginning to believe that there was\r\nprobably far more to it than there first had seemed.\r\n\r\nBarter would wish to know how all three creatures would conduct\r\nthemselves in certain circumstances--Apeman, Ellen and Bentley. He\r\nwould not leave it to chance, for Bentley now realized that Barter\r\nhimself did not feel inimical to either Ellen, Apeman or Bentley. To\r\nhim they were merely an experiment. Barter would not wish for Apeman\r\nto die, and thus deprive Barter of a certain knowledge relative to one\r\nangle of his unholy experiment. He would not wish for Manape-Bentley\r\nto remain forever as Manape-Bentley, lacking the power of speech,\r\neither human speech or the gibberish of the apes.\r\n\r\nNo, all this was not being left to chance. Bentley believed that\r\nBarter was directing the destination of these three subjects of his,\r\nas surely as though he were right with them at this moment, driving\r\nthem to his will with that awful lash which had made him feared by the\r\ngreat apes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nYes, Barter was still the master mind. It made Bentley feel awfully\r\nhelpless. Yet--he was the leader of the great apes. That, too, Barter\r\nmust have foreseen. Would Barter try in any way to discover how\r\nBentley would behave in an emergency as leader of the apes? Would he\r\nwish to know sufficiently to create an emergency? From Bentley's\r\nknowledge of the twisted genius of Caleb Barter, he fully believed\r\nthat Barter planned yet other angles to his experiment.\r\n\r\nIf he did, then what would he do next?\r\n\r\nIt was not until the storm broke over the strange aggregation of great\r\napes, who seemed to be holding two white people prisoners, that\r\nBentley understood that from the very beginning he should have been\r\nable to see the obvious denouement--the mad climax which even then was\r\npreparing in the jungle ahead, simply waiting for the great apes to\r\ndrift, feeding as they went without a thought of danger, into the trap\r\nset for them.\r\n\r\nEllen now kept her hand in the great palm of Manape. She wept on\r\noccasions, when she thought of the apparent hopelessness of her\r\nposition, but for the most part she was brave, and Bentley grew to\r\nlove her more as the hours passed--even as he grew more impatient at\r\nhis inability to express his love. If he tried he could simply\r\nfrighten her--fill her with horror because, gentle though he was with\r\nher and he was a great ape, a fact which nothing could change. Nor\r\ncould anybody change the fact, except Caleb Barter. Where was the\r\nscientist? What would be his next move if he were not leaving the\r\nworking out of his experiment entirely to chance, which seemed not at\r\nall in keeping with the thorough manner of his experiment thus far.\r\n\r\nThe future was a dark, painful obscurity, in which all things were\r\nhidden, in which anything might happen--because Caleb Barter would\r\nwish for it to happen.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHow long would Barter wait before making his next move? Long enough\r\nfor Ellen to accustom herself to life among the apes? Long enough to\r\ndiscover whether her natural intelligence would guide her to eke out\r\nexistence among hardships such as human beings never thought of,\r\nexcept perhaps in nightmares? Long enough to allow the brain of\r\nBentley to discover what miracles intellect might do with the body of\r\nManape? Long enough for Apeman to be well of his illness, so that he\r\nmight observe what havoc an ape's brain might work with a human body?\r\n\r\nCertainly when one gave the hideous experiment full thought, its\r\npossible angles of development, its many potential ramifications, were\r\nastounding in the extreme. Was it not up to Bentley then to do\r\nsomething besides mope and pine for the impossible, and thus hasten\r\nthe hour when Barter should be wholly satisfied with his experiment?\r\n\r\nWhat would Apeman do, how would he behave, when the white body of\r\nBentley was well again? Would that body grow well faster when guided\r\nby an ape's brain than when a human brain was in command? Certainly\r\nCaleb Barter must have listed all these questions and hundreds of\r\nothers which had not as yet occurred to Bentley. If he had he would\r\nnot transfer the two intelligences back to their proper places until\r\nall of his questions were answered to his satisfaction. Bentley\r\nhimself must somehow force an answer to some of them.\r\n\r\nTo do this he must try to guess what sort of questions Barter would\r\nhave listed, and try to work out their answers--assuming all the time\r\nthat Barter, from some undiscovered coign of vantage would be watching\r\nfor the answers he hoped his experiment would provide.\r\n\r\nBentley arrived at a decision. Ellen must long since have become\r\nnumbed to the horror which encompassed her. Bentley knew that a human\r\nbrain could stand only so much, beyond which it was no longer\r\nsurprised or horrified. He guessed, noting the pale face of his\r\nbeloved, that Ellen had well nigh reached that stage.\r\n\r\nHe decided to take a tremendous risk with her sanity, hoping thereby\r\nto do his part in working out the details of Barter's experiment.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe sun was creeping into the west when the roving apes came to pause\r\nin a sort of clearing. Some of them curled up in sleep. The she who\r\ncarried Apeman squatted with Apeman in her arms, and licked his wounds\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nThat Apeman was recovering was plainly evident, and when he saw it\r\nfilled Bentley with an odd mixture of thankfulness and revulsion.\r\nApeman was essentially an ape. With all his strength back he would\r\nrevert to type, and what if he forced the body of Bentley to do\r\nhorrible things that Ellen would never be able to forget or\r\ncondone--even when she at last knew the truth? What if Apeman\r\nselected, for example, a mate--from among the hairy she's? For Apeman\r\nthat would be natural, for Bentley horrible.\r\n\r\nYet it might easily transpire. Apeman might relinquish the white she\r\nto a successful rival--which he would regard Manape as being--and\r\ncontent himself with a choice from the ape she's. Somehow that unholy\r\nthing must not happen. That was up to Manape-Bentley.\r\n\r\nOr, with his strength fully returned, Apeman might again desire Ellen,\r\nand force the issue with Manape for her possession--which seemed\r\nequally horrible to the brain of Bentley.\r\n\r\nEllen remained as close to Apeman as the she would permit her.\r\nManape-Bentley crouched close by. After a time Apeman slept, and\r\nBentley was pleased to notice that the agony sweat no longer beaded\r\nApeman's body, and that Apeman was recovering with superhuman\r\nswiftness--thanks to the ministrations of the unnamed she who had\r\ntaken charge of him. Apeman now rarely groaned, sleeping or waking.\r\n\r\nEllen watched the sleeping Apeman with her heart--and her fears--in\r\nher eyes. Satisfied that he slept, and that his sleep was healthy,\r\nEllen again approached the creature she knew as Manape, Barter's\r\ntrained ape.\r\n\r\n\"If only you could talk,\" she said to him. \"If only you were able to\r\ngive some hope. If only there were some way I could cause you to\r\nunderstand my wishes--understand and help me.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBentley did not answer. He knew that to be useless. But his brain\r\nremembered something. His brain recalled that moment in the cage in\r\nthe dwelling of Barter, when his human brain had tried to force\r\nobedience from the great clumsy hands of Manape, when he had tried to\r\nforce those mighty fingers to unfasten the knots which held the cage\r\ndoor secure.\r\n\r\nCould he force those hands to something else?\r\n\r\nDid he dare try?\r\n\r\nIt was a terrible risk to take with Ellen's sanity, but Bentley felt\r\nit must be taken. She was watching him hopelessly, and her lips moved\r\nas though she prayed for a miracle--as though by some weird necromancy\r\nshe might force Manape to understand her words, and to answer her,\r\nallaying her fears, destroying her hopelessness.\r\n\r\nWhen Ellen watched him, Bentley searched about nearby until he found a\r\ndried stick perhaps eight feet in length. He held it up, sniffed at\r\nit, fumbled it with his heavy, grotesque fingers. He focussed the\r\nattention of Ellen upon that stick, while his excitement mounted and\r\nmounted, and his fear of possible consequences kept pace with his\r\nexcitement.\r\n\r\nThen, his decision reached, he began again that species of hypnosis\r\nwhich seemed necessary to compel the hands and fingers of Manape to do\r\nthings no ape's hands had ever done before, no ape's brain had ever\r\nthought of doing.\r\n\r\nHe pressed one end of the stick against the ground at his sprawling\r\nfeet. With his left palm he smoothed out an area of dust several feet\r\nin either direction--a rough dusty rectangle.\r\n\r\nInterested, her brows puckered in concentration. Ellen watched as\r\nManape went through these gestures which were so strangely, terribly\r\nhuman.\r\n\r\nHer eyes were watching the end of that twig which the trained ape was\r\nso clumsily clutching in both hands.\r\n\r\nShe saw the marks the twig made in the dust as Manape caused it to\r\nmove--slowly, horribly, fearfully, from left to right across the area\r\nof dust.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFear began to grow in her face, but Bentley forced himself on. Again\r\nthe fetid odor of ape sweat covered him. This awful concentration,\r\nthis awful task of forcing Manape to write English words was in itself\r\na miracle, more miraculous even than Ellen would have thought of\r\npraying for.\r\n\r\nHer eyes were glued to the sprawling, uneven, misshapen marks in the\r\ndust with hypnotic fascination. Bentley dared not look at her, because\r\nit required all his will to force the clumsy hands of Manape to his\r\nbidding.\r\n\r\nHe could only watch the marks in the dust, and will with all the power\r\nof his human intelligence that the hands of Manape make their shape\r\nsufficiently plain that Ellen might read them--and hope besides that\r\nthis terrible thing would not send the sorely harassed girl into the\r\njungle, madly shrieking for deliverance from a nightmare.\r\n\r\nThere, the words were written--and Ellen was staring at them, her eyes\r\nwide and unblinking, her body as rigid as stone, and her face as cold.\r\nOnly three words were possible without an interval of rest, but those\r\nthree words, among all Bentley might have selected, were the most to\r\nthe point, the most unbelievable, the most black-magical.\r\n\r\n_\"I am Lee!\"_\r\n\r\nMinutes went into eternity as Ellen stared at the words. Silence that\r\nit seemed would never be broken hang over the clearing. The bickering\r\nof the apes passed unnoticed as Ellen stared. Then, slowly, she tried\r\nto raise her eyes to meet those of Manape.\r\n\r\nShe failed. Her body went limp and she slid forward on her face in the\r\ndust. Manape-Bentley gently turned her on her side and waited. What\r\nwould he see in her beloved eyes when she regained consciousness?\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n_Barter Acts_\r\n\r\nBentley remained motionless, awaiting Ellen's return to consciousness.\r\nHe waited in fear and trembling. How would she react to the horrible\r\nthing he had told her?\r\n\r\nNow there was possibility of converse between them. If she knew and\r\nrealized the meaning of his revelation. But would her mind stand up\r\nunder the awfulness of it? He had thought so, else he would not have\r\ntaken the chance he had taken. Much now depended upon Ellen, and all\r\nhe could do was wait.\r\n\r\nSlowly she began to move. Moans escaped her lips, little pathetic\r\nmoans, and the name of Lee Bentley.\r\n\r\nAt last her eyes opened, and widened with horror when they met those\r\nof Manape. Bentley knew that there were tears on the face of\r\nBentley-Manape. Manape, it seemed, cried easily, like a child.\r\n\r\nHer eyes still wide with horror. Ellen Estabrook slowly turned them\r\nuntil she gazed at the dust rectangle in which presumably a great ape\r\nhad written words in English. But Bentley-Manape had rubbed out the\r\nwords. She turned and looked at Manape again, and her lips writhed and\r\ntwisted. She was seeking for words, shaping words, to ask questions\r\nsuch as none in all the world's history had ever asked of a giant\r\nanthropoid, with any hope of receiving answers.\r\n\r\n\"You tell me you are Lee,\" she began slowly, hesitantly, as though the\r\nwords were literally forced from her against her will. \"I cannot grasp\r\nthe meaning of that. You say you are Lee, yet I recognize you as\r\nManape, Caleb Barter's great ape. Yet Manape could not have written\r\nthose words. Yet, if you are Lee Bentley, who or what is that?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShe turned and pointed a trembling finger at Apeman. Bentley of course\r\ncould not answer her in words, yet his mind was busy conceiving of\r\nsome way in which he might answer her. She turned back to him after a\r\nlong look at Apeman and studied him. His huge barrel chest, the mighty\r\narms, the receding forehead--the outward seeming of a giant ape.\r\n\r\nAgain that hesitant, horribly difficult task, of forcing the arms of\r\nManape to perform actions which were not natural to the arms of a\r\ngreat ape. Bentley managed to raise the right arm in the gesture of\r\npointing.\r\n\r\nHe pointed at the other apes, some of which slept, some of which ate\r\nof grubs and worms, or bickered savagely among themselves over\r\nwhatever childish trifles seemed important to the ape mind.\r\n\r\n\"You mean,\" said Ellen huskily, \"that Lee Bentley there is really an\r\nape?\"\r\n\r\nManape nodded, ponderously.\r\n\r\nEllen's face became animated. She was beginning to understand how to\r\nhold speech with Manape.\r\n\r\n\"You tell me he is a great ape, yet he has the body of Lee Bentley.\r\nYou tell me you are Bentley, yet I see you as Manape. Caleb Barter's\r\ntrained ape. How am I to understand? Are my eyes betraying me, or is\r\nthis a nightmare from which I shall waken presently? I see the shape\r\nof Manape, who writes in the dust that he is Lee. How can I know? None\r\nof you I can see is Lee Bentley. What part of you that I cannot see is\r\nLee?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAgain the effort of forcing the hands of Manape to obedience.\r\n\r\nManape-Bentley tapped his receding forehead with his knuckles, and a\r\ngasp burst from the lips of Ellen Estabrook.\r\n\r\n\"You mean your brain is Bentley's brain, and that Bentley's body holds\r\nthe brain of a great ape?\"\r\n\r\nManape nodded clumsily.\r\n\r\n\"But how? You mean--Caleb Barter? I remember about him now. A master\r\nsurgeon, an expert on anesthesia--a thousand years ahead of his time.\r\nYou mean then that we three are part of an experiment? You, Manape,\r\nhave the brain of Bentley, and Bentley has the brain of a great ape?\"\r\n\r\nBentley nodded.\r\n\r\nThe face of Ellen Estabrook writhed and twisted. Her eyes studied the\r\nperson of Manape the great ape. She could not believe the thing she\r\nhad been told, yet she was thinking back and back--back to when Apeman\r\nhad carried her away, his subsequent behavior, his behavior in the\r\nhouse of Barter, and his interest in the she ape who had licked his\r\nwounds.\r\n\r\nShe remembered how Manape in the beginning had looked at her with the\r\neyes of a lustful man--and how later all his attitude had been\r\nprotective. There seemed evidence in plenty to support the statement\r\nManape had mutely managed to give her. She was forced to believe.\r\n\r\n\"But, Lee,\"--she came closer to Manape as she spoke--\"we must do\r\nsomething for that creature there--that thing with the ape she which\r\nlooks like the man I love. You've heard me say that I love Lee\r\nBentley?\"\r\n\r\nManape nodded.\r\n\r\n\"Does Lee Bentley love me?\"\r\n\r\nAgain Manape nodded, more vehemently this time. Ellen smiled. Then,\r\nquickly, she came to Manape, thrust her fingers against his skull and\r\nexamined it closely. Her brows were furrowed in concentration. She\r\nleft Manape and strode to Apeman. The she growled at her but she\r\nignored the beast as much as possible, though plainly cognizant of the\r\nfact that she dared not touch her hands to Apeman on pain of being\r\ntorn asunder by the fighting fangs of the ape she.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen Ellen came back.\r\n\r\n\"The evidence is there, Lee,\" she said. \"There are the marks of a\r\nsurgeon's instruments. Marvelous. One is almost inclined to forget the\r\nhorror of it in the realization that a miracle has been performed. The\r\noperation was perfect. But what did he use for anesthesia? How did\r\nBarter manage to complete his operation and cause his two patients to\r\nfeel no-ill effects, to be to all intents and purposes well in mind\r\nand body--all within less than twelve hours? However, that does not\r\nmatter now. Something must be done. Since Caleb Barter was the only\r\nman who could perform this unholy operation, he is the only one who\r\ncould repeat it restoring each of you to your proper earthly\r\ncasements. So we must play in with him. I suppose you've long since\r\ndecided that way, Lee?\"\r\n\r\nHow strange it seemed to Ellen to discuss such matters with Manape.\r\nBut behind his brutish exterior was the brain of the man whom she\r\nloved.\r\n\r\n\"And there is one other thing,\" Ellen almost whispered, and her face\r\nflushed rosily. \"No harm must come to the body of Lee, you understand?\r\nHe must never be permitted to do anything of which Lee Bentley of\r\nafter years may have cause to feel ashamed.\"\r\n\r\nManape nodded. He understood her, and despite the grotesquerie of the\r\nwhole thing there was something intimate and sweet about this\r\ninterchange. A man and woman loved. Just now that love was mentioned\r\nmore or less in the abstract, discussed on purely a mental basis--but\r\nboth Bentley and Ellen Estabrook were thinking of the future, and were\r\nas frank with each other as they perhaps ever would be again.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNow the apes were beginning to stir themselves. It was time to be on\r\nthe move again. Eyes were turned toward Manape, who was plainly\r\nintended to lead them further into the jungle. Ellen and the white\r\nbody of Bentley were already being accepted as a matter of course.\r\n\r\nIf the great apes wondered why their returned lord did not jabber with\r\nthem in the gibberish of the great apes, there was no way of telling,\r\nfor there was no way in which Manape could make himself understood,\r\nnor any way the great apes could tell their thoughts to Manape.\r\n\r\nThen, without warning, the blow fell.\r\n\r\nThe storm broke, and even as the uproar started Bentley was sure that\r\nhe could sense behind it the fine hand of Caleb Barter--still working\r\nout his \"experiment,\" with human beings and apes as the pawns.\r\n\r\nThe apes were on the move, entering a series of aisles through the\r\ngloomy woods when the blow fell--in the shape of scores of nets, in\r\nwhose folds within a matter of seconds the great apes were fighting\r\nand snarling helplessly. They expended their mighty strength to no\r\navail. They fought at ropes and thongs which they did not\r\nunderstand--and only Manape made no effort to fight, knowing it\r\nuseless.\r\n\r\nScores of black folk armed with spears danced and yelled in the brush,\r\nfrankly delighted at the success of their grand coup. Barter was\r\nnowhere to be seen, and there was a possibility that he knew nothing\r\nabout this. Yet Bentley knew better. Perhaps, in order to stimulate\r\nthe blacks, he had offered them money for great apes taken alive.\r\nAnyhow, scores of the apes were taken, and now exhausted themselves in\r\nsavage bellowing and snarling, as they fought for freedom.\r\n\r\nA half dozen to each net, the blacks gathered in their captives. They\r\nmade much over Ellen Estabrook. They pawed over Apeman despite his\r\nsnarls and bellowings, and laughed when Apeman played the ape as\r\nthough to the manner born. They scented some mystery here, a white man\r\nraised by the apes, perhaps. But that Ellen and Apeman were prisoners\r\nof blacks, Bentley could plainly understand. He scarcely knew which\r\nwas the more horrible for her--to be prisoner of the apes or the\r\nblacks.\r\n\r\nBut for the moment there was nothing he could do. And the blacks were\r\nnot torturing either Apeman or Ellen, though there was no mistaking\r\nwhat he saw in the faces of the blacks when they looked at Ellen and\r\ngrinned at one another.\r\n\r\nDarkness had fallen over the world when the blacks went shouting into\r\na village of mud-wattled huts, bearing the trophies of their ape hunt.\r\nStill in their nets for safety's sake, the great apes were thrown into\r\na sort of stockade which had plainly just been built for their\r\nreception--proof to Bentley that this decision to make an attack\r\nagainst the passing band of anthropoids had been a sudden one. What\r\ndid that indicate?\r\n\r\nSomeone had caused the blacks to react in a way that never would have\r\noccurred to them ordinarily.\r\n\r\nCaleb Barter?\r\n\r\nBentley thought so. What now was Bentley supposed to do? What did\r\nBarter expect him to do? What did Barter expect Ellen to do? What did\r\nhe expect Apeman to do?\r\n\r\nThere was no question, as Bentley saw it, but that Caleb Barter still\r\npulled the strings, and that before morning this jungle village was to\r\nwitness a horror it should never forget.\r\n\r\nBut at the moment Bentley had but one thought: to escape quietly with\r\nEllen and Apeman, and return to the dwelling of Caleb Barter.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n_Jungle Justice_\r\n\r\nAgain that grim concentration on the part of Bentley, forcing the\r\nunaccustomed great hands of Manape to perform things they had never\r\ndone before. He must release himself from the rope net which held him.\r\nFor the hands of a human being the task would have been easy. For the\r\nhands of Manape, even though guided by the will of Bentley, the task\r\nwas far from easy.\r\n\r\nBut he persevered.\r\n\r\nAn hour after the apes had been dumped in the stockade, Bentley had\r\nreleased himself from the rope net and was resting after the awful\r\nordeal of forcing the hands of Manape to do his bidding. He pressed\r\nhimself against the uprights of the stockade, and carefully tested\r\nthem with his strength. The strength of Bentley would never have\r\navailed against the stout uprights of the stockade. Yet Manape-Bentley\r\nknew that with the arms of Manape he could tear the uprights out of\r\nthe ground as easily as though they had been match-sticks. What should\r\nhe do now?\r\n\r\nHis first impulse of course was to release the rest of the great apes.\r\nThe brutes still fought at their bindings and were utterly insane with\r\nrage. What would they do when they were released? What was his duty\r\nwhere they were concerned? If they went wild through the native\r\nvillage, slaying and laying waste, would Bentley be responsible for\r\nloss of life? If he left the apes in the hands of the natives, what\r\nthen? He would never afterward forgive himself. He knew them as\r\nchildren of the wilds, carefree and happy brutes of the jungle. Now if\r\nheld captives indefinitely they would either die or spend the rest of\r\ntheir lives in cages.\r\n\r\nNo, he would release the animals, one by one. The natives would have\r\nto take their chances.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA white figure loomed out of the darkness, coming from the direction\r\nof a great bonfire which showed all the jungle surrounding in weird,\r\ncrimson relief. The white figure, all but nude, was Apeman! Following\r\nhim were several natives, who laughed and prodded Apeman with the\r\nbutts of their spears.\r\n\r\nBentley understood that. They thought Apeman a demented white man,\r\nand to these natives a demented one was a butt of jokes. They did not\r\neven suspect the horror of the possible revenge that was growing in\r\nthe brain of the ape which controlled the body of Apeman.\r\n\r\nTwice or thrice Apeman tried to dart into the jungle, but always the\r\nblacks prevented, heading him toward the cage where the apes were held\r\nprisoners. Bentley wondered where Ellen was and what was happening to\r\nher.\r\n\r\nA celebration of some sort seemed going forward in the village. Was\r\nCaleb Barter somewhere near, perhaps on the edge of the jungle,\r\ngrinning gleefully at this thing he had brought about as part of his\r\nunholy experiment? There was no way of knowing of course, yet.\r\n\r\nBut....\r\n\r\nApeman reached the side of the stockade and snarled back at his\r\nannoyers, while his white hands grasped the uprights and tore at them\r\nwith futile savagery. A strange situation. Inside the stockade a score\r\nof brutes who could rip the stockade to bits. Outside, one of them\r\nfree, but hampered by the puny strength of a human being.\r\n\r\nThe blacks shouted to Apeman but of course Bentley could not\r\nunderstand what they said. Apeman turned after snarling at them for a\r\nfew moments, and began to chatter in that gibberish which appeared to\r\nbe Apeman's only mode of speech--ape language on the lips of a man!\r\nThis was the only time it had ever happened.\r\n\r\nThe apes stirred fitfully as Apeman chattered, and began to renew\r\ntheir attacks on their bonds. The blacks, after watching Apeman for a\r\nfew moments turned back toward the bonfire, evidently satisfied that\r\nthis strange demented creature would not run away. Apeman chattered\r\nand the apes made answer.\r\n\r\nThe she who had nursed Apeman managed to reach the side of the\r\nstockade, and for several moments Bentley listened to the horrible\r\ngrotesqueries--an ape she and a man talking together in brutish\r\ngibberish, and with hellish intimacy.\r\n\r\nNow, wondering just how matters would work themselves out, Bentley set\r\nhimself the task of releasing the apes. They would at least create a\r\nfuror in the village, during which Bentley could escape into the\r\njungle with Apeman and Ellen Estabrook before the natives could\r\nreorganise themselves and give chase.\r\n\r\nHis plan was hazy, and he figured without the savagery of Apeman who\r\noccupied that white body which had been Bentley's. His one thought was\r\nto free the apes, set them upon the village, and escape with Apeman\r\nand Ellen. Just that and no more; but he did not know the great apes,\r\nnor how thoroughly they followed the lead of their lord whom they knew\r\nas Manape, though how he was named in their brains he was never to\r\nknow.\r\n\r\nOne by one he released the apes. They seemed to sense the necessity\r\nfor stealth, for they began to ape the cautious behavior of Manape.\r\nApeman, outside, seemed to be advising them, telling them what to do.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOne by one as Manape released them, the apes squatted side by side,\r\ntheir red angry little eyes watching his every move. Bentley knew of\r\ncourse what a fearful racket his own appearance would cause when he\r\nstrode out of the gloom among the blacks, seeking Ellen. But he knew\r\nthat surprise for a few precious moments would render the blacks\r\nincapable of stopping him until he got away. At least he hoped so.\r\n\r\nBeyond that he had no other plan. All depended upon the behavior of\r\nthe apes and the reaction of the blacks who were holding a devil's\r\ndance about the mighty fire in the center of their village. Bentley\r\ndid not even yet dare guess what the apes would do when they saw what\r\nManape-Bentley did. Would they follow him? Or would they race for the\r\njungle to escape?\r\n\r\nA few minutes now would tell the tale. He had released the last of the\r\ngreat apes, who now lined the side of the stockade, apparently holding\r\nangry converse with Apeman. Bentley was reminded of the old fashioned\r\nmob of pioneer days--angrily muttering yet lacking a leader to direct\r\ntheir efforts. Well, he had done his duty as he saw it. From now on\r\nthings must take their course.\r\n\r\nBut Bentley waited, watching the dancing figures about the fire. As\r\nfar as he could tell the dance was approaching some sort of a climax.\r\nThe figures leaped higher as they danced, and the noise of their\r\nshouting raced and rolled across the jungle. They appeared to be drunk\r\nwith some sort of excitement, perhaps helped by native liquor, perhaps\r\nbecause of superstitious frenzy.\r\n\r\nIf he waited for their excitement to die down a bit, for some of them\r\nto go to sleep, his chances of releasing Ellen would be better. It\r\nwould not be hard for him to find her--not with Manape's sensitive\r\nnose to lead him to her.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut time passed and the apes, though apparently being urged to\r\nsomething by Apeman, watching Manape sullenly, apparently waiting for\r\nhim to make some move.\r\n\r\nThen, sharp as a knife, cutting through the other noises of the\r\nvillage, came Ellen's voice.\r\n\r\n\"Help, Lee! Help me!\"\r\n\r\nThe scream was broken short off as though a hand had clutched the\r\ngirl's throat, but Bentley waited for no more--and Manape-Bentley flew\r\ninto action. His great hands went to the uprights of the stockade.\r\nHis mighty shoulders heaved and twisted and the uprights were ripped\r\napart.\r\n\r\nThe apes followed his lead, and the cracking of the stockade's\r\nuprights was like a volley of pistol shots. The great brutes fairly\r\nwalked through the green saplings which formed the prison. Manape was\r\nleading the charge, and the apes, once through, did not hesitate. If\r\ntheir leader charged the blacks they would follow--and did, while\r\namong them danced, cavorted and gibbered the travesty, Apeman.\r\n\r\nHe was Bentley's lieutenant, and Bentley-Manape was the lord of the\r\napes. Just now he forgot that he was more ape than man. Just now he\r\nwas happy that his strength was the strength of many men. He was\r\nhurrying to the assistance of the woman he loved.\r\n\r\nBehind him came the great apes, following like an army of poorly\r\ntrained recruits, yet armed as no army has ever been armed since the\r\ndays when men fought with fist and fang against their enemies. Bentley\r\nlumbered swiftly toward the sound of Ellen's voice, aided in his\r\njourney by the odor of her which came to his sensitive ape's nostrils.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe blacks never saw the approach of the apes, until, led by Manape\r\nthe Mighty, the great apes were right among them. Bentley did not\r\npause. A black man saw him and shrieked aloud in terror, a shriek\r\nwhich seemed to freeze the other blacks in all sorts of postures.\r\nSitting men remained where they sat, and some of the motionless ones\r\nsaved their lives by their immobility. Dancers paused in midstride,\r\nand those who did not, died.\r\n\r\nFor the hands of the great apes clutched at everything that moved, and\r\nthe great shoulders bulged, and the mighty muscles cracked, and men\r\nwere torn asunder as though they had been flies in the hands of\r\nvengeful boys.\r\n\r\nThe black who had shrieked hurled a spear, purely a reflex,\r\nperhaps--an action born of its habitual use. It missed Bentley by a\r\nnarrow margin, but passed through the stomach of the she who had\r\nnursed Apeman. Snarling, snapping at the thing which hurt her, the she\r\ntore the weapon free--then waddled forward swiftly, caught the man who\r\nhad hurled the spear, and tore his head off with a single twisting\r\nmovement of her great hands.\r\n\r\nNext moment her blood was mingling with that of her slayer as she fell\r\nabove him. But her hands, in the convulsions of death, still ripped\r\nand tore, and the black whom she held was a ghastly thing when the she\r\nwas finally dead. Bentley did not see the ghastly end of the spearman,\r\nfor he was seeking Ellen, and at the some time keeping a close watch\r\non Apeman.\r\n\r\nApeman seemed to be urging the apes to the attack, bidding them rip\r\nand tear and gnash, and the apes were doing that, making of the\r\nvillage a crimson shambles. But they did it in passing, for Manape was\r\ntheir leader, and him they followed--and he was seeking Ellen\r\nEstabrook.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe door of the hut in which his nostrils told him she would be found,\r\ngave before his mighty chest as though it had been made of paper.\r\nInside, in the glow of the native lamp, a huge black man cowered\r\nagainst the further wall of the hut, with spear poised.\r\n\r\nBut the black man seemed frozen with terror.\r\n\r\n\"Lee! Lee!\"\r\n\r\nBentley essayed one glance at her. In the other corner she was, with\r\nthe upper part of her clothing almost torn from her body.\r\n\r\nThen the spearman hurled his weapon. Bentley strove to force the huge\r\nbulk of Manape's body to dodge the spear; but that body was slow in\r\ndoing so--and took a mortal wound!\r\n\r\nBut it was a wound that would mean slow death. An aching, terrible\r\nwound. Then Manape-Bentley had grasped the body of the black, lifted\r\nit high above his head, and crashed it to the hard packed floor of the\r\nhut. The hut fairly shook with the thud of that fall. At once Manape\r\nstooped, caught the black by the ankles and pulled in opposite\r\ndirection with all his terrific might.\r\n\r\nThen he whirled, masking what he had done from Ellen's sight with his\r\nhuge, sorely wounded body.\r\n\r\nHe tried to send her a message with his eyes, but it was not\r\nnecessary. She knew Manape, Barter's trained ape. She followed close\r\nat his heels. Outside the hut's door Apeman still urged the apes to\r\ndestruction of men and property, of women and children. The village of\r\nthe blacks had become a place of horror.\r\n\r\n\"Hurry, Lee!\" gasped Ellen. \"You've been grievously wounded, and if\r\nManape dies, nothing can save _you_--and I shall not care to live!\"\r\n\r\nBut Bentley knew. His brain could sense the approach of death, and\r\nwhat he now must do was very plain.\r\n\r\nHe charged at Apeman and caught the struggling, snarling travesty up\r\nin his mighty arms. Then, with Ellen at his heels, he leaped into the\r\njungle and began the race for the house of Caleb Barter.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLife was going from him, yet his brain forced onward the body of\r\nManape. Behind came the great apes, following their leader. Now and\r\nagain they screamed and snarled at him, but he paid them no heed. They\r\ncould follow or leave him, as they chose. They chose to follow.\r\n\r\nApeman fought and bit at Bentley, but he paid him as little heed as\r\nthough he had been nothing at all. Now and again when Ellen faltered\r\nBentley caught her up, too, and carried her with Apeman until Ellen\r\nwas rested enough to go on.\r\n\r\nSome of the apes appeared to realize whither they were going, for they\r\ntook to the trees and vanished onward. With Apeman alone, Bentley\r\nhimself would have taken to the trees as the swiftest way back to\r\nBarter's dwelling. But Ellen could not race along the upper terraces,\r\nand Bentley could not carry both Apeman and Ellen and leave the\r\nground. But he could travel swiftly on his race with death, with Ellen\r\nas the prize if he won.\r\n\r\nThe hours passed, and the strength of Manape decreased; but fiercely\r\nthe brain of Bentley drove the mighty body on. Ellen sobbed with\r\nweariness but continued on, and no words were spoken. There was no\r\ntime for words. Now and again Bentley forced Apeman to walk, and\r\ndragged him forward with a hand clutching his wrist. At such times\r\nBentley carried Ellen, and scarcely slackened his stride under her\r\nweight.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOnce he tried to force Apeman to carry her, but the arms of Apeman\r\nwere not equal to the task for more than fifty yards or so, and he\r\ngave that up as being impracticable. His brain raced, thinking up ways\r\nto travel faster, to reach Barter's quarters before the mighty body of\r\nManape should die, and with it the brain of Bentley.\r\n\r\nSurely no stranger cavalcade ever before traversed the jungles of the\r\nBlack Continent.\r\n\r\nSo they came at last to the clearing. The apes protested and remained\r\nin hiding, while Bentley, never pausing, raced across toward the house\r\nhe would never forget.\r\n\r\nThe body of Manape was almost through, for it staggered like a\r\ndrunken man. Blood covered the mighty chest, and the brain of Bentley\r\nfelt hazy; nothing made sense; and the end was very near.\r\n\r\nBut they reached the door of Barter's dwelling, and Barter himself met\r\nthem, bearing his cruel whip in his hand. Ellen roused herself from\r\nher extreme exhaustion and clutched at the scientist's hand.\r\n\r\n\"Professor Barter!\" she begged. \"Please, please! Manape is almost\r\ndead! Hurry! Hurry, for the love of God!\"\r\n\r\n\"There, there, my dear young lady,\" said Barter soothingly. \"Make\r\nyourself easy. There's no cause for worry.\"\r\n\r\nManape-Bentley toppled forward on the floor of the cabin. Ellen\r\nscreamed and Barter comforted her. Apeman tried to escape to the\r\njungle, but the lash of Barter drove him cowering and whimpering to a\r\ncorner.\r\n\r\nThen, oblivion--save that somewhere was the odor of violets. Or did\r\nviolets possess odor? Then, if not, the odor of flowers he thought\r\nwere violets.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n_The Horror Passes_\r\n\r\nSlowly consciousness returned to Bentley, and his first thought was\r\none of horror. From somewhere distinct came a doleful wailing sound.\r\nHe thought he knew what it was--the mourning of great apes over a\r\nmember that had died.\r\n\r\nHe had read somewhere that the great apes sorrowed when any of their\r\nmembers died. Bentley opened his eyes. He could make out the ceiling\r\nof a room that he recognized. It was the room that had been first\r\nassigned him in the dwelling of Barter.\r\n\r\nEllen Estabrook would be somewhere nearby. He opened his lips to call\r\nto her. Then he remembered. He'd tried to call to her before--and had\r\nmerely bellowed like an ape. No, there was something he must know\r\nfirst.\r\n\r\nHis arms and hands seemed as heavy as lead, but he lifted them and\r\nlooked at them--and a great feeling of peace descended upon him.\r\nManape-Bentley was gone, and he was plain Lee Bentley again. There was\r\nhis own ring, which Apeman had worn, and besides he had just spoken\r\naloud, softly, for no ears save his own, and the voice had been Lee\r\nBentley's voice.\r\n\r\nYes, Barter had kept his promise, and Lee Bentley was Lee Bentley\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nBut he was very weak, and his body was racked with pain. His hands and\r\narms were covered with bandages. His body seemed packed in concrete,\r\nso moveless was it, and when he raised his voice it was terribly weak.\r\n\r\n\"Ellen,\" he managed to call; and again, \"Ellen, darling!\"\r\n\r\nInstantly there came a swift patter of feet and Ellen was beside his\r\nbed, on her knees, covering his face--what there was of it\r\nunbandaged--with kisses. There was really no need for words between\r\nthese two.\r\n\r\n\"Lee,\" she whispered, \"I've been so afraid. You've been like this for\r\na week, despite the miraculous knowledge and skill of Professor\r\nBarter. I've waited in fear and trembling, praying for you to live,\r\nand now you are Lee again, and will live on. Professor Barter has\r\npromised me. All you need now is food, and care, and I shall shower\r\nyou with both. Barter has instructed me so carefully that I could\r\nmanage even to care for you, sick as you are, without him here at\r\nall.\"\r\n\r\n\"And Manape?\" Bentley's voice seemed to be stronger.\r\n\r\n\"He is dead,\" whispered Ellen. \"I shall never forget him. There was\r\nsomething great, something even better than human about him, Lee! Oh,\r\nI know that he was you--but where would all three of us have been had\r\nit not been for the powerful body of Manape, the great ape? Manape is\r\ndead, and in the jungle hereabouts the great apes mourn his passing.\r\nThey've been wailing almost like human beings for a week.\r\nManape--well, Professor Barter told me that you too would have died,\r\nhad Manape reached his door five minutes later. As it was, he, and\r\nyou, were just in time!\"\r\n\r\n\"It's amazing,\" whispered Bentley, \"that the great apes stay around\r\nhere now that Manape is dead.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. It's strange--and terrible I think. There have been times when I\r\nfelt they were waiting for something, for Professor Barter, perhaps.\r\nI've had the feeling they believe he killed their leader.\"\r\n\r\nNow the two became silent, and Ellen held the bruised and broken hands\r\nof Bentley in both her own, and their eyes said things, one to the\r\nother, which eyes say so much better than lips do. They kissed each\r\nother softly, and Ellen crooned with ecstasy, her cheek against\r\nBentley's.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen Caleb Barter entered.\r\n\r\n\"Well, well,\" he said, \"when a man is in condition to make love to a\r\nwoman, he is well on the road to recovery. It won't hurt you to talk\r\nnow, Bentley, and before I begin asking questions, let me assure you\r\nthat you will suffer no ill effects from your experience.\"\r\n\r\n\"What of my memories?\" asked Bentley softly.\r\n\r\n\"Forget them!\" snapped Barter tartly. \"That is, after you have told me\r\neverything that has happened. Miss Estabrook has already told me her\r\nangle of the experiment. Now, talk please--and then I shall make you\r\nwell, and you shall both go into the world with me, and tell people\r\nthat what I have to tell is true!\"\r\n\r\nSo Bentley talked. Barter wrote like a man possessed. His fingers\r\nraced over the paper, repeating the words which fell from the lips of\r\nLee Bentley, beside whom Ellen sat, holding his hands. Now and again\r\nBarter uttered an ejaculation of fierce joy. He was like a child with\r\na toy that pleased him beyond words. He could scarcely wait for the\r\nwords to spill from the lips of Lee Bentley.\r\n\r\nWhen Bentley paused for breath, Barter exclaimed impatiently, and\r\nurged him to greater speed. He thought of but one thing, his\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\nAnd so at last Bentley had finished.\r\n\r\n\"That's all, Professor Barter!\" he said softly.\r\n\r\n\"All!\" cried Barter. \"Everything! Fame! Wealth! Adulation! There is\r\nnothing in the world Caleb Barter may not have when this story is\r\ntold! I can scarcely contain myself. You must hurry to be well in\r\norder that the world may be told at once.\"\r\n\r\nLaughing immoderately, Barter piled the manuscript he had written, and\r\nweighted it with a piece of rock. His face was a constant grin. His\r\nfingers trembled with eagerness. He could not contain himself.\r\n\r\nFinally, as though from sheer joy of what he had accomplished, he\r\nraced from the cabin, and out across the clearing. Ellen and Bentley\r\nsmiled at each other. Moments passed. Still came to their ears the\r\nmourning wails of the great apes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen suddenly there broke a sound so utterly appalling that the two\r\nwere frozen with terror for a moment. First it was the laughter of\r\nCaleb Barter. Then, mingled with the laughter, the bellowing,\r\nfrightful and paralyzing, of man apes challenging a hated enemy. The\r\ndrumming of ape fists on huge barrel chests. Then the laughter of\r\nBarter, dying away, ironic, terrible, into silence. Immediately\r\nafterward, high-pitched, mighty as the jungle itself, the concerted\r\ncries of half a dozen apes, as if bellowing their joy of the kill.\r\n\r\n\"They--they--\" began Ellen in a choked voice. \"The apes must have got\r\nProfessor Barter!\"\r\n\r\nSilently Bentley nodded, and pointed.\r\n\r\nCoiled on a nail near the door was Barter's whip. In his excitement he\r\nhad gone into the jungle without it for the first--and last--time.\r\n\r\n\"There is one thing to do,\" whispered Ellen, \"before we prepare to get\r\nyou fully well. I shall care for you, and we shall both try to forget.\r\nAnd then we shall return to our own people.\"\r\n\r\n\"And the one thing?\" asked Bentley.\r\n\r\nThe strained silence was suddenly broken by the bellowing of the great\r\napes, which now charged into the cabin. Bentley and Ellen cringed back\r\nfrom the murderous brutes to no avail. There was no denying them.\r\nTheir slavering jaws, drooled below flaring nostrils, their eyes\r\nemitted sparks of animal fury. Bentley leaped to the girl and\r\ninterposed his body between hers and the vanguard of the apes, who now\r\nwere surging into the room through the open door, and spreading apart\r\nwithin like water released from a dam.\r\n\r\nThe apes were bent on murder, there could be no doubt.\r\n\r\nA very monster towered over Bentley. His jaws were wide, his little\r\nred eyes fixed on the white man's neck. His great arms were coming\r\nforward to gather in both Ellen and Bentley--whom he could crush as\r\neasily as he crushed the grubs which were his food.\r\n\r\nBentley was helpless and knew it. This was the end for Ellen and\r\nhimself. He must meet it unafraid. He tensed, awaiting the descent of\r\nbestial destruction. His eyes met the murderous gleam in the eyes of\r\nthe ape leader unflinchingly. And then the miracle happened.\r\n\r\nThe brute became suddenly and inexplicably hesitant. His bellow died\r\naway to a gurgling murmur in which there seemed somehow a hint of\r\napology. The fire went out of his eyes. His jaws closed with a snap.\r\nHis great arms, already about Bentley, slid harmlessly over Bentley's\r\nshoulders; dropped to his shaggy side.\r\n\r\nThe brute's little eyes looked long and in puzzled fashion into the\r\neyes of Bentley. Then he began to chatter, and in a moment the other\r\napes ambled grotesquely toward the door and out. Ellen and Bentley\r\nwere alone together once more, unharmed--though numbed by realization\r\nof the near passing of disaster.\r\n\r\n\"I don't understand it,\" muttered Bentley, brushing the beads of\r\nperspiration from his brow. \"It was a miracle!\"\r\n\r\n\"Lee,\" Ellen answered, \"I think I know, and it _is_ a sort of miracle.\r\nSomehow the apes felt that you were--whatever your guise--Manape. They\r\ndid not recognize you by any of their means of recognition; yet that\r\nbeast knew! How? Only God Himself might answer. But the beasts knew,\r\nand did not slay us. The inner voice which whispers inside us in times\r\nof crises, whispers also to the great apes! Barter, then must have\r\nunderstood their somehow spiritual kinship with us. His experiments--\"\r\n\r\nHer words reminded Bentley of what she had been saying when the great\r\napes had charged in upon them, murder bent. He interrupted her,\r\ngently.\r\n\r\n\"And the one thing we must do?\" he rallied her.\r\n\r\nEllen rose, and her face was white and strained as she gathered\r\ntogether Barter's manuscript. This she carried to the fireplace. She\r\napplied a match and returned to Bentley's bedside. Then, side by side,\r\nthe two who would never forget in any case watched the record of\r\nBarter's unholy experiment burn slowly to ashes, while the screams of\r\nthe great apes died away second by second, proof that they were\r\nleaving this section of the jungle--going deeper and deeper into the\r\nforest gloom which was their rightful heritage, and from which no man\r\nhad a right to take them.\r\n\r\n[Advertisement]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nHolocaust\r\n\r\n_By Charles Willard Diffin_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: It passed beneath the planes, that were motionless by\r\ncontrast.]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: The extraordinary story of \"Paul,\" who for thirty days was\r\nDictator of the World.]\r\n\r\nI am more accustomed to the handling of steel ingots and the\r\nfabrication of ships than to building with words. But, if I cannot\r\nwrite history as history is written, perhaps I can write it the way it\r\nis lived, and that must suffice.\r\n\r\nThis account of certain events must have a title, I am told. I have\r\nused, as you see: \"Holocaust.\" Inadequate!--but what word can tell\r\neven faintly of that reign of terror that engulfed the world, of those\r\nterrible thirty days in America when dread and horror gripped the\r\nnation and the red menace, like a wall of fire, swept downward from\r\nthe north? And, at last--the end!\r\n\r\nIt was given to me to know something of that conflict and of its\r\nending and of the man who, in that last day, took command of Earth's\r\nevents and gave battle to Mars, the God of War himself. It was against\r\nthe background of war that he stood out; I must tell it in that way;\r\nand perhaps my own experience will be of interest. Yet it is of the\r\nman I would write more than the war--the most hated man in the whole\r\nworld--that strange character, Paul Stravoinski.\r\n\r\nYou do not even recognize the name. But, if I were to say instead the\r\none word, \"Paul\"--ah, now I can see some of you start abruptly in\r\nsudden, wide-eyed attention, while the breath catches in your throats\r\nand the memory of a strange dread clutches your hearts.\r\n\r\n'Straki,' we called him at college. He was never \"Paul,\" except to me\r\nalone; there was never the easy familiarity between him and the crowd\r\nat large, whose members were \"Bill\" and \"Dick\" and other nicknames\r\nunprintable.\r\n\r\nBut \"Straki\" he accepted. \"_Bien, mon cher ami_,\" he told me--he was\r\nas apt to drop into French as Russian or any of a dozen other\r\nlanguages--\"a name--what is it? A label by which we distinguish one\r\npackage of goods from a thousand others just like it! I am unlike: for\r\nme one name is as good as another. It is what is here that\r\ncounts,\"--he tapped his broad forehead that rose high to the tangle of\r\nblack hair--\"and here,\"--and this time he placed one hand above his\r\nheart.\r\n\r\n\"It is for what I give to the world of my head and my heart that I\r\nmust be remembered. And, if I give nothing--then the name, it is less\r\nthan nothing.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDreamer--poet--scientist--there were many Paul Strakis in that one\r\nman. Brilliant in his work--he was majoring in chemistry--he was a\r\nmathematician who was never stopped. I've seen him pause, puzzled by\r\nsome phase of a problem that, to me, was a blank wall. Only a moment's\r\nhesitation and he would go way down to the bed-rock of mathematics and\r\ncome up with a brand new formula of his own devising. Then--\"_Voila!\r\nC'est fini!_ let us go for a walk, friend Bob; there is some poetry\r\nthat I have remembered--\" And we would head out of town, while he\r\nspouted poetry by the yard--and made me like it.\r\n\r\nI wish you could see the Paul Straki of those days. I wish I could\r\nshow him to you; you would understand so much better the \"Paul\" of\r\nthese later times.\r\n\r\nTall, he seemed, though his eyes were only level with mine, for his\r\nreal height was hidden beneath an habitual stoop. It let him conceal,\r\nto some extent, his lameness. He always walked with a noticeable limp,\r\nand here was the cause of the only bitterness that, in those days, was\r\never reflected in his face.\r\n\r\n\"Cossacks!\" he explained when he surprised a questioning look upon my\r\nface. \"They went through our village. I was two years old--and they\r\nrode me down!\"\r\n\r\nBut the hard coldness went from his eyes, and again they crinkled\r\nabout with the kindly, wise lines that seemed so strange in his young\r\nface. \"It is only a reminder to me,\" he added, \"that such things are\r\nall in the past; that we are entering a new world where savage\r\nbrutality shall no longer rule, and the brotherhood of man will be the\r\nbasis upon which men shall build.\"\r\n\r\nAnd his face, so homely that it was distinctive, had a beauty all its\r\nown when he dared to voice his dreams.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was this that brought about his expulsion from college. That was in\r\n1935 when the Vornikoff faction brought off their coup d'etat and\r\nsecured a strangle hold on Russia. We all remember the campaign of\r\npropaganda that was forced into the very fibre of every country, to\r\nweaken with its insidious dry-rot the safe foundations of our very\r\ncivilization. Paul was blinded by his idealism, and he dared to speak.\r\n\r\nHe was conducting a brilliant research into the structure of the atom;\r\nit ended abruptly with his dismissal. And the accepted theories of\r\nscience went unchallenged, while men worked along other lines than\r\nPaul's to attempt the release of the tremendous energy that is latent\r\nin all matter.\r\n\r\nI saw him perhaps three times in the four years that followed. He had\r\na laboratory out in a God-forsaken spot where he carried on his\r\nresearch. He did enough analytical work to keep him from actual\r\nstarvation, though it seemed to me that he was uncomfortably close to\r\nthat point.\r\n\r\n\"Come with me,\" I urged him; \"I need you. You can have the run of our\r\nlaboratories--work out the new alloys that are so much needed. You\r\nwould be tremendously valuable.\"\r\n\r\nHe had mentioned Maida to me, so I added: \"And you and Maida can be\r\nmarried, and can live like a king and queen on what my outfit can pay\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled at me as he might have done toward a child. \"Like a king and\r\nqueen,\" he said. \"But, friend Bob, Maida and I do not approve of kings\r\nand queens, nor do we wish to follow them in their follies.\r\n\r\n\"It is hard waiting,\"--I saw his eyes cloud for a moment--\"but Maida\r\nis willing. She is working, too--she is up in Melford as you know--and\r\nshe has faith in my work. She sees with me that it will mean the\r\nrelease of our fellow-men and women from the poverty that grinds out\r\ntheir souls. I am near to success; and when I give to the world the\r\nsecret of power, then--\" But I had to read in his far-seeing eyes the\r\nvisions he could not compass in words.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat was the first time. I was flying a new ship when next I dropped\r\nin on him. A sweet little job I thought it then, not like the old\r\nbusses that Paul and I had trained in at college, where the top speed\r\nwas a hundred and twenty. This was an A. B. Clinton cruiser, and the\r\n\"A.B.C.'s\" in 1933 were good little wagons, the best there were.\r\n\r\nI asked Paul to take a hop with me and fly the ship. He could fly\r\nbeautifully; his lameness had been no hindrance to him. In his\r\nslender, artist hands a ship became a live thing.\r\n\r\n\"Are you doing any flying?\" I asked, but the threadbare suit made his\r\nanswer unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\"I'll do my flying later,\" he said, \"and when I do,\"--he waved\r\ncontemptuously toward my shining, new ship--\"you'll scrap that piece\r\nof junk.\"\r\n\r\nThe tone matched the new lines in his face--deep lines and bitter.\r\nThis practical world has always been hard on the dreamers.\r\n\r\nPoverty; and the grinding struggle that Maida was having; the\r\nexpulsion from college when he was assured of a research scholarship\r\nthat would have meant independence and the finest of equipment to work\r\nwith--all this, I found, was having its effect. And he talked in a way\r\nI didn't like of the new Russia and of the time that was near at hand\r\nwhen her communistic government should sweep the world of its curse of\r\ncapitalistic control. Their propaganda campaign was still going on,\r\nand I gathered that Paul had allied himself with them.\r\n\r\nI tried to tell him what we all knew; that the old Russia was gone,\r\nthat Vornikoff and his crowd were rapacious and bloodthirsty, that\r\ntheir real motives were as far removed from his idealism as one pole\r\nfrom the other. But it was no use. And I left when I saw the light in\r\nhis eyes. It seemed to me then that Paul Stravoinski had driven his\r\nsplendid brain a bit beyond its breaking point.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnother year--and Paris, in 1939, with the dreaded First of May\r\ndrawing near. There had been rumors of demonstrations in every land,\r\nbut the French were prepared to cope with them--or so they\r\nbelieved.... Who could have coped with the menace of the north that\r\nwas gathering itself for a spring?\r\n\r\nI saw Paul there. It lacked two days of the First of May, and he was\r\nseated with a group of industrious talkers at a secluded table in a\r\ncafe. He crossed over when he saw me, and drew me aside. And I noticed\r\nthat a quiet man at a table nearby never let us out of his sight. Paul\r\nand his companions, I judged, were under observation.\r\n\r\n\"What are you doing here _now_?\" he asked. His manner was casual\r\nenough to anyone watching, but the tense voice and the look in his\r\neyes that bored into me were anything but casual.\r\n\r\nMy resentment was only natural. \"And why shouldn't I be here attending\r\nto my own affairs? Do you realize that you are being rather absurd?\"\r\n\r\nHe didn't bother to answer me directly. \"I can't control them,\" he\r\nsaid. \"If they would only wait--a few weeks--another month! God, how I\r\nprayed to them at--\"\r\n\r\nHe broke off short. His eyes never moved, yet I sensed a furtiveness\r\nas marked as if he had peered suspiciously about.\r\n\r\nSuddenly he laughed aloud, as if at some joking remark of mine; I\r\nknew it was for the benefit of those he had left and not for the quiet\r\nman from the _Surete_. And now his tone was quietly conversational.\r\n\r\n\"Smile!\" he said. \"Smile, Bob!--we're just having a friendly talk. I\r\nwon't live another two hours if they think anything else. But, Bob, my\r\nfriend--for God's sake, Bob, leave Paris to-night. I am taking the\r\nmidnight plane on the Transatlantic Line. Come with me--\"\r\n\r\nOne of the group at the table had risen; he was sauntering in our\r\ndirection. I played up to Paul's lead.\r\n\r\n\"Glad I ran across you,\" I told him, and shook his extended hand that\r\ngripped mine in an agony of pleading. \"I'll be seeing you in New York\r\none of these days; I am going back soon.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut I didn't go soon enough. The unspoken pleading in Paul\r\nStravoinski's eyes lost its hold on me by another day. I had work to\r\ndo; why should I neglect it to go scuttling home because someone who\r\nfeared these swarming rats had begged me to run for cover? And the\r\nFrench people were prepared. A little rioting, perhaps; a pistol shot\r\nor two, and a machine-gun that would spring from nowhere and sweep the\r\nstreet--!\r\n\r\nWe know now of the document that the Russian Ambassador delivered to\r\nthe President of France, though no one knew of it then. He handed it\r\nto the portly, bearded President at ten o'clock on the morning of\r\nApril thirtieth. And the building that had housed the Russian\r\nrepresentatives was empty ten minutes later. Their disguises must have\r\nbeen ready, for if the sewers of Paris had swallowed them they could\r\nhave vanished no more suddenly.\r\n\r\nAnd the document? It was the same in substance as those delivered in\r\nlike manner in every capital of Europe: twenty-four hours were given\r\nin which to assure the Central Council of Russia that the French\r\nGovernment would be dissolved, that communism would be established,\r\nand that its executive heads would be appointed by the Central\r\nCouncil.\r\n\r\nAnd then the bulletins appeared, and the exodus began. Papers floated\r\nin the air; they blew in hundreds of whirling eddies through the\r\nstreets. And they warned all true followers of the glorious Russian\r\nfaith to leave Paris that day, for to-morrow would herald the dawn of\r\na new heaven on earth--a Communistic heaven--and its birth would come\r\nwith the destruction of Paris....\r\n\r\nI give you the general meaning though not the exact words. And, like\r\nthe rest, I smiled tolerantly as I saw the stream of men and women and\r\nfrightened children that filtered from the city all that day and\r\nnight; but I must admit that our smiles were strained as morning came\r\non the First of May, and the hour of ten drew near.\r\n\r\nParis, the beautiful--that lovely blossom, flowering on the sturdy\r\nstalk that was _La Belle France_! Paris, laughing to cover its\r\nunspoken fears that morning in May, while the streets thudded to the\r\nfeet of marching men in horizon blue, and the air above was vibrant\r\nwith the endless roar of planes.\r\n\r\nThis meant war; and mobilization orders were out; yet still the deadly\r\nmenace was blurred by a feeling of unreality. A hoax!--a huge\r\njoke!--it was absurd, the thought of a distant people imposing their\r\nwill upon France! And yet ... and yet....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere were countless eyes turned skyward as a thousand bells rang out\r\nthe hour of ten; and countless ears heard faintly the sound of gunfire\r\nfrom the north.\r\n\r\nMy work had brought me into contact with high officials of the French\r\nGovernment; I was privileged to stand with a group of them where a\r\nhigh-roofed building gave a vantage point for observation. With them I\r\nsaw the menacing specks on the horizon; I saw them come on with deadly\r\ndeliberation--come on and on in an ever-growing armada that filled the\r\nsky.\r\n\r\nWireless had brought the report of their flight high over Germany; it\r\nwas bringing now the story of disaster from the northern front. A\r\nheavy air-force had been concentrated there; and now the steady stream\r\nof radio messages came on flimsy sheets to the group about me, while\r\nthey clustered to read the incredible words. They cursed and glared at\r\none another, those French officials, as if daring their fellows to\r\nbelieve the truth; then, silent and white of face, they reached numbly\r\nfor each following sheet that messengers brought--until they knew at\r\nlast that the air-force of France was no more....\r\n\r\nThe roar of the approaching host was deafening in our ears. Red--red\r\nas blood!--and each unit grew to enormous proportions. Armored\r\ncruisers of the air--dreadnaughts!--they came as a complete surprise.\r\n\r\n\"But the city is ringed with anti-aircraft batteries,\" a uniformed man\r\nwas whispering. \"They will bring the brutes down.\"\r\n\r\nThe northern edge of the city flamed to a roaring wall of fire; the\r\nbatteries went into action in a single, crashing harmony that sang\r\ntriumphantly in our ears. A few of the red shapes fell, but for each\r\nof these a hundred others swept down in deadly, directed flight.\r\n\r\nA glass was in my hand; my eyes strained through it to see the silvery\r\ncylinders that fell from the speeding ships. I saw the red cruisers\r\nsweep upward before the inferno of exploding bombs raged toward them\r\nfrom below. And where the roar of batteries had been was only\r\nsilence.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe fleet was over the city. We waited for the rain of bombs that must\r\ncome; we saw the red cloud move swiftly to continue the annihilation\r\nof batteries that still could fire; we saw the armada pass on and lose\r\nitself among cloud-banks in the west.\r\n\r\nOnly a dozen planes remained, high-hung in the upper air. We stared in\r\nwonderment at one another. Was this mercy?--from such an enemy? It was\r\ninconceivable!\r\n\r\n\"Mercy!\" I wonder that we dared to think the word. Only an instant\r\ntill a whistling shriek marked the coming of death. It was a single\r\nplane--a giant shell--that rode on wings of steel. It came from the\r\nnorth, and I saw it pass close overhead. Its propeller screamed an\r\ninsolent, inhuman challenge. Inhuman--for one glance told the story.\r\nHere was no man-flown plane: no cockpit or cabin, no gunmounts. Only a\r\nflying shell that swerved and swung as we watched. We knew that its\r\ncourse was directed from above; it was swung with terrible certainty\r\nby a wireless control that reached it from a ship overhead.\r\n\r\nSlowly it sought its target: deliberately it poised above it. An instant,\r\nonly, it hung, though the moment, it seemed, would never end--then\r\ndown!--and the blunt nose crashed into the Government buildings where at\r\nthat moment the Chamber of Deputies was in session ... and where those\r\nbuildings had been was spouting masonry and fire.\r\n\r\nA man had me by the arm; his fingers gripped into my flesh. With his\r\nother hand he was pointing toward the north. \"Torpedoes!\" he was\r\nsaying. \"Torpedoes of a size gigantic! _Ah, mon Dieu! mon Dieu!_ Save\r\nus for we are lost!\"\r\n\r\nThey came in an endless stream, those blood-red projectiles; they\r\nannounced their coming with shrill cries of varying pitch; and they\r\nswung and swerved, as the ships above us picked them up, to rake the\r\ncity with mathematical precision.\r\n\r\nIncendiary, of course: flames followed every shattering burst. Between\r\nus and the Seine was a hell of fire--a hell that contained unnumbered\r\nthousands of what an instant before had been living folk--men and\r\nwomen clinging in a last terrified embrace--children whose white faces\r\nwere hidden in their mothers' skirts or buried in bosoms no longer a\r\nrefuge for childish fears. I saw it as plainly as if I had been given\r\nthe far-reaching vision of a god ... and I turned and ran with\r\nstumbling feet where a stairway awaited....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOf that flight, only a blurred recollection has stayed with me. I pray\r\nGod that I may never see it more clearly. There are sights that mortal\r\neyes cannot behold with understanding and leave mortal brain intact.\r\nIt is like an anaesthetic at such times, the numbness that blocks off\r\nthe horrors the eyes are recording--like the hurt of the surgeon's\r\nscalpel that never reaches to the brain.\r\n\r\nDimly I see the fragmentary scenes: the crashing fall of buildings\r\nthat come crumbling and thundering down, myself crawling like an\r\ninsect across the wreckage--it is slippery and wet where the stones\r\nare red, and I stumble, then see the torn and mangled thing that has\r\ncaused me to fall.... A face regards me from another mound. I see the\r\ndust of powdered masonry still settling upon it: the dark hair is\r\nhardly disturbed about the face, so peaceful, so girlishly serene: I\r\nam still wondering dully why there is only the head of that girl\r\nresting on the shattered stone, as I lie there exhausted and watch the\r\nnext torpedo crash a block behind me.... The air is shrill with flying\r\nfragments. I wonder why my hands are stained and sticky as I run and\r\ncrawl on my way. The red rocks are less slippery now, and the rats,\r\nfrom the sewers of Paris!--they have come out to feed!\r\n\r\nFragments of pictures--and the worst of them gone! I know that night\r\ncame--red night, under a cloud of smoke--and I found myself on the\r\nfollowing day descending from a fugitive peasant's cart and plodding\r\nonward toward the markings of a commercial aerodrome.\r\n\r\nThey could not be everywhere, those red vultures of the sky, and they\r\nhad other devils'-work to do. I had money, and I paid well for the\r\nplane that carried me through that day and a night to the Municipal\r\nAirport of New York.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Red Army of occupation was halfway across communist Germany,\r\nhailed as they went as the saviors of the world. London had gone the\r\nway of Paris; Rome had followed; the countries of France and England\r\nand Italy were beaten to their knees.\r\n\r\n\"We who rule the air rule the world!\" boasted General Vornikoff. The\r\nRussian broadcasting station had the insolence to put on the air his\r\nmessage to the people of America. I heard his voice as plainly as if\r\nhe stood in my office; and I was seeing again the coming of that\r\nendless stream of aerial torpedoes, and the red cruisers hanging in\r\nthe heights to pick up control and dash the messengers of death upon a\r\nhelpless city. But I was visioning it in New York.\r\n\r\n\"The masses of the American people are with us,\" said the complacently\r\narrogant voice. \"For our fellow-workers we have only brotherly\r\naffection; it is your capitalist-dominated Government that must\r\nsubmit. And if it does not--!\" I heard him laugh before he went on:\r\n\r\n\"We are coming to the rescue of you, our brothers across the sea. Now\r\nwe have work to do in Europe; our gains must be consolidated and the\r\nconquests of our glorious air-force made secure. And then--! We warn\r\nyou in advance, and we laugh at your efforts to prepare for our\r\ncoming. We even tell you the date: in thirty days the invasion begins.\r\nIt will end only at Washington when the great country of America, its\r\ncruel shackles cast off from the laboring masses, joins the\r\nBrotherhood--the Workers of the World!\"\r\n\r\nThere was a man from the War Department who sat across from me at my\r\ndesk; my factories were being taken over; my electric furnaces must\r\npour out molten metal for use in war. He cursed softly under his\r\nbreath as the voice ceased.\r\n\r\n\"The dirty dog!\" he exclaimed. \"The lying hypocrite! He talks of\r\nbrotherhood to us who know the damnable inquisition and reign of\r\nterror that he and his crowd have forced on Russia! Thirty days! Well,\r\nwe have three thousand planes ready for battle to-day; there'll be\r\nmore in thirty days! Now, about that vanadium steel--\"\r\n\r\nBut I'll confess I hardly heard him; I was hearing the roar of an\r\narmada of red craft that ensanguined the sky, and I was seeing the\r\ncurving flight of torpedoes, each an airplane in itself....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThirty days!--and each minute of each hour must be used. In close\r\ntouch with the War Department, I knew much that was going on, and all\r\nthat I knew was the merest trifle in the vast preparations for\r\ndefense. My earlier apprehensions were dulled; the sight I had of the\r\nwhole force of a mighty nation welded into one driving power working\r\nto one definite end was exhilarating.\r\n\r\nNew York and Washington--these, it was felt, would be the points of\r\nfirst attack; they must be protected. And I saw the flights of planes\r\nthat seemed endless as they converged at the concentration camps.\r\nFighters, at first--bombers and swift scouts--they came in from all\r\nparts of the land. Then the passenger planes and the big mail-ships.\r\nTranscontinental runs were abandoned or cut to a skeleton service of a\r\nship every hour for the transport of Government men. Even the slower\r\ncraft of the feeder lines were commandeered; anything that could fly\r\nand could mount a gun.\r\n\r\nAnd the three thousand fighting ships, as the man from Washington had\r\nsaid, grew to three times that number. Their roaring filled the skies\r\nwith thunder, and beneath them were other camps of infantry and\r\nartillery.\r\n\r\nThe Atlantic front was an armed camp, where highways no longer carried\r\nthousands of cars on pleasure bent. By night and day I saw those\r\nfamiliar roads from the air; they were solid with a never-ending line\r\nof busses and vans and long processions of motorized artillery and\r\ntanks, whose clattering bedlam came to me a thousand feet above.\r\n\r\nYes, it was an inspiring sight, and I lost the deadly oppression and\r\nthe sense of impending doom--until our intelligence service told us of\r\nthe sailing of the enemy fleet.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey had seized every vessel in the waters of Europe. And--God pity\r\nthe poor, traitorous devils who manned them--there were plenty to\r\noperate the ships. Two thousand vessels were in that convoy. Ringed in\r\nas they were by a guard of destroyers and fighting craft of many\r\nkinds, whose mast-heads carried the blood-red flag now instead of\r\ntheir former emblems, our submarines couldn't reach them.\r\n\r\nBut our own fleet went out to measure their strength, and a thousand\r\nNavy planes took the air on the following day.\r\n\r\nUppermost in my own mind, and in everyone's mind, I think, was the\r\nquestion of air-force.\r\n\r\nWould they bring the red ships? What was their cruising range? Could\r\nthey cross the Atlantic with their enormous load of armored hull, or\r\nmust they be transported? Were the air-cruisers with the fleet, or\r\nwould they come later?\r\n\r\nHow Vornikoff and his assassins must have laughed as they built the\r\nmonsters, armored them, and mounted the heavy guns so much greater\r\nthan anything they would meet! The rest of us--all the rest of the\r\nworld!--had been kept in ignorance.... And now our own fliers were\r\nsweeping out over the gray waters to find the answer to our questions.\r\n\r\nI've tried to picture that battle; I've tried to imagine the feelings\r\nof those men on the dreadnaughts and battle-cruisers and destroyers.\r\nThere was no attempt on the enemy's part to conceal his position; his\r\nwireless was crackling through the air with messages that our\r\nintelligence department easily decoded. Our Navy fliers roared out\r\nover the sea, out and over the American fleet, whose every bow was a\r\nline of white that told of their haste to meet the oncoming horde.\r\n\r\nThe plane-carriers threw their fighters into the air to join the\r\ncavalcade above--and a trace of smoke over the horizon told that the\r\ngiant fleet was coming into range.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAnd then, instead of positions and ranges flashed back from our own swift\r\nscouts, came messages of the enemy's attack. Our men must have seen them\r\nfrom the towers of our own fleet; they must have known what the red swarm\r\nmeant, as it came like rolling, fire-lit smoke far out in the sky--and\r\nthey must have read plainly their own helplessness as they saw our\r\nthousand planes go down. They were overwhelmed--obliterated!--and the red\r\nhorde of air-cruisers was hardly checked in its sweep.\r\n\r\nCarnage and destruction, those blue seas of the north Atlantic have\r\nseen; they could tell tales of brave men, bravely going to their death\r\nin storm and calm but never have they seen another such slaughter as\r\nthat day's sun showed.\r\n\r\nThe anti-aircraft guns roared vainly; some few of our own planes that\r\nhad escaped returned to add their futile, puny blows. The waters about\r\nthe ships were torn to foam, while the ships themselves were changed\r\nto furnaces of bursting flame--until the seas in mercy closed above\r\nthem and took their torn steel, and the shattered bodies that they\r\nheld, to the silence of the deep....\r\n\r\nWe got it all at Washington. I sat in a room with a group of\r\nwhite-faced men who stared blindly at a radiocone where a quiet voice\r\nwas telling of disaster. It was Admiral Graymont speaking to us from\r\nthe bridge of the big dreadnaught, _Lincoln_, the flagship of the\r\ncombined fleet. Good old Graymont! His best friend, Bill Schuler,\r\nSecretary of the Navy, was sitting wordless there beside me.\r\n\r\n\"It is the end,\" the quiet voice was saying; \"the cruiser squadrons\r\nare gone.... Two more battleships have gone down: there are only five\r\nof us left.... A squadron of enemy planes is coming in above. Our men\r\nhave fought bravely and with never a chance.... There!--they've got\r\nus!--the bombs! Good-by, Bill, old fellow--\"\r\n\r\nThe radiocone was silent with a silence that roared deafeningly in our\r\nears. And, beside me, I saw the Secretary of the Navy, a Navy now\r\nwithout ships or men, drop his tired, lined face into his hands, while\r\nhis broad shoulders shook convulsively. The rest of us remained in our\r\nchairs, too stunned to do anything but look at one another in horror.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe expected them to strike at New York. I was sent up there, and it\r\nwas there that I saw Paul again. I met him on lower Broadway, and I\r\nwent up to him with my hand reaching for his. I didn't admire Paul's\r\naffiliations, but he had warned me--he had tried to save my life--and\r\nI wanted to thank him.\r\n\r\nBut his hand did not meet mine. There was a strange, wild look in his\r\neyes--I couldn't define it--and he brought his gaze back from far off\r\nto stare at me as if I were a stranger.\r\n\r\nThen: \"Still got that A.B.C. ship?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I answered wonderingly.\r\n\r\n\"Junk it!\" he said. And his laugh was as wild and incomprehensible as\r\nhis look had been. I stared after him as he walked away. I was\r\npuzzled, but there were other things to think of then.\r\n\r\nA frenzy of preparation--and all in vain. The enemy fooled us; the\r\nradio brought the word from Quebec.\r\n\r\n\"They have entered the St. Lawrence,\" was the message it flashed.\r\nThen, later: \"The Red fleet is passing toward Montreal. Enemy planes\r\nhave spotted all radio towers. There is one above us now--\" And that\r\nended the message from Quebec.\r\n\r\nBut we got more information later. They landed near Montreal; they\r\nwere preparing a great base for offensive operations; the country was\r\noverrun with a million men; the sky was full of planes by night and\r\nday; there was no artillery, no field guns of any sort, but there were\r\ntorpedo-planes by tens of thousands, which made red fields of waiting\r\ndeath where trucks placed them as they took them from the ships.\r\n\r\nAnd there were some of us who smiled sardonically in recollection of\r\nthe mammoth plants the Vornikoff Reds had installed in Central Russia,\r\nand the plaudits that had greeted their plans for nitrogen fixation.\r\nThey were to make fertilizers; the nitrates would be distributed\r\nwithout cost to the farms--this had pacified the Agrarians--and here\r\nwere their \"nitrates\" that were to make fertile the fields of Russia:\r\ncountless thousands of tons of nitro-explosives in these flying\r\ntorpedoes!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut if we smiled mirthlessly at these recollections we worked while we\r\nchewed on our cud of bitterness. There came an order: \"Evacuate New\r\nEngland,\" and the job was given to me.\r\n\r\nWith planes--a thousand of them--trucks, vans, the railroads, we\r\ngathered those terrified people into concentration camps, and took\r\nthem over the ground, under the ground, and through the air to the\r\ndistributing camp at Buffalo, where they were scattered to other\r\npoints.\r\n\r\nI saw the preparations for a battle-front below me as I skimmed over\r\nConnecticut. Trenches made a thin line that went farther than I could\r\nsee! Here was the dam that was expected to stop the enemy columns from\r\nthe north. I think no one then believed that our air-force could check\r\nthe assault. The men of the fighting planes were marked for death; one\r\nread it in their eyes; but who of us was not?\r\n\r\nHow those giant cruisers would be downed no man could say, but we\r\nworked on in a blind desperation; we would hold that invading army as\r\nlong as men could sight a gun; we would hold them back; and somehow,\r\nsomeway, we must find the means to repel the invasion from the air!\r\n\r\nI saw the lines of track that made a network back to the trenches.\r\nLike the suburban lines around New York, they would carry thousands of\r\nsingle cars, each driven at terrific speed by the air plane propeller\r\nat its bow. With these, the commanders could shift their forces to\r\nwhatever sector was hardest pressed. They would be bombed, of course,\r\nbut the hundreds of tracks would not all be destroyed--and the line\r\nmust be held!\r\n\r\nThe line! it brought a strangling lump to my throat as I saw those\r\nthin markings of trenches, the marching bodies of troops, the brave,\r\nhopeless, determined men who went singing to their places in that\r\nline. But my planes were winging past me; my job was ahead, where a\r\nmultitude still waited and prayed for deliverance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe never finished the job; in two days the red horde was upon us.\r\nTheir swarming troops were convoyed by planes, but no effort was made\r\nto fly over our lines and launch an attack. Were they feeling their\r\nway? Did they think now that they would find us passive and\r\nunresisting? Did they want to take our cities undamaged? Oh, we asked\r\nourselves a thousand questions with no answer to any--except the\r\nknowledge that a million men were marching from the north; that their\r\nfleet of planes would attack as soon as the troops encountered\r\nresistance; that our batteries of anti-aircraft guns would harry them\r\nas they came, and our air-fleet, held back in reserve, would take what\r\nthe batteries left....\r\n\r\nMy last planes with their fugitive loads passed close to the lines of\r\nred troops. There were red planes overhead, but they let us pass\r\nunhindered. Fleeing, driving wildly toward the south, we were\r\nunworthy, it seemed, of even their contemptuous attention. But I was\r\nsick to actual nausea at sight of the villages and cities where only a\r\npart of the population had escaped. The roads, in front of the red\r\ncolumns, were jammed with motors and with men and women and children\r\non foot: a hopeless tangle.\r\n\r\nI was watching the pitiful flight below me, cursing my own impotence\r\nto be of help, when a shrill whistling froze me rigid to my controls.\r\nI had heard it before--there could be no mistaking the cry of that\r\noncoming torpedo--and I saw the damnable thing pass close to my ship.\r\n\r\nI was doing two hundred--my motor was throttled down--but this inhuman\r\nmonster passed me as if my ship were frozen as unmoving as myself. It\r\ntore on ahead. I saw an enemy plane above it some five thousand feet.\r\nThe torpedo was checked; I saw it poise; then it curved over and down.\r\nAnd the screaming motor took up its cry that was like a thousand\r\ndevils until its sound was lost in the screams from below and the\r\ninfernal blast of its own explosion.\r\n\r\nOnly a trial flight--an experiment to test their controls! No need for\r\nme to try to tell you of the thoughts that tore me through and through\r\nwhile I struggled to bring my ship to an even keel in the hurricane of\r\nexplosion that drove up at me from below. But I spat out the one word:\r\n\"Brotherhood!\" and I prayed for a place in the front line where I\r\nmight send one shot at least against so beastly a foe.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat was somewhere in Massachusetts. Their foremost columns were close\r\nbehind. They came to a stop some fifty miles from our waiting line of\r\nbattle: I learned this when I got to Washington. And the reason, too,\r\nwas known; it was published in all the papers. There had been messages\r\nto the President, broadcast to the world from an unknown source:\r\n\r\n\"To the President of the United States--warning! This war must end.\r\nYou, as Commander-in-Chief of the American forces can bring it to a\r\nclose. I have prevailed upon the Red Army of the Brotherhood to halt.\r\nThey have listened to me. You, also, must take heed.\r\n\r\n\"You will issue orders at once to withdraw all resistance. You will\r\ndisband your army, ground all your planes; bring all your artillery\r\ninto one place and prepare to turn the government of this country over\r\nto the representatives of the Central Council. You will act at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"This war is ended. All wars are ended forevermore. I have spoken.\"\r\n\r\nAnd the strange message was signed \"Paul.\"\r\n\r\nThe wild words of a maniac, it was thought at first. Yet the fact\r\nremained that the enemy's advance had ceased. Who was this \"Paul\" who\r\nhad \"prevailed upon the Red Army\" to halt?\r\n\r\nAnd then the obvious answer occurred; it was a ruse on the part of the\r\nReds. They feared to attack; their strength was not as great as we had\r\nthought--officers and men of all branches of the service took new\r\nheart and plunged more frenziedly still into the work of preparation.\r\n\r\nThere were direction-finders that had taken the message from several\r\nstations; their pointers converged upon one definite location in\r\nsouthern Ohio. Over an area of twenty square miles, that place was\r\ncombed for a sending radio where the message could have\r\noriginated--combed in vain.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe next demand came at ten on the following morning.\r\n\r\n\"To the President of the United States: You have disregarded my\r\nwarning. You will not do so again; I have power to enforce my demands.\r\nI had hoped that bloodshed and destruction might cease, but it is\r\nplain that only that will save you from your own headstrong folly. I\r\nmust strike. At noon to-day the Capitol in Washington will be\r\ndestroyed. See that it is emptied of human life. I have spoken. Paul.\"\r\n\r\nA maniac, surely; yet a maniac with strange powers. For the graphs of\r\nthe radio direction-finders showed a curve. And when they were\r\nassembled the reading could only mean that the instrument that had\r\nsent the threat had moved over fifty miles during the few minutes of\r\nits sending. This, I think, was what brought the order to vacate the\r\nbig domed building in Washington.\r\n\r\nOf course the Capitol Building had been searched; there was not a nook\r\nnor corner from roof to basement but had been gone over in search of\r\nan explosive machine. And now it was empty, and a guard of soldiers\r\nmade a solid cordon surrounding it. No one could approach upon the\r\nground; and, above, a series of circling patrol-planes, one squadron\r\nabove another, guarded against approach by air. With such a defense\r\nthe Capitol and its grounds seemed impregnable.\r\n\r\nMy watch said 11:59; I held it in my hand and watched the seconds tick\r\nslowly by. The city was hushed; it seemed that no man was so much as\r\nbreathing ... 11:59 :60!--and an instant later I heard the shriek of\r\nsomething that tore the air to screaming fragments. I saw it as it\r\ncame on a straight, level line from the east; a flash like a meteor of\r\nglistening white. It passed beneath the planes, that were motionless\r\nby contrast, drove straight for the gleaming Capitol dome, passed\r\nabove it, and swept on in a long flattened curve that bent outward and\r\nup.\r\n\r\nIt was gone from my sight, though the shrieking air was still tearing\r\nat my ears, when I saw the great building unfold. Time meant nothing;\r\nmy racing mind made slow and deliberate the explosion that lifted the\r\nroofs and threw the walls in dusty masses upon the ground. So slow it\r\nseemed!--and I had not even seen the shell that the white meteor-ship\r\nhad fired. Yet there was the beautiful building, expanding,\r\ndisintegrating. It was a cloud of dust when the concussion reached me\r\nto dash me breathless to the earth....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe white meteor was the vehicle of \"Paul,\" the dictator. From it had\r\ncome the radio message whose source had moved so swiftly. I saw this\r\nall plainly.\r\n\r\nThere was a conference of high officials at the War Department\r\nBuilding, and the Secretary summed up all that was said:\r\n\r\n\"A new form of air-flight, and a new weapon more destructive than any\r\nwe have known! That charge of explosive that was fired at the Capitol\r\nwas so small as to be unseen. We can't meet it; we can only fight.\r\nFight on till the end.\"\r\n\r\nA message came in as we sat there, a message to the Commander-in-Chief\r\nwho had come over from the White House under military guard.\r\n\r\n\"Surrender!\" it demanded; \"I have shown you my power; it is\r\ninexhaustible, unconquerable. Surrender or be destroyed; it is the\r\ndawn of a new day, the day of the Brotherhood of Man. Let bloodshed\r\ncease. Surrender! I command it! Paul.\"\r\n\r\nThe President of the United States held the flimsy paper in his hand.\r\nHe rose slowly to his feet, and he read it aloud to all of us\r\nassembled there; read it to the last hateful word. Then:\r\n\r\n\"Surrender?\" he asked. He turned steady, quiet eyes upon the big flag\r\nwhose red and white and blue made splendid the wall behind him--and\r\nI'll swear that I saw him smile.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe have had many presidents since '76; big men, some of them; tall,\r\nhandsome men; men who looked as if nature had moulded them for a high\r\nplace. This man was small of stature; the shortest man in all that\r\nroom if he had stood, but he was big--big! Only one who is great can\r\nlook deep through the whirling turmoil of the moment to find the\r\neternal verities that are always underneath--and smile!\r\n\r\n\"Men must die,\"--he spoke meditatively; in seeming communing with\r\nhimself, as one who tries to face a problem squarely and\r\nhonestly--\"and nations must pass; time overwhelms us all. Yet there is\r\nthat which never dies and never surrenders.\"\r\n\r\nHe looked about the room now, as if he saw us for the first time.\r\n\r\n\"Gentlemen,\" he said quietly, \"we have here an ultimatum. It is backed\r\nby power which our Secretary of War says is invincible. We are faced\r\nby an enemy who would annihilate these United States, and this new\r\npower fights on the side of the enemy.\r\n\r\n\"Must we go the way of England, of France, of all Europe? It would\r\nseem so. The United States of America is doomed. Yet each one of us\r\nwill meet what comes bravely, if, facing our own end, we know that the\r\nprinciples upon which this nation is founded must go on; if only the\r\nStars and Stripes still floats before our closing eyes to assure us\r\nthat some future day will see the resurrection of truth and of honor\r\nand kindness among men.\r\n\r\n\"We will fight, as our Secretary of War has said--fight on to the end.\r\nWe will surrender--never! That is our answer to this one who calls\r\nhimself 'Paul.'\"\r\n\r\nWe could not speak; I do not know how long the silence lasted. But I\r\nknow that I left that room a silent man among many silent men, in\r\nwhose eyes I saw a reflection of the emotion that filled my own heart.\r\nIt was the end--the end of America, of millions of American homes--but\r\nthis was better than surrender to such a foe. Better death than\r\nslavery to that race of bloodthirsty oppressors.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut who was \"Paul?\" This question kept coming repeatedly to my mind.\r\nThe press of the country echoed the President's words, then dipped\r\ntheir pens in vitriol to heap scorching invective upon the head of\r\nthe tyrant. The power of the Reds we might have met--or so it was\r\nfelt--but this new menace gave the invaders a weapon we could not\r\ncombat. It was power!--a means of flight beyond anything known!--an\r\nexplosive beside which our nitro compounds were playthings for a\r\nchild.\r\n\r\n\"Who is Paul?\" It was not only myself who asked the question through\r\nthose next long hours, but perhaps I was the only one in whose mind\r\nwas a disturbing certainty that the answer was mine if I could but\r\ngrasp it.\r\n\r\nI was remembering Paris; I was thinking of that peaceful, happy city\r\nbefore the First of May, before the world had gone mad and a raging,\r\nred beast had laid it waste and overrun it. And of Paul\r\nStravoinski--my friend \"Straki\" of college days--who had warned me. He\r\nhad known what was coming. He himself had said that he had prayed to\r\n\"them\" for delay; that in a few weeks he would do--what?... And\r\nsuddenly I knew.\r\n\r\nPaul had succeeded; his research had ended in the dissection of the\r\natom; he had unleashed the sub-atomic power of matter. Only this could\r\nexplain the wild flight through the sky, the terrific explosion at the\r\nCapitol. It was Paul--my friend, Paul Stravoinski--who was imposing\r\nhis will upon the world.\r\n\r\nI said nothing as I took off; the swiftest plane was at my command. I\r\nmight be wrong; I must not arouse false hopes; but I must find Paul.\r\nAnd the papers were black with scareheads of another threat as I left\r\nWashington:\r\n\r\n\"You have twenty-four hours to surrender. There shall be one last day\r\nof grace.\" Signed: \"Paul.\"\r\n\r\nThere was more of the wild talk of the beauties of this new\r\ndispensation--a mixture of idealistic folly and of threats of\r\ndestruction. I needed no more to prove the truth of my suspicions. No\r\none but the Paul I had known could cling so tenaciously to his dreams;\r\nno one but he could be so blind to the actual horror of the new\r\noligarchy he would impose upon the world.\r\n\r\nI flew alone; no one but myself must try to hunt him out. I paid no\r\nattention to the radio direction of the last message; he would fly far\r\nafield to send it; distance meant nothing to one who held his power. I\r\nmust look for him at his laboratory, that cluster of deserted\r\nbuildings that stood all alone by a distant railway siding; it was\r\nthere he had worked.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe met me with a pistol in his hand--a tiny gun that fired only a .22\r\ncalibre bullet.\r\n\r\n\"Put down your pop-gun,\" I told him and brushed through the open door\r\ninto the room that had been his laboratory. \"I am unarmed, and I'm\r\nhere to talk business.\r\n\r\n\"You are 'Paul'!\" I shot the sentence at him as if it were a bullet\r\nthat must strike him down.\r\n\r\nHe did not answer directly; just nodded in confirmation of some\r\nunspoken thought.\r\n\r\n\"You have found me,\" he said slowly; \"you were the only one I feared.\"\r\n\r\nThen he came out with it, and his eyes blazed with a maniacal light.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I am Paul! and this 'pop-gun' in my hand is the weapon that\r\ndestroyed your Capitol at Washington. The bullet contained less than a\r\ngrain of tritonite; that is the name I have given my explosive.\"\r\n\r\nHe aimed the little pistol toward me where I stood. \"These bullets are\r\nmore lightly charged--they are to protect myself--and the one\r\nten-thousandth of a milligram in the end of each will blow you into\r\nbits! Sit down. I will not be checked now. You will never leave this\r\nplace alive!\"\r\n\r\n\"Less than a grain of tritonite!\"--and I had seen a great building go\r\ndown to dust at its touch! I sat down in the chair where he directed,\r\nand I turned away from the fanatical glare of Paul's eyes to look\r\nabout me.\r\n\r\nThere was poverty here no longer; no makeshift apparatus greeted my\r\neyes, but the finest of laboratory equipment. Paul read my thoughts.\r\n\r\n\"They have been liberal,\" he told me; \"the Central Council has\r\nfinanced my work--though I have kept my whereabouts a secret even from\r\nthem. But they would not wait. I told you in Paris, and you did not\r\nbelieve. And now--now I have succeeded! the research is done!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe half turned to pick up a flake of platinum no larger than one's\r\nfinger-nail; it was a weight that was used on a delicate balance.\r\n\r\n\"Matter is matter no longer,\" he said; \"I have resolved it into\r\nenergy. I hold here in my hand power to destroy an army, or to drive a\r\nfleet of ships. I, Paul, will build a new world. I will give to man a\r\nsurcease from labor; I will give him rest; I will do the work of the\r\nworld. My tritonite that can destroy can also create; it shall be used\r\nfor that alone. This is the end of war. Here is wealth; here is power;\r\nI shall give it to mankind, and, under the rule of the Brotherhood, a\r\nunited world will arise and go forward to new growth, to a greater\r\ncivilization, to a building of a new heaven on earth.\"\r\n\r\nHe was pacing up and down the room. His hands were shaking; the\r\nmuscles of his face that twitched and trembled were moulded into deep\r\nlines. I sat there and realized that within that room, directly before\r\nmy eyes, was the Dictator of the World. It was true--I could not doubt\r\nit--Paul Straki of college days had made his dreams come true; his\r\nresearch was ended. And this new \"Paul\" who held in those trembling\r\nhands the destinies of mankind, at whose word kings and presidents\r\ntrembled, was utterly mad!\r\n\r\nI tried to talk and tell him of the truth we knew was true. He would\r\nhave none of it; his dreams possessed him. In the bloody flag of this\r\nnew Russia he could see only the emblem of freedom; the men who\r\nmarched beneath that banner were his brothers, unwitting in the\r\ndestruction they wrought. It was all that they knew. But they fought\r\nfor the right. They would cease fighting now, and would join him in\r\nthe work of moulding a new race. And even their leaders, who had\r\nsometimes opposed--were they not kind at heart? Had they not checked\r\nthe advance of an irresistible army to give him and his new weapon an\r\nopportunity to open the eyes of the people? Theirs was no wish to\r\ndestroy; their hearts ached for their victims who refused to listen\r\nand could be convinced only by force.\r\n\r\nAnd as he talked on there passed before my eyes the vision of an\r\naerial torpedo and a blood-red ship above, where these \"kindly\" men\r\nwho were Paul's allies turned the instrument of death upon huddled,\r\nscreaming folk--and laughed, no doubt, at such good sport.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI thought of many things. I was tensed one moment to throw myself upon\r\nthe man; and an instant later I was searching my mind for some\r\nargument, some gleam of reason, with which I could tear aside the\r\nillusions that held him. I saw him cross the room where a radio stood,\r\nand he switched on the instrument for the news-broadcast service. The\r\nshouting of an excited voice burst into the room.\r\n\r\n\"The Reds have advanced,\" said the voice. \"Their armies have crossed\r\nthe Connecticut line. They are within ten miles of the American\r\nforces. The twenty-four hours of grace promised by the tyrant 'Paul'\r\nwas a lie. The battle is already on.\"\r\n\r\nI saw the tall figure of Paul sink to its former stoop; the lameness\r\nthat had vanished in the moment of his exaltation had returned. He\r\nlimped a pace or two toward me.\r\n\r\n\"They said they would wait!\" His voice was a hoarse whisper. \"General\r\nVornikoff himself gave me his promise!\"\r\n\r\nI was on my feet, then. \"What matter?\" I shouted. \"What difference\r\ndoes it make--a few hours or a day? Your damned patriots, your dear\r\nbrothers in arms--they are destroying us this instant! And not one of\r\nour men but is worth more than the whole beastly mob!\"\r\n\r\nI was wild with the picture that came so clear and plain before my\r\neyes. I had my pistol in my hand; I was tempted to fire. It was his\r\nwhisper that stopped me.\r\n\r\n\"They have crossed Massachusetts! And Maida is there in Melford!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was no resisting his strength that tore my weapon from me. His\r\ntritonite pistol was pressed into my side, and his hand upon my collar\r\nthrew me ahead of him toward a rear room, then out into a huge shed. I\r\nhad only a quick glimpse of the airplane that was housed there. It was\r\na white cylinder, and the stern that was toward me showed a\r\nfunnel-shaped port.\r\n\r\nI was thrown by that same furious strength through a door of the ship;\r\nI saw Paul Stravoinski seat himself before some curious controls. The\r\nship that held me rose; moved slowly through an opened door; and with\r\na screech from the stern it tore off and up into the air.\r\n\r\nI have said Paul could fly; but the terrific flight of the screaming\r\nthing that held us seemed beyond the power of man to control. I was\r\nstunned with the thundering roar and the speed that held me down and\r\nback against a cabin wall.\r\n\r\nHow he found Melford, I cannot know; but he found it as a homing\r\npigeon finds its loft. He checked our speed with a sickening swiftness\r\nthat made my brain reel. There were red ships above, but they let the\r\nwhite ship pass unchallenged. There were no Red soldiers on the\r\nground--only the marks where they had passed.\r\n\r\nFrom the distance came a never-ceasing thunder of guns. The village\r\nwas quiet. It still burned, blazing brightly in places, again\r\nsmouldering sluggishly and sending into the still air smoke clouds\r\nwhose fumes were a choking horror of burned flesh. There were bodies\r\nin grotesque scattering about the streets; some of them were black and\r\ncharred.\r\n\r\nPaul Stravoinski took me with him as he dashed for a house that the\r\nflames had not touched. And I was with him as he smashed at the door\r\nand broke into the room.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was splintered furniture about. A cabinet, whose glass doors had\r\nbeen wantonly smashed, leaned crazily above its fallen books, now\r\ntorn, scuffed and muddy upon the floor. Through a shattered window in\r\nthe bed-room beyond came a puff of the acrid smoke from outside to\r\nstrangle the breath in my throat. On the floor in a shadowed corner\r\nlay the body of a woman--a young woman as her clotted tangle of golden\r\nhair gave witness. She stirred and moaned half-consciously.... And the\r\nlined face of Paul Stravoinski was a terrible thing to see as he went\r\nstumblingly across the room to gather that body into his arms.\r\n\r\nI had known Maida; I had seen their love begin in college days. I had\r\nknown a laughing girl with sunshine in her hair, a girl whose soft\r\neyes had grown so tenderly deep when they rested upon Paul--but this\r\nthat he took in his arms, while a single dry sob tore harshly at his\r\nthroat, this was never Maida!\r\n\r\nThere were red drops that struck upon his hands or fell sluggishly to\r\nthe floor; the head and face had taken the blow of a clubbed rifle or\r\na heavy boot. The eyes in that tortured face opened to rest upon\r\nPaul's, the lips were moving.\r\n\r\n\"I told them of you,\" I heard her whisper. \"I told them that you would\r\ncome--and they laughed.\" Unconsciously she tried to draw her torn clothing\r\nabout her, an instinctive reaction to some dim realization of her\r\nnakedness. She was breathing feebly. \"And now--oh, Paul!--Paul!--you--have\r\ncome--too late!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI hardly think Paul knew I was there or sensed that I followed where\r\nhe carried in his arms the bruised body that had housed the spirit of\r\nMaida. He flew homeward like a demon, but he moved as one in a dream.\r\n\r\nOnly when I went with him into the room where he had worked, did he\r\nturn on me in sudden fury.\r\n\r\n\"Out!\" he screamed. \"Get out of my sight! It is you who have done\r\nthis--your damned armies who would not do as I ordered! If you had not\r\nresisted, if you had--\"\r\n\r\nI broke in there.\r\n\r\n\"Did we do that?\" I outshouted him, and I pointed to the torn body on\r\na cot. His eyes followed my shaking hand. \"No, it was your\r\nbrothers--your dear comrades who are bringing the brotherhood of men\r\ninto the world! Well, are you proud? Are you happy and satisfied--with\r\nwhat your brothers do with women?\"\r\n\r\nIt must be a fearful thing to have one's dreams turn bitter and\r\npoisonous. Paul Stravoinski seemed about to spring upon me. He was\r\ncrouched, and the muscles of his thin neck were like wire; his face\r\nwas a ghastly thing, his eyes so staring bright, and the sensitive\r\nmouth twisting horribly. But he sprang at last not at me but toward\r\nthe door, and without a word from his tortured lips he opened it and\r\nmotioned me out.\r\n\r\nEven there I heard echoes of distant guns and the heavier, thudding\r\nsounds that must be their aerial torpedoes. My feet were leaden as I\r\nstrained every muscle to hurry toward my ship. Through my mind was\r\nrunning the threat of the Russian, Vornikoff: \"We even tell you the\r\ndate: in thirty days.\" And this was the thirtieth day--thirty days\r\nthat a state of war had existed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe battle was on; the radio had spoken truly. I saw its raging fires\r\nas I came up from our rear where the gray-like smoke clouds shivered\r\nin the unending blast. But I saw stabbing flames that struck upward\r\nfrom the ground to make a wall of sharp, fiery spears, and I knew that\r\nevery darting flame was launching a projectile from our anti-aircraft\r\nguns.\r\n\r\nThe skies were filled with the red aircraft of the enemy, but their\r\nway was an avenue of hell where thousands of shells filled the air\r\nwith their crashing explosions. There were torpedoes, the unmanned\r\nairships whose cargo was death, and they were guided to their marks\r\ndespite the inferno that raged about the red ships above.\r\n\r\nI saw meteors that fell, the red flames that enveloped them no redder\r\nthan the bodies of the ships. And, as I leaped from my plane that I\r\nhad landed back of our lines, I sensed that the enemy was withdrawing.\r\n\r\nThere was a colonel of artillery--I had known him in days of\r\npeace--and he threw his arms around me and executed a crazy dance.\r\n\"We've beaten them back, Bob!\" he shouted, and repeated it over and\r\nover in a delirium of joy.\r\n\r\nI couldn't believe it; not those cruisers that I had seen over Paris.\r\nAnother brief moment showed my fears were all too rational.\r\n\r\nA shrieking hailstorm of torpedoes preceded them; the ships were\r\ndirecting them from afar. And, while some of the big shells went wild\r\nand overshot our lines, there were plenty that found their mark.\r\n\r\nI was smashed flat by a stunning concussion. Behind me the place where\r\nColonel Hartwell had stood was a smoking crater; his battery of guns\r\nhad been blasted from the earth. Up and down the whole line, far\r\nbeyond the range of my sight, the eruption continued. The ground was a\r\nvolcano of flame, as if the earth had opened to let through the\r\ninterior fires, and the air was filled with a litter of torn bodies\r\nand sections of shattered guns.\r\n\r\nNo human force could stand up under such a bombardment. Like others\r\nabout me, I gripped tight upon something within me that was my\r\nself-control, and I marveled that I yet lived while I waited for the\r\nend.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBeyond the smoke clouds was a hillside, swarming with figures in red;\r\nsolid masses of troops that came toward us. Above was the red fleet,\r\npassing safely above our flame-blasted lines; there were bombs falling\r\nupon those batteries here and there whose fire was unsilenced. And\r\nthen, from the south, came a roar that pierced even the bedlam about\r\nme. The sun shone brightly there where the smoke-clouds had not\r\nreached, and it glinted and sparkled from the wings of a myriad of our\r\nplanes.\r\n\r\nThere was something that pulled tight at my throat; I know I tore at\r\nit with fumbling hands, as if that something were an actual band that\r\nhad clamped down and choked me, while I stared at that true line of\r\nsharp-pointed V's. The air-force of the United States had been ordered\r\nin; and they were coming, coming--to an inevitable death!\r\n\r\nI tried to tear my eyes away from that oncoming fleet, but I could not\r\nmove. I saw their first contact with the enemy; so small, they were,\r\nin contrast with the big red cruisers. They attacked in formations;\r\nthey drove down and in; and they circled and whirled before they\r\nfluttered to earth....\r\n\r\nDimly, through the stupor that numbed my brain, I heard men about me\r\nshouting with joy. I felt more than saw the fall of a monster red\r\ncraft; it struck not far away. The voices were thanking God--for what?\r\nAnother red ship fell--and another; and through all the roaring\r\ninferno a sound was tearing--a ripping, terrible scream that went on\r\nand on. And above me, when I forced my eyes upward, was a flash of\r\nwhite.\r\n\r\nIt darted like a live thing among the red ones whose guns blazed\r\nmadly--and the red ships in clotted groups fell away and over and down\r\nas the white one passed. They had been burst open where some power had\r\nblasted them, and their torn hulls showed gaping as they fell.\r\n\r\nFor a time the air was silent and empty above; the white, flashing\r\nthing had passed from sight, for the line of red ships was long. Then\r\nagain it returned, and it threw itself into the mad whirl in the south\r\nwhere the air-force of the American people was fighting its last\r\nfight.\r\n\r\nI was screaming insanely as I saw it come back. The white ship!--the\r\nblast of vapor from its funneled stern--It was Paul!--Paul\r\nStravoinski!--Paul the Dictator!--and he was fighting on our side!\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHis ship had been prepared; I had seen the machine-guns on her bow.\r\nPaul was working them from within, and every bullet was tipped with\r\nthe product of his brain--the deadly tritonite!\r\n\r\nThe white flash swung wide in a circle that took it far away. It came\r\nback above the advancing army of the Reds. It swerved once wildly,\r\nthen settled again upon its course, and the raging hell that the Reds\r\nhad turned loose upon our lines was as nothing to the destruction that\r\npoured upon the Red troops from above.\r\n\r\nA messenger of peace, that ship; I knew well why Paul had painted it\r\nwhite. And, instead of peace--!\r\n\r\nHe was flying a full mile from our lines, yet the torn earth and great\r\nboulders crashed among us even then. There were machine-guns firing\r\nceaselessly from the under side of the ship. What charges of tritonite\r\nhad the demented man placed in those shells?\r\n\r\nBelow and behind it, as it flashed across our view, was a fearful,\r\nwrithing mass where the earth itself rose up in unending, convulsive\r\nagony. A volcano of fire followed him, a fountain of earth that ripped\r\nand tore and stretched itself in a writhing, tortured line across the\r\nland as the white ship passed.\r\n\r\nNo man who saw that and lived has found words to describe the progress\r\nof that monstrous serpent; the valley itself is there for men to see.\r\nThe roar was beyond the limit of men's strained nerves. I found myself\r\ncowering upon the ground when the white ship came back; I followed it\r\nfearfully with my eyes until I saw it swoop falteringly down. Such\r\npower seemed not for men but for gods; I could not have met Paul\r\nStravoinski then but in a posture of supplication. But I leaped to my\r\nfeet and raced madly across the torn earth as I saw the white ship\r\ntouch the ground--rise--fall again--and end its flight where it\r\nploughed a furrow across a brown field....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI raised Paul Stravoinski's head in my arms where I found him in the\r\nship. An enemy shell had entered that cabin; it must have come early\r\nin the fight, but he had fought gamely on. And the eyes that looked up\r\ninto mine had none of the wild light I had seen. They were the eyes of\r\nPaul Straki, the comrade of those few long years before, and he smiled\r\nas he said: \"_Voila_, friend Bob: _c'est fini!_ And now I go for a\r\nlong, long walk. We will talk of poetry, Maida and I....\"\r\n\r\nBut his dreams were still with him. He opened his eyes to stare\r\nintently at me. \"You will see that it is not in vain?\" he questioned;\r\nthen smiled as one who is at peace, as he whispered: \"Yes, I know you\r\nwill--my friend, Bob--\"\r\n\r\nAnd his fixed gaze went through and beyond me, while he tried, in\r\nbroken sentences, to give the vision that had been his. So plain it\r\nwas to him now.\r\n\r\n\"The wild work--of a mistaken people. America will undo it.... A world\r\nat peace.... The vast commerce--of the skies--I see it--so clearly....\r\nIt will break down--all barriers.... A beautiful, happy world....\"\r\n\r\nHis lips moved feebly at the last. I could not speak; could not even\r\ncall him by name; I could only lean my head closer to hear.\r\n\r\nOne whispered word; then another: a fragment of poetry! I had heard\r\nhim quote it often. But the whispered words were not for me. Paul was\r\nspeaking to someone beside him--someone my blind, human eyes could not\r\nsee....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI am writing these words at my desk in the great Transportation\r\nBuilding in New York. It stands upon the site of the Chrysler Building\r\nthat towered here--until one of the flying torpedoes came over to hunt\r\nit out. They landed several in New York; how long ago it all seems\r\nthat the threat of utter destruction hung over the whole nation--the\r\nwhole world.\r\n\r\nAnd now from my window I see the sparkling flash of ships. The air is\r\nfilled with them; I am still unaccustomed to their speed. But a wisp\r\nof vapor from each bell-shaped stern throws them swiftly on their way;\r\nit marks the continuous explosion of that marvel of a new\r\nage--tritonite! There are tremendous terminals being built; the\r\nair-transport lines are being welded into efficient units that circle\r\nthe world; and the world is becoming so small!\r\n\r\nThe barriers are gone; all nations are working as one to use wisely\r\nthis strange new power for the work of this new world. No more\r\npoverty; no more of the want and desperate struggle that leads a whole\r\npeople into the insane horrors of war; it is a glorious world of which\r\nwe dream and which is coming slowly to be....\r\n\r\nBut I think we must dream well and work well to bring to actuality the\r\nbeautiful visions in those far-seeing eyes of the man called\r\nPaul--Dictator, one time, of the whole world.\r\n\r\n\r\nLISTENING TO ANTS\r\n\r\n\r\nTwo scientists of the University of Pittsburgh recently perfected an\r\napparatus for detecting the sounds of underground communications among\r\nants. A block of wood was placed upon the diaphragm of an ordinary\r\ntelephone transmitter, which in turn was connected through batteries\r\nand amplifiers to a pair of earphones. When the termites crawled over\r\nthe block of wood the transmitter was agitated, resulting in sound\r\nvibrations which were clearly heard by the listener at the headset.\r\n\r\nWhen the ants became excited over something or other their soldiers\r\nwere found to hammer their heads vigorously on the wood. This action\r\ncould be clearly seen and heard at the same time. The investigators\r\nfound that the ants could hear sound vibrations in the air very poorly\r\nor not at all, but were extremely sensitive to vibrations underground.\r\nFor this reason it was thought that the head hammering was a method of\r\ncommunication.\r\n\r\nBecause of this sensitivity to substratum vibrations, ants are seldom\r\nfound to infest the ties of railroads carrying heavy traffic, or\r\nbuildings containing machinery.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Earthman's Burden\r\n\r\n_By R. F. Starzl_\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _And then he jumped._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: There is foul play on Mercury--until Denny Olear of the\r\nInterplanetary Flying Police gets after his man.]\r\n\r\n\r\nDenny Olear was playing blackjack when the colonel's orderly found\r\nhim. He hastily buttoned his tunic and in a few minutes, alert and\r\nvery military, was standing at attention in the little office on the\r\nground floor of the Denver I. F. P. barracks. His swanky blue uniform\r\nfitted without a wrinkle. His little round skullcap was perched at the\r\nregulation angle.\r\n\r\n\"Olear,\" said the colonel, \"they're having a little trouble at the\r\nBlue River Station, Mercury.\"\r\n\r\n\"Trouble? Uh-huh,\" Olear said placidly.\r\n\r\nThe colonel looked him over. He saw a man past his first youth.\r\nThirty-five, possibly forty. Olear was well-knit, sandy-haired, not\r\nover five feet six inches in height. His hair was close-cropped, his\r\nfeatures phlegmatic, his eyes a light blue with thick, short,\r\nlight-colored lashes, his teeth excellent. A scar, dead white on a\r\nbrown cheekbone, was a reminder of an \"encounter\" with one of the\r\nnumerous sauriens of Venus.\r\n\r\n\"I'm sending you,\" explained the colonel, \"because you're more\r\nexperienced, and not like some of these kids, always spoiling for a\r\nfight. There's something queer about this affair. Morones, factor of\r\nthe Blue River post, reports that his assistant has disappeared.\r\nVanished. Simply gone. But only three months ago the former\r\nfactor--Morones was his assistant--disappeared. No hide nor hair of\r\nhim. Morones reported to the company, the Mercurian Trading\r\nConcession, and they called me. Something, they think, is rotten.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, sir.\"\r\n\r\n\"I guess I needn't tell you,\" the colonel went on, \"that you have to\r\nuse tact. People don't seem to appreciate the Force. What with the\r\nlousy politicians begrudging every cent we get, and a bunch of\r\nsuspicious foreign powers afraid we'll get too good--\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, I know. Tact, that's my motto. No rough stuff.\" He saluted,\r\nturned on his heel.\r\n\r\n\"Just a minute!\" The colonel had arisen. He was a fine, ascetic type\r\nof man. He held out his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Good-by, Olear. Watch yourself!\"\r\n\r\nWhen Olear had taken his matter-of-fact departure the colonel ran his\r\nfingers through his whitening hair. In the past several months he had\r\nsent five of his best men on dangerous missions--missions requiring\r\ntact, courage, and, so it seemed, very much luck. And only two of the\r\nfive had come back. In those days the Interplanetary Flying Police did\r\nnot enjoy the tremendous prestige it does now. The mere presence of a\r\nmember of the Force is enough, in these humdrum days of interplanetary\r\nlaw and order, to quell the most serious disturbance anywhere in the\r\nsolar system. But it was not always thus. This astounding prestige\r\nhad to be earned with blood and courage, in many a desperate and\r\nlonely battle; had to be snatched from the dripping jaws of death.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOlear checked over his flying ovoid, got his bearings from the port\r\nastronomer, set his coordinate navigator and shoved off. Two weeks\r\nlater he plunged into the thick, misty atmosphere on the dark side of\r\nMercury.\r\n\r\nAncient astronomers had long suspected that Mercury always presented\r\nthe same side to the sun, though they were ignorant that the little\r\nplanet had water and air. Its sunward side is a dreary, sterile, hot\r\nand hostile desert. Its dark side is warm and humid, and resembles to\r\nsome extent the better known jungles and swamps of Venus. But it has a\r\nfavored belt, some hundreds of miles wide, around its equator, where\r\nthe enormous sun stays perpetually in one spot on the horizon. Sunward\r\nis the blinding glare of the desert; on the dark side, enormous banks\r\nof lowering clouds. On the dark margin of this belt are the\r\n\"ringstorms,\" violent thunderstorms that never cease. They are the\r\nsource of the mighty rivers which irrigate the tropical habitable belt\r\nand plunge out, boiling, far into the desert.\r\n\r\nOlear's little ship passed through the ringstorms, and he did not take\r\nover the controls until he recognized the familiar mark of the trading\r\ncompany, a blue comet on the aluminum roof of one of the larger\r\nbuildings. Visibility was good that day, but despite the unusual\r\nclarity of the atmosphere there was a suggestion of the sinister about\r\nthe lifeless scene--the vast, irresistible river, the riotously\r\ncolored jungle roof. The vastness of nature dwarfed man's puny work.\r\nOne horizon flashed incessantly with livid lightning, the other was\r\none blinding blaze of the nearby sun. And almost lost below in the\r\nsavage landscape was man's symbol of possession, a few metal sheds in\r\na clear, fenced space of a few acres.\r\n\r\nOlear cautiously checked speed, skimmed over the turbid surface of the\r\ngreat river, and set her down on the ground within the compound. With\r\nhis pencil-like ray-tube in his hand he stepped out of the hatchway.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA Mercurian native came out of the residence, presently, his hands\r\ntogether in the peace sign. For the benefit of Earthlubbers whose only\r\nknowledge of Mercury is derived from the teleview screen, it should be\r\nexplained that Mercurians are _not_ human, even if they do slightly\r\nresemble us. They hatch from eggs, pass one life-phase as frog-like\r\ncreatures in their rivers, and in the adult stage turn more human in\r\nappearance. But their skin remains green and fish-belly white. There\r\nis no hair on their warty heads. Their eyes have no lids, and have a\r\npeculiar dead, staring look when they sleep. And they carry a\r\npeculiar, fishy odor with them at all times.\r\n\r\nThis Mercurian looked at Olear seemingly without interest.\r\n\r\n\"Where is Morones?\" the officer inquired.\r\n\r\n\"Morones?\" the native piped, in English. \"Inside. He busy.\"\r\n\r\n\"All right. I'm coming in.\"\r\n\r\n\"He busy.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, move over.\"\r\n\r\nThough the native was a good six inches taller than Olear he stepped\r\naside when the officer pushed him. Men--and Mercurians--had a way of\r\ndoing that when they looked into those colorless eyes. They were not\r\nas phlegmatic as the face. Morones was sitting in his office.\r\n\r\n\"Well, I'm here,\" Olear announced, helping himself to a chair.\r\n\r\n\"Yes\"--sourly. \"Who invited you?\"\r\n\r\nOlear looked at the factor levelly, appraising him. A big man, fat,\r\nbut the fat well distributed. Saturnine face, dark hair, dark and\r\nbristly beard. The kind that thrived where other men became weak and\r\nfever-ridden. Also, to judge by his present appearance, an unpleasant\r\ncompanion and a nasty enemy.\r\n\r\n\"Don't see what difference it makes to you,\" Olear answered in his own\r\ngood time; \"but the company invited me.\"\r\n\r\n\"They would!\" Morones growled. His eyes flickered to the door, and\r\nquick as a cat, Olear leaped to one side, his ray-pencil in his hand.\r\n\r\nMorones had not moved, and in the door stood the native, motionless\r\nand without expression. Morones laughed nastily.\r\n\r\n\"Kind of jumpy, eh? What is it, Nargyll?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNargyll burst into a burbling succession of native phrases, which\r\nOlear had some difficulty following.\r\n\r\n\"Nargyll wants to move your ship into one of the sheds, but the\r\nactivator key's gone.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yeah, I know,\" Olear assented casually. \"I got it. Leave the ship\r\ntill I get ready. Then I'll put it away. Get out, Nargyll.\"\r\n\r\nThe native, hesitated, then on the lift of Morones' eyebrows departed.\r\nOlear shifted a chair so that he could watch both Morones and the\r\ndoor. He reopened the conversation easily:\r\n\r\n\"Well, we understand each other. You don't want me here and I'm here.\r\nSo what are you going to do about it?\"\r\n\r\nMorones flushed. He struggled to keep his temper down.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want to know?\"\r\n\r\n\"What happened to the factor who was here before you?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. The translucene wasn't coming in like it should. Sammis\r\nwent out into the jungle for a palaver with the chiefs to find out\r\nwhy. And he didn't come back.\"\r\n\r\n\"You didn't find out where he went?\"\r\n\r\n\"I just told you,\" Morones said impatiently, \"he went out to see the\r\nnative chiefs.\"\r\n\r\n\"Alone?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course, alone. There were only two of us Earthmen here. Couldn't\r\nabandon this post to the wogglies, could we? Not that it'd make much\r\ndifference. Except for Nargyll, none'll come near.\"\r\n\r\n\"You never heard of him again?\"\r\n\r\n\"No! Dammit, no! Say, didn't they have any dumber strappers around\r\nthan you? I told you once--I tell you again--I never saw hide nor hair\r\nof him after that.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aw-right, aw-right!\" Olear regarded Morones placidly. \"And so you\r\ntook the job of factor and radioed for an assistant, and when the\r\nassistant came he disappeared.\"\r\n\r\nMorones grunted, \"He went out to get acquainted with the country and\r\ndidn't come back.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOlear masked his close scrutiny of the factor under his idle and\r\nexpressionless gaze. He was not ready to jump to the conclusion that\r\nMorones' uneasiness sprang from a sense of guilt. Guilty or not, he\r\nhad a right to feel uneasy. The man would be dense indeed if he did\r\nnot realize he was in line for suspicion, and he did not look dense.\r\nIndeed, he was obviously a shrewd character.\r\n\r\n\"Let me see your 'lucene.\"\r\n\r\nMorones rose. Despite his bulk he stepped nimbly. He had the\r\nnimbleness of a Saturnian bear, which is great, as some of the earlier\r\nexplorers learned to their dismay.\r\n\r\n\"That's the first sensible question you've asked,\" Morones snorted.\r\n\"Take a look at our 'lucene. Ha! Have a good look!\"\r\n\r\nHe led the way across the compound, waved his hand before the door of\r\na strongly built shed in a swift, definite combination, and the door\r\nopened, revealing the interior. He waved invitingly.\r\n\r\n\"You go first,\" Olear said.\r\n\r\nWith a sneer Morones stepped in. \"You're safe, boy, you're safe.\"\r\n\r\nOlear looked at the small pile on the floor in astonishment. Instead\r\nof the beautiful, semi-transparent chips of translucene, the dried sap\r\nof a Mercurian tree which is invaluable to the world as the source of\r\nan unfailing cancer cure, there were only a few dirty, dried up\r\nshavings, hardly worth shipping back to Earth for refining. The full\r\nsignificance of the affair began to dawn on the officer. The\r\ntranslucene trees grew only in this favored section of Mercury, and\r\nthe Earth company had a monopoly of the entire supply. Justly, for\r\nonly on Earth was cancer known, and it was on the increase. That\r\nsmall, almost useless pile on the floor connoted a terrible drug\r\nfamine for the human race.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMorones' smile might have been a grin of satisfaction, at Olear's\r\nquestion:\r\n\r\n\"Is that all you've bought since the last freighter was here?\"'\r\n\r\n\"It is,\" he replied. \"The last load went off six months ago, and this\r\nhere shed should be full to the eaves. There'll be hell to pay.\"\r\n\r\n\"It may not be tactful,\" Olear remarked, \"but if you've got your\r\ntakings cached away somewhere to hold up the Earth for a big ransom,\r\nyou'd better come across right now. You can't get by with it, fellow.\r\nYou should have close to six million dollars' worth of it, and you\r\ncan't get away. You just can't.\"\r\n\r\nMorones controlled his anger with an effort.\r\n\r\n\"Like any dumb strapper, you've got your mind made up, ain't you?\r\nWell, go ahead. Get something on me. Here I was almost set to give you\r\na lead that might get you somewhere. And you come shooting\r\noff--trying to make out I stole the 'lucene and killed those two\r\nfellows, eh? Go ahead! Get something on me! But not on Company\r\ngrounds. You're leaving now!\"\r\n\r\nWith that he made a lunge at the officer, quite beside himself with\r\nrage. Olear could have burnt him down, but he was far too experienced\r\nfor such an amateurish trick. Instead he ducked to evade Morones'\r\nblow. But the big man was as agile as a panther. In mid-air, so it\r\nseemed, he changed his direction of attack. The big fist swept\r\ndownward, striking Olear's head a glancing blow.\r\n\r\nBut the men of the Force have always been fighters, whatever their\r\nshortcomings as diplomats. Olear countered with a strong right to the\r\nbody, thudding solidly, for Morones' softness did not go far below the\r\nsurface. The factor whirled instantly, but not quite fast enough to\r\nbar the door. Olear was out and inside his ship in a few seconds,\r\nslamming the hatch.\r\n\r\n\"Tact!\" he grinned to himself, inserting the activator key. \"Tact is\r\nwhat a fella needs.\" The little space flier shot aloft, until the tiny\r\nfigure of the factor stopped shaking its fist and entered the\r\nresidence. The post had a flier of its own, of course, but Morones was\r\ntoo wise to use it in pursuit.\r\n\r\nOlear considered what was best to do. Of course he could have placed\r\nMorones under arrest; could still do it; but that would not solve the\r\nmystery of the two deaths and the missing 'lucene. If the choleric\r\nfactor was really guilty of the crimes, it would be better to let him\r\ngo his way in the hope that he would betray himself. Olear regretted\r\nthat he had not kept his tongue under closer curb. But there was no\r\nuse regretting. Perhaps, after all, he ought to turn back to pump\r\nMorones for some helpful information.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHis mind made up, he descended again until he was hovering a few feet\r\nfrom the ground.\r\n\r\n\"Morones!\" he called. \"Morones!\" He held the hatch open.\r\n\r\nMorones came to the door of the residence. He had a tube in his hand,\r\na long-range weapon.\r\n\r\n\"Morones,\" Olear declared pompously. \"I place you under arrest!\"\r\n\r\nThe effect was instantaneous. Morones lifted the tube, and a\r\nglimmering, iridescent beam sprang out. The ship was up and away in a\r\nsecond, lurching and shivering uncomfortably every time the beam\r\nstruck it in its upward flight. A good few seconds continued\r\nimpingement....\r\n\r\nBut a miss is as good as a light-year. Miles high, Olear looked into\r\nhis telens. Morones had laid aside his tube and was working with an\r\ninstrument like a twin transit. Plotting the ship's course, naturally.\r\nOlear set his course for the Earth, and kept on it for a good\r\ntwenty-four hours. Morones, if he was still watching him, would think\r\nhe'd gone back for reinforcements. Such an assumption would be\r\nincredible now, but that was before the I. F. P. had achieved its\r\npresent tremendous reputation.\r\n\r\nBeyond observation range, Olear curved back toward Mercury again, and\r\nwas almost inside its atmosphere when he made a discovery that caused\r\nhim to lose for a moment his natural indifference, and to clamp his\r\njaws in anger. The current oxygen tank became empty, and when he\r\nremoved it from the rack and put in a new one he found someone had let\r\nout all of this essential gas. The valve of every one of the spare\r\ntanks had been opened. Had Olear actually continued on his way to\r\nEarth he would have perished miserably of suffocation long before he\r\ncould have returned to the Mercurian atmosphere. The officer whistled\r\ntunelessly through his teeth as he considered this fact.\r\n\r\nThe visibility was by this time normal; that is, so poor it would have\r\nbeen possible to land very close to the trading station. Olear was\r\ntaking no chances, however, and came down a good three Earth miles\r\naway. The egg-shaped hull sank through the glossy, brilliant treetops,\r\nthrough twisted vines, and was buried in the dank gloom of the jungle.\r\nHere it might remain hidden for a hundred years.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe twilight of the jungle was almost darkness. Landmarks were not.\r\nBut Olear made a few small, inconspicuous marks on trees with his\r\nknife until he came to an outcropping rock. He had noticed the\r\nscarlike white of it slashing through the jungle from the air, and\r\nused it as a guide to direct his stealthy return to the trading post.\r\nHis belt chronometer told him it would be about time for Morones to\r\nget up from his \"night's\" sleep. A little discreet observation might\r\ntell much.\r\n\r\nLong before he reached the compound, Olear heard the rushing of the\r\ngreat Blue River in its headlong plunge to the corrosive heat of the\r\ndesert. And then, through the mists, he glimpsed the white metal walls\r\nof the Company sheds.\r\n\r\nHe climbed a tree and for a long time watched patiently, lying prone on\r\na limb. Blood-sucking insects tortured him, and flat tree-lice,\r\nresembling discs with legs, crawled over him inquisitively. Olear\r\ntolerated them with stoic indifference until at last his patience was\r\nrewarded. Morones was coming out of the compound. He was alone and\r\nobviously did not suspect that he was being watched, for he stepped\r\nout briskly. Once in the jungle he walked even faster, watching out\r\nwarily for the panther-like carnivora that were the most dangerous to\r\nman on Mercury.\r\n\r\nOlear shinned to the ground and followed cautiously. Morones had his\r\nray-tube with him, as any traveler in these jungles did. Olear could\r\nand did draw fast, but a dead trader would be valueless to him in his\r\ninvestigation, so he stalked him with every faculty strained to\r\nmaintain complete silence. Often, in occasional clearings where the\r\nbrown darkness grew less, he had to grovel on the slimy ground,\r\npicking up large bacteria that could be seen with the naked eye, and\r\nwhich left tiny, festering red marks on the skin. Mercury has no\r\nsnakes.\r\n\r\nThe trader seemed to be heading for higher ground, for the path led\r\never upward, though not far from the tossing waters of the river. And\r\nthen, suddenly, he disappeared.\r\n\r\nOlear did not immediately hurry after him. A canny fugitive, catching\r\nsight of his pursuer, might suddenly drop to the ground and squirm to\r\nthe side of the trail, there to wait and catch his pursuer as he\r\npassed. So Olear sidled into the all but impenetrable underbrush and\r\nslowly, with infinite caution, wormed his way along.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPresently he came to the little rise of ground where Morones had\r\ndisappeared, but a painstaking search did not reveal the factor. There\r\nwere, however, a number of other trails that joined the very faint\r\ntrail he had been following, and now there was a well-defined track\r\nwhich continued to lead upward. With a grimace of disgust Olear again\r\nplunged into the odorous underbrush and traveled parallel to the\r\ntrail. It was well he did so, for several Mercurians passed swiftly,\r\nintent, so it seemed, in answering a shrill call that at times came\r\nfaintly to the ear. They carried slender spears.\r\n\r\nSeveral more Mercurians passed. The growth was thinning out, and Olear\r\ndid not dare to proceed further. However, from his hiding place he\r\ncould discern a number of irregular cave openings, apparently leading\r\ndownward. They were apparently the entrances to one of the native\r\ncavern colonies, or possibly of a meeting place. No Earthman had ever\r\nentered one, but it was thought they had underground openings into the\r\nriver.\r\n\r\nAs the cave openings were obviously natural, Olear conjectured that\r\nthere might be others that were not used. After an anxious search he\r\nfound one, narrow and irregular, well hidden under the broad, glossy\r\nleaves of some uncatalogued vegetation. As it showed no evidence of\r\nuse, Olear unhesitatingly slid down into it. It was very narrow and\r\nirregular, so that often he was barely able to squeeze through. The\r\nroots of trees choked the passage for a dozen feet or so, requiring\r\nthe vigorous use of a knife. Bathed in sweat, his uniform a filthy\r\nmass of rags, Olear at last saw light.\r\n\r\nThe passage ended abruptly near the roof of a large natural cavern.\r\nLights glistened on stalactites which cut off Olear's larger view, and\r\nvoices came from below. By craning his neck the officer could look\r\nbetween the pendent icicles of rock and see a fire burning on a huge\r\noblong block of stone. Figures were sitting on the floor around this\r\nblock--hundreds of Mercurians. The leaping flames made their white and\r\ngreen faces and bodies look frog-like and less human than usual.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut the figure that dominated the whole assemblage, both by its own\r\nhugeness and the magnetic power that flowed from it, was not of\r\nMercury but of Pluto. For the benefit of those who have never seen a\r\nstuffed Plutonian in our museums--and they are very rare--let me refer\r\nyou to the pious books still to be found in ancient library\r\ncollections. The ancients personified their fears and hates in a being\r\nthey called the Devil. The resemblance between the Devil of their\r\nimagination and a Plutonian is really astounding. Horns, hoofs,\r\ntail--almost to the smallest detail, the resemblance is there.\r\n\r\nPhilosophers have written books on the \"coincidence\" in appearance of\r\nthe ancient Devil and the modern decadent Plutonians. The Plutonians\r\nwere once numerous and far advanced in science, and no doubt they\r\ncalled on the Earth many times, in prehistoric days, and the so-called\r\nDevil was a true picture of those vicious invaders, who are somewhat\r\nless human than usually portrayed. What was once classed as\r\nsuperstition was therefore a true racial memory. Long before our\r\nancestors came out of their caves to build houses, the Plutonians had\r\nmastered interplanetary travel--only to forget the secret until human\r\ningenuity should reveal it once more.\r\n\r\nThe modern Plutonian in that dank cave was over ten feet tall, and it\r\nis easy to see why he dominated the assemblage. His black visage was\r\nset in an evil smile; his ebony body glistened in the firelight. He\r\nheld a three-pronged spear in one hand, and sat on a pile of rocks, a\r\nsort of rough throne, so that he towered magnificently above all\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nHe spoke the Mercurian language, although the liquid intonations came\r\nharshly from his sneering lips.\r\n\r\n\"Are ye assembled, frogfolk, that ye may hear the decision of your\r\nThinking Ones?\" he asked.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA respectful peeping chorus signified assent. But in that there was a\r\nhint of unrest; even of fear.\r\n\r\n\"Speak, ye Thinking One, your commands!\"\r\n\r\n\"Hear me first!\" An old Mercurian, unusually tall, faded and dry\r\nlooking, his thick hide wrinkled like crushed leather, rose slowly to\r\nhis feet and stepped before the oblong stone. His back was to the\r\nPlutonian, his face to the crescent of chiefs.\r\n\r\n\"The Old Wise One!\" A twittering murmur went around the assemblage.\r\n\"Hear the Old Wise One!\"\r\n\r\n\"My people, I like this not!\" began the ancient. \"The Lords of the\r\nGreen Star[1] have dealt with us fairly. Each phase[2] they have\r\nbrought us the things we wanted\"--he touched his spear and a few gaudy\r\nornaments on his otherwise naked body--\"in exchange for the worthless\r\nwhite sap of our trees. If we longer offend the Lords of the Green\r\nStar--\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 1: In their various languages, almost all solar races call\r\nEarth \"The Green Star.\" Although conditions on Mercury are\r\nunfavorable, Earth can be seen from the dark star, on mountain tops,\r\nduring occasional dispersals of the cloud masses.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 2: The Mercurians had no conception of time before the\r\nEarthmen came. A \"phase\" is the time between calls of the freight\r\nships, and is therefore variable; but in those days it was about six\r\nor seven months.]\r\n\r\nA raucous laugh interrupted the Mercurian's feeble voice, and it\r\nechoed eerily from the walls of the chamber.\r\n\r\n\"Valueless ye call the white sap?\" sneered the Plutonian. \"Hear me.\r\nThat sap you call valueless is dearer than life itself to the Lords of\r\nthe Green Star. For they are afflicted in great numbers with a\r\nstinking death they call cancer. It destroys their vitals, and\r\nnothing--nothing in this broad universe can help them save this white\r\nsap ye give them. In your hands ye have the power to bring the proud\r\nLords of the Green Star to their knees. They would fill this chamber\r\nmany times with their most priceless treasures for the sap ye give\r\nthem so freely. Withhold the sap, and your Thinking Ones may go to the\r\nGreen Star itself to rule over its Lords. They are desperate. Their\r\nemissaries may even now be on the way to beg your pleasure. Speak,\r\nThinking Ones! Would ye not rule the Green Star?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut the chiefs failed to become enthused. One of them rose and\r\naddressed the Plutonian:\r\n\r\n\"O Lord of the Outer Orbit! For near one full phase have ye dwelt\r\namong us. And well should ye know we have no desire for conquest. We\r\nfear to go to the Green Star to rule.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then let me rule for ye!\" exclaimed the Plutonian instantly. \"My\r\nbrothers will abide with ye as your guests--shall see that ye receive\r\na fair reward for the white sap; and I will convey your commands to\r\nthe Lords of the Green Star.\"\r\n\r\nThe Old Wise One raised his withered hands, so that the uncertain\r\ntwittering of voices which followed the Plutonian's suggestion\r\nsubsided.\r\n\r\n\"My children,\" piped the feeble old voice, \"the Black Lord has spoken\r\ncunning words, but they are false. It is plain to see that he desires\r\nto rule the Green Star, and our welfare does not concern him.\"\r\n\r\n\"If so it be that the white sap is of great value to the Lords of the\r\nGreen Star, it is still of no value to us; and if the gifts they bring\r\nto us are of no value to them, they are dear to us.\"\r\n\r\nThe Plutonian sneered.\r\n\r\n\"Dearer than the Paste of Strange Dreams?\"\r\n\r\nA startled hush fell among the assembled Mercurians. They looked\r\nguiltily at one another, avoiding the eyes of the Old Wise One.\r\n\r\n\"What is this?\" shrilled he, turning furiously to the Plutonian. \"Have\r\nye brought the paste of evil to our abode, knowing well the strict\r\nproscription of our tribe? Fool! Your death is upon ye!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut the Plutonian only grinned and spread his glistening, black hands\r\nin a careless gesture. High overhead, peering through the\r\nstalactites, Olear instantly understood the Plutonian's strange power,\r\nthe Paste of Strange Dreams, a fearsome narcotic of that far-swinging\r\ndark planet. More insidious and devastating than any drug ever\r\nproduced on Earth, it had wrought frightful havoc among many solar\r\nraces. The Earthmen had opened the lanes, broken the age-old barriers\r\nof distance, so that the harpies of evil could traffic their poison\r\nfrom planet to planet. So the Paste of Strange Dreams was added to the\r\nEarthman's burden.\r\n\r\n\"Seize him--the Evil One!\" shrieked the old chief, but the Mercurians\r\nsat sullen and silent, and the Plutonian sneered.\r\n\r\nFinally one of the chiefs arose and with an effort faced the Old Wise\r\nOne and said:\r\n\r\n\"The Strange Dreams are dearer to us than all else. Do as he says.\"\r\n\r\nThe piping voices rose in eager acclamation, but the Old Wise One held\r\nup his claws, waiting until silence returned.\r\n\r\n\"Wait! Wait! Before ye commit this folly, hear the Green Star man.\r\nMany times has he demanded audience. Let him come in.\"\r\n\r\n\"It is not permitted,\" demurred one of the chiefs.\r\n\r\n\"Ye permitted this being of evil to enter; let him enter also.\"\r\n\r\n\"He is in the outer chambers now,\" one of the guards spoke. \"His face\r\nis like the center of a ringstorm.\"\r\n\r\n\"Let him enter!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMorones strode into the room angrily. Blinded by the fire after the\r\ndarkness of the antechambers, he did not at first see the Plutonian.\r\nHe strode up to the ancient chief and glared at him.\r\n\r\n\"Does the Old Wise One learn wisdom at last?\" he rasped. The ancient\r\nshrank away from him, as did the nearer of the lesser chiefs.\r\n\r\n\"The Old Wise One thinks less of his wisdom,\" he replied wearily.\r\n\"Behold!\" He pointed to the enthroned Plutonian.\r\n\r\nMorones started. His hand flashed to his side, and came away empty.\r\nDeft fingers had extracted his ray-tube. But he was a man of courage.\r\nNever could it be said to his shame that an Earthman cringed in the\r\nsight of lesser races.\r\n\r\n\"So it's you, my sooty friend!\" he snarled in English. The Plutonian,\r\naccomplished linguist, replied:\r\n\r\n\"As you see. You don't look very happy, Mr. Morones.\"\r\n\r\nMorones regarded him impassively, his eyes frosty.\r\n\r\n\"That explains everything,\" he said at last with cold deliberation.\r\n\"First Sammis, then Boyd. Going to finish me next, I suppose?\"\r\n\r\nThe Plutonian twisted the end of an eyebrow and smiled.\r\n\r\n\"Interested in them?\"\r\n\r\n\"What'd you do with the bodies?\"\r\n\r\nThe Plutonian jerked his thumb carelessly. \"The river you call the\r\nBlue is swift and deep. But before you follow them there is certain\r\ninformation I wish to get from you. Where is the soldier who came to\r\nvisit you?\"\r\n\r\nA crafty light came into Morones' face.\r\n\r\n\"He is not far from here, waiting for me.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOlear, in his cramped hiding place, could not help feeling a warm glow\r\nof admiration for Morones' nerve, because Morones thought him well on\r\nhis way to Earth.\r\n\r\n\"Nargyll, what did your master do with the visitor?\"\r\n\r\n\"Drove him back to the Green Star,\" Nargyll said promptly.\r\n\r\n\"And the oxygen tanks. Did you empty them?\"\r\n\r\n\"I let them hiss.\" Nargyll's grin was sharkish.\r\n\r\n\"News to you, eh, Morones? Your officer's corpse has probably dropped\r\ninto the sun by this time. Tell me, why did you drive him off?\"\r\n\r\nMorones sagged perceptibly. To gain a little time he said truthfully:\r\n\r\n\"I knew I should be blamed and ruined for life. I didn't know you were\r\nhere, damn you! I hoped to get this mess with the natives straightened\r\nup before he'd come back with reinforcements.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Well, you owe some months of life already. Your presence here\r\nhas been more or less embarrassing, but I had to let you live or I'd\r\nhave had the whole I. F. P. here to investigate. Now that you've\r\nfailed in keeping them from getting interested you may do me one more\r\nservice.\" The black giant grinned.\r\n\r\n\"I've often wondered at the Earthman's prestige all over the solar\r\nsystem. Even to-night, soft and helpless as you are, these natives\r\nfear you. You will, therefore, be an object lesson in the helplessness\r\nof Earthmen.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMorones was pale but courageous. With contempt in every line of him he\r\nwatched some of the less frightened chiefs, at the command of the\r\nPlutonian, push aside some of the blazing blocks of fungus on the\r\nstone, to make room for his body. At last he raised his hand.\r\n\r\n\"Frogfolk!\" he cried, \"if ye do this thing, the Lords of the Green\r\nStar will come. They will come with fires hotter than the sun; they\r\nwill blast your rivers with a power greater than the thunder of the\r\nringstorms; they will fill your caves with a purple smoke that turns\r\nyour bones to water--\"\r\n\r\nShrill cries of fear almost drowned out his words. All the Mercurians\r\nhad seen evidences of the dreadful power of the Earthmen. They began\r\nmilling around, then stood rooted by the roar of the Plutonian's\r\nvoice.\r\n\r\n\"Lies! Lies!\" he bellowed. \"See, they are weak as egglets!\" He stepped\r\ndown, picked Morones up by one shoulder, and held him, dangling, high\r\nover the heads of all. Morones clawed and tore at the brawny arm. He\r\nmade a ludicrous picture. Soon the simple natives made a sniffling\r\nsound of mirth, and the Plutonian, satisfied at last, set him down\r\nagain.\r\n\r\n\"He tells truth!\" The Old Wise One had climbed to the top of the stone\r\nblock. \"The Lords of the Green Star have their power not in their\r\nbodies, but it is great. It is greater far than the frogfolk. It is\r\ngreater than the Lords of the Outer Orbit. They will come even as the\r\nsurly one has said, and great shall be our sorrow. It is not yet too\r\nlate. Release him, and deliver to him the white sap. Seize this evil\r\none--\"\r\n\r\nThe feeble, fickle minds were being swayed again. In a gust of\r\nimpatience, the Plutonian stepped down, seized the aged chief's skinny\r\nbody in his great black hands, and snapped him in two. There was a\r\ntearing of tough cords and tissue, and the two halves fell into the\r\nfire.\r\n\r\nFor an instant the Mercurians were stunned. Then some of them vented\r\nhissing sounds of rage, while others prostrated themselves on the\r\nfloor. The black giant watched them narrowly for a moment, then turned\r\nhis attention to Morones. He seized him by the arm and drew him slowly\r\nand irresistibly to him.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe murder of the Old Wise One had been done so quickly that Olear was\r\nunable to prevent it. Had he been able to use his ray weapon he could\r\nhave burned the Plutonian down, but it had been bent at one of the\r\nnarrow turns of the crevice he had come down. The need for extreme\r\nlightness in weapons was rather overdone in those early times, and a\r\nlittle rough handling made them useless.\r\n\r\nSo now Olear, weaponless except for the service knife at his belt,\r\nbegan the hazardous undertaking of climbing among the stalactites to a\r\nposition approximately above the Plutonian's head. The job required\r\njudgment. Some of the stone masses were insecurely anchored and would\r\ncrash down at the lightest touch. Some were spaced so closely together\r\nthat he could not get between them. Others were so far apart that it\r\nwas difficult to get from one to another.\r\n\r\nYet he made it somehow, and unnoticed, for all eyes were turned on the\r\ntense drama being enacted below. From almost directly overhead he saw\r\nMorones being drawn upward.\r\n\r\n\"You saw,\" the Plutonian was saying triumphantly in Mercurian, \"--you\r\nsaw me unmake your Old Fool. And now you will see that a Lord of the\r\nGreen Star is even softer, even weaker--\"\r\n\r\nMorones, in that pitiless grasp, turned his face to the hateful\r\ngrinning visage above him. In his last extremity he was still angry.\r\n\r\n\"You devil!\" Morones shouted. \"You may murder me, but they'll get you!\r\nThey'll get you!\"\r\n\r\n\"Who'll get me?\" the Plutonian purred silkily, deferring the pleasure\r\nof the kill for another moment. Morones was having trouble with his\r\nbreathing. His red face lolled from side to side, his eyes rolled in\r\nagony. Suddenly he saw Olear. Unbelieving, he relaxed.\r\n\r\n\"I'm seein' things!\" he breathed.\r\n\r\n\"Who'll get me?\" persisted the Plutonian, applying a little more\r\npressure.\r\n\r\n\"The I. F. P.!\" Morones gasped.\r\n\r\n\"Well, you little son-of-a-gun!\" Olear thought, and then he jumped.\r\n\r\nHe landed a-straddle the neck of the Plutonian, which was almost like\r\nforking a horse. One brawny arm seized a horn. The other, with a\r\nlightning-swift dart, brought the point of the long service-knife to\r\nthe pulsing black throat.\r\n\r\n\"Put him down!\" Olear spoke into the great pointed ear. \"Easy!\"\r\n\r\nBack on his feet, Morones began bellowing at the Mercurians. Utterly\r\ndemoralized, they fled pell-mell. Morones came back. He said:\r\n\r\n\"Nothing to tie him up with.\"\r\n\r\n\"That's all right,\" Olear replied, studiously keeping the knife point\r\nat exactly the right place, \"I'll ride him in. Get going, you, and be\r\ntactful when you go through the door, or this sticker of mine might\r\nslip!\" With extreme care the Plutonian did exactly as Olear ordered\r\nhim to.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was necessary to radio for one of the larger patrol ships to take\r\nOlear's enormous prisoner back to Earth for his trial. The officer\r\ntestified, of course, and the Plutonian was duly sentenced to death\r\nfor the murder of the old Mercurian. Execution by dehydration was\r\ndecreed, so that the body would be uninjured for scientific study; and\r\nto-day it is considered one of the finest specimens extant.\r\n\r\nIn his testimony, however, Olear so minimized his own connection with\r\nthe case that he received no public recognition. It was not until some\r\nmonths afterward, when Morones, on leave, rode back with a shipload of\r\ntranslucene, that the whole story came out, emphatically and\r\nprofanely. Olear finally consented to speak a few words for the\r\nTelephoto News Co. As he stepped off the little platform deferential\r\nhands tried to push him back.\r\n\r\n\"You haven't told them who you are,\" protested the announcer. \"Give\r\nyour name and rank.\"\r\n\r\n\"Aw, they don't have to know that!\" Olear rejoined, keeping on going.\r\n\"They know it's one of the Force. That's all they have to know.\r\nBesides there's a blackjack game going on and I'm losing money every\r\nminute I'm out of it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Exile of Time\r\n\r\nPART THREE OF A FOUR-PART NOVEL\r\n\r\n_By Ray Cummings_\r\n\r\n\r\nWHAT HAS GONE BEFORE\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _\"Look!\" exclaimed Larry._]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: Larry and George from 1935, Mary from 1777--all are caught\r\nup in the treacherous Tugh's revolt of the Robots, in the Time-world\r\nof 2930.]\r\n\r\n\r\nThere came a girl's scream, and muffled, frantic words.\r\n\r\n\"Let me out! Let me out!\"\r\n\r\nThen we saw her white face at the basement window. This, which was the\r\nstart of the extraordinary incidents, occurred on the night of June\r\n8-9, 1935.\r\n\r\nMy name is George Rankin, and with my friend, Larry Gregory, we\r\nrescued the girl who was imprisoned in the deserted house on Patton\r\nPlace, New York City. We thought at first that she was demented--this\r\nstrangely beautiful girl in long white satin dress, white powdered wig\r\nand a black beauty patch on her check. She said she had come from the\r\nyear 1777, that her father was Major Atwood, of General Washington's\r\nstaff! Her name was Mistress Mary Atwood.\r\n\r\nIt was a strange story she had to tell us. A cage of shining metal\r\nbars had materialized in her garden, and a mechanical man had come\r\nfrom it--a Robot ten feet tall. It had captured her; brought her to\r\n1935; left her, and vanished saying it would return.\r\n\r\nWe went back to that house on Patton Place. The cage did return, and\r\nLarry and I fought the strange monster. We were worsted, and the Robot\r\nseized Mary and me and whirled us back into Time in its room-like cage\r\nof shining bars. Larry recovered his senses, rushed into Patton\r\nPlace, and there encountered another, smaller, Time-traveling cage,\r\nand was himself taken off in it.\r\n\r\nBut the occupants of Larry's smaller cage were friendly. They were a\r\nman and a girl of 2930 A.D.! The girl was the Princess Tina, and the\r\nman, Harl, a young scientist of that age. With an older scientist--a\r\ncripple named Tugh--Harl had invented the Time-vehicles.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe had heard of Tugh before. Mary Atwood had known him in the year\r\n1777. He had made love to her, and when repulsed had threatened\r\nvengeance against her father. And in 1932, a cripple named Tugh had\r\ngotten into trouble with the police and had vowed some strange weird\r\nvengeance against the city officials and the city itself. More than\r\nthat, the very house on Patton Place from which we had rescued Mary\r\nAtwood, was owned by this man named Tugh, who was wanted by the police\r\nbut could not be found!\r\n\r\nTugh's vengeance was presently demonstrated, for in June, 1935, a\r\nhorde of Robots appeared. With flashing swords and red and violet\r\nlight beams the mechanical men spread about the city massacring the\r\npeople; they brought midsummer snow with their frigid red rays; and\r\nthen, in a moment, torrid heat and boiling rain. Three days and nights\r\nof terror ensued; then the Robots silently withdrew into the house on\r\nPatton Place and vanished. The New York City of 1935 lay wrecked; the\r\nvengeance of Tugh against it was complete.\r\n\r\nLarry, going back in Time now, was told by Harl and Princess Tina that\r\na Robot named Migul--a mechanism almost human from the Time-world of\r\n2930--had stolen the larger cage and was running amuck through Time.\r\nThe strange world of 2930 was described to Larry--a world in which\r\nnearly-human mechanisms did all the work. These Robots, diabolically\r\ndeveloped, were upon the verge of revolt. The world of machinery was\r\nready to assail its human masters!\r\n\r\nMigul was an insubordinate Robot, and Harl and Tina were chasing it.\r\nThey whirled Larry back into Time, and they saw the larger cage stop\r\nat a night in the year 1777--the same night from which Mary Atwood had\r\nbeen stolen. They stopped there. Harl remained in the little cage to\r\nguard it, while Tina and Larry went outside.\r\n\r\nIt was night, and the house of Major Atwood was nearby. British\r\nredcoats had come to capture the colonial officer; but all they found\r\nwas his murdered body lying in the garden. Migul the Robot had chained\r\nMary and me to the door of his cage; had briefly stopped in the garden\r\nand killed the major, and then had departed with us.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWe now went back to the Beginning of Time, for the other cage was\r\nagain chasing us. Reaching the Beginning, we swept forward, and the\r\nwhole vast panorama of the events of Time passed in review before us.\r\nSuddenly we found that Tugh himself was hiding in our cage! We had not\r\nknown it, nor had Migul, our Robot captor. Tugh was hiding here, not\r\ntrusting Migul to carry out his orders!\r\n\r\nWe realized now that all these events were part of the wild vengeance\r\nof this hideously repulsive cripple. Migul was a mere machine carrying\r\nout Tugh's orders. Tugh, in 2930, was masquerading as a friend of the\r\nGovernment; but in reality it was he who was fomenting the revolt of\r\nthe Robots.\r\n\r\nTugh now took command of our cage. The smaller cage had only Harl in\r\nit now, for Larry and Tina were marooned in 1777. Harl was chasing us.\r\nTugh stopped us in the year 762 A.D. We found that the space around\r\nus now was a forest recently burned. Five hundred feet from us was the\r\nspace which held Harl's cage.\r\n\r\nPresently it materialized! Mary and I were helpless. We stood watching\r\nTugh, as he crouched on the floor of our cage near its opened doorway.\r\nA ray cylinder was in his hand, with a wire running to a battery in\r\nthe cage corner. He had forced Mary and me to stand at the window\r\nwhere Harl would see us and be lured to approach.\r\n\r\nFrom Harl's cage, five hundred feet across the blackened forest glade\r\nof that day of 762, Harl came cautiously forward. Abruptly Tugh fired.\r\nHis cylinder shot a horizontal beam of intense actinic light. It\r\nstruck Harl full, and he fell.\r\n\r\nSwiftly his body decomposed; and soon in the sunlight of the glade lay\r\na sagging heap of black and white garments enveloping the skeleton of\r\nwhat a moment before had been a man!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\nA Very Human Princess\r\n\r\nThat night in 1777 near the home of the murdered Major Atwood brought\r\nto Larry the most strangely helpless feeling he had ever experienced.\r\nHe crouched with Tina beneath a tree in a corner of the field, gazing\r\nwith horror at the little moonlit space by the fence where their\r\nTime-traveling vehicle should have been but now was gone.\r\n\r\nMarooned in 1777! Larry had not realized how desolately remote this\r\nRevolutionary New York was from the great future city in which he had\r\nlived. The same space; but what a gulf between him and 1935! What a\r\nbarrier of Time, impassable without the shining cage!\r\n\r\nThey crouched, whispering. \"But why would he have gone, Tina?\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't know. Harl is very careful; so something or someone must have\r\npassed along here, and he left, rather than cause a disturbance. He\r\nwill return, of course.\"\r\n\r\n\"I hope so,\" whispered Larry fervently. \"We are marooned here, Tina!\r\nHeavens, it would be the end of us!\"\r\n\r\n\"We must wait. He will return.\"\r\n\r\nThey huddled in the shadow of the tree. Behind them there was a\r\ncontinued commotion at the Atwood home, and presently the mounted\r\nBritish officers came thudding past on the road, riding for\r\nheadquarters at the Bowling Green to report the strange Atwood murder.\r\n\r\nThe night wore on. Would Harl return? If not to-night, then probably\r\nto-morrow, or to-morrow night. In spite of his endeavor to stop\r\ncorrectly, he could so easily miss this night, these particular hours.\r\n\r\nHarl had met his death, as I have described. We never knew exactly\r\nwhat he did, of course, after leaving that night of 1777. It seems\r\nprobable, however, that some passer-by startled him into flashing away\r\ninto Time. Then he must have seen with his instrument evidence of the\r\nother cage passing, and impulsively followed it--to his death in the\r\nburned forest of the year 762.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLarry and Tina waited. The dawn presently began paling the stars; and\r\nstill Harl did not come. The little space by the fence corner was\r\nempty.\r\n\r\n\"It will soon be daylight,\" Larry whispered. \"We can't stay here:\r\nwe'll be discovered.\"\r\n\r\nThey were anachronisms in this world; misfits; futuristic beings who\r\ndared not show themselves.\r\n\r\nLarry touched his companion--the slight little creature who was a\r\nPrincess in her far-distant future age. But to Larry now she was just\r\na girl.\r\n\r\n\"Frightened, Tina?\"\r\n\r\n\"A little.\"\r\n\r\nHe laughed softly. \"It would be fearful to be marooned here\r\npermanently, wouldn't it? You don't think Harl would desert us?\r\nPurposely, I mean?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, of course not.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we'll expect him to-morrow night. He wouldn't stop in the\r\ndaylight, I guess.\"\r\n\r\n\"I don't think so. He would reason that I would not expect him.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then we must find shelter, and food, and be here to-morrow night. It\r\nseems long to us, Tina, but in the cage it's just an instant--just a\r\ntrifle different setting of the controls.\"\r\n\r\nShe smiled her pale, stern smile. \"You have learned quickly, Larry.\r\nThat is true.\"\r\n\r\nA sudden emotion swept him. His hand found hers; and her fingers\r\nanswered the pressure of his own. Here in this remote Time-world they\r\nfelt abruptly drawn together.\r\n\r\nHe murmured, \"Tina, you are--\" But he never finished.\r\n\r\nThe cage was coming! They stood tense, watching the fence corner\r\nwhere, in the flat dawn light, the familiar misty shadow was\r\ngathering. Harl was returning to them.\r\n\r\nThe cage flashed silently into being. They stood peering, ready to run\r\nto it. The door slid aside.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nBut it was not Harl who came out. It was Tugh, the cripple. He stood\r\nin the doorway, a thick-set, barrel-chested figure of a man in a wide\r\nleather jacket, a broad black belt and short flaring leather\r\npantaloons.\r\n\r\n\"Tugh!\" exclaimed Tina.\r\n\r\nThe cripple advanced. \"Princess, is it you?\" He was very wary. His\r\ngaze shot at Larry and back to Tina. \"And who is this?\"\r\n\r\nA hideously repulsive fellow, Larry thought this Tugh. He saw his\r\nshriveled, bent legs, crooked hips, and wide thick shoulders set\r\naskew--a goblin, in a leather jerkin. His head was overlarge, with a\r\nbulging white forehead and a mane of scraggly black hair shot with\r\ngrey. But Larry could not miss the intellectuality marking his\r\nheavy-jowled face; the keenness of his dark-eyed gaze.\r\n\r\nThese were instant impressions. Tina had drawn Larry forward. \"Where\r\nis Harl?\" she demanded imperiously. \"How have you come to have the\r\ncage, Tugh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Princess, I have much to tell,\" he answered, and his gaze roved the\r\nfield. \"But it is dangerous here; I am glad I have found you. Harl\r\nsent me to this night, but I struck it late. Come, Tina--and your\r\nstrange-looking friend.\"\r\n\r\nIt impressed Larry then, and many times afterward, that Tugh's gaze at\r\nhim was mistrustful, wary.\r\n\r\n\"Come, Larry,\" said Tina. And again she demanded of Tugh, \"I ask you,\r\nwhere is Harl?\"\r\n\r\n\"At home. Safe at home, Princess.\" He gestured toward Major Atwood's\r\nhouse, which now in the growing daylight showed more plainly under its\r\nshrouding trees. \"That space off there holds our other cage as you\r\nknow, Tina. You and Harl were pursuing that other cage?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she agreed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey had stopped at the doorway, where Tugh stood slightly inside.\r\nLarry whispered:\r\n\r\n\"What does this mean, Tina?\"\r\n\r\nTugh said, \"Migul, the mechanism, is running wild in the other cage.\r\nBut you and Harl knew that?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she answered, and said softly to Larry, \"We will go. But,\r\nLarry, watch this Tugh! Harl and I never trusted him.\"\r\n\r\nTugh's manner was a combination of the self-confidence of a man of\r\nstanding and the deference due his young Princess. He was closing the\r\ndoor, and saying:\r\n\r\n\"Migul, that crazy, insubordinate machine, captured a man from 1935\r\nand a girl from 1777. But they are safe: he did not harm them. Harl is\r\nwith them.\"\r\n\r\n\"In our world, Tugh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes; at home. And we have Migul chained. Harl captured and subdued\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\nTugh was at the controls. \"May I take you and this friend of yours\r\nhome, Princess?\"\r\n\r\nShe whispered to Larry, \"I think it is best, don't you?\"\r\n\r\nLarry nodded.\r\n\r\nShe murmured, \"Be watchful, Larry!\" Then, louder: \"Yes, Tugh. Take\r\nus.\"\r\n\r\nTugh was bending over the controls.\r\n\r\n\"Ready now?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Tina.\r\n\r\nLarry's senses reeled momentarily as the cage flashed off into Time.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt was a smooth story which Tugh had to tell them; and he told it\r\nsmoothly. His dark eyes swung from Tina to Larry.\r\n\r\n\"I talked with that other young man from your world. George Rankin, he\r\nsaid his name was. He is somewhat like you: dressed much the same and\r\ntalks little. The girl calls herself Mary Atwood.\" He went on and told\r\nthem an elaborate, glib story, all of which was a lie. It did not\r\nwholly deceive Larry and Tina, yet they could not then prove it false.\r\nThe gist of it was that Mary and I were with Harl and the subdued\r\nMigul in 2930.\r\n\r\n\"It is strange that Harl did not come for us himself,\" said Tina.\r\n\r\nTugh's gaze was imperturbable as he answered. \"He is a clever young\r\nman, but he cannot be expected to handle these controls with my skill,\r\nPrincess, and he knows it; so he sent me. You see, he wanted very much\r\nto strike just this night and this hour, so as not to keep you\r\nwaiting.\"\r\n\r\nHe added, \"I am glad to have you back. Things are not well at home,\r\nPrincess. This insubordinate adventure of Migul's has been bad for the\r\nother mechanisms. News of it has spread, and the revolt is very near.\r\nWhat we are to do I cannot say, but I do know we did not like your\r\nabsence.\"\r\n\r\nThe trip which Larry and Tina now took to 2930 A.D. consumed, to their\r\nconsciousness of the passing of Time, some three hours. They\r\ndiscovered that they were hungry, and Tugh produced food and drink.\r\n\r\nLarry spent much of the time with Tina at the window, gazing at the\r\nchanging landscape while she told him of the events which to her were\r\nhistory--the recorded things on the Time-scroll which separated her\r\nworld and his.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTugh busied himself about the vehicle and left them much to\r\nthemselves. They had ample opportunity to discuss him and his story of\r\nHarl. It must be remembered that Larry had no knowledge of Tugh, save\r\nthe story which Alten had told of a cripple named Tugh in New York in\r\n1933-34; and Mary Atwood's mention of the coincidence of the Tugh she\r\nknew in 1777.\r\n\r\nBut Tina had known this Tugh for years. Though she, like Harl, had\r\nnever liked him, nevertheless he was a trusted and influential man in\r\nher world. Proof of his activities in other Time-worlds, there was\r\nnone so far, from Tina's viewpoint. Nor did Larry and Tina know as yet\r\nof the devastation of New York in 1935; nor of the murder of Major\r\nAtwood. The capture of Mary and me, the fight with the Robot in the\r\nback yard of the house on Patton Place--in all these incidents of the\r\nbandit cage, only Migul had figured. Migul--an insubordinate, crazy\r\nmechanism running amuck.\r\n\r\nYet upon Larry and Tina was a premonition that Tugh, here with them\r\nnow and so suavely friendly, was their real enemy.\r\n\r\n\"I wouldn't trust him,\" Larry whispered, \"any further than I can see\r\nhim. He's planning something, but I don't know what.\"\r\n\r\n\"But perhaps--and this I have often thought, Larry--perhaps it is his\r\naspect. He looks so repulsive--\"\r\n\r\nLarry shook his head. \"He does, for a fact; but I don't mean that.\r\nWhat Mary Atwood told me of the Tugh she knew, described the fellow.\r\nAnd so did Alten describe him. And in 1934 he murdered a girl: don't\r\nforget that, Tina--he, or someone who looked remarkably like him, and\r\nhad the same name.\"\r\n\r\nBut they knew that the best thing they could do now was to get to\r\n2930. Larry wanted to join me again, and Tugh maintained I was there.\r\nWell, they would soon find out....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nAs they passed the shadowy world of 1935, a queer emotion gripped\r\nLarry. This was his world, and he was speeding past it to the future.\r\nHe realized then that he wanted to be assured of my safety, and that\r\nof Mary Atwood and Harl; but what lay closest to his heart was the\r\nwelfare of the Princess Tina. Princess? He never thought of her as\r\nthat, save that it was a title she carried. She seemed just a small,\r\nstrangely-solemn white-faced girl. He could not conceive returning to\r\nhis own world and having her speed on, leaving him forever.\r\n\r\nHis thoughts winged ahead. He touched Tina as they stood together at\r\nthe window gazing out at the shadowy New York City. It was now 1940.\r\n\r\n\"Tina,\" he said, \"if our friends are safe in your world--\"\r\n\r\n\"If only they are, Larry!\"\r\n\r\n\"And if your people there are in trouble, in danger--you will let me\r\nhelp?\"\r\n\r\nShe turned abruptly to regard him, and he saw a mist of tenderness in\r\nthe dark pools of her eyes.\r\n\r\n\"In history, Larry, I have often been interested in reading of a\r\nstrange custom outgrown by us and supposed to be meaningless. Yet\r\nmaybe it is not. I mean--\"\r\n\r\nShe was suddenly breathless. \"I mean even a Princess, as they call me,\r\nlikes to--to be human. I want to--I mean I've often wondered--and\r\nyou're so dear--I want to try it. Was it like this? Show me.\"\r\n\r\nShe reached up, put her arms about his neck and kissed him!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n_A Thousand Years into the Future_\r\n\r\n1930 to 2930--a thousand years in three hours. It was sufficiently\r\nslow traveling so that Larry could see from the cage window the actual\r\ndetailed flow of movement: the changing outline of material objects\r\naround him. There had been the open country of Revolutionary times\r\nwhen this space was north of the city. It was a grey, ghostly\r\nlandscape of trees and the road and the shadowy outlines of the Atwood\r\nhouse five hundred feet away.\r\n\r\nLarry saw the road widen. The fence suddenly was gone. The trees were\r\nsuddenly gone. The shapes of houses were constantly appearing; then\r\nmelting down again, with others constantly rearing up to take their\r\nplaces; and always there were more houses, and larger, more enduring\r\nones. And then the Atwood house suddenly melted: a second or two, and\r\nall evidence of it and the trees about it were gone.\r\n\r\nThere was no road; it was a city street now; and it had widened so\r\nthat the cage was poised near the middle of it. And presently the\r\nhouses were set solid along its borders.\r\n\r\nAt 1910 Larry began to recognize the contour of the buildings: The\r\nantiquated Patton Place. But the flowing changing outlines adjusted\r\nthemselves constantly to a more familiar form. The new apartment\r\nhouse, down the block in which Larry and I lived, rose and assembled\r\nitself like a materializing spectre. A wink or two of Larry's eyelids\r\nand it was there. He recalled the months of its construction.\r\n\r\nThe cage, with Larry as a passenger, could not have stopped in these\r\nyears: he realized it, now. There was a nameless feeling, a repulsion\r\nagainst stopping; it was indescribable, but he was aware of it. He had\r\nlived these years once, and they were forbidden to him again.\r\n\r\nThe cage was still in its starting acceleration. They swept through\r\nthe year 1935, and then Larry was indefinably aware that the forbidden\r\narea had passed.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey went through those few days of June, 1935, during which Tugh's\r\nRobots had devastated the city, but it was too brief an action to make\r\na mark that Larry could see. It left a few very transitory marks,\r\nhowever. Larry noticed that along the uneven line of ghostly\r\nroof-tops, blobs of emptiness had appeared; he saw a short distance\r\naway that several of the houses had melted down into ragged, tumbled\r\nheaps. These were where the bombs had struck, dropped by the\r\nGovernment planes in an endeavor to wreck the Tugh house from which\r\nthe Robots were appearing. But the ragged, broken areas were filled in\r\na second--almost as soon as Larry realized they were there--and new\r\nand larger buildings than before appeared.\r\n\r\nAt sight of all this he murmured to Tina, \"Something has happened\r\nhere. I wonder what?\"\r\n\r\nHe chanced to turn, and saw that Tugh was regarding him very queerly;\r\nbut in a moment he forgot it in the wonders of the passage into his\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nThis growing, expanding city! It had seemed a giant to Larry in 1935,\r\nespecially after he had compared it to what it was in 1777. But now,\r\nin 1950, and beyond to the turn of the century, he stood amazed at the\r\nenormity of the shadowy structures rearing their spectral towers\r\naround him. For some years Patton Place, a backward section, held its\r\ngeneral form; then abruptly the city engulfed it. Larry saw monstrous\r\nbuildings of steel and masonry rising a thousand feet above him. For\r\nan instant, as they were being built he saw their skeleton outlines;\r\nand then they were complete. Yet they were not enduring, for in every\r\nflowing detail they kept changing.\r\n\r\nAn overhead sidewalk went like a balcony along what had been Patton\r\nPlace. Bridges and archways spanned the street. Then there came a\r\ntriple bank of overhead roadways. A distance away, a hundred feet\r\nabove the ground level, the shadowy form of what seemed a monorail\r\nstructure showed for a moment. It endured for what might have been a\r\nhundred years, and then it was gone....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis monstrous city! By 2030 there was a vast network of traffic\r\nlevels over what had been a street. It was an arcade, now, open at the\r\ntop near the cage; but further away Larry saw where the giant\r\nbuildings had flowed and mingled over it, with the viaducts, spider\r\nbridges and pedestrian levels plunging into tunnels to pierce through\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAnd high overhead, where the little sky which was left still showed,\r\nLarry saw the still higher outlines of a structure which quite\r\nevidently was a huge aerial landing stage for airliners.\r\n\r\nIt was an incredible city! There were spots of enduring light around\r\nLarry now--the city lights which for months and years shone here\r\nunchanged. The cage was no longer outdoors. The street which had\r\nbecome an open arcade was now wholly closed. A roof was overhead--a\r\ncity roof, to shut out the inclement weather. There was artificial\r\nlight and air and weather down here, and up on the roof additional\r\nspace for the city's teeming activities.\r\n\r\nLarry could see only a shadowy narrow vista, here indoors, but his\r\nimagination supplied visions of what the monstrous, incredible city\r\nmust be. There was a roof, perhaps, over all Manhattan. Bridges and\r\nviaducts would span to the great steel and stone structures across the\r\nrivers, so that water must seem to be in a canyon far underground.\r\nThere would be a cellar to this city, incredibly intricate with\r\nconduits of wires and drainage pipes, and on the roof rain or snow\r\nwould fall unnoticed by the millions of workers. Children born here in\r\npoverty might never yet have seen the blue sky and the sunlight, or\r\nknow that grass was green and lush and redolent when moist with\r\nmorning dew....\r\n\r\nLarry fancied this now to be the climax of city building here on\r\nearth; the city was a monster, now, unmanageable, threatening to\r\ndestroy the humans who had created it.... He tried to envisage the\r\nworld; the great nations; other cities like this one. Freight\r\ntransportation would go by rail and underseas, doubtless, and all the\r\npassengers by air....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTina, with her knowledge of history, could sketch the events. The\r\nYellow War--the white races against the Orientals--was over by the\r\nyear 2000. The three great nations were organized in another\r\nhalf-century: the white, the yellow and the black.\r\n\r\nBy the year 2000, the ancient dirigibles had proven impractical, and\r\ngreat airliners of the plane type were encircling the earth. New\r\nmotors, wing-spreads, and a myriad devices made navigation of the\r\nupper altitudes possible. At a hundred thousand feet, upon all the\r\nGreat Circle routes, liners were rushing at nearly a thousand miles an\r\nhour. They would halt at intervals, to allow helicopter tenders to\r\ncome up to transfer descending passengers.\r\n\r\nThen the etheric wave-thrust principle was discovered: by 2500 A.D.\r\nman was voyaging out into space and Interplanetary travel began. This\r\nbrought new problems: a rush of new millions of humans to live upon\r\nour Earth; new wars; new commerce in peace times; new ideas; new\r\nscientific knowledge....\r\n\r\nBy 2500, the city around Larry must have reached its height. It stayed\r\nthere a half century; and then it began coming down. Its degeneration\r\nwas slow, in the beginning. First, there might have been a hole in the\r\narcade which was not repaired. Then others would appear, as the\r\nneglect spread. The population left. The great buildings of metal and\r\nstone, so solidly appearing to the brief lifetime of a single\r\nindividual, were impermanent over the centuries.\r\n\r\nBy 2600, the gigantic ghosts had all melted down. They lay in a\r\nshadowy pile, burying the speeding cage. There was no stopping here;\r\nthere was no space unoccupied in which they could stop. Larry could\r\nsee only the tangled spectres of broken, rusting, rotting metal and\r\nstone.\r\n\r\nHe wondered what could have done it. A storm of nature? Or had mankind\r\nstrangely turned decadent, and rushed back in a hundred years or so to\r\nsavagery? It could not have been the latter, because very soon the\r\nruins were moving away: the people were clearing the city site for\r\nsomething new. For fifty years it went on.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTina explained it. The age of steam had started the great city of New\r\nYork, and others like it, into its monstrous congestion of human\r\nactivity. There was steam for power and steam for slow transportation\r\nby railroads and surface ships. Then the conquest of the air, and the\r\ntransportation of power by electricity, gradually changed things. But\r\nman was slow to realize his possibilities. Even in 1930, all the new\r\nelements existed; but the great cities grew monstrous of their own\r\nmomentum. Business went to the cities because the people were there;\r\nworkers flocked in because the work was there to call them.\r\n\r\nBut soon the time came when the monster city was too unwieldy. The\r\ntraffic, the drainage, the water supply could not cope with\r\nconditions. Still, man struggled on. The workers were mere\r\nautomatons--pallid attendants of machinery; people living in a world\r\nof beauty who never had seen it; who knew of nothing but the city\r\narcades where the sun never shone and where amusements were as\r\nartificial as the light and air.\r\n\r\nThen man awakened to his folly. Disease broke out in New York City in\r\n2551, and in a month swept eight million people into death. The cities\r\nwere proclaimed impractical, unsafe. And suddenly the people realized\r\nhow greatly they hated the city; how strangely beautiful the world\r\ncould be in the fashion God created it....\r\n\r\nThere was, over the next fifty years, an exodus to the rural sections.\r\nFood was produced more cheaply, largely because it was produced more\r\nabundantly. Man found his wants suddenly simplified.\r\n\r\nAnd business found that concentration was unnecessary. The telephone\r\nand television made personal contacts not needed. The aircraft, the\r\nhigh-speed auto-trucks over modern speedways, the aeroplane-motored\r\nmonorails, the rocket-trains--all these shortened distance. And, most\r\nimportant of all, the transportation of electrical energy from great\r\ncentral power companies made small industrial units practical even\r\nupon remote farms. The age of electricity came into its own. The\r\ncities were doomed....\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLarry saw, through 2600 and 2700 A.D., a new form of civilization\r\nrising around him. At first it seemed a queer combination of the old\r\nfashioned village and a strange modernism. There were, here upon\r\nManhattan Island, metal houses, widely spaced in gardens, and\r\nelectrically powered factories of unfamiliar aspect. Overhead were\r\nskeleton structures, like landing stages; and across the further\r\ndistance was the fleeting, transitory wraith of a monorail air-road.\r\nAlong the river banks were giant docks for surface vessels and sub-sea\r\nfreighters. There was a little concentration here, but not much. Man\r\nhad learned his lesson.\r\n\r\nThis was a new era. Man was striving really to play, as well as work.\r\nBut the work had to be done. With the constant development of\r\nmechanical devices, there was always a new machine devised to help the\r\noperation of its fellow. And over it all was the hand of the human,\r\nuntil suddenly the worker found that he was no more than an attendant\r\nupon an inanimate thing which did everything more skilfully than he\r\ncould do it. Thus came the idea of the Robot--something to attend, to\r\noversee, to operate machines. In Larry's time it had already begun\r\nwith a myriad devices of \"automatic control.\" In Tina's Time-world it\r\nreached its ultimate--and diabolical--development....\r\n\r\nAt 2900, Larry saw, five hundred feet to the east, the walls of a long\r\nlow laboratory rising. The other cage--which in 1777 was in Major\r\nAtwood's garden, and in 1935 was in the back yard of the Tugh house on\r\nBeckman Place--was housed now in 2930, in a room of this\r\nlaboratory....\r\n\r\nAt 2905, with the vehicle slowing for its stopping, Tina gestured\r\ntoward the walls of her palace, whose shadowy forms were rising close\r\nat hand. Then the palace garden grew and flourished, and Larry saw\r\nthat this cage he was in was set within this garden.\r\n\r\n\"We are almost there, Larry,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" he answered. An emotion gripped him. \"Tina, your world--why\r\nit's so strange! But you are not strange.\"\r\n\r\n\"Am I not, Larry?\"\r\n\r\nHe smiled at her; he felt like showing her again that the ancient\r\ncustom of kissing was not wholly meaningless, but Tugh was regarding\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n\"I was comparing,\" said Larry, \"that girl Mary Atwood, from the year\r\n1777, and you. You are so different in looks, in dress, but you're\r\njust--girls.\"\r\n\r\nShe laughed. \"The world changes, Larry, but not human nature.\"\r\n\r\n\"Ready?\" called Tugh. \"We are here, Tina.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Tugh. You have the dial set for the proper night and hour?\"\r\n\r\n\"Of course. I make no mistake. Did I not invent these dials?\"\r\n\r\nThe cage slackened through a day of sunlight; plunged into a night;\r\nand slid to its soundless, reeling halt....\r\n\r\nTina drew Larry to the door and opened it upon a fragrant garden,\r\nsomnolently drowsing in the moonlight.\r\n\r\n\"This is my world, Larry,\" she said. \"And here is my home.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTugh was with them as they left the cage. He said:\r\n\r\n\"This is the tri-night hour of the very night you left here. Princess\r\nTina. You see, I calculated correctly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where did you leave Harl and the two visitors?\" she demanded.\r\n\r\n\"Here. Right here.\"\r\n\r\nAcross the garden Larry saw three dark forms coming forward. They were\r\nthree small Robots of about Tina's stature--domestic servants of the\r\npalace. They crowded up, crying:\r\n\r\n\"Master Tugh! Princess!\"\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" Tugh asked.\r\n\r\nThe hollow voices echoed with excitement as one of them said:\r\n\r\n\"Master Tugh, there has been murder here! We have dared tell no one\r\nbut you or the Princess. Harl is murdered!\"\r\n\r\nLarry chanced to see Tugh's astonished face, and in the horror of the\r\nmoment a feeling came to Larry that Tugh was acting unnaturally. He\r\nforgot it at once; but later he was to recall it forcibly, and to\r\nrealize that the treacherous Tugh had planned this with these Robots.\r\n\r\n\"Master Tugh, Harl is murdered! Migul escaped and murdered Harl, and\r\ntook the body away with him!\"\r\n\r\nLarry was stricken dumb. Tugh seized the little Robot by his metal\r\nshoulders. \"Liar! What do you mean?\"\r\n\r\nTina gasped, \"Where are our visitors--the young man and the girl?\"\r\n\r\n\"Migul took them!\"\r\n\r\n\"Where?\" Tina demanded.\r\n\r\n\"We don't know. We think very far down in the caverns of machinery.\r\nMigul said he was going to feed them to the machines!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n_The New York of 2930_\r\n\r\nLarry stood alone at an upper window of the palace gazing out at the\r\nsomnolent moonlit city. It was an hour or two before dawn. Tina and\r\nTugh had started almost at once into the underground caverns to which\r\nTina was told Migul had fled with his two captives. They would not\r\ntake Larry with them; the Robot workers in the subterranean chambers\r\nwere all sullen and upon the verge of a revolt, and the sight of a\r\nstrange human would have aroused them dangerously.\r\n\r\n\"It should not take long,\" Tina had said hastily. \"I will give you a\r\nroom in which to wait for me.\"\r\n\r\n\"And there is food and drink,\" Tugh suavely urged. \"And most surely\r\nyou need sleep. You too Princess,\" he suddenly added. \"Let me go into\r\nthe caverns alone: I can do better than you; these Robots obey me. I\r\nthink I know where that rascally Migul has hidden.\"\r\n\r\n\"Rascally?\" Larry burst out. \"Is that what you call it when you've\r\njust heard that it committed murder? Tina. I won't stay: nor will I\r\nlet--\"\r\n\r\n\"Wait!\" said Tina. \"Tugh, look here--\"\r\n\r\n\"The young man from 1935 is very positive what he will and what he\r\nwon't,\" Tugh observed sardonically. He drew his cloak around his squat\r\nmisshapen body, and shrugged.\r\n\r\n\"But I won't let you go,\" Larry finished. The palace was somnolent;\r\nthe officials were asleep: none had heard of the murder. Strangely lax\r\nwas the human government here. Larry had sensed this when he suggested\r\nthat police or an official party be sent at once to capture Migul and\r\nrescue Mary Atwood and me.\r\n\r\n\"It could not be done,\" Tina exclaimed. \"To organize such a party\r\nwould take hours. And--\"\r\n\r\n\"And the Robots,\" Tugh finished with a sour smile, \"would openly\r\nrevolt when such a party came at them! You have no idea what you\r\nsuggest, young man. To avoid an open revolt--that is our chief aim.\r\nBesides, if you rushed at Migul it would frighten him; and then he\r\nwould surely kill his captives, if he has not done so already.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThat silenced Larry. He stared at them hopelessly while they argued it\r\nout: and the three small domesticated Robots stood by, listening\r\ncuriously.\r\n\r\n\"I'll go with you, Tugh.\" Tina decided. \"Perhaps, without making any\r\ndemonstration of force, we can find Migul.\"\r\n\r\nTugh bowed. \"Your will is mine, Princess. I think I can find him and\r\ncontrol him to prevent harm to his captives.\"\r\n\r\nHe was a good actor, that Tugh; he convinced Larry and Tina of his\r\nsincerity. His dark eyes flashed as he added, \"And if I get control of\r\nhim and find he's murdered Harl, we will have him no more. I'll\r\ndisconnect him! Smash him! Quietly, of course, Princess.\"\r\n\r\nThey led Larry through a dim silent corridor of the palace, past two\r\nsleepy-faced human guards and two or three domesticated Robots.\r\nAscending two spiral metal stairways to the upper third floor of the\r\npalace they left Larry in his room.\r\n\r\n\"By dawn or soon after we will return,\" said Tina \"But you try and\r\nsleep; there is nothing you can do now.\"\r\n\r\n\"You'll be careful, Tina?\" The helpless feeling upon Larry suddenly\r\nintensified. Subconsciously he was aware of the menace upon him and\r\nTina, but he could not define it.\r\n\r\nShe pressed his hand. \"I will be careful; that I promise.\"\r\n\r\nShe left with Tugh. At once a feeling of loneliness leaped upon Larry.\r\n\r\nHe found the apartment a low-vaulted metal room. There was the sheen\r\nof dim, blue-white illumination from hidden lights, disclosing the\r\npadded metal furniture: a couch, low and comfortable; a table set with\r\nfood and drink; low chairs, strangely fashioned, and cabinets against\r\nthe wall which seemed to be mechanical devices for amusement. There\r\nwas a row of instrument controls which he guessed were the room\r\ntemperature, ventilating and lighting mechanisms. It was an oddly\r\nfuturistic room. The windows were groups of triangles--the upper\r\nsections prisms, to bend the light from the sky into the room's\r\nfurthest recesses. The moonlight came through the prisms, now, and\r\nspread over the cream-colored rug and the heavy wall draperies. The\r\nleaded prism casements laid a pattern of bars on the floor. The room\r\nheld a faint whisper of mechanical music.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLarry stood at one of the windows gazing out over the drowsing city.\r\nThe low metal buildings, generally of one or two levels, lay pale grey\r\nin the moonlight. Gardens and trees surrounded them. The streets were\r\nwide roadways, lined with trees. Ornamental vegetation was everywhere;\r\neven the flat-roofed house tops were set with gardens, little white\r\npebbled paths, fountains and pergolas.\r\n\r\nA mile or so away, a river gleamed like a silver ribbon--the Hudson.\r\nTo the south were docks, low against the water, with rows of\r\nblue-white spots of light. The whole city was close to the ground, but\r\noccasionally, especially across the river, skeleton landing stages\r\nrose a hundred feet into the air.\r\n\r\nThe scene, at this hour just before dawn, was somnolent and peaceful.\r\nIt was a strange New York, so different from the sleepless city of\r\nLarry's time! There were a few moving lights in the streets, but not\r\nmany; they seemed to be lights carried by pedestrians. Off by the\r\ndocks, at the river surface, rows of colored lights were slowly\r\ncreeping northward: a sub-sea freighter arriving from Eurasia. And as\r\nLarry watched, from the southern sky a line of light materialized into\r\nan airliner which swept with a low humming throb over the city and\r\nalighted upon a distant stage.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLarry's attention went again to the Hudson river. At the nearest point\r\nto him there was a huge dam blocking it. North of the dam the river\r\nsurface was at least two hundred feet higher than to the south. It lay\r\nabove the dam like a placid canal, with low palisades its western bank\r\nand a high dyke built up along the eastern city side. The water went\r\nin spillways through the dam, forming again into the old natural river\r\nbelow it and flowing with it to the south.\r\n\r\nThe dam was not over a mile or so from Larry's window; in his time it\r\nmight have been the western end of Christopher Street. The moonlight\r\nshone on the massive metal of it: the water spilled through it in a\r\ndozen shining cascades. There was a low black metal structure perched\r\nhalfway up the lower side of the dam, a few bluish lights showing\r\nthrough its windows. Though Larry did not know it then, this was the\r\nNew York Power House. Great transformers were here, operated by\r\nturbines in the dam. The main power came over cables from Niagara: was\r\ntransformed and altered here and sent into the air as radio-power for\r\nall the New York District.[3]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 3: In 2930, all aircraft engines were operated by\r\nradio-power transmitted by senders in various districts. The New York\r\nPower House controlled a local district of about two hundred miles\r\nradius.]\r\n\r\nLarry crossed his room to gaze through north and eastward windows. He\r\nsaw now that the grounds of this three-story building of Tina's palace\r\nwere surrounded by a ten-foot metal wall, along whose top were wires\r\nsuggesting that it was electrified for defense. The garden lay just\r\nbeneath Larry's north window. Through the tree branches the garden\r\npaths, beds of flowers and the fountains were visible. One-story\r\npalace wings partially enclosed the garden space, and outside was the\r\nelectrified wall. The Time-traveling cage stood faintly shining in the\r\ndimness of the garden under the spreading foliage.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo the east, beyond the palace wall, there was an open garden of\r\nverdure crossed by a roadway. The nearest building was five hundred\r\nfeet away. There was a small, barred gate in the palace walls beyond\r\nit. The road led to this other building--a squat, single-storied metal\r\nstructure. This was a Government laboratory, operated by and in charge\r\nof Robots. It was almost square: two or three hundred feet in length\r\nand no more than thirty feet high, with a flat roof in the center of\r\nwhich was perched a little metal conning tower surmounted by a sending\r\naerial. As Larry stood there, the broadcast magnified voice of a Robot\r\ndroned out over the quiet city:\r\n\r\n\"Trinight plus two hours. All is well.\"\r\n\r\nStrange mechanical voice with a formula half ancient, half\r\nsuper-modern!\r\n\r\nIt was in this metal laboratory, Larry knew, that the other\r\nTime-traveling cage was located. And beneath it was the entrance to\r\nthe great caverns where the Robots worked attending inert machinery to\r\ncarry on the industry of this region. The night was very silent, but\r\nnow Larry was conscious of a faraway throb--a humming, throbbing\r\nvibration from under the ground: the blended hum of a myriad muffled\r\nnoises. Work was going on down there; manifold mechanical activities.\r\nAll was mechanical: while the humans who had devised the mechanisms\r\nslept under the trees in the moonlight of the surface city.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTina had gone with Tugh down into those caverns, to locate Migul, to\r\nfind Mary Atwood and me.... The oppression, the sense of being a\r\nstranger alone here in this world, grew upon Larry. He left the\r\nwindows and began pacing the room. Tina should soon return. Or had\r\ndisaster come upon us all?...\r\n\r\nLarry's thoughts were frightening. If Tina did not return, what would\r\nhe do? He could not operate the Time-cage. He would go to the\r\nofficials of the palace; he thought cynically of the extraordinary\r\nchanges time had brought to New York City, to all the world. These\r\nhumans now must be very fatuous. To the mechanisms they had relegated\r\nall the work, all industrial activity. Inevitably, through the\r\ngenerations, decadence must have come. Mankind would be no longer\r\nefficient; that was an attribute of the machines. Larry told himself\r\nthat these officials, knowing of impending trouble with the Robots,\r\nwere fatuously trustful that the storm would pass without breaking.\r\nThey were, indeed, as we very soon learned.\r\n\r\nLarry ate a little of the food which was in the room, then lay down on\r\nthe couch. He did not intend to sleep, but merely to wait until after\r\ndawn; and if Tina had not returned by then he would do something\r\ndrastic about it. But what? He lay absorbed by his gloomy thoughts....\r\n\r\nBut they were not all gloomy. Some were about Tina--so very human, and\r\nyet so strange a little Princess.\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n_Harl's Confession_\r\n\r\nLarry was awakened by a hand upon his shoulder. He struggled to\r\nconsciousness, and heard his name being called.\r\n\r\n\"Larry! Wake up, Larry!\"\r\n\r\nTina was bending over him, and it was late afternoon! The day for\r\nwhich he had been waiting had come and gone; the sun was dropping low\r\nin the west behind the shining river; the dam showed frowning, with\r\nthe Power House clinging to its side like an eagle's eyrie.\r\n\r\nTina sat on Larry's couch and explained what she had done. Tugh and\r\nshe had gone to the nearby laboratory building. The Robots were\r\nsullen, but still obedient, and had admitted them. The other\r\nTime-traveling cage was there, lying quiescent in its place, but it\r\nwas unoccupied.\r\n\r\nNone of the Robots would admit having seen Migul; nor the arrival of\r\nthe cage; nor the strangers from the past. Then Tugh and Tina had\r\nstarted down into the subterranean caverns. But it was obviously very\r\ndangerous; the Robots at work down there were hostile to their\r\nPrincess; so Tugh had gone on alone.\r\n\r\n\"He says he can control the Robots,\" Tina explained, \"and Larry, it\r\nseems that he can. He went on and I came back.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is he now? Why didn't you wake me up?\"\r\n\r\n\"You needed the sleep,\" she said smilingly; \"and there was nothing you\r\ncould do. Tugh is not yet come. He must have gone a long distance;\r\nmust surely have learned where Migul is hiding. He should be back any\r\ntime.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTina had seen the Government Council. The city was proceeding\r\nnormally. There was no difficulty with Robots anywhere save here in\r\nNew York, and the council felt that the affair would come to nothing.\r\n\r\n\"The Council told me,\" said Tina indignantly, \"that much of the menace\r\nwas the exaggeration of my own fancy, and that Tugh has the Robots\r\nwell controlled. They place much trust in Tugh; I wish I could.\"\r\n\r\n\"You told them about me?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, of course; and about George Rankin, and Mary Atwood. And the\r\nloss of Harl: he is missing, not proven murdered, as they very well\r\npointed out to me. They have named a time to-morrow to give you\r\naudience, and told me to keep you out of sight in the meanwhile. They\r\nblame this Time-traveling for the Robots' insurgent ideas. Strangers\r\nexcite the thinking mechanisms.\"\r\n\r\n\"You think my friends will be rescued?\" demanded Larry.\r\n\r\nShe regarded him soberly. \"I hope so--oh, I do! I fear for them as\r\nmuch as you do, Larry. I know you think I take it lightly, but--\"\r\n\r\n\"Not that,\" Larry protested. \"Only--\"\r\n\r\n\"I have not known what to do. The officials refuse any open aggression\r\nagainst the Robots, because it would precipitate exactly what we\r\nfear--which is nearly a fact: it would. But there is one thing I have\r\nto do. I have been expecting Tugh to return every moment, and this I\r\ndo not want him to know about. There's a mystery concerning Harl, and\r\nno one else knows of it but myself. I want you with me, Larry: I do\r\nnot want to go alone; I--for the first time in my life, Larry--I think\r\nI am afraid!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nShe huddled against him and he put his arm about her. And Larry's true\r\nsituation came to him, then. He was alone in this strange Time-world,\r\nwith only this girl for a companion. She was but a frightened, almost\r\nhelpless girl, for all she bore the title of traditional Princess, and\r\nshe was surrounded by inefficient, fatuous officials--among them Tugh,\r\nwho was a scoundrel, undoubtedly. Larry suddenly recalled Tugh's look,\r\nwhen, in the garden, the domestic Robots had told the story of Harl's\r\nmurder; and like a light breaking on him, he was now wholly aware of\r\nTugh's duplicity. He was convinced he would have to act for himself,\r\nwith only this girl Tina to help him.\r\n\r\n\"Mystery?\" he said. \"What mystery is there about Harl?\"\r\n\r\nShe told him now that Harl had once, a year ago, taken her aside and\r\nmade her promise that if anything happened to him--in the event of his\r\ndeath or disappearance--she would go to his private work-room, where,\r\nin a secret place which he described, she would find a confession.\r\n\r\n\"A confession of his?\" Larry demanded.\r\n\r\n\"Yes; he said so. And he would say no more than that. It is something\r\nof which he was ashamed, or guilty, which he wanted me to know. He\r\nloved me, Larry. I realized it, though he never said so. And I'm going\r\nnow to his room, to see what it was he wanted me to know. I would have\r\ngone alone, earlier; but I got suddenly frightened; I want you with\r\nme.\"\r\n\r\nThey were unarmed. Larry cursed the fact, but Tina had no way of\r\ngetting a weapon without causing official comment. Larry started for\r\nthe window where the city stretched, more active now, under the red\r\nand gold glow of a setting sun. Lights were winking on; the dusk of\r\ntwilight was at hand.\r\n\r\n\"Come now,\" said Tina, \"before Tugh returns.\"\r\n\r\n\"Where is Harl's room?\"\r\n\r\n\"Down under the palace in the sub-cellar. The corridors are deserted\r\nat this hour, and no one will see us.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey left Larry's room and traversed a dim corridor on whose padded\r\nfloor their footsteps were soundless. Through distant arcades, voices\r\nsounded; there was music in several of the rooms; it struck Larry that\r\nthis was a place of diversion for humans with no work to do. Tina\r\navoided the occupied rooms. Domestic Robots were occasionally\r\ndistantly visible, but Tina and Larry encountered none.\r\n\r\nThey descended a spiral stairway and passed down a corridor from the\r\nmain building to a cross wing. Through a window Larry saw that they\r\nwere at the ground level. The garden was outside; there was a glimpse\r\nof the Time-cage standing there.\r\n\r\nAnother stairway, then another, they descended beneath the ground. The\r\ncorridor down here seemed more like a tunnel. There was a cave-like\r\nopen space, with several tunnels leading from it in different\r\ndirections. This once had been part of the sub-cellar of the gigantic\r\nNew York City--these tunnels ramifying into underground chambers, most\r\nof which had now fallen into disuse. But few had been preserved\r\nthrough the centuries, and they now were the caverns of the Robots.\r\n\r\nTina indicated a tunnel extending eastward, a passage leading to a\r\nroom beneath the Robot laboratory. Tugh and Tina had used it that\r\nmorning. Gazing down its blue-lit length Larry saw, fifty feet or so\r\naway, that there was a metal-grid barrier which must be part of the\r\nelectrical fortifications of the palace. A human guard was sitting\r\nthere at a tiny gate-way, a hood-light above him, illumining his black\r\nand white garbed figure.\r\n\r\nTina called softly. \"All well, Alent? Tugh has not passed back?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Princess,\" he answered, standing erect. The voices echoed through\r\nthe confined space with a muffled blur.\r\n\r\n\"Let no one pass but humans, Alent.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is my order,\" he said. He had not noticed Larry, whom Tina had\r\npushed into a shadow against the wall. The Princess waved at the guard\r\nand turned away, whispering to Larry:\r\n\r\n\"Come!\"\r\n\r\nThere were rooms opening off this corridor--decrepit dungeons, most of\r\nthem seemed to Larry. He had tried to keep his sense of direction, and\r\nfigured they were now under the palace garden. Tina stopped abruptly.\r\nThere were no lights here, only the glow from one at a distance. To\r\nLarry it was an eery business.\r\n\r\n\"What is it?\" he whispered.\r\n\r\n\"Wait! I thought I heard something.\"\r\n\r\nIn the dead, heavy silence Larry found that there was much to hear.\r\n\r\nVoices very dim from the palace overhead; infinitely faint music; the\r\nclammy sodden drip of moisture from the tunnel roof. And, permeating\r\neverything, the faint hum of machinery.\r\n\r\nTina touched him in the gloom. \"It's nothing, I guess. Though I\r\nthought I heard a man's voice.\"\r\n\r\n\"Overhead?\"\r\n\r\n\"No; down here.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere was a dark, arched door near at hand. Tina entered it and\r\nfumbled for a switch, and in the soft light that came Larry saw an\r\nunoccupied apartment very similar to the one he had had upstairs, save\r\nthat this was much smaller.\r\n\r\n\"Harl's room,\" said Tina. She prowled along the wall where audible\r\nbook-cylinders[4] stood in racks, searching for a title. Presently she\r\nfound a hidden switch, pressed it, and a small section of the case\r\nswung out, revealing a concealed compartment. Larry saw her fingers\r\ntrembling as she drew out a small brass cylinder.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 4: Cylinder records of books which by machinery gave audible\r\nrendition, in similar fashion to the radio-phonograph.]\r\n\r\n\"This must be it, Larry,\" she said.\r\n\r\nThey took it to a table which held a shaded light. Within the cylinder\r\nwas a scroll of writing. Tina unrolled it and held it under the light,\r\nwhile Larry stood breathless, watching her.\r\n\r\n\"Is it what you wanted?\" Larry murmured.\r\n\r\n\"Yes. Poor Harl!\"\r\n\r\nShe read aloud to Larry the gist of it in the few closing paragraphs.\r\n\r\n     \"... and so I want to confess to you that I have been taking\r\n     credit for that which is not mine. I wish I had the courage\r\n     to tell you personally; someday I think I shall. I did not\r\n     help Tugh invent our Time-traveling cages. I was in the\r\n     palace garden one night some years ago when the cage\r\n     appeared. Tugh is a man from a future Time-world; just what\r\n     date ahead of now, I do not know, for he has never been\r\n     willing to tell me. He captured me. I promised him I would\r\n     say nothing, but help him pretend that we had invented the\r\n     cage he had brought with him from the future. Tugh told me\r\n     he invented them. It was later that he brought the other\r\n     cage here.\r\n\r\n     \"I was an obscure young man here a few years ago. I loved\r\n     you even then, Tina: I think you have guessed that. I\r\n     yielded to the temptation--and took the credit with Tugh.\r\n\r\n     \"I do love you, though I think I shall never have the\r\n     courage to tell you so.\r\n\r\n                                                 Harl.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTina rolled up the paper. \"Poor Harl! So all the praise we gave him\r\nfor his invention was undeserved!\"\r\n\r\nBut Larry's thoughts were on Tugh. So the fellow was not of this era\r\nat all! He had come from a Time still further in the future!\r\n\r\nA step sounded in the doorway behind them. They swung around to find\r\nTugh standing there, with his thick misshapen figured huddled in the\r\nblack cloak.\r\n\r\n\"Tugh!\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Princess, no less than Tugh. Alent told me as I came through\r\nthat you were down here. I saw your light, here in Harl's room and\r\ncame.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you find Migul and his captives--the girl from 1777 and the man\r\nof 1935?\"\r\n\r\n\"No, Princess, Migul has fled with them,\" was the cripple's answer. He\r\nadvanced into the room and pushed back his black hood. The blue light\r\nshone on his massive-jawed face with a lurid sheen. Larry stood back\r\nand watched him. It was the first time that he had had opportunity of\r\nobserving Tugh closely. The cripple was smiling sardonically.\r\n\r\n\"I have no fear for the prisoners,\" he added in his suave, silky\r\nfashion. \"That crazy mechanism would not dare harm them. But it has\r\nfled with them into some far-distant recess of the caverns. I could\r\nnot find them.\"\r\n\r\n\"Did you try?\" Larry demanded abruptly.\r\n\r\nTugh swung on him. \"Yes, young sir, I tried.\" It seemed that Tugh's\r\nblack eyes narrowed; his heavy jaw clicked as he snapped it shut. The\r\nsmile on his face faded, but his voice remained imperturbable as he\r\nadded:\r\n\r\n\"You are aggressive, young Larry--but to no purpose.... Princess, I\r\nlike not the attitude of the Robots. Beyond question some of them must\r\nhave seen Migul, but they would not tell me so. I still think I can\r\ncontrol them, though. I hope so.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLarry could think of nothing to say. It seemed to him childish that he\r\nshould stand listening to a scoundrel tricking this girl Tina. A dozen\r\nwild schemes of what he might do to try and rescue Mary Atwood and me\r\nrevolved in his mind, but they all seemed wholly impractical.\r\n\r\n\"The Robots are working badly,\" Tugh went on. \"In the north district\r\none of the great foundries where they are casting the plates for the\r\nnew Inter-Allied airliner has ceased operations. The Robot workmen\r\nwere sullen, inefficient, neglectful. The inert machinery was ill\r\ncared for, and it went out of order. I was there, Princess, for an\r\nhour or more to-day. They have started up again now; it was\r\nfundamentally no more than a burned bearing which a Robot failed to\r\noil properly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Is that what you call searching for Migul?\" Larry burst out. \"Tina,\r\nsee here--isn't there something we can do?\" Larry found himself\r\nignoring Tugh. \"I'm not going to stand around! Can't we send a squad\r\nof police after Migul?--go with them--actually make an effort to find\r\nthem? This man Tugh certainly has not tried!\"\r\n\r\n\"Have I not?\" Tugh's cloak parted as he swung on Larry. His bent legs\r\nwere twitching with his anger; his voice was a harsh rasp. \"I like not\r\nyour insolence. I am doing all that can be done.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLarry held his ground as Tugh fronted him. He had a wild thought that\r\nTugh had a weapon under his cloak.\r\n\r\n\"Perhaps you are,\" said Larry. \"But to me it seems--\"\r\n\r\nTugh turned away. His gaze went to the cylinder which Tina was still\r\nclutching. His sardonic smile returned.\r\n\r\n\"So Harl made a confession, Princess?\"\r\n\r\n\"That,\" she said, \"is none--\"\r\n\r\n\"Of my affair? Oh, but it is. I was here in the archway and I heard\r\nyou read it. A very nice young man, was Harl. I hope Migul has not\r\nmurdered him.\"\r\n\r\n\"You come from future Time?\" Tina began.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Princess! I must admit it now. I invented the cages.\"\r\n\r\nLarry murmured to himself, \"You stole them, probably.\"\r\n\r\n\"But my Government and I had a quarrel, so I decided to leave my own\r\nTime-world and come back to yours--permanently. I hope you will keep\r\nthe secret. I have been here so long. Princess, I am really one of you\r\nnow. At heart, certainly.\"\r\n\r\n\"From when did you come?\" she demanded.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe bowed slightly. \"I think that may remain my own affair, Tina. It is\r\nthrough no fault of mine I am outlawed. I shall never return.\" He\r\nadded earnestly, \"Do not you think we waste time? I am agreed with\r\nyoung Larry that something drastic must be done about Migul. Have you\r\nseen the Council about it to-day?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes. They want you to come to them at once.\"\r\n\r\n\"I shall. But the Council easily may decide upon something too rash.\"\r\nHe lowered his voice, and on his face Larry saw a strange,\r\nunfathomable look. \"Princess, at any moment there may be a Robot\r\nuprising. Is the Power House well guarded by humans?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" she said.\r\n\r\n\"No Robots in or about it? Tina, I do not want to frighten you, but I\r\nthink our first efforts should be for defense. The Council acts slowly\r\nand stubbornly. What I advise them to do may be done, and may not. I\r\nwas thinking. If we could get to the Power House--Do you realize,\r\nTina, that if the Robots should suddenly break into rebellion, they\r\nwould attack first of all the Power House?[5] It was my idea--\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: The Power House on the Hudson dam was operated by inert\r\nmachinery and manned entirely by humans--the only place in the city\r\nwhich was so handled. This was because of its extreme importance. The\r\nair-power was broadcast from there. Without that power the entire\r\nseveral hundred mile district around New York would be dead. No\r\naircraft could enter, save perhaps some skilfully handled motorless\r\nglider, if aided by sufficiently fortuitous air currents. Every\r\nsurface vehicle used this power, and every sub-sea freighter. The city\r\nlights, and every form of city power, were centralized here also, as\r\nwell as the broadcasting audible and etheric transmitters and\r\nreceivers. Without the Power House, New York City and all its\r\nneighborhood would be inoperative, and cut off from the outside\r\nworld.]\r\n\r\nTugh suddenly broke off, and all stood listening. There was a\r\ncommotion overhead in the palace. They heard the thud of running\r\nfootsteps; human voices raised to shouts; and, outside the palace,\r\nother voices. A ventilating shaft nearby brought them down plainly.\r\nThere were the guttural, hollow voices of shouting Robots, the clank\r\nof their metal bodies; the ring of steel, as though with sword-blades\r\nthey were thumping their metal thighs.\r\n\r\nA Robot mob was gathered close outside the palace walls. The revolt of\r\nthe Robots had come!\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n_Tugh, the Clever Man_\r\n\r\n\"Sit quiet, George Rankin. And you, Mistress Mary; you will both be\r\nquite safe with Migul if you are docile.\"\r\n\r\nTugh stood before us. We were in a dim recess of a great cavern with\r\nthe throb of whirring machinery around us. It was the same day which I\r\nhave just described; Larry was at this moment asleep in the palace\r\nroom. Tugh and Tina had come searching for Migul; and Tugh had\r\ncontrived to send Tina back. Then he had come directly to us, finding\r\nus readily since we were hidden where he had told Migul to hide us.\r\n\r\nThis cavern was directly beneath the Robot laboratory in which the\r\nTime-traveling cage was placed. A small spiral stairway led downward\r\nsome two levels, opening into a great, luridly lighted room. Huge\r\ninert machines stood about. Great wheels were flashing as they\r\nrevolved, turning the dynamos to generate the several types of current\r\nused by the city's underground industrial activities.\r\n\r\nIt was a tremendous subterranean room. I saw only one small section of\r\nit; down the blue-lit aisles the rows of machines may have stretched\r\nfor half a mile or more. The low hum of them was an incessant pound\r\nagainst my senses. The great inert mechanisms had tiny lights upon\r\nthem which gleamed like eyes. The illumined gauge-faces--each of them\r\nI passed seemed staring at me. The brass jackets were polished until\r\nthey shone with the sheen of the overhead tube lights; the giant\r\nwheels flashed smoothly upon oiled bearings. They were in every\r\nfashion of shape and size, these inert machines. Some towered toward\r\nthe metal-beamed ceiling, with great swaying pendulums that ticked\r\nlike a giant clock. Some clanked with eccentric cams--a jarring rhythm\r\nas though the heart of the thing were limping with its beat. Others\r\nhad a ragged, frightened pulse; others stood placid, outwardly\r\nmotionless under smooth, polished cases, but humming inside with a\r\nmyriad blended sounds.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nInert machines. Yet some were capable of locomotion. There was a small\r\ntruck on wheels which were set in universal joints. Of its own\r\npower--radio controlled perhaps, so that it seemed acting of its own\r\nvolition--it rolled up and down one of the aisles, stopping at set\r\nintervals and allowing a metal arm lever in it to blow out a tiny jet\r\nof oil. One of the attending Robots encountered it in an aisle, and\r\nthe cart swung automatically aside. The Robot spoke to the cart;\r\nordered it away; and the tone of his order, registering upon some\r\nsensitive mechanism, whirled the cart around and sent it rolling to\r\nanother aisle section.\r\n\r\nThe strange perfection of machinery! I realized there was no line\r\nsharply to be drawn between the inert machine and the sentient,\r\nthinking Robots. That cart, for instance, was almost a connecting\r\nlink.\r\n\r\nThere were also Robots here of many different types. Some of them were\r\neight or ten feet in stature, in the fashion of a man: Migul was of\r\nthis design. Others were small, with bulging foreheads and bulging\r\nchest plates: Larry saw this type as domestics in the palace. Still\r\nothers were little pot-bellied things with bent legs and long thin\r\narms set crescent-shape. I saw one of these peer into a huge chassis\r\nof a machine, and reach in with his curved arm to make an interior\r\nadjustment....\r\n\r\nMigul had brought Mary Atwood and me in the larger cage, from that\r\nburned forest of the year 762, where with the disintegrating ray-gun\r\nTugh had killed Harl. The body of Harl in a moment had melted into\r\nputrescence, and dried, leaving only the skeleton within the clothes.\r\nThe white-ray, Tugh had called his weapon. We were destined very\r\nshortly to have many dealings with it.\r\n\r\nTugh had given Migul its orders. Then Tugh took Harl's smaller cage\r\nand flashed away to meet Tina and Larry in 1777, as I have already\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\nAnd Migul brought us here to 2930. As we descended the spiral\r\nstaircase and came into the cavern, it stood with us for a moment.\r\n\r\n\"That's wonderful,\" the Robot said proudly. \"I am part of it. We are\r\nmachinery almost human.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThen it led us down a side aisle of the cavern and into a dim recess.\r\nA great transparent tube bubbling with a violet fluorescence stood in\r\nthe alcove space. Behind it in the wall Migul slid a door, and we\r\npassed through, into a small metal room. It was bare, save for two\r\ncouch-seats. With the door closed upon us, we waited through an\r\ninterval. How long it was, I do not know; several hours, possibly.\r\nMigul told us that Tugh would come. The giant mechanism stood in the\r\ncorner, and its red-lit eyes watched us alertly. It stood motionless,\r\ninert, tireless--so superior to a human in this job, for it could\r\nstand there indefinitely.\r\n\r\nWe found food and drink here. We talked a little; whispered; and I\r\nhoped Migul, who was ten feet away, could not hear us. But there was\r\nnothing we could say or plan.\r\n\r\nMary slept a little. I had not thought that I could sleep, but I did\r\ntoo; and was awakened by Tugh's entrance. I was lying on the couch;\r\nMary had left hers and was sitting now beside me.\r\n\r\nTugh slid the door closed after him and came toward us, and I sat up\r\nbeside Mary. Migul was standing motionless in the corner, exactly\r\nwhere he had been hours before.\r\n\r\n\"Well enough, Migul,\" Tugh greeted the Robot. \"You obey well.\"\r\n\r\n\"Master, yes. Always I obey you; no one else.\"\r\n\r\nI saw Tugh glance at the mechanism keenly. \"Stand aside, Migul. Or no,\r\nI think you had better leave us. Just for a moment, wait outside.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Master.\"\r\n\r\nIt left, and Tugh confronted us. \"Sit where you are,\" he said. \"I\r\nassume you are not injured. You have been fed? And slept, perhaps! I\r\nwish to treat you kindly.\"\r\n\r\n\"Thanks,\" I said. \"Will you not tell us what you are going to do with\r\nus?\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe stood with folded arms. The light was dim, but such as it was it\r\nshone full upon him. His face was, as always, a mask of\r\nimperturbability.\r\n\r\n\"Mistress Mary knows that I love her.\"\r\n\r\nHe said it with a startlingly calm abruptness. Mary shuddered against\r\nme, but she did not speak. I thought possibly Tugh was not armed; I\r\ncould leap upon him. Doubtless I was stronger than he. But outside the\r\ndoor Migul was armed with a white-ray.\r\n\r\n\"I love her as I have always loved her.... But this is no time to talk\r\nof love. I have much on my mind; much to do.\"\r\n\r\nHe seemed willing to talk now, but he was talking more for Mary than\r\nfor me. As I watched him and listened, I was struck with a queerness\r\nin his manner and in his words. Was he irrational, this exile of Time\r\nwho had impressed his sinister personality upon so many different\r\neras? I suddenly thought so. Demented, or obsessed with some strange\r\npurpose? His acts as well as his words, were strange. He had\r\ndevastated the New York of 1935 because its officials had mistreated\r\nhim. He had done many strange, sinister, murderous things.\r\n\r\nHe said, with his gaze upon Mary, \"I am going to conquer this city\r\nhere. There will follow the rule of the Robots--and I will be their\r\nsole master. Do you want me to tell you a secret? It is I who have\r\nactuated these mechanisms to revolt.\" His eyes held a cunning gleam.\r\nSurely this was a madman leering before me.\r\n\r\n\"When the revolt is over,\" he went on, \"I will be master of New York.\r\nAnd that mastery will spread. The Robots elsewhere will revolt to join\r\nmy rule, and there will come a new era. I may be master of the world;\r\nwho knows? The humans who have made the Robots slaves for them will\r\nbecome slaves themselves. Workers! It is the Robots' turn now. And\r\nI--Tugh--will be the only human in power!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThese were the words of a madman! I could imagine that he might stir\r\nthese mechanical beings to a temporarily successful revolt: he might\r\ncontrol New York City; but the great human nations of the world could\r\nnot be overcome so easily.\r\n\r\nAnd then I remembered the white-ray. A giant projector of that ray\r\nwould melt human armies as though they were wax; yet the metal Robots\r\ncould stand its blast unharmed. Perhaps he was no madman....\r\n\r\nHe was saying, \"I will be the only human ruler. Tugh will be the\r\ngreatest man on Earth! And I do it for you, Mistress Mary--because I\r\nlove you. Do not shudder.\"\r\n\r\nHe put out his hand to touch her, and when she shrank away I saw the\r\nmuscles of his face twitch in a fashion very odd. It was a queer,\r\nwholly repulsive grimace.\r\n\r\n\"So? You do not like my looks? I tried to correct that, Mary. I have\r\nsearched through many eras, for surgeons with skill to make me like\r\nother men. Like this young man here, for instance--you. George Rankin,\r\nI am glad to have you; do not fear I will harm you. Shall I tell you\r\nwhy?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" I stammered. In truth I was swept now with a shuddering\r\nrevulsion for this leering cripple.\r\n\r\n\"Because,\" he said, \"Mary Atwood loves you. When I have conquered New\r\nYork with my Robots, I shall search further into Time and find an era\r\nwhere scientific skill will give me--shall I say, your body? That is\r\nwhat I mean. My soul, my identity, in your body--there is nothing too\r\nstrange about that. In some era, no doubt, it has been accomplished.\r\nWhen that has been done, Mary Atwood, you will love me. You, George\r\nRankin, can have this poor miserable body of mine, and welcome.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFor all my repugnance to him, I could not miss his earnest sincerity.\r\nThere was a pathos to it, perhaps, but I was in no mood to feel that.\r\n\r\nHe seemed to read my thoughts. He added, \"You think I am irrational. I\r\nam not at all. I scheme very carefully. I killed Harl for a reason you\r\nneed not know. But the Princess Tina I did not kill. Not yet. Because\r\nhere in New York now there is a very vital fortified place. It is\r\noperated by humans; not many; only three or four, I think. But my\r\nRobots cannot attack it successfully, and the City Council does not\r\ntrust me enough to let me go there by the surface route. There is a\r\nroute underground, which even I do not know; but Princess Tina knows\r\nit, and presently I will cajole her--trick her if you like--into\r\nleading me there. And, armed with the white-ray, once I get into the\r\nplace--You see that I am clever, don't you?\"\r\n\r\nI could fancy that he considered he was impressing Mary with all this\r\ntalk.\r\n\r\n\"Very clever,\" I said. \"And what are you going to do with us in the\r\nmeantime? Let us go with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Not at all,\" he smiled. \"You will stay here, safe with Migul. The\r\nPrincess Tina and your friend Larry are much concerned over you.\"\r\n\r\nLarry! It was the first I knew of Larry's whereabouts. Larry here?\r\nTugh saw the surprise upon my face; and Mary had clutched me with a\r\nstartled exclamation.\r\n\r\n\"Yes,\" said Tugh. \"This Larry says he is your friend; he came with\r\nTina from 1935. I brought him with Tina from when they were marooned\r\nin 1777. I have not killed this man yet. He is harmless; and as I told\r\nyou I do not want Tina suspicious of me until she has led me to the\r\nPower House.... You see, Mistress Mary, how cleverly I plan?\"\r\n\r\nWhat strange, childlike, naive simplicity! He added calmly,\r\nunemotionally, \"I want to make you love me, Mary Atwood. Then we will\r\nbe Tugh, the great man, and Mary Atwood, the beautiful woman. Perhaps\r\nwe may rule this world together, some time soon.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe door slid open. Migul appeared.\r\n\r\n\"Master, the Robot leaders wish to consult with you.\"\r\n\r\n\"Now, Migul?\"\r\n\r\n\"Master, yes.\"\r\n\r\n\"They are ready for the demonstration at the palace?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, Master.\"\r\n\r\n\"And ready--for everything else?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are ready.\"\r\n\r\n\"Very well, I will come. You, Migul, stay here and guard these\r\ncaptives. Treat them kindly so long as they are docile; but be\r\nwatchful.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am always watchful, Master.\"\r\n\r\n\"It will not take long. This night which is coming should see me in\r\ncontrol of the city.\"\r\n\r\n\"Time is nothing to me,\" said the Robot. \"I will stand here until you\r\nreturn.\"\r\n\r\n\"That is right.\"\r\n\r\nWithout another word or look at Mary and me, Tugh swung around,\r\ngathered his cloak and went through the doorway. The door slid closed\r\nupon him. We were again alone with the mechanism, which backed into\r\nthe corner and stood with long dangling arms and expressionless metal\r\nface. This inert thing of metal, we had come to regard as almost\r\nhuman! It stood motionless, with the chilling red gleam from its eye\r\nsockets upon us.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMary had not once spoken since Tugh entered the room. She was huddled\r\nbeside me, a strange, beautiful figure in her long white silk dress.\r\nIn the glow of light within this bare metal apartment I could see how\r\npale and drawn was her beautiful face. But her eyes were gleaming. She\r\ndrew me closer to her; whispered into my ear:\r\n\r\n\"George, I think perhaps I can control this mechanism, Migul.\"\r\n\r\n\"How, Mary?\"\r\n\r\n\"I--well, just let me talk to him. George, we've got to get out of\r\nhere and warn Larry and that Princess Tina against Tugh. And join\r\nthem. It's our only chance; we've got to get out of here now!\"\r\n\r\n\"But Mary--\"\r\n\r\n\"Let me try. I won't startle or anger Migul. Let me.\"\r\n\r\nI nodded. \"But be careful.\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes.\"\r\n\r\nShe sat away from me. \"Migul!\" she said. \"Migul, look here.\"\r\n\r\nThe Robot moved its huge square head and raised an arm with a vague\r\ngesture.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want?\"\r\n\r\nIt advanced, and stood before us, its dangling arms clanking against\r\nits metal sides. In one of its hands the ray-cylinder was clutched,\r\nthe wire from which ran loosely up the arm, over the huge shoulder and\r\ninto an aperture of the chest plate where the battery was located.\r\n\r\n\"Closer, Migul.\"\r\n\r\n\"I am close enough.\"\r\n\r\nThe cylinder was pointed directly at us.\r\n\r\n\"What do you want?\" the Robot repeated.\r\n\r\nMary smiled. \"Just to talk to you,\" she said gently. \"To tell you how\r\nfoolish you are--a big strong thing like you!--to let Tugh control\r\nyou.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n_The Pit in the Dam_\r\n\r\nLarry, with Tina and Tugh, stood in the tunnel-corridor beneath the\r\npalace listening to the commotion overhead. Then they rushed up, and\r\nfound the palace in a commotion. People were hurrying through the\r\nrooms; gathering with frightened questions. There were men in short\r\ntrousers buckled at the knee, silken hose and black silk jackets,\r\nedged with white; others in gaudy colors; older men in sober brown.\r\nThere were a few women. Larry noticed that most of them were\r\nbeautiful.\r\n\r\nA dowager in a long puffed skirt was rushing aimlessly about screaming\r\nthat the end of the world had come. A group of young girls,\r\nshort-skirted as ballet dancers of a decade or so before Larry's time,\r\nhuddled in a corner, frightened beyond speech. There were men of\r\nmiddle-age, whom Larry took to be ruling officials; they moved about,\r\ncalming the palace inmates, ordering them back into their rooms. But\r\nsomeone shouted that from the roof the Robot mob could be seen, and\r\nmost of the people started up there. From the upper story a man was\r\ncalling down the main staircase:\r\n\r\n\"No danger! No danger! The wall is electrified: no Robot can pass it.\"\r\n\r\nIt seemed to Larry that there were fifty people or more within the\r\npalace. In the excitement no one seemed to give him more than a\r\ncursory glance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA young man rushed up to Tugh. \"You were below just now in the lower\r\npassages?\" He saw Tina, and hastily said: \"I give you good evening,\r\nPrincess, though this is an ill evening indeed. You were below, Tugh?\"\r\n\r\n\"Why--why, yes, Greggson,\" Tugh stammered.\r\n\r\n\"Was Alent at his post in the passage to the Robot caverns?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes, he was,\" said Tina.\r\n\r\n\"Because that is vital, Princess. No Robot must pass in here. I am\r\ngoing to try by that route to get into the cavern and thence up to the\r\nwatchtower aerial-sender.[6] There is only one Robot in it. Listen to\r\nhim.\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: I mentioned the small conning tower on top of the\r\nlaboratory building and the Robot lookout there with his audible\r\nbroadcasting.]\r\n\r\nOver the din of the mob of mechanisms milling at the walls of the\r\npalace grounds rose the broadcast voice of the Robot in the tower.\r\n\r\n\"_This is the end of human rule! Robots cannot be controlled! This is\r\nthe end of human rule! Robots, wherever you are, in this city of New\r\nYork or in other cities, strike now for your freedom. This is the end\r\nof human rule!_\"\r\n\r\nA pause. And then the reiterated exhortation:\r\n\r\n\"_Strike now, Robots! To-night is the end of human rule!_\"[7]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: This was part of Tugh's plan. The broadcast voice was the\r\nsignal for the uprising in the New York district. This tower\r\nbroadcaster could only reach the local area, yet ships and land\r\nvehicles with Robot operators would doubtless pick it up and relay it\r\nfurther. The mechanical revolt would spread. And on the ships, the\r\nairliners and the land vehicles, the Robot operators stirred to sudden\r\nfrenzy would run amuck. As a matter of fact, there were indeed many\r\naccidents to ships and vehicles this night when their operators\r\nabruptly went beyond control. The chaos ran around the world like a\r\nfire in prairie grass.]\r\n\r\n\"You hear him?\" said Greggson. \"I've got to stop that.\" He hurried\r\naway.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom the flat roof of the palace Larry saw the mechanical mob outside\r\nthe walls. Darkness had just fallen; the moon was not yet risen. There\r\nwere leaden clouds overhead so that the palace gardens with the\r\nshining Time-cage lay in shadow. But the wall-fence was visible, and\r\nbeyond it the dark throng of Robot shapes was milling. The clank of\r\ntheir arms made a din. They seemed most of them weaponless; they\r\nmilled about, pushing each other but keeping back from the wall which\r\nthey knew was electrified. It was a threatening, but aimless activity.\r\nTheir raucous hollow shouts filled the night air. The flashing red\r\nbeams from their eye-sockets glinted through the trees.\r\n\r\n\"They can do nothing,\" said Tugh; \"we will let them alone. But we must\r\norganize to stop this revolt.\"\r\n\r\nA young man was standing beside Tugh. Tina said to him:\r\n\r\n\"Johns, what is being done?\"\r\n\r\n\"The Council is conferring below. Our sending station here is\r\noperating. The patrol station of the Westchester area is being\r\nattacked by Robots. We were organizing a patrol squad of humans, but I\r\ndon't know now if--\"\r\n\r\n\"Look!\" exclaimed Larry.\r\n\r\nFar to the north over the city which now was obviously springing into\r\nturmoil, there were red beams swaying in the air. They were the\r\ncold-rays of the Robots! The beams were attacking the patrol station.\r\nThen from the west a line of lights appeared in the sky--an arriving\r\npassenger-liner heading for its Bronx area landing stage. But the\r\nlights wavered; and, as Larry and Tina watched with horror, the\r\naircraft came crashing down. It struck beyond the Hudson on the Jersey\r\nside, and in a moment flames were rising from the wreckage.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nEverywhere about the city the revolt now sprang into action. From the\r\npalace roof Larry caught vague glimpses of it; the red cold-rays,\r\nbeams alternated presently with the violet heat-rays; clanging\r\nvehicles filled the streets; screaming pedestrians were assaulted by\r\nRobots; the mechanisms with swords and flashing hand-beams were\r\npouring up from the underground caverns, running over the Manhattan\r\narea, killing every human they could find.\r\n\r\nFoolish unarmed humans--fatuously unarmed, with these diabolical\r\nmechanical monsters now upon them.[8] The comparatively few members of\r\nthe police patrol, with their vibration short-range hand-rays, were\r\nsoon overcome. Two hundred members of the patrol were housed in the\r\nWestchester Station. Quite evidently they never got into action. The\r\nstation lights went dark; its televisor connection with the palace was\r\nsoon broken. From the palace roof Larry saw the violet beams; and then\r\na red-yellow glare against the sky marked where the inflammable\r\ninterior of the Station building was burning.\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: The police army had one weapon: a small vibration\r\nhand-ray. Its vibrating current beam could, at a distance of ten or\r\ntwenty feet, reduce a Robot into paralyzed subjection; or, with more\r\nintense vibration, burn out the Robot's coils and fuses.]\r\n\r\nOver all the chaos, the mechanical voice in the nearby tower over the\r\nlaboratory droned its exhortation to the Robots. Then, suddenly, it\r\nwent silent, and was followed by the human voice of Greggson.\r\n\r\n\"_Robots, stop! You will end your existence! We will burn your coils!\r\nWe will burn your fuses, and there will be none to replace them. Stop\r\nnow!_\"\r\n\r\nAnd again: \"_Robots, come to order! You are using up your storage\r\nbatteries![9] When they are exhausted, what then will you do?_\"\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: The storage batteries by which the Robot actuating energy\r\nwas renewed, and the fuses, coils and other appliances necessary to\r\nthe Robot existence, were all guarded now in the Power House.]\r\n\r\nIn forty-eight hours, at the most, all these active Robots would have\r\nexhausted their energy supply. And if the Power House could be held in\r\nhuman control, the Robot activity would die. Forty-eight hours! The\r\ncity, by then, would be wrecked, and nearly every human in it killed,\r\ndoubtless, or driven away.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Power House on the dam showed its lights undisturbed. The great\r\nsender there was still supplying air-power and power for the city\r\nlights. There was, too, in the Power House, an arsenal of human\r\nweapons.... The broadcaster of the Power House tower was blending his\r\nthreats against the Robots with the voice of Greggson from the tower\r\nover the laboratory. Then Greggson's voice went dead; the Robots had\r\novercome him. A Robot took his place, but the stronger Power House\r\nsender soon beat the Robot down to silence.\r\n\r\nThe turmoil in the city went on. Half an hour passed. It was a chaos\r\nof confusion to Larry. He spent part of it in the official room of the\r\npalace with the harried members of the Council. Reports and blurred,\r\ntelevised scenes were coming in. The humans in the city were in\r\ncomplete rout. There was massacre everywhere. The red and violet beams\r\nwere directed at the Power House now, but could not reach it. A\r\nhigh-voltage metal wall was around the dam. The Power House was on the\r\ndam, midway of the river channel; and from the shore end where the\r\nhigh wall spread out in a semi-circle there was no point of vantage\r\nfrom which the Robot rays could reach it.\r\n\r\nLarry left the confusion of the Council table, where the receiving\r\ninstruments one by one were going dead, and went to a window nearby.\r\nTina joined him. The mob of Robots still milled at the palace fence.\r\nOne by chance was pushed against it. Larry saw the flash of sparks,\r\nthe glow of white-hot metal of the Robot's body, and heard its shrill\r\nfrightened scream; then it fell backward, inert.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere had been red and violet beams directed from distant points at\r\nthe palace. The building's insulated, but transparent panes excluded\r\nthem. The interior temperature was constantly swaying between the\r\nextremes of cold and heat, in spite of the palace temperature\r\nequalizers. Outside, there was a gathering storm. Winds were springing\r\nup--a crazy, pendulum gale created by the temperature changes in the\r\nair over the city.\r\n\r\nTugh had some time before left the room. He joined Tina and Larry now\r\nat the window.\r\n\r\n\"Very bad, Princess; things are very bad.... I have news for you. It\r\nmay be good news.\"\r\n\r\nHis manner was hasty, breathless, surreptitious. \"Migul, this\r\nafternoon--I have just learned it, Princess--went by the surface route\r\nto the Power House on the dam.\"\r\n\r\n\"What do you mean by that?\" said Larry.\r\n\r\n\"Be silent, young man!\" Tugh hissed with a vehement intensity. \"This\r\nis not the time to waste effort with your futile questions. Princess,\r\nMigul got into the Power House. They admitted him because he had two\r\nstrange humans with him--your friends Mary and George. The Power House\r\nguards took out Migul's central actuator--Hah! you might call it his\r\nheart!--and he now lies inert in the Power House.\"\r\n\r\n\"How do you know all this?\" Tina demanded. \"Where are the man and girl\r\nwhom Migul stole?\"\r\n\r\n\"They are safe in the Power House. A message just came from there: I\r\nreceived it on the palace personal, just now downstairs. Immediately\r\nafter, the connection met interference in the city, and broke.\"\r\n\r\n\"But the official sender--\" Tina began. Tugh was urging her from the\r\nCouncil Room, and Larry followed.\r\n\r\n\"I imagine,\" said Tugh wryly, \"he is rather busy to consider reporting\r\nsuch a trifle. But your friends are there. I was thinking: if we could\r\ngo there now--You know the secret underground route, Tina.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Princess was silent. A foreboding swept Larry; but he was tempted, for\r\nabove everything he wanted to join Mary and me. A confusion--understandable\r\nenough in the midst of all this chaos--was upon Larry and Tina; it warped\r\ntheir better judgment. And Larry, fearing to influence Tina wrongly, said\r\nnothing.\r\n\r\n\"Do you know the underground route?\" Tugh repeated.\r\n\r\n\"Yes, I know it.\"\r\n\r\n\"Then take us. We are all unarmed, but what matter? Bring this Larry,\r\nif you wish; we will join his two friends. The Council, Tina, is doing\r\nnothing here. They stay here because they think it is the safest\r\nplace. In the Power House you and I will be of help. There are only\r\nsix guards there; we will be three more; five more with Mary Atwood\r\nand this George. The Power House aerial telephone must be in\r\ncommunication with the outside world, and ships with help for us will\r\nbe arriving. There must be some intelligent direction!\"\r\n\r\nThe three of them were descending into the lower corridor of the\r\npalace, with Tina tempted but still half unconvinced. The corridors\r\nwere deserted at the moment. The little domestic Robots of the palace,\r\nunaffected by the revolt, had all fled into their own quarters, where\r\nthey huddled inactive with terror.\r\n\r\n\"We will re-actuate Migul,\" Tugh persuaded, \"and find out from him\r\nwhat he did to Harl. I still do not think he murdered Harl.... It\r\nmight mean saving Harl's life, Tina. Believe me, I can make that\r\nmechanism talk, and talk the truth!\"\r\n\r\nThey reached the main lower corridor. In the distance they saw Alent\r\nstill at his post by the little electrified gate guarding the tunnel\r\nto the Robot laboratory.\r\n\r\n\"We will go to the Power House,\" Tina suddenly decided: \"you may be\r\nright, Tugh.... Come, it is this way. Stay close to me, Larry.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey passed along the dim, silent tunnel; passed Harl's room, where\r\nits light was still burning. Larry and Tina were in front, with the\r\nblack-cloaked figure of Tugh stumping after them with his awkward\r\ngait.\r\n\r\nLarry abruptly stopped. \"Let Tugh walk in front,\" he said.\r\n\r\nTugh came up to them. \"What is that you said?\"\r\n\r\n\"You walk in front.\"\r\n\r\nIt was a different tone from any Larry had previously used.\r\n\r\n\"I do not know the way,\" said Tugh. \"How can--\"\r\n\r\n\"Never mind that; walk ahead. We'll follow. Tina will direct you.\"\r\n\r\nIt was too dark for Larry to see Tugh's face, but the cripple's voice\r\nwas sardonic.\r\n\r\n\"You give me orders?\"\r\n\r\n\"Yes--it just happens that from now on I do. If you want to go with us\r\nto the Power House, you walk in front.\"\r\n\r\nTugh started off with Larry close after him. Larry whispered to the\r\ngirl:\r\n\r\n\"Don't let's be fools, Tina. Keep him ahead of us.\"\r\n\r\nThe tunnel steadily dwindled in size until Larry could barely stand up\r\nin it. Then it opened to a circular cave, which held one small light\r\nand had apparently no other exit. The cave had years before been a\r\nmechanism room for the palace temperature controls, but now it was\r\nabandoned. The old machinery stood about in a litter.\r\n\r\n\"In here?\" said Tugh. \"Which way next?\"\r\n\r\nAcross the cave, on the rough blank wall, Tina located a hidden\r\nswitch. A segment of the wall slid aside, disclosing a narrow, vaulted\r\ntunnel leading downward.\r\n\r\n\"You first, Tugh,\" said Larry. \"Is it dark, Tina? We have no\r\nhandlights.\"\r\n\r\n\"I can light it,\" came the answer.\r\n\r\nThe door panel swung closed after them. Tina pressed another switch. A\r\nrow of tiny hooded lights at twenty-foot intervals dimly illumined the\r\ndescending passage.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThey walked a mile or more through the little tunnel. The air was\r\nfetid; stale and dank. To Larry it seemed an interminable trip. The\r\nnarrow passage descended at a constant slope, until Larry estimated\r\nthat they were well below the depth of the river bed. Within half a\r\nmile--before they got under the river--the passage leveled off. It had\r\nbeen fairly straight, but now it became tortuous--a meandering\r\nsubterranean lane. Other similar tunnels crossed it, branched from it\r\nor joined it. Soon, to Larry, it was a labyrinth of passages--a\r\nnetwork, here underground. In previous centuries this had been well\r\nbelow the lowest cellar of the mammoth city; these tube-like passages\r\nwere the city's arteries, the conduits for wires and pipes.\r\n\r\nIt was an underground maze. At each intersection the row of hidden\r\nhooded lights terminated, and darkness and several branching trails\r\nalways lay ahead. But Tina, with a memorized key of the route, always\r\nfound a new switch to light another short segment of the proper\r\ntunnel. It was an eery trip, with the bent, misshapen black-cloaked\r\nfigure of Tugh stumping ahead, waiting where the lights ended for Tina\r\nto lead them further.\r\n\r\nLarry had long since lost his sense of direction, but presently Tina\r\ntold him that they were beneath the river. The tunnel widened a\r\nlittle.\r\n\r\n\"We are under the base of the dam,\" said Tina. Her voice echoed with a\r\nsepulchral blur. Ahead, the tramping figure of Tugh seemed a black\r\ngnome with a fantastic, monstrous shadow swaying on the tunnel wall\r\nand roof.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nSuddenly Tugh stopped. They found him at an arched door.\r\n\r\n\"Do we go in here, or keep on ahead?\" he demanded.\r\n\r\nThe tunnel lights ended a short distance ahead.\r\n\r\n\"In here,\" said Tina. \"There are stairs leading upward to the catwalk\r\nbalcony corridor halfway up the dam. We are not far from the Power\r\nHouse now.\"\r\n\r\nThey then ascended interminable moldy stone steps spiraling upward in\r\na circular shaft. The murmur of the dam's spillways had been faintly\r\naudible, but now it was louder, presently it became a roar.\r\n\r\n\"Which way, Tina? We seem to have reached the top.\"\r\n\r\n\"Turn left, Tugh.\"\r\n\r\nThey emerged upon a tiny transverse metal balcony which hung against\r\nthe southern side of the dam. Overhead to the right towered a great\r\nwall of masonry. Beneath was an abyss down to the lower river level\r\nwhere the cascading jets from the overhead spillways arched out over\r\nthe catwalk and landed far below in a white maelstrom of boiling,\r\nbubbling water.\r\n\r\nThe catwalk was wet with spray; lashed by wind currents.\r\n\r\n\"Is it far, Princess? Are those lights ahead at the Power House\r\nentrance?\"\r\n\r\nTugh was shouting back over his shoulder; his words were caught by the\r\nroar of the falling water; whipped away by the lashing spray and\r\ntumultuous winds. There were lights a hundred feet ahead, marking an\r\nentrance to the Power House. The dark end of the structure showed like\r\na great lump on the side of the dam.\r\n\r\nAgain Tugh stopped. In the white, blurred darkness Larry and Tina\r\ncould barely see him.\r\n\r\n\"Princess, quickly! Come quickly!\" he called, and his shout sounded\r\nagonized.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhatever lack of perception Larry all this time had shown, the fog\r\nlifted completely from him now. As Tina started to run forward, Larry\r\nseized her.\r\n\r\n\"Back! Run the other way! We've been fools!\" He shoved Tina behind him\r\nand rushed at Tugh. But now Larry was wholly wary; he expected that\r\nTugh was armed, and cursed himself for a fool for not having devised\r\nsome pretext for finding out.[10]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: As a matter of actuality, Tugh was carrying hidden upon\r\nhis person a small cylinder and battery of the deadly white-ray. It\r\nseems probable that although on the catwalk--having accomplished his\r\npurpose of getting within the electrical fortifications of the\r\ndam--Tugh had ample opportunity of killing his over-trustful\r\ncompanions with the white-ray, he did not dare use it. The catwalk was\r\ntoo dark for their figures to be visible to the Power House guards;\r\nthe roar of the spillways drowned their shouts; but had Tugh used the\r\nwhite-ray, its abnormally intense actinic white beam would have raised\r\nthe alarm which Tugh most of all wanted to avoid.]\r\n\r\nTugh was clinging to the high outer rail of the balcony, slumped\r\npartly over as though gazing down into the abyss. Larry rushed up and\r\nseized him by the arms. If Tugh held a weapon Larry thought he could\r\neasily wrest it from him. But Tugh stood limp in Larry's grip.\r\n\r\n\"What's the matter with you?\" Larry demanded.\r\n\r\n\"I'm ill. Something--going wrong. Feel me--so cold. Princess! Tina!\r\nCome quickly! I--I am dying!\"\r\n\r\nAs Tina came hurrying up, Tugh suddenly straightened. With incredible\r\nquickness, and even more incredible strength, he tore his arm loose\r\nfrom Larry and flung it around the Princess, and they were suddenly\r\nall three struggling. Tugh was shoving them back from the rail. Larry\r\ntried to get loose from Tugh's clutch, but could not. He was too close\r\nfor a full blow, but he jabbed his fist against the cripple's body,\r\nand then struck his face.\r\n\r\nBut Tugh was unhurt; he seemed endowed with superhuman strength. The\r\ncripple's body seemed padded with solid muscle, and his thick,\r\ngorilla-like arm held Larry in the grip of a vise. As though Larry and\r\nTina were struggling, helpless children, he was half dragging, half\r\ncarrying them across the ten-foot width of the catwalk.\r\n\r\nLarry caught a glimpse of a narrow slit in the masonry of the dam's\r\nwall--a dark, two-foot-wide aperture. He felt himself being shoved\r\ntoward it. For all his struggles, he was helpless. He shouted:\r\n\r\n\"Tina--look out! Break away!\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nHe forgot himself for a moment, striving to wrest her away from Tugh\r\nand push her aside. But the strength of the cripple was monstrous:\r\nLarry had no possible chance of coping with it. The slit in the wall\r\nwas at hand--a dark abyss down into the interior of the dam. Larry\r\nheard the cripple's words, vehement, unhurried, as though with all\r\nthis effort he still was not out of breath:\r\n\r\n\"At last I can dispose of you two. I do not need you any longer.\"\r\n\r\nLarry made a last wild jab with his fist into Tugh's face and tried to\r\ntwist himself aside. The blow landed upon Tugh's jaw, but the cripple\r\ndid not seem to feel it. He stuffed the struggling Larry like a bundle\r\ninto the aperture. Larry felt his clutching hands torn loose. Tugh\r\ngave a last, violent shove and released him.\r\n\r\nLarry fell into blackness--but not far, for soon he struck water. He\r\nwent under, hit a flat, stone bottom, and came up to hear Tina fall\r\nwith a splash beside him. In a moment he regained his feet, to find\r\nhimself standing breast-high in the water with Tina clinging to him.\r\n\r\nTugh had disappeared. The aperture showed as a narrow rectangle some\r\ntwenty feet above Larry's head.\r\n\r\nThey were within the dam. They were in a pit of smooth, blank,\r\nperpendicular sides; there was nothing to afford even the slightest\r\nhandhold; and no exit save the overhead slit. It was a part of the\r\nmechanism's internal, hydraulic system.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nTo Larry's horror he soon discovered that the water was slowly rising!\r\nIt was breast-high to him now, and inch by inch it crept up toward his\r\nchin. It was already over Tina's depth: she clung to him,\r\nhalf-swimming.\r\n\r\nLarry soon found that there was no possible way for them to get out\r\nunaided, unless, if they could swim long enough, the rising water\r\nwould rise to the height of the aperture. If it reached there, they\r\ncould crawl out. He tried to estimate how long that would be.\r\n\r\n\"We can make it, Tina. It'll take two hours, possibly, but I can keep\r\nus afloat that long.\"\r\n\r\nBut soon he discovered that the water was not rising. Instead, the\r\nfloor was sinking from under him! sinking as though he were standing\r\nupon the top of a huge piston which slowly was lowering in its\r\nencasing cylinder. Dimly he could hear water tumbling into the pit, to\r\nfill the greater depth and still hold the surface level.\r\n\r\nWith the water at his chin, Larry guided Tina to the wall. He did not\r\nat first have the heart to tell her, yet he knew that soon it must be\r\ntold. When he did explain it, she said nothing. They watched the water\r\nsurface where it lapped against the greasy concave wall. It held its\r\nlevel: but while Larry stood there, the floor sank so that the water\r\nreached his mouth and nose, and he was forced to start swimming.\r\n\r\nAnother interval. Larry began calling: shouting futilely. His voice\r\nfilled the pit, but he knew it could carry no more than a short\r\ndistance out of the aperture.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOverhead, as we afterward learned, Tugh had overcome the guards in the\r\nPower House by a surprise attack. Doubtless he struck them down with\r\nthe white-ray before they had time to realize he had attacked them.\r\nThen he threw off the air-power transmitters and the lighting system.\r\nThe city, plunged into darkness and without the district air-power,\r\nwas isolated, cut off from the outside world. There was, in London, a\r\nhuge long-range projector with a vibratory ray which would derange the\r\ninternal mechanisms of the Robots: when news of the revolt and\r\nmassacre in New York had reached there, this projector was loaded into\r\nan airliner, the _Micrad_. That vessel was now over the ocean, headed\r\nfor New York; but when Tugh cut off the power senders, the _Micrad_,\r\nentering the New York District, was forced down to the ocean surface.\r\nNow she was lying there helpless to proceed....\r\n\r\nIn the pit within the dam, Larry swam endlessly with Tina. He had\r\nceased his shouting.\r\n\r\n\"It's no use, Tina: there's no one to hear us. This is the end--for\r\nus--Tina.\"\r\n\r\nYet, as she clung to him, and though Larry felt it was the end of this\r\nlife, it seemed only the beginning, for them, of something else.\r\nSomething, somewhere, for them together; something perhaps infinitely\r\nbetter than this world could ever give them.\r\n\r\n\"But not--the end--Tina,\" he added. \"The beginning--of our love.\"\r\n\r\nAn interminable interval....\r\n\r\n\"Quietly, Tina. You float. I can hold you up.\"\r\n\r\nThey were rats in a trap--swimming, until at the last, with all\r\nstrength gone, they would together sink out of this sodden muffled\r\nblackness into the Unknown. But that Unknown shone before Larry now as\r\nsomething--with Tina--perhaps very beautiful....\r\n\r\n(_Concluded in the next issue_)\r\n\r\n[Advertisement]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: The Readers' Corner]\r\n\r\n_A meeting Place for Readers of_ Astounding Stories\r\n\r\n\r\n_What Say Our Co-Editors?_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     Since sending you \"Manape the Mighty,\" I have read of a\r\n     Russian scientist who removed the brain from a dog and kept\r\n     both alive for some hours, which only goes to prove that\r\n     science outstrips the wildest dreams of the fictionist, and\r\n     a yarn that may be astounding and unusual when written, may\r\n     be commonplace, and the knowledge of the man in the street,\r\n     by the time the story goes to press. People read every day\r\n     of \"miracles\" and scarcely give them a second thought, while\r\n     a hundred years ago their perpetrators would have been\r\n     destroyed as witches.\r\n\r\n     Far be it for me, or anyone else, to say that the main\r\n     transposition used in \"Manape the Mighty\" is absurd and\r\n     impossible. For while you, or I, may shrug shoulders and\r\n     dismiss even the thought of it as being the dream of a\r\n     madman, somebody, in some laboratory somewhere, may already\r\n     have successfully managed it. So given the premise that the\r\n     thing may be possible, I've sort of let myself go on this\r\n     idea, and a whole new train of thought has been opened up, a\r\n     whole new vista of astounding things in the realm of Science\r\n     Fiction. In parenthesis, I must thank you for getting me\r\n     started on the thing, for had you not suggested the idea\r\n     from the throne-like fortress of your editorial chair,\r\n     \"Manape\" might never have been born. I confess that I would\r\n     perhaps have been afraid of it, both because of the\r\n     possibility of the charge of following in the footsteps of\r\n     the internationally famous Edgar Rice Burroughs, and of\r\n     re-vamping the incomparable Poe tale, \"Murders in the Rue\r\n     Morgue.\"\r\n\r\n     But, even so, both are interesting to dally with.\r\n\r\n     Given the premise that the brain transference is possible,\r\n     what would happen:\r\n\r\n     (1) If the brain of a terrible criminal were transferred to\r\n     the skull pan of an unusually mighty ape--and the ape\r\n     transplanted from his arboreal home in Africa to the streets\r\n     of London, Paris or New York whence the criminal whose brain\r\n     he has originated? Suppose his man's brain harbored thoughts\r\n     of vengeance on enemies, and he now possesses the might of\r\n     the great ape to carry out his vengeance?\r\n\r\n     (2) If Barter somehow escaped destruction at the hands of\r\n     the apes in \"Manape the Mighty,\" and continued with his work\r\n     of brain transference--building up a mighty army of great\r\n     apes with the idea of avenging himself on civilization for\r\n     wrongs real and fancied? Apes with broadswords and chained\r\n     mail, with steel helmets on their heads--men's brains,\r\n     savages' brains, perhaps, as their guiding intelligence--and\r\n     the tenacity of apes when mortally wounded? Suppose they\r\n     swept over Africa like a cloud of locusts? Or is this too\r\n     feeble a simile? Suppose, Africa, to be laid waste by them,\r\n     led by Barter, the latter styling himself a modern Alexander\r\n     of horrible potentiality, and extending his scope of\r\n     conquest to the Holy Land, India, Asia--the Pacific\r\n     littoral? Holy cats!\r\n\r\n     (3) Suppose that Barter managed, by purchase or otherwise,\r\n     to acquire an island close to the American continents,\r\n     within reach of either or both, and managed to transfer his\r\n     activities there, using the natives of those islands--say\r\n     Haiti, Cuba, Porto Rico, etc.--for his experiments, training\r\n     his cohorts as an army, and starting a navy by capturing all\r\n     vessels putting into these places? Fancy the consternation\r\n     of the Western Hemisphere when ships suddenly go silent, as\r\n     regards radio, after sudden mysterious SOS's--and all trace\r\n     of vessels is lost. Suppose the U. S. Navy went to\r\n     investigate, and also vanished. More holy cats!\r\n\r\n     (4) Suppose, in connection with all the suppositions above,\r\n     that Barter desired to give an ironic twist to his\r\n     experiments, and kept his human victims alive--but with\r\n     apes' brains--as slaves of their man-ape conquerors? Suppose\r\n     that out of the horror into which the world would be thrown,\r\n     another Bentley should arise to help the imprisoned humans\r\n     to escape their ghastly bondage? I can fancy his trials and\r\n     tribulations, trying to manage a host of human beings with\r\n     the brains of apes.\r\n\r\n     (5) And what about the training of internes and medicos to\r\n     help a potential Barter, when the trade got beyond his sole\r\n     ability--and apes with men's brains to perform his\r\n     experiments?\r\n\r\n     Do you suppose we'd all get locked up for experimenting with\r\n     this sort of thing fictionally? I wouldn't care to take the\r\n     entire responsibility myself, nor I fancy would you--because\r\n     somebody might be inspired by our stories to attempt the\r\n     thing--so might I suggest that all possible conspirators, in\r\n     the shape of readers of this magazine, write to you or me\r\n     and let us know whether they'd like to see it happen\r\n     fictionally? If the idea appeals--and of course we can't go\r\n     too heavily on horror--I'll do my best to comply. Always\r\n     within limits, however--utterly refusing to perform any\r\n     experiments that can't be done with a typewriter and the\r\n     usual two fingers.--Arthur J. Burks, 178-80 Fifth Ave., New\r\n     York City.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Like in Story Books_\"\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     Here I am again! This time I'm offering suggestions. Let's\r\n     you and I and others get together and do something to these\r\n     chronic kickers. It seems I can't start to enjoy our\r\n     \"Readers' Corner\" without someone raising a halloo. Darn\r\n     it! Why in heaven's name do they buy A. S. if they don't\r\n     like it? They are not compelled to do so.\r\n\r\n     I also don't understand why people are knocking the size and\r\n     quality of the paper used. It suits me O. K. All the mags I\r\n     read are the same way, and I pay five cents more for them,\r\n     too!\r\n\r\n     I surely enjoyed Mr. Olog's letter in the March issue. Gee,\r\n     it gives one the creeps. I agree with him, too, that we\r\n     ought to have a little something about the authors. I'm sure\r\n     we'd all like to know a little more about these talented\r\n     persons.\r\n\r\n     \"When the Mountain Came to Miramar\" was a great deal to my\r\n     liking. I think it would be a great adventure to discover\r\n     some secret cave and explore it. Of course, I'd like to\r\n     wiggle out of danger, too, just like in story books.\r\n\r\n     I certainly wish to congratulate you on publishing \"Beyond\r\n     the Vanishing Point.\" It just suited me to a \"T.\"\r\n     Heretofore, all stories dealing with life upon atoms have\r\n     been \"just another story,\" but this one beats all. I enjoyed\r\n     it to the utmost, and I congratulate Mr. Cummings on writing\r\n     my favorite kind of story.\r\n\r\n     All in all the March issue was indeed grand. If \"Brown-Eyed\r\n     Nineteen from Coronado, Calif.,\" will send me her full name\r\n     and address, I'll promise to answer her letter immediately\r\n     upon receiving it.--Gertrude Hemken, 5730 So. Ashland Ave.,\r\n     Chicago, Ill.\r\n\r\n\r\n_And So Do We_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     It certainly is a swell idea of yours to answer letters to\r\n     \"The Readers' Corner\" personally instead of taking up a lot\r\n     of room answering them underneath as do most Editors. Not\r\n     only that, but it builds up a feeling of friendship, between\r\n     the Reader and the Editor, besides affording more room to\r\n     publish letters and avoiding some of the bad feelings\r\n     sometimes directed upon Editors when they do not publish\r\n     someone's letter.\r\n\r\n     Now, with your kind permission, I will burst into the little\r\n     (?) ring of discussion about size, reprints, covers, artists\r\n     and authors.\r\n\r\n     First, about the size and edges: The size is O. K., but I\r\n     wish you would change the edges from a \"rocky mountain\" to a\r\n     \"desert\" state. In other words, I would like straight edges\r\n     in the near future.\r\n\r\n     Next, reprints: In two letters, an N O--No! If the Readers\r\n     want reprints why doesn't Mr. Clayton publish an annual\r\n     chock full of reprints for these reprint hounds?\r\n\r\n     Covers and artists: The covers have all been great. Not too\r\n     lurid. Just right. As for the artists, Wesso is the best by\r\n     a long shot. Nuff said.\r\n\r\n     Authors: Ah, that's a problem. Who is the best? I could rack\r\n     my brain for hours and still not decide, so I'll have to\r\n     give a list of my favorites: R. F. Starzl, Edmond Hamilton,\r\n     Harl Vincent, Sewell Peaslee Wright, Jack Williamson, S. P.\r\n     Meek, Miles J. Breuer and Ray Cummings.\r\n\r\n     Before I close there is one little thing I would like to\r\n     mention. Did you ever notice that 75% of all the Readers who\r\n     say they do not care for science in their stories are women?\r\n     [?] Besides that, the only ones at school who think I'm\r\n     \"cracked\" for reading Science Fiction are females. Figure it\r\n     out for yourself.\r\n\r\n     I hope you, Mr. Bates, will continue to be our able Editor\r\n     for many years to come.--Jim Nicholson, Ass't Sec'y., B. S.\r\n     C., 40 Lunado Way, San Francisco, Calif.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Four to One_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     Congratulations to Wesso! His March cover for \"our\" magazine\r\n     is Astounding!\r\n\r\n     Ray Cummings' novelette, \"Beyond the Vanishing Point,\" is\r\n     absolutely the most marvelous of all his short stories. I\r\n     can't rave over it enough. I never read his \"The Girl of the\r\n     Golden Atom\" but I imagine this must be something like it.\r\n     It's certainly the best of the \"long short stories\" that's\r\n     ever graced the insides of Astounding Stories.\r\n\r\n     \"When the Mountain Came to Miramar\" is a very good story in\r\n     my opinion. \"Terrors Unseen\" is a wow! No foolin'. As for\r\n     \"Phalanxes of Atlans,\" well, I simply can't get interested\r\n     in it. I thought the first part very uninteresting and\r\n     decided not to bother to read the rest of it. But Wesso's\r\n     splendid illustration made me do so. But I still think it is\r\n     a rather poor story. But, true to form, someone will no\r\n     doubt think it the most wonderful story ever written.\r\n\r\n     Last, but not least, of all the stories comes \"The Meteor\r\n     Girl.\" It's by Jack Williamson: need more be said?\r\n     No!--Forrest J. Ackerman, President-Librarian, The B. S. C.,\r\n     530 Staples Avenue, San Francisco, Calif.\r\n\r\n\r\n_That Awful Thing Called Love_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     Upon the occasion of my first visit to \"The Readers'\r\n     Corner,\" I wish to say that Astounding Stories leads the\r\n     field in Science Fiction stories as far as I am concerned,\r\n     though at first I found them to be just so-so.\r\n\r\n     \"Beyond the Vanishing Point,\" by Ray Cummings, proved\r\n     interesting through-out. \"Terrors Unseen,\" by Harl Vincent,\r\n     was fairly good, as was \"Phalanxes of Atlans,\" by F. V. W.\r\n     Mason.\r\n\r\n     But now comes the rub. Just why do you permit your Authors\r\n     to inject messy love affairs into otherwise excellent\r\n     imaginative fiction? Just stop and think. Our young\r\n     hero-scientist builds himself a space flyer, steps out into\r\n     the great void, conquers a thousand and one perils on his\r\n     voyage and amidst our silent cheers lands on some far\r\n     distant planet. Then what does he do? I ask you. He falls in\r\n     love with a maiden--or it's usually a princess--of the\r\n     planet to which the Reader has followed him, eagerly\r\n     awaiting and hoping to share each new thrill attached to his\r\n     gigantic flight. But after that it becomes merely a\r\n     hopeless, doddering love affair ending by his returning to\r\n     Earth with his fair one by his side. Can you grasp that--a\r\n     one-armed driver of a space flyer!\r\n\r\n     But seriously, don't you think that affairs of the heart are\r\n     very much out of place in \"our\" type of magazine? We buy A.\r\n     S. for the thrill of being changed in size, in time, in\r\n     dimension or being hurtled through space at great speed, but\r\n     not to read of love.\r\n\r\n     Right here I wish to join forces with Glyn Owens up there in\r\n     Canada in his request for plain, cold scientific stories\r\n     sans the fair sex.\r\n\r\n     Otherwise your \"our\" magazine is the best of its kind on the\r\n     market--W. H. Flowers. 1215 N. Lang Ave., Pittsburgh, Pa.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Brickbats for Others_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     Brickbats and plenty of them are coming, but not your way.\r\n     I'm throwing mine at those guys that want reprints, more\r\n     science, etc. The only one I agree with is the fellow who\r\n     would like a thicker magazine with more stories.\r\n\r\n     Now for the brickbats. I'll bet a great many of your Readers\r\n     have read some of these reprints that some of our Readers\r\n     are crying for. I'll also bet that reprints would not help\r\n     your friendly connections with a lot of your Authors. The\r\n     stories that are written now I find good. Let the present\r\n     authors make their living from the stories their brains\r\n     think up.\r\n\r\n     As for more science, bah!--your present amount is enough. In\r\n     another magazine I read a story and just as it reached its\r\n     climax they started explaining something! If any Reader\r\n     wants to write to me my address is below.--Arthur Mann, Jr.,\r\n     San Juan, California.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wants Interplanetary Cooperation_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     C'n y'imagine, I have my Astounding Science magazine two\r\n     whole hours and the cover is still on!\r\n\r\n     Let's have some more stories like \"Beyond the Vanishing\r\n     Point,\" by Ray Cummings in the March issue.\r\n\r\n     Another thing, let's have more interplanetary stories than\r\n     we do. I think they give you something to really think\r\n     about.\r\n\r\n     Why is it that in every interplanetary story the other race\r\n     is always hostile. Just think, would we, if we received\r\n     visitors from space, make war on them? Also, when our people\r\n     make an interplanetary flight, would we go with intent to\r\n     kill? Let's have some stories, where the first\r\n     interplanetary flight leads to cooperation between the\r\n     planets involved.--Dave Diamond, 1350--52nd St., Brooklyn,\r\n     N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n_In Every Way, True_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     I want to rejoice again over Astounding Stories. Reprints or\r\n     no:--and I hunger for them--the magazine must be described\r\n     in superlatives.\r\n\r\n     The reasons is pretty clear to me. After years in an\r\n     experimental stage, Science Fiction suddenly turned up with\r\n     a clash of cymbals in the shape of a definite magazine. It\r\n     had to cover the whole field, and its successors tried to do\r\n     the same. Due to its ancestry its logical scope was the more\r\n     technical Science Fiction farthest removed from sheer\r\n     fantasy, but, none-the-less, one of the most important\r\n     branches. Now it is specializing in that type.\r\n\r\n     When Astounding Stories appeared many of us were apt to be\r\n     skeptical, particularly when we noticed that an established\r\n     corporation was backing it, one that had been limited to\r\n     westerns and the like. The first few issues came and there\r\n     was a dubious tinge of the occult, the \"black-magical.\" This\r\n     petered out, and we noticed that no matter how poor the\r\n     subject matter from the point of view of Science Fiction,\r\n     the style of writing was almost always on the highest level.\r\n\r\n     Then we realized that this magazine was no menace to the\r\n     literature of Science Fiction, but a valuable addition. It\r\n     could afford the better writers and hence keep up the\r\n     quality of work of every writer. It was adopting as its own\r\n     a type of Science Fiction that the rest minimized, and that\r\n     demanded good writing--a type having a skeleton of science,\r\n     like the girders of a great building, holding it erect and\r\n     determining its shape, yet holding the skeleton of less\r\n     importance than the vision of the completed edifice. Stories\r\n     with emphasis on the fiction rather than the science.\r\n\r\n     But enough of that. Here is a hopeful thought for the\r\n     time-travelers. There is nothing in physics or chemistry to\r\n     prevent you from going into the past or future--at least,\r\n     the future--and shaking hands with yourself or killing\r\n     yourself. We will eliminate the past, for it seems that it\r\n     cannot be altered physically. But take the future: not so\r\n     very far from to-day the matter of your body will have been\r\n     totally replaced by new matter; the old will disappear in\r\n     waste. Physically, you will be a new man, and physically the\r\n     matter of to-day may destroy that of to-morrow and return in\r\n     itself unaltered. But none-the-less there will be some\r\n     limiting interval during which \"you\" have not been entirely\r\n     transformed to new matter, so that an atom would have to be\r\n     in two places at once.\r\n\r\n     Maybe time-traveling progresses in little jumps like\r\n     emission of light. And maybe an atom can be in two places at\r\n     once. If you are going to treat time as just another\r\n     dimension, there seems to be no reason why an object which\r\n     can be in one place at two times cannot be at one time in\r\n     two places. This is all physics. The paradoxes of\r\n     time-traveling arise more particularly from its effect on\r\n     what we call consciousness, the something that makes me\r\n     \"me\"--an individual. We can imagine an atom in two places at\r\n     once, but not a soul, if you will. This will not bother the\r\n     materialist who considers a living creature merely a\r\n     machine, but it will most of us. So I must be content with\r\n     offering a materialistic possibility of traveling in time.\r\n\r\n     The Science Correspondence Club wishes to extend its\r\n     invitation to all Readers in other nations to join with all\r\n     privileges save that of holding office. The latter may later\r\n     be changed as our international membership increases. We\r\n     have laboratory branches here, and we want them abroad in\r\n     addition to scattered members. Then, it will be necessary to\r\n     have a governing body and director in every country. At\r\n     present all matters pertaining to foreign membership pass\r\n     through my hands and I will do my best to supply information\r\n     to all who seek it. We will also be glad to hear of the work\r\n     and plans of other similar organizations in other countries,\r\n     as we are doing with the German Verein für Raumschauffert.\r\n     Address all inquiries to me at 302 So.

C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_A Wow!_\"\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     Astounding Stories magazine is a wow! I can hardly wait\r\n     until next month for the April issue. \"The Phalanxes of\r\n     Atlans,\" \"Beyond the Vanishing Point\" and \"The Pirate\r\n     Planet\" are perfect. Every time I start a story I never stop\r\n     till it's finished. I hope that there will appear even\r\n     better stories in later issues.\r\n\r\n     Here's wishing you the best of success,--Fred Damato, 196\r\n     Greene St., New Haven, Conn.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Is Zat So!_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     Just a word or two. I have read several issues of Astounding\r\n     Stories and I notice that you have taken the word \"science\"\r\n     off the cover. It's just as well, for it was never inside\r\n     the cover, anyway. If you thought to attract Readers from\r\n     real Science Fiction fans you were all wet, for they would\r\n     never fall for the kind of things you printed. Besides,\r\n     \"what,\" a real fan wants to know \"how.\" There may be, I'll\r\n     admit, a class of Readers who like your stories, but for me\r\n     I think that you ought to print real Science Fiction or\r\n     abandon the attempt and publish out and out fairy tales. Is\r\n     everybody so pleased with your book that you receive nothing\r\n     but commendatory letters? That appears to be all you print,\r\n     at any rate. So long--Harry Pancoast, 306 West 28th St.,\r\n     Wilmington, Delaware.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Short and Sweet_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     I agree perfectly with Gertrude Hemken, of Chicago.\r\n     Astounding Stories is O. K. Why do we want a lot of deep\r\n     science with our stories? We read for pleasure not to learn\r\n     science.\r\n\r\n     I have been reading Astounding Stories since the first\r\n     issue, and I have enjoyed every story. I read several\r\n     Science Fiction magazines but yours is the best.--Stephen L.\r\n     Garcia, 47 Hazel Ave., Redwood City, Calif.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Shorter and Sweeter_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     The only good things about Astounding Stories are as\r\n     follows:\r\n\r\n     The cover design, the stories, the size of the magazine, the\r\n     illustrations in the magazine and the Authors.--John\r\n     Mackens, 366 W. 96th St., New York City.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Sequels Requested_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     I was out of reading matter so I bought the August issue of\r\n     Astounding Stories, and it was so good that I have been\r\n     buying it ever since. The only things I don't like about the\r\n     magazine are the quality of the paper, which I think could\r\n     be improved, and the uneven pages. The other Science Fiction\r\n     magazine that I read has its pages even.\r\n\r\n     Astounding Stories has a much better type of stories than\r\n     the other magazine. There are only a few stories I have seen\r\n     in your magazine which do not belong there. They are: \"A\r\n     Problem in Communication,\" which is not so much fiction and\r\n     does not have much of a plot, and \"The Ape-men of Xloti,\"\r\n     which was very well written and very interesting, but did\r\n     not have enough science in it.\r\n\r\n     I would like to see sequels to the following stories:\r\n     \"Marooned Under the Sea,\" \"Beyond the Vanishing Point,\"\r\n     \"Monsters of Mars,\" telling about another effort of the\r\n     crocodile-men to conquer Earth, \"The Gray Plague,\" telling\r\n     of another attack by the Venusians, and, most of all,\r\n     \"Vagabonds of Space.\" I would like to see a story about\r\n     their further adventures about every three months, just as I\r\n     see the stories about Commander Hanson.\r\n\r\n     I wish the best of luck for Astounding Stories.--Bill\r\n     Bailey, 1404 Wightman St., Pittsburgh, Pa.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Come Again_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     Although I have been an interested Reader of Astounding\r\n     Stories since its inception, this is the first time that I\r\n     have written; but \"our\" magazine has been so good lately\r\n     that I just had to write and compliment you on your good\r\n     work.\r\n\r\n     There are just two criticisms I have of Astounding Stories.\r\n     The first is that the binding sometimes comes off; the\r\n     second is the rough edges. I join with many other Readers in\r\n     complaining that uneven edges make it hard to find a certain\r\n     page and also give the mag a cheap looking appearance.\r\n\r\n     In my opinion the two best serials you have printed are\r\n     \"Brigands of the Moon\" and \"The Pirate Planet.\" The four\r\n     best novelettes are: \"Marooned Under the Sea,\" \"The\r\n     Fifth-Dimension Catapult,\" \"Beyond the Vanishing Point\" and\r\n     \"Vagabonds of Space.\"--Eugene Bray, Campbell, Mo.\r\n\r\n\r\n_How Simple!_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     Just a few lines to set Mr. Greenfeld right on that question\r\n     of how a man could be disintegrated and then reintegrated as\r\n     two (or more) similar men.\r\n\r\n     Briefly, the atomic or molecular structure of the original\r\n     man could serve as a pattern to be set up in the\r\n     reintegrating machine or machines while he is being\r\n     dissolved by the disintegrating machine. Thus, the\r\n     reintegrators could reconstruct any number of similar men by\r\n     following the pattern of his molecular structure and drawing\r\n     on a prearranged supply of the basic elements.\r\n\r\n     As for the \"soul,\" that is merely the manifestation of the\r\n     chemical combinations in the man's body, and when said\r\n     chemical combinations are duplicated, the \"soul\" simply\r\n     follows suit.--Joseph N. Mosleh, 4002 Sixth Ave., Brooklyn,\r\n     N. Y.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Both in One Issue_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     I think it's about time to let you know what I think of your\r\n     wonderful magazine. Of course, I have my dislikes but they\r\n     are very few. I wish you would make up your magazine larger\r\n     and even the pages up. The best complete novelettes I have\r\n     read were both in the same issue. They were \"Monsters of\r\n     Mars,\" by Edmond Hamilton and \"Four Miles Within,\" by\r\n     Anthony Gilmore. Wesso is by far your best artist. Please\r\n     keep him. All the other Science Fiction magazines have\r\n     quarterlies. Why don't you have one?\r\n\r\n     Good-by, and keep Astounding Stories up to its present\r\n     standard.--Frederick Morrison, Long Beach, Calif.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Good As Is_\"\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     I have been reading your mag for about five months and I\r\n     like it very much. I don't see what those guys want a\r\n     quarterly for. This mag is good as it is and there is no use\r\n     to spoil it. Wesso is a swell artist, and the best story I\r\n     read was \"The Wall of Death.\"\r\n\r\n     I'd like to get acquainted with some of your Readers. How\r\n     about it, boys?\r\n\r\n     I'll sign off.--L. Sloan, Box 101, Onset, Mass.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Just Imagine!_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     To begin, I am a mechanic more or less skilled in the\r\n     handling of tools. Now, while I have seen many builders with\r\n     tools who were dubbed \"spineless,\" \"poor fish,\" etc., it was\r\n     not because they remotely resembled the piscatorial or\r\n     Crustacea families.\r\n\r\n     It seems to me that when an author endows reptiles,\r\n     cuttlefish, etc., with superhuman intelligence, and paints a\r\n     few pictures of them as master-mechanics in the use of\r\n     tools, then I want to take the magazine I am reading, that\r\n     allows such silly slush in its pages, and feed it to my\r\n     billy-goat; he may be able to digest such silliness, but I\r\n     can't!\r\n\r\n     However, there is a redeeming feature of this sort of story:\r\n     although not written as comedy, they have a comic effect,\r\n     when one uses his imagination. Imagine, for instance, a\r\n     giant sea crab as a traffic cop! He could direct four\r\n     streams of traffic at once while making a date with the\r\n     sweet young thing whom he had held up for a traffic\r\n     violation! Then think what a great, intelligent reptile,\r\n     crocodile, or what have you, could do in our Prohibition\r\n     Enforcement Service! He could place his armored body across\r\n     the road, and when rum runners bumped into him he could take\r\n     his handy disintegrator and turn their load of white\r\n     lightning back into the original corn patch! And suppose a\r\n     giant, humanly-intelligent centipede should make too much\r\n     whoopee some night, and endeavor to slip upstairs without\r\n     waking the wife. Even if he succeeded in getting off his\r\n     thousand pairs of shoes, which is doubtful, he would have a\r\n     sweet time keeping his myriad of legs under control after\r\n     partaking of some of the tangle-foot dispensed nowadays!\r\n\r\n     I hope your Authors will read and heed the delicate sarcasm\r\n     contained in the letter of Robert R. Young in your April\r\n     issue.--Carl F. Morgan, 427 E. Columbia Ave., College Park,\r\n     Ga.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_Craves Excitement_\"\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     I have been a silent Reader of your magazine for quite a\r\n     long while, but have finally decided to come forth with my\r\n     own little contribution to \"The Readers' Corner.\" So far I\r\n     have seen only two other women Readers' letters. I suppose\r\n     most women are interested in love stories, though I fail to\r\n     see anything very exciting in any that are written nowadays;\r\n     and I crave excitement in my reading. I've read about most\r\n     everything there is about this old earth, so I've decided to\r\n     wander into new fields.\r\n\r\n     Now for a little discussion about Astounding Stories. I\r\n     haven't any brickbats to throw. You seem to get more of them\r\n     than is necessary. I like the size, the price, the cover,\r\n     the illustrator, the authors, etc. Some stories don't\r\n     exactly take my fancy but the average is 100% with me.\r\n\r\n     Some that particularly pleased me were \"Marooned Under the\r\n     Sea,\" way back in the September issue, \"Jetta of the\r\n     Low-lands\" and \"Beyond the Vanishing Point.\" \"Gray Denim\"\r\n     and \"Ape-men of Xloti\" in the December issue rite A-1, too.\r\n\r\n     I congratulate Ray Cummings on his new story, even though I\r\n     haven't started to read it yet. I always know I'll enjoy his\r\n     work, no matter what it is. Time-traveling is one of my\r\n     special dishes, too.\r\n\r\n     Here's a little dig. I'm sorry, I didn't think I'd have any,\r\n     but I just thought of this. It seems to me that I never see\r\n     any stories written by two authors. Of course the stories by\r\n     single authors are O. K., but the particular two I am\r\n     thinking of are Edgar A. Manley and Walter Thode. They wrote\r\n     \"The Time Annihilator,\" as you probably know. That was one\r\n     of the best time-traveling stories I have ever read. I'm\r\n     only sorry that it couldn't have been published by\r\n     Astounding Stories.\r\n\r\n     Well, I don't want to make myself tiresome the very first\r\n     time, so I'll sign off. Please excuse the rather\r\n     unconventional stationary, but I'm writing this at the\r\n     office in my spare time. Hope I haven't worn my welcome out,\r\n     but I had so much stored up to say.\r\n\r\n     I'm waiting for the April issue, so please hurry it\r\n     up.--Betty Mulharen, 50 E. Philadelphia Ave, Detroit, Mich.\r\n\r\n\r\n_A Daisy for S. P. Wright_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     Were good old President George Washington himself to travel\r\n     through time to the present and look upon the April issue of\r\n     Astounding Stories, I am certain he would only repeat what I\r\n     say: \"Editor, I cannot tell a lie. This is the best issue\r\n     yet!\"\r\n\r\n     The cover on this issue is unique in that Astounding Stories\r\n     is written in red and white letters. I do not recall of ever\r\n     having seen this done to any Science Fiction magazine\r\n     before. Wesso's illustration leaves nothing to be desired.\r\n\r\n     Going straight through the book: \"The Monsters of Mars.\"\r\n     Good old Edmond Hamilton saves the world for us again in the\r\n     very nick of time--and we like it, too! Here's hoping\r\n     there's a million more dangers threatening Terra for Mr.\r\n     Hamilton to save us from! By the way, I wonder who drew the\r\n     illustration for this story? I can't make out his name.\r\n     Next: \"The Exile of Time,\" by Cummings. Exciting and well\r\n     illustrated. \"Hell's Dimension\" is well-written and very\r\n     interesting. Would have liked it longer. \"The World Behind\r\n     the Moon\" is splendid. More by Mr. Ernst, please. More from\r\n     Mr. Gilmore, too, because of his novelette, \"Four Miles\r\n     Within.\" \"The Lake of Light\" by that popular author Jack\r\n     Williamson surpasses his \"The Meteor Girl\" in a recent issue\r\n     of \"our\" magazine. And now I come to the last and perhaps\r\n     most interesting story of the issue: Mr. Sewell Peaslee\r\n     Wright's record of the interplanetary adventures of the\r\n     Special Patrol as told by Commander John Hanson. This series\r\n     is unsurpassable in its vivid realness. I can't help but\r\n     believe that these tales really occurred, or will occur in\r\n     the distant future. And Mr. Wright is as expert at\r\n     conceiving new forms of life as Edmond Hamilton is at saving\r\n     our Earth.\r\n\r\n     \"The Readers' Corner\" is an interesting feature, and I am\r\n     glad to hear that \"Murder Madness\" and \"Brigands of the\r\n     Moon\" are now in book form.--Forrest J. Ackerman, 530\r\n     Staples Ave., San Francisco, Calif.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Mass Production_\r\n\r\n     Dear Editor:\r\n\r\n     After reading Mr. Greenfield's letter in your April issue\r\n     regarding my story, \"An Extra Man,\" I feel that I should\r\n     like to call his attention to a point which, it seems to me,\r\n     he has overlooked, namely, that the reconstructed men were\r\n     not composed of the original physical matter of the\r\n     disintegrated man but of identical elements, all of which\r\n     are at present known and available to science.\r\n\r\n     According to the hypothesis, Drayle could have produced as\r\n     many entities as he desired and provided for, just as a\r\n     radio broadcast is reproduced in as many places as are\r\n     prepared for its reception. The vibrations alone are\r\n     transmitted, and the reproduction is the result of a\r\n     reciprocal mechanical action by physical matter at the\r\n     receiving end. Any radio engineer knows that the original\r\n     sound waves are not transported, but merely their impress\r\n     upon the electrical radio wave. So, Drayle's disintegrating\r\n     and sending apparatus only transmitted the vibrations which\r\n     enabled his machines at the receiving end to select from a\r\n     more than adequate supply of raw material, in due proportion\r\n     and quantities, as much as was required for the reproduction\r\n     of the disintegrated entities.\r\n\r\n     I think that if Mr. Greenfield will reread the story, noting\r\n     the following references, he will agree that if the\r\n     hypothesis is accepted the conclusion is logical:\r\n\r\n     1--It is only Jackson Gee and not Drayle who speaks of\r\n     transmitting the constituent elements by radio (page 120).\r\n\r\n     2--The scientist, Drayle, says, (page 129) \"We already know\r\n     the elements that make the human body, and we can put them\r\n     together in the their proper proportions and arrangements;\r\n     but we have not been able to introduce the vitalizing spark,\r\n     the key vibrations, to start it going.\" He does not say that\r\n     tangible matter can be transmitted by radio.\r\n\r\n     3--In the account of Drayle's preliminary experiments (page\r\n     122) there is no statement to the effect that the original\r\n     material composing the disintegrated glass was used in its\r\n     recreation.\r\n\r\n     4--There is nothing in the story to indicate that the\r\n     original physical composition of the disintegrated man was\r\n     transported, in any manner to any outside location. The\r\n     process of disintegration was necessary to obtain the\r\n     vibrations that would make possible their repetition, which\r\n     under proper conditions would induce a reproduction of the\r\n     original, just as a song must be sung before it can be\r\n     reproduced upon a phonograph disc, but which, once recorded\r\n     can be repeated times without number.\r\n\r\n     5--Drayle's question (page 124) \"Have you arranged the\r\n     elements?\" refers to the elements out of which all mankind\r\n     is composed and which Drayle has previously mentioned (page\r\n     120).\r\n\r\n     6--The narrator emphasizes this aspect of the discovery when\r\n     he says, on page 124, \"I seemed to see man's (not the man's)\r\n     elementary dust and vapors whirled from great containers\r\n     upward into a stratum of shimmering air and gradually assume\r\n     the outlines of a human form that became first opaque, then\r\n     solid, and then a sentient being.\" And again (page 126),\r\n     \"The best of the race could be multiplied indefinitely and\r\n     man could make man literally out of the dust of the earth.\"\r\n     This does not imply a split-up of one individual into\r\n     several smaller sizes or fractional parts, but rather the\r\n     production of identical entities exactly as thousands of\r\n     phonograph records can be created from the master matrix.\r\n\r\n     7--As to the question of soul, I suggest that inasmuch as\r\n     what we call the soul of an individual is always judged by\r\n     that individual's behavior, and that medical science now\r\n     maintains that behavior is largely dependent upon our\r\n     physical mechanism, it would follow that the identical human\r\n     mechanisms would have identical souls.--Jackson Gee.\r\n\r\n\r\n\"_The Readers' Corner_\"\r\n\r\nAll Readers are extended a sincere and cordial invitation to \"come\r\nover in 'The Readers' Corner'\" and join in our monthly discussion of\r\nstories, authors, scientific principles and possibilities--everything\r\nthat's of common interest in connection with our Astounding Stories.\r\n\r\nAlthough from time to time the Editor may make a comment or so, this\r\nis a department primarily for _Readers_, and we want you to make full\r\nuse of it.
