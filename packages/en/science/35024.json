In order to\r\ntest the effect of the earth's rotation on its gravitational force, the\r\nAcademy in 1672 sent Jean Richer to the equatorial island of Cayenne to\r\ncompare the rate of a clock which was known to have kept accurate time\r\nin Paris. Richer found that the clock lost 2 minutes and 28 seconds at\r\nCayenne, indicating a substantial decrease in the force of gravity on\r\nthe pendulum. Subsequent pendulum experiments revealed that the period\r\nof a pendulum varied not only with the latitude but also regionally,\r\nunder the influence of topographical features such as mountains. It\r\nbecame clear that the measurement of gravity should be made a part of\r\nthe work of the geodetic surveyor.]\r\n\r\n\r\n    _The history of gravity pendulums dates back to the time of\r\n    Galileo. After the discovery of the variation of the force of\r\n    gravity over the surface of the earth, gravity measurement\r\n    became a major concern of physics and geodesy. This article\r\n    traces the history of the development of instruments for this\r\n    purpose._\r\n\r\n    THE AUTHORS: _Victor F. Lenzen is Professor of Physics,\r\n    Emeritus, at the University of California at Berkeley and Robert\r\n    P. Multhauf is Chairman of the Department of Science and\r\n    Technology in the Smithsonian Institution's Museum of History\r\n    and Technology._\r\n\r\n\r\nThe intensity of gravity, or the acceleration of a freely falling body,\r\nis an important physical quantity for the several physical sciences. The\r\nintensity of gravity determines the weight of a standard pound or\r\nkilogram as a standard or unit of force. In physical experiments, the\r\nforce on a body may be measured by determining the weight of a known\r\nmass which serves to establish equilibrium against it. Thus, in the\r\nabsolute determination of the ampere with a current balance, the force\r\nbetween two coils carrying current is balanced by the earth's\r\ngravitational force upon a body of determinable mass. The intensity of\r\ngravity enters into determinations of the size of the earth from the\r\nangular velocity of the moon, its distance from the earth, and Newton's\r\ninverse square law of gravitation and the laws of motion. Prediction\r\nof the motion of an artificial satellite requires an accurate knowledge\r\nof gravity for this astronomical problem.\r\n\r\nThe gravity field of the earth also provides data for a determination of\r\nthe figure of the earth, or geoid, but for this problem of geodesy\r\nrelative values of gravity are sufficient. If g is the intensity of\r\ngravity at some reference station, and [Delta]g is the difference\r\nbetween intensities at two stations, the values of gravity in geodetic\r\ncalculations enter as ratios ([Delta]g)/g over the surface of the earth.\r\nGravimetric investigations in conjunction with other forms of\r\ngeophysical investigation, such as seismology, furnish data to test\r\nhypotheses concerning the internal structure of the earth.\r\n\r\nWhether the intensity of gravity is sought in absolute or relative\r\nmeasure, the most widely used instrument for its determination since the\r\ncreation of classical mechanics has been the pendulum. In recent\r\ndecades, there have been invented gravity meters based upon the\r\nprinciple of the spring, and these instruments have made possible the\r\nrapid determination of relative values of gravity to a high degree of\r\naccuracy. The gravity meter, however, must be calibrated at stations\r\nwhere the absolute value of gravity has been determined by other means\r\nif absolute values are sought. For absolute determinations of gravity,\r\nthe pendulum historically has been the principal instrument employed.\r\nAlthough alternative methods of determining absolute values of gravity\r\nare now in use, the pendulum retains its value for absolute\r\ndeterminations, and even retains it for relative determinations, as is\r\nexemplified by the Cambridge Pendulum Apparatus and that of the Dominion\r\nObservatory at Ottawa, Ontario.\r\n\r\nThe pendulums employed for absolute or relative determinations of\r\ngravity have been of two basic types. The first form of pendulum used as\r\na physical instrument consisted of a weight suspended by a fiber, cord,\r\nor fine wire, the upper end of which was attached to a fixed support.\r\nSuch a pendulum may be called a \"simple\" pendulum; the enclosure of the\r\nword simple by quotation marks is to indicate that such a pendulum is an\r\napproximation to a simple, or mathematical pendulum, a conceptual object\r\nwhich consists of a mass-point suspended by a weightless inextensible\r\ncord. If l is the length of the simple pendulum, the time of swing\r\n(half-period in the sense of physics) for vibrations of infinitely small\r\namplitude, as derived from Newton's laws of motion and the hypothesis\r\nthat weight is proportional to mass, is T = [pi][sqrt](l/g).\r\n\r\nThe second form of pendulum is the compound, or physical, pendulum. It\r\nconsists of an extended solid body which vibrates about a fixed axis\r\nunder the action of the weight of the body. A compound pendulum may be\r\nconstituted to oscillate about one axis only, in which case it is\r\nnonreversible and applicable only for relative measurements. Or a\r\ncompound pendulum may be constituted to oscillate about two axes, in\r\nwhich case it is reversible (or \"convertible\") and may be used to\r\ndetermine absolute values of gravity. Capt. Henry Kater, F.R.S., during\r\nthe years 1817-1818 was the first to design, construct, and use a\r\ncompound pendulum for the absolute determination of gravity. He\r\nconstructed a convertible pendulum with two knife edges and with it\r\ndetermined the absolute value of gravity at the house of Henry Browne,\r\nF.R.S., in Portland Place, London. He then constructed a similar\r\ncompound pendulum with only one knife edge, and swung it to determine\r\nrelative values of gravity at a number of stations in the British Isles.\r\nThe 19th century witnessed the development of the theory and practice of\r\nobservations with pendulums for the determination of absolute and\r\nrelative values of gravity.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nGalileo, Huygens, and Newton\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pendulum has been both an objective and an instrument of physical\r\ninvestigation since the foundations of classical mechanics were\r\nfashioned in the 17th century.[1] It is tradition that the youthful\r\nGalileo discovered that the period of oscillation of a pendulum is\r\nconstant by observations of the swings of the great lamp suspended from\r\nthe ceiling in the cathedral of Pisa.[2] The lamp was only a rough\r\napproximation to a simple pendulum, but Galileo later performed more\r\naccurate experiments with a \"simple\" pendulum which consisted of a heavy\r\nball suspended by a cord. In an experiment designed to confirm his laws\r\nof falling bodies, Galileo lifted the ball to the level of a given\r\naltitude and released it. The ball ascended to the same level on the\r\nother side of the vertical equilibrium position and thereby confirmed a\r\nprediction from the laws. Galileo also discovered that the period of\r\nvibration of a \"simple\" pendulum varies as the square root of its\r\nlength, a result which is expressed by the formula for the time of\r\nswing of the ideal simple pendulum. He also used a pendulum to measure\r\nlapse of time, and he designed a pendulum clock. Galileo's experimental\r\nresults are important historically, but have required correction in the\r\nlight of subsequent measurements of greater precision.\r\n\r\nMersenne in 1644 made the first determination of the length of the\r\nseconds pendulum,[3] that is, the length of a simple pendulum that beats\r\nseconds (half-period in the sense of physics). Subsequently, he proposed\r\nthe problem to determine the length of the simple pendulum equivalent in\r\nperiod to a given compound pendulum. This problem was solved by Huygens,\r\nwho in his famous work _Horologium oscillatorium_ ... (1673) set forth\r\nthe theory of the compound pendulum.[4]\r\n\r\nHuygens derived a theorem which has provided the basis for the\r\nemployment of the reversible compound pendulum for the absolute\r\ndetermination of the intensity of gravity. The theorem is that a given\r\ncompound pendulum possesses conjugate points on opposite sides of the\r\ncenter of gravity; about these points, the periods of oscillation are\r\nthe same. For each of these points as center of suspension the other\r\npoint is the center of oscillation, and the distance between them is the\r\nlength of the equivalent simple pendulum. Earlier, in 1657, Huygens\r\nindependently had invented and patented the pendulum clock, which\r\nrapidly came into use for the measurement of time. Huygens also created\r\nthe theory of centripetal force which made it possible to calculate the\r\neffect of the rotation of the earth upon the observed value of gravity.\r\n\r\nThe theory of the gravity field of the earth was founded upon the laws\r\nof motion and the law of gravitation by Isaac Newton in his famous\r\n_Principia_ (1687). It follows from the Newtonian theory of gravitation\r\nthat the acceleration of gravity as determined on the surface of the\r\nearth is the resultant of two factors: the principal factor is the\r\ngravitational attraction of the earth upon bodies, and the subsidiary\r\nfactor is the effect of the rotation of the earth. A body at rest on the\r\nsurface of the earth requires some of the gravitational attraction for\r\nthe centripetal acceleration of the body as it is carried in a circle\r\nwith constant speed by the rotation of the earth about its axis. If the\r\nrotating earth is used as a frame of reference, the effect of the\r\nrotation is expressed as a centrifugal force which acts to diminish the\r\nobserved intensity of gravity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nGLOSSARY OF GRAVITY TERMINOLOGY\r\n\r\nABSOLUTE GRAVITY: the value of the acceleration of gravity, also\r\nexpressed by the length of the seconds pendulum.\r\n\r\nRELATIVE GRAVITY: the value of the acceleration of gravity relative to\r\nthe value at some standard point.\r\n\r\nSIMPLE PENDULUM: see theoretical pendulum.\r\n\r\nTHEORETICAL PENDULUM: a heavy bob (point-mass) at the end of a\r\nweightless rod.\r\n\r\nSECONDS PENDULUM: a theoretical or simple pendulum of such length that\r\nits time of swing (half-period) is one second. (This length is about one\r\nmeter.)\r\n\r\nGRAVITY PENDULUM: a precisely made pendulum used for the measurement of\r\ngravity.\r\n\r\nCOMPOUND PENDULUM: a pendulum in which the supporting rod is not\r\nweightless; in other words, any actual pendulum.\r\n\r\nCONVERTIBLE PENDULUM: a compound pendulum having knife edges at\r\ndifferent distances from the center of gravity. Huygens demonstrated\r\n(1673) that if such a pendulum were to swing with equal periods from\r\neither knife edge, the distance between those knife edges would be equal\r\nto the length of a theoretical or simple pendulum of the same period.\r\n\r\nREVERSIBLE PENDULUM: a convertible pendulum which is also symmetrical in\r\nform.\r\n\r\nINVARIABLE PENDULUM: a compound pendulum with only one knife edge, used\r\nfor relative measurement of gravity.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFrom Newton's laws of motion and the hypothesis that weight is\r\nproportional to mass, the formula for the half-period of a simple\r\npendulum is given by T = [pi][sqrt](l/g). If a simple pendulum beats\r\nseconds, 1 = [pi][sqrt]([lambda]/g), where [lambda] is the length of the\r\nseconds pendulum. From T = [pi][sqrt](l/g) and 1 = [pi][sqrt]([lambda]/g),\r\nit follows that [lambda] = l/T^{2}. Then g = [pi]^{2}[lambda]. Thus, the\r\nintensity of gravity can be expressed in terms of the length of the\r\nseconds pendulum, as well as by the acceleration of a freely falling\r\nbody. During the 19th century, gravity usually was expressed in terms of\r\nthe length of the seconds pendulum, but present practice is to express\r\ngravity in terms of g, for which the unit is the gal, or one centimeter\r\nper second per second.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 2.--THIS DRAWING, FROM RICHER'S _Observations\r\nastronomiques et physiques faites en l'isle de Caienne_ (Paris, 1679),\r\nshows most of the astronomical instruments used by Richer, namely, one\r\nof the two pendulum clocks made by Thuret, the 20-foot and the 5-foot\r\ntelescopes and the large quadrant. The figure may be intended as a\r\nportrait of Richer. This drawing was done by Sebastian Le Clerc, a young\r\nillustrator who made many illustrations of the early work of the Paris\r\nAcademy.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFigure of the Earth\r\n\r\n\r\nA principal contribution of the pendulum as a physical instrument has\r\nbeen the determination of the figure of the earth.[5] That the earth\r\nis spherical in form was accepted doctrine among the ancient Greeks.\r\nPythagoras is said to have been the first to describe the earth as a\r\nsphere, and this view was adopted by Eudoxus and Aristotle.\r\n\r\nThe Alexandrian scientist Eratosthenes made the first estimate of the\r\ndiameter and circumference of a supposedly spherical earth by an\r\nastronomical-geodetic method. He measured the angle between the\r\ndirections of the rays of the sun at Alexandria and Syene (Aswan),\r\nEgypt, and estimated the distance between these places from the length\r\nof time required by a caravan of camels to travel between them. From the\r\ncentral angle corresponding to the arc on the surface, he calculated the\r\nradius and hence the circumference of the earth. A second measurement\r\nwas undertaken by Posidonius, who measured the altitudes of stars at\r\nAlexandria and Rhodes and estimated the distance between them from the\r\ntime required to sail from one place to the other.\r\n\r\nWith the decline of classical antiquity, the doctrine of the spherical\r\nshape of the earth was lost, and only one investigation, that by the\r\nArabs under Calif Al-Mamun in A.D. 827, is recorded until the 16th\r\ncentury. In 1525, the French mathematician Fernel measured the length of\r\na degree of latitude between Paris and Amiens by the revolutions of the\r\nwheels of his carriage, the circumference of which he had determined. In\r\nEngland, Norwood in 1635 measured the length of an arc between London\r\nand York with a chain. An important forward step in geodesy was the\r\nmeasurement of distance by triangulation, first by Tycho Brahe, in\r\nDenmark, and later, in 1615, by Willebrord Snell, in Holland.\r\n\r\nOf historic importance, was the use of telescopes in the triangulation\r\nfor the measurement of a degree of arc by the Abbe Jean Picard in\r\n1669.[6] He had been commissioned by the newly established Academy of\r\nSciences to measure an arc corresponding to an angle of 1 deg., 22', 55\"\r\nof the meridian between Amiens and Malvoisine, near Paris. Picard proposed\r\nto the Academy the measurement of the meridian of Paris through all of\r\nFrance, and this project was supported by Colbert, who obtained the\r\napproval of the King. In 1684, Giovanni-Domenico Cassini and De la Hire\r\ncommenced a trigonometrical measure of an arc south of Paris;\r\nsubsequently, Jacques Cassini, the son of Giovanni-Domenico, added the\r\narc to the north of Paris. The project was completed in 1718. The length\r\nof a degree of arc south of Paris was found to be greater than the\r\nlength north of Paris. From the difference, 57,097 toises[7] minus\r\n56,960 toises, it was concluded that the polar diameter of the earth is\r\nlarger than the equatorial diameter, i.e., that the earth is a prolate\r\nspheroid (fig. 3).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 3.--MEASUREMENTS OF THE LENGTH of a degree of\r\nlatitude which were completed in different parts of France in 1669 and\r\n1718 gave differing results which suggested that the shape of the earth\r\nis not a sphere but a prolate spheroid (1). But Richer's pendulum\r\nobservation of 1672, as explained by Huygens and Newton, indicated that\r\nits shape is that of an oblate spheroid (2). The disagreement is\r\nreflected in this drawing. In the 1730's it was resolved in favor of the\r\nlatter view by two French geodetic expeditions for the measurement of\r\ndegrees of latitude in the equatorial and polar regions (Ecuador--then\r\npart of Peru--and Lapland).]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Richer in 1672 had been sent to Cayenne, French Guiana, to\r\nmake astronomical observations and to measure the length of the seconds\r\npendulum.[8] He took with him a pendulum clock which had been adjusted\r\nto keep accurate time in Paris. At Cayenne, however, Richer found that\r\nthe clock was retarded by 2 minutes and 28 seconds per day (fig. 1). He\r\nalso fitted up a \"simple\" pendulum to vibrate in seconds and measured\r\nthe length of this seconds pendulum several times every week for 10\r\nmonths. Upon his return to Paris, he found that the length of the\r\n\"simple\" pendulum which beat seconds at Cayenne was 1-1/4 Paris lines[9]\r\nshorter than the length of the seconds pendulum at Paris. Huygens\r\nexplained the reduction in the length of the seconds pendulum--and,\r\ntherefore, the lesser intensity of gravity at the equator with respect\r\nto the value at Paris--in terms of his theory of centripetal force as\r\napplied to the rotation of the earth and pendulum.[10]\r\n\r\nA more complete theory was given by Newton in the _Principia_.[11]\r\nNewton showed that if the earth is assumed to be a homogeneous, mutually\r\ngravitating fluid globe, its rotation will result in a bulging at the\r\nequator. The earth will then have the form of an oblate spheroid, and\r\nthe intensity of gravity as a form of universal gravitation will vary\r\nwith position on the surface of the earth. Newton took into account\r\ngravitational attraction and centrifugal action, and he calculated the\r\nratio of the axes of the spheroid to be 230:229. He calculated and\r\nprepared a table of the lengths of a degree of latitude and of the\r\nseconds pendulum for every 5 deg. of latitude from the equator to the\r\npole. A discrepancy between his predicted length of the seconds pendulum\r\nat the equator and Richer's measured length was explained by Newton in\r\nterms of the expansion of the scale with higher temperatures near the\r\nequator.\r\n\r\nNewton's theory that the earth is an oblate spheroid was confirmed by\r\nthe measurements of Richer, but was rejected by the Paris Academy of\r\nSciences, for it contradicted the results of the Cassinis, father and\r\nson, whose measurements of arcs to the south and north of Paris had led\r\nto the conclusion that the earth is a prolate spheroid. Thus, a\r\ncontroversy arose between the English scientists and the Paris Academy.\r\nThe conflict was finally resolved by the results of expeditions sent by\r\nthe Academy to Peru and Sweden. The first expedition, under Bouguer, La\r\nCondamine, and Godin in 1735, went to a region in Peru, and, with the\r\nhelp of the Spaniard Ullo, measured a meridian arc of about 3 deg. 7'\r\nnear Quito, now in Ecuador.[12] The second expedition, with Maupertuis\r\nand Clairaut in 1736, went to Lapland within the Arctic Circle and\r\nmeasured an arc of about 1 deg. in length.[13] The northern arc of 1 deg.\r\nwas found to be longer than the Peruvian arc of 1 deg., and thus it was\r\nconfirmed that the earth is an oblate spheroid, that is, flattened at\r\nthe poles, as predicted by the theory of Newton.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 4.--THE DIRECT USE OF A CLOCK to measure the force\r\nof gravity was found to be limited in accuracy by the necessary\r\nmechanical connection of the pendulum to the clock, and by the\r\nunavoidable difference between the characteristics of a clock pendulum\r\nand those of a theoretical (usually called \"simple\") pendulum, in which\r\nthe mass is concentrated in the bob, and the supporting rod is\r\nweightless.\r\n\r\nAfter 1735, the clock was used only to time the swing of a detached\r\npendulum, by the method of \"coincidences.\" In this method, invented by\r\nJ. J. Mairan, the length of the detached pendulum is first accurately\r\nmeasured, and the clock is corrected by astronomical observation. The\r\ndetached pendulum is then swung before the clock pendulum as shown here.\r\nThe two pendulums swing more or less out of phase, coming into\r\ncoincidence each time one has gained a vibration. By counting the number\r\nof coincidences over several hours, the period of the detached pendulum\r\ncan be very accurately determined. The length and period of the detached\r\npendulum are the data required for the calculation of the force of\r\ngravity.]\r\n\r\nThe period from Eratosthenes to Picard has been called the spherical era\r\nof geodesy; the period from Picard to the end of the 19th century has\r\nbeen called the ellipsoidal period. During the latter period the earth\r\nwas conceived to be an ellipsoid, and the determination of its\r\nellipticity, that is, the difference of equatorial radius and polar\r\nradius divided by the equatorial radius, became an important geodetic\r\nproblem. A significant contribution to the solution of this problem was\r\nmade by determinations of gravity by the pendulum.\r\n\r\nAn epoch-making work during the ellipsoidal era of geodesy was\r\nClairaut's treatise, _Theorie de la figure de la terre_.[14] On the\r\nhypothesis that the earth is a spheroid of equilibrium, that is, such\r\nthat a layer of water would spread all over it, and that the internal\r\ndensity varies so that layers of equal density are coaxial spheroids,\r\nClairaut derived a historic theorem: If [gamma]_{E}, [gamma]_{P} are the\r\nvalues of gravity at the equator and pole, respectively, and c the\r\ncentrifugal force at the equator divided by [gamma]_{E}, then the\r\nellipticity [alpha] = (5/2)c - ([gamma]_{P} - [gamma]_{E})/[gamma]_{E}.\r\n\r\nLaplace showed that the surfaces of equal density might have any nearly\r\nspherical form, and Stokes showed that it is unnecessary to assume any\r\nlaw of density as long as the external surface is a spheroid of\r\nequilibrium.[15] It follows from Clairaut's theorem that if the earth is\r\nan oblate spheroid, its ellipticity can be determined from relative\r\nvalues of gravity and the absolute value at the equator involved in c.\r\nObservations with nonreversible, invariable compound pendulums have\r\ncontributed to the application of Clairaut's theorem in its original and\r\ncontemporary extended form for the determination of the figure and\r\ngravity field of the earth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEarly Types of Pendulums\r\n\r\n\r\nThe pendulum employed in observations of gravity prior to the 19th\r\ncentury usually consisted of a small weight suspended by a filament\r\n(figs. 4-6). The pioneer experimenters with \"simple\" pendulums changed\r\nthe length of the suspension until the pendulum beat seconds. Picard in\r\n1669 determined the length of the seconds pendulum at Paris with a\r\n\"simple\" pendulum which consisted of a copper ball an inch in diameter\r\nsuspended by a fiber of pite from jaws (pite was a preparation of the\r\nleaf of a species of aloe and was not affected appreciably by moisture).\r\n\r\nA celebrated set of experiments with a \"simple\" pendulum was conducted\r\nby Bouguer[16] in 1737 in the Andes, as part of the expedition to\r\nmeasure the Peruvian arc. The bob of the pendulum was a double\r\ntruncated cone, and the length was measured from the jaw suspension to\r\nthe center of oscillation of the thread and bob. Bouguer allowed for\r\nchange of length of his measuring rod with temperature and also for the\r\nbuoyancy of the air. He determined the time of swing by an elementary\r\nform of the method of coincidences. The thread of the pendulum was swung\r\nin front of a scale and Bouguer observed how long it took the pendulum\r\nto lose a number of vibrations on the seconds clock. For this purpose,\r\nhe noted the time when the beat of the clock was heard and,\r\nsimultaneously, the thread moved past the center of the scale. A\r\nhistoric aspect of Bouguer's method was that he employed an \"invariable\"\r\npendulum, that is, the length was maintained the same at the various\r\nstations of observation, a procedure that has been described as having\r\nbeen invented by Bouguer.\r\n\r\nSince T = [pi][sqrt](l/g), it follows that (T_{1})^{2}/(T_{2})^{2} =\r\ng_{2}/g_{1}. Thus, if the absolute value of gravity is known at one\r\nstation, the value at any other station can be determined from the ratio\r\nof the squares of times of swing of an invariable pendulum at the two\r\nstations. From the above equation, if T_{1} is the time of swing at a\r\nstation where the intensity of gravity is g, and T_{2} is the time at a\r\nstation where the intensity is g + [Delta]g, then [Delta]g/g =\r\n(T_{1})^{2}/(T_{2})^{2} - 1.\r\n\r\nBouguer's investigations with his invariable pendulum yielded methods\r\nfor the determination of the internal structure of the earth. On the\r\nPeruvian expedition, he determined the length of the seconds pendulum at\r\nthree stations, including one at Quito, at varying distances above sea\r\nlevel. If values of gravity at stations of different elevation are to be\r\ncompared, they must be reduced to the same level, usually to sea level.\r\nSince gravity decreases with height above sea level in accordance with\r\nthe law of gravitation, a free-air reduction must be applied to values\r\nof gravity determined above the level of the sea. Bouguer originated the\r\nadditional reduction for the increase in gravity on a mountain or\r\nplateau caused by the attraction of the matter in a plate. From the\r\nrelative values of gravity at elevated stations in Peru and at sea\r\nlevel, Bouguer calculated that the mean density of the earth was 4.7\r\ntimes greater than that of the _cordilleras_.[17] For greater accuracy\r\nin the study of the internal structure of the earth, in the 19th century\r\nthe Bouguer plate reduction came to be supplemented by corrections for\r\nirregularities of terrain and by different types of isostatic reduction.\r\n\r\nLa Condamine, who like Bouguer was a member of the Peruvian expedition,\r\nconducted his own pendulum experiments (fig. 4). He experimented in 1735\r\nat Santo Domingo en route to South America,[18] then at various stations\r\nin South America, and again at Paris upon his return to France. His\r\npendulum consisted of a copper ball suspended by a thread of pite. For\r\nexperimentation the length initially was about 12 feet, and the time of\r\nswing 2 seconds, but then the length was reduced to about 3 feet with\r\ntime of swing 1 second. Earlier, when it was believed that gravity was\r\nconstant over the earth, Picard and others had proposed that the length\r\nof the seconds pendulum be chosen as the standard. La Condamine in 1747\r\nrevived the proposal in the form that the length of the seconds pendulum\r\nat the equator be adopted as the standard of length. Subsequently, he\r\ninvestigated the expansion of a toise of iron from the variation in the\r\nperiod of his pendulum. In 1755, he observed the pendulum at Rome with\r\nBoscovich. La Condamine's pendulum was used by other observers and\r\nfinally was lost at sea on an expedition around the world. The knowledge\r\nof the pendulum acquired by the end of the 18th century was summarized\r\nin 1785 in a memoir by Boscovich.[19]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 5.--AN APPARATUS FOR THE PRACTICE MEASUREMENT of\r\nthe length of the pendulum devised on the basis of a series of\r\npreliminary experiments by C. M. de la Condamine who, in the course of\r\nthe French geodetic expedition to Peru in 1735, devoted a 3-month\r\nsojourn on the island of Santo Domingo to pendulum observations by\r\nMairan's Method. In this arrangement, shown here, a vertical rod of\r\nironwood is used both as the scale and as the support for the apparatus,\r\nhaving at its top the brass pendulum support (A) and, below, a\r\nhorizontal mirror (O) which serves to align the apparatus vertically\r\nthrough visual observation of the reflection of the pointer projecting\r\nfrom A. The pendulum, about 37 inches long, consists of a thread of pite\r\n(a humidity-resistant, natural fiber) and a copper ball of about 6\r\nounces. Its exact length is determined by adjusting the micrometer (S)\r\nso that the ball nearly touches the mirror. It will be noted that the\r\nclock pendulum would be obscured by the scale. La Condamine seems to\r\nhave determined the times of coincidence by visual observation of the\r\noccasions on which \"the pendulums swing parallel.\" (Portion of plate 1,\r\n_Memoires publies par la Societe francaise de Physique_, vol. 4.)]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 6.--THE RESULT of early pendulum experiments was\r\noften expressed in terms of the length of a pendulum which would have a\r\nperiod of one second and was called \"the seconds pendulum.\" In 1792, J.\r\nC. Borda and J. D. Cassini determined the length of the seconds pendulum\r\nat Paris with this apparatus. The pendulum consists of a platinum ball\r\nabout 1-1/2 inches in diameter, suspended by a fine iron wire. The\r\nlength, about 12 feet, was such that its period would be nearly twice as\r\nlong as that of the pendulum of the clock (A). The interval between\r\ncoincidences was determined by observing, through the telescope at the\r\nleft, the times when the two pendulums emerge together from behind the\r\nscreen (M). The exact length of the pendulum was measured by a platinum\r\nscale (not shown) equipped with a vernier and an auxiliary copper scale\r\nfor temperature correction.\r\n\r\nWhen, at the end of the 18th century, the French revolutionary\r\ngovernment established the metric system of weights and measures, the\r\nlength of the seconds pendulum at Paris was considered, but not adopted,\r\nas the unit of length. (Plate 2, _Memoires publies par la Societe\r\nfrancaise de Physique_, vol. 4.)]\r\n\r\nThe practice with the \"simple\" pendulum on the part of Picard, Bouguer,\r\nLa Condamine and others in France culminated in the work of Borda and\r\nCassini in 1792 at the observatory in Paris[20] (fig. 6). The\r\nexperiments were undertaken to determine whether or not the length of\r\nthe seconds pendulum should be adopted as the standard of length by the\r\nnew government of France. The bob consisted of a platinum ball 16-1/6\r\nParis lines in diameter, and 9,911 grains (slightly more than 17 ounces)\r\nin weight. The bob was held to a brass cup covering about one-fifth of\r\nits surface by the interposition of a small quantity of grease. The cup\r\nwith ball was hung by a fine iron wire about 12 Paris feet long. The\r\nupper end of the wire was attached to a cylinder which was part of a\r\nwedge-shaped knife edge, on the upper surface of which was a stem on\r\nwhich a small adjustable weight was held by a screw thread. The knife\r\nedge rested on a steel plate. The weight on the knife-edge apparatus was\r\nadjusted so that the apparatus would vibrate with the same period as the\r\npendulum. Thus, the mass of the suspending apparatus could be neglected\r\nin the theory of motion of the pendulum about the knife edge.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 7.--RESULTS OF EXPERIMENTS in the determination of\r\nthe length of the seconds pendulum at Koenigsberg by a new method were\r\nreported by F. W. Bessel in 1826 and published in 1828. With this\r\napparatus, he obtained two sets of data from the same pendulum, by using\r\ntwo different points of suspension. The pendulum was about 10 feet long.\r\nThe distance between the two points of suspension (_a_ and _b_) was 1\r\ntoise (about six feet). A micrometric balance (_c_) below the bob was\r\nused to determine the increase in length due to the weight of the bob.\r\nHe projected the image of the clock pendulum (not shown) onto the\r\ngravity pendulum by means of a lens, thus placing the clock some\r\ndistance away and eliminating the disturbing effect of its motion.\r\n(Portion of plate 6, _Memoires publies par la Societe francaise de\r\nPhysique_, vol. 4.)]\r\n\r\nIn the earlier suspension from jaws there was uncertainty as to the\r\npoint about which the pendulum oscillated. Borda and Cassini hung their\r\npendulum in front of a seconds clock and determined the time of swing by\r\nthe method of coincidences. The times on the clock were observed when\r\nthe clock gained or lost one complete vibration (two swings) on the\r\npendulum. Suppose that the wire pendulum makes n swings while the clock\r\nmakes 2n + 2. If the clock beats seconds exactly, the time of one\r\ncomplete vibration is 2 seconds, and the time of swing of the wire\r\npendulum is T = (2n + 2)/n = 2(1 + 1/n). An error in the time caused by\r\nuncertainty in determining the coincidence of clock and wire pendulum is\r\nreduced by employing a long interval of observation 2n. The whole\r\napparatus was enclosed in a box, in order to exclude disturbances from\r\ncurrents of air. Corrections were made for buoyancy, for amplitude of\r\nswing and for variations in length of the wire with temperature. The\r\nfinal result was that the length of the seconds pendulum at the\r\nobservatory in Paris was determined to be 440.5593 Paris lines, or\r\n993.53 mm., reduced to sea level 993.85 mm. Some years later the methods\r\nof Borda were used by other French investigators, among whom was Biot\r\nwho used the platinum ball of Borda suspended by a copper wire 60 cm.\r\nlong.\r\n\r\nAnother historic \"simple\" pendulum was the one swung by Bessel (fig. 7)\r\nfor the determination of gravity at Koenigsberg 1825-1827.[21] The\r\npendulum consisted of a ball of brass, copper, or ivory that was\r\nsuspended by a fine wire, the upper end of which was wrapped and\r\nunwrapped on a horizontal cylinder as support. The pendulum was swung\r\nfirst from one point and then from another, exactly a \"toise de\r\nPeru\"[22] higher up, the bob being at the same level in each case (fig.\r\n7). Bessel found the period of vibration of the pendulum by the method\r\nof coincidences; and in order to avoid disturbances from the comparison\r\nclock, it was placed at some distance from the pendulum under\r\nobservation.\r\n\r\nBessel's experiments were significant in view of the care with which he\r\ndetermined the corrections. He corrected for the stiffness of the wire\r\nand for the lack of rigidity of connection between the bob and wire. The\r\nnecessity for the latter correction had been pointed out by Laplace, who\r\nshowed that through the circumstance that the pull of the wire is now on\r\none side and now on the other side of the center of gravity, the bob\r\nacquires angular momentum about its center of gravity, which cannot be\r\naccounted for if the line of the wire, and therefore the force that it\r\nexerts, always passed through the center. In addition to a correction\r\nfor buoyancy of the air considered by his predecessors, Bessel also took\r\naccount of the inertia of the air set in motion by the pendulum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 8.--MODE OF SUSPENSION of Bessel's pendulum is\r\nshown here. The iron wire is supported by the thumbscrew and clamp at\r\nthe left, but passes over a pin at the center, which is actually the\r\nupper terminal of the pendulum. Bessel found this \"cylinder of\r\nunrolling\" superior to the clamps and knife edges of earlier pendulums.\r\nThe counterweight at the right is part of a system for supporting the\r\nscale in such a way that it is not elongated by its own weight.\r\n\r\nWith this apparatus, Bessel determined the ratio of the lengths of the\r\ntwo pendulums and their times of vibration. From this the length of the\r\nseconds pendulum was calculated. His method eliminated the need to take\r\ninto account such sources of inaccuracy as flexure of the pendulum wire\r\nand imperfections in the shape of the bob.

He became the first superintendent of the\r\nPrussian observatory established at Koenigsberg in 1810, and remained\r\nthere during the remainder of his life. So important were his many\r\ncontributions to precise measurement and calculation in astronomy that\r\nhe is often considered the founder of the \"modern\" age in that science.\r\nThis characteristic also shows in his venture into geodesy, 1826-1830,\r\none product of which was the pendulum experiment reported in this\r\narticle.]\r\n\r\nThe latter effect had been discovered by Du Buat in 1786,[23] but his\r\nwork was unknown to Bessel. The length of the seconds pendulum at\r\nKoenigsberg, reduced to sea level, was found by Bessel to be 440.8179\r\nlines. In 1835, Bessel determined the intensity of gravity at a site in\r\nBerlin where observations later were conducted in the Imperial Office of\r\nWeights and Measures by Charles S. Peirce of the U.S. Coast Survey.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nKater's Convertible and Invariable Pendulums\r\n\r\n\r\nThe systematic survey of the gravity field of the earth was given a\r\ngreat impetus by the contributions of Capt. Henry Kater, F.R.S. In 1817,\r\nhe designed, constructed, and applied a convertible compound pendulum\r\nfor the absolute determination of gravity at the house of Henry Browne,\r\nF.R.S., in Portland Place, London.[24] Kater's convertible pendulum\r\n(fig. 11) consisted of a brass rod to which were attached a flat\r\ncircular bob of brass and two adjustable weights, the smaller of which\r\nwas adjusted by a screw. The convertibility of the pendulum was\r\nconstituted by the provision of two knife edges turned inwards on\r\nopposite sides of the center of gravity. The pendulum was swung on each\r\nknife edge, and the adjustable weights were moved until the times of\r\nswing were the same about each knife edge. When the times were judged to\r\nbe the same, the distance between the knife edges was inferred to be the\r\nlength of the equivalent simple pendulum, in accordance with Huygens'\r\ntheorem on conjugate points of a compound pendulum. Kater determined the\r\ntime of swing by the method of coincidences (fig. 12). He corrected for\r\nthe buoyancy of the air. The final value of the length of the seconds\r\npendulum at Browne's house in London, reduced to sea level, was\r\ndetermined to be 39.13929 inches.\r\n\r\nThe convertible compound pendulum had been conceived prior to its\r\nrealization by Kater. In 1792, on the occasion of the proposal in Paris\r\nto establish the standard of length as the length of the seconds\r\npendulum, Baron de Prony had proposed the employment of a compound\r\npendulum with three axes of oscillation.[25] In 1800, he proposed the\r\nconvertible compound pendulum with knife edges about which the pendulum\r\ncould complete swings in equal times. De Prony's proposals were not\r\naccepted and his papers remained unpublished until 1889, at which time\r\nthey were discovered by Defforges. The French decision was to experiment\r\nwith the ball pendulum, and the determination of the length of the\r\nseconds pendulum was carried out by Borda and Cassini by methods\r\npreviously described. Bohnenberger in his _Astronomie_ (1811),[26] made\r\nthe proposal to employ a convertible pendulum for the absolute\r\ndetermination of gravity; thus, he has received credit for priority in\r\npublication. Capt. Kater independently conceived of the convertible\r\npendulum and was the first to design, construct, and swing one.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 10.--HENRY KATER (1777-1835), English army officer\r\nand physicist. His scientific career began during his military service\r\nin India, where he assisted in the \"great trigonometrical survey.\"\r\nReturned to England because of bad health, and retired in 1814, he\r\npioneered (1818) in the development of the convertible pendulum as an\r\nalternative to the approximation of the \"simple\" pendulum for the\r\nmeasurement of the \"seconds pendulum.\" Kater's convertible pendulum and\r\nthe invariable pendulum introduced by him in 1819 were the basis of\r\nEnglish pendulum work. (_Photo courtesy National Portrait Gallery,\r\nLondon._)]\r\n\r\nAfter his observations with the convertible pendulum, Capt. Kater\r\ndesigned an invariable compound pendulum with a single knife edge but\r\notherwise similar in external form to the convertible pendulum[27] (fig.\r\n13). Thirteen of these Kater invariable pendulums have been reported as\r\nconstructed and swung at stations throughout the world.[28] Kater\r\nhimself swung an invariable pendulum at a station in London and at\r\nvarious other stations in the British Isles. Capt. Edward Sabine,\r\nbetween 1820 and 1825, made voyages and swung Kater invariable pendulums\r\nat stations from the West Indies to Greenland and Spitzbergen.[29] In\r\n1820, Kater swung a Kater invariable pendulum at London and then sent it\r\nto Goldingham, who swung it in 1821 at Madras, India.[30] Also in 1820,\r\nKater supplied an invariable pendulum to Hall, who swung it at London\r\nand then made observations near the equator and in the Southern\r\nHemisphere, and at London again in 1823.[31] The same pendulum, after\r\nits knives were reground, was delivered to Adm. Luetke of Russia, who\r\nobserved gravity with it on a trip around the world between 1826 and\r\n1829.[32]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 11.--THE ATTEMPT TO APPROXIMATE the simple\r\n(theoretical) pendulum in gravity experiments ended in 1817-18 when\r\nHenry Kater invented the compound convertible pendulum, from which the\r\nequivalent simple pendulum could be obtained according to the method of\r\nHuygens (see text, p. 314). Developed in connection with a project to\r\nfix the standard of English measure, Kater's pendulum was called\r\n\"compound\" because it was a solid bar rather than the fine wire or\r\nstring with which earlier experimenters had tried to approximate a\r\n\"weightless\" rod. It was called convertible because it is alternately\r\nswung from the two knife edges (_a_ and _b_) at opposite ends. The\r\nweights (_f_ and _g_) are adjusted so that the period of the pendulum is\r\nthe same from either knife edge. The distance between the two knife\r\nedges is then equal to the length of the equivalent simple pendulum.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 12.--THE KATER CONVERTIBLE PENDULUM in use is\r\nplaced before a clock, whose pendulum bob is directly behind the\r\nextended \"tail\" of the Kater pendulum. A white spot is painted on the\r\ncenter of the bob of the clock pendulum. The observing telescope, left,\r\nhas a diaphragm with a vertical slit of such width that its view is just\r\nfilled by the tail of the Kater pendulum when it is at rest. When the\r\ntwo pendulums are swinging, the white spot on the clock pendulum can be\r\nseen on each swing except that in which the two pendulums are in\r\ncoincidence; thus, the coincidences are determined.

The\r\nvalue of gravity obtained, directly or indirectly, in terms of the\r\nsimple pendulum, is called \"absolute.\" Once absolute values of gravity\r\nwere established at a number of stations, it became possible to use the\r\nmuch simpler \"relative\" method for the measurement of gravity at new\r\nstations. Because it has only one knife edge, and does not involve the\r\nadjustments of the convertible pendulum, this one is called\r\n\"invariable.\" In use, it is first swung at a station where the absolute\r\nvalue of gravity has been established, and this period is then compared\r\nwith its period at one or more new stations. Kater developed an\r\ninvariable pendulum in 1819, which was used in England and in Madras,\r\nIndia, in 1821.]\r\n\r\nWhile the British were engaged in swinging the Kater invariable\r\npendulums to determine relative values of the length of the seconds\r\npendulum, or of gravity, the French also sent out expeditions. Capt. de\r\nFreycinet made initial observations at Paris with three invariable brass\r\npendulums and one wooden one, and then carried out observations at Rio\r\nde Janeiro, Cape of Good Hope, Ile de France, Rawak (near New Guinea),\r\nGuam, Maui, and various other places.[33] A similar expedition was\r\nconducted in 1822-1825 by Captain Duperry.[34]\r\n\r\nDuring the years from 1827 to 1840, various types of pendulum were\r\nconstructed and swung by Francis Baily, a member of the Royal\r\nAstronomical Society, who reported in 1832 on experiments in which no\r\nless than 41 different pendulums were swung in vacuo, and their\r\ncharacteristics determined.[35] In 1836, Baily undertook to advise the\r\nAmerican Lt. Charles Wilkes, who was to head the United States\r\nExploring Expedition of 1838-1842, on the procurement of pendulums for\r\nthis voyage. Wilkes ordered from the London instrument maker, Thomas\r\nJones, two unusual pendulums, which Wilkes described as \"those\r\nconsidered the best form by Mr. Baily for traveling pendulums,\" and\r\nwhich Baily, himself, described as \"precisely the same as the two\r\ninvariable pendulums belonging to this [Royal Astronomical] Society,\"\r\nexcept for the location of the knife edges.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 14.--VACUUM CHAMBER FOR USE with the Kater\r\npendulum. Of a number of extraneous effects which tend to disturb the\r\naccuracy of pendulum observations the most important is air resistance.\r\nExperiments reported by the Greenwich (England) observatory in 1829 led\r\nto the development of a vacuum chamber within which the pendulum was\r\nswung.]\r\n\r\nThe unusual feature of these pendulums was in their symmetry of mass as\r\nwell as of form. They were made of bars, of iron in one case, and of\r\nbrass in the other, and each had two knife edges at opposite ends\r\nequidistant from the center. Thus, although they resembled reversible\r\npendulums, their symmetry of mass prevented their use as such, and they\r\nwere rather equivalent to four separate invariable pendulums.[36]\r\n\r\nWilkes was taught the use of the pendulum by Baily, and conducted\r\nexperiments at Baily's house, where the latter had carried out the work\r\nreported on in 1832. The subsequent experiments made on the U.S.\r\nExploring Expedition were under the charge of Wilkes, himself, who made\r\nobservations on 11 separate occasions, beginning with that in London\r\n(1836) and followed by others in New York, Washington, D.C., Rio de\r\nJaneiro, Sydney, Honolulu, \"Pendulum Peak\" (Mauna Loa), Mount Kanoha,\r\nNesqually (Oregon Territory), and, finally, two more times in\r\nWashington, D.C. (1841 and 1845).\r\n\r\nWilkes' results were communicated to Baily, who appears to have found\r\nthe work defective because of insufficient attention to the maintenance\r\nof temperature constancy and to certain alterations made to the\r\npendulums.[37] The results were also to have been included in the\r\npublications of the Expedition, but were part of the unpublished 24th\r\nvolume. Fortunately they still exist, in what appears to be a printer's\r\nproof.[38]\r\n\r\nThe Kater invariable pendulums were used to investigate the internal\r\nconstitution of the earth. Airy sought to determine the density of the\r\nearth by observing the times of swing of pendulums at the top and bottom\r\nof a mine. The first experiments were made in 1826 at the Dolcoath\r\ncopper mine in Cornwall, and failed when the pendulum fell to the\r\nbottom. In 1854, the experiments were again undertaken in the Harton\r\ncoalpit, near Sunderland.[39] Gravity at the surface was greater than\r\nbelow, because of the attraction of a shell equal to the depth of the\r\npit. From the density of the shell as determined from specimens of rock,\r\nAiry found the density of the earth to be 6-1/2 times greater than that\r\nof water. T. C. Mendenhall, in 1880, used a Kater convertible pendulum\r\nin an invariable manner to compare values of gravity on Fujiyama and at\r\nTokyo, Japan.[40] He used a \"simple\" pendulum of the Borda type to\r\ndetermine the absolute value of gravity at Tokyo. From the values of\r\ngravity on the mountain and at Tokyo, and an estimate of the volume of\r\nthe mountain, he estimated the mean density of the earth as 5.77 times\r\ngreater than that of water.\r\n\r\nIn 1879, Maj. J. Herschel, R.E., stated:\r\n\r\n    The years from 1840 to 1865 are a complete blank, if we except\r\n    Airy's relative density experiments in 1854. This pause was\r\n    broken simultaneously in three different ways. Two pendulums of\r\n    the Kater pattern were sent to India; two after Bessel's design\r\n    were set to work in Russia; and at Geneva, Plantamour's zealous\r\n    experiments with a pendulum of the same kind mark the\r\n    commencement of an era of renewed activity on the European\r\n    continent.[41]\r\n\r\nWith the statement that Kater invariable pendulums nos. 4 and 6 (1821)\r\nwere used in India between 1865 and 1873, we now consider the other\r\nevents mentioned by Herschel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 15.--ONE OF FRANCIS BAILY'S PENDULUMS (62-1/2\r\ninches long), shown on the left, is now in the possession of the Science\r\nMuseum, London, and, right, two views of a similar pendulum (37-5/8\r\ninches long) made in the late 19th century by Edward Kuebel, Washington,\r\nD.C., which is no. 316,876 in the collection of the U.S. National\r\nMuseum. Among a large number of pendulums tried by Baily in London\r\n(1827-1840), was one which resembles the reversible pendulum\r\nsuperficially, but which is actually an invariable pendulum having knife\r\nedges at both ends. The purpose was apparently economy, since it is\r\nequivalent to two separate invariable pendulums. This is the type of\r\npendulum used on the U.S. Exploring Expedition of 1838-1842. It is not\r\nknown what use was made of the Kuebel pendulum.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nRepsold-Bessel Reversible Pendulum\r\n\r\n\r\nAs we have noted, Bessel made determinations of gravity with a ball\r\n(\"simple\") pendulum in the period 1825-1827 and in 1835 at Koenigsberg\r\nand Berlin, respectively. In the memoir on his observations at\r\nKoenigsberg, he set forth the theory of the symmetrical compound pendulum\r\nwith interchangeable knife edges.[42] Bessel demonstrated theoretically\r\nthat if the pendulum were symmetrical with respect to its geometrical\r\ncenter, if the times of swing about each axis were the same, the effects\r\nof buoyancy and of air set in motion would be eliminated. Laplace had\r\nalready shown that the knife edge must be regarded as a cylinder and not\r\nas a mere line of support. Bessel then showed that if the knife edges\r\nwere equal cylinders, their effects were eliminated by inverting the\r\npendulum; and if the knife edges were not equal cylinders, the\r\ndifference in their effects was canceled by interchanging the knives and\r\nagain determining the times of swing in the so-called erect and inverted\r\npositions. Bessel further showed that it is unnecessary to make the\r\ntimes of swing exactly equal for the two knife edges.\r\n\r\nThe simplified discussion for infinitely small oscillations in a vacuum\r\nis as follows: If T_{1} and T_{2} are the times of swing about the knife\r\nedges, and if h_{1} and h_{2} are distances of the knife edges from the\r\ncenter of gravity, and if k is the radius of gyration about an axis\r\nthrough the center of gravity, then from the equation of motion of a\r\nrigid body oscillating about a fixed axis under gravity\r\n\r\n  (T_{1})^{2} = [pi]^{2}(k^{2} + (h_{1})^{2})/gh_{1},\r\n\r\n  (T_{2})^{2} = [pi]^{2}(k^{2} + (h_{2})^{2})/gh_{2}.\r\n\r\nThen\r\n\r\n  (h_{1}(T_{1})^{2} - h_{2}(T_{2})^{2})/(h_{1} - h_{2})\r\n\r\n  = ([pi]^{2}/g)(h_{1} + h_{2})\r\n\r\n  = [tau]^{2}.\r\n\r\n[tau] is then the time of swing of a simple pendulum of length h_{1} +\r\nh_{2}. If the difference T_{1} - T_{2} is sufficiently small,\r\n\r\n  [tau] = (h_{1}T_{1} - h_{2}T_{2})/(h_{1} - h_{2}).\r\n\r\nPrior to its publication by Bessel in 1828, the formula for the time of\r\nswing of a simple pendulum of length h_{1} + h_{2} in terms of T_{1},\r\nT_{2} had been given by C. F. Gauss in a letter to H. C. Schumacher\r\ndated November 28, 1824.[43]\r\n\r\nThe symmetrical compound pendulum with interchangeable knives, for which\r\nBessel gave a posthumously published design and specifications,[44] has\r\nbeen called a reversible pendulum; it may thereby be distinguished from\r\nKater's unsymmetrical convertible pendulum. In 1861, the Swiss Geodetic\r\nCommission was formed, and in one of its first sessions in 1862 it was\r\ndecided to add determinations of gravity to the operations connected\r\nwith the measurement--at different points in Switzerland--of the arc of\r\nthe meridian traversing central Europe.[45] It was decided further to\r\nemploy a reversible pendulum of Bessel's design and to have it\r\nconstructed by the firm of A. Repsold and Sons, Hamburg. It was also\r\ndecided to make the first observations with the pendulum in Geneva;\r\naccordingly, the Repsold-Bessel pendulum (fig. 16) was sent to Prof. E.\r\nPlantamour, director of the observatory at Geneva, in the autumn of\r\n1864.[46]\r\n\r\nThe Swiss reversible pendulum was about 560 mm. in length (distance\r\nbetween the knife edges) and the time of swing was approximately 3/4\r\nsecond. At the extremities of the stem of the pendulum were movable\r\ncylindrical disks, one of which was solid and heavy, the other hollow\r\nand light. It was intended by the mechanicians that equality of times of\r\noscillation about the knife edges would be achieved by adjusting the\r\nposition of a movable disk. The pendulum was hung by a knife edge on a\r\nplate supported by a tripod and having an attachment from which a\r\nmeasuring rod could be suspended so that the distance between the knife\r\nedges could be measured by a comparator. Plantamour found it\r\nimpracticable to adjust a disk until the times of swing about each knife\r\nedge were equal. His colleague, Charles Cellerier,[47] then showed that\r\nif (T_{1} - T_{2})/T_{1} is sufficiently small so that one can neglect\r\nits square, one can determine the length of the seconds pendulum from\r\nthe times of swing about the knife edges by a theory which uses the\r\ndistances of the center of gravity from the respective knife edges.\r\nThus, a role for the position of the center of gravity in the theory of\r\nthe reversible pendulum, which had been set forth earlier by Bessel, was\r\ndiscovered independently by Cellerier for the Swiss observers of\r\npendulums.\r\n\r\nIn 1866, Plantamour published an extensive memoir \"Experiences faites a\r\nGeneve avec le pendule a reversion.\" Another memoir, published in 1872,\r\npresented further results of determinations of gravity in Switzerland.\r\nPlantamour was the first scientist in western Europe to use a\r\nRepsold-Bessel reversible pendulum and to work out methods for its\r\nemployment.\r\n\r\nThe Russian Imperial Academy of Sciences acquired two Repsold-Bessel\r\npendulums, and observations with them were begun in 1864 by Prof.\r\nSawitsch, University of St. Petersburg, and others.[48] In 1869, the\r\nRussian pendulums were loaned to the India Survey in order to enable\r\nmembers of the Survey to supplement observations with the Kater\r\ninvariable pendulums nos. 4 and 6 (1821). During the transport of the\r\nRussian apparatus to India, the knives became rusted and the apparatus\r\nhad to be reconditioned. Capt. Heaviside of the India Survey observed\r\nwith both pendulums at Kew Observatory, near London, in the spring of\r\n1874, after which the Russian pendulums were sent to Pulkowa (Russia)\r\nand were used for observations there and in the Caucasus.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the Repsold-Bessel reversible pendulum for the\r\ndetermination of gravity was accompanied by the creation of the first\r\ninternational scientific association, one for geodesy. In 1861, Lt. Gen.\r\nJ. J. Baeyer, director of the Prussian Geodetic Survey, sent a\r\nmemorandum to the Prussian minister of war in which he proposed that the\r\nindependent geodetic surveys of the states of central Europe be\r\ncoordinated by the creation of an international organization.[49] In\r\n1862, invitations were sent to the various German states and to other\r\nstates of central Europe. The first General Conference of the\r\nassociation, initially called _Die Mittel-Europaeische Gradmessung_, also\r\n_L'Association Geodesique Internationale_, was held from the 15th to\r\nthe 22d of October 1864 in Berlin.[50] The Conference decided upon\r\nquestions of organization: a general conference was to be held\r\nordinarily every three years; a permanent commission initially\r\nconsisting of seven members was to be the scientific organ of the\r\nassociation and to meet annually; a central bureau was to be established\r\nfor the reception, publication, and distribution of reports from the\r\nmember states.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 16.--FROM A DESIGN LEFT BY BESSEL, this portable\r\napparatus was developed in 1862 by the firm of Repsold in Hamburg, whose\r\nfounder had assisted Bessel in the construction of his pendulum\r\napparatus of 1826. The pendulum is convertible, but differs from Kater's\r\nin being geometrically symmetrical and, for this reason, Repsold's is\r\nusually called \"reversible.\" Just to the right of the pendulum is a\r\nstandard scale. To the left is a \"vertical comparator\" designed by\r\nRepsold to measure the distance between the knife edges of the pendulum.\r\nTo make this measurement, two micrometer microscopes which project\r\nhorizontally through the comparator are alternately focused on the knife\r\nedges and on the standard scale.]\r\n\r\nUnder the topic \"Astronomical Questions,\" the General Conference of 1864\r\nresolved that there should be determinations of the intensity of gravity\r\nat the greatest possible number of points of the geodetic network, and\r\nrecommended the reversible pendulum as the instrument of\r\nobservation.[51] At the second General Conference, in Berlin in 1867, on\r\nthe basis of favorable reports by Dr. Hirsch, director of the\r\nobservatory at Neuchatel, of Swiss practice with the Repsold-Bessel\r\nreversible pendulum, this instrument was specifically recommended for\r\ndeterminations of gravity.[52] The title of the association was changed\r\nto _Die Europaeische Gradmessung_; in 1886, it became _Die Internationale\r\nErdmessung_, under which title it continued until World War I.\r\n\r\nOn April 1, 1866, the Central Bureau of _Die Europaeische Gradmessung_\r\nwas opened in Berlin under the presidency of Baeyer, and in 1868 there\r\nwas founded at Berlin, also under his presidency, the Royal Prussian\r\nGeodetic Institute, which obtained regular budgetary status on January\r\n1, 1870. A reversible pendulum for the Institute was ordered from A.\r\nRepsold and Sons, and it was delivered in the spring of 1869. The\r\nPrussian instrument was symmetrical geometrically, as specified by\r\nBessel, but different in form from the Swiss and Russian pendulums. The\r\ndistance between the knife edges was 1 meter, and the time of swing\r\napproximately 1 second. The Prussian Repsold-Bessel pendulum was swung\r\nat Leipzig and other stations in central Europe during the years\r\n1869-1870 by Dr. Albrecht under the direction of Dr. Bruhns, director of\r\nthe observatory at Leipzig and chief of the astronomical section of the\r\nGeodetic Institute. The results of these first observations appeared in\r\na publication of the Royal Prussian Geodetic Institute in 1871.[53]\r\n\r\nResults of observations with the Russian Repsold-Bessel pendulums were\r\npublished by the Imperial Academy of Sciences. In 1872, Prof. Sawitsch\r\nreported the work for western Europeans in \"Les variations de la\r\npesanteur dans les provinces occidentales de l'Empire russe.\"[48] In\r\nNovember 1873, the Austrian Geodetic Commission received a\r\nRepsold-Bessel reversible pendulum and on September 24, 1874, Prof.\r\nTheodor von Oppolzer reported on observations at Vienna and other\r\nstations to the Fourth General Conference of _Die Europaeische\r\nGradmessung_ in Dresden.[54] At the fourth session of the Conference, on\r\nSeptember 28, 1874, a Special Commission, consisting of Baeyer, as\r\nchairman, and Bruhns, Hirsch, von Oppolzer, Peters, and Albrecht, was\r\nappointed to consider (under Topic 3 of the program): \"Observations for\r\nthe determination of the intensity of gravity,\" the question, \"Which\r\nPendulum-apparatuses are preferable for the determination of many\r\npoints?\"\r\n\r\nAfter the adoption of the Repsold-Bessel reversible pendulum for gravity\r\ndeterminations in Europe, work in the field was begun by the U.S. Coast\r\nSurvey under the superintendency of Prof. Benjamin Peirce. There is\r\nmention in reports of observations with pendulums prior to Peirce's\r\ndirection to his son Charles on November 30, 1872, \"to take charge of\r\nthe Pendulum Experiments of the Coast Survey and to direct and inspect\r\nall parties engaged in such experiments and as often as circumstances\r\nwill permit, to take the field with a party....\"[55] Systematic and\r\nimportant gravity work by the Survey was begun by Charles Sanders\r\nPeirce. Upon receiving notice of his appointment, the latter promptly\r\nordered from the Repsolds a pendulum similar to the Prussian instrument.\r\nSince the firm of mechanicians was engaged in making instruments for\r\nobservations of the transit of Venus in 1874, the pendulum for the\r\nCoast Survey could not be constructed immediately. Meanwhile, during the\r\nyears 1873-1874, Charles Peirce conducted a party which made\r\nobservations of gravity in the Hoosac Tunnel near North Adams, and at\r\nNorthampton and Cambridge, Massachusetts. The pendulums used were\r\nnonreversible, invariable pendulums with conical bobs. Among them was a\r\nsilver pendulum, but similar pendulums of brass were used also.[56]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 17.--REPSOLD-BESSEL REVERSIBLE PENDULUM apparatus\r\nas made in 1875, and used in the gravity work of the U.S. Coast and\r\nGeodetic Survey. Continental geodesists continued to favor the general\r\nuse of convertible pendulums and absolute determinations of gravity,\r\nwhile their English colleagues had turned to invariable pendulums and\r\nrelative determinations, except for base stations. Perhaps the first\r\nimportant American contribution to gravity work was C. S. Peirce's\r\ndemonstration of the error inherent in the Repsold apparatus through\r\nflexure of the stand.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 18.--CHARLES SANDERS PEIRCE (1839-1914), son of\r\nBenjamin Peirce, Perkins Professor of Astronomy and Mathematics at\r\nHarvard College. C. S. Peirce graduated from Harvard in 1859. From 1873\r\nto 1891, as an assistant at the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, he\r\naccomplished the important gravimetric work described in this article.\r\nPeirce was also interested in many other fields, but above all in the\r\nlogic, philosophy, and history of science, in which he wrote\r\nextensively. His greatest fame is in philosophy, where he is regarded as\r\nthe founder of pragmatism.]\r\n\r\nIn 1874, Charles Peirce expressed the desire to be sent to Europe for at\r\nleast a year, beginning about March 1, 1875, \"to learn the use of the\r\nnew convertible pendulum and to compare it with those of the European\r\nmeasure of a Degree and the Swiss and to compare\" his \"invariable\r\npendulums in the manner which has been used by swinging them in London\r\nand Paris.\"[57]\r\n\r\nCharles S. Peirce, assistant, U.S. Coast Survey, sailed for Europe on\r\nApril 3, 1875, on his mission to obtain the Repsold-Bessel reversible\r\npendulum ordered for the Survey and to learn the methods of using it for\r\nthe determination of gravity. In England, he conferred with Maxwell,\r\nStokes, and Airy concerning the theory and practice of research with\r\npendulums. In May, he continued on to Hamburg and obtained delivery from\r\nthe Repsolds of the pendulum for the Coast Survey (fig. 17). Peirce then\r\nwent to Berlin and conferred with Gen. Baeyer, who expressed doubts of\r\nthe stability of the Repsold stand for the pendulum. Peirce next went to\r\nGeneva, where, under arrangements with Prof. Plantamour, he swung the\r\nnewly acquired pendulum at the observatory.[58]\r\n\r\nIn view of Baeyer's expressed doubts of the rigidity of the Repsold\r\nstand, Peirce performed experiments to measure the flexure of the stand\r\ncaused by the oscillations of the pendulum. His method was to set up a\r\nmicrometer in front of the pendulum stand and, with a microscope, to\r\nmeasure the displacement caused by a weight passing over a pulley, the\r\nfriction of which had been determined. Peirce calculated the correction\r\nto be applied to the length of the seconds pendulum--on account of the\r\nswaying of the stand during the swings of the pendulum--to amount to\r\nover 0.2 mm. Although Peirce's measurements of flexure in Geneva were\r\nnot as precise as his later measurements, he believed that failure to\r\ncorrect for flexure of the stand in determinations previously made with\r\nRepsold pendulums was responsible for appreciable errors in reported\r\nvalues of the length of the seconds pendulum.\r\n\r\nThe Permanent Commission of _Die Europaeische Gradmessung_ met in Paris,\r\nSeptember 20-29, 1875. In conjunction with this meeting, there was held\r\non September 21 a meeting of the Special Commission on the Pendulum. The\r\nbasis of the discussion by the Special Commission was provided by\r\nreports which had been submitted in response to a circular sent out by\r\nthe Central Bureau to the members on February 26, 1874.[59]\r\n\r\nGen. Baeyer stated that the distance of 1 meter between the knife edges\r\nof the Prussian Repsold-Bessel pendulum made it unwieldy and unsuited\r\nfor transport. He declared that the instability of the stand also was a\r\nsource of error. Accordingly, Gen. Baeyer expressed the opinion that\r\nabsolute determinations of gravity should be made at a control station\r\nby a reversible pendulum hung on a permanent, and therefore stable\r\nstand, and he said that relative values of gravity with respect to the\r\ncontrol station should be obtained in the field by means of a Bouguer\r\ninvariable pendulum. Dr. Bruhns and Dr. Peters agreed with Gen. Baeyer;\r\nhowever, the Swiss investigators, Prof. Plantamour and Dr. Hirsch\r\nreported in defense of the reversible pendulum as a field instrument, as\r\ndid Prof. von Oppolzer of Vienna. The circumstance that an invariable\r\npendulum is subject to changes in length was offered as an argument in\r\nfavor of the reversible pendulum as a field instrument.\r\n\r\nPeirce was present during these discussions by the members of the\r\nSpecial Commission, and he reported that his experiments at Geneva\r\ndemonstrated that the oscillations of the pendulum called forth a\r\nflexure of the support which hitherto had been neglected. The observers\r\nwho used the Swiss and Austrian Repsold pendulums contended, in\r\nopposition to Peirce, that the Repsold stand was stable.\r\n\r\nThe outcome of these discussions was that the Special Commission\r\nreported to the Permanent Commission that the Repsold-Bessel reversible\r\npendulum, except for some small changes, satisfied all requirements for\r\nthe determination of gravity. The Special Commission proposed that the\r\nRepsold pendulums of the several states be swung at the Prussian\r\nEichungsamt in Berlin where, as Peirce pointed out, Bessel had made his\r\ndetermination of the intensity of gravity with a ball pendulum in 1835.\r\nPeirce was encouraged to swing the Coast Survey reversible pendulum at\r\nthe stations in France, England, and Germany where Borda and Cassini,\r\nKater, and Bessel, respectively, had made historic determinations. The\r\nPermanent Commission, in whose sessions Peirce also participated, by\r\nresolutions adopted the report of the Special Commission on the\r\nPendulum.[60]\r\n\r\nDuring the months of January and February 1876, Peirce conducted\r\nobservations in the Grande Salle du Meridien at the observatory in Paris\r\nwhere Borda, Biot, and Capt. Edward Sabine had swung pendulums early in\r\nthe 19th century. He conducted observations in Berlin from April to June\r\n1876 and, by experiment, determined the correction for flexure to be\r\napplied to the value of gravity previously obtained with the Prussian\r\ninstrument. Subsequent observations were made at Kew. After his return\r\nto the United States on August 26, 1876, Peirce conducted experiments at\r\nthe Stevens Institute in Hoboken, New Jersey, where he made careful\r\nmeasurements of the flexure of the stand by statical and dynamical\r\nmethods. In Geneva, he had secured the construction of a vacuum chamber\r\nin which the pendulum could be swung on a support which he called the\r\nGeneva support. At the Stevens Institute, Peirce swung the\r\nRepsold-Bessel pendulum on the Geneva support and determined the effect\r\nof different pressures and temperatures on the period of oscillation of\r\nthe pendulum. These experiments continued into 1878.[61]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the Permanent Commission met October 5-10, 1876, in Brussels\r\nand continued the discussion of the pendulum.[62] Gen. Baeyer reported\r\non Peirce's experiments in Berlin to determine the flexure of the stand.\r\nThe difference of 0.18 mm. in the lengths of the seconds pendulum as\r\ndetermined by Bessel and as determined by the Repsold instrument agreed\r\nwith Peirce's estimate of error caused by neglect of flexure of the\r\nRepsold stand. Dr. Hirsch, speaking for the Swiss survey, and Prof. von\r\nOppolzer, speaking for the Austrian survey, contended, however, that\r\ntheir stands possessed sufficient stability and that the results found\r\nby Peirce applied only to the stands and bases investigated by him. The\r\nPermanent Commission proposed further study of the pendulum.\r\n\r\nThe Fifth General Conference of _Die Europaeische Gradmessung_ was held\r\nfrom September 27 to October 2, 1877, in Stuttgart.[63] Peirce had\r\ninstructions from Supt. Patterson of the U.S. Coast Survey to attend\r\nthis conference, and on arrival presented a letter of introduction from\r\nPatterson requesting that he, Peirce, be permitted to participate in the\r\nsessions. Upon invitation from Prof. Plantamour, as approved by Gen.\r\nIbanez, president of the Permanent Commission, Peirce had sent on July\r\n13, 1877, from New York, the manuscript of a memoir titled \"De\r\nl'Influence de la flexibilite du trepied sur l'oscillation du pendule a\r\nreversion.\" This memoir and others by Cellerier and Plantamour\r\nconfirming Peirce's work were published as appendices to the proceedings\r\nof the conference. As appendices to Peirce's contribution were published\r\nalso two notes by Prof. von Oppolzer. At the second session on September\r\n29, 1877, when Plantamour reported that the work of Hirsch and himself\r\nhad confirmed experimentally the independent theoretical work of\r\nCellerier and the theoretical and experimental work of Peirce on\r\nflexure, Peirce described his Hoboken experiments.\r\n\r\nDuring the discussions at Stuttgart on the flexure of the Repsold stand,\r\nHerve Faye, president of the Bureau of Longitudes, Paris, suggested that\r\nthe swaying of the stand during oscillations of the pendulum could be\r\novercome by the suspension from one support of two similar pendulums\r\nwhich oscillated with equal amplitudes and in opposite phases. This\r\nproposal was criticized by Dr. Hirsch, who declared that exact\r\nobservation of passages of a \"double pendulum\" would be difficult and\r\nthat two pendulums swinging so close together would interfere with each\r\nother. The proposal of the double pendulum came up again at the meeting\r\nof the Permanent Commission at Geneva in 1879.[64] On February 17, 1879,\r\nPeirce had completed a paper \"On a Method of Swinging Pendulums for the\r\nDetermination of Gravity, Proposed by M. Faye.\" In this paper, Peirce\r\npresented the results of an analytical mechanical investigation of\r\nFaye's proposal. Peirce set up the differential equations, found the\r\nsolutions, interpreted them physically, and arrived at the conclusion\r\n\"that the suggestion of M. Faye ... is as sound as it is brilliant and\r\noffers some peculiar advantages over the existing method of swinging\r\npendulums.\"\r\n\r\nIn a report to Supt. Patterson, dated July 1879, Peirce stated: \"I think\r\nit is important before making a new pendulum apparatus to experiment\r\nwith Faye's proposed method.\"[65] He wrote further: \"The method proves\r\nto be perfectly sound in theory, and as it would greatly facilitate the\r\nwork it is probably destined eventually to prevail. We must\r\nunfortunately leave to other surveys the merit of practically testing\r\nand introducing the new method, as our appropriations are insufficient\r\nfor us to maintain the leading position in this matter, which we\r\notherwise might take.\" Copies of the published version of Peirce's\r\nremarks were sent to Europe. At a meeting of the Academy of Sciences in\r\nParis on September 1, 1879, Faye presented a report on Peirce's\r\nfindings.[66] The Permanent Commission met September 16-20, 1879, in\r\nGeneva. At the third session on September 19, by action of Gen. Baeyer,\r\ncopies of Peirce's paper on Faye's proposed method of swinging pendulums\r\nwere distributed. Dr. Hirsch again commented adversely on the proposal,\r\nbut moved that the question be investigated and reported on at the\r\ncoming General Conference. The Permanent Commission accepted the\r\nproposal of Dr. Hirsch, and Prof. Plantamour was named to report on the\r\nmatter at the General Conference. At Plantamour's request, Charles\r\nCellerier was appointed to join him, since the problem essentially was a\r\ntheoretical one.\r\n\r\nThe Sixth General Conference of _Die Europaeische Gradmessung_ met\r\nSeptember 13-16, 1880, in Munich.[67] Topic III, part 7 of the program\r\nwas entitled \"On Determinations of Gravity through pendulum\r\nobservations. Which construction of a pendulum apparatus corresponds\r\ncompletely to all requirements of science? Special report on the\r\npendulum.\"\r\n\r\nThe conference received a memoir by Cellerier[68] on the theory of the\r\ndouble pendulum and a report by Plantamour and Cellerier.[69]\r\nCellerier's mathematical analysis began with the equations of Peirce and\r\nused the latter's notation as far as possible. His general discussion\r\nincluded the results of Peirce, but he stated that the difficulties to\r\nbe overcome did not justify the employment of the \"double pendulum.\" He\r\npresented an alternative method of correcting for flexure based upon a\r\ntheory by which the flexure caused by the oscillation of a given\r\nreversible pendulum could be determined from the behavior of an\r\nauxiliary pendulum of the same length but of different weight. This\r\nmethod of correcting for flexure was recommended to the General\r\nConference by Plantamour and Cellerier in their joint report. At the\r\nfourth session of the conference on September 16, 1880, the problem of\r\nthe pendulum was discussed and, in consequence, a commission consisting\r\nof Faye, Helmholtz, Plantamour (replaced in 1882 by Hirsch), and von\r\nOppolzer was appointed to study apparatus suitable for relative\r\ndeterminations of gravity.\r\n\r\nThe Permanent Commission met September 11-15, 1882, at The Hague,[70]\r\nand at its last session appointed Prof. von Oppolzer to report to the\r\nSeventh General Conference on different forms of apparatus for the\r\ndetermination of gravity. The Seventh Conference met October 15-24,\r\n1883, in Rome,[71] and, at its eighth session, on October 22, received a\r\ncomprehensive, critical review from Prof. von Oppolzer entitled \"Ueber\r\ndie Bestimmung der Schwere mit Hilfe verschiedener Apparate.\"[72] Von\r\nOppolzer especially expounded the advantages of the Bessel reversible\r\npendulum, which compensated for air effects by symmetry of form if the\r\ntimes of swing for both positions were maintained between the same\r\namplitudes, and compensated for irregular knife edges by making them\r\ninterchangeable. Prof. von Oppolzer reviewed the problem of flexure of\r\nthe Repsold stand and stated that a solution in the right direction\r\nwas the proposal--made by Faye and theoretically pursued by Peirce--to\r\nswing two pendulums from the same stand with equal amplitudes and in\r\nopposite phases, but that the proposal was not practicable. He concluded\r\nthat for absolute determinations of gravity, the Bessel reversible\r\npendulum was highly appropriate if one swung two exemplars of different\r\nweight from the same stand for the elimination of flexure. Prof. von\r\nOppolzer's important report recognized that absolute determinations were\r\nless accurate than relative ones, and should be conducted only at\r\nspecial places.\r\n\r\nThe discussions initiated by Peirce's demonstration of the flexure of\r\nthe Repsold stand resulted, finally, in the abandonment of the plan to\r\nmake absolute determinations of gravity at all stations with the\r\nreversible pendulum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 19.--THREE PENDULUMS USED IN EARLY WORK at the\r\nU.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey. Shown on the left is the Peirce\r\ninvariable; center, the Peirce reversible; and, right, the Repsold\r\nreversible. Peirce designed the cylindrical pendulum in 1881-1882 to\r\nstudy the effect of air resistance according to the theory of G. G.\r\nStokes on the motion of a pendulum in a viscous field. Three examples of\r\nthe Peirce pendulums are in the U.S. National Museum.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPeirce and Defforges Invariable, Reversible Pendulums\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Repsold-Bessel reversible pendulum was designed and initially used\r\nto make absolute determinations of gravity not only at initial stations\r\nsuch as Kew, the observatory in Paris, and the Smithsonian Institution\r\nin Washington, D.C., but also at stations in the field. An invariable\r\npendulum with a single knife edge, however, is adequate for relative\r\ndeterminations. As we have seen, such invariable pendulums had been used\r\nby Bouguer and Kater, and after the experiences with the Repsold\r\napparatus had been recommended again by Baeyer for relative\r\ndeterminations. But an invariable pendulum is subject to uncontrollable\r\nchanges of length. Peirce proposed to detect such changes in an\r\ninvariable pendulum in the field by combining the invariable and\r\nreversible principles. He explained his proposal to Faye in a letter\r\ndated July 23, 1880, and he presented it on September 16, 1880, at the\r\nfourth session of the sixth General Conference of _Die Europaeische\r\nGradmessung_, in Munich.[73]\r\n\r\nAs recorded in the Proceedings of the Conference, Peirce wrote:\r\n\r\n    But I obviate it in making my pendulum both invariable and\r\n    reversible. Every alteration of the pendulum will be revealed\r\n    immediately by the change in the difference of the two periods\r\n    of oscillation in the two positions. Once discovered, it will be\r\n    taken account of by means of new measures of the distance\r\n    between the two supports.\r\n\r\nPeirce added that it seemed to him that if the reversible pendulum\r\nperhaps is not the best instrument to determine absolute gravity, it is,\r\non condition that it be truly invariable, the best to determine relative\r\ngravity. Peirce further stated that he would wish that the pendulum be\r\nformed of a tube of drawn brass with heavy plugs of brass equally drawn.\r\nThe cylinder would be terminated by two hemispheres; the knives would be\r\nattached to tongues fixed near the ends of the cylinder.\r\n\r\nDuring the years 1881 and 1882, four invariable, reversible pendulums\r\nwere made after the design of Peirce at the office of the U.S. Coast and\r\nGeodetic Survey in Washington, D.C. The report of the superintendent for\r\nthe year 1880-1881 states:\r\n\r\n    A new pattern of the reversible pendulum has been invented,\r\n    having its surface as nearly as convenient in the form of an\r\n    elongated ellipsoid. Three of these instruments have been\r\n    constructed, two having a distance of one meter between the\r\n    knife edges and the third a distance of one yard. It is proposed\r\n    to swing one of the meter pendulums at a temperature near 32 deg.\r\n    F. at the same time that the yard is swung at 60 deg. F., in order\r\n    to determine anew the relation between the yard and the meter.[74]\r\n\r\nThe report for 1881-1882 mentions four of these Peirce pendulums.\r\n\r\nA description of the Peirce invariable, reversible pendulums was given\r\nby Assistant E. D. Preston in \"Determinations of Gravity and the\r\nMagnetic Elements in Connection with the United States Scientific\r\nExpedition to the West Coast of Africa, 1889-90.\"[75] The invariable,\r\nreversible pendulum, Peirce no. 4, now preserved in the Smithsonian\r\nInstitution's Museum of History and Technology (fig. 34), may be taken\r\nas typical of the meter pendulums: In the same memoir, Preston gives the\r\ndiameter of the tube as 63.7 mm., thickness of tube 1.5 mm., weight\r\n10.680 kilograms, and distance between the knives 1.000 meter.\r\n\r\nThe combination of invariability and reversibility in the Peirce\r\npendulums was an innovation for relative determinations. Indeed, the\r\ncombination was criticized by Maj. J. Herschel, R.E., of the Indian\r\nSurvey, at a conference on gravity held in Washington in May 1882 on the\r\noccasion of his visit to the United States for the purpose of\r\nconnecting English and American stations by relative determinations with\r\nthree Kater invariable pendulums. These three pendulums have been\r\ndesignated as nos. 4, 6 (1821), and 11.[76]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 20.--SUPPORT FOR THE PEIRCE PENDULUM, 1889. Much\r\nof the work of C. S. Peirce was concerned with the determination of the\r\nerror introduced into observations made with the portable apparatus by\r\nthe vibration of the stand with the pendulum. He showed that the popular\r\nBessel-Repsold apparatus was subject to such an error. His own pendulums\r\nwere swung from a simple but rugged wooden frame to which a hardened\r\nsteel bearing was fixed.]\r\n\r\nAnother novel characteristic of the Peirce pendulums was the mainly\r\ncylindrical form. Prof. George Gabriel Stokes, in a paper \"On the Effect\r\nof the Internal Friction of Fluids on the Motion of Pendulums\"[77] that\r\nwas read to the Cambridge Philosophical Society on December 9, 1850, had\r\nsolved the hydrodynamical equations to obtain the resistance to the\r\nmotions of a sphere and a cylinder in a viscous fluid. Peirce had\r\nstudied the effect of viscous resistance on the motion of his\r\nRepsold-Bessel pendulum, which was symmetrical in form but not\r\ncylindrical. The mainly cylindrical form of his pendulums (fig. 19)\r\npermitted Peirce to predict from Stokes' theory the effect of viscosity\r\nand to compare the results with experiment. His report of November 20,\r\n1889, in which he presented the comparison of experimental results with\r\nthe theory of Stokes, was not published.[78]\r\n\r\nPeirce used his pendulums in 1883 to establish a station at the\r\nSmithsonian Institution that was to serve as the base station for the\r\nCoast and Geodetic Survey for some years. Pendulum Peirce no. 1 was\r\nswung at Washington in 1881 and was then taken by the party of\r\nLieutenant Greely, U.S.A., on an expedition to Lady Franklin Bay where\r\nit was swung in 1882 at Fort Conger, Grinnell Land, Canada. Peirce nos.\r\n2 and 3 were swung by Peirce in 1882 at Washington, D.C.; Hoboken, New\r\nJersey; Montreal, Canada; and Albany, New York. Assistant Preston took\r\nPeirce no. 3 on a U.S. eclipse expedition to the Caroline Islands in\r\n1883. Peirce in 1885 swung pendulums nos. 2 and 3 at Ann Arbor,\r\nMichigan; Madison, Wisconsin; and Ithaca, New York. Assistant Preston in\r\n1887 swung Peirce nos. 3 and 4 at stations in the Hawaiian Islands, and\r\nin 1890 he swung Peirce nos. 3 and 4 at stations on the west coast of\r\nAfrica.[79]\r\n\r\nThe new pattern of pendulum designed by Peirce was also adopted in\r\nFrance, after some years of experience with a Repsold-Bessel pendulum.\r\nPeirce in 1875 had swung his Repsold-Bessel pendulum at the observatory\r\nin Paris, where Borda and Cassini, and Biot, had made historic\r\nobservations and where Sabine also had determined gravity by comparison\r\nwith Kater's value at London. During the spring of 1880, Peirce made\r\nstudies of the supports for the pendulums of these earlier\r\ndeterminations and calculated corrections to those results for\r\nhydrodynamic effects, viscosity, and flexure. On June 14, 1880, Peirce\r\naddressed the Academy of Sciences, Paris, on the value of gravity at\r\nParis, and compared his results with the corrected results of Borda and\r\nBiot and with the transferred value of Kater.[80]\r\n\r\nIn the same year the French Geographic Service of the Army acquired a\r\nRepsold-Bessel reversible pendulum of the smaller type, and Defforges\r\nconducted experiments with it.[81] He introduced the method of measuring\r\nflexure from the movement of interference fringes during motion of the\r\npendulum. He found an appreciable difference between dynamical and\r\nstatical coefficients of flexure and concluded that the \"correction\r\nformula of Peirce and Cellerier is suited perfectly to practice and\r\nrepresents exactly the variation of period caused by swaying of the\r\nsupport, on the condition that one uses the statical coefficient.\"\r\nDefforges developed a theory for the employment of two similar pendulums\r\nof the same weight, but of different length, and hung by the same\r\nknives. This theory eliminated the flexure of the support and the\r\ncurvature of the knives from the reduction of observations.\r\n\r\nPendulums of 1-meter and of 1/2-meter distance between the knife edges\r\nwere constructed from Defforges' design by Brunner Brothers in Paris\r\n(fig. 21). These Defforges pendulums were cylindrical in form with\r\nhemispherical ends like the Peirce pendulums, and were hung on knives\r\nthat projected from the sides of the pendulum, as in some unfinished\r\nGautier pendulums designed by Peirce in 1883 in Paris.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 21.--REVERSIBLE PENDULUM APPARATUS of Defforges,\r\nas constructed by Brunner, Paris, about 1887. The clock and telescope\r\nused to observe coincidences are not shown. The telescope shown is part\r\nof an interferometer used to measure flexure of the support. One mirror\r\nof the interferometer is attached to the pendulum support; the other to\r\nthe separate masonry pillar at the left.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 22.--BECAUSE OF THE GREATER SIMPLICITY of its use,\r\nthe invariable pendulum superseded the convertible pendulum towards the\r\nend of the 19th century, except at various national base stations (Kew,\r\nParis, Potsdam, Washington, D.C., etc.). Shown here are, right to left,\r\na pendulum of the type used by Peirce at the Hoosac Tunnel in 1873-74,\r\nthe Mendenhall 1/2-second pendulum of 1890, and the pendulum designed by\r\nPeirce in 1881-1882.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 23.--THE OVERALL SIZE of portable pendulum\r\napparatus was greatly reduced with the introduction of this 1/2-second\r\napparatus in 1887, by the Austrian military officer, Robert von\r\nSterneck. Used with a vacuum chamber not shown here, the apparatus is\r\nonly about 2 feet high. Coincidences are observed by the reflection of a\r\nperiodic electric spark in two mirrors, one on the support and the other\r\non the pendulum itself.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 24.--THOMAS C. MENDENHALL (1841-1924). Although\r\nlargely self-educated, he became the first professor of physics and\r\nmechanics at the Ohio Agricultural and Mechanical College (later Ohio\r\nState University), and was subsequently connected with several other\r\nuniversities. In 1878, while teaching at the Tokyo Imperial University\r\nin Japan, he made gravity measurements between Tokyo and Fujiyama from\r\nwhich he calculated the mean density of the earth. While superintendent\r\nof the U.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey, 1889-94, he developed the\r\npendulum apparatus which bears his name.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nVon Sterneck and Mendenhall Pendulums\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile scientists who had used the Repsold-Bessel pendulum apparatus\r\ndiscussed its defects and limitations for gravity surveys, Maj. Robert\r\nvon Sterneck of Austria-Hungary began to develop an excellent apparatus\r\nfor the rapid determination of relative values of gravity.[82] Maj. von\r\nSterneck's apparatus contained a nonreversible pendulum 1/4-meter in\r\nlength, and 1/2-second time of swing. The pendulum was hung by a single\r\nknife edge, which rested on a plate that was supported by a tripod. The\r\npendulum was swung in a chamber from which air was exhausted and which\r\ncould be maintained at any desired temperature. Times of swing were\r\ndetermined by the observation of coincidences of the pendulum with\r\nchronometer signals. In the final form a small mirror was attached to\r\nthe knife edge perpendicular to the plane of vibration of the pendulum\r\nand a second fixed mirror was placed close to it so that the two mirrors\r\nwere parallel when the pendulum was at rest. The chronometer signals\r\nworked a relay that gave a horizontal spark which was reflected into the\r\ntelescope from the mirrors. When the pendulum was at rest, the image of\r\nthe spark in both mirrors appeared on the horizontal cross wire in the\r\ntelescope, and during oscillation of the pendulum the two images\r\nappeared in that position upon coincidence. In view of the reduced size\r\nof the pendulum, the chamber in which it was swung was readily portable,\r\nand with an improved method of observing coincidences, relative\r\ndeterminations of gravity could be made with rapidity and accuracy.\r\n\r\nBy 1887 Maj. von Sterneck had perfected his apparatus, and it was widely\r\nadopted in Europe for relative determinations of gravity. He used his\r\napparatus in extensive gravity surveys and also applied it in the silver\r\nmines in Saxony and Bohemia, by the previously described methods of\r\nAiry, for investigations into the internal constitution of the earth.\r\n\r\nOn July 1, 1889, Thomas Corwin Mendenhall became superintendent of the\r\nU.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey. Earlier, he had been professor of\r\nphysics at the University of Tokyo and had directed observations of\r\npendulums for the determination of gravity on Fujiyama and at Tokyo.\r\nSupt. Mendenhall, with the cooperation of members of his staff in\r\nWashington, designed a new pendulum apparatus of the Von Sterneck type,\r\nand in October 1890 he ordered construction of the first model.[83]\r\n\r\nLike the Von Sterneck apparatus, the Mendenhall pendulum apparatus\r\nemployed a nonreversible, invariable pendulum 1/4-meter in length and of\r\nslightly more than 1/2-second in time of swing. Initially, the knife\r\nedge was placed in the head of the pendulum and hung on a fixed plane\r\nsupport, but after some experimentation Mendenhall attached the plane\r\nsurface to the pendulum and hung it on a fixed knife edge. An apparatus\r\nwas provided with a set of three pendulums, so that if discrepancies\r\nappeared in the results, the pendulum at fault could be detected. There\r\nwas also a dummy pendulum which carried a thermometer. A pendulum was\r\nswung in a receiver in which the pressure and temperature of the air\r\nwere controlled. The time of swing was measured by coincidences with the\r\nbeat of a chronometer. The coincidences were determined by an optical\r\nmethod with the aid of a flash apparatus.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 25.--MENDENHALL'S 1/4-METER (1/2-SECOND)\r\nAPPARATUS. Shown on the left is the flash apparatus and, on the right,\r\nthe vacuum chamber within which the pendulum is swung. The flash\r\napparatus consists of a kerosene lantern and a telescope, mounted on a\r\nbox containing an electromagnetically operated shutter. The operation of\r\nthe shutter is controlled by a chronograph (not shown), so that it emits\r\na slit of light at regular intervals. The telescope is focused on two\r\nmirrors within the apparatus, one fixed, the other attached to the top\r\nof the pendulum. It is used to observe the reflection of the flashes\r\nfrom these mirrors. When the two reflections are aligned, a\r\n\"coincidence\" is marked on the chronograph tape. The second telescope\r\nattached to the bottom of the vacuum chamber is for observing the\r\namplitude of the pendulum swing.]\r\n\r\nThe flash apparatus was contained in a light metal box which supported\r\nan observing telescope and which was mounted on a stand. Within the box\r\nwas an electromagnet whose coils were connected with a chronometer\r\ncircuit and whose armature carried a long arm that moved two shutters,\r\nin both of which were horizontal slits of the same size. The shutters\r\nwere behind the front face of the box, which also had a horizontal slit.\r\nA flash of light from an oil lamp or an electric spark was emitted from\r\nthe box when the circuit was broken, but not when it was closed. When\r\nthe circuit was broken a spring caused the arm to rise, and the shutters\r\nwere actuated so that the three slits came into line and a flash of\r\nlight was emitted. A small circular mirror was set in each side of the\r\npendulum head, so that from either face of the pendulum the image of the\r\nilluminated slit could be reflected into the field of the observing\r\ntelescope. A similar mirror was placed parallel to these two mirrors and\r\nrigidly attached to the support. The chronometer signals broke the\r\ncircuit, causing the three slits momentarily to be in line, and when the\r\nimages of the slit in the two mirrors coincided, a coincidence was\r\nobserved. A coincidence occurred whenever the pendulum gained or lost\r\none oscillation on the beat of the chronometer. The relative intensity\r\nof gravity was determined by observations with the first Mendenhall\r\napparatus at Washington, D.C., at stations on the Pacific Coast and in\r\nAlaska, and at the Stevens Institute, Hoboken, New Jersey, between March\r\nand October 1891.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 26.--VACUUM RECEIVER within which the Mendenhall\r\npendulum is swung. The pressure is reduced to about 50 mm. to reduce the\r\ndisturbing effect of air resistance. When the apparatus is sealed, the\r\npendulum is lifted on the knife edge by the lever _q_ and is started to\r\nswing by the lever _r_. The arc of swing is only about 1 deg. The\r\nstationary mirror is shown at _g_. The pendulum shown in outline in the\r\ncenter, is only about 9.7 inches long.]\r\n\r\nUnder Supt. Mendenhall's direction a smaller, 1/4-second, pendulum\r\napparatus was also constructed and tested, but did not offer advantages\r\nover the 1/2-second apparatus, which therefore continued in use.\r\n\r\nIn accordance with Peirce's theory of the flexure of the stand under\r\noscillations of the pendulum, determinations of the displacement of the\r\nreceiver of the Mendenhall apparatus were part of a relative\r\ndetermination of gravity by members of the Coast and Geodetic Survey.\r\nInitially, a statical method was used, but during 1908-1909 members of\r\nthe Survey adapted the Michelson interferometer for the determinations\r\nof flexure during oscillations from the shift of fringes.[84] The first\r\nMendenhall pendulums were made of bronze, but about 1920 invar was\r\nchosen because of its small coefficient of expansion. About 1930, Lt. E.\r\nJ. Brown of the Coast and Geodetic Survey made significant improvements\r\nin the Mendenhall apparatus, and the new form came to be known as the\r\nBrown Pendulum Apparatus.[85]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 27.--THE MICHELSON INTERFEROMETER. The horizontal\r\ncomponent of the force acting on the knife edge through the swinging\r\npendulum causes the support to move in unison with the pendulum, and\r\nthereby affects the period of the oscillation. This movement is the\r\nso-called flexure of the pendulum support, and must be taken into\r\naccount in the most accurate observations.\r\n\r\nIn 1907, the Michelson interferometer was adapted to this purpose by the\r\nU.S. Coast and Geodetic Survey. As shown here, the interferometer,\r\nresting on a wooden beam, is introduced into the path of a light beam\r\nreflected from a mirror on the vacuum chamber. Movement of that mirror\r\ncauses a corresponding movement in the interference fringes in the\r\ninterferometer, which can be measured.]\r\n\r\nThe original Von Sterneck apparatus and that of Mendenhall provided for\r\nthe oscillation of one pendulum at a time. After the adoption of the Von\r\nSterneck pendulum in Europe, there were developed stands on which two or\r\nfour pendulums hung at the same time. This procedure provided a\r\nconvenient way to observe more than one invariable pendulum at a station\r\nfor the purpose of detecting changes in length. Prof. M. Haid of\r\nKarlsruhe in 1896 described a four-pendulum apparatus,[86] and Dr.\r\nSchumann of Potsdam subsequently described a two-pendulum\r\napparatus.[87]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 28.--APPARATUS WHICH WAS DEVELOPED IN 1929 by the\r\nGulf Research and Development Company, Harmarville, Pennsylvania. It was\r\ndesigned to achieve an accuracy within one ten-millionth of the true\r\nvalue of gravity, and represents the extreme development of pendulum\r\napparatus for relative gravity measurement. The pendulum was designed so\r\nthat the period would be a minimum. The case (the top is missing in this\r\nphotograph) is dehumidified and its temperature and electrostatic\r\ncondition are controlled. Specially designed pendulum-lifting and\r\n-starting mechanisms are used. The problem of flexure of the case is\r\novercome by the Faye-Peirce method (see text) in which two dynamically\r\nmatched pendulums are swung simultaneously, 180 deg. apart in phase.]\r\n\r\nThe multiple-pendulum apparatus then provided a method of determining\r\nthe flexure of the stand from the action of one pendulum upon a second\r\npendulum hung on the same stand. This method of determining the\r\ncorrection for flexure was a development from a \"Wippverfahren\" invented\r\nat the Geodetic Institute in Potsdam. A dynamometer was used to impart\r\nperiodic impulses to the stand, and the effect was observed upon a\r\npendulum initially at rest. Refinements of this method led to the\r\ndevelopment of a method used by Lorenzoni in 1885-1886 to determine the\r\nflexure of the stand by action of an auxiliary pendulum upon the\r\nprincipal pendulum. Dr. Schumann, in 1899, gave a mathematical theory of\r\nsuch determinations,[88] and in his paper cited the mathematical methods\r\nof Peirce and Cellerier for the theory of Faye's proposal at Stuttgart\r\nin 1877 to swing two similar pendulums on the same support with equal\r\namplitudes and in opposite phases.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 29.--THE GULF PENDULUM is about 10.7 inches long,\r\nand has a period of .89 second. It is made of fused quartz which is\r\nresistant to the influence of temperature change and to the earth's\r\nmagnetism. Quartz pendulums are subject to the influence of\r\nelectrostatic charge, and provision is made to counteract this through\r\nthe presence of a radium salt in the case. The bearings are made of\r\nPyrex glass.]\r\n\r\nIn 1902, Dr. P. Furtwaengler[89] presented the mathematical theory of\r\ncoupled pendulums in a paper in which he referred to Faye's proposal of\r\n1877 and reported that the difficulties predicted upon its application\r\nhad been found not to occur. Finally, during the gravity survey of\r\nHolland in the years 1913-1921, in view of instability of supports\r\ncaused by the mobility of the soil, F. A. Vening Meinesz adopted Faye's\r\nproposed method of swinging two pendulums on the same support.[90] The\r\nobservations were made with the ordinary Stueckrath apparatus, in which\r\nfour Von Sterneck pendulums swung two by two in planes perpendicular to\r\neach other. This successful application of the method--which had been\r\nproposed by Faye and had been demonstrated theoretically to be sound by\r\nPeirce, who also published a design for its application--was rapidly\r\nfollowed for pendulum apparatus for relative determinations by\r\nPotsdam,[91] Cambridge (England),[92] Gulf Oil and Development\r\nCompany,[93] and the Dominion Observatory at Ottawa.[94] Heiskanen and\r\nVening Meinesz state:\r\n\r\n    The best way to eliminate the effect of flexure is to use two\r\n    synchronized pendulums of the same length swinging on the same\r\n    apparatus in the same plane and with the same amplitudes but in\r\n    opposite phases; it is clear then the flexure is zero.[95]\r\n\r\nIn view of the fact that the symmetrical reversible pendulum is named\r\nfor Bessel, who created the theory and a design for its application by\r\nRepsold, it appears appropriate to call the method of eliminating\r\nflexure by swinging two pendulums on the same support the Faye-Peirce\r\nmethod. Its successful application was made possible by Maj. von\r\nSterneck's invention of the short, 1/4-meter pendulum.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 30.--THE ACCUMULATED DATA OF GRAVITY observations\r\nover the earth's surface have indicated that irregularities such as\r\nmountains do not have the effect which would be expected in modifying\r\ngravity, but are somehow compensated for. The most satisfactory solution\r\nto this still unanswered question has been the theory of isostasy,\r\naccording to which variations in the density of the material in the\r\nearth's crust produce a kind of hydrostatic equilibrium between its\r\nhigher and lower parts, as they \"float\" on the earth's fluid core. The\r\nmetals of different density floating in mercury in this diagram\r\nillustrate isostasy according to the theory of Pratt and Hayford.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAbsolute Value of Gravity at Potsdam\r\n\r\n\r\nThe development of the reversible pendulum in the 19th century\r\nculminated in the absolute determination of the intensity of gravity at\r\nPotsdam by Kuehnen and Furtwaengler of the Royal Prussian Geodetic\r\nInstitute, which then became the world base for gravity surveys.[96]\r\n\r\nWe have previously seen that in 1869 the Geodetic Institute--founded by\r\nLt. Gen. Baeyer--had acquired a Repsold-Bessel reversible pendulum which\r\nwas swung by Dr. Albrecht under the direction of Dr. Bruhns.\r\nDissatisfaction with this instrument was expressed by Baeyer in 1875 to\r\nCharles S. Peirce, who then, by experiment and mathematical analysis of\r\nthe flexure of the stand under oscillations of the pendulum, determined\r\nthat previously reported results with the Repsold apparatus required\r\ncorrection. Dr. F. R. Helmert, who in 1887 succeeded Baeyer as director\r\nof the Institute, secured construction of a building for the Institute\r\nin Potsdam, and under his direction the scientific study of the\r\nintensity of gravity was pursued with vigor. In 1894, it was discovered\r\nin Potsdam that a pendulum constructed of very flexible material yielded\r\nresults which differed markedly from those obtained with pendulums of\r\ngreater stiffness. Dr. Kuehnen of the Institute discovered that the\r\ndeparture from expectations was the result of the flexure of the\r\npendulum staff itself during oscillations.[97]\r\n\r\nPeirce, in 1883, had discovered that the recesses cut in his pendulums\r\nfor the insertion of tongues that carried the knives had resulted in the\r\nflexure of the pendulum staff.[98] By experiment, he also found an even\r\ngreater flexure for the Repsold pendulum. In order to eliminate this\r\nsource of error, Peirce designed a pendulum with knives that extended\r\nfrom each side of the cylindrical staff, and he received authorization\r\nfrom the superintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey to arrange for\r\nthe construction of such pendulums by Gautier in Paris. Peirce, who had\r\nmade his plans in consultation with Gautier, was called home before the\r\npendulums were completed, and these new instruments remained\r\nundelivered.\r\n\r\nIn a memoir titled \"Effect of the flexure of a pendulum upon its period\r\nof oscillation,\"[99] Peirce determined analytically the effect on the\r\nperiod of a pendulum with a single elastic connection between two rigid\r\nparts of the staff. Thus, Peirce discovered experimentally the flexure\r\nof the staff and derived for a simplified case the effect on the period.\r\nIt is not known if he ever found the integrated effect of the continuum\r\nof elastic connections in the pendulum. Lorenzoni, in 1896, offered a\r\nsolution to the problem, and Almansi, in 1899, gave an extended\r\nanalysis. After the independent discovery of the problem at the Geodetic\r\nInstitute, Dr. Helmert took up the problem and criticized the theories\r\nof Peirce and Lorenzoni. He then presented his own theory of flexure in\r\na comprehensive memoir.[100] In view of the previous neglect of the\r\nflexure of the pendulum staff in the reduction of observations, Helmert\r\ndirected that the Geodetic Institute make a new absolute determination\r\nof the intensity of gravity at Potsdam. For this purpose, Kuehnen and\r\nFurtwaengler used the following reversible pendulums which had been\r\nconstructed by the firm of A. Repsold and Sons in Hamburg:\r\n\r\n    1. The seconds pendulum of the Geodetic Institute procured in\r\n    1869.\r\n\r\n    2. A seconds pendulum from the Astronomical Observatory, Padua.\r\n\r\n    3. A heavy, seconds pendulum from the Imperial and Royal\r\n    Military-Geographical Institute, Vienna.\r\n\r\n    4. A light, seconds pendulum from the Imperial and Royal\r\n    Military-Geographical Institute.\r\n\r\n    5. A 1/2-second, reversible pendulum of the Geodetic Institute\r\n    procured in 1892.\r\n\r\nWork was begun in 1898, and in 1906 Kuehnen and Furtwaengler published\r\ntheir monumental memoir, \"Bestimmung der Absoluten Groesze der\r\nSchwerkraft zu Potsdam mit Reversionspendeln.\"\r\n\r\nThe acceleration of gravity in the pendulum room of the Geodetic\r\nInstitute was determined to be 981.274 +- 0.003 cm/sec^{2}. In view of the\r\nexceptionally careful and thorough determination at the Institute,\r\nPotsdam was accepted as the world base for the absolute value of the\r\nintensity of gravity. The absolute value of gravity at some other\r\nstation on the Potsdam system was determined from the times of swing of\r\nan invariable pendulum at the station and at Potsdam by the relation\r\n(T_{1})^{2}/(T_{2})^{2} = g_{2}/g_{1}. Thus, in 1900, Assistant G. R.\r\nPutnam of the Coast and Geodetic Survey swung Mendenhall pendulums at\r\nthe Washington base and at Potsdam, and by transfer from Potsdam\r\ndetermined the intensity of gravity at the Washington base to be 980.112\r\ncm/sec^{2}.[101] In 1933, Lt. E. J. Brown made comparative measurements\r\nwith improved apparatus and raised the value at the Washington base to\r\n980.118 cm/sec^{2}.[102]\r\n\r\nIn view of discrepancies between the results of various relative\r\ndeterminations, the Coast and Geodetic Survey in 1928 requested the\r\nNational Bureau of Standards to make an absolute determination for\r\nWashington. Heyl and Cook used reversible pendulums made of fused silica\r\nhaving a period of approximately 1 second. Their result, published in\r\n1936, was interpreted to indicate that the value at Potsdam was too high\r\nby 20 parts in 1 million.[103] This estimate was lowered slightly by Sir\r\nHarold Jeffreys of Cambridge, England, who recomputed the results of\r\nHeyl and Cook by different methods.[104]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 31.--MAP SHOWING THE DISTRIBUTION of gravity\r\nstations throughout the United States as of December 1908.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 32.--MAP SHOWING THE DISTRIBUTION of gravity\r\nstations throughout the United States in 1923.]\r\n\r\nIn 1939, J. S. Clark published the results of a determination of gravity\r\nwith pendulums of a non-ferrous Y-alloy[105] at the National Physical\r\nLaboratory at Teddington, England, and, after recomputation of results\r\nby Jeffreys, the value was found to be 12.8 parts in 1 million less than\r\nthe value obtained by transfer from Potsdam. Dr. Hugh L. Dryden of the\r\nNational Bureau of Standards, and Dr. A. Berroth of the Geodetic\r\nInstitute at Potsdam, have recomputed the Potsdam data by different\r\nmethods of adjustment and concluded that the Potsdam value was too high\r\nby about 12 parts in a million.[106] Determination of gravity at\r\nLeningrad by Russian scientists likewise has indicated that the 1906\r\nPotsdam value is too high. In the light of present information, it\r\nappears justifiable to reduce the Potsdam value of 981.274 by .013\r\ncm/sec^{2} for purposes of comparison. If the Brown transfer from\r\nPotsdam in 1933 was taken as accurate, the value for the Washington base\r\nwould be 980.105 cm/sec^{2}. In this connection, it is of interest to\r\nnote that the value given by Charles S. Peirce for the comparable\r\nSmithsonian base in Washington, as determined by him from comparative\r\nmethods in the 1880's and reported in the _Annual Report of the\r\nSuperintendent of the Coast and Geodetic Survey for the year 1890-1891_,\r\nwas 980.1017 cm/sec^{2}.[107] This value would appear to indicate that\r\nPeirce's pendulums, observations, and methods of reduction of data were\r\nnot inferior to those of the scientists of the Royal Prussian Geodetic\r\nInstitute at Potsdam.\r\n\r\nDoubts concerning the accuracy of the Potsdam value of gravity have\r\nstimulated many new determinations of the intensity of gravity since the\r\nend of World War II. In a paper published in June 1957, A. H. Cook,\r\nMetrology Division, National Physical Laboratory, Teddington, England,\r\nstated:\r\n\r\n    At present about a dozen new absolute determinations are in\r\n    progress or are being planned. Heyl and Cook's reversible\r\n    pendulum apparatus is in use in Buenos Aires and further\r\n    reversible pendulum experiments have been made in the All Union\r\n    Scientific Research Institute of Metrology, Leningrad (V N I I M)\r\n    and are planned at Potsdam. A method using a very long pendulum\r\n    was tried out in Russia about 1910 and again more recently and\r\n    there are plans for similar work in Finland. The first\r\n    experiment with a freely falling body was that carried out by\r\n    Volet who photographed a graduated scale falling in an enclosure\r\n    at low air pressure. Similar experiments have been completed in\r\n    Leningrad and are in progress at the Physikalisch-Technische\r\n    Bundesanstalt (Brunswick) and at the National Research Council\r\n    (Ottawa), and analogous experiments are being prepared at the\r\n    National Physical Laboratory and at the National Bureau of\r\n    Standards. Finally, Professor Medi, Director of the Istituto\r\n    Nazionale di Geofisica (Rome), is attempting to measure the\r\n    focal length of the paraboloidal surface of a liquid in a\r\n    rotating dish.[108]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nApplication of Gravity Surveys\r\n\r\n\r\nWe have noted previously that in the ancient and early modern periods,\r\nthe earth was presupposed to be spherical in form. Determination of the\r\nfigure of the earth consisted in the measurement of the radius by the\r\nastronomical-geodetic method invented by Eratosthenes. Since the earth\r\nwas assumed to be spherical, gravity was inferred to be constant over\r\nthe surface of the earth. This conclusion appeared to be confirmed by\r\nthe determination of the length of the seconds pendulum at various\r\nstations in Europe by Picard and others. The observations of Richer in\r\nSouth America, the theoretical discussions of Newton and Huygens, and\r\nthe measurements of degrees of latitude in Peru and Sweden demonstrated\r\nthat the earth is an oblate spheroid.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 33.--GRAVITY CHARACTERISTICS OF THE GLOBE.\r\nDeductions as to the distribution of matter in the earth can be made\r\nfrom gravity measurements. This globe shows worldwide variations in\r\ngravity as they now appear from observations at sea (in submarines) as\r\nwell as on land. It is based on data from the Institute of Geodesy at\r\nOhio State University.]\r\n\r\nThe theory of gravitation and the theory of central forces led to the\r\nresult that the intensity of gravity is variable over the surface of the\r\nearth. Accordingly, determinations of the intensity of gravity became\r\nof value to the geodesist as a means of determining the figure of the\r\nearth. Newton, on the basis of the meager data available to him,\r\ncalculated the ellipticity of the earth to be 1/230 (the ellipticity is\r\ndefined by (a-b)/a, where a is the equatorial radius and b the polar\r\nradius). Observations of the intensity of gravity were made on the\r\nhistoric missions to Peru and Sweden. Bouguer and La Condamine found\r\nthat at the equator at sea level the seconds pendulum was 1.26\r\nParis-lines shorter than at Paris. Maupertuis found that in northern\r\nSweden a certain pendulum clock gained 59.1 seconds per day on its rate\r\nin Paris. Then Clairaut, from the assumption that the earth is a\r\nspheroid of equilibrium, derived a theorem from which the ellipticity of\r\nthe earth can be derived from values of the intensity of gravity.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Figure 34.--AN EXHIBIT OF GRAVITY APPARATUS at the\r\nSmithsonian Institution. Suspended on the wall, from left to right, are\r\nthe invariable pendulums of Mendenhall (1/2-second), Peirce (1873-1874),\r\nand Peirce (1881-1882); the double pendulum of Edward Kuebel (see fig.\r\n15, p. 319), and the reversible pendulum of Peirce. On the display\r\ncounter, from left to right, are the vacuum chamber, telescope and flash\r\napparatus for the Mendenhall 1/4-second apparatus. Shown below these are\r\nthe four pendulums used with the Mendenhall apparatus, the one on the\r\nright having a thermometer attached. At bottom, right, is the Gulf\r\napparatus (cover removed) mentioned in the text, shown with one quartz\r\npendulum.]\r\n\r\nEarly in the 19th century a systematic series of observations began to\r\nbe conducted in order to determine the intensity of gravity at stations\r\nall over the world. Kater invariable pendulums, of which 13 examples\r\nhave been mentioned in the literature, were used in surveys of gravity\r\nby Kater, Sabine, Goldingham, and other British pendulum swingers. As\r\nhas been noted previously, a Kater invariable pendulum was used by Adm.\r\nLuetke of Russia on a trip around the world. The French also sent out\r\nexpeditions to determine values of gravity. After several decades of\r\nrelative inactivity, Capts. Basevi and Heaviside of the Indian Survey\r\ncarried out an important series of observations from 1865 to 1873 with\r\nKater invariable pendulums and the Russian Repsold-Bessel pendulums. In\r\n1881-1882 Maj. J. Herschel swung Kater invariable pendulums nos. 4, 6\r\n(1821), and 11 at stations in England and then brought them to the\r\nUnited States in order to make observations which would connect American\r\nand English base stations.[109]\r\n\r\nThe extensive sets of observations of gravity provided the basis of\r\ncalculations of the ellipticity of the earth. Col. A. R. Clarke in his\r\n_Geodesy_ (London, 1880) calculated the ellipticity from the results of\r\ngravity surveys to be 1/(292.2 +- 1.5). Of interest is the calculation by\r\nCharles S. Peirce, who used only determinations made with Kater\r\ninvariable pendulums and corrected for elevation, atmospheric effect,\r\nand expansion of the pendulum through temperature.[110] He calculated\r\nthe ellipticity of the earth to be 1/(291.5 +- 0.9).\r\n\r\nThe 19th century witnessed the culmination of the ellipsoidal era of\r\ngeodesy, but the rapid accumulation of data made possible a better\r\napproximation to the figure of the earth by the geoid. The geoid is\r\ndefined as the average level of the sea, which is thought of as extended\r\nthrough the continents. The basis of geodetic calculations, however, is\r\nan ellipsoid of reference for which a gravity formula expresses the\r\nvalue of normal gravity at a point on the ellipsoid as a function of\r\ngravity at sea level at the equator, and of latitude. The general\r\nassembly of the International Union of Geodesy and Geophysics, which was\r\nfounded after World War I to continue the work of _Die Internationale\r\nErdmessung_, adopted in 1924 an international reference ellipsoid,[111]\r\nof which the ellipticity, or flattening, is Hayford's value 1/297. In\r\n1930, the general assembly adopted a correlated International Gravity\r\nFormula of the form\r\n\r\n[gamma] = [gamma]_{E}(1 + [beta]sin^{2} [phi] + [epsilon]sin^{2} 2[phi])\r\n\r\nwhere [gamma] is normal gravity at latitude [phi], [gamma]_{E} is the\r\nvalue of gravity at sea level at the equator, [beta] is a parameter\r\nwhich is computed on the basis of Clairaut's theorem from the flattening\r\nvalue of the meridian, and [epsilon] is a constant which is derived\r\ntheoretically. The plumb line is perpendicular to the geoid, and the\r\ncomponents of angle between the perpendiculars to geoid and reference\r\nellipsoid are deflections of the vertical. The geoid is above the\r\nellipsoid of reference under mountains and it is below the ellipsoid on\r\nthe oceans, where the geoid coincides with mean sea level. In physical\r\ngeodesy, gravimetric data are used for the determination of the geoid\r\nand components of deflections of the vertical. For this purpose, one\r\nmust reduce observed values of gravity to sea level by various\r\nreductions, such as free-air, Bouguer, isostatic reductions. If g_{0} is\r\nobserved gravity reduced to sea level and [gamma] is normal gravity\r\nobtained from the International Gravity Formula, then\r\n\r\n  [Delta]g = g_{0} - [gamma]\r\n\r\nis the gravity anomaly.[112]\r\n\r\nIn 1849, Stokes derived a theorem whereby the distance N of the geoid\r\nfrom the ellipsoid of reference can be obtained from an integration of\r\ngravity anomalies over the surface of the earth. Vening Meinesz further\r\nderived formulae for the calculation of components of the deflection of\r\nthe vertical.\r\n\r\nGeometrical geodesy, which was based on astronomical-geodetic methods,\r\ncould give information only concerning the external form of the figure\r\nof the earth. The gravimetric methods of physical geodesy, in\r\nconjunction with methods such as those of seismology, enable scientists\r\nto test hypotheses concerning the internal structure of the earth.\r\nHeiskanen and Vening Meinesz summarize the present-day achievements of\r\nthe gravimetric method of physical geodesy by stating[113] that it\r\nalone can give:\r\n\r\n    1. The flattening of the reference ellipsoid.\r\n\r\n    2. The undulations N of the geoid.\r\n\r\n    3. The components of the deflection of the vertical [xi] and\r\n    [eta] at any point, oceans and islands included.\r\n\r\n    4. The conversion of existing geodetic systems to the same world\r\n    geodetic system.\r\n\r\n    5. The reduction of triangulation base lines from the geoid to\r\n    the reference ellipsoid.\r\n\r\n    6. The correction of errors in triangulation in mountainous\r\n    regions due to the effect of the deflections of the vertical.\r\n\r\n    7. Geophysical applications of gravity measurements, e.g., the\r\n    isostatic study of the earth's interior and the exploration of\r\n    oil fields and ore deposits.\r\n\r\nWith astronomical observations or with existing triangulations, the\r\ngravimetric method can accomplish further results. Heiskanen and Vening\r\nMeinesz state:\r\n\r\n    It is the firm conviction of the authors that the gravimetric\r\n    method is by far the best of the existing methods for solving\r\n    the main problems of geodesy, i.e., to determine the shape of\r\n    the geoid on the continents as well as at sea and to convert the\r\n    existing geodetic systems to the world geodetic system. It can\r\n    also give invaluable help in the computation of the reference\r\n    ellipsoid.[114]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nSummary\r\n\r\n\r\nSince the creation of classical mechanics in the 17th century, the\r\npendulum has been a basic instrument for the determination of the\r\nintensity of gravity, which is expressed as the acceleration of a freely\r\nfalling body. Basis of theory is the simple pendulum, whose time of\r\nswing under gravity is proportional to the square root of the length\r\ndivided by the acceleration due to gravity. Since the length of a simple\r\npendulum divided by the square of its time of swing is equal to the\r\nlength of a pendulum that beats seconds, the intensity of gravity also\r\nhas been expressed in terms of the length of the seconds pendulum. The\r\nreversible compound pendulum has served for the absolute determination\r\nof gravity by means of a theory developed by Huygens. Invariable\r\ncompound pendulums with single axes also have been used to determine\r\nrelative values of gravity by comparative times of swing.\r\n\r\nThe history of gravity pendulums begins with the ball or \"simple\"\r\npendulum of Galileo as an approximation to the ideal simple pendulum.\r\nDeterminations of the length of the seconds pendulum by French\r\nscientists culminated in a historic determination at Paris by Borda and\r\nCassini, from the corrected observations with a long ball pendulum. In\r\nthe 19th century, Bessel found the length of the seconds pendulum at\r\nKoenigsberg and Berlin by observations with a ball pendulum and by\r\noriginal theoretical considerations. During the century, however, the\r\ncompound pendulum came to be preferred for absolute and relative\r\ndeterminations.\r\n\r\nCapt. Henry Kater, at London, constructed the first convertible compound\r\nfor an absolute determination of gravity, and then he designed an\r\ninvariable compound pendulum, examples of which were used for relative\r\ndeterminations at various stations in Europe and elsewhere. Bessel\r\ndemonstrated theoretically the advantages of a reversible compound\r\npendulum which is symmetrical in form and is hung by interchangeable\r\nknives. The firm of A. Repsold and Sons in Hamburg constructed pendulums\r\nfrom the specifications of Bessel for European gravity surveys.\r\n\r\nCharles S. Peirce in 1875 received delivery in Hamburg of a\r\nRepsold-Bessel pendulum for the U.S. Coast Survey and observed with it\r\nin Geneva, Paris, Berlin, and London. Upon an initial stimulation from\r\nBaeyer, founder of _Die Europaeische Gradmessung_, Peirce demonstrated by\r\nexperiment and theory that results previously obtained with the Repsold\r\napparatus required correction, because of the flexure of the stand under\r\noscillations of the pendulum. At the Stuttgart conference of the\r\ngeodetic association in 1877, Herve Faye proposed to solve the problem\r\nof flexure by swinging two similar pendulums from the same support with\r\nequal amplitudes and in opposite phases. Peirce, in 1879, demonstrated\r\ntheoretically the soundness of the method and presented a design for its\r\napplication, but the \"double pendulum\" was rejected at that time. Peirce\r\nalso designed and had constructed four examples of a new type of\r\ninvariable, reversible pendulum of cylindrical form which made possible\r\nthe experimental study of Stokes' theory of the resistance to motion of\r\na pendulum in a viscous fluid. Commandant Defforges, of France, also\r\ndesigned and used cylindrical reversible pendulums, but of different\r\nlength so that the effect of flexure was eliminated in the reduction of\r\nobservations. Maj. Robert von Sterneck, of Austria-Hungary, initiated a\r\nnew era in gravity research by the invention of an apparatus with a\r\nshort pendulum for relative determinations of gravity. Stands were then\r\nconstructed in Europe on which two or four pendulums were hung at the\r\nsame time. Finally, early in the present century, Vening Meinesz found\r\nthat the Faye-Peirce method of swinging pendulums hung on a Stueckrath\r\nfour-pendulum stand solved the problem of instability due to the\r\nmobility of the soil in Holland.\r\n\r\nThe 20th century has witnessed increasing activity in the determination\r\nof absolute and relative values of gravity. Gravimeters have been\r\nperfected and have been widely used for rapid relative determinations,\r\nbut the compound pendulums remain as indispensable instruments.\r\nMendenhall's replacement of knives by planes attached to nonreversible\r\npendulums has been used also for reversible ones. The Geodetic Institute\r\nat Potsdam is presently applying the Faye-Peirce method to the\r\nreversible pendulum.[115] Pendulums have been constructed of new\r\nmaterials, such as invar, fused silica, and fused quartz. Minimum\r\npendulums for precise relative determinations have been constructed and\r\nused. Reversible pendulums have been made with \"I\" cross sections for\r\nbetter stiffness. With all these modifications, however, the foundations\r\nof the present designs of compound pendulum apparatus were created in\r\nthe 19th century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The basic historical documents have been collected, with a\r\nbibliography of works and memoirs published from 1629 to the end of\r\n1885, in _Collection de memoires relatifs a la physique, publies par la\r\nSociete francaise de Physique_ [hereinafter referred to as _Collection\r\nde memoires_]: vol. 4, _Memoires sur le pendule, precedes d'une\r\nbibliographie_ (Paris: Gauthier-Villars, 1889); and vol. 5, _Memoires\r\nsur le pendule_, part 2 (Paris: Gauthier-Villars, 1891).

Triangular knife edges 2 in. long were\r\ninserted through triangular apertures 19.7 in. from the center towards\r\neach end. These pendulums seem not to have survived. There is, however,\r\nin the collection of the U.S. National Museum, a similar brass pendulum,\r\n37-5/8 in. long (fig. 15) stamped with the name of Edward Kuebel\r\n(1820-96), who maintained an instrument business in Washington, D.C.,\r\nfrom about 1849. The history of this instrument is unknown.\r\n\r\n[37] See Baily's remarks in the _Monthly Notices of the Royal\r\nAstronomical Society_ (1839), vol. 4, pp. 141-143.
